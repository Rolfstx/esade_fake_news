How To Correct Your Posture - 5 Home Exercises To Fix Your Posture,People & Blogs,1642176,"58,996",829,"Poor posture can result in neck pain, shoulder knots/tension, and headache pain. As a physical therapist these are common complaints I treat in my clinic - oftentimes these issues correlate directly with a person's posture. Today I'm sharing 5 of my favorite exercises you can do at home to help correct these postural issues.Here's an Amazon link to my favorite foam roller: https://amzn.to/2PTB2SDDAILY STRENGTH TRAINING ROUTINE AT HOME: https://youtu.be/xb0vui7Ny8A6-MINUTE POSTURE CORRECTION WITH A FOAM ROLLER: https://youtu.be/8otTdS5DhE4HOW TO ELIMINATE MUSCLE KNOTS IN YOUR NECK, SHOULDERS, AND BACK: https://youtu.be/9PC9Mn0VO00BEST EXERCISES FOR UPPER BACK PAINhttps://youtu.be/cGjZ_XAvaXISETUP YOUR DESK TO IMPROVE YOUR POSTURE AND ELIMINATE NECK/SHOULDER PAIN:https://youtu.be/x12GnuV9QgwAs a physical therapist, I treat many posture related problems.The thing is – people don’t come in to my clinic complaining of “bad posture“. People come into my clinic complaining of the symptoms that are typically associated with bad posture. Neck pain, knots in your upper shoulders, headache pain, etc. are typically related to poor posture.These are the complaints for which people typically seek Physical Therapy help; little do these patients know how many of them wouldn’t be in any pain if they just spent some time addressing their posture!Today on Tone and Tighten I wanted to discuss these postural issues – specifically what is poor posture, why you developed it, and some simple exercises you can do to correct this problem.What is it?Poor posture is typically characterized by what we refer to as a “forward head and rounded shoulders“ posture. When you stand up straight and tall, if I were to look at your profile from the side your ear should be directly located over the tip of your shoulder. Your sternum/chest should be pointed up with your shoulder blades sent back. This is what “good“ posture looks like.In this position, gravity holds your head squarely on top your neck with very minimal muscle activation required. This results in minimal tension, decreased muscle knots, and decreased muscle activation.Now let’s take a look at the implications of bad posture…Again, bad posture is typically characterized by a “forward head and rounded shoulders“. Forward head refers to the position of your head relative to your shoulders. It simply means that if I were to look at your standing posture from the profile view your ear would be out in front of the tip of your shoulder.This typically causes a “rounding“ forward of the shoulder blades and an increased visible “hump“ in the upper back.In this position, your head is not in an ideal anatomical location. Gravity would cause it to flop forward if not for some muscle activation to hold it up. So to prevent your head from flopping forward you must activate the muscles in your neck and upper shoulders.15–30 minutes at a time this might be OK, but when you spend 8 – 12 – 16 hours in this position, those muscles can get extremely fatigued.The result is increased tension in your neck, pain with movement, stiffness, knots in your upper shoulders, and even headaches.So what do we do about it?The muscles in your body are highly adaptable to stresses placed on them or removed from them.Our forward head and rounded shoulders posture typically results in what we refer to as an “upper cross syndrome“. The muscles through the front of your chest and back of your neck get tight while the muscles through your upper back and front of your neck get stretched out and week.The treatment for this poor posture issue is to basically reverse our “upper cross syndrome“. We need to stretch where it’s tight (upper chest, front of the shoulders, and neck) and strengthen where it’s weak (rhomboids and middle traps – between your shoulder blades).Here are 5 of my favorite exercises to help you overcome these problems. Push “Play” on the video above for a detailed description of the principles discussed in this post including an explanation of the following exercises.Remember – oftentimes you don’t feel “poor posture”… but you certainly feel the effects from it. If you carry a large amount of tension in your neck and shoulders, get neck pain regularly, or experience tension headaches – your posture certainly could be playing a role in that.Performing these exercises regularly will help to improve your posture. In fact many of my patients notice a significant improvement in about a month; it might be up to 3 months to see a remarkable improvement (it took your body a long time to develop poor posture; it’s going to take some time and effort to reverse this problem). You have to be diligent and consistent, but I know these can help you out!",PT13M33S,2018-04-12,2018-04-12,1211,Tone and Tighten,/channel/UCJASBOyF4Fkd26SIwRhLuZw,UCJASBOyF4Fkd26SIwRhLuZw,19,5R54QoUbbow,"Hi - I'm Jared!

Awkward Meghan Markle Moments That Were Captured By Millions,Entertainment,538456,"1,477",628,"We've all experienced awkward moments, but for those in the public eye, one awkward moment could be witnessed by millions. Of course, Meghan Markle is no stranger to having all eyes on her. As a former commoner learning the ropes of royal behavior, the new duchess has already experienced quite a few awkward moments for all the world to see.Meghan Markle is usually on her best behavior, but the duchess was once captured having a giggle fit in church, of all places. In March 2018, at the Commonwealth Day service in Westminster Abbey, One Direction singer Liam Payne took to the stage to perform John Mayer’s hit song, ""Waiting on the World to Change."" As his performance came to an end, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were captured sharing a knowing glance as the rest of the audience applauded, with Harry raising his eyebrows and Meghan erupting in laughter.Were they laughing because they disliked the performance? It's impossible to say. Nevertheless, the two were literally caught giggling in church. It may have been an awkward moment, but it was a pretty funny one, too.During Meghan Markle’s engagement to Prince Harry, the soon-to-be royal was tasked with presenting awards at the Endeavour Fund ceremony. The organization, founded by Prince Harry in 2012, provides support for sick, wounded, and injured members of the military, and recognizes outstanding servicemen and women with awards each year. And while this event usually goes off without a hitch, the 2018 ceremony experienced a few hiccups.While the duchess stood on stage with a co-presenter, there appeared to be a mix-up with the notes. After rifling through his papers for what seemed like forever, the poor guy tried to salvage the awkward situation with a joke. Although her stage partner was visibly flustered by the whole ordeal, Meghan swooped in and tried to deflect some of the tension with a few laughs, encouraging the audience to do the same. #MeghanMarkle #RoyalCoupleA giggle fit in church | 0:18The award mixup | 0:54An overly-affectionate back rub? | 1:39A snub of royal proportions | 2:34Being dubbed ""a fat lady"" | 3:24",PT4M28S,2019-03-20,2019-03-20,221,The List,/channel/UCJ7dtuZhjFSJvb_CZjWJkng,UCJ7dtuZhjFSJvb_CZjWJkng,19,shCfsMYbJkc,"The List is a women’s lifestyle site, with a twist.

The best sleeping position for you is one that is comfortable and holds your spine in the correct posture: The bottom line is the best sleeping position for you is which ever position you find to be the most comfortable while keeping your spine in as neutral a position as possible. Make sure you are aware of your spine alignment front to back, side to side, as well as if you are rotating or not.2. To get the right posture you need the right support: In order to achieve a correct, neutral spine posture, you need to have the right support from your mattress and from your pillow.Mattress: It is recommended that you replace your mattress every 8-10 years. If patients come to me who wake up with pain/stiffness in their spine often they’re sleeping on an older mattress. If it’s been a decade since you got a new mattress it might be time.Pillow: I make pillow recommendations based solely on two things - body type and sleeping posture. I would recommend a different pillow for someone with a petite frame versus a larger frame. Similarly, it you slept primarily on your back my recommendation would be different than if you slept primarily on your side.3. Stomach Sleep: DON’T DO IT! This is the worst of all the postures you can sleep in through the night. It maximally rotates your neck all night, it puts your lower back in an extended position, and it puts pressure on your internal organs. Stop sleeping on your stomach.4. Side Sleepers: Again the goal is to achieve as close to neutral spine as possible. This is achieved with proper support for your head/neck, torso, and hips/legs.Head and neck: you want a pillow that supports your neck in a neutral position. If your pillow is too full your neck will be bent too much up towards the ceiling. If your pillow is too flat your head will be bent too much down towards your bed. Try to find the right pillow to achieve a neutral spine position.Torso: Again, this is where the right mattress comes into play. It needs to be firm enough to support the side of your trunk but soft enough to unload your shoulders and hips (areas of higher pressure). You can also get small pillows designed specifically to achieve this goal. Click here to see these pillows:Hips: Oftentimes when we sleep on our sides our top leg rests on top of our bottom leg putting pressure on your knees, pulling on your hips, and pulling your spine out of alignment. My solution here is to sleep with a pillow between your knees to unload stress at all three of these areas. You can even get pillows that specifically go between your legs that are intended for side sleepers; check out this link to get yours:5. Back sleepers: Back sleepers are typically a little more prone to snoring, but if you can handle that it’s a really good position for your back! Again, the whole goal here will be getting your spine into a correct position and supporting it there.Head and neck: Again - you want just the right amount of support to maintain your head/neck at the correct angle. If your pillow is too full, you’ll spend all night with your neck flexed up. If your pillow is too flat, you’ll spend all night with your head extended and your neck unsupported. Typically your pillow should be smaller if you sleep on your back than it would be if you preferred to sleep on your side.Hips: Oftentimes laying out flat on our backs puts a lot of stress on our lower back due to hip flexors pulling on our spine. I always recommend that if you sleep on your back you do so with 1-2 pillows under your knees to unload some pressure in your spine. You can also buy different wedge-shaped pillows designed specifically for this purpose.

Stick to the recipe rigidly, the quantities are very important for successful results2.  Use scales for the measurements including the water, don't convert to cups or measuring jugs, they are too inaccurate 3.  Use proper white bread flour with at least 12% protein, check the ingredients list on the side of the flour bag, protein may show in grams per serving but just work it out, it needs to be 12g of protein per 100g of flour, plain or all purpose flour is not strong enough for making bread. 4.  Check your yeast is working you can do a yeast test as shown in my sandwich bread video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpSb... Any problems or inquiries I'm always here to help.

Learn more about their subscription here: https://mscbd.fm/fstptmAcdsee Photo Studio Professional 2020: https://www.acdsee.com/en/products/ph...In this video, Patrick Hall of Fstoppers walks you through an entire engagement session photoshoot. Even though this session takes place on the beach, all of these techniques can be used no matter what sort of environment you are shooting in. This photography session focuses around using the FujiFilm X-T3 camera, the 16 - 55mm f 2.8 zoom lens, the 90mm f 2.0, and the 50 - 140 f 2.8  zoom lens. This combo of camera and lenses works well for outdoor portraits because FujiFilm handles skin tones really well and also is easily able to capture super wide dynamic range scenes like you would find at the beach. When the light gets too dark or you want more dramatic effect, Patrick uses the powerful and portable Profoto B10 strobe. This strobe is super useful for lighting up a scene and because the battery is built right into the unit, it's super easy for an assistant or friend to hold while you capture epic looking images. All of this gear can easily fit in the Manfrotto Manhattan Mover30 backpack. This backpack is great because not only does it look like a slick urban style backpack, but it also easily converts from a photo backpack with dividers to a normal backpack when you remove the inside shell. Finally, all the images in this video were edited using Acdsee's Photo Studio Professional 2020. This powerful software lets you cull, edit your raw files, and add artistic effects to each of your images quickly and easily.
