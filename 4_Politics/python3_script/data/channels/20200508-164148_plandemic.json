My first professional recording session, for a corporate client was in 1975. The first of my bands to reach any level of notoriety was the Fast Set in 1981. We were featured on the Synth-Pop classic Some Bizarre Album, and played all over the UK. Around the same time I played bass on \"Pass Myself\", a highly collectable single by Neo-Psychedelic band the Third Eye, and several singles and albums for Danielle Dax.\n\nI have toured and recorded with many British Blues Bands, notably Chad Strentz & The Chad-illacs, Shout Sister Shout, Breakout Blues and Mo'Indigo. I have toured as lead guitar sideman with several American Blues and R'n'B artists, including Earl Gaines, Al Garner, Deacon Jones, Chick Willis and Taka Boom.",

You may find some clips from some of the work I do at my other job as well mixed in. We are a family owned business that was started in 1972, and today I carry on the tradition as a third generation machinist. I try to be helpful and informative with my job and work descriptions in hopes that others my learn the machining trade as well. I like to use my GoPro HD cameras to make clear and enjoyable videos to watch. You may also find a few other personal videos of my family and I, as well as some road trip and local exploration videos of the Gulf Coast  from time to time. Please feel free to post comments and questions about my work. I hope you guys enjoy!\n\nAdam",

You may find some clips from some of the work I do at my other job as well mixed in. We are a family owned business that was started in 1972, and today I carry on the tradition as a third generation machinist. I try to be helpful and informative with my job and work descriptions in hopes that others my learn the machining trade as well. I like to use my GoPro HD cameras to make clear and enjoyable videos to watch. You may also find a few other personal videos of my family and I, as well as some road trip and local exploration videos of the Gulf Coast  from time to time. Please feel free to post comments and questions about my work. I hope you guys enjoy!\n\nAdam"

Frans Elsen was a very important Dutch pianist, arranger and educator of Jazz. He and Barry shared a mutual appreciation of each others music and were close friends. This material has been edited and selected by Frans himself. It gives a unique insight in Barry's wonderful ways of teaching and his extraordinary musicianship.

Frans Elsen was a very important Dutch pianist, arranger and educator of Jazz. He and Barry shared a mutual appreciation of each others music and were close friends. This material has been edited and selected by Frans himself. It gives a unique insight in Barry's wonderful ways of teaching and his extraordinary musicianship.

Giving up everything cool/lovely/fun for as long as you live. The good news? Frugal just got a facelift. Follow me as I teach you how to have more, do more, and live more than you ever thought possible...and have a lot of fun while doing it.\n\nJordan Page is the founder of the popular blog FunCheapOrFree.com, and fun online budgeting programming BudgetBootCamp.com, as well as ProductivityBootCamp.com. After getting out of $15k credit card debt in 13 months (on only a $31k salary!) she loves proving that you can live a fabulous BECAUSE of frugal living, not in spite of it. Her innovative money management tips have been landed her on the Today Show, Inside Edition, TLC, Good Morning America, Today Australia, YOU Magazine, Us News, Rachael Ray, and more. Aside from blogging she is an entrepreneur, kitchen dancer, and busy mom to 6 kids in 8 years.",

Giving up everything cool/lovely/fun for as long as you live. The good news? Frugal just got a facelift. Follow me as I teach you how to have more, do more, and live more than you ever thought possible...and have a lot of fun while doing it.\n\nJordan Page is the founder of the popular blog FunCheapOrFree.com, and fun online budgeting programming BudgetBootCamp.com, as well as ProductivityBootCamp.com. After getting out of $15k credit card debt in 13 months (on only a $31k salary!) she loves proving that you can live a fabulous BECAUSE of frugal living, not in spite of it. Her innovative money management tips have been landed her on the Today Show, Inside Edition, TLC, Good Morning America, Today Australia, YOU Magazine, Us News, Rachael Ray, and more. Aside from blogging she is an entrepreneur, kitchen dancer, and busy mom to 6 kids in 8 years."

I'm also pretty into using GeoGebra, but there aren't as many videos featuring it.\n\nI really just make videos because I enjoy it as a hobby, though it does match up with my actual job as a high school math teacher--do what you love, right?\n\nIn addition to videos about how to use the TI-Nspire and how to solve AP Calculus Free Response Questions, you'll find a  lot of videos about Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus.  A lot of the videos go along with the notes available  at turksmathstuff.com.\n\nIf you have any requests let me know!",

I'm also pretty into using GeoGebra, but there aren't as many videos featuring it.\n\nI really just make videos because I enjoy it as a hobby, though it does match up with my actual job as a high school math teacher--do what you love, right?\n\nIn addition to videos about how to use the TI-Nspire and how to solve AP Calculus Free Response Questions, you'll find a  lot of videos about Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus.  A lot of the videos go along with the notes available  at turksmathstuff.com.\n\nIf you have any requests let me know!"

It used to be you felt the need to keep up with your neighbors and friends\u2026now it\u2019s all of Facebook. You see the beautifully framed and filtered shots of happy children and parents on Instagram.\n\nHousehold peace, even momentary, is more difficult than you thought. The tug of work (do those emails ever quit?), keeping house (didn\u2019t we just pick up this room?), giving your children positive attention, making sure they are being stimulated with outings, lessons, athletics\u2026.\n\nI\u2019d like to share my experiences, knowledge, and expertise with you. To help you be a better parent. To enjoy your children, spouse, and family more. To grow closer to each other and God. You already have most of what you need. I can give you the confidence and reassurance that you can do this."

Offbeat topics you won't find elsewhere, enriched with a government-mandated dose of humour. Trained in Cambridge; now PhD-ing in London.\n\nThere's a lot of bad science on YouTube, especially medicine, with quacks and clowns peddling garbage. \n\nFor people interested in science, comedy and mostly useless biological trivia, subscribing to this channel was found to be non-inferior to placebo. If that isn't a ringing endorsement I don't know what it is.\n\nWho says science has to be serious?\n\nDr Rohin Francis\n\nPlease don't ask for medical advice as I cannot give any online. Nothing I say is medical advice. How do you even know I'm a doctor? I'm just an early IBM Watson prototype that went horribly wrong."

I provide unbiased information for you to use within your gardens. I cover all aspects of vegetable gardening from seed starting to tending, harvesting, cooking and provide tools and ideas to battle garden pests and diseases. I have nearly 1000 garden videos between two channels. Keyword search the vegetable garden topic that interests you most, if you don't see a video!\n\nCheck out my seed and garden shop at http://www.therustedgarden.com. I sell most of the seeds for the varieties you see in my garden and I have a MFVG Tab (My First Vegetable Garden) where you can find seed package deals for well under $1 per package. They changes weekly!  Dig around!  And thanks for giving The Rusted Garden a chance to share with you!",

I provide unbiased information for you to use within your gardens. I cover all aspects of vegetable gardening from seed starting to tending, harvesting, cooking and provide tools and ideas to battle garden pests and diseases. I have nearly 1000 garden videos between two channels. Keyword search the vegetable garden topic that interests you most, if you don't see a video!\n\nCheck out my seed and garden shop at http://www.therustedgarden.com. I sell most of the seeds for the varieties you see in my garden and I have a MFVG Tab (My First Vegetable Garden) where you can find seed package deals for well under $1 per package. They changes weekly!  Dig around!  And thanks for giving The Rusted Garden a chance to share with you!"

THRIFT ALONG WITH ME. Watch my THRIFT HAULs to see what I find, what I paid and what the item is going to sell for on eBay or etsy.

We're in Zone 9a so we can get an early start on the garden.\n\nOn our channel I want to provide basic how-to videos for new gardeners, as well as more detailed investigations of methods and techniques, experiments and trials, that are aimed at helping the established gardening community in whatever way I can. All of this, of course, while we continue to learn and share our mistakes. Its a wonderful world in the garden, and we hope you will enjoy or little patch of peace.\n\nBlack Gumbo Southern Gardening Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/blackgumbo/\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/blackgumbosoutherngardening/\nAlysheba Kitchen Cooking Blog: https://alyshebakitchen.wordpress.com/",

We're in Zone 9a so we can get an early start on the garden.\n\nOn our channel I want to provide basic how-to videos for new gardeners, as well as more detailed investigations of methods and techniques, experiments and trials, that are aimed at helping the established gardening community in whatever way I can. All of this, of course, while we continue to learn and share our mistakes. Its a wonderful world in the garden, and we hope you will enjoy or little patch of peace.\n\nBlack Gumbo Southern Gardening Facebook Page: https://www.facebook.com/blackgumbo/\nFollow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/blackgumbosoutherngardening/\nAlysheba Kitchen Cooking Blog: https://alyshebakitchen.wordpress.com/"

The 8.01x and 8.02x edX lectures are high resolution (480p) versions of the more commonly seen OCW versions. Some edits were also made by Lewin. 8.03 is the OCW version, also in a 480p resolution. Links to lecture notes, assignments/solutions and exams/solutions are added. Playlists with Help Sessions for 8.01x, 8.02x and 8.03 are also available. They are \"mini lectures\". The problems discussed in these videos should be apparent after watching the first few minutes. Other playlists show Lewin in various appearances and his Bi-Weekly Physics problems/solutions and several excellent lectures by Feynman and others.\nPublished under a Creative Commons (BY-NC-SA) License.
