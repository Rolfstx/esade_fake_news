Kevin and the Global Ghost Team\u2122 now maintain a 100 percent successful track record of being able to penetrate the security of any system they are paid to hack into using a combination of technical exploits and social engineering. Kevin's keynote presentations are akin to technology magic shows which include the latest hacking techniques that educate and inform while keeping people on the edge of their seats. He offers expert commentary on issues related to information security and increases \"security awareness\"."

In 2014 we managed to materialize our dreams and traded a land based home in Poland for a permanent life on the ocean aboard our dearest new home - sailboat \"Poly\". \n\nFor us sailing is a way of free life in sync and harmony with nature and each other. It's a way of experiencing life, people, and places, entirely on our own terms. For many years it was just a dream, but we followed it and it came true. We are here and now, no longer chasing the dream. \n\nWe'd like to share it with you so that you can follow your dreams, too. Follow us to see all the amazing, interesting, crazy, scary, and funny people, places and situations that we experience and learn from.\n\nWelcome to our family life unplugged.\n\nAnia, Bartek, Kuba and Julian\nSailOceans\n\nPlease support our life and travel: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/SailOceans\n\ne423f",

                        "description": "Adventures of Ania and Bartek with two little kids sailing across oceans on a 15 meter trimaran as a way of promoting alternative way of life off the grid. In 2014 we managed to materialize our dreams and traded a land based home in Poland for a permanent life on the ocean aboard our dearest new home - sailboat \"Poly\". \n\nFor us sailing is a way of free life in sync and harmony with nature and each other. It's a way of experiencing life, people, and places, entirely on our own terms. For many years it was just a dream, but we followed it and it came true. We are here and now, no longer chasing the dream. \n\nWe'd like to share it with you so that you can follow your dreams, too. Follow us to see all the amazing, interesting, crazy, scary, and funny people, places and situations that we experience and learn from.\n\nWelcome to our family life unplugged.\n\nAnia, Bartek, Kuba and Julian\nSailOceans\n\nPlease support our life and travel: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/SailOceans\n\ne423f"

You may find some clips from some of the work I do at my other job as well mixed in. We are a family owned business that was started in 1972, and today I carry on the tradition as a third generation machinist. I try to be helpful and informative with my job and work descriptions in hopes that others my learn the machining trade as well. I like to use my GoPro HD cameras to make clear and enjoyable videos to watch. You may also find a few other personal videos of my family and I, as well as some road trip and local exploration videos of the Gulf Coast  from time to time. Please feel free to post comments and questions about my work. I hope you guys enjoy!\n\nAdam",

You may find some clips from some of the work I do at my other job as well mixed in. We are a family owned business that was started in 1972, and today I carry on the tradition as a third generation machinist. I try to be helpful and informative with my job and work descriptions in hopes that others my learn the machining trade as well. I like to use my GoPro HD cameras to make clear and enjoyable videos to watch. You may also find a few other personal videos of my family and I, as well as some road trip and local exploration videos of the Gulf Coast  from time to time. Please feel free to post comments and questions about my work. I hope you guys enjoy!\n\nAdam"

We presently have a 35' Beneteau Oceanis sloop that we sail out of Kingston, Ontario Canada, which is on Lake Ontario.  We have a longer term plan, when we retire in a few years, to sell everything and buy a 40-50' Catamaran and circumnavigate the globe.  Craig loves photography along with land based and drone videography and plans to document everything along our travels to share with the world through Youtube and other social media.  For now, follow our channel as we show you the beauty of the Great Lakes and the 1000 Islands area of the St Lawrence River.  You will also see the steps we take as start narrowing down the Catamaran we think will suit us best as we move closer to our goal of living full time on a sailboat and exploring the world.
