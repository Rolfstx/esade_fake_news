Videos are focused on primitive skills, rewilding, nature awareness, living off the land, off grid living, indigenous skills, shelter building, primitive fire, water purification, trapping, hunting, bow making, flint knapping, primitive pottery,  basketry, edible and medicinal plant preparation and numerous indigenous skills.     I began studying wilderness survival when I was 17 in order to have the ability to spend extensive periods of time in nature, seeking out empowerment and  without the need for external sources.  I began studying in 1993 under Tom Brown Jr eventually teaching for Tracker Inc.  I sought-out every old Native American teacher I could and eventually traveled the world living in very remote indigenous villages in the Amazon, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Peru.  My school teaches survival and primitive skills, nature awareness,  how to live off the land, re-wilding, prepare for disasters.

Join Shaun Attwood, a former stock-market millionaire and Ecstasy supplier turned public speaker, author and activist, as he describes what it was like to end up in Arizona’s deadliest jail and most importantly, what his shocking experience has taught him about happiness in life.Shaun Attwood is a former stock-market millionaire and Ecstasy supplier turned public speaker, author and activist, who is banned from America for life. Shaun’s writing – smuggled out of the jail with the highest death rate in America run by Sheriff Joe Arpaio – attracted international media attention to the human rights violations: murders by guards and gang members, dead rats in the food, cockroach infestations…While incarcerated, Shaun was forced to reappraise his life. He read over 1,000 books in just under six years. By studying original texts in psychology and philosophy, he sought to better understand himself and his past behaviour. He credits books as being the lifeblood of his rehabilitation.Shaun now tells his story to schools to put young people off drugs and crime. He campaigns against injustice via his books and blog, Jon’s Jail Journal. He has appeared on the BBC, Sky News and TV worldwide to talk about issues affecting prisoners’ rights.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

I was about to buy some for a project but the quality ones I found were $107.00 online, so I did some research and decided to make mine.I studied some material properties, and of all domestics, oak has the second highest modulus of elasticity behind only hickory. With over 1.8 million pounds/sq.in.  Modulus of elasticity defines the relationship between stress and strain, and effectively measures stiffness. The exact property you want in the arm of a clamp.  I also found a study done with Fine Woodworking Magazine & Case Western Reserve University in 2007 measuring glue bond strengths. It utilized 6 glue types and different species of wood, 162 joints tested in all. Among the domestics, red oak combined with type 1 PVA glue (Titebond), had by far the greatest bond strength.  So, it was a no-brainer. Oak, is cheap as a hardwood. You can buy #2 common, because narrow sizes are all that is needed. And, many people have oak offcuts hanging around.I did buy a 36” maple dowel for the screw thread. It was a 1-1/2” diameter. You could certainly turn one. But for me this was easier. And one dowel makes 2 clamps. I made 2 clamps with the intention of testing them to destruction, but I didn’t have a strong enough scale. After I get one and do that, I think I’ll make 10 for my shop, and I’ll have paid less than buying a single one online.I did cut all the threads and tapped the clamp. This is easy to do.Detailed plans are available on my website if you are interested in duplicating these. http://kingsfinewoodworking.comNOTE: Matthias Wandel, and John Heisz are both fantastic woodworkers.

"The Hype Over Quantum Computers, Explained",News & Politics,953627,"13,110",541,"In October 2019, Google made a big announcement. It announced its 53-qubit quantum computer named Sycamore had achieved ‘quantum supremacy.’ That’s when quantum computers can complete tasks exponentially more quickly than their classical counterparts. In this case, Google said its quantum machine completed a task in 200 seconds that would have taken the world’s most powerful computer 10,000 years to complete. IBM, another major player in quantum computing, took issue with the findings. Either way, it was a big milestone in quantum computing, and it’s leading to a lot of hype in the field.

"The World's Most Dangerous Approach - Paro, Bhutan",Travel & Events,7720887,"112,260","3,279","Join me on a flight with Bhutan Airlines (Tashi Air) A319 from Kathmandu to Paro, Bhutan. Paro Airport is situated in between mountains and valleys at 7,332 ft above sea level. The approach is well considered as one of the most dangerous and most spectacular in the world. Check out the amazing landing footage.In addition, the flight also flew across many top 10 mountains in the world include Mt Everest.-------Join us for a spectacular and thrilling, up close, documentary look at the world’s most dangerous airport landing at Paro airport in Bhutan. Make sure you watch all the way to the end of the video to catch the sped up, bird’s eye view of the fabulous and graceful twisting and turning of the aeroplane on its approach to the landing strip of Paro airport, the sole international airport of Bhutan located six kilometres from Paro in a very deep valley on the bank of the river Paro Chhu, and how the runway suddenly appears from nowhere. It takes a real aviation expert and a very steady hand to make a safe landing at Paro airport!In this video, we fly from Kathmandu airport in Nepal to Paro airport in Bhutan using Bhutan airlines. After a brief look inside Kathmandu airport’s executive airport lounge, we board our flight and meet the chief pilot of Bhutan airlines – we’re in safe hands; only a handful of trained captains are qualified and certified to land at Paro airport and it takes a minimum of eight to ten years of intensive training to become a captain.We examine the runway at Kathmandu airport which is very bumpy and, interestingly, has no taxiways to the main runway, necessitating the use of some tricky manoeuvres and, needless to say, keen attention paid to air traffic control.The flight is only forty minutes long but the flight is still packed with events and sights. In the video, we see most of the top ten highest mountains in the world within the Himalayas including Mount Makalu, Mount Lhotse and the tallest of all, Mount Everest. We also see the mountains of Bhutan within the Himalayan mountain range including Jomolhari and Jitchu Drake. The pictures of the snow capped mountains of the Himalayas are breath taking and we hear the captain’s opinions of why he thinks there is less snow now than there was in previous years.We also enjoy lunch with champagne on board and we enjoy sharing a specially made cake with the Bhutan airlines crew to celebrate our travelling with them to the legendary Paro airport of Bhutan.Paro airport is surrounded by mountains as high as 5500 metres and only has a single runway of length 1964 metres. Its single terminal was constructed in 1999 and it is a hub for two airlines: Bhutan airlines and Druk Air. Paro airport is such a difficult airport to land in that it can only be used in visual meteorological conditions and operational hours are restricted to daylight hours between sunrise and sunset.You really won’t want to miss this video focusing on the world’s most challenging airport to land at. Let us know in the comments what you thought of the scenery and the whole experience and, as always, thanks for watching!",PT17M37S,2019-04-20,2019-04-20,34315,Sam Chui,/channel/UCfYCRj25JJQ41JGPqiqXmJw,UCfYCRj25JJQ41JGPqiqXmJw,19,SbLHah4XUwk

"Ayaan Hirsi Ali on the West, Dawa, and Islam",News & Politics,414264,"12,185",584,"Recorded on July 12, 2017Ayaan Hirsi Ali joins Peter Robinson to discuss her new book, The Challenge of Dawa: Political Islam as Ideology and Movement and How to Contain It, and her views on the challenges facing Western civilization in regards to political Islam.  She argues that Islam needs to be separated into two different parts, one part of religion and the other part, political philosophy. She concedes that many aspects of the religious part of Islam are peaceful but argues that the political side is much more concerning due to its focus on Dawa, which means “to plead or to call non-Muslims to Islam.” This call to convert people to Islam is what she argues was a driving force behind the spread of Islam throughout history. Hirsi Ali argues that American political philosophy and classical liberalism are young philosophies in comparison to the fourteen centuries of Islamic political doctrine and that its age and layered-ness are often underestimated by Western minds who are more familiar with younger political philosophies. She discusses the critiques of the philosopher Karl Popper of communism and fascism and how they relate directly to the ideologies of Islam. She argues that the language of appeasement often used toward radical Islamic terrorism is too gentle and that  discussions of how to deal with Islam need to be considerably franker.Earlier this year Ayaan Hirsi Ali was called before Congress to testify on her book The Challenge of Dawa. She discusses her testimony and that although she was invited by a Democrat senator to speak “about the ideology of radical Islam,” the Democrats present didn’t ask her a single question because they were likely uncomfortable with what she had to say about Islam. She argues that just as Western civilizations have defeated dangerous ideologies in the past, she is optimistic that Western civilization will succeed against political Islam for, as she says, “[Jihadis] can’t destroy us without permission.” She says if we take the fight to the “battlefield of ideas” we can defeat radical Islamic ideologies with Western beliefs. About the GuestAyaan Hirsi Ali was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1969. As a young child she was subjected to female genital mutilation; as she grew up she embraced Islam and strove to live as a devout Muslim. But she began to question aspects of her faith. One day, while listening to a sermon on the many ways women should be obedient to their husbands, she couldn't resist asking, ""Must our husbands obey us too?"" In 2007 Hirsi Ali founded the AHA Foundation to protect and defend the rights of women in the United States from harmful traditional practices. Today the foundation is the leading organization working to end violence that shames, hurts, or kills thousands of women and girls in the United States each year and puts millions more at risk. Hirsi Ali is a fellow with the Future of Diplomacy Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School, a visiting scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC, and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. Hirsi Ali is currently researching the relationship between the West and Islam. She must live with round-the-clock security, as her willingness to speak out and her abandonment of the Muslim faith have made her a target for violence by Islamic extremists. Ayaan Hirsi Ali was named one of Time magazine's ""100 Most Influential People"" of 2005, one of the Glamour Heroes of 2005, and Reader's Digest's European of the Year for 2005. She is the best-selling author of Infidel (2007) and Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now (2015).

Underground dome house of the family who led geese to fly home,Autos & Vehicles,2610648,"57,556","1,691","Paula and Bill Lishman spent many winters in a poorly-insulated A frame cabin before realizing they needed to go underground to use the earth’s energy to stay warm, so they knocked the top off a hill, dropped in ferro-cement domes and covered it up again with dirt. Thanks to skylights cut into every dome and the white-powdered marble that covers the interior, their earth-sheltered home is naturally well-lit despite being below the frost line. Fifteen feet below ground, the soil temperature remains about equal to the annual average temperature of the area’s surface air so earth-sheltered homes use sod’s constant temperature to stay warmer in winter and cooler in summer.Bill Lishman believed in rethinking not just the conventional home, but also how we live. He reimagined his home’s refrigerator by building a round appliance that pops up out of the countertop so the heavier cool air stays inside when opened (via compressed air).In 1986, Bill Lishman began training Canada Geese to follow his ultralight aircraft and to ""teach"" the birds migration routes to avoid a threatened extinction. His work on ""Operation Migration"" brought him popular recognition with the 1996 movie Fly Away Home starring Jeff Daniels.Paula Lishman also believes in rethinking convention. In 1979 she began her fashion label reinventing the fur trade by using spun fur to knit her clothing.http://williamlishman.com/http://www.paulalishman.comhttps://faircompanies.com/videos/unde...",PT23M33S,2019-08-17,2019-08-17,355131,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,20,RoGuvvzHY1A

I began studying wilderness survival when I was 17 in order to have the ability to spend extensive periods of time in nature, seeking out empowerment and without the need for external sources. I began studying in 1993 under Tom Brown Jr eventually teaching for Tracker Inc. I sought-out every old Native American teacher I could and eventually traveled the world living in very remote indigenous villages in the Amazon, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Peru.

🇺🇸 Who Killed Robert Kennedy? | Al Jazeera World,News & Politics,570221,"4,099",437,"Filmmaker: Bahiya Namour Fifty years ago, United States Senator Robert F Kennedy was assassinated at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles just moments after he'd won California's Democratic presidential primary.Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, a Palestinian with Jordanian citizenship, was arrested at the scene of the shooting in what the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) thought was an open-and-shut case.Sirhan was tried and jailed for Robert Kennedy's murder. But since the 1970s, there have been calls for a new investigation into the assassination, based on differing witness accounts, the number of shots fired and distance of Sirhan from Kennedy when he fired.""We're trying to prove there was a travesty of justice in 1969 at Sirhan's trial. We're trying to prove that there was no way that he could have shot the senator, let alone have killed the senator,"" says Laurie Dusek, a member of Sirhan's defence team.Kennedy's wounds suggest his assassin - or assassins - stood behind him, but eyewitnesses place Sirhan about a metre away and almost in front of him. This has led to suggestions that a second gunman may have fired the fatal shot, a theory supported by Chief Medical Examiner-Coroner for the County of Los Angeles, Thomas Noguchi, who stated in his report that the shot that killed Kennedy was fired at the point-blank range next to his right ear.""The only way to explain this that there was a second gunman in a position behind Kennedy, but the prosecution never proved that Sirhan was behind Kennedy or was able to shoot him point blank,"" says eyewitness Paul Schrade.Witness accounts and more recent forensic analysis support the view that more bullets were fired at the scene than Sirhan could have had in his gun.Sirhan's .22 Iver-Johnson revolver could only hold eight bullets, yet as many as 13 shots may have been fired at the scene. Two FBI investigators who attended the crime scene right after the assassination stated that they had discovered two bullets in a door frame - bullets that were not mentioned in the LAPD's report.""If a second gun is not firing, there cannot be any bullet holes in the wooden door frames,"" explains William Klaber, a journalist and writer who has studied the case extensively. ""So the police take those door frames down and they bring them to the police station to do work on them. It turns out these bullets represent too many bullets. Sirhan's gun holds eight bullets.""Robert Kennedy's death, like the 1963 assassination of his older brother, President John F Kennedy, has been the subject of many conspiracy theories.One suggests that if Bobby were ever elected president, it's almost certain he would have ordered a fresh investigation into his brother's assassination, unconvinced as he was by the official version in the Warren Commission report. Other theories include had Robert Kennedy been elected president, he would have taken steps to end the war in Vietnam.RFK was a principled politician, a New York senator who cared about poverty in the south and racial segregation everywhere. His ideals of a more equal society were never realised but the scale of grief following his death showed how much people appreciated him.After his body had been flown from California to New York, it was put on board a train to Washington, DC for burial next to his brother John at Arlington National Cemetery - and the railway line was lined with millions of mourners. The journey, however, to establish clearly how he died is still incomplete.More from Al Jazeera World on:YouTube - http://aje.io/aljazeeraworldYTFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/AlJazeeraWorldTwitter - https://twitter.com/AlJazeera_WorldVisit our website - http://www.aljazeera.com/aljazeeraworldSubscribe to AJE on YouTube - http://aje.io/YTsubscribe#AlJazeeraWorld #AlJazeeraEnglish #RobertKennedy",PT46M24S,2018-11-14,2018-11-14,325451,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,SVScM_9Tn-s

On New York City's Coronavirus Frontline | Foreign Correspondent,News & Politics,198872,"2,279",109,"The Big Apple is in bad shape.It’s the epicentre of the US fight against the corona virus outbreak. Its people are in lockdown while frontline services wage war against the pandemic.  With over fourteen thousand dead, New York City accounts for around one third of all corona-related deaths in the US.Every day, there are hundreds of new infections and deaths. The city’s hospitals are overflowing, health workers lack medical and protective equipment and morgues have run out of space.  Foreign Correspondent’s reporter Karishma Vyas, a New York resident, goes behind the lines of the city’s battle to slow infections, save lives, protect its vulnerable and bury the dead.  We follow paramedics as they respond to emergency house calls, helping desperate families. We discover many who die of COVID-19 don’t make the official death toll.We film with the police union as they hand out desperately needed personal safety equipment to their officers.  “I thought I’d seen it all on September 11th, but I’ve never seen anything like this. We’re anticipating this getting even worse. So that’s why we’re trying to get this equipment out to our guys”, says a Union officer.We speak with an ICU nurse who’s travelled from out of state to lend a hand in a Bronx hospital. He tells us about working double shifts, often with no break, and the pressure of looking after multiple critically ill patients at the same time. A good day is when none of his patients die.  One overworked doctor describes his frustration with the US health system.  “I’ve had people come in barely breathing and their first question isn’t ‘Am I going to survive?’ It’s ‘How is this going to impact my family financially?’”  “This illness exposes all the fault-lines throughout American society”, says the doctor.  And we catch up with characters who embody the city’s spirit of defiance and survival.  “I want to be remembered as someone who never left the frontlines and who was essential”, says the Naked Cowboy, a performer whose stage is Times Square – rain, hail or coronavirus.This is an intimate and powerful portrait of a city in crisis.About Foreign Correspondent: Foreign Correspondent is the prime-time international public affairs program on Australia's national broadcaster, ABC-TV. We produce half-hour duration in-depth reports for broadcast across the ABC's television channels and digital platforms.

MarjoramDirections:Take your sliced eggplant and lay the rounds out on a rack and sprinkle them with salt.  Repeat the process on the other side as well.  Let the eggplant sweat for about 20 to 30 minutes.  This will help to pull out some moisture in the eggplant so that they will crisp up easier.After 30 min. rinse the eggplant under running water to remove the salt.  Pat the eggplant dry with paper towels.Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F and coat your baking pan with a light coating of olive oil.In a wide bowl, combine the panko crumbs, flour, and all the Italian seasonings.  Whisk the eggs in a separate bowl.Dip a slice of eggplant into the egg mixture and then into the panko crumb mixture to coat on all sides.  Then place the slice onto your prepared baking sheet.  Continue doing this until the pan is full.  Be sure not to crowd the pieces so they can brown up properly.Shave paper thin slices of butter on top of each piece of eggplant.  Place in the oven for about 30 minutes or until golden brown.  Turn the slices over half way through the cooking time. You can garnish with chopped fresh parsley.These are perfect for an appetizer or side dish.  Enjoy!Thanks for watching and sharing!Rockin RobinP.S.

But what about when those technologies destroy the environment?

Michael Shellenberger is a Time Magazine Hero of the Environment and President of Environmental Progress, a research and policy organization. A lifelong environmentalist, Michael changed his mind about nuclear energy and has helped save enough nuclear reactors to prevent an increase in carbon emissions equivalent to adding more than 10 million cars to the road.

Heat your oil to 350 degrees and take the flour coated onion rings(using a chop stick or wooden skewer) and dip them into the batter, (let them soak in the batter until the batter sticks to the flour already on the onion rings.)Drop them in the oil and cook until nice and golden brown.They cook really nice. I find it is hard to over cook them.Remove and place them on a bed of paper towels. Hit them witha light dusting of salt as soon as they come out of the oil.Let them rest for a minute or two and serve hot!Enjoy!#onionring #crispyonionrings #beerbatter #homemadeonionrings #easyrecipe #cookingwithshotgunred-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-Please watch: ""Curly Fries in Air Fryer | Homemade EASY Crispy Parmesan Fries"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkR3P...-~-~~-~~~-~~-~-",PT23M18S,2018-05-03,2018-05-03,324255,Cooking with Shotgun Red,/channel/UCjlgDApB1OrU_3-1dLMHOZg,UCjlgDApB1OrU_3-1dLMHOZg,19,RvUgla-LsWo

"COVID-19 in China, South-Korea, Taiwan and Japan | DW Documentary",Education,655797,"3,891",666,"China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan appear to have coronavirus pretty well under control. Much of that is down to early response, close monitoring and extensive use of modern science and technology. And not to be overlooked: the citizens willingness to adhere to government-imposed regulations.Reporters in China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Japan look into how these countries have weathered the crisis and largely contain the coronavirus. In South Korea, rigorous testing and state-of-the-art technology have been key in keeping the number of infections and deaths low. In Taiwan, access to masks and a sense of solidarity help to hold the virus at bay. In Japan, discipline and strict hygiene measures have allowed public life to continue without too much interruption, even in densely populated Tokyo. And in China, where the coronavirus pandemic started, quarantines, lock-down and strict surveillance have contributed to slowing spread. Whether or not these methods prove sustainable in the long run remains to be seen. But they are sending a message of hope that there may be ways out of the coronavirus crisis.-------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

How Amazon Paid $0 Federal Income Tax in 2018,News & Politics,3708376,"36,529","2,966","Amazon paid $0 in federal income taxes in 2018. On top of that, the company also received a multi-million dollar tax rebate from the federal government. How does the company do it? President Trump's tax cuts, aggressive revenue reinvestment, years of R&D, and employee stock compensation all helped. Does America have a corporate income tax problem?Amazon is one of the world's most valuable companies, valued at nearly $800 billion, and the e-commerce giant pulled in $232.9 billion in global revenue in 2018.And yet, Amazon's federal tax bill this year: $0. For the second year in a row.In fact, Amazon is actually getting a federal tax refund of $129 million this year, due in part to a combination of tax credits and deductions. This is despite the fact that Amazon nearly doubled its taxable income in 2018 to $11.2 billion, from $5.6 billion a year earlier.In other words, Amazon is basically paying a -1 percent federal income tax rate this year after reportedly paying a federal rate of more than 11 percent between 2011 and 2016, according to The Week.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has criticized Amazon in the past for not paying higher federal taxes, took to Twitter to point out that any Amazon Prime member paid more for that program's annual fee ($119) than the company paid in federal taxes. Prime has 100 million subscribers.""Amazon pays all the taxes we are required to pay in the U.S. and every country where we operate, including paying $2.6 billion in corporate tax and reporting $3.4 billion in tax expense over the last three years,"" an Amazon spokesperson said in a statement provided to CNBC Make It.Amazon reported its sizable federal refund in a recent corporate filing for the company's fourth-quarter earnings report. However, Amazon also notes in that filing that it will pay $756 million in total taxes this year, between state and international taxes.A report this week from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, or ITEP, a nonpartisan and nonprofit tax policy think tank, pointed out the fact that Amazon will not pay federal taxes for the second year in a row. In fact, last year, Amazon received an even larger refund, getting $137 million from the federal government.» Subscribe to CNBC: http://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: http://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: http://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

SUPERHOUSE - architecture & interiors beyond the everyday,Education,546616,"2,795",158,"Karen McCartney highlights some of the world’s most interesting living spaces and awe‑inspiring homes –A super house is one that delivers a 360-degree completeness of form, its exterior and interior have a seamless execution and above all else it is awe-inspiring. This quality can be elicited from the perfection of its natural setting, a remarkable use of materials, an exceptional level of craft, groundbreaking innovation or a use of space that lifts the spirit.The criteria for what makes a house ‘super’ is highly personal and hence is different for every person.  Super is not about size or scale, it is about homes that are imbued with a quality that money alone can’t buy.  To some people it might be a humble shack with all pretence stripped away, to someone else it can be about the relationship with nature and the manmade controls that facilitate that experience. This exhibition provokes thought, both about ways of 'living beyond the everyday', and also what 'Superhouse' means to you.",PT44M42S,2016-04-20,2016-04-20,155521,Sydney Living Museums,/channel/UCLjeUPvTffpHRH3CP1_yddA,UCLjeUPvTffpHRH3CP1_yddA,19,PF138UtwRCA

He provides unique insight about the actions the new administration is quietly approving without drawing the attention of the Washington press corps, and examines phenomena the mainstream press stopped covering years ago. Join Johnston for a deep exposition of the workings of federal government agencies as they affect the lives of all Americans: from our wallets, to our health care, to our safety.David Cay Johnston is a journalist, author, and winner of the 2001 Pulitzer Prize for Beat Reporting. He has chronicled Donald Trump’s conduct in his books: Temples of Chance and the New York Times bestseller The Making of Donald Trump.

"Thomas Sowell is Back Again to Discuss His Book Wealth, Poverty, and Politics",News & Politics,217512,"4,803",106,"Recorded on September 8, 2016Hoover Institution fellow Thomas Sowell discusses inequality and how it is part of the human condition. Sowell notes that political and ideological struggles have led to a dangerous confusion about income inequality in America. We cannot properly understand inequality if we focus on the distribution of wealth and ignore wealth production factors such as geography, demography, and culture. What is important is not inequality but human capital; once human capital is unleashed it creates an enormous amount of wealth for people of all classes. In addition there needs to be a sense of humility and gratitude for the generations that have gone before us for the prosperity we have today.Interested in more of Uncommon Knowledge content?

"Learn British accents and dialects – Cockney, RP, Northern, and more!",Education,4747111,"144,990","2,710","Did you know that there are over 30 different English accents in England alone? And that's not all. Would you believe there are over a hundred different English dialects accross the world? In this lesson, I will tell you about some common British accents you might hear. You'll hear examples of Cockney, RP, Estuary, Northern, Scottish, Welsh, and many more accents. Don't miss this opportunity to add some spice to your English pronunciation and comprehension! Take the quiz at http://www.engvid.com/learn-british-a...TRANSCRIPTHi. I'm Gill at www.engvid.com, and today's lesson is about accents in the U.K. So, U.K. accents and also dialects. Okay, so what's the difference between an accent and a dialect? Right. Well, an accent, as you know, is to do with pronunciation, how you pronounce the word. Dialect is when you have a word that only people in a certain area of the country use; it's not a national word, it's a local word that maybe people from other parts of the country, they won't even know what it means, so that's dialect. Okay. So, let's just have a look through some of the accents that we have in the U.K.The one that you're probably learning as you're learning to pronounce English words is RP. ""RP"" stands for ""Received Pronunciation"". It's a slightly strange term. ""Received"" where do you receive it from? Well, maybe you receive it from your teacher. This is how to say this word. It's a slightly strange expression, but RP, it's usually referred to by the initials. And it's the kind of accent you will hear if you're watching BBC Television programs or listening to BBC Radio. Not everybody on the BBC speaks with an RP accent. The news readers tend to be RP speakers, but not always. But the strange thing is that in this country, only a very small percentage of people do speak with this accent. Apparently, just 3%, but they tend to be people in positions of power, authority, responsibility. They probably earn a lot of money. They live in big houses. You know the idea. So, people like the Prime Minster, at the moment David Cameron, he went to a private school, he went to university, Oxford, so people who have been to Oxford and Cambridge Universities often speak in RP, even if they didn't speak in RP before they went to Oxford or Cambridge, they often change their accent while they are there because of the big influence of their surroundings and the people that they're meeting. So that's RP. It's a very clear accent. So, it's probably a good idea to either learn to speak English with an RP accent, or you may be learning with an American accent, a Canadian accent, all of those accents are very clear. Okay. And being clear is the most important thing.Okay, so moving on. RP, as I should have said, is mostly in the south of the country; London and the south. So, also ""Cockney"" and ""Estuary English"" are in the south. Okay. So, Cockney is the local London accent, and it tends to spread further out to places like Kent, Essex, other places like that. Surrey. There's a newer version of Cockney called ""Estuary English"". If you think an estuary is connected to a river, so the River Thames which flows across the country, goes quite a long way west. So anyone living along the estuary, near the river can possibly have this accent as well.So, just to give you some examples, then, of the Cockney accent, there are different features. So, one example is the ""th"" sound, as you know to make a ""th"" sound, some of you may find it difficult anyway, ""the"", when you put your tongue through your teeth, ""the"", but a Cockney person may not use the ""the"", they will use an ""f"" sound or a ""v"" sound instead, so the word ""think"", ""I think"", they would say would say instead of: ""think"", they would say it like that: ""fink"", ""fink"", and the top teeth are on the bottom lip, ""think"". And words like ""with"" that end with the ""th"", instead of ""with"", it will be ""wiv"", ""wiv"", ""wiv"". ""Are you coming wiv me?"" So that is one of the things that happens with the Cockney accent.Words like ""together"" would be ""togever"". Okay? The number ""three"", t-h-r-e-e is often pronounced ""free"": ""We have free people coming to dinner. Free people."" So, there can be confusion there, because we have the word ""free"", which has a meaning in itself, ""free"", but if you actually mean ""three"", the number three, there can be some confusion. So don't get confused by ""free people"". -""Oh, they're free? They're free to come?"" -""No, there are three of them. Three people who are free to come."" Ah, okay.",PT24M6S,2016-04-29,2016-04-29,431224,Learn English with Gill (engVid),/channel/UCzBGtBze1AIcDmRwD2ZjiAA,UCzBGtBze1AIcDmRwD2ZjiAA,19,nDdRHWHzwR4

These are not UFOs, they’re not alien craft from another planet, these are machines developed and built by human engineers and designers.  Today’s science fiction will become tomorrow’s reality.  These are the aircraft of the future!What you’re about to see is a glimpse into the future of aviation.  Winged aircraft as we know them will soon be a thing of the past.  Across the world designers are racing to create fantastic new aircraft that can fly humans higher, faster, and further than ever before.  New military designs, airliners that can take us to the edge of space and around the planet in minutes, and new propulsion systems that will make the jet engine obsolete forever.One casualty of this race for the future sits abandoned on an airfield, this fighter was more advanced than aircraft in service, but was already obsolete.  It was the loser in the engineering competition of the century.  In 1985 the United States Air Force demanded a new fighter plane, one that would incorporate the most up-to-date advances in stealth and agility.  Two multibillion dollar designs by rival companies took to the air in a fight to the death.  One was the Northrop YF-23, it had diamond shaped wings.  The other was the Lockheed YF-22.  The winner would become the backbone of the US Air Force, the loser a billion dollar pile of scrap.A fierce fight was about to take place between the two most advanced fighter aircraft ever built.  The test pilots fought to outperform each other.  But after the YF-23’s wheels touched the ground it never flew again.  With its greater performance and agility, the YF-22 was chosen to take the US Air Force into the next millennium.  It is a truly remarkable craft, it is able to reach speeds and perform manoeuvres far beyond that of the front line fighter of the time, the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle.",PT52M3S,2014-12-24,2014-12-24,343453,Naked Science,/channel/UC8JT2m0mKEgvEtie3JNKwew,UC8JT2m0mKEgvEtie3JNKwew,20,qn2x62G5GmM

Flight 103 | Al Jazeera World,News & Politics,108625,325,57,"In late December 1988 a terrorist bomb destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie and killed 270 people. Only one man, Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, a Libyan citizen, was tried and found guilty of causing the explosion. But he protested his innocence at the time of his trial in Camp Zeist in Holland in May 2000, and continued to do so up until his death in Tripoli in May 2012.For three years filmmakers working for Al Jazeera have been investigating the prosecution of al-Megrahi.Probe identifies suspects over Lockerbie bombingTwo award-winning documentaries, screened on Al Jazeera in 2011 and 2012, demonstrated that the case against him was deeply flawed and argued that a serious miscarriage of justice may have taken place.

Elon Musk says Australia’s energy emergency is easily fixable - Part one | 60 Minutes Australia,Entertainment,2179127,"18,789","1,812","It’s been a miserable few weeks for Malcolm Turnbull’s government, stalled by myriad cock-ups and controversies. But the greatest challenge it faces continues to be Australia’s crisis over energy supply and cost. Who hasn’t been shocked by a recent electricity or gas bill? And who isn’t infuriated that power prices have risen so sharply? In a country as abundant with resources as ours it defies logic that there are now some Australians who can’t even pay for the electricity or gas to cook a simple meal. While federal – and state – politicians scramble to act, Elon Musk, the American billionaire with the brilliant mind, says he wants to help. In an exclusive interview with Liz Hayes, Musk says Australia’s energy emergency is easily fixable, and his construction of the world’s largest lithium ion battery at Jamestown in South Australia is proof.Reporter: Liz HayesProducer: Grace Tobin",PT14M9S,2017-10-29,2017-10-29,343414,60 Minutes Australia,/channel/UC0L1suV8pVgO4pCAIBNGx5w,UC0L1suV8pVgO4pCAIBNGx5w,20,w7BMaG3zyVo

Being offline is the new luxury - VPRO documentary,News & Politics,69427,"1,191",44,"When have you been offline for the last time? Did you choose yourself to be offline or was internet not working? To be offline seems more and more to become a choice that we see as a luxury. Is being offline the new luxury or is it still a luxury to be online for some people?Digital networks are becoming denser and denser. We are online all the time everywhere and they are fewer places where we really can be alone. Where and when can we still disconnect? To be offline has become a luxury. Will we permanently use data or do we take back control over our connectivity? In this documentary we go on a journey to the edge of internet. To be online all the time and everywhere. It sounds great, but it has its drawbacks. As digital networks are closing in, there are fewer places to be really on your own. Being offline is becoming a luxury. Where can you be offline? We are connected to the internet even in our bedrooms. It’s the ambition of companies like Google and Facebook to connect the entire world, so that we can be online all the time and everywhere. Google has sent balloons up into the skies over Sri Lanka to provide the island state with free Wi-Fi for a month. On the ground, more and more devices communicate through the so-called Internet-of-Things. We are going to be ‘glass citizens’ in a transparent house, connected for life to a wireless intravenous drip and traced anywhere via our smartphones. What does it mean? A small but growing group of people is saying goodbye to lifetime connectability. They are researching ways to keep control. What can we learn from them about life in the digital era?

American children Danny, Hannah, Bradley, and Bri, are four of the smallest people in the world. Their syndrome is the rarest of all the 200 types of dwarfism, and is characterised by tiny stature, a high-pitched squeaky voice, and limited life expectancy. Primordial dwarfs are also the smallest of all those affected by any one of the different types of dwarfism. The syndrome is caused by a recessive gene, and all primordial dwarves are born to average-sized parents who are both carrying it. The gene is so rare it is yet to be identified.

Michael Shellenberger is co-founder and Senior Fellow at the Breakthrough Institute, where he was president from 2003 to 2015, and a co-author of the Ecomodernist Manifesto.Over the last decade, Michael and his colleagues have constructed a new paradigm that views prosperity, cheap energy and nuclear power as the keys to environmental progress. A book he co-wrote (with Ted Nordhaus) in 2007, Break Through: From the Death of Environmentalismto the Politics of Possibility, was called by Wired magazine “the best thing to happen to environmentalism since Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring,” while Time Magazine called him a “hero of the environment.” In the 1990s, he helped protect the last signi cant groves of old-growth redwoods still in private hands and bring about labor improvements to Nike factories in Asia.

Sanders & Socialism: Debate Between Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman & Socialist Economist Richard Wolff,News & Politics,650773,"19,623",860,"As Bernie Sanders’s runaway win in Nevada cements his position as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, the Democratic Party establishment and much of the mainstream media are openly expressing concern about a self-described democratic socialist leading the presidential ticket. His opponents have also attacked his ambitious agenda. Last week during the primary debate in Las Vegas, Bernie Sanders addressed misconceptions about socialism. Invoking the words of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Sanders decried what he called “socialism for the very rich, rugged individualism for the poor.”For more, we host a debate on Bernie Sanders and democratic socialism, featuring two well-known economists. Paul Krugman is a New York Times op-ed columnist and author of many books, including his latest, “Arguing with Zombies: Economics, Politics, and the Fight for a Better Future.” One of his recent columns is headlined “Bernie Sanders Isn’t a Socialist.” Richard Wolff is professor emeritus of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and visiting professor at The New School. He is the founder of Democracy at Work and hosts the weekly national television and radio program “Economic Update.” He’s the author of several books, including “Understanding Socialism.”#DemocracyNowDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

What really happens when you Die • End-of-life-phenomena | An Interview with Peter Fenwick,Education,2668593,"36,113","2,255","Peter Fenwick (born 25 May 1935) is a neuropsychiatrist and neurophysiologist who is known for his pioneering studies of end-of-life phenomena.In this interview he talks about near-death-experiences (NDE), death-bed-visitors and how we can achieve a good death.NDE research is at the cutting edge of consciousness research and offers a convincing model for the understanding of what happens when we die. Peter Fenwick describes the different transitional phases of the dying process and highlights the importance of letting go at the end of ones life.He offers fascinating insights into common phenomena at the end of life, such as premonitions, seeing a light, death-bed-visions and coincidences. In his opinion everybody should know about death and the dying process, because it is a normal part of living.Interviewer: Jens RohrbeckEditor: Werner HuemerDirector: Mehmet Yesilgöz© 2018 by thanatos.tvPLEASE SUPPORT OUR WORK WITH YOUR DONATION:ThanatosIBAN: AT13 1400 0862 1017 7770BIC: BAWAATWW",PT59M29S,2018-05-02,2018-05-02,435124,London,/results?search_query=London&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKZGQ0aHJ3dWcyRWNSbVNyVjNWbzZsbEk%253D,UCWVMHyIWEvAWv3Lc1C5icVA,20,78SkTuk8Zd4

Why US Airports Are So Bad,News & Politics,1921519,"22,362","1,018","U.S. airports, for the most part, are publicly owned and operated by either a city, a county, a state or in some cases, a public authority. But, in the face of decaying infrastructure, a handful of U.S. airports have started to abandon the public model and turned to private money to fund billion dollar projects. In 2016, New York State and the Port Authority partnered with Delta Airlines and LaGuardia Gateway Partners to completely rebuild the airport.

"""Pop-Up"" Cabin Designed to be Built in a Single Day - Ep 1",People & Blogs,2955249,"47,707","2,072","We built a lightweight DIY cabin that is designed to fit together in a single day. This makes it a great low-cost option for those wanting to build their very own cabin, especially in remote areas where it is difficult to haul in heavy materials. We used a snowmobile to transport our cabin materials to the build site, where we assembled them. Our building materials consisted of: barn boards, 2""x4"" lumber, cedar strapping, tarp, vapor barrier plastic, and screws. We built the cabin upon 3 small cedar logs, which came from a nearby fallen tree.The Pop-Up Cabin Plans (electronic file) can be purchased here:https://sowl.co/beQESo ($9 via Paypal, Credit Card, or Visa Debit)The comprehensive plans include 18 pages of step-by-step instructions, cut list, and diagrams, which show exactly how the cabin was assembled from the ground up. We strengthened the design by giving the cabin a proper base and roof, which means no gaps under the walls and no more ugly tarp. :)Special thanks to my brother who worked countless hours to professionally put these plans together, even staying up till the wee hours of the morning with me to make sure that every detail was perfect. Part of the money raised from these plans will go toward compensating him for his excellent work, and the rest will go toward supporting this channel.Episode 2 of the ""Pop-Up Cabin"" series: https://youtu.be/75PtrGYaNZoOutsider T-Shirts & More!: https://teespring.com/en-GB/stores/th...IG: https://www.instagram.com/theoutsider...Special Edition Outsider Flashlight 2300 lumen EDC: Amazon (US)- https://amzn.to/2EyKOopAmazon (UK)- https://www.amazon.co.uk/ThruNite-Cus...Amazon (Canada)- https://www.amazon.ca/ThruNite-Custom...Thrunite Website- http://www.thrunite.com/thrunite-tc15...20% off Coupon Code (Thrunite website only): 20%Equipment I use:Kerosene Lantern- https://amzn.to/2tCasqqVintage Lights, Battery Powered (similar models)- https://amzn.to/35cL5J2 & https://amzn.to/36eQpvWFolding Saw- https://amzn.to/38VXNhNCoffee Kettle- https://amzn.to/36T2NBVDewalt Cordless Drill Kit- https://amzn.to/35sdP0oTrail Cam- https://amzn.to/2Q6MD0BFiskars Axe- https://amzn.to/2EJVdhRChainsaw (Poulan)- https://amzn.to/2IP1flsChainsaw (Echo)- https://amzn.to/2VykyB2Pocket Knife- https://amzn.to/2Udm1MJFixed Blade Knife- https://amzn.to/2HnrT2iDrone- https://amzn.to/2IPucxHGoPro- https://amzn.to/2XDHReeCamcorder- https://amzn.to/2HnpLHqHeadlamp: https://amzn.to/2CyEe0uFlexible Tripod- https://amzn.to/2EIlRrj#cabin #PopUpCabin #offgrid",PT23M20S,2020-02-08,2020-02-08,355334,The Outsider,/channel/UChehL6PYmucEHUS6g2LVFGA,UChehL6PYmucEHUS6g2LVFGA,20,wfBJaE1IWH4

Charlie Munger's advice on investing and life choices that make a person wealthy,News & Politics,708567,"10,120",363,"As Berkshire's Vice Chairman, the 95-year-old Munger is Warren Buffett's right-hand man. He's also an investing legend in his own right. Munger ran a firm in the 1960s and '70s that scored returns of over 24% per year. He's here to talk about how to make investment decisions and life choices that help secure prosperity and longevity.I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to ""Influencers."" And welcome to our guest, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger. Charlie, nice to see you.CHARLIE MUNGER: Delighted to be here.ANDY SERWER: So you just had the annual meeting. And I have to ask you what your favorite moments of that were.CHARLIE MUNGER: What I like is that both the shareholders and employees of Berkshire are so extremely enthusiastic. And it's not just that they made a lot of money and have nice careers. They think they're on the right side.ANDY SERWER: And, you know, they come there to hear you guys talk all day. And--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, it's like a cult.ANDY SERWER: It's like a cult?CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.ANDY SERWER: In a good way, though?CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, a good cult. Yeah, it's a good cult.ANDY SERWER: OK. I mean, and the stuff that they hear-- some of it's new, some of it's old, and a lot of it is common sense. And you were talking a lot about--CHARLIE MUNGER: All of it is common sense.ANDY SERWER: Right.CHARLIE MUNGER: But of course, when people use the word ""common sense,"" what they mean is uncommon sense. Because the standard human condition is ignorance and stupidity. And when they say, old Joe has common sense, what they mean is he has uncommon sense.ANDY SERWER: I guess it's a bit of a misnomer then.CHARLIE MUNGER: It really is.ANDY SERWER: So, yeah, why is it that people can't think clearly about investing or decisions in their lives?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, they don't think very well about sex or gambling either. You know, I think the standard human condition has a lot of miscognition.ANDY SERWER: And there are ways to make hay of that or--CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. You take advantage of other people. You can improve your own life by eliminating your miscognitions.ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Charlie, and ask you about the US economy. And what is your take on where things are right now?CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, obviously, they're booming. But, you know, the economy sometimes booms, and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to live your life through both episodes. And our idea is we just keep swimming. And sometimes the tide is with us, and sometimes against. But we keep swimming either way.ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised by how long this expansion has lasted?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course, it's lasted a long time. But what was really remarkable is that we never printed money so much and spent it so fast and bought back so much debt, public and private. So this is total terra incognita in economics. And nobody knew for sure how it was going to work.ANDY SERWER: So was it risky then?CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course it was risky. But it worked. And I don't think they had much else that it would work. They weren't set up to do stimulus-- too much controversy. Democratic inertia is very thin. So they had to do something. And all they had left was just to print money and start buying things. And that's what they did. And it turned out to be a very wise response. And what's even more remarkable is that both Congress and the presidency and both parties made the same decision. They all cooperated. It was the last time.For more of this transcript click;https://finance.yahoo.com/news/influe...Subscribe to Yahoo Finance: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbAbout Yahoo Finance: At Yahoo Finance, you get free stock quotes, up-to-date news, portfolio management resources, international market data, social interaction and mortgage rates that help you manage your financial life.Connect with Yahoo Finance:Get the latest news: https://yhoo.it/2fGu5BbFind Yahoo Finance on Facebook: http://bit.ly/2A9u5ZqFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter: http://bit.ly/2LMgloPFollow Yahoo Finance on Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LOpNYz",PT41M42S,2019-05-09,2019-05-09,113234,Yahoo Finance,/channel/UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,20,RFxXl9eAWV4

Kristie Wolfe turns 1950s fire lookout into off-grid shelter,Howto & Style,2123931,"30,282","1,289","When Kristie Wolfe saw a fire lookout tower advertised for sale on private land, she knew she had found her next build. She had already constructed a Hawaiian treehouse and a hobbit hole getaway from the ground up and loved the idea of converting the abandoned structure into an immersive deep-forest escape.The 13 acres of forest above tiny Fernwood, Idaho (population: 684) cost her $67,000 and was her most expensive purchase, but the structure it came with has historic value: there are only about 900 lookouts still standing (at one time there were over 5,000 towers in the US). The lookout heydey was inspired by the devastating Great Fire of 1910 that burned 3,000,000 acres (12,000 km2) throughout Washington, Idaho, and Montana.Wolfe’s “Crystal Peak Lookout” was built in 1959 on Stranger Peak, WA, but in 1983 it was moved to private land in Northern Idaho where it was used as a hunting lodge. When Wolfe bought it, it had been abandoned for 25 years by all but the bushy-tailed woodrats which had inflicted their damage.Working mostly alone, Wolfe spent weeks transforming the cab into an overnight shelter with a fireplace, kitchenette and 360 degree views. The location is off-grid (the town of Fernwood doesn’t even have Internet), but a small PV setup provides enough energy for lights and to charge phones.With the help of her brother and mother, Wolfe moved an old shed down the hill (using pipes and a pulley system) and gave it a new life as a cold-water shower and sauna. Another old shed became a composting toilet.Wolfe does all the work on her properties herself - with the help of family- and never takes out loans. For the past 7 years her properties have become her full-time job. Just recently she created the Big Idaho Potato Hotel, a one room shelter carved out of a 6-ton potato (of concrete, plaster and steel) formerly used to promote the Idaho potato industry.http://tinyhouseontheprairie.net/https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/25687274On *faircompanies https://faircompanies.com/videos/kris...",PT34M28S,2019-11-17,2019-11-17,15551,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,nfx89LDqrJk

Apple architect picks a small prefab to savor CA countryside,Howto & Style,3253395,"58,753","1,626","When BJ and Danielle Siegel began planning their dream home in the hills of Sonoma County, California, they wanted something light on the land. “Sometimes when people build a house they want to express all the cool things they can get into a house and for us it was kind of the opposite,” explains BJ. “We wanted to do as little as possible and make it a comfortable place to live.”BJ, an architect who’s also head of store design for Apple, didn’t have time to babysit a build, but he was enamored by the customizable prefab design weeHouse. Created by Geoffrey Warner of St. Paul Minnesota’s Alchemy Architects, the ultra minimal design is based on a simple box with two walls of sheer windows so the landscape takes center stage. “I think a lot of people don't necessarily buy into the idea of less is more. I think a lot of people think more is more. And they add features and they add complexity and they add size and it makes them feel like they've actually gotten more and I think it's much more difficult and much harder to actually get there through doing less. That's the fun challenge.”The Siegels also realized that in the pricey San Francisco Bay Area, modular builds that could be nearly finished in a factory, were a lot cheaper and easier to construct than site-built homes.In order to create enough space for themselves and their teenage son Jules, the Siegels opted for two boxes placed at an angle from each other (to create privacy). The larger box houses the kitchen (on one wall), open dining room and a box for Jules’ bedroom (with the bathroom and shower tucked behind it). The other box is BJ and Danielle’s bedroom and bath with again a box unit in the middle that houses their closet and separates the space.“I always feel like really great architecture is like a really great poem. You have to work it work it work it, you reduce it down to the things that only say what they have to say and you get rid of everything else and that's where the sweet spot is for me.”https://www.weehouse.com/Landscape architect David Hocker: https://www.hockerdesign.com/https://faircompanies.com/videos/appl...",PT34M50S,2018-09-23,2018-09-23,15552,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,Lj10evnclNA
The Vanishing American Adult,News & Politics,562233,"13,393","1,087","Recorded on June 2, 2017Senator Benjamin Sasse joins Peter Robinson to discuss his book The Vanishing American Adult and the growing crisis in America of prolonged adolescence. Senator Sasse argues that children are growing up, entering adolescence, and becoming stuck in the transitional stage to adulthood as they fail to become financially independent from their parents. He argues that because this generation of children is growing up during a time of relative peace and prosperity, it has allowed millennials to grow up without the issues of previous generations that were raised in war time. In this era of consumption and material surplus, he argues that adolescents are leading age-segregated lives and not developing a work ethic and that both their parents have an obligation to teach their children to grow up. Furthermore, he stresses the importance of intergenerational learning by allowing children to be raised around their grandparents and other adults to help them learn that the trivial trials of youth don’t matter in the long run. Senator Sasse believes that there are certain virtues that American children have to learn  to become productive and happy adults. Part of that is by teaching children the distinction between production and consumption and how to find happiness and self-worth through jobs that make one feel like a necessary part of the company/society. This, he argues, will help raise peoples’ self-worth and lead them to happiness and fulfillment in their everyday. Senator Sasse finishes by stressing the importance of building children’s identities as readers to help foster the growth of ideas and active learning over the passive activities of sitting in front of screens. He notes that sedentary life is not fulfilling and that by encouraging people to participate in production over consumption will lead to more fulfilling lives. He ends on the optimistic note, that while our youth may still need guidance, overall America’s best days still lie ahead.For the full transcript go tohttp://www.hoover.org/research/vanish...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Primitive Bushcraft Shelter - Stone Roofed Lean-To,Entertainment,4629123,"58,219","5,337","In this video I build a permanent lean-to with a stone roof. It was built by myself with mostly young maple trees, poplar bark, flagstone and earth, all gathered from the immediate area of the building site. No outside materials were used and only 4 tools: a Cold Steel Special Forces Shovel, Cold Steel Spike Hawk, Svord Von Tempsky Bowie and a Svord Pig Sticker. During the warm months I like to stay away from water to avoid insects. This was built on one of the finger ridges of the middle ridge of the property and is nice and dry.The build took five days to complete and I stayed out there during that time period. Food consisted of a pound and a half of pemmican, half a pound of jerky and approximately 5 liters of water each day. Due to our location up in the Appalachian mountains sound travels very far and the distant train can be heard along with the occasional survey helicopter (especially during the hand drill fire)This is our first video and as our channel grows the first investment we'll make is high quality cameras, microphones and a decent computer. Until then we'll go with what we got and keep shooting.

What Retailers Like Amazon Do With Unsold Inventory,News & Politics,1153788,"14,260",535,"Every year, Amazon and other retailers end up with billions of pounds of excess, unsold inventory that they’re sending straight to landfills, or incinerating. Returns in the U.S. create more than 5 billion pounds of waste in landfills each year, and more than 15 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. The problem is only growing as Amazon leads the way in bringing more shoppers online, where the rate of returns is 25%, compared to just 9% for in-store purchases. Now, the e-commerce giant and other tech companies and retailers are increasing donation efforts and using data and A.I. to cut back on the wasted inventory clogging our landfills and our planet.» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Mathematical Challenges to Darwin’s Theory of Evolution,News & Politics,1326692,"26,191","3,299","Recorded on June 6, 2019 in Italy.To comment please go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/mathe...Based on new evidence and knowledge that functioning proteins are extremely rare, should Darwin’s theory of evolution be dismissed, dissected, developed or replaced with a theory of intelligent design?Has Darwinism really failed? Peter Robinson discusses it with David Berlinski, David Gelernter, and Stephen Meyer, who have raised doubts about Darwin’s theory in their two books and essay, respectively The Deniable Darwin, Darwin’s Doubt, and “Giving Up Darwin” (published in the Claremont Review of Books).Robinson asks them to convince him that the term “species” has not been defined by the authors to Darwin’s disadvantage. Gelernter replies to this and explains, as he expressed in his essay, that he sees Darwin’s theory as beautiful (which made it difficult for him to give it up): “Beauty is often a telltale sign of truth. Beauty is our guide to the intellectual universe—walking beside us through the uncharted wilderness, pointing us in the right direction, keeping us on track—most of the time.” Gelernter notes that there’s no reason to doubt that Darwin successfully explained the small adjustments by which an organism adapts to local circumstances: changes to fur density or wing style or beak shape. Yet there are many reasons to doubt whether Darwin can answer the hard questions and explain the big picture—not the fine-tuning of existing species but the emergence of new ones. Meyer explains Darwinism as a comprehensive synthesis, which gained popularity for its appeal. Meyer also mentions that one cannot disregard that Darwin’s book was based on the facts present in the 19th century.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

"Michael Moore on Trump, 2020 & Why “the Old, Angry White Guy” Doesn’t Represent the Working Class",News & Politics,541237,"9,048",688,"Last week on Democracy Now!, acclaimed filmmaker Michael Moore predicted Donald Trump would win-re-election if Democrats don’t choose a candidate to run against him who excites their base of voters. His comments prompted President Donald Trump to respond on Twitter, “He made [the] same prediction in 2016. Nobody ever said Michael was stupid!” But Moore’s comments went further than Trump’s tweet alluded to. He said the working class in the United States is mostly women, people of color and young people — all groups who tend to vote Democratic. Moore, who supports Bernie Sanders, said Democrats can win if they focus on these voters and on bold proposals like Medicare for All.#DemocracyNowDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

David Cay Johnston: Living In Trump's America,News & Politics,230097,"2,262",226,"While Twitter feuds and Russian hackers dominate news headlines, President Donald Trump’s administration is radically changing the policies and programs that define the American way of life. In their first year, the Trump administration’s efforts to defund Obamacare, repeal LGBT protections in the workplace, impose tax cuts and deport undocumented immigrants have significantly impacted millions of Americans, all while the mainstream media has struggled to keep up. Beyond the tweets, firings, scandals and indictments, how will Trump’s policy agenda continue to affect our daily lives?Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Cay Johnston says he has the answers. Since 1988, Johnston has been chronicling Trump’s personal life and business dealings—from his casinos to his marriages and beyond. In his new book, It’s Even Worse Than You Think, Johnston is going where the media won’t—into the weeds—to shed new light on the Trump administration’s policies and bureaucratic choices and how they will change America.

The people who run America now barely interact with it, and in his #1 New York Times, best-selling book, Ship of Fools, Carlson offers a blistering critique of our new overlords. Traditional liberals who worried about whales and defended free speech have been replaced by authoritarians who hide their hard-edged agenda behind identity politics. They’ll fleece you while lecturing you about bathrooms, plastic straws, and safe spaces.“Left and right,” Carlson says, “are no longer meaningful categories in America. The rift is between those who benefit from the status quo, and those who don’t.” Our leaders are fools, Carlson concludes, “unaware that they are captains of a sinking ship.” At this event, and in his signature fearless and witty style, he addresses the all-important question: How do we put the country back on course?About this eventhttp://www.independent.org/events/det...INDEPENDENT INSTITUTE ONLINE:FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/independentinstTWITTER: http://twitter.com/independentinstYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/user/independ...WEBSITE: http://www.independent.org",PT66M54S,2018-11-02,2018-11-02,324413,Independent Institute,/channel/UCtMWEs-0VzhOboqaGomEHuQ,UCtMWEs-0VzhOboqaGomEHuQ,20,vbv2FQ9GVUg

Couple Downsize Into Dream Off-The-Grid Tiny House,Howto & Style,4704688,"88,671","1,695","This off-the-grid tiny home on wheels is absolutely stunning. Designed to resemble a heritage style home, it’s been beautifully crafted and is packed full of clever design features. Built by husband and wife duo Cera and Oliver, this home has given the couple a brand new lease on life. If you enjoy our videos, please consider supporting us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/livingbigAfter purchasing a large home in town, Cera and Oliver found themselves in a position where they were constantly working to be able to sustain their lifestyle. With mortgage payments and home upkeep, they suddenly found themselves in a situation where they were no longer able to enjoy the things they used to love doing, such as getting out into nature and enjoying sports. That’s when the couple decided to downsize and build their dream tiny house on wheels. The style of the home was inspired by their original heritage home in Armstrong, British Columbia. The shape, materials and colour all being borrowed from their previous dream home, to create a smaller version more appropriately sized to their lifestyle. The home was designed to be completely off the grid, allowing the couple to capitalise on the fact that their home is on wheels, opening it up to a wider variety of parking spaces and potentially even allowing them to travel in their home if they chose to. With Oliver having a background in Construction, and Cera a keen eye for design, the couple decided to share their new-found love of tiny house living by starting their own tiny house building company.

"Chris Hedges, ""America: The Farewell Tour""",News & Politics,738634,"11,023","2,056","Chris Hedges, ""America: The Farewell Tour"", at Politics and Prose on 8/22/18.A longtime foreign correspondent, Hedges has reported from more than fifty countries. His latest book is a profound exploration of one of the most troubled: today’s United States. Hedges, author of American Fascists and War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning, cites the opioid crisis, the increases in gambling and magical thinking, and the explosion of xenophobia as symptoms of a society that has lost hope. He traces this disillusionment to the twin ills of a de facto corporate coup d’état and a failed democracy. The anger and frustration these have spawned helped bring Trump to power and Hedges issues a passionate call to action to reverse them.https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9...Chris Hedges is a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist who was a foreign correspondent for fifteen years for The New York Times where he served as the Middle East Bureau Chief and Balkan Bureau Chief for the paper. He previously worked overseas for The Dallas Morning News, The Christian Science Monitor, and NPR. He writes a weekly column for the online magazine Truthdig out of Los Angeles and is host of the Emmy Award­–winning RT America show On Contact. Hedges, who holds a Master of Divinity from Harvard University, is the author of the bestsellers American Fascists, Days of Destruction­, Days of Revolt, and was a National Book Critics Circle finalist for War Is a Force That Gives Us Meaning. He has taught at Columbia University, New York University, Princeton University, and the University of Toronto.

Kicking and Screaming: WSJ’s Kim Strassel on the Media vs. Trump,News & Politics,994707,"17,495","1,801","Recorded on April 9, 2020.As a columnist for the Wall Street Journal and a commentator for Fox News, Kim Strassel is a card-carrying member of the mainstream media. But Strassel is appalled by the media’s treatment of Donald Trump, and not just from journalists from the left. She describes the “resistance” in detail in her recent book, Resistance (at All Costs): How Trump Haters Are Breaking America. She and Peter Robinson discuss the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 crisis and the way the media has covered it and disseminated the information to the public. They also discuss the upcoming presidential election (yes, we are still having one) and the politics of the $2 trillion stimulus bill, with more spending on the way, and the realities of restarting the economy in a post- or partial-post-COVID-19 world. Finally, they discuss the pluses and minuses of Donald Trump’s temperament, and the possibility of something good coming from this current crisis.

Who Makes Money From Private Prisons?,News & Politics,295757,"4,244",458,"Private prisons were established during the war on drug and tough on crimes era when the US was incarcerating more people than ever. Since their establishment, activists and politicians have debated whether they should exist to begin with. Some argued they didn’t save the government the projected 20% nor were they of better quality. But they continued to grow into a billion dollar industry. Today the industry is largely dominated by two companies, geo group and CoreCivic. But in 2019, the two companies have had a tough year. From Families Belong Together protests that lead to Wall Street divesting to Democratic candidates saying that they will abolish the industry, if elected. After three decades of arguing it is morally wrong to profit from incarceration and detention, activists say this could be the beginning of the end for these companies.CORRECTION (Dec. 29, 2019): At 2:30 we misstated the operating costs of state and federal prisons.

"“Gangster in the White House”: Noam Chomsky on COVID-19, WHO, China, Gaza and Global Capitalism",News & Politics,434722,"10,077",792,"We continue our conversation with world-renowned political dissident, linguist and author Noam Chomsky. He responds to President Trump’s cuts to U.S. support for the World Health Organization and the surge in deaths in the United States to another record high, and discusses conditions in Gaza, the rise of authoritarianism around the world, and the progressive response. “This is typical behavior of autocrats and dictators. When you make colossal errors which are killing thousands of people, find somebody else to blame,” say Chomsky. “In the United States, it’s unfortunately the case, for well over a century, century and a half, that it’s always easy to blame the 'yellow peril.'”#DemocracyNowDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

Why Big Tech Wants You To Ditch Your Password,News & Politics,1269144,"19,870","1,026","The average office worker in the United States must keep track of between 20 to 40 different username and password combinations. With so many passwords to remember, many of us use the same ones over and over, or have a running list of passwords saved somewhere. Passwords are a very serious and expensive security risk. It’s why companies like Microsoft , Apple and Google are trying to reduce our dependence on them. But the question is, can these companies break our bad habits?Update (January 21, 2020): A website mentioned in this video, WeLeakInfo, was shut down by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other law enforcement agencies on Friday, Jan. 17, 2020. The site claimed to have more than 12 billion usernames and passwords from more than 10,000 data breaches.Passwords are a very serious and expensive security risk. A report by Verizon looked at 2,013 confirmed data breaches and found that 29% of those breaches involved the use of stolen credentials.Another study by the Ponemon Institute and IBM Security found that the average cost of a single data breach in the U.S. was more than $8 million. Even when passwords are not stolen, companies can lose a lot of money trying to reset them.“Our research has shown that the average fully loaded cost of a help desk call to reset a password is anywhere between $40 or $50 per call,” says Merritt Maxim, vice president and research director at Forrester.“Generally speaking, a typical employee contacts a help desk somewhere between 6 and 10 times a year on password related issues,” Maxim said. “So if you just do the simple multiplication of six to 10 times, times 50 dollars per call, times number of employees, in your organization, you’re talking significantly hundreds of thousands of dollars or even potentially millions of dollars a year.”» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassicAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

"Why I, as a black man, attend KKK rallies. | Daryl Davis | TEDxNaperville",Nonprofits & Activism,6149651,"277,932","4,658","A chance encounter with members of the Ku Klux Klan led black musician Daryl Davis on a quest to determine the source of the hate. His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.Daryl Davis graduated from Howard University with a degree in Jazz. As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley’s Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.In 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.Since his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a “certificate of friendship” from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He’s even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly’s granddaughter.Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations. He is also an actor with stage and screen credits, appearing in the critically acclaimed HBO police drama, The Wire, and most recently, as the subject of the documentary Accidental Courtesy, which filmed his real life encounters with Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leaders as he helps to dismantle racism across the United States Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations.

Filmed in Ireland, it premiered on 3 March 2013 in the United States and Canada.Vikings is inspired by the sagas of Viking Ragnar Lothbrok, one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of England and France. The show portrays Ragnar as a former farmer who rises to fame by successful raids into England, and eventually becomes king of Denmark, with the support of his family and fellow warriors: his brother Rollo, his son Bjorn Ironside, and his wives—the shieldmaiden Lagertha and the princess Aslaug.The series is inspired by the tales of the raiding, trading, and exploring Norsemen of early medieval Scandinavia. It follows the exploits of the legendary Viking chieftain Ragnar Lothbrok and his crew and family, as notably laid down in the 13th century sagas Ragnars saga Loðbrókar and Ragnarssona þáttr, as well as in Saxo Grammaticus's 12th century work Gesta Danorum. Norse legendary sagas were partially fictional tales based in Norse oral tradition, written down about 200 to 400 years after the events they describe. Further inspiration is taken from historical sources of the period, such as records of the Viking raid on Lindisfarne depicted in the second episode, or Ahmad ibn Fadlan's 10th-century account of the Volga Vikings. The series is set at the beginning of the Viking Age, marked by the Lindisfarne raid in 793",PT27M41S,2016-02-02,2016-02-02,434454,History Buffs,/channel/UCggHoXaj8BQHIiPmOxezeWA,UCggHoXaj8BQHIiPmOxezeWA,19,IBehjjt6V70

G.O.P"", at Politics and Prose.One of our top polling experts, Greenberg follows his America Ascendant, in which he illuminated the Republican Party’s decades-long fight against a secular and diverse “New America,” with an update of that cultural war based on trends from the 2016 and 2018 elections. Drawing on results from his focus groups and polls, Greenberg argues that the GOP is vulnerable on several fronts, mainly from the growing ranks of millennials and immigrants, and predicts that the losses the Party suffered in 2018 will continue in 2020. To take advantage of Trump’s alienation of blue-collar voters, however, he argues Democrats must develop robust programs for providing American workers with a level playing field.https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9...STANLEY B.

The Syphilis Enigma (Medieval Disease Documentary) | Timeline,Education,3812461,"26,751","3,296","In 1495 a new disease hit Europe. It was deadly, devastating and attacked those who were promiscuous, well-heeled and well-travelled. But what was Syphilis and where had it come from? The traditional view has been that syphilis was part of ""the Columbian exchange"" – one of the things, along with tobacco and the potato, that the New World gave the Old. Arriving in Spain in the 1490s with Columbus and his crew, this destructive new plague spread quickly across Europe, leaving no country, no city, no royal household untouched. But what if this assumption is wrong? There is evidence of syphilis in skeletons dug from sites in France, Italy and England. Bones found in a medieval graveyard in Hull show signs of the ravages of syphilis. But if syphilis was present in Europe before Columbus went to America, why was the 1495 outbreak so deadly? And why did everyone see it as an entirely new plague?Use code 'timeline' and enjoy 3 months of History Hit for $3 http://bit.ly/TimelineWatchMoreContent licensed from DRG.From the original documentary, The Syphilis Enigma.Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com",PT48M49S,2017-08-07,2017-08-07,431145,Timeline - World History Documentaries,/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg,UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg,20,2bWNF_eNwvI

Thatch Roof House: Full Bushcraft Shelter Build with Hand Tools | Saxon House,People & Blogs,4586105,"30,861","2,458","We build a bushcraft saxon house with thatch roof using just simple hand tools. Inspired by anglo saxons, this iron age bushcraft shelter was built by a father and son using natural materials found in the surrounding forest. We used spades to dig a deep pit which was to be the foundations for the bushcraft shelter. The saxons built their houses over pits so that they did not need so many materials for their roof, and also to maintain a consistent temperature inside all year round. We then added four foundation logs to form the perimeter of the house. Using a chisel, we made some simple mortise and tenon joints and built a basic post and beam timber frame structure. We used the drawknife to peel off the bark which helps prevents bugs from eating away at the wood and rotting it quicker. We burnt the ends of the posts that went in the ground using an ancient Japanese technique called Shou Sugi Ban. This helps to make the wood more rot resistant when it goes into the ground. We then made some rafters and attached these to the frame. For the walls of the house, we used hazel and birch sticks. These are flexible and bent around the upright supports. We sourced some clay and straw and mixed these together and put this on the hazel walls. This is also and ancient technique known as wattle and daub. Once the clay had set hard, we focused on building the front and rear gable ends of the bushcraft shelter. We built these with pine logs, and rather than use vertical logs we used them horizontal to make a more solid structure. This gave the appearance of a log cabin. Now that the whole frame was complete, we built the roof. For the roofing material we used water reed to thatch it. We attached the thatch using hazel spars and liggers and we lashed this to the frame.. Again, a very traditional building method. To cap the ridge off, we built a ridge roll of water reed and then used long straw to form an ""A"" shape over the ridge. This made sure that water would run off the roof and down the outside of the thatch. To make the structure warmer, we used moss to fill in the gaps in the wall logs. Later we will add clay to this to weather seal it. Once the thatch was on the roof, we dressed it smooth so water would run off easily. This was a really fun bushcraft project which I did with my Dad. We built it over the period of a few months using basic building techniques, some diy and simple hand tools such as: axe, saw, chisel, spade, auger, drawknife and a few others.

"How to Make the Best Face Mask, No Sewing (Don't use Cotton or Vac Bags!)",Comedy,526011,"16,474",537,"I spent almost a month to get this right - This face mask is the closest you can get to an N95 equivalent face mask with common materials.  No sewing, no cotton (""cloth / fabric""). This mask is a far better homemade option compared to cloth facemasks for both filtration and most importantly fitment. This can be batch made in 10 minutes and is washable / reusable. This face mask uses non-woven polypropylene and is far better than a cotton (cloth) mask or even surgical mask (which leak on the sides). Your results obviously could vary depending on materials available. It isn't a replacement to a N95 or P2 Respirator. A fit tested N95 or P2 respirator is always best however this should be preserved for health care workers.As a disclaimer though-  This video should be interpreted as theory, my own experimentation & entertainment only.

Building Amazing Homes & Mobile Spaces Using Shipping Containers!,Howto & Style,3510484,"36,173","1,353","In this video we explore and learn how to use shipping containers as strong, durable and mobile building blocks to create amazing structures of all kinds, like a house, addition, office space, or cabin; and we feature a few stunning projects to get you inspired!Anthony Ruggiero from Storstac Inc. (http://www.storstac.com/) showed us around their yard in Toronto, Ontario and took the time to teach us about the ins and outs of building with shipping containers. We're excited to share the tips and information we learned with you.Shipping containers come in standard 20 foot and 40 foot lengths, and there are other specialty custom sizes like the 10', 45', 48', 53' long containers.Almost all shipping containers are made in China, and can be bought used (after they've been used for 10-20 years), or new, which means they've one been used once.  Since there are no shipping manifests for used containers to show what was transported in them over the course of their lifetime (it could be anything from clothes to nuclear waste), it's better to build with a new shipping container that's only been used once.They're made with COR-TEN steel, which is a weathering steel that can withstand harsh weather conditions and elements like salt water because the rust on weathering steel creates a protective patina to keep it strong, whereas rust on mild steel would actually weaken the metal.While building with shipping containers is not necessarily cheaper than conventional building, it does have advantages because the containers are modular, movable and mobile, durable, and have a unique, modern look.They can be do it yourself friendly if you've worked with steel before, or if you find a company to take care of the steel work for you so you can focus on how to frame it and finish it from the inside.Let us know what you think of shipping containers as alternative building blocks in the comments!And if you're interested in learning more about Storstac and the projects they've worked on, check out the links below:Storstachttp://www.storstac.com/New Old Stock - LA Man Cavehttp://newoldstock.com/Harlem House Addition in Torontohttp://www.storstac.com/portfolio-ite...Rogers Fan Hub in Torontohttp://www.storstac.com/rogers-shippi...Thanks for watching!Mat & Danielle-------------------------------------------------------------STAY IN TOUCH!-------------------------------------------------------------Blog: www.exploringalternatives.caFacebook: /exploringalternativesblogInstagram: @exploringalternatives-------------------------------------------------------------COMMENTS-------------------------------------------------------------We want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and to contribute.

Designed in late 1970s, capable of carrying 120 tons of oversized cargo. An-124 is one of the biggest cargo aircraft in the world. It was an important means of national transport and prestige object for the Soviet Union. Fourty years later, it is still highly sought after in the transport sector.6 cockpit crew and 7 cargo loadmasters accompanied my AN-124 flight. There are built in cranes and equipments inside the aircraft for the An-124 to operate in any remote airfield without support. Watch the complex loading exercise before a flight inside the “hidden” passenger compartment of An-124. I mounted GoPro camera to capture the 6 men cockpit action during the flight. Loadmaster Vladimir explains all the characteristics and operations of the An-124.Flying on Antonov 124 is unlike any other flight experience I have in the past.

She was overweight, he thought, and thus responsible for the fact that she needed a foot amputation. But years later, Attia received an unpleasant medical surprise that led him to wonder: is our understanding of diabetes right? Could the precursors to diabetes cause obesity, and not the other way around?

Restoring a medieval tower house near Sparta as life project,Howto & Style,2086753,"36,894",899,"In 1984 when Kostas Zouvelos and his fiancé saw a for sale sign on a crumbling early 19th-century fortified tower on Greece’s Mani Peninsula, they decided to buy it and choose later what to do with it.Fortified towers are ubiquitous across Mani (Peloponnese) where a history of small - often just several family- settlements, or “xemonia” were built at key locations for self defense. The Maniots were never under Ottoman occupation like the rest of the country and they helped Greece gain independence in 1832. After the war homes and towers were abandoned in large numbers as the inhabitants of the peninsula emigrated to Athens.Zouvelos and his wife Kassiani Theodorakakou spent eight years converting their collapsing tower into a three-room guest house. So intent on assuring that the building matched the environment, they changed the mortar color three times. To create the mortar, they used a traditional technique called kourasani, using lime, local soil, river sand, ceramic powder, and a small amount of cement.Working with the building’s original footprint of 25 square meters per floor, the couple squeezed a kitchen/lobby on one and three bedrooms on the others, using space-saving features like an in-room shower, a carved-in-the-rock bed and a portable kitchen. They also created extra living spaces outdoors with a sun terrace, an infinity pool and a large patio with replanted 100-year-old olive trees.https://tainaron-blue.com/On *faircompanies: https://faircompanies.com/videos/rest...",PT28M50S,2019-02-17,2019-02-17,355232,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,A6S82xVitTw
Pythagorean home amidst olive grove offers views & protection,Howto & Style,2559154,"37,898","2,192","Asked by an Athens couple to design a home embedded in their olive grove, architect Tilemachos Andrianopoulos used geometry to respect the trees, provide protection from wind and sun, and open up the residence to the mountain views. In Alice in Wonderland fashion, the home begins small at a tip of a triangle where the walls are low. The walls grow and stretch as the home progresses uphill funneling views toward the Gerania mountains. On two sides of the triangle the only openings are slits which let in protected light and views (all other windows open out onto one of two interior courtyards. At the mountain-side of the home, the wall is nearly double the size of the smaller end, and the glass can be completely opened to let the olive trees in.In symbiosis with the local ecosystem, the home is covered in a living roof, adjusted to the Greek climatic conditions, in particular those of Attica with lavender, helichrysum, auras, drosanthemum and thyme. Inside the courtyards there is no grass, but all local plantings and walkways of rammed earth.https://www.tensearchitecture.net/On *faircompanies https://faircompanies.com/videos/pyth...",PT22M2S,2019-04-07,2019-04-07,155523,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,0fs5JxH4qJU

Box 223Adelphia, NJ 07710Follow me on Instagram @buonapetittiFAQ:Who is this lady?Gina Petitti was born in 1935 in Faeto, Italy. Her family ran a farm in Italy and she met her husband, Vito, in the same town. In 1970 Gina, Vito, and her 4 children immigrated to America. Gina’s husband passed away in 2012, but she is surrounded by a large family, which includes 9 grandchildren, and lives 5 minutes away from her eldest daughter in New Jersey. Gina spends her time cooking, gardening, and being an active member of her local Church. Where does Gina get her recipes?Most of these recipes are from what she learned growing up in Italy, but some of them have evolved over time. She has also learned new recipes from friends and family in America. She is always eager to try new things.Why does she make such large portions?When she was in Italy, she would cook and bake in such large quantities so she wouldn’t have to take time every day to make food, and instead be able to work on the farm. Many of her recipes can be cut in half or quartered if you choose to try them out!Why is no one helping her in the video?Grandma Gina doesn’t want help! Usually, it’s because we will slow her down or not do it “her way.” For the videos we only show her, but when the camera cuts we jump in and help form the cookies or prep for the next step.  Why don’t we buy her a new...?Grandma Gina has a closet and garage full of new gadgets, spoons, forks, pots, etc… but she doesn’t like them because she is used to doing it with her old tools. She has fun getting her hands dirty!Who is behind the camera?Her retired son-in-law films, her daughter helps her prep, and she usually has one or two grandkids in the kitchen.Does Gina read the comments?We print out and show her how much love she gets from all her viewers, and she is very thankful and hopes you enjoy her cooking! Your comments bring her lots of joy, laughter, and inspiration to make more videos to share with you. Thank you for watching, we hope you subscribe, and we will see you in our next video!",PT35M16S,2018-09-20,2018-09-20,325221,Buon-A-Petitti,/channel/UCQ5BnGcZx7XlkFKx8q3dsmw,UCQ5BnGcZx7XlkFKx8q3dsmw,19,OjXWVSbWBV4

We were honored to welcome keynote speaker Dennis Prager, radio talk show host and founder of PragerU. Prager's newest book, released in April 2018, is the first of his five-volume Bible commentary entitled, The Rational Bible: Exodus – God, Slavery and Freedom. While many people may think the Bible, the most influential book in world history, is outdated Prager's explanation of the Book of Exodus, the second book of the Bible, will demonstrate that the Bible is not only powerfully relevant to today's issues, but completely consistent with rational thought.Learn more about Pepperdine School of Public Policy - https://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/ Learn more about Pepperdine School of Public Policy - https://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/ Connect with Pepperdine School of Public Policy: Like us on Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/PepperdineSPP/ Follow us on Twitter - https://twitter.com/PepperdineSPP Follow us on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/pepperdinespp Learn more about Pepperdine University - https://www.pepperdine.edu/",PT86M45S,2018-12-06,2018-12-06,322154,Pepperdine School of Public Policy,/channel/UCgQ-6NUEyCaKM5YUISVbPSQ,UCgQ-6NUEyCaKM5YUISVbPSQ,20,n_FCdrnP3X8

Encountering Storm Force 10,Sports,2248944,"31,693","1,598","Hi everyone!I would never believe the most scary yet beautiful sailing experince in my 27 years of sailing would happen in the waters right outside my hometown!I want to state that I under no circumstandses encourage anyone to head out in a storm force 10. On the other hand I will say that this is an amazing way to build confidence in yourself and your yacht.But to do this you will have to trust your boat and gear 100%, and make sure she can take it. To get to that level you will have to try in more and more wind and waves and observe how the boat, and not the least yorself, copes in the different conditions. And when the day comes you will at some time man up and go for it.If you dont trust yourself and the boat, but still force yourself to try, you  will most lightly have a very frightening experience that will sit with you for a long time, maybe ruining your joy for the sport.So go prepeared.Anyway, step onboard and join me for this insane offshore rollercoaster ride!ErikT-shirts and merch: https://shop.spreadshirt.no/nbjs-factoryFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/nobullshitju...Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/erikaanderaa/Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/user?u=314665...Linkedin:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-aand...",PT23M10S,2019-09-27,2019-09-27,432315,Erik Aanderaa,/channel/UCUH6fLsV6J7WKEmf7vJKfAw,UCUH6fLsV6J7WKEmf7vJKfAw,19,VxthF9o9k0Y

My Father's Holocaust Secret,Education,477168,"4,822",284,"When Holocaust survivor Aryeh Goldberg passed away, he left his son, Tzachi, his gold Patek Phillippe watch. On opening the box, Tzachi found an old black and white photo of two women hidden behind the watch. Searching the Yad Vashem Central Database of Shoah Victim's Names for information about the two unknown women in the picture, Tzachi was astonished to discover a Page of Testimony for a woman named Chaya Holzberg Goldberg and her two daughters, signed by Tzachi's father. Further research uncovered his father’s Holocaust secret – before the War, Aryeh had been married to Chaya with whom he had two daughters, only for the girls and their mother to be cruelly murdered during the Holocaust.For more than 60 years, Yad Vashem has been working tirelessly to uncover the names of victims and their stories.

But not so Ricky Gervais. As Wooley discovered, along with the laughs this dangerously sharp comedian has the knack of being able to make people wince in agony or cringe with embarrassment at some of his observations. Ricky’s rule is there is no topic that can’t be joked about. It has landed him in plenty of trouble, but as he says, he couldn’t give a f***.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9Link to related article: https://www.9news.com.au/national/60-...For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

Breakthrough Solid State Battery - 900 Wh/L Samsung [2020],Science & Technology,1004370,"29,948",979,"Subject Zero Patreonhttps://www.patreon.com/subjectzerola... Breakthrough Solid State Battery - 900 Wh/L Samsung [2020]Samsung research was led by Yong-Gun Lee for an All-Solid-State-Battery (ASSBs). Their goal was to eliminate dendrites formation and increase coulombic efficiency. To do that they sandwiched layers of Lithium Nickel-Cobalt-Manganese-Oxide (NMC for short) mixed with a Sulfide Solid Electrolytes (SSE, show formula on screen), on top of nanocomposite-layer of Silver-Carbon.All of this is located in between a foil of Aluminum and Stainless steel as the current collectors.The idea behind this was to remove lithium foil from the mix and have all lithium atoms part of the NMC and SSE. This approach diminishes the costs of the overall battery manufacturing since handling lithium usually needs an oxygen free environment due to its high reactivity. This is important for a few reasons, in conventional lithium batteries, the anode comprised of lithium moves freely towards the positive electrode during discharge.Dendrites are formed during the charging process when lithium moves back to its initial location thanks to the free movement enabled by liquid or gel electrolyte.This is the main limiting factor of how much energy can be store in these batteries since to control this, the amount of lithium available in the system has to be caped, limiting the energy density.SourcesNature Articlehttps://www.nature.com/articles/s4156...Energy Densityhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_...Gaston Plantéhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaston_...History of batterieshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History...Lithium-ion batteryhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium...Cost of production of lithium ion batterieshttps://qnovo.com/82-the-cost-compone...",PT10M1S,2020-04-16,2020-04-16,343421,Subject Zero Science,/channel/UCRXRbi80k0_vcIfgpOSerTg,UCRXRbi80k0_vcIfgpOSerTg,20,TAFk-CebHWA

Lebanon: Sibling of Syria | Al Jazeera World,Entertainment,192828,905,104,"Syria’s conflict has been leaking out of its borders, but in few places are risks higher than in Lebanon.Divided at birth by French colonial design after World War I, both states were destined to be bound by a common fate, but over the years their relationship was to prove uneasy - like that of rival siblings.Only in 2008 did the two countries formalise diplomatic ties for the first time since both gained independence from France in the 1940s.Recounting their history, this film helps explain how Syria and Lebanon are inextricably tied together - the fate of one defining that of the other.""Lebanon has always been the entry point for any intervention in Syria’s internal affairs. During the past 40 years, we got used to hearing people rejecting the Syrian intervention in Lebanese affairs. But the truth is all the coups that took place in Syria between 1949 and 1970 had been planned in Beirut. Beirut was the starting point for the planning and the logistic support for every coup in Syria,"" says Jamal Wakim, a history professor at the Lebanese International University.This historical journey helps explain how ongoing sectarian conflict in Syria risks setting off the powder keg of Lebanon.""For the first time since 1970, when Hafez al-Assad came to power, up until now, Lebanon misses the spirit of the ‘big brother’. The oppressive spirit that also brings our people together. We can’t just wonder how the current situation in Syria would affect life in Lebanon. This is a serious issue. And we need to think more about it,"" says Nahla Chahal, a researcher and journalist.""This film looks at the history of the turbulent relationship between Syria and Lebanon - a history of sibling nations that bodes ill for the future.More from Al Jazeera World on:YouTube - http://aje.io/aljazeeraworldYTFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/AlJazeeraWorldTwitter - https://twitter.com/AlJazeera_WorldVisit our website - http://www.aljazeera.com/aljazeeraworldSubscribe to AJE on YouTube - http://aje.io/YTsubscribestory.",PT47M31S,2013-03-13,2013-03-13,431315,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,Ft0OkYSSwCA

THE BEST FALAFEL RECIPE | crispy fried and baked falafel (vegan),Howto & Style,571768,"16,624",338,"Are you ready for the best falafel you've ever tasted (whether fried or baked)? Falafel are delicious balls of chickpea and herb goodness that you find in Middle Eastern cooking.I've had my fair share of falafel on travels through Egypt, Israel and Jordan. I've had them in restaurants and on street corners (the best authentic street food). I've had them stuffed in gluten-free pita and on salads. And I've had them with slight variations and tweaks, though the recipe itself is fairly simple.But here's how you make the best falafel recipe - add tons of herbs (double the normal amount) and a small amount of green pepper. This makes for an addictive flavor that's ""a little something extra"" but not spicy. Just insanely delicious.Falafel are naturally vegan and vegetarian. You can then deep fry the falafel, pan fry or make baked falafel. It's up to you! Just don't forget to drizzle with my tahini sauce. ;) Enjoy!

This video is sponsored by SurfsharkJoin me to fly to the World's Highest Airport - Daocheng Yading Airport in China. Daocheng (DCY) airport is in the Western part of China at 4,411m (14,472 ft). Daocheng is the highest commercial airport in the world.Sichuan Airlines fly to Daocheng from Chengdu regularly on their A319. I was able to go to the cockpit to interview the captain about the difficulties of flying into this high altitude airports. The crew require to wear oxygen masks during flight critical times (takeoff/landing) at Daocheng. Currently 6 out of World's top 10 airports is in China.-----Join me for a very exciting video detailing my journey from Chengdu Airport in China to the world’s highest civilian airport, Daocheng Yading airport, in the Daocheng County of Sichuan, China with Sichuan Airlines. As you’ll see throughout the video, I am so proud to have been able to make it to this flagship airport of the world and I am not left disappointed by the stunning views offered by this remote airport, which is a staggering 4,411 metres above sea level.Daocheng Yading airport was approved for construction in April 2011 and cost $255 million to build. It was officially opened in September 2013 and made the journey between Chengdu and Daocheng much better, reducing it from a two day bus trip to a one hour aeroplane journey. The airport features a single runway 4,200 metres long and its terminal building spans over 5000 square meters, with capacity for handling 280,000 passengers a year.After a traditional and filling Chinese breakfast at Chengdu, including such delicious delicacies as duck and rabbit, and receiving a little reassurance from a Tibetan man taking the same trip (I confess, I was a little nervous regarding the potential high altitude sickness) I board the aeroplane and I discuss with the captain the serious nature of the challenges which flying to such an extreme airport poses.He tells me that the hazards posed by the airport are so serious that flights there are composed of two captains, rather than a captain and a first officer, and that only the most experienced pilots may make the journey, the airport being classified by Sichuan airlines as in the top tier of three for experience required. Although the approach to the airport is relatively straightforward, the low temperatures for much of the year (as cold as -30 degrees Celsius in winter) causes hazardous ice to appear on the runway, along with low freezing fog and thick cloud which seriously impairs visibility. Due to the altitude, both passengers and pilots have the option of breathing oxygen from bottles stored on the flight for the purpose.My flight is quite sparsely populated, with only sixty people on board – even at this time of year, at this altitude, the temperature is still too low for most tourists, although things do get busier in high summer.I am entertained by the soft, plush toys shown to me by the air stewardesses of the aeroplane and a number of pandas. Recently, Sichuan airlines have been doing a lot of panda related things. In September 2018, Sichuan airlines even launched a special “Panda Route,” which made use of an Airbus A350 covered in a cute panda livery and with air staff wearing panda themed uniforms and serving panda themed food. Look out for the air stewardess wearing a panda jumper in this video!After arriving at Daocheng Yading airport, I watch the aeroplane depart and take the time to admire the beautiful airport terminal building. From the outside, it looks very modern, almost like a UFO or spaceship and everyone looks like they’re having a great time, posing for photos by a special rock which dedicates the airport and reminds people of its altitude.It’s the best feeling to be this high up on the Earth and I am so grateful to the very kind Sichuan Airlines staff who made my journey there and back so comfortable and enjoyable. I hope you enjoyed the experience and please let me know your thoughts and comments beneath this video. Thank you very much for watching!",PT16M12S,2019-06-18,2019-06-18,343152,Sam Chui,/channel/UCfYCRj25JJQ41JGPqiqXmJw,UCfYCRj25JJQ41JGPqiqXmJw,19,2Jm6fRYwPoY

A Different Kind of Force—Policing Mental Illness | NBC Left Field,News & Politics,1259919,"25,288",948,"Law enforcement officers are increasingly the first responders to incidents involving people with mental illness. Without proper training and expertise, confrontations taking place amid an already-charged atmosphere can escalate quickly, often leading to the injury or death of the individual with mental illness. This concern and numerous high-profile police shootings involving unarmed individuals in a mental health crisis have prompted renewed debates about policing the mentally ill. In the San Antonio Police Department, a special plainclothes unit is trained specifically to handle mental health calls. For several weeks, we followed the 10-person unit to see firsthand how the program operates. One of the calls the unit received during this time was from Martha Remmey, the mother of a young man with schizophrenia who appeared unable to distinguish what was real and what wasn’t. Martha, who’s called the police on her son Christopher multiple times, is torn between wanting to get help for her son and fearing one of his confrontations with the police will turn deadly. In Houston, we meet with Marketta Thomas-Smith, who is mourning her brother Danny Ray Thomas. In March 2018, a sheriff’s deputy encountered Thomas in the middle of a Houston road. Thirty-four-year-old Thomas was unarmed and visibly in distress, walking with his pants around his ankles. But the deputy said Thomas ignored his commands and acted aggressively toward him, so he shot him once in the chest. As Marketta continues to grieve, she is also seeking justice for her brother.

🇦🇲 Armenia: Common Pain | Al Jazeera World,Entertainment,20619,170,79,"Every year on April 24, Armenians around the world commemorate the anniversary of what they claim to be genocide.But 100 years after the events of 1915, the use of the word ""genocide"" to describe what happened to the Armenians at the hands of the Turks remains a contentious political issue.Turkey vehemently rejects genocide claims. It admits that atrocities were committed but argues that there was no systematic attempt to destroy the Armenian people. It claims the Armenians were casualties of World War I and that many people died amid the chaos of a war in which all sides suffered.The true number of Armenians that were killed or died in 1915 and 1916 remains a topic of heated debate. The Armenians say the number stands at 1.5 million. Turkey says that is grossly inflated and estimates the total to be about 300,000.'A history of co-existence' For many, this issue has come to overshadow what Stepan Grigoryan from the Analytical Centre on Globalisation and Regional Cooperation describes as ""a history of co-existence between Turks and Armenians"".After conquering Constantinople in 1453, the young Ottoman sultan Mehmet the Second brought in large numbers of Armenians from Anatolia to settle in the newly-won city.Over the centuries, they came to hold positions at all levels of the Ottoman state apparatus - as state ministers, advisers, tax collectors and even doctors in the sultan's palace. They excelled in trade and the crafts and helped construct many of the buildings and monuments that came to symbolise the splendour of Ottoman architecture. The Armenians became an important and recognised community within the Ottoman Empire.But by the 1880s, a growing nationalist sentiment had emerged among Armenians, particularly intellectuals, with calls for the creation of a free, independent and united Armenia. The first Armenian political organisations were born.Shortly after, Sultan Abdul Hamid the Second created an armed band of Kurdish tribal warriors, the Hamidiya Brigade, who raided and looted Armenian towns and villages.""Because of the hopeless situation Sultan Abdul Hamid became a despot. He used innovative measures but he also lived with great paranoia,"" explains Pakrat Estukyan, the editor of Agos, an Armenian weekly newspaper published in Istanbul. ""In 1895 the Hamidiya Brigades were established and Kurds were used in suppressing Armenians. Armenians suffered great trauma because of this.""A splintering empireThe dissolution of the Ottoman Empire accelerated during the early 20th century. In 1911, it lost Libya to Italy and in 1912, it lost the Balkans War - and with it most of its Balkan territories. The empire was splintering apart. And then - in 1914 - World War I started.In October 1914, Ottoman Turkey entered on the side of Germany.The Turks were concerned that the Armenians - pursuing their goal of establishing an Armenian homeland - would help the Russians. On November 1, 1914 the Russian army began a multi-pronged invasion of the Ottoman Empire from the Caucasus. Many Armenian volunteers joined the ranks of the Russian army. The Caucasus - the eastern front of the Ottoman Empire - became a key strategic war zone.To eliminate the threat of Armenians allying with the Russians, the government decided to transfer the Armenian population to other parts of the empire.""It was a time of war. And we know what happens in wars,"" says Melih Aktas from Gazi University in Ankara. ""… I think it would be wrong to judge these events as harsh or inhumane without a full knowledge of all the surrounding circumstances and the way war developed.""Social Media links:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeeraInstagram: https://instagram.com/aljazeera/?ref=...Twitter: https://twitter.com/ajenglishWebsite: http://www.aljazeera.com/google+: https://plus.google.com/+aljazeera/posts",PT47M30S,2012-05-09,2012-05-09,431314,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,19,fQ0wk_RZhbE

Heather Mac Donald On How The Delusion of Diversity Destroys Our Common Humanity,News & Politics,574391,"19,996",526,"Recorded on February 25, 2019.To comment please go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/heath...Is the dedication to diversity undermining American culture? In her book The Diversity Delusion, Heather Mac Donald argues that the focus on race and gender diversity is harming society. Mac Donald and Peter Robinson discuss how she was protested off of school campuses by students because of her ideas. They discuss the collapse of free-speech ideals on college campuses in the United States and how the dedication to diversity doesn’t extend to a diversity of thought. Mac Donald also breaks down issues of gender and racial equality. She talks about how affirmative action has not had the impact that was intended and has in fact made attending college more difficult for minorities who are accepted to schools they are not ready for. She also goes on to analyze rape culture on college campuses and posits her theories as to why discussions of sexual violence have become more prevalent now than in the past.

How else do we interpret 19 straight years of war and no end in sight? It’s part of who we are. It’s part of what the American Empire is,” says Wilkerson. “We are going to cheat and steal to do whatever it is we have to do to continue this war complex. That’s the truth of it.

First class internationally and on some key domestic routes has become a hybrid of first and business class.As of November 2019, if you wanted to book a first class round trip flight on Emirates from JFK to Dubai at the last minute it could cost you over $23,000.

Dirty Jobs' Mike Rowe on the High Cost of College (Full Interview),News & Politics,1142904,"17,642",336,"""If we are lending money that ostensibly we don't have to kids who have no hope of making it back in order to train them for jobs that clearly don't exist, I might suggest that we've gone around the bend a little bit,"" says TV personality Mike Rowe, best known as the longtime host of Discovery Channel's Dirty Jobs.""There is a real disconnect in the way that we educate vis-a-vis the opportunities that are available. You have - right now - about 3 million jobs that can't be filled,"" he says, talking about openings in traditional trades ranging from construction to welding to plumbing. ""Jobs that typically parents' don't sit down with their kids and say, 'Look, if all goes well, this is what you are going to do.'""Rowe, who once sang for the Baltimore Opera and worked as an on-air pitchman for QVC, worries that traditional K-12 education demonizes blue-collar fields that pay well and are begging for workers while insisting that everyone get a college degree. He stesses that he's ""got nothing against college"" but believes it's a huge mistake to push everyone in the same direction regardless of interest or ability. Between Mike Rowe Foundation and Profoundly Disconnected, a venture between Rowe and the heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, Rowe is hoping both to help people find new careers and publicize what he calls ""the diploma dilemma.""Rowe recently sat down with Reason's Nick Gillespie to discuss his bad experience with a high school guidance counselor (3:20), why he provides scholarships based on work ethic (6:57), the problem with taxpayer-supported college loans (8:40), why America demonizes dirty jobs (11:32), the happiest day of his life (13:14), why following your passion is terrible advice (17:05), why it's so hard to hire good people (21:04), the hidden cost of regulatory compliance (23:16), the problem with Obama's promise to create shovel ready jobs (33:05), efficiency versus effectiveness (34:17), and life after Dirty Jobs (38:24).Aprrox. 41 minutes.

Enemy of Enemies: The Rise of ISIL (P1) | Featured Documentary,News & Politics,476648,"1,975",178,"ISIL has been truly devastating to those it comes in contact with and bloody to those under its control. Its sudden rise and expansion in 2014 has perplexed many. It has humiliated its enemies, including those in Damascus, Baghdad, Tehran and Washington. Armed with extensive weaponry, boasting an international fighting force and adept in the art of digital media propaganda, the so-called Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant has become the de facto authority across an area the size of the United Kingdom. This two-part series peels back the rhetoric to examine how a volunteer organization managed to rise up from the ashes of post-invasion Iraq and defeat standing armies many times its size and capacity. How did it begin? How did it grow so astonishingly quickly? And how is it being used by global and regional powers to change the geopolitical map of the Middle East? With critical testimony from informed insiders and experts from across three continents, as well as original footage from Syria and Iraq, this series mixes documentary and discussion to unravel the interweaving nexus of events and alliances, at once aligned and conflicting, that have given rise to the world’s most notorious, and powerful, insurgent group.",PT47M30S,2015-10-18,2015-10-18,431313,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,xsHrULpYeFk

How to Fail at Almost Everything with Scott Adams,News & Politics,365511,"7,280",406,"Recorded on July 12, 2017The Dilbert comic strip artist and political philosopher Scott Adams sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss his book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. He discusses with Peter  his theory of “talent stacking,” the idea that rather than being an expert in one particular skill (i.e.,  Tiger Woods and golf), one can become successful by stacking a variety of complementary nonexpert skills. Adams demonstrates how talent stacking has been beneficial in his life because he has stacked  comic artist skills with his MBA and experience in corporate environments to create a wildly successful comic strip that resulted in spin-off books, a television series, a video game, and merchandise. His business skills gave him the tools to create a business satire comic strip and the skill set to manage the business that evolved from that  strip.  Adams also discusses how he uses his Dilbert blog to discuss his political philosophies and observations about the Trump administration. He wrote blogposts about the 2016 election and predicted that Donald Trump would win based on President Trump’s talent stack as a media mogul and businessman who had spent significant time in the public eye so  was immune to scandals and thick-skinned enough to handle what the media and other politicians would throw at him. Adams argues that President Trump is one of the best branders, influencers, and persuaders  he has ever seen, in that the president uses persuasive techniques in debates and on social media as a way to get people to do what he wants. Adams contends that President Trump’s persuasive techniques will help solve the problem of North Korea because he has already set up China to get involved by intimating that it tried and  failed. Adams believes this will cause China to get involved  to save face. Scott Adams and Peter Robinson finish by chatting about Adams’s views on the story arc of life. Adams says that  he believes he started intentionally selfish so that by the end of his life he can give away all of his wealth, knowledge, and wisdom, a process he says he has already begun. They also briefly discuss his new book, Win Bigly, about the persuasive strategies of Donald Trump. Scott Adams is releasing his new book, Win Bigly, in October 2017.For the full transcript go tohttp://www.hoover.org/research/how-fa...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

But if we don't ask ourselves what we want, there's no way we'll ever know if our dreams are possible, or what it would take to achieve them. Until recently, that was my story. I was living an amazing, beautiful life, and I didn't feel I deserved to even contemplate anything more. This talk is about why I decided to finally ask myself that question, and what happened when I did.  Although Rita Wilson is well-known as an actress and film producer, her most recent projects have all been connected to her passion for music. After achieving her dream in 2012 with the critically acclaimed album AM/FM - an intimate, elegant, and beautifully sung collection of classics from the ‘60s and ‘70s - Wilson has been focusing on a new component of her musical career as a songwriter. Recently, she has collaborated with a number of talented and successful songwriters, composing original material featured on her second album, self-titled Rita Wilson. Her new album Halfway to Home (March 2019) has a fuller sound: Southern California rock meets Nashville country, co-produced by Rita Wilson and Nathan Chapman with additional production from Ron Aniello and John Shanks. Many of the songs were co-written with an A-List group of songwriters, including Grammy winner Liz Rose, Kristian Bush of Sugarland, Mozella, Mitch Allan, and Kara DioGuardi. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Sunken greenhouse wraps home & feeds suburban antifragile co-op,Howto & Style,374425,"8,137",159,"When Richard Weaver inherited 3 acres in the center of a golf-oriented community developed by his father in Bozeman, Montana, he bucked family tradition and tore out the grass to create a self-sufficient urban farm and underground greenhouse home.He turned his father’s RV garage into an off-grid home relying on photovoltaics, rainwater and composting toilet. Attached to the home, he built a half-buried (6-feet-under) greenhouse (walipini) to use the earth’s heat to grow figs and fruits during the long Montana winters.On the land surrounding the home, garden members (open to all) farm using permaculture techniques like planting in guilds- layers of plants that support each other- to cut down on labor requirements. It’s a communal, not community, garden so instead of individual plots, garden members share the work and the crop (making it easy to take vacations or time off).Weaver believes their farm could serve as a model for others. “When NYC hit 1 million people in the mid-1800s all of their food was grown within seven miles. We have a much more severe climate than New York, but I would say we could grow a lot of our food for 100,000 people in the valley if we had these. I did a calculation once that if we had one thousand 2000-square-foot greenhouses we could produce a substantial amount of our fruit without having to truck it in. But you’d need a thousand of them so we’d need a completely different economic model than we currently have.”Beyond the benefits of fresh, local produce, the garden also builds community, or what Weaver calls a bonded tribe. “A bonded tribe being a group of people doing something to make a living together, in this case we’re growing food together, and doing that bonds people in a way that say getting together and watching football on a couch doesn’t bond people very well.”On *faircompanies https://faircompanies.com/videos/mt-p...",PT24M4S,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,15555,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,9jbLZxwWudk

Bryan gives his feelings on the abuses of power of John Brennan, James Clapper, and James Comey.

Kevin Warsh and The Long Road Back to Economic Recovery,News & Politics,203417,"2,751",259,"Recorded April 1, 2020As the COVID-19 crisis continues, Peter Robinson sat down (virtually over Zoom) with Kevin Warsh, the Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution, and a former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. They discuss the nuts and bolts of the Federal Government’s 2 Trillion dollar (and rising) recovery and aid package, why it was needed, and its chances of staving off a depression. In addition, they discuss how the government can help (and possibly hurt) both small businesses and large corporations. Finally, Kevin gives some reasons to be optimistic (in the long run at least) and makes an argument as to why the U.S. economy is well suited to make a strong recovery. Note: Kevin’s audio is not as good as we would have hoped (the hazards of producing shows under shelter at home orders). We apologize in advance for any inconvenience.

The Collapse of the American Empire - Lecture Featuring Chris Hedges,News & Politics,140353,"2,442",169,"August 29, 2018Chris Hedges, a globally-renowned Pulitzer Prize-winning author, gives us an entirely new view of a nation in crisis in his recently released book, America: The Farewell Tour, which holds both liberals and conservatives to account — as is rousingly pertinent for Canada as for the disoriented US. Beautifully written, it clarifies vividly and unforgettably the forces at play in our times.In astonishing, tough, first-hand reportage, Chris Hedges draws on stories from inside communities across America and reveals how the hurricanes of change have allowed an array of pathologies to arise: the opioid crisis, the retreat into gambling, the corporate coup d'état of government, the pornification of culture, the rise of magical thinking, the emboldening of violence and hate, the plagues of suicides, and the global upheaval caused by catastrophic climate change. These are just some of the physical manifestations of a society unravelling. Such ills presage a frightening reconfiguration of our lives--particularly in the face of our neighbour's degeneration as a world power.Donald Trump rode this disenchantment to power. Hedges – who was unsurprised by Trump's victory – shows how neither the left nor the right are addressing the systemic problems. Until the corporate coup d'état is reversed, these diseases will grow and ravage the country. A humane cry for a decent future, this remarkable book is our wake-up call to reality.For media inquiries, usage rights or other questions please contact CIGI: https://www.cigionline.org/contact/",PT93M52S,2018-08-30,2018-08-30,335513,Centre for International Governance Innovation,/channel/UC4SMSzl_jbGe7VFkoOAeRhQ,UC4SMSzl_jbGe7VFkoOAeRhQ,20,csI8JLJ15Ak

At this event, you'll learn how to:RECREATE YOURSELFYou are where you are based on the way you view money, success, relationships and yourself. In order to recreate yourself, you will need a set of tools, strategies and mindsets to help you take that quantum leap to the next level.IDENTIFY YOUR NEXT 3 MOVESYour next 3 moves may be different than someone else’s. At The Vault, we will identify your BEST next 3 moves in both your personal and business life.SCALE IN GOOD OR BAD TIMESMany know how to win during good economic times but only a few know how to win during a recession or an economic collapse. The Forbes 400 is made up of leaders who knew how to anticipate, adapt and adjust swiftly to capitalize during bad times.MESSAGE FROM PATRICK BET-DAVIDDear Entrepreneur,Over the years, many of you have asked me why I create content and openly share my strategies with you. The answer is quite simple yet emotional. Simple because I believe the strategies I share can get anyone results living in any country. Emotional because I know how close I was to giving up and just being average and ordinary. How close I was to just throwing in the towel. How close I was to believing my critics that I wasn’t good enough to compete in the market place. I never thought I would wake up one day running a financial firm with nearly 10,000 agents with Oscar De La Hoya as one of my investors. I never thought I’d create a brand called “Valuetainment” that inspires millions of Entrepreneurs around the world. I never thought I would get to a point of having billionaires, politicians, influencers and celebrities on speed dial. But something changed.I got CLEAR on what I wanted and who I wanted to be.I got CLEAR on a problem solving strategy that helped me in the war room, board room and the bedroom.I got CLEAR on effective strategies and hacks that helped me grow during good times and bad times.I got CLEAR on the type of a leader I want to be and the type of a team I want to build.This is why “The Vault” is an event you must attend in 2019. I truly believe Valuetainment will be known as the brand that inspired the next generation of great leaders, minds, innovators and Entrepreneurs around the world. I will also be unveiling the vision of Valuetainment at the conference. We are in search for leaders around the world and I can’t wait to meet many of you face to face in Dallas.Much love,Patrick Bet-David (Tweet: @patrickbetdavid)To reach the Valuetainment team you can email: marketing@patrickbetdavid.comFollow Patrick on social media:Website: http://www.patrickbetdavid.comSnapchat: betdavid19Facebook:https://www.facebook.com/PatrickBetDa...Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/patrickbetd...Twitter:https://twitter.com/patrickbetdavidLinkedin:https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-b...",PT17M9S,2019-02-05,2019-02-05,323214,Valuetainment,/channel/UCIHdDJ0tjn_3j-FS7s_X1kQ,UCIHdDJ0tjn_3j-FS7s_X1kQ,19,qqMLg0ijGBU

🇯🇴 King Hussein of Jordan: Survival of a dynasty | Al Jazeera World,Entertainment,484315,"2,192",214,"The life and struggles of King Hussein of Jordan, from the assassination of his grandfather to the rise of the PLO.This two-part series is the story of Jordan's king from 1952 to 1999, a major political figure in the cauldron of the Middle East and one whose life and career were never far from a crisis, at home and abroad. Hussein was still only fifteen when his grandfather, King Abdullah I, was shot dead by a Palestinian gunman in July 1951 with the boy by his side at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. Hussein’s father, Talal, became king but was forced to abdicate for health reasons after only a year in power, in August 1952; and the sixteen-year-old Crown Prince acceded to the throne, under a Regency Council until he came of age. He then faced a series of political crises, domestically and in his dealings with Israel. As King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, he took over the country at a time of huge uncertainty. He inherited the Anglo-Jordanian treaty with the British from his grandfather - but also had to deal with the fall-out from the 1948 war and foundation of Israel when the West Bank and East Jerusalem were annexed to Jordan, along with their Palestinian populations. Hussein’s supporters regarded him as the father of modern Jordan, the man who guided his country through dangerous times and kept the Hashemite dynasty in power at a time when the Egyptian, Iraqi and Libyan monarchies had all fallen. But Jordanian opposition parties, particularly the Communists, were against the monarchy. The communist party won a parliamentary majority in 1956 but a year later Hussein dismissed the Prime Minister, ended multi-party rule and imprisoned or exiled his opponents. During his 46-year reign, the country’s industry and infrastructure certainly grew and were modernised – and living standards and literacy among ordinary Jordanians steadily improved. But internationally he polarises opinion. In parts of the Arab world, he’s accused of selling out to the British, Americans and Israeli Zionists. His highest profile critic was arguably Egypt’s nationalist President Nasser who had himself overthrown King Faroukh. The two were often at loggerheads. Jordan joined Egypt and Syria in the Six Day War with Israel in 1967 in which Hussein lost the whole of the West Bank and saw his military decimated. He then refused to join Syria and Egypt in the retaliatory October War in 1973, even tipping off Golda Meir that an Arab attack was imminent. Hussein’s relationship with the Palestinians was also difficult. After the 1967 loss of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, they never felt he was able to protect them; and in 1970 he expelled the PLO from Jordan.  Hussein is thought to have conducted secret talks with Israel over a thirty year period, resulting in the Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace in 1994; and his relationship with Yitzhak Rabin was so close, he spoke at Rabin's funeral. His relationship with the West was also extremely close - and in 1977 the Washington Post alleged he had such strong ties with the CIA that even received a monthly salary from the agency. In February 1999, Hussein lost his seven-year battle against cancer. He was a colourful and controversial personality, a trained and daring pilot, with an eventful personal life. He had four marriages, the latter to the American-born Lisa Hallaby, Queen Noor, his wife for 21 years until his death. His critics described him as an artful opportunist, cynically shifting alliances with the sole aim of staying in power. An Israeli intelligence report once described him as a man trapped on a bridge burning at both ends, spanning a crocodile-infested river. He was certainly an arch politician who navigated the minefield of the Middle East all his political life but never lost faith in the peace process. In his last major TV interview he said he believed that peace would eventually be reached in the Arab-Israeli conflict although, of course, almost two decades later, that peace is still proving as elusive as ever.More from Al Jazeera World on:YouTube - http://aje.io/aljazeeraworldYTFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/AlJazeeraWorldTwitter - https://twitter.com/AlJazeera_WorldVisit our website - http://www.aljazeera.com/aljazeeraworldSubscribe to AJE on YouTube - http://aje.io/YTsubscribe",PT47M31S,2017-02-21,2017-02-21,431331,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,2cvmFyD2fdk

Jamal Khashoggi: The Silencing of a Journalist | Al Jazeera World,Film & Animation,158310,"1,057",99,"On October 2, 2018, Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist working in the US for the Washington Post, entered his country's consulate in Istanbul to process paperwork - and was never seen again.On the same day, a 15-man Saudi hit squad had allegedly flown to Istanbul. All the evidence points to Khashoggi's murder, suggesting that his body was first dismembered and then disposed of.The killing of the well-known journalist and critic of Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has resonated around the world, both as an attack on media freedom and as a shocking insight into the workings of a secretive and repressive regime.The horrific story has been well documented in the media but there are still pieces missing and serious questions remaining unanswered: What happened to the body? Why did two weeks pass before Turkish investigators were allowed into the consulate to examine forensic evidence? And who was ultimately responsible for the killing?Al Jazeera Arabic's Tamer Almisshal goes to Istanbul to try and find answers. He has pieced together the chronology of events - and examined the theories as to what may have happened to Khashoggi's body.In mid-March, Saudi Arabia announced it had started court proceedings against those it believes were involved. The Kingdom still refuses to agree to a UN-led investigation, and despite the volume of powerful evidence, we still don't know whether those ultimately responsible for Khashoggi's death will ever be openly held to account.- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/#AlJazeeraEnglish #JamalKhashoggi #SaudiArabia",PT48M22S,2019-03-27,2019-03-27,431354,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,snu-0lGABUI
Backyard aeroponics: self-sustaining farm for Wisconsin cold,Howto & Style,1598098,"22,543",447,"Benjamin Staffeldt grew up on a farm and works in a garden center so when he and his wife Sara moved into a rental home (a duplex), it was only natural he'd want to start farming his (shared) backyard. They began with containers and then bought a kit greenhouse to extend the growing season and were selling to local supermarkets and restaurants, but the heating bills to farm during Wisconsin winters (with temperatures as low as -70°F) was cutting sharply into their profits. They knew they had to maximize greenhouse space so they decided to grow vertical and to grow differently. They experimented with hydroponics and finally settled on aeroponics. ""So aeroponics is similar to hydroponics using water rather than soil, but it's mist,"" explains Benjamin. ""It's a mist that comes on inside the growing chamber, and it comes on every 3 minutes for 10 seconds, it's a really high oxygen water that's hitting that root. The method was actually developed and is being used by NASA because it uses so much less water and the speed of growth is much faster.""To fully customize the growing experience, they added a thermal wrap to their aeroponics towers which helps refract light to help keep the temperature stable within the grow chambers. They're now growing enough in their 10' by 12' greenhouse for farming to be Sara's full-time job.They're hoping to commercialize their hybrid system- what they call Art Garden. It's geared toward those looking to grow in a cold climate and in a small space (one unit fits into 4 square feet). This is all part of an increasingly customized growing world that Ben hopes might make farmers out of more of us.Art Garden: http://artgardenllc.wix.com/artgarden...Original story: http://faircompanies.com/videos/view/...",PT25M20S,2014-06-29,2014-06-29,155551,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,H4gsnFJRAB0

The following day, Limp Bizkit had left Australia without telling the organisers, who only discovered the band's departure through a note left at the hotel.Senior deputy state coroner Jacqueline Milledge issued a statement saying responsibility was on the Big Day Out's promoters Creative Entertainment Australia, saying there was overwhelming evidence that crowd density was dangerous when Limp Bizkit went on stage.

Vandana Shiva: We Must Fight Back Against the 1 Percent to Stop the Sixth Mass Extinction,News & Politics,270478,"10,691",267,"https://democracynow.org - New research finds at least a third of the Himalayan ice cap will melt by the end of the century due to climate change, even if the world’s most ambitious environmental reforms are implemented. A report released earlier this month by the Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment warns rising temperatures in the Himalayas could lead to mass population displacements, as well as catastrophic food and water insecurity. The glaciers are a vital water source for the 250 million people who live in the Hindu Kush Himalaya range, which spans from Afghanistan to Burma. More than a billion-and-a-half people depend on the rivers that flow from the Himalayan peaks. We speak with world-renowned environmental leader and ecologist Dr. Vandana Shiva about climate change, seed sovereignty and her new book, “Oneness vs. the 1%.” Shiva is an Indian scholar, physicist, and food sovereignty and seed freedom advocate.

It is a film adaptation of the 1986 non-fiction book Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, who co-wrote the screenplay with Scorsese. The film narrates the rise and fall of mob associate Henry Hill (the first-person narrator in the film) and his friends over a period from 1955 to 1980.Goodfellas is often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, both in the crime genre and in general. The film ranks #6 on Empire magazine's 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time. In 2000, the film was deemed ""culturally, historically, and aesthetically significant"" and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. Its content and style have been emulated in numerous other films and television shows. Scorsese followed up making this film with two more about organized crime: Casino (1995) and The Departed (2006).",PT33M45S,2016-05-18,2016-05-18,431445,History Buffs,/channel/UCggHoXaj8BQHIiPmOxezeWA,UCggHoXaj8BQHIiPmOxezeWA,19,vc4mBGIDEeU

Discrimination and Disparities with Thomas Sowell,News & Politics,212922,"5,700",136,"Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of “disparate impact” and how it disregards the American legal principle of “burden of proof.” Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like “disparate impact” fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child’s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

Still in the early stage of development, emergence theory attempts to unify, through mathematical and scientific rigor, the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and consciousness.This film is presented in layperson terms and explains basics tenets of emergence theory, quantum mechanics and digital physics in ways that are meant to be communicative and fun.

The Zapruder Film - JFK (6/7) Movie CLIP (1991) HD,Film & Animation,3868350,"21,451","1,000","JFK movie clips: http://j.mp/1uxS37KBUY THE MOVIE: http://j.mp/QTYBEsDon't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u2y6prCLIP DESCRIPTION:Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) repeatedly shows the Zapruder film in court to demonstrate the impossibility of the magic bullet theory, and cement the notion of multiple gunmen out at Daley Plaza.FILM DESCRIPTION:The November 22, 1963, assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy shocked the nation and the world. The brisk investigation of that murder conducted under the guidance of Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren distressed many observers, even though subsequent careful investigations have been unable to find much fault with the conclusions his commission drew, the central one of which was that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone. Instead of satisfying the public, one result of the Warren Commission Report was that an unimaginable number of plausible conspiracy theories were bruited about, and these have supported a sizeable publishing mini-industry ever since. In making this movie, director Oliver Stone had his pick of supposed or real investigative flaws to draw from and has constructed what some reviewers felt was one of the most compelling (and controversial) political detective thrillers ever to emerge from American cinema. Long before filming was completed, Stone was fending off heated accusations of artistic and historical irresponsibility, and these only intensified after the film was released. In the story, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) is convinced that there are some big flaws in the investigation of Oswald (Gary Oldman), and he sets out to recreate the events leading up to the assassination. Along the way, he stumbles across evidence that a great many people had reason to want to see the president killed, and he is convinced that some of them worked in concert to frame Oswald as the killer. Among the suspects are Lyndon Baines Johnson (the next president), the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Mafia. Over the course of gathering what he believes to be evidence of a conspiracy, Garrison unveils some of the grittier aspects of New Orleans society, focusing on the shady activities of local businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones). Garrison's investigations culminate in his conducting a show trial that he knows he will lose and which he is sure will ruin his career in order to get his evidence into the public record where it can't be buried again. This movie won two of the many Academy Awards for which it was nominated: one for Best Photography (Robert Richardson) and the other for Editing (Joe Hutshing).CREDITS:TM & © Warner Bros.

King Hussein of Jordan: On A Knife Edge | Al Jazeera World,Entertainment,101384,626,26,"King Hussein of Jordan: On A Knife Edge is the second of a two-part series telling the story of Jordan's King from 1952 to his death in 1999. The second half of King Hussein’s career, his relationship with Israel, the Palestinians, the Arab world and the West.  This two-part series is the story of Jordan's king from 1952 to 1999, a major political figure in the cauldron of the Middle East and one whose life and career were never far from a crisis, at home and abroad. Hussein was still only fifteen when his grandfather, King Abdullah I, was shot dead by a Palestinian gunman in July 1951 with the boy by his side at the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. His critics described him as an artful opportunist, cynically shifting alliances with the sole aim of staying in power. An Israeli intelligence report once described him as a man trapped on a bridge-burning at both ends, spanning a crocodile-infested river. He was certainly an arch politician who navigated the minefield of the Middle East all his political life but never lost faith in the peace process. In his last major TV interview he said he believed that peace would eventually be reached in the Arab-Israeli conflict although, of course, almost two decades later, that peace is still proving as elusive as ever.

Thomas Sowell on the Myths of Economic Inequality,News & Politics,1126069,"26,874",867,"Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master’s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell’s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell’s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

American Narco Written By Matthew B. Cox,Entertainment,6896,226,3,"American Narco By Matthew B. Cox Karey Lee Woosley wants to be a rock star. There’s only one small problem; between playing gigs with Creed, Three Doors Down and Lenny Kravitz, he and his best bro, Daniel Sweep, are running what the DEA described as, “the largest marijuana smuggling ring in South Florida history.”Behind the facade of the “War on Drugs” the American government makes an unscrupulous backroom deal with a ruthless Mexican drug cartel. Suddenly, their competitors are arrested or killed, wile the Sinaloa Cartel smuggles massive amounts of drugs into the United States unchecked by law enforcement.With the help of Karey and Danny’s shadowy underworld contacts, they distribute tons of marijuana and make millions. Bales of bud are seized, double-crossing associates are cooperating and the DEA is closing in on them. Big-time drug dealers by day; hard partying rockers by night.Written by Matthew B.

So what led to the murder of Watts' wife, two daughters, and unborn son?In August 2018, Chris Watts made a televised plea for the safe return of his missing wife, Shanann Watts, and their two daughters; 4-year-old Bella and 3-year-old Celeste, also known as Cece; after the three were reported missing by a family friend. Chris told Denver7 in an interview:""I hope that she's somewhere safe right now and with the kids.""Sadly, only two days after the interview, bodies thought to belong to Shanann and the children were discovered by police at Chris' former place of employment, Anadarko Petroleum Company. Bella and Celeste's remains were reportedly located in crude oil tanks, while Shanann, who was 15 weeks pregnant, was found in a shallow grave on the property. Chris was arrested one day before the remains were recovered, and he confessed to killing Shannan in anger after allegedly witnessing her strangle their two kids.

50 years off-grid: architect-maker paradise amid NorCal redwoods,Howto & Style,1312259,"44,666",490,"In 1968, Charles Bello and his wife, Vanna Rae, moved onto 240 acres of redwood forest looking to live a simpler life off the land. They had spent their savings to purchase the land so they got to work building their home themselves. Their first structure was a panelized A-frame that they erected in 5 days (with help from a couple family members). Total cost was $2,800.The property is a half-hour drive down a dirt road and it was bare land when they arrived so Charles and Vanna Rae built their own infrastructure: roads, bridges and went decades without refrigeration nor phone (they eventually installed PV panels and cabling for phone lines). After 15 years in the A-frame, they built a cabin in the woods and there they lived for a decade until the trees began to block out their views. In 1991 Charles (who once apprenticed under famed architect Richard Neutra) designed the Parabolic Glass House. With a curvilinear wood roof and two curved walls of windows, the home feels enveloped in trees.Charles and Vanna Rae built it for $8,500 with timber they milled themselves, using salvaged materials for everything from doorknobs to stoves. The couple relied on photovoltaics, solar thermal and gas for power and a dug-in greenhouse attached to the home provided much of their food. By canning and preserving, they could go for months without going to a grocery store. Their two boys were homeschooled. The couple supported themselves selling Christmas trees.Nearly all the old growth trees on the property were logged in the early 20th century, but Charles has spent the past half century restoring the land. He and his wife set up the Redwood Forest Institute in 1997 to manage and preserve the forest. He has carefully selected 1,000 trees to be preserved for 2 millenia as the next generation of old growth.Now, 87 years old and a widower, Charles is determined to find successors; he hopes to find three couples who want to settle on the property (currently worth about 4-6 million dollars) in exchange for continuing as stewards of the land. He is currently building glamping guest houses that he hopes will help fund the enterprise. His website now advertises “seeking caretaker ASAP”, someone “wanting to get away from it all and live a more simple down to earth lifestyle”.http://savetrees.org/seeking_caretake...",PT47M29S,2020-04-26,2020-04-26,112555,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,2qcsWajivnI

Idaho modern oldtimer builds underground & solar $50 houses,Howto & Style,4312347,"40,779","1,750","Mike Oehler lived for over 30 years in an underground home that he built for $50 (and expanded for $500) on his land in Northern Idaho near the Canadian border. Now in his seventies his arthritis keeps him from hiking up to his home, but he continues to “write and proselytize”In 1968 like thousands of other San Franciscans hoping to go “back to the land”, Oehler bought property and began to build a homestead. After spending a winter freezing in a small cabin, he designed a home that would use the earth as insulation. With his first attempt he fell into the easy errors of what he calls a “first thought house”: a hole cut into a hillside with south-facing windows.Gradually he began to innovate with subterranean design, creating better ways for letting light in: among them “the Hollywood Wing”, “the Royer foyer”, gables and most-importantly the “uphill patio” (which also provides space for an earth-sheltered greenhouse). He also created an inexpensive, low-tech approach to basic design with what he calls PSP or Post/shoring/polyethlene.Mike Oehler's ""$50 & Up Underground House Book"": http://www.undergroundhousing.com/",PT24M16S,2015-08-03,2015-08-03,355135,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,8B6xR3T37gI

Victor Davis Hanson on “The Case For Trump”,News & Politics,2472295,"28,566","2,095","Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump’s “personal authenticity” during the campaign and how the media has a “historical amnesia” of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump’s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn’t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California’s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that’s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

S9 E1: That Far Corner - Frank Lloyd Wright in Los Angeles,Entertainment,649757,"9,849",241,"During his time spent in Southern California in the late 1910s and early 1920s, Frank Lloyd Wright accelerated the search for L.A.'s authentic architecture that was suitable to the city's culture and landscape. Writer/Director Chris Hawthorne, architecture critic for the Los Angeles Times, explores the houses the legendary architect built in Los Angeles. The documentary also delves into the critic's provocative theory that these homes were also a means of artistic catharsis for Wright, who was recovering from a violent tragic episode in his life.Want to learn more?

Box 223Adelphia, NJ 07710Follow me on Instagram @buonapetittiFAQ:Who is this lady?Gina Petitti was born in 1935 in Faeto, Italy. Her family ran a farm in Italy and she met her husband, Vito, in the same town. In 1970 Gina, Vito, and her 4 children immigrated to America. Gina’s husband passed away in 2012, but she is surrounded by a large family, which includes 9 grandchildren, and lives 5 minutes away from her eldest daughter in New Jersey. Gina spends her time cooking, gardening, and being an active member of her local Church. Where does Gina get her recipes?Most of these recipes are from what she learned growing up in Italy, but some of them have evolved over time. She has also learned new recipes from friends and family in America. She is always eager to try new things.Why does she make such large portions?When she was in Italy, she would cook and bake in such large quantities so she wouldn’t have to take time every day to make food, and instead be able to work on the farm. Many of her recipes can be cut in half or quartered if you choose to try them out!Why is no one helping her in the video?Grandma Gina doesn’t want help! Usually, it’s because we will slow her down or not do it “her way.” For the videos we only show her, but when the camera cuts we jump in and help form the cookies or prep for the next step.  Why don’t we buy her a new...?Grandma Gina has a closet and garage full of new gadgets, spoons, forks, pots, etc… but she doesn’t like them because she is used to doing it with her old tools. She has fun getting her hands dirty!Who is behind the camera?Her retired son-in-law films, her daughter helps her prep, and she usually has one or two grandkids in the kitchen.Does Gina read the comments?We print out and show her how much love she gets from all her viewers, and she is very thankful and hopes you enjoy her cooking! Your comments bring her lots of joy, laughter, and inspiration to make more videos to share with you.

How To Disinfect Your N95 Mask at Home,People & Blogs,159529,"2,673",211,"Join Dr. Van Dyken and Russell as they discuss the BEST WAY to clean your N-95 or high quality filter mask at home. -to skip directly to instructions, fast forward to 6m30s. :)___________________________________________Here is what you will need: A ziplock container - the 1.25 quart sizea convection oven….with no direct line of sight to any radiative heat sources which would cause potential damage the maskA paper towelWaterAn eyedropperPreheat your oven to 85degrees Celsius, or 185 degrees Farenheight. Place the mask inside the container, face down. Cut a 2.5 x 2.5 inch square of paper towel and place it in the container alongside the maskDrop 500µL, which is 10 drops of water onto the paper towel. Then place the lid on the container tight. Place the container inside the preheated convection oven which is set at 85 degrees Celsius, or 185 degrees Farenheight. Let it disinfect for 40 minutes. Take it out - open the lid and rotate it 45 degrees. This will allow air to naturally flow around the mask and dry it out. You only have to do this for 5 minutes.  After that, your mask is safe to reuse.___________________________________________________________Other videos we made on masks:Filter Mask Tutorial: https://youtu.be/X7IP4ydGE0AA Surgeon's perspective on masks for all: https://youtu.be/IKmsqn0cOjIHow to wear a mask: https://youtu.be/0LfZo-IPX-I___________________________________________________________References:- 3M white paper: https://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/1...- N 95 Disinfection Papers:https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.11...- https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.11...- https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.11...__________________________________________________________ Ideally, an N95 or similar mask is designed to only be worn once.  It should then be discarded. That is a no brainer and that’s what we did pre-covid. Now there is a global shortage of masks. How can we decontaminate these masks and still keep them safe and working properly?3M, one of the main US manufacturers of N95, has published a white paper, in which they list four criteria that must be met in order for their masks to be reused: To Inactivate SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19Not damage the respirators filtrationNot affect the respirators fitBe safe for the person wearing the respirator. In other words - it can’t have any harmful off-gassing from the treatment. 3M is very clear in that they DO NOT recommend reuse or decontamination of their masks, stating that NO METHOD achieves ALL of these goals.That being said, we are in a pandemic, and we have to make do. So, what is the best method of decontaminating our N 95? So while the maker of N95s do NOT recommend reuse or sterilization of their respirators, we are critically short these masks worldwide. We have to compromise, which is a whole different issue. We are really just trying to do the best we can do with what we have - which is sad but true. The CDC has issued some guidance regarding a few methods of decontamination.Some methods, like vaporized hydrogen peroxide can only be done in hospitals or other large institutions that have access to the materials and the required equipment. Please don't try to make vaporized hydrogen peroxide at home - it's actually really dangerous and it can become explosive. UVC light has its own hazards. It is currently difficult to get a UVC machine and, even if you have one, the disinfection parameters are very specific. Then - other methods are just not good for you, they are toxic. Things like a diluted bleach solution are not a good idea. While the solution will disinfect the mask - it will also leave a residual toxic gas that you will be breathing in. So - that leaves alcohol, steam and dry heat. After reviewing multiple studies, we feel that dry heat or heat with a very specific humidity, is the way to go. Using dry heat will make the mask last longer however heat with a specific humidity is better at deactivating SARS COV2So - back to the protocol we suggest. SEE ABOVE FOR PROTOCOL. So there you have it, what we feel is the safest and most effective way to disinfect your N 95 or Home made quality filter mask. Let us know in the comments below what you think of this video.

Videos are focused on primitive skills, rewilding, tracking and nature awareness, living off the land, off grid living, indigenous skills, shelter building, primitive fire, water purification, trapping, hunting, bow making, flint knapping, primitive pottery,  basketry, edible and medicinal plant preparation and numerous indigenous skills.     I began studying wilderness survival when I was 17 in order to have the ability to spend extensive periods of time in nature, seeking out empowerment without the need for external sources.  I began studying in 1993 under Tom Brown Jr eventually teaching for Tracker Inc.  I sought-out every old Native American teacher I could and eventually traveled the world living in very remote indigenous villages in the Amazon, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Peru.  My school teaches survival and primitive skills, nature awareness,  how to live off the land, re-wilding and how to prepare for disasters.  I strongly believe that experiencing survival living changes the way people approach their entire lives. http://www.wildsurvivalskills.com/",PT34M7S,2016-06-22,2016-06-22,155532,Tom McElroy-Wild Survival,/channel/UC6ftIQAlFTI5Z5UyIFWYApg,UC6ftIQAlFTI5Z5UyIFWYApg,20,2cPdoqjgwfk

Viking House: Full Bushcraft Shelter Build with Hand Tools | Vikings,People & Blogs,6667203,"86,232","4,241","We build a bushcraft viking house from the viking age using hand tools only. Inspired by vikings, who were very resourceful and created buildings using the natural materials they scavenged around them. We used simple hand tools such as axe, saw, auger, drawknife, bushcraft knife and other simple tools.To begin with we cut cedar logs from trees that had been felled in the forest. We used an axe and saw to make log cabin notches and built the foundation of the viking house two logs high. We then used the hand auger to build the timber frame. This consisted of 3 large ""A"" frames. We burnt the ends of the logs in fire to evaporate any moisture and create a rot-proof layer of charred wood which will help to preserve the timber frame foundation when the poles are in the ground. We used a long cedar log as the ridge pole which sits on top of the a frame of the bushcraft shelter. The next stage was building a viking longpit or firepit. This we wanted to make as historically accurate as we could. So we dug a pit about 4 feet long and 2 feet wide. We lined the pit with large stones found in the nearby area. In order to reduce waste of any materials, we used the clay from the pit to secure the stones. We added water to the clay to make it easier to work with and we filled in the gaps between the stones. We then lit a small fire in the pit and let the clay dry out for a few days. At this point we realised we could make our job easier by building a diy saw horse. So we used the drawknife to remove bark from a log (helps to prevent rot). We used the auger to drill four holes for legs and then we made four wood pegs for the top of the saw horse. For the rafters we used more cedar logs and again burnt the ends. It is an ancient japanese technique to preserve wood which is called shou sugi ban. It was then finally time to build the roof of the house. For this, we peeled the bark off the cedar logs. We then put this on the rafters and secured it with some roofing tacks. We had to be fast when doing this, as the cedar bark shrinks and cracks when it dries. We put it on in layers like roof tiles. We built a wood ladder to get up high on the roof and secure the final bark layers. Using an axe and bushcraft, we made some wooden wedges and split a few large cedar logs. We then hewed these logs and built a raised viking bed for the inside of the house. We also made some benches to sit near the fire. At the back of the viking house, we built a folding window and support arm so that we could let light into the house and also improve the airflow. We dug an air vent too, to allow more oxygen to get to the fire. To make the shelter more secure, we built a perimeter wall use cedar posts and hazel saplings (also known as wattle wall). To help further improve the airflow inside the shelter, we cut a hole in the roof and built a ridge cap or ridge vent to act like a chimney and let the smoke out. Overall this viking house took about 10 days to build. It was in winter, so we were restricted by daylight hours. This is not a historically correct viking house. Traditional viking houses were built with large timbers that were hewn from big logs. They had large gable ends almost like log cabins and the roof was made from wood shingles. Often they looked like viking longships or longboats and had many decorative viking features. In a viking longhouse, there would be enough room for many people and animals as well. But this was our take on it. We have done a number of different camping overnight trips in this shelter. We have cooked meat over fire, had great viking feasts and spent many hours keeping warm around the firepit. I hope you enjoyed this vikings inspired bushcraft build.

🇪🇬 Egypt's Morsi: The Final Hours | Al Jazeera World,News & Politics,322132,"2,097",170,"The 2011 Arab Spring had seen the end of President Hosni Mubarak's 30-year rule and within 18 months, Mohamed Morsi had become Egypt's first democratically elected president. But after one year in office, almost weekly street protests and riots appeared to reach a climax with calls for Morsi to resign and even for the military to intervene. In July 2013, Morsi was overthrown.Al Jazeera's Jamal Elshayyal reported on events in Egypt at the time - and now reveals new exclusive evidence of top-level conspiracy, power-broking and betrayal in the turmoil that led to Morsi's last days in office.Until now, much of what took place in the final days of the Morsi presidency was known only to those who witnessed the events first hand. Of the nine men with Morsi at the time, only one is no longer in jail.In this film, Egypt's former foreign relations assistant, Khaled al-Qazzaz among others, tells the behind-the-scenes story of the Morsi presidency's final hours.Throughout 2012 and into 2013, the streets of Egypt were rocked by almost weekly protests and riots, as well as an anger and frustration that divided the nation. The people who had risen up in 2011 had seen little improvement economically and they felt that the freedom they had gained was being misused by some to create chaos. Continuous power cuts, fuel shortage and petrol queues that later were proven to have been orchestrated by the deep state, lead to a toxic mix of anger and despair among the public.But the crisis in Egypt was not limited to fuel shortages and wages, nor were they limited to the big cities. In Sinai, attacks took place against security forces by groups that few had heard of before.‎‎""President Morsi complained about interference from a certain Gulf state and told me that they had detected weapons shipments from this country to armed groups in Sinai, as well as money being sent to them,"" says Khalid al-Attiyah, Qatari minister of defence and former foreign minister. ""But he also told me he was able to negotiate with this state.""As protests continued and events unfolded, concern was expressed by world leaders. But it seemed Morsi's fate had already been sealed.""‎‎From what I know, senior US government officials by that juncture June 25, 2013, were aware of the possibility of a military coup against Morsi,""‎‎ ‎‎according to Andrew Miller, US National Security Council (2014-2017).Days after Morsi's June 26 speech, in which he attempted to pacify the population and offered several concessions to the opposition, his minister of defence General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued him with an ultimatum either to step down or face military intervention. ""‎‎By the time that the military issued a 48-hour ultimatum, I think the overwhelming view in the US government was that it was too late. ‎‎That the die had already been cast, and no matter what happened short of Morsi resigning preemptively, that the military was going to forcibly remove him from the position of the presidency,"" explains Miller.‎‎ President Morsi was overthrown on July 3, 2013, and initially placed under house arrest where he was held incommunicado.Khalid al-Qazzaz, the presidential secretary for foreign affairs, recounts his last meetings with Morsi: ""On the morning of July 4, we were allowed to have breakfast with the president. We found him to be surprisingly calm. He said it was the first time he'd been able to sleep for consecutive hours since he'd assumed responsibility.""""It was clear he'd done his utmost to preserve the gains of the revolution and protect the Egyptian people. It was now up to the people either to choose to return to a police state or try to restore their revolution.""Mohamed Morsi's one-year presidency was troubled from the start by a country still divided after the 2011 revolution and by forces at work within the so-called ""deep state"" - which combined to bring about his ""final hours"".- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/#AlJazeeraEnglish #AlJazeeraWorld #Morsi",PT47M26S,2019-03-19,2019-03-19,431334,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,BIlbZO2Gu9U

"Rob Reich, ""Just Giving"" (with Jane Mayer)",News & Politics,1262,29,1,"Rob Reich discusses his book, ""Just Giving"", at Politics and Prose.Though acts of charity seem to have the moral high ground, Reich’s critique of philanthropy as it’s practiced under the current tax code finds it a threat to the public interest. Big Philanthropy allows the affluent and their foundations to use private assets to influence public policy—an act of power that’s largely unaccountable and that channels resources into pet projects and away from democratically agreed goals. Reich, a professor of political science at Stanford and director of Stanford’s McCoy Center of Ethics in Society, argues that charitable giving can serve the greater good if individual philanthropy is differentiated from private foundations, with the former supporting public resources such as education, science, and the arts, while the latter pursues innovations that enhance democratic experimentalism. Reich is in conversation with Jane Mayer, author of Dark Money.https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9...Founded by Carla Cohen and Barbara Meade in 1984, Politics and Prose Bookstore is Washington, D.C.'s premier independent bookstore and cultural hub, a gathering place for people interested in reading and discussing books.

Uncommon Knowledge with David Berlinski on “The Deniable Darwin”,News & Politics,277791,"5,411",495,"Recorded on June 3, 2019 in Italy. To comment please go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/uncom...Is Charles Darwin’s theory fundamentally deficient? David Berlinski makes his case, noting that most species enter the evolutionary order fully formed and then depart unchanged. Where there should be evolution, there is stasis. So, was Darwin wrong?David Berlinski is a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture, a contributing editor at Inference: International Review of Science, and author of many books. Berlinski discusses his book The Deniable Darwin and lays out how Charles Darwin has failed to explain the origin of species through his theory of evolution.Berlinski explains that change in biology is not continuous—it’s radical, something which Darwinian theory fails to explain. He discusses how Darwinian evolution is blind to the future as there is no fidelity to the facts. He gives examples of amino acids and dogs and explains why there cannot be just one species. He further strengthens his statement by saying that everything cannot be accounted for as being random: there should be some scientific evidence to support it.Berlinski responds to Peter Robinson’s question about Razib Khan’s statement to the effect that, “The seeds of both tyranny and democracy were sown by the evolutionary pressures that shaped humans over millions of years.” He argues that the deepest aspects of our nature are not formed by evolutionary pressures because evolution is relatively neutral. He also replies to Robinson’s  question about a remark of Pope Benedict XVI to the effect that Western thought, by its very nature, “excludes the question of God, making it appear an unscientific or pre-scientific question.” He explains that it is not right to argue that physical theories imply that the conclusion is antitheist, as mere exclusion in these theories does not imply that.Robinson further asks Berlinski’s views about the growing population of Islam and decreasing population of Europeans in Europe. Berlinski explains that Muslims take religion seriously, but theology/religion has more or less disappeared from the Western habit of thought. He states that faith and religion should come together.Berlinski further talks about how Albert Einstein’s comments disprove God, not because he is an antitheist, but because Einstein wanted to push quantum theory and his belief in the rational universe.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Can You Tell Them Apart? UK’s Only Identical Quadruplets | Four of a Kind,People & Blogs,2986571,"38,292",788,"SUBSCRIBE to Origin: https://tinyurl.com/y8v4u288Have you ever had to write your child’s initials on them to remember which one was which? The Carles’ household is home to four girls who are 4 of a kind but who also beat the odds of 64 million to one to survive. Ellie, Georgina, Jessica and Holly are Britain’s only identical quadruplets and their mum Julie was only the 27th woman in the world to conceive monochorionic quads naturally. The girls are so alike that for the first year Julie and her husband Jose had to write the babies’ initials on their feet in permanent marker to tell them apart, and Jose sometimes still struggles to know who is who… it probably doesn’t help that Mum dresses them all the same.Until now, the girls didn’t have much contact with life outside of their family. They are all each other’s best friends and work like a little mischief making machine, an inseparable unit working as one. But that’s all about to change as the girls start their first year of primary school. This documentary will follow their journey during their first year at school as they cause a lot of confusion and sometimes hostility wherever they go. With identical strawberry blonde corkscrew curls, the same faces and heights – they are impossible to tell apart and people often stare and ask some quite blunt questions about what it’s like to bring up four of a kind. This documentary will aim to answer these questions and also give insight into the uniqueness of identical quadruples. How identical are they really?#Monochorionic #QuadrupletsContent licensed from All3Media.

JFK (7/7) Movie CLIP - The Truth (1991) HD,Film & Animation,426212,"2,102",65,"JFK movie clips: http://j.mp/1uxS37KBUY THE MOVIE: http://j.mp/QTYBEsDon't miss the HOTTEST NEW TRAILERS: http://bit.ly/1u2y6prCLIP DESCRIPTION:Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) gives an emotional closing argument to the jury about the importance of truth within the government.FILM DESCRIPTION:The November 22, 1963, assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy shocked the nation and the world. The brisk investigation of that murder conducted under the guidance of Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren distressed many observers, even though subsequent careful investigations have been unable to find much fault with the conclusions his commission drew, the central one of which was that the assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, acted alone. Instead of satisfying the public, one result of the Warren Commission Report was that an unimaginable number of plausible conspiracy theories were bruited about, and these have supported a sizeable publishing mini-industry ever since. In making this movie, director Oliver Stone had his pick of supposed or real investigative flaws to draw from and has constructed what some reviewers felt was one of the most compelling (and controversial) political detective thrillers ever to emerge from American cinema. Long before filming was completed, Stone was fending off heated accusations of artistic and historical irresponsibility, and these only intensified after the film was released. In the story, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) is convinced that there are some big flaws in the investigation of Oswald (Gary Oldman), and he sets out to recreate the events leading up to the assassination. Along the way, he stumbles across evidence that a great many people had reason to want to see the president killed, and he is convinced that some of them worked in concert to frame Oswald as the killer. Among the suspects are Lyndon Baines Johnson (the next president), the CIA, J. Edgar Hoover, and the Mafia. Over the course of gathering what he believes to be evidence of a conspiracy, Garrison unveils some of the grittier aspects of New Orleans society, focusing on the shady activities of local businessman Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones). Garrison's investigations culminate in his conducting a show trial that he knows he will lose and which he is sure will ruin his career in order to get his evidence into the public record where it can't be buried again. This movie won two of the many Academy Awards for which it was nominated: one for Best Photography (Robert Richardson) and the other for Editing (Joe Hutshing).CREDITS:TM & © Warner Bros.

The High Cost of Good Intentions Featuring John Cogan,News & Politics,45155,848,50,"Recorded on October 24, 2017How old are entitlement programs in the United States? Entitlement programs are as old as the Republic, according to John Cogan, former deputy director of the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and a Hoover Institution senior fellow. Cogan joins Peter Robinson to discuss his latest book, The High Cost of Good Intentions,on the necessity for entitlement reform in the United States. Currently there are a bevy of entitlement programs in the United States, each costing a large percentage of the federal budget each year. These programs are open-ended and hard to estimate into the budget because people with the average number of benefits vary greatly from year to year. These programs have become complex and bloated over the many years since they’ve been instated and are in dire need of reform. According to John Cogan, entitlement programs such as pensions, Medicaid, and Social Security have been a part of US history since the Revolutionary War when Congress first created pensions for all the soldiers who had served the Republic during the war. Congress then went on to expand entitlement programs after the Civil War to include soldiers who had fought in the war. Entitlements remained restricted to only those who had served the Republic until the New Deal when entitlements were extended to all citizens above a certain age (Social Security). This was the first time that entitlements were given to citizens who had not served. This was also the first time that entitlements were granted to everyone until the end of time.

How Airplane Food is Made? Inside Gate Gourmet Kitchen,Travel & Events,1481210,"20,722",639,"8am in the morning, the daily Singapore Airlines A380 just arrived in Zurich. I was filming the busy unloading and loading catering into the plane. They have only 1 hour to finish loading and cleaning of the SuperJumbo jet.Then I was given a backstage tour inside Gate Gourmet flight kitchen in Zurich to see how airplane meals are made. All the meals are made in precision to recipe, with the same portion and quality.I flew out of Zurich the next day, on Singapore Airlines A380. I have a choice of both Western and Asian cuisine designed by the chef at Gate Gourmet. I chose my favorite dish after seeing all the meal options on-board. This video gives an insight from menu design to cooking, execution, delivery and finally tasting on-board!For more information visit gategroup: https://www.gategroup.com/Visit Instagram of Gate Gourmet and gategroup https://www.instagram.com/gategourmet/https://www.instagram.com/gategroup_o...------In this exclusive fly on the wall documentary and behind the scenes special, I investigate what goes in to making sure that every on-board meal served by Singapore Airlines on their super jumbo-jet Airbus A380s is fresh, tasty, filling and consistent. I film and work alongside the Swiss airline catering company Gate Gourmet as they use sophisticated methods within their factory in Zurich to produce restaurant quality cuisine for the hundreds of passengers aboard these flights and also as they prepare the environment of the A380 for such brilliant dishes!I start by experiencing what it’s like to work on board the Gate Gourmet catering trucks. These special trucks are equipped with a nifty little on-board elevator to bring the prepared food up to the level of the aeroplane’s passenger entrance for simple, level loading of the food. Gate Gourmet have just one hour to load everything on board but everything is ordered within the truck for a logical and seamless disembarking of the dishes.After witnessing this masterclass in aeroplane preparation, I head to the Gate Gourmet factory in the Swiss capital to see where all of this food comes from and how Gate Gourmet ensure that hygiene is maintained from start to finish. At the start of the food preparation factory tour, I see the cataloguing, washing and storing of all of the raw ingredients which are received from vegetables to meats to spices and the intensive and meticulous washing of the dishes, cutlery and metal trolleys and trays used in food service aboard the flight. None of the washing of the dishes is done by hand – instead, all of the dishes are washed in a huge dishwasher at high temperatures and with antibacterial chemicals, which sees a whopping 14,000 glasses cleaned at the factory per day.The Gate Gourmet facility produces in the region of 65,000 aeroplane meals a day. To maintain consistency across that many dishes, the factory makes use of its own invented coordinated recipe assembly procedure, with all of the ingredients pre-weighed, cut and segregated for the chefs to be able to work their magic and cook and prepare things such as chicken breasts and delicious rhubarb crumbles in their in-house patisserie and bakery – it is a great source of pride for Gate Gourmet to have their dessert production completely in-house.In the final assembly of the meals, regular sampling ensures that the weights of the meals comply with strict consistent weight rules set by Singapore airlines – each meal must weigh the same as all of the others of its type to the gram.Back at Zurich Airport, I take a flight out of Switzerland with Singapore Airlines aboard one of their A380s which has been stocked, loaded by Gate Gourmet. I am lucky enough to get a bulkhead seat with unlimited leg room and, during the meal service on board, I am delighted to try both the Western and Asian main meal offerings of Gate Gourmet on this particular flight and you can see footage of me having fun in the development kitchen of Gate Gourmet with chefs Dennis Puchert and CK trying to make both.Let me know whether you think you would have preferred the Asian or the Western dish in the comments!",PT15M34S,2019-07-24,2019-07-24,343213,Sam Chui,/channel/UCfYCRj25JJQ41JGPqiqXmJw,UCfYCRj25JJQ41JGPqiqXmJw,19,1m6h59wI_yI

The Unusual Earth Orbit Circling Above Our Ancient Past | Roger G. Gilbertson | TEDxColoradoSprings,Nonprofits & Activism,401558,"9,265",402,"NOTE FROM TED: We've flagged this talk, which was filmed at a TEDx event, because it appears to fall outside the TEDx content guidelines. Claims made in this talk only represent the speaker’s personal views which are not corroborated by scientific evidence. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/t...When does our future meet our past? How does our scientific knowledge grow and change? A newly recognized type of Earth orbit can travel directly above a great circle formed by some of the oldest and most distinctive ancient human constructions on the surface of the Earth: the Giza pyramids, Machu Picchu, Easter Island, Angkor Wat, Mohenjo-Daro, and many others. But is there any connection to all this? What do we need to learn - scientifically - to gain a greater understanding of the links between these sites, and the great changes that happened on our planet 12,800 years ago. Follow the adventures of a science writer and skeptic as he explores extraordinary coincidences, connections, and the evidence linking our modern world to our mysterious past. I like to make up stuff – stories, inventions, visual and auditory experiences. But when it comes to understanding the “real world” I want facts, and the scientific method provides our best way of finding them, and of making sure we are not misled by fantasies, fallacies, or frauds.Ever since I first learned about Stonehenge when I was very young, I’ve been fascinated by the mysteries of our ancient human past, and the many unanswered questions. Our scientific toolkit lets us push back the unknown to gain a clearer understanding of where we came from, who we are, and in turn - where we might be going.In my years as a writer, inventor, researcher, filmmaker, skeptic, story teller and explainer, I have always tried to keep an open mind about what we do not yet know.

China’s Vanishing Muslims: Undercover In The Most Dystopian Place In The World,News & Politics,4307729,"104,771","9,538","China’s Uighur minority live a dystopian nightmare of constant surveillance and brutal policing. At least one million of them are believed to be living in what the U.N. described as a “massive internment camp that is shrouded in secrecy,” while many Uighur children are taken to state-run orphanages where they're indoctrinated into Chinese customs.The Uighurs' plight has largely been kept hidden from the world, thanks to China’s aggressive attempts to suppress the story at all costs.VICE News’ Isobel Yeung posed as a tourist to gain unprecedented access to China’s western Xinjiang region, which has been nearly unreachable by journalists.She and our crew experienced China’s Orwellian surveillance and harassment first-hand during their time in Xinjiang, and captured chilling hidden-camera footage of eight Uighur men detained by police in the middle of the night. We spoke with members of the Uighur community about their experience in these camps, and about China’s attempts to silence their history and lifestyle under the cover of darkness.Subscribe to VICE News here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-NewsCheck out VICE News for more: http://vicenews.comFollow VICE News here:Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/vicenewsTwitter: https://twitter.com/vicenewsTumblr: http://vicenews.tumblr.com/Instagram: http://instagram.com/vicenewsMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideo#VICENewsTonight",PT31M48S,2019-06-29,2019-06-29,234441,VICE News,/channel/UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,UCZaT_X_mc0BI-djXOlfhqWQ,20,v7AYyUqrMuQ

"The Bruins-Canadiens beef featured a police investigation, death threats, and brawl after brawl",Sports,118431,"4,778",65,"The Bruins and Canadiens have created a rivalry that’s full of tradition and blood and Stanley Cups. But rivalry and beef are two different things. One can help propel the other, sure, it's just that beef requires a special group of players seeing way too much of each other. That's exactly what happened in the late aughts and became its beefiest self from 2010 to 2014.A star-studded cast was headlined by P.K. Subban, Zdeno Chara, Max Pacioretty, Brad Marchand, Milan Lucic, and eventually Alexei Emelin. They met often as long-time division rivals, then more often thanks to the playoffs. A hit wasn't just a hit between these teams. It was a piece being stacked on what would become a tower of beef.Written and produced by Will BuikemaDirected by Ryan SimmonsMotion graphics by Phil PasternakSubscribe: https://goo.gl/NbabaeCheck out our full video catalog: https://goo.gl/9pMHRVVisit our playlists: https://goo.gl/NvpZFFLike SB Nation on Facebook: https://goo.gl/Pzcs7OFollow on Twitter: https://goo.gl/5LI02DFollow on Instagram: https://goo.gl/aY2FFKExplore SB Nation: http://www.sbnation.com#SBNation #BeefHistory",PT18M18S,2020-05-03,2020-05-03,432423,SB Nation,/channel/UCDRmGMSgrtZkOsh_NQl4_xw,UCDRmGMSgrtZkOsh_NQl4_xw,20,VYLnYmtnMIU
Negotiation Skills With Chris Voss | Never Split The Difference | The Jordan Harbinger Show Ep. 165,Education,75840,"1,207",37,"Like networking, the thought of negotiating can give even the most socially robust among us cold sweats. The stakes can be as low as a cheaper head of cabbage at the local farmers' market or as high as the future of your career when you're trying to get a significant raise at your annual performance review, but negotiation for most of us never reaches a point where lives are on the line -- unless you're today's guest.In this episode we talk to Chris Voss, who retired as the lead international kidnapping negotiator for the FBI, is CEO of the Black Swan Group, and is the author of the national bestseller Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as If Your Life Depended on It. From our conversation, you may be surprised to discover that the tactics for negotiating business deals and the safe release of hostages are startlingly similar. Listen, learn, and enjoy!Full show notes and worksheet for this episode here:https://jordanharbinger.com/165What We Discuss with Chris Voss:💡 How you can be a more effective negotiator for anything by using the FBI’s own field-proven hostage negotiation techniques.💡 How to determine which of the three archetypes of negotiator you're dealing with: The Analyst, The Assertive, or The Accommodator.💡 Who has the real leverage in a kidnapping or hostage scenario -- and how this applies to your own lower-stakes negotiations.💡 What it takes to subtly convince someone to have it your way.💡 The Black Swan Rule: Treating others not the way you want to be treated, but the way they want to be treated.And much more...Books mentioned in this episode: 📖Never Split The Difference Buy from Amazon: https://geni.us/fbeB📖Thinking Fast And Slow https://geni.us/NCrerqLWant to watch more in-depth interviews with some of the world’s most amazing and successful people click here for more full episodes - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNbAQ...Never miss a single incredible insight by subscribing to the Jordan Harbinger Show here http://www.youtube.com/THEJORDANHARBI...Welcome to the Jordan Harbinger Show, a podcast where each week you get to join a conversation with some of the world’s highest achievers.

Nebraska retiree uses earths's heat to grow oranges in snow,Howto & Style,2172548,"59,753",662,"Winter temperatures in Alliance, Nebraska can drop to -20°F (the record low is -40°F/C), but retired mailman Russ Finch grows oranges in his backyard greenhouse without paying for heat. Instead, he draws on the earth's stable temperature (around 52 degrees in his region) to grow warm weather produce- citrus, figs, pomegranates - in the snow.Finch first discovered geothermal heating in 1979 when he and his wife built it into their 4400-square-foot dream home to cut energy costs. Eighteen years later they decided to add a 16'x80' greenhouse in the backyard. The greenhouse resembles a pit greenhouse (walipini) in that the floor is dug down 4 feet below the surface and the roof is slanted to catch the southern sun.To avoid using heaters for the cold Nebraska winter nights, Finch relies on the warm underground air fed into the greenhouse via plastic tubing under the yard and one fan.Finch sells a ""Citrus in the Snow"" report detailing his work with his ""geo-air"" greenhouses and says anyone can build a market-producing greenhouse for about $25,000 or ""less than the cost of a heat system on a traditional greenhouse"".https://greenhouseinthesnow.com/https://faircompanies.com/videos/nebr...",PT18M17S,2018-05-27,2018-05-27,155553,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,ZD_3_gsgsnk

Where does Gina get her recipes?Most of these recipes are from what she learned growing up in Italy, but some of them have evolved over time. She has also learned new recipes from friends and family in America. She is always eager to try new things.Why does she make such large portions?When she was in Italy, she would cook and bake in such large quantities so she wouldn’t have to take time every day to make food, and instead be able to work on the farm. Many of her recipes can be cut in half or quartered if you choose to try them out!Why is no one helping her in the video?Grandma Gina doesn’t want help! Usually, it’s because we will slow her down or not do it “her way.” For the videos we only show her, but when the camera cuts we jump in and help form the cookies or prep for the next step.  Why don’t we buy her a new...?Grandma Gina has a closet and garage full of new gadgets, spoons, forks, pots, etc… but she doesn’t like them because she is used to doing it with her old tools. She has fun getting her hands dirty!Who is behind the camera?Her retired son-in-law films, her daughter helps her prep, and she usually has one or two grandkids in the kitchen.Does Gina read the comments?We print out and show her how much love she gets from all her viewers, and she is very thankful and hopes you enjoy her cooking! Your comments bring her lots of joy, laughter, and inspiration to make more videos to share with you.

Spicy cucumber side dish (Oi-muchim: 오이무침),Howto & Style,2910894,"50,978",879,"Caption's available! http://www.maangchi.com/recipe/oi-muchimThis recipe is also in my cookbook, Real Korean Cooking: http://www.maangchi.com/realI’m going to share a super simple recipe with you today that’s one of my all time favorites. It’s a spicy Korean cucumber side dish called oi-muchim. If you have a nice seedless English cucumber, you can make this delicious banchan in just a few minutes. During my round the world Gapshida trip to meet my readers in 2011, I made this dish almost everywhere I went. Everybody loved it. Who wouldn’t like cold, fresh, crispy, seasoned cucumber? Each bite is succulent and wonderful!Oi means “cucumber” in English, and muchim means “mixed” or “seasoned,” so many people simply call this dish “seasoned cucumber”.  Many Koreans have their own version of it, so you’ll find many variations from family to family. This one is mine, and I’ve been using it for a long time. It’s also one of the dishes in my cookbook.A major tip for this recipe is to make it and mix it just before serving, which will keep it crisp and fresh and prevent it from getting watery. It’s perfectly for a summertime BBQ – refreshing and just spicy enough to give you a little kick!Enjoy the recipe! Let me know if you make it!Ingredients (Serves 4)1 English cucumber (or 2 to 3 kirby cucumbers), washed1/4 cup thinly sliced onion1 green onion, chopped2 garlic cloves, minced2 tablespoons soy sauce2 teaspoons hot pepper flakes2 teaspoons sesame oil2 teaspoons sesame seeds1 teaspoon sugar (optional)",PT4M28S,2015-04-30,2015-04-30,432255,Maangchi,/channel/UC8gFadPgK2r1ndqLI04Xvvw,UC8gFadPgK2r1ndqLI04Xvvw,20,zau-F0L_hrY

They are frustrated by endless scientific boasting.  They suspect that ... the scientific community holds them in contempt.  They are right to feel this way.""

Focusing on social justice, these pieces take us through Africa, Europe, India, and the U.S., chronicling battles against racism, xenophobia, colonialism, and surveillance.

Kristie Wolfe builds underground home & sets rural WA hamlet,Howto & Style,11015989,"109,668","4,887","Inspired by the success of the Hawaii treehouse she built for $11,000, Kristie Wolfe began searching for land to build a “Hobbit”-inspired village. Knowing that there is land to be found for cheap in this country (she bought her Hawaii property for $8000), she began to search the Northwest for sites.https://faircompanies.com/videos/buil...“There’s a lot of land everywhere, if you look on craigslist, if you look on zillow, you can find property so it’s not really that there’s not a lot. The issue is with property that’s in my price range- I’m looking for property that’s $10,000 to 20,000- usually there’s a reason why it’s cheap, it’s either an easement problem or you have to drive through a crappy neighborhood… but if you’re wanting to be off-grid, it opens up a whole world of selections, there’s a ton out there.”Wolfe paid $18,000 for 5 acres on a hillside above Lake Chelan, Washington. Being a couple miles down a dirt road, there was no option to be on the grid so Wolfe put in a solar panel, septic and a water tank (filled by truck for now) and began to dig the first of her underground homes.At 288 square feet, Wolfe’s “tiny house in the shire” was over the maximum square footage allowed for an un-permitted build so she went to the county for approval. With only hand-sketched plans on graph paper, she was able to get a permit. The structure went up in a few days “with a lot of help from family and friends” and it was “wrapped and roofed” in a few weeks and then Wolfe finished the interior on her own.Inspired by the “Hobbit” books, films and cartoon (from 1977), Wolfe wanted to recreate the cozy feel of a hobbit hole. ""Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole and that meant comfort.""Rather than buying expensive custom details, Wolfe got creative. She used the top of an old cable spool - scavenged for free long before the build- as a round door. To create round windows, she hid secondhand ($10) square windows behind repurposed circular mirror frames. For a very unique cordwood floor, she cut scraps of wood (found beside the road and old firewood) into into one-inch-thick pieces glued down with a heavy construction adhesive and grouted by hand (again thanks much help to friends and family).Wolfe has broken ground on the 2nd and 3rd hillside homes. She doesn't plan to change much of her design except to make the windows larger. The completed “village” will include an above-ground communal kitchen built to look like a thatched-roof English-style pub.Filming credit: Ivan Nanney- IvanTheIntrepid.com[Kristie’s “Tiny House in the Shire” rents on Airbnb https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/8794484]Original story: https://faircompanies.com/videos/kris...",PT25M37S,2016-09-18,2016-09-18,155513,Kirsten Dirksen,/channel/UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,UCDsElQQt_gCZ9LgnW-7v-cQ,19,Ix11VQ8f7uY

But when Matt and Daisy signed up for the training, they had no idea that the so-called Iceman was planning to lead them on a psychedelic journey across Europe that circled the chasm between science, spirituality and mystery.Sally Donatello - Photographer Watch Next: The Giants of Iceland - http://bit.ly/1fJjOULClick here to subscribe to VICE: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICECheck out our full video catalog: http://bit.ly/VICE-VideosVideos, daily editorial and more: http://vice.comMore videos from the VICE network: https://www.fb.com/vicevideosLike VICE on Facebook: http://fb.com/viceFollow VICE on Twitter: http://twitter.com/viceRead our Tumblr: http://vicemag.tumblr.comFollow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/viceCheck out our Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/vicemag",PT39M44S,2015-07-16,2015-07-16,323132,Fringes,/playlist?list=PLDbSvEZka6GEF5kRloeUpkMa5EOkqDcat,UCn8zNIfYAQNdrFRrr8oibKw,20,VaMjhwFE1Zw

Why We Bought a Gas RV Instead of a Diesel Pusher,Autos & Vehicles,118664,"3,876",92,"We are asked all the time if we are happy with our gas RV and when are we going to upgrade to a diesel pusher. Our RV is on the Ford Chassis with the Triton V10 6.8 liter engine, it is matched up with the Ford 5 speed torque shift transmission. In this video we go over the reasons why we bought a gas Class A RV and if we would by one again. I also talk about all of the benefits of owning a diesel pusher.1. Traveling all over the country we knew that we would be in unfamiliar places, but we could always find a Ford dealership anywhere and it would be easy to get parts. Almost any mechanic can work on a ford engine, so even small garages would be able to make repairs if need be.2. Cheap to maintain, Oil changes are usually right under $1003. easy to find a gas station, every fuel station sells gas, but not all sell diesel fuel4. Upfront cost will be less for a gas coach, gas RV’s are cheaper to purchase and cheaper to maintain, this probably the reason most people start with a gas RV5. You should expect to get about 200K-300K miles out of a gas coach and at 5,000 miles a year that is 40 to 60yrs this was more than we needed for the RV to be able to do. We plan on owning the RV for no more than 10 years. 6. What about mountain climbing. We knew 95% of our driving would not be climbing mountains, we have driven all over the united states and the most extreme grade on a highway is 9% we have been on higher grades on backroads and we have always made it with no problem, in fact we have to get out of the slow lane so that we can pass the tractor trailers. Of course the engine revs and it gets a little louder, but it’s not like we need to shout at one another. So for us needing more HP power and torgue for only 5% of our driving did not seem worth the upcharge.7. Size, we wanted to stay under 30 feet and when it comes to Diesel pushers we couldn’t find any Class A diesel RV’s under thirty feet. So the Class A gas met all of our needs and even succeeded them in some area.There are many advantages to a diesel pusher, but here are what I felt were the top ones.1. More towing capacity Tow a large trailer with toys or a larger SUV 2. More cargo capacity   Family, and more stuff3. Quieter ride because the engine is in the rear you will notice it is quieter in the front cab4. Softer and superior suspension will give you a smother and quieter ride.",PT11M46S,2020-02-08,2020-02-08,432355,Moving Forward Adventures,/channel/UCalJuw0Wh3DPNCOo1Hohwzw,UCalJuw0Wh3DPNCOo1Hohwzw,20,bedu9SWUneA

I began studying wilderness survival when I was 17 in order to have the ability to spend extensive periods of time in nature, seeking out empowerment and  without the need for external sources.  I began studying in 1993 under Tom Brown Jr eventually teaching for Tracker Inc.  I sought-out every old Native American teacher I could and eventually traveled the world living in very remote indigenous villages in the Amazon, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Peru.  My school teaches survival and primitive skills, nature awareness,  how to live off the land, re-wilding, prepare for disasters.

Artificial intelligence & algorithms: pros & cons | DW Documentary (AI documentary),Education,1105783,"14,355",565,"Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are leading to fundamental changes in the way we live. Algorithms can already detect Parkinson's disease and cancer, and control both cars and aircraft. How will AI change our society in the future?This documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AI’s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported 'social credit system' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AI’s social implications?A documentary by Tilman Wolff und Ranga Yogeshwar --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Is SpaceX's Raptor engine the king of rocket engines?,Science & Technology,2080755,"66,660","1,322","2:55 - Basic physics of rocket engines 6:10 - Rocket engine cycles 20:30 - Rocket fuel comparison30:40 - Raptor vs other rocket engines44:05 - SummaryArticle version - https://everydayastronaut.com/?p=9823...SpaceX's new raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine and its so hard to develop, no engine like this has ever flown before! Now this topic can be really intimidating so in order to bring the Raptor engine into context, we’re going to do an overview of a few common types of rocket engine cycles then compare the Raptor to a few other common rocket engines, like SpaceX’s current work horse, the Merlin, The Space Shuttle’s RS-25, the RD-180, Blue Origin’s BE-4 and the F-1 engine.And if that’s not enough, not only is SpaceX using a crazy engine cycle, they’re also going to be using Liquid Methane as their fuel, again something that no orbital rocket has ever used! So we’ll also go over the unique characteristics of liquid methane as a rocket fuel and see if we can figure out why SpaceX went with Methane for the Raptor engine.We'll also break down and explain all the different engine cycle types so you know what the full flow staged combustion cycle is, how it works, and how it compares to the other cycles.So by the end of this video hopefully we’ll have the context to know why the raptor engine is special, how it compares to other rocket engines, why it’s using methane and hopefully find out if the Raptor engine will be the new king of rocket engines…-----------------------------------------------Rocket engine renders by  @MartianDays https://twitter.com/MartianDaysF-1 Turbopump photo provided by Mike Jetzer/heroicrelics.orgHUGE thanks to my Moon Walker Patreon supporters!

Jason Riley On “False Black Power?”,News & Politics,132242,"2,778",79,"Recorded on February 21, 2019. What is “false black power?” According to Jason Riley, author of False Black Power?, it is political clout, whereas true black power is human capital and culture. Riley and Peter Robinson dive into the arguments in Riley’s new book, the history of African Americans in the United States, and welfare inequality in black communities.  Riley discusses the Moynihan report of 1965, which documented the rise of black families headed by single women in inner cities and how this report was something black sociologists had already been writing about for several years. He argues that there was clearly a breakdown of the nuclear family and that this is a result of the “Great Society” welfare programs of the 1960s rather than the legacy of slavery or Jim Crow laws. In the 1960s, Riley posits that the black activist community’s shift towards political engagement was misguided. He argues that the idea of black political clout leading to black economic advancement was misplaced. Other impoverished communities (i.e. Irish, Jewish, and Italian immigrant communities) at various times in American history focused on economic advancement first before trying to achieve political clout, and they were successful. Instead, the black community focused first on electing black politicians, which ended up doing very little for the economic advancement of the community as politicians typically put their own interests first, above their communities’. Riley points out that the economic data shows that black communities became more impoverished under black leadership. Riley proposes a solution of advocating for more school-choice vouchers, which allow black parents to take better control of their children’s futures and place them in the best schools for them. He also argues for reducing social safety nets, making them a more temporary form of welfare rather than the multigenerational welfare system currently in place.

"Introduction to DADGAD, from Celtic Guitar with Tony McManus",Music,818681,"10,010",251,"In this Peghead Nation course, Tony McManus teaches you how to play reels, jigs, airs, and other traditional forms, both fingerstyle and with a flatpick. He walks you through melodies and shows you how to bring tunes to life with the ornamentation that defines Irish and Scottish traditional music. In this sample lesson, Tony gives an introduction to D A D G A D tuning, which is closely associated with playing Celtic music on the guitar.For more info and to sign up, please visit https://www.pegheadnation.com/string-...Tony McManus is recognized throughout the world as one of the leading guitarists in Celtic music. From early childhood, his twin obsessions of traditional music and acoustic guitar have combined to produce a startlingly original approach to this ancient art. In Tony’s hands the complex ornamentation normally associated with fiddles and pipes is accurately transferred to guitar in a way that preserves the integrity and emotional impact of the music while sounding completely suited to the guitar.Tony’s first, self-titled, recording in 1996, followed by Pourquoi Quebec in 1999, led to worldwide recognition. However, it was with the release of Ceol More in 2002 that Tony’s stature as a first-class musician reached a new level. Critics hailed the focussed, spell-binding nature of the music, from the plaintive Jewish hymn “Shalom Aleichem” to the ingenious arrangement of the Charles Mingus classic “Goodbye Pork Pie Hat.” Along with nominations for Tony as Musician of the Year by both the BBC Folk Awards and the Scottish Traditional Music awards, Ceol More made the Album of the Year list in Acoustic Guitar magazine and was named the “Live Ireland Awards” Album of the Year.Tony’s live work ranges from intimate solo performances to a duet with Italian flatpicker Beppe Gambetta to a trio with brothers Gary and Greg Grainger to the quartet Men of Steel (with fellow guitarists Dan Crary, Gambetta, and Don Ross). He is an enthusiastic collaborator as leader and sideman, and has worked with Dougie MacLean, Phil Cunningham, Mairi MacInnes, Liam O’Flynn, Martin Simpson, Kevin Burke, Alison Brown, Martyn Bennett, Natalie MacMaster, Patrick and Jacky Molard, Mairead ní Mhoanaigh and Dermot Byrne, the Nashville Chamber Orchestra, John Jorgenson, Jean Michel Veillon, Catriona Macdonald, Seikou Keita, Xosé Manuel Budiño, Ewen Vernal, and Andy Irvine. He is also in great demand as a studio musician and has contributed to more than 60 recordings.His 2009 release The Maker’s Mark showcased 15 of the finest luthier-built guitars in the world. Recording a solo piece on each instrument, the project caught the attention of the mainstream rock guitar press in a way that acoustic work rarely does.Never one to be typecast, Tony’s 2013 album Mysterious Boundaries stemmed from a challenge from mandolin virtuoso Mike Marshall to learn the Bach E Major Prelude for Violin on guitar. This led to an exploration of classical and baroque music, seemingly very different from the jigs and reels that he grew up with.

From Jenner to Wakefield: The long shadow of the anti-vaccination movement,Science & Technology,110282,440,332,"In 1998 a medical furore broke out when The Lancet published an article by Andrew Wakefield questioning the benefits of the MMR vaccination which was being given unquestioningly to children throughout the UK.Coming 202 years after the first vaccination by Edward Jenner, which led to the eradication of smallpox throughout the world, this recent incident is only the latest in a long history of questioning the benefits of vaccination.From early irrational fears born of outdated medical understanding through to the latest medical research and findings, Professor Gareth Williams traces the history of the anti-vaccination movement and its long tail, reviewing the social settings in which the fears were found and offering a balanced assessment of vaccination as we find it today.The transcript and downloadable versions of the lecture are available from the on the Gresham College website:http://www.gresham.ac.uk/lectures-and...Gresham College has been giving free public lectures since 1597.

10 Cases On Dr. Phil That Went Out Of Control!,Entertainment,43558,528,48,"10 Cases On Dr. Phil That Went Out Of Control!Hello Youtube, welcome to yet another exciting Dr Phil video. Today’s video features cases on Dr Phil that went out of control!!!! If you don’t know who Dr.Phil is by now, then let me fill you in, with over 25 years of experience in psychology, sociology and observation, Dr Phil uses the power of television to tell compelling stories about real people tackling HEATED UP topics. The stories lined up for you will leave you cringing if not SHOCKED beyond belief. So here are cases on Dr Phil that went out of control.5. Only 11 Years Old and out of controlhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7QSj...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s0bkK...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nua6...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx4mk...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDbrS...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRzoG...Yes, the title is correct. This pre-teen, known as JJ has been reported by his mother as extremely violent. His anger has his mother and grandmother worried and they're seeking Dr Phil's help. However, the ending takes a rather strange turn when we receive a revelation!!!According to Bree, she’s very concerned about her 11-year-old son, JJ’s, extremely violent behaviour, which includes threatening to take away her life with a steak knife. There have been several occurrences where JJ would throw his bed across the room as well as drill his walls with a screwdriver when he 's angry. What makes it worse, JJ isn't afraid to curse at his mother and often screams at her when ticked off. Things have gotten waaaay out of control that Bree has to hide knives under her bed away from her son who can choose to attack at any moment!! Since JJ has no respect for his mom, he's threatened to stab her with a knife and even hit her together with her boyfriend. Bree reveals that JJ would punch and even bite her. What worries her most, however, is the fear of JJ self-harming since he has stabbed his foot several times before. As if acting out at home wasn’t enough, JJ is also having serious trouble at school. According to his records within the past three years, JJ has had over 50 disciplinary cases covering seven pages in his records and has been suspended about 20 times. Despite the many chances given at school, the institution terms him as a threat to other kids because not only is he using cursive and threatening words but also verbally spoken about his intentions to harm one of his classmates.Some of his crazy instances include throwing desks in the classroom almost physically harming other students, physically abusing his peers, verbally attacking teachers, throwing stones at people and one time he was ready to stab the principal with a broken pencil.Bree is more concerned about his child turning out like his violent criminal father because they pose similar anger issues and was an addict. She explains one instance where JJ had ran away from home only for her to find disturbing photos that he posted on social media using weed and holding a handgun. It was at this point she realized things were getting out of hand and needed to seek the extra help. Onset with Dr Phil, JJ seemed like a calm and collected boy. Dr Phil was proud that he understood what triggered his actions and was willing to help him go through counselling. He was honest that he needed help learning to cope with his anger which was blowing out of proportion.#drphill#phill#viralSubscribe to Viral Now: https://www.youtube.com/user/butterar...More Viral Now videos:Dr. Phil Can't Handle this girl https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Il77H...10 Things The Pawn Stars Don’t Want You To Know! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HvpB...Top 10 TALLEST Waterslides IN THE WORLD!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXR0V...9 Extinct Animals Being Brought Back To Life https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MstVa...Unbelievable Animals That Saved People’s Lives! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUftE...The End Of The Pawn Stars...? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-NWQ...Rarest Items EVER Sold on Pawn Stars!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TC9V...10 Shark Tank Deals That Will Go Down in History https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJwxL...Top 10 MOST INSANE Waterslides YOU WON'T BELIEVE ACTUALLY EXIST! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ8aC...10 BIGGEST SHARK TANK Deals!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_fvW...Music Credits:Ian Taylorhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMNAc...Leave a like for more shark tank, pawn stars, tv show, and business content.family friendly pg clean",PT14M3S,2019-12-02,2019-12-02,344433,Viral Now,/channel/UC-NPQYmHM9AagZg2GfaiiBw,UC-NPQYmHM9AagZg2GfaiiBw,19,vn5jDP-YxIM

Influential writers disparage those interested in considering the relevance of faith to life.Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.   – Richard DawkinsAt DIG & DELVE we hope to provide an open, honest and respectful environment where people can explore reasons why faith makes sense and why it is meaningful to give consideration to the life and teaching of Jesus.   We hope to encourage curiosity and a healthy critical inquisitiveness.   People coming from a spectrum of world-views, Christian and otherwise, are welcome.At DIG & DELVE, we gather talented experts in their fields to come and share their opinions about deep issues human wrestle with and together we discuss some of the latest research around these questions.Expect to be challenged.

Ex-Mob Boss Rates 13 Mafia Movie Scenes | How Real Is It?,Entertainment,3192642,"76,180","1,903","Michael Franzese, a former New York mobster and ex-caporegime of the Colombo crime family, rates classic mafia movie scenes on how accurate they are. The US mafia is featured in many classic movies from the 1920s onwards. We discuss the cultural significance and accuracy of famous crime scenes in movies and TV shows, such as ""The Godfather"" and ""The Sopranos."" Franzese also points out inaccuracies in scenes from mob comedies such as ""Analyze This"" and ""The Simpsons.""Franzese discusses true stories and real-life characters featured in ""Goodfellas"" and ""Casino."" He talks about his proximity to the events of Martin Scorsese's ""The Irishman,"" the Oscar-nominated movie starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. After Franzese was released from prison in 1995, he became the only high ranking official of a major mafia family to ever walk away, without protective custody, and survive. Franzese is the author of ""Blood Covenant"" and ""I’ll Make You An Offer You Can’t Refuse."" He now works as a public speaker and motivator.MORE 'HOW REAL IS IT?':Explosives Expert Rates Movie Explosions: https://youtu.be/TfBgb0NZLGwPhysicist Breaks Down Iconic Marvel Scenes: https://youtu.be/DuFyGHgGIKgBallerina Breaks Down 11 Ballet Scenes: https://youtu.be/uloBdN4WNkk------------------------------------------------------#MafiaMovies #MichaelFranzese #InsiderInsider is great journalism about what passionate people actually want to know.

Paul seemed destined for success then something came to get him, something he’d never experienced before that would take his personal goals and freedom far away from his grasp in a seemingly never ending battle.

Homesteading Family Living Off-Grid in a Spectacular Earthship,Howto & Style,2777090,"60,625","1,352","This inspiring off-grid homesteading family lives in a renovated stone earthship.  They grow their own food, collect rainwater, use solar power, have composting toilets, and they have a pond that filters their grey water.  On top of living an eco friendly lifestyle, they dedicate their work to important projects like urban gardening and promoting industrial hemp as ""Hempbassadors.""To follow their exciting project, check them out on Facebook and Instagram here:https://www.instagram.com/hempbassadors/https://www.facebook.com/hempbassadors/Off-Grid Living playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...Earthship playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...During the winter, they typically take 2-4 months off to travel, which is financially possible for them because they don't have a mortgage (the house only cost $15,000 when they bought it).Their daughter, Emma, is in the first grade, but they take her out of school while they travel and homeschool her on the road.Francis & Marie have dreamt of being self-sufficient for a long time.  For 8 years they renovated their earthship home, planted their permaculture gardens, and prepared for the day they'd be able to live their dream full-time.For over 2 years now they've been living on their dream homestead.  They grow apples, berries, and other fruits which they preserve for winter.  They also grow vegetables, and collect eggs from their chickens.  In the summer, their grocery bill can be as low as $30/week because they produce so much of their own food.Much of their harvest is kept cool in their root cellar although they would like to have a fridge.The home is a passive solar home with a greenhouse in the front.  It can stay above zero degrees on it's own, but they have a wood stove – an Amish Pioneer Princess – to heat the house, to cook, and to heat their hot water.For rainwater, they have 3 collection systems.  One is a tank in front of the house that collects water from the greenhouse, and they use a solar powered pump to transfer it into an underground cistern.Another tank collects rainwater from the roof, and a third collects rainwater from their shed.  In total they can have 10,000 litres of fresh water when all of the tanks are full.They don't have a well yet so they get their drinking water from a cabin they have access to down the road.They have a small solar power system for their lights, the water pump, and for the internet.  They'd eventually like to invest in a bigger system but for now it works well.Thanks for watching!Mat & Danielle-------------------------------------------------------------STAY IN TOUCH!-------------------------------------------------------------Blog: www.exploringalternatives.caFacebook: /exploringalternativesblogInstagram: @exploringalternatives-------------------------------------------------------------COMMENTS-------------------------------------------------------------We want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and to contribute.

Building a Shipping Container Home | EP01Permits and Foundation Design,Howto & Style,4659087,"75,732","2,593","In Episode 1 we will go over the basic considerations for buying shipping containers, explain how we got building permits for a shipping container house and show how we constructed the concrete foundations.  Link to the company i bought my shipping containers from: https://www.containerdiscounts.com/bu...Follow us on instagram for project updates: https://www.instagram.com/benjaminuyeda/Shop the Container Home: https://www.homedepot.com/c/openhouseExplore the Container Home: http://www.uncontained.house/We are still working on getting the website for this project up and running so please be patient.Buying the Shipping Containers: We purchased one trip condition hi-cube containers.  California requires that shipping containers used for homes have documentation showing that have not had toxic or radioactive materials in them. This normally means that you need one trip condition containers with appropriate certificates.  I bought my containers from https://www.containerdiscounts.com/sh... and paid $4800 each for the 40-foot hi-cube containers and $3250 for the 20-foot hi-cube container. Hi-cube containers are a foot taller than typical shipping containers.Permits:I recommend going in person to the local building department showing them the survey and asking them for a checklist of everything that needs to be completed to get building permits.  The survey is important because it shows the building dept both the physical nature of the property and documents its legal boundaries and history.  I explained that I wanted to build a shipping container house and asked for a complete checklist of everything I would need to get done and submit in order to get building permits.  Architectural DesignI used the architecture firm I co-founded, ZeroEnergy Design, to produce the architectural drawings.  Even though I am a co-owner I made sure to pay the firm for the hours of preparation that this task would take.  It would be unfair to my partners if I used firm resources for my own personal project. I paid $5000 for the creation of the architectural drawings.  Structural EngineeringI sent the architectural drawings over to the structural engineering firm I hired, and they created the structural details and created a package of calculations showing that these details would meet all code requirements and result in a safe and strong building.  This package of drawings and calculations was required by the building dept.  My architecture firm primarily practices on the east coast and does not have a stamp in California so I had the structural engineering firm stamp the drawings.  The building dept gave me the option of having either the architecture firm or the engineering firm stamp the documents.Foundation design:We ended up building a monolithic on slab on grade concrete foundation.  We worked on designs for some piers that would have saved in material costs but then the space underneath the container would have been classified as a crawl space and the bottom of the container would have to be 18” off the ground at a minimum.  This would mean I would have to build stairs and railing for all the decks.  Grading the site and excavating for the foundationI rented a bulldozer and hired an operator to level a portion of the site where I wanted to place the house.  I then rented a back hoe to dig out the footings for the foundation. Building the formsThe forms were built out of 2x8s screwed to steel stakes that we hammered into the ground.ReinforcementWe used #4 rebar to reinforce the concrete.  This was wired together to match the structural drawings.  Concrete DayConcrete day was pretty exciting.  We had to pump the concrete to one of the foundation slabs because the truck couldn’t get close enough without driving over the other forms.

A Special Evening with Ann Coulter — 7/16/15,Education,240009,"2,694",481,"Please join us for a special lecture with Ann Coulter for her brand new book, ""¡Adios, America!"" (Publish Date: June 1, 2015).  This event is in conjunction with KRLA 870AM The Answer. Introduction by Reagan Foundation Executive Director John Heubusch.In ""Adios, America,"" Ann Coulter touches the third rail in American politics, attacking the immigration issue head-on and flying in the face of La Raza, the Democrats, a media determined to cover up immigrants' crimes, churches that get paid by the government for their ""charity,"" and greedy Republican businessmen and campaign consultants—all of whom are profiting handsomely from mass immigration that's tearing the country apart. Applying her trademark biting humor to the disaster that is U.S. immigration policy, Coulter proves that immigration is the most important issue facing America today.Ann Coulter is the author of ten ""New York Times"" bestsellers.  She is the legal correspondent for ""Human Events"" and writes a popular syndicated column for Universal Press Syndicate.  She is also a frequent guest on many TV shows, including Hannity, Piers Morgan, Red Eye and more.  In 2001, Ms. Coulter was named one of the top 100 Public Intellectuals by federal judge Richard Posner.For more information on the ongoing works of President Reagan's Foundation, please visit http://www.reaganfoundation.org",PT59M19S,2015-07-17,2015-07-17,322142,ReaganFoundation,/channel/UCEJi23qnygQHE5UeLXoV_JQ,UCEJi23qnygQHE5UeLXoV_JQ,20,oeM2snOkr80

Lockerbie: The Pan Am bomber,News & Politics,359981,"1,165",215,"When the Libyan intelligence operative Abdel Baset al-Megrahi eventually dies of the prostate cancer that so controversially won him his freedom from a Scottish prison, his death will trigger headlines around the world. But few tears will be shed for the only man ever found guilty of the 1988 bombing of Pan Am 103 -- until 9/11, the most lethal terrorist attack ever on American civilians. Certainly not by the American families, who felt shock and  revulsion at al-Megrahi's release. Nor by American politicians, infuriated at the long list of British and Scottish officials who have refused to testify before a Senate committee investigating possible backroom deals involving Scottish and British officials, British commercial interests and the Libyan government. Yet by the accounts of those who knew him best, the convicted man himself will go to his grave insisting he was innocent of the murder of the 270 passengers, crew and residents, who perished at Lockerbie in Scotland, that December night. Drawing exclusively on a previously confidential, legal report, The Pan Am Bomber reveals the evidence that would have been presented in al-Megrahi's stillborn appeal against his conviction. Our investigation is backed up by 97 gigabytes of official documents, whistleblower testimony and photographic evidence - all of which will explain why and how al-Megrahi's conviction was fatally flawed. It reveals how the chain of evidence used to convict al-Megrahi was broken and, in at least one crucial instance, tampered with. It also shows why it was in the interest of all of the parties (except the convicted man himself) to make sure that the appeal was never heard.",PT47M11S,2011-06-10,2011-06-10,431353,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,0oVVmt1W-6U

Where did the airlines park their airplanes? // WOW!!!,Autos & Vehicles,3534521,"51,923","1,239","Victorville California is currently one of the largest airplane parking lots in the world due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In this video, in coordination with air traffic control (ATC), I fly a dramatic low approach in my Grumman Tiger over the closed runway that is currently  home for over 400 unused jets. After that, we fly over the peak bloom of the Antelope Valley poppy fields to see an explosion of color in the Mojave Desert.Background:Global airline travel has been dramatically affected as a result of the corona virus and as a result, the airlines have been temporarily storing their fleet at select locations to wait out the current crisis. Southern California Logistics Airport (KVCV) in Victorville, California is one of the primary storage depots for Delta, Southwest and FedEx. It is also one of the largest airplane boneyards in the USA. ComAv is the company that stores and manages these aircraft. It is home to dozens of Boeing 737 Max jets as a result of their recall in 2019. In addition, you can find many other jets, including Boeing 747, 757, and 767 aircraft. There are also Airbus A310, A320 and McDonnell-Douglas MD-10 and MD-11 aircraft. KVCV was recently also the home for the next generation Air Force One Boeing 747-8 jets. SuperBloomEvery spring in the deserts of Southern California, many colorful flowers bloom and present an amazing display across the desolate and rugged landscapes. While usually an extremely popular location for selfies, many of these locations are closed down because of the corona virus and unable to be seen by many.I want to give a big shout out to the tower controllers at KVCV that were kind enough to let me do a flyover on the closed runway to see all the airplanes.MUSIC Halation by EvolvBoundary by Kevin GrahamA Light in the Attic by This Patch of SkyInvincible by Loya",PT10M20S,2020-04-15,2020-04-15,34311,Southern California,/results?search_query=Southern+California&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKU2FiSmhhY2x3NEFSMkdnTTlEUERJM0k%253D,UChC5m04nbvOAYRsvE9cPybA,19,zIbXai0l174

Sir Roger Scruton: How to Be a Conservative,News & Politics,624932,"14,183",513,"Recorded on February 27, 2017In the latest episode from Uncommon Knowledge, Sir Roger Scruton, a formally trained political philosopher, talks about his life and the events he’s witnessed that led him to conservatism. He first embraced conservatism after witnessing the leftist student protests in France in May 1968. During the ensuing riots in Paris, more than three hundred people  were injured. Scruton walked away from this event with a change in worldview and a strong leaning toward conservatism. Visits to communist- controlled Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1979 cemented his preference for conservatism and his distaste for the fraud of communism and socialism,  initiating a desire to do something about it. From thereon he dedicated himself to helping organize underground seminars for the young people oppressed behind the iron curtain. Sir Roger examines a brief history of conservatism in the twentieth century of England in regard to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. Although  he appreciates what Margaret Thatcher stood for, he argues that she had many conservative ideals but never used the conservative framework to organize her overall political strategy. Instead she organized around market economics, which was not always effective in the social, cultural, and legal areas. Peter Robinson argues that Winston Churchill did a much better job of organizing around conservative ideals but eventually lost an election because he didn’t have the vocabulary or the focus on free markets. They discuss the tenuous relationship between free markets and conservative ideals that have not mixed well together in British politics. Robinson and Sir Roger discuss the 2016 political upset of Brexit in the United Kingdom and how the political analysts failed to predict the vote outcome, much like what happened in November 2016 in the United States. They deliberate how  the issues around immigration from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom contributed to Brexit, in addition to general dissatisfaction with the European Union.  Thus, in the cases of both the United Kingdom and the United States, the media and intellectuals ignored the will of the “indigenous working classes” who made their voices known through their votes. About the Guest: Sir Roger ScrutonSir Roger Scruton is an English writer and philosopher who has published more than fifty books in philosophy, aesthetics, and politics. His book discussed in this episode was How to Be a Conservative;  it was published in 2014. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington. DC. He is currently teaching an MA in philosophy course for the University of Buckingham. Sir Scruton was knighted in 2016 by Queen Elizabeth II for his “services to philosophy, teaching and public education.”Additional Resources: Brexit:http://www.hoover.org/news/hoover-fel...http://www.hoover.org/research/brusse...http://www.hoover.org/research/gibral...https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...http://www.hoover.org/research/will-b...

"Jack Goldsmith, ""In Hoffa's Shadow""",News & Politics,6437,80,6,"Jack Goldsmith discusses his book, ""In Hoffa's Shadow"", at Politics and Prose.There have been many theories about the fate of Jimmy Hoffa, the longtime president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, since he disappeared in 1975. Many involve Charles “Chuckie” O’Brien, Hoffa’s aide and Goldsmith’s stepfather. In this compelling investigation-cum-memoir, Goldsmith, Henry L. Shattuck Professor of Law at Harvard University and author of Terror Presidency and Power and Constraint, recounts how his childhood affection for O’Brien became more complicated as he pursued a legal career. Then, with the perspective he gained from serving as assistant attorney general under George W. Bush, Goldsmith was moved to uncover the truth about O’Brien, Hoffa, the mob, the waning of labor’s power, and the rise of the surveillance state.https://www.politics-prose.com/book/9...Jack Goldsmith is the Henry L. Shattuck Professor of Law at Harvard University. From October 2003 to June 2004 he was assistant attorney general, Office of Legal Counsel.

Tara Reade’s Ex-Neighbor on Biden Sexual Assault Allegation: I Believed Her Then & I Believe Her Now,News & Politics,195996,"3,680",336,"Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden denied sexual assault allegations against him on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday, breaking his silence after weeks of mounting pressure to respond to claims put forward by former staffer Tara Reade, who says he sexually assaulted her in 1993. In a statement, Biden said, “I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago. They aren’t true. This never happened.” Tara Reade first came forward with her allegations in March, saying Biden pushed her up against a wall and digitally penetrated her. In a Democracy Now! broadcast exclusive, we speak with Reade’s former neighbor Lynda LaCasse, who says that Reade told her about the encounter and described it in detail in the 1990s. LaCasse is a lifelong Democrat and Biden supporter. She says of Tara Reade, “I believe her 100%.” We also speak with investigative journalist Rich McHugh, who first interviewed LaCasse for Business Insider.#DemocracyNowDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

In this brilliancy, Fischer demonstrates how to inject multiple imbalances into a highly symmetrical position, how to properly highlight these differences to benefit oneself, and how to accurately assess the true value of the pieces as they rest on the board.PGN:1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. g3 { E60 King's Indian Defense: Fianchetto Variation, Immediate Fianchetto } c6 4.

"Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya's case against stock buybacks, dividends",News & Politics,224348,"8,163",143,"CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" is joined by Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya to discuss his latest deal, his view of the U.S. economy and markets.Social Capital CEO Chamath Palihapitiya on Wednesday doubled down on his comments that the government shouldn’t bail out billionaires or allow buybacks amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “Buybacks are the primary example of a growing strain of incompetence amongst CEOs and amongst boards,” Palihapitiya said on CNBC’s “Fast Money Halftime Report.”  “And it’s where we need to start thinking about how the rules need to change.”Palihapitiya was defending his comments from two weeks ago, when he said poor-performing CEO’s deserve to be “wiped out” rather than bailed out from coronavirus-related economic issues. “I think why I was frustrated is that I just think that that kind of behavior makes no sense and instead of being punished, it has been rewarded,” Palihapitiya said Wednesday. “Since 2009, the 500 companies in the S&P 500, they bought back $7 trillion of stock and or issued dividends that turned out to be more than 90 cents of every dollar of profit that they made over the last 11-plus years. The federal government, as well as the Fed, between monetary and fiscal stimulus combined, have essentially transferred around $7 trillion now back to those said companies as well as companies slightly smaller than them,” he added.Palihapitiya has been critical of the United States’ economic reaction to the Covid-19 pandemic, saying that stimulus money should go directly to consumers and workers rather than businesses. The Federal Reserve has announced a slew of new moves aimed at getting trillions of dollars into businesses and governments, including its Main Street business lending program and market interventions, as part of an aggressive strategy to keep markets functioning and support the economy.

Why Airbus And Boeing Dominate The Sky,News & Politics,1505304,"13,553",667,"Airbus and Boeing dominate an already under competitive airline manufacturing industry.  The duopoly owns the sky by making up 99% of global large aircraft orders and those large plane orders make up more than 90% of the total plane market according to the Teal Group, an aerospace market analysis company (regional jet manufacturers only account for 7% of the airplane market by value).The duopoly doesn’t have many competitors, but overseas competition is brewing. China’s state-run company, COMAC, is poised to make waves in the aviation manufacturing industry, but some say not for a couple decades.

The message they relay says there is 'no compromise on leadership,' but do they mean it or are hairline fractures beginning to emerge?Using the oral diary of a Tripoli-based insider, as well as interviews with the UK prime minister's senior advisor on Libya and leading figures in Benghazi and Tripoli, State of Denial explores the demise of Gaddafi's powerbase and charts the twists and turns of a regime in denial.- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe- Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish- Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera- Check our website: http://www.aljazeera.com/",PT47M16S,2011-12-23,2011-12-23,431311,Libya,/results?search_query=Libya&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKRFFIT2p0bVNxQk1SS3NMNXgwRmdCX28%253D,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,-YwenAKDDHo

My descent into America's neo-Nazi movement & how I got out | Christian Picciolini | TEDxMileHigh,Nonprofits & Activism,1941259,"58,674","3,251","At 14-years-old, Christian Picciolini went from naive teenager to white supremacist, and soon, the leader of America’s first neo-Nazi skinhead gang. How was he radicalized, and how did he ultimately get out? In this courageous talk, Christian shares a surprising and counterintuitive solution to hate in all forms. After leaving the white-supremacist skinhead movement that he helped build in the 1980s and 90s, Christian Picciolini co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people disengage from violent extremism. His memoir, White American Youth: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement—and How I Got Out (Hachette), which details his involvement, and eventual disengagement, from the early American white nationalist movement, will be published on December 26, 2017. Christian lives in Chicago. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

From the Oval Office to Dallas Love Field: White House Correspondent Sid Davis Remembers,Education,14695,110,17,"As White House Correspondent for the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, Sid Davis closely followed President Kennedy on an almost daily basis. In this special presentation, marking the 55th anniversary of the Cuban missile crisis, Davis shared candid memories from two of the most significant stories he covered during the Kennedy years. In October 1962, Davis was in the Oval Office when President Kennedy demanded that Soviet missiles be removed from Cuba. Just over a year later, Davis covered the Kennedy assassination and was one of three journalists to witness the swearing-in of President Johnson aboard Air Force One at Love Field. During his lengthy career as a network journalist, Davis was Washington Bureau Chief for the Westinghouse Broadcasting Company from 1960 to 1978, and then became vice president and Washington Bureau chief for NBC News until 1982. Davis traveled the globe covering, interviewing or directing coverage of nine U.S. presidents.This conversation was moderated by Curator Stephen Fagin and took place on October 23, 2017.

Jim Cramer: Warren Buffett's sale of airline stocks concerns me near term,News & Politics,1670,158,12,"CNBC's Jim Cramer said Monday that legendary investor Warren Buffett gave ""no hope near term"" in his annual shareholder meeting on Saturday with his sale of airline stocks.CNBC’s Jim Cramer said Monday that legendary investor Warren Buffett gave “no hope near term” in his annual shareholders meeting on Saturday with his sale of airline stocks.“Buffett’s overview on airlines really does make me very concerned about the near term,” Cramer said on “Squawk on the Street.” The billionaire investor said Saturday that Berkshire Hathaway had sold all of its airline stocks because of the coronavirus pandemic. The conglomerate previously had investments in United, American, Southwest and Delta Airlines worth roughly $4 billion. Airlines have been one of the major industries most impacted by the pandemic, which has slowed global travel to a trickle. Many airlines negotiated loans from the federal government and have been cutting flights across the country in an attempt to stem losses. “The world has changed for the airlines. And I don’t know how it’s changed and I hope it corrects itself in a reasonably prompt way,” Buffett said during the meeting. Cramer said that he viewed Buffett bailing on airlines as a sign that there were serious issues in the broader economy. “I think they very much are a microcosm of a big chunk of not the U.S. economy, if not the world economy in some cases, as he said,” Cramer said. Major airline stocks were down sharply in early trading after Buffett’s announcement, with United, Delta and American all down more than 10%. To be sure, Buffett was still bullish on the American economy long term.For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2JdMwO7  » Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision» Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC» Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic Turn to CNBC TV for the latest stock market news and analysis.

"Michael Franzese on Joining Mafia, Stealing Millions, John Gotti, Michael Jordan (Full Interview)",Entertainment,3382395,"38,969","1,916","Purchase Micahel Franzese's book here: - https://amzn.to/2KefHAKIn this full interview, Michael Franzese speaks about his life as a former New York mobster and caporegime of the Colombo crime family, where through the gasoline tax rackets in the 1980s he reportedly made more money for a crime family than anyone since Al Capone. During the height of his scheme, Franzese was selling half a billion gallons of fuel a month while earning approximately $10 million a week, all the while keeping the tax revenue for himself which was spread throughout the family. Additionally, due to the substantial profits being made, Franzese was able to sell the gas at the cheapest prices in the city, thus becoming known as the Robin Hood of his community.Elsewhere, he talks about family turmoil where his own father put a hit on him after leaving the mafia, who later was given an 8-year prison sentence after Franzese's brother wore a wire and took the stand against him. Additionally, he mentions how the mafia killed Jimmy Hoffa and extorted J Edgar Hoover, as well as sharing information he heard regarding the mafia's involvement in JFK's assassination. Website:  michaelfranzese.comINSTAGRAM:  @mjfranzese TWITTER:  @MichaelFranzeseFB:  Michael FranzeseFB:  Michael Franzese Ministries Books:  “Blood Covenant,”  “I’ll Make You An Offer You Can’t Refuse!”",PT99M9S,2019-04-25,2019-04-25,434133,djvlad,/channel/UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA,UCg7lal8IC-xPyKfgH4rdUcA,19,rzzXTi9e_5Y

Black Americans Failed by Good Intentions: An Interview with Jason Riley,News & Politics,63268,"1,880",53,"""My beef with the black left is that they want to keep the focus on what government or Washington or politicians or whites in general can do for blacks, instead of what blacks can do for themselves,"" says Jason Riley, author of Please Stop Helping Us: How Liberals Make it Harder for Blacks to Succeed and editorial board member of the Wall Street Journal. In a wide-ranging conversation with Reason TV's Nick Gillespie, Riley praises the Civil Rights acts of the 1960s even as he takes aim at affirmative action in higher education, which he says keeps black graduation rates low even as it increases diversity among freshman classes at various univesities. He also argues that the drug war doesn't explain black-on-black violence and ending it won't transform urban America in the way libertarians insist. His book lays out the case against the minimum wage in a chapter called ""Mandating Unemployment"" and he argues that especially among African Americans, an intact family unit is the best anti-poverty program available.About 20 minutes.Produced by Anthony L.

A Reagan Forum with Judge Jeanine Pirro — 09/05/2018,Nonprofits & Activism,772883,"6,755",344,"Get the story the Fake News media doesn't want you to hear in the #1 New York Times bestseller: a withering indictment of the Deep State plot against Trump and a firsthand account of the real presidency, based on interviews with the Trump family and top administration officials.At this point in American history, we are the victims of a liberal sabotage of the presidency unlike anything we've ever witnessed. Nevertheless President Trump continues to fight every day to keep his promise to Make America Great Again. Today that bold idea has already led to a conservative judge on the Supreme Court, tax reform, and deregulation that has unleashed an economy stronger than anyone could have imagined.But there are dark forces that seek to obstruct and undermine the president and reverse the results of the 2016 presidential election. They are part of a wide-ranging conspiracy that would seem incredible if it weren't being perpetrated openly. Driven by ambition, blinded by greed, and bound by a common goal-to unseat the 45th President of the United States-this cabal is determined to maintain its wrongful hold on national political power.Jeanine Pirro is a highly respected judge, former district attorney, elected politician, sought-after legal commentator, author, and champion of women's rights. Pirro is the host of Justice with Judge Jeanine and for three years hosted Judge Jeanine Pirro, for which she won an Emmy. She also appears regularly as a legal analyst and judicial commentator on Today, Good Morning America, The Early Show, 60 Minutes, CNN, and the Fox News Channel. In 1990, she became the first elected female judge to sit on the Westchester County court bench. In 1993, Judge Pirro was also elected district attorney of Westchester County, once again setting a precedent as the first female to hold that position.

The Imam and the Colonel | Al Jazeera World,News & Politics,432525,"1,817",253,"The downfall of Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi last year was greeted with great hopes for the rebirth of a nation. But there was another hope felt by many inside and outside of the country - that the end of his 42-year rule would allow some light to be shed on the fate of a charismatic Lebanese cleric.Imam Musa al-Sadr, the leader of Lebanon's Shia Muslims, disappeared, along with two companions, in the summer of 1978 during a visit to Libya to meet Gaddafi.As in the Shia myth of the 'hidden imam', this modern-day cleric left his followers upholding his legacy and awaiting his return.The enigmatic cleric's popularity had transcended religions. Calling for social justice and development, in 1974 al-Sadr founded the Movement of the Deprived - aiming to unite people across communal lines. Archbishop Youssef Mounes of Lebanon's Catholic Information Centre remembers a sermon al-Sadr delivered in a church, in which he warned of an imminent sectarian war.""It was a surreal scene,"" Mounes says. ""Seeing the turban of a Muslim imam under the cross in a Christian church. He delivered a sermon at a very significant time.""When civil war erupted in Lebanon in 1975, al-Sadr led anti-war protests. And as the war intensified, so too did al-Sadr's efforts to end it. As part of this, he toured the Arab world to plead the case for south Lebanon.In 1978, this took him to Libya where he was due to meet Gaddafi. He was never seen again. In the years since conflicting stories have emerged about what happened to al-Sadr and his two companions. Now hopes have been raised that new evidence and witnesses will emerge to help solve the mystery of the missing imam.- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/#AlJazeeraEnglish #Gaddafi #Libya",PT48M28S,2012-07-24,2012-07-24,4313,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,tWOzHKm9S3o
Shoshana Zuboff on surveillance capitalism | VPRO Documentary,News & Politics,1711381,"33,697","1,380","Harvard professor Shoshana Zuboff wrote a monumental book about the new economic order that is alarming. ""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,"" reveals how the biggest tech companies deal with our data. How do we regain control of our data? What is surveillance capitalism?In this documentary, Zuboff takes the lid off Google and Facebook and reveals a merciless form of capitalism in which no natural resources, but the citizen itself, serves as a raw material. How can citizens regain control of their data?It is 2000, and the dot.com crisis has caused deep wounds. How will startup Google survive the bursting of the internet bubble? Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin don't know anymore how to turn the tide. By chance, Google discovers that the ""residual data"" that people leave behind in their searches on the internet is very precious and tradable.This residual data can be used to predict the behavior of the internet user. Internet advertisements can, therefore, be used in a very targeted and effective way. A completely new business model is born: ""surveillance capitalism.""Original title: De grote dataroofDirector: Roland DuongResearch: Tom Reijner, Halil Ibrahim ÖzpamukCamera: Adri SchroverSound: Jochem SaleminkEditing: Roland Duong, Paul Delput, Rinze SchuurmanProduction: Marie SchutgensProduction assistant: Britt BenninkImage Editing: Rob Dorrestijn, Paula WitkampOnline Coordinator: Arja van den BerghCommissioning Editors: Bregtje van der Haak, Doke RomeijnOn VPRO broadcast you will find nonfiction videos with English subtitles, French subtitles and Spanish subtitles, such as documentaries, short interviews and documentary series.This channel offers some of the best travel series from the Dutch broadcaster VPRO.

Arguing in favor of the resolution was Richard D. Wolff, an economist at the University of Massachusetts and the author, most recently, of Understanding Marxism. Taking the other side was former Barron's economics editor Gene Epstein, who is also the Soho Forum's co-founder and director. Reason's Nick Gillespie served as moderator.It was an Oxford-style debate, in which the audience votes on the resolution at the beginning and end of the event; the side that gains the most ground is victorious. It was a packed house, with about 450 people in attendance. The pre-debate vote found that 25 percent of the audience agreed that socialism was preferable to capitalism, 49.5 percent picked capitalism as the better system, and 25.5 percent were undecided. Despite a technical problem at the event itself, the Soho Forum was able to recover the final vote totals, which saw support for socialism drop by half a percentage point and support for capitalism increase to 71 percent.Produced by John OsterhoudtPhoto Credit: Brett Raney",PT98M45S,2019-11-14,2019-11-14,145524,ReasonTV,/channel/UC0uVZd8N7FfIZnPu0y7o95A,UC0uVZd8N7FfIZnPu0y7o95A,20,YJQSuUZdcV4

Start with the Kill-A-Watt meter: https://amzn.to/2LOG5BNDIY Solar power may seem like a daunting task.  Fear not, this video WILL set you on the right path.  We start by unraveling the mystery of off-grid solar power and teach you the basics, how to understand and think about your system.  From there, we show you how to access and size the proper system for an off grid back-up or full time off grid system.  Once you've got that squared away, we talk all about batteries.  Of all the components, batteries are probably the most misunderstood.  There are some nuances in solar power that you must be aware of; this video will set you straight on where to mount and how to wire your panels for the best efficiency.  Speaking of efficiency, do you know the difference between an MPPT and PWM solar charge controller?  Just watch the video.  Often the most overlooked component of any off grid system is safety, and for that we've got you covered as well.  Finally, we finish up talking about living with your new system.

Influential writers disparage those interested in considering the relevance of faith to life.Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.   – Richard DawkinsAt DIG & DELVE we hope to provide an open, honest and respectful environment where people can explore reasons why faith makes sense and why it is meaningful to give consideration to the life and teaching of Jesus.   We hope to encourage curiosity and a healthy critical inquisitiveness.   People coming from a spectrum of world-views, Christian and otherwise, are welcome.At DIG & DELVE, we gather talented experts in their fields to come and share their opinions about deep issues human wrestle with and together we discuss some of the latest research around these questions.Expect to be challenged.

“It Shattered My Life”: Former Joe Biden Staffer Tara Reade Says He Sexually Assaulted Her in 1993,News & Politics,433923,"10,536","1,030","In an exclusive Democracy Now! TV/radio broadcast, we speak with Tara Reade, the former staffer in Joe Biden’s Senate office who has come forward with allegations that Biden sexually assaulted her in 1993. Last week, The Intercept reported that the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, set up to help survivors of rape and sexual assault, refused to fund a #MeToo investigation into allegations against Biden. Reade told journalist Katie Halper in an interview published Tuesday that Biden repeatedly touched her without her consent and sexually assaulted her. Reade approached the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund in January looking for assistance, but was reportedly told the fund could not help her because Biden is a candidate for federal office, and pursuing a case could jeopardize the fund’s nonprofit status. Reade says she learned from The Intercept report that the public relations firm representing Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund is SKDKnickerbocker, whose managing director, Anita Dunn, is top adviser to Biden’s presidential campaign.#DemocracyNowDemocracy Now! is an independent global news hour that airs on nearly 1,400 TV and radio stations Monday through Friday.

LIVE market coverage: Monday May 4 Yahoo Finance,News & Politics,3236,135,8,"Get the latest up-to-the-minute continuous stock market coverage and big interviews in the world of finance every Monday–Friday from 9 am to 5pm (ET).#YahooFinance #Stocks #coronaviruscovid19The lineup:9am - 11am: The First Trade11am - 1pm: On The Move1pm - 3pm: The Ticker3pm - 5pm: The Final Round#Stockmarket #coronavirus #YahooFinanceStock futures were lower Friday morning after the latest batch of corporate earnings results suggested a grim outlook for the current quarter and President Donald Trump threatened retaliation on China over the coronavirus pandemic.Earnings results from some of the most heavily weighted companies in the major U.S. stock indices came in mixed after market close Thursday. Amazon (AMZN) posted first-quarter sales that jumped 26% over last year, but warned that $4 billion in expected coronavirus-related costs could drag operating income negative to the tune of $1.5 billion.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) reported quarterly revenue that was virtually flat over last year, and declined to offer an outlook due to uncertainty over the pandemic.Separately, during a briefing Thursday, President Donald Trump said his phase one trade deal with China was now eclipsed by the more imminent reality of the coronavirus pandemic, which originated in the country. Trump has criticized China over its handling of the outbreak and claimed he had seen evidence that the virus was started in a Wuhan lab, though other U.S. officials have downplayed that claim.Despite ending the regular session lower on Thursday, the S&P 500 closed out April on a high note and posted its best monthly gain since 1987. The blue-chip index climbed a total of 12.68% for the month, but was still off 14% from its record high on February 19, and down nearly 10% year to date.“We forecast further gains in most risky assets between now and the end of next year. This reflects our expectation of a rebound in economic activity starting in the second half of 2020, alongside the continuation of massive monetary and fiscal policy support,” John Higgins, chief markets economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a note Thursday.“Admittedly, risky assets have already recovered quite a lot of the ground that they lost after the outbreak of coronavirus. And two key downside risks remain,” he added.“First, success in containing the virus could be reversed as economies reopen. Second, the consensus for policy support might break down,” he said. “But assuming these risks do not materialize, we anticipate that the rally will continue.”Still, equities are entering what has historically been a tougher six-month period in terms of comparable returns.During that time frame, the S&P 500 have averaged returns of just 1.5% during the May through October period since 1950, according to LPL Research data, and ended the period higher just 64.3% of the time. In more recent history, however, stocks produced positive gains in seven of the past eight six-month periods between May and October, and as much as 10% during the similar period in 2013.The recent stock rally comes despite mounting evidence of the damage the coronavirus pandemic and social distancing measures have inflicted on the domestic economy. A government report Thursday showed another 3.8 million Americans filed for new unemployment claims last week, bringing the total over the past six weeks to more than 30 million.But the outbreak at least showed further signs of easing on Thursday, fueling hopes that businesses could slowly begin to open across more jurisdictions and lead to a recovery in economic activity. U.S. coronavirus cases rose just 1.2% on Thursday for the slowest pace of increase of the month, according to Bloomberg and Johns Hopkins compiled data. Overall cases have topped 1.05 million in the U.S. and 3.2 million globally.7:23 a.m. ET Friday: Stock futures fallHere were the main moves in markets ahead of the opening bell, as of 7:24 a.m. ET:S&P 500 futures (ES=F): down 59.5 points, or 2.05%, to 2,843.00Dow futures (YM=F): down 461.00 points, or 1.90%, to 23,769.00Nasdaq futures (NQ=F): down 229.00 points, or 2.55%, to 8,759.5Crude (CL=F): -$0.03 (-0.16%) to $18.81 a barrelGold (GC=F): -$7.00 (-0.41%) to $1,687.20 per ounce10-year Treasury (^TNX): -1.3 bps to yield 0.612%For more on this article visit:https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-...",PT0M0S,2020-05-01,2020-05-01,113244,Yahoo Finance,/channel/UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,UCEAZeUIeJs0IjQiqTCdVSIg,20,EN17r19LemI
