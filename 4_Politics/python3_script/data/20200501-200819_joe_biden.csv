Life in North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,4275337,"46,236","3,123","Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Visiting North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,4358916,"21,324","2,348","Few tourists manage to peek behind the iron curtain of North Korea's dictatorship. But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.Anyone venturing behind the world’s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Urge To Urinate In The Middle of the Night: Expert Urologist Explains,Education,812065,"5,089",426,"Dr. Blaivas explains that getting up in the middle of the night to urinate is called nocturia. Reasons for nocturia include the bladder not holding enough to allow the patient to sleep through the night, and the patient's kidney potentially making more urine than the bladder can hold. Nocturnal polyuria is when too much urine is produced overnight, therefore causing the patient to get up in the middle of the night to urinate.Jerry Blaivas, MD: Getting up in the middle of the night to urinate is called nocturia.  Nocturia is very very common, in fact most people get up once or twice at night to urinate starting in the teenage years even.If you think about it, there is only two possible reasons why someone would get up in the middle of the night to urinate.  One is that their bladder does not comfortably hold enough to allow them to sleep through the night, and, two, you make more urine, that it is to say your kidney is making more urine then your bladder cannot comfortably hold overnight.The second condition, we called nocturnal polyuria.  The nocturnal means nighttime and poly means too much and uria means urine.  So nocturnal polyuria means that you make too much urine overnight and that is probably the commonest cause of nocturia.The most common cause of that even is just drinking too much before you go to sleep.  So if you have a couple of beers or you have wine before dinner and then you take a glass of water with some pills, all of that fluid that you ingest will then overnight be converted by the kidneys to urine and then if you make more urine overnight than your bladder can hold, then of course you have to get up to urinate.So nocturnal polyuria is the commonest cause and the other cause, the bladder not holding enough urine, has many many many causes.  Probably the most common one is, temporary problem is, urinary tract infection.  It can be caused by blockages by the prostate.  It can be caused by bladder cancer, by all kinds of other irritable kind of conditions so thinking back then we have these two different causes, making too much urine at night or the bladder not holding enough at night.  So, then what to do about it.Well the first thing you need to do about it is to diagnose it.  How do we diagnose it? Very - very simply! We have you keep a bladder diary, that is to say you record the time and amount of urine, time and amount of each urination that you make in a 24-hour period, then we simply see how much you urinate at night, how much you urinate for the 24-hours and through some mathematical formula, we can figure out if you are making too much urine at night.Generally, people make less than a third of their urine during sleep hours.  If you make more than that then you have this nocturnal polyuria and we look for the causes of that.  I briefly alluded to what they were in the beginning but now to get more complete, the most common cause is simply drinking too much.Probably the second most common cause is people that take medications at night that can have a diuretic like effect.  Another cause is anything that causes your legs to swell up, so people with varicose veins or from prior surgery, if your leg swell up during the day that the swelling is actually fluid and when you lie down at night, your body resorbs that fluid, that fluid gets into your system and the kidneys make more urine.Another common cause is something called sleep apnea, people who snore, best diagnosed by going to a sleep lab and if you have sleep apnea, then that is what causes the problem and the treatment of the sleep apnea is the problem.The bladders that do not hold enough urine, again we first determine that by the bladder diary and then we look for the common causes, common causes of urinary tract infection, prostatic obstruction, dropped bladder in women, overactive bladder, sometimes bladder cancer, bladder stones, no matter what they cause though, once the diagnosis is clearly understood then treatment of the underlying condition that is causing the nocturia is very often effective, it is usually effective.However, just having nocturia, just getting up at night to urinate by itself does not demand any treatment.So if you get up once or twice at night or three times and you are not bothered by it, there is no need for any treatment at all.  If there is a need for treatment, if you are bothered by it, rest assured there just about always an effective treatment.Learn more about Dr. Blaivas: http://www.urologysite.com/Meet_Our_D...",PT5M12S,2012-11-06,2012-11-06,135335,Best Doctors,/channel/UCqvEALGXtBCFxCVe20e2yaA,UCqvEALGXtBCFxCVe20e2yaA,20,kx30a-fxF54,"Best Doctors' mission is to engage patients and physicians to work together to improve outcomes.

Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s.

But, if you came here to know more about me and what you can get from this channel, hopefully the following information will tickle your nipples...

I come from 5 years experience at Rycotewood Furniture Centre, a furniture school based in Oxford, UK where I learnt everything from basic hand techniques, to material theory, to advanced machining techniques. Alongside this, I also sacrificed my weekends to work at Axminster Tools and Machinery in Basingstoke for 5 years which gave me a deep understanding of tools and manufacturers. But most importantly, what information woodworkers are ACTUALLY SEEKING when it comes to hands on work, or simply buying the right tool for the job. My intensive experience at both Axminster and Rycotewood supplemented each other beautifully over those 5 years.

It's an interesting place because in the middle of the Indian Ocean the depth rises from 2,000 meters to 20 meters.  In some places it's even boat smashing coral reefs so we need to be extra careful with our navigation.  In fact the Team Vestas Volvo Ocean Race boat wrecked very close to here.  As we pick our way through the shallow spots the fish alarm starts hitting BIG!  We're talking multiple hits with Mahi, Tuna, and Wahoo.  We're pulling them in faster than we can filet them.  It's by far the best fishing day we've had in our lives!  We finish the day off with an incredible Sushi dinner courtesy of Babs mad cooking skills.This is our story, a story of three souls sailing around the world.  It is a story about sailing, but it's also a story about the fantastic people we meet and amazing places we see.  It's a story of people living their lives in an alternate way, in close connection with the beautiful people and amazing planet that we call home.

1929 Stock Market Crash and the Great Depression - Documentary,Howto & Style,2659669,"21,255","1,539","Brief History of that other economic designed crash of 1929BBC documentaryOn October 29, 1929, Black Tuesday hit Wall Street as investors traded some 16 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors. In the aftermath of Black Tuesday, America and the rest of the industrialized world spiraled downward into the Great Depression (1929-39), the deepest and longest-lasting economic downturn in the history of the Western industrialized world up to that time.1929 Stock Market CrashDuring the 1920s, the U.S. stock market underwent rapid expansion, reaching its peak in August 1929, after a period of wild speculation. By then, production had already declined and unemployment had risen, leaving stocks in great excess of their real value. Among the other causes of the eventual market collapse were low wages, the proliferation of debt, a struggling agricultural sector and an excess of large bank loans that could not be liquidated.Stock prices began to decline in September and early October 1929, and on October 18 the fall began. Panic set in, and on October 24, Black Thursday, a record 12,894,650 shares were traded. Investment companies and leading bankers attempted to stabilize the market by buying up great blocks of stock, producing a moderate rally on Friday. On Monday, however, the storm broke anew, and the market went into free fall. Black Monday was followed by Black Tuesday (October 29), in which stock prices collapsed completely and 16,410,030 shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange in a single day. Billions of dollars were lost, wiping out thousands of investors, and stock tickers ran hours behind because the machinery could not handle the tremendous volume of trading.1929 Stock Market Crash and the Great DepressionAfter October 29, 1929, stock prices had nowhere to go but up, so there was considerable recovery during succeeding weeks. Overall, however, prices continued to drop as the United States slumped into the Great Depression, and by 1932 stocks were worth only about 20 percent of their value in the summer of 1929. The stock market crash of 1929 was not the sole cause of the Great Depression, but it did act to accelerate the global economic collapse of which it was also a symptom. By 1933, nearly half of America’s banks had failed, and unemployment was approaching 15 million people, or 30 percent of the workforce.#Market #Crash #GeatDepression #documentary_films #Documentary #Full_Documentary #doсumentary #full_doсumentary #Doсumentary_Films #DocumentariesTrading StrategiesLive Trade CoachingBinary OptionsCFD'sFuturesEquitiesCommoditiesFX",PT58M36S,2018-07-06,2018-07-06,122552,TradingCoachUK,/channel/UC5N-VmtsksN1xfPV1sdB__g,UC5N-VmtsksN1xfPV1sdB__g,20,qlSxPouPCIM,,37957321,0,127000,False,74

Encountering Storm Force 10,Sports,2227718,"31,459","1,575","Hi everyone!I would never believe the most scary yet beautiful sailing experince in my 27 years of sailing would happen in the waters right outside my hometown!I want to state that I under no circumstandses encourage anyone to head out in a storm force 10. On the other hand I will say that this is an amazing way to build confidence in yourself and your yacht.But to do this you will have to trust your boat and gear 100%, and make sure she can take it. To get to that level you will have to try in more and more wind and waves and observe how the boat, and not the least yorself, copes in the different conditions. And when the day comes you will at some time man up and go for it.If you dont trust yourself and the boat, but still force yourself to try, you  will most lightly have a very frightening experience that will sit with you for a long time, maybe ruining your joy for the sport.So go prepeared.Anyway, step onboard and join me for this insane offshore rollercoaster ride!ErikT-shirts and merch: https://shop.spreadshirt.no/nbjs-factoryFacebook:  https://www.facebook.com/nobullshitju...Instagram:  https://www.instagram.com/erikaanderaa/Patreon:  https://www.patreon.com/user?u=314665...Linkedin:  https://www.linkedin.com/in/erik-aand...",PT23M10S,2019-09-27,2019-09-27,144315,Erik Aanderaa,/channel/UCUH6fLsV6J7WKEmf7vJKfAw,UCUH6fLsV6J7WKEmf7vJKfAw,20,VxthF9o9k0Y,"Follow my adventures across the North Atlantic ocean as I sail my little boat alone wherever I go, seeking strong winds and high waves.

Shoulder Pain Relief Stretches – 5 Minute Real Time Routine,Sports,246541,"5,608",110,"These shoulder pain relief stretches are great for helping to relieve general shoulder pain and shoulder tightness. The shoulder stretches are done in real time, so they are easy to follow. Buy a worksheet with these shoulder stretches: https://www.askdoctorjo.com/7-shoulde...In general when stretching the shoulders, you should hold most stretches for 30 seconds, and do them 3 times. Sometimes you might not have enough time to go through your whole routine, which can be time consuming. If you are in a hurry, still hold the shoulder stretches for 30 seconds, but do less reps.A quick warm up will help warm up and loosen the shoulder muscles to help get them going.A great way to stretch the shoulder is by stretching out the joint capsule. You can stretch the posterior capsule or a cross arm stretch, and you can stretch the inferior capsule with a triceps stretch.Also, stretching some of your rotator cuff muscles, like the subscapularis may help relieve the shoulder pain. If going into external rotation of your shoulder is painful, you can modify this stretch.Finally, a chest or pec stretch and an upper trap stretch will help the shoulder and neck areas.Related Videos:Shoulder Pain Treatment & Rehab Stretches:https://youtu.be/DJvQ3ZGWUfQ?list=PLP...Shoulder Pain Top 3 Exercises:https://youtu.be/vbUm5rsPt5Y?list=PLP...===========================================Dr. Jo is a licensed Physical Therapist and Doctor of Physical Therapy.SUPPORT Ask Doctor Jo on Patreon for as little as $1 a month, and get cool rewards: http://www.patreon.com/askdoctorjo===========================================Shoulder Pain Relief Stretches – 5 Minute Real Time Routine:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jHsr...https://www.askdoctorjo.com/shoulder-...DISCLAIMER: This content (the video, description, links, and comments) is not medical advice or a treatment plan and is intended for general education and demonstration purposes only.

Here you'll learn how to make, knead and shape the dough before topping with delicious Parma ham and fresh rocket for a simple yet delicious meal!-------------------------------------------------------------------Ingredients(makes 2 x large pizzas) For the dough 500g strong flour 5g salt 10g fresh yeast 325ml lukewarm water Topping for Margherita 150g tinned chopped tomatoes or tomato passata Salt & pepper 1 x tablespoons extra virgin olive oil & extra for drizzling 1 x tablespoon grated parmesan cheese 1 x ball mozzarellaA few fresh basil leavesTopping for Prosciutto & Rocket Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling 1 x ball mozzarella1 x tablespoon grated parmesan 4 x slices of Parma ham Handful of rocket Juice of ½ lemon Method First make the dough. Dissolve the yeast in the lukewarm water. Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Gradually add the yeast mixture, mixing well until you obtain a dough. Place dough on a lightly floured work surface and knead for about 10 minutes. Cover with a cloth or cling film and leave to rest in a warm place for at least 30 minutes until the dough has doubled in size.  Preheat the oven to 220 degrees centigrade.  Take the dough, knock it back, then divide into two pieces, cover each with a cloth and leave to rest in a warm place for a further 30 minutes.  Meanwhile prepare the toppings.  For the Margherita, place tomatoes or passata in a small bowl, season with salt & pepper and stir in 1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil.  Roughly chop the mozzarella.  Sprinkle some flour onto a clean work surface and with your fingers spread each piece of dough into a roughly round shape with a border, make the dough as thin as you can but be careful not to tear it. Sprinkle some semolina or flour onto 2 large flat baking trays and place the pizza bases on them.  Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over each base. On one, spread the tomato mixture evenly over, sprinkle with parmesan, scatter a few basil leaves over and top with mozzarella. On the other base, arrange mozzarella and parmesan all over, top with Parma ham.  Place both pizzas into the hot oven and bake for 8 – 10 minutes.  In the meantime, toss the rocket in a little extra virgin olive oil and lemon juice.  Remove the pizzas from the oven, top the Parma ham pizza with rocket and serve immediately.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Learn more about our partnership with Gennaro Contaldo: http://bit.ly/GennaroCitalia Click this link to Subscribe to our channel so you don't miss anything that Gennaro has in store for you: http://bit.ly/CitaliaYouTube Please visit http://bit.ly/Citalia if you are thinking about planning your next Italian getawayFollow Citalia Holidays on:Facebook: http://facebook.com/citaliaholidaysInstagram: http://instagram.com/citalia_holidaysTwitter: http://twitter.com/citalia_holiday",PT7M49S,2015-12-09,2015-12-09,122433,Citalia,/channel/UCzzzZ3-icktxbC3j7hkWqRw,UCzzzZ3-icktxbC3j7hkWqRw,20,n-VRntrbypI,"With over 85 years of heritage, we pride ourselves on our knowledge and expertise of Italy.

He’s also a defender of the President, (his book The Case For Trump spent weeks on the best seller lists in 2019), and a close observer of the scientific and medical communities. These disparate interests and fields of study give him very unique perspectives and insights on the current COVID-19 crisis. We discuss the current situation with him in great detail, including the difficulties encountered by farmers, by research scientists and doctors, why some areas of the country are affected more than others, his theories about when the virus actually appeared in the U.S. and finally, what plagues of the ancient world can teach us about how to best manage and get past the situation the entire world finds itself in.

Victor Davis Hanson on “The Case For Trump”,News & Politics,2370525,"27,926","2,027","Recorded on April 1, 2019. How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trump’s “personal authenticity” during the campaign and how the media has a “historical amnesia” of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trump’s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didn’t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in California’s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how that’s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

Stick to the recipe rigidly, the quantities are very important for successful results2.  Use scales for the measurements including the water, don't convert to cups or measuring jugs, they are too inaccurate 3.  Use proper white bread flour with at least 12% protein, check the ingredients list on the side of the flour bag, protein may show in grams per serving but just work it out, it needs to be 12g of protein per 100g of flour, plain or all purpose flour is not strong enough for making bread. 4.  Check your yeast is working you can do a yeast test as shown in my sandwich bread video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpSb... Any problems or inquiries I'm always here to help.

Learning about my ancestry and discovering some of my taste preferences, and comparing them with my Dad, was fascinating. He and I both had a great time meeting and eating. We happen to be traveling in Ghana, and my Dad happened to be in Nairobi, Kenya for a few days having some meetings, so I thought it would be a perfect opportunity, to meet my Dad. Luckily it all worked out smoothly!Accra, GhanaWaakye - 8 GHC ($1.80) - Waakye is a popular Ghanaian food / meal, and that’s what we started the day with. You get rice and beans, a number of other starches, and some tomato sauce stew and meats, all piled high into a leaf bowl. It was delicious!Makola Market - Next we visited Makola Market, the largest and most energetic market in Accra. It’s a must visit, to see the energy and life at the market.The Accra Arts Center - Finally, we stopped off at the Accra Arts Center to buy a few things before leaving in at night.Accra to Nairobi - We had a late night flight, and we landed early at sunrise to cool Nairobi!After checking into a hotel just for 1 night, we took a quick hour nap, and then jumped into a taxi to go meet my Dad who was staying at a guesthouse.It was great to see my Dad and at the guesthouse we compared our ancestry and our taste preference. Then we went to go eat some Kenyan food, which was a highlight. Now do you know where I got my love for food from?Java House coffee - Finally, as you already know, I have a tendency to enjoy caffeine, and so does my Dad.

After graduating from university, I decided to travel for food. Eventually I ended up in Thailand, where I met my wife. My wife and I are now based in Bangkok, Thailand, but we travel frequently to find delicious food.

You'll find street food videos, travel vlogs, and plenty of Thai food videos as that's where I'm based.

"Street Food in Brazil - RIO DE JANEIRO Brazilian Food + Attractions in Rio, Brazil!",Travel & Events,4043120,"73,626","2,165","Go check out Guilherme (Rio4Fun): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKj...Bangkok to Rio de Janeiro: https://youtu.be/SA-SromGdGgSubscribe http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every weekT-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1lStreet Food in Brazil - Rio de Janeiro! #Brazil #RioDeJaneiro #BrazilianFood #streetfoodEver since I first learned about the city of Rio de Janeiro when I was a kid growing up, I have wanted to visit. Finally, the time has come. In this Brazilian street food tour in Rio de Janeiro, we’ll go to eat some of the best street food snacks and dishes, some hole in the wall style Brazilian food restaurants, and also visit some of the most unbelievable and gorgeous sights and attractions in Rio de Janeiro. It’s one of the most beautiful cities I’ve ever visited.Here’s the Brazilian food and things we did:Mineiro, Sausage Sandwich - 5 BRL ($1.26) - For Brazilian breakfast we headed to Mineiro for his neighborhood grilled sausage sandwich, topped with his house made aioli dressing, cheese, and lettuce, and his own home-made chili sauce. He’s not only an amazing guy, but his sausage sandwich is outstanding. When you’re in Rio de Janeiro, you don’t want to miss it. Located just outside Siqueira Campos MRT Metro station (Map: https://goo.gl/maps/EXRj3LPihezUd5EKA), sets up in the morning about 7 am.Trem do Corcovado - 65 BRL ($16.44) - Christ the Redeemer - I pre-bought tickets online for the tram, so when we arrived we just picked up and printed the tickets. The tram took about 20 minutes and Christ The Redeemer at the top was breathtaking.Selaron Steps - Another attraction in Rio de Janeiro that I wasn’t going to miss was the Selaron Steps, created by Chilean artist Selaron. They are so cool and so iconic.Lunch at Bar Rex - For some seriously meaty Brazilian food, Bar Rex is the spot. They serve an major selection of drinks, but they also specialize in food like roasted chicken, sausages, and the oxtail. The food was outstanding, and the owners are just so cool. Location: https://goo.gl/maps/ZeshTp5D3ggLoGx87Ipanema Beach - World famous, one of the most well known beaches in the world, and for a good reason - the scenery is spectacular. We had a tea with Marcelo (5 BRL ($1.26) and then tried some of the Brazilian local favorite comfort Biscoito Globo cassava snacks. Finally, another iconic Brazilian drink is the caipirinha (15 BRL ($3.79) made on the beach.Copacabana Beach - Next up on this Brazilian street food and attractions tour we stopped at the famous Copacabana Beach and had a coconut (6.50 BRL ($1.64) and continued on the Red Beach in Urca to get a good view of Sugarloaf Mountain (Pão de Açúcar).Bar Urca - Also in Urca, you’ll find Bar Urca, an old food and bar establishment that’s famous for serving empada de camarão (6.50 BRL ($1.64), shrimp filled pastries. Many people order and then sit on the edge of the water in the evening.

The owner of Bar Gato de Botas is a legend and his plates of Brazilian food are delicious.

When you order a kebab, you can get it stopped with cassava powder and drenched in hot sauce - it was so good.

Hey, I'm Mark Wiens!

After graduating from university, I decided to travel for food. Eventually I ended up in Thailand, where I met my wife. My wife and I are now based in Bangkok, Thailand, but we travel frequently to find delicious food.

You'll find street food videos, travel vlogs, and plenty of Thai food videos as that's where I'm based.

I hope you're ready for a delicious food adventure!

Subscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/9CwQhg For copyright matters please contact us at: david.f@valnetinc.com He’s a world famous chef and a television celebrity. He has restaurants all across the world and is best known for his fiery temper and expletive-laden rants. Of course, we’re talking about none other than Gordon Ramsay. We’ve already shown you some facts you didn’t know about this Scottish-born chef. Now it’s time to show you 10 ridiculously expensive things he owns. Naturally, you’d expect someone of Ramsay’s wealth to own property and we have a bunch of it, all starting with his London home. Of course, inside this home you’d expect to find a fully equipped and expensive kitchen. You won’t be disappointed. Across the pond, Ramsay has planted roots in the US with the purchase of a multi-million dollar LA home. Not one to take public transit, we’ll show you his car collection, beginning with his Ferrari F12. Time for a vacation? There’s always Ramsay’s new Cornwall vacation home which set him back several million dollars. Then there’s the chef’s love of football, or soccer as we know it. He may not own the whole team, but it made headlines in the UK when Ramsay bought shares in his boyhood team, Rangers F.C. There’s also Gordon’s second vacation home in Cornwall which he purchased as a backup while the original vacation home was being fully renovated. Back in the garage, his love of Ferrari is pretty obvious thanks to his ownership of two Ferrari LaFerrari’s, priced at over a million dollars each. Of course, celebrity is nothing without the bling and Ramsay has a few watches to talk about. We’ll keep it classy by looking at the Rolex that made the news. Finally, no discussion of Gordon Ramsay’s expensive things would be complete without going over his restaurant and entertainment empire.

It wasn’t long ago that the world braced itself for another Great Depression. It was the defining moment of the 1980's. The New York Stock Exchange, the epicenter of the world financial markets and backbone of American capitalism, was under siege. On October 19th, 1987, the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 508 points, the largest single day drop in the history of the stock market. But it was on Tuesday, October 20th that the world's financial markets came within 5 minutes of total disintegration. How was it averted?  Was it a miracle?  Manipulation? Or a lucky trade? Cancel Crash depicts the dramatic events that saved the world from financial anarchy and presents for the first time what actually happened on Terrible Tuesday. Framed between the opening bell on Friday, October 16h to the closing bell of Terrible Tuesday, the story unfolds as the perilous clock ticks, revealing those who prevented a global Depression and saved our financial markets.======== tastytrade.com ========Finally a financial network for traders, built by traders.

The Abandoned Village Of Chagos- Sailing SV Delos Ep. 89,Travel & Events,811414,"6,859",266,"The crew goes on a fishing expedition to the south end of Saloman Atoll in the remote Chagos archipelago and discovers an abandoned village vacated by the Chagosians over 50 years ago.  Even though the village has an eerie vibe to it the chance to explore such an amazing place is just too much to pass up.  We move Delos from our anchorage at Fuequet Island to Baddam Island to begin our exploration.  In one of the abandoned ruined houses we find an old DVD disc, laying in the dirt,  that details the history of the Chagosian people and how they were forcibly removed from their home and exiled from their islands.  It's a crazy, crazy story.....  There are lot's of abandoned buildings, camps, rubbish, and of course massive Coconut Crabs running around.  During our time at Baddam the BIOT patrol boat shows up and invites us over for a BBQ on their massive ship.  We have a hell of a party and end up spending the night.  Good times were had by all!This is our story, a story of three souls sailing around the world.  It is a story about sailing, but it's also a story about the fantastic people we meet and amazing places we see.

Ebola Survivor - Dr. Ian Crozier,Education,324073,,,"Dr. Ian Crozier contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone while treating Ebola patients in the government hospital in Kenema as a volunteer for the World health Organization. He was evacuated to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia on Sept. 9, 2014, the third American with Ebola to be airlifted there from West Africa. He spent an agonizing 40 days in the hospital before finally recovering.  Less than two months later, he developed soaring pressure in his left eye, with nausea and headaches. Test results were completely unexpected: the inside of his left eye was teeming with Ebola.  Dr. Crozier, who also suffers from hearing loss, joint and muscle pain, disabling fatigue, problems with memory loss and word-finding, calls himself a poster child for “post-Ebola syndrome”.

North Korea - All the dictator's men | DW Documentary,Education,5532803,"38,375","3,098","North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim’s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers. Come and meet all the dictator’s men.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Meet the KEBAB KINGS of IRAN!! 🇮🇷SWORD CHOPPED Meat-Madness in Bonab! 🥩,Travel & Events,1837882,"29,146","1,545","😃Follow Mr. Taster: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMrtas...🎥Street Food in Tabriz, Iran: https://youtu.be/e-6dh8HrwxI👕T-shirts and caps: https://migrationology.com/store/BONAB, IRAN - Ask around in Iran where the best kebabs are, and a likely response you’ll get quite quickly is Bonab. Bonab is a city known throughout Iran for their kebabs. Located in Northern Iran, there was no way we were going to miss an opportunity of a lifetime to eat Bonab kebabs from their source. #Iran #IranianFood #kebabs #streetfoodIt was about a 2 hour drive from Tabriz, but it was well worth it. We jumped out of the van, and entered the Bonab market. Eventually we came to the meat section of the market. What’s unique about the Bonad meat market is that you can buy fresh meat, and then bring it to one of the kebab restaurants within the market, and they will immediately on spot make for you fresh kebabs. And in a country that lives of kebabs, Bonab kebabs are special. It’s one of the only places in Iran, where they hand chop your meat using swords, mix it with onions and seasonings, form the kebabs, and grill them, all in one little closet sized Iranian street food restaurant. What truly makes a difference is the hand sword chopped mince of the meat so its not too fine, but remains steaky.The kebabs were grilled fresh and hot and served dripping in their own fatty juices, and served with roasted tomatoes and chilies. The combination was heavenly, some of the best and most pure kebabs I’ve tasted anywhere in the world. The freshness speaks for itself, and again, the hand ground chopped texture makes all the difference.Bonab, Iran, truly is the King of kebabs in Iran!Thank you to Ghasr Setareh (https://www.instagram.com/ghasr_setareh/) for arranging our trip to Iran.Friends in the video:Mr. Taster: https://www.instagram.com/mr.taster/Persia Tour Guide: https://www.instagram.com/persiatourg...Rambod: https://www.instagram.com/rambod_rast...Ali: https://www.instagram.com/alimojarad/🎵MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdohttps://www.audionetwork.com/——————————————————🍌Banana Chips are available now worldwide!!https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/📷Camera gear I use:https://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video...——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",PT27M27S,2020-03-11,2020-03-11,122432,Mark Wiens,/channel/UCyEd6QBSgat5kkC6svyjudA,UCyEd6QBSgat5kkC6svyjudA,19,kaza-2tGcJs,"Food is the reason you should travel, and on my channel you'll watch videos that feature incredibly delicious food and travel tips.

How to deal with gaslighting | Ariel Leve,Education,1427552,"32,042","1,627","Gaslighting is an emotionally abusive tactic that makes the victim question their own sanity and perception of reality.

And when he borrowed his mom’s car to go get a slushie one day last August, he found himself being pulled over by the Louisville Metro Police Department's Ninth Mobile Division for the most minor of traffic violations — making a ""wide turn"" onto another street.Before he was let go 25 minutes later, he was pulled from his car, frisked and handcuffed. His car was searched by a drug-sniffing dog, then by police officers who went through his wallet and even looked under the lid of his drink for contraband.He was forced to stand on the street, embarrassed, as traffic drove by, with the cuffs chafing his wrists, as one officer asked him, ""Why do you have this negative view towards the police?""Nearly 1 million people have since viewed a video of the traffic stop on Social Media, and more than 17,000 have commented on it.

The food, people, culture, and ancient bazaar were all the highlights. In this video, we take you on a Iranian street food tour of the ancient bazaar of Tabriz. #Iran #Tabriz #streetfoodBazaar of Tabriz - A UNESCO World Heritage Site, and one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East, it’s also one of the best preserved and most authentic. What was amazing to me is how it’s still in full functioning use, still used in much of the same exact way as its been used for hundreds of years. There are sections of the bazaar for everything - from spices and food, clothes and woodwork. But one of the most fascinating parts of the bazaar is the carpets bazaar, where you’ll find some of the best hand made Persian carpets in the world. Tabriz is known around the world for its exquisite carpet making.Tabriz Central Mosque - Bazaar of Tabriz - In addition to the amazing Iranian food, we also visited the Tabriz Central Mosque.Haj Ali Kebab - One of the most famous and best restaurants in Tabriz is Haj Ali Kebab, where you’ll find some of the best kebabs in Tabriz. The kebabs were so incredibly juicy, especially with Persian style butter rice, and some roasted tomatoes and sumac. It was a wonderful lunch within the ancient bazaar.Shazdeh Restaurant - Along with plenty of street food snacks, our final Iranian food meal at the bazaar was at Shazdeh Restaurant, and one dish you can’t miss are the kufta Tabrizi, one of the ultimate dishes of Tabriz.It was an amazing day, and a throwback in time, learning about and discovering the ancient bazaar of Tabriz, Iran!Thank you to Ghasr Setareh (https://www.instagram.com/ghasr_setareh/) for arranging our trip to Iran.Friends in the video:Mr. Taster: https://www.instagram.com/mr.taster/Persia Tour Guide: https://www.instagram.com/persiatourg...Rambod: https://www.instagram.com/rambod_rast...Ali: https://www.instagram.com/alimojarad/🎵MUSIC: https://goo.gl/HwVjdohttps://www.audionetwork.com/——————————————————🍌Banana Chips are available now worldwide!!https://m.me/BananaJoe?ref=MarkWiens👕Get t-shirts and caps:https://migrationology.com/store/📷Camera gear I use:https://kit.co/markwiens/camera-video...——————————————————📱FOLLOW:Instagram: https://instagram.com/migrationologyFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/migrationology",PT43M22S,2020-03-08,2020-03-08,134321,Tabriz,/results?search_query=Tabriz&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKNFNtRVd4Y0ZHa0FSLXpNUzhzWWR5MWs%253D,UCyEd6QBSgat5kkC6svyjudA,19,e-6dh8HrwxI,"Food is the reason you should travel, and on my channel you'll watch videos that feature incredibly delicious food and travel tips.

Soon dubbed ‘Spanish Flu’ after its effects were reported in the country’s newspapers, the virus rapidly spread across much of the globe to become one of the worst natural disasters in human history.

Kicking and Screaming: WSJ’s Kim Strassel on the Media vs. Trump,News & Politics,952173,"16,979","1,766","Recorded on April 9, 2020.As a columnist for the Wall Street Journal and a commentator for Fox News, Kim Strassel is a card-carrying member of the mainstream media. But Strassel is appalled by the media’s treatment of Donald Trump, and not just from journalists from the left. She describes the “resistance” in detail in her recent book, Resistance (at All Costs): How Trump Haters Are Breaking America. She and Peter Robinson discuss the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 crisis and the way the media has covered it and disseminated the information to the public. They also discuss the upcoming presidential election (yes, we are still having one) and the politics of the $2 trillion stimulus bill, with more spending on the way, and the realities of restarting the economy in a post- or partial-post-COVID-19 world. Finally, they discuss the pluses and minuses of Donald Trump’s temperament, and the possibility of something good coming from this current crisis.

From London Apartment to Living on a Boat Full Time - Minimalist Life,Howto & Style,385767,"5,139",248,"Anna and Kath are a UK couple who work full time in London.  In 2016 they downsized their life from a 1-bedroom apartment down to a narrow boat which they live and travel on, full-time, with their 2 cats, Munchkin and Alice.When their boat is moored, they have access to water and electricity; and when they're cruising the canals of England and the UK, they have solar panels to trickle charge their batteries and keep things like the fridge and TV running.They have a multi-fuel stove for heat, and an extra radiator in the bedroom although they rarely use it because the stove heats the tiny house so well.They have a 500 litre water tank for their freshwater needs and are hoping to invest in a composting toilet so they don't have to use chemicals in their current cassette toilet.Anna and Kath have found that they get to spend more time together, and they spend less money now that they've adopted a simpler, more minimalist lifestyle.They still work full-time in London but are working to transition to a digital nomad situation with revenue from their YouTube channel, The Narrowboat Experience, by selling Annamarie's paintings, and with support on Patreon.

Of course, whatever the official rule for boat traffic is, you must avoid hitting the other boat :)3. Navigation rule 4: The Wale: when sailing in the night, most motor boats (except a few exceptions mentioned in the navigation rules book) still have to avoid you (they see on the lights a sailboat has that you are sailing).

I did not like my life at all and after a long decision making process I decided to take a jump in the deep. I sold my house and stored my stuff and found a job opportunity in South Africa. A world I never could have imagined opened up for me, traveling and working at the same time. Before heading back to my home country, The Netherlands, I started an ""acting for theatre and film"" evening course, with the intention to learn to become a better presenter in business. As I was still pursuing what I thought I was supposed to do, business. To my surprise I really enjoyed the acting training and decided to change my idea of what I was supposed to do and what not and continued an acting school in NYC. When finished studying, my application for a US work visa was denied because I didn't already have proof of many jobs done in the industry (of course not! I was just starting out). A friend of mine was into sailing and through him I found out that people sailed around the world and made money by making YouTube videos. I knew nothing about sailing, but #travel around the world was always my dream and sailing on other peoples boats seemed a cheap and adventurous way to achieve that. I fell in love with making a #travelvlog and have never stopped doing it since. I lived a year on sailing boats #sailingaroundtheworld but after crossing the pacific I felt it was time to do something else. I cycled New Zealand from top to bottom, drove a $200 motorbike through South-East Asia, sold it for $300 and drove a van from Kyrgyzstan to Pakistan which I then shipped to Argentina to drive to Alaska doing the vanlife.

And also not successful at all! I decided to store my stuff and jump in the deep and got myself a job in South Africa for 6 months. Those 6 months turned into a year where I did an acting evening course to become a better presenter in business. I liked the acting so much that I continued studying it in NYC. Then my work visa got denied because I didn't have work experience in the acting field (of course not, I was just starting out!), so I decided to combine what I learned with my long-term dream of traveling!

Usually these questions come from patients who are dealing with pain either in their necks or lower backs.These conditions can be limiting and debilitating on so many levels; one thing that is often affected his sleep.Today I wanted to share with you five tips to ensure you are getting your best sleep possible even despite1. The best sleeping position for you is one that is comfortable and holds your spine in the correct posture: The bottom line is the best sleeping position for you is which ever position you find to be the most comfortable while keeping your spine in as neutral a position as possible. Make sure you are aware of your spine alignment front to back, side to side, as well as if you are rotating or not.2. To get the right posture you need the right support: In order to achieve a correct, neutral spine posture, you need to have the right support from your mattress and from your pillow.Mattress: It is recommended that you replace your mattress every 8-10 years. If patients come to me who wake up with pain/stiffness in their spine often they’re sleeping on an older mattress. If it’s been a decade since you got a new mattress it might be time.Pillow: I make pillow recommendations based solely on two things - body type and sleeping posture. I would recommend a different pillow for someone with a petite frame versus a larger frame. Similarly, it you slept primarily on your back my recommendation would be different than if you slept primarily on your side.3. Stomach Sleep: DON’T DO IT! This is the worst of all the postures you can sleep in through the night. It maximally rotates your neck all night, it puts your lower back in an extended position, and it puts pressure on your internal organs. Stop sleeping on your stomach.4. Side Sleepers: Again the goal is to achieve as close to neutral spine as possible. This is achieved with proper support for your head/neck, torso, and hips/legs.Head and neck: you want a pillow that supports your neck in a neutral position. If your pillow is too full your neck will be bent too much up towards the ceiling. If your pillow is too flat your head will be bent too much down towards your bed. Try to find the right pillow to achieve a neutral spine position.Torso: Again, this is where the right mattress comes into play. It needs to be firm enough to support the side of your trunk but soft enough to unload your shoulders and hips (areas of higher pressure). You can also get small pillows designed specifically to achieve this goal. Click here to see these pillows:Hips: Oftentimes when we sleep on our sides our top leg rests on top of our bottom leg putting pressure on your knees, pulling on your hips, and pulling your spine out of alignment. My solution here is to sleep with a pillow between your knees to unload stress at all three of these areas. You can even get pillows that specifically go between your legs that are intended for side sleepers; check out this link to get yours:5. Back sleepers: Back sleepers are typically a little more prone to snoring, but if you can handle that it’s a really good position for your back! Again, the whole goal here will be getting your spine into a correct position and supporting it there.Head and neck: Again - you want just the right amount of support to maintain your head/neck at the correct angle. If your pillow is too full, you’ll spend all night with your neck flexed up. If your pillow is too flat, you’ll spend all night with your head extended and your neck unsupported. Typically your pillow should be smaller if you sleep on your back than it would be if you preferred to sleep on your side.Hips: Oftentimes laying out flat on our backs puts a lot of stress on our lower back due to hip flexors pulling on our spine. I always recommend that if you sleep on your back you do so with 1-2 pillows under your knees to unload some pressure in your spine. You can also buy different wedge-shaped pillows designed specifically for this purpose.

TV Journalist Quits His Job to Live on a Tiny House Boat & Cruise UK Canals Full-Time,People & Blogs,3821042,"46,166","1,461","In this video, we meet David Johns, a former TV journalist from the UK who quit his job, sold his house, and bought a narrowboat to cruise the canal network.  His plan was to try being a live aboard for a year. He’s been living aboard for 9 months so far and he’s still happy with his decision and loves being part of the friendly, helpful narrowboat community.  Watch this video to take a tour of David's narrowboat, learn how he earns an income as a freelance journalist, where he “parks” his boat, and about the joys & challenges of life afloat.David has been documenting his journey living on a boat with a regular vlog on his YouTube channel: Cruising the Cut (https://www.youtube.com/CruisingTheCutUK).  With his experience as a TV journalist, the videos are extremely well filmed and edited, and they're a real pleasure to watch.We were excited when he sent us his interview footage because we learned so much about this alternative lifestyle that he’s trying out. We love the idea of living in a tiny house on the water and of being able to explore from the comfort of your own home (a lot like living in a van!).Thanks for watching!Mat & Danielle-------------------------------------------------------------STAY IN TOUCH!------------------------------------------------------------Blog: www.exploringalternatives.caFacebook: /exploringalternativesblogInstagram: @exploringalternativesMusic & Song Credits: All music in this video was composed, performed, and recorded by Mat of Exploring Alternatives.Filming Credit:All footage in this video was filmed by David Johns from Cruising the Cut: https://www.youtube.com/CruisingTheCutUK",PT18M49S,2016-09-03,2016-09-03,111524,Exploring Alternatives,/channel/UC8EQAfueDGNeqb1ALm0LjHA,UC8EQAfueDGNeqb1ALm0LjHA,19,yMKJR5n4gLw,"We want Exploring Alternatives to be a hub of alternative living video content that will inform and inspire you.  

Each week, we post a new video about people who are living in tiny houses, vans, RVs, and boats; and people who are exploring long-term travel, minimalism, zero waste living, off-grid living, and more.  We also sometimes share videos about our own lifestyle experiments.
