Dr Fauche took her paper on HIV AIDs and rewrote it taking credit and getting patents on it. This delay caused the virus to spread more quickly \"killing millions\"2. Individual goverment employees are allowed to patent vaccines that tax payers have paid for.\u00a03. She's not anti-vaccine but claims No RNA vaccines work.\u00a04. Covid 19 was altered either in North Carolina or Wuhan\u00a05. Covid 19 Death numbers are not accurate because they aren't testing6. Hospitals are incentivized to put Covid on the death certificate. 13k from medicare for the hospital, 39k with ventilator.7. A current Flu vacine\u00a0used in Italy causes users to become more susceptible to all coronaviruses.\u00a08.

Learn more about their subscription here: https://mscbd.fm/fstptmAcdsee Photo Studio Professional 2020: https://www.acdsee.com/en/products/ph...In this video, Patrick Hall of Fstoppers walks you through an entire engagement session photoshoot. Even though this session takes place on the beach, all of these techniques can be used no matter what sort of environment you are shooting in. This photography session focuses around using the FujiFilm X-T3 camera, the 16 - 55mm f 2.8 zoom lens, the 90mm f 2.0, and the 50 - 140 f 2.8  zoom lens. This combo of camera and lenses works well for outdoor portraits because FujiFilm handles skin tones really well and also is easily able to capture super wide dynamic range scenes like you would find at the beach. When the light gets too dark or you want more dramatic effect, Patrick uses the powerful and portable Profoto B10 strobe. This strobe is super useful for lighting up a scene and because the battery is built right into the unit, it's super easy for an assistant or friend to hold while you capture epic looking images. All of this gear can easily fit in the Manfrotto Manhattan Mover30 backpack. This backpack is great because not only does it look like a slick urban style backpack, but it also easily converts from a photo backpack with dividers to a normal backpack when you remove the inside shell. Finally, all the images in this video were edited using Acdsee's Photo Studio Professional 2020. This powerful software lets you cull, edit your raw files, and add artistic effects to each of your images quickly and easily. The top comment in our videos is often \"what is the music at timestamp\"?  Every song in this video is from the music licensing website Musicbed.  If you ever need a soundtrack or atmospheric music for a video, tutorial, or slideshow, Musicbed is your one stop shop for finding the perfect song for your project.",

            "description": "We've all experienced awkward moments, but for those in the public eye, one awkward moment could be witnessed by millions. Of course, Meghan Markle is no stranger to having all eyes on her. As a former commoner learning the ropes of royal behavior, the new duchess has already experienced quite a few awkward moments for all the world to see.Meghan Markle is usually on her best behavior, but the duchess was once captured having a giggle fit in church, of all places. In March 2018, at the Commonwealth Day service in Westminster Abbey, One Direction singer Liam Payne took to the stage to perform John Mayer\u2019s hit song, \"Waiting on the World to Change.\" As his performance came to an end, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were captured sharing a knowing glance as the rest of the audience applauded, with Harry raising his eyebrows and Meghan erupting in laughter.Were they laughing because they disliked the performance? It's impossible to say. Nevertheless, the two were literally caught giggling in church. It may have been an awkward moment, but it was a pretty funny one, too.During Meghan Markle\u2019s engagement to Prince Harry, the soon-to-be royal was tasked with presenting awards at the Endeavour Fund ceremony. The organization, founded by Prince Harry in 2012, provides support for sick, wounded, and injured members of the military, and recognizes outstanding servicemen and women with awards each year. And while this event usually goes off without a hitch, the 2018 ceremony experienced a few hiccups.While the duchess stood on stage with a co-presenter, there appeared to be a mix-up with the notes. After rifling through his papers for what seemed like forever, the poor guy tried to salvage the awkward situation with a joke. Although her stage partner was visibly flustered by the whole ordeal, Meghan swooped in and tried to deflect some of the tension with a few laughs, encouraging the audience to do the same. #MeghanMarkle #RoyalCoupleA giggle fit in church | 0:18The award mixup | 0:54An overly-affectionate back rub? | 1:39A snub of royal proportions | 2:34Being dubbed \"a fat lady\" | 3:24",

Vulnerable narcissism is characterized by shame, anger, aggression, hypersensitivity, a tendency to be introverted, defensive, avoidant, anxious, depressed, socially awkward, and shy.Narcissistic personality disorder is a Cluster B personality disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. It has nine symptom criteria, five of which are required for a diagnosis.1: Grandiose sense of self-importance 2: Fantasies 3: Special or unique4: Requires excessive admiration 5: Sense of entitlement 6: Manipulative 7: Lacks empathy for others 8: Often envious 9: Arrogant attitudes or behaviorsCosta, P.

The coronavirus pandemic continues to claim lives around the world. As countries grapple with how best to tackle the virus, and the reverberations the pandemic is sending through their societies and economies, scientific understanding of how the COVID-19 virus is behaving and what measures might best combat it continues to advance. What strategy has Sweden embraced and why? Can a herd immunity strategy work in the fight against COVID-19? How insightful is it to compare different nations\u2019 approaches and what does the degree of variation reveal?Professor Heymann is a world-leading authority on infectious disease outbreaks. He led the World Health Organization\u2019s response to SARS and has been advising the organization on its response to the coronavirus. Professor Giesecke is professor emeritus of Infectious Disease Epidemiology at the Karolinska Institute Medical University in Stockholm. He was state epidemiologist for Sweden from 1995 to 2005 and the first chief scientist of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) from 2005 to 2014.https://www.chathamhouse.org/research...",

I don't know how people fall for what to me immediately comes out as an obvious attempt at a viral video spread to sell a book. I hope some of you find this entertaining.A book which if truly was so important would be shared for free. The more I research Judy Mikovits the less I can trust her. At the end of the day though this video is entertainment and should be taken as such.I first found this under \" Dr Anthony Fauci's ex employee, was jailed, finally tells all \" and have seen it trending on twitter under \" plandemic \".For the arrest record I would like to mentioned that when I researched while charges were dropped she did return stolen notes. So while not found guilty she did in fact have stolen material to turn over. Saying there was no reason for the arrest is wrong.#PLANDEMIC #FAUCI #vaccine",

Stick to the recipe rigidly, the quantities are very important for successful results2.  Use scales for the measurements including the water, don't convert to cups or measuring jugs, they are too inaccurate 3.  Use proper white bread flour with at least 12% protein, check the ingredients list on the side of the flour bag, protein may show in grams per serving but just work it out, it needs to be 12g of protein per 100g of flour, plain or all purpose flour is not strong enough for making bread. 4.  Check your yeast is working you can do a yeast test as shown in my sandwich bread video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpSb... Any problems or inquiries I'm always here to help. And please let me know how you get on with the recipe.

            "description": "Poor posture can result in neck pain, shoulder knots/tension, and headache pain. As a physical therapist these are common complaints I treat in my clinic - oftentimes these issues correlate directly with a person's posture. Today I'm sharing 5 of my favorite exercises you can do at home to help correct these postural issues.Here's an Amazon link to my favorite foam roller: https://amzn.to/2PTB2SDDAILY STRENGTH TRAINING ROUTINE AT HOME: https://youtu.be/xb0vui7Ny8A6-MINUTE POSTURE CORRECTION WITH A FOAM ROLLER: https://youtu.be/8otTdS5DhE4HOW TO ELIMINATE MUSCLE KNOTS IN YOUR NECK, SHOULDERS, AND BACK: https://youtu.be/9PC9Mn0VO00BEST EXERCISES FOR UPPER BACK PAINhttps://youtu.be/cGjZ_XAvaXISETUP YOUR DESK TO IMPROVE YOUR POSTURE AND ELIMINATE NECK/SHOULDER PAIN:https://youtu.be/x12GnuV9QgwAs a physical therapist, I treat many posture related problems.The thing is \u2013 people don\u2019t come in to my clinic complaining of \u201cbad posture\u201c. People come into my clinic complaining of the symptoms that are typically associated with bad posture. Neck pain, knots in your upper shoulders, headache pain, etc. are typically related to poor posture.These are the complaints for which people typically seek Physical Therapy help; little do these patients know how many of them wouldn\u2019t be in any pain if they just spent some time addressing their posture!Today on Tone and Tighten I wanted to discuss these postural issues \u2013 specifically what is poor posture, why you developed it, and some simple exercises you can do to correct this problem.What is it?Poor posture is typically characterized by what we refer to as a \u201cforward head and rounded shoulders\u201c posture. When you stand up straight and tall, if I were to look at your profile from the side your ear should be directly located over the tip of your shoulder. Your sternum/chest should be pointed up with your shoulder blades sent back. This is what \u201cgood\u201c posture looks like.In this position, gravity holds your head squarely on top your neck with very minimal muscle activation required. This results in minimal tension, decreased muscle knots, and decreased muscle activation.Now let\u2019s take a look at the implications of bad posture\u2026Again, bad posture is typically characterized by a \u201cforward head and rounded shoulders\u201c. Forward head refers to the position of your head relative to your shoulders. It simply means that if I were to look at your standing posture from the profile view your ear would be out in front of the tip of your shoulder.This typically causes a \u201crounding\u201c forward of the shoulder blades and an increased visible \u201chump\u201c in the upper back.In this position, your head is not in an ideal anatomical location. Gravity would cause it to flop forward if not for some muscle activation to hold it up. So to prevent your head from flopping forward you must activate the muscles in your neck and upper shoulders.15\u201330 minutes at a time this might be OK, but when you spend 8 \u2013 12 \u2013 16 hours in this position, those muscles can get extremely fatigued.The result is increased tension in your neck, pain with movement, stiffness, knots in your upper shoulders, and even headaches.So what do we do about it?The muscles in your body are highly adaptable to stresses placed on them or removed from them.Our forward head and rounded shoulders posture typically results in what we refer to as an \u201cupper cross syndrome\u201c. The muscles through the front of your chest and back of your neck get tight while the muscles through your upper back and front of your neck get stretched out and week.The treatment for this poor posture issue is to basically reverse our \u201cupper cross syndrome\u201c. We need to stretch where it\u2019s tight (upper chest, front of the shoulders, and neck) and strengthen where it\u2019s weak (rhomboids and middle traps \u2013 between your shoulder blades).Here are 5 of my favorite exercises to help you overcome these problems. Push \u201cPlay\u201d on the video above for a detailed description of the principles discussed in this post including an explanation of the following exercises.Remember \u2013 oftentimes you don\u2019t feel \u201cpoor posture\u201d\u2026 but you certainly feel the effects from it. If you carry a large amount of tension in your neck and shoulders, get neck pain regularly, or experience tension headaches \u2013 your posture certainly could be playing a role in that.Performing these exercises regularly will help to improve your posture. In fact many of my patients notice a significant improvement in about a month; it might be up to 3 months to see a remarkable improvement (it took your body a long time to develop poor posture; it\u2019s going to take some time and effort to reverse this problem). You have to be diligent and consistent, but I know these can help you out!",

Usually these questions come from patients who are dealing with pain either in their necks or lower backs.These conditions can be limiting and debilitating on so many levels; one thing that is often affected his sleep.Today I wanted to share with you five tips to ensure you are getting your best sleep possible even despite1. The best sleeping position for you is one that is comfortable and holds your spine in the correct posture: The bottom line is the best sleeping position for you is which ever position you find to be the most comfortable while keeping your spine in as neutral a position as possible. Make sure you are aware of your spine alignment front to back, side to side, as well as if you are rotating or not.2. To get the right posture you need the right support: In order to achieve a correct, neutral spine posture, you need to have the right support from your mattress and from your pillow.Mattress: It is recommended that you replace your mattress every 8-10 years. If patients come to me who wake up with pain/stiffness in their spine often they\u2019re sleeping on an older mattress. If it\u2019s been a decade since you got a new mattress it might be time.Pillow: I make pillow recommendations based solely on two things - body type and sleeping posture. I would recommend a different pillow for someone with a petite frame versus a larger frame. Similarly, it you slept primarily on your back my recommendation would be different than if you slept primarily on your side.3. Stomach Sleep: DON\u2019T DO IT! This is the worst of all the postures you can sleep in through the night. It maximally rotates your neck all night, it puts your lower back in an extended position, and it puts pressure on your internal organs. Stop sleeping on your stomach.4. Side Sleepers: Again the goal is to achieve as close to neutral spine as possible. This is achieved with proper support for your head/neck, torso, and hips/legs.Head and neck: you want a pillow that supports your neck in a neutral position. If your pillow is too full your neck will be bent too much up towards the ceiling. If your pillow is too flat your head will be bent too much down towards your bed. Try to find the right pillow to achieve a neutral spine position.Torso: Again, this is where the right mattress comes into play. It needs to be firm enough to support the side of your trunk but soft enough to unload your shoulders and hips (areas of higher pressure). You can also get small pillows designed specifically to achieve this goal. Click here to see these pillows:Hips: Oftentimes when we sleep on our sides our top leg rests on top of our bottom leg putting pressure on your knees, pulling on your hips, and pulling your spine out of alignment. My solution here is to sleep with a pillow between your knees to unload stress at all three of these areas. You can even get pillows that specifically go between your legs that are intended for side sleepers; check out this link to get yours:5. Back sleepers: Back sleepers are typically a little more prone to snoring, but if you can handle that it\u2019s a really good position for your back! Again, the whole goal here will be getting your spine into a correct position and supporting it there.Head and neck: Again - you want just the right amount of support to maintain your head/neck at the correct angle. If your pillow is too full, you\u2019ll spend all night with your neck flexed up. If your pillow is too flat, you\u2019ll spend all night with your head extended and your neck unsupported. Typically your pillow should be smaller if you sleep on your back than it would be if you preferred to sleep on your side.Hips: Oftentimes laying out flat on our backs puts a lot of stress on our lower back due to hip flexors pulling on our spine. I always recommend that if you sleep on your back you do so with 1-2 pillows under your knees to unload some pressure in your spine. You can also buy different wedge-shaped pillows designed specifically for this purpose. You can check out this link to see my personal favorite:",

But over time, she began to see the dark side of her community, and ultimately realised that she had to get out. In this raw and emotional talk, Lilia shares the reality of life in a cult, and her heart-wrenching journey to break free. Lilia Tarawa is a New Zealand writer, speaker, holistic health consultant and business coach. She is a member of the M\u0101ori Ng\u0101i Tahu tribe. Lilia was born into New Zealand's infamous religious cult, Gloriavale, and fled with her eleven family members at eighteen years of age. Her extraordinary life experience compelled her to pursue a career promoting human rights, welfare and empowerment.https://www.liliatarawa.com/ https://www.youtube.com/liliatarawahttps://nz.linkedin.com/in/liliatarawahttps://www.facebook.com/liliatarawa https://www.instagram.com/liliatarawa This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

But this multi-billion dollar industry is under threat. A fungus called Panama Disease is rapidly infecting the world's Cavendish crops and could spell disaster for the monoculture-dependent worldwide banana trade. VICE correspondent Isobel Yeung heads to the heart of banana country in Latin American and the Philippines to see the devastating effects of the disease and to investigate what the loss of the banana would really mean besides a less colorful lunchbox.

He has become a hero to hundreds of public and private sector organizations for his indispensable counsel and strategic insight on safeguarding information systems and combating cyber-fraud.With an eye on the latest techniques developed by high-tech criminals to deceive and defraud, Frank leaves audiences with a deep understanding of today\u2019s evolving security landscape, and more importantly, a vision of how to make the world a safer place.",

We have some fun things planned for our family and summer is quickly approaching so we decided to stock up on some of our favorites and pick up a few special items to get us outdoors and having fun. This haul consists of grocery and non grocery items so the total does not reflect just what we spent on food for our family of 7. This is also not our typical one month stock up haul either. We will only need to buy fresh items and anything that is needed for a specific recipe for May & June!Trader Joe's Total $155.48 (all grocery)Dollar Tree Total $34 (all grocery)Sam's Club Total $366.69 ($170.70 on groceries)Costco Total $540.59 ($376.47 on groceries)Target Total $516.98 ($422.96 on groceries)HEB Total $151.94 ($100.45 on groceries)Walmart Total $318.20 ($82.81 on groceries)Grand Total $2,083.88 ( $1,342.87 on groceries)Check out my good friend, Kiera's channel!https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCK3u...**THANKS FOR WATCHING**Like my meal planner?
