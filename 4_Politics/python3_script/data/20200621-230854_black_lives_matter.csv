Better brain health | DW Documentary,Education,2934993,"29,988",856,"Chocolate reduces stress. Fish stimulates the brain. Is there any truth to such popular beliefs? The findings of researchers around the world say yes: It appears we really are what we eat.A study in a British prison found that inmates who took vitamin supplements were less prone to violent behavior. And in Germany, a psychologist at the University of Lübeck has shown that social behavior is influenced by the ingredients consumed at breakfast. But what really happens in the brain when we opt for honey instead of jam, and fish rather than sausage? Scientists around the world are trying to find out. Neuro-nutrition is the name of an interdisciplinary research field that investigates the impact of nutrition on brain health. Experiments on rats and flies offer new insight into the effects of our eating habits. When laboratory rats are fed a diet of junk food, the result is not just obesity. The menu also has a direct influence on their memory performance. The role of the intestinal flora has been known for some time, but scientists are currently discovering other relationships. So-called ""brain food"" for example: The Mediterranean diet that’s based on vegetables and fish is said to provide the best nutrition for small grey cells. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, for example, protect the nerve cells and are indispensable for the development of the brain - because the brain is also what it eats!--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

""I thought, 'Where am I? Why am I here?' I was so scared.""Almost 160,000 people like Busano have been arrested in the Philippines since President Rodrigo Duterte unleashed the 'war on drugs' in 2016. Jails across the country are in crisis. Some are 600 per cent over capacity, with the vast majority of prisoners incarcerated for years without conviction as over-burdened courts struggle to process their cases on time. More than 70 per cent of all inmates in Metro Manila jails are charged with drug offences. But many, including Busano, allege that police fabricated the evidence against them.""On the table there was already the evidence,"" he said from his prison dorm. ""They told me to point at it so they can take a photo. But I refused. I said, 'That's not mine. Why do I have to point at that?' They told me, 'Do you want us to kill you?'"" After more than two years in jail waiting for a verdict, Busano, like most drug suspects, has pled guilty to the charges in exchange for an early release. But despite already completing his sentence, he remains in jail.101 East investigates the shocking conditions inside the most congested prisons in the world, and the inmates trying to survive them- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/#AlJazeeraEnglish #101East #PhilippinesJail",PT26M1S,2018-12-13,2018-12-13,141773,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,GK8bMHuVeuc

An Economic Hit Man Confesses and Calls to Action | John Perkins | TEDxTraverseCity,Nonprofits & Activism,525108,"12,132",470,"John Perkins describes the methods he used to bribe and threaten the heads of state of countries on four continents in order to create a global empire and he reveals how the leaders who did not “play the game"" were assassinated or overthrown. He brings us up to date about the way the economic hit man system has spread from developing countries to the US, Europe, and the rest of the world and offers a strategy for turning this around. “Each of us,"" he says, “can participate in this exciting revolution. We can transform a system that is consuming itself into extinction into one that is sustainable and regenerative."" John's books, including The New Confessions of an Economic Hit Man, have sold over a million copies, spent more than 70 weeks on the New York Times bestseller lists, and are published in more than 30 languages. As Chief Economist at a major consulting firm, his experiences advising the World Bank, UN, IMF, U.S. government, Fortune 500 corporations, and heads of state convinced him to devote his life to facilitating changes in social, political, and economic systems, as well as in general consciousness. He was founder and CEO of a highly successful alternative energy company and is a founder and board member of Dream Change and The Pachamama Alliance, nonprofits dedicated to creating a sustainable, just, peaceful, and thriving world. John's courage in writing his books and speaking out against his former bosses exemplifies the courage shown by our Founding Fathers and Mothers when they stood up to the British Empire. Like them, John defied threats and bribes and took action.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Eventually, when Shayla was able to reach her older sister Seleena, she was also able to reach her oldest sister, Samantha. And with these connections, finally Shayla found her father, a former Vietnamese boat refugee who immigrated to Canada by himself.SUBSCRIBE now for MORE Videos: https://goo.gl/tMnTmXJOIN to support the channel & for exclusives: http://goo.gl/oUGRBvLike: Facebook: http://www.fb.com/KyleLe.netFollow: Instagram and Snapchat @KyleLeDotNet--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------About Me: I'm Kyle Le and these are the places I've been, the people I've met, the foods I've eaten, and the many things that I've seen...Originally from Southern California, I moved to Saigon, Vietnam after university and lived there for many years.

"They were best friends, then pen pals — until one day, the letters stopped coming | Finding Fukue",Education,6751854,"237,346","2,667","Almost 30 years after receiving the last letter from her pen-pal, Jessica Stuart returns to Japan to try and solve the mystery of her long-lost friend, Fukue. #CBCShortDocs Produced in Association with Real Stories. • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • It’s a mystery that spans decades, continents and cultures, and bridges one Toronto woman’s life with her childhood in Japan: what happened to Fukue?In 1988, Jessica Stuart was nine years old. Her family embarked on a cultural odyssey that would greatly influence her life: the Stuarts dug up their middle-class roots in Vancouver’s Jewish community and replanted them in a rural Japanese town called Saku for a year.It was during this absorbing year that Jessica met Fukue, a bright and bubbly girl with rosy red cheeks and an endless smile. Fukue and Jessica became like sisters, spending their days frolicking in the autumn leaves, dancing under snow-blanketed trees, watching hot air balloons illuminate the skyline in spring and sneaking through rice paddies in early summer.Strangely, Fukue never invited Jessica to visit her family home. One day after school, Jessica insisted. Fukue reluctantly brought Jessica to her house; it was a derelict shack on the outskirts of town. Shocked and disturbed, Jessica started to make sense of the name-calling and bullying that Fukue suffered at school.As the Stuarts’ year in Japan came to an end, Jessica and Fukue assured one another they would keep in touch. They became pen pals, writing letters back and forth for two years, until the letters from Fukue stopped — with no explanation.Now a musician in her 30s, Jessica has never forgotten Fukue. Her memories of their time together are beautiful, but haunting. And so her thoughts turn to the unknown. Where is Fukue now? Does she remember Jessica? Why did her letters stop all those years ago?Now, nearly 30 years after she left Japan, Jessica is going back to find the answers to these questions. She’s going to find Fukue.***A special thanks to The Stuart Family, Norie-Ichikawa Doyle and Saku City Junior High School.More Shows:http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-WatchMoreStay Connected:Twitter: http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-TwitterFacebook: http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-FacebookInstagram: http://bit.ly/CBCDocs-Instagram",PT20M39S,2018-11-14,2018-11-14,122643,CBC Docs,/channel/UCsEbwT3FHpAey6prlu7tNhw,UCsEbwT3FHpAey6prlu7tNhw,20,ZVlZMOB-Sq0
Underwater Aircraft Carriers: Imperial Japan’s Secret Weapon,Education,1773537,"51,855","1,089","Sign up for an annual CuriosityStream subscription and you’ll also get a free Nebula subscription (the new streaming platform built by creators) here: http://CuriosityStream.com/mustardIn August of 1945, as the world celebrates Imperial Japan’s surrender and the effective end of the second world war, the American’s make a puzzling discovery out in the Pacific. The US Navy has intercepted a Japanese submarine that’s unlike anything they’ve seen before. It’s by far the largest submarine ever constructed, at nearly twice the length of a typical German U-boat. But it’s what the submarine carries that truly baffles the Americans.The Japanese I-400-Class submarine’s most unusual feature was that it carried three torpedo/dive bombers inside an internal hanger. In order to fit, these full size attack float planes had wings and tailplanes that could be folded. The submarines also featured a catapult launch system and a crane mechanism to recover the aircraft. The I-400 submarine was effectively the world’s first underwater aircraft carrier. It was also a formidable submarine in the conventional sense, heavily armed with torpedo tubes, an enormous deck gun and anti-aircraft cannons.Conceived as a secret Japanese weapon at the start of the Pacific war, a fleet of I-400 submarines would be tasked with launching surprise attacks on New York, Washington, San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles. The attacks were intended to shake the will of the American people to keep fighting in the war. But as the war turned against Imperial Japan, shortages in war materials and shifting military priorities resulted in only 3 I-400 completing construction before Japan’s surrender. Fortunately, the I-400 was never allowed to demonstrate it’s true capacity.Select footage courtesy the AP Archive:AP Archive website: http://www.aparchive.com YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/aparchive and https://www.youtube.com/c/britishmovi...Special thanks to Nick Arehart for helping clean up our audio:https://twitter.com/airhrt_Link to the Mustard Store:https://teespring.com/stores/mustard-...Music (reproduced under license):Intro Song:  “Tyberius” - https://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-mu...Song 2:    “Warrior Epic Cinematic Adventure” - https://audiojungle.net/item/warrior-...Song 3:    “Red Sunrise” - hhttps://www.pond5.com/royalty-free-mu...Song 4:  “Norway Lights” - https://audiojungle.net/item/norway-l...

Jason Riley On “False Black Power?”,News & Politics,270331,"6,726",198,"Recorded on February 21, 2019. What is “false black power?” According to Jason Riley, author of False Black Power?, it is political clout, whereas true black power is human capital and culture. Riley and Peter Robinson dive into the arguments in Riley’s new book, the history of African Americans in the United States, and welfare inequality in black communities.  Riley discusses the Moynihan report of 1965, which documented the rise of black families headed by single women in inner cities and how this report was something black sociologists had already been writing about for several years. He argues that there was clearly a breakdown of the nuclear family and that this is a result of the “Great Society” welfare programs of the 1960s rather than the legacy of slavery or Jim Crow laws. In the 1960s, Riley posits that the black activist community’s shift towards political engagement was misguided. He argues that the idea of black political clout leading to black economic advancement was misplaced. Other impoverished communities (i.e. Irish, Jewish, and Italian immigrant communities) at various times in American history focused on economic advancement first before trying to achieve political clout, and they were successful. Instead, the black community focused first on electing black politicians, which ended up doing very little for the economic advancement of the community as politicians typically put their own interests first, above their communities’. Riley points out that the economic data shows that black communities became more impoverished under black leadership. Riley proposes a solution of advocating for more school-choice vouchers, which allow black parents to take better control of their children’s futures and place them in the best schools for them. He also argues for reducing social safety nets, making them a more temporary form of welfare rather than the multigenerational welfare system currently in place.

"Hong Kong’s huge protests, explained",News & Politics,8036731,"185,389","17,619","The people of Hong Kong are protesting in record-breaking numbers. Become a Video Lab member! http://bit.ly/video-labCorrection at 7:48: The protester says “They are not doing this for themselves, but for the future of Hong Kong.”Hundreds of thousands of Hongkongers have taken to the streets to protest a controversial extradition bill that could send Hong Kong residents to mainland China to be tried in court. Hong Kong’s Chief Executive, Carrie Lam, says the bill is meant to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a safe haven for fugitives. But its opponents fear that Hong Kong would be exposed to China’s flawed judicial system, which would lead to further erasure of the city’s judicial independence.At first Lam was determined to move forward with the bill.

"People, trading and markets in Ghana | DW Documentary",Education,1823835,"7,607",564,"Ghana is the second largest cocoa producer in the world. Still, many Ghanaians have yet to taste chocolate: The precious commodity is largely for export. The cocoa farmers in this resource-rich country also usually see little of the profit.Crossing the Lake Volta in central with ferries and water taxis can be a dangerous business. Many farmers from remote villages cross the world's largest artificial lake several times a week to sell their produce at local markets. The journey can be tricky, especially during storms or if they are transporting livestock. The belief that death is the gateway to eternal life is deeply rooted in the West African country, and funerals are an important social event there. Coffins symbolize the deceased’s profession - for example, shaped like fish, sewing machines, bibles, bush taxis or cocoa beans - and funerals are rarely a gloomy affair and often more like a carnival. The splendor of the funeral and the number of mourners attending reflect the standing of the deceased’s family in the community. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Conjoined Twins Abby and Erin Delaney: A Year in the Life,Science & Technology,16794876,,,"On June 6, 2017, surgeons at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia successfully separated 10-month-old conjoined twins Erin and Abby. http://www.chop.edu/delaney-twinsParents Heather and Riley Delaney, from North Carolina, first learned that Heather was carrying conjoined twins about 11 weeks into her pregnancy. Abby and Erin Delaney were born in CHOP’s Garbose Family Special Delivery Unit on July 24, 2016, after being closely monitored by the Hospital’s Center for Fetal Diagnosis & Treatment.The Delaney twins were connected at the top of their heads, a condition called craniopagus, the least common type of conjoined twins. The girls were the 23rd pair of conjoined twins separated at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), the first craniopagus pair.Surgery to separate conjoined twins involves many steps. Over their first 10 months, the girls underwent a series of surgeries, including the placement of expanders to stretch their skin.The separation of conjoined twins is a very complex surgery followed by a long and complicated recovery. Co-led by neurosurgeon Gregory Heuer, MD, PhD, and plastic surgeon Jesse Taylor, MD, a multidisciplinary team of approximately 30 members, including physicians, nurses and other medical staff from neurosurgery, plastic and reconstructive surgery, and anesthesiology, participated in the separation surgery, which lasted about 11 hours.After separation, formerly conjoined twins require intensive, expert care. As the separated infants recovered from their surgery, they were closely followed by their surgeons, nutritionists, developmental pediatricians, and other specialists to ensure that they receive the best clinical care to enable them to thrive and grow. They also received intensive therapy from a team of speech, occupational and physical therapists. Over the next few years, the girls will require additional surgeries to replace missing bone in their skulls and to minimize scarring.",PT11M38S,2017-10-21,2017-10-21,145215,The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,/channel/UCCdnN4v9Fia0pjUzYlUBsGg,UCCdnN4v9Fia0pjUzYlUBsGg,20,WZ0Lq6WIaok

Former neo-Nazi removes swastika tattoos after unlikely friendship,News & Politics,11553917,"225,271","6,710","Colorado resident Michael Kent recently sat down at a tattoo parlor in Colorado Springs to have his swastikas covered up. Follow reporter Michael Koenigs @MikeOnABikeABC for more profile pieces.  Kent, a former neo-Nazi, credits an African-American parole officer named Tiffany Whittier with helping him to see beyond skin color and changing his views about white supremacy.“If it wasn’t for her I would have seeped back into it,” said Kent. “I look at her as family.”Whittier, 45, even inspired Kent, 38, to take down the Nazi flags he had hanging in his living room and replace them with smiley faces.“I’m not here to judge him. That’s not my job to judge. My job is to be that positive person in someone’s life,” Whittier said.Added Kent, “When you wake up and see a smiley face, you’re going to go to work and you’re going to smile.”PHOTO: Former skinhead Michael Kent gives his former parole officer Tiffany Whittier a hug after she surprises him at his home.ABC NewsFormer skinhead Michael Kent gives his former parole officer Tiffany Whittier a hug after she surprises him at his home.more +Kent now works full-time on a chicken farm in Colorado, where all his co-workers are Hispanic.“Before all this, I wouldn’t work for anybody or with anybody that wasn’t white,” said Kent. “[Now] we have company parties, or they have quinceañeras, I’m the only white guy there!”Redemption Ink, a national non-profit that offers free removals of hate-related tattoos, helped connect Kent with Fallen Heroes Tattoo in Colorado to begin the 15-hour process of covering his swastikas. The sterile environment is new to Kent who had his previous ink work done in prison.“I’ve never, never, never been inside of a tattoo shop getting a professional tattoo,” he said.Kent believes the painful process will help him move forward after spending years as a member of a violent skinhead group based in Arizona. As a father of two young children, Kent also hopes his children will see the world differently.“I don’t want my kids to live the life I lived and live with hate,” said Kent. “I want my kids to know me for who I am now—a good father, a hard worker, and a good provider.”SUBSCRIBE to ABC NEWS: https://www.youtube.com/ABCNews/Watch More on http://abcnews.go.com/LIKE ABC News on FACEBOOKhttps://www.facebook.com/abcnewsFOLLOW ABC News on TWITTER:https://twitter.com/abcGOOD MORNING AMERICA'S HOMEPAGE:https://gma.yahoo.com/",PT3M5S,2017-09-26,2017-09-26,171632,ABC News,/channel/UCBi2mrWuNuyYy4gbM6fU18Q,UCBi2mrWuNuyYy4gbM6fU18Q,20,njXZUH5hv0w

Jaye is known for tackling complex and often controversial subject matters. Her latest film is  The Red Pill. Prior to  “The Red Pill”, Jaye’s most notable films were  the award winning feature documentaries “Daddy I Do” (which examined the Abstinence-Only Movement versus Comprehensive Sex Education) and “The Right to Love: An American Family” (which followed one family’s activism fighting for same-sex marriage rights in California). Both films showed that Jaye’s interview style is to allow people to share their views honestly, openly and candidly while allowing audiences to come to  their own conclusions.http://theredpillmovie.com/about-the-...~~This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Life in the universe | The Economist,News & Politics,1151244,"2,975",201,"Does life exist anywhere else in the universe? And how did it get started? Scientists are seeking the answers in the cosmos, our solar system and right here on planet Earth. Subscribe NOW to The Economist: http://econ.st/1Fsu2VjIs there life elsewhere in the universe? Anyone who has pondered the immensity of the cosmos has probably wondered at some time or another whether life exists beyond our planet? The search for life beyond Earth has been buoyed by recent discoveries made by NASA's Kepler telescope - it's looking for planets outside our solar system known as exoplanets. Kepler measures the brightness of distant stars and tracks a stars dimming when a planet passes in front. Up until 1995, exoplanets were purely theoretical - but scientists have since identified thousands of them.in July, NASA scientists announced the discovery of one of their most exciting exoplanets yet - Kepler-452B. Located some fourteen thousand light-years away the planet is in the habitable zone which means it's the right distance from its own Sun and also the right size to potentially be earth-like. There is a limit to how much we can learn about Kepler-452B because of its distance. NASA is launching the James Webb telescope in 2018 to find earth-like planets closer to home so they can study their atmospheres for bio signatures that would indicate the presence of life. But there's another way to learn more about distant planets beyond what the Kepler telescope can tell us, and that is to look for signs of intelligent life. Frank Drake has been listening out for signals of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe for over 50 years. Mr Drake came up with something called the Drake Equation which is a mathematical formula that estimates how many advanced civilizations capable of transmitting signals might exist in the universe. He co-founded the SETI Institute, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Scientists at the SETI Institute have been searching for intelligent life for the past few decades.SETI researchers have not come across any signals yet but they say this is to be expected. SETI's efforts recently got a huge boost with a launch of breakthrough Listen, overseen by Martin Rees, Stephen Hawking, and Frank Drake and funded by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Yuri Milner. The project will greatly expand the organization's capacity to search and sift through data. But scientists aren't only interested in discovering life forms light-years away. At first glance our solar system seems like a rather unlikely place to find life beyond Earth but the reason scientists think it is plausible is because of the discovery of a group of organisms called extremophiles that live on earth.Scientists are looking at the moons of Jupiter and Saturn as well as our nearest neighbor Mars. The hope is that if we find further life in our solar system on places like Mars, we will improve our understanding of how easily it might have started elsewhere. But there is another way to answer this question - determining how it started on earth. One man who is trying to come up with an answer to this question is Jack Szostak. In his lab at Harvard University he's trying to determine how easy it is to create life by making it himself.   Modern cells are intricate nano scale factories stuffed with thousands of different chemicals each taking part in a complicated and messy web of reactions. Long strands of DNA and codicils genetic information. Shorter strands of RNA carry that information around the cell telling it how to manufacture the proteins that run the chemical reactions it requires to live. It seems unlikely that these systems all evolved at the same time. At the Szostak lab they're focused on two experiments. One to work out how primitive cell membranes could grow and divide into daughter cells, and the other on RNA replication. Dr Szostak and his team have already created a protocell from a blob of lipids which contains RNA. The sticking point at the moment is working out how to make RNA that can copy itself without relying on a helping hand from RNA enzymes. If it is a difficult process reliant upon various bits of luck or circumstance then it is possible that we are a cosmic fluke - one that isn't going to be repeated elsewhere. But if experiments like Dr Szostak show that life emerges easily, then the odds of life appearing elsewhere in the universe look more likely. Perhaps one day when we're looking into the night sky we'll finally know the answer to the question are we alone?Read the accompanying article: http://www.economist.com/news/science...Get more The EconomistFollow us:  https://twitter.com/TheEconomistLike us: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomistView photos:  https://instagram.com/theeconomist/",PT10M48S,2015-08-08,2015-08-08,132326,The Economist,/channel/UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,20,bo4mEtc434w

Sikkim and Bhutan (Asia) Vacation Travel Video Guide,Travel & Events,299212,"1,053",88,"Travel video about destination Sikkim and Bhutan.Surrounded by the world’s highest mountains is a fascinating world whose exotic charm enchants all who experience it, from the plains of West Bengal up into the Himalayas. Siliguri is a vibrant city located within India’s Terai Plain, a peaceful provincial town with calm streets and shops that once supplied the region’s tea pickers with their daily needs, has been transformed into an important crossroads for travellers to the Himalayas. Siliguri Train Station is the starting point of one of the most famous train journeys in the world, the Darjeeling Himalaya Toy Train which climbs to an altitude of more than two thousand metres, negotiates eight hundred and seventy three bends and crosses more than five hundred bridges. Sikkim is strongly associated with Tibet and possesses more than two hundred monasteries.  The most holy monastery of the Nyingmapa Schools is in Tashiding and is located on a mountain in the east of the country along the route from Darjeeling. The independent kingdom of Bhutan is located in Southeast Asia, most of it being two thousand metres above sea level and is situated between India in the south and Tibet in the north.  Thimphu is the capital of Bhutan.  An array of prayer flags adorn a bridge in the centre of the city and close by is the large Tshonhkhang Marketplace, a colourful meeting place for both farmers and traders. For more than a thousand years Bhutan has survived in self-imposed isolation, cut off from the outside world by its own deliberate policy. Sikkim and Bhutan:  two gems of history, monastic culture and religious life.--------------Watch more travel videos ► https://goo.gl/MXPgSsJoin us.

We Are Watching Woke Politics Destroy Our Institutions | Michael Knowles | POLITICS | Rubin Report,News & Politics,28420,"2,786",57,"Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report talks to Michael Knowles (The Daily Wire, Podcast Show Host, Author) about progressive politics, woke college campuses, and the collapse of our liberal institutions. Michael discusses the true danger of progressive politics, it’s reliance on experts. Michael uses the example of the WHO (The World Health Organization) telling us multiple conflicting messages about Coronavirus. Michael also discusses the benefits of not being raised in an echo chamber or in a political monoculture and how it refined his conservative viewpoints. Michael discusses how the crazy SJW woke mobs from college campuses did not in fact change once they entered the real world. Instead they have moved on to destroying our cities and institutions. He points out the flaws in the systemic racism arguments made by liberals, since most powerful institutions (higher education, public school, media, and big tech) are dominated by woke liberal politics. Michael discusses the emergence of actual racism being practiced by companies like Uber Eats that are waving fees for black owned businesses. Michael shares his thoughts on the conflicting interests of intersectional politics with the Black Lives Matter and the LGBTQ communities. Michael discusses how even liberals seemed to be worried about the turn that woke politics are taking. Michael gives his thoughts on how to best address the amount of power that Big Tech companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Google have and the different strategies that could be used to loosen their dominance in the social media space. Michael discusses the importance of speaking up and standing up for what you believe and getting out of the political closet, and why you can’t wait for it to be the “right time”. Michael also discusses the importance of building new coalitions against the common enemy of far left woke politics similar to those that were made during the cold war.Is the state of US news driving you crazy?

#LicensePlateLinda: Colerain Township woman learns firsthand about social media shaming,News & Politics,684757,"7,869",425,"CINCINNATI (WKRC) - A local woman is the latest example of “social media shaming.”Domonique Duskin's Facebook post has received a lot of attention. She shared pictures, showing damage to the license plates and cars of family members who attended a party at her cousin's house in Colerain Township on Sunday night.Police charged Linda Shad with criminal damaging. She's a neighbor of Marvin Shelton, who hosted the party. Marvin says Shad complained about his guests blocking his driveway. Shelton says Shad called police, who told her it was Shelton's driveway.""When she wasn't happy with the outcome, I guess she decided to take matters into her own hands. I’m pretty sure she didn’t expect things to take off they that they did,"" said Shelton.Duskin's social media post about ""#LicensePlateLinda"" now has thousands of shares and comments.""I just wanted to put it out there so people can see that it is happening in your neighborhoods. It’s happening everywhere, so that was my whole meaning. I didn’t think it would take off as much as it did. but I’m glad that it did so it can expose people for who they are,"" said Duskin.A string of recent viral posts have shamed people for ""questionable"" behavior, like the woman dubbed ""Permit Patty"" who was a white woman who lost her job after calling police about a black 8-year-old girl selling water on the street or ""Barbecue Becky"", a white woman who called police on black people having a cookout.Julie Stockman is with the College of Informatics at Northern Kentucky University. She says ""social media shaming"" is happening more often in this highly politicized environment and what has been posted, sticks around for a while.""In court, it's public record, but people don't go out Googling public record to find things. Social media, everyone is on it. It’s ubiquitous and it’s out there for eternity. So, she’s not going to be able erase anything they are focusing on,"" said StockmanMeanwhile, Marvin Shelton is looking for a public apology and a little peace.""I'm hoping they learned a lesson and I’m hoping that we can... We don’t have to be friends. We don’t have to be buddies. We can just co-exist,"" he said.Marvin Shelton says the damage to his neighbor from social media posts will likely be worse than any punishment from the courts. It's important to say again she is only charged and not convicted.Local 12 and Larry Davis went to Linda Shad's home and rang her doorbell, but there was no answer. Larry Davis left his card asking for comments, but so far no call has been returned.",PT3M9S,2018-07-17,2018-07-17,171556,LOCAL 12,/channel/UC673WfesrYoCgG9VsekGlEQ,UC673WfesrYoCgG9VsekGlEQ,20,2hYICt9YEpI

The lost tribe of childless women | Jody Day | TEDxHull,Nonprofits & Activism,126227,"2,501",243,"1 in 5 women in the UK over 45 don’t have children – a much bigger number than most people realise. Misrepresented or ignored in the media, marketing and politics, the butt of social jokes such as ‘the crazy cat lady’, and denied the status of ‘real’ women because they aren’t mothers, this is the biggest diversity issue HR hasn’t heard of. Yet this lost tribe, hidden in plain sight, have a lot to teach us about how scared we are of what we don’t understand, and how, as a society, we are missing a huge trick by excluding them from the mainstream.Jody Day is a British author, trainee integrative psychotherapist and the founder of Gateway Women, the global friendship and support network for childless women which has a reach of two million women. She’s a founding and board member at AWOC.org (Ageing Without Children) and a former Fellow in Social Innovation at Cambridge Judge Business School. She is the author of 2016’s Living the Life Unexpected: 12 Weeks to Your Plan B for a Meaningful and Fulfilling Future Without Children (Bluebird/PanMac), which the British Medical Journal has recommended as “the book to recommend to… patients when they face coming to terms with unavoidable childlessness.” She lives in London with her cat, a stereotype that she warmly and humorously subverts.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

How To Be The Coolest Guy In The Room,Howto & Style,3723898,"91,445","1,765","Discover The 4 Necessary Emotions To A Killer First Impression: http://bit.ly/2EQiZXI6 Ways Iron Man is Cooler Than Captain AmericaThe rivalry between iron Man and Captain America has reached a fever pitch with Captain America: Civil War.  And in the movies (Winter Soldier, Avengers, etc.) and comics both are incredibly effective leaders.  What is undeniable though, is that people follow them for different reasons, because Iron Man is much cooler than Captain America.  In fact, Captain America can be kind of a dweebIn honor of Captain America: Civil War I wanted to look at the actors behind these 2 iconic characters.  Because whether Iron Man has bled into Robert Downey Junior or vice versa, the fact is that they have both mastered the art of witty banter and cool demeanor.  Chris Evans and Captain America, still make great leaders but in a very different way.  They're much more good-hearted and likable.  So let's take a look at how some tiny little habits make Robert Downey Junior and Tony Stark come across as cool while Chris Evans and Captain America come off as something else entirely.  We'll explore the different ways that they use sarcasm, joke, and pay attention to other people.  And in the end hopefully we can resolve this Civil War peacefully ;-) Subscribe to Charisma On Command: http://bit.ly/subscribeCOCConnect With Us.Website: http://www.charismaoncommand.comFacebook: http://facebook.com/charismaoncommandPeriscope: @CharismaonVideo Editor, Andre: http://www.goandre.comOr if you want to see my personal stuff (my regular life + me playing music):Instagram: @CharlieHoupertPeriscope: @CharlieHoupert",PT17M28S,2016-05-10,2016-05-10,163441,Charisma on Command,/channel/UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,20,QLnrx6mbcSo

Meanwhile,  two older sisters were adopted previously and still live in the Toronto area. Due to unfortunate circumstances, difficult situations, and past struggles with the law, Shayla’s birth parents lost custody shortly after they were born.

How was he radicalized, and how did he ultimately get out? In this courageous talk, Christian shares a surprising and counterintuitive solution to hate in all forms. After leaving the white-supremacist skinhead movement that he helped build in the 1980s and 90s, Christian Picciolini co-founded Life After Hate, a nonprofit dedicated to helping people disengage from violent extremism. His memoir, White American Youth: My Descent into America's Most Violent Hate Movement—and How I Got Out (Hachette), which details his involvement, and eventual disengagement, from the early American white nationalist movement, will be published on December 26, 2017. Christian lives in Chicago. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.

10 Walmart Foods You Should Absolutely NEVER BUY (Part 2),Entertainment,293169,"3,210",331,"Here's a list of the top 10 Walmart Foods You Should Absolutely Never Buy. Walmart has so many great foods at discounted prices, but these are the 10 foods you should never buy when shopping at Walmart!➡️ Subscribe to BabbleTop: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX--...A lot can be said about Walmart. It’s a huge chain. It has everything under one roof and prices are not that high compared to other stores. But a lot can be said against it as well. Rather than joining the chorus of voices exposing everything that’s wrong with Walmart, we’ll focus instead on food. Why food? Because unlike any other cheap or defective product you might buy there, food has the added disadvantage of causing possible health problems. So here are 10 foods you should never ever buy at Walmart.If you enjoyed this list of the 10 foods you should never buy at Walmart, then comment: #walmart #food #failsTIMESTAMPS:0:39 Coffee2:10 Baking Ingredients 3:22 Peanut Butter4:33 Broth5:57 Maple Syrup7:14 Great Value Pizzadilla8:43 Low-cost Pork10:04 Seafood11:11 Ground Beef12:00 VitaminsSUMMARIES:- What has this got to do with coffee, you ask? Well, coffee in Walmart is one of those consumer products that the retailer seems to treat as a luxury item.- Walmart, like many other stores, likes to sell various items under its own brand.- For the ones who find it delicious and can’t possibly think of their life without it, peanut butter is a staple of every pantry.-  Soup is another all-weather or all-season food. If it’s snowing outside, a hot bowl of broth will warm your core and get you all cozy.- Don't immediately jump in and say that maple syrup is inherently expensive and that you don’t care about the price.- But if pizza is unhealthy, wait till you hear about Walmart’s Great Value Pizzadilla.- Now here’s something that sells for less at Walmart than in other stores. We’re talking about low-cost pork. - Generally speaking, seafood is less healthy than it used to be. Blame it on ocean pollution and the dumping of industrial waste in the oceans.- We continue with the most obvious choice. Ground beef. Why ground beef? Well, because most people flock to the meat section at Walmart drawn by the cheap prices.- Vitamins are of dubious benefit. Ask any health expert and most would confirm this statement.📺 10 Walmart Foods You Should Absolutely Never Buy (Part 1) https://youtu.be/nqb0vSDBgDc➡️ SUBSCRIBE to BabbleTop! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX--...🥳 JOIN and become a BabbleTop member! https://www.youtube.com/babbletop/join👕 Check out our MERCH! https://teespring.com/stores/babbletop🔥 Our Most Popular VIDEOS! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOvb3...10 Secrets Walmart Doesn't Want You To Know https://youtu.be/r0fMy-SuKvk10 Secrets Walmart Doesn't Want You To Know (Part 2) https://youtu.be/WpHodA9wick10 Walmart Food Items Only Found In China https://youtu.be/n7CriD2tShAAll clips used for fair use commentary, criticism, and educational purposes.

Is SpaceX's Raptor engine the king of rocket engines?,Science & Technology,2742628,"80,557","1,665","00:00 - Intro02:55 - Basic physics of rocket engines 06:10 - Rocket engine cycles 20:30 - Rocket fuel comparison30:40 - Raptor vs other rocket engines44:05 - SummaryArticle version - https://everydayastronaut.com/?p=9823...SpaceX's new raptor engine is a methane fueled full flow staged combustion cycle engine and its so hard to develop, no engine like this has ever flown before! Now this topic can be really intimidating so in order to bring the Raptor engine into context, we’re going to do an overview of a few common types of rocket engine cycles then compare the Raptor to a few other common rocket engines, like SpaceX’s current work horse, the Merlin, The Space Shuttle’s RS-25, the RD-180, Blue Origin’s BE-4 and the F-1 engine.And if that’s not enough, not only is SpaceX using a crazy engine cycle, they’re also going to be using Liquid Methane as their fuel, again something that no orbital rocket has ever used! So we’ll also go over the unique characteristics of liquid methane as a rocket fuel and see if we can figure out why SpaceX went with Methane for the Raptor engine.We'll also break down and explain all the different engine cycle types so you know what the full flow staged combustion cycle is, how it works, and how it compares to the other cycles.So by the end of this video hopefully we’ll have the context to know why the raptor engine is special, how it compares to other rocket engines, why it’s using methane and hopefully find out if the Raptor engine will be the new king of rocket engines…-----------------------------------------------Rocket engine renders by  @MartianDays https://twitter.com/MartianDaysF-1 Turbopump photo provided by Mike Jetzer/heroicrelics.orgHUGE thanks to my Moon Walker Patreon supporters!

Around 1500 surrogacy centres give hope to desperate couples, helping lift surrogate mothers out of poverty; but at what cost?""We tried IVF for 4,5 years. I fell pregnant 4 times and lost all 4 babies"", says Kali Gerakas from Australia. She is now the proud mother of twins, Costa and Christina. Surrogacy has become a lucrative industry in many parts of India. Some believe the $7000 fee per birth, is a win-win situation, for both hopeful foreign parents, and Indian surrogate mothers. But with many surrogates coming from very poor backgrounds with little or no education, there are concerns that some are pressed into the industry by their husbands and families, as a quick way to make money. ""They have been brainwashed because they are so poor"", argues Kishwar Desai, author and surrogacy critic, ""people are forgetting that there are human beings and emotions involved"". In this highly unregulated industry, parents' dreams face exploitation by overcharging clinics. But as pioneering commercial surrogacy business person Dr Patel believes: ""if you feel that the childless should live a life of misery, or the poor are meant to remain poor, then you will consider this as something immoral, a baby making factory"".ABC Australia - Ref: 6087Journeyman Pictures is your independent source for the world's most powerful films, exploring the burning issues of today.

Can You Name a Country?,Comedy,6072934,"154,798","8,663","Senator Ted Cruz recently tweeted a segment that he likely did not realize was from our show. About two years ago, we went out on the street and asked people, if they could name a country on the map. Many of them could not. This had nothing to do with their political affiliation, but Ted Cruz posted it and wrote… “This is Bernie’s base - the same folks who tell pollsters that socialism is great because free stuff is cool & they have no idea how many countries have tried it and utterly failed. The antidote: facts, truth & substance.” Unfortunately, the guy talking about facts, truth and substance, made that all up. These were not Bernie supporters - we don’t know who they supported, we didn’t ask. Bernie wasn’t even running when we shot that. So, we decided to revisit this by asking people who do not support Bernie Sanders (in fact, quite the opposite) to name a country, and this is how that went.Trump Says Coronavirus is Very Much Under Control https://youtu.be/PbrX_uadZPASUBSCRIBE to get the latest #KIMMEL: http://bit.ly/JKLSubscribe Watch Mean Tweets: http://bit.ly/KimmelMT10 Connect with Jimmy Kimmel Live Online: Visit the Jimmy Kimmel Live WEBSITE: http://bit.ly/JKLWebsiteLike Jimmy Kimmel on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/KimmelFBLike Jimmy Kimmel Live on FACEBOOK: http://bit.ly/JKLFacebookFollow @JimmyKimmel on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/KimmelTWFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on TWITTER: http://bit.ly/JKLTwitterFollow Jimmy Kimmel Live on INSTAGRAM: http://bit.ly/JKLInstagram About Jimmy Kimmel Live: Jimmy Kimmel serves as host and executive producer of Emmy-winning ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" ABC's late-night talk show.""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" is well known for its huge viral video successes with 5.6 billion views on YouTube alone.Some of Kimmel's most popular comedy bits include - Mean Tweets, Lie Witness News, Jimmy's Twerk Fail Prank, Unnecessary Censorship, YouTube Challenge, The Baby Bachelor, Movie: The Movie, Handsome Men's Club, Jimmy Kimmel Lie Detective and music videos like ""I (Wanna) Channing All Over Your Tatum"" and a Blurred Lines parody with Robin Thicke, Pharrell, Jimmy and his security guard Guillermo.Now in its seventeenth season, Kimmel's guests have included: Johnny Depp, Meryl Streep, Tom Cruise, Halle Berry, Harrison Ford, Jennifer Aniston, Will Ferrell, Katy Perry, Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Channing Tatum, George Clooney, Larry David, Charlize Theron, Mark Wahlberg, Kobe Bryant, Steve Carell, Hugh Jackman, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Bridges, Jennifer Garner, Ryan Gosling, Bryan Cranston, Jamie Foxx, Amy Poehler, Ben Affleck, Robert Downey Jr., Jake Gyllenhaal, Oprah, and unfortunately Matt Damon.Can You Name a Country?https://youtu.be/umpalMtQE50",PT3M25S,2020-02-26,2020-02-26,115446,Jimmy Kimmel Live,/channel/UCa6vGFO9ty8v5KZJXQxdhaw,UCa6vGFO9ty8v5KZJXQxdhaw,19,umpalMtQE50

5 minutes of your time presents: Psalm 139,Education,83,5,0,"5 Minutes of Your Time Presents:Psalm 139 - A Psalm of David (New Living Translation)1 O Lord, you have examined my heart     and know everything about me.2 You know when I sit down or stand up.     You know my every thought when far away.3 You chart the path ahead of me.     and tell me when to stop and rest.     Every moment you know where I am.4 You know what I am going to say     even before I say it, Lord.5 You both precede and follow me.     You place your hand of blessing on my head.6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me,     too great for me to know!7 I can never escape from your Spirit!     I can never get away from your presence!8 If I go up to heaven, you are there;     if I go down to the place of the dead, you are there.9 If I ride the wings of the morning,     if I dwell by the farthest oceans,10 even there your hand will guide me,     and your strength will support me.11 I could ask the darkness to hide me     and the light around me to become night—12     but even in darkness I cannot hide from you.To you the night shines as bright as day.     Darkness and light are both alike to you.13 You made all the delicate, inner parts of my body     and knit me together in my mother’s womb.14 Thank you for making me so wonderfully complex!     Your workmanship is marvelous—how well I know it.15 You watched me as I was being formed in utter seclusion,     as I was woven together in the dark of the womb.16 You saw me before I was born.     Every day of my life was recorded in your book.Every moment was laid out     before a single day had passed.17 How precious are your thoughts about me, O God.     They are innumerable!18 I can’t even count them;     they outnumber the grains of sand!And when I wake up in the morning,     you are still with me!19 O God, if only you would destroy the wicked!     Get out of my life, you murderers!20 They blaspheme you;     your enemies take your name in vain.21 O Lord, shouldn’t I hate those who hate you?     Shouldn’t I despise those who resist you?22 Yes, I hate them with total hatred,     for your enemies are my enemies.23 Search me, O God, and know my heart;     test me and know my thoughts.24 Point out anything in me that offends you,     and lead me along the path of everlasting life.",PT3M18S,2020-05-25,2020-05-25,161645,United Kingdom,/results?search_query=United+Kingdom&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKcVpISFFoRTdXZ0lSZWlXSU1rT2ctTVE%253D,UCG37t6CNupqFsDwJpqwJzNg,20,7W9XOaxqoYo

Bitter family saga as mothers discover sons were switched at birth | 60 Minutes Australia,Entertainment,1195534,"9,880",954,"(2012) Imagine making a decision - just one decision - that would haunt you for life and rip away everything you loved. Back in 1991, Sandy Dawkins and Megs Clinton Parker discovered that their two-year-old sons had been switched at birth, that they were each raising a child that was not biologically their own. They could have swapped the boys over then and there. But they didn't. For the next two decades, we watched as Sandy and Megs tried to make their bizarre relationship work. But, perhaps inevitably, it all fell apart. Now, 23 years later, there's been yet another and even more extraordinary twist in this bitter family saga.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

New Horizons - Summiting the Solar System: Part 1,Science & Technology,305863,,,"Summiting the Solar System is a story of exploration at its most ambitious and extreme. On January 1, 2019, NASA's New Horizons spacecraft flies by a small Kuiper Belt Object known scientifically as 2014 MU69, but nicknamed ""Ultima Thule."" Ultima is four billion miles from Earth, and will be the most ancient and most distant world ever explored close up. It is expected to offer discoveries about the origin and evolution of our solar system. Chosen by the team and the public, the nickname honors the mythical land beyond the edges of the known world. But ""Summiting"" is much more than the story of a sophisticated, plutonium-fueled robotic spacecraft exploring far from the Sun. The New Horizons mission is powered as much by the passions of a small team of humans—men and women, scientists and engineers—for whom pushing the frontiers of the known, climbing the very peaks of the possible, has been the dream of many decades.More on the New Horizons mission: pluto.jhuapl.eduCredit: Geoff Haines Stiles of Geoff Haines Stiles Productions (GHSPi)",PT82M56S,2018-12-30,2018-12-30,115652,JHU Applied Physics Laboratory,/channel/UCz4r-ikQdWEj1gG1aFJTy-g,UCz4r-ikQdWEj1gG1aFJTy-g,20,gLjgJKIFzOQ

A10 Warthog vs SU25 Frogfoot - Flying Tank Comparison,Entertainment,159638,"4,034",207,"A10 Warthog vs SU25 Frogfoot - Flying Tank Comparison► Subscribe to Grid 88: http://goo.gl/UYzU9HA10 Warthog vs SU25 Frogfoot - Flying Tank ComparisonAt the height of the Cold War, the world's two superpowers created a new pair of battlefield aircraft, similar in both power and purpose. One is the America’s A10 Thunderbolt, known as warthog, and other is Russia’s SU25 also known as Frog-foot. Both aircraft were designed for the sole purpose of dedicated close air support. These tank busters remined highly effective in various battlefields since their inception. Today we’ll be pitting America’s A10 warthog against Russia’s SU25 frog-foot in this video and try to determine which aircraft is better. 1. OverviewSU25 is quite a bit smaller than the A10, but has a top speed of 606mph - that is over 167mph faster than the A10. Both aircraft can carry wide array of bombs, rockets, missiles, pods and fuel tanks under their wings, but A10 can take-off with almost 7,451Ib more weapons load than its Russian equivalent. The 30mm cannon on SU25 is significantly less impressive due to limited rounds than A10, but it still packs a killer punch. SU25 is smaller and faster, making it more difficult target. Both aircraft are heavily armored and considered safest and most feared close air support jets in the world. 2. PerformanceA10 is powered by 2 turbofan engines generating 18,130 pounds of thrust combined. The engines allow the aircraft to reach at maximum speed of 439mph. With ferry range of 2,580mi, the aircraft has combat radius of 290mi. A10 weighs around 24,959Ib and can take-off with maximum weight of 50,000Ib. With climb rate of 6,000ft/min, the aircraft can reach at maximum altitude of 45,000ft. On the other hand, major driver of SU25 performance is its two engines. The engines are capable of generating around 19,860 pounds of thrust. These are meant to drive the jet to maximum speed of 606mph. With the maximum range of 620mi, the aircraft can combat within the radius of 470mi. The frog-foot weighs around 21,605Ib and can take-off with maximum weight of 42,549Ib. With climb rate of 11,400 ft/min, the jet can reach at maximum altitude of 23,000ft.3. Armor & SurvivabilitySurvivability is an essential attribute of any successful ground attack aircraft. A10 excels in this category due to its heavy armor. For example, the engines are located a bit higher on the rear fuselage…In contrast SU25 is comparatively smaller and faster jet, which makes it a difficult target from ground fire, however it is less of a problem for guided missiles. Frog-foot is able to reach supersonic speeds when flown clean, the airframe can withstand 6.5 Gs…4. Radar & AvionicsA10 is equipped with improved communications, inertial navigation systems, night vision, fire control, weapons delivery systems and target penetration aids. The head-up display indicates air speed, altitude and dive angle on the windscreen. Pave Penny laser-tracking pods…Similarly, SU25 has an integral laser system for ranging, tracking and targeting with HUD designation. In terms of pods the aircraft has infrared and optical systems for both day & night time operations…5. FirepowerThe A10 has 11 hardpoints including 8 pylon stations under both wings, while remining 3 are fitted under the fuselage with a total payload capacity of 16,000 lb. A10 can carry up to 10 Maverick air-to-surface missiles…In contrast, the frog-foot is fitted with 11 hard points capable of carrying various rocket PODs, bombs and missiles. Bomb load outs include a variety of general purpose munitions, cluster bombs and other special purpose weaponry…Watch full video for detailed Conclusion.FOLLOW us on Social Media:► Facebook: facebook.com/thegrid88► Twitter: twitter.com/grid_88► Become a Patreonhttps://www.patreon.com/factsbox99Playlists► Military, Army, Navy & Air forcehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...►US Armyhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...► Russian Armyhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...► SUBSCRIBE so you never miss another video: http://goo.gl/UYzU9HCredits1) “The Descent” Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 Licensehttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...2) US Department of Defense3) Минобороны Россииhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/b...The appearance of US DOD and Минобороны России visual information does not imply or constitute their respective endorsements.

Inside Brazil's Biggest Prison Beauty Pageant,News & Politics,2342165,"35,442",821,"Brazil, known for its beautiful beaches and beautiful people, is home to the biggest pageants in the world. Each year, Miss World, Miss Universe, and Miss Earth are crowned in the country. And at the Penitenciaria Feminina da Capital in Sao Paolo—South America's largest all-female maximum security prison—so is Miss Max. Unlike traditional pageants, the contestants competing for the title of Miss Max are currently serving long sentences for crimes like drug trafficking, kidnapping, and even homicide. They are, however, judged using the standard pageant criteria: beauty, poise, and talent—plus their record of good behavior. This year, LGBTQ inmates can also vie for the title of Mr. Congeniality. We travel to Sao Paolo, Brazil, to capture the days of preparation leading up to the crowning of Miss Max, which includes runway training from a professional choreographer and a day of hair and makeup courtesy of some of Brazil's best stylists. We also talk with the incarcerated contestants about how a beauty competition can help them temporarily escape the monotony of their lives behind bars.Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-BROADLYCome find us:Broadly | https://broadly.vice.comFacebook | https://www.facebook.com/BroadlyTVTwitter | https://twitter.com/broadlyTumblr | http://broadlytv.tumblr.comInstagram | https://instagram.com/broadlyPinterest | https://www.pinterest.com/broadlytvNewsletter | http://bit.ly/1JKF1oA",PT38M49S,2016-01-07,2016-01-07,141717,VICE Life,/channel/UCfQDD-pbllOCXHYwiXxjJxA,UCfQDD-pbllOCXHYwiXxjJxA,20,3f-kl9l0bDw

""We now know, thanks to Edward Snowden- that all of us, Greek citizens, Brits, Americans are being spied and that all of our data - whether its text messages, selfies, G-allocation data from our iphones that we carry around with us - is being collected. Luke thinks that Snowden has done the world a great service by revealing this and thinks it’s got profound implications for democracy – and for all of us – for anyone who uses Facebook or Google or downloads videos from Youtube and so on.So that’s the big picture. On a micro level what we can do about this as citizens?""Luke Harding is a journalist, writer and award-winning correspondent with the Guardian. He has reported from Delhi, Berlin and Moscow and covered wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya and Ukraine. Between 2007 and 2011 he was the Guardian's Moscow bureau chief. The Kremlin expelled him from the country in the first case of its kind since the Cold War.His latest book ""The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World's Most Wanted Man"" was published in February by Guardian Faber. In June Oliver Stone bought film rights. Luke is the author of three previous non-fiction books. They are ""The Liar: The Fall of Jonathan Aitken"" (1997), nominated for the Orwell Prize; and ""WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy"" (2011), both written with David Leigh.

Day in the Life of a Typical Japanese University Student,Travel & Events,3773777,"106,305","1,705","A day in Japanese college student life in the greater Tokyo area.  Follow a Keio University student from morning until evening.  This is a day in the life of University student in Japan attending Keio University, one of the top universities in Japan.  Japan university student life is much different than the Japanese salaryman life as college students have a bit more freedom to pursue hobbies, especially in their senior year of school in Japan.  An average Japanese student in Tokyo may have between 15-23 course hours per week while a Japan University student 4th year Senior will have much less such as 9 hours of course hours per week. Yusuke, 22 year old Policy Management Major at Keio University lives with his parents in a 2 story house which is commuting distance to school via train and bus.  Typical Japanese University life outside of class and study, also allows for part-time jobs and also a social life with friends. In fact, many Japanese students take on part-time jobs and find the time to hang out with friends in groups and join Japanese University Circles.  Generally, a typical Japanese student’s class semester grade is based on assignments, presentations, group projects and 1 final exam at the end of the semester. But one interesting aspect about the Japanese university grading system is that many teachers don’t let students know how each category is weighted so students can’t calculate what they need to score on their final exam to earn a specific mark for the class.  Watch the video and let me know in the comments how this compares to your University Life in your country.Watch more Japan Day in the Life Series (Playlist):- https://bit.ly/2FXYTwzYusuke's YouTube Channel- https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCbmtRT...Join my Paolo from TOKYO community site to get Answers to Questions about Japan schools, travels, etiquette, food, etc. and to connect and share information about Japan.- https://discord.gg/xX4Y2twHelp support the channel and get my Toe-kyo Merch- https://teespring.com/stores/paolofro...-- Channel Support ---Want to help SUPPORT my channel, buy me a BEER or Maiko and I DINNER?

Discrimination and Disparities with Thomas Sowell,News & Politics,332385,"8,437",208,"Recorded March 14, 2018Rich or poor, most people agree that wealth disparities exist. Thomas Sowell discusses the origins and impacts of those wealth disparities in his new book, Discrimination and Disparities in this episode of Uncommon Knowledge. Sowell explains his issues with the relatively new legal standard of “disparate impact” and how it disregards the American legal principle of “burden of proof.” Sowell and Robinson discuss how economic outcomes vary greatly across individuals and groups and that concepts like “disparate impact” fail to take into account these variations. They chat about the impact of nuclear families on the IQs of individuals, as studies have not only shown that children raised by two parents tend to have higher levels of intelligence but also that first-born and single children have even higher intelligence levels than those of younger siblings, indicating that the time and attention given by parents to their children greatly impacts the child’s future more than factors like race, environment, or genetics. Sowell talks about his book in which he wrote extensively about National Merit Scholarship finalists who more often than not were the first-born or only child in a family. Sowell and Robinson go on to discuss historical instances of discrimination and how those instances affected economic and social issues within families, including discrimination created by housing laws in the Bay Area. They discuss unemployment rates, violence, the welfare state in regards to African American communities, and more.

Anyssa Bohanan has experienced the feeling on an extreme level, first living as one of the only African Americans in South Korea, and then as one of very few in Central Oregon. Her experiences being an extreme minority both at home and abroad range from amusing to life changing. She hopes that by sharing those experiences she can make the difference for at least one other person feeling the same way.Local news reporter, Anyssa Bohanan, is a self-proclaimed “Future Oprah.” In fact, she’s been interviewing her teddy bears since she was a toddler and attributes the fact that she can talk to anyone, anywhere, to growing up as an Army Brat. A two-year stint teaching English in South Korea taught Bohanan the true importance of escaping your comfort zone. From navigating the streets of a whole new country, to a journey of self-discovery in unfamiliar territory right here at home, she’s learning that being different doesn’t have to be a bad thing, no matter where you are.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Secrets Casinos Don't Want You To Know,Education,54729,348,70,"Check out these secrets casinos don't want you to know! From how to win at blackjack to beating the casino jackpot, this top 10 list of dark gambling secrets casino's don't want you to find out will surprise you! Subscribe to World5List: http://goo.gl/cpJSA6Check out our ""13 Amazing Pets Who Saved Their Owners"" video at: https://youtu.be/bMwLm16_Q-0Check out our ""7 Celebrities Who Gave Their Kids Up For Adoption"" video at: https://youtu.be/vVrlJFZ8sME9. Dealers...don't really make that much.To start off this list, I want you to think about your dream job. More than likely, it's a job where you can make money, yet have fun doing the job, and not minding coming in virtually every day to do it, right? At first glance, you might think that a casino dealer, whether it be Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, or some other game that requires a dealer, would be fun.8. Some Dealers Do Cheat and StealThey say that casinos are where people go to lose their money, and they're right more often than not. Yet, some people try and cheat the system to make sure they don't, and I'll be talking about that later. However, one person you wouldn't expect to cheat is the dealer. After all, while they ""work"" for the casino, they have no bias towards you. 7. Security Is Tighter Than You ThinkOk, think about Ocean's 11 and 13 (we don't talk about 12 here...). Remember how deep and detailed the security was in those casinos? How did Reuben say it?""They've got cameras, they've got locks, they've got vaults. They enough armed security to occupy Paris!""6. You Get Investigated When You Win BigPicture this. You've been playing the games all right and have been doing ok. You've done Poker, Blackjack, a few slots, and you just have the urge to play Roulette. You get this ""feeling"" in you to bet big, so you do, on 13. And it hits, and you walk away with $100,000. You're through the roof! But for security, they're looking into you the moment you got declared the winner.5. Poker Doesn't Have As Much Security ThoughSecurity is a big topic for casinos, which is why it has numerous spots on this list. But I was surprised to learn that when it comes to the various forms of Poker, security isn't as tight.Why? Because the players aren't playing the ""House"", they're playing each other. Interestingly enough, casinos don't make as much money as you think during high-stakes Poker games. And that's because all players get a set number of chips and try and take it from each other.4. Casinos Chips Are FilthyOk, this isn't exactly mind-blowing, but it's worth taking note for hygienic reasons. Casinos are meant to be clean, yes. After all, if it's filthy, no one will want to go and be there. But with the chips, you might be surprised how dirty they are.After all, these are chips that are being touched by many different people. 3. Casinos Are Designed To Keep You Inside ThemHave you ever been to a casino? Do you remember what it was like wandering the floor as you tried to find something? It can be very confusing. What's more, most casinos have only one entrance/exit, and that's exactly the point. Once you enter a casino, they don't want you to leave until all your money is spent.2. There ARE Games Aren't Stacked Against YouThere are a lot of catchphrases associated with casinos, but the most popular one is, ""The house always wins."" This is because most casino games are actually stacked in favor of the house. After all, it's their house, and they want to make money, right? That being said, there are games that aren't bent in the houses favor. If you have a little skill, and a little luck, you could do well.1. There ARE Games Meant To Screw YouWhile the casinos will never admit it, there are games designed to truly rip off players at their casinos. I mentioned Poker and Blackjack in the previous entry as games that can be good to players. But, there are ""variations"" of these classic games that casinos employ to basically rob you blind. Games like ""Three Card Poker"" or ""Double Exposure Blackjack"" to name a few.",PT11M41S,2018-05-23,2018-05-23,147717,World List,/channel/UC4dD7XXdwPIrTLStHwfsJOQ,UC4dD7XXdwPIrTLStHwfsJOQ,20,_KXF3YQCV-I

Cuba - nostalgia and change | DW Documentary,Education,541268,"2,979",188,"Fidel Castro brought revolution to Cuba in 1959. But the country has been stuck between nostalgia and new beginnings ever since. With its vintage cars and crumbling facades, Havana looks like it’s stuck in a time warp. But young Cubans are optimistic about the future, and material shortages make for inventiveness. To compensate for the lack of a reliable Internet, for example, they invented ""El Paquete,"" an elaborate information network that stretched across the island thanks to portable hard drives. It brings the Bundesliga, telenovelas and US TV shows to even the most remote villages.As the 1962 missile crisis finally fades into history, Cuba is slowly opening up. The owner of Havana’s most chic restaurant, ""La Guarida,"" has reached a deal with some young architects: The profits from the restaurant will go towards restoring the old mansion it’s housed in. This kind of trade-off is increasingly common.Our documentary shows a country caught between upbeat dreams for the future and nostalgic melancholy. It takes us from Havana to Santiago de Cuba, a city famous for its rum, to the Sierra Maestra mountains, steeped in revolutionary romance, and the white, sandy beaches in the north of the island._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Damaged Babies & Broken Hearts: Ukraine's commercial surrogacy industry | Foreign Correspondent,News & Politics,696853,"7,309",324,"Ukraine is the new ‘go-to’ destination for couples desperate to be parents. But our investigation uncovers an industry out of control that exploits surrogate mothers and leaves babies abandoned.With international surrogacy now banned in Thailand and India, a thriving industry has sprung up in Ukraine, attracting heterosexual couples from around the world, including Australia.  But how much do would-be parents really know about the business which delivers their baby?  In Motherland, Europe correspondent Samantha Hawley goes behind the slick surrogacy websites and glossy brochures to expose the industry’s dark underbelly.  In a 6-month investigation, Foreign Correspondent meets those caught up in Ukraine’s baby business and uncovers an industry with few rules and fewer scruples.  The new parent  “It was a reckless decision to make, because we didn’t have all the facts,” says English woman ‘Kate’ who turned to surrogacy after an illness left her unable to have a child. When the birth of her baby boy in Ukraine went badly, Kate couldn’t get him the urgent medical help he needed. She realised she was out of her depth. Now she worries about the long-term health effects on her baby.  The surrogate mother  “They don’t treat you as a human being,” says one birth mother, who signed up as a surrogate to feed her family after the war with Russia left her homeless.To earn a small fee, she endured forced terminations, caesareans and callous treatment at the hands of her agency. “Surrogate mothers…we’re just a flow of incubators,” she says.The abandoned child  We tracked down a little girl living in a children’s home in south-east Ukraine. She had been rejected by her American parents and was stateless and an orphan.  This is a common story, says Ukraine’s Children’s Ombudsman, who has reports of at least 10 children left behind by the parents and agencies who ‘commissioned’ them.  “This is an immoral business,” says the Ombudsman. “It does harm.” The businessman  And we put hard questions to the owner of one of Ukraine’s biggest surrogacy agencies, a man who was recently under house arrest facing charges of child trafficking and tax avoidance.Join us for this gripping and gut-wrenching tale.

We are more than amused by a few of the car salespeople or car dealers who contact us and state that we are making a 'small problem' sound far worse than it is. We know there are honest people in the car business, and we receive positive comments from many of them, but it's definitely a buyer beware world out on the car lot! For all of you car buyers who are well steeped in reality, if you watched the video ""Confessions of a car dealers backroom"" you understand why you need to see this video. By understanding what mistakes to avoid, you'll not only become a smarter car buyer, but you'll also better understand what not to tell a car dealer when buying a car. It's true that you can play all your cards up front with an honest dealer, but unfortunately, they represent the minority of dealer owners (truly transparent and honest dealers make up about 40% of all dealers), and you are unlikely to know the difference until it's far too late. Be smart, do your homework, and you'll come home with a car deal that's good for you and the dealer. After all, that's what fairness is all about. We encourage you to be fair and honest.

I would ask you to reflect on that,"" he said.Senator Brandis ruled out banning the burka.Labor and Greens senators stood and applauded Senator Brandis after his answer to Senator Hanson.Labor's Senate leader Penny Wong congratulated Senator Brandis.""It is one thing to wear religious dress as a sincere act of faith, there is another to wear it as a stunt here in the chamber,"" she said.For more from ABC News, click here: https://ab.co/2kxYCZYYou can watch more ABC News content on iview: https://ab.co/2mge4KHSubscribe to us on YouTube: http://ab.co/1svxLVEGo deeper on our ABC News In-depth channel: https://ab.co/2lNeBn2You can also like us on Facebook: http://facebook.com/abcnews.auOr follow us on Instagram: http://instagram.com/abcnews_auOr even on Twitter: http://twitter.com/abcnews",PT2M36S,2017-08-17,2017-08-17,162415,ABC News (Australia),/channel/UCVgO39Bk5sMo66-6o6Spn6Q,UCVgO39Bk5sMo66-6o6Spn6Q,20,XExggl6Q-vo

Florida Good Samaritan Video Released (US),Education,1263622,"9,121",458,"The just-released video above is from the Florida State Attorney’s Office, supporting a judge’s ruling that a citizen who opened fire on a man attacking a Lee County deputy last year was justified in using deadly force.David Katz, U.S. Law Shield of Florida Independent Program Attorney, said of the video release, “Normally, the police work to protect us, but as this video shows, an ordinary citizen had the opportunity to protect a law-enforcement officer under attack.”Since the original incident, Katz said that nothing has changed regarding the legalities of the case, and that attorney James Phillips’ recap of the facts and the law (see below) were thorough and complete. He said he understood why ordinary citizens would be interested in seeing for themselves how the situation occurred and was resolved.On Nov. 14, 2016, passerby Ashad Russell saw Edward Strother, 53, of Ocala, pin Deputy First Class Dean Bardes to the ground during a struggle on Exit 123 just off I-75 near Fort Myers. In the new video clips, Russell, who has a concealed weapons permit, can be seen walking up to the two with his pistol. He ordered Strother to stop.Katz said, “Ashad Russell cautiously approached, gave the assailant an opportunity to stop the attack, then acted to protect the Deputy, likely saving his life.”The new video shows that Russell approached the fight, drew his firearm, which he legally possessed, and he ordered the suspect to stop what he was doing multiple times. When the suspect didn’t, the good samaritan shot three times, resulting in Strother’s death.U.S. Law Shield of Florida Independent Program Attorney James Phillips analyzed the shooting after the event, saying, Florida Statute 790.012 allows a person to use deadly force if he or she reasonably believes such force is needed to either prevent death or great bodily harm that is imminent to either himself or to another person, in this situation the officer.”Click below to read our initial coverage of the confrontation.Florida Good Samaritan Analysis: Licensed Carrier Saves DeputyWe also reported that a U.S. Law Shield range affiliate in Florida donated a replacement handgun to Mr. Russell, whose carry gun was taken into evidence.

The Future of Colonizing Space- Neil deGrasse Tyson- WGS 2018,Education,1186145,"14,737","1,316","Space missions need to have a defensive component or economic benefit. With economic returns often uncertain, space programmes have tended to be led by governments, because only they can invest in programmes that have a long-term pay-off, whether economic or geopolitical. When it comes to saving humanity from an asteroid impact, Tyson stressed that rather than establishing colonies in space, we would be better to try to deflect the asteroid.تحدث نيل ديغراس تايسون، عالم الفيزياء الفلكية، أن البعثات الفضائية تُطلق عادةً إما لأغراض دفاعية أو اقتصادية لتبرير غايتها. وفي غياب ضمانات العائد الاقتصادي بالنسبة إلى القطاع الخاص، تتولى الحكومات إدارة جميع برامج الفضاء لما تملكه من قدره على الاستثمار في برامج ذات عائد طويل الأجل، سواء كان لهذا العائد بُعد اقتصادي أو جيوسياسي. أما بالنسبة إلى الدعوة لبناء مستعمرات على سطح الكواكب الأخرى تحسبًا لأي دمار قد يحلّ بكوكب الأرض نتيجة تعرضه لاصطدام نيزك، قال تايسون إن تحويل مسار النيزك يظل هو الحل الأمثل في هذه المرحلة",PT79M52S,2018-03-11,2018-03-11,112235,World Government Summit,/channel/UCW4lQ2ZZh9EaVNpVtA6hX1Q,UCW4lQ2ZZh9EaVNpVtA6hX1Q,20,X_m1mPtYzTk

A Reagan Forum with Judge Jeanine Pirro — 09/05/2018,Nonprofits & Activism,1707652,"10,757",697,"Get the story the Fake News media doesn't want you to hear in the #1 New York Times bestseller: a withering indictment of the Deep State plot against Trump and a firsthand account of the real presidency, based on interviews with the Trump family and top administration officials.At this point in American history, we are the victims of a liberal sabotage of the presidency unlike anything we've ever witnessed. Nevertheless President Trump continues to fight every day to keep his promise to Make America Great Again. Today that bold idea has already led to a conservative judge on the Supreme Court, tax reform, and deregulation that has unleashed an economy stronger than anyone could have imagined.But there are dark forces that seek to obstruct and undermine the president and reverse the results of the 2016 presidential election. They are part of a wide-ranging conspiracy that would seem incredible if it weren't being perpetrated openly. Driven by ambition, blinded by greed, and bound by a common goal-to unseat the 45th President of the United States-this cabal is determined to maintain its wrongful hold on national political power.Jeanine Pirro is a highly respected judge, former district attorney, elected politician, sought-after legal commentator, author, and champion of women's rights. Pirro is the host of Justice with Judge Jeanine and for three years hosted Judge Jeanine Pirro, for which she won an Emmy. She also appears regularly as a legal analyst and judicial commentator on Today, Good Morning America, The Early Show, 60 Minutes, CNN, and the Fox News Channel. In 1990, she became the first elected female judge to sit on the Westchester County court bench. In 1993, Judge Pirro was also elected district attorney of Westchester County, once again setting a precedent as the first female to hold that position.

Embracing Borderline Personality Disorder - Dr Keith Gaynor,Nonprofits & Activism,457763,,,"Dr. Gaynor presents a thoroughly engaging lecture about Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). The current working definition of BPD is 'a pervasive disorder of the emotion regulation system'. Dr. Gaynor outlines how BPD presents differently to 'normal' depression and bipolar depression. He talks about common behaviours (addictions, self-harm, acting out) that some people engage in when attempting to regulate the emotional dysregulation caused by BPD. He addresses the reasons that BPD symptoms may develop for an individual and refers to three evidence based treatments: Dialectic Behavioural Therapy (DBT), Mentalisation and Schema Therapy. Dr. Gaynor also stresses the important contribution made by Margaret Linehan, who is considered the leading expert internationally in the field of BPD.",PT40M2S,2013-10-23,2013-10-23,145352,Aware,/channel/UCSaN7iyXu4EAOP_Txt83v7w,UCSaN7iyXu4EAOP_Txt83v7w,20,fhOotNCqg2E

The projections are the subject of dispute, with scientists continually correcting their estimates upward. Is this just panic-mongering or are these scenarios within the realm of possibility?Can we make any reliable predictions about the world’s oceans? If all the ice in Antarctica and Greenland were to melt, sea levels would rise by more than 66 meters. The consequences for coastal populations are gradually becoming clear. By 2100, coastlines around the world could change radically. The research being conducted by marine scientists will decide how affected regions can prepare for the disaster on the horizon.

Mathews | TEDxMileHigh,Nonprofits & Activism,52002,883,20,"In the United States, 67% of inmates released from prison will return having committed a new crime within three years. Simply put, the criminal justice system doesn’t accomplish what it was designed to do. But why is it failing? Having worked in both punishment and rehabilitation, Brandon W. Mathews argues that the solution might be simpler than we thought. Dr. Brandon Mathews is a passionate criminal justice professional with expertise in the development and implementation of innovative evidence-based correctional treatment and supervision programs. Brandon is an active researcher with the Alliance for Criminal Justice Innovation, publishing on topics like recidivism reduction, structured decision-making, risk assessment, and criminal justice education.

"Amazon, Jeff Bezos and collecting data | DW Documentary",Education,730658,"6,298",323,"No company stores more data than Amazon, the former online bookseller. Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has become the richest man in the world. Every second Euro in online trading is spent at Amazon. Is the IT giant, with its unabated growth, about to turn our economic system upside down?Amazon is a machine that can simultaneously observe, compare and analyze more than 300 million people worldwide. The company is not just a marketplace, market supervisor and provider of more and more services and consumer items - it also controls all the data streams in this market and uses them to its own benefit. Who suspects that a single click on an Amazon page will forward information to the company that fills a printed DIN-A-4 page? A conversation with Alexa, watching a streaming offer on Amazon-Prime, ordering vegetables via Amazon-Fresh - all this put together creates a whole library of information about every customer. The group collects everything - it just won’t reveal what conclusions it draws from it. What would be possible if data from other, new business areas were added? In the USA, Amazon is also active in the health and insurance sectors, and police officers are using its facial recognition software to search for wanted persons._______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Our democracy no longer represents the people. Here's how we fix it | Larry Lessig | TEDxMidAtlantic,Nonprofits & Activism,1516317,"32,661","1,860","Harvard Professor Lawrence Lessig makes the case that our democracy has become corrupt with money, leading to inequality that means only 0.02% of the United States population actually determines who's in power. Lessig says that this fundamental breakdown of the democratic system must be fixed before we will ever be able to address major challenges like climate change, social security, and student debt. This is not the most important problem, it's just the first problem.Lawrence Lessig is the Roy L. Furman Professor of Law and Leadership at Harvard Law School, former director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard University, and founder of Rootstrikers, a network of activists leading the fight against government corruption.

Adopted By The West: China's Abandoned Children (Family Documentary) | Real Stories,Film & Animation,228679,"1,793",151,"This documentary chronicles the experiences of mothers who represent three distinct aspects of the story: A Chinese mother who abandoned her baby; a white, middle-class North American mother who adopted a Chinese girl; and a Canadian mother preparing to pick up her baby from China. Each one of these mothers shares her experiences and struggles reconciling the powerful emotions and ideas that both abandonment and adoption, from an alien culture, entail.Their stories come together into a seamless exploration of the universal themes of mother and child, longing and belonging, culture and identity. These women are bound together, not necessarily by blood, but by their inevitable and perhaps endless search for one another.From EchoesFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/RealStoriesC...Instagram - @realstoriesdocsTwitter: https://twitter.com/realstoriesdocsContent licensed from Cargo Film & Releasing.

Prisoner Yoshie Shiratori had had enough. He was forced to confess to a murder he did not commit, falsely imprisoned in Aomori Prison, beaten and tortured every night by prison guards, and, now worse, prosecutors were seeking the death penalty. In his mind, it was time to go; but Aomori Prison wasn’t the easiest to escape. Regardless, Yoshie Shiratori had nothing to lose, and so at 5:30 am he made his move. He knew there would be a 15 minute gap in the patrol time as he had studied the guards’ routine for months; and when the coast was clear, he pulled out a metal wire (which he had smuggled in from the bathhouse) and started to pick the lock. (This was originally the metal support ring that was wrapped around the bathing buckets inmates used to wash themselves). His hands were stiff from the wintry cold, but after a few minutes of picking, he had success, and his cell door swung open. But he wasn’t out of the woods yet, because there were more locked doors ahead. He knew he only had a few minutes left before the guards would return, and so he wasted no time attempting to pick his way through the remaining security doors.Now fortunately for him, he was able to make it out of the facility, but the bad news was that he was only halfway to freedom. You see, he was still well within the search perimeter, which meant at any moment the alarm could go off and he’d still be caught.At 5:45am the guards returned, peering into his cell; and this is what they saw - Shiratori sound asleep in his futon bed. ...",PT25M3S,2019-10-01,2019-10-01,147275,Kento Bento,/channel/UCLOwKVD0bYHxaDZxXkK4piw,UCLOwKVD0bYHxaDZxXkK4piw,20,oI8trlbCbU8

German auto giant Volkswagen caught lying on a spectacular scale | 60 Minutes Australia,Entertainment,254086,"3,611",312,"(2015) Volkswagen is right in the middle of a corporate scandal of epic proportions. The German auto giant has been caught lying, on a spectacular scale. 11 million of its 'clean' diesel engine cars were equipped with software deliberately programmed to cheat pollution tests. A blatant con that is highly illegal. In Australia, 10 Volkswagen models have now been suspended from sale, and 77-thousand vehicles face recall at the very least. Volkswagen's ruthless drive to be world number one, hid a dirty secret - diesel engines that couldn't deliver on high performance and still meet environmental standards. Michael Usher goes inside the Volkswagen lie, and meets the small band of engineering students who’ve brought a giant to its knees.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

"Money, luxury and fame – the new super-rich of India | DW Documentary",Education,2836966,"17,679","2,576","Only the US and China currently have more billionaires than India. Some of them are as famous as pop stars and enjoy similar adulation. Their social media accounts have millions of followers – in a country where more than half the population lives below the poverty line and has no electricity or fresh water. India’s super-rich have been dubbed the ""new maharajas."" The sources of their seemingly unlimited wealth are almost as varied as their values and lifestyles. 23-old Evan Luthra uses his father's seed capital to invest in new ideas in the software industry. He loves luxury, meets the young moneyed elite in fashionable destinations around the world, and is active on all the social networks. Abhimanyu Alsisar, nephew of the Maharajah of Jaipur, runs a chain of luxury hotels in the ancient palaces of India and invests in music events. Kalpana Saroj comes from the lowest caste in India and has worked her way up from destitution to become a multimillionaire - but she never forgets her background, and helps impoverished farmers in her homeland with medical care and gifts of money. Vijay Mallya even bought his own Formula 1 racing team, but faces a long prison sentence for fraudulent bankruptcy and tax evasion should he return to India. The documentary is the result of six months of investigative research and offers a deep insight into the everyday and professional lives of India’s super-rich.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Shot with a hidden camera, it shows the brutal conditions in Chinese fur farms, and how migrants are exploited in Italian tanneries.Fine handmade bags from Gucci, Prada and Max Mara in the displays of luxurious fashion boutiques are objects of passionate desire. Luxury labels generate over 70 percent of their turnover with leather products. But hardly anyone knows the reality of their production. The major fashion brands comply with a modern code of conduct that also applies to its direct suppliers. But who controls the subcontractors? The film looks behind the beautiful displays at where the raw material comes from: tanneries in Italy, where migrants produce the leather for luxury handbags under miserable and unsafe working conditions; and behind the scenes in China’s fur animal industry, where the animals are kept under catastrophic hygienic conditions and before being cruelly slaughtered.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The Unbelievable Life of Princess Alice | The Queen's Mother-in-Law | Real Royalty,Education,764157,"7,640",430,"Few have heard of the Queen’s mother-in-law, Princess Alice. And yet, the life story of Prince Philip’s mother almost defies belief.A great granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Prince Philip’s mother married into the Greek royal family – only to see the Greek monarchy overthrown by revolution. Fleeing into exile, she suffered a severe nervous breakdown. She was locked away and subjected to experimental treatments by psychiatrists – including Sigmund Freud himself. The trauma had a shattering effect on Princess Alice’s marriage and led to a fractured childhood for her only son Prince Philip.Philip’s mother eventually fought her way back from mental illness, and became an unlikely hero of World War II – risking her life to hide a Jewish family. When her son married the future Queen Elizabeth in 1948, Alice turned down the option of a cosy royal life. Instead she chose to dedicate herself to working with the poor in Greece, gave away all her possessions and even founded her own religious order.  From Elizabeth II to Cleopatra, Real Royalty peels back the curtain to give a glimpse into the lives of some of the most influential families in the world, with new full length documentaries posted every week covering the monarchies of today and all throughout history.Subscribe to Real Royalty:",PT47M35S,2020-02-09,2020-02-09,143621,Real Royalty,/channel/UCO7E9XfJ3_sb8GNiaP563fQ,UCO7E9XfJ3_sb8GNiaP563fQ,19,rwIpxNHVHpk

While we have no interest or intention in breaking any law, we are willing to stand up for freedom and the constitution at any time and at any place and do so in a responsible and productive manner. It is our goal to create free and open discussion whenever possible in an effort to educate both ourselves and anyone with a desire to learn.

We are not attorneys or scholars, however we have been involved in professional photography for over 30 years and have had our rights and freedoms challenged more times than we can remember. No one group or person has the ability to effect change across the board, however we are committed to doing our part by continuing to stand up for our constitutional right to free press and the right to take photographs and video in public.

What the Ancients Knew - Rome,Education,922497,"5,094",395,"More than 2,000 years ago, the Roman army swept across Europe, northern Africa, and the Middle East. Backed by the legions, their military, and engineering skills, the Romans built one of the largest empires in history, dominating as many as 36 modern nations. Technology helped shape the ancient world and reverberates in our Western lifestyle and amenities today. But the Roman legacy is less about invention itself than about the spreading of the ancient technology. Rather than invent most of what they became famous for, the Romans adopted, perfected, and spread their enemies' inventions throughout their empire.Hosted by Jack Turner.

The people who run America now barely interact with it, and in his #1 New York Times, best-selling book, Ship of Fools, Carlson offers a blistering critique of our new overlords. Traditional liberals who worried about whales and defended free speech have been replaced by authoritarians who hide their hard-edged agenda behind identity politics. They’ll fleece you while lecturing you about bathrooms, plastic straws, and safe spaces.“Left and right,” Carlson says, “are no longer meaningful categories in America. The rift is between those who benefit from the status quo, and those who don’t.” Our leaders are fools, Carlson concludes, “unaware that they are captains of a sinking ship.” At this event, and in his signature fearless and witty style, he addresses the all-important question: How do we put the country back on course?About this eventhttp://www.independent.org/events/det...INDEPENDENT INSTITUTE ONLINE:FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/independentinstTWITTER: http://twitter.com/independentinstYOUTUBE: https://www.youtube.com/user/independ...WEBSITE: http://www.independent.org",PT66M54S,2018-11-02,2018-11-02,127165,Independent Institute,/channel/UCtMWEs-0VzhOboqaGomEHuQ,UCtMWEs-0VzhOboqaGomEHuQ,20,vbv2FQ9GVUg

Having babies can take a big toll on you physically and mentally and, for these supersize families, that toll has been multiplying constantly. On this episode we see what it’s like for the parents of these supersize families to recover from or keep going with the baby train, and how they manage to cope.In Sunderland, mum of 11 Amanda Allan is losing weight and enjoying getting her life back on track so much she wonders if enough is enough. But her husband Tony – mechanic and pigeon breeder – wants even more. Will Tony be able to sway Amanda with his cheeky charm or will the soon-to-be grandparents be dissuaded by the constant reminders from their embarrassed 15 year old daughter. Meanwhile in Dundee, Mormons Roy and Emma Hann are both keen to expand their 12 strong brood. But with 43 year old Emma still breastfeeding 19 month old Posy several times each night she’s exhausted and it’s taking her longer than usual to conceive. Nurse Roy is also away several nights of the week for his job so this adds to the already growing pile of obstacles they are trying to overcome. With finances stretched, energy levels flagging and time running out will she have to concede that enough is finally enough? #16KidsandCounting #BiggestFamilyContent licensed from All3Media.

But legends about the Nazi dictator's lived on. Was his body ever found? Did he manage to escape?After Hitler, aides poured gasoline on his body and set it alight in the garden of his chancellery. A few days later, the Soviets discovered the remains. But the body was burned beyond recognition, and they could not be sure it was his. Only after a top-secret investigation could Hitler be positively identified, thanks to information provided by his dentist. At the same time, Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin publicly stated that his army had been unable to find Hitler’s body. Wild rumors swirled about Hitler's death. Stalin even accused some of the Allies of helping him escape. What were the secrets behind this deception?

His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.Daryl Davis graduated from Howard University with a degree in Jazz. As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley’s Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.In 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.Since his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a “certificate of friendship” from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. He’s even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kelly’s granddaughter.Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations.

Yuval Noah Harari on the myths we need to survive,News & Politics,972498,"10,767",853,"Want to join the debate? Check out the Intelligence Squared website to hear about future live events and podcasts: http://www.intelligencesquared.com __________________________Filmed at the Royal Geographical Society on 23rd September 2015.Myths. We tend to think they’re a thing of the past, fabrications that early humans needed to believe in because their understanding of the world was so meagre. But what if modern civilisation were itself based on a set of myths? This is the big question posed by Professor Yuval Noah Harari, author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, which has become one of the most talked about bestsellers of recent years. In this exclusive appearance for Intelligence Squared, Harari will argue that all political orders are based on useful fictions which have allowed groups of humans, from ancient Mesopotamia through to the Roman empire and modern capitalist societies, to cooperate in numbers far beyond the scope of any other species.To give an example, Hammurabi, the great ruler of ancient Babylon, and the US founding fathers both created well-functioning societies. Hammurabi’s was based on hierarchy, with the king at the top and the slaves at the bottom, while the Americans’ was based on freedom and equality between all citizens. Yet the idea of equality, Harari will claim, is as much a fiction as the idea that a king or rich nobleman is ‘better’ than a humble peasant. What made both of these societies work was the fact that within each of them everyone believed in the same set of imagined underlying principles. In a similar vein, money is a fiction that depends on the trust that we collectively put in it. The fact that it is a ‘myth’ has not impeded its usefulness. It has become the most universal and efficient system of mutual trust ever devised, allowing the development of global trade networks and sophisticated modern capitalism.Professor Harari came to the Intelligence Squared stage to explain how the fictions that we believe in are an inseparable part of human culture and civilisation.",PT87M15S,2015-10-23,2015-10-23,163157,Intelligence Squared,/channel/UCaqcvH8EvUtePORpN03jLMg,UCaqcvH8EvUtePORpN03jLMg,20,UTchioiHM0U
21 Most Unbelievable Doppelgangers,Entertainment,1156828,"7,455",640,"Which of these doppelgangers do you feel is the best matched? Let us know in the comments below. Subscribe to our channel for more fun videos just like this – thanks for watching!  14 - Brother from another mother… This image went viral within hours of it being posted! Neil Douglas was catching a flight when he was seated next to his doppelganger! Robert Stirling was on the same flight to County Clare, and they were both strangely enough, booked into the same hotel in Ireland. They did of course celebrate by having a pint later that night! 13 - Seeing Double… This is Jacky Vasquez, she’s a recent high school graduate and she can add Ariana Grande double to her CV as well! She often sports the famous cat ears and high ponytail in her Instagram photos.  12 - Too Good to be true… Some people believe that this is just fake, but Amanda Fisher and Meredith Pond are in fact complete strangers. A friend told Amanda about a girl on Instagram that looked just like her, and Amanda went on to try find her. Many people commented that it was a fake, same haircut, same pose etc, but Meredith was traced on Facebook and the girls have been swapping pictures. What do you think?11 - Conspiracy Theorists are out… This article has been doing the rounds on the net this September of 2016, of a former Satanic Leader, Zeena Schreck bearing a more than striking resemblance to Taylor Swift. Well, you can imagine what the haters are saying about Taylor. There is definitely a resemblance in this particular shot, but luckily the rest bear no further similarities. Also a further note, Zeena is no longer involved in Satanic activities, and is living a good life as a graphic artist, muso and animal rights activist.  10 - Search and you will find… That’s what Irish TV presenter, Niamh Geaney did. She launched a campaign to look for her twin and was amazed when she discovered someone who looks just like her, living an hour away! Karen Branigan looks a lot like Niamh, however it got even better! Niamh ended up meeting another woman, who looks even more like her than the first! This woman was from Italy, and Niamh travelled to Genoa to meet her.9- Body Double… This is 21- year-old Ty Jones, who says that looking like Ed Sheeran is messing with his love life. Firstly, he says he is pretty shy – so to constantly have people approaching him, doesn’t make him feel good. Then when he does get a girlfriend, they get a bit jealous when other women keep coming on to him. Tough life kid.  8 - Cut from the same cloth… To the left – Rupert Grint from the Harry Potter Movies and to the right, a portrait of Scottish painter, Sir David Wilkie.7 - No longer one of a kind… Ciara Murphey headed over to study in Germany. She was from Ireland, and she couldn’t understand why people kept asking her if she was in the country with her sister. That exact situation was happening to Cordelia Roberts who was from the UK. The girls eventually bumped into each other, and they’re now best friends and are dubbed The Twins around college.  6 - Part of Me… There have been so many stories about the uncanny resemblance between Zooey Deschanel and Katy Perry, but Katy has another doppelganger over in the UK. Francesca Brown from England says, it wasn’t a problem until Katy married Russel Brand – then random people would stop her, ask for her photo and autograph. Unfortunately, the comparisons haven’t been a help to Francesca, an aspiring actress, because it prevents her from getting gigs.5 - Thought Provoking… Hank Azaria bears a striking resemblance to the Philosopher, Rudolf Steiner who was born in 1861. He was known to say: “""Thinking… is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colours and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas."" So I wonder what he would have thought about this…4 - Will the real Emma Watson please stand up… There seems to be no name attached to the girl on the left, but this is definitely one of the closet lookalikes I have seen yet. Reminds me of the time Dolly Parton entered a Dolly Parton lookalike contest and didn’t win!3 - Seeing is Believing… Quite a funny doppelganger is comedian Jack Black and his hilarious resemblance to the lead character in a classic opera – The  Barber of Seville.  2 - What Makes you beautiful… I’m sure this chap receives a lot of attention from the fairer sex, because his resemblance, right down to the cheeky dimples, is incredible. I wonder if Harry Styles is aware that there is 2 of him walking around?!?1 - No Make-Up SelfieYou would swear that was an image of Scarlet Johansson after she just woke up – except that it’s the image of a complete and total stranger to Scarlet – but she does bear a striking similarity to the famous celeb, doesn’t she?",PT6M54S,2017-01-27,2017-01-27,14331,Believe That,/channel/UCeYb7zAe5ehU5Gi7RC570JQ,UCeYb7zAe5ehU5Gi7RC570JQ,20,m7zESelVZzQ

Pan from protesters to riot police outside Athens university21. Rocks being thrown at riot policeSTORYLINEProtesters clashed with riot police across Athens on Wednesday, torching cars, hurling gasoline bombs and sending Christmas shoppers fleeing in panic during a general strike against the government's latest austerity measures.Police fired tear gas and flash grenades as the violence escalated outside parliament and spread to other parts of the capital.Angry unions triggered the 24-hour strike to protest new labour reforms and pay cuts as Greece struggles to reshape its economy under conditions set by a 110 (b) billion euro (146 (b) billion US dollar) international bailout. The strike also grounded flights, closed factories, disrupted hospitals and shut down trains, ferries and buses across the country.It was the seventh strike this year by unions appalled at a wave of austerity policies meant to pull Greece out of its worst financial crisis since World War II.In Athens, youths wearing black masks and ski goggles used sledgehammers to smash paving stones and hurled the rubble at police. Rioting youths torched several cars, overturned trash bins and vandalised storefronts, tossing Christmas decorations into the street.At least 10 people were detained on Wednesday and five were hurt, including a conservative politician who was beaten in the street by protesters. Two people were injured in Athens and three in Greece's second largest city, Thessaloniki, where another anti-austerity protest turned violent.Wednesday's violence erupted after 20-thousand protesters marched to parliament in Athens chanting ""No sacrifice for the rich!""Crippled by high budget deficits and a mountain of debt, Greece was saved from bankruptcy in May by an international rescue loan package. In return, the Socialist government slashed pensions and salaries, hiked taxes, raised retirement ages and eased restrictions on private sector layoffs.Late on Tuesday, the government won a key vote in parliament on new labour reforms that include deeper pay cuts, salary caps and involuntary staff transfers at state companies.The new law also reduces unions' collective bargaining power in the private sector, allowing employers to substantially cut salaries.Unions said Wednesday's strike aimed to pressure the Socialists into slowing down the spending cuts they said were hurting average Greeks.Journalists are also holding a 24-hour strike, causing blackouts for TV, radio and internet news, and newspapers will not be published on Thursday.Further transport strikes are planned for Thursday and Friday.You can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/you...

North Korea was definitely the weirdest country I had ever visited and throughout that trip I kept wondering what life was like in the neighboring South Korea, because it used to be the same country just over 60 years ago.To answer my questions, this year I traveled to South Korea and made this video, where I compare my time in the North and my time in the South. I still have a lot of questions about the whole situation, but one thing was clear - the daily lives of the Korean people couldn't be any more different than they are right now.My favorite books about North Korea:Dear Leader by Jang Jin Sung - http://amzn.to/2vEkrrE;Escape From Camp 14 by Blaine Harden - http://amzn.to/2vEz6U1;Nothing To Envy by Barbara Demick - http://amzn.to/2vzieiI;1984 by George Orwell (I couldn't believe how similar some things in North Korea felt to the ones in the book) - http://amzn.to/2vE92s8.Videos about North Korea:My Daily Life In North Korea (my video from North Korea): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMoSy...10 Days in North Korea Documentary: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xs--...Escape From North Korea TED Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdxPC...Subscribe!YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/JacobLaukaitisFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JacobLaukaitisInstagram: https://instagram.com/jacoblaukaitis/I want to thank my friends Donghyuk Shin, Vytautas Jašauskas, Urtė Laukaitytė and Leeann Roybal-Shin for their continuous support and helping making this video.

From Romania With Love (Adoption Documentary) | Real Stories,Education,997426,"8,291",452,"In 1990 Romania, the world was stunned by what was revealed: Images of orphanages, of starving, freezing unloved children, suffering shocking untold misery.Crammed into small rooms, bed-bound on rotting faeces stained matresses, they were closeted away from the society and often malnourished.Many of them in fact were not orphans, but had been placed in the institutions by the desperately poor families who had been forced to have more children than necessary as part of Nicolae Ceausescu’s insane population building policy.Thousands of parents all over the world responded by going to Romania to adopt a child. In some cases it took as little as two weeks to complete the process.324 children were officially adopted into English families and 787 into Irish families. This documentary will tell some of their stories, as we trace the progress of a group of these Romanian orphans and their adoptive families.Want to watch more full-length Documentaries?

An online love scam that jailed a mum for five years — An Innocent Abroad: Pt 2 | Australian Story,News & Politics,642014,"5,600",307,"Left alone in a Cambodian prison, Australian mother-of-two Yoshe Taylor had all but given up fighting for her release.""I actually thought the death penalty was a much better idea than being in jail for 23 years,"" she says.The local court rejected Yoshe's claims that she was set up by a drug syndicate via a dating website and she was concerned for her children's ongoing welfare.It wasn't until a group of lawyers joined forces that the tide started to turn in Yoshe's favour. The lawyers discovered that three other Australian victims had been scammed by the same drug syndicate and then released — but that somehow this evidence hadn’t been shared in time to rescue Yoshe from serving six years in jail.Now back in Australia, Yoshe is sharing her story for the first time, in a warning to others about the perils of online romance.This is a two-part Australian Story.

(THE 7 CHOICES)]If you were put in charge of one mission - to take down the North Korean regime - a mission that had previously left world leaders beaten and befuddled, where failure could result in changes to the political and physical landscape for generations to come….what would you do?And time is of the essence here, as the longer you wait, the likelier it is for Dear Leader to complete development of nukes capable of reaching the continental US, or perhaps anywhere else in the world. Actually, according to some reports, it might already be too late!But whether North Korea actually fires is another question altogether. If we are to rid the world of this nefarious regime - I’m talking the regime not the people - we have to consider the options.

The Women Who Can't Stop Having Babies | Full Documentary | Big Families,People & Blogs,1668641,"23,626",878,"Are these women addicted to having babies? In this British TV documentary, we follow some of the UK's largest families and investigate why and how these families are able to add to their already bulging households. In this episode, we meet: The Radfords are pregnant with their 17th child and for Noel and sue the process still hasn’t lost its magic. But with Noel working 80 hour weeks at his bakery just to keep his cramped household fed, when is enough really enough? And with mum reaching the age when having a baby becomes increasingly dangerous, not just for the child but for herself, is it selfish to keep pursuing her dream and is her desire for more children less of a mothering instinct and more of an addiction?

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia.

I've studied nuclear war for 35 years -- you should be worried. | Brian Toon | TEDxMileHigh,Nonprofits & Activism,3405751,"39,969","4,926","For the first time in decades, it's hard to ignore the threat of nuclear war. But as long as you're far from the blast, you're safe, right? Wrong. In this sobering talk, atmospheric scientist Brian Toon explains how even a small nuclear war could destroy all life on earth -- and what we can do to prevent it. A professor in the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at the University of Colorado-Boulder, Brian Toon investigates the causes of the ozone hole, how volcanic eruptions alter the climate, how ancient Mars had flowing rivers, and the environmental impacts of nuclear war. He contributed to the U.N.’s Nobel Peace Prize for climate change and holds numerous scientific awards, including two NASA medals for Exceptional Scientific Achievement. He is an avid woodworker.

Most Dangerous Ways To School | HIMALAYA (India) | Free Documentary,Entertainment,2052569,"25,418",642,"Twice a year the forbidding journey to the boarding school is necessary.  Father Latak, looks to the sky and attempts to predict how the weather will develop. Only when he is sure that no storm is brewing, he starts to prepare the children for the trip over the river.  It is a route that is so notorious, that it even has a name: Chadar- the path over the cloak of ice.  One last time, his ten year old son Motup, plays in front of their hut. Motup is one of the few kids who regularly leave the village in order to attend one of the the better schools in town. Then the family gets ready for the long trip. The mother has sewn thick wool socks for the father and the children, and Tebean prayers and mantras are recited for protection along the way.  Then the trip begins, where the children muss trust completely the experience and skill of their father.The first steps, only a few kilometres until the frozen river, seem easy for the family.  But father Latak recognizes immediately that the spring has come early this year and the sun has already began to compromise the ice. This is not a good sign, since the thinner the ice the more dangerous the trip becomes. Latak goes before the children and tests with a stick before each step on the ice. Often the ice cracks a bit, but the ice remains whole.  Latak knows that no one should travel the Chadar without a good reason. But the education of the children is a good enough reason to take on the risks involved.  He knows that if he goes first and the ice carries his weight, that it will also carry the weight of the children.  If it does not, it will be he that will fall in the icy water and not his two children. At the same time, Latak, Motup and the other members of the crew must keep a close eye on the mountains.  The massive mountain ranges on both sides of them seem to be a scene form a picture book, peaceful and lordly. But there is danger lurking. At any given time, an avalanche can break out.  Many times before people have been caught by avalanches here.In the mean time the sun has already thawed the middle of the river.  But since there are steep rocks right and left, Latak must now search for a new path for them to continue on. He leaves Motup behind him and luckily finds a way. It is a 20 cm wide path on the rocks at the edge of the river, and up to ten meters high.They need almost an hour, skipping from rock to rock until they finally reach an area where the river is again covered with ice. Now they must find a place to set up camp as soon as possible before it becomes dark and the temperatures sink to as low as -30 degrees Celsius. Latak knows a cave where they will be protected and finally be able to get some rest.  They must gather their strength because the most dangerous part of the Chadar still lies before them.The ice is almost completely melted.  Only a 50 cm wide strip borders right and left the ice-cold water, making the river absolutely impassible.  Rocky overhangs above the ice block the way. Father and son must now crawl its way to school.  Father Latak tests his way over the ice on his belly.  After any progress made, he pulls his son by their hands to him. There are countless dangerous situations that make this way to school so unpredictable.  But after four days it is over, they have reached their goal; the city of Leh and the school.",PT48M2S,2015-09-07,2015-09-07,126664,Himalaya,/results?search_query=Himalaya&sp=EiG4AQHCARtDaElKdlRVUzctdTVsVGtSQVFKa2NIc3A0VG8%253D,UCijcd0GR0fkxCAZwkiuWqtQ,20,EEJpkEctSEA

Thomas Sowell on the Origins of Economic Disparities,News & Politics,306830,"7,562",170,"Recorded on April 1, 2019Is discrimination the reason behind economic inequality in the United States? Thomas Sowell dismisses that  question with a newly revised edition of his book Discrimination and Disparities. He sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss the long history of disparities among humans around the world and throughout time. He argues that discrimination has significantly less of a role to play in inequality than contemporary politicians give it credit for, and that something as incontrovertible as birth order of children has a more significant and statistically higher impact on success than discrimination. He discusses why parental attention is the most important aspect of a child’s intellectual development. Sowell goes on to break down different minority groups around the world who went on to have more economic and political success than their majority counterparts, such as the Indians in East Africa, Jewish people in Eastern Europe, Cubans in the United States, and the Chinese in Malaysia. He argues that there is an underlying assumption that if discrimination was absent equality would prevail, which historically has been proven wrong. Sowell goes on to discuss changes in crime rates and poverty since the expansion of US welfare programs in the 1960s and how this has had a huge impact on the success of African Americans. He talks about his own experience growing up in New York, how housing projects used to be considered a positive place to live, and his experience as the first member of his family to enter the seventh grade. Robinson asks Sowell his thoughts on the case for reparations currently being made in Congress, and Sowell presents an argument about why a plan for reparations is not only illogical but also impossible to implement, with so many US citizens’ ancestors arriving long after the Civil War. He also explains that slavery was common throughout the known world for thousands of years and that abolition movements didn’t begin anywhere in the world until the late 18th century. He reminds us that the United States was not the only country guilty of participating in slavery and yet is the only country debating reparations.

What You Need To Know Before Stepping Foot Inside Walmart Again,Entertainment,131250,"2,485",227,"You may feel as though you're pretty familiar with Walmart. The mega-retailer brand is a household name and one of the most recognizable brands in the country, if not the world — but there's probably a lot you don't know. This is the untold truth of the American giant, Walmart.Sam Walton, Walmart's famous founder, was worth more than $8.6 billion when he died in 1992, but like many American tycoons, he started off small. After graduating from college, he worked for 18 months with J.C. Penney to become familiar with the retail industry, and in his early years in the business he franchised a number of Ben Franklin general stores. In 1962, Walton opened his first retail location that bore his name. It wasn't in the cavernous warehouse-type building where Walmart super centers are housed today. Instead, Walton's first five-and-dime was a modestly-sized general store on the town square in Bentonville, Arkansas with a 1950s-style red and white facade and awning that has been retained to this day. Today the building houses the Walmart Museum, where Walmart souvenirs are for sale, and elaborate displays recounting the history of the company are housed for visitors' perusal. One artifact on display at the museum is the official Walmart articles of incorporation, the paperwork which legally records the creation of a business — in this case, a pretty historic one.Watch this video Before Stepping Foot Inside Walmart Again!#Walmart #BigBoxStoresFive and dime | 0:00Where it failed | 1:25Different names for the same thing | 2:44Best-selling bananas | 3:46Walmart and weight | 4:25Walmart: Beyond Thunderdome | 5:55Upward trajectory | 7:24The world's biggest boss | 8:09Global income | 8:50Renewable energy | 9:50Charitable donations | 11:03Read full article: https://www.mashed.com/209167/the-unt...",PT12M35S,2020-06-01,2020-06-01,142566,Mashed,/channel/UCGvIBxqin_rx3sY9qacQEhQ,UCGvIBxqin_rx3sY9qacQEhQ,20,urDg8_MGveQ

Why China Will Not Become the Dominant Power in Asia,Education,815847,"5,869","1,527","Public Lecture by Emeritus Professor Paul Dibb and Adjunct Associate Professor John Lee.The belief that China will soon become the dominant power in Asia is based on assumptions that its continued and rapid economic rise, and its emergence as a regional peer of America’s in military terms is all but assured. Such a belief underpins arguments that a fundamental strategic reorganisation of Asia is inevitable, and that it will be necessary and perhaps even desirable to concede to China significant ‘strategic space’. Dependent largely on linear extrapolations about the future, such arguments ignore the implications of China’s economic, social and national fragilities, its lack of major friends or allies in the region as well as the considerable military deficiencies and challenges faced by the People’s Liberation Army. With the Defence White Paper due for release in 2015, the government should bear in mind that planning for an era of Chinese dominance in the region—or even its emergence as an American strategic peer in Asia—would be premature if not improbable. Australia should not design its defence force for war with China, but it should be able to counter Chinese coercion and contribute to Allied military operations if necessary.Paul Dibb is Emeritus Professor of Strategic Studies in the Strategic & Defence Studies Centre, Coral Bell schol of Asia-Pacific Affairs, ANU. He was head of the Strategic and Defence Studies Centre from 1991 to 2004. Before that he held the positions of deputy secretary for Defence, director of the Joint Intelligence Organisation and head of the National Assessments Staff. He studied the former Soviet Union for over 20 years both as a senior intelligence officer and academic. He advised ASIO on certain Soviet activities. His book The Soviet Union--the Incomplete Superpower was published by the International Institute for Strategic Studies , London in 1986, reprinted 1987 and second edition 1988.John Lee is an Australian academic working on international economic and security affairs with a focus on the Asia-Pacific. Lee is an adjunct associate professor at the Australian National University's Strategic and Defence Studies Centre, a Michael Hintze Fellow at the Centre for International Security Studies, University of Sydney and a senior scholar at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC. Lee is a board member of the Institute for Regional Security.",PT71M20S,2015-03-26,2015-03-26,121552,ANU TV,/channel/UCxzvNYT-17mjYJMuDzGx7AA,UCxzvNYT-17mjYJMuDzGx7AA,20,_AvNT3vyzr0

Richard Dawkins & Lawrence Krauss: Something from Nothing,Education,425378,"4,966",362,"Critically-acclaimed author and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and world-renowned theoretical physicist and author Lawrence Krauss  discuss biology, cosmology, religion, and a host of other topics at this event entitled 'Something for Nothing'. This video was recorded at The Australian National University on 10 April 2012.Richard Dawkins FRS is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at the University of Oxford. Born in British colonial Africa, he was educated in England, where he now lives. He did his doctorate at Oxford under the Nobel Prize winning zoologist Niko Tinbergen, then was briefly an Assistant Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, from 1967 to 1969, after which he returned to Oxford, first as a Lecturer in Zoology, then Reader, before being elected to his present professorship.He is the author of nine books: The Selfish Gene (1976, 2nd Ed 1989), The Extended Phenotype (1982), The Blind Watchmaker (1986), River Out of Eden (1995), Climbing Mount Improbable (1996), Unweaving the Rainbow (1998), A Devil's Chaplain (2003), The Ancestor's Tale (2004) and The God Delusion (2006). The God Delusion has sold more than two million copies in English, and is being published in 30 other languages. Dawkins is now editing an anthology of scientific writing for Oxford University Press, The Oxford Book of Modern Science Writing. In 2006, to promote the values of education, science, and critical thinking skills, he established The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science (RDFRS) which is now a registered charity in both the UK and USA.Richard Dawkins has Honorary Doctorates of Literature as well as Science, and is a Fellow of both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Literature. He has been awarded the Silver Medal of the Zoological Society of London, the Michael Faraday Award of the Royal Society, the Nakayama Prize, the Cosmos International Prize, the Kistler Prize, the Shakespeare Prize and the Lewis Thomas Prize.Lawrence M. Krauss is a renowned cosmologist and science populariser, and is Foundation Professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration, and director of the Origins Project at Arizona State University. Hailed by Scientific American as a rare public intellectual, he is also the author of more than three hundred scientific publications and nine books, including the international bestseller, The Physics of Star Trek, and his most recent bestseller entitled A Universe from Nothing.He received his PhD from MIT in 1982 and then joined the Society of Fellows at Harvard, and was a professor at Yale University and Chair of the Physics Department at Case Western Reserve University before taking his present position. Internationally known for his work in theoretical physics, he is the winner of numerous international awards, and is the only physicist to have received major awards from all three US physics societies, the American Physical Society, the American Institute of Physics, and the American Association of Physics Teachers. Krauss is also a commentator and essayist for newspapers such as the New York Times, and the Wall St. Journal, and has written regular columns for New Scientist and Scientific American and appears regularly on radio and television. He is one of the few scientists to have crossed the chasm between science and popular culture, and is also active in issues of science and society. He serves as co-chair of the Board of Sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, and on the Board of Directors of the Federation of American Scientists.",PT92M17S,2012-04-18,2012-04-18,112236,ANU TV,/channel/UCxzvNYT-17mjYJMuDzGx7AA,UCxzvNYT-17mjYJMuDzGx7AA,1,q0mljE9K-gY
Hürtgen forest and the end of World War II | Free Full DW Documentary,Education,1462527,"13,658",709,"Thousands of soldiers were killed in the last battles of World War II. US troops who fought in the Hürtgen Forest nicknamed it the ""Death Factory."" This documentary features original film from US archives that bring the battle back to life.It's estimated that as many as 30 thousand US and German soldiers were killed in fighting in the northern Eifel region of Germany in the autumn and winter of 1944 and 1945. Traces of the battle - old bunkers, munitions, trenches and tank tracks - are still visible even today. The scarred landscape bears witness to a little-known chapter of World War Two. The ""Hürtgen Forest"" was the last obstacle standing between US forces and the Rhine River and Ruhr. Yet the decision to advance into the thick forest in September 1944 proved to be a fatal mistake. The Americans completely miscalculated North Eifel region's rugged terrain. They became disoriented in an area the German forces, the Wehrmacht, had crisscrossed with trenches and peppered with anti-personnel mines, making the wood into a veritable fortress. Continual rain and fog, followed by snow and frigid temperatures, turned the battle into a scene of dystopian butchery. Author Ernest Hemingway spent 18 days on the front in the Hürtgen Forest. He wrote later, ""It was a place where it was extremely difficult for a man to stay alive even if all he did was be there."" This documentary reconstructs the stages of the battle using commentary from survivors of the clash. Among them are the well-known US photographer Tony Vaccaro, US Army veteran James K. Cullen and former Wehrmacht soldier Paul Verbeek. In addition, Hürtgen Forest residents tell of the legacy of the battle, including the threat posed by countless unexploded munitions left in the ground 75 years after the conflict in Europe ended.",PT42M27S,2020-05-02,2020-05-02,147243,DW Documentary,/channel/UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,UCW39zufHfsuGgpLviKh297Q,20,tT0ob3cHPmE

Andrew was the hardest criminal around yet integrating back into society was his hardest journey of all.Imagine a world where all youth and community groups were self-sustainable – independent of government funding, grants, and resources. That’s the founding vision upon which Andrew Gason has built not-for-profit organisation New Civilization Builders Inc.Andrew’s divergent youth gave him the tools to fruitfully engage with young people on all levels. As a Samoan raised in South Auckland New Zealand, he spent half his life living in the criminal underworld being involved in every crime from burglary to weapon smuggling. The conclusion was prison. In 1998 Andrew was released from jail and started to search for a new direction in life.

A Reagan Forum with Rich Little — 3/6/2017,Education,150160,"1,303",75,"Please join us for an evening with comedian, actor, artist and entertainment legend Rich Little, who will be here to discuss his new book, Little by Little: People I’ve Known and Been (Publish Date: August 8, 2016), as well as to share stories of his time spent with President Reagan. Tickets to the event are $56 per person and include a buffet dinner in the Air Force One Pavilion following the program. Books must be purchased in the Reagan Library Museum Store to receive signature.Rich Little is a master mimic of more than 200 voices and currently has a Las Vegas Show at the Tropicana Hotel. Rich Little has a voice for every administration including U.S. Presidents: John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, both George Bushes and Barack Obama. Infamous for his skewering of political figures, Little has charmed, amused, intrigued and gotten the best of politicians from here to his native Canada. He entertained at both of Ronald Reagan’s presidential inaugurations and got to know the Reagans very well during that time. President Reagan used to tell Little, “You do me better than I do.”In Little by Little, Rich Little shares his story of how he grew up to become an impersonator. In this gem of a book are insights into the likes of many of the great people he had the privilege and fortune to meet and imitate, shining new light on our beloved stars, including a chapter on Ronald Reagan. This is really not a biography, but more of a humorous glimpse of the people he’s impersonated and some of the funny stories that happened along the way.For more information on the ongoing works of President Reagan's Foundation, please visit http://www.reaganfoundation.orgFor more information on donations, visit https://support.google.com/youtube/?p...",PT64M31S,2017-03-06,2017-03-06,165217,ReaganFoundation,/channel/UCEJi23qnygQHE5UeLXoV_JQ,UCEJi23qnygQHE5UeLXoV_JQ,20,qkFlVnHVHzI

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.

She provides insights on having forty-five half-siblings across the country. She wishes to share with the TEDx audience what it’s like to have such an interesting family dynamic and how they can help make others feel comfortable, regardless of theirs.-- Fran lives in Wilmington, Delaware, and is a freshman at Ursuline Academy. She participates in Mental Health Advocacy and Spectrum at school; Queer Teens of Delaware outside of school; and regularly volunteers at Woodlawn Library and Faithful Friends Animal Shelter in her free time. At the age of ten, she learned that she was conceived with a sperm donor. Constantly interested by her “unknown” family, she began talking to some of her forty-five half-brothers and half-sisters as well as her biological father at the age of twelve. Fran has made close connections with many of her cryo-siblings since. She’s eager to share with TEDx fans and her Ursuline family her journey of learning about her conception and siblings and how it affected her personal life. She wants nontraditional families like hers to be normalized in today’s society. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

It happened gradually. He’s a comedian who has been so consistently hilarious, so consistently impassioned about his jokes, and so consistently on edge that after two decades, hardly anybody can remember a time when they didn’t know Bill Burr.But that’s not to say that he’s never the subject of widespread media interest. In 2006, Bill Burr walked onto a stage in Philadelphia in front of an audience that had booed and jeered every comedian who had come up before him, and they treated him the same. That became his shining moment. Bill Burr unleashed a torrent of witty rage that was so glorious that even the angry, rowdy crowd set aside their own inane contempt to laugh in praise of the miracle that they had just witnessed. That moment was special because it defined Bill Burr.Since then, Burr has been busy as ever. He’s produced a popular podcast (the Monday Morning Podcast), appeared in numerous movies and TV shows, and released four albums and comedy specials.Enjoy!👉 Subscribe here: http://bit.ly/2phCdSU🕊️ Follow me on Twitter: http://bit.ly/2Wqea0k📽️ See my channel and my over videos here: http://bit.ly/32U6gie",PT160M51S,2020-06-06,2020-06-06,132434,PanDaddyPowa,/channel/UCMTFtRCrHBJyuu4d4nXR01Q,UCMTFtRCrHBJyuu4d4nXR01Q,19,5Q4ZygJ8Ncg

Jo Frost, Britain’s best known parenting expert, returns with a new series providing mums and dads with the honest, insightful, no-nonsense advice they need.Jo talks to Britain’s parents to find out which issues are really worrying them, whether it’s how many hours their children play computer games or how much exercise they’re getting. In each show she sets out to answer these most pressing of parental questions with a large-scale demonstration involving kids and parents, aiming to debunk myths and reveal crucial facts such as how much children should eat, how many hours of sleep they really need; and the truth about just how young girls are when they start to obsess about their bodies.In each programme Jo also meets two families suffering from severe versions of the kinds of problems everyone worries about, from a seven-year-old boy who only eats bread and butter to a ten year old so addicted to computer games he spends up to 80 hours a week at the screen.Real Families is the new home for captivating and interesting documentaries and shows about all things parenting.

The director of the Bangladesh Central Bank got off the elevator on the ninth floor, and headed to the back office of the Accounts and Budgeting Department - this was the most restricted part of the building. He was there to deal with a problem; one that had been plaguing the office the last few days. You see… the printer wasn’t working; this was kind of a big deal. It was causing a real disruption. The automated printer (which was hooked up to the bank’s software) was supposed to work round the clock, 24/7, printing out the bank’s transaction reports in real-time; due to this technical glitch however, the printer tray remained empty. Much of the day was spent trying to fix the issue; and after a great deal of effort, there was success - they were able to restart the printer. And so the backlog of transaction reports started rolling out, one by one. Now, it soon became apparent that something wasn’t quite right. There were more statements than expected....The video covers:- Bangladesh Bank- SWIFT security system- World banking- Fraudulent transactions- Dhaka- Billion dollar heist- Cyber-heist / cyber-attack- RCBC Bank in Philippines- Malware hacking- Federal Reserve Bank of New York (New York Fed)- Electronic money transfers- Pan Asia Bank in Sri Lanka- Deutsche Bank- Money laundering in casinos- Single biggest heist in history- Cyber security experts- Lazarus- Sony Pictures Hack 2014- Kim Jong-un in The Interview- North Korea's state funded bank robbing- Macau's & Pyongyang's financial relationship",PT14M44S,2018-08-06,2018-08-06,147267,Kento Bento,/channel/UCLOwKVD0bYHxaDZxXkK4piw,UCLOwKVD0bYHxaDZxXkK4piw,20,Usu9z0feHug

Napoleonic Wars: from Trafalgar to Friedland - Season 1 FULL,Education,764223,"10,794",238,"Napoleon, upon ascending to First Consul of France in 1799, had inherited a chaotic republic; he subsequently created a state with stable finances, a strong bureaucracy, and a well-trained army. In 1805, Austria and Russia waged war against France. In response, Napoleon defeated the allied Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz in December 1805, which is considered his greatest victory. At sea, the British inflicted a severe defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805 upon the joint Franco-Spanish navy, securing British control of the seas and preventing the invasion of Britain itself. Prussian concerns about increasing French power led to a resumption of war in October 1806. Napoleon quickly defeated the Prussians, and defeated Russia in June 1807, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent.

The story of a German conman | DW Documentary,Education,279741,"1,773",117,"It was one of the biggest white-collar scams in German history. In the 1990s, Manfred Schmider and his company FlowTex took investors for more than two billion euros. Today, the conman himself can’t believe how easy it was to get away with a major fraud.For years, banks and leasing companies paid entrepreneur Manfred Schmider money for machines that didn’t even exist. The more than 3,000 tunnel-drilling machines that were allegedly in use on construction sites around the world existed for the most part only on paper. There were no limits to the imagination of Schmider's criminal mind. And everyone was blinded. Dubbed the ""Sheik of Karlsruhe,"" Schmider lived in the lap of luxury, showering his wife with 50-carat diamonds, collecting holiday villas and flying the ten kilometers to his workplace by helicopter. Could authorities have stopped his scheme earlier if they’d investigated accounts of his fraudulent practices when they were first reported? Manfred Schmider was convicted in 2000 and spent years behind bars. Today he lives on Mallorca.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

2017 Maps of Meaning 01: Context and Background,Education,2867076,"35,557","1,430","In this lecture, I discuss the context within which the theory I am delineating through this course emerge: that of the cold war. What is belief? Why is it so important to people? Why will they fight to protect it? I propose that belief unites a culture's expectations and desires with the actions of its people, and that the match between those two allows for cooperative action and maintains emotional stability. I suggest, further, that culture has a deep narrative structure, presenting the world as a forum for action, with characters representing the individual, the known, and the unknown -- or the individual, culture and nature -- or the individual, order and chaos. --- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---Direct Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donateMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbp...--- BOOKS ---12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-...Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-m...--- LINKS ---Website: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/Blog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/Podcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/Reading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/Twitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpetersonInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.pe...Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpete...--- PRODUCTS ---Personality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/perso...Self Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/Understand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/Merchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbp...",PT151M27S,2017-01-16,2017-01-16,162357,Jordan B Peterson,/channel/UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q,20,I8Xc2_FtpHI

North Korea threatens to remilitarize DMZ | DW News,News & Politics,135094,"1,696",87,"Relations between North and South Korea remain tense a day after Pyongyang threatened to restart military exercises in the demilitarized zone bordering South Korea. Citing the army, state media reported that troops would be sent to the industrial park in the border town of Kaesong and to the Kumgang Mountains on the east coast. Guard posts in the demilitarized buffer zone between the two countries will be reestablished, it added. Tensions on the Korean peninsula hit a new low Tuesday when Pyongyang blew up its joint liaison office with Seoul. Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, called out the South for making a ""tactless and sinister proposal"" in its offer to send an envoy, according to a statement reported by North Korean news agency KCNA. Up until a year ago, the two had been making steps towards a more peaceful co-existence - there's little sign of any of that now.Subscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutsche...For more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/Follow DW on social media:►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewell...►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dw_stories/Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/channel/deuts...#NorthKorea #DMZ #KimJongUn",PT13M9S,2020-06-18,2020-06-18,126616,DW News,/channel/UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg,UCknLrEdhRCp1aegoMqRaCZg,20,h6yffWN3w2E

Mathematical Challenges to Darwin’s Theory of Evolution,News & Politics,1489809,"29,012","3,747","Recorded on June 6, 2019 in Italy.To comment please go tohttps://www.hoover.org/research/mathe...Based on new evidence and knowledge that functioning proteins are extremely rare, should Darwin’s theory of evolution be dismissed, dissected, developed or replaced with a theory of intelligent design?Has Darwinism really failed? Peter Robinson discusses it with David Berlinski, David Gelernter, and Stephen Meyer, who have raised doubts about Darwin’s theory in their two books and essay, respectively The Deniable Darwin, Darwin’s Doubt, and “Giving Up Darwin” (published in the Claremont Review of Books).Robinson asks them to convince him that the term “species” has not been defined by the authors to Darwin’s disadvantage. Gelernter replies to this and explains, as he expressed in his essay, that he sees Darwin’s theory as beautiful (which made it difficult for him to give it up): “Beauty is often a telltale sign of truth. Beauty is our guide to the intellectual universe—walking beside us through the uncharted wilderness, pointing us in the right direction, keeping us on track—most of the time.” Gelernter notes that there’s no reason to doubt that Darwin successfully explained the small adjustments by which an organism adapts to local circumstances: changes to fur density or wing style or beak shape. Yet there are many reasons to doubt whether Darwin can answer the hard questions and explain the big picture—not the fine-tuning of existing species but the emergence of new ones. Meyer explains Darwinism as a comprehensive synthesis, which gained popularity for its appeal. Meyer also mentions that one cannot disregard that Darwin’s book was based on the facts present in the 19th century.For further information: https://www.hoover.org/publications/u...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Joining our live debate will be Labour MP David Lammy, who described the Windrush controversy as a ""day of national shame"", and leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg.

It should never have happened, said the Home Secretary, as she finally promised to fix it. But why did she suddenly change her mind after months and years of ignoring the outrage? And is Windrush a unique mistake - caused by officials? Or was it the policy? The political atmosphere - a toxic, racist undercurrent driven by public alarm about immigration?

Lessons From A Cult Survivor | Claire Ashman | TEDxUQ,Nonprofits & Activism,367178,"4,327",118,"Claire Ashman was born, raised, and birthed 9 children in a cult. She shares how the prevalence of cults and cult-like thinking affects everyday people. In Australia there are over 3000 cults, with some 600,000 members, meaning we all know, or have had contact with at least one person who is a member of a cult. Cults and secretive groups fill certain voids that all people feel at some point in their lives. Everyone has had a time in their lives when they've felt vulnerable or directionless. For some people, it's easier to have someone give you the answer than living through the pain. Ashman shares awakening for cult-member’s friends, colleagues and family members to recognize the signs and be present to support upon exiting a cult. Ashman is now happily married, of her own free will, to a supportive raising their 10 kids together. By day she motivates women to take control of their own lives, by night she drives people to free thinking in her Uber.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

We've all found ourselves in conversation and felt attacked like we started off talking about one thing and then the other person twisted our words and before we knew it, we lost our cool, lost respect in their eyes, and maybe even acted like a jerk. Now, I don't normally do the same person twice in a row but this interview between Cathy Newman and Jordan Peterson was just too interesting of an opportunity to discuss how you can handle someone who uses subtle conversational tricks to bully you into looking dumb. So in this video, you're gonna see firsthand some of the most common tricks that people might be using on you and you're also gonna learn how to reverse those so that you can walk out of a kind of aggressive situation having earned more respect than you had going in. So first off, to stop a conversational bully, you have to realize what's going on before it's too late. Now, typically, a person will reveal their aggressive attitude early on with their tone of voice and their word choice. Check out the rest that we will show in this video and how Jordan Peterson tackles them.1:49 Jordan Peterson deals with so-you're-saying trap2:39 Jordan Peterson deals with the ""assuming the sale""5:30 Jordan Peterson deals with the smash technique7:08 But don't straw man the other person's ideas though7:47 And visual imagery can also help8:25 You can show them that they're already agreeing with youConnect With Us Further:Website: http://www.charismaoncommand.comFacebook: http://facebook.com/charismaoncommandInstagram: @CharismaOnCommandOr if you want to see our personal stuff (regular life + playing music):Instagram: @CharlieHoupertInstagram: @IamBenAltman",PT11M45S,2018-01-22,2018-01-22,161534,Charisma on Command,/channel/UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,20,nS9W-wlJHPA

And there are few worse feelings than love gone wrong. When it happens it can be bizarre, and at times incredibly cruel. Former couple, rugby league star Josh Reynolds and Instagram lingerie model Arabella Del Busso, can certainly attest to that. As is often the way with modern romances, their attraction to each other was as instant as it was passionate. But their relationship ended as a very public police matter. Then the story got even stranger. Claims of fake pregnancies, fake cancers, fake funerals and domestic violence caused more scandalous headlines. Many people assumed Josh was just another footballer behaving badly until it emerged that Arabella was not necessarily the victim she said she was. In a special edition of 60 MINUTES, Tom Steinfort speaks to the warring parties as he explains this twisted tale of doomed romance.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

Black murder is normal | Michael Smith | TEDxJacksonville,Nonprofits & Activism,771845,"30,058","2,027","This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. In this Talk, Pastor Michael T. Smith argues that the “normalcy” of black murder is engrained in our American culture. Indeed, the idea that a black American would be involved in a homicide—either as perpetrator or victim—is so broadly accepted as to be largely unnoticed.Smith exposes the racism that underlies the appalling lack of outrage at high death rates in the black community, and highlights the hypocrisy of a society that glamorizes violence, but ignores its victims. “It doesn’t take action to keep racism going,” Smith observes, “it takes inaction.”About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",PT19M29S,2015-01-06,2015-01-06,17517,TEDx Talks,/channel/UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,UCsT0YIqwnpJCM-mx7-gSA4Q,20,1DxHL2i3cZo

Thomas Sowell on the Myths of Economic Inequality,News & Politics,2012080,"44,463","1,475","Recorded on November 15, 2018Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a master’s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.Sowell’s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowell’s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Generally, people try to shut them down with insults and aggression, and some others prefer to walk away from these interactions to avoid that kind of negativity. But there is a third, potentially more effective way to deal with these toxic people. Russell Brand, for instance, tries to take control of the conversation instead of shutting it down. This allows him to stand up for himself without coming across like a jerk. His interview with three hosts at the MSNBC morning show is a perfect example of the main strategies that you can use to dominate any bully in any conversation.⏰TIMESTAMPS⏰ 0:55 - Practice #1: Continue speaking until the end of your sentence.1:55 - Practice #2: Treat each member of a group as an individual.2:51 - Practice #3: Emphasize similarities with other members.10:01 - Practice #4: Learn to detach your ego from personal attacks.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------#RussellBrand #CharismaOnCommand--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Connect With Us Further:Website: http://www.charismaoncommand.comFacebook: http://facebook.com/charismaoncommandInstagram: @CharismaOnCommandOr if you want to see our personal stuff (regular life + playing music):Instagram: @CharlieHoupertInstagram: @IamBenAltman",PT14M2S,2019-06-17,2019-06-17,163442,Charisma on Command,/channel/UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,20,K9Na6CmJwn4

"1177 BC: The Year Civilization Collapsed (Eric Cline, PhD)",Science & Technology,4540560,"53,658","2,911","From about 1500 BC to 1200 BC, the Mediterranean region played host to a complex cosmopolitan and globalized world-system. It may have been this very internationalism that contributed to the apocalyptic disaster that ended the Bronze Age. When the end came, the civilized and international world of the Mediterranean regions came to a dramatic halt in a vast area stretching from Greece and Italy in the west to Egypt, Canaan, and Mesopotamia in the east. Large empires and small kingdoms collapsed rapidly. With their end came the world’s first recorded Dark Ages. It was not until centuries later that a new cultural renaissance emerged in Greece and the other affected areas, setting the stage for the evolution of Western society as we know it today.  Professor Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University will explore why the Bronze Age came to an end and whether the collapse of those ancient civilizations might hold some warnings for our current society.Considered for a Pulitzer Prize for his recent book 1177 BC, Dr. Eric H. Cline is Professor of Classics and Anthropology and the current Director of the Capitol Archaeological Institute at The George Washington University. He is a National Geographic Explorer, a Fulbright scholar, an NEH Public Scholar, and an award-winning teacher and author. He has degrees in archaeology and ancient history from Dartmouth, Yale, and the University of Pennsylvania; in May 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree (honoris causa) from Muhlenberg College.  Dr. Cline is an active field archaeologist with 30 seasons of excavation and survey experience.The views expressed in this video are those of the speaker and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Capital Area Skeptics.",PT70M18S,2016-10-11,2016-10-11,126544,NCASVideo,/channel/UCV62FVLw6MxUvO8XmnhE4Yw,UCV62FVLw6MxUvO8XmnhE4Yw,20,bRcu-ysocX4

A pupil of Solomon Mikowsky (Manhattan School of Music) and notably Rosalyn Tureck Yuan Sheng extensively studied the performance practice of Baroque music. Equally at home at the harpsichord he has an instinctive feeling for the possibilities, sonorities and touch of the instrument at hand, so that “the listener might easily have imagined the composer at the keyboard” (Boston Intelligencer). This recent recording of the complete 6 Partitas is again a marvel of elegance, wit, rhetoric and brilliance, played on a modern Steinway. Besides pursuing an international career Yuan Sheng is Professor of Piano at the Bejing Central Conservatory of Music.00:00:00 Partita No. 1 in B-Flat Major, BWV 825: I.

The F&I Manager, finance man, loan officer, business manager, or whatever the car dealer wants to call him or her... just remember this is the most skilled salesperson the dealership employs. They make more money than any other person in the dealership for a very good reason. They are sharks, and they are NOT looking out for you. They are looking out for themselves and the interests of their dealership. When they ""shop"" your car deal to many different banks, they are looking for the bank that allows them to pack the most product into your car deal. When you start seeing bank names like Santander, Capital One, Chase, Wells Fargo, Space Coast Credit Union, Regional Acceptance Corporation, Ally... just to name a few, you know you're sitting in a car dealers finance office. Kevin Hunter covers everything from extended warranties, GAP insurance, theft protection... otherwise known as window etching, paint sealers, carpet and fabric protection. All the details on HOW TO BUY A CAR, TRUCK, or SUV.This video was published to help you discover how you can save time and money on your next new or used car purchase by doing your homework first, and then going car shopping as an informed buyer.  We are more than amused by a few of the car salespeople or car dealers who contact us and state that we are making a 'small problem' sound far worse than it is. We know there are honest people in the car business, and we receive positive comments from many of them, but it's definitely a buyer beware world out on the car lot! For all of you car buyers who are well steeped in reality, if you watched the video ""Confessions of a car dealers backroom"" you understand why you need to see this video. By understanding what mistakes to avoid, you'll not only become a smarter car buyer, but you'll also better understand what not to tell a car dealer when buying a car. It's true that you can play all your cards up front with an honest dealer, but unfortunately, they represent the minority of dealer owners (truly transparent and honest dealers make up about 40% of all dealers), and you are unlikely to know the difference until it's far too late. Be smart, do your homework, and you'll come home with a car deal that's good for you and the dealer. After all, that's what fairness is all about. We encourage you to be fair and honest. As a car shopper, live up to your end of the bargain, because it works both ways. Need to fix your car? Check out Chris Fix or Scotty Kilmer! I also watch the Dave Ramsey Show!

"Bret Weinstein Testifies to Congress on The Evergreen State College riots, Free Speech & Safe Spaces",Science & Technology,1657716,"44,055",739,"Bret Weinstein's testimony to the House of Representatives about the free speech crisis on U.S. college campuses. The testimony delivered by Dr. Weinstein to the members of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform explained that the crisis isn't primarily about free speech, and won't be limited to college campuses for long.Help support my work on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/bretweinstein/Twitter: @BretWeinstein https://twitter.com/BretWeinsteinExcerpt from Dr. Weinstein's testimony:Oppression Disguised as EquityTestimony of Bret S. WeinsteinUnited States House of RepresentativesMay 22, 2018Tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the day that 50 Evergreen students--students that I had never met--disrupted my class, accusing me of racism and demanding my resignation. I tried to reason with them. I felt no fear because I knew that, whatever my failings might be, bigotry was not among them.At that moment. I felt sure I could reach these students. I also felt a moral obligation to try. Racism, which squanders human potential, and erodes human dignity, offends me. I am also well versed in the evolutionary logic that makes racism durable. I should have had no trouble establishing common ground.Their response surprised me, and it would take months for me to fully understand what had happened. The protestors had no apparent interest in the very dialog they seemed to invite. I was even more surprised by the protestor's fervor in shouting down my actual students--some of whom had known me for years. The cruelty and derision reserved for students of color who spoke in my defense was particularly chilling.If not discussion, what did they want? I was one of Evergreen's most popular professors. I had Evergreen's version of tenure. Did they really think they could force my resignation based on a meritless accusation?They did think that. And they were right. What I had not counted on was their alliance with Evergreen's new president.Though the protestors openly humiliated him, the president of the college partnered with the mob in private, handing them concession after concession. We know this because the rioters filmed everything and proudly uploaded it. In one particularly telling video, President Bridges calmly discusses with the leaders of the protest a demand to target STEM faculty based on the empty assertion that scientists are particularly prone to bias. In that same video the president speaks of his plan for those who resist the new order: ""Bring 'em in. Train 'em. And if they don't get it, sanction 'em."" He invites his partners to hold him to it.On the second day of unrest, the police chief called me. Rioters were stopping traffic and searching for someone, car to car. The chief believed it was me. She was worried for my safety and helpless to protect me as the president had ordered her force to ""stand down."" What would have transpired if the rioters had found me? I still don't know, and I strongly suspect they don't either. The protest at my class did not emerge out of the blue in May, 2017. One year earlier I stood up and spoke in opposition to a dangerous proposal, one that threatened to establish a racial hierarchy amongst faculty.To those who have not faced something similar, this likely sounds hyperbolic. But one can now advance such policies, and almost certainly succeed in passing them, if they are properly draped in weaponized terminology. ""Equity"", for example, has taken on special properties. If a person opposes an ""equity"" proposal, those advancing the proposal are secure in asserting that their opponent is motivated by opposition to racial equity itself: In other words, that they are racist.My opposition to that first ""equity"" proposal was voiced to my colleagues, with no students present. Demands for my resignation one year later, were not the result of organic student confusion. They were payback for violating a de facto code of faculty conduct in which one's right to speak is now dictated by adherence to an ascendant orthodoxy in which one's race, gender and sexual orientation are paramount. The students were on a mission. They were unwitting tools of a witting movement. This committee should take my tale as cautionary. Is there a free speech crisis on college campuses? One can certainly make that argument, but that portrayal is at least as misleading as it is informative. What is occurring on college campuses is about power and control--speech is impeded as a last resort, used when people fail to self-censor in response to a threat of crippling stigma and the destruction of their capacity to earn.Full Hearing:https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/c...",PT15M2S,2018-06-08,2018-06-08,132474,Bret Weinstein,/channel/UCi5N_uAqApEUIlg32QzkPlg,UCi5N_uAqApEUIlg32QzkPlg,20,uRIKJCKWla4

Why Tyrion Can't Be Killed,People & Blogs,2883685,"67,819","1,839","Discover The 4 Necessary Emotions To A Killer First Impression:http://bit.ly/2nUgFXJGame of Thrones - Why Tyrion Can't Be KilledTyrion Lannister has a knack for staying alive.  He is constantly getting into trouble and talking his way out.  But Tyrion's genius is replicable if you learn how he thinks.  And one of the first thing he thinks of is what other people want.  That is how he manages to continue through season after season in Game of Thrones.We cover 3 ways to figure out what people want by examining how Tyrion Lannister survives through Game of Thrones:1.  Cold reading - watch how Tyrion cold reads Bronn .  Contrast that with Lommy, who never even attempts to cold read Polliver before he kills him2.  Listening - Tyrion listens very carefully to what people say.  When the pirates take him hostage and mention they will sell his ""manhood"" to the cock merchant, he comes up with a clever reason for them to keep him alive.  Cersei provides a foil to this in how she behaves with Joffrey.3.  Asking people for their stories - Tyrion asks the members of the Night's Watch for their stories, learning about Grenn and Pip.  Jon Snow, on the other hand, just assumes that they hate him because he is better. If you put those 3 things into place you might not win The Game of Thrones, but you can still display some of Tyrion's genius.Subscribe to Charisma On Command: http://bit.ly/subscribeCOCConnect With Us.Website: http://www.charismaoncommand.comFacebook: http://facebook.com/charismaoncommandPeriscope: @CharismaonVideo Editor, Andre: http://www.goandre.comOr if you want to see my personal stuff (my regular life + me playing music):Instagram: @CharlieHoupertPeriscope: @CharlieHoupert",PT11M22S,2016-04-18,2016-04-18,163422,Charisma on Command,/channel/UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,20,qMliNd2b2K0

10 Ways You Can Spot A Liar With Body Language,Education,1590543,"22,784","1,108","10 Body Language Signs That Prove Someone Is LyingSubscribe to our channel: http://goo.gl/9CwQhgFeeling like someone is lying to you is a very unpleasant feeling. Although our instincts may be telling us one thing, how much can we really trust ourselves in these situations? If only we had some ways of knowing for sure if people were being truthful with us. In this video, we’ll show you some ways that you can tell if someone is telling you the truth by simply observing their body language. They say that the eyes are the window to the soul, but it turns out that a lot of what we thought we knew about eye movement and lying is incorrect and outdated, and we have the science to back it up. Instead, you may notice people’s blinking patterns changing dramatically when they lie. Find out what it means when their blinking slows down and when it speeds up. Symptoms of nervousness such as stammering, trailing off, and having trouble speaking are also not good signs. You might be surprised how much fidgeting can tell you about how truthful someone is being. In fact, it’s proven that this can be a more effective true detector than a polygraph test! So while watching someone’s face for clues can be helpful, you’ll also want to take a look at their hands as well. Besides their hands, you may notice their head moving quickly when you ask a question, and you may even notice inconsistencies between their body language and the words that they’re saying. If you spot someone nodding while telling you “no,” there’s a good chance they’re lying to you.

Abigail & Brittany Hensel - The Twins Who Share a Body,People & Blogs,41110798,"171,015","14,664","Although they are two completely separate people, these accomplished teens share a body and have just two arms and legs between them.Born in 1990, the girls have been brought up in a small, tightly knit community in Minnesota, almost completely protected from prying eyes and inquisitive stares. To their friends and family, they are distinct people with very different personalities, needs, tastes and desires. But to the outside world they are a medical mystery -- particularly given the fact that they can do virtually all the same things as their friends, including playing the piano, riding a bike, swimming and playing softball ""Their personalities make them inspirational,"" says their mother Patty. ""They never give up; anything they want to do, they go out and do it.""The medical world is keen to find out how two separate brains and nervous systems can work in such a perfectly co-ordinated way, but the twins and their family have always resisted non-essential medical tests. ""The family want to treat them as though they are just like everyone else,"" says Joy Westerdahl, the girls' doctor, who admits that it is a mystery how their unique physiology functions.As they enter adulthood, the twins are likely to leave the haven of their home town and face the wider world. In preparation for that time, they have taken part in this intimate documentary to show the world what it is like to be joined for life.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_...",PT45M29S,2011-04-23,2011-04-23,141652,Documeaning,/channel/UCBqhy_jiZ76EmSHhqMVnLKA,UCBqhy_jiZ76EmSHhqMVnLKA,1,K57IcN9DWXo

(THE 7 CHOICES)]If you were living in North Korea right now - trying to survive on a diet of rats, grass, soil and tree bark, quenching your thirst by drinking out of mud puddles in the ground - what would you do?There's also the conceivable chance of being sent to a political prison camp for years on end just because you innocently thought out loud one day to a bunch of friends (North Korean propaganda is strong), where you are then beaten, tortured, and left so hungry that you are forced to dig and consume the grains out of faeces, or the maggots from dead bodies just so you have the energy to perhaps last one more day.You'd probably wanna escape. But how?The North Korean government in Pyongyang refuses to let its citizens leave, a clear violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, viewing North Korean defectors as traitorous criminals. Captured North Koreans would be subject to unimaginable torture and often public executions.If they are successful in their escape, then three to four generations of their family back home would be sent to North Korean prison camps to rot ....or worse. This is a strong deterrent.But this still doesn't stop desperate North Koreans from tempting fate. In this video, I'll go over the seven ways to escape the DPRK, including the most dangerous, the most unforgiving, the most unique, and the most unexpected.The North Korean border on the south side (ie. South Korean border / Korean DMZ) is the shortest distance to travel for safety and stability but as a result, the regime makes it dangerously hard. A North Korean escapee can be shot down by North Korean soldiers (border guards) or step on the many landmines in the area.The northern border to China has it's own set of challenges. Most North Korean refugees escape through this way, usually crossing the Tumen River border (like the famous North Korean defector Hyeonseo Lee). Once in China, the nightmare doesn't end there.There are also other, more unconventional ways you can try to escape such as through North Korean labor camps.Even if you make it to safety and resettle in a stable country, the North Korean regime will still try to hunt you down, so you're never truly safe. Especially if you're an outspoken critic or a threat to Kim Jong-un's power - just ask his half brother, Kim Jong-nam.Sources:https://web.archive.org/web/200703032...http://bushcenter.imgix.net/legacy/gw...https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/wo...http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/world...http://time.com/4205785/london-new-ma...",PT15M58S,2017-03-15,2017-03-15,147264,Kento Bento,/channel/UCLOwKVD0bYHxaDZxXkK4piw,UCLOwKVD0bYHxaDZxXkK4piw,20,6A0ZOkMDLw0

Hacked: The Bangladesh Bank Heist | 101 East,Entertainment,1181747,"9,009",524,"It was a daring raid. Tens of millions of dollars stolen from Bangladesh's central bank via the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, transferred to accounts in the Philippines and then laundered through the Philippine casino system.The money, and the thieves, then vanished. And it was all done online. In this comprehensive investigation spanning several countries, 101 East examines one of the biggest bank robberies in modern times, to find out how cyber-hackers infiltrated the global banking system, and got away with it.The crime stunned the then-governor of Bangladesh Bank, Atiur Rahman. ""It was like a terrorist attack, into the central bank,"" he says. ""I couldn't believe it ... because nothing like that ... ever happened.""The robbery prompted investigations in the Philippines, Bangladesh and by the FBI. It revealed weaknesses in the supposedly secure global money transfer system known as SWIFT, which banks use to move billions of dollars daily between themselves.The heist also exposed the murky banking system of the Philippines, where some of the world's toughest bank secrecy laws make the country vulnerable to potential corruption and money laundering. And it drew attention to the country's casinos, which are exempt from anti-money laundering laws, and not required to report suspicious transactions.101 East exposes how cyber-hackers got away with one of the biggest bank thefts in history, robbing Bangladesh's central bank of more than $80m.- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/#AlJazeeraEnglish #101East #BangladeshBank",PT26M1S,2018-05-24,2018-05-24,142373,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,6Y9UaLKbZQ0

He died the next day. The New South Wales Coroner tried to find out the circumstances of Darcy’s death but was frustrated by Taylor’s evasiveness. The Coroner said he was an unimpressive witness who probably had more of a story to tell. For Darcy’s grief-stricken family who are still desperate for answers, Adam Taylor’s reluctance to provide more information means they may never find out what really happened to their little boy.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

The world’s most polluted river |  DW Documentary,Education,1346443,"14,394",367,"The Citarum River in Indonesia is the world’s most polluted river. One of the main polluters is the fashion industry: 500 textile factories throw their wastewater directly into the river.The filmmakers teamed up with international scientists to investigate the causes and consequences of this pollution. With the help of concerned citizens, the ‘Green Warriors’ team analyzed water samples, rice, children’s hair, etc. and discovered that toxic chemicals are endangering the lives of the 14 million Indonesians who use the Citarum water. What was once considered paradise is now a brown sludge of human waste and dangerous substances like nonylphenol, antimony and tributylphosphate. These findings prompted the Indonesian government to change its wastewater regulations. Recently, President Joko Widodo announced a new plan to clean up the Citarum. The fashion brands questioned in this documentary promised to better monitor their Indonesian suppliers.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

She calls the phenomenon known as colorism – discrimination against those with a darker skin tone -- “both as sinister and as subtle as racism.” In a world where light skin, light eyes and long “real” hair are sought after features, Okoro tells us how she copes, and what we can do to unlearn this deep rooted, destructive mindset.Chika Okoro is a second year MBA student at Stanford. Passionate about race and gender equality, she is excited to raise awareness about the many issues that women of color face around the world. She hopes that her talk will start a conversation about important issues that people are less vocal about today. While at Stanford Chika is an Arbuckle Leadership Fellow providing leadership coaching and training to MBA 1st year students. Before coming to Stanford she worked at Procter & Gamble as an assistant brand manager and spent last summer at Google as a product-marketing manager. Chika holds a bachelor's degree from Harvard University where she wrote her honors thesis on race and identity in the black community.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

The first instalment focuses on Britain under Roman rule, revealing a much greater degree of collaboration with the natives than was previously recognised.Sheep-farming archaeologist, Francis Pryor, presents a historical series which explores Britain A.D, the British national character and the ultimate British icon King Arthur.Finding new and previously unexplained evidence, Francis Pryor overturns the idea that Britain reverted to a state of anarchy and disorder after the Romans left in 410 AD. Instead of doom and gloom Francis discovers a continuous culture that assimilated influences from as far a field as the Middle East and Constantinople. Through scrutinising the myth of King Arthur to find out what was really going on when the Romans left, Francis is confronted by evidence that confounds traditional views of the 'Dark Ages'. There was also no invasion of bloodthirsty Anglo Saxons, rampaging across the countryside. With new archaeological evidence Francis discovers a far more interesting story.Use code 'timeline' and enjoy 3 months of History Hit for $3 http://bit.ly/TimelineWatchMoreContent licensed from Digital Rights Group (DRG).Produced by Diverse Productions.Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com",PT48M53S,2017-05-08,2017-05-08,147462,Timeline - World History Documentaries,/channel/UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg,UC88lvyJe7aHZmcvzvubDFRg,20,tK5WrCseFYI

Trump posts manipulated video to Twitter and Facebook,News & Politics,857661,"12,580","1,713","Facebook  removed a video posted by President Donald Trump's account that had twisted a viral video of two toddlers after one of the children's parents lodged a copyright claim. The video had more than 4 million views by the time Facebook took it down.The now-removed clip is a crude and misleading edit of a video that went viral last year which shows a Black child and a White child running to hug each other. The version posted to Trump's account made it first appear as if the Black child was running away from the White child.Jukin Media, a company that represents creators of videos including the parent who owns this video, said in a statement provided to CNN Business Friday afternoon, ""Neither the video owner nor Jukin Media gave the President permission to post the video, and after our review, we believe that his unauthorized usage of the content is a clear example of copyright infringement without valid fair use or other defense.""Jukin said in its statement that it had submitted a takedown request to Twitter (TWTR). As of Friday afternoon, the video remained on Twitter, which had no comment. Jukin did not confirm it had sent the takedown request to Facebook, but Andy Stone, a Facebook spokesperson, said ""We received a copyright complaint from the rights holder of this video under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and have removed the post.""The video was put on Trump's Facebook account after he tweeted it Thursday night, the eve of Juneteenth, the oldest known holiday honoring the end of slavery in the United States.##CNN #News",PT8M54S,2020-06-19,2020-06-19,122173,CNN,/channel/UCupvZG-5ko_eiXAupbDfxWw,UCupvZG-5ko_eiXAupbDfxWw,20,lcsWCR_xBiw

Bayer and the bees | DW Documentary,Education,136571,"2,690",54,"Insecticides are sometimes necessary in farming. But some substances, like neonicotinoids, kill not only pests but bees as well. Now the Bayer Group, one of the main manufacturers of these pesticides, is coming under pressure.Scientists around the world have found that neonicotinoids are the main cause of mass bee deaths. Research has shown that a number of insecticides should have been banned long ago. For years, the Bayer Group has sought to silence the critics and pressure scientists into not publishing their findings.For more than two decades, experts have been warning of the negative effects of neonicotinoids, with a whole range of studies published on the subject. It would appear that the industry, aided by the authorities, managed to successfully delay any ban on these substances for years. Studies show that neonicotinoids not only kill pests, but also bees and other beneficial insects. Dutch toxicologist Henk Tennekes was among the first to recognize the problem. He believes neonicotinoids are the most toxic insecticides ever produced. He discovered a study carried out by Bayer itself, back in 1991, which found that a particular neonicotinoid had a negative effect on the nervous system of a fly species. These effects were said to be ""irreversible”. Tennekes then confronted the company with his findings. He was taken aback by the response: ""Bayer now claims” he says, ""that the binding of critical receptors in the nervous system by neonicotinoids is reversible. So they’re contradicting the results of their own study.  ... If they had considered what impact this substance has, they would have had to take it off the market."" Scientists in France also analyzed mass bee deaths and likewise identified an insecticide made by Bayer as the culprit. Toxicologist Jean-Marc Bonmatin reveals how the company then sought to prevent the results from being published. Meanwhile, toxicologists in Japan discovered that neonicotinoids also harm other creatures, such as fish and river crabs. There too, Bayer sought to suppress publication.  -------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Journalist Sebastien Le Belzic who works in Beijing has been living in quarantine at home with his family.China is taking drastic measures in a bid to contain the spread of coronavirus. New rules are springing up on a daily basis and the government depends on loyal party members to enforce these measures at grassroots level. Since the early days of China’s communist revolution, neighborhood committee members have helped police the behavior of their neighbors, reporting back any perceived misdemeanors to people at the top. Along with many others in the Chinese capital Beijing Sebastien Le Belzic has been forced to live in quarantine with his family. Social media platforms are one of the few ways to remain in touch with the outside world.  Some brave bloggers are using these channels to share their experiences of the crisis.

Why Tyrion Will Win The Game Of Thrones,Howto & Style,1660427,"36,606","1,274","Discover The 4 Necessary Emotions To A Killer First Impression:http://bit.ly/2EvEGPrWhy Tyrion Will Win The Game Of ThronesGame of Thrones is extremely violent.  Yet despite all the bloodiness, most of the power that you see characters like Tywin Lannister or Daenerys Targaryen wield is not through physical force.  Rather it comes from mini-conflicts of body language, eye contact, and tonality.  Specifically, there is a battle to control the 4 W's.I believe the person to win the Game of Thrones will be the one that best takes control of these 4W's.  And one of the best candidates to win is Tyrion Lannister.  He may never sit the Iron Throne himself, but I believe that given his incredible command of power, he will be by the ruler's side.  Here are the four W's that make Tyrion so special1)  When: In this scene Daenerys completely controls the when as Tyrion and Jorah are there at her leisure.  She also takes command of the silence.2) Who: Tyrion is great at making himself appear more important.  Tywin Lannister is also great at this as he snatches the power from Joffrey, despite the fact that Joffrey Baratheon is king.3)  What: Tyrion does an excellent job of controlling what Dany focuses on4)  Where: Daenerys' power is completely dependant on where she is - when she finds herself in front of Khal Moro in season 6, it's basically at zeroSo those are the four W's that I believe will win to Tyrion winning the Game of Thrones.

The secret world of Sugar Babies and Sugar Daddies | 60 Minutes Australia,Entertainment,2849826,"19,871","4,284","Incredibly, right now in Australia there are more than 200,000 young women who have either become, or are trying to be, “sugar babies”. Their ambition is for a sweet life of pampered luxury, paid for by older, sometimes much older, men. For the so-called “sugar daddies”, the equation is simple: the wealthier they are, the more attractive they are. But as Sarah Abo finds out, it’s not hard to read between the lines here. The term sugar baby is often code for sex worker, and the male moneybags are often crinkled-up creeps. And that leads to a very important question: is this sugar baby phenomenon about empowering women or exploiting them?WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

When I was abandoned I was in the newspapers and all over the news. I was named by airport staff as Gary Gatwick My first birth certificate states I was named as Gary Laker. I was adopted later on and my name changed to Steven Gary Hydes. I am searching for any information as to what happened to me. I started my search around 9 years ago where i appealed for help on Meridian Mews, GMTV, and local newspapers, where as I then met the women who found me and other people who were involved in my case I then appeared in a documentary on channel 2 called found, I then stopped my search for a while as i had my daughter and started again 2 years ago when I appeared in a documentary on BBC 3 in April 2011 called The Gatwick Baby Abandoned at Birth. Following this I went in national newspapers again, this morning and the late late show in Ireland. the documentary also went worldwide but unfortunately I have not found out what happened to me the day or the days before I was abandoned. since doing the Documentary I have had a son and although I have a happy family I want to know what happened to me in the early days as I do not know my name, birthday or if I have any brothers or sisters.I am looking for any information that anyone might know or have to find out what happened to me you can message me on Facebook or on my email address at the top.

Guy Sebastian's most intimate interview | 60 Minutes Australia,Entertainment,480488,"6,652",201,"Anyone who believes in the saying “good guys finish last” doesn’t know Guy Sebastian. The enormously successful Aussie pop artist thrives on not having any of the often-seen fundamentals of show business. There’s no out-of-control ego, no temper tantrums and no sycophantic entourage. Instead, Guy relies on hard work and a loving family. Being decent though hasn’t been without its challenges. When he was starting out, he had to ignore the industry experts who said the young man with a very distinct afro hairdo didn’t have the look to be successful.

New Horizons - Summiting the Solar System: Part 2,Science & Technology,72676,,,"On January 1, 2019, Ultima Thule, and object in the Kuiper Belt four billion miles from Earth, will be the most ancient and most distant world ever explored close up. Ultima is expected to offer discoveries about the origin and evolution of our solar system.""Summiting"" goes behind the scenes of the most ambitious occultation campaigns ever mounted, as scientists deployed telescopes to Senegal and Colombia in 2018, and Argentina, South Africa and New Zealand in 2017, to glimpse Ultima as it passed in front of a star, and gathered data on the object's size and orbit that has been essential to planning the flyby. Mission scientists recall the astonishing scientific success of flying through the Pluto system in 2015, and use comparative planetology to show how Earth and Pluto are both amazingly different and—with glaciers, tall mountains, volcanoes and blue skies—awesomely similar. Appealing to space junkies and adrenaline junkies alike, ""Summiting"" brings viewers along for the ride of a lifetime as New Horizons pushes past Pluto and braves an even more hazardous unknown.More on the New Horizons mission: pluto.jhuapl.eduCredit: Geoff Haines Stiles of Geoff Haines Stiles Productions (GHSPi)",PT70M51S,2018-12-30,2018-12-30,126521,JHU Applied Physics Laboratory,/channel/UCz4r-ikQdWEj1gG1aFJTy-g,UCz4r-ikQdWEj1gG1aFJTy-g,20,FjTuzrI07qY

Inequality – how wealth becomes power (1/3) | DW Documentary (poverty richness documentary),Education,1989265,"21,741","1,581","Germany is one of the world’s richest countries, but inequality is on the rise. The wealthy are pulling ahead, while the poor are falling behind. For the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph Gröner, one of Germany’s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. ""If you have great wealth, you can’t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,” Gröner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts.  ""Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because we’re more independent,” Gröner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko Milanović, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. ""These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,"" Milanović notes. ""Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?”_______DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines. Watch high-class documentaries from German broadcasters and international production companies.

25 Chemistry Experiments in 15 Minutes | Andrew Szydlo | TEDxNewcastle,Nonprofits & Activism,1984664,"77,918","1,313","Whacky colour changes, magic disappearing water, blowing up dustbins, clouds of steam, thunder air explosions. Are you ready to fasten your seatbelts and enjoy the ‘explosive’ journey?In his talk, Andrew aims to promote chemistry as the science of remarkable changes, which are often overlooked yet so important in our everyday life. And he does it brilliantly by performing an incredible series of 25 experiments in 15 minutes, totally amazing the audience (who rewards him with a long and deserved standing ovation)! Andrew Z. Szydło is an internationally acclaimed chemistry teacher. But he’s definitely not the typical chemistry teacher you would expect…He holds a PhD in the History and Philosophy of Science from UCL, and is an expert on the history of alchemy (his 1994 book ‘Water Which Does Not Wet Hands’ is considered to be the standard reference work on the Polish alchemist Michael Sendivogius.)But his polymath spirit extends further: he’s a violin, bugle and accordion player, as well as a professional photographer. Throughout the years Andrew has wowed audiences all around the world with his pyrotechnical approach to teaching and demonstrating chemical sciences on stage and has appeared many times on TV.

"Welcome to Bangkok, Thailand | DW Documentary",Education,927525,"8,270",350,"Thailand’s capital city, Bangkok, is unique. This film reveals the best spots: well-known locations, and places off the beaten track. Our report provides a detailed guide to Asia’s most exciting city. For transportation, visitors and local residents alike can choose from motorized rickshaws, taxis, subways, or the sky train. There are also express boats that ply the Chao Phraya River -- plus long-tail boats, and vessels that make their way through the city's khlongs, or canals. This journey of discovery takes us to the places where Bangkok residents go to rest and relax -- like the island of Ko Samet in the Gulf of Thailand. This is the capital's version of Wannsee Lake in Berlin.  You can book a river cruise, or visit one of the trendy open-air bars perched atop high-rise buildings. A lot of younger Bangkok residents have taken up a bold challenge in this car-friendly city: they've switched to bicycles. Many locals enjoy making a bike visit to the village-like central district, near a big bend in the river -- even when the temperature rises above 30-degrees centigrade. On the islands off the coast, there's plenty of sunshine, beautiful beaches, and clear, warm water -- a mix that attracts crowds of Bangkok residents on weekends._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Today, he is an international fugitive with a $32m fortune that he amassed through fraud.Buddhists around the world were shocked when footage emerged of the monk on a private plane, clutching a Louis Vuitton bag and fidgeting with high-end gadgets. His extravagance put him atop a long list of misbehaving monks making headlines in Thailand for fist fights, smuggling drugs, selling guns, hiding pornography and more.In response, Thailand's military junta has set up a 24-hour hotline for the public to report rule-breaking monks. But the junta is also proposing new laws to criminalise breaking any Buddhist rule - a move some fear is an over-reaction that would threaten religious freedom.101 East exclusively reveals where Thailand's infamous jet-setting monk has been hiding, and meets those on a mission to save the country's moral soul.More from 101 East on:YouTube - http://aje.io/101eastYouTubeFacebook - http://facebook.com/101east Twitter - http://twitter.com/aj101east Instagram - http://instagram.com/aj101east Website - http://aljazeera.com/101east#AlJazeeraEnglish #Thailand #Monk",PT25M1S,2014-12-18,2014-12-18,122644,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,382VkLGpDaI

Our constant desire for more is part of our human nature.Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?""People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,"" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isn’t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that ""The Greed Program,"" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed.

How poor people survive in the USA | DW Documentary,Education,11983792,"132,231","18,161","Homelessness, hunger and shame: poverty is rampant in the richest country in the world. Over 40 million people in the United States live below the poverty line, twice as many as it was fifty years ago. It can happen very quickly.Many people in the United States fall through the social safety net. In the structurally weak mining region of the Appalachians, it has become almost normal for people to go shopping with food stamps. And those who lose their home often have no choice but to live in a car. There are so many homeless people in Los Angeles that relief organizations have started to build small wooden huts to provide them with a roof over their heads. The number of homeless children has also risen dramatically, reaching 1.5 million, three times more than during the Great Depression the 1930s. A documentary about the fate of the poor in the United States today.We closed the commentary section because of too many inapproriate comments. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

True Crime Story: The Magic Syringe (Crime Documentary) | Real Stories,Film & Animation,673241,"3,715",378,"An alarming number of deaths occurring in the Intensive Care Unit of a California hospital had staff members highly concerned. Hospital staffers suspected one of the respiratory therapists was up to something. Rumor’s surfaced of a “magic syringe” used by the therapist, possibly to administer poison to kill patients in the hospital. When drugs were found in the therapist’s possession, investigators brought him in for questioning, at which time he admitted to killing hundreds of people. Without corroborating evidence, however, authorities would have to let him go. Forensic scientists were brought in to develop a method of detecting the suspected poisons in the bodies of past victims. When poison was detected in several bodies exhumed by authorities, the respiratory therapist called “the angel of death” would finally be convicted.Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/RealStoriesC...Instagram - @realstoriesdocsTwitter: https://twitter.com/realstoriesdocsContent licensed from New Dominion Pictures.

This is my day to day life throughout the 7 days that I spent in North Korea. You can never be sure whether things were staged or not in North Korea because you are only shown what they want you to see. You can't choose where or when you will be going to specific places, they simply tell you to hop on a bus and ask you to get off at one point or another.That is why I didn't want to offer my opinion about whether things were staged or not, whether they were good or not, or honest or not.

No, because 'Terrible' in English also means awesome or formidable - this was well understood when 'Гро́зный' was first translated into English centuries ago, but now fewer people understand this.

Sir Roger Scruton: How to Be a Conservative,News & Politics,710667,"15,418",588,"Recorded on February 27, 2017In the latest episode from Uncommon Knowledge, Sir Roger Scruton, a formally trained political philosopher, talks about his life and the events he’s witnessed that led him to conservatism. He first embraced conservatism after witnessing the leftist student protests in France in May 1968. During the ensuing riots in Paris, more than three hundred people  were injured. Scruton walked away from this event with a change in worldview and a strong leaning toward conservatism. Visits to communist- controlled Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1979 cemented his preference for conservatism and his distaste for the fraud of communism and socialism,  initiating a desire to do something about it. From thereon he dedicated himself to helping organize underground seminars for the young people oppressed behind the iron curtain. Sir Roger examines a brief history of conservatism in the twentieth century of England in regard to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. Although  he appreciates what Margaret Thatcher stood for, he argues that she had many conservative ideals but never used the conservative framework to organize her overall political strategy. Instead she organized around market economics, which was not always effective in the social, cultural, and legal areas. Peter Robinson argues that Winston Churchill did a much better job of organizing around conservative ideals but eventually lost an election because he didn’t have the vocabulary or the focus on free markets. They discuss the tenuous relationship between free markets and conservative ideals that have not mixed well together in British politics. Robinson and Sir Roger discuss the 2016 political upset of Brexit in the United Kingdom and how the political analysts failed to predict the vote outcome, much like what happened in November 2016 in the United States. They deliberate how  the issues around immigration from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom contributed to Brexit, in addition to general dissatisfaction with the European Union.  Thus, in the cases of both the United Kingdom and the United States, the media and intellectuals ignored the will of the “indigenous working classes” who made their voices known through their votes. About the Guest: Sir Roger ScrutonSir Roger Scruton is an English writer and philosopher who has published more than fifty books in philosophy, aesthetics, and politics. His book discussed in this episode was How to Be a Conservative;  it was published in 2014. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington. DC. He is currently teaching an MA in philosophy course for the University of Buckingham. Sir Scruton was knighted in 2016 by Queen Elizabeth II for his “services to philosophy, teaching and public education.”Additional Resources: Brexit:http://www.hoover.org/news/hoover-fel...http://www.hoover.org/research/brusse...http://www.hoover.org/research/gibral...https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...https://www.theguardian.com/commentis...http://www.hoover.org/research/will-b...

Why I escaped from my brainwashed country | Hyeonseo Lee | TEDxKyoto,Nonprofits & Activism,1607153,"33,721",686,"North Korean defector, Hyeonseo Lee opens her own life and losses to the world in order to  illuminate a human rights tragedy that has for too long rested in the shadows.Great or small, our losses stay with us, unshakeable even as we grow beyond them. Hyeonseo Lee knows about loss. A North Korean defector, Hyeonseo once thought her country the best on earth. In 1995 her beliefs and life were shattered as the truths of famine, death and brutality crashed upon her. Her survival depended on her ability to escape North Korea to restart her life, but at a high price̶the loss of her family, home and country. Since escaping North Korea, Hyeonseo has risen to be a powerful voice for human rights, speaking in front of the UN Security Council and sharing her story and the plight of North Korean refugees across the world through speaking engagements and written articles featured in major newspapers, magazines and journals. By opening her own life and losses to the world, Hyeonseo Lee has helped illuminate a human rights tragedy that has for too long rested in the shadows, and along the way, has transformed loss into the promise of hope.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Bono & Eugene Peterson | THE PSALMS,Education,1144300,"12,564",376,"This short film documents the friendship between Bono (of the band U2) and Eugene Peterson (author of contemporary-language Bible translation The Message) revolving around their common interest in the Psalms. Based on interviews conducted by Fuller Seminary faculty member David Taylor and produced in association with Fourth Line Films, the film highlights in particular a conversation on the Psalms that took place between Bono, Peterson, and Taylor at Peterson’s Montana home.The film is featured exclusively through FULLER studio, a site offering resources—videos, podcasts, reflections, stories—for all who seek deeply formed spiritual lives. Explore these resources, on the Psalms and a myriad of other topics, at http://Fuller.edu/Studio.© Fuller Theological Seminary / Fuller Studioa Fourth Line Films production, in association with Fuller's Brehm Center Texas and W. David O. TaylorBono:[Video message, 2002] Mr. Peterson, Eugene, my name is Bono. I'm the singer with the group U2 and wanted to video message you my thanks and our thanks from the band for this remarkable work you've done. There's been some great translations, very literary translations, but no translation that I've read that speaks to me in my own language, so I want to thank you for that. Take a rest now, won't you? Bye.Eugene Peterson:I’d never heard of Bono before. Then one of my students showed up in class with a copy of the Rolling Stones—Rolling Stones?—and in it there was an interview with Bono in which he talked about me and The Message. He used some slangy language about who I was, and I said, ""Who's Bono?"" They were dumbfounded I'd never heard of Bono, but that's not the circle I really travel in very much. That's how I first heard about him.Then people started bringing me his music, and I listened to his music, and I thought, ""I like this guy."" After a while I started feeling quite pleased that he knew me.[Interview at Point Loma Nazarene University, 2007:]Dean Nelson:Yes, but the rest of the story is that he invited you to come and hang with them for a while. You turned him down.Eugene Peterson:I was pushing a deadline on The Message. I was finishing up the Old Testament at the time, and I really couldn't do it.Dean Nelson:You may be the only person alive who would turn down the opportunity just to make a deadline. I mean, come on. It's Bono, for crying out loud!Eugene Peterson:Dean, he was Isaiah.Dean Nelson:Yeah.Jan Peterson:The Old Testament is a long, long book, much longer than the New Testament, and it did take a long time and a lot of devotion on both of our parts to have that happen.Bono:I have to say, in the last years, Eugene's writing has kept me as sane as this is, if you call it sane, which you probably won't. Run With the Horses, that's a powerful manual for me, and it includes a lot of incendiary ideas. I hadn't really thought of Jeremiah as a performance artist. Why do we need art? Why do we need the lyric poetry of the Psalms? Why do we need them? Because the only way we can approach God is if we're honest through metaphor, through symbol. Art becomes essential, not decorative. I learned about art, I learned about the Prophets, I learned about Jeremiah with that book, and that really changed me.Eugene Peterson:Then several years later...This was about 4 years ago, 4 or 5 years ago...Bono would like Jan and me to come to Dallas for a concert. We went to the concert. He was very sensitive to us. We were really well cared for, had really good seats. I'd never seen a mash pit before. That was my introduction to the mash pit. Is it a pit?(Voice off camera):It's a mosh pit.Eugene Peterson:Mosh pit. Okay. You can see how uneducated I am in this world.We had a 3-hour lunch. We just had a lovely conversation. It was very personal, relational. He didn't put me on any kind of a pedestal, and I didn't him, so we were very natural with each other. Through that 3-hour conversation, I was just really taken by the simplicity of his life, of who he was, who he is. There was no pretension to him. At that point I just felt like he was a companion in the faith.[About U2’s song “40,” based on Psalm 40:]I think it's one of his best ones. He sings it a lot. I mean, he does this a lot. It's one of the songs that reaches into the hurt and disappointment and difficulty of being a human being. It acknowledges that in language that is immediately recognizable. There's something that reaches into the heart of a person and the stuff we all feel but many of us don't talk about.Bono:[Quoting from The Message’s translation of Psalm 40:]I waited and waited and waited for God. At last he looked. Finally he listened. He lifted me out of the ditch. He pulled me from deep mud, stood me up on a solid rock to make sure that I wouldn't slip. He taught me how to sing the latest God-song...For more resources for a deeply formed spiritual life, visit: https://fullerstudio.fuller.edu now.",PT21M43S,2016-04-26,2016-04-26,162452,FULLER studio,/channel/UC8B79SXbCi79ob5yxWEJc1Q,UC8B79SXbCi79ob5yxWEJc1Q,20,-l40S5e90KY

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.

"StarTalk Podcast: Cosmic Queries – Black Holes and Dark Energy, with Neil deGrasse Tyson",Science & Technology,275958,"7,895",155,"On this episode of StarTalk Radio, we bring you the classic StarTalk formula that you’ve come to know and love. Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice answer fan-submitted Cosmic Queries on the mysteries of the universe, specifically, black holes and dark energy. We start with a simple question: are we sure there’s a black hole at the center of the galaxy? Neil teaches us the methods we use to measure black holes. He also reminds us of the Copernican principle. You’ll learn why the more massive the galaxy, the more massive the black hole at its center. Neil and Chuck reminisce on the movie Marooned. Discover more about electron degeneracy, neutron stars, and pulsars. You’ll hear if it’s possible for a black hole to re-ignite into a star once it loses enough mass through Hawking radiation. Chuck has an idea for a science fiction film about a killer black hole until Neil squashes it with some Star Trek trivia. We explore whether a black hole can warp spacetime around it. You’ll learn what happens to the gravitational well of a star if the star comes across a black hole. And, of course, it wouldn’t be a show about black holes if we didn’t talk about the movie Interstellar. We ponder if “Planet 9” could be a black hole. If the Earth turned into a black hole would it still orbit the sun? The answer may surprise you. We investigate what might be at the center of a supercluster. Then, we dive into dark energy. Neil explains why dark energy is still mysterious. You’ll also learn more about the Albedo effect and the Doppler shift. All that, plus, you’ll find out if dark energy has an impact on your everyday life.This episode originally aired February 24, 2020.Support us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/startalkradioSubscribe to StarTalk: https://www.youtube.com/user/startalk...Follow StarTalk:Twitter: http://twitter.com/startalkradioFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/StarTalkInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/startalkradio/About StarTalk: Science meets pop culture on StarTalk!

Soyalism | DW Documentary,Education,366758,"3,798",239,"Industrial agriculture is increasingly dominating the world market. It’s forcing small farmers to quit and taking over vast swathes of land. This documentary shows how destructive the lucrative agribusiness is.Whether in the USA, Brazil, Mozambique or China, agricultural giants rule the market. Food production has become a gigantic business as climate change and population growth continue. This is having devastating consequences for small farmers and for the environment. On the banks of North Carolina’s New River, there’s a vile stench. Clean water activist Rick Dove takes a flight to show us what’s causing the smell. Scores and scores of pigs are living upriver, in so many pens the farms look more like small towns. ""We have eight to ten million pigs here. And the problem is that they are kept so close together and their excrement pollutes and threatens the water and natural life on the North Carolina coastline."" From above, you can see large cesspools everywhere, shimmering red-brown in the sun. Dove is giving us a bird’s-eye view of industrialized agriculture. In the late 1970s, companies in the US began to industrialize farming. Large corporations like Smithfield built entire value chains, from raising livestock to slaughter to packaging and sales. A Chinese holding company bought Smithfield a few years ago. Industrial meat production is supposed to support increased Chinese demand for meat as the country’s prosperity grows. Dan Basse is the head of a company analyses global agriculture. He says calorie demand will also increase in countries like India, Bangladesh and Nigeria in the next few years."" And with it, the demand for even more inexpensive meat of the kind agribusinesses produce and market.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

ARIRANG PRIME(Ep.265) A Pianist from North Korea _ Full Episode,Entertainment,13041,97,3,"In December 2001, 27-year-old Kim Cheol-woong put his life on the line to flee from North Korea and slip into Yanbian. It was not an escape from starvation or violation of human rights. He escaped simply because he wanted to play the piano.Kim Cheol-woong was a son of one of the most powerful families in North Korea. He majored in piano performance at Pyongyang University of Music and Dance and even studied abroad in Russia on government scholarship.After finishing his studies, he played the piano for the State Symphony Orchestra of DPRK and secured his future.Around that time, he fell in love with a woman.She was the niece of the former vice-chairman of the National Defense Commission and Kim Jong-un's uncle, Jang Sung-taek.Kim Cheol-woong started practicing a piano piece he had heard in Russia to play it during his proposal. However, it was a banned music piece in North Korea.He had to undergo an investigation by the State Security Department.""How dare they investigate me?""Young Kim Cheol-woong became furious. It distressed him to live in a world where playing the piano could become a criminal act.Without telling his parents, he escaped from North Korea and slipped into Yanbian. However, all that waited for him there was fear as a fugitive and hard labor. From farm work to logging, he did anything to survive. Chinese police even arrested him twice and tried to repatriate him but he escaped.He did not want to return to a country where he could not play music of his choice.Then, missionaries came to his help in Yanbian.They helped him to arrive in Korea safely.After settling down in South Korea, Kim Cheol-woong married and even had two children. It's been 13 years since he became a Seoul citizen. He's been making a living with piano performances as well as lectures and concerts.However, he has never felt completely at ease.People labeled him as a ""North Korean defector"" wherever he went.He struggled with this for a long time, but he changed his attitude.""If you can't avoid it, enjoy it."" He began a new project.As a pianist, all he could do was music.He was not interested in politics, but he wanted to facilitate unification through the piano. He had much knowledge in North Korean music as well.He then began holding concerts to play North and South Korean music and even prepared a special highlight with Chinese Korean musicians who played modernized North Korean instruments.He doesn't know anything about politics, nor does he care.However, he decided to take a step toward unification to close the gap between North and South Koreans.

Paul Butler: Profiled on My Own Street,Nonprofits & Activism,590549,"7,486",293,"In May 2011, The Atlantic Philanthropies and The New Press (http://thenewpress.com/) hosted a discussion about racial profiling in the United States. Racial profiling stigmatises and criminalises people of colour from as early as their pre-teens, violates the rights and civil liberties of innocent people, and has devastating consequences on entire communities. The fascinating panel included former litigator and law professor Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow, and former federal prosecutor and law professor Paul Butler, author of Let's Get Free: A Hip-Hop Theory of Justice. Kent Hutchinson and Justin Coello, two young men who have been racially profiled in their neighbourhoods, also gave firsthand accounts of their experiences. In this video excerpt, Paul Butler talks about being racially profiled in his neighbourhood and on his front porch.

I studied the medical side of the issue quite carefully, so I know what I am doing. The most difficult part now is not the virus, but the Chinese police.First of all, the Chinese have one of the world’s most vigilant police forces.

Add the beef and cook for 20-22 minutes or until meat is well  browned. Make a well in centre of meat and add the onion and sweat until soft, about 3 to 4 minutes.. Add the garlic and stir to blend. Deglaze the pan with the red wine and add the herbs, spices and tomatoes and paste. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer, covered, 40 to 45 minutes or until sauce is thickened.   Adjust with a bit of water , if too thick and check seasoning. Set aside ½ cup sauce for the pasta.  Cook pasta in a large pot of rolling boiling salted water for about 7-8 minutes or until al dente. Drain pasta, and toss it with the reserved meat sauce in a large bowl.  Drizzle with other half of  olive oil.  When pasta has cooled slightly, whisk the 2 egg whites and toss into past along with a handful of the grated cheese.  Meanwhile, melt butter in a large heavy-bottomed pot on medium heat. Add the flour and whisk to combine. Cook for 1-2 minutes or until smooth. Remove pot from heat and add cold milk in very small batches whisking each time until smooth. Return to heat and whisk constantly on medium heat until mixture boils and thickens, about 4 to 5 minutes. Season the béchamel with salt, pepper and nutmeg.  Remove from heat and stir in grated cheese. Temper the yolks by adding a bit of the hot béchamel into bowl and whisking thoroughly.  Gradually add this mixture  into béchamel , stirring briskly to prevent  curdling them. Oil a 13x9x3-inch deep baking dish and pour in the pasta mixture.  Ladle in the remaining meat sauce making an even layer on top of pasta. Set aside.  Preheat oven to 350-375  D F Pour the béchamel over the pasta and cover evenly. Bake at 375 D F until top is golden brown and set, about 45- 50 minutes. Reduce heat to 350  at halfway mark if browning too much. Let stand about 45-60  minutes before serving.

Women who lose complete memory every few minutes | 60 Minutes Australia,Entertainment,428123,"4,385",174,"(2012) Imagine waking up one morning and you've forgotten everything about yourself. You don't recognise your face; You don't know your family; You can't even remember your own name. Well, that's what's happened to Nicole Caird and Claire Robertson. Every few minutes their minds wipe clean, stealing every scrap of their memory- from the birth of their children to the reason they're sitting in front of a television camera. It makes interviewing tricky so it's hard to imagine what it must be like living with the condition day in day out. But what's truly alarming is that we could all be at risk because the culprit is a common virus that most of us have lurking in our systems.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

Putin's pride: Cossacks and the church | DW Documentary,Education,493175,"5,413",527,"Russia - a global power, confident and strong. That’s the image projected by President Vladimir Putin. Decades after the Soviet Union’s collapse, Putin is relying on Russian traditions and values from the tsarist past to kindle patriotism.Many Russians see Vladimir Putin as the man who has returned pride, glory and honor to their nation. The Cossacks, an ultra-conservative group, are key to Putin's grip on power. They are honored as guardians of traditional Russian values and serve Putin as nationalist paramilitaries. Tens of thousands of Russians identify as Cossacks. They trace their origins to horsemen who formed mounted bands in the Russian steppes during the 15th Century. Over the course of time, they served many masters - including the tsars. After the Communist revolution, they faced oppression and persecution. During World War II, some were active in Hitler's armies. Now, President Putin is capitalizing on their nationalistic priorities. This documentary looks at the role Cossacks play in supporting police in Moscow, including during demonstrations by regime opponents. Another pillar of support for Putin is the Russian Orthodox Church. It has resurged under Putin, and exercises considerable political influence - an alliance that benefits both sides. Article 14, paragraph 2 of the Russian constitution defines the separation of church and state. But the Russian Orthodox Church sees itself as a bulwark against outside influence and supports the Kremlin, for example in its annexation of Crimea. It sees itself as the protector of Russian values, and views homosexuality as a sign of an impending apocalypse. The filmmakers show how nostalgia for ""Glorious Russia"" and the values of the tsarist period are playing out in modern day Russian politics.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Shelby Steele – Modern Liberalism and America’s Racial Divide,News & Politics,43376,"1,005",45,"~A Russel Kirk Lecture at The Heritage Foundation’s B. Kenneth Simon Center for Principles and Politics ~ Today’s racial divide has far more to do with the peculiar strain of liberalism that grew out of the 1960s than with race itself. Americans know, but find it hard to openly admit, that active racism is no longer the greatest barrier to black and minority advancement. Steele discusses the likelihood that today’s racial disparities are due more to dysfunctions within the black community, and to liberal social policies that have encouraged minorities to trade on past victimization rather than to overcome the damage done by that victimization. Still, the assertion that blacks today remain stymied by white racism is a dogma of modern American liberalism that cannot be questioned. The mere claim of racism has become a potent political tool that conservatives have not found an adequate response to. The cost of this failure is great. Redemption – paying off the nation’s sins – has become the moral imperative of the age and the nation’s racist past has destroyed its moral authority in the eyes of many.View more: https://www.heritage.org/progressivis...",PT66M56S,2017-11-03,2017-11-03,163244,The Heritage Foundation,/channel/UC5bEfSFTYQVfLCwkhBt8NtQ,UC5bEfSFTYQVfLCwkhBt8NtQ,20,UXqBsn94-eA

Many are the result of kids' lifestyles and are, according to the experts, causing them unnecessary suffering.With unprecedented access to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool, this documentary meets the kids, the pediatricians treating them and follows them home in an attempt to uncover the root cause of their problems. It is clear that some of the basic health messages from the doctors are not getting through to parents.The A&E is a busy department and having to deal with cases such as drunk children is not only time consuming for staff, but can be upsetting for other young patients too. Operations on dental, glue ear and obesity cases are helping clog up a system that's already under considerable strain. The hospital estimates they spend around a million pounds a year on treating preventable conditions, enough to buy them a new MRI scanner.The Good, the Bad & the Messy – our channel features documentaries and shows about stories of modern parenting.

The Russians – an intimate journey through Russia (1/2) | DW Documentary,Education,63802,"1,124",49,"A very private trip through Russia - a world power with a shrinking population, a myriad of ethnic minorities, and vast distances, a country between tradtion and future. Encounters with Russians from six different generations help us get to know a Russia beyond Moscow and the Kremlin. They tell us of a nation poised between tradition and the future. Filmmaker Juri Rescheto travelled through the giant country, meeting with ordinary Russians who share their everyday lives with him. They talk about their joys and sorrows, their hopes and needs, and their experiences - good and bad. The film shows intimate scenes from their homes and their workplaces, as well as glimpses of their political views, their standards of living, and their customs. The protagonists’ personal situations are presented in relation to official Russian studies on the particular generation to which they belong.  In Part 1 we go to a city halfway between Moscow and Novosibirsk to meet Jelena, who works as a surrogate mother in a children’s home. Then we travel to the boreal forest in western Siberia to meet 16-year-old Veronika, who spends most of the year in a boarding school. Her parents are reindeer herders and members of the indigenous Khanty people. The generation of young adults in Russia is represented by Kirill, who holds down a normal job, but spends his free time practicing a dangerous hobby: no holds barred boxing.Watch Part 2 here: https://youtu.be/z35dX3EEGkoGet to know the Russians a little better in our 6-part YouTube special:Part 1: Birth - https://youtu.be/3cO58tL1CUwPart 2: Childhood - https://youtu.be/4IG4eVdhbxIPart 3: Youth - https://youtu.be/sRIiTk1nR78Part 4: Adulthood - https://youtu.be/he8FGw9e-pcPart 5: Old age - https://youtu.be/SAnWF6yTaWQPart 6: Death - https://youtu.be/bQN420LIwrc-------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

The cardboard also is just for this stage of smothering weeds - keep them in the dark and they expire! Then you don't need to lay any more cardboard, once there are no weeds.You can use less compost and even since we filmed this video, supplies have tightened. Lay thick card on weeds then 2in/5cm compost asap in early spring, and wet the card if it's dry. Then use a trowel to 'cut' potato size holes in the card and a little into the weedy soil below, to pop in a seed potato. This can give some harvest by summer, while killing weeds too, but you must pull any weeds you see :)Using less compost for no dig https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IC6OB...If you do not have access to any compost, use old leaves, manure at least half-decomposed - or at limit the one month old you see in this video. Results in year one will be less brilliant than in subsequent years, but you will be clearing weeds easily as well as having a harvest.Vegetables like potatoes, squash and zucchini grow well though cardboard and less-perfect compost.

The kidnapping campaign of Nazi Germany | DW Documentary,Education,770957,"7,198",447,"On orders from Heinrich Himmler, the Nazis abducted children from Poland for forced Germanization. Hermann Lüdeking, Jozef Sowa and Alodia Witaszek have never met, but they shared the same fate.Tears still come to Jozef Sowa’s eyes when he talks about his life. His parents were murdered by Wehrmacht soldiers in Poland in 1943, and he and his four siblings were taken to Germany. Four of them managed to return to Poland. But his younger sister Janina was given up for adoption - as a supposedly German child. She still lives in Germany today. This kidnapping was planned. In 1941, Himmler, who headed the Nazi SS, gave the order to ""gather young children who are especially racially suitable from Polish families and for us to raise them in special modestly-sized kindergartens and children’s homes.""Professor Isabel Heinemann explains, ""By so doing, he aimed to build up the German race."" For years, the historian has been researching the fates of the estimated 50 thousand children in Europe who were snatched. The largest group comes from Poland. Without their biological parents to protect them, the children were given to German families by the ""SS Race and Resettlement Main Office."" Their names and dates of birth were changed to obscure their true identity.After the war ended, those whose origins could be traced returned to their homelands. But their native countries had often become foreign to them and being singled out as a German ""Hitler child"" made reintegration difficult. Those responsible for the kidnapping were never brought to justice.Spanish and Arabic will be available online in April.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

How could veganism change the world? | The Economist,Film & Animation,743725,"29,574","1,672","Interest in vegan food and its associated health benefits has been booming across the rich world. A global retreat from meat could have a far-reaching environmental impact.Click here to subscribe to The Economist on YouTube: https://econ.st/2xvTKdy By 2050 the world's population could approach 10 billion - and around 60% more food could be needed to feed everyone. The environmental impacts of the food system are daunting its responsible for about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions and uses about 70% of all freshwater resources, and it occupies about 40% of the Earth's land surface.Food rated emissions could increase to 50 percent by 2050 and fill up the total emissions budget that we have in order to avoid dangerous levels of climate change.Interest in vegan food has been booming across the rich world. A major study has put the diet to the test -  analyzing an imagined scenario in which the world goes vegan by 2050. If everybody went vegan by 2050 we estimated that food-related greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by 3/4.Cows are the biggest emission contributors. Bugs in their digestive system produce methane and deforestation for their pasture releases carbon dioxide - these gases warm the planet. If cows were a country, they'd be the third largest greenhouse gas emitter.Daily Watch: mind-stretching short films throughout the working week.For more from Economist Films visit: http://films.economist.com/ Check out The Economist’s full video catalogue: http://econ.st/20IehQk Like The Economist on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheEconomist/ Follow The Economist on Twitter: https://twitter.com/theeconomist Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/ Follow us on Medium: https://medium.com/@the_economist",PT6M30S,2018-11-27,2018-11-27,122354,The Economist,/channel/UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,UC0p5jTq6Xx_DosDFxVXnWaQ,20,hwoL6hWd4l0
Malaysia: Power and Corruption | 101 East,News & Politics,717836,"5,276",456,"In 2018, after more than 60 years being ruled by the same party, Malaysians voted out Najib Razak and his government - the catalyst, the disappearance of billions of dollars of public funds involving Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB.Police raids on Najib's family homes after the election seized more than $270m  worth of cash and luxury goods including Hermes Birkin handbags worth in excess of $10m and 12,000 pieces of jewellery - valued at more than $100m.For internationally acclaimed Malaysian cartoonist Zunar, none of this came as a surprise. For years, his cartoons portrayed images of government corruption and the extravagance of Najib's wife, Rosmah.Under Najib's government, Zunar faced nine criminal charges for his cartoons, carrying sentences totalling more than 43 years in jail - such was the crackdown on those who dared to speak out.Now a free man, he says that Rosmah had been ""the most powerful person in Malaysia"" when she was First Lady.A controversial Malaysian businessman, Deepak Jaikishan, who claims to have been Rosmah's confidant and her and Najib's business partner, backs up Zunar. Accusing the couple of benefitting from government deals, he says, ""It went to a point where every project had to go through her. Any cabinet minister who defied her or dared to voice out against her was just x-ed off. You could say she's the de facto prime minister.""Najib currently faces more than 40 criminal charges, from money laundering to abuse of power, while his wife Rosmah faces 19 charges for money laundering and tax evasion. Both continue to deny all charges.101 East lifts the curtain on the alleged corruption of the former Prime Minister, Najib Razak, and his wife, Rosmah, and investigates how key institutions were rendered powerless as the nation's coffers were robbed.- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/#AlJazeeraEnglish #Malaysia #Corruption",PT26M1S,2019-05-09,2019-05-09,142371,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,U2K-afWJbXY

As a consequence, he now calls a maximum-security jail in England home while he fights a bitter battle with the Trump administration which wants him extradited to the United States. Before prison, the controversial – and now very frail – Australian spent seven years holed up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London. And that’s where Assange conceived his own top secrets – two sons with his, until now, equally secretive fiancée, Stella Moris.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

Father Figures is a POV documentary that journeys behind the lens of Canadian filmmaker April Butler as she examines her own 73-year-old father’s romantic relationship with a 23-year-old woman living in the Philippines. Dale met Girlie on-line and 2 months later announced their engagement. Dale has moved Girlie from her family home in Roxas City, Philippines to a nearby apartment they both share. A wedding is on the horizon and Girlie is also hoping for a baby.  What begins as a quirky love story about family and a future step-mother half the filmmaker’s age, soon spirals into a world of poverty and western entitlement. As she follows the couple throughout Asia, April begins to wonder who is conning whom. Her moral compass already on high alert, all bets are off when an accidental discovery reveals a lie sending shock waves through Canadian and Filipino communities.

I’m a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York and I specialize in something called string theory.  I’m a physicist.Some people ask me the question, “What has physics done for me lately?  I mean, do I get better color television, do I get better internet reception with physics?”  And the answer is yes.  You see, physics is at the very foundation of matter and energy.  We physicists invented the laser beam, we invented the transistor.  We helped to create the first computer.  We helped to construct the internet.  We wrote the World Wide Web.  In addition, we also helped to invent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI scans, PET scans, x-rays.  In other words, almost everything you see in your living room, almost everything you see in a modern hospital, at some point or other, can be traced to a physicist.Now, I got interested in physics when I was a child.  When I was a child of eight, something happened to me that changed my life and I wanted to be part of this grand search for a theory of everything.  When I was eight, a great scientist had just died.

Videos are focused on primitive skills, rewilding, tracking and nature awareness, living off the land, off grid living, indigenous skills, shelter building, primitive fire, water purification, trapping, hunting, bow making, flint knapping, primitive pottery,  basketry, edible and medicinal plant preparation and numerous indigenous skills.     I began studying wilderness survival when I was 17 in order to have the ability to spend extensive periods of time in nature, seeking out empowerment without the need for external sources.  I began studying in 1993 under Tom Brown Jr eventually teaching for Tracker Inc.  I sought-out every old Native American teacher I could and eventually traveled the world living in very remote indigenous villages in the Amazon, Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and Peru.  My school teaches survival and primitive skills, nature awareness,  how to live off the land, re-wilding and how to prepare for disasters.  I strongly believe that experiencing survival living changes the way people approach their entire lives. http://www.wildsurvivalskills.com/",PT34M7S,2016-06-22,2016-06-22,147743,Tom McElroy-Wild Survival,/channel/UC6ftIQAlFTI5Z5UyIFWYApg,UC6ftIQAlFTI5Z5UyIFWYApg,19,2cPdoqjgwfk

The Dangers of Whitewashing Black History | David Ikard | TEDxNashville,Nonprofits & Activism,879897,"28,536","1,565","Should white people care about the whitewashing of black history? Most people will likely answer yes to this question, if only because it sounds politically correct to do so. What will hopefully become clear is that whites have as much to lose by whitewashing black history as their African American peers. David Ikard is a Professor of African American and Diaspora Studies at Vanderbilt University. His research and teaching interests include African American Literature, black feminist criticism, hip-hop culture, black masculinity and whiteness studies. He is the author/co-author of four books, including ""Breaking The Silence: Toward a Black Male Feminist Criticism"" (2007), ""Nation of Cowards: Black Activism in Barack Obama's Post-Racial America"" (2012; co-authored with Martell Teasley and winner of the 2013 Best Scholarly Book Award by DISA), ""Blinded by the Whites: Why Race Still Matters in 21st-Century America"" (2013), and ""Lovable Racists, Magical Negroes, and White Messiahs"" (2017). His essays have appeared in African American Review, MELUS , Palimpsest,  African and Black Diaspora Journal,  The Journal of Black Studies, and  Obsidian III.

"Atul Gawande: ""Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End"" | Talks at Google",People & Blogs,83522,819,24,"Surgeon, public health researcher, and MacArthur fellow Atul Gawande discusses his #1 NY Times bestseller, ""Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End.""Modern medicine has transformed the dangers of birth, injury, and infectious disease from harrowing to manageable. But when it comes to the inescapable realities of aging and death, what medicine can do often runs counter to what it should do. Through eye-opening research and gripping stories of his own patients and family, Gawande reveals the suffering produced by medicine’s neglect of the wishes people might have beyond mere survival. To find out what those wishes are, we need to ask. We haven’t been asking, but we can learn. Riveting, honest, and humane, this remarkable book, which has already changed the national conversation on aging and death, shows how the ultimate goal is not a good death but a good life—all the way to the very end.Get the book here: https://goo.gl/AU2BCbModerated by Tom Smith.",PT63M26S,2017-10-13,2017-10-13,144573,Talks at Google,/channel/UCbmNph6atAoGfqLoCL_duAg,UCbmNph6atAoGfqLoCL_duAg,20,mviU9OeufA0

In an era of unstoppable distractions, Goleman persuasively argues that now more than ever we must learn to sharpen focus if we are to survive in a complex world.Goleman boils down attention research into a threesome: inner, other, and outer focus. Drawing on rich case studies from fields as diverse as competitive sports, education, the arts, and business, he shows why high-achievers need all three kinds of focus, and explains how those who rely on Smart Practices—mindfulness meditation, focused preparation and recovery, positive emotions and connections, and mental ""prosthetics"" that help them improve habits, add new skills, and sustain greatness—excel while others do not.",PT55M20S,2013-12-06,2013-12-06,164373,Talks at Google,/channel/UCbmNph6atAoGfqLoCL_duAg,UCbmNph6atAoGfqLoCL_duAg,20,b9yRmpcXKjY

Mind is Everything | Dr. David Hendricks | TEDxTraverseCity,Nonprofits & Activism,2010204,"12,058","1,006","Dr. David Hendricks is motivated to help others achieve sobriety. He integrates the Buddhist philosophy of mind into his mental health practice, explaining that meditation has a profound impact on the brain, including those regions of the brain affected by childhood abuse (he notes such abuse accounts for suffering of drug addiction or mental illness in adulthood). He cites new research that shows the brain has the capacity to grow new cells, and the role of epigenetics. He says a powerfully focused mind can take conscious control of the brain's functions to heal wounds of the past.David Hendricks is a board certified physician. In the early 1980's, he took vows as a Buddhist practitioner, and regularly studied with a Tibetan monk and professor of Buddhist Studies at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. In 1989 he met the Dalai Lama who made a suggestion that changed his life. He and his wife, a Buddhist scholar capable of translating Sanskrit and Tibetan, left the U.S. in 2003 for north India and The Library of Tibetan Works and Archives, and translated and studied a text on Buddhist psychology. They returned to the United States in 2005, and began a treatment center for substance use disorders and other mental health issues. David is currently writing a book about a new treatment methodology incorporating what he and his wife learned in India, that promises to enhance the success of treatment for these disorders.This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Unknown Identity: The Untold Life of a Donor-Conceived Person | Lizzy Forman | TEDxTheMastersSchool,Nonprofits & Activism,102555,"1,582",67,"Lizzy Forman will address her privilege as a member of a new generation of kids conceived through the use of sperm banks, and the challenges of growing up with no idea whose DNA lived within her. Lizzy is an advocate for donor-conceived people across the U.S. and has helped create and gather a group for donor-conceived people in New York and surrounding areas. She will attempt to reach out to people from all walks of life and help them understand what it means to be donor-conceived and struggling with identity, whether one is aware of being donor-conceived or not. This is a community that has been buried since its conception, says Lizzy, who adds that she will do her best to reveal it and give the audience new insight into donor-conceived friends, family and loved ones. Lizzy Forman is a donor-conceived person born and raised in New York City; she was raised in a single-parent household by her mother and an army of au pairs. While growing up, she had knowledge of diverse family standards in a liberal city like New York, with the addition of her own experience — the challenges of growing up with no idea whose DNA lived within her. She would explain her family dynamics to anyone who asked about her dad in this way: “I have a mommy, a babysitter, and a dog named Rusty, but I don’t have a dad.” In her freshman year of high school, Lizzy became more interested in her genetics. She was able to find a biological half-brother from the same donor through a donor-conceived sibling registry. They met in December 2016 and have been close ever since. In 2017, Lizzy took an ancestry DNA test and found a half-sibling and her donor. After her recent connection with her biological father, Lizzy has been slowly piecing together traits shared between the two.

Melissa Ann Shepard : Internet Black Widow (2012) - the fifth estate,News & Politics,2680062,"9,886","1,593","Family members say she preyed on the lonely, then married and buried them. Now the so-called Black Widow has been charged with attempted murder after the the suspicious sudden illness of another husband. the fifth estate's Linden MacIntyre first spoke to Melissa Ann Shepard, then Melissa Friedrich when she was in jail in Florida, and then again on the phone last year after she moved back to Nova Scotia. In this 2012 doc, MacIntyre tells her troubling story, with exclusive interviews and details on the latest twists and turns in an unfolding mystery the fifth estate has been following since 2005.Alexander Strategos did what any lonely 73-year-old retiree in Florida looking for love would do -- he logged on to a seniors' website and made a date. The 69-year-old brunette from Canada who answered his call arrived in a new white Cadillac and quickly made herself at home in his condo. Over the next two months, police believe Melissa Ann Friedrich drugged Strategos, took control of his home, stole his life savings and was already searching for her next victim on Internet dating sites.the fifth estate's Linden MacIntyre investigated Sheppard 's remarkable and complex story, including a lengthy and dramatic interview with her in prison. After police arrested Sheppard on charges of exploitation of the elderly, they learned she had at least 13 aliases and at least 30 prior convictions for various kinds of fraud dating back to 1970. They also learned that she was convicted of manslaughter in 1992 after running over, not once but twice, her 44-year-old husband on a dirt road near the Halifax airport. Another husband died in 2002, and while Friedrich was not charged, to this day family members suspect her in his death. And in March 2005, Sheppard was convicted on seven charges of theft and forgery. She was released from prison in Florida in 2009, and until this 2012, had apparently been living a quiet life for three years.Shepard left prison in 2016 after serving an 3.5 year sentence for administering a noxious substance and failing to provide the necessaries of life to Fred Weeks, who was her newlywed husband. Weeks fell ill at a bed-and-breakfast in Cape Breton in September 2012, just a few days after marrying Shepard.---Subscribe for more videos from the fifth estate : http://bit.ly/25W8cpnConnect with the fifth estate online : Website : http://bit.ly/1d0FBxqFacebook : http://bit.ly/1UO9B8STwitter : http://bit.ly/237VM8PInstagram : http://bit.ly/25W8SLsAbout the fifth estate : For four decades the fifth estate has been Canada's premier investigative documentary program.

Eminem: Behind the Lyrics (FULL DOCUMENTARY),Film & Animation,2808960,"24,888","1,458","Rapper, record producer and songwriter Marshall Bruce Mathers III, commonly known as Eminem was born in 1972 in Kansas City, USA.  Having sold over 100 million albums worldwide, he is regarded as one of the best selling artists in the world and has been previously ranked as the best selling artist of the 2000's.  Eminem burst on to the US charts in 1999 with a controversial take on the hip hop subgenre, horrorcore.  His first major label debut album Slim Shady EP contains a provocative fest of violent, twisted lyrics and is claimed to be written from the perspective of his alter ego Slim Shady. While offending an array of individuals and various other artists named in his album lead him to become one of the biggest starts on the planet.  Eminem isn't just about controversy and shock value.  The often misunderstood major talent has given white rappers credibility with his string of Grammy nominations , his critically acclaimed film 8 mile and three multiplatinum studio albums.  Aside from Eminem's musical success, he has continually hit headlines with his turbulent relationship with Kimberley Ann Scott and ongoing legal disputes with his own mother.  With an eighth studio album on its way, Eminem continues to take the world by storm.

The Genesis of the 1918 Spanish Influenza Pandemic,Education,447734,,,"Michael Worobey, Professor, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, The University of ArizonaThe Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918 was the most intense outbreak of disease in human history. It killed upwards of 50 million people (most in a six-week period) casting a long shadow of fear and mystery: nearly a century later, scientists have been unable to explain why, unlike all other influenza outbreaks, it killed young adults in huge numbers. I will describe how analyses of large numbers of influenza virus genomes are revealing the pathway traveled by the genes of this virus before it exploded in 1918. What emerges is a surprising tale with many players and plot lines, in which echoes of prior pandemics, imprinted in the immune responses of those alive in 1918, set the stage for the catastrophe. I will also discuss how resolving the mysteries of 1918 could help to prevent future pandemics and to control seasonal influenza, which quietly kills millions more every decade.",PT68M9S,2014-05-01,2014-05-01,147357,The University of Arizona,/channel/UCxtFtv498asEMr883r3o-Dg,UCxtFtv498asEMr883r3o-Dg,20,48Klc3DPdtk

What many people don't realize is that behind those power games are clashes of the way people see the world.  There are clashes of frames.  The people who can control these frames (like Tyrion Lannister and Tywin Lannister) tend to win over the Game of Thrones people who struggle more often (like Robb Stark).There are tons of ways you can use this understanding of frames in your normal life.  We'll look at three in this videoNote: the spoilers go up only through season 4, so if you haven't seen all the way to season 6, you are still good to watch1)  Breaking frames for persuasion (Tyrion vs. Shagga)2)  Frames in insults (Tyrion vs Robb Stark and Robb Stark vs. Jaime Lannister)3)  Frames to create options (Tyrion vs. Tywin and Tyrion vs. Lysa Arryn)Let me know how you feel about these fictional breakdowns!   I have never done one in the past and would love your feedback.  Especially let me know if you like Game of Thrones related breakdowns, because there is a lot more I could potentially cover (like Tyrion's charisma and persuasive abilities)Subscribe to Charisma On Command: http://bit.ly/subscribeCOCConnect With Us.Website: http://www.charismaoncommand.comFacebook: http://facebook.com/charismaoncommandPeriscope: @CharismaonOr if you want to see my personal stuff (my regular life + me playing music):Instagram: @CharlieHoupertPeriscope: @CharlieHoupert",PT11M3S,2016-04-04,2016-04-04,162342,Charisma on Command,/channel/UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,20,6NQiHtbpa8s
Life Inside the Bubble: Why Top-Ranked Secret Service Agent Dan Bongino Walked Away from It All,News & Politics,438613,"9,416",293,"Why would a successful, twelve-year Secret Service agent resign his position in the prime of his career to run for political office against all the odds? Why is it that the Washington DC ""Bubble"" -- a haze of lobbyists, cronies, staff, acolytes, consultants and bureaucrats surrounding those in power -- creates a ""bubble"" that distorts their view of the world and detaches them from the tragic results of poor policy choices? In ""Life Inside the Bubble"", Dan Bongino reflects upon his journey from the tough streets of New York City where he was raised, and later patrolled as a member of the NYPD, to the White House as a member of the elite Presidential Protective Division, through his ultimate decision to resign from the Secret Service in the prime of his career to run for the United States Senate. He provides a rare look inside ""the Bubble"" of our Nation's Capital and assesses why a government -- filled with some of the incredibly dedicated people he encountered while within it -- continues to make tragic mistakes.Still haven’t subscribed to The Heritage Foundation on YouTube?

Subscribe to our channel: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-ScreenrantCheck out PART 2 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yO2I...Movies are the most common pastime and form of entertainment. They take an incredible amount of time to make. From story developing, to casting talent and crew, to filming, and creating magic, and post production. It is all a work of art. But making audiences believe the world, especially the characters are real is a where the magic really happens. Especially with the actors. There have been some incredible performances throughout history. But what if we told you some of these performances were really being experienced and the actors weren’t acting? Today we will be discussing real moments where actors weren’t acting.Such as Drew Barrymore in E.T. She was told that E.T. was actually real. The first time she sees E.T. and freaks out is a very real moment as she had never seen the puppet before. Also, when she cries when E.T. dies is a real moment as she thought the alien was real.In Fight Club, Ed Norton’s character was told to hit Brad Pitt on the shoulder during their first fight. But was told last minute to hit him in the ear, unbeknownst to Brad. Which made his reaction very amusing and very real.One of the funniest scenes that really happened was the waxing scene in the 40 year old virgin. Steve Carrel’s screams and phrases are all genuine reactions to being waxed in real life.Our Social Media:https://twitter.com/screenranthttps://www.facebook.com/ScreenRanthttps://plus.google.com/+ScreenRantOur Websitehttp://screenrant.com/",PT12M22S,2017-11-25,2017-11-25,125276,Screen Rant,/channel/UC2iUwfYi_1FCGGqhOUNx-iA,UC2iUwfYi_1FCGGqhOUNx-iA,20,DGyARbGErus

It is a country caught between rich traditions and modernity.Wild equestrian games, fairytale palaces and hospitable people proud of their magnificent culture - all this will be encountered by those traveling through Uzbekistan on the Silk Road. The central Asian country borders Kazakhstan to the north and Afghanistan to the south. The journey begins in Samarkand, one of central Asia’s oldest cities.For centuries cities like Samarkand, Bukhara and Khiva provided the necessary infrastructure for the caravans on the Silk Road, allowing merchants to trade their goods and providing accommodation for them and their animals. Many buildings still survive to underline the splendor and wealth that trade once generated. In Samarkand, one of the world’s oldest cities, three outstanding Koran schools, known as madrasas, on Registan Square have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In the Boysun region in the Hissar Mountains the ancient, and none-too-gentle riding game known as Kopkari is held at Nowruz, the New Year festival. More than a hundred horsemen try to pick up the body of a dead goat from the ground and to escape with this from all the others. In 1380 the Uzbek folk hero Amir Timur (Tamerlane) had the gigantic Ak Sarav, the White Palace, built in Shahrisabz, the town of his birth. It had a thousand rooms adorned with gemstones._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

William Riley Gaul found guilty of killing cheerleader Emma Walker,Entertainment,273200,"1,300",58,"A former college football player has been jailed for life for murdering his 16-year-old cheerleader ex-girlfriend by shooting her through her bedroom wall while she was sleeping.William Riley Gaul, 19, was a wide receiver who had just finished his freshman season at Tennessee's Maryville College when he killed Emma Walker on November 21, 2016.During the trial, the court heard that in the run-up to the murder, Gaul pretended he had been kidnapped before stalking his victim's neighborhood and banging on her door. A jury of eight men and four women deliberated four hours before reaching its verdict. The teenager was immediately given a mandatory sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole for 51 years. Audible gasps could be heard from the gallery when the jury foreman pronounced him guilty. Gaul, who had been out on bond, was taken into custody. Relatives and friends of the former high school cheerleader later embraced outside the courtroom.'Today is about justice for Emma Walker and her family,' Knox County District Attorney Charme Allen said.Both sides agreed Gaul fired the shots from outside the Walker family's home in Knoxville. The debate was over his state of mind at the time.Prosecutors said Gaul intended to kill his ex-girlfriend in anger over the end of their two-year relationship. But defense lawyer Wesley Stone said Gaul never intended to harm Walker and should be convicted of the lesser charge of reckless homicide.Original Video: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/video/dail...DailyMailTV Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/DailyMailTV/DailyMailTV IG: https://www.instagram.com/DailyMailTVDailyMailTV Twitter: https://twitter.com/DailyMailTV",PT3M25S,2018-10-11,2018-10-11,141566,DailyMailTV,/channel/UCbqI6_GGn3Q6DbBQuFIJ3Og,UCbqI6_GGn3Q6DbBQuFIJ3Og,20,9M2Q_TLhwvk

Life in North Korea | DW Documentary,Education,5831508,"61,739","4,346","Are people in North Korea allowed to laugh, dance and marry? This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, it’s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts. --------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Can a married couple have all three? Perhaps it’s unrealistic since so many marriages end in divorce today. Why is that? One reason might be that a reported 20% of all marriages are sexless and that number is rising. Why have we lost the lust in our marriages? Is it technology, is it trust? More importantly, how can we “get back at it” in our marriages today?Maureen McGrath - nursetalk@hotmail.com - hosts the Sunday Night Sex Show on News Talk 980 CKNW.

"[Arirang Prime] The mysterious country of Bhutan, where earth meets sky (하늘과 맞닿은 신비의 나라, 부탄)",Nonprofits & Activism,637182,"4,399",189,"The mysterious country of Bhutan, where earth meets sky  Bhutan is a mysterious country surrounded by the Himalayas. The majority of its territory is covered with mountains reaching 2,000 meters in height. There are more monks than police troops in this Buddhist kingdom, which is the world's only country without traffic lights. Nor does it have fast food restaurants or foreign commercial advertisements. Everything believed to disrupt people's happiness is outlawed in Bhutan. And anyone can receive health care and education for free. More than 60 percent of the national territory is allocated to forests. Despite its poverty, Bhutan is a spiritually rich country that chooses slowness over growth.  Poor but happy In 1972, the Bhutanese king said he would focus not on promoting the country's gross domestic product, but its gross national happiness. While other countries pursue economic growth, Bhutan pursues happiness. Yangzom, who we met at the Wangchuk National Referral Hospital, brought her child to undergo health examinations. This woman can't afford healthcare costs because she makes a living selling goods at a market, but she doesn't look worried. Anyone in Bhutan can receive medical treatment free of charge. She says she is happy to live in this country. Bhutan provides free healthcare and education to its residents. Tshering Dorji attends the National Institute for Zorig Chusum, where he receives top-quality education because of his outstanding talent. Thanks to government subsidies, this young man from a small village can receive high-quality education free of charge. The government has also agreed to sponsor his studies abroad upon graduating. The Bhutanese government supports its talented people and presents all its residents with equal opportunities. One of the world's poorest countries, Bhutan has achieved what many industrialized countries have yet to. Happiness increased by sharingPassang Dem's family, from a small village of Mendi, prepares for an important occasion. Bhutanese households hold the religious ritual Puja three or four times a year when an important event takes place. One day before the ritual, Buddhist monks visit a family to make butter flowers to be offered to god. The ritual is accompanied by music while the monks pray for the family's happiness. After the ritual, all the neighbors have a meal together. Passang Dem's family is happy to receive many guests. Sharing is part of their everyday routine. Finding spiritual happinessThe Memorial Choeten Temple was built by the mother of Bhutan's third king. Wangchuk Dema spends his entire days spinning a hand-prayer wheel, which is believed to have an effect similar to reading scriptures. When spinning the heavy wheel, Wangchuk Dema thinks of everything good he has done during his life and prays that his life after death would be more beautiful. The Bhutanese say they are happy to follow god's will.Entrusting one's life to godThe Taktshang Goemba Temple is located 3,300 meters above sea level on a steep cliff. This sacred place is hard to reach, but it is a must-visit location for the Bhutanese. Lopen Dorji struggles to climb the steep cliff carrying a heavy bag. He is exhausted but joyful. His light steps show his secret to happiness.",PT51M31S,2014-02-09,2014-02-09,144767,ARIRANG TV,/channel/UC-PHIZjV-oX8H7zD1cCN2NQ,UC-PHIZjV-oX8H7zD1cCN2NQ,20,yZHPzeeq2K0

AD Harris/Murray/Peterson Discussion: London,Education,859895,"15,514",533,"This is the fourth video of the four-part debate that Sam Harris and I undertook in June 2018. Sam and I met twice in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with Bret Weinstein moderating, for a third time in Dublin, Ireland, and for a fourth and final time in London, England. Douglas Murray joined the debate with us for the latter two occasions.Video 1: Vancouver: https://bit.ly/2OlRZUaVideo 2: Vancouver: https://bit.ly/2CUQT0gVideo 3: https://bit.ly/2CUa0HGVideo 4: https://bit.ly/2On6Y0aSam is a well-known Enlightenment rationalist, and a prominent atheist – one of the “four horsemen,” along with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens (now unfortunately deceased) and Daniel Dennett. He believes (1) that our ethical systems should or even must be grounded in something other than arbitrary revelation or opinion; (2) that the world of facts can and should provide that grounding; and (3) that the grounding of values in fact can occur in the absence of much perceptual or cognitive intermediation. I agree with him with regard to point (1) but not point (2) and (3). I won’t present any of my argument here, however, because Sam isn’t here to respond, as he is in the videos. I have also written three blog posts on the Harris/Peterson discussions, here:1. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosoph...2. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosoph...3. TBAA note on the release of the videos, and their delay: Any event of this scale occurs because of the collaboration of many people, including, in this case. Travis Pangburn and his staff at Pangburn Philosophy, who organized and promoted the four-part debate series, and who incurred substantial financial and reputational risk in doing so (as nothing like this has been attempted before at this scale). None of us were sure at the outset whether Sam and I would manage a useful discussion, let alone four of them, or whether there would be a positive public response. In consequence, we didn’t spend much time before the debate series thinking about release (or formatting/editing) of video or audio recording. Since the events went well, however – appearing both productive and well-received publicly – we decided to move ahead with the production and release of the recordings. The team at Pangburn Philosophy completed the editing, in consequence. Sam and I agreed to allow the initial release behind Travis’s Patreon paywall, for a two-week period, after which we would post the videos for full public access on our respective video platforms, and release the audio in podcast form. The team at Pangburn Philosophy plans to use some substantial portion of what was raised through Patreon subscription for multi-language translation of their previously produced and future content (including these four debates).

The 10 BIGGEST Casino Scams EVER!!,Entertainment,859683,"4,651","1,108","The 10 BIGGEST Casino Scams EVER!! From card counting getting caught to stealing millions and getting away…stay tuned to number 1 to hear about the most insane casino heists ever performed!This top 10 brought to you by Zero2Hero!!Don't forget to subscribe here! https://goo.gl/NXuChuClick here to find out What are these MYSTERIOUS Creatures Found On Shore? https://youtu.be/evmjrL1pdUENumber 10: The Roselli Brothers.The advent of the Internet enabled some of the greatest things to ever exist, but it also made possible numerous scams and all kinds of thefts. One of such is the infamous Roselli Scam.In the time frame from 1995 to 2000, two online scam artists pulled off something insane. They called themselves the “Roselli Brothers” and, during those five years, they operated in casinos from Nevada, Puerto Rico and New Jersey. And they stole $37 million dollars from them. The Roselli brothers hired someone who was great with computer hacker and managed to obtain credit information for people with really good credit scores and, within just a couple of months, the Roselli Brothers were able to get credit lines from major casinos, and up the stakes. What happened next is like something from the “Ocean’s Eleven” franchise: by the year 2000, they were playing 100k-bets per hand. After cleaning the casinos out, the Rosellis disappeared. No one could find any trace that would lead to them. The FBI needed additional six month to realize what had happened – nobody had even known that the heist had even occurred! And needless to say, the name Roselli Brothers was just a backdrop, as the real Rosellis had died years ago. To this day, no one knows who the casino scammers were. Number 9: The Cigarette Scam.The previous entry was like something out of Ocean’s 11, but this one – this is straight James Bond material right here. And it involved a pack of cigarette – how fitting.Before we talk about this insane plot, though, take a moment to subscribe to our channel using the buttons below. While you’re there, be sure to like this video and click on that little notification bell, too. That way you’ll always know when we’ve posted new content.In 1973, at the Casino Deauville in France, a roulette scam took place, and it made the list of the smartest casino scams ever. The set-up is as follows: one of the casino’s dealers was also in charge of the radio signaling. He had come up with a radio transmitter that was a perfect fit for a pack of smokes. But that was just one piece of the puzzle; there was also a receiver, a weightless one, which the dealer had placed inside a roulette ball. Of course, it was the roulette ball from the table he was working at.The dealer’s brother-in-law played as an unknown casino visitor, and he placed bets at the table. The third member of the gang, the dealer’s sister, used the pack of cigarettes and pressed the transmitter button. Every time the button was pressed, the roulette ball would slide off from its spin and fall into a group of only six numbers that were possible per combination. The roulette ball was 90% accurate, and the team managed to rake in over $5 million in one week. They were eventually caught, not because their scam fell through, but because the dealer’s sister was so good-looking that she caught the attention of the casino staff. After realizing he was always at the table, they became suspicious… But the cigarette scam is still one of the biggest ever.Number 8: The Contact Lens Scam.Technology can really help you go a long way – especially if you’re creative. This scam took place in 2011, when a Frenchman, backed by three Italians, stole little over $80,000 from a casino in Cannes, using a really smart method. The game they played was stud poker; what the Frenchman would do is mark the card decks with special ink the normal eye cannot detect – and then the three Italians wore special kinds of contact lenses. These lenses could notice the marking made on the card decks.When two substantial winnings took place in the same casino, the staff members became very alert. Right away, they called the police. But once the police came, it took them quite some time to figure what had happened. It was pretty clear, right from the start, that invisible ink was involved, but the police couldn’t prove how the scammers were able to see the ink. After an in-depth investigation, they saw that each of the scammers had those contact lenses. In the end, the scammers all faced long jail sentences, but this has got to be one of the most creative casino scams ever. Number 7: The Edge Sorting Scam.Before we get into it, let’s first make sure you know what “edge sorting” really is. It’s a method of memorizing cards in a deck, and using them for running all kinds of shady plans. In order to do this, you have to be good with the cards; I mean, you have to have your “way” with them.",PT12M7S,2018-07-29,2018-07-29,147771,Zero2Hero,/channel/UCDITzjn4ox3WcEcYfg5wvLQ,UCDITzjn4ox3WcEcYfg5wvLQ,20,YT3E1cnLg2g

China's Unmarried 'Leftover' Women,Entertainment,2960003,"32,754","3,270","Since the socialist revolution, the rights of Chinese women have been written into the country's constitution. Under Mao, unprecedented numbers of women joined the workforce and they were celebrated as """"iron girls.""""But now, China is home to a fifth of the world’s women whose status as equals is dwindling. Domestic violence rates in the country have soared, marital rape is not considered a crime, those who dare to call themselves feminist activists are being detained by the government, and unmarried women older than 27 are commonly referred to as """"leftover women."""" To find out what lies behind the drastic shift in women’s social status in China, we track down feminist scholar and """"iron girl"""" Wang Zheng and spend a day with one of China’s so-called leftover women. We also explore the extremes of China's wedding industry and its defectors before meeting Wei Tingting, one of the five women's rights activists detained for trying to start a campaign against sexual harassment on public transportation.Click here to SUBSCRIBE to VICE Asia: https://bit.ly/2LhqAR9",PT31M57S,2018-10-05,2018-10-05,141735,VICE Asia,/channel/UC8ZyfGD_qP-v75DGCzYQw6g,UC8ZyfGD_qP-v75DGCzYQw6g,20,WBMcoJWo92Y

Child labor for shimmering cosmetics | DW Documentary,Education,119898,"1,835",52,"Mica is a natural mineral added to many cosmetics to make them shimmer. But mica has its dark side. The glamorous raw material is often sourced from illegal mines where child labor is rife.Ground into pigments, mica creates a fine shimmer. It is used in all kinds of makeup, such as foundation, face powder, lipstick and eye shadow. The glittery effect of mica creates glowing profits for the cosmetics industry. Suppliers and processors guarantee the highest standards regarding labor laws and environmental protection and are emphatic about their commitment to zero tolerance of child labor.  In this film, Brando Baranzelli follows the supply chain from India to Europe, from the illegal mines to the trade fairs of the cosmetics industry. In the Indian state of Jharkhand, he joins eight-year old mica collectors in the mines. He meets mine owners, intermediaries and exporters who all turn a blind eye to child labor, and reveals how dirty mica is washed clean on its way to Europe.--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

How to Fail at Almost Everything with Scott Adams,News & Politics,485047,"8,919",584,"Recorded on July 12, 2017The Dilbert comic strip artist and political philosopher Scott Adams sits down with Peter Robinson to discuss his book How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big. He discusses with Peter  his theory of “talent stacking,” the idea that rather than being an expert in one particular skill (i.e.,  Tiger Woods and golf), one can become successful by stacking a variety of complementary nonexpert skills. Adams demonstrates how talent stacking has been beneficial in his life because he has stacked  comic artist skills with his MBA and experience in corporate environments to create a wildly successful comic strip that resulted in spin-off books, a television series, a video game, and merchandise. His business skills gave him the tools to create a business satire comic strip and the skill set to manage the business that evolved from that  strip.  Adams also discusses how he uses his Dilbert blog to discuss his political philosophies and observations about the Trump administration. He wrote blogposts about the 2016 election and predicted that Donald Trump would win based on President Trump’s talent stack as a media mogul and businessman who had spent significant time in the public eye so  was immune to scandals and thick-skinned enough to handle what the media and other politicians would throw at him. Adams argues that President Trump is one of the best branders, influencers, and persuaders  he has ever seen, in that the president uses persuasive techniques in debates and on social media as a way to get people to do what he wants. Adams contends that President Trump’s persuasive techniques will help solve the problem of North Korea because he has already set up China to get involved by intimating that it tried and  failed. Adams believes this will cause China to get involved  to save face. Scott Adams and Peter Robinson finish by chatting about Adams’s views on the story arc of life. Adams says that  he believes he started intentionally selfish so that by the end of his life he can give away all of his wealth, knowledge, and wisdom, a process he says he has already begun. They also briefly discuss his new book, Win Bigly, about the persuasive strategies of Donald Trump. Scott Adams is releasing his new book, Win Bigly, in October 2017.For the full transcript go tohttp://www.hoover.org/research/how-fa...Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?

Ridiculous Jobs Queen Elizabeth Actually Has Her Staff Do,Entertainment,229366,"2,500",184,"Queen Elizabeth II employs an astonishing 1,200 people just to keep the Royal Household running. The positions held by her staffers vary from cooks to chauffeurs, but as it turns out, quite a few people on the payroll are doing jobs that seem, well, delightfully bizarre.The Master of the Horse position goes way back to the year 1340, according to Horse & Hound. While this position would have been of importance in centuries past, today the job is an honorary one. The outlet explained,""The Master is no longer involved with the day-to-day running of [the royal stables] but still makes inspections and rides in ceremonial uniform at state occasions.""In 1999, the queen appointed Lord Sam Vestey, former chairman of Cheltenham racecourse in Gloucestershire, as the new Master of the Horse. He is the ""senior officer"" in charge of the royal stables as well as the horses and carriages belonging to the queen. The Telegraph reported,""In his role he attends important ceremonial occasions when the sovereign rides on horseback or travels in horse-drawn carriage, such as at Trooping the Colour and the state opening of Parliament.""

Homeless Man Lost Millions Now Lives in a Oakland Tent City,Nonprofits & Activism,1515694,"28,085",710,"Derrick is a survivor. After losing millions of dollars in the Great Recession of 2008, Derrick's life then snowballed to living in a tent homeless in Oakland, California.  Over time, other homeless people started camping around Derrick, and a small homeless encampment grew into a tent city. I featured the tent community here: https://youtu.be/ftMifFpUWCQ In this video, Derrick shares a little more about his background and how the tent encampment started. The good news is in the time since I recorded this interview,  Derrick qualified for a new program funded by Kaiser Permanente. Any day now he'll be moving into housing. A few weeks back, gangs broke into Derricks tent, and he lost everything again.

Most people blame homelessness on the person experiencing it instead of the increasing shortage of affordable housing, lack of employment, a living wage or the countless reasons that put a person at risk.  This lack of understanding creates a dangerous cycle of misperception that leads to the inability to effectively address the root causes of homelessness. We imagine a world where everyone has a place to call home. Each day, we work to fight homelessness by giving it a face while educating individuals about the systemic issues that contribute to its existence. Through storytelling, education, news, and activism, we are changing the narrative on homelessness.This isn’t just talk. Each year, our groundbreaking educational content reaches more than a billion people across the globe. Our real and unfiltered stories of homelessness shatter stereotypes, demand attention and deliver a call-to-action that is being answered by governments, major brands, nonprofit organizations, and everyday citizens just like you. However, there is more work to be done on the road ahead. Homelessness is undoubtedly one of our biggest societal issues today and will only continue to grow if we don’t take action now.Invisible People is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to educating the public about homelessness through innovative storytelling, news, and advocacy. Since our launch in 2008, Invisible People has become a pioneer and trusted resource for inspiring action and raising awareness in support of advocacy, policy change and thoughtful dialogue around poverty in North America and the United Kingdom.#homeless #tentcity #oakland",PT20M41S,2019-09-21,2019-09-21,121523,Invisible People,/channel/UCh4pyZUB0mNzieaKv831flA,UCh4pyZUB0mNzieaKv831flA,20,XZComkkxeEI

Inside Wolf Creek actor's horror rape trial | 60 Minutes Australia,Entertainment,803200,"5,217",445,"On-screen psychopaths don’t get any more menacing or memorable than Jarratt’s Mick Taylor in “Wolf Creek”. But in 2017, at the height of his success, the veteran actor received a surprising – and unwelcome – blast from the past. A woman he’d known decades before, someone he thought of then as a friend, suddenly claimed he was a monster in real life. She said one night back in 1976, Jarratt raped her. With that damning allegation his career and reputation instantly disintegrated. Jarratt vehemently denied the accusation but was charged by police. His life went on hold as he waited for the case to be heard in court and his fate determined by the deliberations of a jury. But while he contemplated the possibility of a very bleak future, Jarratt made an incredible decision. He agreed to let 60 MINUTES record every moment of the fight to clear his name. For this extraordinarily revealing story, reporter Tara Brown spent months with John Jarratt, his family and legal team, in the lead-up to and during the most tumultuous time of his life.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

The Russians – an intimate journey through Russia (2/2) | DW Documentary,Education,27897,670,22,"A very private trip through Russia - a world power with a shrinking population, a myriad of ethnic minorities, and vast distances.Encounters with Russians from six different generations help us get to know a Russia beyond Moscow and the Kremlin. They tell us of a nation poised between tradition and the future. Filmmaker Juri Rescheto travelled through the giant country, meeting with ordinary Russians who share their everyday lives with him. They talk about their joys and sorrows, their hopes and needs, and their experiences - good and bad. The film shows intimate scenes from their homes and their workplaces, as well as glimpses of their political views, their standards of living, and their customs. The protagonists’ personal situations are presented in relation to official Russian studies on the particular generation to which they belong.  In Part 1 we go to a city halfway between Moscow and Novosibirsk to meet Jelena, who works as a surrogate mother in a children’s home. Then we travel to the boreal forest in western Siberia to meet 16-year-old Veronika, who spends most of the year in a boarding school. Her parents are reindeer herders and members of the indigenous Khanty people. The generation of young adults in Russia is represented by Kirill, who holds down a normal job, but spends his free time practicing a dangerous hobby: no holds barred boxing.In Part 2 of the documentary we meet Dmitri, who lives in northwestern Russia and works at Europe’s largest blast furnace. He is a proud steelworker and admires Vladimir Putin. At Lake Baikal, Baba Lyuba tells us many stories about her legendary region and her own eventful life. Finally, we make the acquaintance of Ivan, who earns a livelihood from death as an engraver of tombstones at a gigantic cemetery in central Russia.Watch Part 1 here: https://youtu.be/qfuDZEQjro8Get to know the Russians a little better in our 6-part YouTube special:Part 1: Birth - https://youtu.be/3cO58tL1CUwPart 2: Childhood - https://youtu.be/4IG4eVdhbxIPart 3: Youth - https://youtu.be/sRIiTk1nR78Part 4: Adulthood - https://youtu.be/he8FGw9e-pcPart 5: Old age - https://youtu.be/SAnWF6yTaWQPart 6: Death - https://youtu.be/bQN420LIwrc-------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

"Policing in America needs to change. Trust me, I’m a cop: Renee Mitchell at TEDxOxbridge",Nonprofits & Activism,186986,"4,288",153,"Policing has become a conveyor belt of criminal apprehension feeding the criminal justice system so that statistics for arrest and prosecution remain high. It is time for policing to return to Peel's original vision of policing and for police to deter crime and disorder while maintaining community relations. Sergeant Renée Mitchell is a longtime public servant at the Sacramento Police Department since just before the turn of the century. She holds a Bachelor of Science in Psychology from the University of California, Davis, a Master of Arts in Counseling Psychology from the University of San Francisco, a Master of Business Administration from the California State University, Sacramento and a Juris Doctorate from the University of the Pacific, McGeorge School of Law. She was a 2009/2010 Fulbright Police Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge. Currently, she is a Jerry Lee Scholar at the Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge and a Police Fellow with Police Foundation.This talk was part of the ""Defining Today"" session at TEDxOxbridge ""Timeless Ideas"" in Oxford, England at the Said Business School on June 1, 2013.

58 Years Of Mars Exploration In 14 Minutes,Science & Technology,150691,"4,284",141,"Hello, welcome to NeoScribe. As far back as the 2nd millennium BC, Ancient astronomers identified 5 celestial objects moving differently than the backdrop of stars. The Greeks called them “planetes” meaning wanderers and many ancient civilizations would go on to worship them as deities.With its abundant iron oxide dispersed on its surface, giving it a reddish appearance, the Romans worshiped Mars as the God of War.Over time, mystical worship shifted to fantastical speculation, of intelligent life on Mars.In 1877, Italian Astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli observed a network of linear structures on the surface of Mars leading to a surge of speculation of the possibility of intelligent life on the Planet.The idea of an Advanced Martian civilization was widely covered by newspapers and magazine along with many science fiction novels, capturing the imagination of the public, right up to the Space Age and the first missions to Mars. Between October 1960 and November 1962, the Soviet Union launched 5 missions to Mars. Each one failed. NASA continued the streak of misfortune in 1964, with the failure of Mariner 3.Three weeks later, NASA launched the Mariner 4 spacecraft, becoming the first successful mission to Mars. Mariner 4 was a flyby mission, and reached Mars on July 14th and 15th 1965, marking an incredible and historic moment. Equipped with a Telescope, Mariner 4 took 22 close-up images of Mars. These were the first images ever captured and returned to Earth from deep space. Mariner 4 transmitted measurements of Mars’s atmosphere which turned out to be much thinner than expected. Additionally, it did not detect a magnetic field, radiation belts or surface water. These findings dashed hopes of discovering intelligent life on Mars. Just two days after Mariner 4 was launched, the Soviet Union Launched the Zond 2 spacecraft but they lost communications with it, making it 6 failed Mars missions in a row for the country.Then  NASA went back to Mars with Mariner 6 & 7, launched in February and March 1969. 6 &7 were both sent on flyby missions and were both successful.The spacecraft uncovered that the Mars atmosphere is comprised of mostly carbon dioxide. They also were able to transmit 201 images back to Earth, covering around 20% of the surface. The images did not reveal any of the canals mistakenly observed by late 19th century astronomers, another letdown for Intelligent Life hopefuls.  However, Mariner 6 & 7 detected trace amounts water on the surface of Mars, providing some hope to finding life on Mars. Back to the Soviet Union, it launched The Mars 2M No. 522 in 1969 and the Kosmos 419 in 1971.Both missions failed, extending their streak 9 unsuccessful mission. And then FINALLY, in May 1971, the Soviet Union launched the twin space probes Mars 2 and 3. The Probes were identical, each consisting of an orbiter and a lander. Both orbiters were successful, transmitting a total of 60 images, discovering mountains as high 22 km and revealing surface temperatures between -110 and 13° C. And the orbiters likely remain in Mars Orbit to this day…The Mars 2 & 3 landers are the other hand did not fare so well. The Mars 2 Lander’s descent system malfunctioned and the parachute did not deploy causing it to crash. And then Mars 3 lander successfully landed, however communications failed after 14 seconds. Meanwhile, back at NASA, they launched two orbiters, Mariner 8 & 9 also in May 1971.Mariner 8 failed, but Mariner 9 was highly successful.Despite launching 11 days after the Soviet’s Mars 2 & 3, Mariner 9 beat the others to Mars becoming the first spacecraft to orbit another planet. When Mariner 9 arrived at Mars it found the surface completely covered by a planet-wide dust storm and scientist had to delay imaging for months until the storm settled. Mariner 9 was able to transmit over 7,000 images, covering 85% of Mars' surface.The images revealed river beds, vast canyon systems over 4,000 km long, along with massive extinct volcanoes including Olympus Mons, the largest known volcano in the Solar System.1973 was a busy year for the Soviet Union, which launched Mars 4, 5, 6 & 7. All four missions failed for the most part, except Mars 5 manage to transmit 180 images before it was disabled likely from a micrometeoroid. At this point, the Soviet Union had only 2 successful missions out of 18, and it wouldn’t attempt another mission to Mars for 15 years…",PT14M8S,2019-01-02,2019-01-02,126514,NeoScribe,/channel/UCvPBwFtlth679NMXM2jsxlg,UCvPBwFtlth679NMXM2jsxlg,20,wF1d75oY4Mw

How China is creating the world’s largest prison | Four Corners,News & Politics,963912,"10,295","1,333","Tell the World: Exposing how China is creating the world’s largest prison.Four Corners uncovers disturbing evidence of how China is effectively operating the world’s largest prison. It’s a remote corner of the world, but what is taking place in China’s Xinjiang province is nothing short of breathtaking. Today its Uyghur population is being systematically rounded up and detained, with estimates of as many as a million citizens being held in re-education camps.Even those still left in their homes are being monitored. The communist regime is using cutting edge technology, mass surveillance tools and artificial intelligence to control an entire population.By piecing together witness accounts from Australian citizens caught up in the Chinese Government’s campaign, along with satellite imagery analysis and official documents uncovered online, the truth about what is occurring in Xinjiang is laid bare.We have uncovered evidence of detainees being forced to work in factories with implications for Australian companies doing business in the region.We also reveal concerning evidence about Australia’s links to China’s dystopian surveillance state and the tools used to racially profile its own citizens.The events unfolding in China are creating heartbreak for Uyghurs in Australia.They have stayed quiet for fear of provoking the authorities into punishing their relatives. Now, in desperation they are breaking their silence to tell the world what is going on.---------------------Watch more Four Corners investigations here: https://bit.ly/2JbpMkf You can also like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/abc4corners/ Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/4corners And sign up to our newsletter: https://www.abc.net.au/4corners/newsl...---------------------This program features contributions from:Nurmuhammad Majid, East Turkistan Australian AssociationAdam TuranSadam AbudusalamuNurgul Sawut, Australian Uyghur AssociationProf James Leibold, ethnic policy in China, La Trobe UniversityDr Darren Byler, anthropologist, University of WashingtonAlmas NizamidinNathan Ruser, Satellite analyst, Australian Strategic Policy InstituteDr Adrian Zenz, Independent researcherHayrullah MaiGulnur IdreisCheng Jingye, China's Ambassador to Australia",PT45M19S,2019-07-15,2019-07-15,146265,ABC News In-depth,/channel/UCxcrzzhQDj5zKJbXfIscCtg,UCxcrzzhQDj5zKJbXfIscCtg,20,t-axd1Ht_J8

But they no longer fit the dazzling image President Xi Jinping wants for Beijing. His dream is a showpiece capital, befitting China's ambitions as a world superpower.Beijing is fine-tuning its five-year plan: to reduce the city's population by 15 percent by 2020, and they are pursuing this goal with unrelenting ruthlessness.To help transform this megacity, the capital has launched a campaign to get rid of its poorest residents. Entire neighbourhoods are being bulldozed, with residents often only given a few days to pack up their belongings and find new homes.Xin Jie is one of them. She was forced to abandon her grocery shop and relocate to a small hut. Now, she's being forced to move again. With nowhere to take her goods, she says she has no option but to sell them off cheaply. ""What President Xi Jinping said on television sounded really good ... Reforms and opening up the country,"" she says. ""Now, see what's happened? We're no longer allowed to remain in Beijing. I have to find another city, maybe Shanghai or Guangzhou. We can't stay in Beijing any more.

How I Made My Own iPhone - in China,Science & Technology,23776689,"492,923","19,595","I built a like-new(but really refurbished) iPhone 6S 16GB entirely from parts I bought in the public cell phone parts markets in Huaqiangbei.  And it works!How much did it cost? Answer here: https://youtu.be/-KucQDXnKwsI've been fascinated by the cell phone parts markets in Shenzhen, China for a while.  I'd walked through them a bunch of times, but I still didn't understand basic things, like how they were organized or who was buying all these parts and what they were doing with them.So when someone mentioned they wondered if you could build a working smartphone from parts in the markets, I jumped at the chance to really dive in and understand how everything works.  Well, I sat on it for nine months, and then I dove in.More details at: https://strangeparts.com/how-i-made-m...My Gear:I shot it on this camera: http://amzn.to/2B0SnkeAnd also with this: http://amzn.to/2BhdF1eAnd recorded sound on this: http://amzn.to/2CFuyPvCollaborative editing software: http://bit.ly/frameio-spFacebook: http://facebook.com/strangepartscomTwitter: http://twitter.com/strangepartscomInstagram: http://instagram.com/strangeparts_comEmail Newsletter: http://strangeparts.com/Special thanks to everyone that helped:Ian Lesnet (dangerousprototypes.com), Jin Lin (dangerousprototypes.com and flylin.co),  Helen, Frank, David, Wyman from G-Lon Cell Phone Repair School (facebook.com/wyman.liu.1), Charles Pax (paxinstruments.com), Patrick O'Doherty, Matt Turzo, Richard Littauer, the EFF, Bunnie Huang (bunniestudios.com), Sean Cross (xobs.io), all the rest of my friends in China that have been supportive, and most importantly all the Huaqiangbei market sellers that were so generous with their time and advice!#StrangeParts #PhoneAdventures #China",PT23M49S,2017-04-12,2017-04-12,147347,Strange Parts,/channel/UCO8DQrSp5yEP937qNqTooOw,UCO8DQrSp5yEP937qNqTooOw,20,leFuF-zoVzA

The 13 Year Stomach Ache: Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor | Medical Documentary | Reel Truth,People & Blogs,41785,423,16,"Sixteen-year-old Jennifer Fagenson comes down with altitude sickness and takes aspirin to help relieve it, but unfortunately, this lands her in the hospital.

At the time, he wasn’t shy to talk about his family life through his rap lyrics. But, as time went on and his fame grew and grew, he kept his private life just that: private. Because of this, we had little to no knowledge about his daughter, and sometimes studio collaborator, Hailie Jade was doing. That’s why when photos of the rapper’s daughter went viral, no one could believe how grown up she had become. Today, we are looking into the private life of Eminem’s daughter, and we will sound off on her budding career as an Instagram star. We will also reveal what her family life is like these days with her mom, Kim, and her two sisters you may not even know about!

Australia's most sadistic killer | 60 Minutes Australia,Entertainment,1024449,"6,407",533,"On 60 MINUTES, Sarah Abo reveals the incredible account of a police investigation like no other – how detectives solved an horrific double murder they didn’t even know about. It began with the discovery of a woman’s bones in bushland south of Sydney. But police had no idea who the victim was, and despite their substantial efforts, for five years she remained unidentified. Then came another chance discovery – seemingly unrelated – a thousand kilometres away in outback South Australia. In a suitcase lying by the side of a remote highway, a passing motorist found more bones, this time of an infant girl. But again, police were clueless about her identity. It took even more coincidence before the crimes were connected and a tragic breakthrough was uncovered. As it turns out, the two victims were a mother and daughter, murdered by one of the most evil monsters Australia has known.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

What Representing Men in Divorce Taught Me About Fatherhood | Marilyn York | TEDxUniversityofNevada,Nonprofits & Activism,2942077,"101,213","3,550","Attorney Marilyn York owns a Men’s Rights Family Law Firm in Reno Nevada, established in 2001. She and her ten female employees focus on representing men for two reasons: 1. As her talk explains, fathers are crucial in the upbringing and development of their children; and 2. Fathers are the disadvantaged parent in family court and society and while the laws are improving, the statistics are not. There are currently more than 17,000,000 children growing up in America without their fathers and every year this number is growing. According to the Center for Disease Control, children from fatherless homes account for 90% of homeless and runaway children; 71% of high school dropouts and 63% of youth suicides. Listen to this talk to find out how you can help America's 17,000,000 fatherless children avoid these fates!  Marilyn D. York is a Men's Rights Divorce Attorney, licensed in California since 1998 and Nevada since 1999, where she is a Certified Family Law Specialist. Since 2001, Marilyn has owned her law firm in Reno, Nevada, where she and her 9 female employees specifically represent men in divorce and family law battles. Marilyn chose her career because of her passion for children and relationships but most of all, Marilyn is driven to help underdogs. While the laws are improving for men, not all laws are yet gender equal and the interpretation and enforcement of those that are, have a long way to go. Despite her focus on representing men, Marilyn has a deep compassion for women in need as well. It isn't lost on Marilyn that women remain disadvantaged outside Family Court. She serves that need as Board President for a local housing program for homeless young women, Nevada Youth Empowerment Project, or NYEP. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

Is Taiwan a country... or part of China?,Education,2672813,"41,287","2,249","A look at the complex political situation on the island of Taiwan. The island of Taiwan is administered by the Republic of China, which lost the Chinese Civil War to the Communists which control the mainland to this day, proclaiming the People's Republic of China in 1949. Both the ROC and the PRC claim to be the legitimate government of China. Taiwan is a de facto independent country but is not a member of the United Nations since being replaced in 1971 by the PRC. The current situation is stuck in a stalemate with the two ways of resolving the dispute (unification and independence) both seeming very unlikely to happen any time soon.

What is the human cost to China's economic miracle? | Head to Head,News & Politics,1402932,"14,265","1,683","In this episode of Head to Head, Mehdi Hasan challenges Charles Liu, Senior Fellow at Peking University, seasoned Chinese entrepreneur and informal adviser to the Chinese government, on Xi Jinping’s record in power so far, the government’s crackdown on the Uighur Muslim minority, and what role for China if it becomes the 21st century’s military and economic superpower.With the presidential term limit abolished in 2018, critics say that Chinese President Xi Jinping appears to be paving the way to being able to stay in power for life, but Charles Liu, founder of Hao Capital, disputes this. Separately, despite lower-than-predicted growth, China is still growing substantially and is set to become the world’s biggest economy.But the economic boom has been paired with an increase in state surveillance and crackdowns on dissent, as well as the repression of the Muslim Uighur minority. So at what cost has China’s economic miracle come? And what’s the future for civil liberties of the Chinese people?In recent years China has also increased its military spending while some Chinese officials have been ratcheting up their militaristic rhetoric, raising fears of direct military confrontation with the United States.On this Head to Head episode filmed at the Oxford Union, we challenge Charles Liu on all these topics, ask him whether the Chinese economy has hit a wall, and whether China’s neighbours should dismiss their fears as his country builds up its military and extends its global reach.We are joined by a panel of three experts:Andreas Fulda - China Specialist at Asia Research Institute and Assistant Professor at the School of Politics and International Relations, University of Nottingham.  Victor Gao - Vice President of the Beijing based Center for China and Globalization and former interpreter for the late President Deng Xiaoping.Steve Tsang - Professor and Director of the China Institute at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) University of London.Follow us on Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/AJHeadToHead) and Twitter (https://twitter.com/AJHeadtoHead).Watch previous Head to Head episodes here: https://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/...

The Russian Revolution 1917,Education,1831148,"24,964",964,"Everything you need to know about the Russian Revolution in a 13 min video. Produced in partnership with Bridgeman Images http://www.bridgemanimages.com/en-GB/We explain all the major events of Russia's TWO revolutions of 1917– the February Revolution that ended Tsarist rule in Russia, and the October Revolution, that brought the Bolsheviks to power. We explain the causes of Tsar Nicholas II's growing unpopularity - the role of the mysterious Siberian mystic Rasputin, Russia's disastrous involvement in World War One, and the events on the streets of Petrograd that led to the Tsar's abdication. That summer Russia lurched from crisis to crisis, with a Provisional Government that faced riots (the July Days), military revolt (the Kornilov Affair), economic chaos, and constantly dwindling support. Socialist Prime Minister Alexander Kerensky, once hailed as Russia's great hope, was unable to restore order, or, in October, prevent the Bolsheviks from launching a coup, organised by Leon Trotsky and led by Vladimir Lenin, that overthrow the Provisional Government and brought the Bolsheviks to power. A brutal civil war followed, leading to the death of more than 10 million Russians – amongst them Tsar Nicholas II and his family, executed by Bolsheviks at Yekaterinburg in July 1918. From the wreckage emerged the Soviet Union, formed in 1922, and destined to be one of the 20th century's two superpowers.

Two Costo executives pleaded guilty to professional misconduct in front of the Ontario College of Pharmacists and the company says it suspended the practices upon conclusion of its own internal investigation. Costco says it didn’t use the funds to “line our pockets” but on the contrary the payments “are used to defray our operating costs to allow us to pass the savings on to our customers.” Hear the secret audio tapes for the first time and meet the man who blew the whistle.

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.

This Japanese Family of 3 with Japanese husband shows how life in Tokyo is like for a new Japanese mother raising a Japanese baby.  We follow Moe, 27 year old Japanese mother of Sutan, a 9-month old Japanese infant, from morning until evening to show what type of activities a Japanese mom has during the day.  Inside of their Japanese home in Tokyo, we can see what type of Japanese house chores she performs, what type of Japanese food she cooks and how she takes care of her Japanese daughter.  This probably would not be considered an average Japanese family but many of their activities are that of a typical Japanese family.  This day in the life of Japanese housewife and Japanese baby will feature the joys and struggles a mom has raising a Japanese baby for the first time.  Life in Japan starts here as baby and you can see how certain behaviors are taught to babies like saying itadakimasu before the baby eats.

For whatever reason, this meat-head of a cop either didn't like the color of Dan's Huracan, or just had a bone to pick because he just decided to STAND IN FRONT OF HIS LAMBORGHINI AND NOT LET HIM LEAVE.We also looked up the law the cop was talking about. It actually ISN'T required to have a legal document showing insurance. A phone document will suffice. The big thing here was PA doesn't issue that document.

North Korea - All the dictator's men | DW Documentary,Education,6021902,"41,655","3,351","North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world, but its leader Kim Jong Un has still found the money he needs to finance a nuclear weapons program, despite the country's fundamental poverty and international economic sanctions. This documentary looks at how, and introduces the men who have helped Kim Jong Un keep his dreams of reaching nuclear power status alive. North Korea has not reined in its nuclear program, despite a number of UN resolutions that have tried to force it to do so. So how has the isolated country kept the program going despite sanctions? Every year Pyongyang sends millions of North Korean workers abroad, selling their services to over 40 countries around the world. And their salaries flow directly into Kim’s treasury. The only ones who know exactly how the system works are the men who have helped the North Korean government carry through the program for years. A film team spent years researching these men and their secrets - from bankers and diplomats to the laborers and specialists who worked abroad and whose wages flowed into the regime's coffers. Come and meet all the dictator’s men.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

But the journalist Luca Faccio managed to visit Kim Jong Un's regime.Anyone venturing behind the world’s last Iron Curtain into North Korea will experience a very different country to the one we know only through the usual images of rocket launches and mass rallies. The country is ruled by the dictator Kim Jong Un, whom the people worship - or are made to worship - as a god-like father figure. Little is known about daily life in North Korea, because all images that reach the outside world have been censored by the government. Visitors rarely see evidence of oppression, enforced conformity and starvation in the rural population. Still, journalist Luca Faccio is able to offer some interesting insights into the isolated country - although, of course, government watchdogs are on his heels everywhere he goes._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Oil and ruin — exodus from Venezuela | DW Documentary,Education,561217,"3,974",327,"Venezuela is experiencing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis. Hunger is widespread and there is a severe shortage of medicines. The UN estimates that more than four million people have now fled what was once South America’s richest nation.Venezuela is in the grips of what is now the world’s second largest refugee crisis after Syria. But unlike Syria, Venezuela is not mired in civil war, and the country is sitting on the world’s largest proven oil reserves. How could such a rich nation be driven into ruin? Where has the country’s wealth gone, and why are its people starving? Corruption and mismanagement are driving displacement worldwide. The majority of the world’s refugees and migrants are fleeing from countries in the top 10 of Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index - places like Afghanistan, Syria, South Sudan and Somalia. Venezuela was once one of the world’s wealthiest countries and a showcase of democracy. The country enjoys an abundance of natural resources, including oil, gold, diamonds and coltan. But rather than invest in its people and economy, this wealth has been squandered. Today Venezuela is mired in corruption, and deindustrialization, debt, political conflict, authoritarianism and poverty are the order of the day. The billions in profits generated by the oil business during the boom years between 2003 and 2014 have largely ended up in private pockets. And once oil prices collapsed in 2014, Venezuela was plunged into economic crisis. Nicolás Maduro, who rose to the presidency after Hugo Chávez died in 2013, has installed loyal military officers in key economic positions. Venezuela is now little more than a state-run criminal enterprise. At the same time, the country has become a pawn in a geopolitical contest over power and natural resources, with the US, Russia and China all looking to assert their own interests. Every two seconds, a person is forced to flee their home. Today, more than 70 million people have been displaced worldwide. The DW documentary series ‘Displaced’ sheds light on the causes of this crisis and traces how wealthy industrialized countries are contributing to the exodus from the Global South.Tomatoes and greed – the exodus of Ghana's farmers: https://youtu.be/rlPZ0Bev99sDrought and floods — the climate exodus: https://youtu.be/PjyX5dnhaMw--------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Officer Pulls Gun on Student Picking Up Trash Outside of Dorm Building | NowThis,News & Politics,13224663,"298,940","21,827","This cop pulled his gun on a student who was picking up trash in front of his dorm.» Subscribe to NowThis: http://go.nowth.is/News_SubscribeZayd Atkinson, a student at Naropa University, was confronted by an officer while picking up trash for his work-study job outside of his dorm. The officer did not have reasonable suspicion that a crime was occurring and was not entitled to demand Atkinson's date of birth, according to an independent review by a former U.S. Attorney.Research shows Black people are often exposed to heightened scrutiny and suspicion, which can begin early in childhood. 54% of Black Americans say they felt others 'have been suspicious of them because of the color of their skin,' compared to 6% of white Americans.Several officers, some with guns drawn, surrounded Atkinson. A college faculty member later appeared to back up Atkinson. The police officers never asked the faculty member, a white man, to confirm his identity or prove that he worked for the college.After almost 15 minutes, the officer gave Atkinson back his ID and left. The officer resigned two weeks after the incident but will remain on the city payroll until February 2020. An internal investigation found the officer violated 2 department policies but did not conclude he was racially biased.Connect with NowThis» Like us on Facebook: http://go.nowth.is/News_Facebook» Tweet us on Twitter: http://go.nowth.is/News_Twitter» Follow us on Instagram: http://go.nowth.is/News_Instagram» Find us on Snapchat Discover: http://go.nowth.is/News_SnapchatNowThis is your premier news outlet providing you with all the videos you need to stay up to date on all the latest in trending news.

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time.

He also makes a powerful case that we’re on the way back to ‘patrimonial capitalism,’ in which the commanding heights of the economy are dominated not just by wealth, but also by inherited wealth, in which birth matters more than effort and talent,” wrote Paul Krugman in The New York Times.

Can You Tell Them Apart? UK’s Only Identical Quadruplets | Four of a Kind,People & Blogs,3429550,"45,694",947,"SUBSCRIBE to Origin: https://tinyurl.com/y8v4u288Have you ever had to write your child’s initials on them to remember which one was which? The Carles’ household is home to four girls who are 4 of a kind but who also beat the odds of 64 million to one to survive. Ellie, Georgina, Jessica and Holly are Britain’s only identical quadruplets and their mum Julie was only the 27th woman in the world to conceive monochorionic quads naturally. The girls are so alike that for the first year Julie and her husband Jose had to write the babies’ initials on their feet in permanent marker to tell them apart, and Jose sometimes still struggles to know who is who… it probably doesn’t help that Mum dresses them all the same.Until now, the girls didn’t have much contact with life outside of their family. They are all each other’s best friends and work like a little mischief making machine, an inseparable unit working as one. But that’s all about to change as the girls start their first year of primary school. This documentary will follow their journey during their first year at school as they cause a lot of confusion and sometimes hostility wherever they go. With identical strawberry blonde corkscrew curls, the same faces and heights – they are impossible to tell apart and people often stare and ask some quite blunt questions about what it’s like to bring up four of a kind. This documentary will aim to answer these questions and also give insight into the uniqueness of identical quadruples. How identical are they really?#Monochorionic #QuadrupletsContent licensed from All3Media.

A woman whose terrify deeds have destroyed many lives. For years, Anne Hamilton-Byrne ran a bizarre cult known as The Family. But this was no ordinary family. Children stolen at birth, brainwashed, beaten, even given mind altering drugs like LSD. The list of abuses as her isolated retreat outside Melbourne goes on. It was a true house of horrors. Throughout it all Hamilton-Byrne was helped by a group of unquestioning followers, including a sinister group of women known as ‘The Aunties’. To these disciples, she was the reincarnation as Jesus Christ. Her word, gospel. Hamilton-Byrne spent years dodging the truth about what went on inside The Family. But in 2009, for the first time, she spoke to 60 Minutes.WATCH more of 60 Minutes Australia: https://www.60minutes.com.au LIKE 60 Minutes Australia on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/60Minutes9 FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Twitter: https://twitter.com/60Mins FOLLOW 60 Minutes Australia on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/60minutes9For forty years, 60 Minutes have been telling Australians the world’s greatest stories.

The Unusual Earth Orbit Circling Above Our Ancient Past | Roger G. Gilbertson | TEDxColoradoSprings,Nonprofits & Activism,502317,"11,230",493,"NOTE FROM TED: We've flagged this talk, which was filmed at a TEDx event, because it appears to fall outside the TEDx content guidelines. Claims made in this talk only represent the speaker’s personal views which are not corroborated by scientific evidence. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/t...When does our future meet our past? How does our scientific knowledge grow and change? A newly recognized type of Earth orbit can travel directly above a great circle formed by some of the oldest and most distinctive ancient human constructions on the surface of the Earth: the Giza pyramids, Machu Picchu, Easter Island, Angkor Wat, Mohenjo-Daro, and many others. But is there any connection to all this? What do we need to learn - scientifically - to gain a greater understanding of the links between these sites, and the great changes that happened on our planet 12,800 years ago. Follow the adventures of a science writer and skeptic as he explores extraordinary coincidences, connections, and the evidence linking our modern world to our mysterious past. I like to make up stuff – stories, inventions, visual and auditory experiences. But when it comes to understanding the “real world” I want facts, and the scientific method provides our best way of finding them, and of making sure we are not misled by fantasies, fallacies, or frauds.Ever since I first learned about Stonehenge when I was very young, I’ve been fascinated by the mysteries of our ancient human past, and the many unanswered questions. Our scientific toolkit lets us push back the unknown to gain a clearer understanding of where we came from, who we are, and in turn - where we might be going.In my years as a writer, inventor, researcher, filmmaker, skeptic, story teller and explainer, I have always tried to keep an open mind about what we do not yet know. I seek the truth wherever it resides, and try to follow wherever it may lead, for the greatest mysteries are often the ones that we are the closest to solving next.

Malaysia: The World's Biggest Heist | 101 East,News & Politics,1023401,"6,045",486,"It's been branded the world's biggest heist - between 2009 and 2014 at least $4.5 billion was allegedly stolen from Malaysia's sovereign wealth fund, 1MDB. At the centre of the scandal are the former Prime Minister, Najib Razak and the now fugitive Malaysian financier and alleged mastermind of the scam, Jho Low. Ousted from power last year, Najib now faces almost 40 criminal charges and Jho Low is wanted in Malaysia, Singapore and the United States. The heist allegedly began soon after a joint venture deal was signed between 1MDB and a little-known company called, PetroSaudi. Hundreds of millions were soon siphoned to a Swiss bank account controlled by Jho Low and then later, as alleged by the US Department of Justice, into Najib Razak’s personal bank accounts in Malaysia. The world may never have known any of this, if it hadn’t been for a disgruntled PetroSaudi ex-employee, Xavier Justo.  He leaked more than 200,000 confidential emails containing evidence of alleged criminal activity to a British journalist, Clare Rewcastle Brown. At least half a dozen criminal investigations into the misappropriation of the billions of dollars from 1MDB are currently underway around the world and charges are being laid not only against the alleged conspirators, but executives from global financial institutions. In this episode of 101 East we investigate the deals and alleged criminal cover-ups that robbed Malaysia of billions of dollars, and track down the accidental hero who blew the whistle.- Subscribe to our channel: http://aje.io/AJSubscribe - Follow us on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AJEnglish - Find us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera - Check our website: https://www.aljazeera.com/#AlJazeeraEnglish #Malaysia #101East",PT25M51S,2019-02-07,2019-02-07,114237,Al Jazeera English,/channel/UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,UCNye-wNBqNL5ZzHSJj3l8Bg,20,FeIDiYbQaHs

Brian Greene and Alan Alda Discuss Why Einstein Hated Quantum Mechanics,Science & Technology,854577,"13,513",333,"Albert Einstein was not a fan of quantum mechanics. He was annoyed by the uncertain, random nature of the universe it implied (hence the famous quote ""God does not play dice with the universe""). So, Einstein tried to develop a unified theory that would circumvent what he saw as quantum mechanics' flaws. In this excerpt from the 2014 World Science Festival Program Dear Albert, Alan Alda and Brian Greene discuss Einstein's relationship with the ""unruly child"" of quantum mechanics, and how the famed physicist came up with the Special Theory of Relativity.Original Program Date: May 28, 2014Subscribe to our YouTube Channel for all the latest from WSF.Visit our Website: http://www.worldsciencefestival.com/Like us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/worldscience...Follow us on twitter: https://twitter.com/WorldSciFest",PT15M14S,2014-07-10,2014-07-10,132342,World Science Festival,/channel/UCShHFwKyhcDo3g7hr4f1R8A,UCShHFwKyhcDo3g7hr4f1R8A,20,HneFM-BvZj4

How has the Chernobyl disaster changed lives? | Foreign Correspondent,News & Politics,312365,"5,076",96,"Once the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident, Chernobyl is now a major tourist destination, thanks to a wildly popular TV drama. We go beyond the crowds to reveal the secret life inside Chernobyl’s exclusion zone.It’s byword for disaster and contamination. A lasting reminder of the devastation of nuclear meltdown, government-sanctioned cover-up and radiation sickness.  Now, thanks to the wild success of the HBO series dramatising the world’s worst nuclear accident, the site of Chernobyl in Ukraine has become a global tourist hotspot.  Geiger-counter in hand, Europe correspondent Linton Besser explores the enduring impact of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster.  He joins the hordes of tourists who arrive each day to wander around the ghost towns and near the abandoned reactor.“I heard a lot of stories…there are mutants there, there are creatures inside ,” says Australian tourist Nick, one of hundreds visiting the site from around the world.Besser goes where tourists can’t, beyond the decaying town of Pripyat, into the contaminated exclusion zone where he meets the secret communities who have defied evacuation orders to return home. The ‘babushkas’ – grandmothers – continue to grow their own food and drink water from their wells, despite the persistent presence of radiation.  “This is our motherland, it cannot be replaced,” says one babushka, sipping homemade vodka. “We want to die in our village. It’s our most cherished dream ,” says another.  Foreign Correspondent uncovers the strange sub-culture of Stalkers, young rebels attracted to the dangers of the zone - the threat of police, wild animals and radiation. “Life among death, is the main philosophy of Stalkers ,” says one man who’s made a niche business smuggling thrill-seekers in by night.  And we meet the disaster’s youngest victims – the children from the fallout zone who are suffering from radiation-related illnesses. “The soil should have been removed from the contaminated area, ” says one nurse at a children’s hospital. “But that wasn’t done. Everything was left as it was.”  Thirty years on, Ukraine still has 15 nuclear reactors providing the nation’s energy and many are operating despite reaching their designed lifespan. Local anti-nuclear campaigners say another disaster is a real possibility.  While some locals see this tourism boom as exploitative, many are glad their story is being told. “Everyone should know what had happened her,” says 73 year-old Sofia, standing barefoot in her garden. “ It’s hard to remember. Very hard ,” she cries. “Radiation is an invisible enemy”.

How To Buy The Best Steak For Your Money,Howto & Style,37575,825,27,"Tips & tricks to buying only the best steaks! https://gentl.mn/steak-buying-guideClick here for our full guide on STEAK CUTS: https://gentl.mn/2Pmz63vHow to cook the perfect steak: https://gentl.mn/2PUP7hj#steak #beststeakforyourmoney #gentlemansgazetteThe first step to buying a great steak is to look at the components we discussed in part one of our steak guide.First, we're going to determine the right cut. Second, you look at the flavor profile. Is it grass-fed? Is it grain-fed or maybe grain fed with grass finish? Of course, the size and the thickness of the steak are also very important. Most grocery stores steaks are usually cut very thinly while most chefs prefer a 1 to 2-inch thickness. At the end of the day, you should choose something that you're comfortable cooking because both can be over and undercooked. A huge factor to consider when buying a steak is the amount of marbling which is basically the amount of intramuscular fat. The marbling of steak can vary considerably depending on the cut you choose as well as the quality level of beef that you get. In the United States, the USDA has a grading system for beef that's pretty universal. Basically, you have three main USDA categories; there's USDA select, USDA choice, and USDA prime. These three grading categories are simply based on the amount of marbling present in the beef. So what about grass-fed beef you might wonder? grass-fed beef is actually not a protected term and so it can mean anything from a cow that ate just a tiny bit of grass to one that ate nothing but grass at all. So because of that it really pays to understand where your grass-fed beef is coming from and what the breeders are actually doing and feeding to their cattle. So what about Angus steaks or Certified Angus? It's a term that you often see in restaurants or grocery stores but it is, in fact, a breed not a quality grading. Angus or Aberdeen Angus is a breed of Scottish cattle that is smaller than the typical American cattle.What about Kobe beef or Japanese beef? Is it worth your money? So first of all, what is Kobe beef wagyu? it is a Japanese black cattle breed and a substrain of that that's called Tajima. It is fed on grain father and the feeding period is usually a lot longer than in the US typically 26 to 32 months whereas in the US it's only 18 months. It also has a much higher content of intramuscular fat and the melting point of the fat is a lot lower so when you eat it, it melts in your mouth like butter. Another Japanese beef variety that has become more popular recently in the US is a so-called Akaushi beef. It's actually a form of Japanese red cattle and in 1994 a Texas Ranger imported 11 purebred Akaushi cattle to the US. He kept them separate so he prevented crossbreeding and today they have over 5,000 cattle. The AKAUSHI steaks have even more marbling than prime steaks.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Want to stay updated?

How the rich get richer – money in the world economy | DW Documentary,Education,5081778,"43,150","2,884","Exploding real estate prices, zero interest rate and a rising stock market – the rich are getting richer. What danger lies in wait for average citizens? For years, the world’s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.The fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: it’s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: ""This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more."" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But it’s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. It’s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Sexual violence as a weapon of war | DW Documentary,Education,72865,"2,266",95,"Sexual violence and mass rape have long been used as a weapon of war. It is not only the victims and survivors who suffer trauma - an entire generation of men, women and children are affected. All too often, the perpetrators remain unpunished.More than 70 years ago, mass rape, sexual slavery and sexualized torture were employed as weapons in Germany, Japan, Italy and elsewhere during the Second World War. Mass rapes were also used as a ‘collateral’ weapon in the later wars and armed conflicts that erupted in the former Yugoslavia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rwanda. Over the past 30 years, sexual violence has been increasingly deployed as a strategic weapon by state military forces, paramilitaries, and armed groups. The victims suffer lasting trauma and persistent shame, yet the subject largely remains a taboo. The International Day for the Elimination of Sexual Violence in Conflict is observed on June 19. The first of these United Nations resolutions condemning sexual violence as a weapon of war was issued in 2008. More than ten years later, this documentary asks why international justice has failed to put an end to the impunity that generally follows this crime. Public awareness of the problem has been further raised by the two Nobel Peace Prize winners of 2018: Denis Mukwege, a Congolese doctor who has treated tens of thousands of rape survivors, and Yazidi activist Nadia Murad, who is a survivor of sexual violence at the hands of the Islamic State.-------------------------------------------------------------------DW Documentary gives you knowledge beyond the headlines.

Hip hop is one of our generation's perpetrators, but is also the art form that can turn this ship around.Lecrae is quickly developing into one of the biggest music stories of the year and his Cinderella rise has been noted everywhere from RollingStone, XXL Magazine, Vibe Magazine, The New York Times, The Atlantic, the cover of The Huffington Post to industry trades such as Billboard Magazine, Variety and Vulture. His performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, perfectly timed with his album’s release, had fans buzzing as he performed multiple hit records from Anomaly. He’s performed at the BET Experience, co­hosted The Dove Awards, co-­headlined the highest ticketed tour in the country (Winter Jam) and received a nomination for Best Impact Track at this year’s BET Hip Hop Awards. Sway Calloway, MTV News Executive Producer and host of his own nationally syndicated radio show, The Wake Up Show, recently proclaimed Lecrae as the “Evolution of Hip­Hop.” This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

A Walk To Beautiful (EMMY AWARD WINNING DOCUMENTARY) | Real Stories,Education,1356604,"12,429",659,"The film tells the personal stories of rural women who make their way to Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa, seeking treatment for obstetric fistula, a life-shattering complication of childbirth. Filmed in a starkly beautiful landscape, the documentary juxtaposes the isolated lives of village women who are outcasts because of their medical condition, with the faraway hospital that offers a miracle after a long and arduous trek—a “walk to beautiful.”Rejected by their husbands and ostracized by their communities, these women are left to spend the rest of their lives in loneliness and shame. Instead they make the long and arduous journey to Fistula Hospital in Addis Abba where they reclaim their lost dignity. The trials they endure–and their attempts to rebuild their lives–tell a universal story of hope, courage, and transformation.Want to watch more full-length Documentaries?

First Flight on Another Planet!,Education,1833481,"66,227","1,102","The Mars Helicopter aims to make the first powered flight on another planet when it takes off on Mars as part of the Mars 2020 mission. I learned a lot getting to visit the drone right before it was mounted on the rover.How do you fly in 1% of Earth's atmosphere:Have large rotors (they are 1.2m in diameter) and spin them very fast, around 2500 RPM (5x the speed of a helicopter on Earth).Plus the aircraft has to be light:The Mars helicopter weighs in at 1.8kg or around the same as a laptop. Every piece had to be stripped down for weight. Instead of using aerogel for insulation, the craft makes use of CO2 gaps between components. Even aerogel was too heavy!One of the major challenges is surviving the Martian night:Temperatures plunge to -80C to -100C so two thirds of the craft's power is actually used to keep its electronics warm. Only one third is used for flying. The estimated flight time is 90 seconds.The craft can't be driven remotely, it will have to fly autonomously, using its own sensor suite to determine how to fly. The round trip 20 minute delay with Earth means steering the craft from mission control would be impossible.

Mahatma Gandhi - dying for freedom | DW Documentary,Education,1257204,"12,067","1,032","Indian freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated on 30 January 1948. Why was Gandhi killed and what events occurred before and after Gandhi's murder? This documentary shows how India was dogged by nationalism and religious conflict on its path to independence - and how these factors mark the country to this day. On 20 January 1948, Gopal Godse, a Hindu fanatic, attempted to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi. Ten days later, his brother Nathuram Godse managed to finish the job: he killed Gandhi. For Gopal Godse, India's Independence Day in August 1947 was a day of mourning. ""Bharat Mata,"" ""Mother India,"" which the young Brahmin zealously worshipped, had lost many of its provinces. Predominantly Muslim East Bengal had become East Pakistan, whilst western Punjab, the provinces of Sindh and Baluchistan and the land of the warlike Pashtuns made up West Pakistan a thousand miles away. This too was predominantly Muslim. Godse didn’t just see the former colonial power, Great Britain, as responsible for the ""amputation,"" he also believed the Muslims were to blame. But, in Godse’s eyes, the main culprit was a Hindu who was celebrated as a hero because he had defied the English, a small man with round wire glasses and a white cotton robe: Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as ""Mahatma,"" the great soul. The Godse brothers did not care that Gandhi had always condemned conflict between the various religious communities and opposed the partition of India. They were members of the far-right Hindu Mahasabha, the ""Great Assembly of Hindus,"" which had close links with the anti-British and fascist National Volunteer Corps. And now extremist Hindus are gaining ground in India again..._______Exciting, powerful and informative – DW Documentary is always close to current affairs and international events.

Colbert is best known for his work as a television host, writer, actor, and producer, and best known for his charity work teaching English as a second language on Tunisian date farms. Prior to joining the CBS family -- and being officially adopted by network president Les Moonves -- Colbert helmed “The Colbert Report,” which aired nearly 1,500 episodes and required Stephen to wear nearly 1,500 different neckties. The program received two Peabody Awards, two Grammy Awards, and several unwelcome shoulder massages. It won two Emmys for Outstanding Variety Series in 2013 and 2014, both of which appear to have been lost in the move. Colbert is pronounced koʊlˈbɛər, according to Wikipedia. His understudy is William Cavanaugh, who will be hosting The Late Show approximately one third of the time. Good luck, Bill!""",PT6M43S,2016-10-18,2016-10-18,141476,The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,/channel/UCMtFAi84ehTSYSE9XoHefig,UCMtFAi84ehTSYSE9XoHefig,20,leW-seXnhBc
Donald Trump's Debates: 5 Mental Tricks You Didn't Notice,People & Blogs,2638227,"57,073","3,075","Get the 4 emotions you need to make a great first impression every time: http://bit.ly/2H1opA6Donald Trump's Debates: 5 Mental Tricks You Didn't NoticeDonald Trump has proven himself to be a master persuader.  His unlikely rise to prominence in the Republican primaries has riden on the fact that he knows how to work the media during interviews as well as his performances in the GOP debates against the likes of Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz.When watching the debates, many of his detractors criticize Trump's apparent lack of substance.  For instance, he ducked Megyn Kelly's question about sexism with a joke about Rosie O'Donnell.  He seems to repeat buzz words more than other candidates and often justifies his positions by referring to other people who support his stances, rather than defending them outright. While this may seem like weak arguments, Donald Trump's debate strategies actually align perfectly with the way humans think and process information.  For that reason, Trump's arguments tend to sink in more than his opponent's (like Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz) do.In this video we'll look at the top 5 relatively unknown psychological truths that Trump exploits to get his point across during interviews and debates.Link to Scott Adams' blog: http://blog.dilbert.com/Subscribe to Charisma On Command: http://bit.ly/subscribeCOCConnect With Us.Website: http://www.charismaoncommand.comFacebook: http://facebook.com/charismaoncommandPeriscope: @CharismaonOr if you want to see my personal stuff (my regular life + me playing music):Instagram: @CharlieHoupertPeriscope: @CharlieHoupert",PT10M37S,2016-02-08,2016-02-08,163476,Charisma on Command,/channel/UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,UCU_W0oE_ock8bWKjALiGs8Q,20,9LR6EA91zLo

Giovanni gained initial fame in the late 1960s as one of the foremost authors of the Black Arts Movement. Influenced by the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power Movement of the period, her early work provides a strong, militant African-American perspective, leading one writer to dub her the ""Poet of the Black Revolution.""James Arthur Baldwin (August 2, 1924 – December 1, 1987) was an American novelist and social critic. His essays, as collected in Notes of a Native Son (1955), explore intricacies of racial, sexual, and class distinctions in Western societies, most notably in mid-20th-century America. Some of Baldwin's essays are book-length, including The Fire Next Time (1963), No Name in the Street (1972), and The Devil Finds Work (1976). An unfinished manuscript, Remember This House, was expanded and adapted for cinema as the Academy Award–nominated documentary film I Am Not Your Negro.Baldwin's novels and plays fictionalize fundamental personal questions and dilemmas amid complex social and psychological pressures thwarting the equitable integration of not only African Americans, but also gay and bisexual men, while depicting some internalized obstacles to such individuals' quests for acceptance. Such dynamics are prominent in Baldwin's second novel, Giovanni's Room, written in 1956, well before the gay liberation movement.Soul! or SOUL! (1967–1971 or 1967–1973) was a pioneering performance/variety television program in the late 1960s and early 1970s produced by New York City PBS affiliate, WNET.
