&gt;&gt; Stephen: I WON'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOU.

00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:03.736 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:05.171 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HEY!

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:06.873
AND WELCOME TO "A LATE SHOW."

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:08.074
I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:08.107 --> 00:00:11.878
AND I'M HAPPY TO SAY TODAY I'M
JOINED AS MY STAGE MANAGER AND

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
CAMERAMAN AND SOUND PERSON, MY
LOVELY WIFE, EVIE.

00:00:17.783 --> 00:00:20.720 size:84% position:42%
EF, WON'T YOU JUST JOIN US?

00:00:20.753 --> 00:00:21.187 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.655 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HELLO.

00:00:22.688 --> 00:00:24.424 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THERE YOU GO!

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:27.527
WE JUST GOT A "MATURE" RATING.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.030
AND IT MAKES ME HAPPY TO HAVE MY
WIFE HERE, AND I NEED SOMETHING

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:35.334 align:start position:0%
TO MAKE ME HAPPY, AND I'M SURE
YOU DO, TOO.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:38.604 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE YESTERDAY, WE AS A
NATION HIT A TERRIBLE MILESTONE

00:00:38.637 --> 00:00:42.909
IN THE PANDEMIC, BECAUSE THE
UNITED STATES JUST PASSED ONE

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:45.211 size:81% position:41%
MILLION CORONAVIRUS CASES.

00:00:45.244 --> 00:00:48.247 align:start position:0%
THOUGH "SOME DISEASE RESEARCHERS
HAVE ESTIMATED THAT THE TRUE

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.348 size:84% position:42%
NUMBER OF INFECTIONS MAY BE
ABOUT TEN TIMES THE KNOWN

00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:53.886 align:start position:0%
NUMBER."

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:58.057 align:start position:0%
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY COMFORTING,
SOME DISEASE RESEARCHERS!

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.959
YOU NEVER HEAR A MOM TELLING
HER KID, "I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:05.164
OF THE MONSTER UNDER YOUR BED,
BUT, ACTUALLY, THERE COULD BE

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:06.265 size:88% position:44%
TEN MONSTERS UNDER YOUR BED.

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:07.199 size:84% position:42%
BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW,
BECAUSE THEY'RE INVISIBLE.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:12.939 align:start position:0%
GOOD NIGHT!"
EVEN MORE TRAGICALLY, THE NUMBER

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:16.909
OF U.S. CORONAVIRUS FATALITIES
IS NOW GREATER THAN U.S. LOSSES

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:18.010 align:start position:0%
IN THE VIETNAM WAR.

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:25.184 size:88% position:44%
AND JUST LIKE IN THE VIETNAM
WAR, DONALD TRUMP IS AWOL.

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:28.855 align:start position:0%
THAT'S HOW YOU SPEM AHOLE,
RIGHT?

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:29.956 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:32.325 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO AMERICA HAS
OVER ONE MILLION CORONAVIRUS

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:36.729 align:start position:0%
CASES AND MORE FATALITIES THAN
VIETNAM.

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:38.698
THERE'S NO GETTING AROUND IT:
THIS IS A SOLEMN DAY-- FOR

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:39.899 align:start position:0%
EVERYONE EXCEPT PRESIDENTIAL
SON-IN-LAW, AND MAN WATCHING YOU

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:42.702 align:start position:0%
ENJOY THAT LOLLIPOP, JARED
KUSHNER.

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:44.804 size:84% position:42%
HERE'S WHAT HARED SAID THIS
MORNING ON THE FOX AND THE

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:45.838 align:start position:0%
FRIEND.

00:01:45.872 --> 00:01:46.672 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT WE HAVE
ACHIEVED ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:50.843 size:84% position:42%
MILESTONES THAT ARE NEEDED.

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:51.844
SO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ROSE
TO THE CHALLENGE, AND THIS IS A

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.112 align:start position:0%
GREAT SUCCESS STORY.

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:56.682
AND I THINK THAT THAT'S REALLY,
YOU KNOW, WHAT NEEDS TO BE TOLD.

00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:57.984 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: (AS JARED)
"YES, IT'S A GREAT STORY.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:01.721
MORE PEOPLE DYING UNDER THIS
ADMINISTRATION IN 100 DAYS THAN

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:02.722 align:start position:0%
DIED IN 20 YEARS OF THE VIETNAM
WAR.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:05.858 align:start position:0%
THAT'S A STORY THAT NEEDS TO BE
TOLD.

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:09.929
PERHAPS IN THE BLOCKBUSTER
MOVIE 'PREVENTABLE APOCALYPSE

00:02:09.962 --> 00:02:11.597 align:start position:0%
NOW.'"
AND I'M BEING TOLD WE HAVE A

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.064 align:start position:0%
CLIP.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:13.733 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THE SUCCESS...

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:20.039 align:start position:0%
THE SUCCESS...

00:02:20.072 --> 00:02:23.042
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE PRESIDENT WAS
ASKED ABOUT THOSE INFECTION

00:02:23.075 --> 00:02:24.276 align:start position:0%
NUMBERS TODAY.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.244
&gt;&gt; Reporter: TODAY WE HAD A GRIM
MILESTONE OF ONE MILLION CASES

00:02:25.277 --> 00:02:27.547 align:start position:0%
OF THE CORONAVIRUS.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.950 size:88% position:44%
BACK IN LATE FEBRUARY, YOU
PREDICTED THAT THE NUMBER OF

00:02:30.983 --> 00:02:32.919 size:88% position:44%
CASES WOULD GO DOWN TO ZERO.

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.921 size:78% position:39%
HOW DID WE GET FROM YOUR
PREDICTION OF ZERO TO ONE

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.490 align:start position:0%
MILLION?

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:38.958 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL, IT WILL GO DOWN TO
ZERO, ULTIMATELY.

00:02:38.991 --> 00:02:42.762 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, SURE.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.897 size:88% position:44%
TECHNICALLY, IN TIME, WE ALL
EVENTUALLY GO DOWN TO ZERO,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.734 align:start position:0%
WHICH IS THE ULTIMATE TARGET
WEIGHT.

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:50.536
TRUMP HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR
THE LACK OF TESTING, BUT HE

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.638 size:75% position:38%
DOESN'T SEE THE PROBLEM.

00:02:52.671 --> 00:02:54.540
&gt;&gt; WE ARE DOING MORE TESTING
THAN ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN THE

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:55.875 align:start position:0%
WORLD BY FAR.

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.510
SO, WE'RE GONNA SHOW MORE CASES,
BECAUSE WE ARE DOING MUCH, MUCH

00:02:57.543 --> 00:03:01.113 align:start position:0%
MORE TESTING, DOUBLE ANYBODY
ELSE.

00:03:01.146 --> 00:03:02.281 align:start position:0%
SOMEBODY SAID IF YOU ADD
EVERYBODY ELSE COMBINED, THAT

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:02.848 align:start position:0%
WOULD BE A NUMBER.

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:04.884 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S RIGHT.

00:03:04.917 --> 00:03:05.818 align:start position:0%
THAT WOULD BE A NUMBER.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:09.388 align:start position:0%
TOMORROW, HE'S GOING TO DO
COLORS AND SHAPES.

00:03:09.421 --> 00:03:13.326 align:start position:0%
PLUS, IT MAY BE A NUMBER, BUT
DON'T BELIEVE TRUMP.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.595 align:start position:0%
THAT NUMBER IS NOT ONE, BECAUSE
WHEN IT COMES TO PER-CAPITA

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:17.830 align:start position:0%
TESTING, THE UNITED STATES. IS
BELOW THE WORLD AVERAGE AND

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:21.601 size:81% position:41%
ABOUT THE SAME AS BELARUS.

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:23.970
NOW, IF YOU DON'T KNOW, BELARUS
WAS FORMERLY PART OF THE SOVIET

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.472
UNION AND CURRENTLY A COUNTRY
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE "ABOUT THE

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:29.675 align:start position:0%
SAME AS."

00:03:29.708 --> 00:03:31.310
NOW, THIS PRESS CONFERENCE WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT EVERYTHING

00:03:31.343 --> 00:03:37.183 align:start position:0%
HE WAS DOING TO HELP SMALL
BUSINESSES, AND TRUMP HIT THEM

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:37.650 align:start position:0%
WITH SOME PHILOSOPHY.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:39.285 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SMALL BUSINESS.

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:40.386 align:start position:0%
IT IS ACTUALLY VERY BIG
BUSINESS, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:41.554 align:start position:0%
IT.

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:46.325 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: (AS TRUMP)
"SMALL IS ACTUALLY VERY BIG.

00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:49.328 align:start position:0%
AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I PAID
STORMY TO SAY."

00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:52.365
THE WHITE HOUSE IS HAVING TO DO
SOME CLEAN-UP AFTER MIKE PENCE

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:55.301 align:start position:0%
VISITED THE MAYO CLINIC AND
WOULDN'T WEAR A MASK.

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:57.670
FINALLY, A MEDICAL EXPLANATION
FOR WHY SEEING MIKE PENCE'S FACE

00:03:57.703 --> 00:04:00.906 align:start position:0%
MAKES YOU FEEL ILL.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:04.010
AND IT EXPLAINS WHY HIS SECRET
SERVICE AGENT WAS WEARING THIS

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.578 align:start position:0%
ONE.

00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:11.951 align:start position:0%
PENCE WAS ASKED ABOUT HIS
DISREGARD FOR THE RULES, AND

00:04:11.984 --> 00:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
HE SAID THIS:
&gt;&gt; SINCE I DON'T HAVE THE

00:04:13.352 --> 00:04:15.154
CORONAVIRUS, I THOUGHT IT WOULD
BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ME TO

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:17.556 align:start position:0%
BE HERE, TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO
THESE RESEARCHERS, THESE

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.392
INCREDIBLE HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL,
AND LOOK THEM IN THE EYE AND SAY

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:21.394 align:start position:0%
THANK YOU.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:25.398
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU CAN STILL LOOK
THEM IN THE EYE WITH A MASK.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.533 align:start position:0%
IT'S NOT A BLINDFOLD.

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:30.303 align:start position:0%
ALSO, "I DON'T HAVE
CORONAVIRUS" ISN'T AN EXCUSE FOR

00:04:30.336 --> 00:04:31.404 size:88% position:44%
NOT PROTECTING OTHER PEOPLE.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:32.672 align:start position:0%
IT'S LIKE A GUY SAYING, "I DON'T
NEED TO WEAR A CONDOM.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:39.178 align:start position:0%
I WANT TO LOOK YOU IN THE EYE
AND SAY THANK YOU."

00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
THAT WAS POLITE.

00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:43.049 size:88% position:44%
NO, YOU DON'T LIKE THAT ONE?

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:44.450 align:start position:0%
TOO BAD.

00:04:44.483 --> 00:04:51.223 size:84% position:42%
BY THE WAY, FOR MIKE PENCE,
"LOOKING YOU IN THE EYE" IS

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:52.424 align:start position:0%
SECOND BASE.

00:04:52.457 --> 00:04:53.592 align:start position:0%
PENCE POINTED OUT THAT HE'S
PRETTY SURE HE'S NOT CONTAGIOUS.

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I'M TESTED FOR THE
CORONAVIRUS ON A REGULAR BASIS,

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:56.262 align:start position:0%
AND EVERYONE WHO IS AROUND ME IS
TESTED FOR THE CORONAVIRUS.

00:04:56.295 --> 00:05:01.300 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NONE OF US CAN GET A
TEST, AND YOU'RE OUT THERE

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.636 align:start position:0%
BRAGGING ABOUT HOW OFTEN YOU'RE
TESTED.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:07.673 size:78% position:39%
THAT'S LIKE MOTHER TERESA
VISITING THE HUNGRY WHILE

00:05:07.706 --> 00:05:09.709 align:start position:0%
SCARFING A HOAGIE.

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.544
THE REASON WE HAVE TO WEAR MASKS
IS THE VIRUS IS STILL OUT THERE,

00:05:11.577 --> 00:05:14.013 align:start position:0%
AND WE HAVE TO BE WARY OF IT
WHEN GATHERING IN PUBLIC SPACES,

00:05:14.046 --> 00:05:17.783 align:start position:0%
WHICH WE'RE ABOUT TO DO A LOT
MORE OF BECAUSE THE BIGGEST MALL

00:05:17.816 --> 00:05:22.088
OPERATOR IN THE UNITED STATES
PLANS TO REOPEN 49 OF THEM.

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:23.556 align:start position:0%
NO!

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.024 align:start position:0%
BOOD MALL!

00:05:25.057 --> 00:05:26.025 align:start position:0%
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:30.730 align:start position:0%
WE MUST KEEP SOCIAL DISTANCING
FROM AUNTIE ANNE.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:32.064 align:start position:0%
SHE'S VERY OLD.

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:35.501 size:75% position:38%
AND SO ARE THE PRESSILS.

00:05:35.534 --> 00:05:38.871
THE MALLS ARE MAKING SPECIAL
SAFETY ANNOUNCEMENTS, AND FOOD

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:40.973
COURT SEATING WILL BE SPACED TO
ENCOURAGE SOCIAL DISTANCING, AND

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:44.977
REUSABLE TRAYS WILL BE BANISHED.

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.111 size:81% position:41%
THAT'S RIGHT-- "BANISHED."

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:50.116 size:88% position:44%
"HEAR YE, HEAR YE, HIS NOBLE
HIGHNESS BURGER KING HEREBY

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
BANISHES FROM THE REALM ALL
REUSABLE TRAYS.

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:57.456
AND FOR FAILING TO BEAR HIM A
SON, HER MAJESTY, THE DAIRY

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:03.095 align:start position:0%
QUEEN, SHALL BE BEHEADED WITH A
PLASTIC SPORK."

00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:06.699 align:start position:0%
AS A FURTHER PRECAUTION, IN
RESTROOMS, EVERY OTHER SINK AND

00:06:06.732 --> 00:06:09.869 size:78% position:39%
URINAL WILL BE TAPED OFF.

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:13.739
WELL, THAT'S AT LEAST GOOD NEWS
FOR ONE COMPANY: RALPH'S SINK

00:06:13.772 --> 00:06:15.174 align:start position:0%
AND URINAL TAPE.

00:06:15.207 --> 00:06:16.308 align:start position:0%
"IT'S BOOM TIME, BABY!

00:06:16.342 --> 00:06:19.979 size:88% position:44%
IN YOUR FACE, 'JOHNNY'S BIG
GARBAGE BAG YOU PUT OVER THE

00:06:20.012 --> 00:06:23.282 align:start position:0%
WHOLE TOILET!'"
WITH THESE MALLS OPENING UP,

00:06:23.315 --> 00:06:24.750 align:start position:0%
IT'S AN EXCITING OPPORTUNITY FOR
STORES THAT CATER TO SOCIAL

00:06:24.783 --> 00:06:27.887 align:start position:0%
ISOLATION, LIKE "FOREVER 21 FEET
APART," AND "GAMESTOP."

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:36.529
THERE WAS AN INSPIRING MESSAGE
TODAY FROM NEW YORK GOVERNOR AND

00:06:36.562 --> 00:06:40.366 align:start position:0%
MAN WATCHING STEPHEN MILLER
SWALLOW A MOUSE, ANDREW CUOMO.

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:43.803 align:start position:0%
AT TODAY'S COVID BRIEFING, CUOMO
STRESSED THAT IT'S ORDINARY

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:46.972 align:start position:0%
AMERICANS LIKE YOU WHO ARE
LEADING THE WAY ON THE

00:06:47.005 --> 00:06:50.976 align:start position:0%
CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE.

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:52.845 align:start position:0%
AND ARTS AND CRAFTS WERE
INVOLVED.

00:06:52.878 --> 00:06:58.517 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I WANT TO SHOW YOU A
SELF-PORTRAIT THAT WAS DONE BY

00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:59.284 align:start position:0%
AMERICAN PEOPLE.

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:03.155 align:start position:0%
THIS IS A SELF-PORTRAIT OF
AMERICA.

00:07:03.188 --> 00:07:07.226 align:start position:0%
OKAY?

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:15.167 align:start position:0%
THAT IS A SELF-PORTRAIT OF
AMERICA.

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.969 size:88% position:44%
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT SPELLS?

00:07:17.002 --> 00:07:19.238 align:start position:0%
IT SPELLS "LOVE."

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:30.449 align:start position:0%
WE'VE RECEIVED THOUSANDS OF
MASKS FROM ALL ACROSS AMERICA,

00:07:30.482 --> 00:07:34.987 align:start position:0%
UNSOLICITED, IN THE MAIL:
HOMEMADE, CREATIVE, PERSONAL,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:39.225 align:start position:0%
WITH BEAUTIFUL NOTES FROM ALL
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:43.229 align:start position:0%
LITERALLY.

00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:52.438
JUST SAYING, "THINKING ABOUT
YOU," "WE CARE," "WE LOVE YOU,"

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
"WE WANT TO HELP."

00:07:53.672 --> 00:07:54.840
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT IS BEAUTIFUL,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I BET THOSE

00:07:54.873 --> 00:07:55.874 align:start position:0%
NOTES DIDN'T SAY?

00:07:55.908 --> 00:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
"WHY DON'T YOU STAPLE GUN THESE
MASKS TO A WALL?"

00:08:00.112 --> 00:08:03.716 align:start position:0%
AGAIN IT IS A BEAUTIFUL-- IT IS
A LOVELY GESTURE.

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:04.517
GOD BLESS EVERYONE WHO DID THIS.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.486 align:start position:0%
BUT WE'RE GOING THROUGH A
PANDEMIC.

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:08.721
I'M NOT SURE THE BEST USE OF
MEDICAL EQUIPMENT IS MAKING A

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:09.889 align:start position:0%
COLLAGE.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:11.057 align:start position:0%
THAT'S LIKE A FOOD BANK SAYING,
"THANKS FOR YOUR DONATION!

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.192 align:start position:0%
THIS CAN OF BEANS WILL BE A
GREAT ADDITION TO OUR BEAN CAN

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:17.196 align:start position:0%
WALL!

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:20.499 align:start position:0%
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY, IT SPELLS
'BEAN.'"

00:08:20.532 --> 00:08:27.039
NOW-- YOU WEREN'T SURE WHERE
THAT JOKE WAS GOING, WERE YOU?

00:08:27.072 --> 00:08:28.741 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE NOT SURE, WOULD THIS BE
WORTH THE TRIP?

00:08:28.774 --> 00:08:30.109 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS.

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:33.012 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: TOTALLY WORTH THE
TRIP.

00:08:33.045 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
THERE IS SOME GOOD COVID NEWS
OUT THERE.

00:08:34.713 --> 00:08:36.115
RESEARCHERS AT OXFORD UNIVERSITY
HAVE DEVELOPED A VACCINE THAT'S

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:40.352 align:start position:0%
EFFECTIVE IN MONKEYS.

00:08:40.385 --> 00:08:43.022
OH, THOSE LUCKY MONKEYS, ALWAYS
GETTING THE FIRST INJECTIONS.

00:08:43.055 --> 00:08:48.127 align:start position:0%
WHILE THE REST OF US ARE
COOPED UP AT HOME, THESE MONKEYS

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:51.397 align:start position:0%
ARE WALKING AROUND RESUMING
THEIR NORMAL LIVES LIKE SPORTS,

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.632 align:start position:0%
CAT WASHING, AND WRITING MY
SHOW.

00:08:53.665 --> 00:08:56.368 size:84% position:42%
RESEARCHERS INOCULATED SIX
MONKEYS WITH THEIR VACCINE.

00:08:56.401 --> 00:09:00.105 align:start position:0%
THESE ANIMALS WERE THEN EXPOSED
TO HEAVY QUANTITIES OF THE

00:09:00.138 --> 00:09:04.376 align:start position:0%
VIRUS, I ASSUME BY GOING BOWLING
IN GEORGIA.

00:09:04.409 --> 00:09:06.111
BUT HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS: MORE
THAN 28 DAYS LATER, ALL SIX WERE

00:09:06.144 --> 00:09:10.816 align:start position:0%
HEALTHY.

00:09:10.849 --> 00:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
THIS IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE
ACCORDING TO THE RESEARCHER WHO

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:17.389 align:start position:0%
CONDUCTED THE TEST, "THE RHESUS
MACAQUE IS PRETTY MUCH THE

00:09:17.422 --> 00:09:20.259 align:start position:0%
CLOSEST THING WE HAVE TO
HUMANS."

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:21.393 align:start position:0%
WELL, ANY DRUNK, LONELY
ZOOKEEPER COULD HAVE TOLD YOU 

00:09:21.426 --> 00:09:23.462 align:start position:0%
THAT.

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:27.266
OXFORD'S SCIENTISTS HAD ALREADY
BEEN WORKING ON A VACCINE FOR A

00:09:27.299 --> 00:09:29.435
DIFFERENT STRAIN OF CORONAVIRUS,
SO IF THIS VACCINE PROVES SAFE

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:34.006 align:start position:0%
AND EFFECTIVE, THE FIRST FEW
MILLION DOSES COULD BE AVAILABLE

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:34.873 align:start position:0%
BY SEPTEMBER.

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:36.141 align:start position:0%
YES!

00:09:36.174 --> 00:09:38.344 align:start position:0%
JUST IN TIME TO GO OUT AND RAKE
THE FALL LEAVES.

00:09:38.377 --> 00:09:42.881 align:start position:0%
AND THEN USE THEM AS TOILET
PAPER.

00:09:42.914 --> 00:09:44.149 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO
RUN OUT BY THEN.

00:09:44.182 --> 00:09:46.051 align:start position:0%
THIS VACCINE PRESENTS ONE
ETHICAL DILEMMA.

00:09:46.084 --> 00:09:50.022 size:88% position:44%
SEE, SCIENTISTS CAN'T EXPOSE
TEST SUBJECTS TO A DANGEROUS

00:09:50.055 --> 00:09:52.725
VIRUS ON PURPOSE, LEADING ONE
RESEARCHER TO SAY, "WE'RE THE

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:54.860 align:start position:0%
ONLY PEOPLE IN THE COUNTRY WHO
WANT THE NUMBER OF NEW

00:09:54.893 --> 00:09:56.629 align:start position:0%
INFECTIONS TO STAY UP FOR
ANOTHER FEW WEEKS, SO WE CAN

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:59.698 align:start position:0%
TEST OUR VACCINE."

00:09:59.731 --> 00:10:01.867
REALLY, YOU'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE?

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.169 align:start position:0%
HAVE YOU MET VICE PRESIDENT
DISEASE VECTOR?

00:10:04.202 --> 00:10:08.607 align:start position:0%
CORONAVIRUS IS IMPACTING EVERY
ASPECT OF OUR LIVES.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.644
AND NOW IT'S COME FOR OUR MOST
PRECIOUS RESOURCE, AWARD SHOWS,

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:17.282
BECAUSE THE ACADEMY OF MOTION
PICTURE ARTS AND SCIENCES HAS

00:10:17.315 --> 00:10:18.784
ANNOUNCED THAT, DUE TO THE
NATIONWIDE LOCKDOWN, THE 2021

00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:23.722 align:start position:0%
OSCARS WILL CONSIDER FILMS THAT
DIDN'T PLAY IN THEATERS.

00:10:23.755 --> 00:10:27.626
OKAY, WELL, THIS IS HUGE NEWS
FOR ALL 412 HALLMARK CHRISTMAS

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:29.628 align:start position:0%
MOVIES LIKE "THE CHRISTMAS
SANTA," "A SANTA FOR CHRISTMAS,"

00:10:29.661 --> 00:10:31.964 size:88% position:44%
"ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS
YOU, SANTA," AND "'TWAS THE

00:10:31.997 --> 00:10:35.367 align:start position:0%
NIGHT AFTER CHRISTMAS."

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:37.870 align:start position:0%
IT'S MOSTLY ABOUT BREAKING DOWN
BOXES.

00:10:37.903 --> 00:10:43.542
THE ACADEMY STRESSED THAT THIS
CHANGE ISN'T PERMANENT, AND THE

00:10:43.575 --> 00:10:45.411 align:start position:0%
TEMPORARY RULES ARE VERY STRICT,
BECAUSE TO BE CONSIDERED, THE

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:47.713 align:start position:0%
STREAMED FILM MUST HAVE ALREADY
HAD A PLANNED THEATRICAL

00:10:47.746 --> 00:10:51.984 align:start position:0%
RELEASE.

00:10:52.017 --> 00:10:56.288 align:start position:0%
AND, LIKE PREVIOUS OSCARS, THE
FILMS MUST BE ABOUT A WHITE

00:10:56.321 --> 00:10:57.489 align:start position:0%
PERSON SOLVING RACISM.

00:10:57.522 --> 00:10:58.891
I'VE GOT TO SAY, I AGREE WITH
THE ACADEMY-- IN FACT, I THINK

00:10:58.924 --> 00:11:00.059 align:start position:0%
THEY SHOULD GO FURTHER.

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:00.793
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT MOVIES
RELEASED STRAIGHT TO STREAMING

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:03.028 align:start position:0%
ARE?

00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:04.029 align:start position:0%
TV!

00:11:04.062 --> 00:11:08.000 size:78% position:39%
IPSO TUXED-O, I SHOULD BE
ELIGIBLE FOR AN OSCAR!

00:11:08.033 --> 00:11:14.173 align:start position:0%
MY SHOW IS EXACTLY LIKE A MOVIE:
THERE'S A SOUNDTRACK, THERE'S

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:17.776 align:start position:0%
BIG STARS, AND NO GOOD TIME TO
SNEAK OFF TO THE BATHROOM.

00:11:17.809 --> 00:11:21.113 align:start position:0%
I USUALLY JUST GO DURING
"MEANWHILE."

00:11:21.146 --> 00:11:23.816 align:start position:0%
WE'VE GOT A GOOD SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:27.052 align:start position:0%
MY GU GUESTS ARE SENATOR AMY
KLOBUCHAR, AND MAYOR PETE

BUTTIGIEG.

00:11:27.652 --> 00:11:32.191 size:75% position:38%
BUT WHEN WE RETURN, SEX.

00:11:32.224 --> 00:11:33.058 align:start position:0%
WHAT?

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:36.261 align:start position:0%
WHY ARE YOU LAUGHING WHEN I
SAID, "SEX?"

00:11:36.294 --> 00:11:39.264 align:start position:0%
WHY DOES THE IDEA OF SEX AND ME
MAKE YOU LAUGH?

00:11:39.297 --> 00:11:39.598 align:start position:0%
STOP?

00:11:39.631 --> 00:11:39.998 align:start position:0%
OKAY.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:42.301 align:start position:0%
I SHOULD STOP.
