 Chris Anderson: Citizen Rights 

00:00:15.083 --> 00:00:17.169
 The future of the Internet 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.552
 So I want to welcome you to the TED Theater 

00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:23.378
 The man behind these discoveries 

00:00:23.378 --> 00:00:25.754
 Ed Snowden. 

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:29.321
 (clap) 

00:00:29.321 --> 00:00:33.574
 Ed is located far away in Russia 

00:00:33.574 --> 00:00:36.349
 He controls this robot through his laptop 

00:00:36.349 --> 00:00:40.402
 To see what the robot can see, 

00:00:40.402 --> 00:00:42.350
 Welcome, TED Theater 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.961
 What can you actually see? 

00:00:45.961 --> 00:00:47.699
 Edward Snowden: Here I can see everyone. 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:49.949
 It is amazing! 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.162
 (Laughter) 

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:56.445
 Chris: Ed some questions for you. 

00:00:56.445 --> 00:00:57.738
 You have been described by many attributes 

00:00:57.738 --> 00:00:59.303
 During the past few months; 

00:00:59.303 --> 00:01:04.228
 You were called a traitor's corruption detector 

00:01:04.228 --> 00:01:05.957
 a hero 

00:01:05.957 --> 00:01:09.774
 What qualities would you describe yourself with? 

00:01:09.774 --> 00:01:12.436
 Ed: You know everyone who displays 

00:01:12.436 --> 00:01:13.932
 For this discussion 

00:01:13.932 --> 00:01:16.674
 He suffers to understand me and to understand my personality 

00:01:16.674 --> 00:01:19.723
 How can he describe me. 

00:01:19.723 --> 00:01:21.412
 But when I think about it; 

00:01:21.412 --> 00:01:24.841
 We do not have to waste our time on this question 

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:28.008
 Who I am really doesn't matter much. 

00:01:28.008 --> 00:01:30.720
 If I were the worst person in the world 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.677
 You can hate me and move on 

00:01:32.677 --> 00:01:35.212
 What really matters here is what matters. 

00:01:35.212 --> 00:01:38.047
 What really matters here is the type of government we want, 

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:39.560
 The type of internet we want, 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.118
 The type of relationships between people 

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:43.458
 And societies. 

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:46.546
 And this is what I hope this discussion will lead to. 

00:01:46.546 --> 00:01:48.918
 And we have seen remarkable progress over time. 

00:01:48.918 --> 00:01:50.828
 If I had to describe myself 

00:01:50.828 --> 00:01:52.172
 I wouldn't use a word like "hero" 

00:01:52.172 --> 00:01:54.874
 I will not use a word like "my country" and I will not use a word like "traitor". 

00:01:54.874 --> 00:01:57.068
 I will say that I am an American citizen 

00:01:57.068 --> 00:01:59.632
 Just like everyone else. 

00:01:59.632 --> 00:02:01.505
 Chris: So let's give some background 

00:02:01.505 --> 00:02:03.701
 For those who don't know the full story-- 

00:02:03.701 --> 00:02:07.431
 (clap)-- 

00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:11.994
 This time last year I was staying in Hawaii 

00:02:11.994 --> 00:02:14.384
 She works as a consultant to NSA 

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.428
 As a sysadmin, I have access 

00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:18.833
 To their systems 

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:23.087
 And you started to reveal some of the classified files 

00:02:23.087 --> 00:02:26.287
 To some of the chosen journalists 

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:27.878
 And that led to the June statements. 

00:02:27.878 --> 00:02:33.254
 Now what motivated you to do this? 

00:02:33.254 --> 00:02:36.040
 Ed: You know 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.220
 When I was staying in Hawaii 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.878
 During the past years, when I worked with the intelligence service 

00:02:40.878 --> 00:02:44.600
 I saw many things that bothered me 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.877
 We do many good things in the intelligence service 

00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:49.070
 important things 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.767
 And things that serve everyone. 

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:53.724
 But there are also things that go beyond that. 

00:02:53.724 --> 00:02:55.020
 There are things that should not be done 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.088
 And decisions made in secret 

00:02:58.088 --> 00:02:59.336
 Out of public awareness 

00:02:59.336 --> 00:03:01.848
 Without their consent, 

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.700
 And without even knowing our representatives in the government 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.333
 With these programs. 

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:12.866
 When I started fighting these programs 

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:14.488
 I thought 

00:03:14.488 --> 00:03:17.574
 How can I do this work in the most responsible way? 

00:03:17.574 --> 00:03:20.582
 And that increases the public interest 

00:03:20.582 --> 00:03:23.293
 While reducing the risk? 

00:03:23.293 --> 00:03:26.381
 And among all the solutions that I came up with 

00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:28.623
 By visiting Congress 

00:03:28.623 --> 00:03:29.926
 When there were no laws 

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:31.611
 It can protect 

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.378
 Private employee 

00:03:33.378 --> 00:03:36.711
 The intelligence contractor is like me 

00:03:36.711 --> 00:03:40.358
 There was a risk that I could be buried with this information 

00:03:40.358 --> 00:03:42.265
 And that the public will not know anything. 

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:45.287
 But the first American constitutional amendment 

00:03:45.287 --> 00:03:48.828
 Freedom of the press guaranteed us for a reason 

00:03:48.828 --> 00:03:52.033
 It is to allow the hostile press 

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:53.930
 Challenge the government 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.564
 But also to work together with the government 

00:03:56.564 --> 00:03:58.882
 To embrace the debate and debate about how 

00:03:58.882 --> 00:04:04.321
 Inform the public about matters of utmost importance, 

00:04:04.321 --> 00:04:07.451
 Without jeopardizing our national security. 

00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:09.127
 And by working with journalists 

00:04:09.127 --> 00:04:11.281
 And give all the information 

00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:13.558
 I own the American people 

00:04:13.558 --> 00:04:15.329
 Instead of delegating myself 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.063
 To make a publishing decision 

00:04:18.063 --> 00:04:20.299
 We had strong discussions 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.566
 The government has invested deeply in it 

00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:28.672
 Which I think has created a public interest for everyone. 

00:04:28.672 --> 00:04:32.447
 Also the dangers threatening us 

00:04:32.447 --> 00:04:34.580
 And that was manipulated 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.132
 By the government 

00:04:36.132 --> 00:04:37.558
 It has not been embodied. 

00:04:37.558 --> 00:04:39.636
 We did not see any evidence 

00:04:39.636 --> 00:04:43.192
 Or even an abstract incident of particular harm 

00:04:43.192 --> 00:04:44.661
 Because of that 

00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:46.788
 I am satisfied with the decision I made 

00:04:46.788 --> 00:04:49.001
 Chris: So let me join the audience 

00:04:49.001 --> 00:04:51.470
 Some examples of things I uncovered. 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.382
 Can we upload the slideshow Ed and 

00:04:53.382 --> 00:04:55.137
 I don't know if you can see 

00:04:55.137 --> 00:04:56.251
 Here is the slide. 

00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:58.836
 This is a chip for PRISM 

00:04:58.836 --> 00:05:01.305
 Perhaps you could tell the audience 

00:05:01.305 --> 00:05:03.911
 Nothing was revealed. 

00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:06.123
 Ed: The best way to understand PRISM 

00:05:06.123 --> 00:05:07.584
 Because there was some controversy 

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:11.335
 First I have to talk about things PRISM does not represent 

00:05:11.335 --> 00:05:14.090
 Much controversy in the United States was about metadata. 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.981
 They said it was only metadata 

00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:19.722
 They are talking about a legal authority 

00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:22.427
 Section 215 of the Patriot Act is called. 

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:25.496
 Which gives court permission to eavesdrop on phone conversations 

00:05:25.496 --> 00:05:27.859
 Through comprehensive monitoring of telephone records 

00:05:27.859 --> 00:05:30.016
 In the country, things like - 

00:05:30.016 --> 00:05:31.378
 Who are you talking to 

00:05:31.378 --> 00:05:33.406
 When do you speak to them 

00:05:33.406 --> 00:05:34.702
 where did you travel. 

00:05:34.702 --> 00:05:37.203
 All of these are metadata events. 

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:40.549
 PRISM is about content. 

00:05:40.549 --> 00:05:42.689
 It is a program through which the government can 

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:44.733
 To force the Caboards of America 

00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:48.126
 And delegate it 

00:05:48.126 --> 00:05:51.990
 To do her dirty job for NSA. 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.986
 Although most of these companies resisted, 

00:05:54.986 --> 00:05:56.409
 Some even 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:57.655
 I think Yahoo was one 

00:05:57.655 --> 00:06:00.312
 I challenged them in court but lost 

00:06:00.312 --> 00:06:03.227
 It did not try an open court. 

00:06:03.227 --> 00:06:06.358
 They only tried a secret court. 

00:06:06.358 --> 00:06:07.725
 One of the things that we saw 

00:06:07.725 --> 00:06:10.429
 It is related to the PRISM program which is of concern to me 

00:06:10.429 --> 00:06:12.408
 There was a point of discussion in the state government 

00:06:12.408 --> 00:06:16.159
 They said that 15 federal judges 

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:18.857
 They reviewed these programs and found them legal 

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:21.577
 But what they don't tell you is 

00:06:21.577 --> 00:06:24.207
 That these judiciary were secret 

00:06:24.207 --> 00:06:26.209
 In a secret court 

00:06:26.209 --> 00:06:29.283
 Depending on secret interpretations of the law 

00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:33.517
 And that was considered 34,000 notes 

00:06:33.517 --> 00:06:35.976
 During 33 years 

00:06:35.976 --> 00:06:38.163
 During these 33 years he was rejected 

00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:41.046
 11 government requests. 

00:06:41.046 --> 00:06:43.793
 These are not the people we want them to decide about us 

00:06:43.793 --> 00:06:45.939
 What is America’s role? 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.395
 What does the Internet have to be free and free? 

00:06:48.395 --> 00:06:50.506
 Chris: Now this slide that we're showing here 

00:06:50.506 --> 00:06:52.718
 Show us the dates 

00:06:52.718 --> 00:06:55.133
 Technology and Internet companies joined 

00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:57.487
 To the program 

00:06:57.487 --> 00:07:00.445
 And where did you start collecting data from them. 

00:07:00.445 --> 00:07:05.194
 Now they deny cooperating with the NSA 

00:07:05.194 --> 00:07:10.298
 How was this data collected by the NSA? 

00:07:10.298 --> 00:07:13.477
 Ed: Correct! So the NSA chips 

00:07:13.477 --> 00:07:16.277
 Refer to it as a direct source 

00:07:16.277 --> 00:07:19.027
 What does this mean for an NSA analyst 

00:07:19.027 --> 00:07:22.135
 A guy like me used to work as an intelligence analyst 

00:07:22.135 --> 00:07:24.606
 Hackers target the Chinese 

00:07:24.606 --> 00:07:26.688
 Things like this in Hawaii 

00:07:26.688 --> 00:07:28.657
 Is the data source 

00:07:28.657 --> 00:07:30.913
 Directly from the server. 

00:07:30.913 --> 00:07:32.977
 this does not mean 

00:07:32.977 --> 00:07:35.783
 There is a group of company representatives 

00:07:35.783 --> 00:07:38.220
 They sit in a smoke-filled room with NSA 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.010
 They befriend and make side deals 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.553
 About the way to exchange information. 

00:07:42.553 --> 00:07:44.946
 Now each company handles the matter in different ways 

00:07:44.946 --> 00:07:46.122
 Some are responsible 

00:07:46.122 --> 00:07:48.213
 Others are less responsible 

00:07:48.213 --> 00:07:49.981
 But the bottom line is that when we talk 

00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:53.360
 What is this information about? 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.846
 It comes from the companies themselves. 

00:07:55.846 --> 00:07:58.141
 The lines are not stolen. 

00:07:58.141 --> 00:08:00.073
 But there is something to remember here 

00:08:00.073 --> 00:08:02.004
 Although these companies have evaded 

00:08:02.004 --> 00:08:04.057
 But it is still required 

00:08:04.057 --> 00:08:06.603
 Let's do this through a legally authorized process 

00:08:06.603 --> 00:08:08.377
 Let's do this 

00:08:08.377 --> 00:08:11.526
 Where we have a legal review, 

00:08:11.526 --> 00:08:13.357
 As some rules to provide 

00:08:13.357 --> 00:08:15.297
 This user information, 

00:08:15.297 --> 00:08:17.688
 We saw some stories on the Washington Post pages last year 

00:08:17.688 --> 00:08:20.900
 It has not been reported and the PRISM story has been reported 

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.499
 Which reported the NSA hack 

00:08:23.499 --> 00:08:25.300
 For the contact data center 

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.456
 Between google for the same 

00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:29.034
 And Yahoo for itself. 

00:08:29.034 --> 00:08:31.866
 So even these companies that contribute 

00:08:31.866 --> 00:08:34.737
 At least you contribute coercively but I hope in a legitimate way 

00:08:34.737 --> 00:08:36.610
 With the NSA. 

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.906
 But the NSA was not satisfied. 

00:08:39.906 --> 00:08:41.884
 Because of that we need our companies 

00:08:41.884 --> 00:08:44.699
 To work hard 

00:08:44.699 --> 00:08:47.171
 To ensure that she will act 

00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:49.757
 User interests will also defend 

00:08:49.757 --> 00:08:51.673
 About the rights of users 

00:08:51.673 --> 00:08:52.947
 Also I thought over the past year 

00:08:52.947 --> 00:08:54.530
 We saw the companies mentioned 

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:55.948
 On the PRISM chip 

00:08:55.948 --> 00:08:57.757
 Take great steps to do this 

00:08:57.757 --> 00:09:00.010
 I encourage them to continue. 

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:02.692
 Chris: What do they have to do more? 

00:09:02.692 --> 00:09:06.209
 Ed: The biggest things any internet company can 

00:09:06.209 --> 00:09:09.435
 In America you play today at this moment 

00:09:09.435 --> 00:09:10.877
 Without consulting lawyers 

00:09:10.877 --> 00:09:14.416
 In order to protect the rights of its users around the world 

00:09:14.416 --> 00:09:19.799
 It is to allow the use of the SSL code on the Internet 

00:09:19.799 --> 00:09:21.804
 On every page you visit. 

00:09:21.804 --> 00:09:24.746
 The reason why this is so important today; 

00:09:24.746 --> 00:09:29.984
 It is if you can look at a copy of 1984 on amazon 

00:09:29.984 --> 00:09:32.431
 NSA can see a record of that 

00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:34.650
 Russian intelligence can also see a copy 

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.107
 And also the Chinese 

00:09:37.107 --> 00:09:39.005
 French intelligence and German intelligence 

00:09:39.005 --> 00:09:40.327
 And Andorra intelligence. 

00:09:40.327 --> 00:09:43.605
 They can all see a copy because it is not encoded. 

00:09:43.605 --> 00:09:47.205
 Amazon is the world's library 

00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:49.860
 But not only do they support cryptographic services with the automatic option 

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.026
 But they don't give you the option to use it 

00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:53.753
 When searching through books, 

00:09:53.753 --> 00:09:55.462
 This is something we need to change. 

00:09:55.462 --> 00:09:57.337
 Not only for Amazon I don't mean to set them apart 

00:09:57.337 --> 00:09:58.829
 But they are a good example. 

00:09:58.829 --> 00:10:00.497
 All companies need to be transferred 

00:10:00.497 --> 00:10:03.890
 To automatic encrypted search services 

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:06.374
 For all users who have not taken any initiative 

00:10:06.374 --> 00:10:08.635
 Or choose any special method on their own. 

00:10:08.635 --> 00:10:10.946
 This will enhance privacy and rights 

00:10:10.946 --> 00:10:13.711
 That people in the world enjoy. 

00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:16.189
 Chris: Ed come with me to this part of the platform. 

00:10:16.189 --> 00:10:19.142
 I want to show you the next slide here (Applause) 

00:10:19.142 --> 00:10:21.850
 This is a program called Unrestricted Information. 

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:23.526
 What is that? 

00:10:23.526 --> 00:10:25.706
 Ed: So I have to give some appreciation to the NSA 

00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:28.149
 To use a suitable name here. 

00:10:28.149 --> 00:10:31.994
 This is one of the best names for NSA. 

00:10:31.994 --> 00:10:33.464
 Unrestricted information 

00:10:33.464 --> 00:10:36.314
 It is a program hidden by the NSA by Congress. 

00:10:36.314 --> 00:10:38.723
 The NSA was previously asked by Congress 

00:10:38.723 --> 00:10:40.936
 If she had any ability to give 

00:10:40.936 --> 00:10:44.694
 approximation 

00:10:44.694 --> 00:10:46.880
 For the amount of American communications 

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.014
 That were exposed. 

00:10:49.014 --> 00:10:52.045
 But they refused. They said they do not follow these statistics 

00:10:52.045 --> 00:10:53.594
 And they cannot. 

00:10:53.594 --> 00:10:56.698
 We cannot tell you the number of calls 

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:58.161
 That we penetrate around the world 

00:10:58.161 --> 00:10:59.648
 Because I tell you so 

00:10:59.648 --> 00:11:02.955
 It is an infringement of your privacy. 

00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:05.170
 Now I really appreciate their point 

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:07.305
 But when you look at this slide 

00:11:07.305 --> 00:11:08.958
 You will see they not only have the ability 

00:11:08.958 --> 00:11:11.574
 Capacity is already there. 

00:11:11.574 --> 00:11:13.248
 It is used. 

00:11:13.248 --> 00:11:16.396
 NSA has its own data format system 

00:11:16.396 --> 00:11:20.545
 And who monitors both ends of the call 

00:11:20.545 --> 00:11:21.827
 And if I tell 

00:11:21.827 --> 00:11:23.853
 About that this call came from America 

00:11:23.853 --> 00:11:26.209
 They can tell Congress about the number of these contacts 

00:11:26.209 --> 00:11:28.725
 That you observe today at this moment 

00:11:28.725 --> 00:11:31.696
 What does unrestricted information tell us? 

00:11:31.696 --> 00:11:34.422
 Is that a lot of connections are being hacked 

00:11:34.422 --> 00:11:37.395
 In America, it is issued by Americans 

00:11:37.395 --> 00:11:40.815
 It is more than the one that is hacked and exported in Russia through Russia. 

00:11:40.815 --> 00:11:42.680
 I'm not sure if this is what you should aim for 

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.999
 The Intelligence Agency. 

00:11:44.999 --> 00:11:47.405
 Chris: There was a story that topped the Washington Post 

00:11:47.405 --> 00:11:49.127
 From the information you shared. 

00:11:49.127 --> 00:11:50.806
 The headlines say 

00:11:50.806 --> 00:11:52.303
 The NSA has breached privacy laws 

00:11:52.303 --> 00:11:54.333
 Thousands of times during the year 

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:55.871
 Tell us about that. 

00:11:55.871 --> 00:11:58.464
 Ed: Last year we also heard a testimony in Congress 

00:11:58.464 --> 00:12:00.401
 She was amazing to someone like me 

00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:02.105
 Which was part of the NSA 

00:12:02.105 --> 00:12:04.677
 Real Internet documents 

00:12:04.677 --> 00:12:07.268
 He knows what's inside 

00:12:07.268 --> 00:12:09.808
 To see people testifying under oath 

00:12:09.808 --> 00:12:11.690
 There are no infringements 

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.323
 And that there were no violations of the NSA laws 

00:12:15.323 --> 00:12:18.264
 When we learned of this story. 

00:12:18.264 --> 00:12:20.352
 But the most exciting thing about this 

00:12:20.352 --> 00:12:22.400
 It is the fact that the NSA has passed 

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.768
 Its laws and rules 

00:12:24.768 --> 00:12:27.441
 Thousands of times in one year 

00:12:27.441 --> 00:12:30.168
 One incident involved 

00:12:30.168 --> 00:12:35.144
 Of 2,776 cases 

00:12:35.144 --> 00:12:37.450
 It affected more than 3000 people. 

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.289
 In another incident they were hacked 

00:12:39.289 --> 00:12:43.501
 All calls in Washington DC by mistake. 

00:12:43.501 --> 00:12:45.738
 Amazing about this 

00:12:45.738 --> 00:12:47.946
 The report did not get much attention 

00:12:47.946 --> 00:12:52.807
 It is the fact that there were only 2,776 assaults 

00:12:52.807 --> 00:12:54.948
 But the Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee 

00:12:54.948 --> 00:12:58.935
 Dianne Feinstein did not see this report 

00:12:58.935 --> 00:13:02.126
 Until the Washington Post called her 

00:13:02.126 --> 00:13:04.574
 I asked her to comment on the report. 

00:13:04.574 --> 00:13:06.467
 Then I requested a copy of the NSA 

00:13:06.467 --> 00:13:08.168
 And I got it 

00:13:08.168 --> 00:13:10.195
 But she had not seen that report before. 

00:13:10.195 --> 00:13:12.882
 What does this tell us about the censorship status? 

00:13:12.882 --> 00:13:14.619
 In American intelligence 

00:13:14.619 --> 00:13:16.407
 When she doesn't have the Senate Chief of Intelligence 

00:13:16.407 --> 00:13:19.200
 The slightest idea about the laws that were passed 

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.360
 Thousands of times a year? 

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.989
 Chris: Ed, give me one answer to answer the debate about: 

00:13:24.989 --> 00:13:27.654
 Sincerely why should we care 

00:13:27.654 --> 00:13:29.122
 With this oversight? 

00:13:29.122 --> 00:13:31.274
 I mean if you don't do anything wrong 

00:13:31.274 --> 00:13:34.058
 There is nothing to worry about. 

00:13:34.058 --> 00:13:36.350
 What is wrong with this view? 

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:37.998
 Ed: Well first thing it is 

00:13:37.998 --> 00:13:39.711
 You waive your rights. 

00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:41.069
 You tell them 

00:13:41.069 --> 00:13:43.441
 You do not need it. 

00:13:43.441 --> 00:13:45.123
 So I am sure 

00:13:45.123 --> 00:13:48.101
 It will be eliminated because it is not important 

00:13:48.101 --> 00:13:50.075
 These people will do the right thing 

00:13:50.075 --> 00:13:51.934
 Your rights are important 

00:13:51.934 --> 00:13:54.776
 Because you don't know when you'll need them. 

00:13:54.776 --> 00:13:57.058
 Beyond that is part of our cultural identity 

00:13:57.058 --> 00:13:59.190
 Not only in America 

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:00.781
 But in western societies 

00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:03.743
 And in democratic societies around the world. 

00:14:03.743 --> 00:14:06.147
 People should be able to hold the phone 

00:14:06.147 --> 00:14:07.601
 And contact their family 

00:14:07.601 --> 00:14:09.600
 People should be able to send text messages 

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.728
 For loved ones 

00:14:10.728 --> 00:14:13.182
 People should be able to purchase a book online 

00:14:13.182 --> 00:14:14.972
 They should be able to travel by train 

00:14:14.972 --> 00:14:17.189
 And to buy plane tickets 

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.926
 Without asking how these incidents could 

00:14:18.926 --> 00:14:22.611
 You look for any government agent 

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:25.201
 Potentially not a customer in your government 

00:14:25.201 --> 00:14:26.956
 Within years from now 

00:14:26.956 --> 00:14:28.696
 How will it be misinterpreted 

00:14:28.696 --> 00:14:31.480
 How will they think about your intentions then? 

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.554
 We have the right to privacy. 

00:14:33.554 --> 00:14:37.172
 We require settlements based on a possible cause 

00:14:37.172 --> 00:14:39.636
 Or any kind of individual suspicion 

00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:44.163
 Because we realize that we entrust anyone 

00:14:44.163 --> 00:14:45.757
 Or any government authority 

00:14:45.757 --> 00:14:48.841
 A matter of all human communications 

00:14:48.841 --> 00:14:51.274
 In secret and without supervision 

00:14:51.274 --> 00:14:56.118
 It is simply a great fit that cannot be ignored. 

00:14:56.118 --> 00:14:58.677
 Chris: Some people are so angry for what I did. 

00:14:58.677 --> 00:15:01.516
 I recently heard a quote from Dick Cheney 

00:15:01.516 --> 00:15:07.408
 And what Julian Assange said was the flea bite 

00:15:07.408 --> 00:15:10.830
 But Edward Snowden is the lion who bitten the dog's head 

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:12.383
 He thinks you did 

00:15:12.383 --> 00:15:14.675
 One of the worst betrayals 

00:15:14.675 --> 00:15:16.781
 In American history 

00:15:16.781 --> 00:15:21.137
 What do you say to people who think so? 

00:15:22.975 --> 00:15:25.180
 Ed: Dick Cheney is another. 

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:31.977
 (Laughter) (Applause) 

00:15:32.476 --> 00:15:37.378
 Thank you. (Laughter) 

00:15:37.378 --> 00:15:39.854
 I think it's amazing because at the time 

00:15:39.854 --> 00:15:43.629
 In which Julian Assange was doing his greatest work 

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:45.065
 He used to say Dick Cheney 

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:47.495
 It will end governments worldwide 

00:15:47.495 --> 00:15:50.400
 And that the heavens will ignite 

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.536
 And that the seas will boil 

00:15:52.536 --> 00:15:54.754
 And now he talks about a flea bite. 

00:15:54.754 --> 00:15:57.267
 So we have to be careful about 

00:15:57.267 --> 00:16:01.460
 Inflated national security issues 

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.145
 By this kind of officials? 

00:16:03.145 --> 00:16:09.994
 But let's assume that these people really believe this 

00:16:09.994 --> 00:16:12.224
 I can discuss that they have a species 

00:16:12.224 --> 00:16:16.594
 From a narrow understanding of national security. 

00:16:16.594 --> 00:16:19.810
 Powers of people like Dick Cheney 

00:16:19.841 --> 00:16:22.822
 Do not maintain our national security. 

00:16:22.822 --> 00:16:26.855
 Public interest is inconsistent 

00:16:26.855 --> 00:16:29.290
 Always with the national interest. 

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:33.184
 Go to war with people who are not our enemies 

00:16:33.184 --> 00:16:35.314
 In places that are not threatening 

00:16:35.314 --> 00:16:37.481
 Do not make us safer 

00:16:37.481 --> 00:16:39.648
 This applies both to Iraq 

00:16:39.648 --> 00:16:41.415
 Or on the Internet. 

00:16:41.415 --> 00:16:42.938
 The Internet is not the enemy. 

00:16:42.938 --> 00:16:44.963
 Our economy is not the enemy. 

00:16:44.963 --> 00:16:47.249
 American trade and Chinese trade 

00:16:47.249 --> 00:16:51.820
 And what company is there 

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.251
 It is part of our community. 

00:16:54.251 --> 00:16:56.465
 It is part of our continuous world. 

00:16:56.465 --> 00:17:00.910
 There are fraternal ties that unite us. 

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.578
 And if we destroy these links 

00:17:03.578 --> 00:17:06.733
 Undermining values ​​and security 

00:17:06.733 --> 00:17:09.590
 And behavior 

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.541
 What is expected of us all citizens and nations around the world 

00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:14.918
 To stick to it. 

00:17:14.918 --> 00:17:18.620
 Chris: But you were allegedly stolen 

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:20.519
 1.7 million documents 

00:17:20.519 --> 00:17:22.346
 But it appears that some hundreds of them 

00:17:22.346 --> 00:17:25.203
 It was shared with journalists 

00:17:25.203 --> 00:17:28.248
 Do we expect to reveal other things? 

00:17:28.248 --> 00:17:30.690
 Ed: Certainly there are many statements to follow 

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:33.491
 I do not think there is any question 

00:17:33.491 --> 00:17:37.738
 That some of the most important reports 

00:17:37.738 --> 00:17:42.478
 Not yet issued. 

00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.540
 Chris: Come here because I want to ask you 

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:46.067
 For a specific permit. 

00:17:46.067 --> 00:17:49.089
 Come take a look at this. 

00:17:49.089 --> 00:17:52.337
 I mean, this is a story of many rationing in this room 

00:17:52.337 --> 00:17:54.076
 Pose more topic shocking them 

00:17:54.076 --> 00:17:56.436
 During the past few months. 

00:17:56.436 --> 00:17:59.061
 It's about a program called "Paul Run". 

00:17:59.061 --> 00:18:02.837
 Can you explain it to us? 

00:18:02.837 --> 00:18:04.545
 Ed: All right, Paul Run again 

00:18:04.545 --> 00:18:11.642
 We should thank the NSA for its frankness 

00:18:11.642 --> 00:18:16.232
 This is a program that was named after one of the Civil War fights 

00:18:16.232 --> 00:18:17.845
 The British name is Adjil. 

00:18:17.845 --> 00:18:19.320
 Which is one of the battles in the British Civil War. 

00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.527
 And the reason why I think they were named as such 

00:18:21.527 --> 00:18:25.016
 Because it targets our infrastructure 

00:18:25.016 --> 00:18:27.707
 It is an NSA program 

00:18:27.707 --> 00:18:31.922
 You mean to mislead the participating companies. 

00:18:31.922 --> 00:18:33.804
 They tell them that this 

00:18:33.804 --> 00:18:35.479
 Sound standards 

00:18:35.479 --> 00:18:37.498
 They say we want to work with you 

00:18:37.498 --> 00:18:41.151
 In order to secure your systems 

00:18:41.151 --> 00:18:44.344
 But the truth is that they are giving advice 

00:18:44.344 --> 00:18:45.610
 For these companies and that 

00:18:45.610 --> 00:18:47.905
 Attenuation of the security of their services. 

00:18:47.905 --> 00:18:50.234
 They are building behind the doors not just as possible 

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:52.592
 The NSA exploited it 

00:18:52.592 --> 00:18:55.113
 But everyone else has time and money 

00:18:55.113 --> 00:18:57.233
 He can search for him and find him 

00:18:57.233 --> 00:18:59.367
 Then use it to enter 

00:18:59.367 --> 00:19:01.237
 To the world of communications 

00:19:01.237 --> 00:19:03.007
 This is very dangerous 

00:19:03.007 --> 00:19:07.191
 Because if we lose one standard 

00:19:07.191 --> 00:19:10.250
 If we lose confidence in the SSL 

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:11.732
 Which was specifically targeted 

00:19:11.732 --> 00:19:13.855
 By the Paul Run program. 

00:19:13.855 --> 00:19:16.523
 We will live in a less secure world. 

00:19:16.523 --> 00:19:18.630
 We will not be able to enter our banks 

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:23.883
 We will not be able to enter the trade 

00:19:23.883 --> 00:19:26.706
 Without worrying that these people are watching our communications 

00:19:26.706 --> 00:19:28.884
 Or sabotaging it for their own good 

00:19:28.884 --> 00:19:32.953
 Chris: Are these decisions unbearable? 

00:19:32.953 --> 00:19:35.939
 Exposing America to cyber attacks 

00:19:35.939 --> 00:19:39.855
 From other sources 

00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:41.320
 Ed: Absolutely 

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.052
 One of the problems 

00:19:43.052 --> 00:19:46.502
 The most dangerous legacies 

00:19:46.502 --> 00:19:49.994
 That we saw after 9/11 

00:19:49.994 --> 00:19:54.231
 Is that the NSA has traditionally wore two caps. 

00:19:54.231 --> 00:19:56.157
 They control the offensive operations 

00:19:56.157 --> 00:19:57.278
 Which is piracy, 

00:19:57.278 --> 00:19:59.988
 But they also controlled defensive operations 

00:19:59.988 --> 00:20:02.351
 Traditionally they have always given priority 

00:20:02.351 --> 00:20:03.738
 To defend against attack 

00:20:03.738 --> 00:20:05.128
 According to the law 

00:20:05.128 --> 00:20:07.944
 The American secrets are more important 

00:20:07.944 --> 00:20:10.054
 If we break through Chinese trade 

00:20:10.054 --> 00:20:11.738
 We stole their secrets 

00:20:11.738 --> 00:20:13.821
 If we attack the government offices in Berlin 

00:20:13.821 --> 00:20:15.919
 We stole their secrets 

00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:19.526
 That is why Americans are less important 

00:20:19.526 --> 00:20:21.626
 Make sure that the Chinese 

00:20:21.626 --> 00:20:24.132
 They will not be able to access our secrets. 

00:20:24.132 --> 00:20:28.263
 So by reducing the security of our communications 

00:20:28.263 --> 00:20:30.291
 They don't just put the world in danger 

00:20:30.291 --> 00:20:32.563
 They fundamentally put America at risk 

00:20:32.563 --> 00:20:35.234
 Because intellectual priorities are the basics 

00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.161
 And the pillars of our economy 

00:20:37.161 --> 00:20:39.419
 And if we put that at risk by weakening our security 

00:20:39.419 --> 00:20:41.048
 We will pay the price for years 

00:20:41.048 --> 00:20:42.595
 Chris: But they did calculations 

00:20:42.595 --> 00:20:44.786
 It proved important to do so 

00:20:44.786 --> 00:20:48.325
 As part of America's defense against terrorism. 

00:20:48.325 --> 00:20:51.937
 It definitely makes it a good price. 

00:20:51.937 --> 00:20:55.824
 Ed: Well when you look at the results of these programs 

00:20:55.824 --> 00:20:58.131
 To stop terrorism 

00:20:58.131 --> 00:21:01.881
 You will see that it is unfounded 

00:21:01.881 --> 00:21:03.800
 You do not have to take my words 

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.572
 Because we held the first open court 

00:21:07.572 --> 00:21:09.941
 Federal review of this topic 

00:21:09.941 --> 00:21:12.737
 Outside the secret procedure 

00:21:12.737 --> 00:21:14.724
 These programs are called strange 

00:21:14.724 --> 00:21:16.958
 It has nothing to do with the constitution. 

00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:19.697
 Congress, which had free access 

00:21:19.697 --> 00:21:21.008
 And see these things 

00:21:21.008 --> 00:21:23.990
 Now he has the desire 

00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:26.397
 To issue notes to fix them 

00:21:26.397 --> 00:21:29.282
 Two separate symposia are held in the White House 

00:21:29.282 --> 00:21:31.372
 I checked all these classified guides 

00:21:31.372 --> 00:21:34.005
 She said that these programs never stopped 

00:21:34.005 --> 00:21:35.766
 Any terrorist attack 

00:21:35.766 --> 00:21:39.269
 Almost happening in the United States. 

00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:42.455
 So what we are trying to stop is it the reality of terrorism? 

00:21:42.455 --> 00:21:44.786
 Do these programs have any value at all? 

00:21:44.786 --> 00:21:47.030
 I answer no and all three branches 

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:49.462
 The US government also says no. 

00:21:49.462 --> 00:21:51.275
 Chris: I mean, do you think there is a deeper stimulus? 

00:21:51.275 --> 00:21:54.560
 From the war against terrorism? 

00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:56.110
 Ed: Sorry I couldn't hear you, come back again? 

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.110
 Chris: Sorry, do you think there is a deeper stimulus? 

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.989
 For them more than the war against terrorism? 

00:22:02.989 --> 00:22:05.684
 Ed: Yes the bottom line is that the war on terror 

00:22:05.684 --> 00:22:07.885
 It has always been what we call intelligence 

00:22:07.885 --> 00:22:11.158
 With the process cover. 

00:22:11.158 --> 00:22:13.083
 Terror is something that stirs 

00:22:13.083 --> 00:22:15.313
 An emotional response that allows people 

00:22:15.313 --> 00:22:19.670
 Justify the permitting of powers and programs 

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.114
 They will not allow it in any other case. 

00:22:22.114 --> 00:22:24.600
 The Ball Run and the Adhige are of type programs 

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.317
 That the NSA has requested clearance of 

00:22:26.317 --> 00:22:28.254
 In the nineties 

00:22:28.254 --> 00:22:31.244
 They asked the FBI to submit the case to Congress 

00:22:31.244 --> 00:22:33.418
 The FBI filed the case 

00:22:33.418 --> 00:22:35.983
 But the Congress and the American people refused. 

00:22:35.983 --> 00:22:38.394
 It is not of value to threaten our economy 

00:22:38.394 --> 00:22:40.313
 They also said it would generate harm 

00:22:40.313 --> 00:22:43.000
 Greater for our society, which cannot justify the benefits. 

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.275
 But we saw it in the post-9/11 era 

00:22:47.275 --> 00:22:50.526
 They used secrecy and justifications for terrorism 

00:22:50.526 --> 00:22:52.460
 To secretly start these programs 

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.272
 Without asking Congress 

00:22:54.272 --> 00:22:56.452
 Or the American people 

00:22:56.452 --> 00:22:59.190
 Also this is the type of government that works behind closed roles 

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.749
 That we need to protect ourselves against 

00:23:01.749 --> 00:23:02.999
 It makes us less safe 

00:23:02.999 --> 00:23:04.891
 It does not provide any value. 

00:23:04.891 --> 00:23:06.757
 Chris: Okay, come with me here for a second 

00:23:06.757 --> 00:23:08.939
 Because I'm going to ask you a personal question. 

00:23:08.939 --> 00:23:11.863
 When we talk about terrorism 

00:23:11.863 --> 00:23:15.820
 Most people find the situation you are in now 

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:19.116
 In Russia it is very scary. 

00:23:19.116 --> 00:23:22.703
 You probably heard about what happened 

00:23:22.703 --> 00:23:24.896
 The treatment received by Bradley Manning 

00:23:24.896 --> 00:23:27.177
 Chelsea Manning is currently 

00:23:27.177 --> 00:23:29.664
 And there was a story in Bazfid saying that 

00:23:29.664 --> 00:23:31.322
 There are people in the intelligence service 

00:23:31.322 --> 00:23:33.601
 They want you dead. 

00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:35.541
 How to cope with this situation? 

00:23:35.541 --> 00:23:37.490
 How to cope with fear? 

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.494
 Ed: Not a mystery 

00:23:40.494 --> 00:23:46.142
 Some governments want me dead 

00:23:46.142 --> 00:23:49.552
 She clarified again and again 

00:23:49.552 --> 00:23:52.918
 I sleep every morning 

00:23:52.918 --> 00:23:57.478
 And I think about what I can do for the American people. 

00:23:57.478 --> 00:24:00.510
 I do not want to harm my government. 

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.773
 I want to help her 

00:24:03.773 --> 00:24:07.581
 But the fact that they wish 

00:24:07.581 --> 00:24:09.901
 In ignoring the required legal procedures 

00:24:09.901 --> 00:24:12.609
 They also wish to accuse me of guilt 

00:24:12.609 --> 00:24:15.895
 Without watching any trial 

00:24:15.895 --> 00:24:18.311
 These are the things that we need to act against 

00:24:18.311 --> 00:24:21.889
 As a society we have to declare it inappropriate. 

00:24:21.889 --> 00:24:23.716
 We should not threaten the rogue 

00:24:23.716 --> 00:24:26.730
 And do not criminalize journalists 

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:30.049
 And anything I can do to end that 

00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:33.202
 I am happy to do it despite the danger. 

00:24:33.202 --> 00:24:34.726
 Chris: I want to take an opinion 

00:24:34.726 --> 00:24:35.945
 Some of the attendees are here 

00:24:35.945 --> 00:24:38.049
 Because I know there are different reactions 

00:24:38.049 --> 00:24:39.990
 By Edward Snowden 

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:42.278
 Suppose you currently have these two options? 

00:24:42.278 --> 00:24:45.084
 You can see what it did 

00:24:45.084 --> 00:24:46.978
 Basically reckless 

00:24:46.978 --> 00:24:50.197
 Putting America at risk 

00:24:50.197 --> 00:24:53.760
 Or do you see it as a work with a heroic basis 

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:57.235
 It can serve America and the world 

00:24:57.235 --> 00:24:58.622
 The long-term? 

00:24:58.622 --> 00:25:01.940
 These are the two options that will give you. 

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.095
 I am burning to see who will vote 

00:25:04.095 --> 00:25:05.512
 For the first option 

00:25:05.512 --> 00:25:08.921
 Was this a reckless act? 

00:25:08.921 --> 00:25:10.576
 Are there some hands raised? 

00:25:10.576 --> 00:25:11.960
 Some hands went up. 

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.236
 It is difficult to raise your hand 

00:25:13.236 --> 00:25:15.347
 When the person stands in front of you here 

00:25:15.347 --> 00:25:16.912
 But I see those hands. 

00:25:16.912 --> 00:25:19.443
 Ed: I can see you (Laughter) 

00:25:19.443 --> 00:25:21.704
 Chris: And whoever agrees with the second option 

00:25:21.704 --> 00:25:23.587
 Heroic-based work? 

00:25:23.587 --> 00:25:26.234
 (Applause) (encouragement) 

00:25:26.234 --> 00:25:28.808
 Also it is true that many did not 

00:25:28.808 --> 00:25:31.033
 They raise their hands 

00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:32.743
 They are still thinking about this 

00:25:32.743 --> 00:25:36.201
 Because it seems to me that the debate is around you 

00:25:36.201 --> 00:25:39.310
 Does not bias the accepted political lines. 

00:25:39.310 --> 00:25:41.564
 It is not my left or my right, it is not about 

00:25:41.564 --> 00:25:45.686
 Free government supporters or that part of it 

00:25:45.686 --> 00:25:48.399
 General issue only. 

00:25:48.399 --> 00:25:50.207
 You are part of a generation raised 

00:25:50.207 --> 00:25:53.133
 Online and as it appears 

00:25:53.133 --> 00:25:56.341
 You resent to depths 

00:25:56.341 --> 00:25:57.637
 If you see something being done 

00:25:57.637 --> 00:25:59.699
 And you think it will harm the Internet. 

00:25:59.699 --> 00:26:03.272
 Is there anything truth in this? 

00:26:03.272 --> 00:26:08.320
 Ed: It is. I think it is true. 

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.418
 This is not a subject of left or right. 

00:26:11.418 --> 00:26:13.995
 Our basic freedoms when I say that 

00:26:13.995 --> 00:26:15.542
 I do not mean the Americans 

00:26:15.542 --> 00:26:17.555
 I mean all the people around the world 

00:26:17.555 --> 00:26:19.901
 It is not a partisan matter. 

00:26:19.901 --> 00:26:21.940
 These are things that all people believe 

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.465
 And it's all our responsibility to protect it 

00:26:24.465 --> 00:26:27.297
 And the responsibility of the people who have fun 

00:26:27.297 --> 00:26:28.958
 With free and open internet 

00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:32.184
 It is our responsibility to maintain this freedom 

00:26:32.184 --> 00:26:34.089
 For the next generation to enjoy it 

00:26:34.089 --> 00:26:35.954
 And if we do not change things 

00:26:35.954 --> 00:26:39.087
 If we do not stand to make changes 

00:26:39.087 --> 00:26:42.294
 That we need to maintain a secure internet 

00:26:42.294 --> 00:26:45.062
 Not only for our sake but for everyone 

00:26:45.062 --> 00:26:46.527
 We will lose that 

00:26:46.527 --> 00:26:47.780
 It will be a great loss 

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:50.127
 Not only to us but to the world. 

00:26:50.127 --> 00:26:52.200
 Chris: Well I heard a similar language 

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.048
 From the founder of the World Wide Web 

00:26:54.048 --> 00:26:58.565
 Which I believe is Sir Tim Berners-Lee 

00:26:58.565 --> 00:27:01.269
 Tim, actually would you like to come and tell us 

00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:03.140
 Do we have a microphone for Tim? 

00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:05.507
 (clap) 

00:27:05.507 --> 00:27:12.582
 Tim good to see you come here 

00:27:12.582 --> 00:27:15.019
 By the way, which party do you belong to? 

00:27:15.019 --> 00:27:18.519
 Traitor, hero? I have a theory about this however 

00:27:18.519 --> 00:27:21.213
 Tim: I gave some long answers to that 

00:27:21.213 --> 00:27:24.268
 But a hero 

00:27:24.268 --> 00:27:27.670
 If I had to choose between the two. 

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:31.003
 Chris: I think you've read 

00:27:31.003 --> 00:27:33.087
 The proposal that Sir Tim talked about 

00:27:33.087 --> 00:27:36.055
 About the new Magna Carta to retrieve the Internet 

00:27:36.055 --> 00:27:38.157
 Is this a logical thing? 

00:27:38.157 --> 00:27:41.798
 Ed: Certainly I mean my generation hasn't grown older 

00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:43.857
 Only I am thinking about the Internet 

00:27:43.857 --> 00:27:46.221
 But I grew up inside the Internet 

00:27:46.221 --> 00:27:50.881
 Although I did not expect to get the chance 

00:27:50.881 --> 00:27:56.428
 To defend him in a direct and practical way 

00:27:56.428 --> 00:28:00.224
 And to show it in an unusual way 

00:28:00.224 --> 00:28:02.353
 Almost symbolic method 

00:28:02.353 --> 00:28:05.059
 I think there is a poetic way about this fact 

00:28:05.059 --> 00:28:07.041
 One of the sons of the Internet 

00:28:07.041 --> 00:28:10.093
 Really close to the internet 

00:28:10.093 --> 00:28:12.579
 As a result of expressing his political direction. 

00:28:12.579 --> 00:28:16.290
 And I think Magna Carta is for the internet 

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.252
 It is exactly what we need 

00:28:18.252 --> 00:28:21.760
 We need to encode our values 

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:25.107
 Not only through writing but in the structure of the Internet 

00:28:25.107 --> 00:28:27.347
 It is something that I hope 

00:28:27.347 --> 00:28:29.870
 To invite everyone from the audience 

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.120
 Not only here in Vancouver but around the world 

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.476
 Until they join and participate. 

00:28:35.476 --> 00:28:37.790
 Chris: Do you have a question for Ed? 

00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.820
 Tim: Well two questions 

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:40.944
 General question 

00:28:40.944 --> 00:28:42.739
 Chris: Ed, can you still hear us? 

00:28:42.739 --> 00:28:46.255
 Ed: Yes, I can hear you Chris: Uh, he's back. 

00:28:46.255 --> 00:28:47.850
 Tim: Your tapping line 

00:28:47.850 --> 00:28:49.756
 He was intercepted for a moment. 

00:28:49.756 --> 00:28:51.409
 (Laughter) 

00:28:51.409 --> 00:28:53.611
 Ed: It's a little NSA issue 

00:28:53.611 --> 00:28:57.418
 Tim: So over the past 25 years 

00:28:57.418 --> 00:29:00.355
 I can go back and think 

00:29:00.355 --> 00:29:02.101
 What do you think it could be 

00:29:02.101 --> 00:29:04.708
 The best thing we can do 

00:29:04.708 --> 00:29:06.568
 From all of these discussions 

00:29:06.568 --> 00:29:09.461
 What network do we want? 

00:29:09.461 --> 00:29:12.833
 Ed: When we think about 

00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:15.946
 How much we can accomplish 

00:29:15.946 --> 00:29:18.099
 I think it is a restricted question 

00:29:18.099 --> 00:29:20.636
 Our desire to serve the cause. 

00:29:20.636 --> 00:29:23.593
 I think the internet we enjoyed in the past 

00:29:23.593 --> 00:29:29.151
 It became exactly what we needed, not just as a nation 

00:29:29.151 --> 00:29:32.490
 But what all people around the world need 

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:36.716
 And in cooperation not only with involvement 

00:29:36.716 --> 00:29:38.120
 The technical part of society 

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.962
 But as I have users 

00:29:40.962 --> 00:29:43.026
 People around the year who contribute 

00:29:43.026 --> 00:29:45.468
 Online and social media 

00:29:45.468 --> 00:29:47.195
 Who are only checking the weather 

00:29:47.195 --> 00:29:49.748
 And who depend on him daily as part of their lives 

00:29:49.748 --> 00:29:52.688
 To defend him. 

00:29:52.688 --> 00:29:55.225
 We will not only get the internet that we had 

00:29:55.225 --> 00:29:58.174
 But the internet is better 

00:29:58.174 --> 00:30:02.217
 Something we can use to build a future 

00:30:02.217 --> 00:30:05.185
 It will get better not only than we had hoped 

00:30:05.185 --> 00:30:07.570
 But anything that we imagined. 

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:13.032
 Chris: Thirty years when TED was founded 

00:30:13.032 --> 00:30:15.037
 Lots of conversations since then 

00:30:15.037 --> 00:30:17.091
 It was about texts 

00:30:17.091 --> 00:30:18.994
 That George Uriel erred on. 

00:30:18.994 --> 00:30:20.713
 It is not the older brother who is watching us. 

00:30:20.713 --> 00:30:22.327
 We are through the power of the network 

00:30:22.327 --> 00:30:24.691
 And transparency we watch the older brother. 

00:30:24.691 --> 00:30:26.952
 Your declarations are kind of broken 

00:30:26.952 --> 00:30:30.699
 Optimistic views 

00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:34.119
 But you still believe that there is a way to do 

00:30:34.119 --> 00:30:35.988
 Something about it. 

00:30:35.988 --> 00:30:37.728
 And you do that. 

00:30:37.728 --> 00:30:43.896
 Ed: It is true that there is an argument that must be made 

00:30:43.896 --> 00:30:47.493
 It is that the powers of the older brother have increased dramatically. 

00:30:47.493 --> 00:30:51.822
 There is a recent article at Yale University 

00:30:51.822 --> 00:30:55.553
 He founded something called the Bankstone Soltaney Base 

00:30:55.553 --> 00:31:00.782
 Which is touched upon because the privacy that we expected was violated 

00:31:00.782 --> 00:31:02.651
 When it became government oversight capabilities 

00:31:02.651 --> 00:31:05.846
 Low in exponential value. 

00:31:05.846 --> 00:31:08.568
 And every time that happens, we need to review 

00:31:08.568 --> 00:31:11.621
 We balance our rights to privacy 

00:31:11.621 --> 00:31:13.611
 Now this has not happened since 

00:31:13.611 --> 00:31:15.709
 Government powers would increase 

00:31:15.709 --> 00:31:18.489
 Regulatory exponential amount 

00:31:18.489 --> 00:31:21.463
 And for that we are facing this problem today 

00:31:21.463 --> 00:31:25.275
 But there is still hope, 

00:31:25.275 --> 00:31:27.411
 Because the strength of people 

00:31:27.411 --> 00:31:30.018
 It has also increased by technology 

00:31:30.018 --> 00:31:32.019
 And I'm the biggest example of 

00:31:32.019 --> 00:31:34.181
 That someone can go head-to-head 

00:31:34.181 --> 00:31:36.499
 Defying the most powerful opponents 

00:31:36.499 --> 00:31:38.820
 The most powerful intelligence agency 

00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:42.580
 Around the world and succeed, 

00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.240
 And I think this is something 

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.663
 We have to be optimistic about it 

00:31:46.663 --> 00:31:47.840
 And we build on it 

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.277
 To make it available not only to legal experts 

00:31:50.277 --> 00:31:52.794
 But for ordinary citizens around the world 

00:31:52.794 --> 00:31:54.461
 The press is not a crime 

00:31:54.461 --> 00:31:56.251
 Communication is not a crime 

00:31:56.251 --> 00:31:59.195
 And we should not be monitored in our daily activities. 

00:31:59.195 --> 00:32:01.924
 Chris: I'm not sure how you can shake hands with a robot's hand 

00:32:01.924 --> 00:32:07.814
 But imagine that this hand is here. Tim: Sv is coming up soon. 

00:32:07.814 --> 00:32:08.937
 Ed: Glad to meet you 

00:32:08.937 --> 00:32:10.984
 And I hope my picture looks good 

00:32:10.984 --> 00:32:13.328
 As the picture I see you. 

00:32:13.328 --> 00:32:16.048
 Chris: Thanks Tim. 

00:32:16.048 --> 00:32:21.780
 (clap) 

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:25.832
 I mean, the New York Times called for a public page on you. 

00:32:25.832 --> 00:32:30.058
 Do you welcome the opportunity to come to America again? 

00:32:30.058 --> 00:32:33.943
 Ed: Certainly, really, no question 

00:32:33.943 --> 00:32:36.525
 The principles that formed the basis 

00:32:36.525 --> 00:32:38.918
 this project 

00:32:38.918 --> 00:32:42.998
 It was in the public interest 

00:32:42.998 --> 00:32:45.941
 And for the principles that are based 

00:32:45.941 --> 00:32:49.217
 It has press in the United States 

00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:51.663
 And around the world 

00:32:51.663 --> 00:32:56.508
 And I think if the media tell that they are 

00:32:56.508 --> 00:32:58.590
 They support it 

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:00.678
 This thing has to happen 

00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:03.322
 This is a strong argument, but it is not the last argument 

00:33:03.322 --> 00:33:06.035
 And I think this is something the public has to decide 

00:33:06.035 --> 00:33:07.877
 But at the same time 

00:33:07.877 --> 00:33:09.423
 The government hinted 

00:33:09.423 --> 00:33:11.267
 They kind of want a deal 

00:33:11.267 --> 00:33:13.381
 They want me to expose 

00:33:13.381 --> 00:33:15.556
 The journalists I deal with 

00:33:15.556 --> 00:33:16.989
 until I come back, 

00:33:16.989 --> 00:33:19.542
 And I want to clarify 

00:33:19.542 --> 00:33:22.268
 I didn't do it to be safe 

00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:24.536
 I did this to do the right thing 

00:33:24.536 --> 00:33:26.763
 I will not stop my work for service 

00:33:26.763 --> 00:33:28.137
 Public interest 

00:33:28.137 --> 00:33:30.926
 Just to serve myself. 

00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:36.704
 (clap) 

00:33:36.704 --> 00:33:38.623
 Chris: Just in time 

00:33:38.623 --> 00:33:42.391
 As a courtesy of the Internet and this technology 

00:33:42.391 --> 00:33:44.041
 I returned here to North America 

00:33:44.041 --> 00:33:48.057
 Not the United States but Canada in this way. 

00:33:48.057 --> 00:33:52.951
 I'm excited to know how you feel? 

00:33:52.951 --> 00:33:55.089
 Ed: Canada is different from what I expected. 

00:33:55.089 --> 00:33:57.214
 It is warmer. 

00:33:57.214 --> 00:34:02.921
 (Laughter) 

00:34:02.921 --> 00:34:06.177
 Chris: Here at TED, it's our mission to spread valuable ideas 

00:34:06.177 --> 00:34:08.375
 Can you summarize this conversation in one idea? 

00:34:08.375 --> 00:34:10.590
 What is your idea worth spreading 

00:34:10.590 --> 00:34:14.665
 Now at this moment? 

00:34:14.665 --> 00:34:18.315
 Ed: I can say that last year reminded us 

00:34:18.315 --> 00:34:21.918
 Democracy can die behind closed doors 

00:34:21.918 --> 00:34:23.822
 But we, as people we were born 

00:34:23.822 --> 00:34:26.471
 Behind these closed doors 

00:34:26.471 --> 00:34:28.836
 And we don't have to give 

00:34:28.836 --> 00:34:32.069
 Our privacy in order to have a good government. 

00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:34.159
 We do not have to give up our freedom 

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.938
 For security 

00:34:35.938 --> 00:34:38.726
 And I think by working together 

00:34:38.726 --> 00:34:41.051
 We can have an open government 

00:34:41.051 --> 00:34:42.988
 And a private life 

00:34:42.988 --> 00:34:44.761
 I yearn to work with everyone 

00:34:44.761 --> 00:34:47.300
 Around the world to see it happen. 

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:48.638
 Thank you so much. 

00:34:48.638 --> 00:34:50.878
 Chris: Ed, thank you. 

00:34:50.878 --> 00:34:59.707
 (clap)
