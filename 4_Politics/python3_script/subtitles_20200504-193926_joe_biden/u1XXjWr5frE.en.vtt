00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.010
Quantum computers use the natural
world to produce machines

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.530
with staggeringly powerful
processing potential.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.050
I think it's gonna be
the most important computing

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.190
technology of this century, which
we are really just about

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.200
one fifth into.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.540
We could use quantum computers
to simulate molecules, to

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.930
build new drugs and new
materials and to solve problems

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:22.820
plaguing physicists
for decades.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.450
Wall Street could use them
to optimize portfolios, simulate

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.690
economic forecasts and for
complex risk analysis.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.510
Quantum computing could also
help scientists speed up

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.630
discoveries in adjacent fields
like machine learning and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.010
artificial intelligence.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.180
Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft,
plus a host of smaller

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.450
companies such as Rigetti and
D-Wave, are all betting big

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.960
on Quantum. If you were a
billionaire, how many of your

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.410
billion would you give over for
an extra 10 years of life?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.060
There are some simply
astonishing financial opportunities

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.520
in quantum computing. This is
why there's so much interest.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.570
Even though it's so
far down the road.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.930
But nothing is ever
a sure thing.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.390
And dealing with the quirky
nature of quantum physics

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.480
creates some big hurdles
for this nascent technology.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.280
From the very beginning, it
was understood that building a

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.270
useful quantum computer was going
to be a staggeringly hard

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.540
engineering problem if it was
even possible at all.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.620
And there were even distinguished
physicists in the 90s who

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.000
said this will never work.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.780
Is Quantum truly the next big
thing in computing, or is it

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.570
destined to become something
more like nuclear fusion?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.720
Destined to always be the
technology of the future, never

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.230
the present. In October 2019,
Google made a big

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.380
announcement. Google said it
had achieved quantum

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.740
supremacy. That's the moment
when quantum computers can

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.380
beat out the world's
most powerful supercomputers for

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.430
certain tasks.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.090
They have demonstrated with a
quantum computer that it can

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.760
perform a computation
in seconds.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.700
What would take the
world's fastest supercomputer?

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.830
Years, thousands of years to
do that same calculation.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.420
And in the field, this is
known as quantum supremacy and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.400
it's a really
important milestone.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.750
Google used a 53 qubit
processor named Sycamore to complete

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.750
the computation, a
completely arbitrary mathematical

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.120
problem with no
real world application.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.870
The Google Quantum computer spit out
an answer in about 200

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.020
seconds. It would have taken
the world's fastest computer

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.230
around 10000 years to come up
with a solution, according to

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.250
Google scientists.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.040
With that, Google claimed it had
won the race to quantum

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.490
supremacy. But IBM had an
issue with the findings.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.930
Yes, IBM, the storied tech
company that helped usher in

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.770
giant mainframes and
personal computing.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.520
It's a major player
in quantum computing.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.450
IBM said one of its
massive supercomputer networks, this

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.090
one at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratories in Tennessee,

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.330
could simulate a quantum
computer and theoretically solve

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.930
the same problem in a matter
of days, not the 10000 years

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.960
that Google had claimed. Either
way, it was a huge

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.140
milestone for quantum computers,
and Silicon Valley is

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.410
taking notice. Venture capital
investors are pouring

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.080
hundreds of millions of
dollars into quantum computing

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.620
startups, even though practical
applications are years or

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.200
even decades away by 2019.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.870
Private investors have backed
at least 52 quantum

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.650
technology companies around the
world since 2012, according

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.330
to an analysis by nature.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.150
Many of them were spun
out of research teams at

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.150
universities in 2017 and 2018.

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.110
Companies received at least $450
million in private funding

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.780
more than four times the
funding from the previous two

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.320
years. That's nowhere near the
amount of funding going into

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.270
a field like
artificial intelligence.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.070
About $9.3

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.830
billion with a venture capital
money poured into AI firms

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.400
in 2018. But the growth
in quantum computing funding is

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.500
happening quickly for an
industry without a real

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.790
application. Yet it is not easy
to figure out how to

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.120
actually use a quantum computer
to do something useful.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.530
So nature gives you this very,
very bizarre hammer in the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:17.830
form of these this interference
effect among all of these

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.170
amplitudes. Right.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.410
And it's up to us as
quantum computer scientists to figure

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.870
out what nails that
hammer can hit.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.050
That's leading to some backlash
against the hype and

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.600
concern that quantum computing could
soon become a bubble

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.600
and then dry up just
as fast if progress stalls.

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.660
Quantum computers are
also notoriously fickle.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.510
They need tightly controlled
environments to operate in.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.900
Changes in nearby temperatures
and electromagnetic waves

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.250
can cause them to mess up.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.740
And then there's the temperature
of the quantum chips

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.500
themselves. They need to be
kept at temperatures colder

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.700
than interstellar space, close
to absolute zero.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.890
One of the central tenets
of quantum physics is called

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.280
superposition. That means a
subatomic particle like an

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.130
electron can exist in two
different states at the same

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.390
time. It was and still is
super hard for normal computers

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.540
to simulate quantum mechanics
because of superposition.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.840
No, it was only in the
early eighties that a few

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.920
physicists, such as Richard
Feynman had the amazing

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.000
suggestion that if nature is
giving us that computational

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.400
lemon, well, why not
make it into lemonade?

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.460
You've probably heard or read
this explanation of how a

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.810
quantum computer works.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.200
Regular or classical computers
run on bits.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.430
Bits can either be a
1 or a zero.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.320
Quantum computers, on the other
hand, run on quantum bits

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:48.550
or cubits. Cubits can be either 1
or zero or both or a

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.530
combination of the two
at the same time.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.860
That's not wrong per say,
but it only scratches the

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.650
surface. According to Scott
Aaronson, who teaches computer

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.530
science and quantum computing at
the University of Texas in

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.620
Austin. We asked him to
explain how quantum computing

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.990
actually works. Well, let
me start with this.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:08.460
You never hear your weather
forecaster say we know there's

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.040
a negative 30 percent
chance of rain tomorrow.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.400
Right. That would just
be non-sense, right?

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.480
Did the chance of something
happening, as always, between 0

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.950
percent and 100 percent.

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.900
But now quantum mechanics is
based on numbers called

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.680
amplitudes. Amplitudes can be
positive or negative.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.340
In fact, they can even
be complex numbers involving the

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:31.960
square root of negative one.

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.970
So so a qubit is a bit
that has an amplitude for being zero

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.310
and another amplitude
for being one.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.460
The goal for quantum computers
is to make sure the

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.670
amplitudes leading to wrong answers
cancel each other out.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.100
And it scientists reading the
output of the quantum

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.040
computers are left with amplitudes
leading to the right

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:53.500
answer of whatever problem
they're trying to solve.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.350
So what does a quantum computer
look like in the real

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.350
world? The quantum computers developed
by companies such as

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:02.800
Google, IBM and Rigetti were
all made using a process

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.480
called superconducting

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.710
And this is where you have a
chip the size of an ordinary

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.720
computer chip and you have little
coils of wire in the

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.720
chip, you know, which are
actually quite enormous by the

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.830
standards of cubits.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:19.960
There are, you know, nearly big
enough to see with the

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:24.760
naked eye. But you can have
two different quantum states of

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:27.640
current that are flowing
through these coils that

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:30.010
correspond to a zero or a one.

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.070
And of course, you can also
have super positions of the

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.240
two. Now the coil can
interact with each other via

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.070
something called
Josef's injunctions.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.510
So they're laid out in roughly
a rectangular array and the

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.130
nearby ones can talk to
each other and thereby generate

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:50.820
these very complicated states,
what we call entangled

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.850
states, which is one of
the essentials of quantum computing

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.000
and the way that the cubists
interact with each other is

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.320
fully programmable.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.030
OK. So you can send electrical
signals to the chip to say

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.330
which cube it should interact with
each other ones at which

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:12.280
time. Now the order for this
to work, the whole chip is

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.770
placed in that
evolution refrigerator.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.780
That's the size of
a closet roughly.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.600
And the calls it do about
one hundredth of a degree above

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.750
absolute zero. That's where
you get the superconductivity

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.800
that allows these bits to
briefly behave as cubits.

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:35.470
And IBM's research lab in
Yorktown Heights, New York, the

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:38.470
big tech company, houses
several quantum computers already

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.350
hooked up to the cloud.
Corporate clients such as Goldman

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:45.130
Sachs and JP Morgan are part
of IBM's Q Network, where they

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.170
can experiment with the
quantum machines and their

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:48.250
programming language.

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.520
So far, it's a way for
companies to get used to quantum

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.530
computing rather than make
money from it.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.500
Quantum computers need exponentially
more cubits before

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:58.090
they start doing
anything useful.

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.840
IBM recently unveiled a fifty
three cubic computer the same

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.700
size as Google's
sycamore processor.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.570
We think we're actually going
to need tens of thousands,

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.540
hundreds of thousands of qubits
to get to real business

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.550
problems. So you can see quite
a lot of advances and

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:16.510
doubling every year or perhaps even
a little faster is what

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.150
we need to get us there. That's
why it's 10 years out, at

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:21.060
least.

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.630
Quantum computing would need to
see some big advances

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:25.390
between then and now, bigger
advances than what occurred

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.220
during the timeline of classical
computing and Moore's Law.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:30.400
Oh, we need better
than Moore's Law.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.230
Moore's Law is doubling
every two years.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:34.160
We're talking doubling
every year.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.310
And occasionally some
really big jumps.

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:38.710
So what's quantum
computers become useful?

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.890
What can they do? Scientists first
came up with the idea

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:44.950
for quantum computers as a
way to better simulate quantum

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.560
mechanics. That's still the
main purpose for them.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.900
And it also holds
the most moneymaking potential.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:52.840
So one example is
the caffeine molecule.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:58.000
Now, if you're like me,
you've probably ingested billions

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.530
or trillions of. Caffeine
molecules so far today.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.060
Now, if computers are really
that good, really that

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.000
powerful. We have these
these tremendous supercomputers

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:11.150
that are out there. We should
be able to really take a

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.080
molecule and represented exactly
in a computer.

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:18.020
And this would be great
for many fields, health care,

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.170
pharmaceuticals, creating new
materials, creating new

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.920
flavorings anywhere where molecules
are in play.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.520
So if we just start with
this basic idea of caffeine, it

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.540
turns out it's absolutely
impossible to represent one

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.200
simple little caffeine molecule
in a classical computer

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:39.440
because the amount of information
you would need to

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.620
represent it, the number of zeros
and ones you would need

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.560
is around ten to forty eight.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.520
Now, that's a big number. That's
one with forty eight zeros

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:55.250
following it. The number of atoms
in the earth are about 10

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.690
to 100 times that number.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:02.210
So in the worst case, one
caffeine molecule could use 10

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:06.260
percent of all the atoms in
the earth just for storage.

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:08.120
That's never going to happen.

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:11.680
However, if we have a quantum
computer with one hundred and

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:15.980
sixty cubits and this is a
model of a 50 kubert machine

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:18.770
behind me, you can kind of
figure, well, if we make good

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:22.730
progress, eventually we'll get up
to 160 good cubits.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.960
It looks like we'll be able
to do something with caffeine,

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.170
a quantum computer, and it's
never going to be possible.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.200
Classical computer and other potential
use comes from Wall

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.710
Street. Complex risk analysis
and economic forecasting.

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.770
Quantum computing also has
big potential for portfolio

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.220
optimization. Perhaps the biggest
business opportunity out

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.980
of quantum computing in the
short term is simply preparing

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:47.330
for the widespread
use of them.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.930
Companies and governments are
already attempting to quantum

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.390
proof their most sensitive
data and secrets.

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.890
In 1994, a scientist at Bell
Labs named Peter Shaw came up

00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:00.170
with an algorithm that
proved quantum computers could

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.020
factor huge numbers much more
quickly than their classical

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.710
counterparts. That also means
quantum computers is powerful

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.530
and efficient enough could
theoretically break RSA

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:12.740
encryption. RSA is the type
of encryption that underpins

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:14.000
the entire internet.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.730
Quantum computers, the way they're
built now, would need

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:19.430
millions of cubits to
crack RSA cryptography.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.910
But that milestone could be 20
or 30 years away and

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:25.070
governments and companies are beginning
to get ready for

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.170
it. For a lot of
people, that doesn't matter.

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:30.170
But for example, for health
records, if health records to

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:32.630
be opened up that could
compromise all kinds of things.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:34.180
Government communications.
Banking records.

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:36.050
Sometimes even banking records
from decades ago contain

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:37.750
important information that you
don't want exposed.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.280
But the problem we've got is
we don't really know when

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.730
we'll be able to do this or
even if we'll ever build one

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.110
big enough to do this.

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:50.380
But what we do now, is
that if you don't update your

00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:53.720
cryptography now, all the messages
you send over the next

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:57.210
few years and the ones
in history could potentially be

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:02.050
read. What this means, for example,
is if you're a Cisco

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.730
selling networking equipment, you're
going to offer

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:08.120
quantum-safe encryption as an option
in the very near

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:10.820
future. Becayse even though it
doesn't look like you need

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.770
it right away. If your product
doesn't have it and a

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:16.130
competitor does, guess which
product gets bought?

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.590
One big issue facing
quantum computing, other than

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:27.570
increasing the number of
cubits while keeping things

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.630
stable, is that no one actually
knows the best way to build

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:33.710
a quantum computer. Yet the
Quantum computers, a Google of

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.110
IBM and other companies show
off are very much still

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:39.990
experiments. There's also a
big education gap.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.680
Not many people are
studying quantum computing yet.

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.690
China is pouring billions
into quantum computing education,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:48.660
and the U.S. Congress passed a
law in 2018 called the

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.900
National Quantum Initiative Act in
order to help catch up

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.590
watching people get
rid of him.

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.680
Which means that you want
to invest in them now.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.980
You want to be hiring
people with quantum computing

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.860
knowledge. Not necessarily to
do quantum computing, but

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.520
because you want that intelligence
in your organisation so

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.150
you can take advantage of
it when it shows up.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.490
Now China, with its promised $10
billion in it, is really

00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.750
upping stakes in terms of
the number of Chinese quantum

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.420
physics PhDs that are
going to start appearing.

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:22.490
And you know if that
hair restoration or life extension

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:25.820
drug happens to be property
of the Chinese government, what

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:27.650
does that do to
the world economy?

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:34.290
That's much more powerful than
making war Other experts

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:37.050
have compared Google's announcement
to Sputnik, the Soviet

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.540
satellite launched into
orbit in 1957.

00:14:40.850 --> 00:14:43.730
The beach ball sized satellite
was the first manmade object

00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:47.530
to orbit the Earth. But
Sputnik didn't really do anything

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:50.260
useful other than prove launching
something into space was

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:56.620
possible. Many people are surprised
that where exactly we

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:00.580
are. For those who are just
getting started, they like to

00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:04.360
make noise about vacuum tubes
and Sputnik and things like

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.540
this. But let me
give you some numbers.

00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.770
IBM has had quantum computers on
the cloud for three and a

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.860
half years since May of 2016.

00:15:15.190 --> 00:15:18.460
We're not in any
sort of Sputnik error.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.320
We're not landing on the moon.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.620
But for those of you who
like space history, I think we're

00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:26.800
probably well into
Mercury or Gemini.
