00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.190
airport security with Clear.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.780
Airlines are notoriously difficult businesses
to run.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.840
Each and every flight operated is a multi-thousand
dollar gamble on whether or not passengers

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.380
will buy tickets.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.620
Aside from cost, the strongest factor for
customers on which flight they will take is

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.670
often the overall travel time so airlines
put enormous effort into properly assembling

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.160
their puzzle of flights so they can offer
the shortest connection time possible.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.579
With so many destinations all across the world,
it’s just natural that most routes require

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.950
connections so airlines need to attract connecting
passengers in order to stay in business.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.590
Now, most flight connections for traditional
airlines happen out of their hub airports.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.030
American Airlines, for example, has 10 across
the United States and every single one of

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.320
their flights either begins or ends at these
airports, but not all hubs are created equal.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.620
Charlotte Douglas, Reagan National, and Laguardia
are largely built for north-south traffic

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.189
and terminating traffic.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:08.549
Miami is for connecting North American travelers
to flights to the Caribbean and South America.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.799
Philadelphia is a bit of a hybrid hub connecting
both north-south traffic and North American

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.049
traffic onto flights to Europe.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.939
JFK is the major hub for connecting North
American traffic to European flights.

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.529
And the Los Angeles hub’s main purpose is
to connect North American traffic to Asia

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:26.200
and Oceania bound flights, but then there
are these three—Chicago O’Hare, Dallas

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.860
Fort Worth, and Phoenix Sky Harbor airports.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.509
These three airports are the truly important
connection airports since they lie between

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.149
the coasts and their schedules reflect this.

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:39.759
The east-west routes are the most competitive
in the United States so American has to offer

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.770
short connections in order to dominate the
market.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.700
So what American Airlines has done is that
they’ve banked their hubs.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.740
What this means is that, for the most part,
all their flights arrive and depart at roughly

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.249
the same time.

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:57.179
For example, on any given Wednesday in the
fall the Philadelphia flight will arrive at

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:04.109
11:14 am, then the Atlanta flight at 11:17,
the DC one at 11:29, and the Nashville flight

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:05.109
at 11:45.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.700
Then, at 12:40 the flight to Denver leaves,
at 12:45 the one to Las Vegas, at 1:00 the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.530
one to San Francisco, and at 1:10 the flight
to Los Angeles.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.870
This way, nobody has to wait longer than two
hours to connect.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.670
Almost every flight American operates in and
out of DFW falls into one of their 10 daily

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.670
banks.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.450
This is how the airline gets those connecting
passengers—by offering shorter connection

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.450
times.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.040
Nearby Dallas Love Field is Southwest Airlines’
main hub but it operates in an entirely different

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.040
way.

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.211
It just has planes arriving and leaving at
a consistent average of about 8-12 flights

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:47.650
per hour all day long and there’s a good
reason for this—Southwest is a budget airline.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.010
Banked hubs are significantly more expensive
to run because they require more resources.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.500
The airline needs to have enough equipment,
people, and gates to turn around all their

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.660
planes at the same time.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.810
If the planes came in at a smooth pace all
the people and equipment could be used continuously

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.849
but at a banked hub, the airline still needs
to pay for their people and equipment during

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.590
the down-time between the banks.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.689
If a plane leaves Philadelphia bound for DC
at 9:30 with the 9-10 am bank it will arrive

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:22.260
around 10 am but it will have to wait to leave
until about 11:15 to time its arrival with

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.290
the 11:45-12:45 bank.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.370
Planes cost money whether they’re in the
air or sitting on the ground so having planes

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.390
wait around to time with banks costs money
too.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.389
This is why a budget airline will never schedule
their planes to sit on the ground during the

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.109
day for more than an hour.

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:43.299
Once a plane lands, it immediately loads up
and takes off again as soon as possible.

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.900
For this reason, the planes of a budget airline
like Spirit Airlines are in the air for an

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.999
average of 11 hours per day while American
airlines only uses their planes for an average

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.250
of 8.5 hours per day.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.870
Banked hubs can also make delays more probable.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.629
When there are so many planes going out at
once an airport might just not be able to

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:03.020
cope with the surge in activity.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.879
If a thunderstorm hits the airport, for example,
a whole bank of flights might be delayed or

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.030
cancelled which would create a knock-on effect
all across the country.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.130
These banking systems are essentially higher
risk, higher reward in terms of delays, but

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.049
some airlines have taken the banked hub concept
to an extreme.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.169
Etihad Airways’s hub in Abu Dhabi essentially
operates with just two big banks a day.

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.860
Almost all their fights from the west arrive
between 7:00 and 8:30 pm then eastbound flights

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.849
depart between 9:30 and 10:30 pm.

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.550
Flights coming in from the east land between
about 11:30 pm and 12:30 am and then the final

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.250
bank of westbound flights departs between
2:00 and 3:30 am.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.660
With this system, almost every flight from
Europe or the US can connect to a flight to

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.410
Asia or Australia in no more than three hours.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.520
The whole operation also takes about eight
and a half hours—perfectly timed for one

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.520
work shift.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.080
But of course, however, this leads to a lot
of planes sitting around.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.250
Their flight to Hong Kong, for example, departs
at 9:50 pm Abu Dhabi time and arrives at 10:05

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.389
am Hong Kong time.

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.800
The plane then has to sit around until 6:55
pm in order to time it’s arrival with the

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.599
rest of the westbound bank.

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.150
That’s almost nine hours of waiting, but
in order to schedule flights correctly, its

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.700
fairly typical for planes to sit around.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.530
Flights from North to South America are notoriously
tricky to schedule.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.330
Sao Paolo, Brazil is only one hour ahead of
New York during daylight saving time so southbound

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.349
flights tend to leave in the evening and arrive
10 hours later in the morning.

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.139
But the tricky part is when the flight should
return.

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:45.139
If the flight left at 7 pm and arrived the
following morning at 6 am it could turn around

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:50.039
and fly back at 9 am and arrive at 6 pm but
the airline doesn’t want to do that.

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:54.440
The problem is that airlines rely heavily
on connecting traffic to fill their flights

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.379
and by the time arriving travelers got off
the plane and make it through customs it would

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:04.229
be 7:30 pm at best by which time the majority
of flights have left for the night.

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:08.639
Airlines therefore almost universally decide
to leave their planes on the ground in South

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.330
America all day to fly back overnight so travelers
can connect onwards to their final destination

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:15.770
on morning flights.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.789
This is likely part of the reason why flights
from North to South America are so expensive.

00:06:20.789 --> 00:06:25.669
But some of the airlines have found a way
to take advantage of the time on the ground.

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.379
Labor is significantly cheaper in South America
so airlines have started to perform maintenance

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:34.759
work on planes while they’re waiting around
for the evening flight back.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:40.780
American Airlines, for example, recently started
building an $100 million hanger in Sao Paolo

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.180
to support their maintenance operations there.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:47.870
Qantas made a similar move to take advantage
of time on the ground by opening up an a380

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.630
sized maintenance hanger in Los Angeles for
their planes that sometimes sit there for

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.449
up to 14 hours, but that’s not the only
trick Qantas has up its sleeves.

00:06:56.449 --> 00:07:01.419
Australia is just so isolated that no plane
can currently fly non-stop from the country

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:03.259
to the US east coast.

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:08.500
The US west coast, however, is close enough
that a plane can make it in a 12-14 hour flight

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:13.699
so Qantas has non-stop flights from Melbourne,
Sydney, and Brisbane to Los Angeles.

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:18.840
The trick is that they are all scheduled to
arrive between about 6:00 and 6:30 am then,

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:24.000
at 8:20 AM one of the planes continues on
to New York with the passengers booked through.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.430
This is known as a scissor hub.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:30.130
WestJet airlines operates an even more advanced
one in St John’s Canada.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:36.180
They have flights arriving from Orlando, Toronto,
and Ottawa all around 9:30-10:00 pm then just

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.370
past 11:00 pm their flights to Dublin and
London leave.

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:44.410
This way they can fly six routes with just
three planes and, even better for them, since

00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:50.189
it’s only a 4.5 hour flight from St John’s
to the British Isles they can fly small, inexpensive

00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:53.289
single aisle planes transatlantic.

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:57.189
All of these scheduling patterns and tricks
serve to help an airline achieve it’s ultimate

00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:59.669
goal—to maximize revenue.

00:07:59.669 --> 00:08:04.480
In this industry, time truly is money since
planes cost money and people pay more to fly

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:13.889
faster so few aspects of the business are
as important as properly scheduling flights.

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:17.909
If you like spending less time at airports
one way is to fly with shorter connections,

00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:20.330
but perhaps the easiest way is to use Clear.

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.330
I tried them out for myself on a recent trip
and the footage speaks for itself.

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:28.979
CLEAR uses biometrics to replace the TSA id
check so you always go straight to to either

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:32.390
the PreCheck or regular screening without
waiting in line.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:37.030
As you can see here, it took me exactly one
minute and seven seconds to go from walking

00:08:37.030 --> 00:08:40.150
in the door of Laguardia to getting into security.

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:43.700
The X-ray was completely backed up with a
few people in wheelchairs when I went through

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:48.150
but that's actually a good thing because what
I am showing you here is the absolute worst

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:51.050
case scenario—the slowest security with
clear will be.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:55.380
I put my camera in my bag during the screening
so the TSA agents wouldn't yell at me but

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.350
the timer is still running.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:02.040
So, even with all that back-up at the x-ray
I went from walking through the door to the

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.600
gate in seven minutes.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:10.220
The good news is that the first 200 people
to sign up over at clearme.com/wendover get

00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:16.090
to speed through airports security at Clear’s
24 US airports for free for three months.

00:09:16.090 --> 00:09:21.440
That is not a publicly available trial so
it’s worth signing up while it’s available.

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:28.130
Once again, that’s clearme.com/wendover
for three free months of faster airport security.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.700
