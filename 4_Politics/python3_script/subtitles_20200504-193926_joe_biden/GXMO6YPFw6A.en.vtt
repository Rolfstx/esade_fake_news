00:11:43.209 --> 00:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
here although this is not what he moved
I<00:11:43.420><c> think</c><00:11:44.110><c> that</c><00:11:44.259><c> he</c><00:11:44.350><c> has</c><00:11:44.619><c> to</c><00:11:44.649><c> play</c><00:11:45.069><c> Bishop</c><00:11:45.399><c> takes</c>

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:45.850 align:start position:0%
I think that he has to play Bishop takes
