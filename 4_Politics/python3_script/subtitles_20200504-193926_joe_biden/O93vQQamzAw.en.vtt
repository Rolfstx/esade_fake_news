00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.330
We are back with Trevor Noah.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.800
So do you watch--

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.870
And I also saw you
talk about on the news

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.080
that you can't watch the
news that much because it's

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.790
too depressing.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.832
You watch in the morning.

00:00:11.832 --> 00:00:13.260
You get a little recap at night.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.110
But you must be having to
keep up with it for your show.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:17.610
Yes.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.710
I keep up with
information, but I

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.630
think people must be careful
about what they watch as news.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.890
You know, one thing that
is an unfortunate byproduct

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.630
of having 24-hour
news in America

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.800
is always full of the news.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.230
And so I always warn people.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.140
I go like, be careful not
to just watch the news

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.550
all the time
because the news can

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.650
make it seem like
everything is going wrong.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.840
Because the news' job
is to report the things

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.080
that are going wrong.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.280
And so whether it's chicken or
the egg, or egg or the chicken,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.150
it's either way you're only
going to be getting bad news.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.900
So I think you should
be careful to ration

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.010
how much news you watch.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.343
And so that's what I try and do.

00:00:51.343 --> 00:00:52.860
I try to read as
much as possible.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.740
I try and ascertain
what's actually

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.190
happening in the world.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.033
But I think it's good
to have perspective.

00:01:00.033 --> 00:01:01.950
I think it's good to
live in a world of nuance

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.443
where we say, yes, something
bad can be happening,

00:01:05.443 --> 00:01:07.860
but it's not the worst thing,
because we're helping it not

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.970
become the worst thing.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.510
And hopefully, on the
other side of this,

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.635
we realize that we're better
off because we treated

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:15.810
it seriously as opposed to not
taking it seriously, and then

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.880
regretting it afterwards.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.160
So that's all I'm trying to do
in my world, process the news,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.140
make jokes about it,
give it to my audience.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.530
And hopefully, have people
a little more informed

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.390
and just feeling a
little bit better

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.630
about what they're watching
because it's not all bad news.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.130
Yes.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.370
No, no, it's not.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.200
And what you're doing
is really important.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.400
And then I do something that is
just ridiculously silly and--

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.660
Which is equally important.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.740
Well, yes.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.470
Yes.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:45.970
For sure.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.250
And I talk to Gavin Newsom.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.077
And I'm talking
to people to help

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:52.160
spread the word on some
things that are important.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.030
And I know obviously,
that's mainly what you do.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.670
So what are your thoughts
on Sanders dropping out

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.350
and endorsing Biden?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.080
I think it's great to see
the Democrats moving together

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.020
in unison.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.930
I was really happy to see that.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.840
And I was also really happy
to see Biden specifically

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.522
say, hey, we're going to be
engaging Bernie's policies.

00:02:10.522 --> 00:02:11.980
I'm going to look
at what we can do

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.272
to bring in more of his people.

00:02:13.272 --> 00:02:15.940
Because I think it's important
for leaders to realize

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.670
you're not just the leader of
the people who voted for you.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.790
You're the leader of everyone
that you end up leading.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.320
And so in many ways, I think
of it like being a parent.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.892
You have your kids, and then
when your kid has a birthday

00:02:28.892 --> 00:02:30.350
party, there's all
these other kids

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.642
who want to come to your house.

00:02:31.642 --> 00:02:33.250
And they're not
your kids, but you

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.373
should treat them
with the same love

00:02:35.373 --> 00:02:37.540
and respect that you would
your kids because they're

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.123
in your house.

00:02:38.123 --> 00:02:39.998
And I think that's what
a president is doing.

00:02:39.998 --> 00:02:41.650
You have all these
kids in your house,

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.567
and hopefully you're
giving them the best love

00:02:43.567 --> 00:02:45.610
and care that they need.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.285
You should know Ellen doesn't
allow kids in her house.

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:49.470
[LAUGHING]

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.370
That's why I'm not a
politician or a parent.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.190
I don't want them.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.720
I've never been
happier because I'm

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.428
hearing all these
parents go, oh my, God.

00:03:00.428 --> 00:03:02.890
I'm home schooling, and I
don't know anything about--

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.700
they were just counting on the
teachers to teach their kids,

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.910
and now they have to learn how
to teach their kids at home.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.970
And I can't even
imagine anything harder

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.980
than having to teach--

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.975
Yes, and if anybody
deserves more money, it's--

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:18.940
I think those are
two professions

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.190
that we're learning to
appreciate now more than ever.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.040
It's teachers, and
it's people who

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.980
work in jobs that people
haven't considered essential,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.850
and yet now are.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.400
You know, people who work in
grocery stores, people who work

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.870
on farms producing our food.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.090
We couldn't stay at home
if it weren't for them.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.460
And so once we have
these conversations again

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.040
about how much people should
get paid as a minimum wage,

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.570
and once we have
conversations again

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.670
about teachers
getting paid, I hope

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.580
every parent remembers
this moment in time when

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:46.940
their kids go back to school.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.410
No, I absolutely think
everybody feels the same way.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.740
That it's going to be all
these people that you really

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.240
underappreciated.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.330
Trevor, you call
yourself a Cuomosexual,

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.590
and I agree with you.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.920
I feel like I'm a
Cuomosexual too.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.820
Yes, I think it's been really--

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.710
it genuinely has been very
inspiring and refreshing to see

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.857
a leader like Cuomo.

00:04:12.857 --> 00:04:14.440
Andrew Cuomo, the
governor of New York

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.950
who's come out and
engaged his briefings

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.850
in a nonpolitical way.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.100
He's engaged them as a leader.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.640
He's engaged them
as a human being.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.240
He's also taken the blame for
things where he says, look,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.910
I understand that I'm doing
certain things that people

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.410
are going to hate
me for, and I'm

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:31.960
willing to make these decisions
because I think it's the best

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.730
thing for human life first.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.260
We can always create
business afterwards.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.140
I think he's been informative.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.760
I think he's been informed.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.898
And once I saw people online
falling in love with him--

00:04:42.898 --> 00:04:44.440
there's a group of
women who came out

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.872
and they said we're
falling in love with Cuomo.

00:04:46.872 --> 00:04:47.830
And I said, well, yeah.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.860
Everyone should be a
Cuomosexual in that way.

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.435
You should love a leader
who engages the people,

00:04:53.435 --> 00:04:55.810
and remembers that they're
serving the people, as opposed

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.670
to the people working for them.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:02.020
So any leader who's doing that
in a crisis, I applaud them.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.540
The bar for leaders
these days is very low.

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.930
We just want someone
to tell us the truth.

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.930
That's all we're asking.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.330
Just tell us the truth.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.900
And if you do that,
you're a great leader.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.980
Well, he's exceptional though.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.900
I mean, I think that Governor
Cuomo, and Chris his brother,

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.830
God bless him.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.333
I love him so much.

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:25.000
I think everyone is
just falling in love

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.350
with people who are doing their
jobs the way they should right

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.950
now.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.700
People are falling in
love with governors,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.330
whether it's Newsome,
whether it's Cuomo.

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.590
People are falling in
love with Dr. Fauci.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.540
He's just a doctor
who's doing his thing.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.250
People try and make it
seem like he has an agenda.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.910
He wants this.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:43.330
He wants that.

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.080
No, he's a doctor.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.180
He gives you the
information, and the leaders

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.830
do with the information
as they please.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.890
And I think it's exciting
to see people wanting

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.960
to just do their jobs well.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.260
That's a really
cool thing to see.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.160
Yes.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.130
I love talking to
you, and I miss you,

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.350
and I will see you whenever we
get to see each other again.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.000
Stay safe.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.930
The Daily Show airs weeknights
at 11:00 on Comedy Central.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.457
Thank you so much, Trevor.

00:06:09.457 --> 00:06:10.790
Thank you so much for having me.

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.040
And stay safe out there, Andy.

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.787
Please don't break
any more plants.

00:06:13.787 --> 00:06:15.070
[LAUGHING]

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:16.210
Thank you, Trevor.

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.967
Hi, I'm Andy.

00:06:16.967 --> 00:06:19.300
Ellen asked me to remind you
to subscribe to her channel

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.140
so you can see more
awesome videos,

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.250
like videos of me getting scared
or saying embarrassing things,

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.100
like ball peen hammer, and
also some videos of Ellen

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.530
and other celebrities if
you're into that sort of

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.130
Ah!
