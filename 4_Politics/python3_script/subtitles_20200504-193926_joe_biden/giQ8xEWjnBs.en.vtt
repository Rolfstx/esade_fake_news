00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:05.120
This episode of Real Engineering is brought
to you by Brilliant, a problem solving website

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.870
that teaches you to think like an engineer.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:14.170
On the 24th of May, SpaceX launched a Falcon
9 rocket filled with 60 satellites into space.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.550
This marked the beginning of their ambitious
new project called “Starlink” which aims

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.920
to provide high quality broadband internet
to the most isolated parts of the planet,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.880
while also providing low latency connectivity
to already well connected cities.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.850
[1] SpaceX aim to make their broadband as
accessible as possible, claiming that anyone

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.489
will be able to connect to their network if
they buy the pizza box-sized antenna which

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.079
SpaceX is developing themselves.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.109
This launch of 60 satellites, was just the
first of many.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.739
Spacex has 12,000 satellites [12] planned
for launch over the next decade, dramatically

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.219
increasing the total amount of spacecraft
around Earth’s orbit.

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.999
This will cost SpaceX billions of dollars,
so they must have a good reason for doing

00:00:58.999 --> 00:00:59.999
so.

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.580
Let’s see how this network will work, and
how it will compete with existing internet

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.930
providers.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.400
Back in 2015, Elon announced that SpaceX had
began working on a communication satellite

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.750
network, stating that there is a significant
unmet demand for low-cost global broadband

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.090
capabilities.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.670
Around that time, SpaceX opened a new facility
in Redmond, Washington to develop and manufacture

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.240
these new communication satellites.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.340
The initial plan was to launch two prototype
satellites into orbit by 2016 and have the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.359
initial satellite consetllation up and running
by 2020.

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:39.659
But the company struggled to develop a receiver
that could be easily installed by the user

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.920
for a low cost, this delayed the program and
the initial prototype satellites weren’t

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.880
launched until 2018.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.320
After a successful launch of the two prototypes,
Tintin-A and B, which allowed SpaceX to test

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.060
and refine their satellite design, SpaceX
kept pretty quiet about what was next for

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.810
the Starlink project, until November 2018
when SpaceX received the approval from the

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:10.780
FCC to deploy 7,500 satellites into orbit,
on top of the 4,400 that were already approved.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.760
On May 24th, the first batch of production
satellites were launched into orbit and people

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.060
around the world quickly started to spot the
train of satellites moving across the night

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.060
sky.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.980
This launch is a sign of things to come, while
this initial group of satellites are not fully

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.610
functional [8], they will be used to test
things like the earth communications systems

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.220
and the krypton thrusters which will be used
to autonomously avoid debris and de-orbit

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.280
the spacecraft once it has reached the end
of its lifecycle.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.489
Let’s look at these functionalities first.

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.500
We have explored how ion thrusters work in
the past, which you can watch for more detail,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.760
but essentially they use electric potential
to fire ions out of the spacecraft to provide

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.760
propulsion.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.930
Xenon is ideally used, because it has a high
atomic mass allowing it to provide more kick

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.290
per atom, while being inert and having a high
storage density lending itself to long term

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.250
storage on a spacecraft.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.340
However SpaceX opted for krypton, as xenon’s
rarity makes it a far more expensive propellant.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.989
[2] This ion thruster will initially be used
to raise the starlink satellites from their

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.150
release orbits at 440 km to their final orbital
height of 550 km[1].

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.140
They will also be used in conjunction with
on board control momentum gyroscopes located

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.629
here, and the US Governments’ space debris
collision prediction system to allow the satellites

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.689
to adjust their orbits to dodge collisions,
which we have also spoken about in more detail

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.280
in a previous video.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.379
When the satellites have reached the end of
their service life they can then use the same

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.129
attitude controls and thrusters to de-orbit
the satellite.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:53.280
Space X have included all the necessary hardware
to minimise space debris risk.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.700
In their Federal Communications Commission
approval application [3], they claim that

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.430
95% of the satellite will burn up on re-entry.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.340
With only the ion thruster internal structure
and silicon carbide components, standing a

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.939
chance of survival.

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:12.620
Those silicon carbide components are likely
to survive, as they are essential materials

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.460
for the operation of lasers and thus have
an extremely high melting point of 2,750°C.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.980
[9]

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.280
Which brings us to our communications abilities,
the primary function of the satellite.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.610
Spacex have been tight lipped on many of the
details of the satellite, but thanks to that

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.130
FCC filing [3] we know that the satellites
will contain 5 1.5 kilogram silicon carbide

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.940
components, which indicates that each satellite
will contain 5 individual lasers.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.350
These lasers, like our fibre optic cables
here on earth, will use light pulses to transmit

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:49.320
information between satellites.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.830
Transmitting with light in space offers one
massive advantage over transmitting with light

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.630
here on earth however.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:02.760
The speed of light is not constant in every
material, in fact, light travels 47% slower

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.070
in glass than in a vacuum.

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.320
This offers starlink one huge advantage that
will likely be it’s primary money maker.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.660
It provides the potential of lower latency
information over long distance, in simpler

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.200
terms let’s imagine this as a race between
data packets.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.120
A user in London wants the new adjusted price
of a stock on the NASDAQ from the New York

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.480
stock exchange.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.250
If this information were use a typical route,
let’s say through the AC-2 cable [RI-3],

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.400
which has a return journey of about 12,800
kilometres to make through our glass fibre

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.740
optic cable.

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:46.000
In a vacuum light travels at a speed of 299,792,458
meters per second [5].

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.220
The speed of travel in glass depends on the
refractive index and the refractive index

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:55.840
depends on wavelength, but we will take the
reduction as 1.47 times slower than the speed

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:57.210
of light in a vacuum [203940448 m/s].

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:03.970
[6] This means the data packet will take roughly
0.063 seconds to make the round trip, and

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:10.610
thus has a latency of 0.063 seconds, or 62.7
milliseconds.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.590
With the additional steps that add to this
latency like the conversion of light signals

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.530
to electrical signals on either end of the
optical cable, traffic queues, and the transfer

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:25.920
to our final computer terminal, this total
time comes out at about 76 milliseconds.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:30.370
Figuring out the latency for Starlink is a
lot more difficult, as we have no real world

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.530
measurements to go by, but we can make some
educated guesses with the help of Mark Handley,

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:38.880
a communications professor in University College
London.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:39.880
[10]

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.091
The first source of latency for Starlink will
be during the up and down link process, where

00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:47.440
we need to transfer our information to and
from earth.

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.030
We know this will be done with phase array
antenna, which are radio antenna that can

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:57.500
control the direction of their transmission
without moving parts, instead they use destructive

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.150
and constructive interference [7] to control
the direction of the radio wave.

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.130
Each satellite has a cone beam with a 81 degree
range of view.

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:12.240
With an orbit of 550 kilometres each satellite
can cover a circular area with a radius of

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.130
500 kilometre.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:20.110
At SpaceX’s originally planned orbit this
coverage had a radius of 1060 kilometres.

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.020
Lowering the altitude of a satellite decreases
the area it can cover, but also decreases

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.280
the latency.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.020
This is particularly noticeable for typical
communications satellites operating in geostationary

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.800
orbit at an altitude of about 36,000 kilometres.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.960
The time it takes data to travel up to the
satellite and back down travelling at the

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:47.730
speed of light is around 240 milliseconds
[13] 369% slower than our subsea cable.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:52.500
However, since Starlink is intending to operate
at a much lower altitude, the up and down

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:57.380
link theoretical latency could be as low as
3.6 ms.

00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.880
This is why SpaceX needs so many satellites
in their constellation in order to provide

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.860
worldwide coverage.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:09.600
Each individual starlink satellite has four
phased array antenna located here, here, here

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.600
and here.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.920
This directional beam was an essential part
of SpaceX’s FCC approval application [3],

00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:21.160
as thousands of satellites broadcasting undirected
radio waves would cause significant amounts

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.670
of interference with other communication methods.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:29.610
Once that data is received by one starlink
satellite, it can begin to transmit that information

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:32.120
between satellites using lasers.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:36.599
Each time we hop from satellites there will
be a small delay as the laser light is converted

00:08:36.599 --> 00:08:41.180
to an electric signal and back again, but
it is too miniscule to consider.

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.360
Things get tricky here with using lasers,
as we need to accurately hit the receiver

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.170
on neighbouring satellites to transmit that
data.

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.610
Let’s look at SpaceX’s proposed constellation
to see how this will work.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:09:01.240
Space X’s first phase of 1584 satellites
will occupy 24 orbital planes, with 66 satellites

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.990
in each plane inclined at 53 degrees.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.100
That will look something like this.

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:11.410
Communication between neighbouring satellites
in the same orbital plane is relatively simple,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:16.580
as these satellites will remain in relatively
stable positions in relation to each other.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:21.880
This gives us a solid line of communication
along a single orbital plane, but in many

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:28.370
cases a single orbital plane will not connect
two locations, so we need to be able transfer

00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:31.100
information between these planes too.

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.189
This requires precise tracking, as the satellites
travelling in neighbouring orbital planes

00:09:36.189 --> 00:09:40.459
are travelling incredibly quickly and will
come in and out of view.

00:09:40.459 --> 00:09:45.220
This means the starlink satellite will need
to switch to a new satellite in the network.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:49.470
This can take time, the best figure I could
find is about a minute [9] for the European

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:54.880
Space Agency’s Data Relay Satellite System,
which is a currently operating geostationary

00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.149
internet constellation designed to serve european
imaging satellites, and other time critical

00:10:00.149 --> 00:10:01.279
applications.

00:10:01.279 --> 00:10:06.649
Such as serving emergency forces in remote
areas, like those fighting forest fires.

00:10:06.649 --> 00:10:11.790
Starlink may be faster, but it won’t be
instantaneous, and thus it has 5 optical communication

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:17.199
systems on board to maintain a steady connection
to 4 satellites at all times.

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:22.040
If we now use this system, transmitting from
New York to London and back, with the shortest

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.930
path possible, using the speed of light in
a vacuum as our transfer speed, we can achieve

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.410
a latency as low as 43 milliseconds.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:35.420
Even if we took the shortest route possible
with an optic fibre, which does not exist,

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:40.240
this would take about 55 milliseconds, a 28%
decrease in speed.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:45.980
The actual current return trip time for your
average Joe is about 76 milliseconds, as we

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:46.980
saw earlier.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.860
A 77% decrease in speed.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.569
This is a huge deal for the two financial
markets working out of these cities, with

00:10:54.569 --> 00:10:59.040
millions of dollars being moved in fractions
of a second, having a lower latency would

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.040
provide a massive advantage in capitalizing
on price swings.

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.480
In fact, it wouldn’t be the first time a
communications company has made a massive

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:10.709
investment to specifically serve these groups.

00:11:10.709 --> 00:11:15.839
The Hibernian Express cable is a privately
owned optic cable that is currently the lowest

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:24.449
latency connection between the NY4 data centre
in Secaucus, New Jersey and the LD4 data centre

00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:30.700
in Slough, England at just 59.95 milliseconds,
39.4% slower than our best time with Starlink.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:35.540
[11] The previous best time was held by the
AC-1 cable at 65 milliseconds.

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:43.259
At a cost of 300 million dollars this 5 millisecond
increase in speed was justified to just connect

00:11:43.259 --> 00:11:45.079
across the Atlantic.

00:11:45.079 --> 00:11:50.480
Imagine how much these time sensitive industries
will be willing to pay for a 17 millisecond

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.809
increase in speed.

00:11:51.809 --> 00:11:57.249
It becomes even more valuable when you realise
this time differential increases with increased

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:58.860
transmission distance.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:02.149
New York to London is a relatively short distance.

00:12:02.149 --> 00:12:06.550
The improvements would be even more pronounced
for a London to Singapore transmission, for

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:11.410
every additional kilometre we travel the potential
gains in speed increase rapidly [5].

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:17.180
[RI-2] But SpaceX aren’t just planning on
serving this super fast internet to some customers,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:21.990
they primarily advertise this system as a
way to connect every human on this planet

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:26.860
to the internet, and they should have plenty
of bandwidth left over to serve these people.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:31.550
Although the internet has been one of the
fastest growing technologies in human history,

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:37.279
by the end of 2019 more than half of the world's
population will still be offline (4 billion).

00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:41.300
Users will connect to this internet using
a Starlink terminal which will cost around

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:47.079
$200 each, this will still be far outside
the purchasing power of many third world citizens,

00:12:47.079 --> 00:12:52.279
but it’s a start and vastly cheaper then
similar currently available receivers like

00:12:52.279 --> 00:12:54.839
the Kymeta version at a price of $30,000[15].

00:12:54.839 --> 00:13:00.170
Elon Musk says that these will be flat enough
to fit onto the roof of a car and other vehicles

00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:02.059
like ships and airplanes.

00:13:02.059 --> 00:13:05.809
This will allow Starlink to compete with traditional
internet providers.

00:13:05.809 --> 00:13:11.319
It’s estimated that moving the US from a
4G to a 5G wireless connection will cost around

00:13:11.319 --> 00:13:17.529
$150 billion in fiber optic cabling alone
over the next 7 years, [16] SpaceX plan to

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:21.879
complete their entire Stralink project for
as little as $10 billion.

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:26.990
Each Starlink satellite cost around $300,000
which is already a massive cut in cost for

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:28.439
communication satellites.

00:13:28.439 --> 00:13:33.519
SpaceX are also saving on launch costs, as
they are launching on their own Falcon 9 rocket,

00:13:33.519 --> 00:13:36.809
something that no other satellite manufacturer
has.

00:13:36.809 --> 00:13:42.410
If everything goes to plan, Starlink is estimated
to generate $30 billion to $50 billion in

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:48.009
revenue each year on the back of premium stock
exchange memberships [14], demolishing their

00:13:48.009 --> 00:13:51.290
current annual revenue of around $3 billion.

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:55.220
And this is a vital part of Elon Musk's long
term goals.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:59.869
The money generated from Starlink will mean
SpaceX will have vastly more funding than

00:13:59.869 --> 00:14:00.869
NASA.

00:14:00.869 --> 00:14:05.800
Which could go on to fund research and development
of new rockets and the technology needed to

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.749
monetise lunar and martian colonies.

00:14:08.749 --> 00:14:13.879
For now the project is simply connecting the
world even more and potentially opening avenues

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:19.189
for education for third world countries that
do not have adequate connections to the internet.

00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:23.829
Imagine if Leonal Messi, the greatest footballer
alive, was never found and brought to Barcelona

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:25.259
to develop his talents.

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:28.869
Where he received vital medical treatment
for growth hormone deficiency.

00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:33.589
We would have been deprived of his talents,
and this happens regular for remarkably talented

00:14:33.589 --> 00:14:38.589
and intelligent children in countries where
simply do not have access to education.

00:14:38.589 --> 00:14:43.170
Widely available internet will help solve
this problem, and platforms like Brilliant

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:48.369
have taken great steps to remedy this through
their high quality interactive math and science

00:14:48.369 --> 00:14:50.089
learning.

00:14:50.089 --> 00:14:54.860
Brilliant has helped thousands of users realize
their potential in math and science, and it’s

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.790
stories like this why I am proud to promote
Brilliant every month.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:03.040
They have a huge number of courses that will

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.990
Competition, with others geared for computer
science and physics.

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:15.249
Brilliant recently introduced a new feature,
called “Daily Challenges”, which will
