Please welcome Tomi Lahren.

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:07.407
-â™ª â™ª
-(cheering, applause)

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.275
Thanks. Thank you.

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.347
I'm in the lion's den, Trevor.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.182
I am not a lion at all.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:19.485
Is that, like, an African thing?
No. Um, welcome to the show.

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:22.388
Be-Before we get into it,
uh, I-I know who you are,

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:24.991
because I-I...
my Facebook feed has you in it.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.727
Uh, there are a lot of people
who don't, so if you don't

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.830
know Tomi Lahren, this is
a little taste of her show.

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:33.933
The protesters are still out in
force, but let's be honest--

00:00:33.966 --> 00:00:36.436
they're not protesters, they're
crybabies with nothing better

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:38.004
to do than meander
around the streets

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:39.772
with their participation
trophies and false sense

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:42.075
of purpose.
This isn't for Hillary.

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.976
I'm not even sure
this is against Trump.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:46.646
It's the same thing we've seen
time and time again

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:49.949
with these so-called
protesters and demonstrators.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:52.485
It started with
the Occupy Wall Street brats,

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:55.021
moved on to the more militant
and overtly aggressive

00:00:55.054 --> 00:00:56.522
Black Lives Matter More crowd,

00:00:56.555 --> 00:00:59.392
cycled through the DNC-paid
violence instigators

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.894
and now here we are,
November of 2016,

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:03.763
with President-elect
Donald Trump and a crowd

00:01:03.796 --> 00:01:06.065
of misfit babies formed from
every failed movement,

00:01:06.098 --> 00:01:07.900
all sandwiched together
to become the largest group

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:10.336
of whiners the country
has ever seen.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.439
-All right... -Pretty much
covers it, doesn't it, Trevor?

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:17.176
Quick question--
like, why are you so angry?

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.078 line:0%
I'm actually not that angry.
It's just there's things

00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:21.347 line:0%
that need to be said, Trevor,
and a lot of people

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.849 line:0%
-are afraid to say 'em.
-In an...

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:25.618
in an angry way. I mean,
you can't say you're not angry

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:27.887
and, I mean, this is-this is
what you're known for.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.789
It's a strange thing to say--
"I'm not angry"--

00:01:29.822 --> 00:01:31.858
but that is the one thing...
It's like Ellen saying,

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.993
"I don't like dancing."
It's like, yeah, you do, Ellen.

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:37.797
You do. You-you are angry
about everything, it seems.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.566
Some of these people just need
to be called on their (bleep).

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.435
-You know? I mean, when...
-What-what... But when you say

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.036
"your (bleep),"
what in particular?

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.705
-Well, when you're... -'Cause
this is the-this is the thing--

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.640
protesting a, you know,
fair and free election...

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.408
that, to me, you-you're gonna
get called on your (bleep)

00:01:49.441 --> 00:01:51.811
a little bit. It's time
to clear the streets, it's time

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:53.880
to accept reality,
it's time to move on,

00:01:53.913 --> 00:01:55.248
time to make America
great again.

00:01:55.281 --> 00:01:58.851
-You consider yourself
a conservative. -I do.

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:01.120
-Okay. -I mean, a millennial,
so I don't really like labels.

00:02:01.153 --> 00:02:04.390
-But, yes, I'm conservative
in thought. -Sorry, my brain...

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:06.859
You just gave a label
to say you don't like labels.

00:02:06.892 --> 00:02:09.395
-But, anyway, um...
-We exist on a spectrum, Trevor.

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:11.397
I mean, you're... Would you
consider yourself a liberal?

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.899
That was just... that was
just funny. That was just funny.

00:02:12.932 --> 00:02:14.400
-It was just a funny moment.
Um... -I'm a millennial.

00:02:14.433 --> 00:02:16.335
-We can surprise you.
-It's just... it's just funny.

00:02:16.368 --> 00:02:19.272
Um, in terms
of Black Lives Matter,

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:22.108
like, you know,
you have quite a record...

00:02:22.141 --> 00:02:24.243
For somebody who is not racist,

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:27.580
you have to spend a lot of time
saying, "I'm not racist."

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:31.918
Uh... what is your biggest issue
with Black Lives Matter?

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:34.253 line:0%

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:36.455 line:0%
it started with good intentions.

00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:38.324 line:0%
I think it was.
It was well-intentioned.

00:02:38.357 --> 00:02:40.459
The moment that
they started pushing "hands up,

00:02:40.492 --> 00:02:41.861
don't shoot"--
which is a false narrative,

00:02:41.894 --> 00:02:44.063
proven time and time again
to be a false narrative--

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:45.731
the minute that that became
their slogan,

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:48.734
the minute that protesting
turned into rioting and looting

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:51.204
and burning
and militant actions,

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.539
that's when I lost respect
for Black Lives Matter.

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.107
Okay, but, now, here's my thing.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.210
Let's address each
of these things one by one.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.812
When you go, protesting, turning
into rioting and looting,

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:01.480
that's not a Black Lives Matter
phenomenon.

00:03:01.513 --> 00:03:04.617
That is what happens when there
is a protest a lot of the time.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.252
There are people
who rioted and looted

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.254
when teams won in Chicago
years ago.

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:09.922
It doesn't mean
that they are now bad people.

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:11.123
That's what happens...

00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:13.025
There are some bad people
in every instance.

00:03:13.058 --> 00:03:14.727
Going back
to Black Lives Matter, though,

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.696
for you to say that... You say
they have good intentions,

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:18.197
they had the good intentions.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.499
How are you labeling out
the actions of a few

00:03:20.532 --> 00:03:22.969
and condemning an entire group?
I don't understand that.

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.738
Because they subscribe to the
Black Lives Matter movement.

00:03:25.771 --> 00:03:28.608
They say, we are
the Black Lives Matter movement,

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.543
fry 'em like bacon,
"F" the police.

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:31.944
They are saying those things.

00:03:31.977 --> 00:03:33.879
These are a few people.
These are a few people.

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:35.281
This is not
the Black Lives Matter pro...

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:37.450
-These are... these are... -That
is not the platform, though.

00:03:37.483 --> 00:03:39.118
I saw it in my...
my city of Dallas.

00:03:39.151 --> 00:03:40.920
I saw what a Black Lives Matter
protest looked like.

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:43.556
And I saw five fallen officers
because of it.

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:45.324
-So I've seen... -That's
not fair and that's true.

00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:47.426
-That's-that's not... -No, no,
no, no, no, it is fair, Trevor,

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.795
because the shooter said,
point blank shooter said,

00:03:49.828 --> 00:03:52.098
he's doing this
because of Black Lives Matter.

00:03:52.131 --> 00:03:53.866
Yes, and there are many things
you can say.

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:55.568
I mean, if you go outside,

00:03:55.601 --> 00:03:57.670
you can say anything about doing
something because of...

00:03:57.703 --> 00:04:00.239
You cannot deny that the man
had mental issues, as well,

00:04:00.272 --> 00:04:01.674
and he was in a tough place.

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:03.342
Just because you say the thing
doesn't mean

00:04:03.375 --> 00:04:05.978
-it's what it stands for, right?
-Do you feel emboldened?

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:07.213
Because
you're the same person...

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:08.948
You're the same person
who argued on your show

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:11.584
that just because Donald Trump
has supporters from the KKK

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:13.052
doesn't mean he's in the KKK,

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:14.820
so it goes
against that argument.

00:04:14.853 --> 00:04:16.555
He didn't say...
he didn't say... No. No.

00:04:16.588 --> 00:04:18.024
-(applause and cheering)
-It goes against that.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:19.925
You can't say
he did it because of.

00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.961
No, but, he, the shooter said,
"I am..."

00:04:21.994 --> 00:04:23.095
Yes, but Black Lives Matter
has never said

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:24.497
go out and shoot people.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.365
I'm saying, you're saying this
to your audience,

00:04:26.398 --> 00:04:28.834
and I honestly do not understand
where you're getting that from.

00:04:28.867 --> 00:04:30.236
Just because a person...

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:33.172
What if somebody says, "I felt
emboldened by Tomi Lahren,

00:04:33.205 --> 00:04:35.141
and so I went out,
and I shot black people"?

00:04:35.174 --> 00:04:36.676
Are you now responsible?
Is that your black...?

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:38.344
But it's not one... Trevor,
it's not one or two people.

00:04:38.377 --> 00:04:39.912
-If you look at it...
-How many people is it?

00:04:39.945 --> 00:04:41.314
If you look at it in every city,

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:43.249
-look at the protests that have
gone on. -How many people is it?

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:45.017
In Baltimore, in Ferguson,
in New York City,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.453
the protests that have now
turned to anti-Trump protests.

00:04:47.486 --> 00:04:49.288
-These are not a few people.
-Okay.

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:50.990
-This is mass crowds of people.
-Okay.

00:04:51.023 --> 00:04:52.858
They're doing this in the name
of Michael Brown.

00:04:52.891 --> 00:04:54.627
They're doing this
in the name of Freddie Gray.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.263
They're doing it as the front
of Black Lives Matter,

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:59.432
and the mainstream media
is emboldening these people.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:01.467
Okay, so then let's use
that same logic

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.336
that you're using, then,
and then go, police.

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:06.005
Are the police racist?
Because police in many cities...

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:07.206
You look at Baltimore,

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:08.974
or you look
at what happened in New York,

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:10.843
you look at what happened
in the case of Walter Scott.

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:12.378
You tell me,
are police racist?

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:14.313
Because they've been shown
to harass black people unfairly.

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:15.948
They've been shown
to shoot black people

00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:18.317
when they're unarmed. Does that
mean the police are racist then?

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:19.852
Because that's the same logic
you're using.

00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:21.387
-It's really not, though,
Trevor, because... -It is.

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.389
the mainstream media is not
emboldening them as a group.

00:05:23.422 --> 00:05:24.857
-(groaning, booing)
-It's not. And did you know

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.259
that a black man is 18.5 times
more likely

00:05:27.292 --> 00:05:29.095
to shoot a police officer
than a police officer is

00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:31.030
to shoot a black man?
Those are statistics

00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:33.032
-no one wants to talk about.
-(booing, groaning)

00:05:33.065 --> 00:05:35.701
Here's the thing.
So, let me ask you this, then.

00:05:35.734 --> 00:05:37.503
If you say, as you said
when you walked out,

00:05:37.536 --> 00:05:38.904
"I'm not as mean
as people think I am,

00:05:38.937 --> 00:05:41.440
I'm not the person
that people think I am,"

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:44.877
what do you wish people
would understand about you

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:46.345
that are in another bubble?

00:05:46.378 --> 00:05:47.913
What do you wish people would
understand about you

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:49.148
on the other side?

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:51.784 line:0%
I wish that we could disagree
with each other

00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:55.721 line:0%
without thinking that we are bad
people or ill-intentioned folks.

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:58.057 line:0%
So because I criticize
a black person

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.792 line:0%
or I criticize
the Black Lives Matter movement,

00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:02.094 line:0%
that doesn't mean
that I am anti-black.

00:06:02.127 --> 00:06:04.096
It does not mean
that I don't like black people,

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:05.197
or that I'm a racist.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.499
It means
I'm criticizing a movement.

00:06:06.532 --> 00:06:07.767
I criticize Colin Kaepernick.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.968
That doesn't mean
that I don't believe

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.236
in his First Amendment rights.

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:11.771
It means that I believe
in my First Amendment rights

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:13.005
to criticize him.

00:06:13.038 --> 00:06:14.373
So it doesn't make me
a bad person,

00:06:14.406 --> 00:06:16.509
it doesn't make me a racist
to point out...

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:19.612
I mean, I've never used
racial slurs to address people.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:21.080
I've never looked down
on someone

00:06:21.113 --> 00:06:22.515
because of their skin color.

00:06:22.548 --> 00:06:24.817
To me, true diversity
is diversity of thought,

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.253
not diversity of color.
I don't see color.

00:06:27.286 --> 00:06:28.788
I go after Hillary Clinton,

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:31.857
-(laughter, groaning) -and
she's as white as they come.

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.959
You don't...
you don't see color?

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:35.961
So what do you do
at a traffic light?

00:06:35.994 --> 00:06:38.998
-(laughter, applause &amp; cheering)
-I don't believe in that at all,

00:06:39.031 --> 00:06:40.399
when people say that.

00:06:40.432 --> 00:06:42.234
There's nothing wrong
with<i> seeing</i> color.

00:06:42.267 --> 00:06:44.336
It's how you treat color
that's more important.

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:46.439
-You're right. It is.
-Here's my thing.

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.507
Like, all these points
that you make are great,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.075
and I do believe
that you believe them.

00:06:50.108 --> 00:06:51.444
And I don't believe
anyone is actively trying...

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:52.878
There are a few people
who are trying

00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:54.480
to be bad
from their point of view.

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.749
Bu<00:06:54.613><c>t </c><00:06:54.646><c>wh</c><00:06:54.680><c>en</c><00:06:54.713><c> I</c><00:06:54.746><c> l</c><00:06:54.780><c>oo</c><00:06:54.813><c>k</c>

00:06:56.782 --> 00:06:58.617
you say you're not pushing
a racist narrative,

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.419
you're not...
you're criticizing.

00:07:00.452 --> 00:07:02.321
Do you really believe
you're criticizing

00:07:02.354 --> 00:07:04.490
and you're not mal-intentioned
when you say things like

00:07:04.523 --> 00:07:06.625
Black Lives Matter
is the new KKK?

00:07:06.658 --> 00:07:08.994
Because you realize Black Lives
Matter can't be the<i> new</i> KKK,

00:07:09.027 --> 00:07:10.429
the KKK is still around.

00:07:10.462 --> 00:07:12.531
-They have not vacated
their premises, -(clears throat)

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:13.933
-(applause)
-and most importantly,

00:07:13.966 --> 00:07:16.902
to say Black Lives Matter
is the new KKK is... like,

00:07:16.935 --> 00:07:19.939
to really, really minimize
what the KKK did

00:07:19.972 --> 00:07:22.308
and what they stand for--
that is not the same thing.

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:25.578
Surely you understand
the incendiary, like...

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.646
-But... -feeling of your
comments. You know that, surely.

00:07:27.679 --> 00:07:29.548 line:0%
It's controversial, but
I think there are some things

00:07:29.581 --> 00:07:32.051 line:0%
that need to be said, and when
the Black Lives Matter movement

00:07:32.084 --> 00:07:34.186 line:0%
is going out with signs saying,
"Fry 'em like bacon,

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:35.855 line:0%
F the police,"
when they're going out saying

00:07:35.888 --> 00:07:37.790 line:0%
if you see a white person,
target them...

00:07:37.823 --> 00:07:39.124
That is happening, Trevor.

00:07:39.157 --> 00:07:41.227
That happened in Milwaukee
not too long ago.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:43.596
That is happening. So when
that now becomes the narrative

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:45.664
and you're starting to loot,
burn and riot,

00:07:45.697 --> 00:07:47.666
-what did the KKK do?
-That is not...

00:07:47.699 --> 00:07:49.335
Look, we'll go around
in circles...

00:07:49.368 --> 00:07:51.337
Did you say,
"What did the KKK do?"

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.339
No. What did they do?
When you're saying...

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:55.007
-(laughter) -Wow.
-Listen, listen... Trevor...

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:56.475
-Wow.
-Trevor, when you're saying...

00:07:56.508 --> 00:07:58.344
when there are people
in the street saying

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:00.479
if you see a white person,
beat their ass...

00:08:00.512 --> 00:08:02.815
does that not sound reminiscent
of the KKK

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:05.284
-or their motives to you?
-Is that the narrative

00:08:05.317 --> 00:08:07.453
of Black Lives Matter,
or are there people

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:10.189
who are saying that within
a crowd of other human beings?

00:08:10.222 --> 00:08:12.691
There is a distinction between
a movement and the people.

00:08:12.724 --> 00:08:14.660
That is something
that we keep coming back to.

00:08:14.693 --> 00:08:16.595
But let's go back
to what you were saying

00:08:16.628 --> 00:08:18.631
on Colin Kaepernick
and the National Anthem.

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:20.332
This is something
I don't understand,

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:22.167
and I...
when I watch your videos,

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.670
I go...
I truly do not understand.

00:08:24.703 --> 00:08:26.872
You say... Colin Kaepernick
is exercising

00:08:26.905 --> 00:08:29.141
his First Amendment rights,
and you are exercising

00:08:29.174 --> 00:08:31.443
your First Amendment rights
in criticizing him.

00:08:31.476 --> 00:08:34.179
-Mm-hmm.
-So what you're saying is...

00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:37.249
"You have the right to say
anything you want, so shut up."

00:08:37.282 --> 00:08:39.151
No. Not at all.

00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:41.987
I'm saying I don't agree
with what he did.

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.789
-Yes. -I think that
he went about it the wrong way.

00:08:43.822 --> 00:08:45.324
-I don't think he understands...
-What is the right way?

00:08:45.357 --> 00:08:46.725
When people say that,
I'm always fascinated.

00:08:46.758 --> 00:08:49.094
What is the right way? So,
here's a black man in America

00:08:49.127 --> 00:08:51.864
who says, I don't know
how to get a message across.

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:53.933
If I march in the streets,
people say I'm a thug,

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:57.069
if I go out and I protest,
people say that it's a riot,

00:08:57.102 --> 00:09:00.005
if I bend down on one knee, then
it's... What is the right way?

00:09:00.038 --> 00:09:01.206
That is something
I've always wanted to know.

00:09:01.239 --> 00:09:03.208
What is the right way
for a black person

00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.144
-(applause, cheering)
-to get attention in America?

00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:06.612
Taking it out...

00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:08.013
Trevor...

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:10.516
taking it out on our flag
and our National Anthem,

00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:12.318
-to me...
-But how?

00:09:12.351 --> 00:09:13.519 line:0%
Why would you take out

00:09:13.552 --> 00:09:15.521 line:0%
your perceived oppression
of black people

00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:17.256 line:0%
out on the National Anthem
and our flag?

00:09:17.289 --> 00:09:19.558
A country that you live in,
a country that you benefit from,

00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:22.227
a country that people
of all races have died for,

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.263
have died to protect,
have died for the vote,

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:26.298
died to be enfranchised
by this nation,

00:09:26.331 --> 00:09:28.000
how do you then go
and disrespect the flag

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:29.535
and the anthem of that country?

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:32.338
-Why is that the outlet?
-Well, maybe you're a person

00:09:32.371 --> 00:09:34.139
who's lived
and read through history,

00:09:34.172 --> 00:09:36.575
and you realize that a lot
of those people of every color

00:09:36.608 --> 00:09:39.278
who died for this country, some
of them didn't have the rights

00:09:39.311 --> 00:09:41.180
that their fellow servicemen had

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:43.148
when they came back to the
country after fighting for it.

00:09:43.181 --> 00:09:44.850
And that flag means a lot
to those folks, too.

00:09:44.883 --> 00:09:46.485
Maybe you're one
of those people who realizes

00:09:46.518 --> 00:09:49.121
that the penal system in America
was<i> designed</i>

00:09:49.154 --> 00:09:52.024
to oppress black people, it was
designed to enslave people,

00:09:52.057 --> 00:09:53.592
it is a relic of slavery.

00:09:53.625 --> 00:09:55.027
Maybe you're
one of those people.

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.262
So what I don't understand is,
a guy is kneeling in the corner,

00:09:57.295 --> 00:09:59.498
I don't understand
why that offends you so much.

00:09:59.531 --> 00:10:01.266
It's not even like
he's trying to sing over you.

00:10:01.299 --> 00:10:03.235
If he was doing that, he's like,
â™ª O say... â™ª

00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:05.638
O say can<i> me</i> see!
No. He's singing...

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:08.273
He's not... he's not doing
anything that affects you.

00:10:08.306 --> 00:10:10.009
I don't understand
why it gets to you.

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:11.910
I genuinely don't.
He's in a corner,

00:10:11.943 --> 00:10:14.313
kneeling by himself-- why
does that offend you so much?

00:10:14.346 --> 00:10:17.483
For me, I know what
that flag means to me,

00:10:17.516 --> 00:10:19.251
I know what that flag means
to those that are fighting

00:10:19.284 --> 00:10:21.553
for our country right now-- it's
bigger than a piece of cloth.

00:10:21.586 --> 00:10:23.322
It's a symbol of patriotism.

00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:25.290
Our National Anthem has meant
a lot to a lot of people,

00:10:25.323 --> 00:10:26.792
it's got a lot of people
through very hard times,

00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:28.894
and this country,
it's got its scars,

00:10:28.927 --> 00:10:30.429
it's got its wounds,
it's got its history,

00:10:30.462 --> 00:10:31.664
but I still believe
it's the greatest nation

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:33.032
on the face of the Earth,
and I believe

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:35.000
if you live in this country,
you can want to better it,

00:10:35.033 --> 00:10:37.102
but to disrespect
our flag and our anthem,

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:39.104
in that way,
and that be your outlet

00:10:39.137 --> 00:10:41.040
to get out
whatever aggression you have,

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:43.275
whether it be passive
or active aggression,

00:10:43.308 --> 00:10:45.077
I disagree with it.

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:46.512
And so he has every right
to do it--

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:47.913
that's his
First Amendment rights,

00:10:47.946 --> 00:10:50.482
and I agree with his First
Amendment right to do it--

00:10:50.515 --> 00:10:51.917
I don't agree with what he did.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:53.352
So because I don't agree
with what he did,

00:10:53.385 --> 00:10:54.987
then now<i> I</i> should shut up?
Because I'm white?

00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.555
So I should shut up?
I shouldn't be able to talk

00:10:56.588 --> 00:10:57.790
about black issues
'cause I'm white?

00:10:57.823 --> 00:11:00.159
No one brought up whites at all.

00:11:00.192 --> 00:11:01.894
I never said that.
I don't see color.

00:11:01.927 --> 00:11:03.862
-I...
-(laughter)

00:11:03.895 --> 00:11:06.065
I don't think that
that's what the argument is.

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:08.801
What I'm saying is...
I asked you one question,

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:10.969
and that is:
How should a black person

00:11:11.002 --> 00:11:12.471
bring up their grievances?

00:11:12.504 --> 00:11:14.006
That's all I ask. How?

00:11:14.039 --> 00:11:16.575
If that's not the right way,
if marching isn't the right way,

00:11:16.608 --> 00:11:18.077
what<i> is</i> the right way?

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:20.546
When you talk...
What he said was,

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.514
he is protesting
the anthem and the flag

00:11:22.547 --> 00:11:24.516
because of the oppression
of black people

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:25.784
-in this country.
-Yes.

00:11:25.817 --> 00:11:27.886
I would like him
to further explain

00:11:27.919 --> 00:11:29.555
what he's talking about
when he's discussing

00:11:29.588 --> 00:11:31.690
-the black oppression
in this country. -Which he has.

00:11:31.723 --> 00:11:35.160
Also, is it against police?
Is it against the government?

00:11:35.193 --> 00:11:37.262
I'm not sure what oppression
he's discussing.

00:11:37.295 --> 00:11:38.630
I would love
to have him come on my show

00:11:38.663 --> 00:11:39.932
and discuss it with me.

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:43.669
To me, when you make the flag
and you make the anthem

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:45.471
the outlet for your anger,

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:47.973
or the outlet through which
you're going to protest

00:11:48.006 --> 00:11:50.175
your country that you live in,
you reside in,

00:11:50.208 --> 00:11:52.444
that you take
$19 million a year from,

00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:55.347
I don't think that that is the
correct outlet for your anger.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.116
So, what is he protesting?

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:00.519
Again, you haven't answered
my question of how...

00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:02.421
-how you want black people...
-So...

00:12:02.454 --> 00:12:04.289
I'm just asking how.
And I'm asking you...

00:12:04.322 --> 00:12:05.758
honestly, I'm not saying
in a challenging way--

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.626
I'm saying to you,
I don't know the answer

00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:09.862
apart from these methods,
so I would like to know

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.530
if you've ever thought of a how.

00:12:11.563 --> 00:12:13.265
Because you're the first person
I've met who's said this.

00:12:13.298 --> 00:12:14.633
I've seen this message online.

00:12:14.666 --> 00:12:16.802
I'm not labeling you
as<i> "the</i> bad person."

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:19.371
I just want to know if
you've ever thought of the how.

00:12:19.404 --> 00:12:21.039
That's all I want to know.

00:12:21.072 --> 00:12:23.108
For me, I think there are a lot
of folks in this country,

00:12:23.141 --> 00:12:26.578
I, being a woman, um, I didn't
have rights after black people,

00:12:26.611 --> 00:12:28.080
until women
got the right to vote,

00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:29.848
but because I feel like
I'm a woman,

00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:31.083
and I'm marginalized
in some way,

00:12:31.116 --> 00:12:32.818
I don't protest my country.

00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:35.020
I don't see
what he's protesting.

00:12:35.053 --> 00:12:37.389
-I would like to know exactly
what he is protesting. -So...

00:12:37.422 --> 00:12:38.791
-It's a very...
-So how do you-- No, no.

00:12:38.824 --> 00:12:40.526
-How do you protest, then?
That's what... -I don't protest.

00:12:40.559 --> 00:12:41.760
Because I'm not a victim.

00:12:41.793 --> 00:12:44.263
I guess we can,
we can go back and forth

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:46.765
on a lot of these issues, um...

00:12:46.798 --> 00:12:48.367
It's-it's an interesting place
to be in,

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.337
because, honestly, y-you've won,
you know.

00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:55.407
Like, your side has won,
as you say, you know.

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.509
The liberal snowflakes
are melting

00:12:57.542 --> 00:12:59.578
in the streets as they protest.

00:12:59.611 --> 00:13:02.080
And now I would like to know
from your side, genuinely,

00:13:02.113 --> 00:13:04.616
as someone who's won,
do you believe

00:13:04.649 --> 00:13:08.720
that Donald Trump will follow
through on his promises?

00:13:08.753 --> 00:13:11.990
I will be a vocal opponent
if he doesn't.

00:13:12.023 --> 00:13:15.794
I am not somebody that gets on
the cheerleading bandwagon.

00:13:15.827 --> 00:13:18.964
If he does something I disagree
with, I will discuss it.

00:13:18.997 --> 00:13:21.099
I did before I was
a Trump supporter,

00:13:21.132 --> 00:13:22.467
I was critical of Trump.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.336
I was a Marco Rubio girl
for a long time,

00:13:24.369 --> 00:13:26.839
and then I started to see that
was gonna be our nominee.

00:13:26.872 --> 00:13:28.340
And I said it's him or Hillary.

00:13:28.373 --> 00:13:30.008
-A lot of Americans
were in that position. -Yeah.

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:31.410
And then I got closer
to the campaign,

00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:32.978
and I started seeing some
of the things he was saying,

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:34.913
and I started seeing the effect
he was having on people,

00:13:34.946 --> 00:13:36.915
and the things that he was
saying that was touching people,

00:13:36.948 --> 00:13:38.750
-and making them feel like
they... -He was touching people.

00:13:38.783 --> 00:13:40.352
-Yeah. He was.
-(laughter)

00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:41.753
He really was.

00:13:41.786 --> 00:13:43.789
Hillary could use some of that
every now and then, right?

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:45.757
Bill's a little busy,
Bill's a little busy.

I appreciate you being
on the show.

00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:48.093
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:13:48.126 --> 00:13:49.361
-Thank you, Trevor.
-It is, a...

00:13:49.394 --> 00:13:51.697
a conversation we should
continue having, uh, having.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:53.765
You can find, uh,
