Hey guys it's Ashley here.
Shoulders are one of the most common

00:00:02.316 --> 00:00:06.997
reasons that people come to see me as an
osteopath. The chances are you may even

00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:10.687
have a shoulder problem which is why you
might be watching this video. In today's

00:00:10.687 --> 00:00:15.727
video I'm going to show you why I think
shoulder problems develop and what you

00:00:15.727 --> 00:00:20.136
can do to try to fix your shoulder
problems. But before I do that I need to

00:00:20.136 --> 00:00:25.597
just briefly explain the anatomy of the
shoulder and some of the more

00:00:25.597 --> 00:00:30.997
significant features of the shoulder and
why that's relevant to shoulder pain.

00:00:30.997 --> 00:00:35.317
Okay so what we've got here is a model
of the shoulder complex. Right now what

00:00:35.317 --> 00:00:40.117
you're looking at is from the front
almost like you've got my shoulder here

00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:43.357
and I've taken away everything all
you're left with is the shoulder blade.

00:00:43.357 --> 00:00:50.437
This bony area here is your scapula also
known as your shoulder blade. Here we have

00:00:50.437 --> 00:00:54.666
the collarbone which is also known as the
clavicle and then your upper arm bone

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:59.047
known as the humerus. All of these
muscles that you can see attached are

00:00:59.047 --> 00:01:04.386
collectively known as the Rotator Cuff.
The Rotator Cuff is made up of four main

00:01:04.386 --> 00:01:08.767
muscles. The first one is the
supraspinatus, then you've got the

00:01:08.767 --> 00:01:15.547
infraspinatus, teres minor and teres
major and then on the front side you've

00:01:15.547 --> 00:01:20.496
got the subscapularis. Collectively the
rotator cuff pulls the head of the

00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:26.047
humerus in towards the scapula creating
stability. Individually all of the

00:01:26.047 --> 00:01:29.857
muscles have slightly different
functions. Starting with the

00:01:29.857 --> 00:01:37.227
supraspinatus it holds the humerus into
the socket, tenses the capsule and

00:01:37.227 --> 00:01:43.897
abducts the arm. The infraspinatus also
helps to stabilize the capsule but its

00:01:43.897 --> 00:01:48.787
main function is to externally rotate
the arm. So if you were to bend your

00:01:48.787 --> 00:01:54.426
elbow and take your hand out to the side,
that's external rotation. The teres minor,

00:01:54.426 --> 00:02:00.276
the one down here also weakly helps to
externally rotate your arm. And lastly

00:02:00.276 --> 00:02:06.187
the subscapularis helps to medially
rotate the arm or internally rotate, so

00:02:06.187 --> 00:02:10.297
opposite to
the infraspinatus if you were to bend

00:02:10.297 --> 00:02:15.217
your elbow you would be taking your hand
across your body towards your midline.

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:20.017
The reason I mentioned these muscles is
because most people I see are extremely

00:02:20.017 --> 00:02:26.317
tight. This causes a lot of strain to be
put on the tendons because people having

00:02:26.317 --> 00:02:32.347
to fight against this tightness and one
of the main areas that this irritation

00:02:32.347 --> 00:02:39.487
happens is up here in the supraspinatus.
Irritation of the tendon leads to

00:02:39.487 --> 00:02:46.237
swelling and that swelling causes a
reduction in space. So when people then

00:02:46.237 --> 00:02:53.287
start to abduct their arm that lack of
space is causing people a lot more pain.

00:02:53.287 --> 00:02:57.727
All right so I've taken away all the
muscles and now all you're left with is

00:02:57.727 --> 00:03:04.327
the joint in itself. The joint is known
as a ball and socket joint so here you

00:03:04.327 --> 00:03:10.357
can see the ball and in here is the
socket. What's significant about the

00:03:10.357 --> 00:03:16.267
shoulder is that the ball and socket is
quite shallow. It allows greater range of

00:03:16.267 --> 00:03:21.247
movement in all directions but the
problem with this increased range of

00:03:21.247 --> 00:03:26.637
motion means that there's actually a
decrease in the amount of stability so

00:03:26.637 --> 00:03:34.387
people with hypermobility are often at
risk of dislocated shoulders. The other

00:03:34.387 --> 00:03:39.907
thing that can happen in this region
here, more so in older people is the

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:44.547
development of osteoarthritis and
unfortunately once you get to that stage

00:03:44.547 --> 00:03:49.557
there's not much that can be done from
someone like me in the way of treatment

00:03:49.557 --> 00:03:55.417
and it usually ends up being more of a
surgical procedure to try and restore

00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:59.167
some of the smoothness in that joint. So
the next thing I want to just point out

00:03:59.167 --> 00:04:07.087
to you is this tunnel right here. This is
where your supraspinatus muscle runs

00:04:07.087 --> 00:04:12.787
through. The supraspinatus attaches just
above the spine of the scapula and runs

00:04:12.787 --> 00:04:17.167
through attaching onto the outer part of
your humerus and the reason I mention

00:04:17.167 --> 00:04:20.947
this is because the supraspinatus is one
of the most

00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:26.347
commonly irritated muscles in the
shoulder region. So I've added all the

00:04:26.347 --> 00:04:30.966
muscles back on. Now as you can see the
supraspinatus here is running through

00:04:30.966 --> 00:04:39.037
this tunnel but when you lift up your
arm if I just take this out. When you

00:04:39.037 --> 00:04:45.877
lift up your arm that gap becomes a lot
smaller and this is the reason why a lot

00:04:45.877 --> 00:04:51.877
of people get pain in their
supraspinatus, because an irritation

00:04:51.877 --> 00:04:58.567
occurs on the tendon and then every time
they lift their arm that closing in in

00:04:58.567 --> 00:05:03.517
size of the the tunnel causes a lot more
pressure on the tendon. So let me just

00:05:03.517 --> 00:05:08.077
put everything I've told you into
context for you. Most people who come in

00:05:08.077 --> 00:05:13.837
to see me have pain in this upper
frontal region of the shoulder. To me

00:05:13.837 --> 00:05:18.457
that usually indicates that there's some
kind of tendon ligament or Bursa issue

00:05:18.457 --> 00:05:24.607
and in my experience that is usually
because people are extremely tight

00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:29.077
through the muscles in and around the
shoulder. Most commonly that tightness

00:05:29.077 --> 00:05:34.656
comes from the rotator cuff muscles that
I showed you earlier. In order to confirm

00:05:34.656 --> 00:05:40.656
whether it's tightness causing these
issues I'll usually do a couple of tests.

00:05:40.656 --> 00:05:45.037
The first thing I usually get people to
do is to show me their ranges of

00:05:45.037 --> 00:05:48.957
movement, so I'll get them standing in
front of me and get them to perform

00:05:48.957 --> 00:05:55.776
complete abduction all the way up to the
ceiling and back down and then following

00:05:55.776 --> 00:05:58.477
on from that I'll get them to lift the
arms up to the front

00:05:58.477 --> 00:06:03.996
as far as they can and down, and what I
usually see in most people is that

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:10.987
they're quite limited in full flexion so
when I look at them from the side their

00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:18.067
maximum range of movement is to about
here. What I would like to see is full

00:06:18.067 --> 00:06:25.477
range of movement where the arm is right
up by the ear. After that I'll get them to

00:06:25.477 --> 00:06:30.936
do the painful arc test and what you do
is you stand arms down by your side

00:06:30.936 --> 00:06:36.477
and take your arm
all the way up to the ceiling and note

00:06:36.477 --> 00:06:43.557
where they're getting pain If it's a
superspinatus tendinitis or bursitis in

00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:49.287
this other upper subacromial region
though usually feel pain between about

00:06:49.287 --> 00:06:56.847
40 degrees to about 120 degrees. Now the
reason that that happens is because as

00:06:56.847 --> 00:07:03.537
you get to this sort of area here the
space between the humeral bone and these

00:07:03.537 --> 00:07:08.547
the acromion is completely minimized
like I showed you earlier. After that

00:07:08.547 --> 00:07:15.057
test I will get them to do the scratch
test and it looks like this. What you're going

00:07:15.057 --> 00:07:20.217
to do is take one arm behind you and
reach up as far up your back as you can

00:07:20.217 --> 00:07:26.037
once you've done that take that arm down
do the same on the other side and then

00:07:26.037 --> 00:07:31.767
back down and note where both hands or
both tips of fingers reach up. Quite

00:07:31.767 --> 00:07:36.207
often what you see is the side the
shoulder that has the pain will be quite

00:07:36.207 --> 00:07:40.767
restricted and will not be able to go as
far up as the good side. Now on the

00:07:40.767 --> 00:07:45.717
demonstration that I just did what you
might be able to see is that my left arm

00:07:45.717 --> 00:07:51.327
can reach up my back fairly high but
when it comes to the right side there's

00:07:51.327 --> 00:07:58.107
a lot less range which indicates that my
right side is tight in either extension

00:07:58.107 --> 00:08:03.537
or internal rotation or even just a
combination of the two together. This

00:08:03.537 --> 00:08:07.367
would indicate to me if it was a patient
that they need to be doing more

00:08:07.367 --> 00:08:12.867
stretching in those ranges. So if you're
having shoulder pain or shoulder

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:17.547
discomfort definitely go through these
tests have a look at your range of

00:08:17.547 --> 00:08:21.687
movement first of all see if you can get
those arms all the way up to the ceiling

00:08:21.687 --> 00:08:26.727
if you can't you know your tight. Then
take your arms behind you do that

00:08:26.727 --> 00:08:32.067
scratch test. If you're struggling to get
your arm behind you then that's an

00:08:32.067 --> 00:08:36.507
indication that there's definitely
tightness in the front or in the rotator

00:08:36.507 --> 00:08:42.357
cuff muscles and that will mean that you
need to then stretch in a more extension

00:08:42.357 --> 00:08:46.247
or internal rotation. And since we're on the
subject of stretching I'm going to

00:08:46.247 --> 00:08:51.137
show you now some really effective
stretches that I prescribed my patients

00:08:51.137 --> 00:08:55.637
all the time and also how to use some
massage balls to get into those tight

00:08:55.637 --> 00:08:59.657
areas too. The first stretch that you're
going to need to do involves using one

00:08:59.657 --> 00:09:03.257
of these which I believe is called a
power band or a strength band. You can

00:09:03.257 --> 00:09:08.387
get this fairly cheap and you get it from
Amazon, this is a medium. Anything lighter

00:09:08.387 --> 00:09:10.997
than that you're probably not going to
get enough stretch anything stronger

00:09:10.997 --> 00:09:14.987
than that and it's probably going to be
too strong. So anyway with the band find

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:18.047
somewhere in the gym that you can hook
it up or somewhere at home. Once you've

00:09:18.047 --> 00:09:23.507
got it attached, looped over something above
you put your hand through the band turn

00:09:23.507 --> 00:09:28.937
your palm up, face away from the band. Now
right now I'm close to the band so there's

00:09:28.937 --> 00:09:33.727
hardly anything any stretch going
through my arm. Straighten out your arm

00:09:33.727 --> 00:09:40.697
lift your chest and gradually step away
from where you've attached the band. You

00:09:40.697 --> 00:09:44.297
should feel this stretch around the
front of your shoulder possibly even

00:09:44.297 --> 00:09:51.047
going into your bicep. Once you've done
that same set up for the next stretch

00:09:51.047 --> 00:09:56.837
put your hand through turn away and lean
forward this allows you to get your arm

00:09:56.837 --> 00:10:01.967
bent behind your back. With your free
hand hold onto your fingers of the hand

00:10:01.967 --> 00:10:08.267
that's through the loop and then step
away and as you step away gradually lift

00:10:08.267 --> 00:10:14.177
your chest and what you want to try and
do is pull this arm this elbow away from

00:10:14.177 --> 00:10:16.447
your body.

00:10:17.017 --> 00:10:23.447
Once you finish, step back lean forwards
and allow yourself to come out of the

00:10:23.447 --> 00:10:28.427
band. And the last stretch I think you
guys should probably do is this one up

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:35.467
into full flexion so get your arm through the
band, take it out in front of you and

00:10:35.467 --> 00:10:40.517
gradually walk forwards keeping your
arms straight until you feel it stretch

00:10:40.517 --> 00:10:46.117
and just try and push your chest and
head through.

00:10:48.137 --> 00:10:53.717
So here's something else I really like
using and that is massage balls. This is

00:10:53.717 --> 00:10:58.637
a lacrosse ball but a massage ball,
Lacrosse ball, hockey ball, anything that's

00:10:58.637 --> 00:11:03.107
hard enough to get into those
small muscles will be perfect. I like

00:11:03.107 --> 00:11:06.917
these because they get into those small
muscles that are hard to reach when

00:11:06.917 --> 00:11:11.507
you're using a foam roller. So what
you're going to do is try it and get

00:11:11.507 --> 00:11:17.627
into your rotator cuff. The principle is
that you find a tender point press into

00:11:17.627 --> 00:11:23.417
it and hold in that position. If you hold
long enough that pain will start to

00:11:23.417 --> 00:11:29.387
disappear. So to get into your rotator
cuff get the ball, place it underneath

00:11:29.387 --> 00:11:35.087
your arm, with your free hand pull so
that you can get this ball further

00:11:35.087 --> 00:11:41.017
around behind you.
Then come up against a wall and press in

00:11:41.017 --> 00:11:48.617
against the wall. Move around until you
can find a tender point once you have a

00:11:48.617 --> 00:11:53.627
tender point
just stay there, relax and apply some

00:11:53.627 --> 00:12:00.497
pressure. Maintain that pressure until
that pain starts to go away or you've

00:12:00.497 --> 00:12:06.077
done about a minute. Once a minute has
passed move to a different point and

00:12:06.077 --> 00:12:14.207
repeat the process again. Then to get up
into these upper muscles you need to do

00:12:14.207 --> 00:12:21.137
a bit more contortion, so place the ball
up and over but this time you're going to

00:12:21.137 --> 00:12:28.547
have to lean back into the wall. Lean up
against the wall, again find those tender

00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:35.297
points, hold and stay for about a minute.
So that's pretty much all I'd recommend

00:12:35.297 --> 00:12:40.277
for now guys. The strength band stretches
and the massage balls. I would suggest

00:12:40.277 --> 00:12:46.787
you do either of those in alternate days
so for example strength band stretches

00:12:46.787 --> 00:12:50.927
you could do on a Monday Wednesday and
Friday and the massage balls you could

00:12:50.927 --> 00:12:55.287
do on a Tuesday Thursday Saturday. And
the reason I say this is because

00:12:55.287 --> 00:13:01.017
if you do either of them too much you're
only going to make yourself quite sore in

00:13:01.017 --> 00:13:05.847
terms of how long to do them for I would
suggest doing each banded

00:13:05.847 --> 00:13:11.097
stretch for about 15 to 30 seconds,
then move on to the next stretch for

00:13:11.097 --> 00:13:13.527
about the same amount of time and then
the next one for about the same amount

00:13:13.527 --> 00:13:17.877
of time and then repeat maybe another
one or two times after that if you have

00:13:17.877 --> 00:13:22.647
time. For the massage balls find those
tender points that I talked about hold

00:13:22.647 --> 00:13:27.687
it on there for about 60 seconds and
then move on to another point. Hopefully

00:13:27.687 --> 00:13:32.397
you found this video really helpful. If
you did guys give it a thumbs up, if you

00:13:32.397 --> 00:13:36.117
have any comments or questions do stick
them in the comments section below and

00:13:36.117 --> 00:13:48.767
until the next video take care guys and
I will see you soon. Bye bye
