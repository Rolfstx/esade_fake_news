00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
 How do you describe someone like Neil Barnard? 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.490
 who is a researcher, general manager, 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.260
 doctor, psychiatrist, 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.400
 you probably didn't know that, professional musician, 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:18.130
 activist, 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.690
 author with top sales. 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.690
 Maybe you describe him as someone who never sleeps! 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.790
 How does one achieve so many achievements? 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 like these in a single life? I mean, just one of them would be a huge feat! 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.160
 "Oh! Are you a doctor? Really? Are you a psychiatrist? Are you a successful writer?" 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.260
 In addition to all this, he is the founder of the Committee of Physicians for Responsible Medicine -PCRM 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.760
 and ... 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 there are so many things I could say 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.200
 for Dr. Barnard ... 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.120
 It was back in the newspapers on Friday! I don't know, did any of you see it? 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.730
 The Ministry of Rural Development (USDA) has issued a decision according to which 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.080
 The dairy industry can no longer publish ads claiming that milk can make you lose weight or keep you lean. 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 And the reason for this achievement is Dr. Neil Barnard! 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.570
 Please give a heroic welcome to our next speaker, Dr. Neil Barnard! 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.960
 Thank you Jeff! Thank you! 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.040
 A big thank you to Jeff and Sabrina for organizing such a wonderful conference! Can we thank them? 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.160
 Thank you for what you do! Thank you for inviting me to come again! 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.220
 I want to talk about cheese! 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.640
 Can food be addictive? 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.180
 Some researchers at the University of Michigan collected 384 people in groups 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.040
 and asked them "What foods are causing you problems?" 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.910
 And what they meant was: 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.790
 "What foods do you find difficult to reduce?", "What foods do you lose control of?" 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.960
 and even when you're full you can't stop eating them? " 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.560
 You just can't stop ... 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.060
 At number 5 was "the ice cream", 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.310
 At number 4 it was "cookies", at number 3 "the chips", at number 2 "chocolate" and at number 1 "pizza" !!! 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.350
 And I will claim that ... the olives are not to blame! 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.270
 And the dough isn't to blame either ... 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.050
 Something is wrong with this sticky cheese that melts everywhere 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.300
 and it is pulled high ... And it is not true that 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.160
 when you talk to people who follow a vegetarian diet, they say "it goes extremely well only .... 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.320
 I really miss the cheese! " 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.860
 What about that? What happens ; You may love cheese but that doesn't love you ... 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.360
 And I'd like to talk about that right now. It's fattening! It's addictive! 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.270
 And it causes a lot of health problems! And people have overlooked it ... 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.600
 So what causes weight problems? Talk to other people about it, 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.010
 or you read articles in the press and they tell you that "soft drinks are to blame". 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.880
 The sugar in them. These are not healthy foods, 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.470
 but I will ask a question as to whether this is the reason 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.780
 for the obesity epidemic we see happening, because if you look 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.250
 consuming sweeteners over time, 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.280
 increased for a while and from 1999, it began to fall 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.180
 because people started buying bottled water instead of soft drinks 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.080
 And if you look at cheese, where does its consumption go? Up and up again up and up! 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.720
 And in what direction does obesity tend? The cheese follows ... 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.940
 So why is this happening? If you see the consumption of cheese over time, 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.450
 In 1909, the Ministry of Rural Development began recording what Americans ate. 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.470
 And in 1909 cheese was something that "the Swiss eat". 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.330
 They didn't need it on the continent! The average American did not consume more than about 2 kilos 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.640
 time! But what happened? 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.570
 In 1960, 1970, and 1980, fast food chains came. 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.650
 Pizzerias opened ... And so, cheese became an ingredient 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.640
 in many foods that people ate every day! Until 2013, 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.450
 we were at about 15 pounds per person per year! 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.000
 And I don't eat at all so someone else eats 30 kg. 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.680
 I would therefore argue that it causes obesity for specific reasons. First, it's full of calories! 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.780
 And this is probably something you already know, but if you don't know it, this is the most important number: 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.360
 1 gram of sugar ... one gram is an extremely small amount, it is to 1/28 of an ounce 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.520
 1 gram of sugar has 4 calories 1 gram of fat has 9 calories 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.570
 The leanest beef has 29% fat 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.270
 The chicken , 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.350
 (without skin), it doesn't do much better (23%). Fish have variations. Some have higher, some lower. 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.120
 But if you look at plant foods, they have a very low fat content and they don't have a lot of calories. 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.130
 So where is the cheese? 70% fat !!! 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.620
 A little more and it would be Vaseline! 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.180
 Ok. There is now coca cola zero so you can drink without getting calories. 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:24.990
 But is there cheddar zero cheese? I do not think ... 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.660
 Second, fat in food easily becomes body fat. Let's see what I mean. 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.570
 Let's say you ate a little more bread. Will this turn into fat in your body? 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.060
 In fact, no. At least not initially. The carbohydrates found in bread, 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.990
 they break down and pass into the bloodstream, giving energy to the muscles of the body 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:50.420
 and in the brain. It is the energy that moves our body. 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.980
 Let's say I'm overdoing it. I eat a lot more. Let's say I'm an athlete 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.950
 and that I "load" a lot of carbs, I eat a lot of bread and a lot of spaghetti. Will they become fat? 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.850
 No. The reason athletes eat so many carbs is because they go to the muscles 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:09.550
 and stored as glycogen. This works like a battery as long as you move. 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.260
 Glycogen is also stored in your liver. 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:19.180
 Theoretically, you can "build" fat from carbohydrates. 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.860
 But even if you ate all the loaf of bread and it was more than you need and the glycogen stores were full, 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.800
 If fat was made from it, if you turned bread into fat, 

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:33.200
 It would be difficult for your body and it uses about 25% of the calories to make it. 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.010
 On the other hand, the cheese 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.040
 It is easily converted to fat because it is already made from fat. No special conversion required 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.540
 You eat it, it goes into your blood, it is stored as fat. Very simple. 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.150
 Third, fat slows down your metabolism! Here's what I mean. This is a muscle cell. 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.180
 And the reason I'm showing you a muscle cell is because people usually say: 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:03.150
 "Don't lose muscle mass! Your muscles are the ones that burn calories!" Do you know what I mean? 

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:08.010
 Inside your muscles are the mitochondria (inside the cells). 

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:12.790
 Do you remember the mitochondria? From the Biology course at school? These burn calories. You have a lot! 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
 But you also have fat. 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:20.070
 Doctors don't like the word "fat" because it has only two syllables, so we'll say it 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.690
 "intramuscular lipid" but it is fat in your cell 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.520
 and if you ate a little more chicken or beef or velveeta cheese or fried lard, 

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:34.710
 the above fat accumulates inside your cell. 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.940
 When that happens 

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:38.630
 the cell says .... "fantastic"! 

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:44.010
 "It's perfect! I have fat that I can store no matter what 

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:49.430
 We're going to go through a period of hunger, I have stored calories that I can use! " 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.580
 If mitochondria burn them all, they are lost! 

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:59.510
 So, when fat enters the cell, our body slows down the function of mitochondria. 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:04.520
 in order to keep the fat stored. And so the metabolism slows down 

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:09.840
 to maintain the stored fat reserve. 

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:14.790
 And that's the opposite of what you want! You say, "Wait, I ate a lot, why are you saving it? You have to get rid of it!" 

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.760
 Our bodies have been programmed, long before, when there were famines 

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:24.720
 so when people ate something greasy, the body would say, "I'm going to save that." 

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:30.150
 And as the years go by, the metabolism you had when you were 12 is gone 

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:35.220
 because mitochondrial function is impaired. 

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:40.330
 If I follow a low-fat, vegan diet, the effect of time is reversed. 

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.690
 Fourth, cheese has no fiber at all. Fiber will be the most boring part 

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:49.390
 of this presentation. I apologize for that. But fiber is very important. It is the part of the plant that is not digested. 

00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:55.010
 So it has no calories at all. So when you eat foods high in fiber 

00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:57.170
 you feel full, 

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:59.170
 he cheats on you thinking you've eaten too much 

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.610
 but you haven't actually eaten as much as you think. 

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:08.470
 So the fibers deceive the mind into thinking it has eaten too much. 

00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:13.390
 But velveeta (a type of thick cheese) is not a plant, it has no fibers at all 

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:18.880
 so it gets all the calories it has. Let's look at the amount of fiber: 

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:23.120
 The baked beans have 5 gr. in 1/2 cup, broccoli has 5 g. per cup, an apple has 4g. 

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.620
 an orange 1g, a banana 3g, 

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.930
 a cup of brown rice 4g. 

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:32.690
 but the cheese has 0 gr. Yogurt has 0g, milk has 0g. , the meat 0gr. 

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.350
 Animal products have no fibers at all! 

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:42.030
 Fifth ... something most people don't know. The cheese is very sodium! 

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.230
 It is one of the foods with the highest salt content. 

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:49.560
 And this increases the ratio in water, (retention). So it can increase the weight. 

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.620
 An orange has about 1mg of sodium, 

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.800
 apple has about 2 mg, a cup of brown rice has 20mg, a potato 

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.320
 has 13mg, a medium-sized potato. 

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.100
 Potatoes have been added sodium 330mg! 

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.900
 One serving of cheddar cheese has 350 mg of sodium! 

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:20.560
 While a portion of edam cheese has 550 mg. A portion of velveeta cheese has 

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:24.770
 800 mg sodium! In a single serving! 

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.130
 Why is cheese fattening? It has a lot of calories. Its fat is converted directly into body fat. 

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.580
 It slows down the metabolism day by day. 

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:37.550
 It has no fiber at all to control your appetite. It has a lot of salt 

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:42.280
 that retains fluids and carries over a pound of extra water that makes your joints 

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:46.760
 more "soft" and makes you feel swollen and heavy. You have heard 

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:51.820
 for the health study of the Millennials. Researchers have studied the lifestyle of Chileans for years 

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.730
 because the teachings of the church tell them not to smoke, not to drink (alcohol), 

00:10:56.570 --> 00:11:01.520
 Avoid caffeine, don't eat meat. "And almost all millennials 

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:06.050
 they are very good in the first 3. They don't smoke, they don't drink. 

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.380
 They are people with self-control. But some people eat meat 

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:15.010
 and some do not. And that sets a perfect, natural framework for experimental research that researchers have exploited. 

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.740
 This study, (Adventist Health Study-2), 

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.780
 examined 60,903 participants. They were all over 30 years old 

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.530
 and were divided into 5 groups depending on the diet they followed. 

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:34.670
 The researchers examined the body mass index of the participants ... 

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:40.030
 Do you know what that means? BMI? It is your weight in proportion to your height. 

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:45.020
 A healthy BMI is under 25. (Divide the weight by the square of height in meters). 

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:49.330
 The red column in the bar chart represents non-vegetarians. 

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.880
 Those who eat meat, in fact. Meat eaters. 

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:58.930
 Their BMI was about 28.8. 

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.070
 The next column represents the semi-vegetarians. Those who ate meat once a week or less. 

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:08.090
 They were a little weaker (BMI 27.3). The third group was vegetarians who also ate fish. 

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:13.390
 They did not eat animals other than fish. They were a little weaker than the previous two teams. 

00:12:13.510 --> 00:12:17.870
 The fourth group had those who were vegetarians but ate dairy and eggs. They are a little weaker than the previous ones. 

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.320
 In the last group, it was the Vegans. (Vegetarians who do not eat any animal products). I always have to tell my students that vegan is not someone from the planet Vegas. 

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.030
 They were not only weaker than the previous ones but 

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:33.060
 it was also the only team that was below the IMF ceiling. 

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:37.280
 Let's compare vegetarians who eat dairy with vegans. 

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.930
 I would argue that cheese is one of the biggest culprits involved 

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:45.950
 with the difference in mass index between them and makes the first thicker. 

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.060
 This difference is around 7 kg. Does that make sense? Ok. 

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:55.660
 What good is cheese after all? You start with milk. The image is from 

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.270
 a cheese factory in Wisconsin. They receive milk in the morning 

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:06.130
 and empty it into this tank. Then they add some bacteria that give the cheese this strange smell 

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:10.650
 because there is fermentation with the sugars contained in milk. 

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.680
 Then add the rennet. It is an enzyme 

00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:20.760
 present in the stomach (warhead) of a newborn calf, which is now dead. 

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.900
 They remove the enzymes from it and add them to the cheese. 

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.720
 Although coincidentally, 

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:32.400
 this is now an expensive source of enzyme (for industries) 

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:36.970
 and so, in almost all factories now, genetically modified products are used for rennet. 

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:42.140
 In some "traditional" places, such as the factory in Winconson, they boast that they still use beef enzymes. 

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:46.670
 Then let it thicken and strain the whey liquids 

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:51.540
 which is a mixture of water and lactose and some other elements 

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.470
 and then compressed to remove excess water. To what is left as cheese, add salt. 

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:02.160
 What is done with this process is that you get liquid milk and turn it into solid. 

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.650
 This increases calories, concentrates protein, raises cholesterol 

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:12.440
 and fats and most of all, increases sodium (salt). 

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.020
 So ... why am I addicted to it? Why do people like cheese so much? 

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:24.620
 I think there are three reasons. The world likes salty flavors. 

00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.360
 They also like fatty foods. In addition, there are kazomorphins in cheese. 

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:34.640
 So salt is added generously when preparing cheese 

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:38.080
 and this is done to kill the bacteria 

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:43.080
 or to stop further fermentation. So they add a lot of salt 

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:47.940
 and this strengthens the taste that people like so much. The oiliness that is known to everyone 

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:53.440
 and it makes you wash your hands after eating pizza, these animal fats are on all your fingers. 

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:59.700
 I think it's the combination of salty and greasy that people like so much. 

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.000
 For example, french fries and chips. But kazomorphs are interesting. 

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.510
 They are opioids. Have you heard them? These are opioids. 

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.500
 When I say opioids, I mean that chemicals belong to the same category as heroin. 

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:17.810
 Or morphine or demerol (opioid painkiller brand) or any type of painkiller. 

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:21.480
 But they are formed (kazomorphins) as the casein protein 

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.940
 breaks down into digestion. A typical protein is like a chain of beads. 

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:32.090
 You see it through a powerful microscope and observe the amino acids 

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.190
 to join together next to each other. 

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.630
 And you swallow this and the digestive enzymes break it into pieces. 

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.090
 And every "bead" passes into your blood and your body gets these amino acids 

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:48.270
 and synthesizes new proteins. 

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:53.620
 However, dairy does not work that way. Casein enzymes 

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:58.180
 they do give some amino acids but they also give some "chains" ... 

00:15:58.270 --> 00:16:02.910
 This will be in the subject matter ... 

00:16:03.010 --> 00:16:06.490
 These "threads" of four, five, seven amino acids that are biologically active 

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.160
 and go down the digestive tract, 

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.780
 they pass into the blood, they cross the blood-brain barrier 

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:15.270
 and attach themselves to the same brain receptors that heroin would go to! 

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:21.810
 What are they doing there? These are the kazomorphs. 

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:26.280
 Morphine-like compounds derived from casein. 

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:28.960
 They exist because nature simply does not want to leave anything to chance. 

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:36.750
 The baby calf says ... "mother, I don't think I want to breastfeed today, 

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:42.010
 I will go to the forest with my friends. See you on Thursday! ”Or if a human baby 

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.670
 she does not want to breastfeed 

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:47.600
 and moving away from the chest, it is not going to develop properly. 

00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:52.560
 So when the body makes milk, it puts protein, 

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:57.390
 water and some sugars in the form of lactose, 

00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:02.450
 a little fat, some hormones and a little bit of something that makes you feel good. 

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:07.010
 Have you ever looked at a baby's face while breastfeeding? 

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:11.930
 At first they are so intense and then they seem to fall apart and fall asleep. 

00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.260
 And we say, "Isn't the bond between mother and child beautiful?" You just beat the child! (laughter from the audience) 

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.300
 This is part of the underlying bond between mother and baby. 

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:27.500
 And of course, nature assures "don't worry, all mammals are weaned!" 

00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:33.040
 That is, when you no longer need breast milk and you are independent, you will not get milk! 

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.510
 But people are so "creative" that they thought you never need to wean! 

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:42.660
 You can get kazomorphs all your life! And in huge quantities, in fact! 

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:46.790
 The reason for this ... Is it understandable? Ok. This is morphineptin. 

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:51.430
 This kazomorphine has 1/10 of the binding strength in receptors than morphine. 

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.680
 This means that it goes to the brain, clings to us and gives us a slightly nice feeling to want more. 

00:17:56.860 --> 00:18:00.100
 What I just told you is no secret ... 

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.300
 The dairy industry knows them very well, they have done research on them 

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:12.390
 and they want to take advantage of them. So, in cooperation with the US government, 

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.500
 the dairy industry has decided to push the world into cheese addiction. 

00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.370
 I want to show you some slides. They are not my slides. 

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:22.850
 I found them through the US government's free access to information bill. 

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:26.980
 In 2003, the US government, in collaboration with Dairy Association Inc. , (trade union of dairy farmers) 

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:30.940
 co-organized the "Cheese Forum" (as a conference with presentations and discussions). 

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:35.780
 And they wanted to come up with something out of the ordinary. 

00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.500
 "Can we spark a strong desire for cheese?" Here's what they meant ... 

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.990
 They decided that consumers are divided into 2 categories in relation to cheese. Those who eat uncontrollably and those who snack. 

00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:49.570
 The second category will take some cheese and throw it in the salad. 

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:54.240
 This is not the team we want. In the first group, however, they are the ones who will open the refrigerator, 

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:59.120
 they will cut and devour a large piece of cheese, they will put it everywhere on the pizza 

00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:03.690
 and they can double or even triple the amount they eat depending on how you manage the ad. 

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.900
 We want this team ... To repeat ... 

00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:13.920
 These are not my transparencies but those of the US government. That's exactly what they decided to do. 

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:18.870
 So what do we want a complete promotion and advertising program to do? To spark a strong desire for cheese! 

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:24.210
 And how do we do that? You don't go to every neighborhood restaurant to say "please 

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:29.150
 can you promote it If you put it in front of the world, they may keep asking for it. "That would take a century! 

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:34.140
 What the government did was very smart! Fast food chains, 

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:39.050
 they make the decisions in the head offices and apply them to all their branches. 

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.610
 So the government made a contract with Wendy's 

00:19:42.670 --> 00:19:47.520
 which I can show you if you want to see it, and they promoted something called 

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.303
 "Wendy's cheeseburger with bacon for cheddar lovers!" , 

00:19:49.303 --> 00:19:52.020
 as planned by the government. 

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.590
 And about 1.5 million kilos of cheese (380 tons of fat!) Were sold, just for advertising. 

00:19:56.630 --> 00:20:00.230
 That's good ! Too easy ! With a single contract I can sell tons of cheese! 

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.310
 They then partnered with Subway, which had two cheese-free sandwiches. 

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.430
 They fixed this ... They worked with Pizza Hut to make the "Supreme Pizza with Cheese"! 

00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:15.470
 Which had half a kilo of cheese in each serving !!! 

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:19.540
 With Burger King, Taco Bell ... They put on a hat (to the employees) that said, "Oh, the power of cheese!" 

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.590
 And they were told "when people come to the ordering node, you will not just say Welcome to Taco Bell but ask 

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:29.270
 Want to try a quesadilla today? "(Mexican pie with cheese and chicken) Make them suggestions at every opportunity 

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:33.790
 and make sure the cheese is on all the products on the list. 

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:37.660
 By the way, don't be paranoid. That is the way the government works. 

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.570
 They work with the industry to promote farming. 

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.630
 And the health consequences are completely secondary! 

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.010
 In their minds at least ... 

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.150
 Of course, because something is fattening, it's not necessarily a cause for concern. 

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:58.070
 Lard is fattening. It has 9 calories in 1 gram. It's very fattening! 

00:20:58.170 --> 00:21:02.660
 But who eats it? People don't eat a lot of lard. 

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:07.380
 And if something is addictive, it's not necessarily problematic. Coffee is addictive. 

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:12.930
 Tea is addictive. It has caffeine. This is not necessarily a bad thing but 

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.200
 it won't make you weigh 200 pounds. 

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.360
 But if something is addictive and fattening at the same time as cheese, then we are talking about a serious factor in obesity. 

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.650
 Let's talk about health complications. 

00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:31.200
 This is Kathryn Lawrence. Some of you may be familiar with Kathryn 

00:21:31.310 --> 00:21:36.100
 Kathryn is one of the trainers in our Life Food program! I met Kathryn because ... 

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:40.890
 Kathryn grew up in Louisiana. He was an aerospace engineer and worked for the Air Force. 

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:45.520
 And he went to Iraq (in 2003). He was one of the first to go because he had planned 

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:49.910
 military bases. And working there, 

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:54.540
 he worked very hard, eating whatever was available, 

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:59.680
 you don't get fat like that. She returned home after finishing her term. 

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:04.160
 And her friends often took her out to eat. 

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:08.580
 She loved eating in Louisiana. Especially cheese, shrimp cheetos, etc. 

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:13.480
 A friend of hers noticed that she loves spaghetti with cheese in a box. 

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:16.880
 You know, these packaged spaghetti with cheese that students usually eat (because of the low cost). 

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:22.100
 She loved them and so a friend of hers gave her a whole box! For 48 days he ate only these! 

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:27.170
 Packaged spaghetti with cheese! 

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:30.710
 Kathryn began to complain that something was wrong with her body. 

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:36.460
 He began to gain weight and developed a condition called "endometriosis." Do you know her 

00:22:37.170 --> 00:22:41.620
 It starts with severe stomach pains. 

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.980
 And the period cycle is disturbed. 

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:47.760
 What happens is that some endometrial cells leave 

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.620
 and spread to other areas of the abdomen. 

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.300
 They begin to swell and contract constantly and cause 

00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.390
 great pain! It even leads to infertility. And it was getting worse .... 

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:04.250
 The doctor told her: "Kathryn, I know you wanted to have children 

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.820
 but you are not going to have children. There is only one cure for you. 

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:14.680
 You need surgery. You need a hysterectomy. " 

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.530
 Keep that thought ... A friend of hers told her this 

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:24.530
 "You know dairy has hormones. Why don't you eat a vegetarian diet?" 

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.660
 Here is the science behind it. 

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.560
 A cow does not produce milk unless it is pregnant. 

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.990
 Like all mammals, they become pregnant, give birth and produce milk. 

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:41.330
 As the pregnancy progresses ... 

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:47.740
 hormones are produced in the cow's body 

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:52.750
 and you can measure them in the blood plasma and these hormones end up in milk. 

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:57.610
 Here you go! And the majority of milk you've ever drunk 

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:02.590
 and is on store shelves, comes from pregnant cows. 

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.480
 Because they make them permanently pregnant. 

00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:13.250
 And they have a lot of estrogen in them that matches your estrogen! 

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:17.300
 Does that affect us? Does it affect women? 

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:22.910
 I do not know ! But researchers are looking for it and the findings are interesting. 

00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:26.300
 In 2010, Australian researchers studied 766 menopausal women. 

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.780
 That means they would have nothing to do with high estrogen. 

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:36.820
 They were divided into 4 groups depending on how many dairy products they ate. 

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:42.010
 The group on the left (green) are the ones who avoid dairy. 

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:46.920
 The other three groups often consumed dairy products. What really seems to make a difference is 

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:51.770
 "Do you eat them or not?" From the moment people eat them in sufficient quantities, 

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:55.500
 their blood is filled with estradiol. 

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.660
 Men watch out! Researchers at the University of Rochester in New York, 

00:25:00.850 --> 00:25:04.420
 they went to a fertility clinic and did research with questionnaires 

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:09.330
 asking if they belong to a low-fat cheese group eating half a serving of cheese a day 

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.950
 or if they belong to a high-consumption group by eating 1-2.5 servings a day. 

00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:18.610
 And they compared sperm counts and found that those who avoided cheese 

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.530
 had better sperm counts than frequent consumers who were very low. 

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.000
 This may be due to 

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:31.830
 that there are female hormones in milk because cows are permanently pregnant and with each glass of milk you get estradiol? 

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:35.710
 I do not know ! But Kathryn said, "Let's try it!" 

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.720
 He became a vegan and went for exams again. 

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.470
 Her doctor did another laparoscopy. 

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:50.810
 And he looked and looked until he stopped. 

00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.790
 The exam is over. The doctor came out and told her husband 

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.840
 "It simply came to our notice then. 

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:03.740
 Endometriosis has completely disappeared! " 

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:07.010
 Her husband replied, "It's amazing! 

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:12.030
 I didn't expect the diet to work but it felt better and better. It's wonderful!" 

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:17.110
 And the doctor said, "No! It's impossible for this to happen from the diet. That's it 

00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:19.560
 miracle !!! " 

00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:25.520
 Medical science works miraculously. He lost weight, the endometriosis disappeared, he has two children! 

00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:32.740
 And now she's one of our dietitians on the Food for Life program. 

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:37.780
 She shares her story and invites people to believe that it is worth seeing if asparagus can help you! 

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:42.770
 This is Kathryn today! This is Mark Ramirez from Detroit. He grew up in Texas. 

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:47.300
 Mark played (American) football for the University of Michigan and if you weigh 150 kilos this is good 

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:52.600
 if your job is to break the line of defense of your opponents. 

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:58.310
 However, after the end of their athletic career, they did not manage to lose weight 

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.610
 and began to eat enough meat and cheese 

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.370
 He gained more weight, developed diabetes and high blood pressure 

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:09.310
 and erectile dysfunction that many men have 

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:13.780
 and as you may or may not know, erectile dysfunction is not caused by "performance anxiety." 

00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.610
 Erectile dysfunction is caused by narrowing of the arteries. 

00:27:19.890 --> 00:27:24.450
 And just as stenosis can cause heart and brain problems, it affects all male organs. 

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.770
 And what Viagra does is open up a bit of the arteries that have been clogged with so many years of poor nutrition. 

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:34.700
 It opens them a little. That's all it takes. 

00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:38.520
 After all, Mark had these problems. And he was taking a lot of medicine. 

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.990
 I want to analyze a little bit how diabetes works. 

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:49.440
 This is the same cell I showed you before. 

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:54.360
 If you have diabetes ... You have glucose, 

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:59.250
 sugar, in your blood trying to get into the cell 

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.730
 to give energy to the cell. This is what glucose does. 

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:06.470
 The problem with diabetes is that instead of getting into the cell, 

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:11.130
 Glucose collects in the bloodstream and you need to measure it. 

00:28:11.250 --> 00:28:15.690
 If it got into the cell, everything would be fine. You need insulin to get into the cell. 

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:21.080
 Insulin is the key to the hormone made in the pancreas 

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:25.520
 and goes into the blood and emerges on the surface of the blood 

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:30.730
 and clings to this red receiver like the key to the lock 

00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.310
 and makes these channels open and accept glucose into the cell. 

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:41.280
 That's the way it should be, but if you have type 2 diabetes, 

00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:43.870
 you have glucose, insulin, receptors, you have it all! 

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:51.080
 But you also have ... intramuscular lipid! 

00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:54.760
 Fat to grow in the cell! And that prevents the process from working properly! 

00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:59.350
 When I was a child in North Dakota, some kids made fun of their neighbors. 

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:04.710
 When you were not home, they would come to the front door 

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.850
 and they put chewing gum in the lock and then ran and hid behind the bushes. 

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.390
 You would go home, take out the keys, put them in the lock ... 

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:17.250
 you were trying to lock them in and they wouldn't come in! 

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:22.280
 And you looked at the key and it was fine. But either you'll go out the window for a lifetime or 

00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:27.210
 you would call someone to clean the lock. It was a hoax. 

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:31.000
 You do not have chewing gum in the cell. You have fat! 

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:36.260
 Typical diabetes therapies overlook this. They don't face it. 

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:40.370
 In a vegetarian diet, you eliminate fat from your diet 

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:44.280
 and this begins to decrease inside the cell. And so the signaling, the normal process, 

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:51.480
 starts working again. Diabetes improves and in some cases is cured. 

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:56.680
 And that's what happened to Mark! Mark was constantly improving and the doctor 

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:02.700
 she finally said, "Mark, I don't know what you're doing! Your blood sugar is so low that you don't need medication!" 

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.830
 Finally, the diagnosis of diabetes was recorded! Diabetes is gone. He followed a vegetarian diet, the years passed 

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:12.900
 and it is impossible without diabetes and without health problems. 

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:17.860
 Let's talk about asthma. This is Chad from Portsmouth. 

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:23.060
 Chad was a very active child. He liked sports but he didn't 

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.780
 He could play baseball due to asthma as he had a seizure after exercise. 

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.840
 Because of the pollen that had smelled. 

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:37.630
 He had a lot of allergies. He was allergic to dust, various environmental factors, and animals 

00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:42.590
 If he went to a friend's house, he couldn't stand their dog and their cat. 

00:30:42.850 --> 00:30:46.890
 And someone, when he was 18, told him 

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:53.060
 "Do dairy products cause it? Why don't you avoid it?" 

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.060
 And he did! He ruled them out. Within 3 months (!!!) not only the asthma had disappeared 

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:04.010
 but also his allergies! But why ; 

00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:09.000
 In a way, avoiding milk antigens 

00:31:09.110 --> 00:31:13.250
 he made his body react differently. 

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:18.080
 Scientists have investigated. Can dairy products worsen asthma? 

00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:23.120
 If you go to google and click asthma dairy ("asthma dairy"), 

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:28.430
 The first thing that comes to mind is the National Council for Asthma 

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:33.460
 of Australia who conducted a survey answering this very question. 

00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:37.610
 "Dairy products have often been accused of triggering asthma. 

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:43.490
 However, there are few scientific findings that support such a myth. And unfortunately, 

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:48.440
 Many Australians lose the valuable benefits of consuming milk, cheese and yogurt as they do not eat enough dairy in their daily lives! " 

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.040
 Half a minute ... something is wrong here .... 

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:58.560
 So, I'll look at their website to see who their financiers are! 

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:03.640
 And "Australian Dairy" is one of their six sponsors while the other 5 are pharmaceutical companies. 

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.590
 So one has profits if you buy cheese 

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:10.890
 while others have gains if you get sick and stay sick. 

00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.540
 So, 

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.710
 I looked at the research that had been cited, saying that there was no correlation. 

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:23.870
 They were not big studies but I looked at them. One was from New York University in 1991 

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.190
 with 11 adult asthmatics and drank whole milk with little fat or water. 

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:32.210
 What they showed was that if they drank whole milk, 

00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:37.050
 the gases passing through the lungs worsened. 

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.450
 And they thought it was due to milk fat. 

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:46.180
 So the cheese would be even worse ... Then there was a study with children from the United Kingdom. 

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:51.700
 The children were between the ages of 3-14 and were put on a diet without any milk or eggs 

00:32:51.830 --> 00:32:56.560
 for 8 weeks. And the way you look at asthma, 

00:32:56.670 --> 00:33:00.940
 if you know someone who has asthma or if you have one, try to see if the child 

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:05.870
 can easily exhale, expel air. Because it's worse there. 

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.290
 What they found was that as long as they stayed away from eggs and dairy, 

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.730
 the ability to exhale was much, much better! It really helped them clean up. 

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:18.840
 This study lasted 8 weeks and coincidentally, Easter was in the middle of this period. 

00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:24.080
 They went to the chocolate factory and asked if there were chocolate bunnies without milk. 

00:33:24.180 --> 00:33:29.130
 They didn't ... So these kids got a lot better. Eventually, I couldn't find any clues 

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:33.930
 to reject this but people have not given enough importance because no one makes money 

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.680
 if you stop consuming milk. But all the evidence I've seen 

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:42.250
 and many, many cases of people, all show that it is worth trying. 

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:47.710
 This is Chad! He has no allergies, no asthma, he has his own dog 

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:51.240
 he is not allergic to his dog or other dogs 

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:55.500
 and works at the RouxBe cooking school which as some of you know has a great program, the Culinary RX 

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:59.870
 where doctors say “let us guide you to use these 

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:04.980
 nutritional techniques to see if you can improve. " 

00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:09.760
 Migraines! Many people have migraines. This is Lauren. 

00:34:10.410 --> 00:34:15.180
 Lauren, 23, is a law student. One day at school, 

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:19.530
 her eyesight began to "narrow", she was in great pain 

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:24.290
 in the middle of her head, she was nauseous and vomited. 

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:27.280
 And she wasn't impressed ... 

00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:33.990
 Because she was a member of her family who had the same symptoms and knew it was a migraine. 

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:39.130
 The word comes from the Greek. "Half" means half, "skull", half head. 

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:44.060
 Because very often the pain is in half of the head. Very intense. 

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:48.930
 It lasts a long time. If you are moving, 

00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:53.360
 or it has a lot of light or a loud sound, it drives you crazy 

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:57.640
 and it can last all night or even 2 days and makes it difficult for you no matter what you do. 

00:34:58.250 --> 00:35:03.050
 And anyone who has had migraines has heard of the foods that trigger them. 

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:07.770
 Cheeses, sausages, fermented foods, etc. 

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:11.800
 What they tell you, on every relevant page 

00:35:12.210 --> 00:35:15.980
 is that these foods have Tyrosine which is converted to Tyramine 

00:35:16.100 --> 00:35:19.990
 and it strains your brain. True. 

00:35:20.130 --> 00:35:24.940
 But we've seen a lot of people with migraines that are triggered by something else. 

00:35:25.530 --> 00:35:27.690
 It is not necessary to be this (tyramine). 

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:33.540
 The Children's Hospital of London, 1983, 

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.130
 began researching children's migraines. They took 88 children 

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:41.040
 and put on a diet that excluded certain foods. 

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:43.150
 Not just dairy but other allergenic foods. 

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.550
 78 children stopped having headaches 

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:52.740
 while 4 had partial improvement. That's good. 

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:57.250
 In adults we do not see this degree of improvement but we see up to 50% 

00:35:57.350 --> 00:36:02.170
 and may be triggered by those other than dairy 

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:07.010
 However, dairy products are the ones that are mentioned more often, even if you suffer from migraines 

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:12.100
 and you can't function properly and you're constantly taking medication, 

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:16.620
 it's really worth trying to cut them and see how you evolve. Lauren is now free of migraines. 

00:36:17.050 --> 00:36:20.750
 Let's talk about rheumatoid arthritis. If you see your joints 

00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:25.780
 If you have arthritis, your joints are inflamed. 

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:30.700
 Articular lining is bad ... It has inflammation. 

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:34.850
 He has inflammations because he is being attacked by the immune system 

00:36:35.450 --> 00:36:39.890
 which has been activated by a protein that has invaded your body. 

00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:45.100
 This is how the immune system works. A virus and its proteins enter 

00:36:45.210 --> 00:36:49.300
 activate the immune response. This may not be a virus 

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:53.690
 but some other type of protein that entered the body. 

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:58.660
 And what proteins do people get when they are sensitive to milk protein? 

00:36:59.000 --> 00:36:59.810
 Well... 

00:36:59.810 --> 00:37:04.360
 The researchers studied it and began with a case study in 1985 

00:37:04.370 --> 00:37:09.300
 One girl had advanced childhood arthritis 

00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:14.220
 and a doctor suggested, a conscientious doctor, 

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:19.170
 he offered to cut her dairy to see if they were to blame. The symptoms have disappeared! 

00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:24.000
 Then she went to visit her grandmother who gave her chocolates. 

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:29.210
 And her symptoms are back! He cut them again and the symptoms disappeared. 

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:34.120
 And a pediatrician said that this is not possible and look at calcium. 

00:37:34.210 --> 00:37:38.590
 And one of her symptoms disappeared, one was cured until the pattern was obvious. 

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:43.680
 They published the results of the research in the journal of the Royal Medical Academy as a case study. 

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.700
 There may be other people whose diet is affected by arthritis. 

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:53.990
 Dietary triggering does not happen to everyone but 

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:59.030
 in about 20-60% of patients, according to studies. 

00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:03.750
 In Oslo, Norway, patients were put on fasting with juice and then 

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:08.360
 in a vegan diet and then in a vegetarian diet but already from the first month 

00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:12.310
 found clear correlations between improvement in symptoms and diet as well as improvement in biomarkers, 

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.360
 less pain, less swelling, etc. John McDougall in a study in Santa Rosa, 

00:38:16.580 --> 00:38:21.500
 He used a low-fat vegan diet and found that in 4 weeks 

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:26.210
 saw immediate improvement, especially in individuals 

00:38:26.350 --> 00:38:30.010
 who had recently developed rheumatoid arthritis. 

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.720
 Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers. 

00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.120
 And for many, many years, researchers have said that it is something related to milk. 

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.770
 Countries with the highest dairy consumption index also had the highest rates of prostate cancer. 

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:49.790
 At Harvard, a study of doctors' health showed that 

00:38:50.010 --> 00:38:54.910
 in 20,885 doctors, 2.5 servings of cheese 

00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:58.890
 per day increase the chances of prostate cancer by 34%. 

00:38:59.650 --> 00:39:03.940
 They also conducted another study to monitor the health of health workers. 

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:08.940
 and found the same. More milk, more prostate cancer. In this case, at 60%. 

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:13.540
 Well, what we think is happening is that the effect 

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:18.800
 of hormones from milk, triggers the onset of cancer or 

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:23.690
 most likely, its rapid, aggressive evolution. 

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:28.310
 So instead of cancer cells dying, they grow and grow. 

00:39:28.910 --> 00:39:32.900
 This is Chicago. In the health and aging program, 

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:37.610
 researchers have looked at the disease that may be the scariest of all! 

00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:43.340
 They took hundreds of men and women and asked them about their diet. 

00:39:43.570 --> 00:39:48.470
 And as the years went by, they noticed who had Alzheimer's. 

00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:52.830
 And the first foods they put on the list were the ones I knew well and I know as a child that grew up in North Dakota ... 

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:58.160
 My mom had 5 kids and we went down to the kitchen. 

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.390
 He used a fork to pick up the bacon from the pan 

00:40:01.450 --> 00:40:05.900
 and put it on napkins to drain 

00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:10.200
 and then carefully lift the hot pan 

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:15.220
 and pour the excess fat into a jar. Did your mom do that too? 

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:20.170
 He would save it. And he didn't put it in the fridge but on the shelf 

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:24.590
 why did he know that when the fat cools on its own, what happens to it? It hardens, it becomes solid. 

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:28.460
 And that's a sign that it's full of saturated fat. 

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:33.610
 These are the bad fats that raise your cholesterol. And of course, the next day, he put it back in the pan 

00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:37.650
 and fried eggs. It is a miracle that her children managed to grow up. But we did it. 

00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.450
 But the No. 1 source is not the bacon but the dairy! 

00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:46.430
 And meat is No. 2. And some people in Chicago 

00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:51.160
 they don't eat a lot of saturated fat. Around 13 gr. per day while others eat a lot, around 25g. 

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:55.980
 And the researchers said, ok ... Are these two groups the same? 

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.330
 In relation to how much they developed Alzheimer's, what risk did they have? And here are the numbers. 

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:04.410
 These are the ones who ate a little fat (in green) and those who ate a lot. 

00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:09.690
 They did the research again, focusing on trans fats. 

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:14.620
 The fats that are in snacks. And the data they found is almost the same as those in heart disease. 

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:19.210
 If you eat bad fats, 

00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:23.480
 you have a high risk. If you avoid it, it is low risk. It is amazing. 

00:41:23.570 --> 00:41:28.290
 And what they are showing us is that those of us who used to think that Alzheimer's is 

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:33.000
 purely genetic ... Genes are in two categories. 

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:38.000
 The genes that act dictatorially that give orders! You will have blue eyes! 

00:41:39.250 --> 00:41:44.240
 But Alzheimer's genes are more like committees. They make suggestions ... 

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.390
 You may be developing Alzheimer's. But it depends on your lifestyle. 

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:54.070
 You may develop diabetes ... Many of the gene diseases do not belong to the "dictatorial" genes. 

00:41:54.210 --> 00:41:59.110
 It's not "all or nothing". Whether they occur depends largely on what you do in your life. 

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:04.270
 Cheese and dairy are overwhelmingly the biggest sources 

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:08.420
 saturated fats in the American diet. Even when people say "avoid them," 

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:13.700
 do not go to the next step to say "do not consume dairy products that are full of saturated" 

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.310
 I would like to change the subject and yes 

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:22.850
 talk about issues that are not directly related to health but 

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:26.170
 are an incentive for many people and if they make sense to you, 

00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:31.200
 I would like to share with you some facts that you may not have thought of. When I went home to Fargo, 

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:36.010
 where I grew up, I took these photos. Beautiful corn meadows 

00:42:36.350 --> 00:42:40.720
 extending as far as the eye can see. Identical plants, (laughs) 

00:42:42.050 --> 00:42:46.850
 genetically modified corn that no human will ever consume. 

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:51.640
 These are for cows, pigs and chickens. 

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:56.180
 And you can't grow ... Americans eat 

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:01.360
 one million animals every hour (!!!). You can't raise so many animals 

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:06.360
 without fertilizers and watering etc. 

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:11.350
 And if you have to water, you will use a lot of water. Here are the numbers. If you brush your teeth 

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:16.160
 and let the tap run, you will consume about 3.5 liters of water. 

00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:20.390
 If you take a nice shower, about 75 liters. 

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.040
 Washing your car, 246 liters. 

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.990
 But to produce 3.5 liters of milk, the water will be needed 

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:34.820
 to water the food that the animal will eat for these 3.5 liters, is 2.5 tons !!! 

00:43:35.170 --> 00:43:39.990
 And this is for 3 kilos of clover. No man will ever eat so much. 

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:41.990
 This all goes to cows. 

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:43.990
 The fertilizer used in the crops, 

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:48.690
 then goes to the rivers and streams. The nitrogen and the phosphorus 

00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:52.770
 they go into river waters and cause overgrowth of algae 

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:56.630
 and other forms of life are killed. 

00:43:56.830 --> 00:44:01.710
 And if you look at the bottom of Mississippi, where all our water ends up, below Louisiana in Texas. 

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:07.010
 There is a dead zone as big as New Jersey. 

00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:11.170
 And that's primarily because they use fertilizers 

00:44:11.310 --> 00:44:15.640
 to grow food for the animals so that you get the small amount of food you get from the animal. 

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:21.140
 Climate change ... I don't need to tell you ... This was a controversial issue, 5 years ago. 

00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:26.210
 It is no longer controversial. Everyone knows that watering cows releases methane. 

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:32.080
 It comes out of their mouths as their stomachs digest them and produce methane 

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:37.110
 and they flow it. And how much can they produce? There are about 100 million cows. 

00:44:37.170 --> 00:44:41.770
 And if you put them all on one side of the scales and the people on the other, 

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:46.850
 our cows gain a lot of weight ... 

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:50.330
 And they are constantly producing methane as well as other chemicals that affect the greenhouse effect. 

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:54.390
 And cows produce something else ... 

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.220
 This is a dung beetle. And the reason I'm showing you this is because this beetle is creative in doing things 

00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.590
 with manure ... This is the secretary of the Ministry of Rural Development. (laugh) 

00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.370
 If you go to a typical dairy, each cow produces in one day 

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:15.450
 about 30 liters of milk. 

00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.710
 I will not use manure but chocolate milk as an example. 

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:23.730
 About 57 liters of manure are produced. 

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:28.570
 In other words, for every 1 liter of milk, about 2 liters of manure are produced. 

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:33.960
 Where do I put so much manure? For someone who already has it all, you can get him a "manure digger"! (the smart digester: -P) 

00:45:34.310 --> 00:45:39.110
 And you will see these in every dairy unit and you can also subscribe to the magazine for "Manure Management"! 

00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:42.100
 Have you seen that? That's awesome ! They also have the Kopria Trade Fair. 

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:47.530
 It took place in Chesabergsburg, Pennsylvania, but there is a whole world out there. 

00:45:47.590 --> 00:45:52.330
 by people trying to figure out how to manage the manure and how to make money from it. 

00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:58.410
 Ethical Issues .... There are no ethical issues with dairy. 

00:45:58.530 --> 00:46:02.130
 Since they do not kill cows. Correctly ; Cows give you milk. 

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:08.290
 Well ... If you go to the website 

00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:12.040
 of the United Nations on nutrition and agriculture, you will find a guide for small farms 

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:15.760
 to see how you can do it yourself. 

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:20.430
 And these are not my slides. They are UN slides with these graphic representations ... 

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.640
 "How do we get milk?" You have to get sperm first. 

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:27.100
 And they use an artificial colon ... I don't invent these, I can't imagine them. 

00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:32.550
 If you get a "bay dummy", so they say, 

00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:37.160
 and with it you get semen from the bull, 

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:41.630
 then you take it with your left hand and put it in the anus of the cow ... 

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:47.020
 Every glass of milk you've ever drunk came from this process. 

00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.290
 You take your left hand, you put it in the anus of the cow. Through the rectal wall, you feel the uterus. 

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:55.350
 Then you take with your right hand a device like a needle, which has the sperm inside and 

00:46:55.430 --> 00:46:59.840
 you pass it to the cervix to inject it. This will make the cow pregnant. 

00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:04.960
 And the moment you do, you spray the cow on the side. That's what it looks like. 

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.590
 And nine months later, she will give birth. 

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:14.760
 However, if the baby calf stays with his mom 

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:19.950
 this will hurt my industry because it will drink the milk and I will not be able to sell it. So the calf ends up in a loader. 

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:25.390
 If the baby is male, he will become a calf quickly. (and so it will be slaughtered quickly) 

00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.460
 If it's female, I can use it. 

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:32.440
 But I will not let her drink the milk. I will give her a replacement and put her in this cage 

00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:37.720
 until she is ready and fat to get pregnant (and produce milk). 

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:42.330
 They have them chained so they can't react anyway to getting them pregnant all the time. 

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:47.130
 And they make them pregnant every year and produce milk until they are about 4 years old 

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:52.300
 whereupon they lose their productive age. So, if I kill you and replace you 

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:57.020
 with a newer cow, I get more milk for each feeding unit. 

00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:02.140
 Although life expectancy for cows is much higher, they kill about 4 years old. 

00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:06.030
 This is from the newspaper in Newburyport, Massachusetts. 

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:10.250
 Strange sounds were coming from the boulevard near the Livestock Farm "Iliachtida", on Monday night 

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:15.700
 and until yesterday morning, they led the local police to reassure the annoyed citizens as 

00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.780
 it was not something haunted or scary. 

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:23.450
 According to Patty Fisher, head of the Newbury department, the sounds came from the mourning cows of the mothers. 

00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:28.920
 for the separation of their young babies. "It happens every year," he said. 

00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:33.850
 And if you go to a dairy, you will see the mother cow giving birth 

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:38.470
 and then lick her baby and the baby calf perches on his mother and the breeder chases it away. 

00:48:38.850 --> 00:48:43.410
 And then the breeder takes the calf, puts it in a stroller and takes it away. 

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:48.130
 And the cow gets up and follows him and tries to stop him. 

00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:53.130
 The breeder always wins and then the cows cry every night. 

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:58.160
 And people in the dairy industry know this and call it a "reflex reaction." 

00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:03.090
 But there is no greater bond in nature 

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:08.070
 from the bond between mother and baby. 

00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:12.960
 Because if this bond did not exist for the mother to do everything to raise the baby, the species would not survive. 

00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:17.630
 And the dairy industry is demanding that this bond be broken! Otherwise you can't sell 

00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:22.490
 the product for which you polished the cow. This is your product, not theirs ... 

00:49:22.610 --> 00:49:27.370
 In females then, they "decode". They cut their horns because they can hit you. 

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:32.260
 This is called "decapitation" or upper amputation if you do it at a very young age. They do not use anesthetic. 

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:36.730
 So, of course, they kill them! 

00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:41.450
 This image is from May 2015. They sent 214,000 cows to the slaughter. 

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:45.840
 That month only. I will quote this. Did I cheer you up? 

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:52.030
 But things I can eat instead? Of course ! It is very easy ! 

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:54.910
 I don't need to eat this cheese or this pizza. Although they will sell it to me. 

00:49:54.910 --> 00:49:57.490
 And of course... 

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:02.080
 There is nutritional yeast. People eat it because it has a lot of protein 

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:06.660
 but it has this cheese flavor that goes perfectly with pizza and lasagna, etc. 

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:11.670
 And there are so many ingredients to make a pizza 

00:50:11.730 --> 00:50:16.160
 and a million ingredients to accompany a salad. No need to put cheese! 

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:20.560
 And there are so many ways to make lasagna and a bunch of food. So ... 

00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:25.480
 instead of cheese, put hummus in the sandwich. In Fargo (a city in northern Dakota), we have never heard of hummus 

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.650
 but I'm very happy that someone showed it to me because it's very useful! 

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.980
 There are many ways to replace this product (cheese) and feel good! 

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:38.660
 I wrote a book on this subject because I was so ... 

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.810
 so troubled by the fact that no one knows about it. 

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:48.730
 While they are addicted to it. I think if we cut it out of our diet, 

00:50:48.810 --> 00:50:53.350
 We will have already come a long way to get rid of several health problems that afflict us. 

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:58.280
 The foods we want to focus on are fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables, legumes. 

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:02.860
 If we really focus on them, I honestly think we will change a lot of things! 

00:51:05.550 --> 00:51:07.550
 But you will tell me "Wait! You are a dreamer ... 

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:13.160
 People love them and are addicted to them. You said it! Who will cut it? 

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:18.130
 And there's a huge industry out there to fight you 

00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:22.800
 because if you claim that there is a better choice or vegan cheese, then they will not work! 

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:26.960
 They have political influence and the government on their side! "And yet, here's why we win ... 

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:36.370
 A generation ago, I was at the hospital where I worked, at George Washington University Hospital. 

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:41.400
 and we had a disagreement about whether we could ban smoking in hospitals. 

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:45.830
 Patients really liked to smoke .... Our patients would even smoke in bed, as long as the oxygen was not open. 

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:51.890
 We sold cigarettes in the gift shop ... and I bought them. I was buying Merit Menthols 

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:55.910
 and I turned it on as I went down to the doctors' living room, 

00:51:56.010 --> 00:52:00.380
 the director of surgery was with me, he was taking Marlboros, 

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:05.320
 and we smoked in the hallway. And we weren't stupid. We knew that cigarettes cause cancer but we also knew we had time ... 

00:52:06.810 --> 00:52:11.560
 It takes time ... If I cut it, I'll be fine. 

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:15.850
 So ... at some point we thought "Okay, end of year! We have to cut it. 

00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.730
 And to be precise, we have to be role models! Let's ban smoking in the hospital. But it was controversial. 

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.540
 There were big industries and a lot of people who wanted the product. Can we do it? 

00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:29.400
 We made the decision and within two weeks, we knew we were right! 

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:34.320
 And all the hospitals then did the same! And then, every restaurant and every public building. 

00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:39.160
 And every building and every airline, etc. Everyone made the same decision and everyone knew they were right. 

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:43.190
 And this huge political force, 

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.590
 The tobacco industry began to diversify. 

00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:50.730
 They started making other products because they weren't stupid. 

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:55.360
 And they weren't deliberately immoral. At least not in the beginning. They started growing tobacco 

00:52:56.450 --> 00:53:01.290
 because no one knew, when the industry started it, that it was causing lung cancer. 

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:05.610
 But the industry has changed and there is no one on the planet who can ignore it. 

00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:10.900
 It may be a cold February morning and someone in Washington ends a cigarette outside. 

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:16.110
 before allowing him to enter the building where smoking is prohibited. 

00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:19.950
 At this point we are now with food. We know we have a problem. 

00:53:21.710 --> 00:53:26.650
 We know that if we change our diet we can benefit and we know when we look at our children 

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:31.190
 that it is the sickest generation ever. (unhealthy) 

00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:35.450
 But I don't know ... the food is so delicious ... the industries are so strong, you can't fight them ... 

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:40.150
 But half a minute .... End of year! 

00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:47.240
 The time frame is over! And we need to make some changes now! 

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.570
 And the way to make these changes is not by waving your finger, making people feel guilty. 

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:54.700
 The way to make a difference is to inform people and really convey the information to them 

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:57.900
 and that's why I love what's going on here ... We exchange information 

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:02.740
 and recipes and we discuss what works for everyone. 

00:54:02.830 --> 00:54:07.490
 And we're having a good time with that! 

00:54:07.690 --> 00:54:12.300
 You can have a good time with the food and the flavors! And there are even ridiculous things about food! 

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:16.840
 There are fantastic recipes, wonderful products, very nice websites and books 

00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:20.910
 and when you see all this you understand that this is not an "deprivation" but an adventure! 

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.950
 And people feel liberated when they discover so many new things they can take advantage of! 

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:31.060
 And I'm sure that one February morning, not far from now, 

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:36.180
 There will be someone shivering from the cold outside a building in Washington and eating the last bite of a chicken wing 

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:39.580
 before allowing him to enter the vegan building !!! I want to see this day! 

00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:45.790
 Thank you very much ! Thank you very much !
