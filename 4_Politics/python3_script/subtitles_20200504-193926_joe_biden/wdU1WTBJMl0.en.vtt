00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.900
This video was made possible by Squarespace.

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.200
After this, watch the video I made for their
channel.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.549
More about it after the video.

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:12.269
Airports are incredibly complex and challenging
businesses but, in many cases, they’re businesses

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.780
that make money.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.030
Many airports are owned by governments but
still then, they’re often operated as businesses—just

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.620
businesses that are publicly owned.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.160
The majority of airports make their money
through what they earn from passenger carrying

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.730
commercial flights using their facilities.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.790
Some airports are cargo focused and fund their
operations through cargo flights but the ones

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.370
that you’ve most heard of, such as London’s
Heathrow Airport, rely almost entirely on

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.989
passenger flights.

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.079
While the amount of cargo going through Heathrow
is significant thanks to passenger aircraft

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.769
transporting cargo in their holds, the number
of dedicated cargo flights is low in proportion

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.219
to the airports 650 daily flights.

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.249
They make their money off of the 78 million
passengers flying through each year.

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:59.350
Heathrow is the busiest airport in the world
that is fully privately owned—the UK government

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.790
owns no stake in it—and so it is perhaps
the best example of an airport built to turn

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.180
a profit.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.260
It costs $1,485,650,000 per year to run Heathrow
airport.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.860
This includes costs like the $494 million
Heathrow pays in salaries to its 6,500 employees.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.660
Now, 76,000 people actually work at Heathrow
but only those 6,500 actually work for Heathrow.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.100
The company that runs Heathrow, Heathrow Airport
Holdings, is only really responsible for the

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.880
oversight and administration of the airport.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.860
Within Heathrow’s walls, though, there are
hundreds of other companies operating.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.680
Those 70,000 other people work for the airlines,
the baggage handling companies, the air traffic

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.940
control company, the restaurants, the rental
car companies, the bus companies, and all

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.410
the other different employers at the airport.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:54.560
There are, of course, plenty of other costs
involved in running the airport from the $232

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.300
million per year in maintenance to the $113
million yearly utility bill for water, electricity,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.370
internet, gas, and more, but overall, that
number, $1.5 billion, is what it costs to

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.170
run the sixth busiest airport in the world.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.980
That’s more than it costs to run the 1.3
million person country of Swaziland.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.580
So how do they pay for that?

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.920
On a per passenger basis, it costs $19 to
run Heathrow Airport.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.350
Essentially, that means Heathrow needs to
make $19 from each passenger that passes through

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.810
its doors in order to break even.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.140
Of course, some passengers are more profitable
than others.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.840
Arriving passengers generally just get off
the plane, go through customs, and leave immediately

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.090
without buying anything while connecting and
departing passengers generally have more time

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.200
to shop at the airport.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.290
Retail is incredibly important to the profitability
of any airport.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.740
This is part of the reason why its in the
airports best interest to make the check-in

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.990
and security process as quick as possible—so
passengers have more time to shop.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.180
Heathrow makes money through retail by receiving
a cut of every sale made.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.709
On average, restaurants earn the airport 95
cents per passenger, retail stores earn them

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.660
$5.15 per passenger, the parking lots add
on another $2.03, then all the other smaller

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.100
sources of retail revenue such as rental car
companies and VIP lounges account for another

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.180
$3.04.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.880
Rather uniquely, Heathrow also operates the
express train from the airport to Paddington

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.210
Station in London which makes them another
$2.15 per passenger.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:28.540
All in all, the airport makes $13.32 from
passengers through purchases on top of their

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.319
actual airplane ticket and, its worth pointing
out, this doesn’t mean that passengers spend

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.930
$13.32—this means that Heathrow makes $13.32
per passenger.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.550
This is their cut—actual spending at the
airport per passenger is much higher.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.970
Now, you may think that this amount of retail
revenue per passenger is high and you’d

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.250
be right, it is.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.800
In fact, it’s one of the highest retail
revenues per passenger of any airport worldwide.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.460
In comparison, Washington Dulles Airport makes
$5.68 per passenger, Auckland Airport makes

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.819
$7.71, and Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport
makes $10.92 per passenger through retail.

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.440
Heathrow is an expert in making passengers
spend.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.690
They use all sorts of tricks and tactics to
increase passenger spending.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.560
For example, in Terminal 3, to get from security
and to the gates, all passengers have to walk

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.740
through duty free which increases sales enormously.

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.630
Heathrow also doesn’t display the gate for
flights until around 45-90 minutes before

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:28.630
departure.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.850
This is common in European airports, but uncommon
elsewhere.

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:36.000
Because of this, passengers wait in the central
area where shops and restaurants are until

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.160
just before their flight which leads to more
time with passengers exposed to the retail

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.280
environment.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.720
Being one of the very few airports with non-stop
service to all six inhabited continents, Heathrow

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.120
also has the advantage of being an airport
focused on long-haul service.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.120
These flights tend to carry the wealthiest
passengers and, while worldwide passengers

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.800
arrive an average of 2 hours and 17 minutes
before their flight, Heathrow passengers arrive

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.919
2 hours and 51 minutes before which means
they have more time to shop at the airport.

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:08.750
As mentioned, though, the airport needs to
make $19 per passenger and retail only earns

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:10.810
them just over $13.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.199
The rest of it comes from flights.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:18.590
Each plane that lands at Heathrow pays the
airport an average of $9,500.

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.130
Of course it varies hugely by aircraft—a
76 seat FlyBe Dash 8 isn’t paying the same

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:30.240
as a 345 seat British Airways 747—but $9,500
is the average per visit to Heathrow.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.950
That goes to pay for things like gate space,
a check in area, and the runway time itself.

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.550
The airport charges a fixed amount per aircraft
landing—for the small Bombardier Dash 8

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.220
it would be $999 while for the large 747 it
would be $11,600.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.610
On departure, airlines are then charged again
this time per passenger.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.500
For each passenger flying to a destination
outside of Europe the airline is charged a

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.169
base of $58 but this charge is reduced if
a passenger connects through Heathrow rather

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.700
than originating or if the aircraft is parked
at a remote stand rather than a gate.

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.930
All in all, a fully loaded 76 seat FlyBe Dash
8 flying a domestic route to Edinburgh, for

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:13.430
example, would be charged about $2,400 for
its whole visit, arrival and departure, while

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.139
that British Airways 747 flying a long-haul
route to New York, for example, would be charged

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:19.259
$31,700.

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:25.520
It’s worth noting that these are the published
prices—in reality, many airlines with significant

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:29.840
numbers of flights at Heathrow have agreements
with the airport that reduce their costs.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.259
Breaking it down, what those numbers mean
is that Heathrow gets, on average, $29 of

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.650
the cost of every passenger’s ticket.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.580
As you can see that means that Heathrow makes
a fair bit more than it costs to run the airport.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.460
The company mostly uses this operating profit
to pay off debt from prior projects and to

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.669
pay taxes so in the end, they’re only truly
making about $8.20 off of each of their passengers,

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:56.180
but what these numbers also mean is that,
by design, Heathrow is incentivized to attract

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.850
long-haul flights.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:00.259
The airport is currently at capacity.

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:05.340
Their maximum number of flights per day is
657 and they currently have 650.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.840
They really have no more capacity which means
one of the only ways for them to grow financially

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.919
is to bring in larger planes.

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:17.940
The 76 seat FlyBe Dash 8 takes up the same
time on the runway that could be used by another

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:23.920
345 seat British Airways 747 while the airport
would make vastly more money by having that

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.350
747 land.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.750
This is no doubt part of the reason why Heathrow
is so poorly connected to the country that

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.229
it’s in—the UK.

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.870
The airport only has flights to eight airports
in the UK which means the airport has exactly

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.950
the same number of destinations in the UK
as it has in China.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:45.009
Meanwhile, Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, in
the Netherlands, has flights to 25 destinations

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:46.110
in the UK.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:50.490
That means that for the vast majority of UK
residents living outside of London, it’s

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.120
easier to connect to wherever they’re going
through Amsterdam than the airport in their

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.530
capital city.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:58.380
The reality is that Heathrow is a commercial
company.

00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:02.880
While most UK residents would likely want
to see domestic flights to their largest airport

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.170
it just doesn’t make commercial sense to
operate short and cheap flights to Heathrow

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:10.169
in the place of highly lucrative long-haul
flights.

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:14.449
It’s not only less lucrative for the airport,
it’s also more costly for the passenger

00:08:14.449 --> 00:08:16.980
than flying to other smaller airports.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.880
Of course, not every airport is like Heathrow.

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.990
Not every airport is a commercial company.

00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:26.259
That’s just because, in many cases, running
an airport the way the public wants it to

00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:28.800
be run is bad business.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.729
About two thirds of all airports worldwide
lose money.

00:08:32.729 --> 00:08:37.590
In many cases that’s because they’re government
run and just not that focused on making money.

00:08:37.590 --> 00:08:42.659
The US is a country that has not yet gotten
around to airport privatization like the UK.

00:08:42.659 --> 00:08:47.420
There is only one single privately owned and
operated airport in the US with commercial

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.170
passenger flights—that’s Branson Airport
in Southern Missouri.

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.910
Unlike Heathrow, which turns a considerable
profit, Branson airport is loosing money and

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.830
has struggled to keep airlines flying there
for more than a few years.

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:03.149
It’s not like Branson was the only attempt
at running a private airport in the US—National

00:09:03.149 --> 00:09:07.990
Express, a UK based transport company, took
over Newburgh airport 60 miles north of New

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:12.670
York City in 2000, but it too failed and sold
the airport back to the government.

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:17.530
The difference between airport privatization
in the US and the UK is that in the US, the

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:21.560
smallest airports went private while in the
UK, the largest airports did.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.430
In the UK, ten of the fifteen busiest airports
are privately owned and operated.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.870
Meanwhile, only four of the fifteen least
busy airports in the country are privately

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:31.870
owned.

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:36.290
That’s because small airports, in most cases,
just don’t make money.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:40.690
Smaller airports being government run and
unprofitable in the US allow for a sort of

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.230
indirect subsidy for airlines to operate there.

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:48.370
In these cases, airports are willingly charging
airlines less than it costs to run the airport

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:51.140
to operate there in order to attract them
to fly there.

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.500
City, county, or state governments are willing
to do this because they view air service as

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.680
a stimulant to economic development.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:01.730
The merits of private versus public airport
ownership can be debated, but proponents of

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.640
publicly owned airports will argue that they’re
essential pieces of infrastructure while those

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.760
for airport privatization will argue that
commercial ownership leads to lower costs

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.100
and better service.

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:15.950
Even in the UK public opinion is split on
whether airports are better off public or

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:16.950
private.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:20.200
What’s sure, though, is that running an
airport, whether public or private, is not

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.380
easy and that the fact that a few hundred
aircraft taking off per day is all it takes

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.850
to fund the multi billion dollar business
of Heathrow is almost as impressive as the

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:30.860
planes themselves.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.360
Now that you’ve finished this video, there’s
another one I made for you to watch.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.589
Squarespace asked me to make a video explaining
why, “design is not a luxury.”

00:10:38.589 --> 00:10:42.500
That phrase might not make sense now but the
whole point of the video I made is to explain

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:44.560
it so make sure to watch it.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:49.170
You can either click the annotation on-screen
now or it’s linked at the top of the description.

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:52.200
Oh, and fair warning, I go on camera in it.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.550
Thanks for watching and we’ll see you again
in two weeks for another Wendover Productions

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.570
video.
