00:00:02.802 --> 00:00:03.970
- [Toby] When your
child is diagnosed

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:05.405
with diabetes as an infant,

00:00:05.405 --> 00:00:07.140
you have to do everything.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.442
Diabetes care is 24/7.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.144
It does not take the night off.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:17.617
David is gonna be one
year old in a few days.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:18.885
(sneezes)

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:22.422
And two days ago he was
diagnosed with diabetes.

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:23.923
He doesn't look
too sad about it.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:24.991
(laughs)

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.559
- Daddy came and got you.

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:28.028
- [Father] Hello, baby David.

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.364
Do you want some?

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.567
He was about 11 months old.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:39.539
And my wife, Toby, was a young
pediatrician at the time.

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:44.944
So she had a really keen eye
for problems in children.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:45.912
- [Tob] One thing
that had happened,

00:00:45.912 --> 00:00:47.213
which was quite scary,

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.516
is I went to get him
out of the car seat,

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.784
and when I went to get him,

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.352
he was just kind of staring.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:56.122
Vacant, eyes open, but vacant.

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.491
It was very alarming,
very unusual behavior.

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:02.395
- [Ed] And so she
brought him in to clinic.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.897
His blood sugar was 800,

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.499
which is eight times the
normal blood sugar level.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.001
She collected him,

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:08.935
put him in the car,

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:10.470
raced out the door and said,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.505
"David has diabetes, and our
lives have changed forever."

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:15.675
And the task was upon us to
manage his blood sugar levels.

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:17.944
We really had two
tools at our disposal.

00:01:17.944 --> 00:01:22.115
We had insulin and
we had glucose,

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.017
sugar, basically.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:25.385
Carbohydrates,

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.121
which is in foods like fruit,

00:01:28.121 --> 00:01:29.189
juices.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:34.327
Foods that would raise
blood sugar, carbohydrates,

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:37.297
we would use to keep his blood
sugar from going too low.

00:01:37.297 --> 00:01:39.132
And then insulin was delivered

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.600
to bring his blood sugar down.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.303
So these things are working
to oppose one another.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.772
And the reason you
need the carbohydrates

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.141
is because you can very
often overdose insulin

00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:49.676
just a little bit.

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:52.378
But even a small amount
of insulin can be lethal.

00:01:52.378 --> 00:01:54.714
We were injecting
him with insulin

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:58.051
with a needle probably
seven times a day.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.653
We were checking his blood
sugar 15 times a day.

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:01.754
That's how we started.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:04.691
When we checked his blood sugar,

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.126
we used his fingers
and his toes,

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.294
so if he was playing with blocks
in the middle of the room,

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.897
I'd come up and I'd
poke him in a toe.

00:02:10.897 --> 00:02:13.099
He had bruises up
and down his arms

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:14.300
for those first two months

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.802
when we were giving
him injections.

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:18.338
That was something that was
really hard for us to see.

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:20.907
(laughs)

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:22.909
(dad laughs)

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.911
You're constantly
in this tension

00:02:24.911 --> 00:02:27.013
between high blood sugar
and low blood sugar,

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:29.549
because neither
extreme is acceptable.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.420
- [Toby] There was so
much work to be done.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.823
So all of my faculties
were focused on

00:02:36.823 --> 00:02:39.058
taking care of this little boy.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:42.462
I guess with my training it was
just too hard to think about

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:44.931
that he would be compromised

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.833
because I didn't do a good job.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.468
And with Ed's personality,

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:49.903
that wasn't gonna happen.

00:02:52.038 --> 00:02:53.072
(Ed laughs)

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:53.873
- Ready, go.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:56.910
Come on, let's go get him.

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:05.952
The scariest prospect that
we, his parents, face,

00:03:05.952 --> 00:03:08.922
is this phenomenon called
dead in bed syndrome.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.423
With people with
type one diabetes,

00:03:10.423 --> 00:03:13.860
there's a small number of
people who go to bed at night,

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.161
and they don't wake up.

00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.764
This is his glucose
level over the past

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:20.700
roughly three hours.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.735
You can see the fact
that he's going down,

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.871
means that if he
weren't about to eat,

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:25.805
he could go low.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.775
But fortunately we're gonna
be feeding him with rice

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:30.243
and things that will
make him go higher.

00:03:30.243 --> 00:03:32.045
- I put the test
strip in the meter.

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:37.617
I draw up some blood,

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:39.819
if it works.

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:44.857
Just scoop up a little
into the test strip.

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:51.231
104.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.768
- I'm just gonna
see how it's going.

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:57.203
All right, give it a stir.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:03:58.871
- Here you go.

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:00.773
- All right, there you go.

00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:02.275
There's the carbohydrates.

00:04:02.275 --> 00:04:05.812
- So David, we need to check
on the blood sugar situation.

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:08.915
We can take good care of David,

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:12.318
day and night, 24/7,
seven days a week.

00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:14.654
But what happens when
he goes to college?

00:04:14.654 --> 00:04:16.723
I wouldn't be there, my
wife wouldn't be there

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.291
to manage his blood
sugars for him,

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.326
or to help him take
care of his diabetes.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.065
And that overriding concern,

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:29.168
worry, and fear that I had

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:31.137
that really
inspired, in my mind,

00:04:31.137 --> 00:04:33.640
the idea of building
a bionic pancreas,

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.708
a system that would basically

00:04:35.708 --> 00:04:38.111
take care of his diabetes
for us in our absence,

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:39.646
automatically.

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:42.315
Better than we could, and
more safely than we could.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.182
I like that idea.

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.985
The fact that Toby's
a pediatrician,

00:04:45.985 --> 00:04:47.453
I was an engineer,

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:49.722
that's really what
started us down that path.

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:54.327
The bionic pancreas really
builds on the shoulders

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:59.165
of decades of technology
development in medical devices.

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:03.503
It comes from the synthesis of
continuous glucose monitors,

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:07.974
from insulin pumps
from smart phones.

00:05:07.974 --> 00:05:10.843
And it's the integration
of those three technologies

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.912
that makes a system
which is really better

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:15.315
than the sum of its parts.

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.850
It's basically got automated
decision making software

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.353
that determines how much
drug to deliver to the person

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.056
with type one diabetes
every five minutes.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.258
It makes 288 decisions every day

00:05:25.258 --> 00:05:26.859
that you no longer have to make.

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:30.596
- Well, a dad's invention
to save his diabetic son

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:33.833
could change the
lives of millions of
people with diabetes.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.035
It is today's big idea.

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:39.405
Ed Damiano developed
the bionic pancreas.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:42.342
- How confident are you that
your dad can meet this goal

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.311
and make this deadline to get
you off to college safely?

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:47.613
- I don't doubt
that he can do it.

00:05:47.613 --> 00:05:50.016
It's definitely
very challenging.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.552
But if anyone could
do it, my dad could.

00:05:57.623 --> 00:05:59.659
I think what we have
to look forward to

00:05:59.659 --> 00:06:01.928
is that our device will
play a meaningful role

00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:03.262
in keeping all those people

00:06:03.262 --> 00:06:04.797
with type one
diabetes who use it

00:06:04.797 --> 00:06:08.101
safe and healthy until
there is a biological cure.
