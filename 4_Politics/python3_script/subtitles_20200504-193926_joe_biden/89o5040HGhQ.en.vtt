00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.770
in today's video we're going to make a
close equivalent to an n95 mask with

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.880
very common household materials without
the need for sewing vacuum cleaner bags

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.880
cotton or wearing citrus fruit on your
face so for my regular viewers I've put

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.990
some of my other planned videos on hold
this video is a little bit more serious

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.320
but I thought it was good information
and wanted to get it out as quickly as

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.740
possible so let's be around than usual
maybe now after two weeks and countless

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.850
hours in the shed plus many failed tests
I've finally worked out a pretty good

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.469
recipe so anyone can make a clothes
equivalent to an n95 mask which at a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.340
minimum could be created with just a
nine and a pair of scissors in about ten

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.870
minutes but with a few extra tools these
can also be batch made quite quickly

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.010
best of all is materials you probably
have in abundance in your home right now

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.739
obviously a proper tested n95 or p2
respirator is always a best choice but

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.210
if you can't get one this could be a
close match in filtration great fitment

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.650
yet can be made easily personally I
would definitely wear this rather than a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.180
cotton mask with sewing holes in it and
edge legs even over a surgical mask but

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.799
it's probably not as good as an airtight
plastic bag on your head yeah co2 is

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.280
going to make the problems fade away
maybe like yourself I did a bit of

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.200
research early on as to what some good
filtration alternatives are to n95 and

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.450
p2 respirators it seems that vacuum bags
came up a lot I went to investigate this

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.400
option however it turns out in all three
of our vacuum cleaner devices that it's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.820
not 1990 then there's a furnace filter
option which was a bargain at five

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.229
hundred dollars postage but in all
seriousness these alternatives could be

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.770
good ideas but there's still the
fundamental problem with these which is

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.579
supply even if they're accessible now
demand suddenly goes through the roof

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.140
and then they're just as hard to get as
an actual in ninety five mask I thought

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.159
a good approach to this would be rather
than improvising a mask with alternative

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.100
materials
maybe attempt to replicate one as close

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.689
as possible while making the process
accessible to everyone

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:12.090
so my next move was to have a good look
at an actual m95 mask luckily I have a

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.450
good variety of used ones
knocking around in the shed looking at

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.770
these and doing some research online
almost all masks are made from nonwoven

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.120
polypropylene which has great air and
water filtering properties it's not a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.660
popular textile in the clothing industry
but the good news is it's extremely

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.030
popular in almost everything else it's
pretty easily identifiable by the matrix

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.569
of dots on it and can be found in
varying thicknesses in everything from

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.580
reusable shopping bags to cheap aprons
disposable painting overalls suit covers

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.660
and I even managed to find some
lightweight material in gauze in the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.700
first-aid kit so I grabbed a bunch of
different samples first I was concerned

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.450
that dots themselves may be a passage
for air but in checking it out on my

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.319
son's ten dollar microscope surprisingly
I was able to get a really good idea of

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.160
the structure sorry these shots aren't
the best and just take it on my phone

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.150
but it turns out the dots are pressed
and sealed making them look translucent

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.290
I then dissected the layers of the masks
I had on hand and comparing the masks to

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.519
the nonwoven material it appears to have
the exact same fiber size even with

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.209
similar air gaps on some but the other
aspect that makes this material really

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.840
great for this purpose is that it can be
plastic welded so there are no stitch

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.880
holes so what we'll be doing is making a
flat fold style mask using multiple

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.170
layers of material to get a nice deep
diffusion with the few refinements I've

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.459
done to allow different elastic strap
options as well as some changes to the

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.930
shape so you don't look like a duck the
largest most economical source of

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.680
material I found in the house was my car
cover but if you're familiar with my

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.639
other videos you'll know that this is
soaked in cap so I picked up a new one

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:52.739
from the shop now the first thing is to
wash and disinfect our material as a

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.400
note though if you're making masks for
other people unlike what you might see

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.600
in this video the whole process will
have to be hygienic and obviously don't

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.069
make masks for others if you're sick. Now
you're going to want to print out the

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.769
template, I've put this on my website and
I've put a link in the description. I've

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.680
done a lot of experimenting with
different layers and combinations of

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.810
different densities of the nonwoven
polypropylene I had on hand I found it

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.280
was best to use three to four layers of
the car cover which is around 100 GSM

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.480
per layer and then one layer of a
surgical gown which is about

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.000
50 GSM I get that surgical gowns aren't
easily available but they are a similar

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.100
way to disposable painting overalls as a
loose guide based on my research car

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.440
covers are about 100 to 150 grams per
square metre shopping bags are 80 to 100

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.940
gsm disposable painting overalls and
surgical gowns are a bit lighter at

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.220
about 30 to 50 GSM I'm going for a
lighter layer to go against your face

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.000
which is more comfortable but not
totally necessary however it probably

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.440
does provide a better seal against your
face so if you're just making the one

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.730
mask you can use a template to trace it
onto each of the layers and then cut

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.870
them out with scissors I was trying to
work out a way to cut more masks at a

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.250
time to make it more time efficient and
if you remember the hot wire foam cutter

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.870
that I made to cut material for the
cooler during video I set this up to see

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.230
if it would work and it turns out it
doesn't absolutely amazing job at

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.040
cutting this stuff and it's fun
experimenting with how many layers I

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.430
could do it once I pretty much got to
the limit of how many I could stack in a

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.720
pile so if you're looking at cutting
lots of masks or even just want to have

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.240
fun with it
it's definitely worth making one I've

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.920
actually made another video on how to
build one like this it costs about $30

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:45.110
in parts plus an old car battery and
table and about 30 minutes to put

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.060
together additionally to make it easier
to cut more in the future I traced and

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:54.980
then cut out a wood template so I can
run the hot wire along its edge after

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.930
you've cut the basic mask shape use your
template to also mark the elastic holes

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.610
in the top layer now we are going to
weld together all of these filter

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.590
elements around the edge proper n95
masks are made using an ultrasonic

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.030
welder none of us have that obviously so
I managed to work out a technique with

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.290
an iron when done right this has been
official over sewing partly because you

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.310
don't need a sewing machine but also
because sewing introduces perforations

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:26.600
to the material which can leak air also
because when dealing with this many

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.990
filter elements it's important to seal
around the edges thoroughly so air

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.860
travels through every filter element and
doesn't take a shortcut through the

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.990
edges and the seams Plus doing it this
way seals it nice and flat against your

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.470
face without any little bits
cotton stitches messing stuff up having

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:47.130
said that though if you do have trouble
with this next part of the process you

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.390
can sew it and you'll still end up with
a better mask than if you're using woven

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.950
material like cotton I tried so many
techniques to get this to work I almost

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:00.450
gave up a few times I'm not gonna lie
it's not the easiest to learn but once

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:05.760
you nail it it works awesome before
doing it on a mask get pieces of scrap

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.990
material stacked in the same way as he
masks and do a bunch of test runs with

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.490
your iron just before you through that
though this can produce a fair few

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.090
plastic fumes which you probably don't
want to be breathing so do it in a

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.260
well-ventilated space I ended up
whipping up this quick fume extractor

00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:26.610
arm out of a beer carton and old
computer fan and this silver tube that

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:30.090
I've had in storage for years that I've
bought for some reason I can't remember

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:34.530
why but it worked a treat and it turns
out I also accidentally made a

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.070
hovercraft I got a bit distracted
playing with this for a bit with the

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:45.570
kids yeah good times on the hover soccer
field anyway back to the task at hand to

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.050
begin with we're just gonna weld the
outer edge of the mask leaving the front

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:53.430
seam for now which is the V shape to do
this you want to get your iron to about

00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:58.560
180 degrees on the back corner if you
can measure it your iron will probably

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.880
differ from mine but the two I tested
this setting was about maximum heat or

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.190
slightly under with the front of your
mask facing up use the back corner of

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.690
your iron holding it at about a
30-degree angle with the bottom of the

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.800
iron facing the outer edge of the mask
then with a fair bit of downward

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.660
pressure you can slowly advance forward
around the edge of the mask aiming about

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:27.060
five millimeters in from the edge make
sure you do a bunch of test runs until

00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:31.130
you find the right combination of
temperature speed and downward pressure

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:35.849
it's tempting to hold the iron flat but
it simply doesn't work to bond through

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:40.500
all the layers if your iron leaves a
trail that's cut all the way through the

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:46.470
layers the irons too hot or you going
too slow if yours is like mine with your

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.220
bottom layer being a different color
this is actually helpful because you can

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:53.790
see it start to be revealed as you move
the iron around

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:57.270
when you done let the world cool down
for a bit before messing with it

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.590
otherwise it's gonna ruin the joint
don't touch it the best way to see if

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.730
you've been successful with your joint
is that you haven't contracted a virus

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.730
no the best way to see if you've been
successful or not is to hold it up

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:13.230
against a bright light and you should
see a translucent line around the entire

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:18.270
edge then looking on the other side of
your mask you should see a shiny

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:23.250
depression around the inside edge of the
mask you can use your thumb to push the

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:27.750
inner lining around to make sure it's
bonded all the way through if it hasn't

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:32.340
worked you know if it hasn't worked you
can run the iron over it again an

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.090
additional time however you only get a
couple of lives doing this because the

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:40.350
plastic starts to break down with heat
by the third or fourth time even if you

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:44.520
get it to join it will start to get more
brittle and is more likely to fail later

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.600
on now if you've got a really good bond
all the way through to your back layer

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.950
you can use a pair of scissors to trim
the jagged edge of the plastic don't

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:57.180
trim too close to your world line though
leave as much border as possible I've

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.780
had some pretty good luck trimming with
the hot wire as well it doesn't look as

00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.350
good and it can produce some little
sharp bits that need to be trimmed off

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:09.420
but it is a bit of extra backup to stick
all the layers together we can move on

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.500
to doing the nose seal rubber this part
is really important to create a nice

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.990
airtight seal on your face looking at
existing n95 masks they appear to use a

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:23.940
very low density foam rubber which is
about two millimeters thick it looks

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.940
like they use either NBR foam or very
soft

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:32.040
evie a foam they're only NBR foam I had
on hand in a similar density was in the

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:37.830
engine bay of my car and this really
soft exercise mat you have to be careful

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:42.600
though because mats like this are often
higher density a VA foam also which

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:46.860
isn't soft enough to contour to your
skin properly what if you do use though

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:51.300
it has to be closed-cell so it doesn't
let any air leak through as a rough

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.980
guide it should feel as soft as your
skin when pressed overall though if you

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:59.760
find some foam that has an adhesive
backing and as two millimeters thick

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:05.520
you're winning I had to use the NBR foam
exercise mat which has the perfect feel

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:10.170
that has to be sliced into thin
strips which was a pain so depending on

00:11:10.170 --> 00:11:12.930
what you have on hand
you need a strip that's 2 millimeters

00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:17.880
thick by a hundred millimeters long and
about 15 millimeters wide you'll also

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.110
need some double-sided tape to match the
width then stick this onto the back of

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:26.790
your strip of foam as a little
improvement over the n95 mask I've also

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:32.100
cut little 45-degree beveled edges on
each end of the foam strip this allows

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:36.990
it to sit flatter on your face without
little air gaps okay you can now stick

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:42.390
this strip across the top inside of your
mask and press it down firmly with that

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:46.980
complete it's now time to do the front
seam this one is a bit tricky because

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.910
we're using so many filter layers so
this seam will have eight to ten layers

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.290
of material that you'll need to join
together at the time of recording this

00:11:55.290 --> 00:11:59.010
I'm still a bit on the fence about the
best way to do it but I'll give you some

00:11:59.010 --> 00:12:03.720
options okay the first thing I tried was
plastic welding it to allow it to be

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.710
done without the use of a sewing machine
to do this it's similar to doing the

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:11.940
outside edge world except this time as
soon as you've run the iron all the way

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:15.870
to the top you need to flip the mask
over and then do the same thing to the

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.830
other side my main concern with this
option is the join might be a bit

00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:23.460
brittle from the additional heat and
fail later on or there could be some

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.089
little hidden pinholes in the world of
the same after you've done this if you

00:12:27.089 --> 00:12:30.510
hold it up to the light you should
probably expect to see some transparency

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.410
still where the plastic is pressed thin
however you need to look out for the

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.970
brighter more obvious holes to make this
joint safer I'd say the best thing to do

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.360
would be to run a bead of hot glue up
the middle of the mask to make sure

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.740
there's no holes and to give it a bit of
extra strength your second option is

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:51.870
sewing trying this are really not
confident in the seams ability to stop

00:12:51.870 --> 00:12:56.580
air sneaking in through the edge of the
layers if you do so you're probably

00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.570
better off doing a double stitch if you
have time and play around with the

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:04.470
stitch tension to get it right then the
third option which is currently my

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:08.580
favorite because I feel like it's the
safest so far this is doing a double

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.870
stitch down the front and then using the
iron to melt the plastic along the front

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:16.440
edge to seal it up
I've also since found if you wear gloves

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:19.680
you can pinch along the front of the
scene while the plastic still hot to get

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.850
a nice good seal
we can now move on to the elastic straps

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:29.710
similar to the n95 masks we're going to
use braided six millimeter elastic if

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:34.780
you're having trouble finding an elastic
you can use wider braids and I found

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:39.340
that you can actually split it down the
middle and it doesn't fray later on for

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.900
this template for an adult size you're
going to need to cut two lengths of 28

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.310
centimeters of elastic to attach them
I'll show you the best way to do it

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.600
first which uses a soldering iron but if
you don't have one there are

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:57.370
alternatives I'll show you after this
method is the closest to how some n95

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.990
masks are done which is nice and strong
with your soldering iron you'll find

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:06.130
that most have a removable tip loosen
the grub screw on the side and it should

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:11.500
fall out or you may have to thread it
out then you'll want to find a bolt that

00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.250
fits in the hole in the end it doesn't
matter what type as long as you can get

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.540
it to stay in there and that the head of
the bolt isn't wider than your elastic

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:24.520
before I've tightened it up I've also
put it in the vise and I filed a head of

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.740
the bolt flat now like your plastic
welding earlier this is just a case of

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.760
working at the right combination of heat
time and pressure so you'll want to

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.950
practice on some scrap first with your
soldering iron at temperature put the

00:14:38.950 --> 00:14:43.180
end of your elastic in position and then
simply press down the head of the bolt

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:48.250
onto the elastic with mine the
temperature can be adjusted and I found

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:52.630
that when it was set to 300 degrees it
was exactly 10 seconds for a good joint

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:56.110
but this will likely vary for you
depending on what soldering iron you

00:14:56.110 --> 00:15:00.760
have and even things like the bolt
length can have an effect when you've

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:03.220
done it to know whether you've been
successful or not

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:07.360
look at the braid in the elastic which
is the areas between the rubber strands

00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:11.440
and you should see it become translucent
showing the color of your mask

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.120
underneath plus when you flip your mask
over you should have a shiny depression

00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:20.710
where you attached it after you attach
it don't move the elastic around until

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:25.300
it cools down otherwise you'll ruin the
join don't touch it this method is great

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.990
because it buttons through all the
layers for strength if it doesn't join

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.040
I've also found that you can have a
second and third attempt without ruining

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.910
it just don't let the tip of the
soldering iron touch your mask material

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:41.050
directly because this has a much lower
melting point and will create a hole

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:47.070
pretty quickly okay now for option
number two you can simply use hot glue

00:15:47.070 --> 00:15:52.839
it works okay but it doesn't stick to
the elastic as well as the world holds

00:15:52.839 --> 00:15:58.360
it plus it only bonds to the top layer
of your mask so it's probably not going

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:05.680
to last as long then the third option is
using a stapler to do this for strength

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.610
leave the elastic in from the opposite
direction to where it we pulled from

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:13.990
then put your staple through I'm not a
big fan because I think it could

00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:20.080
introduce air leaks also like one of my
shop bought n95 masks it seems to fail a

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.170
lot and need to be reattached however
the benefits of stapling it it allows

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:31.959
you to use rubber bands if he can't
sauce braid it elastic there is one more

00:16:31.959 --> 00:16:36.670
option as done on some n95 masks and
we've allowed for this in a template

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:41.470
this involves folding the edge of the
mask over and onto itself are then

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:46.390
tacking it in place with hot glue then
you can simply run the elastic through

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:51.310
the loops that you've created doing it
in this way can also allow the elastic

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:56.740
to be more easily adjusted or replaced
now we can do the last part of the

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:02.440
process which is the nose adjustment
wire wire or any kind of metal strip can

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:07.150
be difficult to integrate into a mask
without the use of a hem so hunting

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:11.140
around the shed trying to think of ways
to replicate existing n95 and those

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:15.819
adjustments the idea jumped out at me to
use flat electrical cable like you'd

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:20.410
find in the roof of your house and it
works a treat cables like this have

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:25.360
fairly solid wire coarse bending easily
and then holding their shape flat

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.080
electrical cable like this is a couple
of dollars per meter at hardware stores

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:34.240
then with some rough sandpaper give one
side of the cable a bit of a sand to

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.800
roughing it up this will make the glue
stick much better cut it into pieces

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.860
about nine centimetres long each give it
a good clean so it doesn't look dodgy

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:48.840
then if you want to be fancy you can pre
bend it into shape which can reveal

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:54.210
some of the rough strands of wire in the
end which he can then sand or file now

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.710
with the hot glue gun run a bead of glue
along the rough side of the cable then

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.730
stick it across the noise section of
your mask when you do it though try not

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:06.299
to put the middle of the wire too close
to the edge of the mask because this

00:18:06.299 --> 00:18:10.980
could interfere with wearing safety
glasses if that is a factor make sure

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:14.520
you hold it in place while it cools down
once it's set

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:19.950
you can then pre bend it into a slight
bell shape with that attached just have

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:24.179
a quick look over the mask checking for
any flaws then depending on how it's

00:18:24.179 --> 00:18:27.570
going to be used
you should disinfect it I also found it

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:31.740
handy to throw the masks in the dryer
with the heat turned completely off for

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.580
about 15 minutes
this helps aerate the masks of any

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:39.840
plastic he smells and also removes any
loose material that it may have picked

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.340
up while making it after this remove
them from the dry with gloves you can

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:49.620
then put them into individual snap lock
bags to keep them clean overall I'm

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:54.140
pretty happy with how these masks turned
out as far as the mask performance goes

00:18:54.140 --> 00:18:58.289
yes I understand that you have to be
clean-shaven but we found that the

00:18:58.289 --> 00:19:02.309
fitment and feel was exactly the same as
a flat fold with no leaks around the

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:06.809
edges it works perfectly for dust around
the shed otherwise as far as filtration

00:19:06.809 --> 00:19:10.830
goes unfortunately don't have the
equipment to test it properly but we did

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:15.510
unscientifically try it out with a few
different aerosols equally both the flat

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:19.679
fold n95 and homemade mask noticeably
filtered out a good amount of the

00:19:19.679 --> 00:19:23.580
products leaving just a gaseous smell
and then you wake up in your neighbor's

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.529
garden two days later spooning a beach
ball what was interesting though is it

00:19:28.529 --> 00:19:32.549
actually outperformed the rigid n95 mask
that I had because it turns out the

00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:36.630
fitment just wasn't as good this mask
doesn't have the nose wire and appears

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:41.429
to rely on additional foam which I guess
isn't the best choice but that brings me

00:19:41.429 --> 00:19:45.720
to the most important point there's no
point wearing an n95 or Petrie mask

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.490
unless you fit it and handle it properly
make sure there's no air gaps around the

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.960
edges and always remember once you're
wearing it you have to treat the front

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:59.460
of your mask like your sole never touch
it especially in public if you do

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:02.230
accidentally touch it
wash your hands immediately with soap

00:20:02.230 --> 00:20:06.159
and water without touching anything else
prior and don't let strangers stick

00:20:06.159 --> 00:20:09.309
their nose in it I hope everyone is safe
and doing well

00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:13.149
Chris and I are doing okay we're
currently self isolating and doing the

00:20:13.149 --> 00:20:16.570
homeschooling thing with the kids like
many people though who basically

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:21.249
unemployed now with all our schedule
work for the year getting cancelled but

00:20:21.249 --> 00:20:25.059
I guess the good news is we now have
more time to YouTube videos you know

00:20:25.059 --> 00:20:27.940
we'll see what happens we'll see what
happens thank you for supporting this
