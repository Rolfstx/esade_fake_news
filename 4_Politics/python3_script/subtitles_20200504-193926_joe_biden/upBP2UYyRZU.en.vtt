00:49:24.459 --> 00:49:24.469 align:start position:0%
I really do think it is a outright lie
 

00:49:24.469 --> 00:49:27.579 align:start position:0%
I really do think it is a outright lie
and<00:49:25.009><c> the</c><00:49:25.759><c> problem</c><00:49:26.179><c> is</c><00:49:26.359><c> too</c><00:49:26.569><c> now</c><00:49:26.749><c> that</c><00:49:26.779><c> all</c><00:49:27.289><c> of</c>

00:49:27.579 --> 00:49:27.589 align:start position:0%
and the problem is too now that all of
 

00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:29.469 align:start position:0%
and the problem is too now that all of
history<00:49:27.739><c> has</c><00:49:28.039><c> been</c><00:49:28.189><c> sort</c><00:49:28.429><c> of</c><00:49:28.489><c> rewritten</c><00:49:29.149><c> and</c>

00:49:29.469 --> 00:49:29.479 align:start position:0%
history has been sort of rewritten and
 

00:49:29.479 --> 00:49:31.509 align:start position:0%
history has been sort of rewritten and
so<00:49:29.569><c> it's</c><00:49:29.719><c> actually</c><00:49:29.929><c> very</c><00:49:30.139><c> difficult</c><00:49:30.469><c> to</c><00:49:31.099><c> find</c>
