00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.860
 - I want to tell you about the universe. 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.400
 What is it, and how it came to be, 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.600
 What are her building blocks. 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.400
 I want to tell you how the future creates the past, 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.820
 And then it creates the future. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.180
 But first, I want to tell you about crystals. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.640
 You may be surprised to know that crystal 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.280
 Not an expensive piece of glass 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.060
 Or a chandelier in some luxurious dining room. 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.660
 The word crystal simply means a non-periodic pattern. 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.100
 Look at this chess pattern. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.700
 See how it is still spreading 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
 Unlimited in every direction? 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.440
 This means it's the league pattern. 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.940
 So this is two-dimensional crystal. 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.300
 This is another two-dimensional crystal. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.140
 This is something else. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.300
 You can also have three-dimensional crystals. 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.520
 By the way, this 3D glass called crystal's 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.940
 Its atoms are actually arranged in a crystalline pattern. 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.720
 So, see how I'm projecting this three-dimensional crystal 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.800
 To a two-dimensional image on the sand? 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.500
 See how that 2D projection looks distorted 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.960
 Because of the angle of projection? 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.280
 That 2D image also has a pattern 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.440
 But it is not periodic so it's not crystal. 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.160
 But there is a deep connection between the 2D object 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.600
 On sand and mother crystal 3D. 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.120
 This distorted 2D style is called semi-crystallization. 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.900
 And semi-crystallization in a certain way the dimension, in this case, 2D, 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.534
 Is the drop of the crystal at the top of the dimension, 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.160
 In this case, 3D. 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560
 A group of physicists working in Los Angeles 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.240
 On the theory of new physics where a given 8D crystal, 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.440
 Yes, that's right, for an eight-dimensional crystal, 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.300
 Expect a 4D at a very special angle 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.760
 Which forms a 4D semi-crystal, and from a 4D semi-crystal, 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.440
 They derive semi-crystallization of 3D, which they believe 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.760
 Infrastructure is fundamental to all of reality. 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.740
 This semi-crystalline 3D has a basic building block, 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.540
 Tetrahedron, which is not three-dimensional 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.539
 Equilateral triangle. 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.000
 The size of each end on this shape is smaller 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.360
 Possible length can be found. 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.760
 This is called the Planck length. 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.940
 It's 10 to 35 times smaller than a meter. 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.560
 So you know how the TV screen is broken down 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.720
 Into pixel building blocks called? 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.680
 Pixel is the smallest possible integral unit 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.200
 From the 2D screen, so I think for reality as the TV screen 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.680
 But in 3D, think of tetrahedron as 3D pixels, 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.980
 The smallest possible integral unit of reality. 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.880
 And tetrahedron in a semi-crystal unites with the other 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.960
 Tetrahedron using compound mathematical rules 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.380
 To fill all the space in the universe. 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.580
 Each tetrahedron only has a few specific states 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.740
 Who can be found at any moment. 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:33.660
 Because of the rules of how these pixels connect 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.260
 To each other, and if one tetrahedron is in a certain condition, 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.360
 This dictates many other countries 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.800
 Tetrahedron in both space. 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.600
 But here is a strange thing. 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.080
 If a certain tetrahedron can be in either one 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.740
 From just a few possible states at a given moment, 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.920
 Who or what country to choose 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.060
 Should you be at any point? 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.140
 Well, for such a choice to be, 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.000
 We need scientifically, mathematically, and logically 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.680
 Bring a new element in physics. 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.080
 And this component is consciousness. 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.520
 If you are not a scientist, you may be surprised 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.797
 To know that no one really knows 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.960
 The exact value of the speed of light. 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.980
 We have an approximate concept, but not exactly valuable. 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.340
 The closest we can get to measure it 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.020
 It has nothing to do with the accuracy of our machines, 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.860
 But no matter how accurate our machines get, 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.495
 We will not be able to measure the exact speed of light 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.980
 Without theory that tells us what it is and why it is, 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.600
 And current trends in physics theories do not. 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.600
 - [Woman] Oh look, Professor Einstein, you look so cute! 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.080
 - [Einstein] Do I look pretty here? 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.080
 - Yes Yes. - No waiting, 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.660
 This is my bad side, what if I go? 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:55.200
 - Yes, so good. - What if you stick to it 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.860
 My tongue is like this? 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.080
 - good! - Oh oh. 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.880
 We have the best theories of physics, Einstein's theory of relativity 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.276
 Quantum mechanics is both used 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.180
 The speed of light as a starting point. 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.740
 In other words, they are used to an accurate measurement 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.980
 From the speed of light without explaining why it is, 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.360
 What is it, or why does the universe even have 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.500
 The speed limit in the first place. 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.860
 We need a new theory. 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.880
 This theory is what physicists and mathematicians 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.620
 Quantum gravity research in Los Angeles is working on it. 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.840
 They call it the theory of evolution and it will be, 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.620
 Really for the first time ever, 

00:05:36.625 --> 00:05:39.924
 Provide an explanation for the speed of light 

00:05:39.924 --> 00:05:42.480
 And other constants, such as Planck's constant 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.180
 The content of the structure is fine. 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.480
 Basically what is needed is the theory of everything, 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.660
 Theory that explains too 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.120
 The basic aspects of reality. 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.253
 String theory, which once held much promise 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:57.560
 The theory of everything may be successful, 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.780
 He has no successful predictions regardless 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.560
 From predictions, the theory itself is not actually a theory 

00:06:02.564 --> 00:06:05.459
 Of all things, it's just not, because it cannot be explained 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.280
 The speed of light or other constants. 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.220
 Quantum mechanics and general relativity, on the other hand, 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:14.520
 It does not make good predictions, but it does not explain 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.400
 The basic constants either. 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.776
 - [Man] Professor Einstein, why is the speed of light 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.100
 Our exact value that he does? 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:28.420
 - [Einstein] Well, to put it downright, well, and security! 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.800
 - So what clues does nature provide for us 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.800
 Why does the theory of everything look like? 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.420
 We have identified seven. 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:46.060
 Info, causal episodes, non determinists, 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:54.600
 Consciousness, pixelization, E8 crystal, and golden ratio. 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.159
 A growing number of physicists say 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.960
 The information is done. 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.540
 What does that even mean? 

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:12.500
 Well, the information makes sense in symbolic form. 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.000
 Language or symbol provide this type 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.920
 Symbolic transfer information. 

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.738
 A very different type of code 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.240
 He is the one who represents himself. 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:28.840
 Geometric symbols can do that. 

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:34.540
 A cube can represent love, if we say do it, or it can 

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.960
 It represents, in fact, with minimal objectivity, per se. 

00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:44.592
 Could there be a language or code making from engineering? 

00:07:44.592 --> 00:07:48.759
 What kind of information does this language express? 

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.100
 Quantum physics and classical physics 

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.500
 It indicates that the reality is made of information 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.900
 There is no evidence to monitor this fact 

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.240
 Than anything else from information. 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.100
 Many physicists agree, and many do not. 

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:04.340
 But those that do not agree that reality will take place 

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:08.280
 The information have no explanation for what reality. 

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.020
 If not information. Gentlemen? 

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:15.740
 - [Man] is made the reality of the information. 

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.720
 - [Man] No. 

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.520
 - [Man] Yes, the information is done. 

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.692
 - No. - Okay, so what is it 

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.900
 Made of, if not information? 

00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:25.780
 - energy. Energy is information! 

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.640
 - This is stupidity. Energy is ability 

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.120
 For particles to change their position. 

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.540
 Information capabilities, energy is information! 

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.720
 - Both. - It's information! 

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.520
 - mm, mm. - What is it then? 

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.740
 - No information available. - What is it then? 

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.840
 - [Man] No information available! 

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.640
 The truth is engineering. 

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.480
 An engineering language in a form of engineering symbolism, 

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:05.580
 Kind of symbols that represent themselves, 

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.240
 It may explain how engineering reality 

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.900
 It can be made of pure information. 

00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:18.320
 Information means meaning, but what is meaning? 

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.120
 The meaning is by comparison, this is what we do, 

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.840
 But we do it quickly, and we don't realize we do it, 

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.920
 We are looking at something and we are identical to something 

00:09:25.922 --> 00:09:28.382
 From our database, we are example, this is a passage, 

00:09:28.382 --> 00:09:30.967
 This is a building, not a pass, this is the window, 

00:09:30.967 --> 00:09:34.533
 Not constructive, so meaning conceive of something 

00:09:34.533 --> 00:09:37.156
 Relative to something else, that is to say 

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.000
 It is subjective and requires selection. 

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.020
 Can we get some dramatic music here? 

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.940
 (Exciting music) 

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.060
 Because the meaning is personal, in order that even exist, 

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:53.671
 It needs to be seen or measured 

00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.180
 Some form of awareness. 

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.251
 Einstein showed how the past and the future 

00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:06.020
 It is found simultaneously in one geometric object. 

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.580
 So all the time is there all the time. 

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.340
 Let me say it again, all the time is there all the time. 

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.600
 I know that the kind voices are strange and unintuitive 

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.160
 But we have to kind of suspend our common sense 

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.460
 Which mathematically reviewed, according to the best 

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.580
 Our physics formulas, this reality makes sense. 

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:35.440
 So, let's visualize an engineering object 

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:38.740
 Einstein would have talked about as a block. 

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.880
 Remember the tetrahedron, the bedrock 

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.860
 Indeed pixels I told you about? 

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.580
 Now imagine the entire universe, everything, 

00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:51.800
 Everywhere, in one frozen moment in time. 

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.440
 Like one frame in a movie, in this one frame, 

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.000
 All of the reality appears everywhere 

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.280
 Frozen in this one position. 

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:06.140
 Let me give you the analogy. 

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.360
 In the movie shooting 35 mm film, 

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.300
 There are 24 frames per second. 

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.300
 There is no actual movement in the movie, 

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.760
 There is just a series of frozen frames. 

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.438
 Now remember how I told you about the length of Planck 

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.980
 From space, which is the smallest possible length? 

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.000
 Well there is also Planck's length of time 

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.120
 And it is much shorter than 24 frames per second. 

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:30.980
 In fact, it's 10 to 44 times shorter than a second. 

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:33.900
 Okay, so our Frozen Framework actually returns. 

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:38.140
 The whole universe in one frozen moment, one frame, 

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.260
 But instead of a frame in the movie, 

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.740
 It's the framework in all of reality. 

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.837
 Now, imagine the next frame. 

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.220
 Each tire is different from the previous one, 

00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:51.400
 Just like in the movie. 

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.879
 See how all frames are found in Einstein 

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:00.880
 Space-time every time? 

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:03.260
 Well, now here is where things get really really strange. 

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.120
 We assume that the past affects the future. 

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.620
 This is how it appears to experience reality. 

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.260
 But when we look at this block, 

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:14.160
 So why is one side in the past and one side in the future? 

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:17.440
 Why do you go from left to right and not from right to left? 

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.360
 Why can't the future affect the past? 

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.120
 Take away the past and future names 

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.180
 If this helps you think about this concept. 

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:27.400
 So whether past, future, and future influences 

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.600
 Does the past affect endless loop reactions? 

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:37.120
 So the question is, which part of the past? 

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.100
 Is to influence any part of the future, and vice versa, 

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.660
 The answer is everything time affects all time 

00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:50.620
 Every time. - Oy VEY, I need a drink. 

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.960
 - Is this even possible? 

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.120
 My 20 years from now can affect me now 

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.780
 Just as you sway her? 

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:18.460
 So my five minutes from now can influence me 10 minutes ago, 

00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.560
 As me 10 minutes ago affects me as a baby, 

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.100
 As for me as a baby that affects me on his deathbed? 

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:33.340
 This is very strange to understand that. 

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.600
 But all we know and say this is the way it is. 

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.260
 Am I stoned? 

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.240
 Okay, so if every moment co-created every other moment, 

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.580
 Both forward and backward at the time, then the reality will be 

00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:52.500
 This massive neural network covers space and time. 

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.280
 This type of network would have one even way strange 

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:58.980
 Quality than anything we've talked about yet, 

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.560
 It will be his own creator. 

00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.180
 But the fact is that all the time is there all the time 

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:07.560
 Not to say that the future is written in stone 

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:11.411
 And we're kind of an animation coder or something. 

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.860
 (Cheerful music) 

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.420
 That's what they thought, though. 

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.220
 Years ago, it was popular to believe 

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:18.660
 In the problem, to some extent, the idea from the reality of existence 

00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.660
 The inevitability of the game itself. 

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.320
 The famous double fissure eliminated the experience of determinism. 

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.656
 Search for him if you've never heard of it, it's wild 

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:34.620
 It is one of the fundamental pillars of modern physics. 

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.880
 But for now, take my word for it, it ruled out the imperative 

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.980
 And ushered in a new age of inevitability, 

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.520
 Or basically, free will. 

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.100
 So how do you feel free to work? 

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.060
 One of the most surprising discoveries of quantum physics 

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:52.140
 Is that only reality exists upon observation, 

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.700
 So literally particles don't exist 

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.080
 Even it is observed. 

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.120
 Famous physicist John Wheeler, he's the man who came 

00:15:03.127 --> 00:15:05.306
 With a black hole run, he says reality 

00:15:05.306 --> 00:15:12.200
 Made of information, which is created by the note. 

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.160
 It should be monitored, he says, 

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.540
 From a conscious thing. 

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.840
 Nobel Prize winner Frank WILCZEK said 

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.560
 That quantum theory is controversial and vague, 

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.560
 And he will stay that way until someone builds, 

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.260
 Within the formalism of quantum mechanics, observer, 

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.700
 Entity model in which the states correspond 

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:36.400
 To a caricature of recognition from conscious awareness. 

00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:42.880
 Entity, observer, so Frank Wilkesk is basically 

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.060
 We talk about an entity, not necessarily a human being 

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:48.720
 Or an animal that is capable of generating 

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:51.980
 Information through observation and measurement. 

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:55.440
 But what could this entity be conscious? 

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.300
 Well we definitely know this awareness exists 

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.560
 In the universe, I mean, in the least in us humans, right? 

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:04.580
 I mean, I'm conscious, I was conscious, and he's conscious, 

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:07.120
 Think. - I know! 

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.220
 (acclaim) 

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.620
 Awareness is related to the depth of physics 

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.173
 In ways that are not yet fully understood. 

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:23.340
 In fact, awareness is kind of like one of the least 

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:26.280
 Understand things in all sciences. 

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.420
 Nobody knows exactly what it is. 

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.560
 Strange, right? 

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.500
 Even if the reality is pure information, if everything, 

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.220
 Energy, matter, and thought, if it's all information, 

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.440
 Then it becomes clear this reality of deep relations 

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.240
 In his consciousness in some way, as if it were essential 

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.760
 Reality stuff is somehow consciousness. 

00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:52.460
 Does awareness and information appear in one way or another? 

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:55.140
 In a causal treadmill? 

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:59.537
 German physicist Werner developed Heisenberg I 

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.760
 Equations of Quantum Mechanics using 

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.560
 A type of mathematics is called matrix theory. 

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.280
 He deduced that space was time dotted 

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.860
 To segmentation three-dimensional units of Planck length 

00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:12.680
 Just like two-dimensional pixels 

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.960
 On your computer screen. - Good to be made of pixels. 

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.520
 Mathematics indicated this. - Maths! 

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.060
 I like Mathematics! 

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.780
 - Your pizza, professor! - And pizza, 

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.760
 Oh, I love pizza, especially the pizza spot. 

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.760
 - [Marion] Interestingly, there was no solid 

00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.960
 Empirical evidence for a smooth manner, 

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.120
 In other words, no spotted, spacetime. 

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.360
 - Werner mm and pizza. 

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.240
 (Crowd screaming) We're not spotted !!! 

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:43.716
 - [Einstein] We're not pixelated! 

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.240
 - Yes, you, morons. - Your mother is pixelated! 

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:53.380
 Smooth space. - There is no evidence for this, 

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.280
 Show math is polka dots, 

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.900
 So it must be pixelated. - Well this is interesting, 

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.340
 Bullshit. - It must be pixelated! 

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.800
 - [Einstein] bullshit, bullshit, bullshit, bullshit! 

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.155
 - [Marion] On the other hand, on the one hand, most scholars agree 

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.780
 That the length could be no shorter than the length of Planck, 

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.940
 Which indicates an unbroken reality. 

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.420
 - [Einstein] There is no shorter length 

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.360
 From the length of Planck. - This means reality 

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.620
 Unbreakable. - I'm not polka dots, 

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.680
 I'm not! - My friend, 

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:30.820
 You are kind of being a little bit like one of these people 

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.160
 Those who deny the development because they can not cope with 

00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:36.340
 Really their ancestors were monkeys. 

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:41.180
 Are you a monkey, huh, are you a little monkey? 

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:43.320
 We believe even quantum gravity theory 

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.920
 Whoever discovered the spacetime, 

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.860
 The issue will remain confusing everyone. 

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.300
 What kind of engineering code would I describe? 

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:56.100
 Reality Polka Dots? 

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.700
 80 years of breaking apart particles into particles 

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.440
 Accelerators like the famous Large Hadron Collider 

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:07.120
 In Geneva he gave us a strange idea, 

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.757
 That all basic particles and forces 

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.140
 Convert to another one, as it literally transforms 

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:15.798
 From one to the other according to the process 

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.880
 Measurement called transformation symmetry, 

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:21.000
 And all of these conversions correspond to a shape, 

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.800
 And not just any shape, an eight-dimensional shape. 

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.460
 Now this shape forms the crystal. 

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.820
 Now remember crystals are periodic patterns 

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:32.200
 Of a certain shape, such as that of chess 

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.095
 It is a 2D crystal made of boxes, 

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:39.580
 So this is crystal for a special eight-dimensional shape 

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:43.420
 This is a crystal known as the E8 lattice. 

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.500
 (Jazz) 

00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:53.400
 To generate that quasi-3D crystal, 

00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:56.800
 And the end of the fabric is dotted with reality. 

00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.560
 We highlight this crystal 8D to 4D. 

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.100
 Then we convert this to 3D. 

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.880
 Now, just like the basic cell form a 3D cubic lattice 

00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.380
 It is a cubic, cellular E8 lattice shape 

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.500
 It is 8D format with 240 vertices. 

00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:20.620
 We call it a multi-station gosset. 

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:24.880
 When a multi-station gosset is expected to 4D, 

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.960
 It becomes two identical shapes of various sizes. 

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:34.660
 The proportion of their sizes is a unique number, 0.618, 

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.520
 Also known as the golden ratio. 

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.820
 (Explosion) 

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:47.380
 The golden ratio may be the primary constant of nature. 

00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:50.460
 It is a ratio that is essential to restricted 

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:53.140
 Equilateral triangles and it is strange everywhere 

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:55.140
 In the universe, which appears everywhere 

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.100
 From quantum to celestial scales. 

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.080
 Interestingly, it ever appears in black holes. 

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:05.340
 - [Einstein] I don't want to fly in a black hole! 

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.240
 I never wish your theory existed! 

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.600
 (Belching) 

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.560
 - Well, let's get serious for a second. 

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.200
 Here are three quick facts for you science chiefs. 

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.320
 The golden ratio is the accurate point where the black hole is in 

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:27.240
 Adjust the specific temperature changes from positive to negative 

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.120
 And it is part of the equation 

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.400
 The lowest in the universe is a black hole. 

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.820
 The golden ratio is even related to the severity of the quantum ring 

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:38.020
 Parameter to the universe is a black hole. 

00:21:38.022 --> 00:21:40.279
 Why does this support the claim that the golden ratio 

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.480
 Is it an essential constant in nature? 

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.880
 Because the theory of everything must unite 

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:48.760
 General relativity with quantum mechanics and a black hole 

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:52.140
 Where these two theories converge on their limits. 

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.580
 Okay, so he bears with me through some really strange math 

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.320
 Now I will reward you with some amazing clips 

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.480
 John Malkovich getting a pie in the face. 

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.160
 There is a type of mathematics called mathematics matrix. 

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.840
 No, not this type of matrix. 

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.560
 (Upbeat music) 

00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:16.900
 Mathematics matrix is ​​a type of mathematics 

00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.740
 This uses quantum physics in its formulas. 

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:21.280
 Without getting the technology either, 

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.380
 This is an example of a matrix. 

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.560
 A matrix is ​​just a set of numbers 

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.620
 That are arranged in columns in rows. 

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:29.720
 There are some amount of combinations 

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.200
 For these numbers inside the array, 

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.740
 Like if a matrix has four numbers inside it, 

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.540
 There are 24 different possible combinations 

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:39.340
 For these four numbers. 

00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.540
 Quantum mechanics uses binary matrices, 

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.300
 It even contains only different combinations of two numbers. 

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.220
 Each of these combinations numbers has a value. 

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.360
 It's called on the intrinsic value. 

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:54.020
 He called some trivial subjective values. 

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:57.220
 These are values ​​like one, two, and zero. 

00:22:57.220 --> 00:22:59.300
 Some are called non-trivial, 

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.760
 And those are all sorts of more aggregate look numbers, 

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.640
 So here is the interesting part. 

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.240
 Where is this interesting part? 

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:11.360
 Oh yeah, here is the highest non-trivial possibility 

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:14.860
 The intrinsic values ​​that appear in binary matrices are, 

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.780
 Ready for that? 

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:21.180
 The golden ratio and minus one over the golden ratio. 

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.340
 So we now see a deep relationship between black holes 

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.620
 And quantum mechanics because the golden ratio 

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:29.591
 It looks deep in both black hole physics 

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:31.680
 And in quantum mechanics. 

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:40.331
 Well, a good job bearing with me, so here is your reward. 

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.460
 John Malkovich getting a pie in the face. 

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.760
 - No, I will not, no no, but ... I am not John Malkovich. 

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:47.000
 - Pie! 

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.140
 The golden ratio shows its amazing accuracy 

00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:52.220
 In many other ways throughout the universe 

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.920
 In large and small scales. 

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.740
 It is also pervasive 

00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:58.460
 Simply can not be considered like coincidence. 

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:00.340
 In the past, the appearance of this ratio 

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.880
 It is usually ignored by scientists 

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.740
 Because they have no way to explain it, so they have an interest in that 

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.612
 The stuff was considered by amateur scientists. 

00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:10.940
 But now, for the first time, quantum gravity is strict 

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:13.858
 The theory you expect is being developed 

00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:18.020
 The golden ratio exists in literally everywhere. 

00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.560
 So what would everything theory look like 

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:26.020
 To answer those seven clues we just presented? 

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.780
 Info, causal episodes, non determinists, 

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:37.920
 Consciousness, pixelization, E8 crystal, and golden ratio. 

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.740
 (KLEE) So we think reality is like a mosaic code or language 

00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:46.200
 In the smallest size possible reality 

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.520
 It is called the Planck length. 

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:52.000
 The particle accelerator data tells us that all particles 

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.180
 The forces are related to another one according to 

00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.720
 Top dimensional crystal called E8 lattice. 

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:06.020
 But reality seems to be 3D, so we highlight the slide 

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:09.600
 This E8 crystal right down to 3D, 

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.160
 That produces semi-crystallization code or language 

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.620
 These allow engineering symbols to build 

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.140
 To the ordinary world of molecules 

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.200
 And the forces that we see around us. 

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:26.280
 Now this engineering language has rules 

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.860
 But grammarians also have freedom like any language 

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:33.440
 This requires some idea of ​​the chosen one 

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.420
 To choose free steps in the language. 

00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:40.380
 Now, the random idea is not working very well 

00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.240
 When it comes to symbols, the meaning begins to break down. 

00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:47.600
 Besides, there is no decent empirical evidence 

00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:51.580
 To randomness in nature in the first place. 

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.880
 A global collective consciousness is one answer, 

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.700
 But this seems a new and religious era. 

00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.711
 At present, there are quite a number of physicists 

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:07.700
 Discuss the idea that we actually have the entire universe 

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.960
 Code-based simulation in some powerful mythical 

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.220
 A quantum computer in another world. 

00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.580
 Now, if this is true, then with the same logic, 

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.640
 That the other universe, where the computer is running 

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.600
 The simulation of the universe is also going to be assumed 

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.520
 The simulation is in another world, 

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:32.040
 So the idea is a little shaky but it's being discussed 

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:34.780
 Seriously by many people credible. 

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.960
 But collective turns out to be universal 

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:42.940
 Consciousness of a kind may be physically inevitable. 

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.100
 Now we do not need to anthropomorphize this idea 

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.560
 Or make it religious or spiritual. 

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.837
 To follow up on the cause, let's start with the idea 

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:55.480
 From the collective behavior of cells in the body, 

00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.520
 Every single sized germ lives its life. 

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.620
 A long time ago, only this type of mobile cell phone 

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.160
 I found a form of life here on Earth. 

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.940
 These few men were not very smart, but they did not choose 

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:11.380
 What is the direction to swim and can chase nutrients, 

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:14.240
 Production and operation are dangerous. 

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.460
 They made choices with their systems very simple 

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.560
 Environmental awareness and the desire to survive. 

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:24.100
 Then they organized themselves into colonies that were more intelligent 

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.380
 As a group, it was more environmental 

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:29.120
 Awareness of individuals. 

00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.980
 Ultimately, animals like humans appeared. 

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:37.020
 Sophisticated forms of awareness and awareness 

00:27:37.020 --> 00:27:41.300
 Now floating on the perimeter of 37 trillion living cells, 

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.920
 As a self-organizing human. 

00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:46.278
 It is precisely for the laws of physics 

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.420
 The electrons that result from it and quarks in self-determination are regulation 

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.020
 In 81 atoms are stable and from there, 

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:57.580
 In human consciousness, physics places are not the upper limit 

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:59.999
 An amount of energy and materials 

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.840
 It can self-organize into conscious systems. 

00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:09.060
 - Physics allows the possibility of all energy 

00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:11.160
 In the universe to eventually transform 

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.760
 In one conscious system this is itself a network 

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.740
 Other conscious systems are huge, 

00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:22.880
 Technologically based, collective awareness. 

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.440
 Given enough time, anything can happen 

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.500
 It will eventually happen. 

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.720
 Through this axiom, this system is universal consciousness 

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.600
 It has already appeared somewhere in frames 

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.440
 Spacetime is in front of us. 

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.720
 Because it is possible, it is inevitable. 

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.860
 Indeed, according to evidence of causal reaction 

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:43.440
 The Hour of Rings, the inevitable future is co-created for us 

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.080
 For the time being, we are also involved in creating this problem. 

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.440
 When humanity discovers the theory of everything, 

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.420
 It will usher in a new era of prosperity. 

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.000
 For example ,, leading cheap, clean, energy 

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.640
 To permanently eradicate poverty. 

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.180
 As a result, gravitational non-profit research 

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.580
 Rely on crowdfunding to support our scientific progress. 

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.260
 Even a $ 5 donation is beneficial 

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.140
 This mission is moving forward. 

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:13.740
