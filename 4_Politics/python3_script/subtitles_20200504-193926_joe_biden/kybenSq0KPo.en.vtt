00:00:05.962 --> 00:00:08.783
It starts all the way back
at the beginning of the universe

00:00:08.783 --> 00:00:11.983
14 billion years ago, with the Big Bang
and formation of everything

00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:14.031
when everything was just
hydrogen and helium

00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:15.481
and a little some other stuff.

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:17.240
But stars and galaxies began to form,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.700
and they were like factories
for creating new elements.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.941
Really big stars formed
and they exploded as supernovae,

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.520
and this seeded the universe
with everything heavier than iron

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.161
that was born in these final moments
of a supernova explosion.

00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:35.233
Now two of the things
that were created in the supernova

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.904
are what I want to talk about today:
thorium and uranium.

00:00:37.904 --> 00:00:40.246
These were different
because they were radioactive

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:43.179
and they kept some of that energy
from the supernova explosion

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:46.265
stored in their very nuclear structure.

00:00:46.265 --> 00:00:48.624
And these materials
along with all the others

00:00:48.624 --> 00:00:52.564
came together to form our solar system
and our planet billions of years ago,

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:54.895
and some of this thorium
and uranium, then,

00:00:54.895 --> 00:00:57.874
was incorporated into our planet,

00:00:57.874 --> 00:01:00.693
sinking to the center of the world
and heating our planet,

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:04.685
generating this energy
that generates the Earth's magnetic field.

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:06.656
And it drives plate tectonics,

00:01:06.656 --> 00:01:10.764
and it has spread apart oceans
and pushed up mountains.

00:01:11.544 --> 00:01:13.194
And these thorium and uranium

00:01:13.204 --> 00:01:15.877
are now incorporated into minerals
all over the world,

00:01:15.877 --> 00:01:17.878
but because thorium
has a longer half-life,

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:21.055
it's about three times
more common than uranium.

00:01:21.375 --> 00:01:24.604
This is the most rich deposit
of thorium in North America;

00:01:24.604 --> 00:01:26.464
it's found in Idaho.

00:01:26.674 --> 00:01:30.237
Now as life filled the world
protected by the magnetic field,

00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:33.686
they didn't know any more
about the importance of these minerals,

00:01:33.686 --> 00:01:37.318
and certainly we didn't
as we entered the scene.

00:01:37.318 --> 00:01:41.036
We made our future
out of stones and simple tools

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:45.348
because they were resistant to fire
and they were rugged.

00:01:45.348 --> 00:01:48.207
When we were able
to find metals, like gold,

00:01:48.207 --> 00:01:49.586
we practically worshiped them

00:01:49.586 --> 00:01:51.600
because they were so marvelous and shiny,

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.546
but gold was far too rare
to build an industrial civilization -

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:58.267
you know, we couldn't build a plow
out of gold, or armor or spears.

00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:02.419
Bronze was the material we wanted to use
because it was much more common.

00:02:02.656 --> 00:02:05.785
And the technologies
that allowed us to first smelt iron work

00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:09.399
were really what led to many
modern innovations we have today;

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.444
iron is still the most commonly used
of all the metals.

00:02:12.444 --> 00:02:16.246
In thousands of years of human history,
only seven metals were known.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:20.084
Chemistry and technology
really began in the 1700s

00:02:20.084 --> 00:02:23.085
and was centered in this place,
the Royal Institution in London;

00:02:23.085 --> 00:02:25.404
this was a golden age of science.

00:02:25.594 --> 00:02:28.993
In the basement of the Royal Institution,
10 elements were discovered -

00:02:28.993 --> 00:02:29.985
for instance,

00:02:29.985 --> 00:02:33.779
common table salt is composed
of sodium metal and chlorine gas.

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:39.796
In 1829, a Swedish scientist named
JÃ¶ns Jacob Berzeliu isolated thorium,

00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:43.667
and he gave it this awesome name
named after the Norse god of thunder.

00:02:43.667 --> 00:02:47.514
He had absolutely no idea
how well he had named this element;

00:02:47.514 --> 00:02:50.939
in fact, it's probably the best named
element in the history of elements.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.255
He didn't understand any of that though.

00:02:53.255 --> 00:02:57.445
In 1841, uranium was also discovered
using the same potassium

00:02:57.445 --> 00:03:00.006
that had been discovered
in the Royal Institution.

00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:02.206
And this fellow
also deserves special mention:

00:03:02.206 --> 00:03:03.776
His name is Henri Moissan,

00:03:03.776 --> 00:03:07.526
and he was the French scientist
who first synthesized fluorine.

00:03:07.526 --> 00:03:08.954
What's special about fluorine?

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:11.717
It's the most reactive
of all the elements that we know of;

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:14.827
it's so reactive, in fact,
we never find it in nature by itself,

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.925
we always find it combined
with other things,

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:19.935
like calcium or sodium or so forth.

00:03:19.935 --> 00:03:22.360
But the important thing
to understand about fluorine

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.981
is when it combines with a metal, it forms
very, very, very stable compounds.

00:03:25.981 --> 00:03:29.010
This example is lithium fluoride -
that may sound strange,

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.819
but I'll bet a number of you
brushed your teeth this morning

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.953
with a fluoride salt
called sodium fluoride.

00:03:34.953 --> 00:03:36.526
So if this looks familiar to you,

00:03:36.526 --> 00:03:39.478
you're already well acquainted
with this technology.

00:03:39.478 --> 00:03:42.477
But one of the most important things
that happened with fluorine

00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:46.306
was this gave us the ability, finally,
to synthesize aluminum,

00:03:46.306 --> 00:03:49.199
and aluminum became
an incredibly important metal

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.197
to our modern world:

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:53.547
We would not have airplanes
and we would not have rockets

00:03:53.547 --> 00:03:55.627
if we had not been able
to develop aluminum,

00:03:55.627 --> 00:03:59.159
and fluorine was actually the key
to the development of aluminum.

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:01.007
Now in the late 1800s,

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.658
this lady, Marie Curie,
was trying to understand

00:04:03.658 --> 00:04:06.708
what made thorium and uranium
different than the other elements -

00:04:06.708 --> 00:04:08.039
why were they radioactive? -

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:12.721
and she devoted her life
to try to understand this mystery.

00:04:12.721 --> 00:04:17.258
Thanks to her work and others',
an understanding of the atom developed,

00:04:17.258 --> 00:04:20.018
and it was found to be
kind of like a little solar system -

00:04:20.018 --> 00:04:22.791
now physicists might cringe
because it's not exactly right,

00:04:22.791 --> 00:04:24.552
but it's mostly right -

00:04:24.552 --> 00:04:25.552
that there's a proton

00:04:25.552 --> 00:04:29.023
and there's a neutron
and these particles at the nucleus,

00:04:29.023 --> 00:04:32.114
and then there's these little
tiny electrons spinning around this.

00:04:32.114 --> 00:04:33.544
And this was very important

00:04:33.554 --> 00:04:35.783
because this finally helped them

00:04:35.783 --> 00:04:38.351
crack the mystery of
"what the heck was radioactivity?"

00:04:38.351 --> 00:04:41.427
Radioactivity was a war
going on inside the atom

00:04:41.438 --> 00:04:43.391
between the positively charged protons,

00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.592
that were trying to pull away
from one another,

00:04:45.592 --> 00:04:46.979
and the neutrons and protons,

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.360
which both exerted a force
called the nuclear force

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.838
that helped glue them together.

00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:54.039
Radioactivity happened when there were
too many or too few neutrons

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:55.963
for how many protons you had,

00:04:55.963 --> 00:04:58.016
and also it explained
why certain elements,

00:04:58.016 --> 00:04:59.189
when they got too heavy,

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.443
were always radioactive.

00:05:00.443 --> 00:05:02.299
This explained thorium and uranium

00:05:02.299 --> 00:05:06.259
and, indirectly, why we have energy
from inside the earth, geothermal energy -

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:08.049
all of these things.

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:12.299
It explained why we have the forms
of uranium and thorium we have today.

00:05:12.299 --> 00:05:16.151
There's only three natural forms
of radioactive material.

00:05:16.151 --> 00:05:19.009
One of them is found in thorium -
it's 14 billion years old -

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:20.959
and then two more are found in uranium.

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:24.707
Now, the part of uranium
that we use for nuclear energy now

00:05:24.707 --> 00:05:26.087
is just a tiny, tiny amount;

00:05:26.087 --> 00:05:30.606
it's only seven parts in 1000
of the natural uranium is used for energy.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.799
And in 1938, two scientists,
Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner in Germany

00:05:36.799 --> 00:05:40.293
discovered that that small amount
of uranium could be fissioned -

00:05:40.293 --> 00:05:41.388
it could be split apart

00:05:41.388 --> 00:05:44.208
and that released neutrons
and much, much, much more energy.

00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:48.670
And this was a great discovery
that thrilled scientists around the world,

00:05:48.853 --> 00:05:52.354
but the leadership in Germany
kind of looked at the whole thing as scams

00:05:52.354 --> 00:05:53.606
because Meitner was Jewish

00:05:53.606 --> 00:05:57.853
and she had fled Germany to Sweden
to escape the Nazis.

00:05:57.853 --> 00:05:59.564
But scientists in the United States,

00:05:59.564 --> 00:06:02.422
particularly Jewish scientists
that had fled Europe,

00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:04.513
were paying very
close attention to this work

00:06:04.513 --> 00:06:06.133
and trying to alert the government

00:06:06.133 --> 00:06:10.515
the research will probably be going on
in using uranium as an explosive.

00:06:11.365 --> 00:06:14.814
So, they knew that they would need to go
and change the amount of uranium

00:06:14.814 --> 00:06:16.333
that was this very rare stuff,

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.343
and here fluorine
came to the rescue again;

00:06:18.343 --> 00:06:22.104
by combining fluorine with uranium -
six fluorine atoms for each uranium atom -

00:06:22.104 --> 00:06:24.052
they were able to make uranium into a gas

00:06:24.052 --> 00:06:25.053
that was suitable

00:06:25.053 --> 00:06:28.413
for increasing or enriching
the concentration of uranium-235.

00:06:28.413 --> 00:06:32.173
This whole technology wouldn't have worked
if fluorine had different properties,

00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:35.289
but fortunately, fluorine
only has one kind of structure:

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.105
nine protons, ten neutrons -
no other kind -

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:40.166
and that's what allows it, in this form,

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.515
to preserve that very,
very delicate balance

00:06:42.515 --> 00:06:46.047
between the heavier form of uranium
and the lighter form of uranium.

00:06:46.597 --> 00:06:49.755
The story for thorium ironically, though,
begins with this fellow:

00:06:49.755 --> 00:06:52.060
his name was Glenn Seaborg,
and he was a chemist

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.466
at the University of California
in Berkeley in 1939.

00:06:55.466 --> 00:06:58.126
He was following the work in Germany
very, very closely,

00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.125
and he wanted to know

00:06:59.125 --> 00:07:02.385
if other elements
could be used for nuclear energy.

00:07:02.385 --> 00:07:06.024
He had access to the most powerful
nuclear physics machine in the world;

00:07:06.024 --> 00:07:07.616
it was called the cyclotron.

00:07:07.616 --> 00:07:08.666
And with this machine,

00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:11.526
he was able to bombard
uranium and thorium with neutrons,

00:07:11.526 --> 00:07:14.147
and he discovered new elements,
neptunium and plutonium,

00:07:14.147 --> 00:07:17.668
and he also discovered
a new form of uranium called uranium-233.

00:07:17.668 --> 00:07:19.217
With more work on the cyclotron,

00:07:19.217 --> 00:07:20.220
he discovered

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:24.456
that both plutonium and uranium-233
could also be turned into nuclear fuels.

00:07:24.456 --> 00:07:26.757
And so in a very short period of time,

00:07:27.057 --> 00:07:28.526
Seaborg had discovered a way

00:07:28.526 --> 00:07:31.926
to turn all of these nuclear fuels
into potential energy sources,

00:07:31.926 --> 00:07:35.807
and this was a discovery that had
profound implications for the world.

00:07:35.807 --> 00:07:38.525
Unfortunately, it was discovered
at exactly the wrong time

00:07:38.525 --> 00:07:40.526
because this was
the middle of World War II

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:43.900
and everything was being devoted
into a wartime effort.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:45.566
Before long,

00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:48.756
Seaborg was read into a secret program
called the Manhattan Project

00:07:48.756 --> 00:07:52.196
and he was instructed to go and use
his discovery of plutonium

00:07:52.196 --> 00:07:55.056
to prepare materials for a nuclear weapon.

00:07:55.966 --> 00:07:58.540
Not long thereafter,
the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.326
and the United States
was launched into World War II.

00:08:01.326 --> 00:08:03.656
Seaborg was also still
very curious about thorium,

00:08:03.656 --> 00:08:05.987
so he made sure
one of the first reactors built

00:08:05.987 --> 00:08:09.417
was loaded with some thorium so
he could learn more about its properties.

00:08:09.417 --> 00:08:13.266
Unfortunately, he wanted to find out if
he could use thorium as a nuclear weapon -

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:14.266
it was wartime.

00:08:14.266 --> 00:08:16.615
When the results came back,
he was very surprised;

00:08:16.615 --> 00:08:20.378
he found out that fluorine
was really going to be totally lousy

00:08:20.378 --> 00:08:21.376
for a nuclear weapon

00:08:21.376 --> 00:08:23.428
because the uranium-233
that would be formed

00:08:23.428 --> 00:08:25.701
would always be contaminated
with other things

00:08:25.701 --> 00:08:28.638
that were going to emit
large amounts of radiation.

00:08:28.638 --> 00:08:29.926
But he discovered something

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:32.496
that's still very important
for us to know about today,

00:08:32.496 --> 00:08:34.406
which is that uranium-233 had a property

00:08:34.406 --> 00:08:37.407
where it could continue
to make enough neutrons in its fission

00:08:37.407 --> 00:08:41.797
to create new uranium-233 at an equal
or greater rate than it was consumed.

00:08:41.797 --> 00:08:45.119
And this meant that thorium
could be used as a nuclear fuel

00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:47.916
that would last essentially
as long as the thorium lasted,

00:08:47.916 --> 00:08:50.066
and because thorium was so common,

00:08:50.066 --> 00:08:52.208
this meant that we would have
an energy source

00:08:52.208 --> 00:08:54.157
that would essentially never run out.

00:08:54.157 --> 00:08:56.352
But again, all of these realizations

00:08:56.352 --> 00:09:00.407
were swept away by the wartime need
for a nuclear explosion,

00:09:00.407 --> 00:09:02.408
and the United States was the only country

00:09:02.408 --> 00:09:04.973
that had the technology
for nuclear explosions,

00:09:04.973 --> 00:09:06.336
and they had a big secret,

00:09:06.336 --> 00:09:08.997
which was that they were out of bombs
after World War II,

00:09:08.997 --> 00:09:12.046
and so all of their effort
went into making more nuclear weapons,

00:09:12.046 --> 00:09:15.907
they did not put effort into "how can we
go and make nuclear energy?"

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:18.942
There was great controversy
over who should be in charge.

00:09:18.942 --> 00:09:21.532
Ultimately, they decided
to create a civilian agency,

00:09:21.532 --> 00:09:23.342
but they gave it a military mission.

00:09:23.342 --> 00:09:25.251
I say all these things with great regret

00:09:25.251 --> 00:09:26.250
because I'm convinced

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.031
that had nuclear fission been discovered
at some other time in human history,

00:09:30.031 --> 00:09:32.431
we would have had
a very, very different story.

00:09:32.431 --> 00:09:34.833
If your introduction
to something is very negative,

00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:37.275
you tend to think about it
negatively from then on.

00:09:37.275 --> 00:09:40.981
People were not thinking about how to use
nuclear energy for positive purposes

00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:42.409
because of the wartime effort,

00:09:42.409 --> 00:09:45.551
and so it's one of these great tragedies
of how our history evolved

00:09:45.551 --> 00:09:48.002
that nuclear attains
such a negative impression

00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:49.842
in people's minds from the outset.

00:09:49.842 --> 00:09:53.912
After the war, there was a tiny focus
on making some nuclear energy

00:09:53.912 --> 00:09:55.373
using a sodium reactor,

00:09:55.373 --> 00:09:57.231
and this was because it had the ability

00:09:57.231 --> 00:10:00.174
to make more plutonium
and better plutonium than it consumed.

00:10:00.174 --> 00:10:03.772
But this fellow, Alvin Weinberg,
he also was somebody who chose to start.

00:10:03.772 --> 00:10:07.553
He chose to start looking at thorium
at the Oak Ridge National Labs

00:10:07.553 --> 00:10:08.562
after the war,

00:10:08.562 --> 00:10:11.343
and his efforts in thorium were spurred

00:10:11.343 --> 00:10:13.732
because he had gotten a contract
from the Air Force

00:10:13.732 --> 00:10:16.092
to look at a power source for a bomber -

00:10:16.092 --> 00:10:18.571
he wasn't particularly interested
in nuclear bombers,

00:10:18.571 --> 00:10:21.911
but he knew it would be a way
to develop a new and advanced reactor.

00:10:21.911 --> 00:10:25.381
This was the reactor they came up with
in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment,

00:10:25.381 --> 00:10:28.762
and it was the first reactor
to use these fluoride salts successfully.

00:10:28.762 --> 00:10:30.502
The reactor program was cancelled,

00:10:30.502 --> 00:10:32.984
but at the same time,
another group of industrialists

00:10:32.984 --> 00:10:36.462
was looking at using the sodium reactor
and advancing that technology;

00:10:36.462 --> 00:10:39.843
they wanted to build a sodium reactor
that would make lots of plutonium,

00:10:39.843 --> 00:10:43.764
and they put a lot of money and effort
into building this consortium of utilities

00:10:43.764 --> 00:10:45.834
and began building this reactor.

00:10:45.834 --> 00:10:48.412
It was completed in 1963

00:10:49.352 --> 00:10:52.791
and not long thereafter,
unfortunately, suffered a meltdown

00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:57.173
and was very concerning to a lot of people
who were living in Michigan at the time.

00:10:58.133 --> 00:11:00.623
At the same time,
Weinberg was designing a reactor

00:11:00.623 --> 00:11:04.614
that was completely immune to the idea
of nuclear meltdowns or nuclear accidents.

00:11:04.614 --> 00:11:06.822
By using this fluoride salt

00:11:06.822 --> 00:11:09.863
and its stability that it had
because of its chemical properties,

00:11:09.863 --> 00:11:12.201
they could design a reactor
that wouldn't meltdown

00:11:12.201 --> 00:11:13.630
or have any of these problems;

00:11:13.630 --> 00:11:17.092
it would operate at low pressures
but yet high temperatures

00:11:17.092 --> 00:11:18.318
and have safety features

00:11:18.318 --> 00:11:21.272
that were really far in advance
even of anything we have today.

00:11:21.272 --> 00:11:23.893
They successfully built
and operated this reactor -

00:11:23.893 --> 00:11:26.803
in fact, Glenn Seaborg here
was at the controls of the reactor

00:11:26.803 --> 00:11:29.685
when it used uranium-233
as its first fuel load.

00:11:29.865 --> 00:11:33.203
They were very pleased
with the success of this reactor in 1969,

00:11:33.203 --> 00:11:36.873
but unfortunately, budget cuts
which had been instituted by Richard Nixon

00:11:36.873 --> 00:11:38.734
meant that the Atomic Energy Commission

00:11:38.734 --> 00:11:40.921
could only go forward
with one kind of reactor.

00:11:40.921 --> 00:11:44.592
They didn't choose the thorium reactor
but the plutonium fast breeder reactor.

00:11:44.592 --> 00:11:46.931
They wanted to build
another one in the 1970s,

00:11:46.931 --> 00:11:50.432
and this program ultimately
went on to be cancelled.

00:11:50.432 --> 00:11:51.954
But even after it was cancelled,

00:11:51.954 --> 00:11:54.242
they didn't go back and say,
"What about thorium?

00:11:54.242 --> 00:11:55.352
Was that a good idea?

00:11:55.352 --> 00:11:58.213
Was that perhaps a better choice
that we should have taken?"

00:11:58.213 --> 00:12:00.313
To me, this is one
of the great regrets again

00:12:00.313 --> 00:12:03.354
that this technology path
was not chosen.

00:12:03.354 --> 00:12:06.404
The United States went on to complete
almost 100 nuclear reactors

00:12:06.404 --> 00:12:07.691
in the 1980s and the 1990s,

00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:11.233
but really, things started to bottom out
in the '90s in the nuclear field -

00:12:11.233 --> 00:12:13.103
there weren't new reactors being built;

00:12:13.103 --> 00:12:15.215
there wasn't new technology
being developed.

00:12:15.215 --> 00:12:18.943
Now we do have two new nuclear reactors
under construction in Georgia,

00:12:18.943 --> 00:12:22.382
but we're closing down nuclear reactors
faster than we're opening them.

00:12:22.382 --> 00:12:24.112
And we still have an issue:

00:12:24.112 --> 00:12:26.252
What will we do
about long-term nuclear waste?

00:12:26.252 --> 00:12:29.052
It's an unsolved issue,
and it concerns a lot of people.

00:12:29.052 --> 00:12:31.433
One of the great advantages
of the thorium approach

00:12:31.433 --> 00:12:34.442
is that thorium does not produce
the long-lived nuclear waste

00:12:34.442 --> 00:12:36.012
that the uranium fuel cycle does,

00:12:36.012 --> 00:12:38.581
and this is because it starts
from a different position

00:12:38.581 --> 00:12:39.992
on the periodic table

00:12:39.992 --> 00:12:43.752
and is able to have more opportunities
to consume all of its nuclear fuel

00:12:43.752 --> 00:12:46.723
rather than to produce
long-lived nuclear waste.

00:12:47.073 --> 00:12:48.982
These fluoride salts that I've mentioned

00:12:48.982 --> 00:12:54.733
are an ideal fuel for creating safe,
easily operable reactors

00:12:54.733 --> 00:12:56.302
that can use thorium efficiently,

00:12:56.302 --> 00:12:59.913
and they can also burn up the kinds
of nuclear waste we've already produced -

00:12:59.913 --> 00:13:02.184
they would be very,
very good at this task.

00:13:02.184 --> 00:13:03.992
Because they operate at low pressures,

00:13:03.992 --> 00:13:07.232
they don't need big containment structures
like existing reactors do,

00:13:07.232 --> 00:13:10.754
and this allows them to be built
in factories for a lot less money.

00:13:11.264 --> 00:13:13.792
Because we know that we're going
to need to go forward

00:13:13.792 --> 00:13:16.592
with producing more energy at lower cost

00:13:16.592 --> 00:13:21.233
and creating less pollution and less
and less challenge to our environment.

00:13:22.183 --> 00:13:24.952
So I have been working on a design

00:13:24.952 --> 00:13:29.113
for a modular nuclear reactor
based on thorium and these fluoride salts

00:13:29.113 --> 00:13:30.771
that has got me very excited

00:13:30.771 --> 00:13:32.883
because not only will it
produce electricity,

00:13:32.883 --> 00:13:34.943
but it will also produce
desalinated water,

00:13:34.943 --> 00:13:37.852
and it will also produce
a particular nuclear medicines

00:13:37.852 --> 00:13:39.041
that are in great demand.

00:13:39.041 --> 00:13:42.421
[Nuclear energy. The dream that failed]
Things like this aren't helpful.

00:13:42.421 --> 00:13:44.183
I really think this is totally wrong.

00:13:44.183 --> 00:13:46.373
I don't think nuclear
is the dream that failed.

00:13:46.373 --> 00:13:47.803
I think what happened was

00:13:47.803 --> 00:13:50.883
the way we went in nuclear
was shaped by the wrong influences -

00:13:50.883 --> 00:13:53.913
we were shaped by a desire
for things related to war

00:13:53.913 --> 00:13:57.011
rather than things related
to energy and electricity

00:13:57.011 --> 00:13:58.998
and things that help people.

00:13:59.278 --> 00:14:00.630
So, several years ago,

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.663
as I was pondering

00:14:01.663 --> 00:14:05.830
whether or not I should make this leap
into starting a new company,

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:08.900
I had to really think hard
because I was in a great job -

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:09.906
I loved it -

00:14:09.906 --> 00:14:10.971
I had a new baby;

00:14:10.971 --> 00:14:13.351
it just really didn't seem
like the right time.

00:14:13.351 --> 00:14:14.350
But I found out

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.378
that other countries were going forward
with new nuclear reactor technology

00:14:18.378 --> 00:14:20.380
using thorium and fluoride salts,

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.639
and I really felt like,

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:24.339
unless I made the decision
to start working on this,

00:14:24.339 --> 00:14:25.630
it wasn't going to happen -

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.681
I've been doing
tech development long enough

00:14:27.681 --> 00:14:29.911
to know these things
don't happen on their own,

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:32.181
they happen because
somebody decides to do them.

00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:35.071
And so, just a few months
before I got started,

00:14:35.071 --> 00:14:37.050
the Fukushima accident happened in Japan,

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:40.580
and I really, again, had to wonder,
Is this the right move to make?

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.630
But then, when I considered
the fundamentals

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:47.020
that people would not stop wanting energy,
they would not stop wanting reliability,

00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:51.180
and they would definitely keep wanting
to have as clean energy as was possible,

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.701
I knew there was no other choice;
I had to go forward.

00:14:53.701 --> 00:14:56.740
And it's been tough;
I've learned a lot of things since then.

00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:00.590
I've learned that when you're, you know,
36 years old and you got a wife and kids,

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.540
you're not exactly the kind of investment

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.300
your typical venture capitalist
is looking for.

00:15:05.601 --> 00:15:09.212
I might have done better if I wore
a hoodie and ate some more pizza.

00:15:09.212 --> 00:15:10.210
(Laughter)

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.719
I also realized that nuclear reactors
are not iPhone apps or anything like that.

00:15:14.719 --> 00:15:17.821
This isn't the kind
of in-and-out type investment

00:15:17.821 --> 00:15:20.186
that most investors are looking for.

00:15:20.186 --> 00:15:22.241
So, it's been an eye-opening experience,

00:15:22.241 --> 00:15:24.051
but I've met some really great people,

00:15:24.051 --> 00:15:27.300
and I've been really grateful
for letters of support that I've gotten

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.491
from all over the world -

00:15:28.491 --> 00:15:30.951
people who say, "Keep at it.
Keep up the good work.

00:15:30.951 --> 00:15:34.672
This will make a difference in our future,
and we will turn out better for it."

00:15:34.672 --> 00:15:37.099
And really, if I could just
leave you with my belief

00:15:37.099 --> 00:15:39.489
that, you know, each of us
has to make a choice

00:15:39.489 --> 00:15:41.871
of what can we do
to make the world the best place.

00:15:41.871 --> 00:15:45.300
The best thing I can do for the world
is to be a great dad for my family,

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.830
and the next best thing I can do

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.526
is to try to use my talents
to bring about an energy source

00:15:50.526 --> 00:15:52.541
that can benefit all of us.

00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:54.546
And I just want to leave you with the idea

00:15:54.546 --> 00:15:57.021
that please use your talents and abilities

00:15:57.021 --> 00:15:59.831
and choose to start to make
the best kind of future you can.

00:15:59.831 --> 00:16:01.180
Thank you very much.

00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:03.479
(Cheers) (Applause)
