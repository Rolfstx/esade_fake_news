00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.240
Behind any commercial flight is more than
a century of political negotiation and accords

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.610
that dictate who, how, and where airlines
can fly.

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.709
Aviation is one of the most unifying industries
worldwide because it is what brings the world

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:16.709
together.

00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:21.500
The beginning of aviation agreements
came with the 1944 Chicago Convention on International

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.099
Civil Aviation.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.550
This convention
established the UN oversight agency responsible

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.130
for civil aviation—the International Civil
Aviation Organization.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.540
The ICAO is recognized by every country worldwide
except for

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.500
Liechtenstein, Dominica, and Tuvalu.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.200
Of those, Tuvalu is the sole country to have
an

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.740
international airport, so that means that
all but one sky-faring nation worldwide is

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.320
a part of the
ICAO.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.960
Soon after its inception, the ICAO laid out
five fundamental rights of aviation, known

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.210
as
the Five Freedoms of the Air, which serve

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.760
as a framework for international aviation
agreements.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.350
Each freedom has varying levels of acceptance,
but every developed nation worldwide grants

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.600
these rights to certain foreign airlines.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.470
The first freedom of the air is the right
to fly over a foreign country without landing.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.549
Pretty much every commercial flight and commercial
airline is allowed to do this.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.460
There are
exceptions—the EU has a list of hundreds

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.259
supposedly unsafe airlines that are not allowed
in EU

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.280
airspace—but there are no large airlines
today restricted from certain airspace.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.330
It may seem like a
given that foreign airlines can overfly countries,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.040
but the airspace above a country is sovereign
territory of that country… more or less.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.249
There isn’t actually an internationally
recognized line of

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:45.100
separation between sovereign airspace and
space.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.780
Some say it’s 19 miles above sea level—the
highest altitude balloons and planes can fly—while

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.060
others say its as high as 99 miles—the
altitude of the lowest stable earth orbits.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.049
The US classifies anyone who’s flown 50
miles or

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.850
higher above earth as an astronaut, so that
therefore means that the US recognizes 50

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.250
miles
above earth as the beginning of space, however,

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.700
there are instances in which the US hasn’t
respected sovereignty below 50 miles.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.190
When Space Shuttle missions returned to earth,
they did

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.100
so much like an airplane—with a slow horizontal
descent down to a runway.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.470
Their descent paths
were so long that they had to descend over

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.430
foreign nations, such as Canada, below 50
miles of

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.930
altitude, and yet the US never requested permission
from Canada to fly in their airspace.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.810
Just
because airlines are allowed to fly over foreign

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.730
countries doesn’t mean that they can do
so

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.520
without restriction.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.200
Of course they need to be in contact with
Air Traffic Control, but they also

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.740
need to pay whats known as overflight fees.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.620
Overflight fees are how airlines pay foreign
countries they fly over but don’t land or

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.630
take
off in for the use of their air traffic control

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.120
services.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.040
Airlines still have to pay to use air traffic
control in countries they land or take off

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.250
in, but these fees are paid and calculated
in different

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.840
ways depending on the country.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.310
Overflight fees are nearly universal.

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.490
The US, for example,
charges $56.86 per 100 nautical miles.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.290
You may think that these fees are fairly inconsequential
since the only international flights that

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.120
really fly over the US without landing are
flights to, from,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.220
or between Mexico, Canada, and some Caribbean
nations, however, the US is actually

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.340
responsible for a huge amount of airspace—way
larger than the US itself.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.970
It was allocated this
airspace by the International Civil Aviation

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.060
Organization and since it provides air traffic
control

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.670
for this area, it also charges overflight
fees.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.640
This does mean, weirdly, that flights from
Australia,

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.500
New Zealand, Papa New Guinea, and other Melanesian
countries pay overflight fees to the US

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.730
when flying to north-east Asian destinations
such as Japan, Korea, and China.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.060
In US oceanic
airspace, however, airlines only pay $21.63

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.660
per 100 nautical miles.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.450
It may seem like these small charges would
have little effect, but on long haul flights

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.960
overflight fees can really add up.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.780
Especially with the razor thin airline margins
that you learned

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.499
about my “Why Flying is so Expensive”
video, airlines do have to put consideration

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:24.749
into where
they fly based on overflight fees.

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:27.830
Canadian overflight fees are notoriously expensive.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.500
They work
on a variable cost structure based on takeoff

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.259
weight and distance flown so I won’t go
into actual

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:34.629
numbers.

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:39.280
Almost any flight originating in the US has
to fly through expensive Canadian airspace

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.940
en-route to Europe as you learned in my video
about the North Atlantic Tracks, but airlines

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.759
do
have strategies to lower these costs.

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.080
The most efficient route between San Francisco
and

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.930
Frankfurt goes north through Montana, up over
north-east Canada, then across Greenland,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.379
Iceland, and down into Europe; however, airlines
don’t always use this route.

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:02.159
On certain days
with certain wind and weather conditions,

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:04.779
they’ll fly east through the United States,
then enter

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:10.129
Canadian airspace somewhere over Minneapolis
or Chicago so that they’ll pay less in Canadian

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:12.020
overflight fees.

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.139
Complicated route planning software takes
all variables—weight, weather,

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.720
overflight fees, etc—into account and figures
out what route is most financially efficient,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.580
even if
it wastes time or fuel.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.949
Moving on, the second freedom of the air is
the right for airlines to land in foreign

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.569
countries for technical stops.

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.669
Essentially, that means refueling.

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.630
Modern airplanes have ranges of
up to 9,000 miles, so there’s little need

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.870
anymore for refueling stops, but in the past
they were

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.100
crucial for long-haul flights.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.910
Shannon airport, in western Ireland, once
received hundreds of

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:51.449
flights per day despite being located in a
exceptionally rural area.

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.029
The nearest large city to
Shannon, Limerick, has a population of less

00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:59.870
than 100,000, but geographically, Shannon
airport is

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.640
the nearest airport to the US so back when
airplanes had shorter ranges they’d make

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.800
a stop to
refuel in Shannon before continuing on to

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.039
their continental european destination.

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.590
During the era
of the Soviet Union, almost no airline had

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.020
permission to overfly the USSR, so airlines
had to

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.219
literally go the other way round the earth.

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:23.800
Nearly every flight between Europe and Asia
was

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.710
routed with a technical stop in Anchorage,
Alaska to refuel.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.279
Obviously this was incredibly
inefficient.

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:35.020
Today’s direct Europe-Asia flights take
between 10-12 hours, but back when they

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.650
stopped in Anchorage they took as many as
22 hours.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:44.169
Despite the huge range of airplanes today,
there are still some flights that require

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.599
refueling stops.

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:49.990
Australia and New Zealand are almost
exactly on the opposite side of the world

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.249
from London, so any flight between the two
places has

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:55.169
to make a stop somewhere.

00:06:55.169 --> 00:06:58.500
On its London-Sydney flights, Qantas Airlines
makes a stop in

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.650
Dubai, and on flights between London and Auckland,
Air New Zealand stops in Los Angeles.

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.969
It
is expected, however, that within weeks or

00:07:06.969 --> 00:07:09.879
days of this video going up, Qantas airlines
will

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:15.029
announce a new direct route between Perth
in Western Australia and London with their

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:18.319
787-900
Dreamliners which would be the first direct

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:21.419
commercial service in history between Europe
and

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:22.729
Australia.

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:29.280
This 9,000 mile trek would take an immense
18 hours to connect the two continents.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.930
The third freedom of the air is pretty simple—the
right to fly commercially from one’s

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:36.129
own country to another country.

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:39.071
This is just like Air France flying Paris
to New York, or

00:07:39.071 --> 00:07:42.650
Singapore Airlines flying Singapore to Dubai.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:45.279
Almost every international airline is granted
this

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.719
third freedom.

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:50.620
The forth freedom is just the inverse of this—the
right to fly commercially from

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:52.529
another country to one’s own.

00:07:52.529 --> 00:07:56.460
There are really no instances where the third
and fourth freedoms

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.750
are granted separately—if an airline is
allowed to fly somewhere, they’re also allowed

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:03.059
to fly
back with passengers.

00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:07.249
The fifth and final official freedom is the
right for an airline to fly passengers between

00:08:07.249 --> 00:08:11.979
two foreign countries on a flight originating
or terminating in their own country.

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:14.780
Now, this is
very similar to the second freedom and the

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:19.529
second and fifth freedoms often, but not always,
granted together.

00:08:19.529 --> 00:08:23.870
With the second freedom, Qantas is allowed
to stop in Dubai to refuel, but if

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:28.240
they’re granted the fifth freedom, Qantas
is also allowed to pick up new paying passengers

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.879
in
Dubai and fly them to London.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:33.789
Some examples of this freedom include Air
India’s New York-

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:39.029
London-Hyderabad route which is allowed to
fly passengers between New York and London,

00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:43.289
Cathay Pacific’s Hong Kong-Vancouver-New
York route which is allowed to fly passengers

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:48.839
between Vancouver and New York, and Ethiopian
Airlines Addis Abada-Dublin-Los Angeles

00:08:48.839 --> 00:08:52.360
flight which is allowed to fly passengers
between Los Angeles and Dublin, however the

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:53.360
king of
all fifth freedom routes has to be United

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.360
Airlines Island Hopper route between Hawaii
and

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.360
Guam.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.360
This flight stops in Majuro, Marshall Islands;
Kwajalein, Marshall Islands; Pohnpei,

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360
Micronesia; and Chuuk, Micronesia and has
fifth freedom rights at every stop, but lets

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360
move on
to the sixth freedom.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.750
It is a little strange that there is a sixth
freedom in the five freedoms of aviation.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:02.589
There are
actually nine total freedoms, but only the

00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:06.290
first five are recognized officially in the
ICAO’s five

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.130
freedoms treaty.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:12.730
While freedoms six through nine are widely
accepted, they are not as universal,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:13.769
except for number six.

00:09:13.769 --> 00:09:16.970
The sixth freedom is actually unbelievably
common.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:20.420
It’s the right for an
airline to transport passengers from one foreign

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.620
country to another via their own country.

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:25.980
This is
just like Air France taking passengers from

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.310
New York to Dubai via Paris or Korean Airlines
taking passengers from Frankfurt to Tokyo

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:32.660
via Seoul.

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:37.320
As you can tell, having six freedom rights
is basically a fancy way to say airlines are

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:39.430
allowed to connect passengers.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.740
There are whole
airlines that operate almost exclusively using

00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.230
sixth freedom rights.

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:48.350
Wow Airlines and Icelandair
take passengers from North America to Europe

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:51.740
via Reykjavik; and Turkish, Qatar, Ethiad,
and

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:57.000
Emirates airlines take passengers mostly between
Europe, Africa, and Asia via their Middle

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.490
Eastern hubs.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:02.220
While each of these airlines do have some
passengers only taking a direct flight to

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.480
their hub, the vast majority of their traffic
is connecting due to their geographic positions

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.380
between population centers.

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:14.300
I’ll finish off by grouping the seventh,
eight, and ninth freedoms together as you’ll

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.120
see
they’re quite similar and often come together.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.120
The seventh freedom allows an airlines to
fly

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.500
between two foreign nations without continuing
on to its home, the eight freedom is the right

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.980
for
an airline to fly between two cities in one

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.350
foreign country when continuing on to its
own country,

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:35.320
and the ninth and final freedom is the right
for an airline to fly between two points in

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.709
a foreign
country without continuing on to its own country.

00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:41.560
It’s extremely rare for these freedoms to
be

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.000
granted, except for in the European Union.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.040
You see, the European Union has a single aviation
market, meaning that any airline registered

00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:54.100
in an EU country is allowed to fly flights
between, to,

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.399
and from any airport in the EU.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:59.579
Budget Airlines like Ryanair and EasyJet thrive
off this

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:00.819
regulation.

00:11:00.819 --> 00:11:05.940
Despite being an Irish airline, Ryanair is
allowed to fly routes like Edinburgh to

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:11.190
London, Paris to Lyon, and other domestic
routes in foreign EU countries due to this

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.089
single
aviation market.

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:16.529
There are almost no other instances worldwide
where foreign airlines are

00:11:16.529 --> 00:11:19.029
allowed to fly domestic routes.

00:11:19.029 --> 00:11:22.310
Ryanair is also allowed to fly routes between
two other EU

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:26.790
countries, like Paris to Berlin, and from
other EU countries to outside the EU, such

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:29.410
as Barcelona
to Fez, Morocco.

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:33.430
This is also how Norwegian Airline is allowed
to fly long haul from Sweden,

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:38.360
Denmark, and the UK to the US… well, more
or less.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:42.769
You may recall that Norway is actually not
part of the European Union, so they’re not

00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:45.820
part of the EU’s single aviation market,
but,

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:50.790
interestingly, Norwegian Airlines is actually
registered in Ireland, Sweden, Denmark, Finland,

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:55.750
and the UK in order to gain access to the
EU’s single aviation market, as well as

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.069
the open skies
treaty that allows unlimited and unrestricted

00:11:59.069 --> 00:12:01.839
flights between the EU and the US.

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:04.360
There’s one
really interesting use of these treaties and

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.290
regulations in the form of short-haul flights
between

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.540
the Caribbean and United States.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.290
Norwegian Airlines offers flights during the
winter months

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.199
from Boston, New York, and Baltimore to Martinique
and Guadeloupe.

00:12:16.199 --> 00:12:19.410
And these aren’t
extensions to their long-haul flights using

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.160
fifth freedom rights.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:25.560
These are standalone flights in
small airplanes—Boston and Baltimore don’t

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.350
even have Norwegian trans-atlantic flights.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.529
Normally a flight like this would never be
allowed, but since Martinique is an overseas

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:34.410
region
and Guadeloupe is a overseas territory of

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.149
France, they’re also part of the EU’s
single aviation

00:12:37.149 --> 00:12:39.899
market and the open-skies treaty.

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:44.790
So those are the five, or rather nine freedoms
of aviation.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.209
Aviation is a very politically
charged and complicated subject, but these

00:12:48.209 --> 00:12:54.500
freedoms do a great job of simplifying and
standardizing airline regulations worldwide.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.639
