 Translator: Ahmed Gamal Auditor: Ayman Mahmoud 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.210
 Chris Anderson: Elon, welcome back to TED. 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.446
 It's great to be here. 

00:00:16.446 --> 00:00:18.210
 Elon Musk: Thanks for having me. 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.266
 So, for about the next half an hour, 

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.070
 We will spend some time 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.026
 In exploring your vision of what an exciting future might look like, 

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:31.136
 And that, I think, would make the first question a little comic 

00:00:31.136 --> 00:00:32.906
 Why do you dig? 

00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:34.136
 Yes. 

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:36.630
 I ask myself this question a lot. 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.226
 We're trying to dig a hole down the city of Los Angeles, 

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:46.446
 In order to start the beginning 

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:50.540
 Why we hope to be a 3D tunnel network 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.586
 To reduce congestion. 

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:59.120
 Currently, one of the most frustrating things is traffic. 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.056
 It affects people all over the world. 

00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:05.876
 Much of your life is lost. 

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:07.840
 This is terrible. 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.506
 Especially in Los Angeles. 

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:12.186
 (Laughter) 

00:01:12.186 --> 00:01:14.176
 I think you brought it with you 

00:01:14.176 --> 00:01:16.625
 The first visualization will be shown. 

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:17.976
 Can I show it? 

00:01:17.976 --> 00:01:20.686
 Yes, of course, this is the first time ... 

00:01:20.686 --> 00:01:22.560
 Just to clarify what we are talking about. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.796
 There are a few important basic things 

00:01:24.796 --> 00:01:28.590
 To create a 3D tunnel network. 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.170
 First, you must be able 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.566
 On merging the entrance and exit of the tunnel 

00:01:32.566 --> 00:01:34.656
 Seamlessly with the architecture of the city. 

00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:38.344
 By elevator, 

00:01:38.344 --> 00:01:43.126
 Something like a car platform on an elevator 

00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:47.096
 You will be able to integrate the inlet and outlet with the tunnel network 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.670
 Using only two parking spaces. 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.760
 Then the car is placed on a platform. 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.176
 There is no top speed; 

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:59.216
 So we design this to work at speeds equal to 200 kilometers per hour. 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.406
 How many? 

00:02:00.406 --> 00:02:04.900
 200 km per hour, or about 130 miles per hour. 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.830
 That is, you will be able to go, for example, from Westwood to Los Angeles Airport 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.146
 In 6 minutes .. 5 to 6 minutes. 

00:02:13.146 --> 00:02:17.450
 (clap) 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.720
 So maybe in the beginning 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.446
 It will resemble a pathway with charging points. 

00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:22.370
 Yes. 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.746
 Which I think will relieve some of the crowding 

00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:26.420
 On the surface roads as well. 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.146
 I don’t know if you noticed this in the video, 

00:02:29.146 --> 00:02:34.230
 But there is no limit to the number of tunnels levels that can be reached. 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.106
 You can go deeper than you can go up. 

00:02:37.106 --> 00:02:41.290
 The deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings. 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.540
 So you can reduce any random level of urban congestion 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.946
 Using the tunnels network. 

00:02:47.946 --> 00:02:49.456
 This is a very important point. 

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:55.690
 One of the main drawbacks of tunnels is that if you add a layer of tunnels 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.656
 Just to reduce congestion, the void will be exhausted, 

00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:01.966
 And you will go back where you started, to congestion again. 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.436
 But you can reach any number of tunnels, 

00:03:04.436 --> 00:03:05.786
 And any number of levels. 

00:03:05.786 --> 00:03:09.230
 But people think that drilling is usually very expensive; 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.246
 This would end this idea. 

00:03:11.246 --> 00:03:12.690
 Yes. 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.106
 Well, they are right. 

00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:17.906
 To give you an example, the Los Angeles subway stretch, 

00:03:17.906 --> 00:03:21.556
 Which I think spanned 2.5 miles. 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.813
 It was created at a cost of $ 2 billion. 

00:03:23.813 --> 00:03:29.256
 That is, about a billion dollars a mile, to construct the Los Angeles subway line. 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.250
 This is not the most beneficial underground line in the world. 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.750
 So yeah, tunneling is usually very difficult. 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.986
 I think we should get at least a tenth 

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:43.300
 Of the cost of digging a mile. 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.100
 How can you achieve this? 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.156
 In fact, if you only do two things, 

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:53.476
 Then you can reduce the cost to about a tenth 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.706
 And I think you can go beyond that. 

00:03:55.706 --> 00:03:59.976
 The first thing to do is to reduce the diameter of the tunnel 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.606
 For half or less. 

00:04:01.606 --> 00:04:05.596
 The tunnel needed for a one-lane road, in accordance with the laws, 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.536
 Diameter must be 26 feet and perhaps 28 feet; 

00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:11.676
 To accommodate accidents and emergency vehicles, 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.950
 And to allow adequate ventilation for combustion engines. 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.606
 But if you reduce this diameter to the one we seek, 

00:04:19.606 --> 00:04:23.416
 It's 12 feet, that's more than enough to hold an electric platform, 

00:04:23.416 --> 00:04:26.506
 You will reduce the diameter in half, 

00:04:26.506 --> 00:04:30.300
 And the cross-sectional area of ​​the strip to the fourth, 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.980
 The cost of drilling is related to the cross-sectional area; 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.030
 This means that the cost has been reduced to nearly one-fifth so far. 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:41.420
 In addition, tunnel boring machines currently operate for half the time and then stop, 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.666
 The rest of the time is spent adding reinforcements 

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:45.966
 For the tunnel wall. 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.190
 So if you design the machine 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.540
 To drill and reinforce continuously; 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.800
 Doing this will cut your cost in half. 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.136
 Add it to the above and you will reach the price. 

00:04:55.136 --> 00:04:59.786
 Also, the machines will be far from reaching their maximum energy and thermal limits, 

00:04:59.786 --> 00:05:02.790
 So you can greatly increase the machine power. 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.916
 I think you can cut the cost by at least half and maybe a quarter or a half, 

00:05:07.916 --> 00:05:09.246
 In addition to the above. 

00:05:09.246 --> 00:05:13.476
 So I think there are a number of direct steps enough 

00:05:13.476 --> 00:05:16.240
 To reach a value less than one tenth 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.226
 From the cost of digging a mile, 

00:05:18.226 --> 00:05:21.136
 Our goal now is ... 

00:05:21.136 --> 00:05:23.890
 We have a pet snail called "Gary," 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.626
 It's Gary the Snail from the South Park series, 

00:05:26.626 --> 00:05:29.846
 Sorry, I mean, "SpongeBob SquarePants". 

00:05:29.846 --> 00:05:31.096
 (Laughter) 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.526
 Gary can ... 

00:05:35.526 --> 00:05:39.636
 Currently it can walk 14 times faster 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.536
 From the tunnel boring machine. 

00:05:41.536 --> 00:05:44.236
 (Laughter) 

00:05:44.236 --> 00:05:46.030
 You want to defeat Gary. 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.596
 We want to defeat Gary. 

00:05:47.596 --> 00:05:48.926
 (Laughter) 

00:05:48.926 --> 00:05:51.156
 It is an impatient boy, 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.306
 This will make it a victory. 

00:05:54.306 --> 00:05:56.230
 Victory is the defeat of the snail. 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.150
 But many who imagine and dream about the cities of the future, 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.206
 They think the solution is flying cars, drones ... etc. 

00:06:04.206 --> 00:06:06.300
 To go above the ground. 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.150
 Why isn't this a better solution? 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.186
 You will save all the costs of digging the tunnels. 

00:06:10.186 --> 00:06:12.416
 Right, I prefer flying things. 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.336
 I clearly manufacture the missiles; So I love things that fly. 

00:06:16.336 --> 00:06:19.326
 This is not a subjective bias against flying objects, 

00:06:19.326 --> 00:06:22.336
 But there is a challenge facing flying cars 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.666
 Which is that it would be very annoying, 

00:06:25.666 --> 00:06:29.120
 And that the wind loads generated will be very high. 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.546
 Let's just say that something is flying over your head, 

00:06:34.546 --> 00:06:38.260
 That a group of cars is flying overhead, 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.926
 This will not be a reassuring situation. 

00:06:42.926 --> 00:06:44.220
 (Laughter) 

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.440
 You wouldn't say to yourself, "Okay, I have a better feeling about this day." 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.126
 You will even ask, "Did they maintain the wheel covers, 

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:55.916
 Or will it fly and cut off my head? " 

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:57.680
 things like that. 

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:01.756
 So you have that vision 

00:07:01.756 --> 00:07:07.076
 For future cities where these dense three-dimensional networks of tunnels are located beneath them. 

00:07:07.076 --> 00:07:09.096
 Does this have anything to do with Hyperloop? 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.630
 Can you use these tunnels to achieve the idea of ​​Hyperloop? 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:14.731
 That I announced a few years ago. 

00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:17.860
 Well, we were kind of having fun 

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.486
 On the topic of hyperlinks for a while. 

00:07:20.486 --> 00:07:24.376
 We built a hyperlink demo next to SpaceX; 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:26.510
 For student competition only; 

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.576
 To encourage innovative ideas in transport. 

00:07:29.576 --> 00:07:34.806
 In fact, he ended up becoming the largest vacuum chamber in the world 

00:07:34.806 --> 00:07:36.970
 After the Large Hadron Collider 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.880
 according to size. 

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.636
 It was very fun to do, but it was like a hobby, 

00:07:46.636 --> 00:07:50.626
 Then we thought we might ... 

00:07:50.628 --> 00:07:54.650
 We built a small driving car to drive student capsules, 

00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.286
 We will try to determine the speed with which we can make the driving car 

00:08:00.286 --> 00:08:01.829
 When you pay nothing. 

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.800
 So we are cautiously optimistic 

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.946
 We will be able to make it faster than the world's fastest "bullet train" 

00:08:09.946 --> 00:08:13.686
 Even in the 0.8 mile range. 

00:08:13.686 --> 00:08:14.796
 Good brakes. 

00:08:14.796 --> 00:08:17.010
 Yes, it is. 

00:08:17.010 --> 00:08:21.620
 Either it will smash into small pieces or go too fast. 

00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:25.270
 But you can imagine Hyperloop inside a tunnel 

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.146
 Go very long distances. 

00:08:27.146 --> 00:08:28.830
 exactly. 

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:30.716
 Looking at the tunnel technology, 

00:08:30.716 --> 00:08:33.226
 Turns out to be a tunnel, 

00:08:33.226 --> 00:08:34.420
 You should.. 

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.566
 In order to isolate it against the groundwater table, 

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:43.200
 You will usually have to design a tunnel wall to withstand it 

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.810
 About 5 or 6 times the atmospheric pressure. 

00:08:47.009 --> 00:08:50.006
 Reaching the void means one air pressure, 

00:08:50.006 --> 00:08:51.466
 Or close to emptiness. 

00:08:51.466 --> 00:08:55.876
 In fact, it turns out to be automatic, 

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:59.896
 If you create a tunnel well enough to resist the water table, 

00:08:59.896 --> 00:09:02.436
 It will automatically be able to withstand discharge. 

00:09:02.436 --> 00:09:03.950
 OK. 

00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:05.480
 So, yes. 

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.426
 So you really are able to visualize 

00:09:07.426 --> 00:09:13.116
 How long does Elon need in the future to operate the Hyperloop? 

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.350
 I think there is no maximum length. 

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:19.380
 You can dig as much as you want. 

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.650
 I think if you want to do something 

00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:26.670
 Like Hyperloop from Washington to New York, 

00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:29.210
 You would often prefer the entire path to be underground. 

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.350
 Because it is a high density area. 

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:35.420
 You will pass under a lot of buildings and houses, 

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.146
 And if you dig deep enough, 

00:09:37.146 --> 00:09:39.210
 You will not be able to spot the tunnel. 

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:42.330
 Sometimes people think, it will be very annoying 

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.296
 There is a tunnel dug under their homes. 

00:09:44.296 --> 00:09:45.590
 If this tunnel is dug 

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.886
 3 or 4 times the diameter of the tunnel under your home, 

00:09:48.886 --> 00:09:52.660
 You will not be able to detect it during drilling at all. 

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:58.750
 In fact, if you can monitor the tunnel while digging it, 

00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.940
 Whatever device you use, 

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:04.200
 You can get a lot of money in exchange for it from the Israeli army, 

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.326
 Who tries to monitor the tunnels of Hamas, 

00:10:07.326 --> 00:10:12.296
 And from the US Customs and Border Protection that is trying to monitor drug smuggling tunnels. 

00:10:12.296 --> 00:10:15.490
 So the reality is 

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:19.340
 That the Earth is incredibly good at absorbing vibrations, 

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.416
 Once the tunnel depth is below a certain level, 

00:10:22.416 --> 00:10:24.060
 It becomes unrecoverable. 

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.950
 Maybe if you have a very sensitive seismic device, 

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.540
 You may be able to monitor it. 

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:31.516
 She founded a new company to do so 

00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:33.236
 It is called the Drilling Company. 

00:10:33.236 --> 00:10:35.216
 Very good, very funny. 

00:10:35.216 --> 00:10:36.560
 (Laughter) 

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:38.156
 What's so funny about it? 

00:10:38.156 --> 00:10:40.746
 (Laughter) 

00:10:40.746 --> 00:10:42.670
 How long does this take your time? 

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.540
 Probably.. 

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:48.750
 2 or 3 percent. 

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:50.550
 I bought a hobby. 

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:53.356
 This is what Elon Musk's hobbies look like. 

00:10:53.356 --> 00:10:54.386
 (Laughter) 

00:10:54.386 --> 00:10:56.876
 It really is, for example ... 

00:10:56.876 --> 00:11:02.010
 Basically it is the trainees and people who work part-time. 

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.866
 We bought some used machines. 

00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:11.210
 It's kinda fun, but it's making good progress. 

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:13.500
 So there is a greater part of your time 

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.310
 You spend it on cars and electric transport through Tesla. 

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:21.866
 Is one of the motives of the tunnels project 

00:11:21.866 --> 00:11:24.370
 Is to realize that in reality, 

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:27.860
 In a world where cars are electric and self-driving, 

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.320
 It may lead to more cars on the road 

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.936
 What time is it compared to the current time? 

00:11:33.936 --> 00:11:35.740
 Yes, exactly. 

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:42.186
 Many people think that when cars are self-driving, 

00:11:42.186 --> 00:11:46.816
 It will be faster and this will reduce traffic congestion 

00:11:46.816 --> 00:11:48.680
 This is true to some degree. 

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.886
 But once shared autonomous driving is available, it is much cheaper to drive by car, 

00:11:53.886 --> 00:11:56.830
 And you can move from one point to another, 

00:11:56.830 --> 00:12:01.910
 The cost of transportation by car will be better than the cost of transport by bus. 

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.266
 It will cost less than a bus ticket. 

00:12:04.266 --> 00:12:09.286
 Therefore, driving rates will become much higher in the presence of shared self-driving, 

00:12:09.286 --> 00:12:12.166
 In fact, traffic will get worse. 

00:12:12.166 --> 00:12:16.380
 You founded Tesla with the goal of convincing the world 

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:19.506
 That electric power is the future of cars, 

00:12:19.506 --> 00:12:22.066
 A few years ago, people were making fun of you. 

00:12:22.066 --> 00:12:24.466
 Now, not much. 

00:12:24.466 --> 00:12:25.706
 OK. 

00:12:25.706 --> 00:12:27.676
 (Laughter) 

00:12:27.676 --> 00:12:29.870
 I do not know. I do not know. 

00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:33.300
 But isn't it true that almost all auto manufacturers 

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.426
 They have announced serious plans to rely on electricity 

00:12:36.426 --> 00:12:38.860
 In the near and medium future. 

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.020
 Yes. Yes. 

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:47.970
 I think all auto manufacturers have a program for electric vehicles. 

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:49.436
 They differ in how serious they are. 

00:12:49.436 --> 00:12:53.716
 Some are very serious about completely switching to electricity. 

00:12:53.716 --> 00:12:56.060
 Some of them just have fun. 

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.546
 And some still surprisingly support fuel cells, 

00:12:59.546 --> 00:13:01.706
 But I think that will not last long. 

00:13:01.706 --> 00:13:03.796
 But doesn't it make sense, Elon? 

00:13:03.796 --> 00:13:07.516
 Now simply declare your victory, and say "We have done it." 

00:13:07.516 --> 00:13:12.360
 And you let the world go to electricity, and you go to focus on other things? 

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:14.540
 OK. 

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.746
 I intend to stay in Tesla in the future as much as I can imagine. 

00:13:20.746 --> 00:13:25.230
 There are many exciting things that we will release. 

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.706
 It is clear that "Model 3" will be launched soon. 

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:31.020
 We will unveil the Tesla Half Truck. 

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.906
 Well, we'll mention that. 

00:13:33.906 --> 00:13:38.870
 “Model 3” is slated to launch around July. 

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:43.476
 Yes, it seems very appropriate that we start production in July. 

00:13:43.476 --> 00:13:44.866
 Fabulous. 

00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:47.346
 One of the things people get excited about 

00:13:47.346 --> 00:13:50.460
 It is having an automatic driving mode in it. 

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.840
 You posted this video a while ago 

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:58.190
 Explain what this technology will look like. 

00:13:58.190 --> 00:13:58.900
 Yes. 

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:02.026
 Obviously, there is an auto driving mode on the “S Model” now. 

00:14:02.026 --> 00:14:03.406
 What do we see here? 

00:14:03.406 --> 00:14:09.310
 This is done using cameras and GPS only 

00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:12.006
 There are no "ledar" or radar systems used here. 

00:14:12.006 --> 00:14:17.020
 This is done only using the "passive optical network," which is what people mainly use. 

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:19.526
 The entire road is explored 

00:14:19.526 --> 00:14:23.616
 By using "passive optical network" or cameras, 

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.986
 As soon as you process the cameras data 

00:14:26.986 --> 00:14:28.220
 Or vision, 

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:31.056
 Automated driving becomes possible. 

00:14:31.056 --> 00:14:34.050
 If you cannot handle the vision, it will not be possible. 

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:39.950
 So our focus is very much on getting a neural vision network 

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:43.170
 Very effective for road conditions. 

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.580
 Many others tend to use "Lidar". 

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.710
 All you need are cameras and radar. 

00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:52.176
 You can undoubtedly be super using only cameras. 

00:14:52.176 --> 00:14:55.046
 You can probably be ten times better than humans, 

00:14:55.046 --> 00:14:56.170
 Only with cameras. 

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:00.910
 Cars currently sold with 8 cameras. 

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:05.306
 She cannot do what is shown here yet. 

00:15:05.306 --> 00:15:07.300
 When will you be able to? 

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.996
 I think we are still on the right path to make it able to walk across the country 

00:15:13.996 --> 00:15:18.422
 From Los Angeles to New York at the end of the year, fully automated driving. 

00:15:18.422 --> 00:15:21.970
 Well then you're saying that by the end of the year, 

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:26.036
 Someone will sit in a Tesla car without touching the wheel, 

00:15:26.036 --> 00:15:28.546
 Then click on New York and then go. 

00:15:28.546 --> 00:15:29.280
 Yes. 

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.980
 He will never need to touch the wheel ... by the end of 2017. 

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:38.700
 Yes. Basically, in November or December this year, 

00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.140
 We should be able to block the road from a California parking lot 

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.956
 To a parking lot in New York, 

00:15:44.956 --> 00:15:48.030
 Without any directions at any point during the trip. 

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.666
 (clap) 

00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:51.600
 just awesome. 

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:53.346
 But part of that is possible. 

00:15:53.346 --> 00:15:56.936
 Because you already have a fleet of Tesla cars that travels all of these roads. 

00:15:56.936 --> 00:16:01.790
 It collects a huge amount of data on the local road system. 

00:16:03.260 --> 00:16:05.946
 Yeah, but what might sound exciting 

00:16:05.946 --> 00:16:11.080
 Is that I am really very confident that she can go this way, 

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.710
 Even if you use variable paths on this path. 

00:16:16.710 --> 00:16:19.060
 Very easy .. 

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.626
 If you can be very good on a specific track then this is another matter. 

00:16:23.626 --> 00:16:28.630
 But she must be able to walk very efficiently, 

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:30.646
 Especially when you're on the highway, 

00:16:30.646 --> 00:16:33.456
 To go anywhere on the highway network 

00:16:33.456 --> 00:16:34.720
 In a specific country. 

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:38.576
 So this is not limited to Los Angeles Road to New York 

00:16:38.576 --> 00:16:41.676
 We can change it from Seattle to Florida, 

00:16:41.676 --> 00:16:44.200
 On this day, at a certain time. 

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.506
 For example, you would go from Los Angeles to New York. 

00:16:46.506 --> 00:16:49.590
 Now she goes from Los Angeles to Toronto. 

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.870
 If we leave the rules aside for some time, 

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.696
 From a technical point of view only, 

00:16:55.696 --> 00:16:59.546
 The time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars, 

00:16:59.546 --> 00:17:03.386
 He literally leaves the wheel and sleeps 

00:17:03.386 --> 00:17:05.370
 Then he wakes up to find that he has arrived. 

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:07.180
 When will this be done safely? 

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.706
 I think it will happen in two years. 

00:17:09.706 --> 00:17:13.076
 The real challenge is not in your ability to make it work 

00:17:13.076 --> 00:17:16.061
 On 99.9 percent of the time. 

00:17:16.061 --> 00:17:20.159
 Because if a car collision occurs a thousand times, 

00:17:20.159 --> 00:17:24.156
 You will often remain restless. 

00:17:27.340 --> 00:17:29.170
 And of course you don't have to. 

00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:30.360
 (Laughter) 

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:34.720
 It will never be perfect. 

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.510
 There is no ideal system, 

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.139
 But if we say that maybe ... 

00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.786
 Car collision is highly unlikely 

00:17:42.786 --> 00:17:46.220
 In a hundred lives, or a thousand lives, 

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.226
 People will say "Okay, great, if I could live a thousand lives, 

00:17:50.226 --> 00:17:52.796
 I often won't have any accident, 

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.326
 This is often OK. " 

00:17:54.326 --> 00:17:55.436
 you, sleep. 

00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.366
 I guess what's most worrisome to you is that people are maybe 

00:17:58.366 --> 00:18:00.636
 Too early they think it's safe, 

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.190
 And that a horrific accident might delay things. 

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:11.266
 Well, I think the self-driving system is likely to mitigate the collision at least, 

00:18:11.266 --> 00:18:12.870
 Except in rare circumstances. 

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:16.546
 The thing to be aware of about vehicle safety 

00:18:16.546 --> 00:18:19.820
 Is that this is a possibility. 

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.226
 There is a possibility every time a person drives a car 

00:18:24.226 --> 00:18:27.186
 A collision occurs due to an error. 

00:18:27.186 --> 00:18:28.500
 It is never zero. 

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:33.656
 The primary approach to self-reliance is 

00:18:33.656 --> 00:18:38.086
 Knowing the extent to which self-driving must be superior to humans 

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:39.470
 Before you depend on it. 

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:42.996
 But once you have achieved safe driving literally without using hands, 

00:18:42.996 --> 00:18:45.796
 The potential for confusion to the industry appears enormous; 

00:18:45.796 --> 00:18:50.156
 Because at that time, as I said, people will be able to buy a car, 

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.426
 It takes you to work, then lets it go 

00:18:52.426 --> 00:18:56.270
 To work in services like Uber for other people, 

00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:57.360
 Make money for you, 

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.830
 It may cover the purchase price of the car. 

00:18:59.830 --> 00:19:01.830
 So you can almost like a car for free. 

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:03.190
 Is this really possible? 

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:05.990
 Yes, that will undoubtedly happen. 

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.196
 There will be a self-driving fleet to share 

00:19:08.196 --> 00:19:09.456
 Where to buy your car 

00:19:09.456 --> 00:19:12.816
 You can choose to use the car alone, 

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:16.726
 Or you choose to only use it by your friends and family, 

00:19:16.726 --> 00:19:21.590
 Or only by other 5-star drivers, 

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:26.500
 You can share it sometimes and not at other times. 

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.230
 This is what will happen 100%. 

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:32.641
 It is only a matter of time. 

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:34.690
 just awesome. 

00:19:34.690 --> 00:19:37.170
 So, you mentioned the midterm 

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:39.490
 And I think you plan to announce it in September, 

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:43.146
 But I wonder if there is anything you can offer us today? 

00:19:43.146 --> 00:19:46.996
 I'm going to show you a truck teaser. 

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.546
 (Laughter) 

00:19:49.546 --> 00:19:51.496
 She is alive. 

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.580
 OK. 

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.790
 This is definitely a case where caution is required 

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:57.654
 From disclosing the features of self-driving. 

00:19:58.184 --> 00:19:59.426
 Yes. 

00:19:59.426 --> 00:20:00.730
 (Laughter) 

00:20:00.730 --> 00:20:02.460
 We can't see much. 

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.780
 But it does not look like a small friendly truck for residential neighborhoods. 

00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:07.276
 Sounds somewhat hostile. 

00:20:07.276 --> 00:20:10.380
 What kind of semi truck are you? 

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.566
 This is a high potential and long range semi truck. 

00:20:15.566 --> 00:20:19.836
 So it has the highest load capacity 

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.930
 In addition to a long walk. 

00:20:22.930 --> 00:20:28.380
 The main goal is to reduce heavy loads. 

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:34.360
 This is something that people currently believe is not possible. 

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.140
 They think that the truck does not have enough power or it does not have enough range, 

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.700
 And by Tesla midway truck, 

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.436
 We want to show them that this is wrong, as the electric truck 

00:20:43.436 --> 00:20:49.466
 In fact, it can generate more torque than any semi-diesel truck. 

00:20:49.466 --> 00:20:53.626
 If you do a tug of war, 

00:20:53.626 --> 00:20:58.846
 Tesla's semitrailer pulls the diesel truck up a ramp. 

00:20:58.846 --> 00:21:00.996
 (Laughter) 

00:21:00.996 --> 00:21:02.820
 (clap) 

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.126
 This is so cool. In the short term, this is not self-driving. 

00:21:06.126 --> 00:21:09.650
 Rather, they will be trucks that truck drivers drive. 

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:12.956
 Yes, what would be fun about her 

00:21:12.956 --> 00:21:18.260
 The presence of a flat curve between the torque and the number of turns per minute, in the presence of an electric motor, 

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.886
 While in the presence of a diesel engine or any car powered by an internal combustion engine 

00:21:21.886 --> 00:21:24.890
 You will get a hill curve. 

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:28.610
 So it will be a very graceful truck. 

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:31.466
 You can drive it like a sports car. 

00:21:31.466 --> 00:21:33.850
 There is no transmission. As if it is a single speed. 

00:21:33.850 --> 00:21:36.170
 A great movie about that will be made somewhere. 

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.580
 I don’t know what it is or will end well, 

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.590
 But it's a great movie. 

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:40.560
 (Laughter) 

00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:44.226
 Her driving test was very strange. 

00:21:44.226 --> 00:21:48.210
 When I was driving the prototype of the first truck. 

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:50.546
 That was really weird, because you drive 

00:21:50.546 --> 00:21:53.676
 With great craftsmanship, you are in a huge truck. 

00:21:53.676 --> 00:21:57.130
 Wait, did you drive a model earlier? 

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:59.210
 Yes, I drove it around the car park, 

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:00.520
 That was crazy. 

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:02.940
 Fabulous. This is not fiction. 

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.156
 I was driving that huge truck, 

00:22:05.156 --> 00:22:07.040
 And I'm doing crazy maneuvers. 

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.666
 that's cool. Well, let's go from a very aggressive picture 

00:22:09.666 --> 00:22:12.120
 To a somewhat less hostile picture. 

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:16.946
 This is just a nice house from the series "Desperate Housewives" or something like that. 

00:22:16.946 --> 00:22:18.610
 What is going on here? 

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.660
 Well, that shows a picture of the future 

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:24.110
 To which I think things will evolve. 

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:26.496
 There is an electric car in the corridor. 

00:22:26.496 --> 00:22:30.266
 If you look between the electric car and the house; 

00:22:30.266 --> 00:22:34.126
 There are 3 wall batteries hanging on the side of the house, 

00:22:34.126 --> 00:22:36.926
 Then there is the roof of the house, which is a solar roof 

00:22:36.926 --> 00:22:39.256
 That is, it is a true solar panel roof. 

00:22:39.256 --> 00:22:40.310
 OK. 

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.626
 This is a picture of a real house, in fact, it is a real fake house. 

00:22:44.626 --> 00:22:46.446
 This is a real fake house. 

00:22:46.446 --> 00:22:49.406
 (Laughter) 

00:22:49.406 --> 00:22:51.306
 So these roof panels, 

00:22:51.306 --> 00:22:57.450
 Some of them actually have solar energy, the ability to ... 

00:22:57.450 --> 00:22:59.276
 Yes, solar panels 

00:22:59.276 --> 00:23:04.280
 You can adjust its style and color 

00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:06.306
 Up to a very subtle level, 

00:23:06.306 --> 00:23:11.896
 There are also very small holes in the glass, 

00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.300
 So that if you look at the ceiling from street level 

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.106
 Or close to street level, 

00:23:17.106 --> 00:23:19.470
 All panels look the same 

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:24.580
 Whether there is a solar cell under it or not. 

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:29.220
 So you see a regular color 

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.750
 When you look from the ground level. 

00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:34.460
 If you look at it from a helicopter, 

00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.446
 You will really be able to look through it and see 

00:23:36.446 --> 00:23:41.210
 Some solar panels have a solar cell underneath, and some do not. 

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:42.806
 You wouldn't know that from street level. 

00:23:42.806 --> 00:23:45.280
 You put it in the panels exposed to most sunlight, 

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.280
 Which makes the plate prices reasonable, right? 

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:50.790
 It wouldn't be much more expensive than just a regular roof. 

00:23:50.790 --> 00:23:52.660
 Yes. 

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:56.260
 We are sure to cost the roof 

00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:59.980
 In addition to the cost of electricity .. 

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.520
 Roof solar panels will be less expensive than normal roof 

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:06.156
 Plus the cost of electricity. 

00:24:06.156 --> 00:24:07.396
 In other words, 

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.680
 It would be easy economically, 

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:13.616
 We think it will look great, 

00:24:13.616 --> 00:24:15.630
 It will last .. 

00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:18.670
 We thought to make the guarantee endless, 

00:24:18.670 --> 00:24:19.890
 But people thought 

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:23.046
 That might sound like we're talking nonsense. 

00:24:23.046 --> 00:24:28.210
 But in fact, this is toughened glass. 

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.136
 After the house collapses, 

00:24:31.136 --> 00:24:33.046
 And nothing remains, 

00:24:33.046 --> 00:24:36.626
 The glass panels will remain intact. 

00:24:36.626 --> 00:24:38.146
 (clap) 

00:24:38.146 --> 00:24:39.986
 I mean, that's cool. 

00:24:39.986 --> 00:24:42.850
 I'm going to release this in two weeks, I think, 

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.416
 Four different types of ceilings. 

00:24:45.416 --> 00:24:47.950
 Yes, we will start by issuing two types, initially, 

00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:51.316
 The other two will be issued early next year. 

00:24:51.316 --> 00:24:53.210
 How big are your ambitions? 

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:58.780
 How many homes do you think may become covered with this type of roof? 

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.820
 I think at the end of the day, 

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:06.020
 Almost all homes will have sun roofs. 

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.256
 What needs to be taken into consideration is the timeframe 

00:25:11.256 --> 00:25:13.736
 Which will often be around 

00:25:13.736 --> 00:25:16.946
 40 or 50 years old. 

00:25:16.946 --> 00:25:21.820
 On average, the roof is replaced every 20 to 25 years. 

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:26.396
 But you do not start to replace all ceilings immediately. 

00:25:26.396 --> 00:25:30.056
 But in the end, if we can speed things up 

00:25:30.056 --> 00:25:33.416
 Almost 15 years from now. 

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:37.660
 It would be uncommon to have a roof with no solar cells. 

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.556
 Is there something that people can't understand about this? 

00:25:40.556 --> 00:25:45.666
 Because of the change in cost, and financial matters related to solar energy, 

00:25:45.666 --> 00:25:49.020
 Most homes already have enough light for their roofs 

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.276
 To cover almost all of their energy needs. 

00:25:51.276 --> 00:25:53.086
 If you can catch the energy, 

00:25:53.086 --> 00:25:55.206
 It will cover almost all of their energy needs. 

00:25:55.206 --> 00:25:56.606
 Electricity grid may be left. 

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:58.270
 It depends on where you are, 

00:25:58.270 --> 00:26:01.576
 And the size of the house relative to the roof area, 

00:26:01.576 --> 00:26:03.456
 But it is acceptable to say 

00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:08.270
 Most homes in the U.S. have enough roof space 

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:11.140
 To provide all the energy needs of the home. 

00:26:11.620 --> 00:26:14.810
 So, the decisive factor in an economy 

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:18.846
 Cars, semi trucks, and those homes 

00:26:18.846 --> 00:26:22.700
 Is the low price of lithium-ion batteries, 

00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:25.260
 This is what you bet on Tesla. 

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:27.926
 In many ways, this is often the center of your strength. 

00:26:27.926 --> 00:26:29.856
 You have decided 

00:26:29.856 --> 00:26:35.076
 That you are to maintain that strength; 

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.530
 You must build the largest factory in the world 

00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:41.796
 To double the global production of lithium-ion batteries, 

00:26:41.796 --> 00:26:44.036
 By this boy. What is that? 

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.520
 Yeah, this is Gigafactory, 

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.256
 What the plant "Gigafactory" reached. 

00:26:50.256 --> 00:26:52.166
 In the end, you will be able to see 

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.146
 Something like a diamond 

00:26:55.146 --> 00:26:59.766
 And when it's complete, it will look like a giant pit, 

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:01.870
 Or this is the idea behind it, 

00:27:01.870 --> 00:27:03.456
 It is aligned with the true North. 

00:27:03.456 --> 00:27:05.286
 This is one of the small details. 

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:09.200
 Will be able to produce, upon its completion, 

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.360
 About 100 GWh of batteries per year 

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.966
 100 GWh. And maybe more, but yeah. 

00:27:14.966 --> 00:27:16.740
 They are already being produced now. 

00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:20.090
 They are already produced. - You posted this video. 

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:22.200
 Was it accelerated? 

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.146
 This is the lazy version. 

00:27:24.146 --> 00:27:25.896
 (Laughter) 

00:27:25.896 --> 00:27:28.256
 How fast is he actually? 

00:27:28.256 --> 00:27:31.076
 When it is running at top speed; 

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:35.030
 You cannot see cells without flashing. 

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:36.360
 Just something blurry. 

00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.816
 (Laughter) 

00:27:39.816 --> 00:27:43.406
 One of your basic ideas about what will make the future exciting 

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:47.300
 Is to have a future where we don't feel guilty about energy. 

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.746
 Help us visualize this. 

00:27:48.746 --> 00:27:53.766
 How many "Gigafactory" factories are needed to get there? 

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.526
 About a hundred, approximately. 

00:27:55.526 --> 00:27:57.286
 Not 10, not 1000. 

00:27:57.290 --> 00:27:58.910
 So probably 100. 

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.510
 I see it's amazing 

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:05.580
 That you can imagine what it takes 

00:28:05.580 --> 00:28:08.916
 To keep the world away from the massive use of fossil fuels. 

00:28:08.916 --> 00:28:11.360
 You build one, 

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.190
 Its cost is 5 billion dollars 

00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:16.536
 Next may cost 5 to 10 billion dollars. 

00:28:16.536 --> 00:28:20.076
 It's great that you can imagine this project. 

00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.300
 You are planning in Tesla to announce other manufacturers this year. 

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.156
 I think we will announce sites 

00:28:28.156 --> 00:28:32.026
 Between two to four "Gigafactory" later this year. 

00:28:32.026 --> 00:28:33.380
 Yes, often four. 

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:35.496
 Fabulous. 

00:28:35.496 --> 00:28:38.116
 (clap) 

00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.236
 Are there no more teasers for us about that? 

00:28:42.236 --> 00:28:45.020
 For example, where? which continent? 

00:28:47.300 --> 00:28:49.250
 You can answer no. 

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:53.066
 We must head to the global market. 

00:28:53.066 --> 00:28:54.316
 OK. 

00:28:54.316 --> 00:28:55.650
 (Laughter) 

00:28:55.650 --> 00:28:56.860
 that's cool. 

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.540
 I think we should talk about .. 

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:06.026
 In fact, this is important. 

00:29:06.026 --> 00:29:10.130
 And so I'm going to ask you one question in politics, just one. 

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.906
 I kind of got bored of politics, but I'd like to ask you this. 

00:29:13.906 --> 00:29:19.776
 You have given advice to a person ... 

00:29:19.776 --> 00:29:21.000
 who is he? 

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.890
 He said he does not believe in climate change, 

00:29:23.890 --> 00:29:28.290
 There are many people who think that you should not have. 

00:29:28.290 --> 00:29:30.226
 They would like to stay away from that. 

00:29:30.226 --> 00:29:31.510
 What do you say to them? 

00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:36.140
 Well, first, 

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.720
 I am a member of only two advisory councils, 

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.576
 Their goal is to walk around the room 

00:29:41.576 --> 00:29:44.486
 And inquire about people's opinions on some things. 

00:29:44.486 --> 00:29:48.370
 Therefore, a meeting is held approximately every one or two months. 

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.536
 This is my total contributions. 

00:29:52.536 --> 00:29:55.396
 But I think that as there are people in the meetings 

00:29:55.396 --> 00:30:00.166
 They call to do something about climate change, 

00:30:00.166 --> 00:30:04.180
 Or about social issues. 

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:09.550
 I took advantage of the meetings that I have attended so far 

00:30:09.550 --> 00:30:14.486
 In the interest of defending migration and climate change. 

00:30:14.486 --> 00:30:16.390
 (clap) 

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.510
 If I don't do that, 

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:21.356
 This was not on the agenda before. 

00:30:21.356 --> 00:30:25.870
 Perhaps nothing will happen, but I have said at least what needs to be said. 

00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:27.746
 OK. 

00:30:27.746 --> 00:30:30.620
 (clap) 

00:30:31.620 --> 00:30:35.150
 Let's talk about CibsX and Mars. 

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:36.646
 The last time you were here, 

00:30:36.646 --> 00:30:40.366
 She talked about something that looked like an incredibly ambitious dream 

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:44.686
 It is the development of reusable missiles. 

00:30:44.686 --> 00:30:46.740
 You went and did it. 

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:48.466
 Finally, it took a long time. 

00:30:48.466 --> 00:30:50.560
 Tell us about this. What do we see here? 

00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.256
 This is one of our missile boosters 

00:30:53.256 --> 00:30:57.866
 It returns from a very high altitude and quickly into space. 

00:30:57.866 --> 00:31:01.206
 He just pushed the upper stage of the missile 

00:31:01.206 --> 00:31:03.200
 Very quickly. 

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.236
 I think his speed might have been about 7 times the speed of sound, 

00:31:07.236 --> 00:31:09.100
 Pay the upper stage. 

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.700
 (clap) 

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.170
 It was accelerated .. 

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.046
 This was the slow version. 

00:31:17.046 --> 00:31:18.386
 (Laughter) 

00:31:18.386 --> 00:31:20.860
 I thought it was the quick version. 

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:22.250
 But this is awesome, 

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:23.636
 Many of these failed 

00:31:23.636 --> 00:31:26.586
 Before you finally know how to do this, 

00:31:26.586 --> 00:31:29.350
 But now you do this 5, 6 or more times? 

00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:31.810
 I think we have come 8 or 9 times. 

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:33.420
 And for the first time, 

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:36.696
 You have already managed to fire one of the missiles that landed. 

00:31:36.696 --> 00:31:39.340
 Yes, the booster booster landed, 

00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.046
 Then we prepared it to fly again, then we fired it again, 

00:31:42.046 --> 00:31:47.100
 So this is the first time that a space explorer has made a second trip 

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:49.256
 The two flights were connected. 

00:31:49.256 --> 00:31:52.596
 It is very important to realize that reuse is not connected 

00:31:52.596 --> 00:31:56.100
 Unless it is fast and complete. 

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.496
 Like a plane or a car, 

00:32:00.496 --> 00:32:02.916
 Reuse is quick and complete. 

00:32:02.916 --> 00:32:07.956
 You do not send your plane to Boeing between flights. 

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.810
 True. This allowed you to dream of a very ambitious idea 

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.980
 It is sending many, many people to Mars 

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.446
 In 10 to 20 years, I think. 

00:32:18.446 --> 00:32:19.846
 Yes. 

00:32:19.846 --> 00:32:23.260
 And you designed a massive rocket to do that. 

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:25.746
 Help us realize the size of this thing. 

00:32:25.746 --> 00:32:30.620
 Well, visually, you can see a person. 

00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.366
 Yes, and this is the vehicle. 

00:32:34.366 --> 00:32:35.980
 (Laughter) 

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.740
 If that was a skyscraper, 

00:32:37.740 --> 00:32:41.286
 It would almost be, right, a 40-storey skyscraper? 

00:32:41.286 --> 00:32:43.590
 And maybe a little more, yes 

00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:48.180
 In fact, his momentum is .. 

00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:55.100
 This design has about 4 times the thrust of the "Saturn 5" missile. 

00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:01.146
 Four times the thrust of the largest human-made missile. 

00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:02.340
 Yes. Yes. 

00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:05.926
 - As usual. - Yes. 

00:33:05.926 --> 00:33:08.916
 (Laughter) 

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:14.910
 Compared to the 747, the 747 has a momentum of nearly a quarter of a million pounds. 

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:18.050
 That is, for every 10 million pounds of momentum 

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.766
 There are 40 aircraft 747. 

00:33:19.766 --> 00:33:26.046
 That is, it will equal the thrust of 120 747s while all their engines are running. 

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:30.220
 Even with a machine designed to escape from gravity, 

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:31.746
 I thought you told me last time 

00:33:31.746 --> 00:33:35.096
 This thing can carry a fully loaded 747, 

00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:37.366
 People and merchandise, everything 

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:38.666
 Into orbit. 

00:33:38.666 --> 00:33:43.796
 exactly. It can carry a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel capacity, 

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.336
 The maximum number of passengers and the maximum cargo load for a 747 .. 

00:33:48.336 --> 00:33:50.900
 He can carry it as if it were goods. 

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:53.650
 So based on this, 

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:58.480
 You recently introduced the interplanetary system, 

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.860
 And that is how it was imagined. 

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:06.010
 When do you imagine this scene, after 30 years? 20 years? 

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.306
 For people to enter this missile. 

00:34:09.306 --> 00:34:13.886
 I hope this will be in 8 to 10 years. 

00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:16.286
 Hopefully, this is our goal. 

00:34:16.286 --> 00:34:19.486
 Our own ambitions are exaggerated, but I think .. 

00:34:19.486 --> 00:34:21.499
 (Laughter) 

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.580
 OK. 

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.856
 Although this vehicle looks very bulky 

00:34:26.856 --> 00:34:29.066
 Huge compared to other missiles; 

00:34:29.066 --> 00:34:32.996
 But I think the future spacecraft 

00:34:32.999 --> 00:34:36.860
 This will make it look like a rowing boat. 

00:34:38.140 --> 00:34:42.836
 Future spacecraft will be truly enormous. 

00:34:42.836 --> 00:34:45.049
 Why, Elon? 

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:49.200
 Why do we need to build a city on Mars 

00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.290
 With a million people in your life, 

00:34:52.290 --> 00:34:55.300
 I think you said you would like to do this? 

00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.319
 I think it is important that we have 

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.706
 An inspiring and attractive future. 

00:35:03.706 --> 00:35:06.516
 I think there should be reasons 

00:35:06.516 --> 00:35:09.400
 To wake up in the morning and want to live. 

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.930
 Meaning, why do you want to live? 

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.726
 What is the idea? What inspires you? 

00:35:12.726 --> 00:35:14.586
 What do you like about the future? 

00:35:14.586 --> 00:35:16.120
 And if we weren't there, 

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.090
 If the future does not include our interstellar existence 

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.886
 To become a multi-planet species, 

00:35:21.886 --> 00:35:24.396
 I consider it very frustrating 

00:35:24.396 --> 00:35:27.846
 That is not the future we get. 

00:35:27.846 --> 00:35:31.936
 (clap) 

00:35:31.936 --> 00:35:34.250
 People just want to make a choice, 

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:38.106
 Because there are so many bad things happening on the planet right now 

00:35:38.106 --> 00:35:42.290
 From climate to poverty, you know, choose from many, 

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:44.750
 This looks like distraction. 

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.420
 You shouldn't be thinking about this. 

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:48.906
 It should solve what is here and now. 

00:35:48.906 --> 00:35:52.056
 To be fair, you really did a good job of doing that 

00:35:52.056 --> 00:35:54.716
 Through your work in the field of renewable energy. 

00:35:54.716 --> 00:35:57.270
 But why not just do that? 

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:01.260
 I think there is .. 

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:09.116
 I look to the future in terms of possibilities. 

00:36:09.116 --> 00:36:13.296
 Sounds like a stream of possibilities. 

00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:18.300
 There are actions we can take that affect these possibilities 

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.100
 Or hasten or delay something else. 

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.150
 Perhaps something new has been added to the stream of possibilities. 

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.650
 Sustainable energy will inevitably happen. 

00:36:32.650 --> 00:36:35.386
 If there is no Tesla, if there is never Tesla, 

00:36:35.386 --> 00:36:38.246
 It would have happened because of necessity. 

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:39.760
 It is repeated. 

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:43.576
 If you do not have sustainable energy, this means that you have unsustainable energy. 

00:36:43.576 --> 00:36:45.156
 In the end, she will run out of you, 

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:50.990
 Economic laws will lead civilization 

00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:52.706
 Toward sustainable energy, 

00:36:52.706 --> 00:36:53.860
 Necessarily. 

00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:56.900
 The core value of a company like Tesla 

00:36:56.900 --> 00:37:01.396
 Is how quickly it accelerates the emergence of sustainable energy, 

00:37:01.396 --> 00:37:04.052
 Compared to what would have happened in another way. 

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:06.150
 So when I think, 

00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:08.956
 What would be the primary benefit of a company like Tesla, 

00:37:08.956 --> 00:37:10.636
 I will say, I hope, 

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:16.250
 If you accelerate this by a decade, perhaps more than a decade, 

00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:18.526
 It would be a very good thing to happen. 

00:37:18.526 --> 00:37:20.076
 This is what I consider 

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:24.180
 The primary benefit for Tesla. 

00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:31.666
 As for us to become a multi-planet species and a civilization traveling through space. 

00:37:31.666 --> 00:37:33.500
 This is not a must. 

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.070
 It is very important to realize that this is not necessary. 

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:39.536
 I think the future of sustainable energy is largely inevitable, 

00:37:39.536 --> 00:37:44.216
 But becoming a civilization traveling through space is certainly not inevitable. 

00:37:44.216 --> 00:37:48.390
 If you look at how far space has advanced, 

00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:51.850
 In 1969, we were able to send a person to the moon. 

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:53.060
 1969 

00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:57.490
 Then we got our space shuttle. 

00:37:57.490 --> 00:38:00.970
 The shuttle can only take people to a low orbit around the Earth. 

00:38:00.970 --> 00:38:02.510
 Then the space shuttle stopped, 

00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:06.110
 The United States can no longer send anyone to orbit. 

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.200
 This is the trend. 

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.100
 The trend is like nothing goes down to nothing. 

00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.740
 People make mistakes when they think 

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:15.870
 The technology is developing automatically. 

00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.800
 It does not develop automatically. 

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:22.486
 It only develops if a lot of people work hard to make it better, 

00:38:22.486 --> 00:38:28.280
 In fact, I think it will retreat on its own. 

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.796
 When you look at great civilizations like ancient Egypt, 

00:38:30.796 --> 00:38:32.706
 They could build the pyramids, 

00:38:32.706 --> 00:38:34.480
 Then they forgot how to do it. 

00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:37.396
 And the Romans after that, they built amazing water canals. 

00:38:37.396 --> 00:38:39.360
 Then they forgot how to do it. 

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.540
 Elon, it seems to me when I listen to you 

00:38:42.540 --> 00:38:44.856
 And look at the different things that you did 

00:38:44.856 --> 00:38:47.470
 You have a unique double incentive about everything 

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.220
 I think it is interesting. 

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:56.110
 The first is the willingness to act to advance humanity’s long-term interest. 

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:58.506
 The other is the desire to do something exciting. 

00:38:58.506 --> 00:39:03.196
 It seems that you feel you need to push each other. 

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.316
 By Tesla, you want to achieve sustainable energy, 

00:39:06.316 --> 00:39:10.580
 So you make these exciting and cool cars to do that. 

00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:12.200
 Solar energy, to reach it, 

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.817
 So you make these beautiful ceilings. 

00:39:13.817 --> 00:39:16.390
 We haven't even talked about your latest thing, 

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:17.580
 We don't have time for that. 

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.816
 But you want to protect humanity from evil artificial intelligence, 

00:39:20.816 --> 00:39:24.066
 So you're going to create a great brain-automatic communication interface. 

00:39:24.066 --> 00:39:27.916
 To provide us with infinite memory, the possibility of teleportation, etc. 

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.766
 On Mars, it appears that what you are trying to say is: 

00:39:30.766 --> 00:39:34.350
 Yes, we want to save humanity 

00:39:34.350 --> 00:39:35.806
 And to have an alternative plan, 

00:39:35.806 --> 00:39:39.056
 But we also want to inspire humanity, 

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.580
 This is one way to inspire. 

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.236
 I believe the values ​​of beauty and inspiration 

00:39:49.236 --> 00:39:51.366
 They are not valued enough, 

00:39:51.366 --> 00:39:52.820
 No doubt. 

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:54.196
 But I want to be clear. 

00:39:54.196 --> 00:39:56.316
 I am not trying to be the savior of anyone. 

00:39:56.316 --> 00:39:57.340
 This is not what .. 

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:01.830
 I am just trying to think ahead 

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:03.060
 Without being sad. 

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.310
 (clap) 

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.540
 a beautiful saying. 

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.726
 I think all of here is agreed 

00:40:11.726 --> 00:40:12.820
 As no ... 

00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.716
 None of this will inevitably happen. 

00:40:15.716 --> 00:40:19.350
 And the fact that you dream about these things in your mind, 

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.986
 You dream of things that no one else would dare dream about, 

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:24.656
 Or no other person is able to dream 

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:28.346
 With the same level of complexity you dream about. 

00:40:28.346 --> 00:40:31.276
 The fact that you do that, Elon, is great. 

00:40:31.276 --> 00:40:34.226
 Thank you for helping us all to dream bigger dreams. 

00:40:34.226 --> 00:40:38.456
 But you'll alert me if it starts to get real crazy, right? 

00:40:38.456 --> 00:40:40.296
 (Laughter) 

00:40:40.296 --> 00:40:43.426
 Thanks, Elon Musk, that was pretty cool. 

00:40:43.426 --> 00:40:45.136
 That was really cool. 

00:40:45.136 --> 00:40:48.940
 (clap)
