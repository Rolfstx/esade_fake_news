00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.389
The President:
Thank you, guys. Thank you. Thank you very

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:04.851
much. Thank you. Everybody please have a seat.
Thank you. Listen, you guys had to listen

00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:07.990
to me at the State of the Union -- or at least
pretend to listen to me.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.990
(laughter)

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.380
So I'll try to keep it relatively brief, some
opening remarks and then open it up for questions.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.000
First of all, I just want to thank Harry Reid.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.690
(applause)

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:30.039
I recently said he's got one of the toughest
jobs in Washington -- managing an institution

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:36.780
that by its very nature is, let's face it,
you guys are a little difficult to manage.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.850
I've been a part of this caucus. I really
don't think anybody could have done a better

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:50.059
job under more trying circumstances than Harry
Reid. And I think he deserves a huge round

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.830
of applause.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.830
(applause)

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.031
Now, let me start by saying we always knew
this was going to be a difficult year to govern

00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:05.549
 -- an extraordinarily difficult year to govern.
We began 2009 with a financial system on the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:14.250
brink of collapse, an economy bleeding nearly
700,000 jobs per month, a $1.3 trillion deficit,

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.860
and two wars that were costly in every sense
of the word. We knew that solutions wouldn't

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.970
come easily or come quickly. We knew that
the right decisions would be tough and sometimes

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.810
they would be unpopular. And we knew that
we might have to make them sometimes without

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.560
any help from our friends on the other side
of the aisle. But we made those decisions.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.060
We led. Those actions prevented another Great
Depression; they broke the back of a severe

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.510
recession. The economy that was shrinking
by 6 percent a year ago is now growing at

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.890
nearly 6 percent one year later.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.890
(applause)

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:03.020
That's because of the work that you did. Harry
listed some of the work that you did on behalf

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.720
of the American people, even under these difficult
circumstances: extending health insurance

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.510
to 4 million children, protecting consumers
from getting ripped off by their credit card

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.680
companies, and kids being targeted by big
tobacco. Some things that weren't noted or

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.150
didn't get a lot of attention: You reformed
defense spending by eliminating waste, and

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.170
saved taxpayers billions while keeping us
safe at the same time. You gave billions of

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.501
dollars of tax relief to small businesses
and 95 percent of working families here in

00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:43.200
America. You did all this despite facing enormous
procedural obstacles that are unprecedented.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.170
You may have looked at these statistics. You
had to cast more votes to break filibusters

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:55.580
last year than in the entire 1950s and '60s
combined. That's 20 years of obstruction packed

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:03.739
into just one. But you didn't let it stop
you. As Harry mentioned, though, our mission

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.459
is far from accomplished, because while the
worst of the storm has passed, far too many

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.930
Americans are still hurting in its wake. I
know you've seen it back home in the shuttered

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.569
businesses, the foreclosed homes; you've heard
it from constituents who are desperate for

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.920
work; and we've seen it in the burdens that
families have been grappling with long since

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.230
this recession hit -- issues that we've been
talking about now for years: the burden of

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.690
working harder and longer for less, of being
unable to save enough to retire or to help

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:43.950
kids with college expenses, the extraordinarily
constant rising costs of health care. Those

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.330
problems haven't gone away. It's still our
responsibility to address them. All that's

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.130
changed in the last two weeks is that our
party has gone from having the largest Senate

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:00.780
majority in a generation to the second largest
Senate majority in a generation. And we've

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:07.340
got to remember that. There was apparently
a headline after the Massachusetts election;

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.591
the Village Voice announced that Republicans
win a 41-59 majority.

00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.100
(laughter)

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:26.120
It's worth thinking about. We still have to
lead. Saving and creating jobs have to continue

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.440
to be our focus in 2010. Last year, we gave
small business -- the engines of job creation

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.000
 -- tax relief, and expanded lending through
the SBA. I don't know if you are aware that

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:45.080
SBA loans have gone up 70, 80 percent, which,
by the way, indicates the degree to which

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:50.110
there is still huge demand among small businesses.
Some of the banks are saying, well, we're

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.920
not lending because there's not as much demand
out there. There are a lot of small businesses

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.600
that are hungry for loans out there right
now. And we've made progress but they're still

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.410
struggling. So I've proposed additional ideas
to help small businesses start up and hire,

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:09.210
to raise wages and expand, and to get the
credit they need to stay afloat. You've made

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.750
some of these same proposals, as well. We
should put them into action without delay.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.120
(applause)

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:23.770
We've invested
in America's infrastructure, rebuilding roads

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.210
and bridges, and ports and railways, and putting
people to work strengthening our communities

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.870
and our country. And as you know, the Recovery
Act was designed so that a lot of that work

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.389
is going to be taking place this year, not
just last year. Many of the projects you funded

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:45.070
come online in the next six months. But we
can do more, and we should do so without delay.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.830
Through the investments you made in clean
energy startups, we've not only helped put

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.680
Americans to work, we're on track to double
our nation's capacity to generate renewable

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.169
energy over the next few years. I've proposed
additional tax credits that will promote private

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:06.680
sector hiring and energy conservation. We
should do that without delay. I think ideas

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.430
like this should be pretty palatable to the
other party. They seem pretty common sense,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:18.220
pretty centrist. We should be able to hear
their ideas as well. That's why I spoke to

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.100
the Republican caucus last Friday. I think
it was to the country's benefit that we had

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:30.280
an open and frank discussion about the challenges
facing the American people and our ideas to

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.410
solve them.

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:32.410
(applause)

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.930
I got to admit, I had a little fun at that
caucus.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.130
(laughter)

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:43.270
Now, obviously, on some issues, we didn't
agree. But on some, we did. And I'm reminded

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.300
that when it came to health insurance reform
in particular, I sought out and supported

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:53.610
Republican ideas from the start -- so did
you. Max Baucus -- where's Max? I think he

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:59.860
can testify to spending a little time listening
to Republican ideas. So can Chris Dodd and

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.910
Tom Harkin. You considered hundreds of Republican
amendments, and incorporated many of their

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:11.801
ideas into the legislation that passed the
Senate. So when I start hearing that we should

00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:17.100
accept Republican ideas, let's be clear -- we
have. What hasn't happened is the other side

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:24.280
accepting our ideas. And I told them, I want
to work together when we can, and I meant

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.120
it. I believe that's the best way to get things
done for the American people. But I also made

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:36.050
it clear that we'll call them out when they
say they want to work with us and we extend

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:45.220
a hand and get a fist in return. Last week,
for example, you put up for a vote a bill

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:57.569
I supported -- Conrad-Gregg fiscal commission.
We were sure this was going to be bipartisan,

00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:04.009
only to see seven Republicans who co-sponsored
the idea in the first place suddenly decide

00:08:04.009 --> 00:08:10.069
to vote against it. Now, I'm open to honest
differences of opinion. But what I'm not open

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:14.770
to is changing positions solely because it's
good short-term politics. And what I'm not

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:21.480
open to is a decision to stay on the sidelines
and then assign blame. I've little patience

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.660
for the kinds of political calculation that
says the cost of blocking everything is less

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:33.330
than the cost of passing nothing; that basically
says "If they lose, I win." That's been the

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:38.890
politics in Washington for too long, and the
problem is it leaves the American people out

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:44.000
of the equation. So I would just suggest to
this caucus, if anybody is searching for a

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:51.519
lesson from Massachusetts, I promise you the
answer is not to do nothing. The American

00:08:51.519 --> 00:08:55.640
people are out of patience with business as
usual. They're fed up with a Washington that

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.570
has become so absorbed with who's up and who's
down that we've lost sight of how they're

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:06.330
doing. They want us to start worrying less
about keeping our jobs and more about helping

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:12.800
them keep their jobs. And they want to see
their business done in an open and transparent

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:19.500
way. When we took back the Senate in 2007,
we did so in part because we made a case that

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.550
we'd be better on ethics and transparency.
And we backed that up by passing the most

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:30.290
sweeping ethics reforms since Watergate and
by beginning to address earmark abuse. We

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:34.780
should be proud of those accomplishments.
But if we're going to erase that deficit of

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.850
trust that I mentioned at the State of the
Union, we're still going to have to do more.

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:44.380
That's why I've proposed that we work together
to make all earmark requests public, on one

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:49.350
central Web site, before they come up for
a vote; and to require lobbyists to discuss

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:55.370
details of their contacts on behalf of their
clients with the administration or with Congress.

00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:59.680
That's why, working with people like Dick
Durbin, who's been vocal on this for a long

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.360
time, we've got to confront the gaping loophole
that the Supreme Court recently opened in

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:10.290
our campaign finance laws that allowed special
interests to spend without limit to influence

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:15.140
American elections. We've also got to get
back to fiscal responsibility. And I spoke

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.040
about this at the State of the Union. Just
10 years ago, America had a budget surplus

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:25.399
of over $200 billion. Remember, people were
worried about what might happen with all these

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:29.970
surpluses, and whether it would create problems
in the financial markets. That was just a

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:38.000
decade ago. After two wars, two tax cuts,
prescription drug program -- none of which

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.330
were paid for -- we faced a deficit of over
$1 trillion, a debt over the next decade of

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:50.700
$8 trillion, before my administration spent
a single dollar. Now, we can't change the

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:57.350
past, but we can change the future. That's
why I'm asking you to adopt a freeze in non-security

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:03.110
discretionary spending for the next three
years, starting next year. We're still having

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:08.490
a tough time right now, given the economy
is just starting to pick up steam -- but starting

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:13.190
next year. That's why I'm grateful that all
of you restored the PAYGO rules that worked

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:18.950
so well in the 1990s. I already mentioned
the fiscal commission. We may not have been

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.940
able to get the votes for a statutory commission,
but we're going to -- I am going to appoint

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:30.610
a commission by executive order, because it's
important for us to take these issues seriously

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:35.329
 -- not just for us but for our children and
our grandchildren. Let me just wrap up by

00:11:35.329 --> 00:11:41.720
saying this. I know these are tough times
to hold public office. I'm there in the arena

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:50.399
with you. The need is great. The anger and
the anguish are intense. The economy is massive

00:11:50.399 --> 00:11:56.050
and so, as a consequence, no matter what levers
and buttons we press, sometimes it doesn't

00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:04.320
move as quickly as is needed to provide relief
to so many of our constituents. In that kind

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:10.490
of circumstance, I think the natural political
instinct is to tread lightly, keep your head

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:15.880
down, and to play it safe. I've said this
before to this caucus; I just want to say

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:24.649
it again. For me, it is constantly important
to remind myself why I got into this business

00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:30.490
in the first place; why I'm willing to be
away from my family for big stretches at a

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:40.290
time; the financial sacrifices that so many
of you have made; being subject to criticism

00:12:40.290 --> 00:12:48.640
constantly. You don't get in this for the
fame. You don't get in it for the title. You

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.050
get in it because somewhere in your background,
at some point in time, you decided there was

00:12:53.050 --> 00:13:01.800
an issue that was so important that you were
willing to stand up and be counted. You were

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:08.570
going to fight for something. And you decided
you were going to run as a Democrat because

00:13:08.570 --> 00:13:13.470
there was a core set of values within the
Democratic Party about making sure that everybody

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:21.589
had a fair shot, making sure that middle-class
folks were treated fairly in our economy,

00:13:21.589 --> 00:13:27.620
making sure that those who were on the outside
had a way in that led you to get involved

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:33.470
in public service. And that's what we have
to remind ourselves, especially when it's

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:43.019
hard -- especially when it's hard. You look
at an issue right now like health care. So

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:48.529
many of us campaigned on the idea that we
were going to change this health care system.

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:54.010
So many of us looked people in the eye who
had been denied because of a preexisting condition,

00:13:54.010 --> 00:13:58.220
or just didn't have health insurance at all,
or small business owners in our communities

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:03.920
who told us that their premiums had gone up
25 percent or 30 percent. And we said we were

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:12.510
going to change it. Well, here we are with
a chance to change it. And all of you put

00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:21.970
extraordinary work last year into making serious
changes that would not only reform the insurance

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:28.910
industry, not only cover 30 million Americans,
but would also bend the cost curve, and save

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:36.490
a trillion dollars on our deficits, according
to the Congressional Budget Office. There's

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:41.899
a direct link between the work that you guys
did on that and the reason that you got into

00:14:41.899 --> 00:14:49.920
public office in the first place. And so as
we think about moving forward, I hope we don't

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.490
lose sight of why we're here. We've got to
finish the job on health care.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:56.490
(applause)

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:02.040
We've got to finish the job on financial regulatory
reform.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.320
(applause)

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:09.970
We've got to finish the job even though it's
hard. And I'm absolutely confident that if

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:19.889
we do so in an open way, in a transparent
way, in a spirit that says to our political

00:15:19.889 --> 00:15:27.610
opponents that we welcome their ideas, we
are open to compromise, but what we're not

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:34.720
willing to do is to give up on the basic notion
that this government can be responsive to

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:38.890
ordinary people and help give them a hand
up so they can achieve their American Dream

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.480
 -- we will not give up that ideal.

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.480
(applause)

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:48.070
If that's where we go, I'm confident that
politics in 2010 will take care of themselves.

00:15:48.070 --> 00:16:01.320
Harry, thank you very much. I'm going to turn
it over to questions. Thank you.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.520
(applause)

00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:07.880
Senator Reid:
First question, Arlen Specter. Let me tell

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:12.019
everyone people have come to me and indicated
they wanted to ask questions. We're taking

00:16:12.019 --> 00:16:14.060
a list of those. Arlen Specter is first.

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:21.040
Senator Specter:
Mr. President, I begin by applauding your

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:27.589
decision to place the economy at the top of
the agenda, to put America back to work and

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:36.829
provide jobs, jobs, jobs. I have a two-part
question, and just a brief statement of the

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:44.740
issue. We have lost 2.3 million jobs as a
result of the trade imbalance with China between

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:54.820
2001 and 2007. The remedies to save those
jobs are very ineffective -- long delays,

00:16:54.820 --> 00:17:00.779
proceedings before the International Trade
Commission, subject to being overruled by

00:17:00.779 --> 00:17:09.110
the President. We have China violating international
law with subsidies and dumping -- really,

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:15.919
a form of international banditry. They take
our money and then they lend it back to us

00:17:15.919 --> 00:17:25.620
and own now a big part of the United States.
The first part of my question is, would you

00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:36.299
support more effective remedies to allow injured
parties -- unions which lose jobs, companies

00:17:36.299 --> 00:17:45.600
which lose profits -- by endorsing a judicial
remedy, if not in U.S. courts perhaps in an

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:55.960
international court, and eliminate the aspect
of having the ITC decisions overruled by the

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:05.060
President -- done four times in 2003 to 2005,
at a cost of a tremendous number of jobs on

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:10.631
the basis of the national interest. And if
we have an issue on the national interest,

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:16.720
let the nation pay for it, as opposed to the
steel industry or the United Steel Workers.

00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:24.750
And the second part of the question, related,
is when China got into the World Trade Organization,

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:32.929
a matter that 15 of us in this body opposed,
there were bilateral treaties. And China has

00:18:32.929 --> 00:18:39.860
not lived up to its obligations to have its
markets open to us, but take our markets and

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:47.670
take our jobs. Would you support an effort
to revise, perhaps even revoke, those -- that

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:54.580
bilateral treaty, which gives China such an
unfair trade advantage? Thank you.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:00.660
The President:
Arlen, I would not be in favor of revoking

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:07.740
the trade relationships that we've established
with China. I have shown myself during the

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.970
course of this year more than willing to enforce
our trade agreements in a much more serious

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:22.080
way. And at times I've been criticized for
it. There was a case involving foreign tires

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:28.320
that were being sent in here, and I said this
was an example of where we've got to put our

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:36.860
foot down and show that we're serious about
enforcement. And it caused the usual fuss

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:42.600
at the international level, but it was the
right thing to do. Having said that, I also

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:50.650
believe that our future is going to be tied
up with our ability to sell products all around

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:56.280
the world, and China is going to be one of
our biggest markets, and Asia is going to

00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.980
be one of our biggest markets. And for us
to close ourselves off from that market would

00:20:00.980 --> 00:20:06.520
be a mistake. The point you're making, Arlen,
which is the right one, is it's got to be

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:15.620
reciprocal. So if we have established agreements
in which both sides are supposed to open up

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:22.539
their markets, we do so and then the other
side is imposing a whole set of non-tariff

00:20:22.539 --> 00:20:29.520
barriers in place, that's a problem. And it
has to be squarely confronted. So the approach

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:35.500
that we're taking is to try to get much tougher
about enforcement of existing rules, putting

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:43.860
constant pressure on China and other countries
to open up their markets in reciprocal ways.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:50.030
One of the challenges that we've got to address
internationally is currency rates and how

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:57.169
they match up to make sure that our goods
are not artificially inflated in price and

00:20:57.169 --> 00:21:03.409
their goods are artificially deflated in price.
That puts us at a huge competitive disadvantage.

00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:10.810
But what I don't want to do is for us as a
country, or as a party, to shy away from the

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:15.929
prospects of international competition, because
I think we've got the best workers on Earth,

00:21:15.929 --> 00:21:23.570
we've got the most innovative products on
Earth, and if we are able to compete on an

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:28.980
even playing field, nobody can beat us. And
by the way, that will create jobs here in

00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:42.110
the United States. If we just increased our
exports to Asia by a percentage point, by

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:48.070
a fraction, it would mean hundreds of thousands,
maybe millions of jobs here in the United

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:53.290
States. And it's easily doable. And that's
why we are going to be putting a much bigger

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:59.450
emphasis on export promotion over the next
several years. And that includes, by the way,

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:03.360
export promotion not just for large companies
but also for medium-size and small companies,

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:09.300
because one of the challenges -- I was up
in New Hampshire yesterday, and you saw this

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:15.550
terrific new company that had just been started
up -- it's only got 13, 14 employees at this

00:22:15.550 --> 00:22:25.950
point. But it has a new manufacturing technique
for the component parts in LED light bulbs,

00:22:25.950 --> 00:22:36.220
potentially could lower the price of LED light
bulbs, cut them in half. And these folks,

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:41.559
they potentially could market not just here
in the United States, but this is a technology

00:22:41.559 --> 00:22:48.510
that could end up being sent all around the
world. But they don't have the money to set

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:53.750
up their own foreign office in Beijing to
navigate through the bureaucracy. They've

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:57.951
got to have some help being over there. And
so that's one of the things that we really

00:22:57.951 --> 00:23:04.539
want to focus on in this coming year, is making
sure that our export-import banks, our trade

00:23:04.539 --> 00:23:10.400
offices, that we are assisting not just the
big guys, although we do want to help them,

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:14.309
but also the medium-sized and small businesses
that have innovative products that could be

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:18.760
marketed if they just got a little bit of
help and a little bit of push from the United

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.760
States government.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.870
Senator Reid:
Sir, Michael Bennet, Colorado.

00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:26.340
Senator Bennet:
Thanks for coming, Mr. President. It's good

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.640
to see you. You talked in the State of the
Union very well about a number of the challenges

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.490
that we face as a country, which are serious.
I mean, even before we were driven into the

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:40.120
worst recession since the Great Depression,
the last period of economic growth in this

00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:44.600
country's history, was the first time middle-class
family income actually fell during a period

00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:50.420
of economic growth; no net jobs created since
1998; household wealth the same at the end

00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:55.159
of the decade as it was at the beginning;
and an education system that's not working

00:23:55.159 --> 00:24:01.400
well enough for our kids. And on top of everything
else, got a $1.4 trillion deficit and $12

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:05.650
trillion of debt. I was saying that the other
day, by the way, in Colorado, and I was talking

00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:09.340
about how our kids were going to have to pay
this back if we didn't make this decision

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:13.960
that we've got to face up to. And my daughter,
Caroline, who's 10, was there, and she walked

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.840
out with me at the end and she said, "Just
so you know, I'm not paying that back."

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.840
(laughter)

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.081
So she has the right attitude, I think.

00:24:21.081 --> 00:24:24.400
The President:
But just in case you're counting on it.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:25.400
(laughter)

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.309
Senator Bennet:
At the same time, this place looks broken

00:24:28.309 --> 00:24:34.799
to the American people. Our ability to make
these decisions is open to enormous question

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:38.931
in the wake of the health care discussion,
in particular. I had a woman the other day

00:24:38.931 --> 00:24:44.670
in Glenwood Springs, Colorado, ask me where
she could get her lobbyist in Washington,

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:49.100
D.C. What are we going to do differently?
What are you going to do differently? What

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:55.740
do we need to do differently as Democrats
and Republicans to fix this institution so

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:00.390
that our democracy can actually withstand
the test that we're facing right now?

00:25:00.390 --> 00:25:02.830
The President:
Well, let me just make a couple observations,

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:10.169
having served in the Senate and now seeing
it from the perspective of the White House.

00:25:10.169 --> 00:25:15.890
First of all, whenever people ask me, why
isn't Washington working -- I am a fierce

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:26.120
defender of the integrity and hard work of
individual members, which is, by the way,

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:32.650
matched up by --when you look at polls, people
hate Congress, but individual members a lot

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:41.320
of them feel are really working hard on their
behalf. So the problem here you've got is

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:53.350
an institution that increasingly is not adapted
to the demands of a hugely competitive 21st

00:25:53.350 --> 00:26:04.690
century economy. I think the Senate in particular,
the challenge that I gave to Republicans and

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:14.990
I will continue to issue to Republicans is
if you want to govern then you can't just

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:23.440
say no. It can't just be about scoring points.
There are multiple examples during the course

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:31.640
of this year in which that's been the case.
Look, I mentioned the filibuster record. We've

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:41.350
had scores of pieces of legislation in which
there was a filibuster, cloture had to be

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:50.990
invoked, and then ended up passing 90 to 10,
or 80 to 15. And what that indicates is a

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:57.260
degree to which we're just trying to gum up
the works instead of getting business done.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:03.159
That is an institutional problem. In the Senate,
the filibuster only works if there is a genuine

00:27:03.159 --> 00:27:08.919
spirit of compromise and trying to solve problems,
as opposed to just shutting the place down.

00:27:08.919 --> 00:27:12.020
If it's just shutting the place down, then
it's not going to work. That's point number

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:20.960
one. Point number two. In terms of what -- how
we operate, we as Democrats, I do think that

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:28.240
the more open we are, the more transparent
we are, the more people know exactly how things

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:37.520
are working even if sometimes it takes longer
to maintain that transparency, the better

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:42.560
off we are. And I think the health care bill
is a perfect example. And the truth of the

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:49.470
matter is, is that the process looked painful
and messy, but the innumerable hearings that

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:59.470
were held did give an opportunity for the
product to get refined so that I think that

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:05.559
the ultimate package, after potential negotiations
between the House and the Senate, is better

00:28:05.559 --> 00:28:15.471
than where we started. And there was a possibility
and continues to be a possibility to be in

00:28:15.471 --> 00:28:21.570
discussions with the American people about
what exactly that bill accomplishes. On the

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:26.570
other hand -- and I take some fault for this
 -- at the end of the process when we were

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:31.770
fighting through all these filibusters and
trying to get it done quickly so that we could

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:37.250
pivot and start talking about other issues
that were so important to the American people,

00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:43.220
some of that transparency got lost. And I
think we paid a price for it. And so it's

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:50.880
important, I think, to constantly have our
cards out on the table and welcome challenges

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:57.310
and welcome questions. If the Republicans
say that they can insure every American for

00:28:57.310 --> 00:29:04.990
free, which it what was claimed the other
day, at no cost, I want to know. Because I

00:29:04.990 --> 00:29:09.730
told them, I said, why would I want to get
a bunch of lumps on my head doing the hard

00:29:09.730 --> 00:29:16.100
thing if you've got the easy thing? But you've
got to show me, you've got to prove to me

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.490
that it actually works -- because I've talked
to every health care expert out there and

00:29:20.490 --> 00:29:28.890
it turns out if you want to reform the insurance
system, if you want to make sure that people

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:33.260
without preexisting conditions are able to
get insurance, if you want to provide coverage

00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:38.580
for people, if you want to bend the cost curve,
then you need a comprehensive bill, because

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:45.580
this is a complicated area involving one-sixth
of our economy. But we should be open to that

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:52.179
dialogue, and not underestimate the power
of the American people, over time -- despite

00:29:52.179 --> 00:29:56.840
millions of dollars of advertising to the
contrary from the insurance industry and others

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:03.679
 -- we should not underestimate the American
people's willingness to say, okay, I got it.

00:30:03.679 --> 00:30:08.400
And there are still going to be disagreements,
and some will disagree with us. But we've

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.840
got to constantly make our case, I think,
and not play an insider's game. Play an outsider's

00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:17.649
game. Last point I would make about this.
You know what I think would actually make

00:30:17.649 --> 00:30:24.240
a difference, Michael -- I think if everybody
here -- excuse all the members of the press

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:30.580
who are here -- if everybody here turned off
your CNN, your Fox, your -- just turn off

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:40.230
the TV -- MSNBC, blogs -- and just go talk
to folks out there, instead of being in this

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:50.220
echo chamber where the topic is constantly
politics -- the topic is politics. It is much

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:58.740
more difficult to get a conversation focused
on how are we going to help people than a

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:04.059
conversation about how is this going to help
or hurt somebody politically. And that's part

00:31:04.059 --> 00:31:12.419
of what the American people are just sick
of -- because they don't care, frankly, about

00:31:12.419 --> 00:31:18.040
majority and minorities and process and this
and that. They just want to know, are you

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:25.909
delivering for me? And we've got to, I think,
get out of the echo chamber. That was a mistake

00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:34.280
that I think I made last year, was just not
getting out of here enough. And it's helpful

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.690
when you do.

00:31:36.690 --> 00:31:37.710
(applause)

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:43.500
Senator Reid:
Mr. President, you've told me -- suggested

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.299
don't pay any attention to the blogs, don't
listen to talk radio, don't watch cable TV.

00:31:47.299 --> 00:31:51.529
And I follow that advice pretty good.

00:31:51.529 --> 00:31:52.529
(laughter)

00:31:52.529 --> 00:31:57.789
Next question will be from the chair of our
Agriculture Committee, the Senator from Arkansas,

00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:58.789
Blanche Lincoln.

00:31:58.789 --> 00:32:04.320
Senator Lincoln:
Me, neither, Mr. President. I stay away from

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:08.980
the TVs and everything else. But thank you
so much for being here with us today. And

00:32:08.980 --> 00:32:13.630
I want to thank you also -- I had an opportunity
with several of my colleagues from the House

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:18.330
and Senate to have a bipartisan meeting yesterday
with the First Lady on childhood obesity.

00:32:18.330 --> 00:32:22.340
It was a great meeting and we look forward
to working with her and you and your administration

00:32:22.340 --> 00:32:27.159
to really tackle that problem on behalf of
our children and the future of our country.

00:32:27.159 --> 00:32:33.580
Mr. President, I come from a seventh-generation
Arkansas family. My dad was a good Democrat,

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:41.220
and he was a great Arkansan, and he was very
typical of Arkansans in that he was very independent-minded,

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:48.010
as am I, and as most of my constituents. And
he used to tell me early on when I ran for

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:53.519
Congress, he said it's really results that
count. And as I look at what's going on in

00:32:53.519 --> 00:32:58.769
my state and among my constituents -- I visited
with a constituent yesterday, good Democrat,

00:32:58.769 --> 00:33:03.669
small business owner, who was extremely frustrated
 -- extremely frustrated because there was

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:08.669
a lack of certainty and predictability from
his government for him to be able to run his

00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:14.299
businesses. He's -- he and his father have
worked hard, they've built three or four different

00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:20.040
small businesses, and he fears that there's
no one in your administration that understands

00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:25.409
what it means to go to work on Monday and
have to make a payroll on Friday. He wants

00:33:25.409 --> 00:33:31.029
results. He wants predictability. And I think
that you're exactly right. People out there

00:33:31.029 --> 00:33:38.399
watching us, they see us nothing more than
Democrats and Republicans up here fighting,

00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:46.070
fighting only to win a few political points,
not to get the problem solved. And so I just

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:50.919
 -- I want to echo I guess some of what my
colleague, Michael Bennet from Colorado, mentioned,

00:33:50.919 --> 00:33:56.679
but also to ask you, in terms of where we
are going, what can we tell the people in

00:33:56.679 --> 00:34:02.919
terms of predictability and certainty in getting
this economy back on track? How are we going

00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:10.050
to do that? And are we willing as Democrats
not only to reach out to Republicans but to

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:17.690
push back in our own party for people who
want extremes, and look for the common ground

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:22.190
that's going to get us the success that we
need not only for our constituents but for

00:34:22.190 --> 00:34:27.899
our country in this global community, in this
global economy? Are we willing as Democrats

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:33.311
to also push back on our own party and look
for that common ground that we need to work

00:34:33.311 --> 00:34:37.889
with Republicans and to get the answers? And
it's really the results that are going to

00:34:37.889 --> 00:34:42.399
count to our constituents. And we appreciate
the hard work that you put into it.

00:34:42.399 --> 00:34:45.060
The President:
Well, the -- look, there's no doubt that this

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:52.919
past year has been an uncertain time for the
American people, for businesses and for people

00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:59.130
employed by businesses. Some of that certainty
just had to do with the objective reality

00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:07.920
of this economy entering into a freefall.
So let's just be -- let's remind ourselves

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:16.720
that if you've got an economy suddenly contracting
by 6 percent, or a loss of trillions of dollars

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:24.770
of wealth basically in the blink of an eye,
or home values descending by 20 percent, that

00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:29.579
that's going to create a whole lot of uncertainty
out there in the business environment and

00:35:29.579 --> 00:35:35.990
among families. And part of what we've done
over the course of this year is to put a floor

00:35:35.990 --> 00:35:41.520
under people's feet. That's what the Recovery
Act did. That's what the interventions and

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.980
the financial markets did. It broke the back
of the recession, stabilized the markets.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:52.130
Nobody is talking about a market meltdown
at this point. And people haven't recovered

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:56.470
all that they had lost in their 401(k)s, but
they're feeling a little better when they

00:35:56.470 --> 00:36:04.670
open that envelope now than they did six months
ago. State budgets were in freefall; that

00:36:04.670 --> 00:36:08.990
was stabilized. States are still going through
incredible pain, but they did not have to

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:13.980
lay off teachers and firefighters and cops
at the levels that they would have to otherwise

00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:22.099
lay them off. That provided some stability
and some certainty. So the steps you've taken

00:36:22.099 --> 00:36:28.790
as a Congress, the steps we've taken as an
administration, have helped to stabilize things.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:36.060
Now, moving forward, Blanche, what you're
going to hear from some folks is that the

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:41.830
way to achieve even greater economic growth
 -- and keep in mind the economy is now growing

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:46.730
at a 6 percent clip, so the question is when
do businesses actually start hiring, because

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:54.820
they're now making a profit -- what you're
going to start hearing is the only way to

00:36:54.820 --> 00:37:05.240
provide stability is to go back and do what
we'd been doing before the crisis. So I noticed

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:14.260
yesterday when we were -- there was some hearing
about our proposal to provide additional financing

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:19.359
to small businesses and tax credits to small
businesses. Some of our friends on the other

00:37:19.359 --> 00:37:24.099
side of the aisle said, "This won't help at
all. What you have to do is to make sure that

00:37:24.099 --> 00:37:28.940
we continue the tax breaks for wealthiest
Americans. That's really what's going to make

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:39.040
a difference." Well, if the agenda -- if the
price of certainty is essentially for us to

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:48.260
adopt the exact same proposals that were in
place for eight years leading up to the biggest

00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:53.020
economic crisis since the Great Depression
 -- we don't tinker with health care, let

00:37:53.020 --> 00:38:01.910
the insurance companies do what they want,
we don't put in place any insurance reforms,

00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:07.050
we don't mess with the banks, let them keep
on doing what they're doing now because we

00:38:07.050 --> 00:38:15.820
don't want to stir up Wall Street -- the result
is going to be the same. I don't know why

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:23.480
we would expect a different outcome pursuing
the exact same policies that got us into this

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:29.440
fix in the first place. Michael Bennet articulated
it very well. Part of the reason people are

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:34.720
feeling anxious right now, it's not just because
of this current crisis -- they've been going

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.960
through this for 10 years. They've been working
and not seeing a raise. Their costs have been

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.680
going up, their spouses going to the workforce
 -- they work as hard as they can. They're

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.400
barely keeping their heads above water. They're
trying to figure out how to retire. They're

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:53.210
seeing more and more of their costs on health
care dumped in their lap. College tuition

00:38:53.210 --> 00:39:00.340
skyrockets. They are more and more vulnerable,
and they have been for the last decade, treading

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:10.599
water. And if our response ends up being,
because we don't want to -- we don't want

00:39:10.599 --> 00:39:15.520
to stir things up here, we're just going to
do the same thing that was being done before,

00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:24.700
then I don't know what differentiates us from
the other guys. And I don't know why people

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:31.000
would say, boy, we really want to make sure
that those Democrats are in Washington fighting

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:38.230
for us. So the point I'm making -- and Blanche
is exactly right -- we've got to be non-ideological

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:46.420
about our approach to these things. We've
got to make sure that our party understands

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:56.490
that, like it or not, we have to have a financial
system that is healthy and functioning, so

00:39:56.490 --> 00:40:04.560
we can't be demonizing every bank out there.
We've got to be the party of business, small

00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:09.290
business and large business, because they
produce jobs. We've got to be in favor of

00:40:09.290 --> 00:40:17.400
competition and exports and trade. We don't
want to be looking backwards. We can't just

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:25.369
go back to the New Deal and try to grab all
the same policies of the 1930s and think somehow

00:40:25.369 --> 00:40:33.630
they'd work in the 21st century. So Blanche
is exactly right that sometimes we get ideologically

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:39.160
bogged down. I just want to find out what
works, and I know you do, too, and I know

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:43.530
the people in Arkansas do, too. But when you're
talking to the folks in Arkansas you also

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:48.220
have to remind them what works is not just
going back and doing the same things that

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:56.130
we were doing before. And, yes, there's going
to be some transition time. If we have a serious

00:40:56.130 --> 00:41:03.329
financial regulatory reform package, will
the banks squawk? Yes. Will they say this

00:41:03.329 --> 00:41:10.920
is the reason we're not lending? Yes. The
problem is we know right now they're not lending,

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:18.869
and paying out big bonuses. And we know that
the existing regulatory system doesn't work.

00:41:18.869 --> 00:41:27.800
So we shouldn't be spooked by this notion
that, well, is now the time to take seriously

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:34.100
in an intelligent way, not in a knee-jerk
way, the challenge of financial regulatory

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.570
reform so that you don't have banks that are
too big to fail and you're not putting taxpayers

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:43.290
at risk and you're not putting the economy
at risk -- now is the time to do it. The same

00:41:43.290 --> 00:41:49.030
is true with health care. The same is true
with health care. There are, I promise you,

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:54.720
at least as many small businesses out there,
if you talk to them, who will say, I just

00:41:54.720 --> 00:42:02.250
got my bill from my health insurance and it
went up 40 percent. And we've got to do something

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:06.109
for them. All right?

00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:07.260
(applause)

00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:12.201
Senator Reid:
Next question, the junior Senator from the

00:42:12.201 --> 00:42:14.330
state of New York, Kirsten Gillibrand.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:20.270
Senator Gillibrand:
Mr. President, I have an issue I'd like to

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:21.270
 --

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:22.270
The President:
Kirsten, we've got a mic for you.

00:42:22.270 --> 00:42:24.230
Senator Gillibrand:
Thank you, Mr. President. I have an issue

00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:30.150
I'd like to raise that is very important to
every New Yorker and to many, many Americans,

00:42:30.150 --> 00:42:35.490
and that's health care for our 9/11 responders
and for all the communities that live near

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:41.319
Ground Zero. Now, these Americans hail from
every one of the 50 states and every single

00:42:41.319 --> 00:42:47.619
congressional district in the entire United
States. And now, because of exposure to toxins

00:42:47.619 --> 00:42:53.390
from the collapse of the World Trade Center
Towers, there's about 20,000 people who are

00:42:53.390 --> 00:42:58.930
sick -- some of them gravely ill, suffering
from serious health effects, some are disabled,

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:07.240
some have died. I've introduced legislation
to provide permanent care and proper compensation

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:15.640
for these Americans. And my question is: Would
you today commit to working with Congress

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:21.471
to pass comprehensive 9/11 -- a comprehensive
9/11 health bill that's fully paid for?

00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:24.579
The President:
Well, I fully commit to working with you guys.

00:43:24.579 --> 00:43:32.869
Keep in mind that our budget already significantly
increased funding precisely for this purpose.

00:43:32.869 --> 00:43:41.410
So I'm not just talking the talk; we've been
budgeting this as a top priority for the administration.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:46.530
I confess, Kirsten, I have not looked at all
the details of your legislation. But I know

00:43:46.530 --> 00:43:53.790
that not only you and Chuck, but everybody
here, wants to make sure that those who showed

00:43:53.790 --> 00:44:03.980
such extraordinary courage and heroism during
9/11, that they are fittingly cared for, and

00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.400
that's going to be something that we are going
to be very interested in working with you

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.400
on. All right?

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400
Senator Gillibrand:
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.230
The President:
Good.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:12.260
(applause)

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:17.290
Senator Reid:
The next question is the Chairperson of the

00:44:17.290 --> 00:44:22.599
Environmental Public Works Committee, Senator
Barbara Boxer.

00:44:22.599 --> 00:44:23.599
The President:
Hey, Barbara Boxer.

00:44:23.599 --> 00:44:25.420
Senator Boxer:
Great to see you here, Mr. President. And

00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:28.970
thanks for doing this and thanks for meeting
with the Republican caucus at the House. I

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:36.420
thought it was very instructive for the American
people. As Senator Feinstein and I tell our

00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:41.250
colleagues every day, California is hurting.
I think -- I know -- that you're aware of

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:46.940
that. And they really want to see a fighting
spirit in us -- that we are committed, even

00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:51.350
though we've had some political setbacks,
to get the job done. And I just want to tell

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:56.910
you, as I watched you during the State of
the Union, listened to you, what you are doing

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:01.440
now is really important to the folks that
I represent, because you're showing that fighting

00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:06.680
spirit no matter what the adversity is, and
you're coming up with specific proposals.

00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:12.329
So I want to ask you about small business.
We all know they're the job creators; 64 percent

00:45:12.329 --> 00:45:18.540
of new jobs over the last 15 years came from
small business. Your new proposal, which does

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:22.619
mirror a couple of people -- I look at Senator
Merkley, I know Senator Warner and others,

00:45:22.619 --> 00:45:29.961
we've worked hard on this. For community banks
to lend, can you do that by executive order?

00:45:29.961 --> 00:45:35.599
Because my understanding is you can use some
of the TARP funds that were paid back and

00:45:35.599 --> 00:45:41.540
use that -- or those funds that have not been
used -- can you use that and get this going

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:47.230
by executive order, or do you need us to put
that program into a jobs bill? And second,

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:52.550
are you using your influence as much as you
can to get the big banks to lend? They've

00:45:52.550 --> 00:45:58.290
dropped lending by $12 billion over the last
year, so I wonder if you can give us an update

00:45:58.290 --> 00:45:59.290
on that.

00:45:59.290 --> 00:46:07.400
The President:
First of all, I've now taken trips to Allentown,

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:11.890
Pennsylvania; Elyria, Ohio; most recently
 --

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.030
Senator Reid:
Baltimore.

00:46:13.030 --> 00:46:14.730
The President:
I was in Baltimore.

00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:16.980
(laughter)

00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:21.400
Had a great time in Baltimore. Just recently
in --

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:22.400
Senator Reid:
Searchlight.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.620
The President:
-- Nashua, New Hampshire. Haven't been to

00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:27.670
Searchlight yet, but we're going to get there.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:29.060
(laughter)

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:37.730
And everywhere I go, you talk to small business
and they will tell you they are still experiencing

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:45.480
a severe credit crunch. The larger businesses
right now are able to get financing. Even

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:51.720
the medium-size businesses, the credit markets
have improved. Smaller businesses, even if

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:59.819
they are making a profit and have not missed
a payment, are finding that banks are averse

00:46:59.819 --> 00:47:14.180
to providing them capital. Now, two reasons
that they cite: One is they say their bankers

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:23.020
are telling them that the regulators are just
looking over their shoulder too much and so

00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:31.460
the community banks feel that their hands
are tied. These are independent regulators.

00:47:31.460 --> 00:47:39.130
They are diligent in doing their jobs. Obviously
they feel caught off guard because of the

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:44.230
lax regulation, in some cases, of the banking
industry before the financial crisis. You

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:50.530
get a sense that the pendulum has swung too
far in the other direction. The challenge

00:47:50.530 --> 00:47:54.319
that we've got is we've got to be careful
because these are independent regulators and

00:47:54.319 --> 00:48:00.599
we don't want to politicize them. But what
Treasury Secretary Geithner and others have

00:48:00.599 --> 00:48:06.050
done is to discuss with the regulators what
we are hearing in the field and to make sure

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:13.550
that there is a consistency of approach that
doesn't prevent banks from making what are

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:23.660
good loans and taking reasonable risks. So
that's one thing we're hearing. The other

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:32.650
thing, though, that is still out there is
that the larger banks generally haven't been

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:38.900
in this market; a lot of the smaller companies
never had access to them in the first place,

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:44.650
and we want to actually see if we can get
more of those large banks to get into this

00:48:44.650 --> 00:48:49.630
marketplace. And when I met with the big bank
CEOs, this was something that I pushed them

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:56.349
on. They tell me, and we have seen some confirmation
of this, that they are actually ramping up

00:48:56.349 --> 00:49:02.150
some of their small business lending and setting
up more aggressive divisions actively seeking

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:10.410
out loans. So that's the effort that we're
making to jawbone the private sector to do

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:15.190
what it needs to do. In the meantime -- you
mentioned the specific proposals that we've

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:20.710
put forward -- I do think it's better to do
them through legislation than through executive

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:30.710
order. TARP was a congressionally created
structure with some fairly stringent guidelines

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:35.660
in terms of how we were supposed to approach
it. It shouldn't be hard to do, though. It's

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:42.380
a pretty simple concept. Banks have repaid
money; there's $30 billion that we could take

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:49.190
that has already been repaid -- immediately
apply that to a fund so that small banks are

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:55.980
 -- community banks are able to provide their
small business customers with greater lending.

00:49:55.980 --> 00:50:03.560
And I do think that getting that as part of
a jobs package is priority number one. And

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:07.440
I know I've already talked to Harry about
this -- my assumption is, is that if you combine

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:13.430
that with the tax credits that we've put in
place for hiring, the provisions that we talked

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:18.890
about to incentivize weatherization programs
that can immediately start hiring people to

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:25.819
retrofit homes and businesses and help reduce
our energy costs -- taking some of those immediate

00:50:25.819 --> 00:50:31.700
steps now I think will pay some big dividends
down the road. And the timing of it is perfect,

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:37.369
because our job last year was to make sure
the economy was growing. The economy is now

00:50:37.369 --> 00:50:42.309
growing. But what's happening is businesses,
either because they can't find financing or

00:50:42.309 --> 00:50:46.980
because they're still just dipping their toe
in the water, have been hesitant to hire full-time

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:53.809
workers. And for us to start giving them some
serious incentives, giving them additional

00:50:53.809 --> 00:51:01.220
access to financing, could accelerate a process
that otherwise could take a much longer time

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:04.579
and, frankly, all those folks out there who
are out of work right now, they just can't

00:51:04.579 --> 00:51:08.410
afford to wait any longer -- they need it
now. All right?

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:12.280
Senator Reid:
We have time for one or two more questions,

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.830
if the question is short --

00:51:13.830 --> 00:51:15.530
The President:
And the answer is short.

00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:16.530
(laughter)

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:18.500
Senator Reid:
Otherwise we'll only have one question. The

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.640
Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Pat Leahy.

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:25.270
Senator Leahy:
Mr. President, I want to thank you for coming

00:51:25.270 --> 00:51:31.349
here. I think this is -- thank you for coming
here. I was just whispering to Marcel these

00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:40.180
answers are so good and need to be heard.
You have a great sense of what the federal

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:47.990
judiciary should be. I think back to President
Clinton's time, when the other side blocked

00:51:47.990 --> 00:51:56.609
61 of his judges. You've had some superb judges.
You've talked to both Republicans and Democrats,

00:51:56.609 --> 00:52:02.530
sent up some superb names. And Senator Reid
still has to file a cloture. We have to spend

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:09.980
a week of doing that, and then they pass by
100 to nothing or 90-10. My thing is this

00:52:09.980 --> 00:52:14.380
 -- because of what they did last time, we
end up with the greatest shortage and the

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:22.930
most judicial crises I think in our history.
Will you continue to work very hard to get

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:28.940
up names as quickly as possible, so that we
can do this, and help us get these judges

00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:36.569
through? I don't want the same judicial crises
to occur. You've had good nominees. Can you

00:52:36.569 --> 00:52:41.380
commit to work with us, both parties, and
keep trying to get them through?

00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:43.059
The President:
Well, this is going to be a priority. Look,

00:52:43.059 --> 00:52:48.119
it's not just judges, unfortunately, Pat,
it's also all our federal appointees. We've

00:52:48.119 --> 00:52:59.710
got a huge backlog of folks who are unanimously
viewed as well qualified, nobody has a specific

00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:04.040
objection to them, but end up having a hold
on them because of some completely unrelated

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:09.839
piece of business. That's an example, Michael,
of the kind of stuff that Americans just don't

00:53:09.839 --> 00:53:21.550
understand. On the judges front, we had a
judge for the -- coming out of Indiana, Judge

00:53:21.550 --> 00:53:29.309
Hamilton, who everybody said was outstanding
 -- Evan Bayh, Democrat; Dick Lugar, Republican;

00:53:29.309 --> 00:53:36.560
all recommended. How long did it take us?
Six months, six, seven months for somebody

00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:44.650
who was supported by the Democratic and Republican
senator from that state. And you can multiply

00:53:44.650 --> 00:53:53.690
that across the board. So we have to start
highlighting the fact that this is not how

00:53:53.690 --> 00:54:00.140
we should be doing business. Now, in fairness
 -- in fairness, when we were in the minority,

00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:04.990
there were some times where we blocked judges,
we blocked appointees. I think it's fair to

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:13.720
say we were a little more selective in how
we did it -- "a lot more," somebody said.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.450
(laughter)

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:20.800
So this is an example of where I'm going to
reach out to Mitch McConnell; I know Harry

00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:25.791
has as well. And I'm just going to say, look,
if the government is going to work for the

00:54:25.791 --> 00:54:37.910
American people, I can't have the administrator
for GSA, which runs every federal facility,

00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:43.150
all federal buildings all across the country
 -- here we are, we're trying to save billions

00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:50.290
of dollars, cut waste -- Claire McCaskill
has been all on top of how can we audit our

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:56.190
spending -- and we could save billions of
dollars in ending old leases that don't work

00:54:56.190 --> 00:55:03.670
or renegotiating them or consolidating buildings
and efficiencies. But I don't have a GSA administrator,

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:09.170
even though I nominated somebody who was well
qualified several months ago, and nobody can

00:55:09.170 --> 00:55:15.150
tell me that there's anything particularly
wrong with her. They're blocking her because

00:55:15.150 --> 00:55:24.059
of some unrelated matter. I don't know, you
guys may know better than I do. And that is

00:55:24.059 --> 00:55:27.661
 -- that has to end. It has to end.

00:55:27.661 --> 00:55:28.661
(applause)

00:55:28.661 --> 00:55:41.160
And the American people want it to end. Let's
have a fight about real stuff. Don't hold

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:46.460
this woman hostage. If you have an objection
about my health care policies, then let's

00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:51.440
debate the health care policies. But don't
suddenly end up having a GSA administrator

00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:58.559
who is stuck in limbo somewhere because you
don't like something else that we're doing,

00:55:58.559 --> 00:56:02.410
because that doesn't serve the American people.
Then they don't know what the argument is

00:56:02.410 --> 00:56:07.100
about. Then it's just sort of a plague on
both your houses because it looks like you

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:10.571
guys are just fighting all the time. And we've
got to put an end to that.

00:56:10.571 --> 00:56:12.771
Senator Reid:
I missed somebody on my list. If you would

00:56:12.771 --> 00:56:14.960
just be patient with us, we'll have two very
short questions.

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:15.980
The President:
I will indulge, Harry.

00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:18.020
Senator Reid:
The first question is going to come from the

00:56:18.020 --> 00:56:22.520
only person that's a member of the United
States Senate who has a spouse that's won

00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:26.849
a Pulitzer Prize -- Sherrod Brown from Ohio.

00:56:26.849 --> 00:56:29.770
(laughter)

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:36.710
Senator Brown:
Thank you for joining us. Thank you for your

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:41.420
visit to Lorain County, Ohio, a week and a
half ago; first presidential visit to that

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:45.099
county of 300,000 since Harry Truman in 1948.

00:56:45.099 --> 00:56:46.321
The President:
It was a great visit. We had a great time.

00:56:46.321 --> 00:56:49.530
Senator Brown:
It was terrific. Ten miles from there, Oberlin

00:56:49.530 --> 00:56:54.260
College, one of the great private institutions
of higher learning in this country -- at Oberlin

00:56:54.260 --> 00:56:58.050
College, there was a building built there
seven or eight years ago, fully powered by

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:04.180
solar panels. It's the only -- it's the largest
building on any college campus in America

00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:09.109
like that. Those solar panels were bought
in Germany and Japan, not surprisingly -- Germany,

00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:15.220
a country that has both an energy policy and
a manufacturing policy. Seventy-five miles

00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:21.299
west of there is Toledo, Ohio, where you've
been several times, and Toledo has more solar

00:57:21.299 --> 00:57:27.970
energy manufacturing -- solar manufacturing
jobs than any city in America. It begs the

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:33.550
question of two things in terms of manufacturing
policy and energy policy. We have all kinds

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:38.920
of things in so many of our states -- manufacturing
wind turbine components and solar panel components

00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:44.400
 -- but we're the only major industrial country
in the world without a manufacturing policy.

00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:49.950
And every rich country in the world has one.
We don't. I know what you're doing with Ron

00:57:49.950 --> 00:57:53.510
Bloom in the White House and other things,
but how do we get there? How do we -- when

00:57:53.510 --> 00:57:59.819
we read these articles in the paper that China
is just exploding in terms of wind turbine

00:57:59.819 --> 00:58:04.770
manufacturing and solar panel manufacturing
 -- how do we rebuild our manufacturing sector

00:58:04.770 --> 00:58:09.990
with a manufacturing policy, combined with
an energy policy that gets us there?

00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:12.430
The President:
I hope people had a chance to read that article

00:58:12.430 --> 00:58:18.540
that was in The New York Times I guess last
Sunday, talking about how China is not waiting,

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:26.359
it is moving. And already the anticipation
is, is that they will lap us when it comes

00:58:26.359 --> 00:58:32.470
to clean energy. Now, they're not a democracy
and so they don't debate.

00:58:32.470 --> 00:58:33.640
(laughter)

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:48.710
And there are no filibuster rules. And so
obviously over the long term a system that

00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:54.540
allows for robust debate and exchange of ideas
is going to produce a better result. I believe

00:58:54.540 --> 00:59:02.839
that. But we have to understand that when
it comes to some key issues like energy, we

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:08.490
are at risk of falling behind. We've already
fallen behind, but it's not irrevocable because

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:12.710
we still have the best research, we still
have potentially the best technology, we've

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:17.690
got the best universities, the best scientists,
and as I said, we've got the most productive

00:59:17.690 --> 00:59:23.839
workers in the world. But we've got to bring
all those things together into a coherent

00:59:23.839 --> 00:59:30.420
whole. Now, I think there are a couple of
elements to this. One, in terms of manufacturing

00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:37.740
generally -- you just mentioned Ron Bloom,
who we put in charge of a manufacturing task

00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:43.440
force, is just issuing now a report to me
about the direction we need to go to have

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:50.369
some coordination when it comes to manufacturing.
Now, this is not some big bureaucratic top-down

00:59:50.369 --> 00:59:56.579
industrial policy; it is figuring out how
do we coordinate businesses, universities,

00:59:56.579 --> 01:00:01.200
government, to start looking at where are
our strategic opportunities, and then making

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:08.470
those investments, filling holes that exist
so that we can be competitive with what China

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:14.400
is doing or what Germany is doing or what
Spain is doing. And my hope is, is that during

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:18.800
the course of this year we're going to be
able to work with all 50 senators, because

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:24.329
all of you have a stake in this, to just see
where are our manufacturing opportunities

01:00:24.329 --> 01:00:29.970
and where can we fill -- plug some holes in
order to make sure that we're competitive

01:00:29.970 --> 01:00:37.180
internationally. Specifically on clean energy,
we know that's an opportunity. I continue

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:47.109
to believe, and I'm not alone in this, that
the country that figures out most rapidly

01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:57.650
new forms of energy and can commercialize
new ideas is going to lead the 21st century

01:00:57.650 --> 01:01:00.560
economy. I think that is our growth model.

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.560
(applause)

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.570
Senator Reid:
Final question --

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:06.180
The President:
But -- hold on, just one last thing I want

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:11.160
to say about this: In order for us to maximize
it, part of it is the good work that Jeff

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:16.010
has been doing in terms of just finding the
right incentives. We've got to be open-minded

01:01:16.010 --> 01:01:21.990
about a whole range of technologies. We've
got to look at clean coal technology. We've

01:01:21.990 --> 01:01:27.609
got to look at nuclear technology. We're going
to be making some significant announcements

01:01:27.609 --> 01:01:32.450
this year. This is an example, Blanche, of
where we can't be stuck in the past in terms

01:01:32.450 --> 01:01:39.470
of how we see these things. We're not going
to be able to ramp up solar and wind to suddenly

01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:45.450
replace every other energy source anytime
soon, and the economy still needs to grow.

01:01:45.450 --> 01:01:52.549
So we've got to look at how to make existing
technologies and options better. But -- and

01:01:52.549 --> 01:01:55.990
this is just the point that I wanted to make
because it came up in New Hampshire yesterday

01:01:55.990 --> 01:02:06.200
 -- we still -- one of the best ways to be
on the forefront in energy is to incentivize

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:15.820
clean energy, and discourage the old sources
or methods that aren't going to work in the

01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:22.161
future. And so the fact that Joe Lieberman
is working with Lindsey Graham, John Kerry

01:02:22.161 --> 01:02:27.900
has been all over this -- the three of them
are coming together to try to find a workable,

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:35.920
bipartisan structure so that we are incentivizing
and rewarding the future -- and understanding

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:41.420
that there's a transition, so that we've got
to make sure that the disruptions are minimized

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:47.140
as we move into this new energy future -- that's
going to be vital. So don't give up on that.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:53.170
I don't want us to just say the easy way out
is for us to just give a bunch of tax credits

01:02:53.170 --> 01:03:04.470
to clean energy companies. The market works
best when it responds to price. And if they

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:09.630
start seeing that, you know what, dirty energy
is a little pricier, clean energy is a little

01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:15.000
cheaper, they will innovate, and they will
think things through in all kinds of innovative

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.160
ways. So I want to congratulate specifically
John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, and Lindsey Graham,

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:24.799
who it probably doesn't help him for me to
compliment him -- (laughter) -- but has been

01:03:24.799 --> 01:03:28.030
very thoughtful in terms of how they're approaching
this issue.

01:03:28.030 --> 01:03:31.040
Senator Reid:
Final question, Evan Bayh, Indiana.

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:38.500
Senator Bayh:
Thank you for being with us, Mr. President.

01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:45.200
The President:
We can get you a mic. Nice sneakers, by the

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.200
way, Evan.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:47.200
(laughter)

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.990
Senator Bayh:
Oh, thank you. You've got to stay light on

01:03:48.990 --> 01:03:50.210
your feet around here, right?

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:51.210
(laughter)

01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:55.190
Mr. President, you've already addressed this
in part, and several of the other questioners

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:58.520
have raised this, but I'd like to present
it in a little bit different way that I think

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:03.040
is on the minds of people in my state, and
perhaps in the minds of independents and moderate

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:07.460
Republicans and conservative Democrats around
the country -- and that's this issue of the

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:12.190
deficit and rising debt, and restoring the
fiscal health of this country to a position

01:04:12.190 --> 01:04:16.059
where it ought to be. Frankly, I think the
public and average citizen have been way ahead

01:04:16.059 --> 01:04:21.090
of the political class on this. They understand
in the long run this is unsustainable, it's

01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:25.290
bad economics. They understand that generally
 -- generationally, as Michael was mentioning,

01:04:25.290 --> 01:04:30.579
it's unfair to our children to ask them to
pay these bills. And most of all, there's

01:04:30.579 --> 01:04:35.200
a sense of unfairness. They're having to make
sacrifices in their daily lives, but too many

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:40.059
in Washington expect to have continuing increases
in the programs they care about; ordinary

01:04:40.059 --> 01:04:44.369
citizens are making sacrifices, and yet we
want our earmarks or pet projects. And they

01:04:44.369 --> 01:04:49.319
ask, why can't Washington make the same sacrifices
that we're willing to make? Now, I think they

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:52.800
realize that the other party doesn't have
much credibility on this subject. They handed

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:59.470
you a -- what, a $1.3 trillion deficit. Vice
President Cheney famously said that in his

01:04:59.470 --> 01:05:05.859
opinion deficits didn't matter. He just flat
out said it. That's wrong. It's bad economics.

01:05:05.859 --> 01:05:10.780
It's wrong. And so we've got a job to do.
But I think many people across the country

01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:14.120
candidly look at us and say, I don't know
if the Democrats are willing to take this

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:18.200
on. They think we want to tax too much and
spend too much, and do we have the backbone

01:05:18.200 --> 01:05:22.380
to really stand up and make some of these
hard decisions? Now, to your credit, you've

01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:26.750
called for some things that aren't always
popular in our party. The first thing I noticed

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:31.500
when you put into effect that non-security
discretionary spending freeze is you got kicked

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:35.569
in the shins by some of the left-wing blogs.
And you called for more restraint on earmarks.

01:05:35.569 --> 01:05:38.880
That's not always popular among our group,
but to your credit, you've called for those

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:43.569
things. So my question to you, Mr. President,
is speaking to independents, conservative

01:05:43.569 --> 01:05:47.339
Democrats, moderate Republicans -- people
who know we have to do this -- why should

01:05:47.339 --> 01:05:51.080
the Democratic Party be trusted? And are we
willing to make some of the tough decisions

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.799
to actually head this country in a better
direction?

01:05:53.799 --> 01:05:56.079
The President:
Well, I'll tell you why the Democratic Party

01:05:56.079 --> 01:05:59.690
should be trusted -- because the last time
this budget was balanced, it was under a Democratic

01:05:59.690 --> 01:06:03.770
President who made some very tough decisions.

01:06:03.770 --> 01:06:04.850
(applause)

01:06:04.850 --> 01:06:13.780
I think this is pretty straightforward. Bill
Clinton made some very hard political decisions.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:18.280
Some of you were there in Congress. You know
how tough those votes were. You got no help

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:25.549
from the other side. But as a consequence,
the economy took off and you had a $200 billion

01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:29.720
surplus at the end of his presidency. So I
think he deserves enormous credit for that.

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:34.080
Those of you who took those votes deserve
enormous credit for that. That's why we've

01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:39.920
had -- we should have credibility. But we're
still haunted by the debates that took place

01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:50.500
from the '70s, the '60s, right? And that hasn't
completely worked through the political mindset.

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:57.500
So we're still saddled with this notion of
the tax-and-spend model when, if you actually

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:06.369
look at it, we've been very fiscally responsible.
Now, having said that, we have been complicit

01:07:06.369 --> 01:07:16.539
in some ways over the last decade. The prescription
drug bill -- not paid for. Two wars -- not

01:07:16.539 --> 01:07:29.900
paid for. Two tax cuts -- not paid for. The
emergence of a structural deficit that is

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:35.920
only going to grow because we all know that
the biggest drivers are Medicare and Medicaid,

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:41.760
and as people get older, as the population
gets older, and as new technologies come online,

01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.121
people are demanding new services for health
care, those are going to become more and more

01:07:46.121 --> 01:07:51.800
expensive, and that's what's going to blow
up the budget in the long term. So to answer

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.579
your question, how do we -- having said that,
there's no doubt that we've lost trust. And

01:07:55.579 --> 01:08:01.630
part of it was just bad timing. It's like
the cartoon, right, you're sort of standing

01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:08.970
there and somebody hands you a ticking time
bomb and it explodes, and you've got all this

01:08:08.970 --> 01:08:16.940
gunpowder on your hands, and you didn't construct
the bomb, but you're holding it. And so what

01:08:16.940 --> 01:08:22.870
happened last year was, we come in. You got
a $1.3 trillion deficit that we're inheriting;

01:08:22.870 --> 01:08:27.969
you've got $3 trillion revenue that are lost
because of the recession; you've got an $8

01:08:27.969 --> 01:08:36.359
trillion projected debt over the next 10 years;
and you've got trillions more in projected

01:08:36.359 --> 01:08:41.359
deficits when you start looking -- counting
entitlements. Everybody has been looking at

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:50.380
Kent Conrad's charts here for the last several
years about it. And so at that very moment,

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:56.880
suddenly the headlines that people are seeing
is, "bank bailout, recovery package," and

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:04.219
it all kind of merges together into just this
blob of spending, and people aren't seeing,

01:09:04.219 --> 01:09:08.650
how is this benefiting me. It just looks like
Washington business as usual. And all that

01:09:08.650 --> 01:09:17.580
suspicion gets amplified. So it's completely
understandable. I think the way that we regain

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:27.319
trust is to pursue good policies but not be
afraid also to explain these policies, and

01:09:27.319 --> 01:09:30.800
to be honest with the American people that
we're not going to dig ourselves out of this

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:40.830
hole overnight. So a couple of things I've
done. I have encouraged that we go back to

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:47.469
PAYGO, pay-as-you-go. People understand that
concept: You pay as you go. I congratulate

01:09:47.469 --> 01:09:51.670
the Senate on voting for it. I expect the
House to get it done. I want to sign that.

01:09:51.670 --> 01:09:52.670
Senator Reid:
Not a single Republican.

01:09:52.670 --> 01:09:57.800
The President:
The second thing you already mentioned is

01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:04.320
this non-defense discretionary freeze. One
thing I want to mention, though. It's not

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:09.210
as if we're not going after defense, as well.
It's just it would be irresponsible when we

01:10:09.210 --> 01:10:18.170
have two wars for me to impose that same kind
of limitation, tie my hands not knowing what

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:22.480
contingencies may be needed. But if you look
at what Bob Gates has been doing in the Defense

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:29.760
Department in really going after some sacred
cows over at the Pentagon, he's been serious

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:33.650
about it. We've already saved billions of
dollars. We intend to keep saving billions

01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:40.110
of dollars more on that front, as well. We've
already proposed $20 billion worth of savings

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:45.010
for this year by eliminating and consolidating
programs. Last year we proposed $17 billion

01:10:45.010 --> 01:10:51.630
and we were pooh-poohed. Some of the editorials
were all, "Uh-huh, 17, this is a pittance."

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:58.400
You know, only in Washington is $17 billion
a pittance. But it also indicates one of the

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:04.050
dangers that we have, is that you've got to
chip away at this problem. So every dollar

01:11:04.050 --> 01:11:11.420
counts. The work that Claire has done on auditing
 -- if we can squeeze out $5 million here,

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:16.620
$10 million here, make this program work a
little bit better, over time it creates good

01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:23.170
habits, and it starts exercising the fiscal
restraint muscles in ways that won't affect

01:11:23.170 --> 01:11:28.030
programming for people but will affect our
bottom line. So we're moving aggressively.

01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:35.150
We hope this year we get that stuff done.
But what we also have to understand is that

01:11:35.150 --> 01:11:40.710
if I take all the steps that I've put forward
and Congress follows my lead on the non-defense

01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:49.850
discretionary spending, we're prudent in terms
of defense spending, and we do all the things

01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:54.920
that we've talked about, we've still got this
structural deficit that we've inherited. Essentially

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.940
what my proposal does is to pay for the Recovery
Act and the other extraordinary steps we had

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:08.150
to take for last year, so that I will have
covered what happened on my watch. That's

01:12:08.150 --> 01:12:13.690
important to understand. Whatever spending
that I had to take that was extraordinary

01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:19.860
that you took with me, including the Recovery
Act, if we follow my budget outline, we will

01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:28.360
have taken care of, paid for what happened
on our watch. But what we will not have solved

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:36.520
is that huge structural deficit that existed
the day I walked in. And we've got to be able

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:41.670
to tell the truth to the American people that
that is hard to solve. And the reason it's

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:49.380
hard to solve is most of it is coming from
entitlements that people like. And it has

01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:52.730
to do with the fact that there's this huge
gap between the amount of money being paid

01:12:52.730 --> 01:12:57.940
out and the amount of money coming in. And
everybody understands this here, but I think

01:12:57.940 --> 01:13:01.860
that there's a misperception in the public.
If you ask your average constituent where

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:07.611
does federal dollars go, they'll tell you
foreign aid. And you say, well, foreign aid

01:13:07.611 --> 01:13:13.150
accounts for 1 percent of our budget. And
then they'll say, well, earmarks. Look, I

01:13:13.150 --> 01:13:17.940
think we have to discipline ourselves on earmarks
just because symbolically I think people -- it

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:24.969
makes people feel like we're not showing the
same kind of discipline that they are. Even

01:13:24.969 --> 01:13:28.020
for worthy projects you've still got to make
choices. So they're absolutely right about

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:33.510
that. But earmarks account for about 1 percent
of the budget. All right, so even if we eliminated

01:13:33.510 --> 01:13:41.510
all foreign aid and all earmarks, it doesn't
solve our problem. And as far as the arguments

01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:47.739
that our colleagues on the other side of the
aisle are making, I think it's important to

01:13:47.739 --> 01:13:57.360
explain to people that in order for us to
balance the budget while exempting entitlements,

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:07.350
no new revenues, you'd have to cut non-discretionary
defense spending by 60 percent -- cut it by

01:14:07.350 --> 01:14:17.110
60 percent. That's everything -- student loans,
NASA, veterans programs -- you name it, we'd

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:23.610
have to cut by 60 percent -- six, zero. That's
just not going to happen. That's why we called

01:14:23.610 --> 01:14:29.330
for the commission, because we've got to look
at some tough, long-term policy objectives.

01:14:29.330 --> 01:14:38.460
And that's why we've got to -- and I will
personally do this, I will say to my Republican

01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:42.310
friends, I want to solve it. I don't want
to play politics on it, but you've got to

01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:47.480
step up, you've got to fill these slots with
this commission that we're going to set up,

01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:52.290
put these people in a room, and actually solve
some of these problems. And I hope they do.

01:14:52.290 --> 01:15:01.980
And maybe I'm naïve. I'm still counting,
Evan, on the notion that good policy over

01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:09.080
the long term is good politics. If you do
the right thing, and you explain it clearly

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:15.580
and you do it openly, I'm confident that the
American people -- you can have an adult conversation

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:19.719
and say, this is not going to be easy, this
is not going to be painless, we're going to

01:15:19.719 --> 01:15:25.580
be struggling for a while, but our future
is bright. And if we show the same grit and

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:31.040
determination that previous generations have
shown, I have every confidence that we are

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:37.340
going to have a 21st century, the American
century, just like the 20th. All right? Thank

01:15:37.340 --> 01:15:38.340
you, everybody. God bless you.

01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:38.341
(applause)
