00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.089
Hello friends! I'm Max and you're
watching a video about my fifth year of

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:13.650
developing a small log cabin camp away
from people and roads in Karelia in the

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.840
previous episodes you might have seen
how I was building my off-grid cabin

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.539
from a typically large logs of about 40 cm (16 inches) in diameter

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.179
it is obvious it would have been easier
and faster to build a cabin using medium

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.540
sized logs but I decided not to cut a
single live tree rather I used the

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.100
available century-old pines
downed by a severe storm a few years

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:50.460
back in comparison to traditional sized
logs of 20cm diameter these 40 cm

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:00.390
logs are four times heavier initially I
had no plans to build a log cabin but I

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.680
couldn't just look at this high grade
construction lumber rotting and

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.689
infecting young pines with pests and
diseases this post-apocalyptic scenery

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:17.009
influenced me to pick up an axe and save
at least some of the downed pine logs

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.020
while clearing space for new trees
besides building the cabin I entertained

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.780
myself with other bushcraft projects
this season I did some gastronomical

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.640
experiments with a vertical grill and
built another tarp hanger that is a lot

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.310
larger than my old stretch film dome
storage I also modernized my swimming

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.049
pond by raising its water level and
carving granite steps to replace my

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.820
aging step-down ladder as well as
reinforced my bushcraft kayak before

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.030
making a long voyage along the cascade
of small local lakes now I have my own

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.439
fleet hidden on the right side of the
remote forest also a cut slabs for my

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.130
cabin's back door and experimented with
baking a spiral potato

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:13.840
even though I was baking it on a
traditional horizontal grill the result

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.740
was very satisfying
I also fished a lot and cooked fish

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:24.190
such as this pike using a Polish recipe
I improved my earth oven and learned to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.090
bake hearth bread an excellent bushcraft
food that is delicious

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.060
easy to make and has a long shelf life
in order to make hearth bread I had to

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.990
make an irregularly shaped wooden door
and seal the gaps between the rocks

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.510
with clay this small time investment
paid off though it is such a pleasure to

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.350
sit at my pond and eat a freshly baked
loaf of bread in the middle of nowhere

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.480
another project I made this summer
was this shaving horse such

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.450
contraption was widely used by barrel
makers and carpenters in the past you

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.050
might have seen why I decided to make a
shaving horse in the previous video even

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.730
though I spent almost two days to
complete it I never regretted the time

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.150
loss it saved me time with my carpentry
projects later making the whole process

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.610
safer for example it would have taken me
two to three times longer to make this

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:36.040
traditional pot holder without a shaving
horse I made this bushcraft tar

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.740
distillery to produce tar and rosin and
used rosin to adhere legs onto this

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.140
primitive cutting board as you can
see a lot of my projects interconnect

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.090
with each other but the main reason I
made tar and rosing is for building a

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.950
traditional Viking boat
I need tar and rosin for its

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.890
waterproofing I carved a primitive
cooking mortar for my culinary

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.990
experiments I saw these traditional
wooden mortars during my trip to

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:15.430
Tanzania next season I'm planning to
make a mini-mill powered by a water

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.530
wheel in the meantime a good old cooking
mortar and pestle

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:28.930
will do in other words there were a lot
of interesting adventures and projects

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.940
during my three-week stay at the log
cabin but in this video I will focus on

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:43.330
the first week of my vacation as usual
everything started with the delivery of

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.170
supplies from my boat to the campsite
that is further inland this year I

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:55.900
brought a lot of gear and other needed
supplies if I didn't cut out a trail

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.730
through hundreds of downed trees a few
years back I wouldn't be able to bring

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:07.990
heavy equipments to my camp my new
custom-made modular backpack made the

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:18.910
moving process much easier this year I
got a new 3,000 watt generator to

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.610
replace the one that broke last season

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.110
if it wasn't for my friend who came to
my rescue with the temporary replacement

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.729
generator I wouldn't have those drone
shots you saw earlier

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:47.249
I made four trips to my boat and back
which got me pretty hungry so it is time

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:54.539
to start cooking at the beginning of an
expedition it is best to cook the most

00:05:54.539 --> 00:06:00.840
perishable products first in my case
those were eggplants and marinated meat

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:06.300
that I just brought from the boat I
decided to cook them using a vertical

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.610
grill method which you might have seen
in one of my previous videos this one is

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:18.090
an expanded version where you can grill
multiple skewered dishes at once I'm

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.800
sure many people will say that skinning
egg plants is not the way to go

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.629
aesthetically here is my reasoning
because I will be vertically grilling I

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.759
can mix the taste of eggplants and meat
by positioning the meat on the top of a

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:38.759
skewer this way the sizzling fat will
run down enhancing the eggplants' taste

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:44.400
along with the smoke of the charcoal
this is why I peeled added diagonal cuts

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:53.039
and rubbed olive oil onto the eggplants
I was so hungry that I even added a

00:06:53.039 --> 00:06:57.199
couple of skewered hotdogs to the
grill

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:08.350
friends, check this out you can ignite
smoke

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:20.080
I think it's called pyrolysis as you can
see my vertical grill is quite mobile

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.590
and you can easily move it to a
different location even while it is

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.139
burning which is a pretty convenient
feature to the vertical grilling method

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:35.710
these homemade metal log dogs came in
handy even though I usually use them for

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:41.169
carpentry work another advantage of
vertical drilling is that the fat

00:07:41.169 --> 00:07:46.630
doesn't drip on the hot charcoals which
would produce toxins while burning so

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:50.560
even health-oreinted people don't
have to give up delicious food cooked on

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.380
the open fire my vertically grilled dishes
don't have any smell of burned fat or

00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:04.870
toxins but rather smell of pure charcoal
smoke friends it is a pity the video can't

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:10.240
give you any taste or smell samples I
would love to share the taste of it with

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:17.229
each of you if you watched my previous
videos you probably know that I brought

00:08:17.229 --> 00:08:22.750
and planted hundreds of deciduous trees
and bushes around my log cabin camp most

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:28.510
of them are growing in two nurseries not
far from the cabin it is important to

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:36.070
help them survive during the first years
in our harsh northern climate as it

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:42.940
often happens you can do two different
tasks at once during my long absence the

00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:47.980
bottom of my pond accumulated a lot of
organic sludge which is an excellent

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:54.339
natural fertilizer for my saplings I
needed to clean the pond anyway but

00:08:54.339 --> 00:08:58.209
throwing away organic fertilizer would
be remorsefully wasteful

00:08:58.209 --> 00:09:04.470
so I decided to allocate a spot for its
composting I weeded the saplings first

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:10.900
luckily you can easily make out rare and
exotic trees from native plants then I

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:15.880
laid out a layer of weeds on the ground for
my improvised composter on which I

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:21.329
dumped the sludge I will use most of it
next year

00:09:21.329 --> 00:09:27.059
when it turns into dark soil meanwhile I
used my last summer's stash of organic

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:34.290
sludge to fertilize my trees and bushes
the dried organic sludge collected from

00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:40.319
the bottom of lakes or ponds looks very
similar to peat but it is by far more

00:09:40.319 --> 00:09:47.670
valuable as a fertilizer while carrying
this water saturated sludge I came to a

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:53.189
conclusion that my dam works as a filter
separating and accumulating this sludge

00:09:53.189 --> 00:09:58.170
coming from the forest lake into the
pond to prevent it from happening in the

00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:03.299
future I will have to add an overflow
water pipe to my dam but I will do it a

00:10:03.299 --> 00:10:13.949
bit later as it is time to change the
activity I scythed the grass and removed

00:10:13.949 --> 00:10:21.420
some sod and soil to create a granite
embarkment in Karelia anywhere you stick a

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:27.869
shovel into the ground you will hit a
granite plate I'm going to carve out

00:10:27.869 --> 00:10:32.850
steps into the granite embarkment to
replace my aging wooden step-down ladder

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:42.989
I cut the sod on one side of the pond
and moved it to the dam to reinforce it

00:10:42.989 --> 00:10:49.319
and to raise the pond's water level note
all my pond cleaning activities resulted

00:10:49.319 --> 00:10:54.119
in clogging the dam and raising the
water level in it the first step of my

00:10:54.119 --> 00:10:58.339
ladder is already submerged under water

00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:04.919
meanwhile the fresh sludge has dried out
a bit and I'm going to use a portion of

00:11:04.919 --> 00:11:13.619
it for tree planting now this year
I brought saplings of black walnut northern

00:11:13.619 --> 00:11:19.470
catalpa and heart walnut trees the heart
walnut saplings were a gift from one of

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:27.239
my subscribers in about 20 years there
will be a beautiful alley of walnut and

00:11:27.239 --> 00:11:34.160
northern catalpa trees leading to the
log cabin I hope to see it then

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:44.670
Okay I'm done with all urgent tasks and
now it's time for some fun I decided to

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:50.130
entertain myself by making an overflow
valve in my dam the valve will help me

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.100
to quickly raise the water level in my
pond as needed

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:58.350
next year I'm planning to build a
waterwheel and a mini mill on the other

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:03.360
hand when I leave my camp I can leave it
open preventing the dam from working as

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:12.540
a sludge filter just letting it all
float downstream I avoided using green

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:17.280
wood on purpose because it will swallow
and can even crack the pipe this is why

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:24.630
I made the plug from a semi-rotted aspen
branch my new bi-metal bearded axe

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:29.640
helped to achieve a perfect fit if you
want to see how it was forged from a tie

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.050
plate and an old metal file I will leave
a link below

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:38.640
besides the axe making process the video
has beautiful nature footage of the axe

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:44.460
being tested in real world bushcraft
activities okay

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:49.110
the aspen plug is made and it is time to
install the whole contraption into the

00:12:49.110 --> 00:13:00.330
dam's wall I recently found a clay source
near my camp which means I will be

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:06.300
making some ceramics soon meanwhile I
applied some blue clay on it as a

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:11.580
pressure-damping sealant to prevent the
plug from getting stuck or cracking the

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:21.510
pipe now I can raise the dam's wall even
higher without risking that it will be

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:29.880
destroyed by a high-water in the spring
I need to raise the dam's wall by about 3

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:37.310
feet (1 meter) to create enough water flow
for my waterwheel project next summer

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:46.550
it has been a dry summer so I decided to
mulch my southern nursery to slow down the

00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:54.200
water evaporation here you can see
saplings of Alegan Birchs, indigo

00:13:54.200 --> 00:14:00.140
trees, Amur Velvet trees, White Acacia
trees, German Medlar trees, Red Bud

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:05.570
Cercis, Scarlet Red Maple, Northern Catalpa, Black Walnut, Heart-shaped Walnut and

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:09.050
Manchurian Walnut as well as a few more
names

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:15.279
I either forgot or their tree saplings
didn't make it to this day

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:25.579
meanwhile you can see the water level
raised to the second step of the pond's

00:14:25.579 --> 00:14:32.899
ladder and it is time to cook a meal I
already used up all perishable products

00:14:32.899 --> 00:14:37.640
and I need to start procuring food
supplies to supplement the ones that I

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:43.490
brought with me cooking a fish soup is a
good solution to start conserving on my

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:50.620
supplies it is a simple and nutritious
meal a bushcraft fast food

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.760
as I mentioned earlier I brought a "bucket
of electricity" to the camp this year

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:08.899
along with many battery-powered devices
that I need for filming this video the

00:15:08.899 --> 00:15:14.029
electronic devices filled a dedicated
waterproof duffel bag that I brought in

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:21.920
my boat you're looking at the charging
process of steadicams flashlights a car

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.970
battery an electric shaver smartphones
and a few power-banks because the

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.800
closest electrical outlet is many miles
away from here I always try to keep a

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:38.870
sufficient backup in case of generator
failure mostly for my power thirsty

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:45.649
video equipment such as my drone cameras
and laptop I also brought a couple of my

00:15:45.649 --> 00:15:51.639
power tools such as a side grinder to
try them with my new generator

00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:06.610
you've probably already guessed I'm
carving steps for my pond to replace the

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:11.499
aging wooden ladder
I made five years ago it could still

00:16:11.499 --> 00:16:16.209
serve me another decade while the
granite ladder will compete with Great

00:16:16.209 --> 00:16:27.970
Egyptian Pyramids in its longevity by
the way here is a cool hack if you are

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:32.709
wearing gloves you can quickly change
the side grinder's disc without using a

00:16:32.709 --> 00:16:44.800
wrench it takes two quick hits and the
disc's flange nut will loosen you've

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:50.319
probably noticed I installed an XLR audio
connector as a surrogate "Plug-in" power

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:57.249
cord connector DISCLAIMER: The XLR power cord hack wouldn't pass electrical codes

00:16:57.249 --> 00:17:02.860
in most countries please research this
beforehand if you decide to use XLR

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:10.029
connectors for your power tools I'm not
sure if it's necessary to have a dust

00:17:10.029 --> 00:17:13.959
cover on my side grinder but since it
felt hot to the touch

00:17:13.959 --> 00:17:19.000
I kept placing it in a waterproof bag
and cooled it in my pond periodically

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:29.860
during the grinding process making
granite steps for my pond was an

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.620
impromptu decision which is why I don't
have mason's chisels it is not a big deal

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:40.750
though if you have some tools and a
burning desire to do something you can

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:45.120
always makeshift the tools you need

00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:02.070
at home I have a chainsaw attachment
that accepts a 12-inch diameter cutting

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:08.520
disc allowing you to make four-inch (10 cm) deep cuts I think I will make the next

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:19.920
step
using my chainsaw every now and then

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:25.320
people ask me how I manage to keep my
clothes clean while doing construction

00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:37.140
work in my videos here's the answer I
use an old trick it is quick and easy to

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:43.470
wash clothes with your legs this way
your hands and back don't get tired the

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:50.130
legs can easily handle this simple task
moreover my hands and back even welcomed

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.870
the change of physical activity when I
went back to my step grinding work I

00:18:54.870 --> 00:19:01.980
felt fully refreshed however I wanted to
mechanize the process and built a

00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:07.470
waterwheel that could work as a washing
machine drum while being powered by the

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:14.160
water flow of this stream and of course it
is a bushcraft version of a waterwheel

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:21.870
made from local material using primitive
tools the waterwheel could also power a

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:28.170
mini mill, sharpening wheel, a forge
blower and perhaps even an electrical

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:35.670
generator please let me know what
applications of a waterwheel at my log

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:40.790
cabin camp would be the most interesting
for you

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:55.510
you're probably surprised that there is
an abundance of baby toads around here

00:19:55.510 --> 00:20:01.630
this summer happened to be atypically
dry all the grass including the sod on

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:08.620
my cabin's roof turned yellow I suspect
this is why the toads decided to migrate

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:15.190
downstream and were doing it for five
days I should say it was very

00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:20.740
inconvenient as you have to constantly
check where you're stepping luckily by

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:25.630
the end of the fifth day it started to
rain and the amphibians must have changed

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:30.600
their minds and stopped their migration

00:20:31.409 --> 00:20:36.640
if working with hand tools being
surrounded by baby toads wasn't a

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:41.890
problem with power tools
I had to sweep them away first which was

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:46.020
a slight inconvenience to say the least

00:20:47.039 --> 00:20:53.770
it is a pretty boring activity to grind
and polish rocks so I decided to take a

00:20:53.770 --> 00:21:01.630
break and went fishing at the nearby
lake it doesn't take long to catch a few

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:07.480
perch in the forest's lake then I ground
up some pepper freshly ground pepper is

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:15.520
important for cooking I added salt and
pepper and pierced the fish onto two

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.630
curved sticks

00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:28.090
note it is better to use curved sticks
as this way the fish will cook

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:35.470
horizontally preventing juices from
running out from its mouth lastly I

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:41.500
stuffed the perch with chopped onions
usually I add wild chanterelles to my

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:49.030
stuffing but there were no mushrooms in
the dry forest at the moment I get a

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:54.190
lot of questions about how I managed to
finish so many projects in one month of

00:21:54.190 --> 00:22:00.190
my summer vacation the answer is simple
I always try to work on a couple of

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:06.940
projects at once here's an example I'm
cooking fish making tea and distilling

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:11.790
tar from pine roots all at the same time

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:21.190
ok
the lunchtime is over and I'm going to

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:29.320
finish polishing the granite step once
done I started to clear a spot located

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:35.200
downstream from the pond this is where
I'm planning to make an aqueduct that

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:41.650
would feed a clepsydra (a water timer)
and a sink made from granite or wood at

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:47.110
least it will be easy to wash dishes a
bit later I might even make a water

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:54.550
heater using a couple of copper pipes Four
summers ago I made another dam with a

00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:58.930
drain pipe a little upstream
the second dam was supposed to help to

00:22:58.930 --> 00:23:04.150
stabilize the water flow
I guess I inspired a local beaver with my

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:10.150
efforts and he built his own dam on the
top of mine the beaver clogged the drain

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:15.790
pipe too as soon as I declogged the drain
pipe the water flow got noticeably

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:21.370
stronger so now I know there is enough
height and waterfall potential for my

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:29.620
mechanical projects at the pond with 6
feet (2 meters) of height difference I

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:34.570
will be able to direct water into a
wooden duct creating an artificial waterfall

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:37.769
that could rotate a waterwheel the

00:23:37.769 --> 00:23:43.739
waterwheel will mechanically power a mini
mill I even plan to grow wheat and

00:23:43.739 --> 00:23:49.739
rye next year so that I could make flour
in the mini mill and then bake bread in

00:23:49.739 --> 00:23:58.649
my earth oven such bread could be
considered 100% homemade as

00:23:58.649 --> 00:24:03.929
you can see the local amphibians are
not afraid of me at all even though I

00:24:03.929 --> 00:24:08.759
kept scaring away this frog it kept
stubbornly coming back to the granite

00:24:08.759 --> 00:24:15.149
promenade perhaps it's because it
liked to sit on the hot granite I should

00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:19.619
say it feels quite nice to stand
barefoot on a polished granite step

00:24:19.619 --> 00:24:22.999
warmed by the Sun

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:33.090
in the future I have plans to raise the
pond's water level and to add rustic

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:37.200
furniture to the granite promenade it
should transform the look of the pond

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.950
for the better

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:49.950
here's an interesting observation a ripe
raspberry doesn't sink or even get wet

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.370
in water

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:59.549
there are raspberry bushes upstream and
if you throw something at the bush while

00:24:59.549 --> 00:25:04.260
sitting in the pond the water will
deliver delicious ripe berries right

00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:16.080
to you while I was enjoying the wild
berries the frog came back again and it

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:22.549
looks like it is making its own plans
about beautifying the pond

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:33.320
in conclusion I will demonstrate how to
drain the pond to prevent sludge from

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:40.789
accumulating in it during the offseason
I had to use my aluminum mallet to knock

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:52.159
the plug out lastly I decided to plug
the drain in the upstream dam so that I

00:25:52.159 --> 00:25:56.659
wouldn't upset my neighbor the beaver
but I will have to make a larger plug

00:25:56.659 --> 00:26:01.669
because I forgot that the drain pipe
here is slightly larger in diameter and

00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:07.389
the plug that I brought from the
downstream dam is too small

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:20.820
as you could see besides working on the
granite step, tending to the saplings and

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:27.560
planting new ones I spent the first week
mostly on modernizing the dam and pond

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:33.000
the only additional project I managed to
finish was to make a primitive tarp

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:42.930
hanger I'm not going to get into details
because there is a separate video where

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:55.680
I showed how to make a dome and a hanger
using branches and tarp I will have to

00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.870
say this summer I didn't get to use the
hanger because there was barely any rain

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:06.050
during my three-week stay at the log
cabin camp

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:52.009
this pile of sticks is what's left from
my stretch film dome the new hangar is

00:27:52.009 --> 00:28:00.110
standing right where the plastic wrap
dome used to be I'm quite happy with the

00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:06.610
hangar's design it efficiently protects
from the Sun and rain

00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:26.330
the blue tarp that has a straight cut is
the same tarp that was presumably torn

00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:37.100
by the Yeti this story comes from a
bushcraft mystery incident described in

00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:40.690
one of my log cabin videos

00:28:54.970 --> 00:29:06.909
I will bring my carpentry tools here to
work on projects during rainy days again

00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:11.130
this is the "mystery tear"

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:21.720
and you might have seen this green tarp
in the video about my bushcraft kayak

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:30.060
and catamaran okay
this video has gotten long and it is time

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:35.880
to say goodbye I will only add that
during my three-week stay I filmed

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:44.460
enough material to assemble a couple
more videos of this length this is Max

00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:50.310
Egorov from Saint Petersburg Russia if
you liked this video perhaps you could

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:59.820
share it with your friends let good
people watch good videos p.s. I only

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:04.500
produce one or two videos max a month
and if you don't want to miss new

00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:08.730

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:28.350
back on Advoko MAKES  p.p.s. for your
