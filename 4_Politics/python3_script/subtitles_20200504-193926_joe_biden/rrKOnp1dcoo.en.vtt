00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.950
&gt;&gt; JERRY FALWELL: Well, we have two exciting
Convos today and Friday before Fall Break.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.440
And I want to first tell you about an opportunity.
You know, Liberty’s only three hours from

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.529
Washington D.C. so we try to give our students
an opportunity to get involved in national

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.699
politics.
Penny Nance is head of Concerned Women for

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.090
America; she’s on our board; she went to
Liberty.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.660
Her daughter- is her daughter still here,
Clara?

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.680
Anyway, she’s called me this week and she
said that Yale is sending a large group of

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.020
students to protest tomorrow the appointment
of Judge Kavanagh to the Supreme Court.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:52.640
And so, she offered to pay for 150 of our
students to come up tomorrow.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.710
We agreed to match that.
We’re going to send buses for 150 more.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:04.330
So, if you want to be excused from classes
tomorrow, go to Washington, and counter what

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.840
the Yale students are doing, support Judge
Kavanagh.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.770
We’ve got 300 spots for you.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:22.150
The only bad news is you have to leave very,
very early in the morning, like 2:30, sorry.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.150
[SHOCK]

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.360
But you can sign up and get more information
at the tables at sections 109 and 110 and

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:39.250
text CWA to Liberty’s zip code 24502 to
get more information.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.640
And we hope you’ll take- we hope you’ll
take advantage of the opportunity to make

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.500
a difference in national politics tomorrow.
Today’s speaker is Candace Owens.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.250
She’s Communications Director for Turning
Point U.S.A. She’s known for her criticism

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.240
of the Democratic party.
She has guest hosted on FOX News, MSNBC, CNN.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.519
She’s amassed 560,000 Twitter followers.
She’s one of the young people that are really

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.489
making a difference in our country.
We have recent graduates like Cabot Phillips

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.019
and Hannah Sherlacher, others who have worked
with Campus Reform.

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:29.020
And us old guys might have age and wisdom,
but you guys listen to the young ones more

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:33.739
than you listen to us.
So, she’s making a difference with the new

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.489
generation in ways that us old folks can't
do.

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:45.989
But she’s- Kanye West tweeted this year
that “I love the way Candace Owens thinks,”

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.819
in response to Candace’s interaction with
protesters at the event that she was referring

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.150
to.
But please welcome to Liberty University Candace

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.840
Owens.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.530
[VIDEO]

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.549
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: Candace Owens is Turning Point
U.S.A.’s Communications Director.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.739
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: For folks who are unfamiliar
with your story, a couple of weeks ago you

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.379
were at a town hall and you confronted a Black
Lives Matter protestor, and you countered

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.049
what they were saying.
And then a day or two later Kanye West said

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.170
he liked the way you thought.
And then everything unraveled on the political

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.590
Left where they came after you.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.220
&gt;&gt; CANDACE OWENS: What’s so dangerous about
a black woman believing that she can do it

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.770
without government handouts?
What’s so dangerous about a black woman

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.079
that’s promoting independence of thought
in the black community?

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:35.719
&gt;&gt; REPORTER: Earlier this morning, friends
of this program, Charlie Kirk and Candance

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.940
Owens, were brutally harassed by far Left
protesters.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.019
They were having breakfast.

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.730
&gt;&gt; OWENS: Antifa attacked me.
This is an all-white gang that attacked me

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.489
and attacked all black police force.
I think independently. I’m a free thinker.

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:57.010
And I don’t believe that because I have
a certain skin tone that I absolutely have

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.060
to subscribe to all these ideas, which on
paper do not make any sense whatsoever.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.260
[END]

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.470
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:15.180
&gt;&gt; OWENS: Hello.
This is honestly such a blessing, I’m so

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.549
grateful to be here.
I cannot thank all of you enough for coming

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:24.260
here to hear me speak.
I want to start off by asking you guys a very

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.170
simple question.
By a show of hands, how many people in this

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.970
room have had bad things happen to them?
Everyone, okay.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.000
Everyone.
Now I’m going to ask a similar question

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.630
but it’s going to be different.
By a show of hands, how many people in this

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.670
room consider themselves a victim?
Wow, really impressive.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.000
Normally I get a few hands, and that’s really
impressive.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.200
So, the differences in these questions is
a difference in mentality.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:05.560
I have been smeared, libeled; I have been
protested. I have been kicked out of restaurants.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.140
I have been assaulted because I go around
with a very simple message, which is that

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:17.360
bad things happen to everyone, but a victim
mentality is not something that you should

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.480
possess because a bad thing happens to you.
This has earned me the title of being called

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:32.240
“Anti-Black”, “Anti-LGBT”.
I have been called a “Nazi sympathizer”

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:39.240
among other things because I have this idea
that if we don’t accept ourselves as oppressed

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:45.220
we accept ourselves as the victor of our experiences,
then we can achieve more in life.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.290
So, let me tell you a little bit about me
that you’re not going to find in all of

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.590
these articles that basically want people
to believe that I am somehow a White Supremacists,

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:58.140
which is quite impressive that I get called
a White Supremacist.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.750
I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut.
I did not-

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.750
[CHEERS]

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.960
Yes, is there some Connecticut love here?
That’s awesome.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.590
I grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, in a really
small apartment I shared with my sisters.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.320
I have two sisters.
Did not grow up- I grew up in poverty, my

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.290
family didn’t have much.
We had the exterminator coming into our apartment

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:25.250
when I was a little girl to get rid of the
roaches every week because we lived in a low-income

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.090
housing structure.
About the time that I was eight years old,

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:35.000
my grandfather decided- he came to our apartment
and he said, “I really don’t want my grandbabies

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.260
to live in this sort of a situation.”
And he moved us into his very middle-class

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.110
house.
Now, my grandfather is a very-very-very pious

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.700
man.
Living in his home meant that every single

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:52.240
morning I was meant to read the Bible.
He would pick a Scripture and me and my brothers

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.340
and sisters would sit around the table and
he would ask us questions.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:07:02.150
And based on our understanding of the Scriptures
and the Bible we would be awarded different

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.590
hot chocolate mugs in the morning.
I never really in my life thought that that

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.010
was a meaningful way to grow up.
In fact, when I was introduced to the public

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:16.420
school system I was embarrassed.
I was embarrassed about my relationship with

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:17.780
God.
I wanted it to go away.

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.590
I didn’t want people to know that my grandparents
were so Christian, that they wanted us to

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:26.030
read the Bible every morning.
That wasn’t cool. That wasn’t a cool way

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.950
to live.
And so, I shed that.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.960
I shed that, throughout most of middle school
I hid it, and in high school, I completely

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:39.940
shed it when my grandparents moved down South.
In high school I had a very unique experience

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:44.800
happen to me, which reporters and journalists
do not like to report on because it completely

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.840
disrupts their narrative that I don’t understand
that bad things happen to black people, that

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.660
I don’t understand that there’s racism
in the world and that people can be hurt by

00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:59.330
racism.
When I was in high school I was- I had a boyfriend.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.640
It was my first boyfriend. I thought I was
really cool.

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:07.000
And he and I went to watch a movie at his
house, we were watching Talladega Nights.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.190
It’s a great movie if you guys haven’t
seen it.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:13.140
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.930
For those of you that have seen it, I never
know what to do with my hands just like Ricky

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.930
Bobby.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:18.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:24.870
So, I was watching Talladega Nights and my
phone rang, and it was a blocked call, and

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:27.680
I don’t pick up blocked calls so I sent
it to voicemail.

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:29.710
My phone rang again, I sent it to voicemail
again.

00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.919
My phone rang four times.
By the time the movie was over I had four

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.629
missed voicemails, which was really an insane
thing.

00:08:35.629 --> 00:08:39.870
So, I went home and I listened to the voicemails
after a great night, and what I heard was

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:45.190
something really horrific and terrifying.
On the other end of the line there were four

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:50.580
male voices and they were alternating.
They were calling me the N-word.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.949
They were saying that they were going to put
a bullet in the back of my head as they had

00:08:53.949 --> 00:09:00.060
done to Martin Luther King.
They were calling me Rosa Parks.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.579
They were telling me that they were going
to tar and feather my family.

00:09:05.579 --> 00:09:10.170
It went on for a really intense, I would say,
five minutes.

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:14.240
And when I hung up the phone the first thing
that I did was I broke down and I cried, because

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.190
I couldn’t think of four people that would
say those words to me.

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.879
I couldn’t even think of one person that
would say those words to me.

00:09:22.879 --> 00:09:30.230
Here I am, I’m a senior in high school,
living my best life, and I get these terrible

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.230
messages.
So, I went to bed and the next morning I had

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:36.550
a class, a Philosophy class, and we happened
to be talking about racism.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:39.660
And I told my teacher, I rose my hand and
I told him what happened.

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.800
I said, “Mr. Forker, I got these terrible
messages.”

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:47.240
And I played them for him, and he was so horrified
that he said, “Get up right now, we’re

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.680
going to go to the principal and you’re
going to report these messages.”

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:57.759
The principal immediately called the police,
and that was the beginning of what would represent

00:09:57.759 --> 00:10:05.230
a very dark life- a dark period in my life.
It turned out, by some random stroke of my

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:11.870
own misfortune, that I did not know as I had
said three of those people in the car.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.730
One of those three people in the car that
night that left me those messages happened

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:20.970
to be the current Democratic Governor of Connecticut’s
son.

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:26.970
And instantly this case was elevated and my
face, a high school senior, was splashed on

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:35.559
the front pages of every newspaper in Connecticut
and in New York, calling me a “victim,”

00:10:35.559 --> 00:10:41.540
A “victim” of a hate crime.
That’s a really-really-really heavy word.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:45.570
A “victim” of a hate crime.
It turned out that one of the kids in the

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:49.730
car was a former friend of mine and I used
to hang out with him and a group of my friends

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:54.009
all the time.
And once I got a boyfriend I did what most

00:10:54.009 --> 00:10:57.649
girls do and I just wanted to be with my boyfriend
and he was hurt.

00:10:57.649 --> 00:11:02.029
And one night he got into a car and he was
drinking, and with three people that I didn’t

00:11:02.029 --> 00:11:03.910
know.
And they decided to leave me these voicemails.

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:09.990
Now of course because a politician’s son
was involved the FBI had to get involved to

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:14.161
trace the origins of the messages because
nobody wanted to come clean and say that they

00:11:14.161 --> 00:11:17.389
had left them.
So, I went from watching Talladega Nights

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:22.720
to being a front-page cover story, to being
called a victim, to having everyone in my

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:31.480
high school debate whether or not the messages
were real. Why the FBI investigated it.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:36.959
Of course, the messages were real, of course
after the FBI concluded their 6-week-long

00:11:36.959 --> 00:11:41.189
investigation they determined that I did,
in fact, receive these messages from these

00:11:41.189 --> 00:11:44.820
men, and 6 weeks later all four of them were
arrested.

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.449
The youngest person in that car was only 14
years old.

00:11:49.449 --> 00:11:54.430
And then, of course, after the entire world
was debating it, reading Letters to the Editor

00:11:54.430 --> 00:12:00.470
where people wither called me a liar, a hero,
a victim, it was over, just like that.

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:05.250
The press was over, they were ready to move
on from this situation.

00:12:05.250 --> 00:12:11.130
And that seems to be a common theme.
We’re looking for the oppressed and the

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:15.160
oppressor.
These kids were labeled “racist”, I was

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.829
labeled “victim”.
How did that turn out for me?

00:12:19.829 --> 00:12:25.360
Well for me it turned out into 4-and-a-half
years of anorexia.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:31.529
The next years of my life- that title, I was
so scared, going into college afraid that

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:34.649
people that I was meeting were going to Google
me and they were going to find this story,

00:12:34.649 --> 00:12:37.971
that they were going to find that I was a
victim, that they were going to think that

00:12:37.971 --> 00:12:41.319
I somehow started this or I deserved it, or
they were going to take a side in the same

00:12:41.319 --> 00:12:44.009
way that the people in my town had taken a
side.

00:12:44.009 --> 00:12:47.550
The only way that I felt that I could assert
control over myself and over my narrative

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:55.420
was through having anorexia.
It took 4-and-a-half years of me having an

00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:59.850
eating disorder before something woke up in
me.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.119
I was living in Manhattan, I was paying down
student loans.

00:13:03.119 --> 00:13:07.819
I went to school and I majored in, quite ironically,
journalism, something that I don’t believe

00:13:07.819 --> 00:13:13.369
in as much today.
And I began to take yoga classes.

00:13:13.369 --> 00:13:20.329
And I had lived a life partying throughout
college, drinking, really had fallen far from

00:13:20.329 --> 00:13:25.499
the girl that sat at the kitchen table with
her grandfather reading the Bible.

00:13:25.499 --> 00:13:30.860
My friends said, “Let’s take a yoga class.”
I went to yoga class, and suddenly that silence,

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:35.279
that mediation, you know, the prayer that
people have, I really for the first time in

00:13:35.279 --> 00:13:38.210
a really long time was able to have conversations
with myself.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.699
“Candace, what are you doing?”
You know?

00:13:41.699 --> 00:13:45.339
“Why are you doing this?
Why are you living this life?”

00:13:45.339 --> 00:13:49.170
Are you happy?”
The answer of course was I was not happy.

00:13:49.170 --> 00:13:59.110
I wasn’t happy being a victim; I was miserable.
I was allowing it to eat me alive.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:03.319
I was able to meditate my way- and people
say, “How did you get over your anorexia?”

00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:05.040
Mediation.
Yoga.

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.929
I was able to meditate myself back into health
with conversations, and prayer, and focus.

00:14:11.929 --> 00:14:17.279
And here’s what I discovered.
What happened to me in high school didn’t

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:21.689
just happened to me, it happened to the four
kids that left those terrible messages.

00:14:21.689 --> 00:14:28.889
Because a 14-year-old, a 15-year-old, a person
that was my former friend, they can't be racist.

00:14:28.889 --> 00:14:33.610
That’s a heavy word.
That’s a really heavy word.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:39.220
What they were young kids that were trying
out what it was like to be mean in a generation

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.760
that has smartphones, in a generation that
can send text messages, can send Facebook

00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:48.769
and Instagram messages around the world in
a matter of nanoseconds, something that the

00:14:48.769 --> 00:14:52.740
adults that had raised us had never experienced
before in their lives.

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.929
We are the “LOL” generation.
When I was a little girl my dad had a beeper.

00:14:57.929 --> 00:15:02.670
He didn’t have Twitter, there was no Facebook,
there was no Instagram.

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:08.010
And parents and teachers never thought about
how that might impact us growing up when you

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:11.500
no longer have to look at someone to just
be mean.

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.579
When you can just say a mean tweet, leave
a mean comment.

00:15:14.579 --> 00:15:21.019
It’s so easy in this generation to be mean.
And I thought to myself, “Wow, imagine if

00:15:21.019 --> 00:15:26.350
as opposed to calling me a victim, which ruined
4-and-a-half years of my life, as opposed

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:32.910
to calling children racists, which I’m sure
ruined years of their lives, what if the adults

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:42.550
in this situation tried to pause and actually
understand how everybody was impacted.

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:46.320
What if the adults tried to understand what
it’s like being a kid coming up in this

00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:54.089
generation, how easy it was for us to be mean?
What if the politician just made his son say,

00:15:54.089 --> 00:15:56.569
“Sorry”?
No one says sorry anymore, that seems to be

00:15:56.569 --> 00:16:02.519
going out style because people are constantly
trying to get away with everything.

00:16:02.519 --> 00:16:06.379
I was angry with God for a lot of things in
my life.

00:16:06.379 --> 00:16:10.200
I was angry that I didn’t grow up in a family
that had any money, I was angry that I had

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:17.559
$150,000 in student loan debt, and no degree.
I had to drop out because Sallie Mae collapsed

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:20.119
and I couldn’t get my loan in my senior
year.

00:16:20.119 --> 00:16:26.730
I was angry with God because I had this horrific
situation happen in high school, and I was

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:29.259
a victim and he allowed that to happen to
me.

00:16:29.259 --> 00:16:33.660
That was my mentality.
Then all of a sudden, I had a different perspective,

00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:38.019
and this perspective changed my life.
And it’s what I try to tell everybody that

00:16:38.019 --> 00:16:41.660
is going through something bad.
Whether you believe it or not is up to you,

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:45.629
but I can tell you that it transformed my
life.

00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:54.639
I believe that God picks people to have experiences
in their life, the good ones and the bad ones.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:17:02.090
I believe that God wanted me to have my parents.
I believe that my God wanted me to grow up

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:09.130
in a house that was dysfunctional.
I think that he wanted me to grow up impoverished.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:15.740
He wanted me to go through a hate crime, as
it was classified, in high school.

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:22.089
Because whose better positioned to attack
the Left’s narrative than somebody who has

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:32.490
lived through all of that?
In 2017- in early 2017 I had such an interesting

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:37.559
moment.
I was still drinking, and suddenly after a

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:42.840
night of drinking I woke up in the morning
and I just broke down crying.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:46.740
It was the most bazaar thing, nothing happened.
There was nothing eventful that happened.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:50.960
I broke down crying and I said to someone
close to me, “I have this feeling,” and

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:56.710
it was the first time that I had said that
God wanted me to do something, “that God

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.590
wants me to quit drinking.”
Just like that I just quit drinking because

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:07.980
I broke down crying in a room and had a sense
that God wanted me not to poison my body anymore,

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:13.549
that he wanted to be able to open the universe
up to me in a way that it had never been opened

00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:19.450
up to me.
I quit drinking and I uploaded my first YouTube

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:23.650
video which was called “Mom, Dad, I’m
a Conservative”.

00:18:23.650 --> 00:18:32.559
What happened next, I could have never predicted.
My third video got 26 million views worldwide.

00:18:32.559 --> 00:18:37.750
It was me attacking the narrative that CNN
was trying to sell to me after, which I’m

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:42.980
sure you guys remember here in Virginia, the
Charlottesville debacle.

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:49.409
CNN when I went home was trying to sell to
me as a black American that the KKK was alive

00:18:49.409 --> 00:18:53.680
and well, that a real fear that I have to
have walking down in the street is that a

00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.799
guy on horseback and a white hood is going
to come because we didn’t vote for Hilary

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:01.530
Clinton.
And I said this is ridiculous.

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:06.150
Honestly, we’ve had enough of this narrative,
it’s time for someone to be a voice in the

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.830
black community.
And I just started ranting.

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:16.510
I always call it, what I did for 4-and-a-half
minutes was a Kanye-rant.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:23.750
I challenged Americans to believe their experiences
versus what they see coming out of their T.V.

00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:31.899
screens, because what I see is that I grow
up- I grew up in a country that is not racist.

00:19:31.899 --> 00:19:37.610
I grew up in a country that is diverse, I
grew up in a country that has given opportunities

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:42.740
to so many people, including myself, to be
able to start from humble beginnings and to

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:48.860
use my voice and to be able to share it.
Tell me in what other country in the world

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:55.390
do people have those sorts of opportunities
that they could flip open a laptop, Kanye-rant

00:19:55.390 --> 00:20:06.750
for four minutes, and reach 26-million homes?
I attack a lot of narratives on T.V.

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:12.539
I’m so for those of you guys who follow
me on Twitter you see that I am going after-

00:20:12.539 --> 00:20:20.919
I go for the jugular a lot about tons of things.
I speak out against Feminism because it’s

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:26.471
not Feminism.
What’s happening today is a radical form

00:20:26.471 --> 00:20:32.720
of a women’s moment, the idea that we don’t
need men, that men are always and constantly,

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:39.770
once again, the oppressed versus the oppressor.
I have news for people that do identify themselves

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:45.870
as Feminists, men are not dropped off by the
stork.

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:51.350
They are born, we are the people that have
to carry men for nine months.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.159
They are our little boys, they are our sons,
they are our husbands.

00:20:55.159 --> 00:21:01.350
The idea that somebody can live a life in
the way that Brett Kavanagh has lived his

00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:06.860
life, and to have what has happened to him
over these last couple of weeks happen to

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:13.710
him should terrify everyone.
This country needs due process, but beyond

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:19.760
that, this country needs women to find their
voices and to fight for our men.

00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:27.730
Because what is happening right now is a cultural
war on men.

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:32.350
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:36.560
Quite controversially I also speak out against
Planned Parenthood, and I know-

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:46.100
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.139
In school, I learned that choice was good.
The word ‘choice’ is good.

00:21:50.139 --> 00:21:54.720
The Left is incredibly good at linguistics.
“Planned Parenthood” – that sounds nice.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.850
I want to plan my parenthood.
But in reality, they’re murdering babies.

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:02.440
“Choice” – choice is good.
I want choices.

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:07.130
But in reality, one of those choices is to
murder.

00:22:07.130 --> 00:22:10.710
When I looked into Planned Parenthood and
the history of eugenics and the fact that

00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:16.090
is was founded by a woman who quite literally
said that black people need to be exterminated

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:21.820
like weeds, when I looked into the numbers
and understood that 900 black babies are aborted

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:29.580
every single day, and yet CNN wants me to
pay attention and be upset and enraged and

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:35.789
to boycott and to protest for the 16 unarmed
black men that are shot and killed by police

00:22:35.789 --> 00:22:43.540
per year?
No voice for the 18 million black babies that

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.700
are ripped from the wombs of their parents
since 1973, that’s acceptable.

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:53.160
They’ve branded that as okay murder.
That is the focus that I try to deliver to

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:59.090
the black community to understand that our
population growth has stagnated, and it is

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:07.630
due to the fact that we are being taught to
murder our children.

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:12.210
That has labeled me as somebody that’s controversial.
“She doesn’t believe in Planned Parenthood.”

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:17.130
I tell you what else I don’t believe in,
I don’t believe in the welfare system.

00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:19.290
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:27.049
You know, I make strong statements and I say
that I don’t believe in the welfare system

00:23:27.049 --> 00:23:31.850
because I look at what it has earned people
that have gone on to the welfare system.

00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:38.380
Absolutely nothing.
Since LBJ put in place The Great Society Act,

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:45.919
which he referred to as the N-word Bill, it
has completely decimated our communities.

00:23:45.919 --> 00:23:52.500
A question that I’ve always asked myself,
and I’ve had this conversation with my partner

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:57.350
Charlie Kirk, is why is it that the Left mocks
God?

00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:59.850
It’s a weird thing.
Like, you know, there’s a lot of things

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:04.470
you can make fun of, but it’s very weird
when you start making fun of Jesus Christ

00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:10.320
and that becomes normal.
When Joy Behar is just openly mocking Christian

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:18.470
on The View when they're openly mocking the
fact that our Vice President Mike Pence has

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:26.259
respect for his wife and believes in Jesus
Christ, why would they do that?

00:24:26.259 --> 00:24:30.080
The welfare system is an interesting study
as to why.

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:38.500
My belief is that the Left wants to grow government.
It wants government in many ways to replace

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.470
God is people’s lives.
It wants people to turn to government for

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:48.169
solutions, for every solution.
Someone had told me that, “Hey, Candance

00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:53.029
the argument for Pro-Choice is that Planned
Parenthood also does a lot of great things.”

00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:56.919
And I’m sure that’s true.
You know, they supply birth control pills

00:24:56.919 --> 00:25:02.480
and they conduct mammograms, and women can
go there for other health concerns.

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:07.519
And I say that’s really great, but they
are also murdering people.

00:25:07.519 --> 00:25:18.720
There is no justification for murdering people.
How do we get to a point in society where

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:28.230
people understand the value of a human life
if we don’t have people boldly and courageously

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:33.820
standing up and speaking out against these
systems which are meant to make us place so

00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:38.160
much faith in the government?
So much faith that the government can fix

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:45.210
all of our issues, so much faith that the
government understands how many human lives

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:57.280
are worth being born, how do we reverse that?
Every single person in here, I believe, has

00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:05.039
had a series of experiences that are prompting
them to do something great in this world.

00:26:05.039 --> 00:26:10.279
At the moment that you believe in yourself,
at the moment that you get back to your center,

00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:15.780
that you align yourself with the universe,
with God, the universe will open itself up

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:18.470
to you.
It certainly did for me.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:21.139
Maybe not every person is going to do what
I did.

00:26:21.139 --> 00:26:27.269
Maybe not every person is going to quit their
job and decide that they’re going to make

00:26:27.269 --> 00:26:32.370
YouTube videos.
But make no mistake, there is a cultural war

00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:37.289
happening and every single one of you can
do something and participate in it in some

00:26:37.289 --> 00:26:42.299
regard.
My focus obviously has been on presenting

00:26:42.299 --> 00:26:48.450
a new perspective to the black community.
I think we are in desperate need of new voices

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.380
in the black community.
We are in desperate need of somebody that

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.590
will stand on a platform and say, hey, it’s
actually not cool to be a victim.

00:26:55.590 --> 00:27:00.990
There’s no value in being a victim.
You win no awards for being a victim unless

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:06.870
you’re Colin Kaepernick.

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:08.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.380
I think he made a pretty sweet deal off of
being a victim, so credit to him where credit

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:17.580
is due.
But the message that he is selling to people,

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:21.750
of course, is not going to get them anywhere.
At the moment that you believe that you can’t,

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:27.230
you won't.
At the moment that you believe that you can,

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:34.150
you will.
Why is that controversial?

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.940
Why wouldn’t the Left want to tell the truth
about, that I stand on this stage and I tell

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.010
people all across the country that I believe
in them?

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:45.169
That’s what I’m saying.
Every time I stand on a stage in a room at

00:27:45.169 --> 00:27:48.820
a university, at a college, I say, “Hey
guys, I believe you.

00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:54.159
I believe in you.
You can do it without government handouts.

00:27:54.159 --> 00:27:58.440
You can do it based off of good ideas.
You can do it based off of hard work.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:04.580
You can do it with Jesus Christ.”

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:08.970
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:14.970
Of course, if every single person in the world
thought that, if every single person in the

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:18.670
world woke up with confidence and said, “I
can do it and I can contribute.

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:24.520
And my life, my birth has meant something,
it means something to this world and I’m

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:31.419
going to contribute something,” you would
see, naturally, that government would shrink.

00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:37.269
That when people are faced with problems they
wouldn’t run to an arbitrary welfare system,

00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:41.470
they would turn to God, they would turn to
their communities, and they would nurse themselves

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:45.040
back to health.
That’s what you would see.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.029
And that is why I believe in my heart that
I have been considered a threat to the Left

00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:57.950
and to the establishment.
Kanye West, man, he’s a wonderful man.

00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:59.250
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:06.990
It’s so great to look back at everything
now and of remember his song Jesus Walks.

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:09.500
How many of you guys know that song?

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.010
[CHEERS]

00:29:11.010 --> 00:29:16.539
And he made that song- he made that Hip Hop
song because people told him that he couldn’t

00:29:16.539 --> 00:29:18.549
talk about Jesus and he couldn’t make Jesus
cool.

00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:23.299
So, he made it a number one album.
He made it a number one track talking about

00:29:23.299 --> 00:29:28.330
Jesus and felling that Jesus was walking with
him in what he was doing.

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:33.940
The gift of Kanye West isn’t because he
is one of the biggest stars in the world.

00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:37.519
The gift of Kanye West in that simple seven-word
tweet.

00:29:37.519 --> 00:29:42.399
That broke the internet, “I love the way
Candace Owens thinks,” is that he opened

00:29:42.399 --> 00:29:46.610
people’s hearts and people’s minds to
a different perspective.

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:55.000
The gift of Kanye West putting on the MAGA
hat was that it completely destroyed the narrative.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.950
I love Donald Trump.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:06.910
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:14.260
First and foremost, he’s pointedly hilarious.
I actually genuinely feel bad that there are

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:17.900
people that are not enjoying Donald Trump
in office.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:23.950
Like I just- I don’t understand how they
don’t understand how hilarious Donald Trump

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:27.129
is.
Aside from that, he’s an unbelievably strong

00:30:27.129 --> 00:30:32.650
leader, to stand in the face of the entire
United Nation’s assembly yesterday and to

00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:41.120
stay that America will be governed by Americans
and not by globalists.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.490
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:52.659
What is that President Donald Trump, Kanye
West, Candance Owens have in common that we

00:30:52.659 --> 00:30:58.690
have grown so fond of each other?
I think Kanye West describes it as “dragon

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:04.140
energy”.
And to me, I think it’s individualism.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:09.450
It’s believing in yourself.
It’s standing up in the face of everybody

00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:13.110
telling you can't.
“You’re not allowed to think that - you’re

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.529
a black man!
You can't think that.”

00:31:15.529 --> 00:31:17.730
“You’re not allowed to think that - you’re
not a woman.”

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:21.899
“You have to think this because you’re
a woman.”

00:31:21.899 --> 00:31:27.419
It’s standing up in the face of all of that
and saying no, I am my own person.

00:31:27.419 --> 00:31:35.759
I am governed by what I believe to be the
truth, and I can live up to any expectation

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:42.429
that I set for myself.
I think that is an energy, that is a love,

00:31:42.429 --> 00:31:47.909
and that is a passion that I hope that I work
every day to share with the world.

00:31:47.909 --> 00:32:03.669
Thank you guys so much for having me.

00:32:03.669 --> 00:32:17.940
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.120
&gt;&gt; DAVID NASSER: Candace is probably one of
our most requested guests.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.450
And obviously, you can see why.
I think today’s lunch at the Rot will have

00:32:22.450 --> 00:32:26.700
some very interesting conversations that you
started for us today.

00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:32.190
And I do believe- I do believe that you’ll
carry the conversation like you did here.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:38.499
I love that we can come in a room and always,
always hear each other and then it’ll hopefully

00:32:38.499 --> 00:32:42.340
help us grow as individuals.
Can we thank her just one more time for being

00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:46.429
here?
Very busy person, thankful for you.

00:32:46.429 --> 00:32:47.429
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:47.429 --> 00:32:50.419
Hey, tonight- tonight at campus community
we’re going to talk about some of the things

00:32:50.419 --> 00:32:55.090
that Candace even touched on.
But I do want to say this to you, Candance

00:32:55.090 --> 00:33:01.159
touched on anorexia and Candace touched on
a few other things that might be a bit of

00:33:01.159 --> 00:33:07.230
a personal issue for you, even sexual harassment.
If you are a victim in the sense that someone

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:13.471
has invaded your life or has hurt you in some
sense, or if you struggle with anorexia, just

00:33:13.471 --> 00:33:18.460
know that our Shepherd’s department is always
open and available to minister to you and

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.380
that they’re always at Dorm 17 and available,
all right?

00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.200
We love you, we care about you.
We’ll see you tonight at Campus Com, 6:30.
