00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.190
First class air travel has often been
a playground for the rich and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.510
famous. On a first class flight from
New York to Dubai on Emirates

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.560
Airlines, wealthy passengers can sleep
in private suites that feature

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:18.520
floor-to-ceiling sliding doors, relax in
the Airbus A380's shower spa

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.350
and drink limited edition champagne
while eating mounds of caviar.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.010
If you wanted to book that roundtrip
flight on Emirates at the last

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.340
minute, it could cost
you over $23,000.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.190
Flying to Mumbai from New York?

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.270
Etihad Airways offers a three-room
luxury suite called The Residence,

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.630
which features a private bathroom, a
private living room and a

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:40.710
personal butler.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.540
Flying roundtrip on Etihad for that
flight could be over $36,000.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.460
And, for about $3,000 on an
American Airlines Flagship First flight

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.480
from New York to Los Angeles,
travelers have access to an exclusive

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.970
check-in area and premium wines
in the flagship lounge.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.830
While airlines make a significant amount
of money packing people into

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.420
coach like cattle, premium cabins like
business and first class are

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.550
still a major source
of income for U.S.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.990
carriers. The U.S.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.220
airlines are doing
quite well, frankly.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.110
Their margins range from the
mid-single digits to the mid-teens

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.560
presently. Delta has been the
leader for quite some time.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.380
So why are first
class tickets so expensive?

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.940
And who is paying for them?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.810
And with changes in technology
and environmental issues at the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.800
forefront. Will the first class airplane
ticket even be around the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.990
next 20 years?

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.070
The world's first passenger airline
started service on January 1st,

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.820
1914 between St Petersburg
and Tampa, Florida.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.410
It lasted only a few months and only
flew in good weather but set the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.720
stage for the future
of passenger travel.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.070
Around that time, airplanes were
flying mostly mail and passenger

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.030
service was virtually non-existent.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.370
With big improvements in aircraft
performance and aviation technology

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.810
in the 20s, 30s and 40s, passenger
service took root and started to

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.060
expand. Before the 1950s,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.450
everyone who flew flew first class
because it was the same service

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.800
for everybody on the airplane.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.930
The vast majority of people who
flew were affluent, mostly male,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.620
mostly business people who are
flying for business purposes.

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.980
But, the end of World War II brought
about a big change to the air

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.990
travel industry. What happens is after
World War II, there are lots

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.060
and lots of surplus
airplanes out there.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.200
And there are a number of
veterans in particular who wanted to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.050
continue to fly, to
make money from flying.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.920
New carriers called non-scheduled
airlines, similar to charter

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.520
flights began appearing, posing a
direct threat to the existing

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.350
airlines that were
heavily regulated.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.820
Working together gave non-scheduled airlines
the ability to offer

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.650
lower prices on cross-country trips,
pressuring existing carriers to

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.000
drop their fees.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.570
To attract the tourist class, the
existing airlines came up with a

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.930
pricing structure of different
costs for different seats.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.670
Eventually, the airlines work with
the CAB to essentially undermine

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.190
the non-sked's by creating a
tiered passenger ticketing system where

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.060
you would have first class and coach,
that would be closer to the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.230
prices that were offered by the
non-sked's to attract the middle

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.400
class folks.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.390
By the end of the 50s,
with improvements in technology, airplanes

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.730
moved from the piston
engine to jet engines.

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.290
The bigger Boeing 707 allowed
airlines to reconfigure their cabins,

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.620
giving more amenities and space
to first class fliers.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.560
In January 1970, Pan Am flew the Boeing
747 for the first time on a

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.030
flight from New York to London.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.380
The double decker plane known as the
Queen of the Skies, featured a

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.190
restaurant with luxury services
for first class passengers.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.380
The introduction of the 747 really took
first class to a whole other

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.060
level, very premium service with yes,
a lounge, a bartender, they

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:12.080
called it a piano bar, it was
actually an organ but you had live

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.850
music on these flights.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.740
And deregulation in the 1970's may have
had an even bigger impact on

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:24.410
the airlines. In 1978, the
Airline Deregulation Act removed some

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.100
government controls, giving the airlines
more say over the services

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.530
they offer and the
fees they could charge.

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.310
Well, business class comes
about because of deregulation.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.240
The airlines now can compete any
way they want to compete.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.500
And with the rise in the business
class, airlines look to offer even

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.490
better services to attract high
paying first class customers.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.680
For example, in the mid-1990s,
British Airways introduced fully

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.560
reclining seats into their
first class cabins.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.600
American carriers later followed with their
version of the flat bed

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.660
seat. American Airlines generally follow
the lead of others.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.890
They will pioneer technology
like they computerized reservation

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.600
systems. But in terms of service
and amenities, the United States

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.810
generally follows the lead of what
happens elsewhere in the world.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:20.120
Then, in the 90s and 2000s,
the airlines faced additional competition

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.180
for first class customers
from private jet companies.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.480
If you've got your own plane or
your corporate plane, you don't have

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.250
to go through the security hassle.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.320
The airlines and the airports then have
to try and answer that with a

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.220
better experience, not only in the airport,
but in the air for these

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.570
folks to keep them flying commercial
rather than shifting to private.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.250
U.S. legacy carriers, Delta Air
Lines, United Airlines and American

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.070
Airlines make a lot of their money
at the front of the plane,

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.510
specifically, according to analysts, selling
business class and first

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:59.990
class tickets on long
haul premium heavy flights.

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.440
In August 2019, more than 6.4

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.820
million people flew in premium seats
on North American flights, about

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.650
nine percent of the total
67 million seats occupied.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:15.350
But why are some
premium seats so expensive?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.680
The airlines are getting much
more sophisticated and they're getting

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.310
to the point where they can charge
just the amount of money it needs

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.050
to fill those seats.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.620
That's how they make their money.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.620
It's butts in seats.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.760
The airlines use a strategy
called airline revenue management to

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.350
maximize profitability.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.130
Essentially prioritizing passengers
based on fares.

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.670
So airline revenue management, this is
how airlines make their money.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.970
This is how they know whether to
charge a business traveler a lot for

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.500
a seat for a last minute flight.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.370
Airlines use algorithms to try to find
out the most that they can get

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:52.430
out of passengers. Business travelers,
for example, tend to book

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:55.520
their tickets at the last minute,
giving airlines the ability to

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.870
charge more. They can make more money
selling a last minute ticket to

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.280
a business person than they can
for people who are booking for

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.310
leisure travel. For people who are
booking for leisure travel, they

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.630
shop for those tickets.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.020
For the business traveler, though, especially
the one who is flying

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.040
at the last minute.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:14.840
They don't have that luxury.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:17.030
There's a seat. Here's the price.

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:20.810
They pay it. But even though airlines
can make a hefty profit on

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.920
first class travelers.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.200
Not everyone pays the full price.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.510
First class has changed a
lot over the years.

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.890
So airlines, including Delta, has actually
said we used to give away

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.010
almost all of our first class seats,
they were free upgrades to some

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:35.270
of their most loyal customers.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.820
And that's been one of the big
changes we've made in our marketing

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.480
strategy over the last
number of years.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.900
You know first class, we used to
get first class away to just about

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.350
everybody and our loyalty arrangements but
today we sell about 50

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:46.410
percent of first class seats.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:50.120
They'll give away about 50 percent
in terms of loyalty upgrades, but

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.650
about 50 percent is sold.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.700
In 2018,

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:57.050
premium class travelers made up only a
handful of the total number of

00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.380
international origin-destination passengers
at 5.2

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:03.920
percent, according to the
International Air Transport Association.

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.490
But they accounted for a big
chunk, nearly a third of airline

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:14.290
revenue. Industry consolidation and
a strong economy in

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:17.380
recent years has allowed the airlines
to invest in more fuel

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.890
efficient planes with better cabins
focusing on those premium

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:25.960
classes. In 2008, Northwest Airlines
merged with Delta Air Lines.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:30.280
In 2010, Continental Airlines merged
with United Airlines and in

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.660
2013, U.S.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.930
Airways and American Airlines
parent AMR merged.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:37.210
Since the economy is pretty good,
airlines are putting a lot of

00:08:37.210 --> 00:08:39.630
resources into improving those
business class cabins.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.950
They're putting in these suites
that have sliding doors, they're

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.530
improving their food and they really
need to compete with the

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.770
international carriers, which have had
a pretty plush product to

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.940
begin with. In addition to a few
other big markets, American has its

00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.540
Flagship First program for first
class and business travelers from

00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.430
New York to Los Angeles, that
offers quick passage through security,

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:02.230
a first class lounge
and lie flat seats.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.220
The Delta One service is available
on long haul international flights

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.380
and in select long
haul domestic markets.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.860
It offers a 180 degree flat bed
seat with a full height door.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:16.930
And United, offers their premium
transcontinental service that has a

00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:20.350
fully flat bed with more than six
feet of sleeping space and a

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.460
fifteen inch monitor.

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.480
Those cabins are the
face of the airline.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.040
Even though most passengers can't
afford them, the expensive first

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:32.410
class suites entice travelers to rack
up loyalty points for a chance

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.530
to fly up front.

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:37.930
And those premium services have been good
for the bottom line of U.S.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.130
legacy carriers.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.510
Airlines in the U.S.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.090
at least are headed to their
tenth year of profitability it's the

00:09:43.090 --> 00:09:45.170
longest stretch that we
know on record.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.690
For its quarter ended June 2019,
Delta announced operating revenue of

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:54.210
$12.5 billion dollars, $1 billion
higher than the previous year.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.640
According to the company, the revenue
hike included a ten percent

00:09:57.730 --> 00:10:00.480
increase in premium
product ticket revenue.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.660
And in the quarter ended September
2019, Delta had revenue from their

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:09.880
main cabin of $6 billion and
an additional $4 billion from their

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.860
business, cabin and
premium products.

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.670
American and United did not report
the amount they make from their

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.810
various cabins. CNBC reached out to
both airlines to request this

00:10:19.810 --> 00:10:23.020
revenue breakdown, but they declined to
share this data with us.

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.930
On a plane, every square inch is
valuable real estate and first class

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.780
seats take up a lot of space.

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:34.010
With improvements to business class

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:37.460
in recent years, there's been a
shift by some airlines away from

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.570
first class cabins.

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:42.860
Traditionally, the first class cabin has
been the home of the 180

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:47.000
degree flat bed seat, while business
class passengers had to contend

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.830
with adjustable head
and foot rests.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:53.600
But in January 2000, British Airways
announced they would offer a

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.980
full, flat bed in business class on
their London to New York route.

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.540
First class is now internationally become
the sort of hybrid of first

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:06.350
and business class and airlines, United,
Delta, American have kind of

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:07.950
collapsed the two.

00:11:07.950 --> 00:11:11.900
And low cost carrier, JetBlue, is also
trying to grab a slice of the

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:12.990
business class market.

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:17.210
In April 2019, JetBlue said it
intends to start multiple daily

00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:21.020
flights from New York to London, flying
the long range version of the

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:25.220
Airbus A321, which will include
its premiere service called Mint.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.030
That's JetBlue's version of business class,
except tends to be much

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:30.620
cheaper than the competition.

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.830
The price of business class seats
has come down, and that's partly

00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:37.250
because of airlines like JetBlue
that have cheaper products out

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.130
there. And then there's business
class little brother premium

00:11:40.130 --> 00:11:43.250
economy. There's actually a new class of
service, at least new to the

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:46.190
American carriers that's called premium economy,
it's sort of like a

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:47.430
business class junior.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.480
And that's for people who can't
afford maybe business class and the

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.440
lie flat seat. According to Skyscanner,
a premium economy ticket is

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.250
about 65 percent less than the
price of a business class ticket.

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.030
Changes in technology and environmental
concerns also pose a

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.710
challenge to first class travel.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:11.780
Today, private jets fly faster and
longer distances than ever before.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.530
Instead of spending tens of thousands
of dollars on first class

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:18.680
commercial tickets, companies now have
the option to charter a

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.340
private jet or use fractional
ownership, where several unrelated

00:12:22.340 --> 00:12:24.710
parties share in the
purchase of an airplane.

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.190
Several companies sell part ownership
of private business jets,

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:31.580
including Netjets owned by
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:36.400
There is that one percent, that segment
of the market for whom the

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:39.710
private jet is just
the ultimate convenience.

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.360
You can fly when you want.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.450
It is essentially all
first class service.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.960
Changing technology could also impact
the decision on whether

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.380
companies decide to purchase a pricey
first class ticket in the first

00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:55.910
place. Why fly thousands of miles
to distant places when Skype, Zoom

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.450
or virtual reality will do?

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:01.190
And for companies trying to
burnish their green credentials, flying

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.670
first class might be bad
publicity and bad for business.

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.940
Airlines are deeply challenged
by climate change.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:10.070
They are the big emitters.

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.700
The automobile market is
moving to electric cars.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.420
There is no electric airplane out
there, according to the Air

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:18.650
Transport Action Group.

00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:22.550
About two percent of human
induced carbon dioxide emissions worldwide

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:23.990
come from air travel.

00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:27.740
And people who fly first class
have a bigger carbon footprint than

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:28.880
the average passenger.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:32.330
As much as seven times as
large, according to the World Bank.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.840
But even though airlines are decreasing
the amount of space they are

00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:39.500
allocating for first class
travelers, carriers including Delta,

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.210
United and American,

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.350
for the time being, have found
big profits in premium cabin services.

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.080
It's not about maximizing the amount
of revenue on a plane, it's

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.840
about optimizing the plane, getting the
price points right, and then

00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.330
getting the seat and configurations to
match what you're trying to

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:53.600
sell.
