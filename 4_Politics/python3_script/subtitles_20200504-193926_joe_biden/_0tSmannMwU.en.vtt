00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.533
Male Speaker: Let us pray.

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:07.767
We confess to you, all knowing God, what we are.

00:00:07.767 --> 00:00:10.066
We are sometimes not the people we like ourselves

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.967
to think that we are.

00:00:11.967 --> 00:00:15.500
We have at times failed to be a people whose actions measure

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.900
up to our words.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.533
We've been called to love our neighbor, as we love ourselves,

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:25.200
we are humbled by the love demonstrated by these men,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.800
the valor 24 of whom we honor today.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.300
From World War II to Korea and Vietnam, you'll hear stories

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.867
woven into a heroic hole, you remind us that although we may

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:41.867
be different in many ways, we are alike in the most important

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:46.367
of ways, we are American soliders.

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:49.867
Today we celebrate a legacy which isnpires our service.

00:00:49.867 --> 00:00:55.600
Grant unto us the decncy of purpose, steadfast of resvole,

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.467
and strength and will which these men posessed.

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:03.200
Fill us with courage, with humility, and we may follow

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.000
their path, that our spiritual God, that we may never

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.500
forget that the highest
appreciation

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.400
is not to utter words,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.767
but to become a model of what we advocate.

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:19.767
We pray and ask your holy name, amen.

00:01:19.767 --> 00:01:23.233
The President: Good
afternoon, everybody.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:24.233
Please be seated.

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:31.033
Well, welcome to
the White House.

00:01:31.033 --> 00:01:38.200
The presentation of our
nation's highest military

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.600
decoration -- the Medal
of Honor --

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.500
is always a special occasion.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.500
But today, it is
truly historic.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.200
This is the single largest
group of service members

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.567
to be awarded the Medal
of Honor

00:01:55.567 --> 00:01:58.734
since the Second World War.

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:02.166
And with several of these
soldiers recognized for

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.133
their valor during that
war,

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:09.033
this ceremony is 70 years in the making.

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.300
As one family member
has said,

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.300
this is long overdue.

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:18.166
Many of these families --
and I had a chance to meet

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:22.600
all of them who are
present here today --

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.734
they've known these
stories

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:26.667
of heroism for decades.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:29.533
Still, they were pretty
surprised when we called

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:31.867
them to break the news
about the Medal of Honor.

00:02:31.867 --> 00:02:33.266
Some of them thought
it was a prank.

00:02:33.266 --> 00:02:34.266
(laughter)

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:40.233
Some of them
thought it was a scam.

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:43.233
A few of them thought it
might be some trick

00:02:43.233 --> 00:02:44.266
to get their credit card number.

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:51.500
(laughter)

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.700
When I called
Melvin Morris --

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.967
who we'll recognize in a moment
for his actions in Vietnam --

00:02:56.967 --> 00:02:59.266
his first reaction was,
"Oh, my God,

00:02:59.266 --> 00:03:02.266
what have I done?"

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:03.266
(laughter)

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:04.867
When I told him
it was all good --

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:09.233
the Medal of Honor -- I could
hear through the phone,

00:03:09.233 --> 00:03:11.266
he almost passed out.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:12.266
(laughter)

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:14.567
You see, for
their gallantry under fire

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:16.533
each of these soldiers was
long ago

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:21.767
recognized with the Army's
second-highest award --

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.867
the Distinguished Service Cross.

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:27.567
But ask their fellow
veterans, ask their

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:29.533
families, and they'll
tell

00:03:29.533 --> 00:03:32.934
you that their extraordinary
deeds merited

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:35.533
the highest recognition.

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:37.767
And today, we have the
chance

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:40.967
to set the record straight.

00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:44.367
This ceremony reminds us
of one of the enduring

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:48.333
qualities that makes
America great --

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:50.567
that makes us exceptional.

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:52.834
No nation is perfect,
but here in America

00:03:52.834 --> 00:03:56.300
we confront our imperfections
and face a sometimes

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.133
painful past -- including
the truth that some

00:03:59.133 --> 00:04:02.834
of these soldiers fought, and
died, for a country

00:04:02.834 --> 00:04:07.433
that did not always
see them as equal.

00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:10.066
So with each generation we
keep on striving to live

00:04:10.066 --> 00:04:13.166
up to our ideals of
freedom and equality,

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:16.600
and to recognize the dignity
and patriotism of every

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.900
person, no matter who they
are, what they look like,

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.900
or how they pray.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.133
And that's why, more than
a decade ago, Congress

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:29.066
mandated a review to make
sure that the heroism

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:31.266
of our veterans wasn't
overlooked because

00:04:31.266 --> 00:04:35.333
of prejudice or
discrimination.

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:38.700
Our military reviewed
thousands of war records.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.967
They teamed up with
veterans groups and

00:04:40.967 --> 00:04:43.767
museums to get this right.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:46.066
It was painstaking work,
made even harder because

00:04:46.066 --> 00:04:49.033
sometimes our service
members felt as if they

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:52.433
needed to change their
last names to fit in.

00:04:52.433 --> 00:04:55.600
That tells a story
about our past.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.266
But, ultimately, after
years of review,

00:04:57.266 --> 00:05:01.700
these two dozen soldiers --
among them Hispanic,

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.967
African American and Jewish
veterans -- were

00:05:04.967 --> 00:05:10.133
identified as having
earned the Medal of Honor.

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:12.367
This is the length to
which America will

00:05:12.367 --> 00:05:15.166
go to make sure everyone who
serves under our proud

00:05:15.166 --> 00:05:20.367
flag receives the thanks
that they deserve.

00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:23.800
So this is going to
be a long ceremony.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.867
We're going to read all 24
citations, because every

00:05:27.867 --> 00:05:32.767
one is a story of bravery
that deserves to be told.

00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:34.367
But first, I want to take
just a few minutes

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:38.600
to describe the Americans
behind these actions,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.700
the men these families know --
the brilliant lives behind

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.633
the smiling faces in those
old photographs, and how

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:48.800
they reflected all the
beauty and diversity of

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.667
the country that
they served.

00:05:51.667 --> 00:05:54.133
They were Americans by
birth and Americans by

00:05:54.133 --> 00:05:58.400
choice -- immigrants,
including one who was not

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.533
yet even a citizen.

00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:02.300
They grew up in big
city neighborhoods

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.567
like Brooklyn, rural
communities like Hooper,

00:06:05.567 --> 00:06:10.367
Nebraska, small
towns in Puerto Rico.

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:12.533
They loved to fish
and play baseball.

00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:14.567
They were sons who made
their parents proud,

00:06:14.567 --> 00:06:18.700
and brothers who their
siblings looked up to.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:23.133
They were so young --
many in their early 20s.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:25.367
And when their country
went to war,

00:06:25.367 --> 00:06:27.266
they answered the call.

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:29.500
They put on the uniform,
and hugged their families

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.300
goodbye -- some of them
hugged the wives and

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.667
children that they'd
never see again.

00:06:36.667 --> 00:06:39.667
They fought in the rocky
hills of Italy,

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:43.000
the blood-stained beaches of
France, in the freezing

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.700
mountains of Korea, the
humid jungles of Vietnam.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.834
Their courage almost
defies imagination.

00:06:52.834 --> 00:06:57.467
When you read the records
of these individuals,

00:06:57.467 --> 00:07:02.767
it's unimaginable, the valor
that they displayed.

00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:05.100
Running into bullets.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:08.900
Charging machine gun nests
and climbing aboard tanks

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.000
and taking them out.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.500
Covering their comrades
so they could

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.533
make it to safety.

00:07:15.533 --> 00:07:19.333
Holding back enemies, wave
after wave, even when the

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:22.166
combat was hand-to-hand.

00:07:22.166 --> 00:07:25.133
Manning their posts --
some to their very last

00:07:25.133 --> 00:07:28.433
breaths -- so that their
comrades might live.

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.200
Of the 24 American
soldiers we honor today,

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.133
10 never came home.

00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:40.100
One of them -- Corporal
Joe Baldonado, from the

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.500
Korean War -- is still
missing,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.233
reminding us that, as a nation,
we have a scared obligation

00:07:45.233 --> 00:07:48.000
to keep working to give the
families of our missing

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.700
service members from all
wars a full accounting

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.500
of their loved ones.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.900
Through their grief, the
families of our fallen

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.467
summoned the strength to
carry on: wives whose

00:08:01.467 --> 00:08:04.166
hearts ached for their
husbands; sons and

00:08:04.166 --> 00:08:06.767
daughters who grew up
without their dad;

00:08:06.767 --> 00:08:10.000
nieces and nephews and
grandchildren.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.166
These families
join us here today.

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:15.033
And they know, more than
most, that because others

00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:18.100
laid down their lives for
us, we've been able

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:24.767
to live our lives in freedom,
pursue our dreams.

00:08:24.767 --> 00:08:30.200
So there's a legacy
here born of sacrifice.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.633
That includes a soldier's
nephew --

00:08:32.633 --> 00:08:36.567
a kid from New York, who grew up
to become one of the great

00:08:36.567 --> 00:08:38.300
rock stars of all time and
who honors

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:39.300
his uncle here today.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:45.900
It includes soldiers
who came home and took

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.066
different paths -- some
continued to serve in

00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:51.066
uniform, some beginning
new careers, some getting

00:08:51.066 --> 00:08:53.734
married and raising their
kids, serving their

00:08:53.734 --> 00:08:58.066
communities, taking care
of their fellow vets.

00:08:58.066 --> 00:09:00.533
These veterans lived out
their lives in the country

00:09:00.533 --> 00:09:03.066
that they helped to
defend, and doing what

00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:05.300
they loved --like William
Leonard,

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.433
who at age 71 passed away in his
backyard,

00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:12.367
sitting in his chair, listening
to his beloved Yankees

00:09:12.367 --> 00:09:15.400
play on the radio.

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.367
And that's where this
story might have ended.

00:09:18.367 --> 00:09:23.467
But Mitchel Libman -- a
friend of one of these

00:09:23.467 --> 00:09:25.400
soldiers and an Army vet
himself --

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.333
set out on a mission.

00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:29.266
He and his wife Marilyn
spent years writing

00:09:29.266 --> 00:09:30.767
letters and working with
Congress

00:09:30.767 --> 00:09:32.734
and our military to get this done.

00:09:32.734 --> 00:09:35.934
And so we thank all those
who worked so hard

00:09:35.934 --> 00:09:39.600
for so long to bring us to this
moment, especially Marilyn

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.867
and Mitchel -- now 83
years old -- who I'd ask

00:09:42.867 --> 00:09:48.867
to stand so that we
can all say thank you.

00:09:55.400 --> 00:10:01.400
(applause)

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.000
Finally, of
these 24 soldiers, three

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.600
remain with us and have
joined us here today --

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.266
men who remind us that
sometimes the heroes

00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:21.000
we seek are right in front of us,

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.867
literally living right next door.

00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:29.567
Most days, you can find
Jose Rodela in his San

00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:33.900
Antonio home -- a
76-year-old retiree who

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.967
enjoys watching baseball
on TV, and working on his

00:10:36.967 --> 00:10:40.867
1975 Chevy pickup, and
mowing the grass

00:10:40.867 --> 00:10:41.867
for his neighbors.

00:10:41.867 --> 00:10:47.533
Jose is such a humble
guy that he did not even

00:10:47.533 --> 00:10:52.033
mention the ceremony to
his neighbors --

00:10:52.033 --> 00:10:53.500
who I think would be pretty
shocked to turn

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.133
on the news tonight --

00:10:55.133 --> 00:10:59.066
(laughter)
-- and see that the guy

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:02.533
who cuts their lawn is
getting

00:11:02.533 --> 00:11:04.800
the Medal of Honor.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.800
(laughter)

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.133
Today, we
remember how 32--year-old

00:11:08.133 --> 00:11:12.367
Sergeant First Class
Rodela fought through his

00:11:12.367 --> 00:11:14.533
wounds in Vietnam and
rallied his men during

00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:16.667
18 hours of constant combat.

00:11:18.734 --> 00:11:20.800
Most days, you can find
Melvin Morris at home

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:25.133
in Port St. John, Florida --
72 years old,

00:11:25.133 --> 00:11:29.934
a retired salesman and a
great-grandfather.

00:11:29.934 --> 00:11:32.200
You'll find him working on
his boat, going fishing,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.266
reading the Bible,
spending time

00:11:34.266 --> 00:11:36.800
with his beautiful wife Mary --

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.934
married 53 years this month.

00:11:38.934 --> 00:11:41.400
You're going to have
to give me some tips.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.400
(laughter)

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:47.133
We're not
that far along yet.

00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:49.333
Today, we remember how
27-year-old

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.500
Staff Sergeant Morris --

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.934
one of our
nation's very first

00:11:53.934 --> 00:11:58.066
Green Berets -- one of our very
first Green Berets --

00:11:58.066 --> 00:11:59.066
think about that.

00:11:59.066 --> 00:12:05.934
I mean, that's legendary
-- how Staff Sergeant

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:09.367
Morris recovered a fallen
comrade in Vietnam,

00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:13.266
took out several enemy bunkers,
and kept going even after

00:12:13.266 --> 00:12:15.233
he was shot three times.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:25.967
And on most days, you can
find Santiago Erevia

00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:28.066
at home in San Antonio --

00:12:28.066 --> 00:12:32.567
he's a 68-year-old retired postal worker.

00:12:32.567 --> 00:12:34.500
He's fixing up his house,
typically, tending to the

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.066
garden, going on walks
with his wife,

00:12:37.066 --> 00:12:38.667
or doing some push-ups to
stay in shape.

00:12:38.667 --> 00:12:43.066
(laughter)

00:12:43.066 --> 00:12:46.100
Today, we
remember how 23-year-old

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:51.066
Specialist Four Erevia,
under a hail of bullets

00:12:51.066 --> 00:12:54.734
in Vietnam, gave first aid to
his wounded comrades and

00:12:54.734 --> 00:12:59.300
single-handedly destroyed
four enemy bunkers.

00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:04.166
These are extraordinary
Americans.

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:06.900
They are exemplary
soldiers.

00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:11.033
And so I want to begin by
welcoming Santiago Erevia

00:13:11.033 --> 00:13:13.266
to the stage for the
reading of the citation.

00:13:13.266 --> 00:13:19.266
Military Aide: Specialist
Four Santiago J. Erevia.

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:36.667
United States Army.

00:13:45.767 --> 00:13:48.400
Specialist Four
Santiago J.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.467
Erevia distinguished
himself by acts of

00:13:51.467 --> 00:13:55.266
gallantry and intrepidity
above and beyond the call

00:13:55.266 --> 00:14:01.333
of duty while serving as a
radio telephone operator

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.166
in Company C, 1st
Battalion (Airmobile),

00:14:10.166 --> 00:14:14.000
501st Infantry, 101st
Airborne Division

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.934
(Airmobile) during search
and clear mission near Tam

00:14:16.934 --> 00:14:21.600
Ky, Republic of Vietnam
on May 21, 1969.

00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.767
After breaching an
insurgent perimeter,

00:14:23.767 --> 00:14:26.800
Specialist Four Erevia was
designated by his platoon

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.734
leader to render first aid
to several casualties, and

00:14:29.734 --> 00:14:31.734
the rest of the
platoon moved forward.

00:14:31.734 --> 00:14:34.333
As he was doing so, he
came under intense hostile

00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:37.367
fire from four bunkers
to his left front.

00:14:37.367 --> 00:14:39.233
Although he could have
taken cover with the rest

00:14:39.233 --> 00:14:41.500
of the element, he chose
a retaliatory

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.400
course of action.

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.200
With heavy enemy fire
directed at him, he moved

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.266
in full view of the
hostile gunners

00:14:48.266 --> 00:14:50.533
as he proceeded to crawl from
one wounded man

00:14:50.533 --> 00:14:52.834
to another, gathering
ammunition.

00:14:52.834 --> 00:14:56.300
Armed with two M-16 rifles
and several hand grenades,

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.834
he charged toward the
enemy positions behind the

00:14:58.834 --> 00:15:01.200
suppressive fire
of the two rifles.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:03.700
Under very intense fire,
he continued to advance

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:07.133
on the insurgents until he
was near the first bunker.

00:15:07.133 --> 00:15:09.467
Disregarding the enemy
fire, he pulled the pin

00:15:09.467 --> 00:15:12.133
from a hand grenade and
advanced on the bunker,

00:15:12.133 --> 00:15:14.533
leveling suppressive fire
until he could drop the

00:15:14.533 --> 00:15:17.000
grenade into the bunker,
mortally wounding the

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.667
insurgent and destroying
the fortification.

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:22.767
Without hesitation, he
employed identical tactics

00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:24.200
as he proceeded to
eliminate

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.467
the next two enemy positions.

00:15:26.467 --> 00:15:28.500
With the destruction
of the third bunker,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:31.100
Specialist Four Erevia had
exhausted his supply

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.400
of hand grenades.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.200
Still under intense fire
from the fourth position,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.300
he courageously charged
forward behind

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.200
the fire emitted by his
M-16 rifles.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.233
Arriving at the very edge
of the bunker,

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:44.834
he silenced the occupant within
the fortification

00:15:44.834 --> 00:15:46.767
at point blank range.

00:15:46.767 --> 00:15:49.266
Through his heroic actions
the lives of the wounded

00:15:49.266 --> 00:15:51.667
were saved and the members
of the Company Command

00:15:51.667 --> 00:15:54.967
Post were relieved from a
very precarious situation.

00:15:54.967 --> 00:15:56.800
His exemplary performance
in the face

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:59.300
of overwhelming danger was an
inspiration

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.467
to his entire company and
contributed immeasurably

00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:04.667
to the success of the mission.

00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:08.000
Specialist Four Erevia's
conspicuous gallantry,

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.033
extraordinary heroism, and
intrepidity at the risk of

00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:14.000
his own life, above and
beyond the call of duty,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.667
were in keeping with the
highest traditions of

00:16:15.667 --> 00:16:18.300
military service and
reflect great credit upon

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.266
himself, his unit, and
the United States Army.

00:16:21.266 --> 00:16:27.266
(The medal is presented.)

00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:55.200
(applause)

00:16:55.200 --> 00:17:01.266
Military Aide: Sergeant First
Class Melvin Morris.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.967
United States Army.

00:17:15.967 --> 00:17:22.600
Staff Sergeant Melvin
Morris distinguished

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:28.600
himself by acts of
gallantry and intrepidity

00:17:32.066 --> 00:17:34.567
above and beyond the call
of duty while serving

00:17:34.567 --> 00:17:37.433
as Commander of a Strike
Force drawn from Company

00:17:37.433 --> 00:17:40.367
D, 5th Special Forces
Group (Airborne),

00:17:40.367 --> 00:17:44.233
1st Special Forces, during
combat operations against

00:17:44.233 --> 00:17:46.867
an armed enemy in the
vicinity of Chi Lang,

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:51.834
Republic of Vietnam on
September 17, 1969.

00:17:51.834 --> 00:17:53.834
On that afternoon,
Staff Sergeant Morris's

00:17:53.834 --> 00:17:56.300
affiliated companies
encountered an extensive

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.767
enemy mine field and were
subsequently engaged

00:17:58.767 --> 00:18:00.900
by a hostile force.

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.967
Staff Sergeant Morris
learned by radio that

00:18:02.967 --> 00:18:05.500
a fellow team commander had
been killed near an enemy

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.367
bunker and he immediately
reorganized

00:18:07.367 --> 00:18:10.867
his men into an effective
assault posture before advancing

00:18:10.867 --> 00:18:12.467
forward and splitting off

00:18:12.467 --> 00:18:16.300
with two men to recover the team commander's body.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.133
Observing the maneuver,
the hostile force

00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:20.900
concentrated its fire on
Staff Sergeant Morris's

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.600
three-man element and
successfully wounded both

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:26.133
men accompanying him.

00:18:26.133 --> 00:18:28.700
After assisting the two
wounded men back

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.500
to his forces' lines, Staff
Sergeant Morris charged

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.700
forward into withering
enemy fire with

00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.900
only his men's suppressive
fire as cover.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.100
While enemy machine gun
emplacements continuously

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:41.400
directed strafing
fusillades against him,

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.133
Staff Sergeant Morris
destroyed the positions

00:18:44.133 --> 00:18:46.834
with hand grenades and
continued his assault,

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:49.734
ultimately eliminating
four bunkers.

00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:51.667
Upon reaching the bunker
nearest the fallen team

00:18:51.667 --> 00:18:54.834
commander, Staff Sergeant
Morris repulsed the enemy,

00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:57.133
retrieved his comrade and
began the arduous

00:18:57.133 --> 00:18:59.533
trek back to friendly lines.

00:18:59.533 --> 00:19:02.400
He was wounded three times
as he struggled forward,

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:04.033
but ultimately succeeded
in returning

00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:07.333
his fallen comrade to a
friendly position.

00:19:07.333 --> 00:19:09.867
Staff Sergeant Morris's
extraordinary heroism

00:19:09.867 --> 00:19:12.567
and selflessness above and
beyond the call of duty

00:19:12.567 --> 00:19:14.200
are in keeping with the
highest traditions of

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.700
military service and
reflect great credit upon

00:19:16.700 --> 00:19:19.467
himself, his unit, and
the United States Army.

00:19:19.467 --> 00:19:25.467
(The medal is presented.)

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:47.400
(applause)

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:53.367
Military Aide: Master Sergeant First Class Jose Rodela.

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:07.333
United States Army.

00:20:14.533 --> 00:20:20.533
Sergeant First Class Jose
Rodela distinguished

00:20:25.533 --> 00:20:28.000
himself by acts of
gallantry and intrepidity

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.300
above and beyond the call
of duty while serving

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.333
as the company commander,
Detachment B-36,

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:36.667
Company A, 5th Special Forces
Group (Airborne),

00:20:36.667 --> 00:20:39.500
1st Special Forces during
combat operations

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.266
against an armed enemy in Phuoc
Long Province,

00:20:42.266 --> 00:20:45.967
Republic of Vietnam on
September 1, 1969.

00:20:45.967 --> 00:20:48.367
That afternoon, Sergeant
First Class Rodela's

00:20:48.367 --> 00:20:50.667
battalion came under an
intense barrage

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:53.367
of mortar, rocket, and
machine gun fire.

00:20:53.367 --> 00:20:55.266
Ignoring the withering
enemy fire,

00:20:55.266 --> 00:20:57.967
Sergeant First Class Rodela
immediately began placing

00:20:57.967 --> 00:21:01.333
his men into defensive positions
to prevent the enemy

00:21:01.333 --> 00:21:03.600
from overrunning the
entire battalion.

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.834
Repeatedly exposing
himself to enemy fire,

00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:09.033
Sergeant First Class
Rodela moved from position

00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:11.000
to position, providing
suppressing

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.867
fire and assisting wounded, and
was himself wounded

00:21:13.867 --> 00:21:16.400
in the back and head by a B-40
rocket

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.700
while recovering a wounded comrade.

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.066
Alone, Sergeant First
Class Rodela assaulted

00:21:21.066 --> 00:21:23.967
and knocked out the B-40
rocket position before

00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:26.500
successfully returning to
the battalion's perimeter.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.367
Sergeant First Class
Rodela's extraordinary

00:21:29.367 --> 00:21:31.934
heroism and selflessness
above and beyond

00:21:31.934 --> 00:21:34.233
the call of duty are in keeping
with the highest

00:21:34.233 --> 00:21:36.834
traditions of military
service and reflect great

00:21:36.834 --> 00:21:39.133
credit upon himself, his
unit and the

00:21:39.133 --> 00:21:40.100
United States Army.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:46.100
(The medal is presented.)

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.600
(applause)

00:21:54.600 --> 00:22:00.667
The President: Before Jose returns to his seat,

00:22:18.266 --> 00:22:19.734
I just want to ask

00:22:19.734 --> 00:22:22.600
Santiago and Melvin to
return

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.900
to the stage, please.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.967
This is a
remarkable moment.

00:22:27.967 --> 00:22:33.033
And as they come up, I'll
like to recall --

00:22:33.033 --> 00:22:39.100
as they take their positions I'd
like to recall the words

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:44.567
of a poet: "Tho' much is
taken, much abides;

00:22:44.567 --> 00:22:49.934
and tho' We are not now that
strength which in old days

00:22:49.934 --> 00:22:55.200
Moved earth and heaven;
that which we are, we are;

00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.400
One equal temper of heroic
hearts, Made weak by time

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:03.633
and fate, but strong in
will To strive,

00:23:03.633 --> 00:23:07.200
to seek, to find, and
not to yield."

00:23:09.633 --> 00:23:15.633
Santiago Erevia, Melvin
Morris, Jose Rodela --

00:23:17.667 --> 00:23:21.400
in the thick of the fight,
all those years ago,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.233
for your comrades and your
country,

00:23:24.233 --> 00:23:25.300
you refused to yield.

00:25:12.967 --> 00:25:15.800
Specialist Four Leonard L. Alvarado

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:17.000
distinguished
himself by acts

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.900
of gallantry and intrepidity
above and beyond the call

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:23.333
of duty while serving as a
Rifleman with Company D,

00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:26.300
2d Battalion, 12th
Cavalry, 1st Cavalry

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.400
Division (Airmobile)
during combat operations

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:32.000
against an armed enemy
in Phuoc Long Province,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.300
Republic of Vietnam
on August 12, 1969.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:39.300
On that day, as Specialist
Four Alvarado and a small

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:41.500
reaction force moved
through dense jungle

00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.300
en route to a beleaguered
friendly platoon,

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:46.100
Specialist Four Alvarado
detected

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.767
enemy movement and opened fire.

00:25:48.767 --> 00:25:50.266
Despite his quick
reaction,

00:25:50.266 --> 00:25:53.166
Specialist Four Alvarado and his
comrades were soon

00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:56.633
pinned down by the hostile force
that blocked the path

00:25:56.633 --> 00:25:58.600
to the trapped platoon.

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.000
Specialist Four Alvarado
quickly moved forward

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.834
through the hostile
machinegun fire

00:26:02.834 --> 00:26:05.300
in order to engage the
enemy troops.

00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:08.800
Suddenly, an enemy grenade
exploded nearby, wounding

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:11.100
and momentarily
stunning him.

00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:13.967
Retaliating immediately,
he killed the grenadier

00:26:13.967 --> 00:26:17.367
just as another enemy
barrage wounded him again.

00:26:17.367 --> 00:26:19.867
Specialist Four Alvarado
crawled forward through

00:26:19.867 --> 00:26:22.533
the fusillade to pull
several comrades back

00:26:22.533 --> 00:26:25.200
within the hastily-formed
perimeter.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.233
Realizing his element
needed

00:26:26.233 --> 00:26:29.567
to break away from the hostile
force, Specialist Four Alvarado

00:26:29.567 --> 00:26:32.066
began maneuvering
forward alone.

00:26:32.066 --> 00:26:34.033
Though repeatedly thrown
to the ground by exploding

00:26:34.033 --> 00:26:36.200
satchel charges, he
continued advancing

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.433
and firing, silencing several
emplacements,

00:26:39.433 --> 00:26:42.500
including one enemy machinegun
position.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:44.700
From his dangerous forward
position, he persistently

00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.633
laid suppressive fire on
the hostile forces,

00:26:47.633 --> 00:26:49.934
and after the enemy troops
had broken contact,

00:26:49.934 --> 00:26:51.400
his comrades discovered that

00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.633
he had succumbed to his wounds.

00:26:53.633 --> 00:26:56.633
Specialist Four Alvarado's
extraordinary heroism and

00:26:56.633 --> 00:26:59.400
selflessness at the cost
of his own life, above and

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.467
beyond the call of duty,
are in keeping with the

00:27:01.467 --> 00:27:03.633
highest traditions of

00:27:03.633 --> 00:27:05.667
and reflect great credit upon
himself,

00:27:05.667 --> 00:27:07.467
his unit and the United States Army.

00:27:07.467 --> 00:27:13.467

himself by acts of gallantry

00:27:51.166 --> 00:27:53.633
and intrepidity
above and beyond the call

00:27:53.633 --> 00:27:55.667
of duty while serving as
an acting

00:27:55.667 --> 00:28:00.233
Platoon Leader in Company D, 1st

00:28:00.233 --> 00:28:03.900
Regiment, 3d Brigade, 82d
Airborne Division during

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.667
combat operations against
an armed enemy

00:28:06.667 --> 00:28:11.934
in Ap Tan Hoa, Republic of
Vietnam on April 4, 1969.

00:28:11.934 --> 00:28:14.000
While entering a heavily
wooded section on the

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.500
route of advance, Staff
Sergeant Conde-Falcon and

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.900
his company encountered
an extensive enemy bunker

00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:21.734
complex, later identified

00:28:21.734 --> 00:28:23.834
as a battalion command post.

00:28:23.834 --> 00:28:26.166
Following tactical
artillery and air strikes

00:28:26.166 --> 00:28:28.734
on the heavily-secured
enemy position, Staff

00:28:28.734 --> 00:28:31.600
Sergeant Conde-Falcon's
platoon was selected

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.500
to assault and clear the
bunker fortifications.

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.834
Moving out ahead of his
platoon,

00:28:35.834 --> 00:28:39.166
Staff Sergeant Conde-Falcon
charged the first bunker,

00:28:39.166 --> 00:28:41.633
heaving grenades as he went.

00:28:41.633 --> 00:28:43.333
As the hostile fire
increased,

00:28:43.333 --> 00:28:46.600
he crawled to the blind side of
an entrenchment position,

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.734
jumped to the roof, and
tossed a grenade

00:28:48.734 --> 00:28:50.367
into the bunker aperture.

00:28:50.367 --> 00:28:52.066
Without hesitating,
he proceeded

00:28:52.066 --> 00:28:54.867
to two additional bunkers, both
of which he destroyed

00:28:54.867 --> 00:28:56.867
in the same manner
as the first.

00:28:56.867 --> 00:28:58.900
Rejoining his platoon,
Staff Sergeant

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.734
Conde-Falcon advanced
about one hundred meters

00:29:01.734 --> 00:29:03.567
through the trees before
coming

00:29:03.567 --> 00:29:05.433
under intense hostile fire.

00:29:05.433 --> 00:29:07.667
Selecting three men
to accompany him,

00:29:07.667 --> 00:29:10.233
he maneuvered toward the
enemy's flank position.

00:29:10.233 --> 00:29:12.834
Carrying a machinegun, he
single-handedly assaulted

00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:15.900
the nearest fortification,
killing the enemy inside

00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:17.867
before running
out of ammunition.

00:29:17.867 --> 00:29:19.934
After returning to the
three men with his empty

00:29:19.934 --> 00:29:22.533
weapon and taking
up an M-16 rifle,

00:29:22.533 --> 00:29:24.700
he concentrated on
the next bunker.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.600
Within ten meters of his
goal, Staff Sergeant

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.133
Conde-Falcon was shot by
an unseen assailant and

00:29:30.133 --> 00:29:31.834
soon died of his wounds.

00:29:31.834 --> 00:29:34.100
Staff Sergeant
Conde-Falcon's

00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:37.333
extraordinary heroism and
selflessness at the cost

00:29:37.333 --> 00:29:39.900

operations against an
armed enemy near Ph Romeas

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:04.166
Hek, Cambodia
on May 12, 1970.

00:31:04.166 --> 00:31:06.567
That morning, Specialist
Four Copas's company

00:31:06.567 --> 00:31:09.934
was suddenly attacked by a
large hostile force firing

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:12.700
recoilless rifles,
rocket-propelled grenades,

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.700
and automatic weapons.

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:17.500
As Specialist Four Copas
began returning fire, his

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.767
armored car was struck by
an enemy recoilless round,

00:31:20.767 --> 00:31:23.333
knocking him to the ground
and injuring four American

00:31:23.333 --> 00:31:28.333
Soldiers beside
the vehicle.

00:31:28.333 --> 00:31:29.333
Ignoring his own wounds,
Specialist Four Copas

00:31:29.333 --> 00:31:30.633
quickly remounted the
burning vehicle and

00:31:30.633 --> 00:31:32.967
commenced firing his
machinegun at the

00:31:32.967 --> 00:31:34.567
belligerents.

00:31:34.567 --> 00:31:36.867
Braving the hostile fire
directed at him and the

00:31:36.867 --> 00:31:39.266
possible detonation of the
mortar rounds inside the

00:31:39.266 --> 00:31:41.734
track, Specialist Four
Copas maintained

00:31:41.734 --> 00:31:44.967
a heavy volume of suppressive
fire on the foe while the

00:31:44.967 --> 00:31:47.600
wounded Americans were
safely evacuated.

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:50.700
Undaunted, Specialist Four
Copas continued to place

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.467
devastating volleys of
fire upon the adversary

00:31:53.467 --> 00:31:56.300
until he was mortally
wounded when another enemy

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.433
round hit his vehicle.

00:31:58.433 --> 00:32:01.433
Specialist Four Copas's
daring action resulted in

00:32:01.433 --> 00:32:04.567
the safe evacuation
of his comrades.

00:32:04.567 --> 00:32:07.467

the Republic of Vietnam
on April 10, 1969.

00:33:57.767 --> 00:34:00.100
That afternoon, the
reconnaissance platoon was

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.800
moving into an elaborate
enemy bunker complex when

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:05.233
the lead elements began
taking concentrated ambush

00:34:05.233 --> 00:34:06.700
fire from every side.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.300
The command post was in
imminent danger

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.066
of being overrun.

00:34:10.066 --> 00:34:12.800
With an M-60 machinegun
blazing from his hip,

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.166
Specialist Four Duran
rushed forward and assumed

00:34:15.166 --> 00:34:18.266
a defensive position
near the command post.

00:34:18.266 --> 00:34:21.033
As hostile forces stormed
forward, Specialist Four

00:34:21.033 --> 00:34:23.934
Duran stood tall in a
cloud of dust raised by

00:34:23.934 --> 00:34:26.667
the impacting rounds and
bursting grenades directed

00:34:26.667 --> 00:34:29.066
towards him and thwarted
the enemy with devastating

00:34:29.066 --> 00:34:31.166
streams of
machinegun fire.

00:34:31.166 --> 00:34:33.100
Learning that two
seriously wounded troopers

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.900
lay helplessly pinned down
under harassing fire,

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.233
Specialist Four Duran
assaulted the suppressive

00:34:38.233 --> 00:34:42.000
enemy positions, firing
deadly bursts on the run.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.266
Mounting a log, he fired
directly into the enemy's

00:34:45.266 --> 00:34:48.133
foxholes, eliminating four
and cutting down several

00:34:48.133 --> 00:34:49.767
others as they fled.

00:34:49.767 --> 00:34:51.800
Specialist Four Duran
then continued

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.100
to pour effective fire on the
disorganized

00:34:54.100 --> 00:34:55.734
and fleeing enemy.

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:14.066
Republic of Vietnam
on December 8, 1968.

00:36:14.066 --> 00:36:16.533
On that day, while
conducting reconnaissance,

00:36:16.533 --> 00:36:18.467
Sergeant Garcia and
his platoon discovered

00:36:18.467 --> 00:36:21.133
communication wire and
other signs of an enemy

00:36:21.133 --> 00:36:24.467
base camp leading into a
densely vegetated area.

00:36:24.467 --> 00:36:27.633
As the men advanced, they
came under intense fire.

00:36:27.633 --> 00:36:30.333
Several men were hit and
trapped in the open.

00:36:30.333 --> 00:36:33.200
Ignoring a hail of hostile
bullets, Sergeant Garcia

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.233
crawled to within ten
meters of a machinegun

00:36:35.233 --> 00:36:38.367
bunker, leaped to his feet
and ran directly at the

00:36:38.367 --> 00:36:42.300
fortification, firing
his rifle as he charged.

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:44.600
Sergeant Garcia jammed two
hand grenades into the gun

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.700
port and then placed the
muzzle of his weapon

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:50.200
inside, killing
all four occupants.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.500
Continuing to expose
himself to intense enemy

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.633
fire, Sergeant Garcia
raced fifteen meters to

00:36:55.633 --> 00:36:58.500
another bunker and killed
its three defenders with

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.800
hand grenades
and rifle fire.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:04.000
After again braving the
enemies' barrage in order

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.700
to rescue two casualties,
he joined his company

00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.100
in an assault which overran

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.567
the remaining enemy positions.

00:37:10.567 --> 00:37:12.900
Sergeant Garcia's
extraordinary heroism and

00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:15.333
selflessness above and
beyond the call of duty

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.934
are in keeping with the
highest traditions

00:37:16.934 --> 00:37:19.500
of military service and
reflect great credit upon

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:22.200
himself, his unit and
the United States Army.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:28.200
(The medal is presented.)

00:37:34.467 --> 00:37:37.533
(applause)

00:37:37.533 --> 00:37:43.533
Military Aide: Charles Baldonado
accepting on behalf of his

00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:54.266
brother, Corporal Joe R. Baldonado

00:38:00.567 --> 00:38:02.300
Corporal Joe R. Baldonado

00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:03.600
distinguished
himself by acts

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.333
of gallantry and intrepidity
above and beyond the call

00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:09.367
of duty while serving as
an acting machinegunner

00:38:09.367 --> 00:38:14.100
in 3d Squad, 2d Platoon,
Company B, 187th Airborne

00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:16.900
Infantry Regiment during
combat operations against

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:19.367
an armed enemy in
Kangdong, Korea

00:38:19.367 --> 00:38:22.166
on November 25, 1950.

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:24.500
On that morning, the enemy
launched a strong attack

00:38:24.500 --> 00:38:26.533
in an effort to seize the
hill occupied

00:38:26.533 --> 00:38:29.166
by Corporal Baldonado and his company.

00:38:29.166 --> 00:38:31.800
The platoon had expended
most of its ammunition

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.300
in repelling the enemy attack
and the platoon leader

00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.000
decided to commit his 3d
Squad, with its supply

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.367
of ammunition, in the
defensive action.

00:38:39.367 --> 00:38:41.400
Since there was no time
to dig in because of the

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.066
proximity of the enemy,
who had advanced to within

00:38:44.066 --> 00:38:46.600
twenty-five yards of the
platoon position, Corporal

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.066
Baldonado emplaced his
weapon in an exposed

00:38:49.066 --> 00:38:51.767
position and delivered a
withering stream of fire

00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:54.400
on the advancing enemy,
causing them to fall back

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.767
in disorder.

00:38:55.767 --> 00:38:57.500
The enemy then
concentrated all their

00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.667
fire on Corporal
Baldonado's gun and

00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:01.900
attempted to knock it out
by rushing the position

00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.667
in small groups and
hurling hand grenades.

00:39:04.667 --> 00:39:07.500
Several times, grenades
exploded extremely close

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.800
to Corporal Baldonado but
failed to interrupt

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.934
his continuous firing.

00:39:11.934 --> 00:39:14.300
The hostile troops made
repeated attempts to storm

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:16.734
his position and were
driven back each time with

00:39:16.734 --> 00:39:18.400
appalling casualties.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.767
The enemy finally withdrew
after making a final

00:39:20.767 --> 00:39:22.667
assault on Corporal
Baldonado's position

00:39:22.667 --> 00:39:24.934
during which a grenade
landed near his gun,

00:39:24.934 --> 00:39:26.600
killing him instantly.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:29.033
Corporal Baldonado's
extraordinary heroism and

00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:31.500
selflessness at the cost
of his own life,

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.100
above and beyond the call of
duty, are in keeping with the

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.433
highest traditions of
military service and

00:39:36.433 --> 00:39:39.200
reflect great credit upon
himself, his unit and the

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:40.200
United States Army.

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:46.166
(The medal is presented.)
(applause)

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:05.100
Military Aide: Tyronne
Espinoza accepting

00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:14.600
on behalf of his father, Corporal Victor H. Espinoza

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.533
distinguished
himself by acts of

00:40:24.533 --> 00:40:27.400
gallantry and intrepidity
above and beyond the call

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:30.100
of duty while serving as
an Acting Rifleman in

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.667
Company A, 23d Infantry
Regiment, 2d Infantry

00:40:33.667 --> 00:40:36.467
Division during combat
operations against an

00:40:36.467 --> 00:40:41.600
armed enemy in Chorwon,
Korea on August 1, 1952.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.967
On that day, Corporal
Espinoza and his unit were

00:40:43.967 --> 00:40:46.033
responsible for securing
and holding

00:40:46.033 --> 00:40:48.266
a vital enemy hill.

00:40:48.266 --> 00:40:49.934
As the friendly unit
neared its objective,

00:40:49.934 --> 00:40:52.066
it was subjected to a
devastating volume

00:40:52.066 --> 00:40:54.867
of enemy fire, slowing
its progress.

00:40:54.867 --> 00:40:57.433
Corporal Espinoza,
unhesitatingly and being

00:40:57.433 --> 00:41:00.300
fully aware of the hazards
involved, left his place

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.000
of comparative safety and
made a deliberate one man

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.300
assault on the enemy with
his rifle and grenades,

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.734
destroying a machinegun
and killing its crew.

00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:11.467
Corporal Espinoza
continued across the

00:41:11.467 --> 00:41:13.834
fire-swept terrain to an
exposed vantage point

00:41:13.834 --> 00:41:16.400
where he attacked an enemy
mortar position and two

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.800
bunkers with grenades and
rifle fire, knocking out

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.867
the enemy mortar position
and destroying both

00:41:21.867 --> 00:41:24.633
bunkers and killing
their occupants.

00:41:24.633 --> 00:41:26.834
Upon reaching the crest,
and after running out of

00:41:26.834 --> 00:41:29.934
rifle ammunition, he
called for more grenades.

00:41:29.934 --> 00:41:32.033
A comrade who was behind
him threw some Chinese

00:41:32.033 --> 00:41:33.467
grenades to him.

00:41:33.467 --> 00:41:36.166
Immediately upon catching
them, he pulled the pins

00:41:36.166 --> 00:41:38.767
and hurled them into the
occupied trenches, killing

00:41:38.767 --> 00:41:40.200
and wounding more of the
enemy

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.066
with their own weapons.

00:41:42.066 --> 00:41:44.934
Continuing on through a
tunnel, Corporal Espinoza

00:41:44.934 --> 00:41:47.667
made a daring charge,
inflicting at least seven

00:41:47.667 --> 00:41:50.066
more casualties upon
the enemy who were fast

00:41:50.066 --> 00:41:52.166
retreating into
the tunnel.

00:41:52.166 --> 00:41:54.633
Corporal Espinoza was
quickly in pursuit, but

00:41:54.633 --> 00:41:56.800
the hostile fire from the
opening prevented him from

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.166
overtaking the
retreating enemy.

00:41:59.166 --> 00:42:01.800
As a result, Corporal
Espinoza destroyed the

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.333
tunnel with TNT, called
for more grenades from his

00:42:04.333 --> 00:42:06.934
company, and hurled them
at the enemy troops until

00:42:06.934 --> 00:42:08.800
they were out of reach.

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.633
Corporal Espinoza's
incredible display of

00:42:10.633 --> 00:42:13.300
valor secured the vital
strong point and took a

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.000
heavy toll on the enemy,
resulting in at least

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:18.567
fourteen dead and
eleven wounded.

00:42:18.567 --> 00:42:21.266
Corporal Espinoza's
extraordinary heroism and

00:42:21.266 --> 00:42:24.000
selflessness above and
beyond the call of duty

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:25.400
are in keeping with the
highest traditions

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.967
of military service and
reflect great credit upon

00:42:27.967 --> 00:42:30.667
himself, his unit and
the United States Army.

00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:36.667
(The medal is presented.)
(applause)

00:42:53.166 --> 00:42:59.166
Military Aide: Pete Corrall
accepting on behalf

00:43:06.033 --> 00:43:09.333
of his uncle, Sergeant Eduardo C. Gomez.

00:43:11.367 --> 00:43:13.467
Sergeant Eduardo C. Gomez

00:43:13.467 --> 00:43:14.834
distinguished
himself by acts

00:43:14.834 --> 00:43:17.633
of gallantry and intrepidity
above and beyond the call

00:43:17.633 --> 00:43:20.867
of duty while serving with
Company I, 8th Cavalry

00:43:20.867 --> 00:43:23.567
Regiment, 1st Cavalry
Division during combat

00:43:23.567 --> 00:43:26.467
operations against an
armed enemy in Tabu-dong,

00:43:26.467 --> 00:43:29.967
Korea on
September 3, 1950.

00:43:29.967 --> 00:43:32.533
That afternoon, while
conducting combat patrol,

00:43:32.533 --> 00:43:35.133
Sergeant Gomez' company
was ruthlessly attacked

00:43:35.133 --> 00:43:37.834
by a hostile force which
moved within seventy-five

00:43:37.834 --> 00:43:39.400
yards of the command post
before

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.934
it was immobilized by rocket fire.

00:43:41.934 --> 00:43:45.133
However, an enemy tank and
multiple enemy machineguns

00:43:45.133 --> 00:43:46.533
continued to rake the
company

00:43:46.533 --> 00:43:49.367
perimeter with devastating fire.

00:43:49.367 --> 00:43:51.533
Realizing the tank posed
a serious threat

00:43:51.533 --> 00:43:54.667
to the entire perimeter,
Sergeant Gomez voluntarily

00:43:54.667 --> 00:43:58.200
crawled thirty yards across an
open rice field vulnerable

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.500
to enemy observation and
fire, boarded the tank,

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:02.800
pried open one of the
hatches

00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:06.100
on the turret and dropped an
activated grenade into the hull,

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:07.667
killing the crew.

00:44:07.667 --> 00:44:09.600
Wounded in the left side
while returning

00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.433
to his position, Sergeant Gomez
refused evacuation.

00:44:13.433 --> 00:44:18.700
Observing that
the tripod of a .30

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:19.700
caliber machinegun was
rendered inoperable

00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.734
by enemy fire, he cradled
the weapon in his arms,

00:44:20.734 --> 00:44:22.934
returned to the forward
defensive positions,

00:44:22.934 --> 00:44:25.867
and swept the assaulting force
with withering fire.

00:44:25.867 --> 00:44:27.767
Although his weapon
overheated and burned his

00:44:27.767 --> 00:44:30.100
hands and his painful
wound still bled,

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:33.333
Sergeant Gomez maintained his
stand and, upon orders to

00:44:33.333 --> 00:44:35.500
withdraw in the face
of overwhelming enemy

00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:39.100
superiority, remained to
provide protective fire.

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.700
Sergeant Gomez continued
to pour accurate fire into

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.767
the enemy ranks, exacting
a heavy toll in casualties

00:44:44.767 --> 00:44:46.500
and retarding
their advance.

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:48.834
Sergeant Gomez would not
consent to leave his post

00:44:48.834 --> 00:44:50.734
for medical attention
until the company

00:44:50.734 --> 00:44:52.867
established new
defensive positions.

00:44:52.867 --> 00:44:55.333
Sergeant Gomez's
extraordinary heroism and

00:44:55.333 --> 00:44:58.066
selflessness above and
beyond the call of duty

00:44:58.066 --> 00:44:59.800
are in keeping with the
highest traditions

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.500
of military service and
reflect great credit upon

00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.834
himself, his unit and
the United States Army.

00:45:04.834 --> 00:45:10.834
(The medal is presented)

(applause)

00:45:26.967 --> 00:45:32.967
Miliary Aide: Laurie Wegner
accepting on behalf

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.633
of her uncle, Private First

00:45:40.633 --> 00:45:42.967
Class Leonard M. Kravitz.

00:45:45.633 --> 00:45:48.467
Private First
Class Leonard M. Kravitz

00:45:48.467 --> 00:45:49.633
distinguished
himself by acts

00:45:49.633 --> 00:45:52.467
of gallantry and intrepidity
above and beyond the call

00:45:52.467 --> 00:45:54.967
of duty while serving as
an assistant machinegunner

00:45:54.967 --> 00:45:57.900
with Company M, 5th
Infantry Regiment,

00:45:57.900 --> 00:46:01.633
24th Infantry Division during
combat operations against

00:46:01.633 --> 00:46:03.300
an armed enemy in
Yangpyong,

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:07.900
Korea on March 6 and 7, 1951.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.066
After friendly elements
had repulsed two probing

00:46:10.066 --> 00:46:12.367
attacks, the enemy
launched a fanatical

00:46:12.367 --> 00:46:15.467
banzai charge with heavy
supporting fire and,

00:46:15.467 --> 00:46:17.867
despite staggering losses,
pressed the assault

00:46:17.867 --> 00:46:20.200
with ruthless determination.

00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:22.033
When the machinegunner was
wounded in the initial

00:46:22.033 --> 00:46:24.266
phase of the action,
Private First Class

00:46:24.266 --> 00:46:26.934
Kravitz immediately seized
the weapon and poured

00:46:26.934 --> 00:46:28.700
devastating fire into the
ranks

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.934
of the onrushing assailants.

00:46:30.934 --> 00:46:32.667
The enemy effected and
exploited a breach

00:46:32.667 --> 00:46:34.200
on the left flank, rendering

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.567
the friendly positions untenable.

00:46:36.567 --> 00:46:38.734
Upon order to withdraw,
Private First Class

00:46:38.734 --> 00:46:41.200
Kravitz voluntarily
remained to provide

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.533
protective fire for
the retiring elements.

00:46:44.533 --> 00:46:46.233
Detecting enemy troops
moving toward friendly

00:46:46.233 --> 00:46:49.266
positions, Private First
Class Kravitz swept the

00:46:49.266 --> 00:46:52.166
hostile soldiers with
deadly, accurate fire,

00:46:52.166 --> 00:46:54.133
killing the entire group.

00:46:54.133 --> 00:46:56.066
His destructive
retaliation caused the

00:46:56.066 --> 00:46:57.934
enemy to concentrate
vicious fire

00:46:57.934 --> 00:47:00.066
on his position and enabled the
friendly

00:47:00.066 --> 00:47:02.266
elements to withdraw.

00:47:02.266 --> 00:47:04.600
Later, after friendly
troops had returned,

00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.000
Private First Class
Kravitz was found dead

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.133
behind the gun he had
so heroically manned,

00:47:10.133 --> 00:47:12.867
surrounded by
numerous enemy dead.

00:47:12.867 --> 00:47:15.066
Private First Class
Kravitz's extraordinary

00:47:15.066 --> 00:47:17.900
heroism and selflessness
at the cost of his own

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.467
life, above and beyond
the call of duty, are in

00:47:20.467 --> 00:47:22.233
keeping with the highest
traditions of military

00:47:22.233 --> 00:47:25.367
service and reflect great
credit upon himself, his

00:47:25.367 --> 00:47:26.834
unit and the
United States Army.

00:47:26.834 --> 00:47:32.834
(The medal is presented.)

00:47:45.967 --> 00:47:50.767
(applause)

00:47:50.767 --> 00:47:56.767
Military Aide: Iris Negron
accepting on behalf

00:48:06.767 --> 00:48:07.767
of her father,

00:48:07.767 --> 00:48:11.133
Sergeant Juan E. Negron.

00:48:11.133 --> 00:48:12.633
Sergeant Juan E. Negron

00:48:12.633 --> 00:48:14.000
distinguished
himself by acts

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.734
of gallantry and intrepidity
above and beyond the call

00:48:16.734 --> 00:48:19.800
of duty while serving as a
member of Company L,

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.300
65th Infantry Regiment, 3d
Infantry Division during

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.767
combat operations against
an armed enemy

00:48:25.767 --> 00:48:29.967
in Kalma-Eri, Korea
on April 28, 1951.

00:48:29.967 --> 00:48:32.300
That afternoon, Sergeant
Negron took up the most

00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.967
vulnerable position on his
company's exposed right

00:48:34.967 --> 00:48:37.333
flank after an enemy force
had overrun

00:48:37.333 --> 00:48:39.100
a section of the line.

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.033
When notified that
elements of his company

00:48:41.033 --> 00:48:44.033
were withdrawing, Sergeant
Negron refused to leave

00:48:44.033 --> 00:48:46.133
his exposed position,
instead delivering

00:48:46.133 --> 00:48:48.266
withering fire at hostile
troops who had broken

00:48:48.266 --> 00:48:50.266
through a road block.

00:48:50.266 --> 00:48:52.567
When the hostile troops
approached his position,

00:48:52.567 --> 00:48:55.100
Sergeant Negron accurately
hurled hand grenades at

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:57.266
short range, halting
their attack.

00:48:57.266 --> 00:48:59.333
Sergeant Negron held the
position throughout the

00:48:59.333 --> 00:49:01.467
night while friendly
forces organized and

00:49:01.467 --> 00:49:03.333
launched a counterattack.

00:49:03.333 --> 00:49:05.233
The next morning, after
the enemy had been

00:49:05.233 --> 00:49:08.333
repulsed, friendly forces
relieved Sergeant Negron

00:49:08.333 --> 00:49:10.600
and found the bodies of
fifteen enemy soldiers

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.400
surrounding his position.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.900
Sergeant Negron's
extraordinary heroism and

00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:17.567
selflessness above and
beyond the call of duty

00:49:17.567 --> 00:49:19.667
are in keeping with the
highest traditions of

00:49:19.667 --> 00:49:22.400
military service and
reflect great credit upon

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.734
himself, his unit and
the United States Army.

00:49:24.734 --> 00:49:30.700
(The medal is presented.)

00:49:41.367 --> 00:49:45.533
(applause)

00:49:45.533 --> 00:49:51.533
Military Aide: Michael David Pena

00:49:57.667 --> 00:49:58.667
accepting on behalf

00:49:58.667 --> 00:50:02.000
of his father, Master
Sergeant Mike C. Pena.

00:50:05.633 --> 00:50:07.500
Master Sergeant Mike C. Pena

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.700
distinguished himself
by acts of gallantry

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:12.433
and intrepidity above and
beyond the call of duty

00:50:12.433 --> 00:50:14.800
while serving as a member
of Company F,

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.800
5th Cavalry Regiment, 1st
Cavalry Division during

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.900
combat operations against an
armed enemy in Waegwan,

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:24.567
Korea, on
September 4, 1950.

00:50:24.567 --> 00:50:26.800
That evening, under cover
of darkness and a dreary

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.066
mist, an enemy battalion
moved to within

00:50:29.066 --> 00:50:32.166
a few yards of Master Sergeant
Pena's platoon.

00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:34.400
Recognizing the enemy's
approach, Master Sergeant

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:37.133
Pena and his men opened
fire, but the enemy's

00:50:37.133 --> 00:50:39.967
sudden emergence and
accurate, point blank fire

00:50:39.967 --> 00:50:42.500
forced the friendly
troops to withdraw.

00:50:42.500 --> 00:50:44.500
Master Sergeant Pena
rapidly reorganized his

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.066
men and led them in a
counterattack which

00:50:47.066 --> 00:50:48.967
succeeded in regaining the
positions

00:50:48.967 --> 00:50:50.800
they had just lost.

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:52.667
He and his men quickly
established a defensive

00:50:52.667 --> 00:50:55.300
perimeter and laid down
devastating fire,

00:50:55.300 --> 00:50:57.600
but enemy troops continued to
hurl themselves

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.500
at the defenses in
overwhelming numbers.

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:01.934
Realizing that their
scarce supply

00:51:01.934 --> 00:51:05.233
of ammunition would soon make
their positions untenable,

00:51:05.233 --> 00:51:07.467
Master Sergeant Pena
ordered his men to fall

00:51:07.467 --> 00:51:09.133
back and manned a
machinegun

00:51:09.133 --> 00:51:11.133
to cover their withdrawal.

00:51:11.133 --> 00:51:13.533
He singlehandedly held
back the enemy until

00:51:13.533 --> 00:51:15.734
the early hours of the
following morning when his

00:51:15.734 --> 00:51:19.166
position was overrun
and he was killed.

00:51:19.166 --> 00:51:21.867
Master Sergeant Pena's
extraordinary heroism and

00:51:21.867 --> 00:51:24.900
selflessness at the cost
of his own life, above and

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.934
beyond the call of duty,
are in keeping with the

00:51:26.934 --> 00:51:29.500
highest traditions of
military service and

00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:32.166
reflect great credit upon
himself, his unit and the

00:51:32.166 --> 00:51:33.166
United States Army.

00:51:33.166 --> 00:51:39.166
(The medal is presented.)

00:51:56.600 --> 00:52:02.567
(applause)

00:52:02.567 --> 00:52:08.567
Military Aide: Sergeant Ashley Randall

00:52:20.166 --> 00:52:21.433
accepting on behalf of her

00:52:21.433 --> 00:52:23.967
grandfather, Private
Demensio Rivera.

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.300
Private Demensio Rivera
distinguished himself by

00:52:29.300 --> 00:52:31.700
acts of gallantry and
intrepidity above and

00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.900
beyond the call of duty
while serving as an

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:36.333
automatic rifleman with 2d
Platoon, Company G,

00:52:36.333 --> 00:52:40.834
7th Infantry Regiment, 3d
Infantry Division during

00:52:40.834 --> 00:52:43.433
combat operations against
an armed enemy

00:52:43.433 --> 00:52:45.834
in Changyong-ni, Korea
on May 23, 1951.

00:52:45.834 --> 00:52:50.233
Early that morning, a
large hostile force

00:52:50.233 --> 00:52:52.800
emerged from a dense fog
and viciously attacked

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.066
Private Rivera
and his comrades.

00:52:55.066 --> 00:52:57.533
Private Rivera immediately
responded by firing with

00:52:57.533 --> 00:53:00.533
deadly accuracy until
his weapon jammed.

00:53:00.533 --> 00:53:03.300
Without hesitating, he
threw his rifle down and

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:04.800
began to engage the enemy
with

00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.400
his pistol and grenades.

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.000
At one point, Private
Rivera fearlessly crawled

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.433
from his emplacement to
engage an infiltrating

00:53:11.433 --> 00:53:14.400
enemy soldier in fierce
hand-to-hand combat.

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.233
With only the sound of
footsteps and obscure

00:53:16.233 --> 00:53:19.066
shadows to guide his aim,
Private Rivera held his

00:53:19.066 --> 00:53:20.734
position against
tremendous odds,

00:53:20.734 --> 00:53:23.266
inflicting numerous
casualties on the enemy

00:53:23.266 --> 00:53:26.100
until he found himself
without ammunition of any

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.867
kind except one grenade.

00:53:27.867 --> 00:53:29.934
Displaying a peerless
fighting spirit and an

00:53:29.934 --> 00:53:32.033
utterly selfless devotion
to duty,

00:53:32.033 --> 00:53:35.200
Private Rivera pulled the pin
from his last grenade and calmly

00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.834
waited for the enemy
to reach his position.

00:53:37.834 --> 00:53:40.166
As enemy troops leaped
inside his bunker,

00:53:40.166 --> 00:53:42.600
Private Rivera activated the
grenade with the full

00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:45.433
knowledge that it meant
his almost certain death.

00:53:45.433 --> 00:53:47.700
When the debris from the
explosion had cleared,

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:49.633
friendly forces recovered
a severely wounded

00:53:49.633 --> 00:53:51.734
Private Rivera and discovered
the bodies

00:53:51.734 --> 00:53:55.433
of four dead or dying enemy
soldiers surrounding him.

00:53:55.433 --> 00:53:57.533
Private Rivera's
extraordinary heroism

00:53:57.533 --> 00:54:00.100
and selflessness above and
beyond the call of duty

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:02.033
are in keeping with the
highest traditions

00:54:02.033 --> 00:54:04.800
of military service and
reflect great credit upon

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:07.200
himself, his unit and
the United States Army.

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:13.200
(The medal is presented.)
(applause)

00:54:32.934 --> 00:54:38.934
Military Aide: Joe Rodriguez
accepting on behalf of his

00:54:46.166 --> 00:54:48.667
uncle, Private Miguel A. Vera.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.133
Private Miguel A.

00:54:56.133 --> 00:54:58.800
Vera distinguished himself
by acts of gallantry and

00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.600
intrepidity above and
beyond the call of duty

00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:03.734
while serving as an
automatic rifleman with

00:55:03.734 --> 00:55:07.400
Company F, 38th Infantry
Regiment, 2d Infantry

00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:09.433
Division in Chorwon,
Korea,

00:55:09.433 --> 00:55:12.533
on September 21, 1952.

00:55:12.533 --> 00:55:14.533
That morning, despite
suffering from wounds

00:55:14.533 --> 00:55:16.333
inflicted in a previous
battle,

00:55:16.333 --> 00:55:18.600
Private Vera voluntarily left
the aid station

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:21.934
to join his comrades in an
attack against well-fortified

00:55:21.934 --> 00:55:25.633
enemy positions on a hill
of great importance.

00:55:25.633 --> 00:55:27.333
When the assaulting
elements had moved within

00:55:27.333 --> 00:55:29.533
twenty yards of the enemy
positions,

00:55:29.533 --> 00:55:32.367
they were suddenly trapped by a
heavy volume of mortar,

00:55:32.367 --> 00:55:35.000
artillery and
small-arms fire.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.367
The company prepared to
make a limited withdrawal,

00:55:37.367 --> 00:55:38.900
but Private Vera
volunteered

00:55:38.900 --> 00:55:42.233
to remain behind to provide
covering fire.

00:55:42.233 --> 00:55:44.800
As his companions moved
to safety, Private Vera

00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:47.200
remained steadfast in
his position, directing

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.633
accurate fire against the
hostile positions despite

00:55:49.633 --> 00:55:51.734
the intense volume of
fire which the enemy was

00:55:51.734 --> 00:55:53.934
concentrating upon him.

00:55:53.934 --> 00:55:55.767
Later in the morning,
when the friendly force

00:55:55.767 --> 00:55:58.033
returned, they discovered
Private Vera in the same

00:55:58.033 --> 00:56:00.567
position, facing
the enemy.

00:56:00.567 --> 00:56:02.533
Private Vera's noble
intrepidity

00:56:02.533 --> 00:56:06.567
and self-sacrifice saved many
of his comrades' lives.

00:56:06.567 --> 00:56:08.533
Private Vera's
extraordinary heroism

00:56:08.533 --> 00:56:11.667
and selflessness at the cost
of his own life, above and

00:56:11.667 --> 00:56:13.700
beyond the call of duty,
are in keeping with the

00:56:13.700 --> 00:56:16.300
highest traditions of
the military service and

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:19.266
reflect great credit upon
himself, his unit and the

00:56:19.266 --> 00:56:20.266
United States Army.

00:56:20.266 --> 00:56:26.266
(The medal is presented.)

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:55.200
(applause)

00:56:56.467 --> 00:57:02.533
Military Aide: Nancy Weinstein
accepting on behalf

00:57:23.433 --> 00:57:25.633
of her husband, Sergeant Jack Weinstein.

00:57:28.834 --> 00:57:31.333
Sergeant Jack Weinstein
distinguished himself by

00:57:31.333 --> 00:57:33.900
acts of gallantry and
intrepidity above and

00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:36.633
beyond the call of duty
while leading 1st Platoon,

00:57:36.633 --> 00:57:41.233
Company G, 21st Infantry
Regiment, 24th Infantry

00:57:41.233 --> 00:57:45.767
Division in Kumsong, Korea
on October 19, 1951.

00:57:45.767 --> 00:57:47.867
That afternoon,
thirty enemy troops

00:57:47.867 --> 00:57:51.033
counterattacked Sergeant
Weinstein's platoon.

00:57:51.033 --> 00:57:52.734
Most of the platoon's
members had been wounded

00:57:52.734 --> 00:57:54.333
in the previous action and
withdrew

00:57:54.333 --> 00:57:55.633
under the heavy fire.

00:57:55.633 --> 00:57:57.934
Sergeant Weinstein,
however, remained in his

00:57:57.934 --> 00:58:00.734
position and continued to
fight off the onrushing

00:58:00.734 --> 00:58:02.467
enemy, killing at least
six with

00:58:02.467 --> 00:58:05.967
his M-1 rifle before running
out of ammunition.

00:58:05.967 --> 00:58:08.367
Although under extremely
heavy enemy fire,

00:58:08.367 --> 00:58:10.834
Sergeant Weinstein refused to
withdraw and continued

00:58:10.834 --> 00:58:12.533
fighting by throwing enemy
hand grenades

00:58:12.533 --> 00:58:14.700
found lying near his position.

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.734
He again halted the
enemy's progress and

00:58:16.734 --> 00:58:18.700
inflicted numerous
casualties.

00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:20.834
Alone and unaided, he
held the ground

00:58:20.834 --> 00:58:23.300
which his platoon had fought
tenaciously to take

00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:25.500
and held out against
overwhelming odds until

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:28.133
another platoon was able
to relieve him and drive

00:58:28.133 --> 00:58:29.533
back the enemy.

00:58:29.533 --> 00:58:31.400
Sergeant Weinstein's leg
had been broken

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.800
by an enemy grenade and old
wounds suffered

00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:36.600
in previous battles had
reopened, but he refused

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:39.066
to withdraw and
successfully bought time

00:58:39.066 --> 00:58:41.834
for his wounded comrades
to reach friendly lines.

00:58:41.834 --> 00:58:44.367
Sergeant Weinstein's
extraordinary heroism and

00:58:44.367 --> 00:58:47.100
selflessness above and
beyond the call of duty

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:48.867
are in keeping with the
highest traditions of the

00:58:48.867 --> 00:58:51.600
military service and
reflect great credit upon

00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.000
himself, his unit and
the United States Army.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:59:00.066
(The medal is presented.)

00:59:10.367 --> 00:59:14.433

00:59:27.533 --> 00:59:29.533
Private Pedro Cano.

00:59:35.967 --> 00:59:37.700
Private Pedro Cano.

00:59:37.700 --> 00:59:40.667
acts of gallantry and
intrepidity above and

00:59:40.667 --> 00:59:43.200
beyond the call of duty
while serving with Company

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:46.734
C, 8th Infantry Regiment,
4th Infantry Division

00:59:46.734 --> 00:59:49.567
during combat operations
against an armed enemy

00:59:49.567 --> 00:59:54.600
in Schevenhutte, Germany on
December 2 and 3, 1944.

00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:57.333
On the afternoon of the
2nd, American infantrymen

00:59:57.333 --> 00:59:59.867
launched an attack against
German emplacements

00:59:59.867 --> 01:00:02.834
but were repulsed by enemy
machinegun fire.

01:00:02.834 --> 01:00:05.000
Armed with a rocket
launcher, Private Cano

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:08.033
crawled through a densely
mined area under heavy

01:00:08.033 --> 01:00:10.133
enemy fire and
successfully reached a

01:00:10.133 --> 01:00:13.667
point within ten yards of
the nearest emplacement.

01:00:13.667 --> 01:00:16.533
He quickly fired a rocket
into the position, killing

01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:19.734
the two gunners and five
supporting riflemen.

01:00:19.734 --> 01:00:22.166
Without hesitating, he
fired into a second

01:00:22.166 --> 01:00:24.867
position, killing two more
gunners, and proceeded

01:00:24.867 --> 01:00:27.200
to assault the position with
hand grenades, killing

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:30.133
several others and
dispersing the rest.

01:00:30.133 --> 01:00:32.567
Then, when an adjacent
company encountered heavy

01:00:32.567 --> 01:00:36.567
fire, Private Cano crossed
his company front, crept

01:00:36.567 --> 01:00:38.800
to within fifteen yards
of the nearest enemy

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.300
emplacement and killed the
two machinegunners

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.867
with a rocket.

01:00:42.867 --> 01:00:44.700
With another round he
killed two more gunners

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:46.734
and destroyed
a second gun.

01:00:46.734 --> 01:00:49.433
On the following day, his
company renewed the attack

01:00:49.433 --> 01:00:52.400
and again encountered
heavy machinegun fire.

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.800
Private Cano, armed with
his rocket launcher,

01:00:54.800 --> 01:00:57.800
again moved across fire-swept
terrain and destroyed

01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.400
three enemy machineguns in
succession,

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.667
killing the six gunners.

01:01:02.667 --> 01:01:04.467
Private Cano's
extraordinary heroism and

01:01:04.467 --> 01:01:07.166
selflessness above and
beyond the call of duty

01:01:07.166 --> 01:01:08.667

highest traditions of

01:01:08.667 --> 01:01:11.100

reflect great credit upon

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.734
himself, his unit and
the United States Army.

01:01:13.734 --> 01:01:19.734
(The medal is presented.)

01:01:28.433 --> 01:01:32.133

Private Joe Gandara
distinguished himself

01:01:51.567 --> 01:01:54.367
by acts of gallantry and
intrepidity above and

01:01:54.367 --> 01:01:56.867

operations against an
armed enemy

01:02:06.133 --> 01:02:09.934
in Amfreville, France on June 9, 1944.

01:02:09.934 --> 01:02:12.500
On that day, Private
Gandara's detachment came

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.367
under devastating enemy
fire from a strong German

01:02:15.367 --> 01:02:17.300
force, pinning the men to
the ground

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.600
for a period of four hours.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.066
Private Gandara
voluntarily advanced alone

01:02:22.066 --> 01:02:23.900
toward the enemy position.

01:02:23.900 --> 01:02:26.266
Firing his machinegun
from his hip as he moved

01:02:26.266 --> 01:02:28.934
forward, he destroyed
three hostile machineguns

01:02:28.934 --> 01:02:31.133
before he was
fatally wounded.

01:02:31.133 --> 01:02:33.467
Private Gandara's
extraordinary heroism and

01:02:33.467 --> 01:02:36.467
selflessness at the cost
of his own life, above and

01:02:36.467 --> 01:02:38.667
beyond the call of duty,
are in keeping with the

Lara.

01:03:18.834 --> 01:03:20.900
Private First
Class Salvador J.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.800
Lara distinguished himself
by acts of gallantry and

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.633
intrepidity above and
beyond the call of duty

01:03:26.633 --> 01:03:29.200
while serving as the Squad
Leader of a rifle squad

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:32.166
with 2d Platoon, Company
L, 180th Infantry, 45th

01:03:32.166 --> 01:03:36.734
Infantry Division during

01:03:36.734 --> 01:03:40.900
an armed enemy in Aprilia,
Italy on May 27 and 28,

01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:43.266
1944.

01:03:43.266 --> 01:03:45.667
On the afternoon of the
27th, Private First Class

01:03:45.667 --> 01:03:48.133
Lara aggressively led
his rifle squad in

01:03:48.133 --> 01:03:51.133
neutralizing multiple
enemy strongpoints and in

01:03:51.133 --> 01:03:53.500
inflicting large numbers
of casualties on the

01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:54.934
enemy.

01:03:54.934 --> 01:03:57.133
Having taken his initial
objective, Private First

01:03:57.133 --> 01:03:59.467
Class Lara noticed that
the unit to his right was

01:03:59.467 --> 01:04:01.667
meeting stiff resistance
from a large,

01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:05.066
well-entrenched enemy
force in a deep ditch.

01:04:05.066 --> 01:04:07.533
Private First Class Lara
quickly gathered three men

01:04:07.533 --> 01:04:09.533
and attacked a wide
section of the enemy

01:04:09.533 --> 01:04:12.934
position, killing four,
forcing fifteen others

01:04:12.934 --> 01:04:15.767
to surrender and causing two
enemy mortar crews to

01:04:15.767 --> 01:04:17.500
abandon their weapons.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.033
His fearless and efficient
performance enabled both

01:04:20.033 --> 01:04:22.433
his own unit and the unit
to his right to continue

01:04:22.433 --> 01:04:24.233
to their objective.

01:04:24.233 --> 01:04:25.934
The next morning, as
his company resumed

01:04:25.934 --> 01:04:28.567
the attack, Private First
Class Lara sustained

01:04:28.567 --> 01:04:30.934
a severe leg wound, but did
not stop

01:04:30.934 --> 01:04:32.667
to receive first aid.

01:04:32.667 --> 01:04:35.233
His company suffered heavy
casualties as a result

01:04:35.233 --> 01:04:37.333
of withering machinegun fire
coming from

01:04:37.333 --> 01:04:40.200
an enemy strongpoint on
the right flank.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.834
After requesting
permission to destroy

01:04:41.834 --> 01:04:44.533
the enemy machineguns armed
only with a Browning

01:04:44.533 --> 01:04:47.033
Automatic Rifle, Private
First Class Lara

01:04:47.033 --> 01:04:50.100
crawled alone toward the
nearest machinegun.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:52.533
Despite his painful wound
and the extreme danger

01:04:52.533 --> 01:04:54.667
of the task, he rose and
fearlessly

01:04:54.667 --> 01:04:57.667
charged the nest, killing
the crew members.

01:04:57.667 --> 01:04:59.567
Another machinegun opened
fire on him,

01:04:59.567 --> 01:05:02.133
but he quickly neutralized this
weapon with accurate fire

01:05:02.133 --> 01:05:05.600
from his Browning, killing
three more of the enemy.

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.433
His aggressive attack
forced two other

01:05:07.433 --> 01:05:10.266
machinegun crews to
flee their weapons.

01:05:10.266 --> 01:05:12.233
After rejoining his
company, Private First

01:05:12.233 --> 01:05:15.000
Class Lara continued his
exemplary performance

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.300
until he captured
his objective.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.133

extraordinary heroism and

01:05:20.133 --> 01:05:22.734

himself, his unit and
the United States Army.

combat operations against
an armed enemy near

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:36.533
St. Die, France on
November 7, 1944.

01:06:36.533 --> 01:06:38.400
Private First Class
Leonard's platoon was

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.633
reduced to eight men as
a result of blistering

01:06:40.633 --> 01:06:42.767
artillery, mortar,
machinegun,

01:06:42.767 --> 01:06:44.233
and rifle fire.

01:06:44.233 --> 01:06:46.500
Private First Class
Leonard led the survivors

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.900
in an assault over a hill
covered by trees and

01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:51.533
shrubs which the enemy
continuously swept with

01:06:51.533 --> 01:06:53.767
automatic weapons fire.

01:06:53.767 --> 01:06:56.000

killing its two-man crew.

01:07:05.734 --> 01:07:08.300
Though momentarily stunned
by an exploding bazooka

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:11.100
shell, Private First Class
Leonard relentlessly

01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:13.333
advanced, ultimately
knocking out a second

01:07:13.333 --> 01:07:15.200
machinegun nest and capturing

Battaglia, Italy on
October 4, 1944.

01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:19.433
That afternoon, the
enemy launched a violent

01:08:19.433 --> 01:08:22.567
counterattack preceded by
a heavy mortar barrage.

01:08:22.567 --> 01:08:25.100
Staff Sergeant Mendoza,
already wounded in the arm

01:08:25.100 --> 01:08:27.967

01:08:32.433 --> 01:08:35.066
up the slopes employing
flame-throwers, machine

01:08:35.066 --> 01:08:38.100
pistols, rifles,
and hand grenades.

01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.934
Staff Sergeant Mendoza
immediately began

01:08:39.934 --> 01:08:42.367
to engage the enemy, firing
five clips

01:08:42.367 --> 01:08:45.133
and killing ten enemy soldiers.

01:08:45.133 --> 01:08:46.633
After exhausting his
ammunition,

01:08:46.633 --> 01:08:48.667
he picked up a carbine and
emptied

01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:50.467
its magazine at the enemy.

01:08:50.467 --> 01:08:52.133
By this time, an
enemy soldier with

01:08:52.133 --> 01:08:54.900
a flame-thrower had almost
reached the crest,

01:08:54.900 --> 01:08:57.467
but was quickly eliminated as
Staff Sergeant Mendoza

01:08:57.467 --> 01:09:00.200
drew his pistol and fired.

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.700
Seeing that the enemy
force continued

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:03.834
to advance, Staff Sergeant
Mendoza

01:09:03.834 --> 01:09:06.066
jumped into a machinegun
emplacement that had just been

01:09:06.066 --> 01:09:08.500
abandoned and opened fire.

01:09:08.500 --> 01:09:10.500
Unable to engage the
entire enemy force from

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.700
his location, he picked up
the machinegun

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:15.900
and moved forward, firing from
his hip and spraying a

01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:18.834
withering hail of bullets
into the oncoming enemy,

01:09:18.834 --> 01:09:21.500
causing them to
break into confusion.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.400
He then set the machinegun
on the ground and

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:26.133
continued to fire
until the gun jammed.

01:09:26.133 --> 01:09:28.600
Without hesitating, Staff
Sergeant Mendoza began

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.834
throwing hand grenades at
the enemy,

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:32.600
causing them to flee.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.700
After the enemy had
withdrawn, he advanced

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:36.734
down the forward slope
of the hill, retrieved

01:09:36.734 --> 01:09:39.633
numerous enemy weapons
scattered about the area,

01:09:39.633 --> 01:09:41.967
captured a wounded enemy
soldier, and returned

01:09:41.967 --> 01:09:43.700
to consolidate friendly
positions

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.633
with all available men.

01:09:45.633 --> 01:09:48.200
Staff Sergeant Mendoza's
gallant stand resulted

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.867
in thirty German soldiers
killed and the successful

01:09:50.867 --> 01:09:52.500
defense of the hill.

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:54.667
Staff Sergeant Mendoza's
extraordinary heroism

01:09:54.667 --> 01:09:56.800
and selflessness above and
beyond the call

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:59.233
of duty are in keeping with the
highest traditions

01:09:59.233 --> 01:10:01.700
of military service and
reflect great credit upon

01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:04.300
himself, his unit and
the United States Army.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:10.300
(The medal is presented.)
(applause)

01:10:23.467 --> 01:10:29.467
Military Aide: Robert Nietzel accepting

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.333
on behalf of his first cousin,

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:41.200
Sergeant Alfred B. Nietzel.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.967
Sergeant Alfred B. Nietzel

01:10:42.967 --> 01:10:44.367
distinguished
himself by acts of

01:10:44.367 --> 01:10:47.100
gallantry and intrepidity
above and beyond the call

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:50.133
of duty while serving as a
section leader for Company

01:10:50.133 --> 01:10:54.066
H, 16th Infantry Regiment,
1st Infantry Division

01:10:54.066 --> 01:10:57.000
during combat operations
against an armed enemy

01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.033
in Heistern, Germany on
November 18, 1944.

01:11:01.033 --> 01:11:03.700
That afternoon, Sergeant
Nietzel fought tenaciously

01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.967
to repel a vicious enemy
attack against his unit.

01:11:06.967 --> 01:11:09.300
Sergeant Nietzel employed
accurate, intense fire

01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.467
from his machinegun and
successfully

01:11:11.467 --> 01:11:13.333
slowed the hostile advance.

01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:15.166
However, the overwhelming
enemy force

01:11:15.166 --> 01:11:17.433
continued to press forward.

01:11:17.433 --> 01:11:20.000
Realizing he desperately
needed reinforcements,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.967
Sergeant Nietzel ordered
the three remaining

01:11:21.967 --> 01:11:23.934
members of his squad to
return to the company

01:11:23.934 --> 01:11:25.033
command post
and secure aid.

01:11:25.033 --> 01:11:27.200
He immediately turned his
attention

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.467
to covering their movement
with his fire.

01:11:29.467 --> 01:11:32.033
After expending all his
machinegun ammunition,

01:11:32.033 --> 01:11:34.433
Sergeant Nietzel began
firing his rifle into the

01:11:34.433 --> 01:11:36.400
attacking ranks until
he was killed by the

01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.467
explosion of an
enemy grenade.

01:11:38.467 --> 01:11:40.767
Sergeant Nietzel's
extraordinary heroism and

01:11:40.767 --> 01:11:43.767
selflessness at the cost
of his own life, above and

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:46.033
beyond the call of duty,
are in keeping with the

01:11:46.033 --> 01:11:48.500
highest traditions of
military service and

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:51.266
reflect great credit upon
himself, his unit and the

01:11:51.266 --> 01:11:52.266
United States Army.

01:11:52.266 --> 01:11:58.266
(The medal is presented.)

01:12:24.166 --> 01:12:32.100
(applause)

01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:38.100
Military Aide: Dr. Terry
Schwab accepting on behalf

01:12:52.533 --> 01:12:55.600
of his father, First Lieutenant Donald K. Schwab.

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:01.467
First Lieutenant Donald K. Schwab

01:13:01.467 --> 01:13:02.800
distinguished
himself by acts of

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:05.700
gallantry and intrepidity
above and beyond the call

01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:08.734
of duty while serving as
the Commander of Company

01:13:08.734 --> 01:13:12.600
E, 15th Infantry Regiment,
3d Infantry Division,

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.367
during combat operations
against an armed enemy

01:13:15.367 --> 01:13:20.500
near Lure, France on
September 17, 1944.

01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.734
That afternoon, as First
Lieutenant Schwab led his

01:13:22.734 --> 01:13:25.400
company across four
hundred yards of exposed

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:28.033
ground, an intense,
grazing burst of

01:13:28.033 --> 01:13:30.834
machinegun and
machine-pistol fire sprung

01:13:30.834 --> 01:13:33.900
forth without warning from
a fringe of woods directly

01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:36.300
in front of the
American force.

01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.967
First Lieutenant Schwab
quickly extricated his men

01:13:38.967 --> 01:13:41.467
from the attempted ambush
and led them back

01:13:41.467 --> 01:13:43.166
to a defiladed position.

01:13:43.166 --> 01:13:46.200
Soon after, he was ordered
to overwhelm the enemy line.

01:13:46.867 --> 01:13:48.500
He rapidly organized his
men into

01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:51.367
a skirmish line and, with
indomitable courage,

01:13:51.367 --> 01:13:54.900
again led them forward into the
lethal enemy fire.

01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.500
When halted a second time,
First Lieutenant Schwab

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.633
moved from man to man to
supervise collection

01:13:59.633 --> 01:14:03.266
of the wounded and organize
his company's withdrawal.

01:14:03.266 --> 01:14:06.200
From defilade, he rallied
his decimated force for a

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.533
third charge on the
hostile strong point and

01:14:08.533 --> 01:14:10.834
successfully worked his
way to within fifty yards

01:14:10.834 --> 01:14:12.633
of the Germans before
ordering

01:14:12.633 --> 01:14:15.266
his men to hit the dirt.

01:14:15.266 --> 01:14:17.600
While automatic weapons
fire blazed around him,

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:20.367
he rushed forward alone,
firing his carbine

01:14:20.367 --> 01:14:23.233
at the German foxholes, aiming
for the vital enemy

01:14:23.233 --> 01:14:25.800
machine-pistol nest which
had sparked the German

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:28.500
resistance and caused
heavy casualties among his men.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.467
Silhouetted through the
mist and rain by enemy

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:34.233
flares, he charged to the
German emplacement,

01:14:34.233 --> 01:14:36.834
ripped the half-cover off the
hostile firing pit,

01:14:36.834 --> 01:14:40.166
struck the German gunner on the
head with his carbine butt

01:14:40.166 --> 01:14:42.100
and dragged the German
back through a hail of

01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:44.133
fire to friendly lines.

01:14:44.133 --> 01:14:46.633
First Lieutenant Schwab's
action so disorganized

01:14:46.633 --> 01:14:48.800
hostile infantry
resistance that the enemy

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:51.033
forces withdrew,
abandoning their

01:14:51.033 --> 01:14:53.100
formidable defensive line.

01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:55.700
First Lieutenant Schwab's
extraordinary heroism and

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:58.400
selflessness above and
beyond the call of duty

01:14:58.400 --> 01:14:59.867
are in keeping with the
highest traditions

01:14:59.867 --> 01:15:02.467
of military service and
reflect great credit upon

01:15:02.467 --> 01:15:08.467
himself, his unit and
the United States Army.

01:15:23.467 --> 01:15:29.467
(The medal is presented.)

01:15:39.066 --> 01:15:42.967
(applause)

01:15:42.967 --> 01:15:48.967
The President: Ladies and gentlemen,

01:16:03.133 --> 01:16:05.934
it is very rare where
we have

01:16:05.934 --> 01:16:10.900
the opportunity to reflect
on the extraordinary

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:15.800
courage and patriotism
of such a remarkable

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.333
collection of men.

01:16:19.333 --> 01:16:22.600
We are so
grateful to them.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:26.133
We are so grateful
to their families.

01:16:26.133 --> 01:16:31.433
It makes us proud and
it makes us inspired.

01:16:31.433 --> 01:16:33.467
And so, before we conclude
the program,

01:16:33.467 --> 01:16:38.867
I would ask all those who have
witnessed this

01:16:38.867 --> 01:16:43.834
extraordinary day to
please rise and give these

01:16:43.834 --> 01:16:46.333
latest recipients of
the Medal of Honor your

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:52.033
warmest applause.

01:16:52.033 --> 01:16:53.033
(applause)

01:16:53.033 --> 01:16:54.033
Chaplain, would you give

01:16:54.033 --> 01:16:55.033
us the benediction?

01:16:55.033 --> 01:16:56.033
(A prayer is offered)

01:16:56.033 --> 01:16:57.033
Thank you so much,

01:16:57.033 --> 01:16:58.033
everybody.

01:16:58.033 --> 01:16:59.033
This concludes
our program.

01:16:59.033 --> 01:17:00.100
But please have an
opportunity

01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:01.100
to enjoy the White House.

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.100
We are so grateful that
all of you had

01:17:02.100 --> 01:17:03.100
a chance to come.

01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:04.100
God bless you.

01:17:04.100 --> 01:17:05.100
God bless America.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.100
(applause)
