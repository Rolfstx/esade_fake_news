00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.250
If you're one of the four billion people who flew last year

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.210
chances are you flew on either an Airbus or Boeing aircraft.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.890
The Airbus-Boeing duopoly dominates the already under competitive

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.760
aircraft manufacturing industry by producing more than 99% of

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.960
its large airplane orders globally. It's become one of the most

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.870
efficient duopolies ever in the history of manufacturing

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.440
Are smaller competitors finally giving them a run for their

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.640
money? Or are they just getting scooped up? Will China step into

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.840
the market and make waves? What about the future of flying? Will

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.840
Supersonic planes challenge Airbus and Boeing's dominance?

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.830
Before we answer those questions let's start with how we got to

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.680
a place where just two companies own the air

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.770
Boeing has always been a big player in the aviation field for

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.860
over 100 years. The Boeing Company was created in 1916. William

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.980
Boeing founded the Aero Products Company and developed a single

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.300
engine seaplane and the business was renamed the Boeing Company

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.750
and sold its planes to the Navy during the First World War

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.610
Boeing continued to sell its aircraft during the 1920s and 1930s

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.110
to the U.S. military. During this time Boeing also expanded into

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.160
airmail services.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:30.230
In 1919 Eddie Hubbard and I took a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:35.120
flight up to Vancouver B.C. This was the first ever

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.540
international mail ever carried by planes into the United

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.870
States.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.120
The Boeing Airplane and Transportation Corporation was formed and

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.170
it covered both the manufacturing and airline operations but the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.550
Air Mail Act of 1934 split aircraft manufacturers from air

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.000
transport. So the conglomerate of the day was dissolved in the

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.810
company went back to being called "Boeing." With the development

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.190
of turbo jets, the Boeing 707 was introduced to the public in

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.370
1958 on Pan American's trans Atlantic route and the public loved

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.750
it With smoother rides and a shorter flight time Boeing paved

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.290
the way for the future of commercial flight. Boeing may

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.310
encapsulate Americana via the golden age of flying but the much

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.090
younger Airbus had a rough road to success. It started as a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.210
group effort in Europe to take on American manufacturers.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.970
In 1967 Germany, France, and Britain came to the agreement that a

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.390
cooperation of aviation field would promote technology and

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.860
economic growth in Europe. They drew up plans for a short haul

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.070
European Airbus that would accommodate the public's desire to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.010
fly more for less. Plans were made to construct the A300. In

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.760
October of 1972 the A300 completed its first flight. But Airbus

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.510
leaders had an uphill battle ahead of them convincing the world

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.820
they created the most innovative aircraft. By 1984 Airbus

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.820
received 411 orders and had 282 aircraft in active service. The

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.810
persistence paid off the long run because in 2018 Airbus

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.340
delivered 800 planes. 11% growth from the year before. And

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.750
Boeing's business is thriving as well. In 2018 the company set

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.590
the record for the most airplane deliveries with 806 commercial

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.440
jets, 5.6% growth from 2017. And the stocks have reflected the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.980
company's dominance. Both Airbus and Boeing stocks have

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.390
significantly outperformed the S&amp;P 500 over the last 10 years.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.830
How can you tell these planes apart? Boeing and Airbus have

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.480
subtle differences. For instance the cockpit of a Boeing 737 has

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.970
a yoke control whereas an Airbus A320 does not. That's just one

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.910
of the many ways these companies diverge in their manufacturing.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.960
Most are only felt by the crew and travelers with a keen eye.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.130
How do airlines decide which company to buy from? Think of it

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.340
like going to a car dealership and choosing between a Chevy and

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.640
a Ford. Both are supposed to get you to your destination but

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.880
which one has a better deal? And what does the existing fleet

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.900
look like? For example, Spirit and Frontier operate only

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.190
Airbus, while Southwest is an all Boeing fleet. It's hard for

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.910
low cost operations like these to switch. The legacy airlines

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.470
usually have a mix of both.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.260
So what does it take for companies like Airbus and Boeing to

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.460
control the airline industry? Well, building these airplanes

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.990
isn't cheap. To be a real competitor aviation companies must

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.220
have the money to spend.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.960
The barriers to entry in this business are huge in terms of

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.920
capital requirements, in terms of technology experience,

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.630
customer support, customer finance, all of these things.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.190
A single plane can run up millions of dollars in construction

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.330
fees. Boeing is currently working on a new series of airplanes

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.850
called the 777X. A single 777-9 has a list price of

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:19.160
$388.7 million dollars. That's because there are hundreds of

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.290
thousands of components to an airplane. A Boeing 747 alone is

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:29.120
made up of six million parts. But materials aren't the only

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.720
thing that costs aviation companies big. Safety comes with a

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.950
hefty price tag.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.240
It's definitely a well-regulated industry. I don't think there's

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.860
any question about that. I actually view much, not

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.670
all, but I view much of that

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:48.050
regulation has a historical partnership that has actually served

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.520
the industry quite well. If you consider that the airlines today

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.930
aviation globally carries three billion passengers a

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.550
year and most years kill fewer than 500 of them. Some years

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.110
none. That's a pretty extraordinary record. And reaching that

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.150
level of safety requires a great expense And these massive

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.890
companies have plenty of money

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:18.420
And at least for Boeing a lot of it comes from the government. It

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.710
was the second largest government contractor in 2017 behind only

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.600
Lockheed Martin bringing in more than 23 billion dollars. It

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.300
also spends big to keep its close relationship with Washington.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.930
The company spent more on lobbying than any other company in the

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:39.180
United States other than General Electric from 1998 to 2018

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.420
according to Open Secrets 270 million dollars. The acting

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:49.890
Secretary of Defense at the beginning of 2019 is a former Boeing

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:54.420
executive that led the 787 Dreamliner program. And the acting

00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:58.410
administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration or the FAA

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.500
used to work for an airline manufacturing industry group

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.610
Responding to a question about its lobbying power. Boeing told

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:09.300
CNBC this "as the nation's largest exporter and a leading

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.910
producer of both commercial and defense aerospace

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.660
products, there are a number of significant policy issues at the

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:19.470
federal state and local levels with the potential to impact our

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:24.090
business our diverse workforce and our supply chain. Our team is

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.850
focused on telling Boeing"s story and supporting policies that

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.150
advance the aviation industry and U.S. manufacturing in the

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:34.260
communities where we live and work." The company's entrenched

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.460
position has a real world impact. When Delta ordered planes from

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.810
the Canadian company Bombardier in 2016, the company fought hard

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:46.020
arguing the smaller competitor could only sell them at such a

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.500
low price to the Canadian subsidies. The Trump administration

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:53.160
originally sided with Boeing putting tariffs on the planes but

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.400
Boeing ended up losing the battle when the U.S. International

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:59.610
Trade Commission ruled in Bombardier's is favor at the beginning

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.930
of 2018. The battle showed how hard it has become for smaller

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:07.440
companies to break into the market. Which brings us exactly to

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.810
that where is the competition?

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.010
Airbus and Boeing may command domestic and international airspace

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.520
but for regional flights the Canadian company Bombardier and the

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.510
Brazilian company Embraer control the market or at least they

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:25.440
used to. The overhead for the aviation manufacturing business

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:28.590
can be crushing and regional aircraft manufacturers like

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.180
Bombardier a couldn't shoulder the costs. Bombardier of

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.610
Canada had the

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.000
The best hope of getting in they simply ran out of cash. And this

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.750
year their jetliner was basically absorbed by Airbus.

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:45.630
Now the Airbus A220 rather than the Bombardier C-Series. In 2017

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:48.210
Airbus announced it would acquire a majority stake in

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:52.620
Bombardier's C-Series. Airbus rebranded the series as a new a

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:57.810
220 and sold 120 former C-Series jets to U.S. airline companies

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.100
in 2018. Airbus will begin building the aircraft later this

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.820
month. And let's not forget about Brazilian aircraft company

00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:10.170
Embraer the other regional jet manufacturer. Boeing just bought

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:15.090
80% of Embraer commercial aviation business for a whopping $4.2

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.210
billion dollars. The Brazilian government approved the deal in

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.630
January and both companies announced that they expect to get all

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:25.950
the remaining approvals before 2020. The reality was that these

00:09:25.950 --> 00:09:28.380
smaller companies weren't really competing anyway.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.270
In 2016 regional aircraft deliveries were less than 7% of the

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:39.960
airplane market by value. Other countries like Russia and China

00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:42.600
have also been trying to become prominent players in the

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.040
aircraft manufacturing industry. But so far both countries have

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.300
been unable to make a dent in the private sector.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:52.950
They could flip a switch and they'd be great at it. The

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:56.730
frustrating thing about China is that the only possible thing

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:59.970
they could do wrong is exactly what they're doing. They've got

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.780
the biggest market in the world. They've got limited talent on

00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:06.450
limited resources. They should be great in this. But the

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:10.880
strategy they're pursuing is basically digging a giant hole.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.330
They're running it as a government operation and very simply

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.120
government owned industries to not do a good job beating

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:22.080
commercial market needs. Next thing they're doing is rather than

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.680
saying to their engineers, "hey you can go shopping for the best

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.350
components and technology around the globe..." They're saying

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:32.670
you have to buy stuff made in China and that means only stuff

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.720
that involves Western companies coming to China and surrendering

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:37.860
their intellectual property.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.940
Boeing and Airbus aren't shying away from potential competition.

00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:45.930
Boeing highlighted its partnership with COMAC on a completion of

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.740
a facility in Zhoushan. The company also told us, "China's

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:53.460
commercial aviation sector represents a major customer an

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.480
important partner in a potent competitor. China is on track to

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.720
become the largest commercial airplane market in the world over

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.720
the next few years. Getting the right balance between

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.600
collaborating and competing requires work in constant

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.440
evaluation." When we asked Airbus about Chinese competition

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.700
they told CNBC this "the Boeing Airbus to Oxley isn't likely to

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:18.510
last forever. In general we see China as the next major

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.530
competitor though in some 10 to 20 years from now. The Chinese

00:11:22.530 --> 00:11:25.650
market is large enough for more than two competitors in every

00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:29.340
market we welcome competition. Airbus was born competition,

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:32.310
thrives in it, and believes it is good for the development of

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.970
our industry.

00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:38.220
So what's next for the aviation industry? Will it be the return

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:42.450
of supersonic travel? The aptly named Colorado-based company

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.990
Boom Supersonic announced it has received millions in funding

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:49.620
from investors. Boom is looking to make supersonic travel

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:54.060
mainstream. Marketing their aircraft is being able to get

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:58.110
passengers to and from their destinations two times faster than

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:02.370
business class flights today. Commercial supersonic travel isn't

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:07.170
new. In 1976 the first Concorde flights took off from London and

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.760
just outside Paris. But the Concorde days were short lived.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.480
Noise pollution, mounting expenses, combined with a fatal air

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.980
crash caused the Concorde to be retired in 2003. But there are

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:22.590
many barriers sitting in the way of creating supersonic

00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.870
commercial travel. The first being

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.950
it's illegal. They would have to demonstrate that these are

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.440
usable over land. At present it's not legal to operate

00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.780
supersonically over landmasses at least in the U.S. NASA been

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.810
testing so called "quiet boom" aircraft

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.970
in fact they're testing them right now in the Gulf of

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:48.800
Mexico, the people of Galveston Texas are the dummies I guess to

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:53.220
see whether they notice the booms. It remains to be seen whether

00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.520
those theoretical designs can be put into practice.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:02.430
But the big question is can supersonic travel be economically

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.030
feasible?

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:07.020
Will they be willing to pay five times as much for the aircraft

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.760
and their operating costs in order to go twice as fast because

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:15.360
the fuel bill basically piles up. We're now flying slower than

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.340
we did in 1970s and 80s

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.670
but on the other hand there's this economic reason for that.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.480
It's not just civilian companies developing supersonic travel.

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.500
Lockheed Martin announced plans to build supersonic aircraft

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.830
that could change commercial travel. Lockheed Martin is

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:38.070
partnering with NASA to develop the X59 QueSST. This aircraft is

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.640
designed to have a cruising altitude of 55,000 feet and a

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.410
terminal speed of 940 miles per hour. And forget that super

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:50.550
alarming sonic boom. According to the Lockheed Martin Skunkworks

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:54.060
team the plane would create a sound no louder than the slamming

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.110
of a car door. But the development is still in its beta stages.

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:03.090
As for Boeing and Airbus both companies told us supersonic and

00:14:03.090 --> 00:14:06.840
hypersonic travel is on their radars and that they are committed

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.080
to pursuing multiple innovative technologies moving forward.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:14.490
The future of the aviation manufacturing business remains

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:15.060
unclear.

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.920
But one thing is clear the multi-billion dollar industry will

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.610
continue to grow as millions of more people around the world

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:27.660
enter the middle class. The International Air Transport

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.340
Association expects the number of air travelers to double to 8.2

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:37.490
billion by 2037 and Airbus and Boeing are poised to take a

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:39.400
vantage of those soaring trends.
