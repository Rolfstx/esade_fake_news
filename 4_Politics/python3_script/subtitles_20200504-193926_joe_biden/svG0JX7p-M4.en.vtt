00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.008
- In The Bronx, one of the
number one diet-related diseases

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.710
is Type 2 Diabetes.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:16.383
Everyone knows a family
member or friend or colleague

00:00:16.383 --> 00:00:18.451
who suffers from
Type 2 Diabetes,

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:20.854
which can be prevented.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:31.998
My brother had Type 2 Diabetes.

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:40.573
My brother, at one time, was
on 30 different medications.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.075
I told him, I says,

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:44.577
look, you have hypertension,
you have heart disease.

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:47.747
I said, we can work out
together, we can do exercise.

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:48.648
We can change diet.

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:49.749
We'll work it together.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:53.119
February 2010,

00:00:54.287 --> 00:00:55.789
that was it.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.424
He passed away.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:02.328
So I firsthand know the
effects of having a person

00:01:03.196 --> 00:01:04.831
with Diabetes in my family,

00:01:04.831 --> 00:01:05.932
and it was my brother.

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:14.908
This is The Tale of Two
Cities, here in The Bronx.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.546
We are surrounded
by unhealthy food.

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:21.614
We have the bodegas.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.117
You open the door,

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:27.020
and the first thing that
hits you are the racks

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.891
of cookies and cakes
and candies and sodas.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.461
(somber music)

00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:41.201
And then you go in to more
affluent neighborhoods,

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.707
and I walk into the store
and there are the vegetables.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.178
Here are the healthy
food options.

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:02.455
But the question I ask is: why?

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:04.090
Why does it have
to be like that?

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:07.927
Why don't people
have access to food?

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:11.564
Why is it that they can't
afford cold, fresh vegetables?

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:12.999
Why is it that supermarkets

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.200
or other stores don't wanna come

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.702
into low-income neighborhoods?

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:22.308
And so people are now calling
our community food deserts.

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:24.811
It's like, wait a second.

00:02:24.811 --> 00:02:28.014
You're getting it wrong,
because we do have food.

00:02:28.014 --> 00:02:30.517
What we don't have is
healthy food options.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:34.888
I moved to The
Bronx back in 1985.

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:37.457
Across the street
was an empty lot.

00:02:37.457 --> 00:02:41.294
And I see a man with
a shovel and a pick.

00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:47.100
He says, I'm thinkin'
about putting a garden.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.301
Woo!

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.269
I was so excited!

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.370
I said, ooh, can I help?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.039
I was so excited, because,

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.474
a garden?

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.942
Wow!

00:02:55.942 --> 00:02:57.977
That would make the neighborhood
really, really look good.

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:02.182
When I first put that
tomato seed in the ground,

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:04.951
I was mesmerized by the
fact that it grew on a vine.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.787
My relationship to a tomato
was that it was in the store.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:11.157
I took it off the vine
and I bit into it,

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:12.859
and it just changed my world.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.263
That taste of sunshine, of
juiciness, of sweetness.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:22.135
This year we're
celebrating 30 years.

00:03:22.135 --> 00:03:26.172
From an empty lot
full of garbage

00:03:26.172 --> 00:03:29.676
to, now, a community garden

00:03:29.676 --> 00:03:34.314
which is the glue
of this community.

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:36.482
(uplifting music)

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:37.417
Hey, girls!

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:38.251
Y'all hungry?

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:51.731
(chickens clucking)

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:52.565
No fighting!

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.370
- [Neighbor] Oh, yeah,
wait 'til you find more out

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.105
about what happened
to this garden.

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:01.341
You'll be like, I'm
happy all the time!

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.408
- Hi!

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:03.977
Hi, everybody!

00:04:03.977 --> 00:04:07.914
So, I'm the farmer here at
The Garden of Happiness.

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:09.349
How many people eat food?

00:04:10.516 --> 00:04:12.118
How many people
eat healthy food?

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.188
What are you not allowed to do?

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:17.390
- Eat junk.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:18.224
- Excellent.

00:04:18.224 --> 00:04:19.225
Eat junk.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:20.193
So when we talk about junk,

00:04:20.193 --> 00:04:21.694
what's junk?

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:25.131
(children all talking at
once...candy, burgers...)

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:26.366
You know what happens

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:28.501
when people eat a lot
of stuff with sugar?

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.104
- You get like--

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:31.938
- Diabetes?

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:32.872
- Diabetes!

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:35.541
That's a big word, Diabetes.

00:04:35.541 --> 00:04:36.843
Come on, let's go
see the chickens.

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:37.744
- [Children] Yay!

00:04:40.713 --> 00:04:42.081
- We gotta go, we're
goin' to see the chickens.

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:43.516
We gotta make chicken noise.

00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:46.352
(everyone clucks)

00:04:51.357 --> 00:04:56.029
When you're starting to
see adult onset Diabetes

00:04:57.497 --> 00:05:01.868
in children, then that's an
alarm that needs to go off.

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:09.442
This is directly
related to diet.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.684
I live in a community with
limited access to growing food.

00:05:19.052 --> 00:05:22.488
I'm still marginalized because
of the color of my skin.

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:26.459
I need to be actively engaging

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:28.961
on breaking down those barriers

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:31.597
and working on some of
the injustices that I see.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:33.666
It's time to go to the market.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:37.670
All right.

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:50.149
One thing that the
community takes pride of is

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:52.018
that we're at their service.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:54.320
And I have plums.

00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:57.523
(bags rustling)

00:05:57.523 --> 00:05:59.225
- Those tomatoes,
how do you eat them?

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.460
- Just slice 'em.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.294
- [Customer] And just
eat them regular?

00:06:01.294 --> 00:06:03.563
- Just eat 'em regular.

00:06:03.563 --> 00:06:06.032
- [Customer] I wanna
live a little longer.

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:07.300
- All right, have a blessed day.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.001
- You, too, darlin'.

00:06:09.001 --> 00:06:10.503
(kids clucking and laughing)

00:06:10.503 --> 00:06:12.071
- In the garden, I just
want people to understand

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:13.473
where their food comes from.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.711
We are surrounded by
fast food restaurants.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:21.547
With the garden,
we have a choice

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:24.183
to be able to grow
healthy food options.

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:26.586
Do you see healthy food
in the garden here?

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:27.820
- Yes!

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.888
- Where's the healthy
food in the garden?

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:29.756
- Over there!

00:06:29.756 --> 00:06:30.590
- Over there?

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:31.424
Over here?
