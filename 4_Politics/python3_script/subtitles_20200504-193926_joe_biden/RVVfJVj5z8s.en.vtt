00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.259
&gt;&gt; I’m Jeff Bezos.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.669
&gt;&gt; What is your claim to fame?

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:07.669
&gt;&gt; I’m the founder of

00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:08.669
Amazon.com.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:09.669
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: From the

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:11.379
award-winning producers of “The
Facebook Dilemma”.

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:13.879
&gt;&gt; Richest guy in the world.

&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: FRONTLINE

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.369
investigates Amazon.

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.820
&gt;&gt; Is Amazon taking over the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.200
world a good thing?

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.200
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Questioning those

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.200
who run the company...

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.200
&gt;&gt; What would you say to someone

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.860
who feels as though humans are
increasingly being treated like

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.860
robots?

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.860
&gt;&gt; That’s not the experience

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.070
that I had in setting it up.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:31.640
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And those no longer

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.640
there.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.640
&gt;&gt; Most people would assume

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.780
there’s a pretty high safety
standard on Amazon.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:36.780
&gt;&gt; And that assumption would be
incorrect.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.809
&gt;&gt; The tools are not what I call
battle tested.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.920
&gt;&gt; Some people asking if Amazon
is a monopoly.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.609
&gt;&gt; The question for the
democracy is, are we okay with

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:49.019
one company essentially winning
capitalism?

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.420
&gt;&gt; How do you and
Jeff think about the call to

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.770
break you guys up?

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:54.770
&gt;&gt; Simply because the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.670
company’s been
successful doesn’t mean it’s

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.849
somehow too big.

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:59.030

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.030
FRONTLINE...

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.030
&gt;&gt; Domination was very much the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.030
idea.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.319
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: “Amazon Empire”.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:09.260
&gt;&gt; Jeff Bezos has already
conquered the retail frontier.

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.080
Now he's got a plan to colonize
the planets.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.360
&gt;&gt; Bezos is laying out his plans
for colonizing space.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.870
&gt;&gt; Bezos is known for going big,
and now he's literally shooting

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:18.110
for the moon.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.570
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In May of 2019,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.550
Jeff Bezos, the richest person
on the planet, unveiled his

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.640
latest invention.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.030
&gt;&gt; This is Blue Moon.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.740
It's time to go back to the
moon, this time to stay.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.270
&gt;&gt; Jeff has said over and over
again that the most important

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.230
work he's doing is work in
space.

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.670
What he's built in Amazon is
really important and really

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.640
interesting, and it's, it's
revolutionized commerce.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.070
But it's only revolutionized
commerce.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.780
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos's plan is to
chart a new course for the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.420
future of humanity.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.140
&gt;&gt; Manufactured worlds rotated

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.710
to create artificial gravity
with centrifugal force.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.031
These are very large structures,
miles on end.

00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:04.940
And they hold a million people
or more each.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.259
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It's an idea he's
had since he was a teenager.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.420
&gt;&gt; This is me in high school.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.420
And I want to highlight this

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.590
quote: "The earth is finite, and
if the world economy and

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.599
population is to keep expanding,
space is the only way to go."

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.299
I still believe that.

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.830
&gt;&gt; The way Jeff Bezos sees is it

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.129
is that consumerism is an
example of how today's society

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.280
lives better than our parents
did and our grandparents.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.099
And he wants, you know, future
generations to continue to have

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.029
an increasingly better
lifestyle.

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.749
&gt;&gt; These are beautiful.

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:43.010
People are going to want to live

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.010
here.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.329
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos unveiled his

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.720
extra-terrestrial plans at a
time of growing concern about

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.459
the empire he's built here on
earth.

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.880
&gt;&gt; Amazon is the great
disrupter, from books to retail

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.880
to grocery stores.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.159
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For more than 25

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.920
years, Jeff Bezos has been
disrupting and transforming

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.099
almost every aspect of our
modern lives.

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.379
&gt;&gt; Once you start connecting the
dots, you see that Amazon is

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:10.930
building all of the invisible
infrastructure for our futures.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.030
&gt;&gt; Amazon announced a healthcare
partnership...

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.129
&gt;&gt; Amazon is helping the C.I.A.
build a secure cloud...

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.959
&gt;&gt; How much of the internet do
you run?

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.479
&gt;&gt; That's a good question, um,
it's a lot, though.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But in recent
years, Amazon-- and Bezos-- have

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.150
come under scrutiny for their
aggressive tactics and expanding

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.519
power.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.249
(Bezos laughing)

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:37.040
&gt;&gt; Everything that is admirable
about Amazon is also something

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.629
that we should fear about it.

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.930
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For the past year,

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.871
we've been investigating how
Jeff Bezos built his empire--

00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:48.459
and at what cost.

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.079
&gt;&gt; And so think about this.

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.029
Big things start small.

has its roots not in Silicon

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.430
Valley, but on Wall Street.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.430
That's where the young Princeton

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.010
graduate went to work in the
early 1990s, at a secretive

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.380
hedge fund called D.E.

Shaw.

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.880

revolutionized Wall Street by

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.070
introducing data.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.470
And I think Jeff really embraced

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.921
that, that idea that, "Hey, if
you have data, ultimately, you

00:04:34.921 --> 00:04:38.650
win."

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.650
&gt;&gt; One of the things that David

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.980
Shaw asked Jeff Bezos to do was
to go and investigate new

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.880
businesses, and in particular
this new thing in the early

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.750

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:53.560
&gt;&gt; What is the internet?

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.720
&gt;&gt; It's sort of the mother of
all networks.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.500
&gt;&gt; It's information highways.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.060
&gt;&gt; It's kind of like your remote

control to the world.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.560

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.510
see the untapped potential of
the new digital landscape and

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.759
was determined to get in on it.

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.780
&gt;&gt; I came across this startling

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.080
statistic that web usage was
growing at 2,300% a year.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.030
So, I decided I would try and
find a business plan that made

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.250
sense in the context of that
growth, and I picked books as

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.150

online.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:27.389
vast selection, convenience-- we
deliver right to the desktop.

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:30.440
If our catalog were printed on
paper, it would be the size of

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.000
seven New York City phonebooks.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
♪ ♪

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.320
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The company quickly
outgrew the garage and soon had

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.360
more than 50 employees.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.580
In 1996, James Marcus applied to

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:48.240
be number 55.

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.240
&gt;&gt; There was a very palpable

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:53.520
excitement in the air at this
place, and of course at this

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.430
point Jeff Bezos was the first
person to interview every

00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.990
prospective employee.

00:08:57.990 --> 00:08:59.640
So I was ushered into his

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.640
office.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.570
He wanted to see how fast you

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.760
were on your feet.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:04.810
He also always wanted to know

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:06.339
your S.A.T. scores.

00:09:06.339 --> 00:09:07.430
&gt;&gt; He wanted to know

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:08.430
your S.A.T. scores?

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:09.430
&gt;&gt; Every time, yes.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.769
&gt;&gt; How old were you at
the time?

00:09:10.769 --> 00:09:13.440
&gt;&gt; I was 36 or 37.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.390
&gt;&gt; This is the original sign

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.960
that I made for Amazon.com.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.480
Blue spray paint on white poster

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.480
board.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.640
&gt;&gt; Jeff wasn't a figure out of

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:25.520
folklore at that point, he was
not the-the wealthiest man in

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.520
the world.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.860
&gt;&gt; Here's my computer,

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.040
Amazon.com up on the screen.

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.779
"Hello, Jeff Bezos."

00:09:32.779 --> 00:09:35.870
&gt;&gt; He was a small, nondescript,
sandy-haired man sitting at a

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:40.880
desk with quite a large and
eruptive laugh.

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:47.020
(laughing in multiple scenes)
&gt;&gt; But he wasn't threatening, he

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.329
was a normal guy to a sort of
amazing extent.

00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:54.150
&gt;&gt; HAL 9000 hat, very important.

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.090
Hal and I share a birthday,

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:57.400
we're both born on January 12.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.220
&gt;&gt; It belied, you know, an

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.140
enormous, Napoleonic ambition.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.640
&gt;&gt; One of the people I really

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.140
like, Thomas Edison, here's a
model of his original light

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:08.140
bulb.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.120
He's famous for saying, "One

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.110
percent inspiration, 99 percent
perspiration."

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:16.870
(laughs)
It turns out ideas are the easy

00:10:16.870 --> 00:10:18.920
part, execution is everything.

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.920
&gt;&gt; Domination was on Jeff's mind

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.920
from the beginning.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:21.920
One of his sort of

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.550
second-in-command people said
to me, "You have to understand

00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:28.040
that Jeff wants to sell many
more things than books.

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.200
And Jeff's idea is that in the
near-distant future, you could

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.180
buy a kayak from Amazon.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.300
And if, and after you brought

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.610
the kayak, you could figure out
good places to kayak and buy

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:39.880
travel services from Amazon."

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:41.800
So, those ambitions were very

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.830
clear, and this was very early
on.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.000
But he was clearly thinking in
those terms from the get-go.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.650
&gt;&gt; How did that ring to
you at the time?

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.209
&gt;&gt; A little bit exciting and a
little bit nutty.

00:10:53.209 --> 00:10:54.850
&gt;&gt; Amazon.com, very good
website.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:57.110
You should really try it.

00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.569
(Bezos laughs)

00:10:59.569 --> 00:11:02.839
&gt;&gt; If you signed on to work at
a-a kind of futuristic

00:11:02.839 --> 00:11:06.140
bookstore, and the guy who
owned it was suddenly talking

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.050
about selling, you know, every
object in the universe, you just

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.500
weren't sure how seriously to
take it.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:17.740
(Bezos laughing)
(Bezos screaming playfully)

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:23.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Though his public
image was often unserious...

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.450
&gt;&gt; That was awesome!

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.440
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Inside the company,

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:30.089
Bezos was a hard-charging
manager relentlessly focused on

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:32.820
the principle that would make
Amazon one of the most trusted

00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:38.040
brands in the world: the
customer always comes first.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.029
&gt;&gt; This culture of customer
obsession...

00:11:40.029 --> 00:11:41.950
Obsessive focus on customer...

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:43.620
Obsesses over our customers...

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:47.829
Totally obsessing over the
customer experience.

00:11:47.829 --> 00:11:49.700
&gt;&gt; We used to call it customer
ecstasy.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.500
It means building, delivering,
focusing on your customer.

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:57.839
And we did it, you know, in the
very, very early days at every

00:11:57.839 --> 00:11:58.839
stage.

00:11:58.839 --> 00:12:00.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jennifer Cast was

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:05.089
there in the early days and is
one of six top Amazon executives

00:12:05.089 --> 00:12:08.510
the company put forward to
speak to us.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:12.100
&gt;&gt; Customer obsession was our
North Star.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:15.160
And so, you know, it was a place
where we knew we were a part of

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:19.089
something that was new, the
internet.

00:12:19.089 --> 00:12:21.529
There was an excitement that we
were doing something that hadn't

00:12:21.529 --> 00:12:22.529
been done before.

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:24.580
It was exhilarating.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.420
We were all aligned around
building for customers.

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.250
&gt;&gt; Hey, you guys.

00:12:30.250 --> 00:12:31.250
&gt;&gt; Hey.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.050
(Bezos laughs)
&gt;&gt; I've heard there was

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:36.410
an empty chair that would often
be put at meetings.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:37.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:38.410
&gt;&gt; Who was in the empty

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:39.410
chair?

00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so that empty chair was

00:12:40.410 --> 00:12:43.500
there to remind us all to
understand the customer, have

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.350
empathy for the customer,
understand the details of the

00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:47.380
customer experience.

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.589
The customer isn't there, we

00:12:49.589 --> 00:12:51.860
have to bring forward the voice
of the customer.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.900
(phone ringing)
&gt;&gt; Thank you for calling

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:55.900
Amazon.com.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And Bezos quickly

00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.830
learned that in this new online
world, he could understand

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.550
exactly how customers were
behaving.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.980
&gt;&gt; All orders do need to be
placed online.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.550
&gt;&gt; It was made clear from the
beginning that data collection

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:12.290
was also one of Amazon's
businesses.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.399
All customer behavior that
flowed through the site was

00:13:14.399 --> 00:13:16.300
recorded and tracked.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:17.620
And that itself was a valuable

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:18.620
commodity.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.290
&gt;&gt; Have you visited our website?

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:24.730
&gt;&gt; We could track how a customer
navigated through the site.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:27.370
So we could see what you looked
at, we could also see what you

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.610
paused at, we could see what you
put in your basket but didn't

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.430
order, we could see what you put
in your basket and did order.

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.610
So that's when we started
realizing, "Man, this is rich.

00:13:35.610 --> 00:13:37.130
This is rich, rich, rich."

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:38.390
And so we've used it for

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:39.390
everything.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.390
&gt;&gt; What do you do with that

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.390
information?

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:42.790
&gt;&gt; That's the data that allows

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:46.790
us to predict, or try to
predict, what books that you

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:49.230
would like that you haven't
discovered yet.

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:53.090
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos treated the
site as a laboratory, where he

00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:57.300
studied customer behavior along
with his chief scientist Andreas

00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.080
Weigend.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.149
&gt;&gt; I was shocked to see how

00:14:01.149 --> 00:14:02.940
predictable people are.

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:06.340
If you take the time of the day

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:10.750
into account, if you take maybe
when they were last on the site,

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:13.490
how long they were on the site
last time, how long they're on

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:17.850
the site today, you know what
they're falling for.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:24.000
&gt;&gt; Whoever owns, collects, the
data, if you have access to it

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.190
and rights to data, then you are
king.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:30.760
It's all about the data.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.150
Everything.

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.830
&gt;&gt; One of the most fascinating
kind of tools we have at our

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:39.560
disposal is the ability to do
active experiments.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.899
It's, you know, it's kind of
this huge laboratory.

00:14:43.899 --> 00:14:47.000
&gt;&gt; We did not think about it as
exploiting, we thought about

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.329
helping people make better
decisions.

00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:53.149
&gt;&gt; I was starting to feel that
that was less respectful toward

00:14:53.149 --> 00:14:56.480
the consumer, who was, after
all, supposed to be our god, the

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.720
person whose ecstasy was our
very reason for being.

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.350
And it was closer to getting a
cow into a milking stall and

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:07.610
extracting as many pails as
possible during each visit.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.490
And that felt a little more
unsavory.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:13.040
But that was the business of
Amazon.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:15.640
&gt;&gt; Amazon has added 880,000 new
customers...

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.860
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: While Bezos was
using these insights to bring

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.420
more and more customers into
Amazon...

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:23.370
&gt;&gt; The number of customers who
use the website has increased

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:24.370
fourfold...

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.370
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There was one thing

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.970
he hadn't done yet.

00:15:27.970 --> 00:15:28.990
&gt;&gt; The company's never made a

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.990
profit.

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.990
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:33.760
&gt;&gt; Now, why... how does that...
why... how does that...?

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.400
&gt;&gt; It seems like a new math,
doesn't it?

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.400
&gt;&gt; It does.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.400
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos would spend

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:42.679
years losing money trying to
beat his competition, and he

00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:47.089
convinced investors to go along
with it.

00:15:47.089 --> 00:15:51.000
&gt;&gt; One of Jeff Bezos' greatest
accomplishments has been his

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.810
ability to get Wall Street to
accept the fact the first

00:15:54.810 --> 00:15:57.560
20-some years, Amazon wasn't
going to be very profitable.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.760
And that's okay because they're
building infrastructure that

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:03.811
will create huge opportunities
for them to gain scale and gain

00:16:03.811 --> 00:16:05.490
customers and gain business.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.170
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He spelled it out

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:10.709
in a letter to shareholders
after the company first went

00:16:10.709 --> 00:16:16.140
public: "It's all about the
long term," he wrote, rather

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.770
than short-term profits or Wall
Street reactions.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:25.180
&gt;&gt; He essentially says,
"We are going to forego profits

00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.760
in order to take market share.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.860
That our strategy is to lose

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:32.670
money, which enables us then to
put other companies out of

00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:34.740
business who can't afford to
lose money."

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.420
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That strategy
wouldn't sit well with critics

00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:41.540
like Stacy Mitchell, who
advocates for small businesses.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.910
&gt;&gt; In essence, at the very
beginning, he's signaling to

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.970
shareholders, "I have a strategy
to monopolize the market, and

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:51.250
that's going to reward you, but
it's going to be far down the

00:16:51.250 --> 00:16:52.740
road, and will you come along
with me?"

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.400
And they said yes.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:56.730
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Investors also

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:02.750
recognized Bezos' essential
advantage over physical stores,

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:05.579
which had to charge their
customers sales tax, unlike

00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.160
online businesses.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.420
&gt;&gt; So, not collecting sales tax

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.309
gave Amazon a big leg up over
bricks and mortar retailers.

00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:16.430
And that was central to their
early strategy of gaining

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.680
market share as quickly as they
can.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.120
&gt;&gt; What booksellers were saying
to me is that, "This is driving

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.309
my customers to Amazon.

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:23.709
They'll come into the store,

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:25.850
they'll browse, they find what
they want, but then they'll go

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:30.149
buy it on Amazon, because they
can save that sales tax."

00:17:30.149 --> 00:17:33.610
&gt;&gt; So it was a very irksome,
early, big issue for the book

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:35.620
vendors, first of all, they were
kind of the canaries in the

00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.259
mine, so to speak, and then lots
of other retailers.

00:17:39.259 --> 00:17:42.220
♪ ♪
&gt;&gt; Amazon has added thousands of

00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:45.120
warehouse workers and three
million square feet of space.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.260
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon's sales-tax
advantage would be central to

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:52.390
its success as it expanded
beyond books, into other

00:17:52.390 --> 00:17:53.390

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.120
a typical, physical world
software store.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:10.020
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But Bezos was still
a long way from his goal of

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.890
Amazon being the place where you
could buy everything online.

00:18:13.890 --> 00:18:21.710
(drills whirring)
And he saw a way to achieve it.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:24.200
&gt;&gt; Amazon could soon become the
Walmart of the internet.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.500
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There were
thousands of businesses eager to

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:27.500
sell online.

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.630
Bezos offered them a way to do

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:30.630
it.

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:31.809
&gt;&gt; Amazon is transforming itself

00:18:31.809 --> 00:18:34.509
from an online bookstore to an
online mall.

00:18:34.509 --> 00:18:37.880
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He transformed
Amazon into a retail platform

00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.640
where anyone could sell their
goods to his customers and

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.610
invited thousands of other
businesses to be a part of it.

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.990
&gt;&gt; It's the easiest place for
anybody, small or large, who

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.299

access our 12 million-plus

Anybody, all comers.

00:18:59.309 --> 00:19:00.380
&gt;&gt; We're talking about hundreds

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.070
of thousands of companies with
literally tens of millions of

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:04.960
products.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.350
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Name-brand stores

00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:11.170
started selling on Bezos's
platform, and so did tens of

00:19:11.170 --> 00:19:15.370
thousands of small
entrepreneurs.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:17.620
&gt;&gt; Everyone knew Amazon.com.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.620
The only people that knew

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:21.380
SuperDuperHoops.com were the
ones that were searching to buy

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.890
a basketball hoop and saw our
name on an advertisement.

00:19:24.890 --> 00:19:26.900
To us it was really a
no-brainer.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:30.210
We knew that we would, you know,
increase our sales.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.960
First year we did 100,000, next
year we did a million, we did

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:35.460
two million, four million, we
were doubling every year in the

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.460
early days.

00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:37.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was great for

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:41.580
the companies-- and even greater
for Jeff Bezos.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.440
&gt;&gt; Amazon has become the most
recognizable name in e-commerce.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.960
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Not only would he
take a cut of everything other

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:51.590
businesses sold, he'd also keep
his own store on the platform,

00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:55.500
competing against everyone else
in the marketplace he owned and

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:57.020
controlled.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:19:59.090
&gt;&gt; He owns the Main Street.

00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:02.090
He has the Main Street real
estate.

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:06.720
Not just one building on the
corner, the entire Main Street.

♪ ♪
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: How Amazon would

00:20:11.201 --> 00:20:14.890
wield its power over the online
marketplace would eventually

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:19.580
become a question for government
regulators, but early on, there

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:20.910
were indications.

00:20:20.910 --> 00:20:23.020
The first to see them were book

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.520
publishers.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:28.490
&gt;&gt; Amazon took over a large

00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:31.510
market share of the publishing
industry very, very fast.

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:35.670
They were very quickly in a
position to demand concessions.

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:37.750
You know, I think that was a
moment where publishers started

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:40.970
to realize, "Oh, wait a minute,
like, we... they're our partner,

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.380
but they now have the
beginnings of a boot on our

windpipe."

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:48.580
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Inside the company,

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.160
they had launched a strategy
that some called "the Gazelle

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.880
Project," because they'd heard
Bezos wanted them to pursue

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.029
publishers the way a cheetah
pursues a sickly gazelle.

00:20:59.029 --> 00:21:00.850
&gt;&gt; Well, you don't go after the
strongest.

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:01.850
It's like the cheetah.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:03.021
The cheetah looks for the weak,

00:21:03.021 --> 00:21:06.900
looks for the sick, looks for
the small, that's what you go

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:07.900
for.

00:21:07.900 --> 00:21:09.080
So don't start with, you know,

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.360
number one publisher.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.520
Start with number seven

00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:14.400
publisher and then number six
publisher, and by the time you

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.750
get to number three, two, and
one, the noise has gone, gotten

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:19.750
back to them.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:20.750
They're going to know this is

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:23.890
coming, and chances are you may
be able to settle that without a

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:27.930
full-on war.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:28.930
&gt;&gt; We were just this little

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:34.429
mom and pop publishing company,
publishing poetry books and

00:21:34.429 --> 00:21:36.330
translated fiction.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.559

00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:41.780
the number of books Dennis
Johnson was selling on Amazon

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.500
had been rising steadily.

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.620
Then one day, he got a phone

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.650
call.

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:48.890
&gt;&gt; Our distributor called us up

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.710
to talk about our Amazon
contract.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:55.850
And he said, "I went out to
dinner last night with Amazon,

00:21:55.850 --> 00:21:59.640
it was like going out to dinner
with the Godfather.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.150
They want a kickback."

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.929
That's the word he used,

00:22:03.929 --> 00:22:04.929
kickback.

00:22:04.929 --> 00:22:06.580
And he said they wanted four

00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:10.210
percent more of our sales.

00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.210
&gt;&gt; Was that unusual?

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:16.470

it was totally unprecedented,

yes.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.210
the European book team and says
he saw nothing wrong with

00:22:23.210 --> 00:22:26.810
Amazon's tough tactics to
challenge publishers on prices

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:28.260
and profit margins.

00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:29.600
&gt;&gt; In order to bring them into

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.450
line, we would actually take
them out of automated

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.890
merchandising, take their prices
up to list price; we would put

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.140
references on the product page,
their product page, saying, "You

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:42.010
want it cheaper, you want this
book for, on this topic for a

00:22:42.010 --> 00:22:43.010
way cheaper price?

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:44.010
Click here."

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:46.049
And we'd send them to whoever we
thought their worst competitor

00:22:46.049 --> 00:22:47.049
was.

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:49.010
That was how Amazon forced their

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:51.049
vendors to-to comply.

00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:52.559
(stammering): But that's an

00:22:52.559 --> 00:22:55.790
old Walmart trick, I mean, it
wasn't like Amazon created that.

00:22:55.790 --> 00:22:57.490
And it made, it made a
difference.

00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:01.320
And, you know, Jeff kind of got
excited about it.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.809
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: When Dennis Johnson
still refused to give in to

00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:08.290
Amazon's terms, he says the buy
button on all Melville House

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:11.760
books suddenly disappeared,
making it impossible for

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.030
customers to purchase them on
Amazon.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.610
&gt;&gt; I mean, this is the company
that referred to little

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:22.420
publishers like me as wounded
gazelles, I believe?

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.220
That's how they think, that's
how he thought from the

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.630
beginning.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:28.120
And we eventually had to pay

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:30.990
what at the time I called a
bribe.

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:36.960
And our attitude toward Amazon
was, you know, "Render unto

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:38.320
Caesar that which is Caesar's."

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:42.210
And then carry on as best as you

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:43.210
can.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.210
&gt;&gt; Jeff Bezos may say

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:48.830
that Amazon comes along and has
given publishers like yourself

00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:53.880
access to a huge distribution
channel for your books.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.059
Has Amazon been good for your
business?

00:23:56.059 --> 00:23:58.620
&gt;&gt; Well, absolutely they have.

00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.049
Any bookseller that sells our

00:24:00.049 --> 00:24:01.950
books is good for our business.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:03.720
So, I'm not complaining that

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:05.350
Amazon is selling our books.

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:07.260
I'm just complaining of the way

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.149
that their tactics are hurting
the industry I love.

00:24:11.149 --> 00:24:14.480
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In addition to
granting interviews, Amazon

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.070
responded to written questions.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:18.410
Regarding Dennis Johnson's

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.150
characterizations, it told us,
"Amazon disagrees with this

00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:23.150
account."

00:24:23.150 --> 00:24:24.260
&gt;&gt; Were you

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.409
uncomfortable with that sort of
ruthlessness ever?

00:24:27.409 --> 00:24:29.510
&gt;&gt; Well, no, 'cause I was in
retail-- I mean, people think

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:30.510
that's ruthless.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.510
You know, I looked, and some

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.450
people at Amazon, "Wow, that's
kind of mean," and I'm like,

00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:36.990
"Oh, a retailer and a supplier
having a disagreement?

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:38.360
Stop the presses!"

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.410
It happens all the time.

00:24:39.410 --> 00:24:42.330
I mean, you know, look, you've
got a finite margin, and

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.910
somebody's going to have to
give.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.120
And-and a lot of times Amazon
wasn't the one giving.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.730
&gt;&gt; Kindle is a purpose-built
reading device.

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:53.630
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: The tension between
Amazon and book publishers would

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:57.050
ramp up even further with the
unveiling of the Kindle, which

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:00.809
helped the industry transition
to the digital age, but gave

00:25:00.809 --> 00:25:03.900
Amazon more power to set prices
lower.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:09.470
&gt;&gt; And new releases are only
$9.99.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:13.260
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Around that time,
Barry Lynn, an advocate for

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:17.620
broad antitrust enforcement, was
growing increasingly concerned

00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.260
by what he was hearing from
publishers.

00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:23.490
&gt;&gt; If the door was open, the
publisher would say, "Hey, you

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.309
know, Amazon, they're just a
terrific customer, they're our

00:25:26.309 --> 00:25:27.450
biggest customer.

00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:29.560
They buy the most books, they

00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.600
sell the most books.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.679
We love them."

00:25:31.679 --> 00:25:35.530
Then you close the door, and
they say, "Amazon is destroying

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.960
our business model, they're
destroying our business, they

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.950
have way too much power, we
must do something about them."

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.309
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Lynn wanted
publishers to speak up

00:25:45.309 --> 00:25:48.720
publicly and thought federal
antitrust regulators might

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:53.130
investigate whether Amazon was a
monopoly, illegally abusing its

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:56.179
market dominance in
anticompetitive ways.

00:25:56.179 --> 00:26:00.549
&gt;&gt; And they'd say, "No way, I'm
not going to talk about Amazon

00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:01.549
in public.

00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:02.549
I'm not talking about them on

00:26:02.549 --> 00:26:03.970
Capitol Hill.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:05.470
They will take retribution

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:06.470
against me."

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:07.470
&gt;&gt; To which you

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:08.470
responded?

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:09.740
&gt;&gt; "Well, that's why we have to

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.830
do something about it."

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.780
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Jennifer Cast ran

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.610
Amazon's books division in its
formative years.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:18.700
&gt;&gt; We've had a difficult
time in some ways getting

00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:22.020
publishers to talk to us on
camera about Amazon.

00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.790
In part, it seems the reason is
that they're afraid.

00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:30.490
How do you react to that, that
publishers find it

00:26:30.490 --> 00:26:33.210
uncomfortable to talk about
Amazon publicly?

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:37.460
&gt;&gt; I don't know, I mean, I-I
haven't seen that.

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:38.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:40.200
&gt;&gt; I haven't been in your shoes.

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:41.299
I'm sure they have...

00:26:41.299 --> 00:26:43.610
I mean,
if you're saying that they-they

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:47.020
don't talk negatively about us,
I mean, I know they have a lot

00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:48.740
of good things to say about us.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.690
Um, you know, I-I don't know why

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:52.640
they wouldn't speak their minds.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.100
We certainly value speaking our

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:56.100
minds.

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:57.100
&gt;&gt; There is this

00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.340
well-known anecdote about
cheetahs and gazelles, this

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.380
Gazelle Program.

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:01.549
Do you know about that?

00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:03.010
&gt;&gt; I don't.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:04.010
&gt;&gt; We've talked to

00:27:04.010 --> 00:27:06.970
former Amazonians about it,
where Jeff had said, "We should

00:27:06.970 --> 00:27:11.660
basically try to negotiate with
book publishers and try to get

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.130
better terms and treat the
smaller publishers as a cheetah

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.000
would go after a wounded
gazelle."

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.169
&gt;&gt; I didn't hear the cheetah
and gazelle example, but what we

00:27:21.169 --> 00:27:24.980
were looking for was people that
were willing to move away from

00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:28.610
the old model of bricks and
mortar to a new model, which

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:35.120
was, you know, a-a virtual store
that had many different types of

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.460
opportunities to present their
books to customers.

00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:41.980
&gt;&gt; I want to talk a little bit
about how we think about

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.679
innovation at Amazon.com.

00:27:43.679 --> 00:27:45.110
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon would begin

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:50.170
to accumulate even more power in
2005, when Bezos quietly rolled

00:27:50.170 --> 00:27:53.730
out a revolutionary new program:
Amazon Prime.

00:27:53.730 --> 00:27:55.309
&gt;&gt; Now they have something
called the Prime shipping

00:27:55.309 --> 00:27:57.240
program.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.380
&gt;&gt; Amazon Prime-- we only

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:03.440
launched this a week ago--
you pay $79 a year, and you get

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.009
two-day shipping for free.

00:28:05.009 --> 00:28:07.180
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: It was a risky bet,

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.370
and it paid off.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:09.710
&gt;&gt; The lynchpin, or the glue, if

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:13.290
you will, and probably the
seminal moment in Amazon's

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:17.690
business history, was the
introduction of what has become

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:21.809
the most successful membership
program in history, and that's

00:28:21.809 --> 00:28:22.809
Prime.

00:28:22.809 --> 00:28:23.809
&gt;&gt; Many of you in this audience

00:28:23.809 --> 00:28:27.049
will already be Amazon Prime
members, bless you.

00:28:27.049 --> 00:28:28.400
This is very much appreciated.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.790
&gt;&gt; It changes the way you shop.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:33.799
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Eventually more
than 150 million people would

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:38.110
sign up for the free shipping--
a tremendous expense for Amazon.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:41.610
But to Bezos, it was worth it.

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:43.200
&gt;&gt; The Prime program at Amazon

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:47.440
is one of the most important
drivers of Amazon's growth.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.309
When you go on and look to buy a
product, and it's available in

00:28:50.309 --> 00:28:54.350
two days, delivered to your door
anywhere in the country, that

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.090
Amazon Prime program becomes a
mechanism that keeps bringing

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.910
you back as a customer to keep
buying and keep searching for

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.299
new products on Amazon.

00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:05.510
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Two-day delivery

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:08.750
anywhere in the country was a
big promise for a company that,

00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:12.030
at the time, had less than ten
warehouses.

00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:18.210
So Bezos went on a building
spree.

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:19.679
♪ ♪
Across the country Amazon

00:29:19.679 --> 00:29:24.220
warehouses began to spring up,
filled with millions of

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.360
products being sold on Bezos's
platform.

00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.850
He'd call them fulfillment
centers, and they'd create

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:35.309
hundreds of thousands of jobs
in places hard hit by the Great

00:29:35.309 --> 00:29:36.960
Recession.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.370
&gt;&gt; Ten percent of Pennsylvania

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:41.370
residents unemployed...

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:42.370
&gt;&gt; Job market is in complete

00:29:42.370 --> 00:29:43.370
disarray.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:44.370
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Like Allentown,

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:45.370
Pennsylvania.

00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:46.370
&gt;&gt; At that time, it was

00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:48.600
tremendous news that an employer
was coming and actually opening

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:53.900
a facility and hiring people,
versus, you know, gutting half

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.900
the staff.

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.900
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Spencer Soper was a

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.850
business reporter for the
"Allentown Morning Call" when

00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.500
Amazon opened in the area in
2010.

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:07.210
He began hearing stories about
working in the warehouse.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:10.870
&gt;&gt; People are basically in this
big, sprawling warehouse that's

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.880
stocked with goods in very
random fashion.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:17.600
And they have scanners that
tell them which things to get.

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.820
And people are walking maybe
ten, 15 miles a day.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.190
So people just kind of
crisscrossing this big warehouse

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.570
all day long.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.120
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As workers told him

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.919
about the punishing pace to meet
the daily quota of packages, and

00:30:27.919 --> 00:30:32.640
the intense heat, Soper and his
colleagues started to

00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:34.609
investigate further.

00:30:34.609 --> 00:30:35.609
&gt;&gt; People really felt like

00:30:35.609 --> 00:30:38.410
Amazon was playing fast and
loose with their, with their

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:39.410
health.

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:40.679
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Soper discovered

00:30:40.679 --> 00:30:43.070
there had been numerous
complaints to authorities at the

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.510
Occupational Safety and Health
Administration, OSHA.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:50.230
&gt;&gt; They actually had a complaint
from an emergency-room doctor

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:55.159
who called their hotline one day
saying, "Listen, you might want

00:30:55.159 --> 00:30:56.720
to check out this Amazon place.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.970
I've had, like, people parading

00:30:57.970 --> 00:31:01.480
through my emergency room to be
treated for heat stress."

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.570
There was a security guard who
worked in the facility who sent

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:08.179
a complaint to OSHA saying that
he saw pregnant women suffering

00:31:08.179 --> 00:31:11.179
heat stress in-in the facility.

00:31:11.179 --> 00:31:12.179
And so there's just, like, these

00:31:12.179 --> 00:31:14.850
red flags right and left.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.610
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: After an

00:31:16.610 --> 00:31:19.600
investigation, OSHA said Amazon
needed to keep the temperatures

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.220
in the warehouses lower.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:23.330
In a statement at the time, the

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.660
company said it installed new
industrial air conditioning and

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.070
pledged that worker safety was
its number-one priority.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:32.340
&gt;&gt; Amazon is shrewd
businesspeople, shrewd

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.660
businesspeople know when they
have leverage.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.170
And when you're the only shop
hiring people in town, you can

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:42.429
push them a lot harder than
you can when-when they've got

00:31:42.429 --> 00:31:43.429
alternatives.

00:31:43.429 --> 00:31:45.020
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Over the following

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:47.490
years, Amazon would hire
hundreds of thousands of

00:31:47.490 --> 00:31:49.710
workers and become one of
the largest jobs

00:31:49.710 --> 00:31:52.440
creators in the country.

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.240
At the fulfillment centers,

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.779
Bezos experimented with new
techniques and technologies to

00:31:57.779 --> 00:31:59.820
boost productivity.

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:01.110
&gt;&gt; Willingness to experiment is

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.230
the key to be able to do new
things.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:07.020
So we do, you know, hundreds of
experiments every day in our

00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:09.420
fulfillment centers to get a
little bit better.

00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.669
Kind of like incremental
invention.

♪ ♪
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: When a company

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:19.080
called Kiva perfected a
warehouse robot, Amazon bought

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.080
the whole company.

00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:21.760

They make shipping robots.

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:27.740

under Jeff Bezos.

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:47.799

They make the job safer, they
make them higher quality,

because we present a smaller set
of options to-to employees.

&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Sheheryar Kaoosji
is an advocate for warehouse

00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:31.230
workers in the San Bernardino,
California, area-- an Amazon

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:35.630
hub, with ten fulfillment
centers and over 15,000

00:33:35.630 --> 00:33:37.090
employees.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.110
&gt;&gt; Because of the way that

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.360
Amazon operates, because of the
way that they set their rates

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.150
for productivity, it's a lot
harder work physically but also

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:47.150
psychologically.

00:33:47.150 --> 00:33:48.940
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: We sat down with a

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:53.450
group in San Bernardino who'd
recently worked at Amazon.

00:33:53.450 --> 00:33:55.160
&gt;&gt; When they first got here, I
thought it was exciting.

00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:58.890
Like, for me, I was thinking
maybe I could find a-a place

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:01.520
where, you know, I'm going to
set roots of a good job, you

00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:03.110
know, move up in-in the place.

00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:04.659
But after being there for a

00:34:04.659 --> 00:34:07.019
while, I was like, "There's no
way."

00:34:07.019 --> 00:34:09.179
&gt;&gt; It's like, "Okay, this is
where I can probably make a

00:34:09.179 --> 00:34:10.179
career."

00:34:10.179 --> 00:34:12.010
But once you worked there for a

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:14.980
certain amount of time, it's
just like, it's just not

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.290
realistic, how they expect you
to work.

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:20.040
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Like dozens of
workers we've spoken to around

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.320
the country, they say they've
struggled to keep up with the

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:27.619
rate Amazon expected them to
pick and pack items.

00:34:27.619 --> 00:34:30.440
&gt;&gt; How realistic are the
rates that they're giving you?

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:32.440
I mean, what's...

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.440
&gt;&gt; Not realistic at all.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.440
&gt;&gt; Not-not realistic?

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.440
&gt;&gt; No.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.609
There's absolutely no way to
make rate, you know, you got to

00:34:36.609 --> 00:34:39.800
find little ways to-to cheat
it, because once you hit rate,

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:42.570
by the end of the week, they
raised it, they bump it up

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:43.720
again.

00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.000
Because they start seeing, "Hey,

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.320
people can hit those rates,
can hit those numbers, hey,

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:50.430
let's push them a little
harder."

00:34:50.430 --> 00:34:58.890
Every week it seemed like it was
going up.

00:34:58.890 --> 00:35:00.440
♪ ♪
&gt;&gt; You have security cameras

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:03.170
right behind you at all times,
that are looking at you

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:04.170
24-seven.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:07.020
And if you don't meet standards

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:11.970
or the rates, you're out the
door, you're just disposable.

00:35:11.970 --> 00:35:15.100
&gt;&gt; Every worker has a scanner at
all times that basically track

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.370
exactly where you're at.

00:35:17.370 --> 00:35:19.161
&gt;&gt; And they have a little blue

00:35:19.161 --> 00:35:23.801
line at the bottom of the
screen, and it has, like, how

00:35:23.801 --> 00:35:29.300
many seconds that you have to
have it done by the time it hits

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:31.810
zero, and it puts you into panic
mode.

00:35:31.810 --> 00:35:35.170
&gt;&gt; And pretty much you can't
talk to people, you can't be in

00:35:35.170 --> 00:35:37.802
the same aisle as them, you
just constantly have to sit

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:40.530
there scanning like a robot all
day long.

00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:43.040
If they catch you not scanning,
you get a write-up.

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.800
&gt;&gt; And what they're doing is
they're producing this mass of

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.810
data that they are using to be
able to analyze the entire

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:53.190
workforce.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:54.480
&gt;&gt; We're not treated as human

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:57.020
beings, we're not even treated
as robots.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:36:00.400
We're treated as part of the
data stream.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.570
&gt;&gt; It's the incentive at
any warehouse, on any assembly

00:36:03.570 --> 00:36:05.630
line, to get the most out of any
worker.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.630
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:07.710
&gt;&gt; To make rates, to-to

00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.349
be as efficient as possible, to
be as productive as possible.

00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:13.920
So, I don't see exactly what's
different about Amazon as

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:16.710
opposed to any other warehouse.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:20.020
&gt;&gt; Amazon is the cutting edge.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:22.839
Other warehouses are starting to
adopt these technologies, other

00:36:22.839 --> 00:36:25.599
companies are definitely
interested in doing what Amazon

00:36:25.599 --> 00:36:26.850
is doing.

00:36:26.850 --> 00:36:27.900
Data collection could become

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.200
basically the standard for all
workers, and that there's...

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:36.870
you're never good enough,
you're never able to keep up.

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:39.410
♪ ♪
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon told us work

00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:42.330
rates are not based on
individual employee's

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.560
performance, and that the
scanning devices workers use are

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.619
not for tracking people but
inventory-- a common practice in

00:36:49.619 --> 00:36:52.660
the warehouse industry.

00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:53.660
&gt;&gt; We've talked to

00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.960
workers around the country,
both current and former workers.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.150
They've described the pace of
work as being really grueling.

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:04.310
In the early thinking about
rates and how far you could

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:07.910
push human beings in terms of
their productivity, what was the

00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:09.330
thinking about that?

00:37:09.330 --> 00:37:11.130
&gt;&gt; Well, obviously if the rates

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.470
are too high, you're not going
to have people showing up for

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:14.470
work.

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.881
So, we have 600,000 people at

00:37:16.881 --> 00:37:19.890
the company, most of them are in
the fulfillment centers, and

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:24.580
they-they come to work every
day, they stay for years.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.460
These are considered great jobs
in the hundreds of communities

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.320
where we have fulfillment
centers all over the world,

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:33.140
and in the U.S. we have, almost
every state has an operation in

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.830
it, and people come to work
because these are great jobs.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.480
They're safe, we pay double the
minimum wage, the national

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.810
minimum wage, we have terrific
benefits.

00:37:40.810 --> 00:37:43.021
The benefits for the folks that
work on the floor are the same

00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:45.950
benefits that my family has
access to-- our family leave is

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:47.710
like 20 weeks.

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.710
So, the rates are set so that we

00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:53.430
can accomplish what we need to,
which is get orders to customers

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:57.420
in a-a reasonable time and in a
high-quality way, and that

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:01.800
creates a workplace that people
want to come back to, and they

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.800
do.

00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.820
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon wouldn't

00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:06.280
tell us how long
fulfillment-center workers stay

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.780
on the job or how often they're
injured.

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:12.420
But workers we spoke to say the
rates are higher than other

00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:16.180
warehouses-- and that the
company rebuffs attempts to

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.710
unionize.

00:38:18.710 --> 00:38:19.930
&gt;&gt; We do not believe unions are

00:38:19.930 --> 00:38:22.890
in the best interest of our
customers, our shareholders, or

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:24.840
most importantly, our
associates.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.540
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This is a clip from
a video the company says it

00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.680
used in the past to teach
managers about employees'

00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.660
rights and labor laws.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:34.050
&gt;&gt; The most obvious signs would

00:38:34.050 --> 00:38:37.890
include use of words associated
with unions or union-led

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.160
movements like "living wage" or
"steward."

00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:44.350
&gt;&gt; Early on, Amazon took
a position to basically be

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:45.920
anti-union.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.140
Why was that decision made?

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.609
&gt;&gt; I don't think we made the
decision to be anti-union.

00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:52.990
We just feel that all of the
things that-that unions

00:38:52.990 --> 00:38:57.779
would-would want to-to get us
to do, we've already done.

00:38:57.779 --> 00:38:59.609
&gt;&gt; What-what about
setting rate, though?

00:38:59.609 --> 00:39:02.170
Do you not see that there's a
little bit more leverage in the

00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:05.090
hands of management in this
scenario than there would be in

00:39:05.090 --> 00:39:06.090
a unionized environment?

00:39:06.090 --> 00:39:07.510
&gt;&gt; I don't know, it's hard to

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.420
speculate on that, but-but I do
think that we have the

00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:14.400
obligation to set rates that
are, again, going to encourage

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:20.280
people to seek these jobs and
deliver for customers, you know,

00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:21.280
what we've promised.

00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:22.280
&gt;&gt; What would you say to

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.790
someone, though, who's, who's
worked in-in your fulfillment

00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:28.670
centers that feels as though
there's been... that-that humans

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:31.660
are increasingly being treated
like robots?

00:39:31.660 --> 00:39:33.560
'Cause it's something that we've
actually heard, and I don't

00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.540
sense it's hyperbole.

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.310
&gt;&gt; Well, that's not the

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:40.800
experience that-that I had in
setting it up or that I've

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.800
seen.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:43.210
It's, it's certainly true

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:46.921
that-that these jobs are not for
everybody, and there-there may

00:39:46.921 --> 00:39:50.010
be people that don't want to do
this kind of work.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.820
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon executives
also stress the company has

00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:55.960
become an industry leader in
training its workforce for

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.290
career advancement.

00:39:58.290 --> 00:39:59.530
&gt;&gt; We just announced a pledge

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:04.089
recently to spend $700 million
to upskill, which is basically

00:40:04.089 --> 00:40:07.191
creating career opportunities
for people, 100,000 of our

00:40:07.191 --> 00:40:08.191
employees.

00:40:08.191 --> 00:40:09.650
We pay 95% of tuition to go

00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:13.599
to-to college to get a skill
that isn't about Amazon, that's

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:16.440
about creating options for the
employees, and I would expect

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.540
those people to take advantage
of that, work for us for a

00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.000
couple of years and then go do
something that they would much

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.099
rather do, and that's okay.

00:40:25.099 --> 00:40:27.080
&gt;&gt; There will be people

00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:30.900
that will hear what y'all are
saying, and they'll say, "Well,

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.510
you signed up for physical
labor, a job is a job, there

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:39.609
were benefits, and they are now
investing $700 million to

00:40:39.609 --> 00:40:42.690
do retraining for other types of
jobs.

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:43.740
What's the real grievance?

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:44.760
What is there to complain

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:45.760
about?"

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.760
&gt;&gt; I actually used to think that

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.760
way for a while whenever I, when
I first started, whoever I heard

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.609
complaints from, I was like,
"Well, it was in the job

00:40:51.609 --> 00:40:53.820
description, and you signed up
for it."

00:40:53.820 --> 00:41:00.000
The part they don't talk about
is the safety rules that you

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.130
have to ignore to make rate.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:03.130
It's not just you go in, okay,

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.550
and you-you do your job, and
that's it.

00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:07.980
&gt;&gt; So, you're in, you're
in a weird bind.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:12.849
&gt;&gt; It's incredibly hard to meet
rate while following all the

00:41:12.849 --> 00:41:15.770
safety procedures.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:16.770
&gt;&gt; A complaint that

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:19.710
we've heard from workers in
terms of the sort of automation

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:23.241
of their work as humans, some of
them telling us that, yes, there

00:41:23.241 --> 00:41:26.430
are high safety standards in
these fulfillment centers, but

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:29.140
that in order to make rate,
they're having to cheat the

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.140
standard a little bit.

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.140
&gt;&gt; Well, I would say that's not

00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.140
okay.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.079
So I, from the moment that I

00:41:34.079 --> 00:41:37.619
arrived 20 years ago, I made it
very clear to our operations

00:41:37.619 --> 00:41:40.240

durability?

Is that paint leaded?

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:59.829

assume that there's a pretty

high safety standard on Amazon.

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.150

companies, takes the position

that causes harm at Walmart or

00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:25.770
at Target, a consumer can sue
Walmart or Target.

00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:27.319

forcing you, when you come

00:49:27.319 --> 00:49:30.099
into Walmart, to enter the doors
of Walmart.

00:49:30.099 --> 00:49:32.820
They aren't making you sign
away your rights.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.650
&gt;&gt; But when do you sign
that when you go on Amazon.com?

00:49:35.650 --> 00:49:36.650
&gt;&gt; When you make your account.

00:49:36.650 --> 00:49:38.090
When you accept the terms and

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:39.819
conditions.

00:49:39.819 --> 00:49:41.960
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: People have been

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.390
challenging Amazon's terms and
conditions in court.

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.599
Some have even been successful.

00:49:48.599 --> 00:49:51.480
&gt;&gt; Ultimately, who's on the hook

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.960
when a customer buys a
dangerous product on Amazon?

00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:57.320
Who takes ultimate
responsibility for that?

00:49:57.320 --> 00:49:59.819
&gt;&gt; Well, in the rare case where
that, where something like that

00:49:59.819 --> 00:50:03.130
happens, if it's a third-party
seller, the sale is by a

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:06.920
third-party seller, and it is
the seller's responsibility to,

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.980
to sell a legitimate product to
a customer, and then, when

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:13.619
Amazon is the retailer, and we
sell a product to the, to a

00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:16.691
customer, then it's our
obligation to make sure that we

00:50:16.691 --> 00:50:20.350
understand the manufacturer and
the supply chain for that

00:50:20.350 --> 00:50:23.079
product and its, and its safety.

00:50:23.079 --> 00:50:24.109

00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:28.850
sellers are selling in your
store, you're not responsible

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:32.720
for it ultimately, if they're
selling your customer a

00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:34.480
defective or dangerous product?

00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.090
&gt;&gt; I think the way things work

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:41.440
in the U.S. is that the seller
of record is the person who is

00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:45.970
setting the price and who is
purchasing the product, and for

00:50:45.970 --> 00:50:49.340
things not sold by Amazon-- and
it says on the detail page,

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.010
it'll tell you who the seller
is-- it's the seller's

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:56.730
responsibility for those things,
and for us, it's very clear.

00:50:56.730 --> 00:50:59.589
It says Amazon.com whenever we
sell it.

00:50:59.589 --> 00:51:01.820
&gt;&gt; Do you audit your
sellers in terms of whether

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:06.510
they're actually providing safe
products to your customers?

00:51:06.510 --> 00:51:07.510
&gt;&gt; We do...

00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:08.660
You know, some of our sales...

00:51:08.660 --> 00:51:13.250
So about, almost 60% of our
sales are by third parties,

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:17.050
and those sales, some of them
come directly from the third

00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:18.840
party, so we're not involved
at all.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:19.840
&gt;&gt; But you take a cut.

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.100
I mean, it's on your

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:24.170
infrastructure, it goes through
Amazon.com, so, I mean...

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:26.150
&gt;&gt; Well, it's on our
infrastructure in terms of the

00:51:26.150 --> 00:51:28.360
website and payments, but we're
not...

00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:31.349
&gt;&gt; And fees that, you
know, you're taking a cut of the

00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:32.490
sale, right?

00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:34.589
&gt;&gt; Sure, sure, and we're

00:51:34.589 --> 00:51:36.490
providing, you know, traffic
that, that...

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:38.730
You know, it's kind of the way
they think about marketing is

00:51:38.730 --> 00:51:41.950
why they would pay that fee,
but...

00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:48.550
It's harder to, before an
experience, inspect that, that

00:51:48.550 --> 00:51:50.040
product.

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.040
&gt;&gt; A South Carolina woman who

00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:53.809
bought a hair dryer on Amazon
said this happened.

00:51:53.809 --> 00:51:56.200
&gt;&gt; Fire is coming out of the
hair dryer.

00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.520
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon's approach
has had consequences.

00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:01.450
&gt;&gt; A hoverboard caused a fire
that destroyed their home.

00:52:01.450 --> 00:52:04.040
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Dangerous products
were flagged by authorities in

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.180
Washington State.

00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.180
&gt;&gt; ...found dozens of school

00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.839
supplies that had high levels
of toxic metals.

00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:12.210
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And a recent report
found thousands of banned,

00:52:12.210 --> 00:52:14.410
unsafe, or mislabeled products.

00:52:14.410 --> 00:52:16.670
&gt;&gt; I'm having a hard time

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:20.350
understanding something, which
is that, that...

00:52:20.350 --> 00:52:24.950
You know, Amazon's entire brand
is about the customer, right?

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:25.950
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:26.950
&gt;&gt; That it's...

00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:29.240
&gt;&gt; Oh, I reminded them of this
over and over again.

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:31.119
&gt;&gt; You reminded them of
what?

00:52:31.119 --> 00:52:34.340
&gt;&gt; I said that no customer
wants to buy an unsafe product.

00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.930
No customer wants selection
that harms their child.

00:52:36.930 --> 00:52:38.670
No customer wants to buy
something that burns down their

00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:43.449
house because it looks cool and
it's the latest, coolest thing.

00:52:43.449 --> 00:52:46.339
&gt;&gt; Sitting here today,
are you able to basically say

00:52:46.339 --> 00:52:50.529
that the products that you sell
on Amazon.com are safe?

00:52:50.529 --> 00:52:54.030
&gt;&gt; What I can say is, we work
really hard to make sure that

00:52:54.030 --> 00:52:55.030
they're safe.

00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:56.030
We have...

00:52:56.030 --> 00:53:01.140
We've spent $400 million in the
last year on systems that seek

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:04.450
out things that are not safe,
and, you know, there are

00:53:04.450 --> 00:53:08.020
millions of sellers and hundreds
of millions of products, and

00:53:08.020 --> 00:53:11.359
our job is to, as fast as we
can, weed out the ones that

00:53:11.359 --> 00:53:12.359
don't belong on our site.

00:53:12.359 --> 00:53:13.359
We're going to have to be

00:53:13.359 --> 00:53:16.980
vigilant as a retailer and as a
technology company, and we are

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:20.590
definitely dedicated to, to
protecting the safety of our

00:53:20.590 --> 00:53:21.590
customers.

00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:22.590
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: We heard that

00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:25.540
concern for the customer over
and over in our interviews with

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.330
Amazon executives.

00:53:27.330 --> 00:53:29.260
&gt;&gt; Customer trust in a company

00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.829
like Amazon, it's sort of
foundational.

00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:34.330
&gt;&gt; Customer obsession is the
first leadership principle, and

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:36.599
it, it's not a corporate slogan.

00:53:36.599 --> 00:53:38.349
&gt;&gt; We try to stay really focused

00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:39.370
on customers.

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:40.990
&gt;&gt; Very focused on, on

00:53:40.990 --> 00:53:42.670
delivering results for our
customers.

00:53:42.670 --> 00:53:45.589
&gt;&gt; Providing a great customer
experience that customers want.

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:48.089
&gt;&gt; Delivering that, that
customer delight.

00:53:48.089 --> 00:53:51.070
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: This commitment to
the customer, and to keeping

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:55.050
prices low, had another benefit:
it helped them avoid running

00:53:55.050 --> 00:54:00.039
afoul of regulators who enforce
the nation's antitrust laws.

00:54:00.039 --> 00:54:02.589
&gt;&gt; It's important to understand
sort of that there's two

00:54:02.589 --> 00:54:06.650
fundamental philosophies of
antitrust, of anti-monopoly law.

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:09.040
You know, there's the
traditional philosophy, in which

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:13.570
you, you want to break up all
potential concentrations of

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:15.250
power that you can.

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:18.650
But for the last 30 years,

00:54:18.650 --> 00:54:21.290
there's been this change in how
we do antitrust.

00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:25.630
And this is the idea that the
only purpose of antitrust should

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:31.230
be to drive prices lower, to
serve the interest of the

00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:33.359
consumer.

00:54:33.359 --> 00:54:35.980
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Lynn had been

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:39.420
urging regulators to take a more
traditional approach and

00:54:39.420 --> 00:54:42.280
examine whether the company was
gaining market power in

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:47.210
exploitative ways: stifling fair
competition, but keeping prices

00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:50.010
low for consumers.

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:51.890
&gt;&gt; We live in a society

00:54:51.890 --> 00:54:55.200
of consumers, though, and
seemingly there is some net

00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.770
benefit to all of us when
prices are low.

00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.299
So, what's wrong with that view
of things?

00:55:01.299 --> 00:55:03.980
&gt;&gt; It's obviously good for
people to... for all people if

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:07.050
we can drive down prices, if we
have lower-priced drugs, if we

00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:10.079
have books that anybody could
buy.

00:55:10.079 --> 00:55:11.079
That's a good thing.

00:55:11.079 --> 00:55:12.079
It's a good thing for society,

00:55:12.079 --> 00:55:15.309
and it's a good thing for us as
consumers.

00:55:15.309 --> 00:55:19.310
But we're not only consumers,
we're also citizens.

00:55:19.310 --> 00:55:20.720
We're also producers.

00:55:20.720 --> 00:55:22.720
We're also people who think and

00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:27.200
who make things and who grow
things, and we want to have

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:29.150
access to open markets.

00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:31.369
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Once again, the

00:55:31.369 --> 00:55:35.490
tension was most pronounced
with book publishers.

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:39.079
Amazon was selling around 40%
of all new books in America

00:55:39.079 --> 00:55:42.740
and two-thirds of all electronic
books, thanks to the success of

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:44.010
the Kindle.

00:55:44.010 --> 00:55:46.770
Then, one of the world's largest

00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:50.020
publishers, Hachette, decided to
push back.

00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:53.240
Franklin Foer was one of its
authors.

00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:58.120
&gt;&gt; Hachette and Amazon set out
to renegotiate their e-book

00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.120
contract.

00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.680
And Hachette said, "No, we don't

00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:03.130
accept the terms of your
contract."

00:56:03.130 --> 00:56:06.460
And Amazon basically said, "To
hell with you, Hachette.

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:08.839
We're going to stop delivering
your books.

00:56:08.839 --> 00:56:11.540
If somebody searches for a
Hachette title, we're going to

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:13.609
redirect them to another
publisher."

00:56:13.609 --> 00:56:17.760
&gt;&gt; Amazon's battle with Hachette
and the authors that Hachette

00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.230
publishes is heating up.

00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:21.120
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As Bezos's virtual

00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.420
blockade dragged on for months.

00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.710
&gt;&gt; A bitter, seven-month

00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:26.030
standoff...

00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:27.349
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Thousands of

00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:30.230
authors, including bestsellers
like Douglas Preston, were

00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:31.940
caught in the middle.

00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.809
&gt;&gt; Some authors were losing 50%

00:56:33.809 --> 00:56:37.559
to 90% of their sales from
Amazon.

00:56:37.559 --> 00:56:41.780
It was absolutely devastating
to first-time authors.

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:45.950
It actually destroyed their
careers.

00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:47.390
&gt;&gt; Did you see your
sales plummet?

00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:48.390
&gt;&gt; I did, yes.

00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:49.740
I saw my sales plummet

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:50.740
tremendously.

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.510
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In frustration,

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:57.130
Preston penned an open letter
on behalf of all authors.

00:56:57.130 --> 00:57:01.020
It was published in "The New
York Times" with more than 900

00:57:01.020 --> 00:57:02.380
signatures.

00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:04.490
&gt;&gt; We authors have loved Amazon.

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:07.700
We have enthusiastically
supported it, and this is how

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:09.070
they treat us?

00:57:09.070 --> 00:57:11.480
This is not right.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.990
&gt;&gt; Amazon has been accused of
doing everything from raising

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:15.940
prices to deliberately delaying
shipments.

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:18.720
&gt;&gt; Is this what happens when
Jeff Bezos decides to flex his

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.720
muscles?

00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.720
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: While Hachette and

00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:24.450
Amazon were at an impasse,
Douglas Preston, Franklin Foer,

00:57:24.450 --> 00:57:28.100
and other authors went to
Washington, and asked the Obama

00:57:28.100 --> 00:57:30.910
administration to open an
investigation.

00:57:30.910 --> 00:57:33.690
&gt;&gt; I went to the Justice
Department and I went to the

00:57:33.690 --> 00:57:37.030
Federal Trade Commission with
the Authors Guild, and we tried

00:57:37.030 --> 00:57:41.420
to explain to them why this
power was so dangerous.

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:44.280
We pointed it out of all the
ways in which Amazon was

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.920
bullying the publishing
industry.

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:50.480
&gt;&gt; The Department of Justice
listened to us.

00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:55.690
And their answer was essentially
this: "Amazon is one of the most

00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:58.589
popular companies in the
country.

00:57:58.589 --> 00:58:01.569
(camera clicks)
They have brought tremendous

00:58:01.569 --> 00:58:06.230
services to consumers, and
they've brought lower prices."

00:58:06.230 --> 00:58:08.830
And that we hadn't given them
any kind of reason to open an

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:10.150
antitrust investigation.

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:11.700
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Eventually,

00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:15.640
Hachette and Amazon would
settle their dispute, with

00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:19.119
Amazon allowing Hachette to set
its own prices for e-books, but

00:58:19.119 --> 00:58:21.680
offering it incentives to keep
them low.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:26.250
&gt;&gt; It's great to be here at
Amazon.

00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:29.000
(crowd cheering)
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon would thrive

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.569
during the Obama years, and
eventually account for nearly

00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:35.960
40% of all online commerce in
the country.

00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:40.410
&gt;&gt; Last year, during the busiest
day of the Christmas rush,

00:58:40.410 --> 00:58:44.740
customers around the world
ordered more than 300 items from

00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.390
Amazon every second.

00:58:46.390 --> 00:58:47.859
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But the complaints

00:58:47.859 --> 00:58:51.250
about its tactics would
continue, with retailers of all

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:54.690
kinds concerned that Amazon had
become the online-shopping

00:58:54.690 --> 00:58:55.690
gatekeeper.

00:58:55.690 --> 00:58:58.410
&gt;&gt; You've got to be on Amazon.

00:58:58.410 --> 00:59:01.770
You have to be there, because
that's where everyone is.

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:02.770
That...

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:05.530
100 million Prime
subscribers.

00:59:05.530 --> 00:59:09.000
They are the de facto e-commerce
channel in the United States,

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.980
period, end of list.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:12.980
&gt;&gt; Amazon executives

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:16.990
have told us that there are many
other options out there.

00:59:16.990 --> 00:59:19.430
There is Walmart, there is
Alibaba.

00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:21.440
As a seller, you've got options.

00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:24.130
&gt;&gt; I've heard that response from

00:59:24.130 --> 00:59:28.559
Amazon executives before, and we
did that, we were listed, we

00:59:28.559 --> 00:59:32.619
listed all of our products on
every other online marketplace.

00:59:32.619 --> 00:59:37.250
But it's a testament to just
how good Amazon is.

00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:41.150
All of the others that were
non-Amazon combined did about

00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:45.020
ten percent of what we were
doing on Amazon.

00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:48.270
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Businesses big and
small have been accumulating

00:59:48.270 --> 00:59:51.109
complaints about Amazon's hold
on them.

00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:54.720
&gt;&gt; On Amazon, the customer
belongs to Amazon-- it doesn't

00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.480
belong to the third-party
seller.

00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.969
You're basically renting the
Amazon customer.

00:59:58.969 --> 01:00:01.839
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: James Thomson used
to recruit brands to come onto

01:00:01.839 --> 01:00:05.770
Amazon and now advises them on
how to do business with the

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:06.770
company.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:08.780
&gt;&gt; I represent brands today that

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:11.349
face a number of challenges with
Amazon.

01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:14.270
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Among those
challenges, businesses say that

01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:17.860
Amazon has access to their
valuable data, which gives it an

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:19.089
unfair advantage.

01:00:19.089 --> 01:00:20.480
They also complain about

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.349
increasingly higher fees to stay
on the platform, and pressure to

01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:30.780
use Amazon's warehouses and
shipping services.

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:34.069
We spoke to numerous name-brand
companies, but none would share

01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:36.160
its grievances on camera.

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.170
&gt;&gt; My account was suspended.

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:39.809
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Some small
businesspeople have been

01:00:39.809 --> 01:00:42.300
talking about their
experiences-- good and bad--

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:43.300
online.

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:44.300
&gt;&gt; When you're selling on

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.180
Amazon, you're playing in
someone else's playground.

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:51.569
&gt;&gt; Who gets placed where,
whether or not your product

01:00:51.569 --> 01:00:52.990
shows up in the search
results...

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:54.920
&gt;&gt; They suspended my account
without warning.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.250
&gt;&gt; These are all things that are
governed by Amazon's rules.

01:00:59.250 --> 01:01:02.490
And if there's a dispute within
that arena, if you feel you are

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:05.690
mistreated, you know, the judge
and jury is Amazon.

01:01:05.690 --> 01:01:09.010
&gt;&gt; They don't care, they'll just
kill your account like that or

01:01:09.010 --> 01:01:10.010
suspend it...

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:11.069
&gt;&gt; There are all sorts of crazy

01:01:11.069 --> 01:01:14.980
stories about why people get
their accounts shut down on

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:15.980
Amazon.

01:01:15.980 --> 01:01:16.980
And it could take a week, it

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:18.330
could take months, it could be
never before you're back online

01:01:18.330 --> 01:01:19.710
again.

01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.430
Amazon has the upper hand and

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:26.880
the ability to basically take
your business away from you at

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.440
any given moment.

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:31.140
&gt;&gt; Selling on Amazon, take one.

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.520
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon said
third-party sellers account for

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:36.109
more than half of everything
sold on the site.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:38.400
&gt;&gt; I sell mini-longboard
skateboards.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.420
&gt;&gt; I sell mineral water.

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.420
This is what I do.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.720
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And it's
committed to its sellers'

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.849
success-- proactively contacting
them when their accounts are at

01:01:45.849 --> 01:01:49.930
risk of suspension and offering
an appeals process to resolve

01:01:49.930 --> 01:01:50.930
disputes.

01:01:50.930 --> 01:01:52.270
&gt;&gt; You already have great

01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:53.270
products.

01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:54.270
Scale up...

01:01:54.270 --> 01:01:56.720
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But in the eyes of
some businesses, Amazon has

01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.240
essentially become like the
railroads at the turn of the

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:03.079
last century that controlled
the flow of commerce across the

01:02:03.079 --> 01:02:04.079
country.

01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:06.180
&gt;&gt; Start selling today.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.980
&gt;&gt; Do you see yourself
as being kind of like the rails

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:12.890
for e-commerce, that sellers
bring their goods to market

01:02:12.890 --> 01:02:14.820
on your rails, through your
marketplace?

01:02:14.820 --> 01:02:19.600
&gt;&gt; I don't think of it that way,
and here's why: the, the vast

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.080
majority of stuff that's...

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.080
Well, all of the stuff that's

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.340
sold is manufactured, right?

01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.970
So it's manufactured, meaning

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:28.640
there are brands and factories
that produce stuff and then sell

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:30.240
it.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:32.460
We're one percent of the retail

01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:34.060
sales in the world, about.

01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:35.160
&gt;&gt; Well, you are the

01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:36.940
biggest marketplace online,
right?

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:39.510
&gt;&gt; No, so, again, I, I don't...

01:02:39.510 --> 01:02:43.390
The idea that there's an online,

01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:45.790
distinct for brands to sell
their stuff and distinct from

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:49.710
physical, just doesn't make
sense to me, and we're far from

01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:51.099
the largest retailer.

01:02:51.099 --> 01:02:53.440
So, I, I describe this as

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.180
retail, and we're competing
against Walmart and Target and

01:02:56.180 --> 01:03:00.349
Costco and Carrefour and Alibaba
and Tmall and all kinds of folks

01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:05.830
who are, are now selling both
physical stores and online.

01:03:05.830 --> 01:03:09.210
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In addition to
pointing to other large

01:03:09.210 --> 01:03:12.400
retailers, inside the company
employees have been

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:17.189
schooled in how to talk about
its size and power.

01:03:17.189 --> 01:03:19.799
&gt;&gt; When I worked at Amazon, we
had training specifically on the

01:03:19.799 --> 01:03:22.770
use of terms like "monopoly."

01:03:22.770 --> 01:03:23.830
We were not allowed to use a

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:26.440
term like "market share."

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.640
Amazon has what's known as

01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:29.720
"market segment share."

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.299
What is market segment?

01:03:31.299 --> 01:03:32.630
What is market segment share?

01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:34.230
I don't know, but I know that

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:38.090
the lawyers at Amazon feel those
terms are, are much safer than

01:03:38.090 --> 01:03:40.040
using terms like market share.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.040
&gt;&gt; So market share was

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:42.940
something they were really
concerned about.

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:48.020
&gt;&gt; Clearly somebody with the
necessary legal training or PR

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:51.960
training recognized that Amazon
was growing very quickly, and

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:56.400
when we were asked to use the
term "market segment" and

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.300
"market segment share," in
essence it's a polite way of

01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:03.349
saying, "I'm not going to talk
to you about how big we are."

01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:07.880
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Since leaving
Amazon 20 years ago, Shel

01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:10.890
Kaphan has been watching the
company with increasing

01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:14.720
concern, and he's speaking
about it for the first time.

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.630
&gt;&gt; I think that the
characterization of Amazon as

01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:25.000
being a ruthless competitor is
true, and under the flag of

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.829
customer obsession, they can do
a lot of things which might not

01:04:28.829 --> 01:04:31.980
be good for people who aren't
their customers.

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:34.490
&gt;&gt; I know you're not a
legal scholar, but are you

01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:37.579
basically concerned that Amazon
is a monopoly?

01:04:37.579 --> 01:04:41.290
&gt;&gt; I'm, I'm concerned that it
has that type of power.

01:04:41.290 --> 01:04:43.910
I think it, you know, whether
you technically can call it a

01:04:43.910 --> 01:04:49.740
monopoly or not, I don't know.

01:04:49.740 --> 01:04:50.740
♪ ♪

01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:55.260
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That question has
continued to loom over Amazon.

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:58.819
&gt;&gt; I think that Amazon is
looking out, and the existential

01:04:58.819 --> 01:05:03.900
threat that they may face is
going to be from government.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.380
It's whether or not
policymakers are going to step

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:10.349
in and intervene and say, "You
have too much power."

01:05:10.349 --> 01:05:14.220
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: For years, Bezos
has been ramping up Amazon's

01:05:14.220 --> 01:05:17.240
profile in Washington.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.349
&gt;&gt; Amazon has been lobbying the

01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:19.349
F.A.A. to lift...

01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:20.349
&gt;&gt; Trying to cozy up to

01:05:20.349 --> 01:05:24.000
politicians, so that they will
give him the biggest tax breaks

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
around...

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Spending millions a

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
year on lobbying.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
&gt;&gt; Amazon lobbied more

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.960
government entities than any
other tech company.

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.890
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And hiring as its
spokesman the former White House

01:05:32.890 --> 01:05:35.010
press secretary Jay Carney.

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:37.460
&gt;&gt; You've got an army of

01:05:37.460 --> 01:05:39.690
lobbyists, many of whom have
revolved in and out of

01:05:39.690 --> 01:05:41.780
government, including yourself.

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:43.110
What are you hoping to get for

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:46.809
all that lobbying spend and all
that influence?

01:05:46.809 --> 01:05:48.520
&gt;&gt; One of the things we
discovered is, because of the

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:51.440
visibility of our company, but
also the range of businesses

01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:54.900
that we're in, we need
subject-matter experts on food

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:59.930
safety, on transportation, on
drones, on privacy.

01:05:59.930 --> 01:06:03.319
And also, we can be a resource,
an information provider to

01:06:03.319 --> 01:06:04.860
policymakers and regulators.

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.160
It's not lobbying in the

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:08.400
traditional sense, in terms of
trying to persuade somebody to

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:11.059
do something, it's just
answering questions and, and

01:06:11.059 --> 01:06:14.150
providing data and information.

01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:16.780
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos himself would

01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:21.030
also become a presence in the
capital, and eventually buy the

01:06:21.030 --> 01:06:24.170
largest private residence in
town.

01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:27.290
&gt;&gt; Jeff Bezos never really
showed much interest in

01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:31.150
politics, but as he's cemented
himself in the city, he's

01:06:31.150 --> 01:06:33.950
started to acquire this physical
presence.

01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:37.650
He bought a mansion, then
developed it into a place that

01:06:37.650 --> 01:06:40.470
is explicitly designed to be
social.

01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:44.059
&gt;&gt; It has a big ballroom, I
mean, it is designed to create a

01:06:44.059 --> 01:06:48.109
real presence for him in the
nation's capital, where he can

01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:50.860
hobnob with the people who make
decisions.

01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:54.579
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: He'd even bought
the hometown newspaper...

01:06:54.579 --> 01:06:57.440
&gt;&gt; Jeff Bezos sent a thunderbolt
through the media world this

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:58.440
week...

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.440
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Spending a quarter

01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.109
of a billion dollars to rescue
the struggling "Washington

01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:03.109
Post."

01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:04.410
&gt;&gt; I do believe that democracy

01:07:04.410 --> 01:07:05.549
dies in darkness.

01:07:05.549 --> 01:07:07.280
I think that the capital city

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:11.349
of the United States of America
needs a paper like "The

01:07:11.349 --> 01:07:12.349
Washington Post."

01:07:12.349 --> 01:07:14.359
&gt;&gt; I got to say, you know, full

01:07:14.359 --> 01:07:18.400
credit to him, he hasn't
intervened in any of the

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.630
coverage of the paper.

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:22.470
And he's invested in the paper.

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:27.470
Every dollar of profit that the
paper makes is plowed back into

01:07:27.470 --> 01:07:29.579
making it a better paper.

01:07:29.579 --> 01:07:33.000
&gt;&gt; Bezos allowed the "Post" to

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:36.320
hire, to restock its newsroom,
he reversed what had been an

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.670
atmosphere of sort of decline.

01:07:38.670 --> 01:07:39.670
I'd say "The Washington Post"

01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:42.440
has really flourished under,
under Bezos's ownership.

&gt;&gt; Let's cut this digital
ribbon.

01:07:45.290 --> 01:07:48.819
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: At the time,
critics saw a more cynical

01:07:48.819 --> 01:07:49.819
motive.

01:07:49.819 --> 01:07:50.819
&gt;&gt; Perhaps he's buying "The

Washington Post" to buy some
sort of protection.

01:07:53.110 --> 01:07:54.110
&gt;&gt; Precisely.

01:07:54.110 --> 01:07:55.280
&gt;&gt; This deal could give him more

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.070

Washington, DC, just to go to
the free museums.

01:08:04.010 --> 01:08:07.180
You buy a home in Washington,
you buy a newspaper in

01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:10.920
Washington, because it is the
most influential city in the

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:15.999
world, and you want to lay your
hands on that power.

&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos saw a

01:08:18.359 --> 01:08:21.819
business opportunity there, as
well.

01:08:21.819 --> 01:08:25.159
The Obama administration planned
to modernize the federal

01:08:25.159 --> 01:08:28.929
government by embracing cloud
computing.

01:08:28.929 --> 01:08:32.589
Bezos had been quietly building
a revolutionary cloud computing

01:08:32.589 --> 01:08:33.589
business.

01:08:33.589 --> 01:08:35.669
He called it Amazon Web

01:08:35.669 --> 01:08:37.949
Services.

01:08:37.949 --> 01:08:39.089
&gt;&gt; It's basically computing

01:08:39.089 --> 01:08:42.519
power in the cloud, but really
it's Amazon's server farms

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:46.190
around the world that give
people access to the kind of

01:08:46.190 --> 01:08:48.630
technology services they need.

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:50.409
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To keep Amazon

01:08:50.409 --> 01:08:53.889
running, Bezos had developed an
unprecedented digital

01:08:53.889 --> 01:08:54.889
infrastructure.

01:08:54.889 --> 01:08:56.929
He realized he could rent parts

01:08:56.929 --> 01:09:01.019
of it out, not just to
businesses, but also to the

01:09:01.019 --> 01:09:03.449
government.

01:09:03.449 --> 01:09:04.540
&gt;&gt; Our infrastructure is built

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.289
to satisfy the security
standards of the most

01:09:07.289 --> 01:09:09.109
risk-sensitive organizations.

01:09:09.109 --> 01:09:10.880
&gt;&gt; He's already got a huge edge

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.589
over the other big competitors
in it.

01:09:13.589 --> 01:09:18.479
So he wants to take that lead
and capture the U.S. government.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:23.349
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: In 2013, he got a
major boost when it was

01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:26.019
revealed that Amazon Web
Services had designed a

01:09:26.019 --> 01:09:30.469

01:09:30.469 --> 01:09:31.469
&gt;&gt; Amazon Web Services was

01:09:31.469 --> 01:09:34.949
awarded a ten-year contract for
$600 million.

01:09:34.949 --> 01:09:37.429
&gt;&gt; Amazon is helping the C.I.A.
build a secure cloud computer

network...

01:09:38.429 --> 01:09:39.449
&gt;&gt; The C.I.A. contract was

01:09:39.449 --> 01:09:42.309
probably one of the best things
that happened to Amazon's cloud

01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:43.309
business.

01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:45.409
It lifted all doubts about the

01:09:45.409 --> 01:09:49.080
security of the cloud and on
whether you could trust Amazon

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.139
with your most precious data.

01:09:51.139 --> 01:09:53.269
&gt;&gt; The message to the world is,

01:09:53.269 --> 01:09:56.369
"If the C.I.A. trusts Amazon
with its data, then maybe other

01:09:56.369 --> 01:09:59.860
companies and government
institutions can, as well."

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:01.820

which computers can think and
make decisions for humans and

of "Star Trek."

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:22.070
He, he admits that that was on

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:26.959
his brain when he came up with
the idea that Amazon should be

Amazon, having had a head start,

extremely important to this

01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:32.439
It's extremely hard to do, and,
you know, convincing people to

&gt;&gt; Well, I, I would first
disagree with the premise.

01:14:51.999 --> 01:14:53.860
It doesn't, it's not a
listening device.

01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:57.419
The, the device in its core
is...

01:14:57.419 --> 01:14:58.530
It has a detector on it.

01:14:58.530 --> 01:14:59.650

01:15:02.469 --> 01:15:05.369
listening-- not really
listening-- it's detecting one

01:15:05.369 --> 01:15:09.949

is the word you've said that you

listen and transcribe some of
those recordings to help train

01:15:28.959 --> 01:15:31.729
did a good enough job of
disclosing that to consumers?

01:15:31.729 --> 01:15:35.349
That, that there are humans
involved in listening to these

01:15:35.349 --> 01:15:36.510
recordings?

01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:39.409
&gt;&gt; We, we try to articulate what

01:15:39.409 --> 01:15:41.979
we're doing with our products as
clearly as we can.

01:15:41.979 --> 01:15:46.329
But if I could go back in time,
and I could be more clear, and

01:15:46.329 --> 01:15:51.229
the team could be more clear, on
how we were using human beings

01:15:51.229 --> 01:15:55.380
to annotate a small percentage
of the data, I would, for sure.

01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:57.610
What I would say, though, is
that once we realized that

01:15:57.610 --> 01:16:00.219
customers didn't clearly
understand this, and within a

01:16:00.219 --> 01:16:02.729
couple of days, we added an
opt-out feature, so that

01:16:02.729 --> 01:16:06.550
customers could turn off
annotation if they, if they so

01:16:06.550 --> 01:16:07.550
chose.

01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:09.159
And then within a month or two

01:16:09.159 --> 01:16:11.720
later, we allowed people to
auto-delete data, which they

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:14.059
also asked for within that,
within that time frame.

01:16:14.059 --> 01:16:16.440
You know, we're not going to
always be perfect, but when we

01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:19.290
make mistakes, I think the key
is that we correct them very

01:16:19.290 --> 01:16:21.429
quickly on behalf of customers.

01:16:21.429 --> 01:16:23.150
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: But even one of the

01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:27.139
founders of Amazon Web Services
approaches his Alexa devices

01:16:27.139 --> 01:16:28.629
with caution.

01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:29.629
&gt;&gt; When do you turn off

01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:30.629
your Alexa?

01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:32.840
&gt;&gt; I turn off my Alexa when I

01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:36.630
know for a fact that the
conversation that I am going to

01:16:36.630 --> 01:16:41.170
have, or, or whenever I just
want to have a private moment.

01:16:41.170 --> 01:16:44.679
I don't want certain
conversations to be heard by

01:16:44.679 --> 01:16:49.440
humans, conversations that I
know for a fact are not things

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:53.909
that should not be shared, then
I actually turn off those

01:16:53.909 --> 01:16:57.820
particular listening devices.

01:16:57.820 --> 01:16:59.469
&gt;&gt; We have had an incredible

01:16:59.469 --> 01:17:00.469
year.

01:17:00.469 --> 01:17:01.469
The team has invented a lot on

01:17:01.469 --> 01:17:04.690
behalf of customers, and I
cannot wait to show you what we

01:17:04.690 --> 01:17:05.690
have.

01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:06.690
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: So far, Limp and

01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:09.260
his team have made Alexa
compatible with more than

01:17:09.260 --> 01:17:11.570
100,000 products.

01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:13.739
&gt;&gt; Echo Frames allow you to get

01:17:13.739 --> 01:17:17.659
done more around you and be more
present in the everyday.

01:17:17.659 --> 01:17:21.150
&gt;&gt; Now they're going to know
more about you than anyone

01:17:21.150 --> 01:17:22.150
knows.

01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:24.729
They're trying to move as

01:17:24.729 --> 01:17:29.499
intimately as possible and as
quietly as possible into

01:17:29.499 --> 01:17:31.300
everyday life.

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:33.869
&gt;&gt; Echo Loop is a smart ring,

01:17:33.869 --> 01:17:37.829
packed with ways to stay on top
of your day.

01:17:37.829 --> 01:17:42.419
&gt;&gt; Amazon wants to have the
entire environment essentially

01:17:42.419 --> 01:17:43.419
miked.

01:17:43.419 --> 01:17:44.820
&gt;&gt; Alexa, start my running

01:17:44.820 --> 01:17:45.820
playlist.

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:47.809
&gt;&gt; They want your walk in the

01:17:47.809 --> 01:17:51.059
park, they want your run down
the city street.

01:17:51.059 --> 01:17:54.409
&gt;&gt; Nationwide's teamed up with
Amazon to bring you the all-new

01:17:54.409 --> 01:17:55.409
Echo Auto.

01:17:55.409 --> 01:17:56.579
&gt;&gt; They want what you do in your

01:17:56.579 --> 01:17:59.619
car, they want what you do in
your home.

01:17:59.619 --> 01:18:00.619
&gt;&gt; Amazon Smart Oven.

01:18:00.619 --> 01:18:02.619
&gt;&gt; Alexa, bake for 30 minutes at

01:18:02.619 --> 01:18:03.619
350 degrees.

01:18:03.619 --> 01:18:04.619
(oven beeps)

01:18:04.619 --> 01:18:07.489
&gt;&gt; All these intimacies, all
this insight is being

01:18:07.489 --> 01:18:11.369
integrated, analyzed and
integrated.

01:18:11.369 --> 01:18:14.040
&gt;&gt; Alexa, alarm off.

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.059
&gt;&gt; That is an extraordinary kind

01:18:16.059 --> 01:18:19.760
of power that has never before
existed.

01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:23.739
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: After Alexa, Amazon
would go on to spend nearly a

01:18:23.739 --> 01:18:25.150
billion dollars to buy Ring...

01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:26.409
&gt;&gt; Hey, bud, the police are on

01:18:26.409 --> 01:18:27.409
the way.

01:18:27.409 --> 01:18:28.829
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: A doorbell camera

01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:32.920
and app that Amazon describes as
"the new neighborhood watch."

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.920
&gt;&gt; Hey, get away!

01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:34.920
&gt;&gt; Get out of there!

01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:38.719
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: To promote it,
Amazon has enlisted the help of

01:18:38.719 --> 01:18:40.579
hundreds of local police
departments.

01:18:40.579 --> 01:18:44.400
&gt;&gt; It's a phenomenal tool to
assist detectives.

01:18:44.400 --> 01:18:47.289
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: They give them
access to a portal to request

01:18:47.289 --> 01:18:52.369
footage and have given free
cameras to hand out-- and

01:18:52.369 --> 01:18:53.650
talking points.

01:18:53.650 --> 01:18:55.650
&gt;&gt; This system is so simple to

01:18:55.650 --> 01:18:56.650
use...

01:18:56.650 --> 01:18:57.829
&gt;&gt; You have Amazon in

01:18:57.829 --> 01:19:00.290
partnership with police
departments, who have basically

01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:04.999
turned policemen into, like,
Avon salespeople for Amazon

01:19:04.999 --> 01:19:06.459
Ring.

01:19:06.459 --> 01:19:08.039
They have given police

01:19:08.039 --> 01:19:12.929
departments talking points and
marketing materials to encourage

01:19:12.929 --> 01:19:16.979
the installation of Ring by
community residents.

01:19:16.979 --> 01:19:18.929
None of this was public
knowledge.

01:19:18.929 --> 01:19:25.210
&gt;&gt; And this is Ring's first
indoor cam.

01:19:25.210 --> 01:19:26.760
It is... cute, is what I would
say.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.809
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Amazon has
continued to expand the scope

01:19:28.809 --> 01:19:30.340
of Ring.

01:19:30.340 --> 01:19:32.170
Last fall, Dave Limp unveiled a

01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:36.710
version designed to monitor the
inside of people's homes.

01:19:36.710 --> 01:19:39.919
Within weeks, hackers discovered
a way to terrorize Ring

01:19:39.919 --> 01:19:56.459
customers.

01:19:56.459 --> 01:19:57.459
&gt;&gt; Did you see that

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:58.459
video?

01:19:58.459 --> 01:19:59.459
&gt;&gt; I did see that video.

01:19:59.459 --> 01:20:00.459
&gt;&gt; What did you think of
it?

01:20:00.459 --> 01:20:02.969
&gt;&gt; I think that that is a
industry problem.

01:20:02.969 --> 01:20:07.469
It's not just about the, a Ring
camera-- it could be about

01:20:07.469 --> 01:20:08.469
anybody's cameras.

01:20:08.469 --> 01:20:11.260
It's about any device in that...

01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:14.579
And we've already investigated
that one to make sure what, what

01:20:14.579 --> 01:20:16.169
the root cause was.

01:20:16.169 --> 01:20:17.550
What we want to be able to do

01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:19.550
in those cases is, we want to
minimize them.

01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:20.750
We'd like to detect them.

01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:22.079
And we also want to build tools

01:20:22.079 --> 01:20:25.360
that give them the ability so
that doesn't... that, that makes

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.820
it harder for those kinds of
attacks to happen.

01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:29.829
There's a lot of bad people in
this world.

01:20:29.829 --> 01:20:32.909
&gt;&gt; Here's a device that
you had described as cute and

01:20:32.909 --> 01:20:37.219
seems harmless, and I'm just
wondering whether you're being

01:20:37.219 --> 01:20:41.130
straight with people about the
attendant risks to your

01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:44.539
customers that you are obsessed
with, supposedly.

01:20:44.539 --> 01:20:47.469
&gt;&gt; Well, it's not supposedly, we
are obsessed with customers.

01:20:47.469 --> 01:20:51.320
I, I would say that we are
trying to build security

01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:56.570
features at every level of the
stack: operating systems,

01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:59.630
authentication, fraud detection.

01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:01.559
We offer things that customers

01:21:01.559 --> 01:21:04.909
can turn on that make it even,
make it even harder for those

01:21:04.909 --> 01:21:05.909
attacks to happen.

01:21:05.909 --> 01:21:06.909
&gt;&gt; Yo, what's up, how's your

01:21:06.909 --> 01:21:07.909
day?

01:21:07.909 --> 01:21:08.909
&gt;&gt; Who is that?

01:21:08.909 --> 01:21:09.909
&gt;&gt; What's going on, buddy?

01:21:09.909 --> 01:21:11.769
What are you watching?

01:21:11.769 --> 01:21:15.610
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: There were a series
of similar attacks across the

01:21:15.610 --> 01:21:16.610
country.

01:21:16.610 --> 01:21:17.610
&gt;&gt; What's up, homie?

01:21:17.610 --> 01:21:18.610
I still see you.

01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:19.610
&gt;&gt; You hungry?

01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:21.079
&gt;&gt; What's going on, my main man
Shaq?

01:21:21.079 --> 01:21:23.310
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And it's not just
hackers.

01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:26.729
Ring has fired some of its own
employees for spying on

01:21:26.729 --> 01:21:27.849
customers.

01:21:27.849 --> 01:21:28.989
&gt;&gt; In George Orwell's

01:21:28.989 --> 01:21:33.590
"1984," he describes a dystopia
in which, "You had to live, you

01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:37.499
did live from habit that became
instinct in the assumption that

01:21:37.499 --> 01:21:40.929
every sound you made was
overheard."

01:21:40.929 --> 01:21:45.829
And I wonder if you ever think
about how easily this could

01:21:45.829 --> 01:21:48.179
become dystopian to some degree?

01:21:48.179 --> 01:21:49.300
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't want to live in

01:21:49.300 --> 01:21:50.300
that world.

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.159
So, I do not want to invent the

01:21:52.159 --> 01:21:55.659
technology that, or have my
teams invent the technology that

01:21:55.659 --> 01:21:57.409
would create that world.

01:21:57.409 --> 01:21:59.590
And so... but I am an optimist.

01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:04.489
I, I think if you take the, the
absolute view of that, we

01:22:04.489 --> 01:22:05.659
wouldn't invent anything.

01:22:05.659 --> 01:22:06.659
&gt;&gt; We're increasingly

01:22:06.659 --> 01:22:11.849
living in a world in which your
products and your designs are

01:22:11.849 --> 01:22:12.849
there.

01:22:12.849 --> 01:22:13.849
Do, can you see how it could be

01:22:13.849 --> 01:22:17.019
concerning in some ways that we
all can't opt out of that world

01:22:17.019 --> 01:22:18.019
at this point?

01:22:18.019 --> 01:22:20.050
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure, I can see why it

01:22:20.050 --> 01:22:21.969
could be concerning to some
customers.

01:22:21.969 --> 01:22:26.159
Our job in building that
technology is to build it in

01:22:26.159 --> 01:22:29.249
such a way that it, that it
takes into account for the

01:22:29.249 --> 01:22:32.889
scenarios that you just talked
about, as best as we possibly

01:22:32.889 --> 01:22:33.889
can.

01:22:33.889 --> 01:22:35.909
You know, the, the reality of it

01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:42.599
is, that world happened way
before Ring or Alexa.

01:22:42.599 --> 01:22:45.909
♪ ♪
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: That's something

01:22:45.909 --> 01:22:49.929
that Bezos himself wrestled with
20 years ago.

01:22:49.929 --> 01:22:52.840
&gt;&gt; I believe that privacy is
going to be one of the prominent

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:53.849
issues of the 21st century.

01:22:53.849 --> 01:22:55.119
The thing is, there are towns

01:22:55.119 --> 01:22:57.550
now in the United States that
have installed security cameras

01:22:57.550 --> 01:23:00.510
on every corner, and their
crime rates decreased by 80%,

01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:03.699
but do you really want cameras
on every corner?

01:23:03.699 --> 01:23:06.649
There are very strange things
that are going to happen over

01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:09.309
the next 100 years with respect
to technology that are going to

01:23:09.309 --> 01:23:13.159
challenge us as a society to
figure out how we want to deal

01:23:13.159 --> 01:23:14.159
with privacy.

01:23:14.159 --> 01:23:15.340
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Decades later,

01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:19.019
Bezos would be at the vanguard
of expanding the use of that

01:23:19.019 --> 01:23:21.769
kind of technology.

01:23:21.769 --> 01:23:22.769
&gt;&gt; Introducing Amazon

01:23:22.769 --> 01:23:24.459
Rekognition Video.

01:23:24.459 --> 01:23:26.139
&gt;&gt; Rekognition allows you to

01:23:26.139 --> 01:23:27.519
pass an image to us.

01:23:27.519 --> 01:23:29.840
You can say, "Do these two faces

01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:30.840
match?"

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:31.840
Which is incredibly useful for

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.449
applications in the security
space.

01:23:34.449 --> 01:23:35.449
You can imagine...

01:23:35.449 --> 01:23:36.449
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: After Amazon rolled

01:23:36.449 --> 01:23:39.989
out a facial recognition tool,
it marketed it to law

01:23:39.989 --> 01:23:41.769
enforcement.

01:23:41.769 --> 01:23:42.789
&gt;&gt; Recognize and track persons

01:23:42.789 --> 01:23:47.129
of interest from a collection
of tens of millions of faces.

01:23:47.129 --> 01:23:50.979
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Police we've spoken
to say it's a valuable tool to

01:23:50.979 --> 01:23:52.560
identify suspects quickly.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:53.800
&gt;&gt; ...appears to be a match, but

01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.669
I'm gonna make sure I look at
them all.

01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:58.340
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And while Amazon
has offered guidelines for how

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.969
it should be used, there are few
laws governing the use of this

01:24:01.969 --> 01:24:02.969
technology.

01:24:02.969 --> 01:24:03.969
&gt;&gt; It returns anybody with

01:24:03.969 --> 01:24:05.519
warrants that look like her.

01:24:05.519 --> 01:24:06.519
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Civil liberties

01:24:06.519 --> 01:24:11.130
advocates have raised concerns,
as have computer scientists, who

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:15.019
worry Amazon has released the
software before it's ready, and

01:24:15.019 --> 01:24:18.439
that police are essentially
field-testing it on the public

01:24:18.439 --> 01:24:20.969
on behalf of the company.

01:24:20.969 --> 01:24:23.479
&gt;&gt; The tools are not what I call

01:24:23.479 --> 01:24:25.159
battle-tested.

01:24:25.159 --> 01:24:27.669
And we still do not understand

01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:31.469
how well they work in the
environments in which they'll be

01:24:31.469 --> 01:24:32.469
applied.

01:24:32.469 --> 01:24:34.279
That's where I see a danger.

01:24:34.279 --> 01:24:37.699
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Anima Anandkumar
was the principal scientist for

01:24:37.699 --> 01:24:40.429
artificial intelligence at
Amazon.

01:24:40.429 --> 01:24:43.690
In her first interview about her
concerns she told us she was

01:24:43.690 --> 01:24:47.380
particularly alarmed by an
M.I.T. study that found the

01:24:47.380 --> 01:24:52.510
software prone to mistakes with
darker-skinned faces.

01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:55.989
Amazon has questioned the
study's methodology.

01:24:55.989 --> 01:24:59.190
&gt;&gt; As a researcher in A.I., I
feel it's my personal

01:24:59.190 --> 01:25:03.690
responsibility to educate the
public of where A.I. truly is

01:25:03.690 --> 01:25:04.789
today, right?

01:25:04.789 --> 01:25:06.389
Because they hear so much of

01:25:06.389 --> 01:25:09.889
A.I. being hyped up, you know,
it's supposed to be magical,

01:25:09.889 --> 01:25:12.310
it's supposed to solve all the
world's problems.

01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:15.500
I see the potential in doing
that, but at the same time we

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:16.790
need a reality check.

01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:19.090
We need to ask, where is A.I.

01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:20.090
today?

01:25:20.090 --> 01:25:21.389
What can it truly do well?

01:25:21.389 --> 01:25:23.780
&gt;&gt; And when it comes to
facial recognition, you don't

01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:25.959
think it's ready for primetime.

01:25:25.959 --> 01:25:26.959
&gt;&gt; I don't think face

01:25:26.959 --> 01:25:30.469
recognition is ready for
primetime in challenging

01:25:30.469 --> 01:25:32.800
applications like law
enforcement.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.889
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Anandkumar and
other scientists have asked

01:25:35.889 --> 01:25:39.469
Amazon to stop selling
Rekognition to law enforcement

01:25:39.469 --> 01:25:42.849
because they say the system's
accuracy is still in question,

01:25:42.849 --> 01:25:47.469
and there are no clear
regulations about how it's used.

01:25:47.469 --> 01:25:49.370
We asked Andy Jassy about it.

01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:52.929
&gt;&gt; I have a different view, and

01:25:52.929 --> 01:25:53.929
we've spent...

01:25:53.929 --> 01:25:54.929
We've had the facial

01:25:54.929 --> 01:25:58.349
recognition technology out for
use for over two-and-a-half

01:25:58.349 --> 01:25:59.400
years now.

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:00.659
And in those two-and-a-half

01:26:00.659 --> 01:26:03.309
years, we've never had any
reported misuse of law

01:26:03.309 --> 01:26:06.079
enforcement using the facial
recognition technology and, you

01:26:06.079 --> 01:26:08.840
know, I think a lot of societal
good is already being done with

01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:10.219
facial recognition technology.

01:26:10.219 --> 01:26:12.269
Already, you've seen hundreds of

01:26:12.269 --> 01:26:15.269
missing kids reunited with their
parents, and hundreds of human

01:26:15.269 --> 01:26:19.469
trafficking victims saved, and
all kinds of security and

01:26:19.469 --> 01:26:22.219
identity and education uses, so
there's a lot of good that's

01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:23.659
been done with it.

01:26:23.659 --> 01:26:25.309
But I also understand that it

01:26:25.309 --> 01:26:26.309
could be misused.

01:26:26.309 --> 01:26:27.472
And I think at the end of the

01:26:27.472 --> 01:26:29.769
day with any technology, whether
you're talking about facial

01:26:29.769 --> 01:26:32.959
recognition technology or
anything else, the people that

01:26:32.959 --> 01:26:36.030
use the technology have to be
responsible for it, and if they

01:26:36.030 --> 01:26:38.379
use it irresponsibly, they have
to be held accountable.

01:26:38.379 --> 01:26:40.300
&gt;&gt; There's been all
sorts of problems with policing

01:26:40.300 --> 01:26:41.300
in this country.

01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.320
So why allow police departments

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.530
to experiment?

01:26:43.530 --> 01:26:45.150
&gt;&gt; We believe that governments

01:26:45.150 --> 01:26:47.749
and the organizations that are
charged with keeping our

01:26:47.749 --> 01:26:51.110
communities safe have to have
access to the most

01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:53.719
sophisticated, modern
technology that exists.

01:26:53.719 --> 01:26:55.800
We don't have a large number of
police departments that are

01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:58.619
using our facial recognition
technology, and as I said,

01:26:58.619 --> 01:27:01.369
we've never received any
complaints of misuse.

01:27:01.369 --> 01:27:04.099
Let's see if somehow they abuse
the technology.

01:27:04.099 --> 01:27:07.979
They haven't done that, and to
assume that they're gonna do it

01:27:07.979 --> 01:27:09.919
and therefore you shouldn't
allow them to have access to the

01:27:09.919 --> 01:27:12.059
most sophisticated technology
out there, doesn't feel like the

01:27:12.059 --> 01:27:13.559
right balance to me.

01:27:13.559 --> 01:27:14.559
&gt;&gt; It's been difficult

01:27:14.559 --> 01:27:17.459
to even know how many police
departments are using the facial

01:27:17.459 --> 01:27:20.769
recognition technology, and
there's no public auditing to

01:27:20.769 --> 01:27:23.849
know whether there are
complaints about abuse.

01:27:23.849 --> 01:27:25.510
How would the public ever know?

01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:28.209
&gt;&gt; You know, again, I don't

01:27:28.209 --> 01:27:31.360
think we know the total number
of police departments that are

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.789
using facial recognition
technology.

01:27:33.789 --> 01:27:39.090
I mean, there's, you can use any
number-- we have 165 services in

01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:41.649
our technology infrastructure
platform, and you can use them

01:27:41.649 --> 01:27:44.769
in whatever conjunction, any
combination that you want.

01:27:44.769 --> 01:27:49.399
We know of some, and the vast
majority of those that are using

01:27:49.399 --> 01:27:52.690
it are using it according to the
guidance that we've prescribed.

01:27:52.690 --> 01:27:55.519
And when they're not, we have
conversations, and if we find

01:27:55.519 --> 01:27:57.499
that they're using it in some
irresponsible way, we won't

01:27:57.499 --> 01:28:01.260
allow them to use the service
and the platform.

01:28:01.260 --> 01:28:03.780
♪ ♪
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Andy Jassy and Jeff

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:06.349
Bezos have said they want
governments to hurry up and

01:28:06.349 --> 01:28:10.579
regulate how law enforcement can
use facial recognition.

01:28:10.579 --> 01:28:14.570
But in the meantime, Amazon has
forged ahead, and has even

01:28:14.570 --> 01:28:17.739
discussed its services with
Immigration and Customs

01:28:17.739 --> 01:28:18.739
Enforcement.

01:28:18.739 --> 01:28:19.739
&gt;&gt; At Amazon Web Services...

01:28:19.739 --> 01:28:21.980
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: And the U.S.
military.

01:28:21.980 --> 01:28:25.860
&gt;&gt; ...partner community to
deliver for our warfighters and

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:29.260
defense leaders for when it
matters most.

01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:31.590
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Bezos himself has
made it clear that he sees

01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:35.729
Amazon playing a critical role
in national security, as well as

01:28:35.729 --> 01:28:36.729
in commerce.

01:28:36.729 --> 01:28:37.749
&gt;&gt; We are going to continue to

01:28:37.749 --> 01:28:41.090
support the D.O.D., and I think
we should.

01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:44.530
And if big tech companies are
gonna turn their back on the

01:28:44.530 --> 01:28:48.489
U.S. Department of Defense, this
country is gonna be in trouble.

01:28:48.489 --> 01:28:51.639
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: As Amazon has
revolutionized one industry

01:28:51.639 --> 01:28:56.070
after another, Jeff Bezos's
reputation has grown to mythic

01:28:56.070 --> 01:28:57.110
proportions.

01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:59.260
&gt;&gt; You've called what Jeff Bezos

01:28:59.260 --> 01:29:00.730
has built a miracle.

01:29:00.730 --> 01:29:01.730
&gt;&gt; Absolute miracle.

01:29:01.730 --> 01:29:03.689
I wish I could give him a blood
test or something so I could

01:29:03.689 --> 01:29:04.709
pick it out, but...

01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:05.709
&gt;&gt; You want to clone him?

01:29:05.709 --> 01:29:09.769
&gt;&gt; No, I want a transfusion,
actually.

01:29:09.769 --> 01:29:12.169
&gt;&gt; Amazon is now worth $1
trillion...

01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:15.840

moves the markets.

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:18.289
&gt;&gt; Amazon Advertising is just on
fire.

01:29:18.289 --> 01:29:21.010
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Starting a digital
advertising business to rival

01:29:21.010 --> 01:29:22.949
Facebook and Google.

01:29:22.949 --> 01:29:24.829
&gt;&gt; Some breaking news on Whole

01:29:24.829 --> 01:29:25.829
Foods...

01:29:25.829 --> 01:29:26.829
&gt;&gt; Holy cow.

01:29:26.829 --> 01:29:27.829
&gt;&gt; Jim, I heard you gasp just
now.

01:29:27.829 --> 01:29:28.829
&gt;&gt; Holy cow, this is such a
game-changer.

01:29:28.829 --> 01:29:31.949
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Buying the grocery
chain Whole Foods.

01:29:31.949 --> 01:29:35.559
&gt;&gt; In a record-breaking deal,
Amazon is buying Whole Foods for

01:29:35.559 --> 01:29:37.269
$13.7 billion.

01:29:37.269 --> 01:29:38.669
&gt;&gt; The day the acquisition was

01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:41.170
announced, the nation's largest
grocery company lost billions of

01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:46.449
dollars because Amazon acquired
a company one-12th the size.

01:29:46.449 --> 01:29:48.780
&gt;&gt; Everybody thinks Bezos is the
smartest person in the world and

01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:50.300
he's gonna come and crush me.

01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:51.800
&gt;&gt; When Amazon announced the

01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.239
acquisition of Pill Pack...

01:29:53.239 --> 01:29:54.239
&gt;&gt; News of the deal sent

01:29:54.239 --> 01:29:55.789
shockwaves through an
industry...

01:29:55.789 --> 01:29:58.860
&gt;&gt; The retail pharmacy sector
shed billions of dollars.

01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:02.059
&gt;&gt; Look at this story-- three
titans of industry...

01:30:02.059 --> 01:30:05.079
&gt;&gt; When Amazon was mentioned in
a press release with Berkshire

01:30:05.079 --> 01:30:07.639
Hathaway and JP Morgan saying
they were looking at healthcare

01:30:07.639 --> 01:30:10.000
costs-- no detail in what that
meant...

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.880
&gt;&gt; Healthcare companies are
panicked about Amazon's

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.119
forthcoming entry into the
healthcare market.

01:30:14.119 --> 01:30:15.950
&gt;&gt; On the opening bell the
next morning, the healthcare

01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:18.699
industry's largest players shed
billions of dollars.

01:30:18.699 --> 01:30:21.199
&gt;&gt; And insurance stocks are down
after Amazon announced a

01:30:21.199 --> 01:30:24.179
healthcare partnership with
Berkshire Hathaway and JP Morgan

01:30:24.179 --> 01:30:25.179
Chase.

01:30:25.179 --> 01:30:26.460
&gt;&gt; Bezos basically wants to own

01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:28.379
the whole economy, right?

01:30:28.379 --> 01:30:29.449
&gt;&gt; You think he will.

01:30:29.449 --> 01:30:30.449
&gt;&gt; I kind of think he will.

01:30:30.449 --> 01:30:31.680
I kinda think that in, like, ten

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:34.129
years Jeff Bezos owns every
single thing there is.

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:36.949
&gt;&gt; So Amazon has these Darth
Vader-like abilities to just

01:30:36.949 --> 01:30:40.649
look at a sector and begin
choking it of oxygen without

01:30:40.649 --> 01:30:41.820
even touching it.

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:42.820
Amazon can begin beating

01:30:42.820 --> 01:30:45.729
competitors without even
competing.

01:30:45.729 --> 01:30:48.000
&gt;&gt; You actually think
that Amazon is having a negative

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:52.019
effect on competition in the
innovation economy right now?

01:30:52.019 --> 01:30:54.159
&gt;&gt; I think it's a mixed bag, I
think that you could argue, and

01:30:54.159 --> 01:30:56.969
there's evidence that they have
inspired innovation in certain

01:30:56.969 --> 01:30:57.969
sectors.

01:30:57.969 --> 01:30:58.969
But I think there's a lot of

01:30:58.969 --> 01:31:00.729
small companies that aren't
being formed, because if you go

01:31:00.729 --> 01:31:03.360
in to try and raise money for
an e-commerce company, it's,

01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:04.999
"Well, how are we going to
compete against Amazon?"

01:31:04.999 --> 01:31:09.519
And I say, "Well, the answer
can be summarized in one word:

01:31:09.519 --> 01:31:10.519
impossible."

01:31:10.519 --> 01:31:12.760
&gt;&gt; All right, let's move some

01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:13.760
earth.

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:14.760
&gt;&gt; Every single area that he

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:20.090
enters into, he manages to
succeed in a fairly major way.

01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:23.849
(crowd cheering)
&gt;&gt; We've had another great Prime

01:31:23.849 --> 01:31:24.849
Day.

01:31:24.849 --> 01:31:25.849
&gt;&gt; We've never seen anything

01:31:25.849 --> 01:31:31.079
like a company that is so
integrated into the fabric of

01:31:31.079 --> 01:31:34.090
existence, so, you know, at a
certain point, it becomes

01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:35.679
unavoidable.

01:31:35.679 --> 01:31:37.030
&gt;&gt; Amazon just yesterday said...

01:31:37.030 --> 01:31:40.380

And it does that in a very

01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:42.800
direct way, because when
people... if you look at Prime

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:47.090
members, they, they buy more on
Amazon than non-Prime members,

01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:49.630
and one of the reasons they do
that is, once they've paid their

01:32:49.630 --> 01:32:51.731
annual fee, they're looking
around to see, "How can I get

01:32:51.731 --> 01:32:53.679
more value out of the program?"

01:32:53.679 --> 01:32:55.610

turned out not to be enough to

decided, that's fine, we can go

So we decided... we decided it's
fine, we'll go elsewhere.

has corrupted our ability to win
this contract."

by Amazon and the other tech
giants.

01:45:22.530 --> 01:45:25.039
&gt;&gt; Given your experience, do you
agree with Amazon's statements

01:45:25.039 --> 01:45:28.269
suggesting that it seeks to act
in the best interest of

01:45:28.269 --> 01:45:29.489
independent sellers?

01:45:29.489 --> 01:45:30.849
&gt;&gt; I disagree with that.

01:45:30.849 --> 01:45:33.440
We get, I don't know, what I
might call bullying with a

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.440
smile.

01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:35.440
&gt;&gt; We were able to get several

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.400
C.E.Os. to come to a public
hearing.

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:43.380
That required tremendous courage
because there's a real potential

01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:47.129
for economic retaliation for
their sharing that.

01:45:47.129 --> 01:45:49.369
&gt;&gt; We don't have the resources
to fight Amazon.

01:45:49.369 --> 01:45:52.349

01:45:53.349 --> 01:45:55.719
investigation thus far, and
you've had several public

01:45:55.719 --> 01:45:59.619
hearings, have you seen any
evidence of anti-competitive

01:45:59.619 --> 01:46:01.309
behavior by Amazon?

01:46:01.309 --> 01:46:03.059
&gt;&gt; Um, we have seen evidence of

01:46:03.059 --> 01:46:07.320
anti-competitive behavior by all
of the large platforms as a

01:46:07.320 --> 01:46:08.849
result of their market
dominance.

01:46:08.849 --> 01:46:11.829
But it sort of doesn't fall on
the companies to fix this

01:46:11.829 --> 01:46:12.829
problem.

01:46:12.829 --> 01:46:13.829
It falls on us.

01:47:44.269 --> 01:47:48.959
And, you know, I, I wish it
weren't so, and I... you know,

01:47:48.959 --> 01:47:51.329
and I... but I had something to
do with bringing it into

01:47:51.329 --> 01:47:53.849
existence, so, it's partly on
me.

01:47:53.849 --> 01:47:55.709
&gt;&gt; And, I mean, isn't...

01:47:55.709 --> 01:47:57.439
Isn't this just capitalism?

01:47:57.439 --> 01:48:00.110
Isn't this just a company doing
what a company does?

01:48:00.110 --> 01:48:01.110
&gt;&gt; Yes.

01:48:01.110 --> 01:48:02.760
Yes, it is, um, and I think

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:07.840
they're doing what the business
schools teach people to do, and

01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:12.019
they're doing it aggressively
and skillfully and with great

01:48:12.019 --> 01:48:13.439
intelligence.

01:48:13.439 --> 01:48:14.820
And they will continue to do

01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:19.289
that unless they're constrained
by other forces in society.

01:48:19.289 --> 01:48:22.290
&gt;&gt; There are proposals
out there to break up Amazon.

01:48:22.290 --> 01:48:25.669
Is that something you'd promote,
the idea of breaking them up?

01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:28.820
&gt;&gt; Um, I think that they're now
at the scale where that could

01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:31.519
potentially make sense.

01:48:31.519 --> 01:48:33.260
&gt;&gt; How do you and Jeff

01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:36.229
and others at the senior
leadership level think about the

01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:38.299
call to break you guys up?

01:48:38.299 --> 01:48:40.590
&gt;&gt; We don't think about it very,

01:48:40.590 --> 01:48:41.590
very deeply.

01:48:41.590 --> 01:48:42.639
You know, I've been at Amazon

01:48:42.639 --> 01:48:45.430
now for 22-and-a-half years,
and I always remember one of

01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:48.070
the first things I heard Jeff
Bezos say back when we could

01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:50.179
fit the whole company in just
one conference room for an

01:48:50.179 --> 01:48:51.179
all-hands meeting.

01:48:51.179 --> 01:48:52.439
He said, "I would not go to bed

01:48:52.439 --> 01:48:55.170
at night fearing your
competitors or fearing any

01:48:55.170 --> 01:48:56.219
external issues.

01:48:56.219 --> 01:48:57.300
I would go to bed at night

01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:59.639
fearing whether you're doing
right by your customers."

01:48:59.639 --> 01:49:01.849
And that really is a credo that
we live here and it's what we

01:49:01.849 --> 01:49:03.330
spend most of our time thinking
about.

01:49:03.330 --> 01:49:08.080
&gt;&gt; Well, I, I understand that
we're big, and that, that we

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:11.781
deserve scrutiny, and I think
everything that's... that's

01:49:11.781 --> 01:49:15.179
large in the economy and in
society should deserve scrutiny.

01:49:15.179 --> 01:49:17.510
The problem is, when you think
about us, we're in a lot of

01:49:17.510 --> 01:49:18.709
verticals, yes.

01:49:18.709 --> 01:49:20.969
There's... there's video, and

01:49:20.969 --> 01:49:24.609
there's commerce, and there's,
you know, there's web services--

01:49:24.609 --> 01:49:25.949
there are all these things.

01:49:25.949 --> 01:49:28.270
But in every one of them, we

01:49:28.270 --> 01:49:31.860
have intense competition, and I
do understand why, when you're

01:49:31.860 --> 01:49:35.739
in a lot of them, it can seem
like we're everywhere, but the

01:49:35.739 --> 01:49:36.739

01:49:36.739 --> 01:49:37.739
If we were everywhere, that

01:49:37.739 --> 01:49:39.659
means we're talking about the
global economy, not just global

01:49:39.659 --> 01:49:45.409
retail-- it's so vast, we're
just, you know, we're a speck.
