Michael Franzese: If a mob boss was ever

00:00:03.626 --> 00:00:05.167
visiting a psychiatrist,

00:00:05.167 --> 00:00:07.380
he'd be in the trunk of his
car by the end of the week.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:08.800
Along with the psychiatrist.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:09.970
That would never happen.

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:11.680
My name is Michael Franzese,

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.180
and I was a former capo in
the Colombo crime family,

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.120
one of the five New York
Mafia La Cosa Nostra families.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.100
I'm now residing in the Los Angeles area,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.491
and I'm here to be a movie critic.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.112
This would never happen.

00:00:34.112 --> 00:00:36.304
First of all, it's too much
work involved in this, you know?

00:00:36.304 --> 00:00:37.976
You've got so many guys.

00:00:37.976 --> 00:00:39.800
Usually mob hits are not done like that.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.840
I mean, they're normally
done at close range,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.420
small-caliber guns and
shotguns being used.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.950
I never saw anything like this before.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.720
I know back in the '20s
they used machine guns.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.740
"Tommy guns" was the term back then.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.007
But, to me, this scene
seems to be unrealistic.

00:00:58.242 --> 00:01:02.020
Jelly: Oh. Oh,
che stai facendo?

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.860
Dr. Sobel: Hey, Easter weekend, eh?

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.970
Franzese: There was
always a guy of that size.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.281
In every crew and every
family there was always

00:01:09.281 --> 00:01:11.090
somebody that big that was around.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.540
Italians eat a lot, and
some of them get real big.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.480
You know, I doubt you'd
ever see this many people.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.250
The last time something like this occurred

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.240
was Appalachia, back in New York,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.150
when guys from all over
the country came in.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.390
I think they probably modeled
this scene after that.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.823
You know, ever since law enforcement

00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:27.889
invaded that meeting,

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:29.050
it never happened again.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.708
And that I know for a fact.

00:01:34.043 --> 00:01:36.359
Michael: We're both part
of the same hypocrisy.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.668
But never think it applies to my family.

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:44.952
Pat: All right. All right.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.480
Some people have to play little games.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.860
Franzese: We infiltrated
society on every level,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.830
from the guy on the street,
the numbers business,

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.190
right up to the White House.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.840
And you would never see a
politician talk to us like that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.758
because most of them we supported.

00:02:00.758 --> 00:02:02.083
And I'm wondering if I would've

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:03.608
been able to stay calm.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.244
Which was the right thing to do.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.417
Michael: I know it was you, Fredo.

00:02:10.417 --> 00:02:11.359
Franzese: This kiss of death,

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.860
that was a Sicilian thing, I believe,

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.950
and certainly something that
might've happened in Italy.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.565
This is a scene that, you know,

00:02:18.565 --> 00:02:21.920
that became close to me
because I had a brother,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.280
I have a brother that
actually turned informant.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.330
Testified against my dad, and
actually tried to hurt me,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.370
and went into the Witness
Protection Program.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.280
Haven't seen him in 10 years.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.630
It's very hard to bear, hard to deal with.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.280
Since I walked away from that life

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.440
and basically, you know, violated my oath

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.740
just by walking away,

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.981
not that I ever hurt anybody,

00:02:40.981 --> 00:02:43.110
but just by walking away,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.780
contract on my life, the whole bit.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.470
Did you ever worry about your family?

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.740
And my answer is no.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.440
We didn't go after law enforcement.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.320
We didn't bother anybody's
family, that was hands off.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.370
In Italy, you know,

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.210
they go after your
family, law enforcement,

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.651
I mean, you know, there's no rules

00:02:57.651 --> 00:02:59.017
when it comes to stuff like that.

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:03.953
Ace: Can you do it with your left hand?

00:03:03.953 --> 00:03:06.430
Signaller: Well, I've never tried.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.480
Ace: So you're a righty?

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.538
Signaller: Yeah.

00:03:13.087 --> 00:03:15.960
Franzese: I can tell you this
scene is not unrealistic,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.810
because, you know, in a mob-run casino,

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.450
we certainly wouldn't have tolerated

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.270
anybody cheating like that.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.900
So it could've been this, I mean,

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.010
you break somebody's legs,
put them in a hospital.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.730
Even though this is Lefty Rosenthal,

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.400
he wasn't a made member,
but he was an associate,

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:32.840
but he dressed the part.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.320
De Niro and Gotti, and,
you know, even myself,

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.600
we dressed up pretty good.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.660
At every weekend, I was
at weddings and funerals.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.100
Half the time I didn't know who died

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.080
or who was getting married,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.770
but we had to go as a matter of respect.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.420
So we had to dress up quite a bit.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.528
I mean, I probably had
50 suits at that time.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.280
Donnie: Like Raquel Welch
is one great piece of ass,

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.830
forget about it.

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:57.371
But then, if you disagree,
like a Lincoln is better

00:03:57.371 --> 00:03:59.252
than a Cadillac, forget about it.

00:03:59.252 --> 00:04:00.320
Franzese: All right,
I gotta tell you this.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.810
This is probably one of
the most realistic scenes

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.260
in all of mob moviedom.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.540
You know, it's funny. I'm a speaker now,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.000
and every time I say, "fuggedaboutit,"

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.560
which I say by habit,
people laugh, you know.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.450
This scene made that word famous.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.790
It applies to everything.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.110
Just like the sit-down.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.980
Anytime you had any kind of meeting,

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.500
it was always at a sit-down.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.310
Had a sit-down, and discuss, you know,

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:21.700
a life-and-death matter.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.300
We had a sit-down just to have dinner.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.016
Everything was done at a sit-down.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.758
Chili: You're an entry
in my book, that's all.

00:04:29.758 --> 00:04:32.073
You're just a guy who owes me money.

00:04:32.073 --> 00:04:33.480
Martin: All right.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.465
How about this?

00:04:37.022 --> 00:04:38.488
[Franzese laughs]

00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:40.396
Franzese: It's, No. 1, it's the perception

00:04:40.396 --> 00:04:43.350
that this person is a serious guy,

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.820
that can, you know, maybe hurt you,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.110
and that intensifies that look.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.540
'Cause I know a lot of times, you know,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.627
people said, "Hey, all you've
got to do is look at somebody,

00:04:51.627 --> 00:04:52.610
and they get nervous."

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.550
Travolta, I thought, killed this role.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.070
You know, a lot of mob guys, I mean,

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.610
myself being one of them, got
involved in entertainment.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.130
Travolta took it to another level,

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.640
wanting to be a director
and whatever it was.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:04.750
We were more or less behind
the scenes, you know,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.220
financing some of these things,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.584
getting to know some of the people,

00:05:07.584 --> 00:05:09.820
some of the perks involved with it.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.507
Really, that was it.

00:05:16.183 --> 00:05:17.840
Henry: Then you had Nicky Eyes...

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.700
Nicky: What's up, guy?

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.950
Henry: And Mikey Franzese.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.267
Mikey: I saw that guy,
yeah, I wanna see him.

00:05:22.267 --> 00:05:24.360
Franzese: Yeah, no, I don't
think he really looked like me.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.870
I'll be honest with you,
I was in the theater.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.328
I had just gotten out of prison,

00:05:28.328 --> 00:05:30.640
and I went to see this with my wife.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.577
And after a few minutes she
looked at me and she said,

00:05:32.577 --> 00:05:34.207
you know: "Is this
really what you guys did?

00:05:34.207 --> 00:05:35.730
Is that what your life was all about?"

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.307
And I said: "Honey, c'mon, it's a movie.

00:05:37.307 --> 00:05:38.260
They make things up."

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.190
You know, "Don't pay attention."

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.706
No sooner do I say that

00:05:41.706 --> 00:05:43.290
than they introduce my character,

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.123
and she looks at me,

00:05:44.123 --> 00:05:45.320
and I say, "C'mon, we gotta go."

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.880
And I walked out, 'cause I
didn't know why they put me in.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:49.150
It was a different crew.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:49.983
Henry: Here's Frankie the Wop.

00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:52.076
Frankie: Listen, are you out of trouble?

00:05:52.076 --> 00:05:53.910
Henry: Freddie No Nose.
Freddie: Hey, how're ya doing?

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.860
Franzese: People say,
"Well, how did you come up

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.260
with those nicknames?" You know, like,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.980
there was a guy that
we called Chicken Head.

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.260
And the reason we called him that

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:03.270
because he used to shoot
the head off of chickens

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.870
when he was practicing his marksmanship.

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:07.557
You know, we had Benny Eggs.

00:06:07.557 --> 00:06:08.790
"Well, why'd you call him Benny Eggs?"

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.650
Well, he liked eggs.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.510
He ate them all the time.

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.010
So we weren't really
original with the names.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.327
We had Fat Tony Salerno.

00:06:14.327 --> 00:06:15.510
"Why'd you call him Fat Tony?"

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:16.563
Well, he was fat.

00:06:16.563 --> 00:06:17.550
Tommy: What do you mean, funny?

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:19.108
Funny how? How am I funny?

00:06:21.288 --> 00:06:22.200
Henry: Just...

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.000
Franzese: You know, they
made Henry out to be

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.508
a lot more

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:28.820
significant in the life
than he really was.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.190
He was just a lost soul.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.680
He always had a drug
problem, alcohol problem.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.554
For me, Joe Pesci is the best
portrayer of any mob guy.

00:06:37.554 --> 00:06:39.000
You know, he was around street guys,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.110
he knew guys out on the street.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.376
And he just had it down so perfectly.

00:06:45.825 --> 00:06:48.050
Police: Hey, put your eyes up.

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:52.043
Franzese: You know, most
of the local police,

00:06:52.043 --> 00:06:53.185
they didn't bother us.

00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:55.410
You know, it was really
the FBI and, you know,

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:58.330
investigative agencies like
that, especially the feds.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.438
I doubt if anybody,

00:07:00.438 --> 00:07:02.438
even though he was protecting his son,

00:07:02.438 --> 00:07:04.680
would ever come right out front like that

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.680
and look to put people on
front street, so to speak.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.670
Front street, in other words,

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:10.317
you're telling the police that, you know,

00:07:10.317 --> 00:07:12.582
one of these guys might be
guilty of doing something.

00:07:12.582 --> 00:07:15.210
So you're actually,
you know, in mob terms,

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:16.950
you're becoming a rat or a snitch.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:19.233
And, you know, you pay a price for that.

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:24.860
Charlie: He has about $30.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.560
It's all he's got on him, Michael.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:30.220
Michael: Where's the rest?

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.300
Charlie: Yeah, where's the rest?

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.550
Johnny Boy: Well, I bought
a few rounds of drinks

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:34.910
over here while I was waiting.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:37.070
Franzese: You know, this
whole shylocking scene,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:38.280
you know, very accurate.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.410
Shylocking, loan sharking, you know,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.610
basically lending money at usurious rates.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.387
And everybody that was in that life

00:07:45.387 --> 00:07:47.840
was in that business. That had any money.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.100
You know, he plays these roles good.

00:07:49.100 --> 00:07:51.420
I think, today, you know,
the way De Niro's acting,

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.760
he thinks he really is a
mob guy, you know. [laughs]

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:56.685
It's kinda permeated his
whole being and his character.

00:08:01.233 --> 00:08:03.500
Marge: Homer, where'd you get that truck?

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.158
Homer: Uh...it fell off a truck.

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.203
You know, a truck truck.

00:08:11.864 --> 00:08:13.310
Franzese: A lot of
things fell off a truck.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.090
I mean, that was the
expression that we used.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.230
Whether it be clothing, a suit, you know,

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:19.940
electronics, cars, whatever.

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.030
You know, hijacking was a
big thing back in the day,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.010
no question about it.

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.750
And there was some guys that
were professional hijackers.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.950
Today, it's very difficult,
but it was a lot easier

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.950
to change the serial numbers

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.691
and make a new car out of it,

00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:34.456
and nobody could ever find it, so.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.777
Hoffa: Let's get outta
here, Frankie, c'mon.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:42.200
Franzese: You know, I'm a little bit jaded

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.970
when I look at this film,

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.553
only because I know

00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:48.203
that the Sheeran story is fiction.

00:08:48.203 --> 00:08:50.180
I mean, he didn't kill Hoffa.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:51.780
I didn't know Jimmy Hoffa personally,

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:53.460
but it was during my time.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:55.348
But I do have insight into,

00:08:55.348 --> 00:08:57.660
you know, what really happened there.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.870
He was a hot-headed guy,

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:01.030
and he was one of the most powerful guys

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.420
in the country at that point.

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.410
Remember this, you control the teamsters,

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:08.110
in a big way, you control the country.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:10.820
You know, No. 1, you
got zillions of dollars

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.840
in your pension funds.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.684
You call a strike as a teamster, you know,

00:09:13.684 --> 00:09:15.550
you've got 2 1/2 million people stopping,

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:17.680
nothing gets delivered, everything stops,

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.005
and that's a tremendous amount of power.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.200
The Joey Gallo killing, that was,

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.610
'cause I know, you know, for
a fact, what happened there.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.170
Like I said, that was our time.

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:31.690
And, you know, I was
in the middle of that.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.170
I wasn't the shooter, don't get me wrong,

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:34.770
but I knew it was our family.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.745
For him to be so, you know,

00:09:36.745 --> 00:09:39.980
outspoken about doing
that, it was just so wrong.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.240
I mean, the scene was accurate.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.810
I mean, he did get killed in that way.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:45.090
He did get out into the street,
and they did get him there,

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.490
and his family was there, the whole thing.

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:49.365
But Sheeran wasn't the shooter.

00:09:52.277 --> 00:09:54.390
Reporter: You are in effect
the mayor of Chicago,

00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:57.360
you've not simply been
appointed to that position.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.280
Franzese: I mean, he
certainly looked the part.

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.503
You know, everybody looks
at Capone like he was

00:10:01.503 --> 00:10:02.740
a 40, 50-year-old guy.

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:04.110
He was, like, 29 years old.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.070
He was in his 30s when
he passed away, I think.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.760
You know, Capone was bigger
than life in the movies.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.483
He wasn't bigger than life with us.

00:10:10.483 --> 00:10:12.510
I mean, nobody really regarded him.

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.624
You know, even my father said, you know:

00:10:14.624 --> 00:10:15.717
"We chased him out of Brooklyn.

00:10:15.717 --> 00:10:17.220
He went to Chicago."

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.661
And my father's 103,

00:10:19.661 --> 00:10:21.469
so he was around all of these guys.

00:10:21.469 --> 00:10:23.640
You know, unfortunately, I
get asked about all the time

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.250
is about murder in that life.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.000
And I will tell you this.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.670
Murder was taken very seriously, OK?

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:31.550
It can only be approved by the boss.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.860
So I've been very, very
fortunate to be here,

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.248
where I am now, and not dead or in prison,

00:10:36.248 --> 00:10:38.523
like just about all of my associates.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:46.970
If a mob boss was ever
visiting a psychiatrist,

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:49.200
he'd be in the trunk of his
car by the end of the week,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.600
along with the psychiatrist.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.600
That would never happen.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.433
Crowd: Don't do it.

00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:54.266
No, no, no!

00:10:54.266 --> 00:10:55.491
Don't do it!
My arm!

00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.900
Franzese: There's no way in the world

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.190
if a mob boss hit anybody

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:02.970
that that guy would come back at him.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:03.803
No way.

00:11:03.803 --> 00:11:05.040
Especially in front of audience.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.050
If he did,

00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.700
you don't ever raise
your hand to a made guy.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.223
No matter who you are, you raise your hand

00:11:10.223 --> 00:11:12.050
to a made guy, you're dead,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:14.670
and so, and they know that.

00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:17.260
So this is not a realistic scene.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:20.110
So David Chase gets in
touch with me through

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.587
a friend of mine, Jack
Gilardi at ICM, and he says:

00:11:22.587 --> 00:11:24.787
"Look, I'm doing this series for Fox.

00:11:24.787 --> 00:11:27.690
And we want you to be
involved as a consultant."

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:30.270
And I said, "You know, I'm on
parole and all this stuff."

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.550
So I turned it down.

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.200
That's how smart I am, right?

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.033
"The Sopranos."

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:37.590
But I always wondered why he contacted me.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.800
In my house, back in the
'60s when it was being built,

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.810
the government, the FBI,
installed a bugging device.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.485
They had it in the kitchen of our house,

00:11:45.485 --> 00:11:46.510
and they picked up a lot of the

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.637
conversation on a daily basis.

00:11:48.637 --> 00:11:50.103
And I am telling you

00:11:50.103 --> 00:11:52.136
that Tony Soprano's mother

00:11:52.136 --> 00:11:54.330
was so much like my mother.

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.410
You know, maybe he got the
Freedom of Information Act,

00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.180
maybe he did something, but he got a hold

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.510
of that surveillance tapes,

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.713
and he patterned that woman

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.520
on my mother.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.420
And I said, I would, I tell you,

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.640
I would almost stake my life.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.800
I've never had a chance
to talk to him about it.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.110
Carmine: One other thing, though.

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:14.290
John said he went to a
cookout at your house.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:15.483
Tony: Yeah.

00:12:15.483 --> 00:12:17.780
Carmine: A don doesn't wear shorts.

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.544
Franzese: That's not true at all.

00:12:19.544 --> 00:12:21.413
I mean, I saw...[scoffs]

00:12:21.413 --> 00:12:24.260
you know, on a hot summer
day in Harlem, you know,

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.310
guys would sit out in front
of their social clubs,

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:27.200
and they'd be in shorts.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.033
Even the boss.

00:12:28.033 --> 00:12:30.783
I mean, you know, that's not true.

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.410
I mean, you go on a
boat, you're in shorts.

00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:33.843
Or maybe somebody told them that

00:12:33.843 --> 00:12:35.915
that, you know, didn't know
what they were talking about.

00:12:35.915 --> 00:12:37.016
But that's not true.
