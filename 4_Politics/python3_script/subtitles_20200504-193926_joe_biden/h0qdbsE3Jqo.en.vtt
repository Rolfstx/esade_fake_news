00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.916
NC: So, going back to this interested Alien,

00:00:02.916 --> 00:00:09.948
what he sees is that this remarkable species developed higher intelligence,

00:00:09.948 --> 00:00:16.873
and it is now using it in order to destroy itself, and is on the verge of destruction.

00:00:16.873 --> 00:00:22.087
And they might watch something like the current electoral campaign,

00:00:22.087 --> 00:00:24.469
everyone’s paying attention to it,

00:00:24.469 --> 00:00:28.916
and notice a very curious fact: none of this is being discussed.

00:00:28.916 --> 00:00:35.884
What’s being discussed is tweets at 3 a.m., you know,

00:00:35.884 --> 00:00:42.816
various kinds of vulgarity, anything, but serious problems.

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.595
TJ: It’s a depressing topic.

00:00:44.595 --> 00:00:51.466
But maybe the Alien would agree that ignorance is bliss? Ignorance is bliss?

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:55.345
NC: For a short time. Until it hits.

00:00:58.693 --> 00:01:02.426
TJ: All right, Young &amp;amp; Naïve, we are … in Boston, are we in Boston?

00:01:02.426 --> 00:01:03.982
NC: No, we are in Cambridge.

00:01:03.982 --> 00:01:04.971
TJ: Is that different?

00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:05.866
NC: Across the river.

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:07.474
TJ: OK. And who are you?

00:01:07.474 --> 00:01:16.832
NC: I’m Noam Chomsky, I have been at MIT, where we now are, for 65 years, I’m now a retired professor.

00:01:16.832 --> 00:01:18.278
TJ: And you still have an office.

00:01:18.278 --> 00:01:20.318
NC: I still have an office. They’re nice to me.

00:01:20.318 --> 00:01:22.351
TJ: Why would they be nice?

00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:24.446
NC: Maybe because they like me.

00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:29.252
TJ: I heard you are a little famous … are you still famous?

00:01:29.252 --> 00:01:32.043
NC: That’s for other people to decide.

00:01:32.043 --> 00:01:41.987
TJ: I read a lot about you, and I want to start with one point you always make in your books,

00:01:41.987 --> 00:01:44.434
about the “Alien Perspective”.

00:01:44.434 --> 00:01:51.814
Could you … let’s pretend you are an alien and watch – on Earth.

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:56.092
What are you witnessing, like, in terms of politics?

00:01:56.092 --> 00:02:04.412
NC: Well, if you are an alien with a kind of a long stretch of understanding,

00:02:04.412 --> 00:02:07.408
maybe hundreds of thousands of years,

00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:11.539
and you’re watching what’s going on on Earth, you’d be pretty surprised.

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:12.470
TJ: Why?

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.922
NC: About two hundred thousand years ago,

00:02:15.922 --> 00:02:20.198
a new species appeared on Earth, humans,

00:02:20.198 --> 00:02:25.860
radically different from all others, as we can tell by just looking around.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.767
For a long time they kind of just wandered around the Earth,

00:02:30.767 --> 00:02:36.738
called hunter/gatherers, hunting, picking fruit and things like that.

00:02:36.738 --> 00:02:41.138
But about a ten thousand years ago, they underwent a big change.

00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:44.606
They started settled agriculture, they started building cities,

00:02:44.606 --> 00:02:51.129
started expanding, started having wars, developed complex cultures …

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:57.872
And during the last ten thousand years, they have expanded all over the Earth,

00:02:57.872 --> 00:03:04.013
some, they already had, but much more densely settled, they have …

00:03:04.013 --> 00:03:10.288
in this country, for example, they immigrated from originally England,

00:03:10.288 --> 00:03:15.874
and pretty much wiped out the indigenous population, and conquered a large part of the land …

00:03:15.874 --> 00:03:24.462
and so things continued … during the 20th century they had massive wars of mutual destruction.

00:03:24.462 --> 00:03:31.311
In 1945 they entered a new, a dramatic new era,

00:03:31.311 --> 00:03:38.526
the nuclear age, in which they had devised means to destroy themselves.

00:03:38.526 --> 00:03:45.101
And they have been living under the shadow of this threat, which is a very serious one,

00:03:45.101 --> 00:03:50.657
for 70 years, up and back, now increasing again …

00:03:50.657 --> 00:03:54.188
And at the same time, though we didn’t know it at the time,

00:03:54.188 --> 00:03:56.467
I’m old enough to remember it,

00:03:56.467 --> 00:04:04.918
we now know that at about the same time a new geological epoch began.

00:04:04.918 --> 00:04:11.921
The geologists divide all of history into different epochs, Pleistocene, Holocene …

00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:17.781
most of them last millions of years. This new one began …

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:22.500
geologists now place it approximately at the end of the Second World War.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.608
It’s the period when very dramatic changes took place in the environment,

00:04:27.608 --> 00:04:31.948
caused by human activity. That’s why it’s called the Anthropocene,

00:04:31.948 --> 00:04:40.305
the human geological epoch, in which humans began to radically transform the environment,

00:04:40.305 --> 00:04:44.752
and now to the point where they’re on the verge of destroying themselves.

00:04:44.752 --> 00:04:48.039
So, going back to this interested Alien,

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:54.943
what he sees is that this remarkable species developed higher intelligence,

00:04:54.943 --> 00:05:01.722
and it is now using it in order to destroy itself, and is on the verge of destruction.

00:05:01.722 --> 00:05:07.094
And they might watch something like the current electoral campaign,

00:05:07.094 --> 00:05:11.918
everyone’s paying attention to it, and notice a very curious fact:

00:05:11.918 --> 00:05:13.913
none of this is being discussed.

00:05:13.913 --> 00:05:20.823
What’s being discussed is tweets at 3 a.m., you know,

00:05:20.823 --> 00:05:27.924
various kinds of vulgarity, anything, but serious problems.

00:05:27.924 --> 00:05:33.382
And the two, the most serious problem that ever has arisen in human history, namely,

00:05:33.382 --> 00:05:37.043
are we gonna survive, is not being discussed.

00:05:37.043 --> 00:05:37.906
TJ: Why not?

00:05:37.906 --> 00:05:39.908
NC: That’s an interesting question.

00:05:39.908 --> 00:05:44.038
The extraterrestrial Alien might be asking himself,

00:05:44.038 --> 00:05:51.897
what strange form of intelligence is it that enables great accomplishments to be achieved,

00:05:51.897 --> 00:05:59.895
but is unable to ask the question “will we survive?” and “how can we ensure our survival?”

00:05:59.895 --> 00:06:02.169
Of course there are plenty of people doing it.

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:07.085
They’re just off the mainstream, so you don’t see it in the electoral campaign,

00:06:07.085 --> 00:06:08.878
you don’t see it in media commentary …

00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:12.078
You do see it in popular activism, all over.

00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:18.181
And that’s another fact that the Alien might be intrigued by.

00:06:18.181 --> 00:06:27.163
TJ: So, if you’re the Alien, how do you explain that after 200 000 years humanity hasn’t united?

00:06:27.163 --> 00:06:31.050
NC: It’s tried in various times.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.254
In 1945, at the beginning of the nuclear age,

00:06:35.254 --> 00:06:38.670
it was recognized by people who were thinking,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:46.576
that we simply have to unite in order to overcome the threat we have created to our own existence.

00:06:46.576 --> 00:06:53.260
Albert Einstein for one said this as soon as the atom bomb went off,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:57.984
he said this means that we must have world government, or else we’re finished.

00:06:57.984 --> 00:07:01.177
And others drew the same conclusion.

00:07:01.177 --> 00:07:03.236
In fact, if we go back to the late Forties,

00:07:03.236 --> 00:07:09.550
some of the top bestsellers were discussions of how we can move on to world government.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:13.994
And there was an effort. It’s called the United Nations.

00:07:13.994 --> 00:07:20.947
Which at the beginning … it was hoped … would have promise of moving in this direction.

00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:27.728
But it was pretty quickly undermined by competing nationalisms,

00:07:27.728 --> 00:07:30.900
actually, the United Sates was of course in the lead,

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:39.701
because at the end of the Second World War the US had enormous … historic … enormous power,

00:07:39.701 --> 00:07:43.168
without any historical precedent, even remotely like it,

00:07:43.168 --> 00:07:47.073
it had about half the world’s wealth, which is incredible.

00:07:47.073 --> 00:07:53.626
Other industrial societies had been destroyed or severely harmed.

00:07:53.626 --> 00:07:58.167
The US economy gained enormously during the war.

00:07:58.167 --> 00:08:04.426
Manufacturing quadrupled, new technologies were developed;

00:08:04.426 --> 00:08:10.765
it was poised to be the dominant world power at a level that had never been seen in history.

00:08:10.765 --> 00:08:17.552
Ah, things have changed to some extent since, but it is still, to a substantial extent, true.

00:08:17.552 --> 00:08:21.490
So the US initiatives and actions were pretty critical.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:27.621
And in the early years, see, the US used its power to turn,

00:08:27.621 --> 00:08:36.216
to dominate the United Nations and basically to turn into a battering ram against its major enemies, the Soviet Union.

00:08:36.216 --> 00:08:39.142
So in the early years of the United Nations,

00:08:39.142 --> 00:08:42.718
if you look at vetoes of Security Council resolutions,

00:08:42.718 --> 00:08:49.883
they were almost all Russian, because the UN was being used as a way to attack the Russians.

00:08:49.883 --> 00:08:54.019
Often for legitimate reasons, but nevertheless that’s how it was used.

00:08:54.019 --> 00:09:01.530
That has changed over the years, but not in a way that has made the UN a functioning,

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:04.780
independent force that might bring people together.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:11.636
So during the Nineteen-Fifties other industrial societies began to reconstruct from the war,

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:16.096
decolonization began; some parts of the world,

00:09:16.096 --> 00:09:20.608
huge parts of the world that had been colonies of the European powers,

00:09:20.608 --> 00:09:23.052
gained some measure of independence.

00:09:23.052 --> 00:09:30.847
All of that led to a more diversified international system, and US power within the UN,

00:09:30.847 --> 00:09:33.870
though still overwhelming, began to decline.

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:39.418
Vetoes of resolutions are a pretty good measure of it.

00:09:39.418 --> 00:09:46.132
Up until 1970, there were no US vetoes. From 1970 to the present,

00:09:46.132 --> 00:09:50.188
the United States is way in the lead when in to vetoing resolutions,

00:09:50.188 --> 00:09:56.077
because it’s become increasingly isolated from large parts of world opinion.

00:09:56.077 --> 00:09:59.477
Americans probably aren’t aware of this,

00:09:59.477 --> 00:10:06.244
but there are polls of international opinion, carried out by the major US polling agencies,

00:10:06.244 --> 00:10:11.541
not the Russian, no hostile enemies, like, Gallup polls,

00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:17.193
and one of the questions they ask is “which country is the greatest threat to world peace?” …

00:10:17.193 --> 00:10:21.543
and the United States is way ahead – nobody is even close.

00:10:21.543 --> 00:10:26.152
This does not get reported in the United States, so people don’t know about it …

00:10:26.152 --> 00:10:27.204
TJ: Is it true?

00:10:27.204 --> 00:10:30.700
NC: Is it true? That’s what most of the world thinks.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.853
TJ: What do you think?

00:10:31.853 --> 00:10:37.365
NC: Oh, I think there’s very good reason to believe it. We don’t like to look at it that way, but …

00:10:37.365 --> 00:10:39.836
TJ: … we’re the good guys … the West …

00:10:39.836 --> 00:10:42.274
NC: Not the West, the United States.

00:10:42.294 --> 00:10:46.813
But every other great power has also thought of itself as the good guys.

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:50.362
It was true of Britain when it was running the world,

00:10:50.362 --> 00:10:53.022
it was true of France when it was a dominant power,

00:10:53.022 --> 00:10:59.309
it was true of Hitler-Germany, it was true of fascist Japan, and in fact, it’s kind of universal.

00:10:59.309 --> 00:11:09.375
Every state that has any degree of power regards itself as uniquely admirable or magnificent,

00:11:09.375 --> 00:11:14.991
and doesn’t understand why the rest of the world doesn’t perceive their angelic character.

00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:17.038
That’s historically universal.

00:11:17.038 --> 00:11:20.619
Probably it is true of Genghis Kahn, though we have no records.

00:11:20.619 --> 00:11:25.043
TJ: So ... ah … let’s stick with the Alien Perspective again,

00:11:25.043 --> 00:11:32.490
if you say global warming and the nuclear age still has to be resolved,

00:11:32.490 --> 00:11:37.298
like, we have to fix those problems – if we don’t fix them,

00:11:37.298 --> 00:11:42.414
will the 21st century be the final, the last century of humanity?

00:11:42.414 --> 00:11:47.711
NC: Probably not of humanity, but of organized human life on Earth.

00:11:47.711 --> 00:11:55.954
So for example … if there is a nuclear war, which has come very close many times,

00:11:55.954 --> 00:11:58.335
sometimes by accident, pure accident,

00:11:58.335 --> 00:12:03.928
I could give you some examples which are harrowing, but sometimes by reckless actions.

00:12:04.028 --> 00:12:10.575
The threat is now increasing. Some of the leading mainstream specialists,

00:12:10.575 --> 00:12:14.372
nuclear strategists, people like William Perry, former Defense Secretary,

00:12:14.372 --> 00:12:20.766
argue that the threat of nuclear war today is greater than it was during the Cold War.

00:12:20.766 --> 00:12:21.722
TJ: Today?

00:12:21.722 --> 00:12:24.775
NC: Today. And others agree.

00:12:24.775 --> 00:12:29.932
There is a journal called the “Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists”.

00:12:29.932 --> 00:12:33.165
It’s a major journal of atomic scientists.

00:12:33.165 --> 00:12:43.201
It opened right at the beginning of the nuclear age, in 1947, two years after the atomic bombing.

00:12:43.201 --> 00:12:49.494
They established what they calling a Doomsday Clock, a clock with a minute hand.

00:12:49.494 --> 00:12:54.434
The question is: How far is the minute hand from midnight?

00:12:54.434 --> 00:12:57.550
Midnight means termination, we’re done.

00:12:57.550 --> 00:13:04.538
Every year they collect a group of specialists, experts, to try to set the minute hand.

00:13:04.538 --> 00:13:09.385
Two years ago they moved it two minutes closer to midnight.

00:13:09.385 --> 00:13:12.632
Now, three minutes to midnight, which is very close,

00:13:12.632 --> 00:13:18.326
the closest it’s been since the early Nineteen-Eighties, when there was a major war scare –

00:13:18.326 --> 00:13:20.321
we almost came to war.

00:13:20.321 --> 00:13:23.417
So it’s not just William Perry – plenty of others.

00:13:23.417 --> 00:13:25.725
Incidentally, when they moved it to midnight,

00:13:25.725 --> 00:13:29.389
it was not just because of a threat of nuclear war,

00:13:29.389 --> 00:13:38.328
it was also because of the failure of governments to deal with the increasing threat of environmental catastrophe.

00:13:38.328 --> 00:13:43.942
And it’s serious. So just take one element: Rising sea levels.

00:13:43.942 --> 00:13:48.043
That’s not in question any longer; sea levels are rising,

00:13:48.043 --> 00:13:51.936
and in fact faster than they have in recorded history.

00:13:51.936 --> 00:13:57.994
Just consider a country like Bangladesh. It’s a low-lying coastal plain;

00:13:57.994 --> 00:14:04.596
it has hundreds of millions of people. As the sea level rises slightly,

00:14:04.596 --> 00:14:06.553
those people are going to have to flee.

00:14:06.553 --> 00:14:13.294
The chief environmental scientist of Bangladesh recently warned

00:14:13.294 --> 00:14:21.541
that tens of millions of people are going to have to flee in the coming years, just from sea level rising.

00:14:21.541 --> 00:14:24.161
And he made an interesting comment.

00:14:24.161 --> 00:14:32.583
He said that if we lived in a just world, these people would be admitted into the rich countries,

00:14:32.583 --> 00:14:37.812
the United States, England, and others, because those are the countries that are responsible for it,

00:14:37.812 --> 00:14:40.453
and have the capacity to absorb them.

00:14:40.453 --> 00:14:44.372
If we think we have an immigrant crisis today,

00:14:44.372 --> 00:14:46.237
which is non-existent,

00:14:46.237 --> 00:14:52.106
what is it going to be like when tens of millions of people are fleeing from rising sea levels?

00:14:52.106 --> 00:14:55.968
And that’s just the beginning. Just keep to South Asia.

00:14:55.968 --> 00:15:01.671
The water supply of South Asia comes mostly from glaciers in the Himalaya Mountains.

00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:05.784
They are melting. What happens when they disappear?

00:15:05.784 --> 00:15:09.958
Thea are melting pretty fast. There goes the water supply for South Asia.

00:15:09.958 --> 00:15:14.067
Couple of billion people. In India alone, right now,

00:15:14.067 --> 00:15:20.636
there are already, about, estimated, 300 million people who barely have access to water.

00:15:20.636 --> 00:15:26.456
What’s going to happen to them? It’s all over the place.

00:15:26.456 --> 00:15:37.534
Our coastal cities are going to disappear, and the extreme weather events will increase ...

00:15:37.534 --> 00:15:47.029
Right now, there are … about one person per second is fleeing from the effects of severe weather.

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:51.645
That’s more than the number of refugees. And that’s going to increase.

00:15:51.645 --> 00:15:55.434
We are facing a major disaster, unless something is done.

00:15:55.434 --> 00:16:00.248
Now this Alien, who is watching us, he would be astonished,

00:16:00.248 --> 00:16:04.144
not just at the fact that it is not being discussed,

00:16:04.144 --> 00:16:10.247
but the fact that in the richest and most powerful country in world history,

00:16:10.247 --> 00:16:12.986
which is going to shape what happens for the future,

00:16:12.986 --> 00:16:19.123
there is a major political party, the one that happens to dominate Congress right now,

00:16:19.123 --> 00:16:21.572
which simply denies that it’s happening.

00:16:21.572 --> 00:16:27.842
They have a policy about global warming: "Forget it. It’s not happening, OK?"

00:16:27.842 --> 00:16:31.838
It’s hard to find words to describe this.

00:16:31.838 --> 00:16:36.193
That means that in the most powerful country in world history,

00:16:36.193 --> 00:16:39.041
the most educated, with major advantages,

00:16:39.041 --> 00:16:45.111
a major political party is saying let’s race to the precipice as quickly as possible.

00:16:45.111 --> 00:16:49.931
And there’s no comment on it. Try to find a comment on that fact.

00:16:49.931 --> 00:16:56.012
I mean what it really means is that this is the most dangerous organization in world history.

TJ: The Republican Party?

00:16:57.573 --> 00:17:01.419
NC: Take a look. Is that an exaggeration? In the primary,

00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:07.570
the Republican primary, every single candidate said it’s not happening …

00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:13.373
with one exception, John Kasich, who is supposed to be the sensible, moderate.

00:17:13.373 --> 00:17:17.716
He said yes, it’s happening, but we shouldn’t do anything about it, which is worse.

00:17:17.716 --> 00:17:21.303
So that’s a 100% refusal, OK?

00:17:21.303 --> 00:17:26.111
The winning candidate denies that what’s happening, is happening,

00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:30.580
and says we should make it worse. We should use more fossil fuels,

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.030
including coal, which is the most polluting,

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:35.972
we should eliminate environmental regulations,

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:42.826
we should refuse to help poorer countries move to sustainable energy,

00:17:42.826 --> 00:17:46.589

00:17:46.589 --> 00:17:48.869

00:17:48.869 --> 00:17:51.251
let’s race to the precipice as quickly as possible.

00:17:51.251 --> 00:17:54.316
Meanwhile, the threat of nuclear war is increasing,

00:17:54.316 --> 00:18:00.775
with very provocative actions on both sides. And there is very little …

00:18:00.775 --> 00:18:07.637
Specialists are concerned, but it’s not part of the general kind of conversation.

00:18:07.637 --> 00:18:11.691
It’s not what you talk about with your friends when you go out for a cup of coffee.

00:18:13.143 --> 00:18:20.343
But maybe the Alien would agree that ignorance is bliss? Ignorance is bliss?

NC: For a short time. Until it hits.

00:18:24.211 --> 00:18:27.144
And it’s not bliss for other people.

00:18:27.144 --> 00:18:38.228
It’s not bliss for the one person per second who is fleeing the effects of severe weather, drought, and so on.

00:18:38.228 --> 00:18:42.817
And these droughts, which are all over the place, are really having a big effect.

00:18:42.817 --> 00:18:51.441
The catastrophe in Darfour, or what’s now happening in Syria, which is horrible,

00:18:51.441 --> 00:18:56.756
are to a significant extent the result of severe droughts. Take Syria.

00:18:56.756 --> 00:19:03.167
Awful things are happening. Half a million people have been killed, millions are refugees.

00:19:03.167 --> 00:19:05.342
The country is being destroyed.

00:19:05.342 --> 00:19:14.642
Part of the reason is that several years before the conflict broke out there was a very severe drought in Syria.

00:19:14.642 --> 00:19:17.653
Syria has been settled for thousands of years,

00:19:17.653 --> 00:19:24.236
it is the heart of human civilization, and there has never been anything like it, in all of history.

00:19:24.236 --> 00:19:30.375
A huge drought, that drove peasants off the land, they couldn’t farm, couldn’t survive.

00:19:30.375 --> 00:19:38.328
Drove them into cities, that means densely populated urban slums, lots of tension and conflict.

00:19:38.328 --> 00:19:42.104
All of that is kind of dry kindling.

00:19:42.104 --> 00:19:47.648
Drop a match on it and it explodes. It sets up the basis for conflict.

00:19:47.648 --> 00:19:55.139
In Darfour, where there was again a huge catastrophe, a couple of years ago,

00:19:55.139 --> 00:19:56.348
but it’s still continuing,

00:19:56.348 --> 00:20:11.201
part of the reason is that terrible droughts had driven nomadic populations into agricultural settled areas in order to survive, which set up, of course, a conflict.

00:20:11.201 --> 00:20:16.466
If there is an invasion, what amounts to an invasion, of people trying to survive,

00:20:16.466 --> 00:20:21.614
it’s not pleasant, but that’s in large part the basis of what happened there.

00:20:21.614 --> 00:20:23.327
And there’s going to be more and more of it.

00:20:23.327 --> 00:20:28.166
And we’re going to have water wars, because water is scarce and not preserved.

00:20:28.166 --> 00:20:34.371
Ignorance is bliss, if you can get yourself away from it,

00:20:34.371 --> 00:20:40.709

TJ: Ahm – want to talk about the American Empire?

00:20:46.393 --> 00:20:48.916
Martin Luther King famously said:

00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:54.047
“The greatest purveyor of violence in the world today is my own government.”

00:20:54.047 --> 00:20:55.766
He meant the American government.

00:20:55.766 --> 00:20:59.382
He said that 50 years ago. Is that still true?

00:21:03.993 --> 00:21:16.531
where American B52 bombers were carrying out saturation bombing in the densely populated Mekong Delta.

00:21:16.531 --> 00:21:20.590
Millions of people were killed, the country devastated …

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:27.983
at about the time when he spoke, one of the leading specialists on Indochina,

00:21:27.983 --> 00:21:32.570
Bernard Fall, a Vietnam historian, a military historian,

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:41.453
who was by no means on the Left, he was strongly in favor of the US-backed Saigon government and US policy.

00:21:41.453 --> 00:21:45.315
He nevertheless pointed out that, as he put it,

00:21:45.315 --> 00:21:57.995
Vietnam as a historical and cultural entity may not survive the greatest onslaught against a population in an area this size in history.

00:21:57.995 --> 00:22:00.450
That’s when Martin Luther King spoke.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.890
Has it changed? Not that much.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:09.325
A couple of years ago … in 2003 the United States,

00:22:09.325 --> 00:22:16.690
along with Britain, invaded Iraq, killed hundreds of thousands of people,

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:23.969
generated millions of refugees, all kinds of atrocities, torture and so on …

00:22:23.969 --> 00:22:27.997
instigated a sectarian conflict …

there is a major split in the Islamic world, it goes back to the eighth century,

00:22:37.265 --> 00:22:42.478
which has been pretty amicable, just like Protestant and Catholic, kind of,

00:22:42.478 --> 00:22:46.407
not during period of the Great Wars, but during the peaceful periods. …

00:22:46.602 --> 00:22:54.120
In Iraq, the two groups were there, Shiite and Sunni, but they were intermingled,

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.983
they intermarried, they lived in the same areas,

00:22:55.983 --> 00:22:58.905
sometimes people didn’t know who was who, you know.

00:22:58.905 --> 00:23:01.793
One of the effects of the American invasion,

00:23:01.793 --> 00:23:10.355
an almost immediate effect was to begin to instigate a sectarian conflict, which is now tearing Iraq apart;

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:13.148
and it’s tearing the region apart.

00:23:13.148 --> 00:23:20.013

Turkey was carrying out terrifying atrocities against its own Kurdish population …

tens of thousands were killed, about 3500 towns and villages were destroyed,

hundreds of thousands, some say millions, of refugees fled the South-East of Turkey,

there was every imaginable kind of torture and terror …

00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:07.546
Germany was selling arms to the government of Turkey.

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:13.084
It wasn’t the leader – the Unites States was the leader, the big guy on the block,

00:24:13.084 --> 00:24:18.230

around the world to murder people who were threatening Iran.

00:24:58.489 --> 00:25:03.159
For example the editors of the New York Times and the Washington Post,

00:25:03.159 --> 00:25:10.143
major newspapers, who run articles saying we should bomb Iran right now, not wait.

00:25:10.143 --> 00:25:17.882
Big articles. So suppose they figured, well, look, they’re threatening us, really seriously,

they’re claiming they’re gonna destroy us, Let’s kill’em.

You are torturers. Germany was involved in the rendition program.

00:27:00.585 --> 00:27:02.963
The worst form of torture.

00:27:02.963 --> 00:27:10.109
The most depraved form, and the most cowardly form is to take suspects

00:27:10.109 --> 00:27:15.101
and send them to terrorist countries where you know they’re gonna be tortured.

00:27:15.101 --> 00:27:22.892
That’s the peak. You send them to Syria, or Libya under Ghaddafi,

00:27:22.892 --> 00:27:26.063
and that’s the way you can make sure they’re gonna be tortured.

00:27:26.063 --> 00:27:31.715
There was a study recently of the countries that participated in the …

00:27:31.715 --> 00:27:34.151
it’s called rendition, in the rendition program …

00:27:34.151 --> 00:27:39.434
and practically all of Europe … the Middle East, of course,

00:27:39.434 --> 00:27:45.196
because that’s where the suspects were sent to be tortured, by dictators,

00:27:45.196 --> 00:27:51.703
in fact the only part of the world that didn’t participate was South America, Latin America.

00:27:51.703 --> 00:27:57.109
They refused. Which is kind of interesting, for a number of reasons.

For one thing, because they refused, for another,

00:28:00.136 --> 00:28:05.963
because not many years ago Latin America was the center of global torture.

00:28:05.963 --> 00:28:12.972
During the period of the US-backed, sometimes US-installed dictatorships

00:28:12.972 --> 00:28:21.636

There was horrible torture all over the place, not very long ago.

But enough of a change has taken place that Latin America,

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:41.873

of course American leaders were planning how to run the war and what the post-war world would look like …

00:29:54.654 --> 00:29:58.008
and the United States happens to be a very open society,

00:29:58.008 --> 00:30:02.214
so we have a lot of information about what the government is doing,

00:30:02.214 --> 00:30:06.842
not like other societies, we are much more free …. And we know what they were planning.

00:30:06.842 --> 00:30:12.836
At that time, say, roughly 1942, you know, before Stalingrad,

00:30:12.836 --> 00:30:18.243
American planners assumed that the post-war world would be divided

00:30:18.243 --> 00:30:22.301
into an American-controlled world and a German-controlled world.

00:30:22.301 --> 00:30:29.530
Two worlds, the American-controlled world would of course have the Western hemisphere,

00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:36.038
take over the former British Empire, whatever they could hold on to in Eurasia,

00:30:36.038 --> 00:30:41.290
and the German-controlled world would have the rest. That’s what it looked like in 1942 …

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.030
I’m old enough to remember it;

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:47.551
I didn’t know it about the planning of course, but you could see what was happening in the world.

00:30:47.551 --> 00:30:54.832
And until the Russians turned the tide, and began to drive the German armies back,

00:30:54.832 --> 00:30:57.989
Stalingrad, Kursk, and so on, that’s the way it looked.

00:30:57.989 --> 00:31:01.368
Could you have predicted? Not really.

00:31:01.368 --> 00:31:05.970
The American Empire is not what it was in 1945.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:10.381
As I mentioned, the world’s become considerably more diverse.

00:31:10.381 --> 00:31:19.262
So in 1945 the US had maybe half the world’s wealth, and today it has maybe a quarter,

00:31:19.262 --> 00:31:22.368
which is colossal, but not the same.

00:31:22.368 --> 00:31:33.011
And large parts of the world that were under US control or partially under US control, in 1945, are no longer.

00:31:33.011 --> 00:31:38.424
China for example. China became independent in 1949.

00:31:38.424 --> 00:31:41.316
There is a phrase for that in the West.

00:31:41.316 --> 00:31:46.002
It’s called “the Loss of China”, which is a very interesting phrase …

00:31:46.002 --> 00:31:50.877
when the Alien observes and he notices we are calling it the Loss of China.

00:31:50.877 --> 00:31:55.999
I can’t lose your computer. I can lose my computer.

00:31:55.999 --> 00:32:01.651
If we lost China that means we owned China, and that’s the assumption.

00:32:01.651 --> 00:32:05.562
The tacit assumption is: We own it. It’s ours.

00:32:05.562 --> 00:32:08.574
And if it becomes independent, we’ve lost it.

00:32:08.574 --> 00:32:14.270
The “Loss of Indochina” was described the same way, it is an interesting mentality.

00:32:14.270 --> 00:32:16.651
But nevertheless, it has declined.

00:32:16.651 --> 00:32:21.268
However, if you use different measures, you get a different picture.

00:32:21.268 --> 00:32:25.140
This is a different world than it was in the Nineteen-Forties.

00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:32.029
It’s a much more … in economic terms, it’s a more globalized world.

00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:37.446
Corporations, for example: In the Nineteen-Forties,

00:32:37.446 --> 00:32:45.950
they operated primarily in their home countries. And now they have global operations, so …

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:52.141
I see you’ve got an iPhone, or whatever it is over there, something, one of those things …

00:32:52.141 --> 00:32:57.291
let’s say iPhones, which have been studied carefully.

00:32:57.291 --> 00:33:02.722
They are produced by Apple. They are assembled in South-East China,

00:33:02.722 --> 00:33:07.081
by a Taiwanese corporation, Foxconn.

00:33:07.081 --> 00:33:16.222
But Apple runs the whole operation, and if you look at the profits, they go back to Apple, overwhelmingly.

00:33:16.222 --> 00:33:20.523
Foxconn gets about 10%. China gets a little bit.

00:33:20.523 --> 00:33:27.616
They are the assembly plant for Foxconn, which is effectively a subsidiary of Apple.

00:33:27.616 --> 00:33:30.119
That’s globalized operations.

00:33:30.119 --> 00:33:34.537
And if you now look at the ownership of the world,

00:33:34.537 --> 00:33:42.841
which corporations basically own the world, it turns out that US corporations have about half of ownership of the world.

00:33:42.841 --> 00:33:46.762
So in some respects, it’s not very different from 1945.

00:33:46.762 --> 00:33:56.232
It’s not national territory that has half the world’s wealth, bus US-based corporations that do.

00:33:56.232 --> 00:34:02.458
That’s a change in the world system, a significant change,

00:34:02.458 --> 00:34:05.423
which hasn’t been sufficiently investigated.

00:34:05.423 --> 00:34:12.168
China has grown enormously, but it’s not among the top owners …

00:34:12.168 --> 00:34:17.319
if you look at Chinese corporations, they’re not the ones that run the world.

00:34:17.319 --> 00:34:21.515
So yes, it’s a very different, complex world, changed in lots of ways.

00:34:21.515 --> 00:34:24.983
These international corporations, multi-nationals,

00:34:24.983 --> 00:34:32.506
are nationally based, so they rely on their home country, and the tax-payers in their home country …

00:34:32.506 --> 00:34:36.428
increasingly they don’t contribute to their home country.

00:34:36.428 --> 00:34:46.021
So take Apple again. It sets up a headquarters in Ireland, which may be, for all I know, the size of this office.

00:34:46.021 --> 00:34:48.731
And it says, OK, that’s our base.

00:34:48.731 --> 00:34:52.453
So we just pay Irish taxes, which happen to be very low.

00:34:52.453 --> 00:34:56.835
Luxembourg, even lower, Cayman Islands, even lower.

00:34:56.835 --> 00:35:01.447
Recently a study came out, the Panama Papers, it’s called.

00:35:01.447 --> 00:35:07.546
By now a couple of hundred journalists are trying to work through the hundreds of thousands of pages.

00:35:07.546 --> 00:35:11.138
Basically they are the records of a Panama-based law firm

00:35:11.138 --> 00:35:19.663
which is running techniques of tax evasion for corporations and wealthy people all over the world …

00:35:19.663 --> 00:35:29.040
trillions of dollars, tens of trillions of dollars being manipulated to avoid paying taxes in the home country,

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:35.873
though they rely on the home country, for subsidy, for support, they rely in many ways.

00:35:35.873 --> 00:35:43.928
Take a walk around MIT where we are now, just look at the buildings that are there.

00:35:43.928 --> 00:35:45.523
Notice who they are.

00:35:45.523 --> 00:35:57.851
You’ll see Novartis, Pfizer, other big pharmaceutical corporations, genetic engineering corporations and so on …

00:35:57.851 --> 00:35:59.582
What are they doing there?

00:35:59.582 --> 00:36:05.265
What they’re doing is ripping off publicly-funded research at MIT.

00:36:05.265 --> 00:36:11.441
And Harvard, mainly MIT. That’s a large part of the way the economy develops.

00:36:11.441 --> 00:36:16.755
The public pays for the research and development, the costly, risky phase,

00:36:16.755 --> 00:36:21.390
then hand it over to the private corporations for marketing and profit.

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:27.557
And then they carry out their international operations, try to maximize profit,

00:36:27.557 --> 00:36:32.634
and very commonly work out devious techniques,

00:36:32.634 --> 00:36:37.351
so they don’t have to contribute to their home societies for … through taxes.

00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:41.334
That’s a large part of the modern world, a very substantial part.

00:36:41.334 --> 00:36:43.722
So, is it an empire?

00:36:43.722 --> 00:36:47.736
We have to decide what we mean by the word.

00:36:47.736 --> 00:36:51.566
It’s a different kind of ... form of international domination.

00:36:51.566 --> 00:37:00.177
TJ: Do you think it’s gonna be the last empire? … The Alien looks at it …

00:37:00.177 --> 00:37:07.069
NC: The Alien who looks at it and looks at the way humans are responding to the current situation,

00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:19.222
would probably conclude that it’s quite likely that in another century human society will have disintegrated …

00:37:19.222 --> 00:37:23.621
because it will not be able to deal with the immense …

00:37:23.621 --> 00:37:29.640
it is not trying to deal with seriously, the immense problems it is facing, including …

00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:34.137
I mentioned two, which are enormous, but there’s more than that.

00:37:34.137 --> 00:37:41.565
Another major problem is the threat of pandemics, diseases that can’t be controlled.

00:37:41.565 --> 00:37:46.540
That’s already happening. And it’s happening for important reasons.

00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.039
One major reason, which we haven’t mentioned,

00:37:50.039 --> 00:37:56.043
but the Alien would notice, is industrial meat production.

00:37:56.043 --> 00:38:01.595
Industrial meat production is a huge contributor to global warming.

00:38:01.595 --> 00:38:08.562
It is an enormous producer of carbon dioxide and methane and other gases,

00:38:08.562 --> 00:38:16.815
but it also has another feature. Corporations pour antibiotics into these systems.

00:38:16.815 --> 00:38:21.379
Animals are crowded together in horrible conditions,

00:38:21.379 --> 00:38:25.774
and to prevent disease, and to maintain growth,

00:38:25.774 --> 00:38:28.866
there is an extensive use of antibiotics;

00:38:28.866 --> 00:38:33.196
an enormous part of the whole antibiotics production is for this.

00:38:33.196 --> 00:38:40.546
The use of antibiotics leads to mutations which make bacteria antibiotic-resistant,

00:38:40.843 --> 00:38:49.294
and by now the rate of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is growing faster than the techniques for dealing with them.

00:38:49.294 --> 00:38:52.847
So we may be destroying ourselves in that way, too.

00:38:52.847 --> 00:38:57.168
There’s a lot of things the Alien would notice that we should be noticing.

00:38:57.168 --> 00:38:58.827
TJ: So are you a vegan?

00:38:58.827 --> 00:39:03.482
NC: I am not, but I can imagine that one would be.

00:39:03.482 --> 00:39:06.058
The crucial question in my view is not …

00:39:06.058 --> 00:39:10.238
I mean, individual actions are OK, they’re good to do,

00:39:10.238 --> 00:39:12.046
it’s good to use less energy, and so on.

00:39:12.046 --> 00:39:17.424
But what’s really needed is collective action to deal with the roots of the problem.

00:39:17.424 --> 00:39:23.834
I mean, if you are a vegan, let’s say, and you eat food, fruit and vegetables,

00:39:23.834 --> 00:39:28.983
that are transported from somewhere else, you’re contributing to the destruction of the environment.

00:39:28.983 --> 00:39:33.522
That’s what transport is. A lot of things to look at.

00:39:33.522 --> 00:39:37.544
We all make individual compromises, there is no choice.

00:39:37.544 --> 00:39:42.302
You can’t avoid it. Like, we’ve got the lights on. You’ve got the electricity, right?

00:39:42.302 --> 00:39:47.100
But the crucial question is really institutional.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:52.171
How are we gonna deal with the institutions that are creating these systems?

00:39:52.171 --> 00:39:53.725
TJ: Tell us.

00:39:53.725 --> 00:39:57.336
NC: Well, there is only one way that’s ever been discovered:

00:39:57.336 --> 00:40:02.329
Organized, collective action, which has led to a lot of changes.

00:40:02.329 --> 00:40:08.058
Take Germany: It’s not the same country it was seventy, eighty years ago. Why?

00:40:08.058 --> 00:40:12.652
Germans made it a different country. We can do the same.

00:40:12.652 --> 00:40:14.574
In fact, take, say, global warming:

00:40:14.574 --> 00:40:24.059
Germany is pretty advanced among countries of the world in trying to do something about it.

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:28.401
That’s because Germans committed themselves to do something.

00:40:28.401 --> 00:40:35.710
We can do the same on the other issues. Take, say, the threat of nuclear war:

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:38.863
Right now it’s mostly on the Russian border.

00:40:38.863 --> 00:40:42.437
On the Russian border, not the Mexican border.

00:40:42.437 --> 00:40:47.767
Now that’s a reflection of the scale of global power. Why …

00:40:47.767 --> 00:40:50.361
there’s provocations on both sides.

00:40:50.361 --> 00:40:53.824
And Germany is right there, in fact, Germany is right in the center of it.

00:40:53.824 --> 00:40:57.611
The major issue had to do with Germany.

00:40:57.611 --> 00:41:02.830
Go back to 1991, end of the Soviet Empire.

00:41:02.846 --> 00:41:11.874
There was the question as to how the world system would be reconstructed with the Soviet system collapsing.

00:41:11.874 --> 00:41:16.572
There were two views. Gorbachev, the Russian leader,

00:41:16.572 --> 00:41:26.568
proposed a vision of a unified security system for all of Eurasia with no military blocs,

00:41:26.568 --> 00:41:30.523
just cooperative integration. That was one vision.

00:41:30.523 --> 00:41:34.616
The Americans, with President George Bush number one,

00:41:34.616 --> 00:41:39.593
and his Secretary of State James Baker, they had a different vision.

00:41:39.593 --> 00:41:45.033
The Russian system would collapse, and NATO would expand.

00:41:45.033 --> 00:41:48.096
Crucial question was Germany.

00:41:48.096 --> 00:41:51.797
For Russia it’s a pretty serious question.

00:41:51.797 --> 00:42:01.212
Germany alone had practically destroyed Russia twice during the preceding century,

00:42:01.212 --> 00:42:05.980
and earlier, other Western invasions, from Western Europe.

00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:09.669
So what happened to Germany was going to be a serious question.

00:42:09.669 --> 00:42:15.775
Gorbachev agreed to allow Germany to be unified, East and West,

00:42:15.775 --> 00:42:22.273
and even to join NATO, a hostile military alliance, which was quite a concession.

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:26.305
But there was an agreement, he thought,

00:42:26.305 --> 00:42:32.772
the agreement was that NATO would not expand one inch to the East.

00:42:32.772 --> 00:42:36.732
That was the phrase that was used, which meant East Germany.

00:42:36.732 --> 00:42:40.611
NATO immediately expanded to East Germany.

00:42:40.611 --> 00:42:46.414
When Gorbachev protested, the Americans pointed out, correctly,

00:42:46.414 --> 00:42:51.998
that it wasn’t a written agreement. It was just a verbal agreement, like a handshake.

00:42:51.998 --> 00:42:55.624
So, if you trust us, that’s kind of your problem.

00:42:55.624 --> 00:42:58.344
So NATO expanded to East Germany under …

00:42:58.344 --> 00:43:04.222
the following years under Clinton, it expanded to the former Russian Empire,

00:43:04.222 --> 00:43:06.938
all the way to the borders of Russia.

00:43:06.938 --> 00:43:18.103
In 2008, and again in 2013, under Obama, NATO offered admission to NATO to Ukraine …

00:43:18.103 --> 00:43:21.472
Take a look at the map and [at] history.

00:43:21.472 --> 00:43:26.715
Ukraine is right in the geopolitical and strategic heartland of Russia,

00:43:26.715 --> 00:43:31.034
apart from long historical, other connections.

00:43:31.034 --> 00:43:37.691
Offering Ukraine NATO membership is a very serious threat to Russia.

00:43:37.691 --> 00:43:40.317
Western analysts understand that.

00:43:40.317 --> 00:43:45.212
Right now the United States, Obama, is placing a …

00:43:45.212 --> 00:43:49.408
what’s called a missile defense system in Romania.

00:43:49.408 --> 00:43:58.372
The pretense is that it is supposed to defend Europe from non-existent Iranian missiles, OK?

00:43:58.372 --> 00:44:02.874
You can believe that, you can believe in Alice in Wonderland.

00:44:02.874 --> 00:44:06.172
It’s of course aimed against Russia, obviously.

00:44:06.172 --> 00:44:14.824
Furthermore, it’s understood by strategic analysts on all sides that what’s called missile defense is an offensive weapon.

00:44:14.824 --> 00:44:20.814
Nobody believes that missile defense could ever stop a first strike,

00:44:20.814 --> 00:44:27.114
but it is imaginable that it might deter a retaliatory strike, which means,

00:44:27.114 --> 00:44:32.209
it’s a first-strike weapon, and everyone understands that. It’s highly provocative.

00:44:32.209 --> 00:44:36.498
Now the Russians are carrying out a major military build-up of their own,

00:44:36.498 --> 00:44:47.480
modernizing forces, new missile systems, nuclear submarines with nuclear weapons, and so on …

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:51.486
and you have constant threats right at the border.

00:44:51.486 --> 00:44:56.113
Jet planes of both sides kind of buzzing each other, and so on … could blow up.

00:44:56.113 --> 00:44:58.340
Germany is sitting right there.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.591
Germany could play a leading role in trying to reduce these tensions,

00:45:02.591 --> 00:45:07.566
and in fact some German political leaders have called for that.

00:45:07.566 --> 00:45:12.381
But these are choices, and they are choices that the German people will have to make.

00:45:12.381 --> 00:45:16.049
Do we wanna have a nuclear war and destroy everything?

00:45:16.049 --> 00:45:20.661
Do we wanna wipe out the world with global catastrophes?

00:45:20.661 --> 00:45:22.683
