Welcome to a very special
Inaugural Edition of the

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:04.433
West Wing Week!

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:06.500
Your guide to everything
that happened at the 57th

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.200
Presidential Inauguration.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.700
This week Washington, D.C. was
transformed into an historic

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.333
stage with an estimated 1
million people on hand to

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:17.700
witness the President and
Vice President take the oath

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.066
of office at the
United States Capitol.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:23.166
Through it all, West Wing Week
was there, from the terrace of

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:25.934
the Capitol, to
backstage at the balls.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:28.233
America, take a moment to look
back at where we've been this

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:32.600
week with a Special Edition of
West Wing Week, January 18th to

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.166
the 24th or "Behind the
Scenes Inauguration 2013!"

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.800
(cheers and applause)

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800
Bystander:
How are you doing?

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.834
The President:
I'm doing great.
I'm ready to work!

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:42.333
Bystander:
All right!

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.266
Narrator:
On Saturday, the First Family
kicked off Inauguration Weekend

00:00:45.266 --> 00:00:48.700
by participating in the National
Day of Service helping out in

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.133
the construction of some
new bookshelves at Burrville

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:53.000
Elementary School
in Washington, D.C.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.700
(cheers and applause)

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.633
The President:
I hear reports that the very
young people did some really

00:00:56.633 --> 00:01:00.533
good work and some of the
older folks like me who it

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:04.367
hurt getting our knees kind of
bending down a little bit, this

00:01:04.367 --> 00:01:06.266
is really what America is about.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:07.767
This what is we celebrate.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:12.400
This inauguration is a symbol of
how our democracy works and how

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.100
we peacefully transfer power.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.900
But it should also be an
affirmation that we're all in

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.233
this together and that we've got
to look out for each other and

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:22.500
work hard on behalf
of each other, so...

Then came the kickoff event
of Inauguration Weekend with

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:29.667
the First Lady and Dr. Biden
honoring military families at

00:01:29.667 --> 00:01:32.800
the "Our Children, Our Future
Concert" where families of

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.367
active duty reserve and retired
service members got a chance to

00:01:36.367 --> 00:01:40.734
catch performances by some
of America's top artists.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.200
Sunday was officially the last
day of the President's first

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.166
term and the first day
of his second term.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.300
In the morning after the Vice
President had been sworn in to

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.800
office, the President traveled
to Arlington National Cemetery

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.567
where he met the Vice President
for a wreath-laying ceremony at

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:56.734
the Tomb of the Unknowns.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.567
Later, in accordance with the
Constitution, the President was

00:01:59.567 --> 00:02:02.734
joined by Chief Justice John
Roberts in the Blue Room where

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:05.667
he was officially sworn
in just before noon.

00:02:05.667 --> 00:02:07.200
Chief Justice Roberts:
Congratulations, Mr. President.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.066
The President:
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:09.266
Thank you, so much.

00:02:09.266 --> 00:02:09.967
Mrs. Obama:
Congratulations.

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:10.633
The President:
Thank you, sweetie.

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:12.000
(applause)

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.066
Narrator:
Monday marked the 57th
Inaugural Ceremony in our

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:16.333
nation's history.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.033
Here is a little look-back
at that historic day.

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:21.734
The President:
America's possibilities
are limitless.

00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:24.433
For we possess all the
qualities that this world

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:26.233
without boundaries demands:

00:02:26.233 --> 00:02:33.500
Youth and drive; diversity and
openness; an endless capacity

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.367
for risk and a gift
for reinvention.

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:40.533
My fellow Americans, we are
made for this moment and we will

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:43.734
seize it so long as
we seize it together!

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:49.500
(cheers and applause)

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.700
For we, the people, understand
that our country cannot succeed

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.467
when a shrinking few do very
well and a growing many barely

00:02:59.467 --> 00:03:00.500
make it.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.200
(applause)

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.967
We believe that America's
prosperity must rest upon

00:03:03.967 --> 00:03:06.700
the broad shoulders of
a rising middle class.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.800
We know that America thrives
when every person can find

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.600
independence and
pride in their work.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.533
When the wages of honest labor
liberate families from the brink

00:03:14.533 --> 00:03:15.533
of hardship.

00:03:15.533 --> 00:03:18.233
We are true to our creed when
a little girl born into the

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:21.500
bleakest poverty knows that she
has the same chance to succeed

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.934
as anybody else because
she is an American!

00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:25.033
She is free!

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:26.033
And she is equal!

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:29.467
Not just in the eyes of
God, but also in our own!

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:31.400
(cheers and applause)

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.400
Narrator:
That evening, it was time
to celebrate, first at the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.734
Commander-In-Chief's Ball where,
yes, the Commander-In-Chief

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:39.900
dialed in troops
serving in Afghanistan

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.600
via video teleconference.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.000
Soldier:
Thank very much for having
us here at your party.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.066
Congratulations!

00:03:45.066 --> 00:03:47.467
Narrator:
The First Lady then joined the
President on stage for a first

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:51.200
dance serenaded by the one
and only Jennifer Hudson.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.533
They then visited the Inaugural
Ball, they got the dancing

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:54.834
started at that party.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:57.633
And had a chance to thank
the many talented musicians

00:03:57.633 --> 00:03:58.667
who were there to perform.

00:03:58.667 --> 00:03:59.266
The President:
All right.

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:00.500
Now we've got to do the poof --

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.467
Narrator:
On Tuesday, the President, the
Vice President, the First Lady

00:04:04.467 --> 00:04:08.567
and Dr. Biden, attended the 57th
National Prayer Service at the

00:04:08.567 --> 00:04:11.734
National Cathedral where
leaders of a wide array of faith

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:15.734
traditions gathered to pray
for our nation and our leaders.

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:18.433
Reverend Dr. Warnock:
We must all learn to live
together as brothers and

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:23.767
sisters or we will all
perish together as fools.

00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:26.934
Narrator:
Then the President and First
Lady reprised a tradition that

00:04:26.934 --> 00:04:30.600
began in their first term, a
special surprise greeting for

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.166
guests on the White House Tour.

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:34.166
The President:
Hey! We just want to
say hi to everybody.

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:34.967
Visitor:
Nice to meet you.

00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:35.567
The President:
Good to see you!

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:36.367
You're a Malia?

00:04:36.367 --> 00:04:39.000
Visitor:
Can I ask for a fist bump?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.266
The President:
Boom!

00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:44.400
The President:
I think Bo thinks your
coat might be alive.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.433
That's not alive, Bo.

00:04:45.433 --> 00:04:47.166
Sit, sit. There you go.

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.667
Arjun:
It was a very cold day out
there and I was, many times,

00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:52.700
I was just turn around -- just
go and just come another time

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.533
but I'm so happy I did it.

00:04:54.533 --> 00:04:55.367
And it's amazing.

00:04:55.367 --> 00:04:57.233
Oh, my goodness.

00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:58.734
Elsa:
He gave me a hug!

00:04:58.734 --> 00:05:00.967
And I just, like,
forgot what's going on.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:04.533
Clement:
This is January and I could
say that this is a great year.

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:07.367
Narrator:
That night, the President and
First Lady got a chance to thank

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:10.900
staff and volunteers at a
party that marked the end

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.367
of the 57th Inauguration.

00:05:13.367 --> 00:05:16.133
Thursday marked the arrival of
the first snowfall of the season

00:05:16.133 --> 00:05:18.266
in the Nation's Capital while
the White House continued a

00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:20.700
series of conversations
on Google+.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.800
This time it was Vice President
Biden who hosted a Fireside

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.700
Hangout, a 21 century take on
FDR's famous radio addresses to

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.000
talk about reducing
gun violence.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.633
The Vice President:
And so make your voices heard!

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:34.200
That's one of the reasons I
wanted to be in this chat.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.967
There's tens of thousands
of people listening to this.

00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:39.133
I don't care which side
of the issue you're on.

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:42.133
Narrator:
Later, the President appeared
in the State Dining Room to

00:05:42.133 --> 00:05:44.500
introduce his nominee to be
the Chair of the Securities

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.767
and Exchange Commission,
Mary Jo White.

00:05:46.767 --> 00:05:50.033
And to announce that he'll
renominate Richard Cordray to

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:52.433
run the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau.

00:05:52.433 --> 00:05:55.567
Both Mary Jo and Rich have the
experience and passion which

00:05:55.567 --> 00:05:59.300
they'll need to implement Wall
Street reform and stand up for

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.200
American consumers
in Washington, D.C.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.233

And thanks again for checking

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.934
Volunteer:
This is going to protect
our hands even more.

00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:13.834
So these are gloves
for your hands.

00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:15.133
The President:
What are we protecting
our hands from?

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:17.200
Volunteer:
The stain will actually
stain your hands.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.700
The President:
So, like, when I put
my hand up tomorrow --

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.133
Volunteer:
Yes, you don't want stain.

00:06:21.133 --> 00:06:23.567
The President:
-- or on Monday they'll be,
like, hey, how come he's got --

00:06:23.567 --> 00:06:26.133
The First Lady:
Just don't be a wise quacker
and just put your gloves on.

00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:26.834
The President:
How come he's walnut?

00:06:26.834 --> 00:06:27.834
(laughter)
