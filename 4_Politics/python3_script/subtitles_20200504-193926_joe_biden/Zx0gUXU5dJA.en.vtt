00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:03.937
(church bells ringing)

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:06.973
- [Woman] Here in our
little neck of the woods,

00:00:06.973 --> 00:00:10.810
you can just look
around and see that

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:16.416
we show love to each other
in our area, with food.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:17.350
That's what we do.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.319
We get together, churches,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.691
baby showers, bridal
showers, birthdays,

00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:26.226
we're always eating.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.363
When you come to
our homes we say,

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:33.199
"Come on in, let me fix
you something to eat."

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.701
It's how we were raised.

00:00:37.504 --> 00:00:39.572
We don't get together
unless there's food.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.176
And usually, it's not
really good choices.

00:00:45.011 --> 00:00:46.479
I'm Laura Grueser,

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.448
and I'm the Community
Health Worker,

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:50.950
the lead at the Meigs
County Health Department.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.623
I was diagnosed as
being pre diabetic,

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.725
in 2012.

00:00:58.725 --> 00:01:02.062
I didn't understand really
what the big deal was.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.597
It wasn't until I started
doing all the research,

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:08.168
and I thought why
shouldn't I use

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.003
this knowledge that I've got.

00:01:10.003 --> 00:01:12.472
I can't teach somebody else,

00:01:12.472 --> 00:01:13.940
to live a healthier life,

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.710
and come home and eat
a bag of potato chips.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.779
That's not right,
I can't do that.

00:01:23.183 --> 00:01:25.985
One of the big things
in Meigs County is

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:27.554
the pride of the people here

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.355
and the independence.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:32.859
It's very very hard
for proud people,

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.362
to say I can't do
this, I need some help,

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:39.499
and so I tell them please
just give me three months.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.334
Give me three months
out of your life

00:01:41.334 --> 00:01:43.036
and listen to what I'm saying

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:44.571
and get with this program.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:47.507
If it doesn't work, and
you don't see any changes

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:48.408
in three months,

00:01:48.408 --> 00:01:49.976
I'll leave you alone,

00:01:49.976 --> 00:01:51.177
and you can go on.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.612
No one has ever done that.

00:01:55.982 --> 00:01:59.119
Every time I do an
intake, I always ask them,

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.454
"What do you think
caused your diabetes?"

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:04.224
and it doesn't matter
what their weight is,

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.959
or what their eating program is,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.594
it is always,

00:02:07.594 --> 00:02:10.530
because my dad had
it, or my mom had it,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.366
or my aunt had it, my
sister or my brother.

00:02:13.366 --> 00:02:14.934
So everyone feels as though,

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.669
I might as well just give it up

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.572
because dad had it
and he died from it.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.476
So when they're
given that diagnoses,

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.678
it's a very sad
thing to witness.

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:30.283
In pop, so now
knowledge is power,

00:02:30.283 --> 00:02:32.986
so now you can tell all
your family this too.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:36.055
So in one 20 ounce
bottle of Mountain Dew

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:39.058
there are more than
18 teaspoons of sugar.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:40.260
That's what it looks like.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.028
When your drinking a
bottle of Mountain Dew,

00:02:42.028 --> 00:02:44.230
your drinking that much sugar.

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.534
Isn't that crazy?

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:48.334
- Yeah!

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.437
- [Laura] And all pop
is about the same.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:55.909
Carbs in one cup of pineapple?

00:02:58.611 --> 00:03:00.613
- [Siri] 22 grams of
total carbohydrates

00:03:00.613 --> 00:03:02.015
in one cup chunks.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.383
- [Laura] Okay.

00:03:03.383 --> 00:03:04.884
Carbs in banana's?

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:08.421
One of the things that we do
in our diabetes education,

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:13.359
is we show patients how
to read food labels.

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.595
So one serving
size is half a cup

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:21.334
and there are four grams of
carbohydrates in half a cup.

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:25.972
So that's a good choice.

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:27.473
- Yeah.

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:30.143
- [Laura] That gives them
power over what their eating,

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.844
when they can make the choice,

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:33.046
do I put it in the cart

00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:34.280
or do I put it
back on the shelf.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.449
Here's one of the best
things you can eat.

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:38.585
The plums.

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:40.053
- Okay that's

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:42.155
- [Laura] Because one
plum only has eight grams

00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.290
of carbohydrates
in the whole thing.

00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:48.595
- [Carolyn] I found out
how much I didn't know,

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:50.830
about diabetes.

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.101
- [Carolyn] I didn't understand
about counting the carbs.

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:58.771
Watch your sweets,
watch the sugar intake.

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:02.442
Your fried foods, that
all affects your diet.

00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:04.944
- [Laura] Of those, three types.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.145
Which ones the best?

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.347
- [John] This one.
- [Laura] There you go.

00:04:07.347 --> 00:04:09.849
- [Carolyn] We're
learning I should say

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.884
to eat differently.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.189
- [Laura] They soak all
of these fruits in sugar.

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:18.024
Oh my goodness, I
can't even believe

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:21.361
that you picked that
up, that is evil.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.999
- [John] We don't even
want to talk about them.

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.000
(Laura laughing)

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.935
- [Laura] Where to now?

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:34.574
One of my biggest pet
peeves is with our labeling,

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:35.842
in the United States.

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:37.543
If it says sugar free,

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.779
my patients pull
that off the shelf,

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.247
put it in their cart

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:44.550
and think I can have eight
or 12 of these cookies

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.852
because their sugar free.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:49.222
Their not sugar free,
it's, it's not true.

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:51.858
A serving size is four cookies,

00:04:51.858 --> 00:04:54.327
and in four, those four cookies

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.363
their are 21 grams
of carbohydrates,

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:59.299
and it does have
the sugar alcohols,

00:04:59.299 --> 00:05:03.903
it has sorbitol, there's
sugar free in huge letters.

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.406
The game is rigged.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.343
Our labeling is
done in such a way,

00:05:10.343 --> 00:05:13.012
that it's almost a
lose lose situation,

00:05:14.414 --> 00:05:16.983
because people think that
they're doing so well,

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.584
but they're really not.

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.920
(Sad music)
