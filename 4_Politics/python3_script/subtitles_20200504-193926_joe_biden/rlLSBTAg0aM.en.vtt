00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.203
(applause)

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.754
The President: Thank you.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:56.055
Alright.

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.725
Let's bring this to order.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.376
Paul Ryan: Members
of Congress.

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.578
I have the high privilege,
and the distinct honor of

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.814
presenting to you the
President

00:01:20.814 --> 00:01:22.015
of the United States.

00:01:22.015 --> 00:01:24.918
(applause)

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:43.303
The President:
Thank you very much.

00:01:43.303 --> 00:01:45.171
Everybody, please
have a seat.

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.475
Thank you.

00:01:48.475 --> 00:01:53.046
Mr. Speaker, Mr.
Vice President,

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:59.452
Members of Congress,
my fellow Americans:

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:03.456
Tonight marks the eighth
year I've come here to

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:07.527
report on the
State of the Union.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:11.064
And for this final one,
I'm going to try to make

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:12.398
it shorter.

00:02:12.398 --> 00:02:15.435
(applause)

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.806
I know some of you are
antsy to get back to Iowa.

00:02:19.806 --> 00:02:22.642
(laughter)

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.718
I've been there.

00:02:31.718 --> 00:02:32.952
I'll be shaking
hands afterwards,

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.153
if you want some tips.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:37.557
(laughter)

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.129
I also understand that
because it's an election

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.766
season, expectations for
what we'll achieve this year

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:47.767
are low.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:51.704
Still, Mr. Speaker, I
appreciate the constructive

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:53.907
approach you and the other
leaders took at the end of

00:02:53.907 --> 00:02:57.844
last year to pass a budget
and make tax cuts permanent

00:02:57.844 --> 00:02:58.845
for working families.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:02.115
So I hope we can work
together this year on

00:03:02.115 --> 00:03:06.019
bipartisan priorities like
criminal justice reform,

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.354
(applause)

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:14.394
-- and helping people who
are battling prescription

00:03:14.394 --> 00:03:15.962
drug abuse.

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:19.465
(applause)

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:23.670
So, who knows.

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.206
We just might surprise
the cynics again.

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:31.277
But tonight, I want to go
easy on the traditional list

00:03:31.277 --> 00:03:34.380
of proposals for
the year ahead.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.683
Don't worry,
I've got plenty,

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:39.018
from helping students learn
to write computer code to

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:41.788
personalizing medical
treatments for patients.

00:03:41.788 --> 00:03:45.358
And I'll keep pushing for
progress on the work that

00:03:45.358 --> 00:03:47.393
still needs doing.

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.762
Fixing a broken
immigration system.

00:03:49.762 --> 00:03:53.066
(applause)

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:55.301
Protecting our kids
from gun violence.

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:57.637
(applause)

00:03:57.637 --> 00:03:59.105
Equal pay for equal work,

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:00.807
(applause)

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:04.477
paid leave, raising
the minimum wage.

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:08.147
(applause)

00:04:08.147 --> 00:04:12.719
All these things still
matter to hardworking

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.255
families; they are still
the right thing to do;

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:20.026
and I will not let up
until they get done.

00:04:20.026 --> 00:04:22.996
But for my final
address to this chamber,

00:04:22.996 --> 00:04:27.634
I don't want to talk
just about the next year.

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:31.938
I want to focus on the
next five years, ten years,

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:32.572
and beyond.

00:04:32.572 --> 00:04:36.109
I want to focus
on our future.

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:43.950
We live in a time of
extraordinary change -

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.219
change that's reshaping
the way we live,

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:50.323
the way we work, our planet
and our place in the world.

00:04:52.458 --> 00:04:54.594
It's change that
promises amazing medical

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:57.664
breakthroughs, but also
economic disruptions that

00:04:57.664 --> 00:04:59.666
strain working families.

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.903
It promises education for
girls in the most remote

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:07.573
villages, but also connects
terrorists plotting

00:05:07.573 --> 00:05:09.575
an ocean away.

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:13.846
It's change that can
broaden opportunity,

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:17.250
or widen inequality.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.484
And whether we
like it or not,

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:20.653
the pace of this change
will only accelerate.

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:30.129
America has been through big
changes before - wars and

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:34.467
depression, the
influx of immigrants,

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:36.469
workers fighting
for a fair deal,

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.939
and movements to
expand civil rights.

00:05:42.942 --> 00:05:46.379
Each time, there have been
those who told us to fear

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:50.683
the future; who claimed we
could slam the brakes on

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:55.354
change, promising to restore
past glory if we just got

00:05:55.354 --> 00:05:57.790
some group or idea that was
threatening America

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.792
under control.

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.930
And each time, we
overcame those fears.

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.701
We did not, in the
words of Lincoln,

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:11.237
adhere to the "dogmas
of the quiet past."

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:18.444
Instead we thought
anew, and acted anew.

00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:24.784
We made change work for us,
always extending America's

00:06:24.784 --> 00:06:27.620
promise outward, to
the next frontier,

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:29.622
to more and more people.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:37.163
And because we did - because
we saw opportunity where

00:06:37.163 --> 00:06:42.668
others saw only peril - we
emerged stronger and better

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:44.670
than before.

00:06:47.406 --> 00:06:50.877
What was true then
can be true now.

00:06:53.946 --> 00:06:59.218
Our unique strengths as a
nation - our optimism and

00:06:59.218 --> 00:07:04.257
work ethic, our spirit of
discovery and innovation,

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:10.797
our diversity and commitment
to the rule of law - these

00:07:10.797 --> 00:07:15.067
things give us everything
we need to ensure prosperity

00:07:15.067 --> 00:07:17.069
and security for
generations to come.

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:25.812
In fact, it's that spirit
that made the progress of

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:29.549
these past seven
years possible.

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:31.984
It's how we recovered from
the worst economic crisis

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.686
in generations.

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:36.155
(applause)

00:07:41.861 --> 00:07:43.863
It's how we reformed
our health care system,

00:07:43.863 --> 00:07:45.565
and reinvented
our energy sector;

00:07:45.565 --> 00:07:48.734
(applause)

00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:59.712
-- how we delivered more
care and benefits to our

00:07:59.712 --> 00:08:02.081
troops and veterans,

00:08:02.081 --> 00:08:05.418
(applause)

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:24.403
that's how we secured the
freedom in every state to

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.339
marry the person we love.

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:30.109
(applause)

00:08:38.217 --> 00:08:44.156
But such progress
is not inevitable.

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:50.062
It is the result of
choices we make together.

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:53.866
And we face such
choices right now.

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.738
Will we respond to the
changes of our time with

00:08:58.738 --> 00:09:02.041
fear, turning
inward as a nation,

00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:05.378
and turning against
each other as a people?

00:09:07.546 --> 00:09:10.950
Or will we face the future
with confidence in who we

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:15.588
are, what we stand for, and
the incredible things we can

00:09:15.588 --> 00:09:17.590
do together?

00:09:19.892 --> 00:09:21.894
So let's talk
about the future,

00:09:23.696 --> 00:09:27.600
and four big questions that
we as a country have to

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.337
answer - regardless of
who the next President is,

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:33.339
or who controls
the next Congress.

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:38.611
First, how do we give
everyone a fair shot at

00:09:38.611 --> 00:09:41.280
opportunity and security
in this new economy?

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.550
(applause)

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:55.194
Second, how do we make
technology work for us,

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:57.496
and not against us -
especially when it comes to

00:09:57.496 --> 00:10:00.733
solving urgent challenges
like climate change?

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:05.404
(applause)

00:10:05.404 --> 00:10:08.874
Third, how do we keep
America safe and lead the

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:13.012
world without becoming
its policeman?

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:17.249
(applause)

00:10:17.249 --> 00:10:21.354
And finally, how can we make
our politics reflect what's

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:24.056
best in us, and
not what's worst?

00:10:24.056 --> 00:10:28.361
(applause)

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:40.639
Let me start
with the economy,

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:46.512
and a basic fact: the
United States of America,

00:10:46.512 --> 00:10:49.548
right now, has
the strongest,

00:10:49.548 --> 00:10:52.518
most durable economy
in the world.

00:10:52.518 --> 00:10:55.554
(applause)

00:10:57.723 --> 00:10:59.258
We're in the middle of
the longest streak of

00:10:59.258 --> 00:11:02.228
private-sector job
creation in history.

00:11:02.228 --> 00:11:05.698
(applause)

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:16.809
More than 14
million new jobs;

00:11:16.809 --> 00:11:20.613
the strongest two years of
job growth since the '90s;

00:11:20.613 --> 00:11:24.483
an unemployment
rate cut in half.

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:27.286
Our auto industry just
had its best year ever.

00:11:27.286 --> 00:11:31.490
(applause)

00:11:36.295 --> 00:11:38.197
That's just part of a
manufacturing surge that has

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:42.501
created nearly 900,000 new
jobs in the past six years.

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:44.804
And we've done all this
while cutting our deficits

00:11:44.804 --> 00:11:45.938
by almost three-quarters.

00:11:45.938 --> 00:11:51.410
(applause)

00:11:56.749 --> 00:12:00.019
Anyone claiming that
America's economy is in

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:03.589
decline is peddling fiction.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:08.194
(applause)

00:12:08.194 --> 00:12:11.363
What is true - and the
reason that a lot of

00:12:11.363 --> 00:12:16.535
Americans feel anxious - is
that the economy has been

00:12:16.535 --> 00:12:21.107
changing in profound ways,
changes that started long

00:12:21.107 --> 00:12:25.244
before the Great Recession
hit and haven't let up.

00:12:27.847 --> 00:12:30.483
Today, technology doesn't
just replace jobs on the

00:12:30.483 --> 00:12:35.087
assembly line, but any job
where work can be automated.

00:12:37.756 --> 00:12:41.660
Companies in a global
economy can locate anywhere,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.662
and face tougher
competition.

00:12:45.898 --> 00:12:49.468
As a result, workers have
less leverage for a raise.

00:12:49.468 --> 00:12:52.905
Companies have less loyalty
to their communities.

00:12:52.905 --> 00:12:56.709
And more and more wealth and
income is concentrated at

00:12:56.709 --> 00:13:00.946
the very top.

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:04.783
All these trends have
squeezed workers,

00:13:04.783 --> 00:13:09.421
even when they have jobs;
even when the economy

00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:12.224
is growing.

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:14.426
It's made it harder for a
hardworking family to pull

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:18.063
itself out of poverty,
harder for young people to

00:13:18.063 --> 00:13:21.734
start on their careers,
and tougher for workers to

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:23.736
retire when they want to.

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:28.073
And although none of
these trends are unique to

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:32.611
America, they do offend our
uniquely American belief

00:13:32.611 --> 00:13:36.015
that everybody who works
hard should get a fair shot.

00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:44.723
For the past seven years,
our goal has been a growing

00:13:44.723 --> 00:13:50.429
economy that works
better for everybody.

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:52.598
We've made progress.

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:54.600
But we need to make more.

00:13:55.968 --> 00:13:57.970
And despite all the
political arguments we've

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:01.273
had these past few years,
there are some areas where

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:05.644
Americans broadly agree.

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:07.980
We agree that real
opportunity requires every

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:11.317
American to get the
education and training they

00:14:11.317 --> 00:14:13.319
need to land a
good-paying job.

00:14:15.054 --> 00:14:17.456
The bipartisan reform of
No Child Left Behind was an

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:19.792
important start,
and together,

00:14:19.792 --> 00:14:22.461
we've increased early
childhood education,

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:24.463
lifted high school
graduation rates to new

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:28.033
highs, and boosted graduates
in fields like engineering.

00:14:30.736 --> 00:14:32.738
In the coming years,
we should build on that

00:14:32.738 --> 00:14:36.809
progress, by providing
Pre-K for all,

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:42.881
(applause)

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:52.324
-- offering every student
the hands-on computer

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:55.561
science and math classes
that make them job-ready on

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:58.797
day one, and we should
recruit and support more

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:00.899
great teachers for our kids.

00:15:00.899 --> 00:15:03.602
(applause)

00:15:06.272 --> 00:15:11.977
And we have to make college
affordable for every American.

00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:14.446
(applause)

00:15:26.292 --> 00:15:28.193
Because no hardworking
student should be stuck in

00:15:28.193 --> 00:15:30.029
the red.

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:33.032
We've already reduced
student loan payments to ten

00:15:33.032 --> 00:15:36.769
percent of a
borrower's income.

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:40.472
Now, we've actually got to
cut the cost of college.

00:15:40.472 --> 00:15:43.542
(applause)

00:15:45.244 --> 00:15:48.147
Providing two years of
community college at no cost

00:15:48.147 --> 00:15:50.683
for every responsible
student is one of the best

00:15:50.683 --> 00:15:52.885
ways to do that, and I'm
going to keep fighting to

00:15:52.885 --> 00:15:53.986
get that started this year.

00:15:53.986 --> 00:15:55.454
(applause)

00:15:55.454 --> 00:16:01.427
Of course, a great education
isn't all we need in this

00:16:09.568 --> 00:16:11.737
new economy.

00:16:11.737 --> 00:16:14.473
We also need benefits and
protections that provide a

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.674
basic measure of security.

00:16:15.674 --> 00:16:20.746
After all, it's not much of
a stretch to say that some

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.748
of the only people in
America who are going to

00:16:22.748 --> 00:16:25.684
work the same job,
in the same place,

00:16:25.684 --> 00:16:28.887
with a health and retirement
package, for 30 years,

00:16:28.887 --> 00:16:30.689
are sitting in this chamber.

00:16:30.689 --> 00:16:33.325
(laughter)

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:38.664
For everyone else,
especially folks in their

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:42.768
forties and fifties, saving
for retirement or bouncing

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:45.003
back from job loss has
gotten a lot tougher.

00:16:47.072 --> 00:16:49.408
Americans understand that at
some point in their careers,

00:16:49.408 --> 00:16:51.410
they may have to
retool and retrain.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:55.581
But they shouldn't lose what
they've already worked so

00:16:55.581 --> 00:16:56.582
hard to build.

00:16:56.582 --> 00:17:01.787
That's why Social Security
and Medicare are more

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:03.789
important than ever; we
shouldn't weaken them,

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:04.790
we should strengthen them.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:05.791
(applause)

00:17:05.791 --> 00:17:11.797
And for Americans
short of retirement,

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:28.046
basic benefits should be
just as mobile as everything

00:17:28.046 --> 00:17:31.183
else is today.

00:17:31.183 --> 00:17:35.354
That's what the Affordable
Care Act is all about.

00:17:35.354 --> 00:17:38.457
It's about filling the gaps
in employer-based care so

00:17:38.457 --> 00:17:42.628
that when we lose a job,
or go back to school,

00:17:42.628 --> 00:17:50.202
or start that new business,
we'll still have coverage.

00:17:50.202 --> 00:17:53.472
Nearly eighteen million
have gained coverage so far.

00:17:53.472 --> 00:17:57.376
(applause)

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.119
Health care
inflation has slowed.

00:18:07.119 --> 00:18:09.922
And our businesses have
created jobs every single

00:18:09.922 --> 00:18:12.357
month since it became law.

00:18:12.357 --> 00:18:16.762
Now, I'm guessing we won't
agree on health care

00:18:16.762 --> 00:18:18.330
anytime soon.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:19.998
(laughter)

00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:32.578
But there should be other
ways both parties can work

00:18:32.578 --> 00:18:36.281
together to improve
economic security.

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:41.453
Say a hardworking American
loses his job - we shouldn't

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:44.156
just make sure he can get
unemployment insurance;

00:18:44.156 --> 00:18:47.593
we should make sure that
program encourages him to

00:18:47.593 --> 00:18:51.096
retrain for a business
that's ready to hire him.

00:18:51.096 --> 00:18:53.832
If that new job
doesn't pay as much,

00:18:53.832 --> 00:18:56.168
there should be a system of
wage insurance in place so

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:59.972
that he can still
pay his bills.

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:02.140
And even if he's
going from job to job,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.543
he should still be able to
save for retirement and take

00:19:04.543 --> 00:19:07.246
his savings with him.

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:09.515
That's the way we make the
new economy work better

00:19:09.515 --> 00:19:11.483
for everyone.

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:16.822
I also know Speaker Ryan has
talked about his interest in

00:19:16.822 --> 00:19:19.224
tackling poverty.

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:22.861
America is about giving
everybody willing to work a

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:26.532
hand up, and I'd welcome
a serious discussion about

00:19:26.532 --> 00:19:28.534
strategies we
can all support,

00:19:28.534 --> 00:19:31.670
like expanding tax cuts for
low-income workers

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.739
who don't have children.

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:37.109
(applause)

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:48.720
But there are other areas
where it's been more

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.492
difficult to find agreement
over the last seven years -

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:56.094
and a lot of them fall under the category of what role

00:19:56.094 --> 00:19:57.396
the government should play in

00:19:57.396 --> 00:20:01.466
making sure the system's
not rigged in favor of the

00:20:01.466 --> 00:20:03.502
wealthiest and
biggest corporations.

00:20:03.502 --> 00:20:07.639
(applause)

00:20:07.639 --> 00:20:10.776
It's an honest disagreement.

00:20:10.776 --> 00:20:14.513
And the American people
have a choice to make.

00:20:14.513 --> 00:20:17.816
I believe a thriving private
sector is the lifeblood of

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:20.185
our economy.

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:22.988
I think there are outdated
regulations that need to be

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:25.657
changed, and there's red
tape that needs to be cut.

00:20:25.657 --> 00:20:28.026
(applause)

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:50.082
But after years of
record corporate profits,

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:55.053
working families won't get
more opportunity or bigger

00:20:55.053 --> 00:20:59.424
paychecks by letting big
banks or big oil or hedge

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:02.928
funds make their own rules
at everybody else's expense.

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:05.831
(applause)

00:21:11.236 --> 00:21:13.538
Middle-class families are
not going to feel more

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:16.541
secure because a lot of
times we allow attacks on

00:21:16.541 --> 00:21:20.412
collective bargaining
to go unanswered.

00:21:20.412 --> 00:21:23.882
Food Stamp recipients didn't
cause the financial crisis;

00:21:23.882 --> 00:21:26.418
recklessness on
Wall Street did.

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:29.988
(applause)

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:40.432
Immigrants aren't the
principal reason wages

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:42.567
haven't gone up enough;
those decisions are made in

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:46.271
the boardrooms that too
often put quarterly earnings

00:21:46.271 --> 00:21:48.273
over long-term returns.

00:21:49.641 --> 00:21:51.877
It's sure not the average
family watching tonight that

00:21:51.877 --> 00:21:53.912
avoids paying taxes
through offshore accounts.

00:21:57.716 --> 00:22:01.853
The point is, I believe,
in this new economy,

00:22:01.853 --> 00:22:05.724
workers and start-ups and
small businesses need more

00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:07.526
of a voice, not less.

00:22:07.526 --> 00:22:10.028
The rules should
work for them.

00:22:13.832 --> 00:22:17.035
And this year I plan to
lift up the many businesses

00:22:17.035 --> 00:22:21.306
who've figured out that
doing right by their workers

00:22:21.306 --> 00:22:23.141
or their customers, or their communities,

00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:26.578
ends up being good for
their shareholders,

00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:28.380
and I want to spread
those best practices

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.915
across America.

00:22:29.915 --> 00:22:31.750
That's a part of
a brighter future.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:34.453
(applause)

00:22:40.025 --> 00:22:44.062
In fact, many of our best
corporate citizens are also

00:22:44.062 --> 00:22:46.098
our most creative.

00:22:46.098 --> 00:22:49.568
This brings me to the second
big question we have to

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:53.739
answer as a country: how do
we reignite that spirit of

00:22:53.739 --> 00:22:55.807
innovation to meet our
biggest challenges?

00:22:58.276 --> 00:23:03.715
Sixty years ago, when the
Russians beat us into space,

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.751
we didn't deny
Sputnik was up there.

00:23:05.751 --> 00:23:08.353
(laughter)

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:10.689
We didn't argue
about the science,

00:23:10.689 --> 00:23:13.658
or shrink our research
and development budget.

00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:16.361
We built a space program
almost overnight,

00:23:16.361 --> 00:23:18.697
and twelve years later, we
were walking on the moon.

00:23:18.697 --> 00:23:24.703
(applause)

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:34.513
That spirit of
discovery is in our DNA.

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:47.993
We're Thomas Edison and the
Wright Brothers and George

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:48.994
Washington Carver.

00:23:48.994 --> 00:23:54.099
We're Grace Hopper and
Katherine Johnson

00:23:54.099 --> 00:23:55.100
and Sally Ride.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:24:01.306
We're every immigrant and
entrepreneur from Boston to

00:24:01.306 --> 00:24:09.147
Austin to Silicon Valley
racing to shape a better world.

00:24:09.147 --> 00:24:10.148
(applause)

00:24:10.148 --> 00:24:11.216
And over the
past seven years,

00:24:11.216 --> 00:24:12.184
we've nurtured that spirit.

00:24:12.184 --> 00:24:15.921
We've protected
an open internet,

00:24:15.921 --> 00:24:18.523
and taken bold new steps
to get more students and

00:24:18.523 --> 00:24:19.958
low-income Americans online.

00:24:19.958 --> 00:24:21.126
(applause)

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:23.895
We've launched
next-generation

00:24:23.895 --> 00:24:27.399
manufacturing hubs, and
online tools that give an

00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:29.568
entrepreneur everything
he or she needs to start a

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:31.937
business in a single day.

00:24:34.206 --> 00:24:36.208
But we can do so much more.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:42.247
Last year, Vice President
Biden said that with a new

00:24:42.247 --> 00:24:45.584
moonshot, America
can cure cancer.

00:24:45.584 --> 00:24:48.386
Last month, he worked
with this Congress to give

00:24:48.386 --> 00:24:51.923
scientists at the National
Institutes of Health the

00:24:51.923 --> 00:24:54.392
strongest resources they've
had in over a decade.

00:24:54.392 --> 00:25:01.333
(applause)

00:25:01.333 --> 00:25:07.339
Tonight, I'm announcing a
new national effort to get

00:25:18.183 --> 00:25:19.184
it done.

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:21.319
And because he's gone to
the mat for all of us,

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.688
on so many issues over
the past forty years,

00:25:23.688 --> 00:25:25.690
I'm putting Joe in charge
of Mission Control.

00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:28.560
(applause)

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.595
For the loved ones
we've all lost,

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:36.601
for the family we
can still save,

00:25:39.271 --> 00:25:45.277
let's make America the
country that cures cancer

00:25:49.180 --> 00:25:54.152
once and for all.

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:55.387
(applause)

00:25:55.387 --> 00:26:00.659
Medical research
is critical.

00:26:00.659 --> 00:26:03.662
We need the same level of
commitment when it comes to

00:26:03.662 --> 00:26:05.664
developing clean
energy sources.

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:08.667
(applause)

00:26:08.667 --> 00:26:14.472
Look, if anybody still
wants to dispute the science

00:26:14.472 --> 00:26:17.509
around climate
change, have at it.

00:26:17.509 --> 00:26:21.546
You'll be pretty lonely,
because you'll be debating

00:26:21.546 --> 00:26:24.316
our military, most of
America's business leaders,

00:26:24.316 --> 00:26:26.484
the majority of the
American people,

00:26:26.484 --> 00:26:29.020
almost the entire
scientific community,

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.089
and 200 nations around
the world who agree it's a

00:26:31.089 --> 00:26:35.393
problem and intend
to solve it.

00:26:35.393 --> 00:26:38.229
(applause)

00:26:38.229 --> 00:26:44.169
But even if the planet
wasn't at stake;

00:26:44.169 --> 00:26:48.606
even if 2014 wasn't the
warmest year on record -

00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:54.446
until 2015 turned out even
hotter - why would we want

00:26:54.446 --> 00:26:58.149
to pass up the chance for
American businesses to

00:26:58.149 --> 00:27:05.190
produce and sell the
energy of the future?

00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:11.196
(applause)

00:27:14.165 --> 00:27:17.635
Seven years ago, we made the
single biggest investment in

00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:19.637
clean energy in our history.

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.409
Here are the results.

00:27:24.409 --> 00:27:27.212
In fields from
Iowa to Texas,

00:27:27.212 --> 00:27:29.314
wind power is now
cheaper than dirtier,

00:27:29.314 --> 00:27:30.315
conventional power.

00:27:30.315 --> 00:27:34.486
On rooftops from
Arizona to New York,

00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:37.355
solar is saving Americans
tens of millions of dollars

00:27:37.355 --> 00:27:39.457
a year on their
energy bills,

00:27:39.457 --> 00:27:43.461
and employs more Americans
than coal - in jobs that pay

00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:46.031
better than average.

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:48.366
We're taking steps to give
homeowners the freedom to

00:27:48.366 --> 00:27:51.002
generate and store their
own energy - something

00:27:51.002 --> 00:27:55.173
environmentalists and Tea
Partiers have teamed up

00:27:55.173 --> 00:27:57.575
to support.

00:27:57.575 --> 00:28:00.211
Meanwhile, we've cut our
imports of foreign oil by

00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:04.115
nearly sixty percent, and
cut carbon pollution more

00:28:04.115 --> 00:28:10.088
than any other
country on Earth.

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:20.698
(applause)

00:28:20.698 --> 00:28:28.306
Gas under two bucks a
gallon ain't bad, either.

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:30.008
(laughter)

00:28:30.008 --> 00:28:32.911
Now we've got to accelerate
the transition away

00:28:32.911 --> 00:28:38.616
from dirty energy.

00:28:38.616 --> 00:28:40.151
Rather than
subsidize the past,

00:28:40.151 --> 00:28:43.154
we should invest in the
future - especially in

00:28:43.154 --> 00:28:46.091
communities that
rely on fossil fuels.

00:28:46.091 --> 00:28:52.063
That's why I'm going to push
to change the way we manage

00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:57.402
our oil and coal resources,
so that they better reflect

00:28:57.402 --> 00:29:00.839
the costs they impose on
taxpayers and our planet.

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:05.310
That way, we put money back
into those communities and

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:08.012
put tens of thousands of
Americans to work building a

00:29:08.012 --> 00:29:10.048
21st century
transportation system.

00:29:10.048 --> 00:29:16.054
(applause)

00:29:23.561 --> 00:29:28.099
None of this will happen
overnight, and yes,

00:29:28.099 --> 00:29:31.035
there are plenty of
entrenched interests who

00:29:31.035 --> 00:29:34.239
want to protect
the status quo.

00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:38.743
But the jobs we'll create,
the money we'll save,

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:42.247
and the planet we'll
preserve - that's the kind

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:45.416
of future our kids
and grandkids deserve.

00:29:45.416 --> 00:29:49.521
And it's within our grasp.

00:29:49.521 --> 00:29:52.123
Climate change is just one
of many issues where our

00:29:52.123 --> 00:29:55.727
security is linked to
the rest of the world.

00:29:55.727 --> 00:30:00.999
And that's why the third big
question we have to answer

00:30:00.999 --> 00:30:04.969
is how to keep America safe
and strong without either

00:30:04.969 --> 00:30:08.206
isolating ourselves or
trying to nation-build

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:10.208
everywhere
there's a problem.

00:30:11.943 --> 00:30:14.546
I told you earlier all the
talk of America's economic

00:30:14.546 --> 00:30:18.917
decline is
political hot air.

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:21.386
Well, so is all the rhetoric
you hear about our enemies

00:30:21.386 --> 00:30:23.621
getting stronger and
America getting weaker.

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:31.696
The United States of America
is the most powerful nation

00:30:31.696 --> 00:30:32.664
on Earth.

00:30:32.664 --> 00:30:38.236
Period.

00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:44.442
(applause)

00:30:44.442 --> 00:30:51.849
It's not even close.

00:30:51.849 --> 00:30:53.384
(applause)

00:30:53.384 --> 00:30:56.354
We spend more on our
military than the next eight

00:30:56.354 --> 00:30:59.224
nations combined.

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.593
Our troops are the finest
fighting force in the

00:31:01.593 --> 00:31:02.594
history of the world.

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:03.595
(applause)

00:31:03.595 --> 00:31:09.601
No nation dares to attack us
or our allies because they

00:31:26.251 --> 00:31:28.253
know that's the
path to ruin.

00:31:30.255 --> 00:31:32.924
Surveys show our standing
around the world is higher

00:31:32.924 --> 00:31:34.926
than when I was
elected to this office,

00:31:34.926 --> 00:31:38.596
and when it comes to every
important international

00:31:38.596 --> 00:31:42.600
issue, people of the world
do not look to Beijing or

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.402
Moscow to lead
- they call us.

00:31:44.402 --> 00:31:50.408
(applause)

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:10.161
As someone who begins every
day with an intelligence

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:13.798
briefing, I know this
is a dangerous time.

00:32:16.401 --> 00:32:19.203
But that's not because of
diminished American strength

00:32:19.203 --> 00:32:20.805
or some looming superpower.

00:32:20.805 --> 00:32:27.345
In today's world, we're
threatened less by evil

00:32:27.345 --> 00:32:32.583
empires and more
by failing states.

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:37.355
The Middle East is going
through a transformation

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:40.124
that will play out
for a generation,

00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:42.360
rooted in conflicts that
date back millennia.

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:50.301
Economic headwinds blow
from a Chinese economy

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:55.373
in transition.

00:32:55.373 --> 00:32:59.977
Even as their
economy contracts,

00:32:59.977 --> 00:33:06.184
Russia is pouring resources
to prop up Ukraine and Syria

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:09.854
- states they see slipping
away from their orbit.

00:33:12.423 --> 00:33:14.992
And the international system
we built after World War II

00:33:14.992 --> 00:33:18.162
is now struggling to keep
pace with this new reality.

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:27.572
It's up to us to help
remake that system.

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:33.544
And that means we have
to set priorities.

00:33:36.147 --> 00:33:38.216
Priority number one is
protecting the American

00:33:38.216 --> 00:33:40.485
people and going after
terrorist networks.

00:33:40.485 --> 00:33:41.486
(applause)

00:33:41.486 --> 00:33:47.492
Both al Qaeda and now ISIL
pose a direct threat to our

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:03.508
people, because
in today's world,

00:34:03.508 --> 00:34:06.844
even a handful of terrorists
who place no value on human

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:11.716
life, including their own,
can do a lot of damage.

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:13.718
They use the Internet
to poison the minds of

00:34:13.718 --> 00:34:15.319
individuals inside
our country;

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:21.325
they undermine our allies.

00:34:26.431 --> 00:34:30.501
But as we focus on
destroying ISIL,

00:34:30.501 --> 00:34:35.206
over-the-top claims that
this is World War III just

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:38.242
play into their hands.

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:42.346
Masses of fighters on the
back of pickup trucks and

00:34:42.346 --> 00:34:47.919
twisted souls plotting in
apartments or garages pose

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.754
an enormous danger to
civilians

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:52.557
and must be stopped.

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:55.026
But they do not threaten
our national existence.

00:34:55.026 --> 00:35:01.432
That's the story
ISIL wants to tell;

00:35:01.432 --> 00:35:05.102
that's the kind of
propaganda they use to recruit.

00:35:07.405 --> 00:35:10.775
We don't need to build
them up to show that we're

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:17.148
serious, nor do we need to
push away vital allies in

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:20.618
this fight by echoing
the lie that ISIL is

00:35:20.618 --> 00:35:24.055
representative of one of the
world's largest religions.

00:35:24.055 --> 00:35:25.056
(applause)

00:35:25.056 --> 00:35:31.028
We just need to call them
what they are - killers and

00:35:43.941 --> 00:35:47.778
fanatics who have to be
rooted out, hunted down,

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:52.450
and destroyed.

00:35:52.450 --> 00:35:54.752
(applause)

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:59.724
That's exactly
what we are doing.

00:35:59.724 --> 00:36:02.760
For more than a year,
America has led a coalition

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:07.031
of more than 60 countries
to cut off ISIL's financing,

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:10.234
disrupt their plots, stop
the flow of terrorist

00:36:10.234 --> 00:36:15.172
fighters, and stamp out
their vicious ideology.

00:36:15.172 --> 00:36:17.174
With nearly 10,000
air strikes,

00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:19.810
we are taking out their
leadership, their oil,

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:23.614
their training camps,
and their weapons.

00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:26.584
We are training, arming, and
supporting forces who are

00:36:26.584 --> 00:36:30.054
steadily reclaiming
territory in Iraq and Syria.

00:36:32.757 --> 00:36:35.793
If this Congress is serious
about winning this war,

00:36:35.793 --> 00:36:38.462
and wants to send a message
to our troops and the world,

00:36:38.462 --> 00:36:41.632
you should finally authorize
the use of military force

00:36:41.632 --> 00:36:42.633
against ISIL.

00:36:42.633 --> 00:36:43.634
Take a vote.

00:36:43.634 --> 00:36:46.504
(applause)

00:36:56.614 --> 00:37:00.051
But the American people
should know that with or

00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:03.020
without
Congressional action,

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.990
ISIL will learn the same
lessons as terrorists

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:08.726
before them.

00:37:08.726 --> 00:37:11.963
If you doubt America's
commitment - or mine - to

00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:14.365
see that justice is done,
ask Osama bin Laden.

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:15.566
(applause)

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:21.572
Ask the leader of
al Qaeda in Yemen,

00:37:25.242 --> 00:37:29.213
who was taken out last year,
or the perpetrator of the

00:37:29.213 --> 00:37:33.851
Benghazi attacks, who
sits in a prison cell.

00:37:33.851 --> 00:37:36.654
When you come after
Americans, we go after you.

00:37:36.654 --> 00:37:39.357
It may take time, but
we have long memories,

00:37:39.357 --> 00:37:41.058
and our reach has no limit.

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:47.064
(applause)

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:58.442
Our foreign policy must be
focused on the threat from

00:37:58.442 --> 00:38:01.979
ISIL and al Qaeda, but
it can't stop there.

00:38:04.315 --> 00:38:11.455
For even without ISIL,
instability will continue

00:38:11.455 --> 00:38:15.259
for decades in many parts
of the world - in the Middle

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:17.962
East, in Afghanistan
and Pakistan,

00:38:17.962 --> 00:38:25.202
in parts of Central
America, Africa and Asia.

00:38:25.202 --> 00:38:28.906
Some of these places may
become safe havens for new

00:38:28.906 --> 00:38:33.544
terrorist networks; others
will fall victim to ethnic

00:38:33.544 --> 00:38:38.349
conflict, or famine, feeding
the next wave of refugees.

00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:45.656
The world will look to us to
help solve these problems,

00:38:45.656 --> 00:38:49.260
and our answer needs to
be more than tough talk or

00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.562
calls to carpet
bomb civilians.

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:56.067
That may work as
a TV sound bite,

00:38:56.067 --> 00:38:58.669
but it doesn't pass
muster on the world stage.

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:06.177
We also can't try to take
over and rebuild every

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:08.412
country that
falls into crisis.

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:16.987
That's not leadership;
that's a recipe for

00:39:16.987 --> 00:39:21.325
quagmire, spilling American
blood and treasure that

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:25.196
ultimately weakens us.

00:39:25.196 --> 00:39:31.168
It's the lesson of Vietnam,
of Iraq - and we should have

00:39:35.706 --> 00:39:41.011
learned it by now.

00:39:41.011 --> 00:39:42.480
(applause)

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.183
Fortunately, there's
a smarter approach,

00:39:46.183 --> 00:39:49.253
a patient and disciplined
strategy that uses every

00:39:49.253 --> 00:39:52.523
element of our
national power.

00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:57.194
It says America will always
act, alone if necessary,

00:39:57.194 --> 00:40:00.297
to protect our people
and our allies;

00:40:00.297 --> 00:40:03.734
but on issues of
global concern,

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:07.371
we will mobilize the
world to work with us,

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:09.373
and make sure other
countries pull their own weight.

00:40:11.942 --> 00:40:14.111
That's our approach to
conflicts like Syria,

00:40:14.111 --> 00:40:16.547
where we're partnering with
local forces and leading

00:40:16.547 --> 00:40:20.151
international efforts to
help that broken society

00:40:20.151 --> 00:40:24.021
pursue a lasting peace.

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:26.123
That's why we built
a global coalition,

00:40:26.123 --> 00:40:28.425
with sanctions and
principled diplomacy,

00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:30.795
to prevent a
nuclear-armed Iran.

00:40:30.795 --> 00:40:34.598
As we speak, Iran has rolled
back its nuclear program,

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:36.700
shipped out its
uranium stockpile,

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:41.839
and the world has
avoided another war.

00:40:41.839 --> 00:40:45.476
(applause)

00:40:45.476 --> 00:40:51.916
That's how we stopped the
spread of Ebola in West Africa.

00:40:51.916 --> 00:40:57.555
(applause)

00:40:57.555 --> 00:41:01.892
Our military, our doctors,
and our development workers

00:41:01.892 --> 00:41:07.264
set up the platform that
allowed other countries to

00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:11.735
join us in stamping
out that epidemic.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:21.812
That's how we forged a
Trans-Pacific Partnership to

00:41:21.812 --> 00:41:24.181
open markets, protect
workers and the environment,

00:41:24.181 --> 00:41:27.618
and advance American
leadership in Asia.

00:41:27.618 --> 00:41:31.622
It cuts 18,000 taxes on
products Made in America,

00:41:31.622 --> 00:41:32.990
and supports more good jobs.

00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:40.030
With TPP, China doesn't set
the rules in that region,

00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:41.031
we do.

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:43.567
You want to show our
strength in this century?

00:41:43.567 --> 00:41:44.635
Approve this agreement.

00:41:44.635 --> 00:41:46.637
Give us the tools
to enforce it.

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:47.638
(applause)

00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:53.644
Fifty years of isolating
Cuba had failed to promote

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:05.522
democracy, setting us
back in Latin America.

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:10.594
That's why we restored
diplomatic relations,

00:42:10.594 --> 00:42:12.563
opened the door to
travel and commerce,

00:42:12.563 --> 00:42:17.534
and positioned ourselves
to improve the lives

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:20.404
of the Cuban people.

00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:21.405
(applause)

00:42:21.405 --> 00:42:25.843
You want to consolidate our
leadership and credibility

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:27.845
in the hemisphere?

00:42:27.845 --> 00:42:29.914
Recognize that the
Cold War is over.

00:42:29.914 --> 00:42:30.915
Lift the embargo.

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:36.020
(applause)

00:42:43.827 --> 00:42:46.931
American leadership in the
21st century is not a choice

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:50.901
between ignoring the rest of
the world - except when we

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:54.571
kill terrorists; or
occupying and rebuilding

00:42:54.571 --> 00:42:58.342
whatever society
is unraveling.

00:42:58.342 --> 00:43:01.312
Leadership means a wise
application of military

00:43:01.312 --> 00:43:04.748
power, and rallying the
world behind causes

00:43:04.748 --> 00:43:06.650
that are right.

00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:09.520
It means seeing our foreign
assistance as part of our

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.055
national security,
not charity.

00:43:11.055 --> 00:43:14.558
When we lead nearly
200 nations to the most

00:43:14.558 --> 00:43:18.362
ambitious agreement in
history to fight climate

00:43:18.362 --> 00:43:20.764
change - that helps
vulnerable countries,

00:43:20.764 --> 00:43:23.734
but it also protects
our children.

00:43:23.734 --> 00:43:26.637
When we help Ukraine
defend its democracy,

00:43:26.637 --> 00:43:29.840
or Colombia resolve
a decades-long war,

00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:32.710
that strengthens the
international order

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.379
we depend upon.

00:43:35.379 --> 00:43:39.483
When we help African
countries feed their people

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:40.484
and care for the sick.

00:43:40.484 --> 00:43:42.886
(applause)

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:46.623
It's the right thing to do.

00:43:46.623 --> 00:43:48.859
And it prevents the next
pandemic from reaching

00:43:48.859 --> 00:43:50.160
our shores.

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:53.764
Right now, we are on track
to end the scourge of

00:43:53.764 --> 00:44:01.438
HIV/AIDS, and we have the
capacity to accomplish the

00:44:01.438 --> 00:44:09.113
same thing with malaria -
something I'll be pushing

00:44:09.113 --> 00:44:14.218
this Congress to
fund this year.

00:44:14.218 --> 00:44:15.219
(applause)

00:44:15.219 --> 00:44:17.621
That's American strength.

00:44:17.621 --> 00:44:20.457
That's American leadership.

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:23.727
And that kind of leadership
depends on the power

00:44:23.727 --> 00:44:24.728
of our example.

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:29.066
That is why I will keep
working to shut down the

00:44:29.066 --> 00:44:32.903
prison at Guantanamo: it's
expensive, it's unnecessary,

00:44:32.903 --> 00:44:38.542
and it only serves as a
recruitment brochure

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:42.513
for our enemies.

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:43.914
(applause)

00:44:43.914 --> 00:44:51.588
That's why we need to reject
any politics that targets

00:44:51.588 --> 00:44:53.590
people because of
race or religion.

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:59.596
(applause)

00:45:11.275 --> 00:45:14.711
This is not a matter of
political correctness.

00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:18.949
It's a matter of
understanding

00:45:18.949 --> 00:45:23.520
what makes us strong.

00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:27.591
The world respects us
not just for our arsenal;

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:36.200
it respects us for our
diversity and our openness

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:38.202
and the way we
respect every faith.

00:45:41.305 --> 00:45:44.808
His Holiness, Pope Francis,
told this body from the very

00:45:44.808 --> 00:45:49.546
spot I stand tonight that
"to imitate the hatred and

00:45:49.546 --> 00:45:52.649
violence of tyrants and
murderers is the best way to

00:45:52.649 --> 00:45:54.651
take their place."

00:45:57.921 --> 00:46:02.092
When politicians
insult Muslims,

00:46:02.092 --> 00:46:04.361
when a mosque is vandalized,
or a kid bullied,

00:46:04.361 --> 00:46:10.334
that doesn't make us safer.

00:46:18.008 --> 00:46:23.814
That's not telling
it like it is.

00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:25.716
It's just wrong.

00:46:25.716 --> 00:46:27.918
It diminishes us in
the eyes of the world.

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:29.186
(applause)

00:46:29.186 --> 00:46:35.092
It makes it harder
to achieve our goals.

00:46:35.092 --> 00:46:41.098
And it betrays who
we are as a country.

00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:54.545
(applause)

00:46:54.545 --> 00:47:00.684
"We the People."

00:47:00.684 --> 00:47:05.822
Our Constitution begins with
those three simple words,

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:08.525
words we've come to
recognize mean all the

00:47:08.525 --> 00:47:13.530
people, not just some; words
that insist we rise

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.532
and fall together.

00:47:22.906 --> 00:47:24.174
That brings me
to the fourth,

00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:26.543
and maybe the most important
thing I want to say tonight.

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:32.516
The future we want -
opportunity and security for

00:47:36.386 --> 00:47:41.124
our families; a rising
standard of living and a

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:47.064
sustainable, peaceful planet
for our kids - all that is

00:47:47.064 --> 00:47:49.066
within our reach.

00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:53.003
But it will only happen
if we work together.

00:47:55.105 --> 00:47:58.575
It will only happen if
we can have rational,

00:47:58.575 --> 00:47:59.643
constructive debates.

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:05.015
It will only happen if
we fix our politics.

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:11.121
A better politics doesn't
mean we have to agree

00:48:11.121 --> 00:48:12.122
on everything.

00:48:12.122 --> 00:48:15.525
This is a big country,
with different regions and

00:48:15.525 --> 00:48:17.861
attitudes and interests.

00:48:17.861 --> 00:48:20.230
That's one of our
strengths, too.

00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:22.933
Our Founders distributed
power between states and

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:27.738
branches of government,
and expected us to argue,

00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:32.809
just as they did, over
the size and shape of

00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:36.947
government, over commerce
and foreign relations,

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:40.183
over the meaning of liberty
and the imperatives of security.

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:49.092
But democracy does require
basic bonds of trust between

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:51.595
its citizens.

00:48:51.595 --> 00:48:56.933
It doesn't work if we think
the people who disagree with

00:48:56.933 --> 00:48:58.835
us are all
motivated by malice,

00:48:58.835 --> 00:49:04.808
or that our political
opponents are unpatriotic.

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:17.321
Democracy grinds to a halt
without a willingness to

00:49:17.321 --> 00:49:23.694
compromise; or when even
basic facts are contested,

00:49:23.694 --> 00:49:26.330
and we listen only to
those who agree with us.

00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:33.370
Our public life withers when
only the most extreme voices

00:49:33.370 --> 00:49:35.372
get attention.

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:39.910
Most of all, democracy
breaks down when the average

00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:43.747
person feels their
voice doesn't matter;

00:49:43.747 --> 00:49:46.049
that the system is rigged
in favor of the rich or the

00:49:46.049 --> 00:49:52.356
powerful or some
narrow interest.

00:49:52.356 --> 00:49:54.324
Too many Americans feel
that way right now.

00:49:56.660 --> 00:50:00.030
It's one of the few regrets
of my presidency - that the

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.933
rancor and suspicion between
the parties has gotten worse

00:50:02.933 --> 00:50:03.934
instead of better.

00:50:03.934 --> 00:50:09.272
There's no doubt a president
with the gifts of Lincoln or

00:50:09.272 --> 00:50:13.009
Roosevelt might have
better bridged the divide,

00:50:13.009 --> 00:50:15.679
and I guarantee I'll keep
trying to be better so long

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:17.681
as I hold this office.

00:50:19.349 --> 00:50:23.387
But, my fellow Americans,
this cannot be my task - or

00:50:23.387 --> 00:50:25.389
any President's - alone.

00:50:27.324 --> 00:50:29.326
There are a whole lot of
folks in this chamber who

00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:34.965
would like to see
more cooperation,

00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:38.068
a more elevated
debate in Washington,

00:50:38.068 --> 00:50:41.671
but feel trapped by the
demands of getting elected.

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:49.646
I know; you've told me.

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:05.896
And if we want a
better politics,

00:51:05.896 --> 00:51:11.868
it's not enough to just
change a Congressman or a

00:51:14.404 --> 00:51:21.611
Senator or even a President;
we have to change the system

00:51:21.611 --> 00:51:23.613
to reflect our
better selves.

00:51:26.283 --> 00:51:28.618
We have to end the practice
of drawing our congressional

00:51:28.618 --> 00:51:30.620
districts so that
politicians can pick their

00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.622
voters, and not the
other way around.

00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:33.623
(applause)

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:39.629
We have to reduce the
influence of money in our

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:53.844
politics, so that a handful
of families and hidden

00:51:53.844 --> 00:51:59.850
interests can't bankroll
our elections - and if our

00:52:03.153 --> 00:52:06.089
existing approach to
campaign finance can't pass

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:08.091
muster in the courts, we
need to work together to

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:09.092
find a real solution.

00:52:09.092 --> 00:52:10.093
(applause)

00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:12.195
We've got to make it
easier to vote, not harder,

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:14.331
and modernize it for
the way we live now.

00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:15.332
(applause)

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:17.234
This is America.

00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:23.206
We want to make it easier
for people to participate.

00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:46.863
And over the course
of this year,

00:52:46.863 --> 00:52:48.865
I intend to travel the
country to push for reforms

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:50.867
that do just that.

00:52:52.068 --> 00:52:56.039
But I can't do these
things on my own.

00:52:56.039 --> 00:53:02.612
Changes in our political
process - in not just who

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:08.752
gets elected but how they
get elected - that will only

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:10.754
happen when the American
people demand it.

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:13.557
It will depend on you.

00:53:16.293 --> 00:53:20.630
That's what's meant by
a government of, by,

00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:22.632
and for the people.

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:29.005
What I'm asking for is hard.

00:53:29.005 --> 00:53:35.011
It's easier to be cynical;
to accept that change isn't

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:40.050
possible, and
politics is hopeless,

00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:46.056
and to believe that our
voices and actions don't matter.

00:53:53.763 --> 00:53:57.033
But if we give up now, then
we forsake a better future.

00:54:00.503 --> 00:54:04.374
Those with money and power
will gain greater control

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:06.476
over the decisions that
could send a young soldier

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:10.814
to war, or allow another
economic disaster,

00:54:10.814 --> 00:54:13.216
or roll back the equal
rights and voting rights

00:54:13.216 --> 00:54:16.086
that generations of
Americans have fought,

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.088
even died, to secure.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:25.428
As frustration grows, there
will be voices urging us to

00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:31.134
fall back into tribes, to
scapegoat fellow citizens

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:33.136
who don't look like
us, or pray like us,

00:54:33.136 --> 00:54:36.106
or vote like we do, or
share the same background.

00:54:39.643 --> 00:54:41.645
We can't afford to
go down that path.

00:54:43.813 --> 00:54:45.815
It won't deliver
the economy we want,

00:54:45.815 --> 00:54:51.488
or the security we
want, but most of all,

00:54:51.488 --> 00:54:54.924
it contradicts everything
that makes us the envy of

00:54:54.924 --> 00:54:56.893
the world.

00:54:58.962 --> 00:55:03.066
So, my fellow Americans,
whatever you may believe,

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:05.168
whether you prefer
one party or no party,

00:55:11.508 --> 00:55:15.912
our collective future
depends on your willingness

00:55:15.912 --> 00:55:20.917
to uphold your
obligations as a citizen.

00:55:20.917 --> 00:55:22.752
To vote.

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:25.121
To speak out.

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:29.793
To stand up for others,
especially the weak,

00:55:29.793 --> 00:55:33.830
especially the vulnerable,
knowing that each of us is

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:38.201
only here because somebody,
somewhere, stood up for us.

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:41.504
(applause)

00:55:41.504 --> 00:55:47.510
We need every American to
stay active in our public

00:55:56.286 --> 00:56:00.857
life, and not just
during election time,

00:56:00.857 --> 00:56:04.661
so that our public life
reflects the goodness and

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:07.931
the decency that I see in
the American people

00:56:07.931 --> 00:56:09.933
every single day.

00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:14.971
It is not easy.

00:56:16.039 --> 00:56:18.041
Our brand of
democracy is hard.

00:56:20.610 --> 00:56:22.979
But I can promise that a
little over a year from now,

00:56:22.979 --> 00:56:25.515
when I no longer
hold this office,

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:29.886
I will be right there with
you as a citizen - inspired

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:33.757
by those voices of
fairness and vision,

00:56:33.757 --> 00:56:37.694
of grit and good humor and
kindness that have helped

00:56:37.694 --> 00:56:39.696
America travel so far.

00:56:41.965 --> 00:56:45.335
Voices that help us see
ourselves not first and

00:56:45.335 --> 00:56:49.372
foremost as black or
white or Asian or Latino,

00:56:49.372 --> 00:56:52.842
not as gay or straight,
immigrant or native born;

00:56:52.842 --> 00:56:57.747
not as Democrats
or Republicans,

00:56:57.747 --> 00:57:01.184
but as Americans first,
bound by a common creed.

00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:09.259
Voices Dr. King believed
would have the final word -

00:57:09.259 --> 00:57:15.365
voices of unarmed truth
and unconditional love.

00:57:15.365 --> 00:57:18.635
They're out there,
those voices.

00:57:18.635 --> 00:57:20.637
They don't get a
lot of attention,

00:57:20.637 --> 00:57:26.509
nor do they seek it, but
they are busy doing the work

00:57:26.509 --> 00:57:29.646
this country needs doing.

00:57:29.646 --> 00:57:32.482
I see them everywhere I
travel in this incredible

00:57:32.482 --> 00:57:35.118
country of ours.

00:57:35.118 --> 00:57:36.119
I see you.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:37.120
I know you're there.

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:40.456
You're the reason why I have
such incredible confidence

00:57:40.456 --> 00:57:41.624
in our future.

00:57:41.624 --> 00:57:45.495
Because I see your quiet,
sturdy citizenship all the time.

00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:48.464
I see it in the worker
on the assembly line who

00:57:48.464 --> 00:57:52.302
clocked extra shifts to
keep his company open,

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:57.140
and the boss who pays him
higher wages to keep him

00:57:57.140 --> 00:57:59.075
on board.

00:57:59.075 --> 00:58:02.712
I see it in the Dreamer who
stays up late to finish her

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:06.316
science project, and the
teacher who comes in early

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:12.288
because he knows she might
someday cure a disease.

00:58:19.028 --> 00:58:21.297
I see it in the American
who served his time,

00:58:21.297 --> 00:58:27.303
and dreams of starting over
- and the business owner who

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:33.243
gives him that
second chance.

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:39.048
The protester determined to
prove that justice matters,

00:58:39.048 --> 00:58:42.051
and the young cop
walking the beat,

00:58:42.051 --> 00:58:45.388
treating everybody with
respect, doing the brave,

00:58:45.388 --> 00:58:47.390
quiet work of
keeping us safe.

00:58:49.092 --> 00:58:53.663
I see it in the soldier who
gives almost everything to

00:58:53.663 --> 00:58:56.933
save his brothers,

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:58.101
(applause)

00:58:58.101 --> 00:59:01.070
the nurse who tends to him
'til he can run a marathon,

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:04.941
and the community that
lines up to cheer him on.

00:59:08.011 --> 00:59:11.748
It's the son who finds the
courage to come out as who

00:59:11.748 --> 00:59:15.952
he is, and the father whose
love for that son overrides

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:19.656
everything he's been taught.

00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:22.992
I see it in the elderly
woman who will wait in line

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:27.030
to cast her vote as
long as she has to;

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:33.336
the new citizen who casts
his vote for the first time;

00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:35.505
the volunteers at the polls
who believe every vote

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:40.576
should count, because each
of them in different ways

00:59:40.576 --> 00:59:43.613
know how much that
precious right is worth.

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:50.520
That's the America I know.

00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.356
That's the country we love.

00:59:53.356 --> 00:59:55.058
Clear-eyed.

00:59:55.058 --> 00:59:57.060
Big-hearted.

00:59:59.862 --> 01:00:04.133
Optimistic that unarmed
truth and unconditional love

01:00:04.133 --> 01:00:07.337
will have the final word.

01:00:07.337 --> 01:00:11.074
That's what makes me so
hopeful about our future.

01:00:11.074 --> 01:00:15.178
I believe in change,
because I believe in you.

01:00:15.178 --> 01:00:16.779
The American people.

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:21.851
And that's why I stand here
confident that the State of

01:00:21.851 --> 01:00:25.121
our Union is strong.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:27.523
Thank you, God bless you,

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:29.525
and God bless the United States of America.

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:32.061
(applause)
