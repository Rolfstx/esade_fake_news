00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.560
 *applause* 

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.880
 Welcome Kim Carey to give us a speech 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.980
 Kim Carey is the most interesting person on earth 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.280
 He is a legendary comedian genius 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.840
 Kim Carey is also the author of a profound children's book 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.230
 A man full of strong sympathy 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.240
 Kim Carey has made great contributions to a better world. 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.500
 Let us welcome the great Jim Carrey 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:46.900
 *applause* 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.440
 Thank you. 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.300
 *applause* 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.930
 What are you waiting for here? 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.380
 I was planning to brew for a while 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.270
 Can you extend that in the post-production period? Make it appear longer. 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.640
 Thanks Bevin. 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.640
 thank you all. 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.260
 thank you very much 

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:21.419
 *applause* 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.300
 I brought a painting of mine to you today. 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.680
 I hope you can still see it. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.360
 *laughter* 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.560
 This is not one of my big guys, so you might want to move down 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.820
 It looks great. 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.740
 College, 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.940
 Parents, friends, dignified guests, 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.220
 Graduated in 2014 class, 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.979
 *applause* 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.869
 And all the dead baseball players appeared in corn with us today. 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.130
 *Laughter and applause* 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.500
 After the harvest, there is no place too hidden for them. 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.880
 The field is empty. 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.840
 Is there a cover there. 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.660
 *laughter* 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.140
 The seeds I planted here today, 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.600
 This will inspire your seed to advance in life 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.069
 With a passionate heart and a sense of overall clarity 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.510
 The problem is to have that seed have a chance to take root 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.050
 Or I will be sued by Monsanto 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.234
 *laughter* 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.140
 And forced to use their descendants? 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:43.040
 *applause* 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.840
 This may not be 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.920
 Ayurveda completely. 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.020
 *laughter* 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.030
 Forgive me if I seem a little low energy tonight, 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.000
 Today, whatever it is. 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.760
 *laughter* 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.089
 I slept my head north last night. 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:02.489
 *laughter* 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.551
 , Hehehehe man 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.260
 Oh my 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.330
 How do you know this is the right child? 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.510
 *laughter* 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.260
 Yes 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.180
 Woke up in the middle of PITA. 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.540
 Can't go back to sleep until Titan Force is launched everywhere 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:20.400
 Crazy 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.240
 *applause* 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.040
 Wooo! 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.540
 *Jin Carrey Noise* 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.210
 But I am not crazy, you know. 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.770
 I use this time 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.130
 Eat a big meal, 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.900
 *laughter* 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.960
 Special connection with others' Tinder. 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.420
 *laughter* 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.160
 Because life does not happen to you, 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.940
 It happened to you. 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.960
 How do I know? 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.820
 I don’t know, but the sound I do, this is the most important thing. 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.180
 This is what I do here. 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.190
 Sometimes I think this is very important, really the only thing. 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.600
 You know, it just lets the other party know that when we are here, 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.580
 Remind each other that we are part of a larger self. 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.460
 I used to think that Kim Carey was all me. 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.240
 Just flashing lights. Dancing shadow. 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.000
 You can name great things without camouflage. 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.020
 *laughter* 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.280
 Looking for the residence of the cave and fox fairy cave. 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.580
 The bomb shelter was in a hurry. 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.940
 The shooter looks for him to target the mirror. 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.900
 Only my own arrow was injured. 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.920
 Begging to be enslaved. 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.160
 Implore my chain 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.920
 Deceived desire 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.100
 And trip 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.520
 in heaven. 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.760
 *applause* 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.400
 Can I get a god? 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.240
 *Amen* 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.419
 *applause* 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.839
 Didn't you think I might be serious like that? 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.789
 I don't think you understand who you are dealing with. 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.060
 *laughter* 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.460
 I have no restrictions. 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.220
 *laughter* 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:10.759
 *applause* 

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:14.410
 I can't be controlled because of my container. 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.810
 *applause* 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.980
 You can't contain a container man! 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.580
 You cannot include containers. 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.020
 Who i thought i was 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.320
 My skin ends at the edge. 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.980
 I have given this so-called body a little vehicle 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.070
 Experience creation from it. 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.900
 Although I cannot ask for a more sporty model. 

00:05:38.062 --> 00:05:40.122
 *laughter* 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.000
 After all this is a loan 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.310
 And will have to return 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:44.620
 *laughter* 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:49.470
 Later I learned that everything outside the car is part of me. 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.200
 Now I drive a convertible. 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.010
 *laughter* 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.300
 *applause* 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.800
 It’s a man! 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.480
 Up and down, the wind is in my hair. 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.040
 *applause* 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.820
 Alas! 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.360
 I’m so ecstatic that I’m really, really, really excited, and fully connected 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.490
 You at this important moment of your journey 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.900
 I hope you are ready to open the roof 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.660
 And take the whole body. 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.800
 *be quiet* 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:20.540
 Okay, those four years. 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.560
 *laughter* 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.340
 They are obviously not ready. 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:25.900
 sneezesumorecutting 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.060
 Luo, 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.780
 I want to thank the trustee, 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:31.940
 Administrator, MUM Faculty 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.420
 It is used to create an ideal institution where education deserves mahsi. 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:40.540
 Where to teach knowledge and experience. 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.040
 The necessary knowledge and experience to produce in life 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.410
 And to enable students to go beyond meditation, 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.350
 And ancient Vedic knowledge, 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.950
 Slack, twice a day for an hour and a half. 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:07:03.099
 *applause* 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:04.779
 Don't think you are lying to me. 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:08.250
 But I think it has some benefits. 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.040
 It allows you to distinguish who you are and what is real 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.660
 From the story running through your head. 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.140
 You give them 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.110
 Ability to walk behind the carefully set decoration 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.520
 And see that there is such a huge difference between the dogs that are going to eat you in your heart 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.100
 And the actual dog will eat you. 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.320
 *laughter* 

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:39.620
 This sounds like no big deal, but many have not learned to distinguish. 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:40.840
 *laughter* 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:44.280
 And they lived all their lives in battle or escape and responded very much. 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.880
 I also want to thank your wonderful parents. 

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.940
 The way to go! 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:51.440
 *applause* 

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.160
 What a wonderful job 

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.000
 You did 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.800
 *applause* 

00:07:55.810 --> 00:07:59.650
 For your tireless dedication, your love, your support. 

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:03.820
 The most important concern is that you pay your children. 

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:09.180
 I have one saying: "Beware, because nobody loves them and will hurt themselves eventually 

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:10.380
 Or me". 

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.160
 *laughter* 

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.160
 But when I saw this group here, 

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.620
 You know, I think it's safe. 

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.800
 *laughter* 

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:18.760
 I do. 

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.740
 *applause* 

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.540
 I just say: 

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:24.600
 My room is not locked. 

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.120
 My room is not locked. 

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.940
 There is no doubt that some people will become liars. 

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.220
 *laughter* 

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.100
 But you know the white-collar stuff, 

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.880
 Something like Wall Street, 

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.770
 You know. 

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.550
 Criminals are committed to self-esteem. 

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:45.010
 *laughter* 

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.190
 Dongdong's parents can still be proud 

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.610
 In a strange way. 

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.460
 And in the graduation class 

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.750
 In 2017, 

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.660
 Minus three. 

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:59.440
 *laughter* 

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.920
 Ya didn't let me finish. 

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.640
 *laughter* 

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.360
 Congratulations! 

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.880
 Yes! 

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.180
 Give yourself an applause, thank you. 

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:21.920
 *applause* 

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.000
 You are a pioneer of knowledge and consciousness, 

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:30.080
 A new wave in a vast ocean full of possibilities. 

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.840
 There is a world on the other side of this gate 

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:37.730
 Starving new ideas, new leadership. I have been there for 30 years. 

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.320
 She is a wild cat! 

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.860
 *laughter* 

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.800
 Oh, she will rub up against her legs and grunts until you pick her up and start touching her. 

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.160
 Then, where does it come from, she will slap your face! 

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:51.720
 *laughter* 

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.209
 It can be rough there. 

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.519
 But it doesn’t matter, because they are soft ice cream, 

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.340
 *laughter* 

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.600
 With sprinkles. 

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:04.740
 I think this is what I really want to say here today. 

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.940
 Sometimes, it can eat your feelings. 

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.920
 *laughter* 

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.020
 Worry now 

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:15.030
 Will be the player in your life 

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:17.280
 It depends on how much you get. 

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.320
 You can spend your whole life imagining ghosts, 

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:24.580
 Worry about the future of the pathway, but all there will always be 

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:28.910
 Is what is happening here is deciding us at this moment 

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.490
 Its headquarters is in love or fear. 

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:36.600
 So many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality. 

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.900
 What we really want cannot seem out of reach 

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.260
 And ridiculous expectations, so we never dare to ask the universe. 

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:49.640
 I said, I said you can ask the universe for its proof. 

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.420
 please! 

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:59.300
 *applause* 

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.830
 If it does not happen, you immediately 

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.100
 This is just because the universe is so busy to fill my order. 

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.220
 *laughter* 

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:16.430
 Party size! 

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.340
 My father was originally a great comedian, but he didn't think it was possible for him. 

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.480
 So he made a conservative choice instead. 

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.449
 He got a safety job as an accountant when I was 12 years old 

00:11:30.449 --> 00:11:35.349
 Also let him go from safe work. And our family does whatever we can to survive. 

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.860
 I learned a lot of lessons from my father 

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:41.640
 Not the most important of which is that you can fail when you don’t want 

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.380
 So you may wish to take the opportunity to do what you like. 

00:11:45.780 --> 00:12:03.160
 *applause* 

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.660
 This is not the only thing he taught me, though. You know. 

00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:09.040
 I watched the impact of my father's love and humor 

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:15.620
 And how it changed the world around me, I want this thing to do. 

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:19.980
 This thing is worth my time. Not long ago, I started acting 

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.620
 You know, people will come to the house 

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:26.800
 They will be greeted by a 70-year-old who fell down a large stretch of stairs. 

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:33.070
 They will say: What is it? I will say, I don’t know let us check the replay. 

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.820
 I will go back to the stairs and come back in slow motion. 

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.280
 *Jin Carrey Noise* 

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.740
 This is a very strange family. 

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.860
 My father used to brag, am I a ham? I am a whole pig. 

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.040
 *laughter* 

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.080
 He treats my talent 

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:05.800
 As if this was his second chance. 

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:13.040
 When I was about 28, ten years as a professional cross talk actor, I realized one night in Los Angeles 

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.540
 The purpose of my life has always been the attention of free people, 

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:18.640
 Just like my dad. 

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.240
 When I realized this, I jokingly called my new dedication: 

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.840
 "Liberty churches pay attention to" FFC churches. 

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.460
 *applause* 

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.820
 I devoted myself wholeheartedly to the department. What is yours? 

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.840
 How will you serve the world? 

00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.700
 What do they need, and your talent can provide it? 

00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.720
 This is what you have to figure out. 

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.100
 Just like someone who is doing what you are going to do, 

00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:52.960
 I can tell you from experience that your influence on others 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.600
 It is the most valuable currency. 

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:06.120
 *applause* 

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:10.149
 Because everything you get in your life is rotten and scattered 

00:14:10.149 --> 00:14:13.689
 And all you who are leaving are in your heart. 

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.140
 The reason why I choose free people, 

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:21.180
 I chose the attention of people to get me to the top of the mountain. 

00:14:21.180 --> 00:14:24.640
 Look where I am. See what I can do. 

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:29.480
 No matter where I go, I am because I get exercise when I enter this 

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:34.720
 It is truly extraordinary me. I did something to make 

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.490
 The people present gave me their best no matter where I went. 

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:50.460
 *applause* 

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:56.070
 I am at the top of the mountain, the only one I and I have not been released 

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.770
 It’s me, and that’s when my search for identity deepens. 

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.560
 I don’t know who I am without my fame, 

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:05.630
 Who would i be, if i said something, people didn't want to hear 

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.380
 Or, if I ignore their expectations of me. 

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.220
 If I show up in the party without my carnival mask 

00:15:12.220 --> 00:15:15.680
 Refuse to flash my breast beads? 

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.180
 I give you a moment to eliminate this image in your mind. 

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.380
 However, you are such a leading game. 

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:30.540
 You already know who you are. 

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:34.800
 And this piece, this piece is after 

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:40.940
 Beyond the personality, beyond the feeling of others, beyond invention and disguise, 

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.380
 Even beyond their own efforts. 

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.120
 You can join the game, fight the war, use the form all you want to play 

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.780
 But to find true peace, you must let the armor go. 

00:15:55.660 --> 00:16:00.120
 Your acceptance needs can make you invisible in this world. 

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.000
 Don't let anything block the way of lighting through this form. 

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.240
 Risk is seen as glory at all. 

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:35.060
 *applause* 

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.760
 It is not big enough. 

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.040
 This painting is a big reason. 

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.400
 This is called high visibility. 

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.640
 This is about picking up the light, so I dare not wait. 

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:53.340
 Here is the tricky part, the light that everyone is attracted to. 

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.260
 The party is blessed in who believes that the top accommodates up to the unconscious 

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.420
 And always offer to drink from emptying your bottle. 

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.700
 Pain, under her, 

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.020
 The light of contempt, when you do well, you can't stand it, 

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.520
 I wish you only the worst. 

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.800
 Diamond in his queen 

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:19.180
 A king is needed to build her paper house. 

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.200
 And the hollow bottom will hold your legs at the bottom, saying please don’t leave my back 

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.000
 Because I have given up on myself. 

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.260
 Even the ones who are closest to you like the most, who are you 

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.680
 Your favorite person in the world, 

00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.380
 The clarity that will be found is sometimes faced. 

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:45.000
 It took me thousands of hours to complete this painting. 

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.260
 When i'm over. 

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:47.140
 *applause* 

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:47.640
 Thank you. 

00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:49.520
 Thousands of hours. Yes. 

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.220
 I will never let them back. 

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.460
 I will never let them back. 

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.899
 I have been engaged for so long. 

00:18:01.899 --> 00:18:05.519
 I was alone like a lunatic in the scaffolding week 

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.920
 When I ended up one of my friends said: 

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.860
 This will be a cool black light painting. 

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.020
 *laughter* 

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:14.520
 So, I started. 

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:15.500
 *laughter* 

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:20.640
 *applause* 

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.800
 WOOO! 

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:32.690
 Welcome to Fireman. 

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:38.409
 Some very crazy characters until there is 

00:18:38.760 --> 00:18:42.760
 But it is better there than here. You know. 

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.620
 Painting is one of the ways. Thank you. 

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.660
 Painting is one of the ways I broke free from the constraints, 

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:53.320
 Stop the world through comprehensive psychological, spiritual and physical participation. 

00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:59.200
 But even if there is a sense of divine dissatisfaction, because in the end 

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:04.400
 We are not the incarnation of our creation. We are not pictures on film. 

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:07.180
 We shined light. 

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:12.650
 Everything is just looking at flowers in the fog, distracting and not really attractive. 

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:18.540
 I often say that I hope people can realize their dreams of wealth and fame 

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.360
 So that they can see, this is not the feeling of where you are going to find you to complete. 

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.820
 Like many of you 

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.080
 I am very worried about going out into the world and doing something bigger than me. 

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:34.000
 Until someone smarter than me makes me realize 

00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:36.320
 There is nothing bigger than myself. 

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:46.440
 *applause* 

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.450
 My soul is not contained within the limits of my body. 

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:53.980
 My body is contained within the infinite nature of my soul. 

00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.560
 A unified field! 

00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:01.880
 *applause* 

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.840
 There is no unified field, 

00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:06.680
 There is no special reason for dancing, 

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:10.000
 Maybe apart from comfort and entertainment itself. 

00:20:10.591 --> 00:20:16.491
 *applause* 

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:23.540
 With this transformation happening, you, will you feel the world, will you feel it, will you be embraced by it. 

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:25.940
 Now I am always at the beginning. 

00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.280
 I have a reset button. 

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.460
 I ride the button constantly. 

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.300
 Once the button has no story in your life function, the mind can be created 

00:20:37.309 --> 00:20:41.870
 It will be just as compelling. Imagine always making scenes 

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.350
 The good and the bad and the self try to trap you in your mind. 

00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.220
 *applause* 

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:56.740
 Our eyes are not viewers, they are also projectors 

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.100
 The second story running in the picture 

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.810
 We see all the time before us. Worrying about writing scripts 

00:21:03.810 --> 00:21:07.330
 And the title of the job is "I will never be enough." 

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.180
 *applause* 

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.160
 You have to look at someone like me and say: 

00:21:15.170 --> 00:21:18.240
 How can we hope to achieve these with a little height Jim? 

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.880
 How can we make a painting too big for our home? 

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.920
 Why are you flying so high without special breathing devices? 

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:38.440
 This is my voice 

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:41.020
 If you listen 

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:44.390
 There will always be others who do better than you. 

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.740
 No matter what you get, ego will not let you rest. 

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:53.940
 It will tell you that you cannot stop until you have left an indelible mark on the earth 

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.500
 Until you have achieved immortality. 

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:01.460
 How tricky is this self, it will seduce us 

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.920
 With the promise of things, we already have. 

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:12.780
 *applause* 

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:16.610
 and so, 

00:22:17.740 --> 00:22:19.580
 I just want you to relax. 

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.940
 You know. 

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.340
 This is my job. 

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.400
 Relax and dream a beautiful life. 

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:32.020
 I have a substitute teacher from Ireland in the second grade 

00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:34.940
 This tells my class morning prayer, when she wants something, 

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:36.660
 In all things, she prays 

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:40.780
 And promised to return something, she can always get what she wants. 

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.240
 I sit at the back of the classroom, you know, think, okay, 

00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:46.610
 My family cannot afford bicycles, you know. 

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:53.280
 So, I went home, I prayed for it, I promised, and every night I would recite the roses in exchange. 

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.820
 Break it. Broke the promise. 

00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.880
 But two weeks later, I returned home from school and found a brand new Mustang bike with a banana seat 

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.200
 And the rider handlebars. Yes. 

00:23:05.209 --> 00:23:07.889
 *applause* 

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.140
 From fool to cool! 

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.420
 My family told me that I have won a bicycle draw by one of my friends 

00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.880
 I have entered my name without any knowledge. 

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.840
 So this type of thing has happened to me so far. 

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.100
 As far as I can tell it, just let the universe know what you want 

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:30.200
 And work towards it while letting it pass on and off. 

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:31.140
 *Yay* 

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:40.180
 *applause* 

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:44.710
 Is it your job to figure out how it is going to happen to you 

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.780
 But open the door in your head 

00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:50.920
 When the door is opened in real life, only walk through. 

00:23:51.779 --> 00:23:56.879
 *applause* 

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:00.560
 If you miss the clue, because there is always a door to open. 

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.430
 They gave way, when I said that life does not happen to you 

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:08.890
 It happened to you, I really don't know if this is true. 

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:15.420
 I just consciously choose to perceive challenges, something beneficial 

00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.880
 So that I can deal with them in the most effective way. 

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:20.940
 You will come up with your own style. 

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.620
 This is part of the fun. 

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:27.620
 Oh, why not take the opportunity of faith? 

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:36.440
 *applause* 

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:39.380
 Confidence to seize the opportunity, not religion, 

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:43.179
 But faith, not hope, is faith. 

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.360
 I don't believe in hope. Hope is a beggar. 

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:50.020
 Hope crossed fire and confidence crossed it. 

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:57.030
 *applause* 

00:24:58.379 --> 00:25:00.700
 You are willing and able 

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.499
 Make beautiful things in this world, you walk from behind the door today 

00:25:05.499 --> 00:25:07.679
 You will always have only two options: 

00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:09.919
 Love or fear. 

00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:15.440
 Choose love and never let fear put you to your playful heart. 

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.280
 thank you very much. 

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.120
 Master development 

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.340
 I am very honored. 

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:21.240
 Thank you. 

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:34.380
 *applause* 

00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.500
 I love you.
