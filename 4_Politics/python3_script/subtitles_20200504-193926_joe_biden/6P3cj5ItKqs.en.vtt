I<00:44:33.010><c> guess</c><00:44:33.690><c> he</c><00:44:34.690><c> starts</c><00:44:35.260><c> talking</c><00:44:36.130><c> about</c><00:44:36.640><c> the</c>

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:37.270 align:start position:0%
I guess he starts talking about the
 

00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:39.359 align:start position:0%
I guess he starts talking about the

00:44:39.359 --> 00:44:39.369 align:start position:0%
Teamsters connection to the mob and we
 

00:44:39.369 --> 00:44:41.190 align:start position:0%
Teamsters connection to the mob and we
think<00:44:39.579><c> that</c><00:44:39.700><c> this</c><00:44:39.819><c> is</c><00:44:39.880><c> ultimately</c><00:44:40.180><c> why</c><00:44:40.839><c> he</c><00:44:41.049><c> was</c>

00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
think that this is ultimately why he was
 

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:42.690 align:start position:0%
think that this is ultimately why he was
killed<00:44:41.470><c> right</c><00:44:41.770><c> correct</c>

00:44:42.690 --> 00:44:42.700 align:start position:0%
killed right correct
 

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
killed right correct
he<00:44:43.450><c> starts</c><00:44:44.730><c> Chucky</c><00:44:45.730><c> says</c><00:44:45.880><c> he</c><00:44:46.059><c> lost</c><00:44:46.210><c> his</c><00:44:46.450><c> mind</c>

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.010 align:start position:0%
he starts Chucky says he lost his mind
 

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.799 align:start position:0%
he starts Chucky says he lost his mind
and<00:44:48.010><c> that's</c><00:44:48.280><c> because</c><00:44:48.730><c> this</c><00:44:48.970><c> is</c><00:44:49.150><c> completely</c>

00:44:49.799 --> 00:44:49.809 align:start position:0%
and that's because this is completely
 

00:44:49.809 --> 00:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
and that's because this is completely
this<00:44:50.260><c> is</c><00:44:50.319><c> something</c><00:44:50.680><c> Chucky</c><00:44:50.890><c> could</c><00:44:51.160><c> never</c>

theory is he was he couldn't get the
