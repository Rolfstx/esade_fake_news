00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.820
- Qantas nonstop research
flight from London to Sydney,

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:04.653
here I come.

00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:05.680
And we will see double sunrise today.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.050
- We will see double sunrise today.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.883
Hi five.

00:00:08.755 --> 00:00:12.610
- In 1919, 100 years ago,
it used to took 28 days

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:13.903
from U.K. to Australia.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.800
Beautiful, this is the
magic moment of the day.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.520
- Trying to stretch to the locker.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.607
- Sitting can be exercise, as well.

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:23.400
Can you show me the sitting exercise?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.900
You could even take up more passenger.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.260
Everything on this plane
is actually special.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.160
I think I'm gonna lose
some weight after landing.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.840
We need to adjust our body
clock to Sydney's time.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:32.690
So this is supper right now.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.328
- I'd like to share with you

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:35.840
something very close to my heart.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.870
- The A350 or the 777X,

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.130
what is your favourite aircraft, Alan?

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.080
These are the typical
Australian outback landscape.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.944
This is such a history making flight.

00:00:45.944 --> 00:00:47.351
(crowd cheering)
Yay!

00:00:47.351 --> 00:00:49.934
(upbeat music)

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.633
- Welcome aboard our nonstop flight

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:54.070
through to Sydney today.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.820
We'll be boarding from gate
number one just after 5:00 a.m.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.000
And that one's there for yourself today.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.770
So when you're ready, you
can head through security.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.840
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.850
- Take care.
- Enjoy.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.182
- Project Sunrise, here we come.

00:01:05.182 --> 00:01:07.765
(upbeat music)

00:01:16.188 --> 00:01:18.245
- Welcome aboard our special advising act

00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:19.993
on this morning's nonstop flight

00:01:19.993 --> 00:01:22.909
from London Heathrow to Sydney, Australia.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.430
- [Group] Sydney!

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.950
- Thank you very much, guys.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.783
Good luck.

00:01:26.783 --> 00:01:27.640
Thank you.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.473
Bye now.

00:01:28.473 --> 00:01:29.406
- Good on you, thanks.

00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:31.635
See you next time.

00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:35.759
- Enjoy your flight.
- Thank you, thank you.

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.449
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:01:37.449 --> 00:01:38.713
Hey, good morning!

00:01:38.713 --> 00:01:41.840
Overcoming the final frontier of aviation,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.490
Qantas nonstop research
flight from London to Sydney,

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.479
here I come.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.990
- See ya soon, bye!
- Bye, take care.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.070
- Hello, welcome aboard.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.591
- [Sam] Hello, hello.

00:01:51.591 --> 00:01:53.698
Good morning, good morning.

00:01:53.698 --> 00:01:54.531
- Good morning, welcome aboard.

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.589
- [Sam] We're making history today.

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:56.720
- Absolutely, aviation history.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.140
- [Sam] Nonstop to Australia, let's go!

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.947
- Double sunrise, bring it on.

00:01:59.947 --> 00:02:03.320
- Departing London today,
19 hours and 17 minutes.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.580
Darkness when we depart, bright sunshine

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:06.660
in Sydney when we land.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.900
- [Sam] And we will see
double sunrise today.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.333
- We will see double sunrise today.

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.180
- [Sam] Just a history
making, hi five, Captain.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.183
- Hi five.

00:02:12.183 --> 00:02:14.766
(upbeat music)

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.430
- Now, it's 5:40 a.m.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.730
I'm sitting in seat 8A,

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.160
and look at the pillow here.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.150
It says Qantas Research Flights.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.920
- [Attendant] Thanks very much, London.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.531
We'll see you when we come back next time.

00:02:32.531 --> 00:02:33.364
Thank you.

00:02:33.364 --> 00:02:34.364
- Bye!
- Bye!

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.600
- We have to do the final
door has now closed.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.189
- Let's go.

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:44.022
- [Announcer] If your seat is fitted

00:02:44.022 --> 00:02:45.465
with a sash belt, ensure.

00:02:45.465 --> 00:02:47.805
From the pouch by pulling the tab.

00:02:47.805 --> 00:02:48.990
- Mind if I just pull this over for you?

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.560
- Oh, yes, I forgot the shoulder strap.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.560
- Yeah, it's a safety
precaution, so like a car seat.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.980
- Oh, like a car seats, yes.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:56.813
Thank you very much.

00:02:56.813 --> 00:02:57.646
- There you go.

00:02:57.646 --> 00:02:58.746
It'll stop you from.
- All secure.

00:02:58.746 --> 00:03:00.154
- [Attendant] Not that
you're gonna need it at all.

00:03:00.154 --> 00:03:00.987
- Thank you.

00:03:00.987 --> 00:03:02.850
So the time now is 6:00 a.m.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.710
So we pushed back a few minutes early.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.910
We're heading towards
the end of runway 27 Left

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.070
for departure, and as you can see,

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.215
it's still pitch dark
and slightly with rain.

00:03:13.215 --> 00:03:16.132
(engines whirring)

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.150
There we have just a takeoff.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.810
19 hours, 17 minutes to Australia nonstop.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.880
In 1919, 100 years ago,
it used to took 28 days

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.430
from U.K. to Australia.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.360
So today, that's 19 hours we'll get there.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.680
And today's flights, we'll be over flying

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.790
the following countries
from England to Netherlands,

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.140
Germany, Poland, Belarus,
Russia, Kazakhstan,

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.609
China, Philippines, Indonesia
and on to Australia.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.990
- Hi there, sir.
- Hello there.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.180
- I've just got the menu for you,

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.650
and there's also a
little bit of information

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.520
in here about the flight, as well.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.800
- [Sam] Thank you very much.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.720
- This historic event.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.553
There you go.

00:04:12.553 --> 00:04:13.490
- [Sam] Thank you.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:16.940
- Sam, on this flight, we've
locked the windows closed

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.570
in the forward two sections
where our customers are sitting

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.811
because we had a trial on this flight

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:24.700
for the Charles Perkins
method of getting everyone

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.140
onto the time zone in Sydney.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.400
So if you've like to look out the window

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.340
at the first sunrise,
you'll be able to do that

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.592
from the cabins further back.

00:04:32.592 --> 00:04:33.425
- [Captain] This is the Captain.

00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:34.450
My name is Helen Trenerry.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.990
Also on the flight deck,
First Officer Ryan Gill,

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.430
Second Officer Chris Agnew,
and Second Officer Tegan Grey.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.160
So in honour of your place
in this epic adventure,

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.330
we acknowledge the personnel who took part

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.940
in the top secret Double Sunrise Flights

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.020
that Qantas conducted during World War II.

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.110
These flights were under
constant threat of attack

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.020
from the Japanese and would
fly for up to 32 hours nonstop.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.690
The crew and their passengers
would see two sunrises

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.890
on their flights, giving them the title

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.150
of the Double Sunrise Flights.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.620
Today as we've departed London

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.760
in the wee, small hours of darkness,

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.940
the first of our two sunrises
is just about to occur

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.880
on the horizon to our east now.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.710
- Beautiful, this is the
magic moment of the day,

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.000
the first sunrise we saw on this flight,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.050
just about 40 minutes after it took off

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.220
and as we're flying towards the east.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.040
Most passenger in the
front cabin on this flight,

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.600
they will acclimatise to Sydney time zone,

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.405
which is actually now in the
evening at 5:45 local time.

00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:35.150
(door snapping)

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.480
I'm all changed into a very comfy,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.310
very recognisable pyjama,
the big, flying kangaroo.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.030
But this is not just a
normal Qantas pyjama,

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.863
something special.

00:05:45.863 --> 00:05:46.810
Let me show you why.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.080
It's a Qantas research special pyjama.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.020
Here, let's do a refill.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.770
I was drinking a lot of
water on this flight.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.163
- Stay hydrated.

00:05:55.163 --> 00:05:57.746
(gentle music)

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.690
- This is great.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.340
Every airline should do this.

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.190
This is a great idea, saving the planet.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:09.500
If you are a traveller,
bring your water bottle

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.556
instead of using that plastic bottle.

00:06:11.556 --> 00:06:14.210
- We'd like to do a bit of
exercise, very simple things.

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.220
So it's really going to
give you a bit of boost

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.783
in terms of oxygen in the body,

00:06:18.783 --> 00:06:23.020
and it's going, as well, to
help all of the blood flow

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.853
to come back.

00:06:23.853 --> 00:06:27.137
So the first one is going
to just natural walking.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:27.970
So just natural walking.

00:06:29.104 --> 00:06:31.687
(gentle music)

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:45.690
just stretch the side of the body.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.423
So try not to go too much on the side.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.695
Trying to stretch to the locker,

00:06:52.695 --> 00:06:54.067
and you can be on your toes.

00:06:54.067 --> 00:06:56.303
So you are here on your toes.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.870
Just gentle, okay?

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.530
It's not a competition.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.363
Five times.

00:07:06.454 --> 00:07:09.390
Now what we're going to do is stretching

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.840
the ischial muscle here and the calves,

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.780
which are the other one

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.692
that are compressed when we
are sitting for a long time.

00:07:16.692 --> 00:07:18.427
So you can lift this one leg.

00:07:18.427 --> 00:07:21.010
(gentle music)

00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:23.704
One, two, three.

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:29.947
Six, seven, eight,

00:07:33.302 --> 00:07:34.135
nine, 10.

00:07:36.326 --> 00:07:38.250
(group cheering)
(group applauding)

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.034
- [Sam] How do you feel after exercising?

00:07:40.034 --> 00:07:41.534
- Oh, invigorated.

00:07:42.994 --> 00:07:45.410
I don't know if I could
do it twice, though.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:46.770
- [Sam] Were you able
to, squatting all the way

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:48.900
to Sydney, 19 hours.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:50.597
- So what we recommend at the moment

00:07:50.597 --> 00:07:52.840
is two different types of exercise.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.250
One is the sitting exercise.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:57.110
So there's a number of
movement people can still do

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.710
while sitting in the seat.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.280
- Sitting can be exercise, as well.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.540
- Absolutely, we can just
imagine some exercise.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:04.690
- Can you show me the sitting exercise?

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.062
So you're raising yours heels.

00:08:06.062 --> 00:08:08.097
- Yeah, and contracting the calf muscle.

00:08:08.097 --> 00:08:10.520
And this one, there's the other one

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.200
where you raise the toes.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.130
- Raising toes on the front.

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.420
- And you can do upper
body exercise, as well.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:23.200
So you can do squeezing,
for example, squeezing.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.477
You can do stretching one side.

00:08:29.477 --> 00:08:31.520
You can do the other side.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.270
Turn.
- Ah, you can turn, as well.

00:08:34.177 --> 00:08:35.050
- You can lift yourself.

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:36.180
- [Sam] Left yourself, oh, yes.

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:37.400
- So there's a lot of things,

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.940
and once people feel empowered to do it,

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.280
then they will find
the exercise they like.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.200
- What we're wearing
today is am active watch

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.080
on our nondominant hands,
and this is 24-hour monitor,

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:51.710
and we'll be wearing
those for about 21 days.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.320
It's got the light metre in it, as well,

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.180
but it's gonna also looking
at every movement we make.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:57.770
It gets downloaded to computers,

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:00.580
and then they'll be able
to assess our times of rest

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.540
and our times of movement.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.130
Here is also another light metre

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:06.960
because they need to assess the light

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.670
that goes into our eyes.

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:11.020
So we need to wear this
somewhere between our eyes

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.210
and our chest, and it's
doing a continuous monitoring

00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:15.490
of the light going into our eyes

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.740
because that affects the
melatonin levels that we produce.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.720
Now, Helen, can you tell
me how much fuel uplifted

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:24.080
from London to do this nonstop to Sydney?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.350
- In the flight plan, we needed
100 tonnes of fuel today.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.680
The takeoff weight for the
aeroplane is nearly 235 tonnes.

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.240
So that's 235,000 kilogrammes.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.870
When we get to Sydney, we'll be landing

00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:37.280
at about 137,000 kilogrammes.

00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.930
So we'll burn a fair bit
of the fuel on the way,

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.030
but we're running a very
fuel efficient flight today,

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.240
and we've got a lot of computers

00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.150
and performance engineers
monitoring our fuel flow.

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.010
- You could even take up more passenger.

00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:49.200
- We could've taken more today, yeah.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:52.970
We had about 20,000 kilos below
our maximum takeoff weight.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.720
So we had a bit more
room for a few bodies,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.270
but we couldn't get anybody
in the terminal aboard.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.920
- All right, I guess it's too late now

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:00.753
for everyone to hop on.

00:10:00.753 --> 00:10:01.770
We already took off.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.680
Well, thank you very much, Helen.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.513
- You're welcome, Sam.

00:10:03.513 --> 00:10:06.670
- You can see the entire economy
class behind me is empty,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.060
and also the premium economy's also empty.

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:10.910
All the guests and passenger are sitting

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.210
in the front of the plane.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.830
Now, that creates lots of room

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:16.150
for people to walk down
here to do those exercise,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.110
stretching when they needed to.

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.400
And also, Qantas is telling me

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.770
if the Project Sunrise will be launched

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.990
and the new aeroplane will get chosen,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.230
the economy class will be
a far roomier experience

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:30.823
on the extra long haul flights like this.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.550
Everything on this flight
is actually special

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:39.770
and researched, even the food
were specially customised

00:10:39.770 --> 00:10:43.350
made for this flight to
promote a better wellbeing.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.130
- So here we've got the
roasted chicken broth

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.883
with shiitake mushrooms,
enoki, sugar snaps, and peas.

00:10:49.737 --> 00:10:51.020
This is a high protein meal

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.400
with the high GI carbohydrate
that's in the macaroni,

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.450
and that's gonna help to
put everyone to sleep.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:58.070
Comfort food encouraging the production

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:59.423
of serotonin and melatonin.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.630
- Very healthy flight.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:05.393
There's no Coke, no
Sprite, no soft drinks.

00:11:05.393 --> 00:11:06.370
- No caffeine.

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:10.030
- Only the coconut water or
this one called kombucha.

00:11:10.030 --> 00:11:12.500
And no spirits onboard, as well.

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.650
So it's entirely a very healthy flight.

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.150
I think I'm gonna lose
some weight after landing.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:19.938
Nice, white bread.

00:11:19.938 --> 00:11:21.629
- [Attendant] Yeah, it's special GI bread,

00:11:21.629 --> 00:11:23.275
which aids in sleep.

00:11:23.275 --> 00:11:25.575
- How's that for a nice,
healthy looking soup?

00:11:27.728 --> 00:11:31.154
- [Sam] Wow, a soup for
breakfast, that's great,

00:11:31.154 --> 00:11:32.421
- Supper.
- Supper.

00:11:32.421 --> 00:11:33.254
- [Attendant] It's actually supper.

00:11:33.254 --> 00:11:34.580
- [Sam] This is a supper
now, you're right.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.820
- [Attendant] In Sydney, it's supper time.

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.640
- We need to adjust our
body clock to Sydney's time.

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:39.673
So this is supper right now.

00:11:39.673 --> 00:11:42.177
- So this is the main
course, the steak sandwich

00:11:42.177 --> 00:11:43.260
with some roasted tomatoes,

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.610
and this is to help
support the sleep cycle

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:46.443
for our passengers.

00:11:46.443 --> 00:11:47.740
- Steak sandwich, sir.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.817
- Thank you very much.

00:11:48.817 --> 00:11:50.895
- There you go.

00:11:50.895 --> 00:11:52.570
And one for you, as well, sir.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.403
- Thank you very much.

00:11:53.403 --> 00:11:54.236
- Enjoy.

00:11:54.236 --> 00:11:55.310
- This is the vanilla rose cream

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.223
with strawberries and pistachio
and a strawberry jelly.

00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:01.200
And this is a milk based dessert.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.700
So something that people
traditionally give their kids

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:06.210
when they put them off to
sleep is a warm bottle of milk,

00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:08.690
and this is our version
of a warm bottle of milk.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.750
It's not warm, but it's a lovely,

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.808
delicious, lightly sweetened.

00:12:12.808 --> 00:12:14.221
- [Adrienne] So it's
best to have the seat.

00:12:14.221 --> 00:12:15.054
- [Sam] Oh, this is a mattress.

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:18.736
Oh, very nice, very soft, very plush.

00:12:18.736 --> 00:12:20.381
- [Adrienne] It's thick.

00:12:20.381 --> 00:12:21.580
So it's best to have the seat up front

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.480
before you put them on.

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.140
- [Sam] Oh, it's a cover.

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:25.449
- [Adrienne] So it covers right over,

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:28.390
and if you need to put
your sash belt on it,

00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.403
it's got the.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:31.720
- [Sam] Oh, I see.

00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:33.510
- Special spot there
for it to come through,

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.440
but you don't need that on during flight.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.970
So it means you can have this on

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.930
for takeoff and landing, as well,

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.706
which is good for customers
who wanna go to sleep.

00:12:42.706 --> 00:12:44.120
With our.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.440
- [Sam] Thank you.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.763
- Now you're set for bed.

00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:49.710
Night night, sleeping time.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.093
Time for us to turn the lights out.

00:12:52.093 --> 00:12:54.211
(gentle music)

00:12:54.211 --> 00:12:55.044
- I just woke up.

00:12:55.044 --> 00:12:57.710
We're now halfway between
London and Sydney,

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.750
about 9-1/2 hour to go.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:03.063
Just coming to the galley,
doing some exercise, stretching.

00:13:05.279 --> 00:13:06.360
- Now, on a traditional flight,

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.410
we'd have a large selection of snacks

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:10.510
and items to choose from,

00:13:10.510 --> 00:13:13.330
total weight of 1.5
tonnes for business class

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.527
with food and equipment,

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:16.060
but on this flight today,

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:18.007
because of the length
and nature of the flight,

00:13:18.007 --> 00:13:20.950
we're limited to 900 kilos.

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.130
- Weighs our watches, which
look like a '84 Casio.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:26.900
However, they're actually
quite technological,

00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:27.740
and they're quite advanced.

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.550
So they measure the amount of light

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:31.240
that's coming into them.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.890
We also have alertness testing.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:37.890
So during the flight at
several different intervals,

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.320
we check how alert we
are by using an exercise

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.130
on the iPad to test how quickly we respond

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.120
to a set of data.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:49.010
Outside of that, we
also keep a sleep diary,

00:13:49.010 --> 00:13:50.480
which shows how well we sleep.

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.190
- Six hours to land in Sydney.

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.260
Now the cabin light has
been turned on again.

00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:57.140
It is breakfast time in Sydney,

00:13:57.140 --> 00:13:59.600
and we've just been served a piccolo latte

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.150
to wake up and stimulate
the palette for breakfast.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:04.890
I had a pretty good
sleep, six hours sleep,

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.850
and then I did some
exercise, enjoyed a movie,

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:09.530
aboriginal movie called "Jedda".

00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:12.992
It was 1955 movie, and
then I did some work,

00:14:12.992 --> 00:14:14.440
(dinging)
writing up the blog

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:15.800
and about this flight.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.188
And so all the details
will be shared with you

00:14:18.188 --> 00:14:19.127
(dinging)
in the upcoming video

00:14:19.127 --> 00:14:20.570
and on my blog.

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.170
So there are actually quite a
few passenger on this flight

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:25.440
doing the reaction test
and under research,

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.520
and here I met David.

00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.870
- [David] It's a reaction time machine.

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:31.000
Soon as the numbers start timing down,

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.450
you've gotta push the button.

00:14:34.404 --> 00:14:37.000
And at the end, it gives you a total score

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.310
of how well you did.

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:40.980
- [Sam] Oh, so it's testing your reaction.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.750
As soon as number hit a screen, you tap.

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:46.890
- [David] Yep, and it goes for 10 minutes,

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.510
and it changes duration,
so it gets very frustrating

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:51.343
after 10 minutes.

00:14:51.343 --> 00:14:52.590
- [Sam] So sometimes fast, sometimes slow.

00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:53.589
- [David] Yeah, try it.

00:14:53.589 --> 00:14:56.330
- [Sam] I think, David,
you're pretty good at this.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.200
- Oh, yeah, I'm getting very good.

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.880
Practise makes perfect.

00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:02.150
- So this is the healthy breakfast bowl,

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:03.450
and it's full of roasted cauliflower

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:05.980
with a spicy harissa
dressing, a poached egg,

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.250
and some watercress, and the idea of this

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:11.040
is to go along with the wake up cycle.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.523
That's what we use the
spicy harissa dressing for.

00:15:14.933 --> 00:15:16.310
- Mr. Jones, a breakfast for you.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:17.143
- Good morning.

00:15:17.143 --> 00:15:18.137
- [Attendant] Sorry to
have kept you waiting.

00:15:18.137 --> 00:15:19.262
- [David] No, it's okay.

00:15:19.262 --> 00:15:20.095
- [Attendant] You eat them all.

00:15:20.095 --> 00:15:21.098
- I could eat all this.

00:15:21.098 --> 00:15:22.567
(attendant chuckling)

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:24.710
- Now that magic moment
is gonna start again.

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:26.840
Shortly we're gonna
see the double sunrise,

00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.840
the second sunrise on this flight.

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.400
We're over Ambon, Indonesia
at 41,000 feet at the moment,

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.058
about five hours to Sydney from now on.

00:15:36.058 --> 00:15:37.480
- [Captain] At this point
now at the left side

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.520
of the aircraft, you'll
see your second sunrise.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:41.950
And now we are all members

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:45.600
of the rare and special Secret
Order of the Double Sunrise

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.160
and trailblazers for Project Sunrise.

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.850
A century ago, the Australian government

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.720
challenged the world's leading aviators

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.280
to fly from Great Britain to Australia

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:55.160
in less than 30 days.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.340
Brothers Captain Ross Smith,
and Lieutenant Keith Smith

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.430
and their mechanics,
Sergeants Wally Shiers,

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:01.830
and Jim Bennett took off

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.890
in their modified Vickers Vimy bomber

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:06.670
from snow covered Hounslow
Aerodrome in West London

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.340
on the morning of November 12th, 1919.

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:12.560
Some 135 hours of actual
flying time later,

00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.670
on the 10th of December,
the four touched down

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:16.870
at Fannie Bay in the Northern
Territory of Australia

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:21.520
near Darwin and shared a
prize of 10,000 pounds.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:22.520
Their flight is considered one

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.250
of the world's great
pioneering aviation feats,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.930
and today we replicate that challenge

00:16:26.930 --> 00:16:29.320
in a flying machine they
could never have imagined

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.020
and just on 19 hours of flying time.

00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:33.280
- Hey, Sam, my name's Chris Agnew,

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:34.670
one of the second officers

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.877
on board QF7879 from London to Sydney,

00:16:37.877 --> 00:16:40.220
and I'd like to share with
you something very close

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.580
to my heart.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.480
It's a picture of my grandfather that,

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:46.380
he used to fly during the Second World War

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:48.670
as a air-sea rescue pilot
up in Papua, New Guinea.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.030
I carry it with me in my jacket pocket

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:56.020
'cause I know how proud
of me he was as a pilot,

00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:57.820
and unfortunately he
only passed away a couple

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.210
of months ago, so he just missed out

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:01.780
on hearing about the news

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.070
that I was conducting this flight.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:04.800
- Wow, Chris, that was so inspiring.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.783
I'm sure your grandfather's
very, very proud of you.

00:17:06.783 --> 00:17:08.070
- Thanks.
- So Chris,

00:17:08.070 --> 00:17:09.530
what's this thing you're holding with you?

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:11.860
- So this here is a brainwave monitor.

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:14.140
We are required to wear it

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.410
at all times when we're
on the flight deck.

00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:19.020
So it actually just sits on our foreheads

00:17:19.020 --> 00:17:21.083
just behind our ears on both side.

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.010
Designed so that our headset
can sit on our ears comfortably

00:17:25.010 --> 00:17:28.170
and the microphone boom
in front of our mouth

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.000
without any hindrance.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.860
It measures our brainwave activities.

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.790
- Alan, I want to ask you

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.440
which aircraft you think is more likely,

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:39.520
the A350 or the 777X?

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.350
- So it's gonna be pretty close.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:44.030
We've got both aircraft
still in competition.

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:46.130
We're talking to both manufacturers.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.830
Both have pros and cons.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:50.170
So this will come down to the line.

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:53.580
It's gonna be to the very last minute

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.820
before we'll make a call.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:57.970
- Okay, do you think
you will make that call?

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.400
- So our intent is by the
end of this calendar year,

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.200
which is only a few weeks away,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.270
that way we will be making a decision

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.730
on whether we do Sunrise or not.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.480
- Oh, so there's a chance
Sunrise may not even happen?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:10.313
- There is.

00:18:10.313 --> 00:18:12.280
I mean we've still got a
few hurdles to overcome.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.250
The reason why we're
doing these test flights

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:17.220
is to get our regulator to allow us,

00:18:17.220 --> 00:18:18.760
to make sure we're comfortable,

00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:20.110
we're having a tour of duty

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.840
that can do a 21 hour flight,
which you can't do today.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.470
We're also talking to our unions

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.700
about changing the employment contract

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.300
to allow them to do it,

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.370
and we're also looking at
what the product looks like

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:34.200
and the final economic case.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.340
And then it has to pass
the economic hurdles

00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:37.173
that we've set for it.

00:18:37.173 --> 00:18:38.970
And if it does pass that,

00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:43.040
then you'll probably see
Sunrise happening by 2023.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.460
- The last question, as an av geek,

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:49.540
we always wanna know what is
your favourite aircraft, Alan?

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.830
- My favourite aircraft is the Boeing 747,

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:54.260
and that's because.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.410
You agree with me?

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:56.243
- I agree.

00:18:56.243 --> 00:18:57.930
My favourite plane is the 747.

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:58.790
Please tell me more.

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.660
- That's 'cause Qantas has a big history,

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:02.467
as you're probably aware.

00:19:02.467 --> 00:19:06.430
Next year, we'll have flown
every series of the aircraft

00:19:06.430 --> 00:19:11.430
for 49 years, the 747-100, 200, the 300s,

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.900
the SPs, the 400s, the 400ERs,
and the -8s as a freighter.

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.600
So it's a piece of history.

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.270
But unfortunately we are
retiring them next year.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:24.290
So it's going to be a
very bittersweet moment

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.480
'cause we're replacing them

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.720
with super efficient aircraft like this,

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.850
but they are still in some ways, I think,

00:19:29.850 --> 00:19:31.030
the queen of the sky.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:33.060
- I wanna share with
you some personal story.

00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:36.010
When I was 13 year old,
I went on a Qantas flight

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.490
from Sydney to Melbourne,
Qantas 9, 747-400,

00:19:39.490 --> 00:19:42.180
the first leg before you're
onward to Singapore and London,

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:43.940
and I was a kid at the back.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:45.207
And the flight attendant saw me.

00:19:45.207 --> 00:19:46.900
Within a few minute, they call me

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.380
and they took me upstairs to the cockpit,

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.690
and I had the fortune
to sit behind the pilots

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:55.476
to observe my very first jump
seats takeoff in the cockpit.

00:19:55.476 --> 00:19:57.600
Something not to tell the regulator

00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:00.970
is my hand was underneath
the captain's hand,

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:04.640
and we were pushing the
throttle on the 747-400

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.950
on the engine during the takeoff.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.650
So it was remarkable.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:11.400
I think this aeroplane
shapes the love of aviation

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.370
for many people, including myself.

00:20:13.370 --> 00:20:14.310
- That's a great story.

00:20:14.310 --> 00:20:16.260
- Guys, I have Richard Quest here

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.650
on this history making
Qantas 787 nonstop flight.

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:20.920
How's the flight so far?

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:23.220
- I'm impressed at how well I'm feeling,

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.470
and I think partly it's
because of the excitement,

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:26.630
people like yourself on board.

00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:27.790
Everybody's walking around.

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:29.090
Everybody's gossiping.

00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:31.210
Everybody's chitchatting about aviation.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.873
But also, there aren't
200 people in the back.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.940
So there isn't the same humanity.

00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:39.220
There isn't the same movement around,

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:42.340
carts going up and down,
although there are in some cases.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.160
And there isn't just that same feeling

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.080
of pressure and crowding us.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.090
I'm feeling pretty good.

00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:48.740
We are now, by the way,

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.653
we have just crossed Northern Australia,

00:20:52.653 --> 00:20:53.486
there at the top.

00:20:53.486 --> 00:20:54.680
- [Sam] Oh, we're already in Australia?

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.430
- Yep, we're over there now.

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:57.390
We haven't actually crossed the main,

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:59.740
but this looks like it
actually connected, but.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.570
There is the Australia coast out there.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:05.403
- [Sam] Wow, excellent.

00:21:05.403 --> 00:21:07.252
Thank you so much, Richard.
- Sure.

00:21:07.252 --> 00:21:09.960
- [Captain] We are passing Longreach

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.990
out of the left-hand side of the aircraft.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:14.550
It's approximately 131
nautical miles away.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.983
That's 150 statute miles.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:19.913
The town is the middle of centre

00:21:19.913 --> 00:21:22.020
of Central Queensland out there.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:22.853
Have a good look.

00:21:22.853 --> 00:21:23.686
It's in the distance.

00:21:23.686 --> 00:21:24.519
It'll be very hard to see.

00:21:24.519 --> 00:21:26.260
It's quite a small town.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.760
This particular aircraft
has been named Longreach

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.320
in a nod to this Queensland town

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.453
that was integral to our beginnings.

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:34.243
Just for your information now,

00:21:34.243 --> 00:21:36.090
we have less than two hours to run.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:40.160
It's look like a touchdown
time of 12:28 p.m. into Sydney,

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.150
and we are currently 1,800 kilos of fuel

00:21:43.996 --> 00:21:44.940
ahead of where we should be.

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:47.300
So that's a saving of 1,800 kilos

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.159
due to all the fuel
optimization techniques

00:21:49.159 --> 00:21:51.879
we've utilising in the aircraft.

00:21:51.879 --> 00:21:52.800
Hope you've had a great night with us.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.580
We'll be getting busy shortly as we plan

00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.734
and commence our descent into Sydney.

00:21:57.734 --> 00:21:59.134
It's gonna be a spectacular arrival.

00:21:59.134 --> 00:22:01.080
It's a gorgeous day
there, sunny conditions.

00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.710
We've turned it on for you.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:03.817
It'll be very pleasant.

00:22:03.817 --> 00:22:07.080
- Hello, Sam, welcome to the
club of the Double Sunrise.

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.523
- Oh, thank you.
- Very, small, elite club

00:22:09.523 --> 00:22:11.143
you have no joined.
- This is great.

00:22:11.143 --> 00:22:11.976
Thank you very much.

00:22:11.976 --> 00:22:12.809
Look at this.

00:22:12.809 --> 00:22:13.860
- [Attendant] So this
is the original replica

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:16.340
of the certificate they used to issue

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:18.850
back when the Flight
Boat services started.

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:21.930
- [Sam] Oh, the original
this is replicating, oh, wow.

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:22.763
- [Attendant] Then on the other side,

00:22:22.763 --> 00:22:24.592
you've got the new one.
- The new one.

00:22:24.592 --> 00:22:26.968
- [Attendant] This is
the contemporary one.

00:22:26.968 --> 00:22:29.940
- Well, we are just about an
hour and a little bit more

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.270
until we arrive in Sydney.

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:33.630
I think you can recognise these

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:36.840
are the typical Australian
outback landscape.

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.200
The meal I had at lunch was phenomenal.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:42.535
It was a great dish, a
pasta with a beef ragu.

00:22:42.535 --> 00:22:45.210
- [Captain] Our draught
today, inbound towards Sydney

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.490
from the west.

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:47.996
We're going to do a right turn

00:22:47.996 --> 00:22:49.750
just before we reach Sydney city itself,

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.670
take it down towards the south

00:22:51.670 --> 00:22:54.030
for a series of left
turns and then landing

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:57.480
on runway 34, then towards the north.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.290
Touchdown time at this
stage looks like 12:28.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:02.400
We'd like to take this
opportunity to thank you

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.610
for accompanying us today
on such a special trip.

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.697
It's been an epic adventure for all of us.

00:23:06.697 --> 00:23:09.680
We look forward to catching
up with you on the ground

00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:13.802
and enjoying all the revelry
that goes with such a flight.

00:23:13.802 --> 00:23:16.170
Thank you, and good afternoon.

00:23:16.170 --> 00:23:17.500
- [Controller] 78, 79, the threshold.

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.643
Wind is three two zero
degrees, one zero knots.

00:23:19.643 --> 00:23:21.910
That's runway at 834 left clear to land.

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:24.577
(wind rumbling)

00:23:33.383 --> 00:23:36.216
(engine whirring)

00:23:39.917 --> 00:23:41.430
- [Controller] (muffled speaking) 879,

00:23:41.430 --> 00:23:44.000
congratulations on their flight.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.960
- What a great arrival into Sydney.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.740
This is such a history making flight.

00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.920
In fact, I think this research flight

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:51.950
will shape up the future of aviation.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:54.610
I'm extremely privileged
to be on this flight,

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:56.170
and I'm actually feeling great

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:58.490
even flying after 19 hours.

00:23:58.490 --> 00:24:00.860
With the arrival, that's not the end yet.

00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:04.190
This is just the start, a beginning of

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:06.160
Qantas centenary celebration.

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.394
Stay tuned for more.

00:24:07.394 --> 00:24:10.227
(uplifting music)

00:24:26.670 --> 00:24:27.503
- We're waiting for you.

00:24:27.503 --> 00:24:28.650
Have you got some tissues?

00:24:28.650 --> 00:24:30.200
- [Sam] Oh, this is very emotional.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.230
Like this is amazing.

00:24:31.230 --> 00:24:32.670
Thank you.
- Fantastic, isn't it?

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:35.420
- Thank you, Adrienne, thank you.

00:24:38.333 --> 00:24:39.500
- [Woman] Woo!

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:42.210
- Well, I've been flying 19 hours

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:45.750
inside this great Qantas
centenary aeroplane.

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:46.910
What a great livery.

00:24:46.910 --> 00:24:48.770
I just got out of the
aeroplane and realised

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:50.739
what a great livery this aeroplane has.

00:24:50.739 --> 00:24:53.572
(uplifting music)

00:25:00.343 --> 00:25:03.093
(group cheering)

00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.873
Cheers to Qantas 100, yay!

00:25:06.819 --> 00:25:08.979
(crowd cheering)

00:25:08.979 --> 00:25:11.812
(uplifting music)
