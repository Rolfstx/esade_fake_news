00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:07.306
&gt;&gt;Roberts: Are you prepared
to take the Oath, Senator?

00:00:07.416 --> 00:00:08.986
&gt;&gt;Obama: I am.

00:00:08.986 --> 00:00:12.186
&gt;&gt;Roberts: I, Barack Hussein
Obama, do solemnly swear

00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:14.766
&gt;&gt;Obama: I, Barack Hussein
Obama, do solemnly swear

00:00:15.846 --> 00:00:19.216
&gt;&gt;Roberts: that I will
execute the office of President

00:00:19.216 --> 00:00:20.676
to the United States faithfully

00:00:20.676 --> 00:00:23.856
&gt;&gt;Obama: that I will execute ...

00:00:24.036 --> 00:00:24.806
&gt;&gt;Roberts: faithfully the office

00:00:24.806 --> 00:00:25.846
of President of the
United States

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:26.726
&gt;&gt;Obama: the office
of the President

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:27.946
of the United States faithfully

00:00:28.356 --> 00:00:30.166
&gt;&gt;Roberts: and will, to
the best of my ability

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:31.576
&gt;&gt;Obama: and will, to
the best of my ability

00:00:31.686 --> 00:00:32.906
&gt;&gt;Roberts: preserve, protect

00:00:32.906 --> 00:00:35.466
and defend the Constitution
of the United States

00:00:35.686 --> 00:00:36.536
&gt;&gt;Obama: preserve, protect

00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:38.606
and defend the Constitution
of the United States

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:39.566
&gt;&gt;Roberts: so help you, God.

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:40.046
&gt;&gt;Obama: so help me, God.

00:00:40.046 --> 00:00:41.696
&gt;&gt;Roberts: Congratulations,
Mr. President.

00:00:42.016 --> 00:00:43.646
[cheers]

00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:44.726
All the best wishes to you.

00:00:44.726 --> 00:00:45.016
[cheers]

00:00:45.016 --> 00:01:57.006
["Hail to the Chief"
music and 21 gun salute]

00:01:57.736 --> 00:01:59.486
&gt;&gt;Feinstein: It is my
great personal honor

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.726
to present the 44th President

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:05.766
of these United States,
Barack Obama.

00:02:06.516 --> 00:02:25.426
[cheers and applause]

00:02:25.993 --> 00:02:28.936
&gt;&gt;Obama: Thank you. Thank you.

00:02:35.106 --> 00:02:36.836
My fellow citizens.

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:48.686
I stand here today humbled
by the task before us,

00:02:49.816 --> 00:02:54.166
grateful for the trust
you have bestowed,

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:58.176
mindful of the sacrifices
borne by our ancestors.

00:02:58.496 --> 00:03:03.616
I thank President Bush for
his service to our nation,

00:03:08.366 --> 00:03:09.846
as well as the generosity

00:03:09.846 --> 00:03:12.956
and cooperation he has shown
throughout this transition.

00:03:13.456 --> 00:03:20.066
Forty-four Americans have now
taken the presidential oath.

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:24.076
The words have been
spoken during rising tides

00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:27.486
of prosperity and the
still waters of peace.

00:03:29.466 --> 00:03:34.676
Yet, every so often, the oath
is taken amidst gathering clouds

00:03:35.556 --> 00:03:36.776
and raging storms.

00:03:37.756 --> 00:03:42.286
At these moments, America
has carried on not simply

00:03:42.596 --> 00:03:45.596
because of the skill or vision
of those in high office,

00:03:45.886 --> 00:03:51.576
but because We the People have
remained faithful to the ideals

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:55.366
of our forbearers, and true
to our founding documents.

00:03:57.786 --> 00:03:58.616
So it has been.

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:02.936
So it must be with this
generation of Americans.

00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:09.026
That we are in the midst of
crisis is now well understood.

00:04:09.726 --> 00:04:12.786
Our nation is at war,
against a far-reaching network

00:04:13.446 --> 00:04:14.576
of violence and hatred.

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:19.546
Our economy is badly weakened,
a consequence of greed

00:04:19.546 --> 00:04:21.196
and irresponsibility
on the part of some,

00:04:21.196 --> 00:04:25.296
but also our collective
failure to make hard choices

00:04:25.936 --> 00:04:28.056
and prepare the nation
for a new age.

00:04:29.366 --> 00:04:32.606
Homes have been lost; jobs
shed; businesses shuttered.

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:36.546
Our health care is too costly;
our schools fail too many;

00:04:36.546 --> 00:04:39.036
and each day brings
further evidence

00:04:39.036 --> 00:04:42.526
that the ways we use energy
strengthen our adversaries

00:04:42.526 --> 00:04:44.146
and threaten our planet.

00:04:45.476 --> 00:04:47.906
These are the indicators
of crisis,

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:50.446
subject to data and statistics.

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:56.266
Less measurable but no
less profound is a sapping

00:04:56.316 --> 00:05:00.816
of confidence across our
land - a nagging fear

00:05:00.816 --> 00:05:04.236
that America's decline
is inevitable,

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:07.066
and that the next generation
must lower its sights.

00:05:10.276 --> 00:05:13.916
Today I say to you that the
challenges we face are real.

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:15.846
They are serious
and they are many.

00:05:16.146 --> 00:05:19.816
They will not be met easily
or in a short span of time.

00:05:20.156 --> 00:05:23.566
But know this, America
- they will be met.

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:35.506
On this day, we gather because
we have chosen hope over fear,

00:05:36.166 --> 00:05:39.376
unity of purpose over
conflict and discord.

00:05:40.966 --> 00:05:45.296
On this day, we come to proclaim
an end to the petty grievances

00:05:45.546 --> 00:05:48.546
and false promises, the
recriminations and worn

00:05:48.546 --> 00:05:52.326
out dogmas, that for far
too long have strangled

00:05:52.756 --> 00:05:53.156
our politics.

00:05:54.236 --> 00:05:58.796
We remain a young nation, but
in the words of Scripture,

00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:02.496
the time has come to set
aside childish things.

00:06:04.036 --> 00:06:07.656
The time has come to
reaffirm our enduring spirit;

00:06:07.816 --> 00:06:10.466
to choose our better
history; to carry forward

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:14.886
that precious gift, that noble
idea, passed on from generation

00:06:14.886 --> 00:06:18.926
to generation: the God-given
promise that all are equal,

00:06:19.146 --> 00:06:21.966
all are free, and
all deserve a chance

00:06:21.966 --> 00:06:28.036
to pursue their full
measure of happiness.

00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:38.326
In reaffirming the greatness
of our nation, we understand

00:06:38.326 --> 00:06:39.906
that greatness is never a given.

00:06:41.156 --> 00:06:42.026
It must be earned.

00:06:43.436 --> 00:06:44.756
Our journey has never been one

00:06:44.756 --> 00:06:46.626
of short cuts or
settling for less.

00:06:47.566 --> 00:06:49.536
It has not been the path
for the faint-hearted -

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:52.486
for those who prefer
leisure over work,

00:06:52.676 --> 00:06:57.056
or seek only the pleasures
of riches and fame.

00:06:57.226 --> 00:07:00.126
Rather, it has been the
risk-takers, the doers,

00:07:00.126 --> 00:07:04.396
the makers of things - some
celebrated but more often men

00:07:04.516 --> 00:07:07.726
and women obscure in their
labor, who have carried us

00:07:07.726 --> 00:07:11.946
up the long, rugged path
towards prosperity and freedom.

00:07:13.396 --> 00:07:17.516
For us, they packed up their few
worldly possessions and traveled

00:07:17.516 --> 00:07:19.826
across oceans in
search of a new life.

00:07:21.056 --> 00:07:24.536
For us, they toiled in
sweatshops and settled the West;

00:07:25.316 --> 00:07:28.766
endured the lash of the whip
and plowed the hard earth.

00:07:30.046 --> 00:07:33.996
For us, they fought and
died, in places like Concord

00:07:34.606 --> 00:07:37.646
and Gettysburg, Normandy
and Khe Sahn.

00:07:39.256 --> 00:07:43.156
Time and again, these men and
women struggled and sacrificed

00:07:43.156 --> 00:07:44.856
and worked until
their hands were raw

00:07:44.856 --> 00:07:46.966
so that we might
live a better life.

00:07:48.126 --> 00:07:50.326
They saw America as
bigger than the sum

00:07:50.326 --> 00:07:54.526
of our individual ambitions;
greater than all the differences

00:07:54.526 --> 00:07:57.866
of birth or wealth or faction.

00:07:57.866 --> 00:08:01.296
This is the journey
we continue today.

00:08:01.296 --> 00:08:05.516
We remain the most prosperous,
powerful nation on Earth.

00:08:05.516 --> 00:08:06.996
Our workers are no
less productive

00:08:06.996 --> 00:08:08.536
than when this crisis began.

00:08:09.056 --> 00:08:11.346
Our minds are no less
inventive, our goods

00:08:11.346 --> 00:08:14.566
and services no less needed
than they were last week

00:08:14.566 --> 00:08:17.516
or last month or last year.

00:08:17.686 --> 00:08:20.926
Our capacity remains
undiminished.

00:08:21.476 --> 00:08:25.886
But our time of standing pat,
of protecting narrow interests

00:08:25.886 --> 00:08:27.646
and putting off unpleasant
decisions -

00:08:27.686 --> 00:08:31.056
that time has surely passed.

00:08:31.056 --> 00:08:33.936
Starting today, we
must pick ourselves up,

00:08:33.936 --> 00:08:37.546
dust ourselves off, and
begin again the work

00:08:37.546 --> 00:08:38.696
of remaking America.

00:08:47.816 --> 00:08:50.186
For everywhere we look,
there is work to be done.

00:08:50.736 --> 00:08:54.526
The state of our economy calls
for action, bold and swift,

00:08:54.526 --> 00:08:57.476
and we will act - not
only to create new jobs,

00:08:57.476 --> 00:08:59.286
but to lay a new
foundation for growth.

00:09:00.446 --> 00:09:03.506
We will build the roads and
bridges, the electric grids

00:09:03.506 --> 00:09:06.786
and digital lines that feed our
commerce and bind us together.

00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:10.206
We will restore science
to its rightful place,

00:09:10.206 --> 00:09:12.256
and wield technology's wonders

00:09:12.336 --> 00:09:15.356
to raise health care's
quality and lower its cost.

00:09:15.896 --> 00:09:19.306
We will harness the sun
and the winds and the soil

00:09:19.426 --> 00:09:21.736
to fuel our cars and
run our factories.

00:09:21.996 --> 00:09:24.636
And we will transform
our schools and colleges

00:09:24.876 --> 00:09:27.706
and universities to meet
the demands of a new age.

00:09:28.806 --> 00:09:30.106
All this we can do.

00:09:30.366 --> 00:09:32.236
And all this we will do.

00:09:32.886 --> 00:09:38.266
Now, there are some who question
the scale of our ambitions -

00:09:39.336 --> 00:09:42.356
who suggest that our system
cannot tolerate too many

00:09:42.356 --> 00:09:43.786
big plans.

00:09:44.676 --> 00:09:46.026
Their memories are short.

00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:50.846
For they have forgotten what
this country has already done;

00:09:50.846 --> 00:09:52.586
what free men and
women can achieve

00:09:52.586 --> 00:09:55.236
when imagination is
joined to common purpose,

00:09:55.506 --> 00:09:57.646
and necessity to courage.

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:01.706
What the cynics fail
to understand is

00:10:01.706 --> 00:10:03.656
that the ground has
shifted beneath them -

00:10:04.136 --> 00:10:06.906
that the stale political
arguments that have consumed us

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:08.966
for so long no longer apply.

00:10:10.896 --> 00:10:13.496
The question we ask today is not
whether our government is too

00:10:13.496 --> 00:10:16.026
big or too small, but
whether it works -

00:10:16.686 --> 00:10:19.326
whether it helps families
find jobs at a decent wage,

00:10:19.686 --> 00:10:22.766
care they can afford, a
retirement that is dignified.

00:10:23.756 --> 00:10:26.946
Where the answer is yes,
we intend to move forward.

00:10:27.586 --> 00:10:29.946
Where the answer is
no, programs will end.

00:10:31.256 --> 00:10:34.176
And those of us who manage the
public's dollars will be held

00:10:34.176 --> 00:10:37.916
to account - to spend
wisely, reform bad habits,

00:10:38.436 --> 00:10:40.276
and do our business
in the light of day -

00:10:40.476 --> 00:10:43.866
because only then can we
restore the vital trust

00:10:43.866 --> 00:10:46.606
between a people and
their government.

00:10:48.296 --> 00:10:52.506
Nor is the question before us
whether the market is a force

00:10:52.726 --> 00:10:54.596
for good or ill.

00:10:54.896 --> 00:10:58.136
Its power to generate wealth
and expand freedom is unmatched,

00:10:59.126 --> 00:11:02.196
but this crisis has reminded
us that without a watchful eye,

00:11:03.066 --> 00:11:04.566
the market can spin
out of control -

00:11:05.196 --> 00:11:07.206
the nation cannot prosper long

00:11:08.056 --> 00:11:10.136
when it favors only
the prosperous.

00:11:10.656 --> 00:11:14.546
The success of our economy
has always depended not just

00:11:14.546 --> 00:11:16.546
on the size of our
Gross Domestic Product,

00:11:16.956 --> 00:11:20.196
but on the reach of our
prosperity; on the ability

00:11:20.196 --> 00:11:22.686
to extend opportunity
to every willing heart -

00:11:24.026 --> 00:11:27.826
not out of charity, but
because it is the surest route

00:11:27.826 --> 00:11:30.306
to our common good.

00:11:35.646 --> 00:11:41.566
As for our common defense,
we reject as false the choice

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:45.926
between our safety
and our ideals.

00:11:45.926 --> 00:11:50.016
Our Founding Fathers,
faced with perils

00:11:50.136 --> 00:11:54.006
that we can scarcely
imagine, drafted a charter

00:11:54.006 --> 00:11:57.256
to assure the rule of law
and the rights of man,

00:11:57.256 --> 00:12:00.116
a charter expanded by
the blood of generations.

00:12:01.346 --> 00:12:04.986
Those ideals still light the
world, and we will not give them

00:12:04.986 --> 00:12:08.136
up for expedience's sake.

00:12:09.436 --> 00:12:13.516
And so to all the other
peoples and governments

00:12:13.516 --> 00:12:15.726
who are watching today,
from the grandest capitals

00:12:15.726 --> 00:12:18.416
to the small village
where my father was born:

00:12:18.666 --> 00:12:22.296
know that America is a friend
of each nation and every man,

00:12:22.296 --> 00:12:25.756
woman, and child who seeks a
future of peace and dignity,

00:12:25.996 --> 00:12:28.616
and we are ready
to lead once more.

00:12:29.516 --> 00:12:44.176
[applause]

00:12:44.676 --> 00:12:47.626
Recall that earlier
generations faced down fascism

00:12:47.626 --> 00:12:50.416
and communism not just
with missiles and tanks,

00:12:50.416 --> 00:12:54.026
but with the sturdy alliances
and enduring convictions.

00:12:55.036 --> 00:12:57.656
They understood that our
power alone cannot protect us,

00:12:58.066 --> 00:13:00.316
nor does it entitle
us to do as we please.

00:13:00.736 --> 00:13:03.716
Instead, they knew
that our power grows

00:13:03.866 --> 00:13:06.606
through its prudent use;
our security emanates

00:13:06.606 --> 00:13:09.986
from the justness of our cause,
the force of our example,

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:14.306
the tempering qualities
of humility and restraint.

00:13:16.336 --> 00:13:18.416
We are the keepers
of this legacy.

00:13:18.916 --> 00:13:21.956
Guided by these principles
once more,

00:13:21.986 --> 00:13:23.406
we can meet those new threats

00:13:23.696 --> 00:13:27.076
that demand even greater effort
- even greater cooperation

00:13:27.076 --> 00:13:28.666
and understanding
between nations.

00:13:29.466 --> 00:13:32.396
We will begin to responsibly
leave Iraq to its people,

00:13:32.396 --> 00:13:35.756
and forge a hard-earned
peace in Afghanistan.

00:13:36.826 --> 00:13:39.796
With old friends and former
foes, we will work tirelessly

00:13:39.796 --> 00:13:41.296
to lessen the nuclear threat,

00:13:41.976 --> 00:13:45.916
and roll back the specter
of a warming planet.

00:13:45.916 --> 00:13:49.796
We will not apologize for our
way of life, nor will we waver

00:13:49.796 --> 00:13:53.406
in its defense, and for those
who seek to advance their aims

00:13:53.406 --> 00:13:55.596
by inducing terror and
slaughtering innocents,

00:13:55.856 --> 00:13:58.226
we say to you now that
our spirit is stronger

00:13:58.356 --> 00:14:01.386
and cannot be broken;
you cannot outlast us,

00:14:01.386 --> 00:14:03.026
and we will defeat you.

00:14:16.356 --> 00:14:21.436
For we know that our patchwork
heritage is a strength,

00:14:21.996 --> 00:14:22.726
not a weakness.

00:14:24.266 --> 00:14:26.226
We are a nation of
Christians and Muslims,

00:14:26.846 --> 00:14:29.716
Jews and Hindus -
and non-believers.

00:14:30.896 --> 00:14:33.206
We are shaped by every
language and culture,

00:14:33.516 --> 00:14:35.276
drawn from every
end of this Earth;

00:14:35.446 --> 00:14:38.816
and because we have tasted
the bitter swill of civil war

00:14:38.816 --> 00:14:42.406
and segregation, and emerged
from that dark chapter stronger

00:14:42.506 --> 00:14:45.166
and more united, we
cannot help but believe

00:14:45.166 --> 00:14:48.506
that the old hatreds shall
someday pass; that the lines

00:14:48.506 --> 00:14:52.436
of tribe shall soon dissolve;
that as the world grows smaller,

00:14:52.506 --> 00:14:54.686
our common humanity
shall reveal itself;

00:14:54.856 --> 00:14:57.686
and that America must
play its role in ushering

00:14:57.686 --> 00:14:58.886
in a new era of peace.

00:14:59.436 --> 00:15:04.806
To the Muslim world, we
seek a new way forward,

00:15:05.556 --> 00:15:08.156
based on mutual interest
and mutual respect.

00:15:08.156 --> 00:15:12.366
To those leaders around the
globe who seek to sow conflict,

00:15:13.096 --> 00:15:15.076
or blame their society's
ills on the West -

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.176
know that your people
will judge you

00:15:17.176 --> 00:15:19.946
on what you can build,
not what you destroy.

00:15:22.006 --> 00:15:28.896
To those who cling to power
through corruption and deceit

00:15:29.146 --> 00:15:32.296
and the silencing of
dissent, know that you are

00:15:32.296 --> 00:15:36.366
on the wrong side of history;
but that we will extend a hand

00:15:37.066 --> 00:15:38.926
if you are willing to
unclench your fist.

00:15:39.496 --> 00:15:46.996
To the people of poor nations,
we pledge to work alongside you

00:15:46.996 --> 00:15:49.886
to make your farms flourish
and let clean waters flow;

00:15:50.526 --> 00:15:53.456
to nourish starved bodies
and feed hungry minds.

00:15:54.576 --> 00:15:57.796
And to those nations like ours
that enjoy relative plenty,

00:15:58.566 --> 00:16:01.236
we say we can no longer
afford indifference

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:03.016
to suffering outside
our borders;

00:16:03.546 --> 00:16:05.896
nor can we consume
the world's resources

00:16:05.896 --> 00:16:07.116
without regard to effect.

00:16:08.316 --> 00:16:12.326
For the world has changed,
and we must change with it.

00:16:15.746 --> 00:16:18.626
As we consider the road
that unfolds before us,

00:16:19.726 --> 00:16:23.796
we remember with humble
gratitude those brave Americans

00:16:23.796 --> 00:16:27.496
who, at this very hour,
patrol far-off deserts

00:16:27.496 --> 00:16:28.646
and distant mountains.

00:16:28.866 --> 00:16:34.646
They have something to tell
us, just as the fallen heroes

00:16:34.646 --> 00:16:39.106
who lie in Arlington
whisper through the ages.

00:16:39.356 --> 00:16:41.716
We honor them not only
because they are the guardians

00:16:41.716 --> 00:16:45.976
of our liberty, but because they
embody the spirit of service;

00:16:47.236 --> 00:16:49.086
a willingness to find meaning

00:16:49.086 --> 00:16:51.366
in something greater
than themselves.

00:16:52.516 --> 00:16:54.256
And yet, at this moment -

00:16:55.206 --> 00:16:57.396
a moment that will
define a generation -

00:16:58.506 --> 00:17:02.486
it is precisely this spirit
that must inhabit us all.

00:17:04.316 --> 00:17:07.446
For as much as government
can do and must do,

00:17:07.486 --> 00:17:10.846
it is ultimately the
faith and determination

00:17:10.846 --> 00:17:13.516
of the American people upon
which this nation relies.

00:17:14.866 --> 00:17:17.696
It is the kindness to take in a
stranger when the levees break,

00:17:18.456 --> 00:17:21.476
the selflessness of workers who
would rather cut their hours

00:17:21.796 --> 00:17:23.976
than see a friend lose
their job which sees us

00:17:24.036 --> 00:17:25.286
through our darkest hours.

00:17:26.566 --> 00:17:29.796
It is the firefighter's courage
to storm a stairway filled

00:17:29.796 --> 00:17:33.536
with smoke, but also a parent's
willingness to nurture a child,

00:17:34.446 --> 00:17:38.966
that finally decides our fate.

00:17:39.166 --> 00:17:41.436
Our challenges may be new.

00:17:42.036 --> 00:17:46.316
The instruments with which
we meet them may be new.

00:17:46.736 --> 00:17:51.626
But those values upon which
our success depends - honesty

00:17:52.006 --> 00:17:56.806
and hard work, courage and fair
play, tolerance and curiosity,

00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:02.486
loyalty and patriotism
- these things are old.

00:18:04.716 --> 00:18:07.246
These things are true.

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:10.856
They have been the quiet force

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:12.306
of progress throughout
our history.

00:18:14.336 --> 00:18:17.456
What is demanded then is
a return to these truths.

00:18:17.896 --> 00:18:22.496
What is required of us now is
a new era of responsibility -

00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:26.016
a recognition, on the
part of every American,

00:18:26.096 --> 00:18:28.646
that we have duties to
ourselves, our nation,

00:18:28.646 --> 00:18:32.106
and the world, duties that
we do not grudgingly accept

00:18:32.106 --> 00:18:35.026
but rather seize gladly,
firm in the knowledge

00:18:35.186 --> 00:18:37.686
that there is nothing so
satisfying to the spirit,

00:18:37.686 --> 00:18:39.986
so defining of our character,

00:18:40.746 --> 00:18:43.306
than giving our all
to a difficult task.

00:18:44.376 --> 00:18:47.596
This is the price and the
promise of citizenship.

00:18:48.906 --> 00:18:52.646
This is the source of our
confidence - the knowledge

00:18:52.646 --> 00:18:55.356
that God calls on us to
shape an uncertain destiny.

00:18:56.636 --> 00:18:59.966
This is the meaning of our
liberty and our creed - why men

00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:03.846
and women and children of every
race and every faith can join

00:19:03.846 --> 00:19:06.346
in celebration across
this magnificent mall,

00:19:06.756 --> 00:19:09.706
and why a man whose father less

00:19:09.706 --> 00:19:12.946
than sixty years ago
might not have been served

00:19:12.946 --> 00:19:16.316
at a local restaurant
can now stand before you

00:19:16.316 --> 00:19:18.436
to take a most sacred oath.

00:19:19.516 --> 00:19:30.136
[cheers and applause]

00:19:30.636 --> 00:19:35.366
So let us mark this day with
remembrance, of who we are

00:19:35.806 --> 00:19:37.556
and how far we have traveled.

00:19:38.116 --> 00:19:43.516
In the year of America's birth,
in the coldest of months,

00:19:43.876 --> 00:19:47.316
a small band of patriots
huddled by dying campfires

00:19:47.366 --> 00:19:48.856
on the shores of an icy river.

00:19:50.046 --> 00:19:51.216
The capital was abandoned.

00:19:51.786 --> 00:19:53.646
The enemy was advancing.

00:19:54.046 --> 00:19:55.696
The snow was stained with blood.

00:19:57.706 --> 00:20:00.676
At a moment when the outcome
of our revolution was most

00:20:00.676 --> 00:20:02.746
in doubt, the father

00:20:02.746 --> 00:20:07.806
of our nation ordered these
words be read to the people:

00:20:07.966 --> 00:20:10.956
"Let it be told to the future
world...that in the depth

00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:13.506
of winter, when nothing but hope

00:20:13.506 --> 00:20:16.796
and virtue could survive...that
the city and the country,

00:20:17.026 --> 00:20:20.466
alarmed at one common danger,
came forth to meet it."

00:20:22.676 --> 00:20:27.796
America. In the face of our
common dangers, in this winter

00:20:27.796 --> 00:20:32.276
of our hardship, let us
remember these timeless words.

00:20:33.426 --> 00:20:34.516
With hope and virtue,

00:20:34.596 --> 00:20:36.976
let us brave once
more the icy currents,

00:20:37.316 --> 00:20:39.416
and endure what storms may come.

00:20:40.496 --> 00:20:42.666
Let it be said by our
children's children

00:20:42.876 --> 00:20:46.116
that when we were tested we
refused to let this journey end,

00:20:46.696 --> 00:20:49.106
that we did not turn
back nor did we falter;

00:20:49.636 --> 00:20:53.576
and with eyes fixed on the
horizon and God's grace upon us,

00:20:53.886 --> 00:20:56.086
we carried forth that
great gift of freedom

00:20:56.466 --> 00:20:59.376
and delivered it safely
to future generations.

00:20:59.936 --> 00:21:00.306
Thank you.

00:21:00.976 --> 00:21:04.266
God bless you, and God bless
the United States of America.

00:21:05.516 --> 00:21:11.500
[cheers and applause]
