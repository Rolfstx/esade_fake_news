00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:04.201
(plane engines roaring)

00:00:04.201 --> 00:00:06.618
(slow music)

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.500
- [Reporter] It's just after lunch onboard

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.930
Qantas Flight 72 from Singapore to Perth.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.420
- Sir, would you like a drink?

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.750
- [Reporter] Qantas flight
attendant Fuzzy Maiava

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.654
is busy attending to
passengers in the cabin.

00:00:23.654 --> 00:00:24.910
- [Fuzzy] Orange juice for you, madam.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.203
- If I can make your flight
a lot easier, I'm your man.

00:00:29.251 --> 00:00:32.120
And I thought it was going to
be another great day, yeah.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.060
- [Reporter] Up in the cockpit.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.530
- How's everything going?

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.363
- [Pilot] Very good.

00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:37.880
- [Reporter] Captain Kevin
Sullivan has just climbed

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.008
back into his seat after a
rest break, when suddenly.

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:44.050
(instruments beeping)

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.550
The plane's autopilot disconnects.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.350
- Autopilot one appears
to have disconnected.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.895
- And then we started
getting stall warnings.

00:00:52.895 --> 00:00:54.193
(alarm ringing)

00:00:54.193 --> 00:00:55.943
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.237
- And then we started
getting overspeed warnings.

00:01:00.237 --> 00:01:01.360
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.627
- [Reporter] And then it happens.

00:01:03.627 --> 00:01:04.958
(dramatic music)

00:01:04.958 --> 00:01:06.218
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:01:06.218 --> 00:01:07.947
(alarm ringing)

00:01:07.947 --> 00:01:09.030
Stall, stall.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.950
- The plane, it started going down,

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.710
pitching down violently down.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.740
- [Reporter] Tonight for the first time

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.740
the previously untold story of
Qantas' worst ever accident.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.650
- Bang, my head went
through the cabin ceiling.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.043
- [Reporter] How a plane went psycho,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.550
injuring 100 passengers and crew.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.060
- You died six or seven
times on the operating table.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.640
- I am lucky to be here alive.

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.900
- [Reporter] And destroying
once happy lives.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.569
- It got to the point where
I tried to take my own life.

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:49.402
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:01:49.402 --> 00:01:52.090
- [Reporter] The hero pilot who
fought against his own plane

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.812
to save his passengers and crew.

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:54.830
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.720
- The automation is
there to keep you safe,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.470
and was actually trying to kill us.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.540
- [Reporter] And how the
lessons of Qantas Flight 72

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.360
have gone unheeded.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.010
- All of us are deeply
sorry for the loss of life.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.760
- [Reporter] With two planes
crashing within six months

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.760
of each other, killing
all 346 people on board.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.190
- When you see what's happening

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.000
with the 737 MAX accidents,
they're the same.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.140
They were in no man's land.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.580
They didn't know what was happening.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.560
And their instinctive
reaction to pull back

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.950
and stop the ground from hitting them

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.573
was not enough to save the day.

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.990
(slow music)

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.390
- [Reporter] Kevin Sullivan
doesn't fly anymore.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.920
What happened that day in the skies

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.530
over the Indian Ocean has
affected him profoundly.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.360
- I could have hidden it, but
I think it's more courageous

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.360
to be honest with yourself

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.033
and honest to say yeah, it's affected me.

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.070
I don't shirk my responsibility

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.740
as a commercial pilot and the captain.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.793
I reached the point where
it was best that I stop.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.290
- [Reporter] Growing up in California,

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.763
Kevin always dreamed of being a pilot.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.590
And by his early 20s he was a Top Gun

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.520
fighter pilot in the US Navy.

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.910
- As a F-14 pilot in the Cold War

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.660
I flew off aircraft carriers,
the landing area moves.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.070
At night you can't see the landing area

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.960
until you're actually on it.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.720
We were essentially at war.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.720
We trained and flew to that
level of extreme readiness.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.330
- [Reporter] Then came an
opportunity to flyMirage jets

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.440
as part of an exchange programme

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.430
with the Royal Australian Air Force.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.110
- It's a speed machine.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.143
At low level I've been very fast,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.569
over 600 knots, 1,200 kilometres an hour.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.570
(rock music)

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.700
- [Reporter] The young
American loved Australia

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.010
and those jets so much he
ended up settling here.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.160
After you, Kevin.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.993
- Thank you.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.530
How did you organise this?

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.600
- [Reporter] What do you think?

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.620
- [Kevin] Yeah, it's pretty special.

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.740
- [Reporter] The Mirage III, there she is.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:22.420
- We called it the French lady,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.613
or the Aussies did, and I do too.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.250
No, you can't stand on the seat.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.680
- You need a degree just to get in.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.080
35 years along life's runway
and Kevin Sullivan's love

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.750
for his French lady hasn't dimmed.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.290
- It's just like getting
into a Formula 1 car.

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.230
You don't have much room.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:41.397
It becomes part of you.

00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:43.620
- Not a bad place to hone your skills.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.350
- There's no automation on this thing.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.570
- (laughs) You need to know how to fly

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.260
this one by hand, I tell ya.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.740
Kevin eventually moved
onto a job with Qantas

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.752
flying its biggest passenger jets.

00:04:55.752 --> 00:04:59.085
(plane engines roaring)

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.030
- How's everything going?

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.640
- Smooth sailing.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.570
- [Reporter] By October
2008, he's had decades

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.340
of experience as a commercial pilot.

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.340
But it's his time as a Top
Gun that will prove crucial.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.050
- We were coming up to the
northwest coast of Australia.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.920
We could see it out the windscreen.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.620
And the Indian Ocean was calm and blue.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.330
- [Reporter] On this clear,
blue day at the controls

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.870
of a Qantas Airbus, Captain Kevin Sullivan

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.514
is about to be tested in the
most dramatic way possible.

00:05:36.514 --> 00:05:38.200
(instruments beeping)

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.140
- Autopilot one appears
to have disconnected.

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.290
- When was the first
indication of trouble?

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.070
- The autopilot disconnected.

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.555
And then we started
getting stall warnings.

00:05:48.555 --> 00:05:49.911
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:05:49.911 --> 00:05:51.617
(alarm ringing)

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:52.680
Stall, stall.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.230
- It sounds like, "Stall, stall."

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.770
It means the plane will stop flying,

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.380
it will start to go down.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.453
And then we started
getting overspeed warnings.

00:06:01.453 --> 00:06:02.490
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.573
- Stall warning and
overspeed at the same time.

00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:08.347
- It's impossible.

00:06:08.347 --> 00:06:10.620
- It doesn't make sense
to me because overspeed

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.790
is you're at your maximum limit

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.277
and stall it means you're
at your minimum speed limit.

00:06:15.277 --> 00:06:16.738
- What the hell?

00:06:16.738 --> 00:06:18.571
Get Pete back in here.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.730
- First officer to the
flight deck, please.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:25.220
- And then the plane started moving.

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.127
And initially it was a dip.

00:06:28.127 --> 00:06:28.960
(dramatic music)

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.032
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:31.743
(alarm ringing)

00:06:31.743 --> 00:06:33.840
- And then it started going down,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.343
pitching down aggressively
and violently down.

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:42.680
(alarm ringing)

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:45.950
It generated a force that
we had to brace ourselves

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.340
against the instrument glare shield

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.510
to stop from basically
hitting the ceiling,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:52.203
even with our seat belts secured.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:56.240
I was accelerating down
towards the Indian Ocean

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.300
and certainly my windscreens

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.410
were filled with the Indian Ocean.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:01.737
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:02.570
(alarm ringing)

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:05.380
- QF72 is in a death dive

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.133
and refusing to let Kevin take control.

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:11.660
This is my broader understanding.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.750
So the plane's flying along.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.260
The sensors are giving
some sort of information

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.040
at the computer system that
the plane is pointed upwards

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.140
so it tries to overcorrect.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.141
And then obviously points you back down.

00:07:24.141 --> 00:07:26.400
Is that a fair summary?

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.850
- Yes, in a way.

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.457
It's saying, "Sorry,
Kev, I'm protecting you.

00:07:31.457 --> 00:07:33.720
"So I'm not going to let you stop me."

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:38.670
Like the HAL 9000 in
"2001: A Space Odyssey"

00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:41.340
where Dave asks him to
open the pod bay doors

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:44.037
and HAL says, "I'm sorry, Dave.

00:07:44.037 --> 00:07:45.640
"I can't let you do that."

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:48.157
I'm pulling back on the
stick and I'm saying,

00:07:48.157 --> 00:07:51.220
"Hey, HAL, stop moving the nose."

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.579
And it's like, "I'm sorry,
Kev, I can't let you do that."

00:07:54.579 --> 00:07:55.412
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:07:55.412 --> 00:07:58.990
- [Reporter] But no way is
this proud ex-fighter pilot

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:02.188
going to let a rogue computer beat him.

00:08:02.188 --> 00:08:03.500
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.940
- I was in a near death position

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:07.880
and I was going to fight to the death

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.240
to make sure that didn't happen.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.410
(mid-tempo music)

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:15.330
- [Reporter] Qantas
Flight 72 from Singapore

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:18.690
is cruising comfortably at 37,000 feet.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:21.140
- [Woman] I'll have a glass
of white wine, please.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.180
- Glass of white wine.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.970
- [Reporter] In just over two hours,

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:28.750
the Airbus A330 will land in Perth.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.023
It's been a routine flight.

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:33.600
Some of the passengers onboard

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.280
are off duty Qantas staff
returning from holidays.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.950
Among them, Bruce Southcott,
a flight services manager

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.010
travelling with his wife, Caroline.

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.503
- Aircraft was flying flat and still.

00:08:45.503 --> 00:08:49.657
And I watched the glass of wine
sit there without a ripple.

00:08:49.657 --> 00:08:51.114
(alarm ringing)

00:08:51.114 --> 00:08:51.947
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:08:51.947 --> 00:08:52.800
- [Reporter] But up in the cockpit

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:56.958
the plane's flight control
system is going haywire.

00:08:56.958 --> 00:08:58.350
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.710
- [Reporter] The aircraft's computers

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:01.700
are telling Captain Kevin Sullivan

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.377
his plane is about to stall.

00:09:04.377 --> 00:09:05.587
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:10.587
- [Reporter] And then suddenly
the plane is hurtling down

00:09:11.366 --> 00:09:13.403
towards the Indian Ocean.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:17.650
- There wasn't really any first sign.

00:09:17.650 --> 00:09:18.850
It just happened.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.530
Like the hand of God had just
pushed the aircraft down.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.620
There was no woo, let's
go, as a rollercoaster.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.460
It was just like, slam.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.704
- [Reporter] Bruce is
wearing his seat belt.

00:09:29.704 --> 00:09:30.537
(dramatic music)

00:09:30.537 --> 00:09:33.270
But Caroline is just coming
back from the toilet.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:37.053
- I remember getting hit
on the head with the plane.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.630
And I just went bang.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.630
And before I could think, bang again.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.620
And then the third bang,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.600
my head went through the cabin ceiling.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.930
After the third time it hit me on the head

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.230
I pretty much was knocked out.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:56.100
- [Reporter] An off duty
Qantas pilot, Peter Casey

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.160
and his wife, Diana, a Qantas
customer service manager,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.100
have left their seats to say hello

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.230
to flight attendant Fuzzy Maiava.

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:07.640
- Fuzzy, God love him, was down there

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:09.400
checking out the catering, as he does.

00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:11.180
The three of us chatting away.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.180
- I placed my meal in the oven.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:16.220
I was focused on the timer,
you see, 'cause I was hungry.

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.483
And then when I saw the exact
time on it, it was 13 seconds.

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:23.423
And that's when I saw the corner of my eye

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.550
someone had just shot up.

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.330
And I just sort of looked down

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:31.063
and the plane was
disappearing from my feet.

00:10:33.107 --> 00:10:35.070
(body thudding)

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.660
- I heard a slight change in
the airflow of the aeroplane,

00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.090
and I thought, oh, this is interesting.

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.078
And the next thing you know,

00:10:44.078 --> 00:10:45.373
whomp, up we went.

00:10:46.717 --> 00:10:47.830
- I must have hit something,
must have hit the ceiling

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.219
'cause I just, I was knocked out.

00:10:51.219 --> 00:10:52.800
- The three of us up in the ceiling

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.150
probably only for seconds

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:59.010
but it seemed like an eternity.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.550
- [Reporter] The Casey's daughters,

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:04.490
17-year-old Becky and 18-year-old Elise,

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.137
are at the front of the cabin.

00:11:06.137 --> 00:11:09.160
- The first nosedive, my sister,

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.290
she grabbed onto the bottom of her chair,

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.890
and she looked up at me as I
was on the top of the aeroplane.

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:17.320
- [Reporter] You were actually
pinned to the ceiling?

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.930
- Yeah.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.130
- [Reporter] Feel like forever?

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:21.388
- It did.

00:11:21.388 --> 00:11:23.034
It felt like a few minutes.

00:11:23.034 --> 00:11:24.631
(alarm ringing)

00:11:24.631 --> 00:11:26.540
- [Reporter] Back in the
cockpit, Kevin Sullivan

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.513
is desperately trying to take
back control of his plane.

00:11:30.513 --> 00:11:32.210
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:35.080
- We're basically fighting
for our lives at this stage.

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.480
- They had to very quickly discover

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.340
what part of the aeroplane
was trying to kill them

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:41.990
and how to stop it from doing so.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.130
- [Reporter] If there's any other pilot

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:48.350
who understands exactly
what Captain Sullivan

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.910
is facing, it's the other Sully.

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:55.390
Captain Chesley Sullenberger
lost both his engines

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.750
in a bird strike and had to land his plane

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:00.980
in New York's Hudson River.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:02.930
- Captain, I'd like
your insight if I could.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:07.330
I'm trying to tap into I guess
the anguish of that moment,

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:10.520
what it must have been like for the pilot.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:12.490
- Well at first it would
have been confusing,

00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:15.140
surprising, a huge startle factor.

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.820
And then one would
immediately begin to act

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.960
to regain control of the aeroplane.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.920
- [Reporter] Kevin Sullivan's next move

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.140
is completely counter-intuitive.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.163
Instead of pulling back on the
control stick, he lets it go.

00:12:32.830 --> 00:12:33.670
- I have a choice to make,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.765
do I hold onto it, or do I release it?

00:12:36.765 --> 00:12:40.310
My military training for out of control

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:44.670
is to release, neutralise controls.

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:45.800
- [Reporter] It works.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.210
The plane is no longer
falling from the sky.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.104
But now passengers are being
smashed back down to the floor.

00:12:53.104 --> 00:12:54.914
(dramatic music)

00:12:54.914 --> 00:12:57.430
(metal clanging)

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:01.910
- We heard an almighty
crash coming from the cabin.

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:05.940
And that was the people's bodies.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.833
That was the galleys coming apart.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.450
And it sounds like a 40
foot shipping container

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:16.960
full of cutlery and glass

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.863
that is sent down a
ramp into a brick wall.

00:13:22.531 --> 00:13:24.450
- I just came crashing down.

00:13:24.450 --> 00:13:25.930
My sister, she was eating,

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:28.960
and her fork went in my arm. (laughs)

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.610
Got a bit stuck when I came down.

00:13:32.175 --> 00:13:34.260
It's the little things that you remember.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.491
- When I came back down I hit the armrest.

00:13:38.491 --> 00:13:40.010
- Armrest, yeah.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.750
- And then I realised that all my bones

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.220
were clicking in my back, and I realised

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.993
that there was something
terribly wrong, very wrong.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.380
I couldn't move off the floor.

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.840
The staff were asking me
to go back to my chair.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.630
And I couldn't get up at all,

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:00.310
I couldn't move my legs at all.

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:01.560
- [Reporter] Your legs weren't working?

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.393
- Nope.

00:14:02.393 --> 00:14:03.570
My ankle was broken.

00:14:03.570 --> 00:14:05.420
So my ankle was just sort of hanging.

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:08.600
Eventually another passenger
came and picked me up

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.550
and put me in my chair.

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.790
- Hit the galley bench.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.350
That's what woke me up.

00:14:14.350 --> 00:14:18.070
All I could hear was the
crushing sounds my knee is going.

00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.230
I don't know what the heck is going on.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:22.450
All I see is blood rushing
out of Peter's head.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:24.263
And Diana, she's unconscious.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.690
And then I see the two
girls I was looking after.

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.430
Oh man, one of them who
was sat on the aisle seat,

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:33.410
she stuck her hand out to me

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.030
and she was just crying.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.730
And to me, that's like my own daughter.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:41.950
I mean, I just couldn't do anything.

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:45.845
And I just felt so helpless
because I couldn't move.

00:14:45.845 --> 00:14:47.550
(dramatic music)

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:49.760
- [Reporter] Back in the
cockpit, Kevin Sullivan

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.930
has pulled the plane
out of its death dive.

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:54.160
- What the hell was that?

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.750
- [Reporter] But he's
still fighting for control.

00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:59.090
- It's the primary flight computer.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:03.450
- Now we're in this revolver
of faulting systems.

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:07.620
- In effect, this is a
total system collapse.

00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.900
- The plane is starting to melt down.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.500
- Automatic brake's not working.

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.690
Four is not working.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.780
- Let's get us back up to 37,000 feet.

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:19.400
- I'm still pretty coherent.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.300
Yes, my cages are a little bit rattled

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:24.370
because we don't know what's happening.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:27.290
- [Reporter] And just two minutes later--

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:29.290
- Don't you do it.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.030
- [Reporter] It happens again.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.863
(dramatic music)

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:39.100
- I'm basically a passenger,
I'm an observer now.

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:40.450
The automation that's there

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:42.070
is supposed to be keeping me safe,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:44.180
not putting me into harm's way.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:46.360
And I got very angry.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.754
- I thought it was the end.

00:15:48.754 --> 00:15:49.587
- Really?

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:00.933
It was so violent you thought
you were going to die?

00:16:02.564 --> 00:16:03.397
- Yeah.

00:16:07.871 --> 00:16:09.517
I think being so young as well

00:16:09.517 --> 00:16:14.030
and not having experienced life
outside of high school yet,

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.450
you don't really know what
to expect in the big world.

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.750
And honestly, I just thought that was it.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.340
- All I could hear was the
sounds that we were going to die.

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:25.690
But you just hope to God
that it happens quick.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:26.620
- Death?

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:30.480
- Yes, and I don't want to feel any pain.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.180
I was frozen like a block of ice

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:35.457
just waiting for it to happen.

00:16:35.457 --> 00:16:37.820
(slow dramatic music)

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.510
- [Reporter] Once again, Kevin Sullivan's

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.660
military training saves his plane.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:44.730
- We have lost auto pitch trim.

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.110
- [Reporter] But he has no idea if,

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.120
or when, it will happen again.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.025
- Another failure in trim three.

00:16:52.025 --> 00:16:52.858
Reset?

00:16:52.858 --> 00:16:53.691
- No, no.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:58.360
- [Reporter] Everyone responds
to trauma differently.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.780
Kevin Sullivan cracks a joke.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.280
He picks a line from another

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:05.650
of his favourite movies, "Flying High".

00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:10.180
- Looks like I picked a bad
day to quit sniffing glue.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.450
- [Reporter] First Officer Peter
Lipsett had been on a break

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.800
when the plane went into its dive.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.670
He's injured, but he makes
it back to the cockpit.

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.340
- That's a shit fight out there.

00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:22.161
I think I've just broken my nose.

00:17:22.161 --> 00:17:23.914
- Congratulations.

00:17:23.914 --> 00:17:25.264
Strap in, we're in trouble.

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:29.130
- I made the assessment
that we were in trouble.

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:34.130
And I've never used those
terms in any situation

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.313
prior to that in my extreme flying career.

00:17:38.513 --> 00:17:39.346
(instruments beeping)

00:17:39.346 --> 00:17:41.146
- Mayday, mayday, mayday,

00:17:41.146 --> 00:17:43.630
Qantas 72, Qantas 72,

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:45.540
flight control computer malfunctions

00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:47.920
and we have significant injuries onboard.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.300
- [Reporter] Kevin Sullivan
is in the fight of his life.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.210
The Qantas captain has
twice managed to stop

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:56.930
his out of control plane from plunging

00:17:56.930 --> 00:17:58.530
into the Indian Ocean.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:00.690
- Tracking direct to Learmonth.

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:05.200
- [Reporter] He needs to get
his 315 passengers and crew

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:08.993
down onto the ground fast
before it happens again.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:14.890
He heads for the nearest airport,
the RAAF base at Learmonth

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.290
on Western Australia's northwest coast.

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:23.290
- I couldn't risk exposing
myself and the passengers

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:28.480
to an out of control aeroplane
any longer than I had to.

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.463
And Learmonth was just off our left wing,

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.163
and that's where we decided to go.

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:37.730
- [Reporter] In the cabin behind him,

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:41.317
more than 100 passengers are injured.

00:18:41.317 --> 00:18:42.150
- [Woman] What's happening?

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:44.150
- [Reporter] Many have
been knocked unconscious.

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.893
Others have broken bones
and bleeding wounds.

00:18:49.216 --> 00:18:50.902
- Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the flight deck.

00:18:50.902 --> 00:18:55.110
All passengers to fasten
seat belts immediately.

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:59.030
- [Reporter] Caroline
Southcott is in absolute agony.

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.370
Her back is broken, and
a single piece of skin

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.570
is keeping her foot attached to her leg.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:11.203
But she no choice, she
has to sit in her seat.

00:19:12.487 --> 00:19:13.320
- I was really worried my bones

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.010
were going to go through my spinal cord,

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.020
so I had to hold myself up on the armrest

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.820
for it must have been 45, 50 minutes.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.870
- It wouldn't have been
easy 'cause she said

00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:25.410
she could physically
feel and hear her spine

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:27.850
just grating like that against each other.

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:29.470
- Yeah, it was a very funny noise.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:32.810
Prior to that I've never
had pain, bad pain.

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:35.540
So it was a matter of life and death.

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:38.310
It was a matter of suck it up, princess,

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:39.865
you've got to do something here.

00:19:39.865 --> 00:19:41.330
(both laughing)

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.100
- [Reporter] Caroline now notices

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.920
that her nearly severed left
foot is facing backwards.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.660
- During all this pain she looked down

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.237
at her ankle and said, "That's not right.

00:19:52.237 --> 00:19:53.720
"I'm not happy with that."

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:57.113
She pulled the ankle forward, rotated it,

00:19:58.352 --> 00:19:59.200
and clicked it back into place.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.220
- Yeah, reset it.

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.049
I think there was no choice.

00:20:02.049 --> 00:20:05.450
It was fight or die.

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:06.710
- [Reporter] In the rear galley

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:10.300
Peter and Diana are all badly injured.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.010
Fuzzy is desperate to get to
the two unaccompanied children

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:18.220
he is looking after,
but his legs won't work.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.970
- I couldn't even move.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:23.520
I wanted to, I tried so much to reach out.

00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.640
And I knew I could not move.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.960
- [Reporter] Peter is bleeding
profusely from a head wound.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.630
Diana has suffered a badly
injured back and shoulder.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:35.500
But somehow, she finds the strength

00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.959
to help the people around her.

00:20:37.959 --> 00:20:38.880
(slow music)

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.910
- I tell you what, Diana,
man, she was incredible.

00:20:40.910 --> 00:20:42.810
She's like, she reminded me of The Hulk.

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.960
You know, adrenaline came out of her

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.410
and she could lift anything.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.010
And she made it happen.

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.000
And I can hear Diana saying,
"Okay, Fuzzy, you're next."

00:20:53.078 --> 00:20:54.614
- Come on, nearly there.

00:20:54.614 --> 00:20:55.559
- [Fuzzy] Man.

00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:57.429
- [Diana] There we go, just
going to put your belt on.

00:20:57.429 --> 00:20:58.262
- She was incredible.

00:20:58.262 --> 00:20:59.095
I'm telling you right now, man,

00:20:59.095 --> 00:21:03.030
that lady deserves
recognition for what she did.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.490
- [Reporter] Pretty amazing
wife you have there.

00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:06.696
- Mm, very proud of her.

00:21:06.696 --> 00:21:07.529
Very proud.

00:21:07.529 --> 00:21:12.110
- Diana Casey is one of the
true heroes of this story,

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.910
but you won't hear her speak.

00:21:13.910 --> 00:21:18.260
It's an slap in the face to
Diana's extraordinary courage,

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.340
but Qantas has refused to let Diana

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:26.170
or any of its current staff be
interviewed for this programme.

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.550
As a former employee, Fuzzy Maiava

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:33.560
isn't bound by such
small-minded constraints.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.020
- How on Earth did she
manage to get Fuzzy,

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.510
if you'll allow me, a reasonably big unit,

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:42.450
up off the ground into the seat?

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:47.177
- Oh man, she just sort of
like just grabbed my hands,

00:21:47.177 --> 00:21:48.177
and just grabbed me.

00:21:49.078 --> 00:21:52.933
And I felt like I was being
pulled by a 6'8" (laughs)

00:21:54.846 --> 00:21:56.770
athlete, you know.

00:21:56.770 --> 00:21:57.930
And then she just looked at me

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:59.017
and she just shook me and says,

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:00.050
"We're going to be okay,"

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:02.987
and she gave me a kiss
on the forehead and said,

00:22:02.987 --> 00:22:04.310
"You're going to be fine."

00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:06.790
- In circumstances like that

00:22:06.790 --> 00:22:09.960
the pilot in the cockpit gives an order

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.330
for people to sit down immediately.

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.320
Well, that's what they got to do.

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.790
But in this circumstance there were people

00:22:15.790 --> 00:22:19.800
that were unsecured, and
she took it upon herself

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.570
to break the protocol because a need to,

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:26.400
and I totally completely agree with her,

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.350
there was a need to, to care for people

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:31.007
that needed to be secured.

00:22:31.007 --> 00:22:31.840
(dramatic music)

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.673
- Final check.

00:22:32.673 --> 00:22:34.010
- [Reporter] With dozens of his passengers

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.540
requiring urgent medical attention,

00:22:36.540 --> 00:22:41.540
Kevin Sullivan now has to
land his crippled Airbus A330

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.820
on that remote airfield at Learmonth.

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.473
- Okay, we're on visual approach.

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:49.700
Manual thrust.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.520
Manual pitch trim.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.740
- [Reporter] He's now flying
his aircraft entirely by hand.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:58.200
But Kevin knows that at any moment,

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:02.163
the plane's computer might
try to wrest back control.

00:23:03.010 --> 00:23:03.843
- Gear down.

00:23:05.512 --> 00:23:06.813
(instruments beeping)

00:23:06.813 --> 00:23:09.430
- [Kevin] 1,000 feet, but now we know

00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:13.840
that at this point if something happens

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.149
we don't have the altitude to recover.

00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:18.649
- Don't you do it.

00:23:22.943 --> 00:23:26.174
(tyres squealing)

00:23:26.174 --> 00:23:28.144
(people applauding)

00:23:28.144 --> 00:23:32.660
- I remember when we
landed, everyone clapped.

00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:36.260
- Kevin's job was outstanding under what

00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:39.270
I would believe to be immense pressure.

00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.700
- [Reporter] Did you allow
yourself just the briefest moment

00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.160
to look down at your arms and legs

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.860
and think, my goodness, I'm alive?

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.023
- No, I made another quip.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:53.810
I did my Arnie impersonation
from True Lies.

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:55.517
I said, "Ya, a little bit of excitement,

00:23:55.517 --> 00:23:59.425
"otherwise dull day,"
as we're rolling down--

00:23:59.425 --> 00:24:00.640
- You're not even joking, are you?

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.150
- I'm serious, yeah, of course,

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:06.263
because yeah, okay, so that's my release.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:11.360
- [Reporter] Only now is Kevin
Sullivan able to walk back

00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.316
through his aircraft
to inspect the damage.

00:24:14.316 --> 00:24:15.351
(dramatic music)

00:24:15.351 --> 00:24:17.934
(child crying)

00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:23.383
- I call it the walk that changed my life.

00:24:25.894 --> 00:24:27.044
It's quite confronting.

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:32.700
The interior of the cabin
was almost destroyed.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:37.220
There are holes above the
seats where passenger's heads

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:40.817
have punctured the plastic,
and there's lots of 'em.

00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:46.020
Of course, there were children,
children had huge contusions

00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:48.500
on their heads where some were bleeding,

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.470
and the parents are
holding their children,

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.320
trying to console them.

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:59.210
As I walked past, the look of,

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:03.453
look what you did to my
kid, will never leave.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:06.830
- There was almost a moment for you

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:11.070
as you made that walk where you felt it

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.330
that your heart was breaking.

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.770
Is that true?

00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:14.603
- Yes.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.380
Time out. (laughs)

00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:25.193
So this is a critical part.

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.393
That's a valid question.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.990
- I imagine that's one of the most

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.640
significant moments of your life.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.390
I'm the head honcho.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:46.320
I'm the one that has to show
leadership and strength.

00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:50.790
But it's pretty hard when emotional chunks

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:55.790
are being ripped off you as
you move through the aeroplane.

00:26:00.105 --> 00:26:02.720
(dramatic music)

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.260
- [Reporter] Qantas Flight 72 has landed

00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.520
at the remote Learmonth air strip

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.730
on the northwest coast
of Western Australia.

00:26:10.730 --> 00:26:14.650
Captain Kevin Sullivan has
brought his plane down safely.

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:17.630
But with so many lives in the balance,

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.354
the emergency is far from over.

00:26:19.354 --> 00:26:22.030
(sirens wailing)

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:24.743
Local rescue crews
swarm through the plane.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:27.540
- The emergency services
crew came onboard,

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.290
and it was just like, it was chaos.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.783
The pain was unbearable.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.100
I think I nearly passed out.

00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:36.840
And the next minute I got a morphine stick

00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.470
stuck in my mouth.

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:40.690
Yeah, "Suck on that, big fella."

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:43.010
- I imagine that was a pretty big relief.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.626
- Yeah, he said, "Suck
on that, big fella."

00:26:44.626 --> 00:26:46.976
I can remember that,
"Suck on that, big fella."

00:26:49.075 --> 00:26:51.908
(muffled talking)

00:26:53.764 --> 00:26:57.162
- The safest course of action
was for me to come into here,

00:26:57.162 --> 00:27:00.898
not only because of
the aeroplane behaviour

00:27:00.898 --> 00:27:05.630
but also the injuries
that we've all sustained.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.610
- [Reporter] In the
terminal, Captain Sullivan

00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:10.690
grabs a megaphone and
addresses the passengers

00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:12.872
who've made it off the Airbus uninjured.

00:27:12.872 --> 00:27:14.342
(muffled talking)

00:27:14.342 --> 00:27:16.330
- The runway looked pretty good to me.

00:27:16.330 --> 00:27:18.758
(people laughing)

00:27:18.758 --> 00:27:21.440
(people applauding)

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.050
I made some comment about the runway

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:29.050
looked pretty damn good to me
as we rolled out for landing.

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.714
And at that point, everybody
was cheering again.

00:27:32.714 --> 00:27:34.920
(dramatic music)

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.600
- [Reporter] Kevin is
relieved to be on the ground,

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.300
but he now knows what was
happening in the cabin

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.993
while he was wrestling
for control of the plane.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:48.793
More than 100 passengers are
injured, some critically.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:52.570
- There were accelerated into the ceiling

00:27:53.827 --> 00:27:56.210
and with such a force that their heads

00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:57.620
broke through the plastic--

00:27:57.620 --> 00:27:58.830
- It's not soft.

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:00.472
- [Kevin] It's aviation grade plastic.

00:28:00.472 --> 00:28:02.280
(dramatic music)

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.700
- [Reporter] The most seriously injured

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.260
are airlifted to Perth

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.580
by the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.083
Among them, Caroline Southcott.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.270
- The pain in my back, it was pretty bad.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.400
I can remember just
fighting to keep breathing,

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.170
because I thought if I stop
breathing I'll go unconscious

00:28:19.170 --> 00:28:21.363
and then no one's going to get me back.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.220
- You're initially thinking about,

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.620
well, what's post-injury going to be like?

00:28:28.620 --> 00:28:32.820
How is she going to walk, and
will she walk, and all that.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.010
And then they take it to the next level

00:28:35.010 --> 00:28:37.917
and say to ya, "Well no,
what we're saying here

00:28:37.917 --> 00:28:40.800
"is that her survival is in doubt."

00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.914
And that's when I went, "Oh."

00:28:42.914 --> 00:28:44.643
That's when you do freak.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:48.960
- [Reporter] She's rushed
into emergency surgery

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.900
with a broken back.

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:52.913
Her life is slipping away.

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:58.870
- You died six or seven
times on the operating table.

00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:03.870
- I'm lucky I can walk and I'm
lucky to be here alive, yeah.

00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:05.780
- How would you describe the surgery

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.280
that Caroline went through?

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.800
- In her graphic terms?

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.633
- [Reporter] Yeah.

00:29:09.633 --> 00:29:12.487
- "They cut me down here and
then they put me gizzards

00:29:12.487 --> 00:29:14.540
"on the table so they could get to it."

00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.430
Like your spine's on your
back, as everyone knows.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.290
But the injury had to be addressed

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.430
from the front of the spine.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:22.850
So they had to do all that.

00:29:22.850 --> 00:29:25.770
And then put everything back
in place and stitch her up.

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:28.020
- They put it on the
table and did their work

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:28.980
and then they put it back in again.

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:29.930
- Threw it back in.

00:29:30.850 --> 00:29:34.420
- [Reporter] But there's pain
behind Caroline's laughter.

00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:38.333
Her body is now a miracle
of surgical architecture.

00:29:39.855 --> 00:29:42.790
- They were able to replace
my vertebrae with a cage,

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.920
and biological cement and bone from my hip

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.850
that I can even move.

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.023
It's not 100%, but it's
better than it was.

00:29:54.466 --> 00:29:55.299
Here they come.

00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:56.132
- Geesey, geesies.

00:29:56.132 --> 00:29:56.965
- Come on goosey, goosey, goose.

00:29:56.965 --> 00:29:57.798
- [Bruce] Food.

00:29:57.798 --> 00:30:00.150
- [Reporter] Then there's
the mental anguish.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:04.860
Nowadays, Bruce and Caroline
live as near recluses

00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:06.623
on their property in Queensland.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:11.083
It's one of the few places they feel safe.

00:30:14.849 --> 00:30:16.880
(slow music)

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:21.333
Becky refuses to fly and lives
with the trauma every day.

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.950
- [Reporter] I can see how painful it is,

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:29.200
these memories that
you're still living with.

00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.783
It's still very real.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:38.523
- Very.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.373
Very.

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.283
- How has this changed you?

00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:52.893
- I'm quite an emotional
ball now. (laughs)

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.970
I saw psychologists.

00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:59.093
They diagnosed me with PTSD.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:02.313
It's not a fun thing
to have when you're 17.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:10.520
I was medicated until I was
pregnant with my first child,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:13.010
and that's when I had to come off them.

00:31:13.874 --> 00:31:17.150
Yeah, it's not a nice thing
when you're a teenager.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.230
- [Reporter] Flight attendant Fuzzy Maiava

00:31:23.230 --> 00:31:25.943
can't work anymore
because of his injuries.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.530
- I had to replace both knees.

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.520
I have now got two titanium knees.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.520
And I ruptured a spleen and my spine.

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.550
I have seven damaged discs.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:45.420
That's a pain I get every day,

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:50.420
and they trigger on the
nightmares and the flashbacks.

00:31:52.555 --> 00:31:55.090
(dramatic music)

00:31:55.090 --> 00:31:57.420
It's really severe, it's really bad.

00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.350
I can't even sleep properly at night.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:04.350
I toss and turn, and that's
when the flashbacks come.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.350
So in order for me to get around that,

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:12.410
I keep hitting the wall
just to ground myself.

00:32:12.410 --> 00:32:15.460
- Gee, Fuzzy, that is an enormous thing

00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.360
for one person to have to deal with.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:20.470
Even now you're still having flashbacks,

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:21.693
still hitting the wall.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.610
- Mate, it got to a point,
the seriousness of it,

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:32.343
it got to the point where I
tried to take my own life.

00:32:34.910 --> 00:32:38.553
I ended up in ICU for a coma for a week

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:42.770
because I couldn't take it any longer.

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:44.303
The pain was unbearable.

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.770
I had been medically retired as well,

00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:53.770
and I thought to myself, what's happening?

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.133
It was like I'd been just discarded.

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:04.190
- Some of the victims of QF72

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:08.970
received six-figure
payouts, but not Fuzzy.

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:12.490
As an employee, Qantas
offered him just $33,000,

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.670
a settlement he rejected on legal advice.

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:22.113
In the end, this proud
man was left with nothing.

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:30.683
Fuzzy, do you feel as though
you were properly supported?

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.363
- Like I said, I have the
greatest respect for Qantas.

00:33:45.566 --> 00:33:46.399
- [Reporter] It's a
tough question, I know.

00:33:46.399 --> 00:33:47.232
- Yes.

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.020
- I can see that even now you're reluctant

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:55.540
to criticise the airline that you loved.

00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:59.490
But the reality is that
for you some support,

00:33:59.490 --> 00:34:03.473
any support would have made
the world of difference.

00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.030
- It would have helped me and my family

00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:10.380
a great deal, to be honest.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.880
- [Reporter] Kevin Sullivan didn't suffer

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.170
any physical injuries, but the events

00:34:22.170 --> 00:34:25.620
of that day continue to haunt him.

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:27.340
Three years ago, he made

00:34:27.340 --> 00:34:30.083
the difficult decision to stop flying.

00:34:31.988 --> 00:34:34.630
- You hold onto those images,

00:34:34.630 --> 00:34:37.010
those memories as if they were yesterday.

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:39.320
And that's just what your brain does

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:44.320
when you're in this sort of
near-death traumatic experience.

00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:50.503
Your brain records in high definition,

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.840
and it stays in there.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.767
It doesn't go away.

00:34:55.767 --> 00:34:56.600
(dramatic music)

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.060
- [Reporter] Qantas Flight 72
was cruising at 37,000 feet

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.757
when the onboard computer
suddenly went haywire.

00:35:03.757 --> 00:35:04.667
(alarm ringing)

00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:06.660
- [Man] Stall, stall.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:09.300
- [Reporter] Sending the
plane hurtling downwards.

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:11.820
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau

00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:14.940
blamed incorrect data for the emergency,

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:19.483
but it hasn't been able to
explain how or why that happened.

00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:24.320
It all sounds eerily similar

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.795
to the recent Boeing MAX crashes.

00:35:26.795 --> 00:35:28.020
(slow music)

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:33.020
In those two cases, flight
computers reacted to faulty data.

00:35:33.290 --> 00:35:35.570
The pilots couldn't regain control

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:40.403
of their planes, and 346 people died.

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:43.100
- It's important also to remember

00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:46.220
that while humans are often
the least predictable part

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.680
of the safety system, they are by far

00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.563
the most resilient and adaptable,

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.530
the ones who can confront a challenge

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:56.250
they've never seen before,
and in a short period of time

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.981
figure out a way to
solve even that crisis.

00:35:58.981 --> 00:36:00.580
(people cheering)

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:02.430
- [Reporter] Captain Chesley Sullenberger,

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:05.060
the hero of the Hudson River landing,

00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.210
believes that replacing pilot skills

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:11.340
with increased automation
is a fatal mistake.

00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:14.930
- What we've learned in
aviation is that automation

00:36:14.930 --> 00:36:17.933
does not decrease errors.

00:36:18.810 --> 00:36:21.750
But it changes the nature
of errors that are made.

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.550
As we use more and more
technology in the cockpits,

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:28.490
we must always make sure that the humans

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:31.935
are in complete control of the
aircraft and its flight path.

00:36:31.935 --> 00:36:32.940
(mid-tempo music)

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.160
- [Reporter] As a former
elite fighter pilot,

00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:36.800
Kevin Sullivan had the skills

00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:39.480
to bring his plane down safely.

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.860
The passengers and crew of QF72

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:46.220
know they were incredibly lucky.

00:36:46.220 --> 00:36:47.750
- This guy saved my life.

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:50.240
And he gave me an opportunity to be here,

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.940
and I am breathing, I'm here,

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:54.290
I'm here in the flesh because of that man.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:56.930
- [Reporter] Fuzzy
Maiava is now campaigning

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:00.090
to get Captain Sullivan
and his flight crew

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:02.840
the recognition they deserve.

00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.324
- I think they deserve the
Qantas Diamond Chairman Award,

00:37:06.324 --> 00:37:08.600
and also the Cross of Valour.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.680
I believe that's Australia's
highest civilian bravery award.

00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:14.340
So if you're out there,
please sign that petition

00:37:14.340 --> 00:37:17.790
so it'll help get Kevin and his men

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.580
acknowledged and recognised
for what they did.

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:23.070
- We owe our lives, period.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:24.910
- Mm, yeah, everyone does.

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.550
- Do you think he should
be recognised for that?

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.857
- [Caroline] Absolutely.

00:37:28.857 --> 00:37:30.018
- Knighted. (laughs)

00:37:30.018 --> 00:37:31.720
- Knighted.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:34.320
He definitely saved 315 people's lives.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.630
- [Bruce] Yeah.

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:36.880
- [Reporter] Hero?

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.713
- Definitely.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:40.770
Definitely, without a doubt.

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.730
- [Reporter] What would you say to him?

00:37:45.730 --> 00:37:46.563
- Thank you.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:51.037
And give him a big hug.

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.603
- [Reporter] Becky can't get
on a plane to deliver that hug.

00:37:57.603 --> 00:37:58.630
(slow music)

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:03.630
But Fuzzy Maiava has bravely
cast aside his fear of flying

00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:08.720
and flown from New Zealand
to thank his hero in person.

00:38:08.750 --> 00:38:11.493
- And I know you still
think about the passengers.

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.360
They're very top of mind for you.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.840
We actually have one of them here now

00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:17.338
to say a bit of a hello.

00:38:17.338 --> 00:38:18.171
- Is that right?

00:38:18.171 --> 00:38:19.818
- He's just over there,
over your left shoulder.

00:38:19.818 --> 00:38:20.651
You might remember this young man.

00:38:20.651 --> 00:38:21.968
- Kevin, hey, come on.

00:38:21.968 --> 00:38:25.860
Oh, mate. (laughs)

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.860
Good to see you, my brother.

00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.453
- Fuzzy.
- Good to see you. (laughs)

00:38:28.453 --> 00:38:30.101
- [Kevin] Yeah.

00:38:30.101 --> 00:38:32.600
- Oh, mate, you look--
- Welcome.

00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.433
- Thank you.

00:38:33.433 --> 00:38:34.266
Oh, my brother.

00:38:35.530 --> 00:38:36.363
Oh, mate.

00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:39.300
Mate.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.290
- [Reporter] He has been
dying to see you, Kev.

00:38:41.290 --> 00:38:42.123
- I have been, yeah.

00:38:42.123 --> 00:38:44.160
- Fuzzy, is this the
first time you've flown?

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.967
- Yes, this is the first.

00:38:45.967 --> 00:38:49.030
Mate, I've been dying to meet up with you.

00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:50.400
You're the reason I'm here.

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:53.120
If it wasn't for you,
Kevin, we would not be here.

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.270
- Well--
- And I'm serious.

00:38:55.270 --> 00:38:56.103
- Thank you, Fuzzy.

00:38:56.103 --> 00:38:57.210
- A lot of people may
have said it's their job,

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:58.107
they get paid for it.

00:38:58.107 --> 00:38:59.810
No, this is very unique.

00:38:59.810 --> 00:39:02.040
And that's why I was so passionate

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.640
in trying to get this in the public realm

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:11.010
to get the Qantas Group and
the Australian government

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:13.000
to acknowledge and recognise you

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.313
because this is something
unique and it's unheard of.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:20.421
And that's why I'm so passionate
and I'll never give up.

00:39:20.421 --> 00:39:21.558
I will never give up for you, brother.

00:39:21.558 --> 00:39:22.391
I will never give up.

00:39:22.391 --> 00:39:23.720
(men laughing)

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:27.920
- [Reporter] And those calls
for recognition are taking off.

00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.240
What Kevin Sullivan achieved that day

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.240
has come to represent a line in the sand

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.950
for pilots who refuse to
relinquish any more control

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:39.830
of their planes to computers.

00:39:39.830 --> 00:39:43.260
- Captain Sullivan, from
one Sully to another,

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.840
I congratulate you on having
built and led your team well

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.790
in facing such an extreme crisis on QF72,

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:54.950
keeping your passengers and crew safe.

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:58.710
And since you're a former
US Navy naval aviator

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:03.333
and fighter pilot, bravo
zulu, I salute you.
