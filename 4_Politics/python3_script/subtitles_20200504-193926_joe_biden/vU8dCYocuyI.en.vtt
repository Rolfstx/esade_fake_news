00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 align:start position:0%
and let's start with the cost when Trump
 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.940 align:start position:0%
and let's start with the cost when Trump
first<00:01:44.360><c> started</c><00:01:44.810><c> talking</c><00:01:45.200><c> about</c><00:01:45.350><c> this</c><00:01:45.620><c> he</c><00:01:45.800><c> said</c>

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 align:start position:0%
first started talking about this he said
 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.220 align:start position:0%
first started talking about this he said
it<00:01:46.040><c> would</c><00:01:46.130><c> cost</c><00:01:46.310><c> a</c><00:01:46.460><c> lot</c><00:01:46.640><c> but</c><00:01:47.180><c> not</c><00:01:47.360><c> a</c><00:01:47.570><c> lot</c><00:01:47.930><c> a</c><00:01:47.960><c> lot</c>

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 align:start position:0%
it would cost a lot but not a lot a lot
 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.830 align:start position:0%
it would cost a lot but not a lot a lot
let's<00:01:49.160><c> say</c><00:01:49.340><c> the</c><00:01:49.460><c> world</c><00:01:49.640><c> costs</c><00:01:50.060><c> 4</c><00:01:50.330><c> billion</c><00:01:50.750><c> you</c>

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
let's say the world costs 4 billion you
