Yeah, and I'd love to hear your view on what's going to happen to Jack Ma but not yet. Okay, okay

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.089
So you're you're talking about this?

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.149
What happened with the hna chairman?

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:07.540
Being let's say they would say he well he died or fell off a two foot wall this summer

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.630
Others including yourself would say that he was assassinated

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.920
fan bingbing was put into into jail for

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.450
supposedly tax treatment will get get to all of that, but let's go back to

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:22.030
the CCP

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:27.909
What is the grand strategy in your opinion? What is the grand strategy of the CCP in relation to?

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.599
In how it governs its relationship with the United States

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.089
What is the CCP after I think this, you know when years ago when years ago?

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.840
It's the September fall is the same years of they just went years

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.570
I want a speech in the Hardison

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:51.820
But they blocked me because of China cameras threatened is a Hansen the other today great great day. It's the

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.840
Over-the-rhine years. These are the words the prattling pens. It's me there

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:03.429
There you go there so you were gonna speak at the Hudson Institute. Yeah, and they stopped it. You stopped by China threatened

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.830
Yes the evidence then

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.040
One years ago. I have a press conference

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.830
in the DC I

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.110
Called all the American to work

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.209
China CCP half of the plan calls three F is

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.599
One is a week America week in America. We camera yes to

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.439
You know to make a kill America

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:37.599
This is very seriously. Okay, three is a making, you know a terminal America who Wendy knows I'm a

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.270
terminal terminal

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:49.619
People got it so stable I give it a warning but rarely bad I think when years ago

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:55.739
So I think this guy's crazy cat liar. Correct? Leave her guy to me the trust right then. This is the year

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.490
You just look before right you look what happened? Yeah, what did you see? You see everything that happened? Yeah, this is haben

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:08.970
There's a white the few months. I bought it actually that their chairman type put a wands in the French

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.439
Yes, all the people all Mouser grew up maybe toggles the true, so

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:20.430
Still UCP have a strategy three F America. Got it. 3d you Tom? Yeah this right

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.100
And for those that haven't seen you before on video

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:30.149
One year ago you predicted that the chairman of hna would be killed within a year. Yes, sir. And

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:38.609
363 days later he fell off a wall in Provence. Yes, right. Maybe it was just coincidental. No, no

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:43.649
I drew a the chairman died. Yes, why years ago I see

00:07:44.169 --> 00:07:50.579
The two guys actually one is the president. Why is the chairman want to be one guy one guy?

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:58.109
It's apparently in the one year because one children won't kill him because they want you know, he's superior any

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:05.789
Qualified the information about cooperation. They loomed AGA the queue people they pray in the outside official

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:10.469
Despises them right? What is the habit then only what me I

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:17.579
See the guy not is the taker Soviet title word is the one cheese and China

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:23.609
CCP camera kill him Walter him and this is this is the concept of the government

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:30.119
The government edifice have caught the Chinese Communist Party in theory. They don't earn much money each year

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.559
Right in theory, but in practice what you're what you allege is

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.380
There was this magical

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.179
Twenty-eight percent shareholder of hna that the New York Times wrote about

00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:45.449
That no one knew who owned hna

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:50.580
It was an insurance company that started at zero in the last eight years and rose to prominence

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.580
Yes, and there was a shareholder that no one knew who they were

00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.029
Miles Kwok you say that that shareholder is Wayne Kishan and his family. Yes and

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:08.970
Originally, I think people thought that that was crazy and that you were bombastic and now as things are happening as you predicted

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:15.599
People are starting to believe more in you. Yeah you and I have had the opportunity to spend many hours together. Yeah, and

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.779
I believe many of the things that you say because everything is connected

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:24.130
Whether it's miles Kwok

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:28.200
talking about the chairman of hna or wanker Shan or fan bingbing or

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:34.799
What's going to happen to Jack Ma which will still talk about a little later. Those things are all related to how the CCP?

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.349
Enriches itself. So what you're alleging is that there's a lot of corruption at the top

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:47.430
That's correct. Yeah, and so what do you think the Chinese leadership is worth today?

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:50.279
How wealthy do you think they are personally? Oh

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.490
This is very easy

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.250
You know China is I read your GDP em were the 10 trillion dollars, right? It's about twelve and a half. Yeah. Yeah

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.450
Yeah, trying to hop the money cause we're now you check the last ten years

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.279
Where does the money go? Yeah

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.570
it goes

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:13.409
Well to the printing press yeah today. I wish the steaming ban you talk about one question

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:20.760
Yes, why China print her too much? Currency China? No you Felician you've officially up. Yes

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.880
Why very easy to keep the order?

00:10:25.029 --> 00:10:27.029
Older, yeah

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:32.969
American Albury that all the country the cost by GTP's and 90% gives the people

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.729
Yes Chinese Arita the country

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.959
10% give the people your check

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.619
American all the social housing here how much?

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:47.489
More the 20 trillion. Yeah, China how much?

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.469
Have a feeling maybe lower housing. You know the housing. Yeah, why?

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:58.439
China absolutely, the very low cost we take the money to the outside

00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.379
so you're saying you're saying it's it's the same thing as a

00:11:02.829 --> 00:11:05.339
Government kleptocracy in Africa. Yeah, definitely

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.090
She in the you know in the outside. Yes country

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:13.709
Yes, but these are world angers. Very wanting the useless ready

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:16.799
You know, there's a happy new, right?

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:21.540
This is the way you know, you look at America a an enterpreneur any you know?

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:26.159
You were cement Chinese kind of the company know they kind of threatened in a bigger picture

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:33.720
there's this concept that a nation-state like China and China has said globally that their

00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.200
Economic system is superior to that of Western capitalism

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:38.130
Yes

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.130
and when you when you peel back

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.090
The onion you see that there is no larger income and wealth dispersion

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:50.549
Then there is in China because the elites are the kleptocrats and the people have very little

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.560
Yeah, and those that actually rise through the ranks of this hybrid system end up going to jail

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.350
or falling off a wall and

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:01.859
Right is that it's a very important distinction to draw

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:08.549
When you look at the economy of the CCP versus the economy of Western capitalism. Yeah, right hundred was incredible

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:13.949
So I'd loved I'd love to ask you a couple of questions about that, you know even Premier Li

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:21.030
Has stated that Chinese economic statistics are unreliable. Mmm. What do you think?

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:23.710
the real economic

00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:30.780
Statistics are as far as GDP growth and I know you and I've had several conversations about the FX reserves

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:38.190
How do you think about the numbers that are reported for GDP growth versus what they really are and the FX reserve number versus what?

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:43.049
It really is. I know that's a specific question, but we'll move move on from this. Yeah. Thank you, sir

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:49.470
It's a good question. You know, we need a look of all China economy. We need a local four point four points

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:52.769
yeah, one is the I am - I

00:12:53.650 --> 00:13:00.809

29 trillion dollars China printer army be because this is EVB currency. Yes

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.390
Secondly, you need a look at all about China. It's about

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.210
personal interest accrues

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.410
Right. Yes

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.509
No 20 night really this no Caruso - March 3

You need of all bank the pay the band the bad bank pay advance. Yes, 45 percent

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.680
45 percent of the loans or more I think yeah

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.009
Fall it's very important. You see

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.409
For easy access changed. Yes currency of currency exchange

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:48.209

Nobody no Chinese. No also American

00:13:52.990 --> 00:13:58.199
Company in the China can move, you know, hugely money go to outside, correct?

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.319
Even you earn is the money Columbus laws away

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.649
So this is a full point I give you answer no

00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.640
Party can't give a China economy co2 stable reliable

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.759
impossible the Nozick jump in

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.400
the cheetah the word

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:19.889
the mega fake economy they have this is a printer the currency this

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.790
You know came true the currency move it'll outside. Yes

00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:27.870
So you've moved you've taken us to the place that brought you and I together. Yes

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.780
You came to this conclusion

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.969
Long ago and you're right. I think you're right, of course because you you agree with me so there

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:43.589
So this this concept of two currency worlds is one that is lost on many people yeah, uh,

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:48.000
The the RMB economy of China is internal

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:52.050
Yeah, and the economy of China in dollars is external

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:57.359
Yeah, and they're desperately in need of dollars because that's how they trade with the rest of the world. Mm-hmm

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:59.610
What what was so compelling when I met you?

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:05.399
The most compelling thing that you showed me was the chart of Chinese M to the moving graphic

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.850
Yes and will provide that moving graphic to the real vision audience?

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.509
Separately in this video but more importantly

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.490
Chinese m2 has grown from one trillion dollars worth of RMB

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:25.409
Yeah, - as you say thirty trillion dollars on an economy of twelve. Yes, they've printed more money

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:30.900
Internally than any one country in the history of the world as a percentage of GDP

00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.600
And as a percentage

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.559
M2 growth versus GDP growth thing has ever come that close

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:44.279
Yeah, so they've created a false economy of RMB and the exchange rate in dollar

00:15:44.279 --> 00:15:49.979
So you you took us to another place. You took us to Hong Kong for a minute. Yeah, right. Why does geez little colony of

00:15:50.589 --> 00:15:51.910
Hong Kong

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:57.779
Still pegged to the dollar if China's economic model is so great. Why is that?

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:02.429
very easy the answer sir, you know ko

00:16:03.850 --> 00:16:05.200
Hong Kong

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:12.929
Dollars, you know, it's the tallest Hong Kong dollar with American dollars today. You just are the reason it's a peg the pay. Yes

00:16:13.570 --> 00:16:20.010
You know bank real rich reef sanitary chief your reserve we serve China

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:26.700
Yes, the PBOC PBOC and Hong Kong Bank chief. Yes. Is it Norman Channing HKMA?

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:28.730
Yes, these are fake

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:30.910
These are true

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:32.800
You ho can handle these

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:39.959
Right Bank of China Hong Kong can be part of scene. Yeah. See see, these are the Mafia group seem, right?

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.369
We're trying to the laundry money the station. Yes, I generate your your allegation

00:16:44.370 --> 00:16:49.739
Is that the Bank of China Hong Kong launders money for all of the for all of the Chinese leaders?

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.240
Yeah, always you look go to New York. You say fine over China the building the bankers nor the duty

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.659
Yeah, all the windows block always really

00:16:59.589 --> 00:17:05.639
Good to see okay. So I talk all of our American friend you say could sleep and over trying to never open the windows

00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:10.979
But it's more the building. Why isn't that more the 2000 employee you were here?

00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:14.670
How come for the 2003 you there? Why?

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:19.290
This is vises them laundry system is a mafia

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.069
Good worker there, then that'll really bank. So the Bank of China

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:26.819
the Bank of China in in New York all the worst

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:33.000
2000 employees and they're doing you're saying they're doing everything from being spies to being mafia to being a

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:41.309
Money launderer. Yes, this is for sure so search this there's a why I give you the answer very easy

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:44.550
Hong Kong the tourists know the

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.929
Because the China all the propaganda, you know

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:55.890
Klee all the Hong Kong people the head you wonder you try so we can hover you you can push

00:17:55.990 --> 00:18:00.690
you know stronger than hundred dollars, but at least dude is to the come true that

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:08.070
Foreign, you know currency go outside. Yes, and now is a big travel big because President Trump

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:11.849
You know give the world, you know treating the would

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:19.349
Say no your ass their training war who the economy down? Hmm. Well, the economy was already slowing

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:26.640
Yeah, where's the floor before we went into trying to input a trying to put together a border adjustable tax or our tariff?

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.729
has just made it a little worse the timing of

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:34.380
The Trump administration this tariffs is not good for China. Yes

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:39.630
I don't know if it was intentional or high right, but it's very bad. But even you go back to Hong Kong

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.900
Norman Chan and the HKMA they've spent

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:48.359
78 percent of their reserves the excess reserves fighting the peg. Yeah

00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:54.450
This pegs been in place for more than 30 years and now Hong Kong imports us monetary policy

00:18:54.450 --> 00:19:00.719
So they're having to raise rates while China's economy slows down. This could be a very big problem for Hong Kong

00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.640
Yeah, I think it is another big problem. I see I want to go back and see this China

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:12.599
It's a you call the you know, because of American with the try another tweening the war. Yes, trying that la become no good

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:18.750
It's a cool to jump. Okay, so you're saying that the trade war is going to cause Chinese economy to drop?

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:24.810
Yeah, did the watch was already dropping before they're into the white hunk on the bank. No, it's a very weak

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.220
They have a to toys

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.660
Make up fake

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.540
Economy same time at me, man. Yes second is to open the close

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.120
We are at I we know word

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:41.489
Dollars. Sorry you mean you basically liberalize the arm. Yeah yet it let it free. Yeah

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.030
So this is a white Hong Kong dollars. It look lassiter mad

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:51.599
Dong dong China. Mainland. CCP is twice hop back hop back

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:58.949
But nobody can read security hunka thought I would cut job one day CCP fan of the solution. No Hong Kong dollars

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:04.620
No Hong Kong you your assertion is that at some point in time China will just take over Hong. This is a coat

Yes physical the walnut right? These are pure Hong Kong dollar

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.930
then I

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:17.399
May be a challenge around American dollars right these have finally made to the reason. Don't talk to me about to see so

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:22.829

I want the new consecration to country giving me all the shares and come true the power basically give us all your wealth

00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:53.919
Yeah, do the why you see that? Jekima the if of all that these are the kings of the power K for the government

00:22:54.009 --> 00:23:00.279
Yeah, they call 500 people it's you know team unnamed. So what miles is referring

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:04.508
You know what you're referring to now is just two days ago. Yeah, it was reported in China

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.870
Yeah that Jack Ma had to sign over. Yeah ownership

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.990
this is the dual life and

00:23:11.659 --> 00:23:16.329
Some of his ownership in VI e Alibaba. Yeah to five unnamed individuals

00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:20.919
yeah, which is a very strange thing to happen for one of the most powerful chairmen and

00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:23.529
CEOs and in China who is now

00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:28.359
Immediately retired and we don't know what we still don't want your prediction yet as to what's gonna happen

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:34.059
So, please please hold that back. Let's let's ask. I have a few more questions. I really want to ask you a

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:38.529
given the fact that the Chinese banking system is now

00:23:39.649 --> 00:23:42.609
call it a four hundred percent of GDP and

00:23:43.159 --> 00:23:47.619
You say that 45 percent of all loans in China might be bad

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:53.319
What we say in the US as a funny saying we have a rolling loan gathers. No loss. Yeah

00:23:54.529 --> 00:24:00.159
So if you have forty five percent of your loans that are bad and your banks are four times your GDP

00:24:01.639 --> 00:24:07.839
You're insolvent, which major Chinese Bank in your mind is at the highest risk of failure

00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:15.100
My students were all the time in the bank all of them although Zoe banks all the joint stock bang

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:19.779
Yeah number ones the bank over time Bank of China number two mission Bank

00:24:20.299 --> 00:24:25.449
Pinching Bank number three is the call Trinity ready for action. You see? Yeah divert Bank is

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:32.049
Family, neither laundry the money. They don't give you anything. You can't really peeling tape

00:24:32.059 --> 00:24:36.218
So all the china patterns seemed a part of the same, but number one pang of the Chinese

00:24:36.219 --> 00:24:42.039
aha, number two mission Bank, you can use your bank all the the leaders of form of the leader families the you know,

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:46.898
I see so you're saying that many of these banks work with the leadership in?

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:52.779
Enriching them. Yeah. Yeah. Also three it's a developer package develop Africa

00:24:53.749 --> 00:24:59.738
Palestine all right the fun of the reason call we haul with the per country. No, these are longer than money. Yep

00:24:59.929 --> 00:25:03.218
so during the failures in the past of

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:10.149
Hainan Development Bank Guangdong international trust and Investment Corporation get ik and the p2p

00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:16.869
Platforms that are failing today right there. We've had 200 p2p platforms fail in the last couple of months

00:25:17.419 --> 00:25:23.829
Do you think the government will make investors whole or do you think the government will allow losses to happen? Enjoy?

00:25:24.469 --> 00:25:32.349
The the every year change to the solution, but the theme of the goat take the money from poor people back

00:25:32.989 --> 00:25:38.199
Ricci or you look at China has a fine. Yeah, purple find out the group many years ago

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.940
This is a hundred appealing

00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:45.669
The money is investment is the kind of wrong like right is the work of is among chan to be for

00:25:45.919 --> 00:25:48.189
political of the puerile, you know

00:25:48.219 --> 00:25:49.070
No

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:56.589
no of the political secretary monkey Andrew gray family owned these final solutions finance a confining a curve a

00:25:56.809 --> 00:26:00.638
Hundred appealing harmony they want then I can p2v

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.139
This again

00:26:02.139 --> 00:26:02.690
just

00:26:02.690 --> 00:26:06.279
come party you highlight war the proposition people the

00:26:06.409 --> 00:26:09.278
Cheetah you the solution negative you payback

00:26:09.309 --> 00:26:14.648
I see so so investors in China are the ones that lose their money man

00:26:14.649 --> 00:26:20.468
The leadership gives a solution where they take what's left? Yes, and the institutions fail. Yes. Yes

00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:25.449
So they're the why you can see the P so P if that happens though if that happens

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:32.409
How do how does the leadership control the population from revolting? How does a revolution not happen, you know?

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:39.099
Let's say a lot of banks fail. Yeah, this a white is you see the last of five years what does having?

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:41.179
Saarbrucken true

00:26:41.179 --> 00:26:44.649
In the world war, you know parents who knows it could real

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.969
China Sakura came to the five years cyber control Sabra control

00:26:48.970 --> 00:26:54.400
Yes, wasn't you fear way to one of the people free they fear revolution if we're illusion?

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.360
Yes, this is reason

00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:01.870
I feel massive war cognitive Izuru these scandals saxy do the money just ease

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.140
It's why we're in an airplane hangar, right? We can't be out in the public

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.780
God knows what would happen to it?

00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:12.879
So these are why you know counter cap is a white china

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:20.800
You know, how came true. There's revolution cyber can go first sagging. You look the gtp there. How much to pay call?

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:24.550
Union side security control how much you

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:26.840
see these

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:33.909
Hundred billion dollars these farmer GDP is a kind of true often for people normal people

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:35.960
p2v

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:41.199
the people leave them rather than any leader family, they all the rest of the who the people

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:46.809
sign the good people to tell yes, these y ccp is the word is the

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:54.489
mafia group and the way that they've been able so what's fascinating about this big financial experiment that the the

00:27:55.010 --> 00:28:00.430
Communist party is engaged in they control the narrative, right? They control the press mmm

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:07.090
They control the people they control the price level. Mm-hm right of various things in china. They control food prices

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.090
they control energy prices and

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:15.430
and in the end they also could that's how they control the economy and control the people from revolting and

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:23.379
What you're saying is if the economic gravity hits China, which it looks like it's hitting now

I've studied China for a long time and I've studied their banking system for a long time and these claims are hard for me

00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:14.399
To imagine that they're true. They're very difficult for me to believe

00:42:15.849 --> 00:42:18.809
One would think that a rules-based global financial?

00:42:19.839 --> 00:42:20.920
especially

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:24.270
Interconnected in the banks that that this would be found very quickly

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:29.280
But what you're saying is since the CCP runs the banks they can do whatever they wanted. Yes

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.869
There's a way I really America sir, Carol, you know, I see you some of their you know

00:42:56.829 --> 00:43:01.799
But use number one is really no China economy truth

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:07.649
I really shop so I translate give all the my hedge fund all the my friends easy

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:14.430
Wow, this is so so good is a person to you think I thought the trial economy and you give me that you know

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:20.190
The information about China Bank Shaka me right no more. People know these these are true. This is real

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:28.440
Immediately can happen you can check Hong Kong dollar China, you know is the economy is the job. Yeah. Thank you, sir

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:32.790
Thank you all all right, we're gonna conclude this interview with one prediction

00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:40.109
Yeah, and we we talked when I when you and I first spent many hours together. We talked about Jack Ma. Yes and

00:43:41.349 --> 00:43:43.559
the signing of his shareholder

00:43:44.079 --> 00:43:47.399
Ownership era shares the assigning happened two days ago

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.190
So unfortunately our this interview didn't happen three days ago

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:57.839
But you told me who made you made two pretty bold predictions about Jack Ma. Why do you think he resigned or retired?

00:43:58.349 --> 00:44:02.039
Sorry retired from Alibaba. And is Alibaba

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:04.740
run by the CPC and

00:44:05.319 --> 00:44:08.699
What do you think is likely to happen to Jack Ma in the next year or so?

00:44:09.089 --> 00:44:14.459
I think Hakeem is only to wait all the time has a feeling not only to way

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:18.899
I always probably why yours only two things happen jail jail and

00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:25.588
By dead, he's either going to jail or he's gonna be killed. I think we might just fall off a wall

00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:31.559
Yes for the kill music kill you. You're only talking jack and ma Alibaba. Yes. You never fought

00:44:32.420 --> 00:44:38.540
Kuma is the type of piracy company called finance group finance group. Yeah, this is yeah

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:41.370
Is it

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:48.020
It's very important to the Chinese financial system. Oh my god. He challenges the banks. This is a really erna money

00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:52.309
You're not good at you know, is it the machine is it a competitive money?

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:57.260
Yes, Ali Baba's a liar cheater. The thousands of thick one is a cheat America

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:03.020
These are all the life item since it's all the truth fantasies of finances really good

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:08.719
They really can earn the money and American commercial value stealing the dollars a trillion dollars

00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:14.989
These are the little bag who you look at the history, Germany

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:23.480
1927 to 1942 Hitler coming same way take all the new Turkish occupied

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.349
Luigi country the another hand gives all the shirts

00:45:27.870 --> 00:45:32.690
Equity give the family same way. So this is the check and map before

00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:35.690
Before it's a hope young family

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:43.309
You know on the money as you all the China and the preneur, it's a hope and other people make it a babies. Yes

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:49.369
No, they need to take back the babies. You can either own the jakkamma. You'll get off when we jail

00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:52.819
And now that we kill you everybody same good result

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:58.670
No dot that is a that is a prediction that our audience is going to also have a very hard time with

00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:05.240
but I think if you take the time to understand you miles Kwok and also your your

00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:10.549
Insinuations your allegations. It's all starting to prove to be true

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:17.539
so I think it I think it I think it takes someone people should be taking the time to understand what you're saying and

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.980
We just saw two days ago that he had to write sign over these shareholdings

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:25.100
And so this is a bold prediction that is

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.879
Going to I think be very controversial

00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:34.520
From a very controversial person. Yeah, but III thank you very much for taking the time for this interview

00:46:35.190 --> 00:46:42.230

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.239
Everybody figured that this was the end of the interview

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:07.460
But before he left miles wanted to return to the chair and make one more very important point

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:11.419
