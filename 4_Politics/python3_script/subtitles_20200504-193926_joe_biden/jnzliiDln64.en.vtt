00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
“There is now nowhere left
for you to hide, Larry.”

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.160
More than 160 women say Larry
Nassar sexually abused them.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.070
It’s one of the worst
sexual abuse scandals

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.050
in the history of sports.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.780
And it went on for 
more than two decades.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.220
How did he get away with it?

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.220
“My real interest, of course,
with dance and gymnastics

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.290
is my role with U.S.A. Gymnastics.”

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.170
Nassar had celebrity-like
status in the elite gymnastics

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.990
and sports medicine world.
U.S.A. Gymnastics gave him

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.070
countless awards.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.130
He was inducted into Michigan
State University’s

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.130
hall of fame and governors appointed
him to state licensing boards.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.000
He even secured a patent
for an ankle brace he invented.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.020
Nassar’s patients felt honored

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.270
to be treated by 
the best of the best.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:40.770
Nassar typically carried out

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.280
his abuse under the guise
of a medical treatment.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.080
He hijacked a rare
pelvic therapy,

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.030
that involves
vaginal penetration,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.900
and used it to treat
all sorts of ailments.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.240
He ignored protocol, such as
using a glove, asking consent

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.440
or having a medical
chaperone present.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.130
“And when I was 14 years old,

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.870
I tore my hamstring in my right leg.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.010
This was when he started
performing the procedure

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.739
that we are all
now familiar with.”

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.969
“The next visit was for my shoulder,

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:10.389
which I then found out
my hips were out of alignment,

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:13.299
which then made my spine
and my pelvic bone

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.639
out of alignment as well.

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:19.170
And this is when Larry decided
that it was medically acceptable

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.030
to violate a 16-year-old girl.”

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.580
When confronted by parents, coaches,
and eventually investigators,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.300
Nassar said patients may have
misunderstood his therapy.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.410
Medical colleagues
deferred to his expertise

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.500
After a 2014 investigation
cleared his name,

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.190
Nassar was just reminded
to follow procedures.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.180
In the training camps
of elite gymnastics,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.310
where coaches are 
notoriously hard on athletes,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.520
Nassar manipulated girls
into believing he

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.550
was a trusted friend, advocate
and even their protector.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.100
“You have to protect your athletes.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.410
You have to let them know
that we care.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.470
You have to, not let them know,
but let them feel it.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.470
Let them understand it.
Let them breathe it.”

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.190
”He put my picture up
on his wall with Olympians.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.060
I thought I mattered
to Larry.”

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.860
“You had me so wrapped
around your finger,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.000
and I still trusted you
so much.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.970
Even when I was a sophomore
in college,

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.410
and you were the only
person I called

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.955
to help me make the
decision to end my

00:02:19.955 --> 00:02:22.405
gymnastics career due
to my injuries.

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.900
Nassar won over family members
by offering a free treatment,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.090
a quick diagnosis, or often
the pretense of transparency.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.410
“At the end of the
appointment in your basement,

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.760
I remember asking, ‘Do
I owe you anything?’

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.530
Now it seems kind of sick.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.480
You got what you wanted.”

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.610
He frequently molested
young girls with parents

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.580
in the room, using a
draped towel or practiced

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.430
positioning to conceal where
his fingers were massaging.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.550
“What kind of a person
has the audacity

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.560
to sexually assault a child
in front of their mother?”

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.050
It’s still unclear
who knew what when,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.730
but for decades
Nassar’s employers

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.650
focused on their
reputations and failed

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.550
to safeguard the young
women in their care.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.240
When U.S.A. Gymnastics got a
complaint about Nassar in 2016,

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.350
the organization paid
the gymnast $1.25 million

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.000
to stop her from
speaking about the abuse.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.430
Complaints about
Nassar’s treatments

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.610
reached officials at
Michigan State University

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.580
as early as 1997,

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.870
The Detroit News has
reported. That’s 20

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.540
years before the prized
doctor was terminated.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.700
MSU has said that no
one at the University

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.270
believed that Nassar
committed sexual abuse prior

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.380
to the newspaper reports
in the summer of 2016.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.170
Nassar’s victims say that if
the university had investigated

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.390
the first complaint,
scores of young girls

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.160
may have escaped
the doctor’s abuse.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.200
“Larry Nassar did not
arise in isolation.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.250
Rather we saw the worst sexual
assault scandal in history

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.120
unfold because a predator was
left in power for decades.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.820
Despite warning signs,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:04.590
despite red flags, despite
direct reports of assault.”
