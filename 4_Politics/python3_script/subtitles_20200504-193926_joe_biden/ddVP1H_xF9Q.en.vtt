00:00:00.552 --> 00:00:02.952
- Have you ever flown to Shannon
and JFK from here before?

00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:04.271
- No, this is my first time.

00:00:04.271 --> 00:00:05.412
I've never seen it so crowded

00:00:05.412 --> 00:00:07.637
because the airport is so small.

00:00:07.637 --> 00:00:09.194
This is a really comfortable way

00:00:09.194 --> 00:00:10.334
to go to Ireland.

00:00:10.334 --> 00:00:12.587
- The aircraft can't take the full weight

00:00:12.587 --> 00:00:14.666
and the full fuel off the runway.

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:17.210
- Greatest secret of British Airways now.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.534
- And we flew at 39,000 feet today.

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:21.774
Mach is actually seven nine, so it's .79,

00:00:21.774 --> 00:00:22.781
at the speed of sound.

00:00:22.781 --> 00:00:23.622
- What a memory.

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:26.539
(upbeat pop music)

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.252
(easy listening music)

00:00:37.497 --> 00:00:41.542
(voice on the PA system)

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.604
- Have you ever flown to Shannon
and JFK from here before?

00:00:43.604 --> 00:00:44.654
- No this is my first time.

00:00:44.654 --> 00:00:46.001
- This is your first time okay.

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.931
So let me explain to you how this works.

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.584
Your flight is due to depart at 9:40,

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:53.877
your flight to Shannon where
you'll arrive there 11:00,

00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:55.850
once you arrive there
at 11:00 you de-board,

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.784
when you de-board please
make sure you take

00:00:57.784 --> 00:01:00.410
all your belongings off there,
don't leave them on there

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.090
because they will do the
screening of the plane.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.460
Once you're in Shannon you'll
go through immigration,

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.523
all your paperwork and
everything will be checked there,

00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:09.942
once that's all checked and
cleared then you'll go back

00:01:09.942 --> 00:01:11.247
onto the same plane,

00:01:11.247 --> 00:01:13.418
it usually takes about 15 minutes maximum,

00:01:13.418 --> 00:01:15.601
you'll go back to the
same plane, same seat,

00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:18.213
and then you'll fly
off to JFK where at JFK

00:01:18.213 --> 00:01:20.457
you'll go through as a domestic passenger.

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:21.617
- Oh sounds lovely.

00:01:21.617 --> 00:01:24.534
(upbeat pop music)

00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:30.153
- Well this is so crazy
at London City Airport,

00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:31.952
I've never seen so crowded
because the airport

00:01:31.952 --> 00:01:33.293
is so small.

00:01:33.293 --> 00:01:36.210
(upbeat pop music)

00:01:40.401 --> 00:01:44.441
Well it was absolutely
madness at the City Airport.

00:01:44.441 --> 00:01:47.103
The security check, half an hour queues,

00:01:47.103 --> 00:01:48.938
the space is just so limited here.

00:01:48.938 --> 00:01:51.607
I think UK has one of
the highest airport tax

00:01:51.607 --> 00:01:54.566
in the world but the
facility isn't very great.

00:01:54.566 --> 00:01:57.345
With no lounge at the London City Airport

00:01:57.345 --> 00:01:59.500
for passenger flying on this flight,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.028
you will get a voucher for
breakfast in a restaurant

00:02:02.028 --> 00:02:03.124
at the terminal.

00:02:03.124 --> 00:02:04.505
Hi is this your first
time flying this flight?

00:02:04.505 --> 00:02:06.253
- This is my first time
flying this flight,

00:02:06.253 --> 00:02:07.086
yeah very exciting.

00:02:07.086 --> 00:02:08.339
- I was told this is all business class,

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:09.527
only eight rows.

00:02:09.527 --> 00:02:11.609
Feels like your private
jet with your own family

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:12.696
going on this flight.

00:02:12.696 --> 00:02:13.529
Are you excited?

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:14.573
- Yes I am excited how bout you?

00:02:14.573 --> 00:02:15.406
- Super excited.

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:16.998
(laughter)

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:21.121
- You can now board
the aircraft thank you.

00:02:21.121 --> 00:02:23.788
(plane engines)

00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:41.651
- I'm here today, I'm
flying possibly the smallest

00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:44.367
commercial plane, transatlantic.

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:48.034
The A318 Baby Bus
transatlantic to New York.

00:02:51.363 --> 00:02:52.589
Hi there.

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:53.510
- Good morning sir, how are you?

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.343
- Nice to see you.

00:02:54.343 --> 00:02:55.176
- Please may I check your boarding card?

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:56.763
- Yes I'm at the back of the bus.

00:02:56.763 --> 00:02:58.360
- You are you're 8A sir aren't you?

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.139
- 8A but still in business class.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:01.718
(laughter)

00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:02.832
- Absolutely sir.

00:03:02.832 --> 00:03:05.301
Sir my name's Chris I'm
your CSM, welcome aboard.

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:07.260
If you need any help today please just ask

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.895
and there we are 8A welcome.

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:09.728
- Pleasure flying with you Chris.

00:03:09.728 --> 00:03:11.329
- Thank you sir we're
sorry to keep you waiting.

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:12.760
Nice right, isn't it?

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.443
- Yes very nice.
- Very nice, yeah.

00:03:14.443 --> 00:03:15.672
All right take care.

00:03:15.672 --> 00:03:16.589
- Good job!

00:03:21.641 --> 00:03:24.284
- Hello good morning hi.

00:03:24.284 --> 00:03:27.117
(classical music)

00:03:28.265 --> 00:03:29.098
- Hello.

00:03:29.098 --> 00:03:29.931
- Hello.

00:03:29.931 --> 00:03:30.980
- I'm all the way at the
very end of the plane,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:31.813
this is my seat.

00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:33.499
- Very warm welcome to you.

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:34.341
- Yeah thank you very much.

00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:36.210
- Welcome aboard sir.
- My pleasure.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.127
(upbeat pop music)

00:03:45.844 --> 00:03:49.744
Oh my God this is so cool, this
is at the end of the plane,

00:03:49.744 --> 00:03:51.620
I'm siting at the very
very end of the plane

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.117
still business class only eight rows.

00:03:54.117 --> 00:03:56.623
Look at this, no one around.

00:03:56.623 --> 00:03:59.270
- Good morning Mr. Chui, welcome
on board, my name is Chris,

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.641
I'll be your senior crew member.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.447
This is today's menu for you.

00:04:02.447 --> 00:04:05.359
- So you've heard about our
London City New York route.

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.185
- I heard about this so much.

00:04:07.185 --> 00:04:09.447
- We've been operating
now for nearly 10 years.

00:04:09.447 --> 00:04:10.991
- Is that so, nearly 10 years?

00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:12.339
- And it's our...

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:13.172
- 10th anniversary.

00:04:13.172 --> 00:04:14.005
- Anniversary.

00:04:14.005 --> 00:04:14.838
- Wow!

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:15.671
- Yeah we're very proud of our...

00:04:15.671 --> 00:04:18.187
- Finally I made it just before 10 years!

00:04:18.187 --> 00:04:20.151
I knew this flight number a long time,

00:04:20.151 --> 00:04:22.449
this used to be the
Concorde's flight number,

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.032
Speedbird 001, 002.

00:04:25.194 --> 00:04:27.105
And now today I just saw
there's only three cabin crew

00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:27.947
on this flight.

00:04:27.947 --> 00:04:29.276
- Yes there's only three cabin crew.

00:04:29.276 --> 00:04:31.963
- And we only have like 17 passengers?

00:04:31.963 --> 00:04:33.128
- This is our first quiet day today.

00:04:33.128 --> 00:04:34.560
- Able to give a really good service.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.631
- Amazing.

00:04:35.631 --> 00:04:37.956
It must be one of your
favourite flights this one.

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:39.487
- Oh yes, yeah absolutely.

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:41.219
- Favourable passenger
people for the crew.

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:43.123
- Immensely proud, yeah it's
really really really lovely.

00:04:43.123 --> 00:04:45.327
- [Pilot] Welcome aboard
this London City section

00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:47.990
going up to Shannon first.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.135
We'll get getting off in Shannon,

00:04:49.135 --> 00:04:50.754
you'll get some new flight crew there,

00:04:50.754 --> 00:04:53.712
but your wonderful cabin
crew team good news for you

00:04:53.712 --> 00:04:56.872
are taking you all the way through to JFK.

00:04:56.872 --> 00:04:59.272
And for this section
to Shannon is one hour

00:04:59.272 --> 00:05:00.689
and five minutes.

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.282
(plane engine)

00:05:20.628 --> 00:05:24.295
(lively contemporary music)

00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:35.120
- We've got some heavy
turbulence just after takeoff,

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.120
it was very bumpy and lots of cloud,

00:05:39.745 --> 00:05:42.837
no feasible ceiling yet still climbing.

00:05:42.837 --> 00:05:46.860
(easy listening music)

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.048
- Would you like to try
our vegetarian sushi today

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:51.622
or would you prefer the fruit starter?

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:52.455
- The fruit starter please.

00:05:52.455 --> 00:05:53.622
- Here we are.

00:05:54.586 --> 00:05:55.836
Your champagne,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
enjoy.

00:05:59.995 --> 00:06:01.245
And your fruit.

00:06:06.058 --> 00:06:09.189
And especially for you I've
been baking all morning,

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:11.280
my finest recipe.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:12.113
- Oh what a surprise!

00:06:12.113 --> 00:06:13.379
- Our lovely biscuits.

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:14.212
- Biscuits!

00:06:14.212 --> 00:06:15.228
- Nice.

00:06:15.228 --> 00:06:18.478
(easy listening music)

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:27.018
This is a really comfortable
way to go to Ireland,

00:06:27.018 --> 00:06:29.833
wish every flight from London
to Ireland was like this.

00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:31.250
I got a flat bed.

00:06:32.276 --> 00:06:35.526
(easy listening music)

00:06:42.088 --> 00:06:44.755
(plane landing)

00:06:50.048 --> 00:06:53.298
(easy listening music)

00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:00.120
- One down, one to go.

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.015
- Hello captain, thanks
for flying me here.

00:07:02.015 --> 00:07:04.077
- Safe pleasure, this is the show bit.

00:07:04.077 --> 00:07:05.141
Hi good morning.

00:07:05.141 --> 00:07:06.975
My name is Andrei Clayer,
I'm one of the Captains

00:07:06.975 --> 00:07:11.850
on the Airbus through on our
London City to New York route.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.326
- Now Captain I want to ask
you how long is the runway

00:07:14.326 --> 00:07:15.587
at London City?

00:07:15.587 --> 00:07:18.632
- London City's a short runway,
and it's a narrow runway.

00:07:18.632 --> 00:07:22.601
1500 metres approximately
long and only 30 metres wide.

00:07:22.601 --> 00:07:25.954
- Is that the reason we cannot
do a nonstop to New York?

00:07:25.954 --> 00:07:28.304
We have to make a tack stop at Shannon?

00:07:28.304 --> 00:07:31.275
- Correct, so the aircraft
can't take the full weight

00:07:31.275 --> 00:07:34.539
and the full fuel off
the runway at London City

00:07:34.539 --> 00:07:37.249
and meet the climb gradient,

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:40.883
so the compromise is to come
to Shannon and then refuel

00:07:40.883 --> 00:07:43.517
and the passengers can
clear US immigration.

00:07:43.517 --> 00:07:45.626
- Brilliant, that's a
really good strategy.

00:07:45.626 --> 00:07:47.447
How long this aeroplane can
fly because we only have

00:07:47.447 --> 00:07:51.551
32 business class seats
so it's fairly light.

00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:55.154
So what's the range
given this configuration?

00:07:55.154 --> 00:07:57.516
- Well when it's fully
fueled up the configuration

00:07:57.516 --> 00:08:01.048
is to New York and beyond
so it's probably an

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:03.101
eight and a half hour,
nine hour endurance.

00:08:03.101 --> 00:08:05.497
- My name's Jeremy, I'm the First Officer,

00:08:05.497 --> 00:08:07.625
we've just finished the
flight from London to Shannon.

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:09.185
We're gonna get off now and hand over to

00:08:09.185 --> 00:08:12.500
another fight crew, the
reason being it's quite close

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:15.082
to our hour limits if
we carry on to New York.

00:08:15.082 --> 00:08:17.310
So to protect the operation
we do a crew change

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:18.924
and we'll come back
tomorrow and we'll take

00:08:18.924 --> 00:08:20.917
the next service to New York.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:24.167
(easy listening music)

00:08:42.469 --> 00:08:43.452
- Well nice to see you again Chris.

00:08:43.452 --> 00:08:44.821
- Nice to see you again welcome back.

00:08:44.821 --> 00:08:45.938
- Super easy transit.

00:08:45.938 --> 00:08:47.556
- Absolutely slick and
this is gonna save you

00:08:47.556 --> 00:08:48.990
hours at the other end.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.348
- I knew this is great.

00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:52.125
- Fantastic sir.
- Really really good.

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:54.409
- I'm really pleased that
you found it very easy.

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:57.144
We wish more people would come
and try it because obviously

00:08:57.144 --> 00:08:59.158
they're so slick, so professional.

00:08:59.158 --> 00:09:01.208
- It's almost like the greatest secret

00:09:01.208 --> 00:09:02.892
of British Airways now.

00:09:02.892 --> 00:09:04.511
- I didn't want to say that but yes sir,

00:09:04.511 --> 00:09:06.083
you're absolutely right.

00:09:06.083 --> 00:09:06.916
- Hello.

00:09:06.916 --> 00:09:07.749
- Hello again.

00:09:07.749 --> 00:09:08.582
- Good to see you again.

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:09.415
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back.

00:09:09.415 --> 00:09:10.570
- 15 minutes only.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.131
- How was that, 15 minutes?

00:09:12.131 --> 00:09:13.634
- Yeah short transit, amazing.

00:09:13.634 --> 00:09:15.025
- Isn't good isn't it?

00:09:15.025 --> 00:09:16.866
- It was a really short transit.

00:09:16.866 --> 00:09:21.266
We were off board around
11:30, now at 12:00 ready to go

00:09:21.266 --> 00:09:23.007
as the captain said.

00:09:23.007 --> 00:09:25.118
It feels really intimate,
you know the crew already,

00:09:25.118 --> 00:09:26.847
you're coming on board
again and you know where

00:09:26.847 --> 00:09:28.864
you're sitting, everything's familiar,

00:09:28.864 --> 00:09:29.890
so it's a great experience.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.072
There's also a very funny
US Immigration Officer,

00:09:32.072 --> 00:09:34.254
he actually knew me
from YouTube and he said

00:09:34.254 --> 00:09:35.356
I knew this guy.

00:09:35.356 --> 00:09:38.066
Of course I'm not able to
film at the US Immigration,

00:09:38.066 --> 00:09:39.711
I'm not able to have him on the camera,

00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:41.926
but you know who you are
and thank you so much

00:09:41.926 --> 00:09:43.640
for watching my videos.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.411
- White Company amenity kit for you.

00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:46.411
- Thank you.

00:09:49.324 --> 00:09:51.645
- [Pilot] Now climbing up
to 39,000 feet for the crew,

00:09:51.645 --> 00:09:55.567
very quick flight time today,
just six hours and 30 minutes.

00:09:55.567 --> 00:09:58.150
(plane engine)

00:10:09.172 --> 00:10:12.422
(easy listening music)

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:18.283
- There's only one class on
this plane, business class.

00:10:18.283 --> 00:10:21.252
It feels private jet,
it really feels private.

00:10:21.252 --> 00:10:23.943
- Sir good afternoon, can I
offer you an Ipad for your

00:10:23.943 --> 00:10:25.563
entertainment onboard today?

00:10:25.563 --> 00:10:26.636
- Sure.

00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:29.886
(easy listening music)

00:10:39.054 --> 00:10:41.263
- Your lunch is served sir.

00:10:41.263 --> 00:10:45.260
Potato and Stilton soup for your starter.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:48.510
(easy listening music)

00:10:51.549 --> 00:10:52.884
2018, yeah?

00:10:52.884 --> 00:10:54.136
Would you like to try it first?

00:10:54.136 --> 00:10:54.969
- No it's okay.

00:10:54.969 --> 00:10:57.552
- Would you like us to pour it?

00:11:00.317 --> 00:11:03.567
(easy listening music)

00:11:11.436 --> 00:11:14.239
- The catering is from Do &amp; Co.

00:11:14.239 --> 00:11:18.194
The presentation is
pretty nice, nice glasses,

00:11:18.194 --> 00:11:21.876
brad trade, looks a bit posh and upscale.

00:11:21.876 --> 00:11:24.519
The taste was okay, it wasn't great,

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:26.691
but it wasn't bad either.

00:11:26.691 --> 00:11:29.941
(easy listening music)

00:11:31.844 --> 00:11:35.269
- This is all by The White Company.

00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:37.486
Very prestigious.

00:11:37.486 --> 00:11:38.483
- From UK from London.

00:11:38.483 --> 00:11:39.372
- Yeah uh huh.

00:11:39.372 --> 00:11:41.872
Inside the first thing we have

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.667
is the ground mattress.

00:11:49.724 --> 00:11:53.557
There's the duvet which
is really really soft.

00:11:54.783 --> 00:11:57.344
Lots of ladies like to
wear, this is a shawl,

00:11:57.344 --> 00:11:59.329
cause it's also very very soft.

00:11:59.329 --> 00:12:00.162
- Oh yeah.

00:12:01.152 --> 00:12:03.377
(easy listening music)

00:12:03.377 --> 00:12:05.397
- Enjoy your rest.

00:12:05.397 --> 00:12:08.647
(easy listening music)

00:12:09.919 --> 00:12:13.319
- Well I must say the bedding
is really really nice.

00:12:13.319 --> 00:12:17.682
Very very plush pillow, very
very nice duvet, soft blanket,

00:12:17.682 --> 00:12:19.340
this goes fully flat as well.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:21.997
It's not angle flat,
it's actually full flat.

00:12:21.997 --> 00:12:24.039
So it's amazing it can go full flat

00:12:24.039 --> 00:12:26.178
on a small plane like this.

00:12:26.178 --> 00:12:29.640
I slept so well, I slept four
and a half hours rock solid.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.690
I think I was just
previously exhausted from

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:34.677
the last three days spotting
around London Heathrow.

00:12:34.677 --> 00:12:36.238
- This is the Ploughman's lunch.

00:12:36.238 --> 00:12:37.405
- Ploughman's.

00:12:38.339 --> 00:12:42.672
- With the traditional
scotch egg, the ham, Stilton,

00:12:44.547 --> 00:12:48.880
pickle, salami, the three
different kinds of breads,

00:12:50.128 --> 00:12:53.451
freshly baked scones with the jam

00:12:53.451 --> 00:12:56.196
and also the sweet treat.

00:12:56.196 --> 00:12:59.446
(easy listening music)

00:13:04.104 --> 00:13:06.040
- Mr. Chui I just wanted
to come and say thank you

00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:06.873
very much for choosing us.

00:13:06.873 --> 00:13:07.799
- Thank you, thank you very much.

00:13:07.799 --> 00:13:09.102
- We hope you've enjoyed
your flight with us.

00:13:09.102 --> 00:13:10.616
- Oh tremendous, really a pleasure.

00:13:10.616 --> 00:13:12.311
- Thank you very much and
hopefully we'll see you

00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:13.231
again soon sir.

00:13:13.231 --> 00:13:15.460
- It's just so private
with only 20 passenger,

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.801
everyone have a empty seat next door.

00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:20.951
I actually used some of my
soon to expire Qatar Airways

00:13:20.951 --> 00:13:23.724
Q Miles to redeem on
British Airways as their

00:13:23.724 --> 00:13:27.579
One World Alliance, so
70,000 miles on Q Miles

00:13:27.579 --> 00:13:32.409
for 446 pound is a very high
surcharge and a very high tax

00:13:32.409 --> 00:13:33.576
out of London.

00:13:35.946 --> 00:13:37.801
- Cabin crew would like
to thank you very much

00:13:37.801 --> 00:13:39.354
for all your hard work today.

00:13:39.354 --> 00:13:42.462
Please take your seats now for landing.

00:13:42.462 --> 00:13:45.712
(easy listening music)

00:14:18.576 --> 00:14:21.911
- As you have already cleared
US Immigration and Customs

00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:26.911
at Shannon, you'll be arriving
as a domestic customer.

00:14:26.987 --> 00:14:28.899
All of us at British Airways and indeed

00:14:28.899 --> 00:14:30.708
the One World Alliance
would like to welcome home

00:14:30.708 --> 00:14:33.405
our customers who live here in New York.

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:36.604
I wish those of you visiting
a very enjoyable stay.

00:14:36.604 --> 00:14:39.452
- It's been a pleasure, absolute pleasure.

00:14:39.452 --> 00:14:41.492
- Yeah thank you very much,
see you around, bye bye.

00:14:41.492 --> 00:14:42.428
- Take care.

00:14:42.428 --> 00:14:44.859
- Hi I'm Captain Nick
Lamont and I've just flown

00:14:44.859 --> 00:14:49.331
you over to New York
from Shannon we got on,

00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:53.066
and some other guys flew you
to Shannon from another city.

00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:54.554
And you asked for some
information on the flight,

00:14:54.554 --> 00:14:57.486
so we flew at 39,000 feet today.

00:14:57.486 --> 00:15:02.069
We flew at Mach .79, so it's
.79 is the speed of sound.

00:15:03.607 --> 00:15:06.024
The distance was 2,875 miles.

00:15:07.423 --> 00:15:10.143
We used about 13 tonnes of fuel.

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:14.226
- I think I've just flown
the smallest commercial

00:15:15.092 --> 00:15:16.799
aeroplane transatlantic.

00:15:16.799 --> 00:15:17.794
Do you agree with that?

00:15:17.794 --> 00:15:18.627
- Yeah, I think so yeah.

00:15:18.627 --> 00:15:19.775
- Think so as well.

00:15:19.775 --> 00:15:23.875
The A380 is the smallest
commercial airlines transatlantic.

00:15:23.875 --> 00:15:26.105
What's great about it is coming in,

00:15:26.105 --> 00:15:27.692
arriving as domestic
passenger I don't have

00:15:27.692 --> 00:15:31.108
to fight for the queue
to clear immigration.

00:15:31.108 --> 00:15:33.365
And also we arrive at Gate 1,

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:34.913
that was the old Concorde gate.

00:15:34.913 --> 00:15:38.539
I took that gate when I
took the Concorde in 2003.

00:15:38.539 --> 00:15:40.356
What a memory!

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:43.606
(easy listening music)
