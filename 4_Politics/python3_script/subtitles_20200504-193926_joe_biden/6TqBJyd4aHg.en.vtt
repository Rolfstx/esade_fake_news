00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:02.460
Every day, 1.7

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.670
million packages are stolen or go
missing off doorsteps across the

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.690
country. This is higher than it's ever
been before and it's costing Amazon

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.070
and other sellers millions.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.530
Expansion of online retail has resulted
in expansion in the crime of

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.840
package theft, which brings you to something
around $9 billion a year in

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.040
stolen packages. Now creative solutions
are popping up everywhere, from

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.820
doorbell cameras to automatic locks,
porch lockers to alternative pickup

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.570
points. Big and small companies and everyday
people are trying to stop the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.170
thieves. This is a custom built bait
package that is recording him on four

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.200
different cameras and it's about to unleash
a pound of the world's finest

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.090
glitter along with
some other surprises.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.320
We wanted to find out who's losing
the most when a package goes missing

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.200
and what are Amazon and other
companies doing to fight back?

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.820
A 2019 survey
conducted by insuranceQuotes.com

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.390
found that nearly one in five
Americans report having a package stolen.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.620
And according to a new study by
C+R research, each stolen item costs an

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.120
average of $109 to replace, a cost
typically passed down to the seller

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.280
who's responsible for the
refund or replacement.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.110
A lion's share of the loss is
being absorbed by the entity doing the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.200
greatest amount of selling, which
in this case is Amazon.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.580
Amazon Prime members say they receive on
average 51 packages at home every

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.230
year, and all respondents spent an average
of $222 a month on online

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.730
orders. However, 42% of customers say
they avoid buying expensive items

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.600
online because of theft, meaning Amazon is
missing out on even more sales

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.800
revenue. In total, the thefts add up
to more than $25 million in lost

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.210
goods and services each day.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.260
There are stories and anecdotes out
there about more organized thieves

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.290
actually following trucks and picking
packages up off of porches.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.920
But the majority of package theft
occurs from someone walking down the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.780
street, seeing an opportunity
and grabbing it.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.350
Wakefield Research conducted a study on
package theft in 2018 that was

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.630
sponsored by Comcast,
which owns CNBC.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.760
In urban areas, you see as much as
35 % of adults saying that they've

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.550
personally had a package stolen.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.550
In a suburban area, that figure is 20
% and in rural areas it's 13 %.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.710
SafeWise also conducted a study.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.100
It found the places with the highest
rates of package theft are the Bay

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.740
Area, Salt Lake City and Portland.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.500
Between like 10 and three is going to
be the busiest time and it's usually

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.440
a time when people are at work
or at school or out running errands.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.060
The nicer neighborhoods get packages stolen
far more than what you would

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.530
think are the rougher sides of town.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.240
And I think because they're
going after the better booty.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.410
So what happens when
a package is stolen?

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.600
According to C+R Research, victims will
alert more than one entity.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.220
83 % contact Amazon or the seller, 60
% contact the delivery service, 48 %

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.920
checked with neighbors and only
13 % called the police.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.100
So who is it that's
financially responsible for the loss?

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.560
Your major sellers, your Amazon,
eBay, are replacing stolen goods.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.080
The shippers themselves largely
aren't incurring this cost.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.270
Now some like FedEx will offer
$100 worth of default liability.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.320
You can purchase more.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:16.340
U.S. Postal Service offers zero liability
but you can, of course, purchase

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.490
more insurance. But on the whole that
$9 billion is being absorbed by the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.270
sellers. Even though it may seem
like Amazon replaces your item

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.810
immediately after a theft, if that item
is sold by a third party, that's

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.550
who pays for the
replacement or refund.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.300
You can also contact the carrier, the
shipper, but they are going to try

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.000
to get recourse again
from the seller.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.390
But your best chance is to go to
where you bought it from and see if

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:42.440
they'll send you out another one.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.290
It's up to the discretion of the
seller whether they want to replace your

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.530
item. At the end of the day, it's
the consumer who pays for this because

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.810
think about it, the rates
have to go up.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.110
You can't afford to keep
having this type of loss.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.210
Although many police departments don't
track package theft specifically,

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.770
the numbers are definitely up.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.300
Denver, for example, saw a 68 %
increase in package theft from 2015 to

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.230
2018. Because small retailers and huge
sellers like Amazon are spending

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.710
more on refunds and replacements every
year, they've got a big incentive

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.140
to stop the crimes. One solution
the e-commerce giant offers is an

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.370
automatic front door lock system called
Amazon Key, available in 50 cities

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.520
for free with compatible
smart lock kits.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.890
It lets users unlock the front
door remotely, allowing a delivery person

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.640
entry into the home. Amazon Key
can also open certain garages and

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.090
compatible cars, allowing packages to be
left in a trunk, for example.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.020
And building managers can use Amazon
Key for Business, giving delivery

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.830
drivers a smart fob with time limited
access to drop off packages inside

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.330
an apartment complex. However, C+R Research shows
that only 4 % of package

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.860
that victims use Amazon Key.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.900
That number may be
low for one reason.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.800
Even though you can literally watch it
in real time, the idea of unlocking

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.590
your door for a stranger while you're not
there so they can go in to your

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.220
home I think strikes
some people as disquieting.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.720
And then there's Amazon lockers.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.560
Packages are left inside these automatic
electronic lockers for pickup at

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.040
convenience stores, grocery stores, apartment
buildings, malls and other

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.930
locations in more than 900 U.S.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.700
cities. Locker+ locations, often on college
campuses, are staffed and can

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.470
hold packages for up to 15 days.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.550
Amazon also offers pickup in-store at
certain retailers such as Rite Aid,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.740
GNC, Health Mart and Stage Stores.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.390
We have 11 % who said that
they're sending their deliveries to an Amazon

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.850
locker or similar type of service.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.610
And then we have 10 % who said
that they use some sort of package lockbox.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.720
These individual lockboxes like these from
Kingsley Park are often secured

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.920
to a porch where carriers enter
an access code to leave packages.

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.570
And then finally, we have 18 %
of respondents said that they wind up

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.850
sending their deliveries to
their work address.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.120
Amazon says the vast majority of
deliveries make it to customers without

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.210
an issue and that its
customer service is available 24/7.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:59.690
Amazon Map Tracking also allows customers
to view the progress of their

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.700
delivery in real time when
a driver is close.

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.360
And for packages delivered by Amazon
it offers a photo on delivery.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.450
Of course not all online
shopping happens on Amazon.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.570
So there's also a variety of
smaller companies offering electronic smart

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.590
lockers. It's really tough to put a
canoe into our lockers or a mattress,

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.650
but other than that, we put tires all
the time, we take some pretty big

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.670
items through the lockers.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.690
Parcel Pending has 4,000 locker locations
at retail and grocery stores,

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.990
companies and apartment complexes in
48 states and Canada.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.190
We've been working with one e-tailer
who ships over 300 million packages

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:34.250
and they have talked about tens of
millions of dollars of loss in

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.290
packages. And so to put in a
solution like an electronic locker system,

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.780
for them it's almost a drop in the
bucket because the loss in packages is

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.520
not an insurable event for them.

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:45.320
So it's coming out of their pocket.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.160
When lockers aren't an option, consumers
often turn to more homegrown

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.540
solutions.

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.080
About a third of consumers will actually
have a package delivered to a

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.140
friend or have a friend or neighbor
or family member pick up the package.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:58.880
Some things are more extreme.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.470
We actually found one in five have taken a
sick day or called in a PTO or

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:07.790
vacation day to their employer so that
they could be home specifically to

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:10.160
receive a package that they
were afraid might be stolen.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.090
The carriers themselves now offer a
solution too: skip porch deliveries

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.280
altogether by picking up your
package at a storefront.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.870
We've got between the UPS Stores and
then we announced a partnership with

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.940
CVS, Michaels, Advance Auto to add a
third one in there, where receivers

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.310
can say, okay, I want my packages
delivered in those stores as opposed to

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.120
their home. UPS says it delivers around
20 million packages every day and

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:38.390
that 63 million customers have signed
up for its My Choice program.

00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:42.590
Customers can schedule deliveries, reroute
packages or set their default

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.340
package delivery location to one of
40,000 secure access points around the

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:53.000
world. In the next year or so,
90 to 95 % of the U.S.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.530
coverage will be within five miles
of a UPS access point.

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:00.380
FedEx, which says it delivers 15 million
packages a day, has a similar

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.850
program called Delivery Manager.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.480
It lets customers enter specific instructions
for where and how couriers

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.810
should make a delivery or lets you reroute
a package for pickup at one of

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:13.370
14,000 retail locations like FedEx
Office stores, Walgreens, Krogers and

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:18.980
Albertsons. By 2026 we expect the
growth to be roughly 100 million

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.420
packages a day.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:24.110
So we're going to have to have plans
in place to make sure that there

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:27.770
aren't packages laying out on people's front
porches for hours or in some

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:29.540
cases days if they're not home.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:33.650
And USPS offers a service called Informed
Delivery, which it says has more

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.270
than 21 million subscribers.

00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:38.750
It offers a snapshot of every
day's expected deliveries and allows

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.810
subscribers to opt for a package to be
held at a post office instead of

00:08:41.810 --> 00:08:42.890
being left at the front door.

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.420
FedEx, UPS, USPS and other
carriers also offer package tracking.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.570
And although you can file a claim
for missing packages if they were

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.180
insured through the carrier, it's
typically not the carrier's

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.770
responsibility once it's arrived.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:58.250
Once a package is delivered, it's
out of our custodial control.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:02.960
And so it's really up to law
enforcement to work directly with consumers

00:09:02.990 --> 00:09:04.880
on any reported theft.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.810
There's a handful of outside
companies like TrackerSense and Logistimatics

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:11.210
that make one time
GPS trackers for packages.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.940
And then there's startups trying
to streamline the entire tracking

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.230
process. LA-based Route recently launched
its app to offer one-stop-shop

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:19.370
tracking for consumers.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.040
So you open up our app and
you see everything that you've ordered from

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.380
every merchant in a
single map interface.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.400
Route says its algorithms can detect
if a package is wrongfully reported

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.970
as stolen, helping reduce loss
for its 1,800 merchant partners.

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.960
And for a fee of 1 % of the
item's value, Route will also cover the cost

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.130
if a package is stolen. Once the
carrier usually drops the package off on

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.970
a porch, their job of delivering that is
done and a lot of times that's

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:47.780
why they're taking pictures now to show,
you know, the proof that the

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:48.830
package was actually delivered.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.260
We're pretty alone on an
island in covering porch pirating.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:57.380
Doorbell cameras are now a common way
that consumers try to protect their

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.020
packages once they're no
longer the carrier's responsibility.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.400
C+R Research found that 25 %
of package theft victims install doorbell

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.400
cameras like the systems
made by Boston-based SimpliSafe.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.880
It's making sure that we have
that reliable, high quality video footage

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.920
where you're going to capture the face of
the person on it so that if

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.670
somebody does steal a package, we
can follow up on that.

00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:23.300
But doorbell cameras don't only
capture those with bad intentions.

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.650
Their American flag that they had outside
their front door had fallen down

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:33.980
and the moment captured on video was
a neighbor walking by, seeing that,

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:37.010
righting the flag and saluting to
the flag before moving on.

00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.570
If a crime is underway, SimpliSafe
now offers realtime monitoring of video

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:44.510
footage when an alarm is triggered and
can dispatch police to the home.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.600
They will know that this is not a
false alarm, it's not a waste of time.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:51.530
This is a really valuable use of their
time to catch a crime in action.

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.230
And there's a lot of controversy.

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.760
Some people feel like, you know, it's
giving a lot of access to Big

00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.630
Brother. But I think we all want
Big Brother helping us when it's helping

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:00.710
us recover from a crime.

00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:05.180
SimpliSafe's video doorbell costs $169 and
it offers a smart lock starting

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:08.900
at $99. Competitor Ring
starts at $99.99.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.900
And Google's Nest Hello video
doorbell starts at $229.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:17.300
The problem with that is you get a picture
of the bad guy and you see the

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.710
bad guy walk away with the package.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:20.420
But what are you going to
do with the bad guy?

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.440
Who's going to go after him and
is anything really going to happen?

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:26.620
And are you going to catch
the guy who took your item?

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.010
Typically not.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.170
Hey, put that down.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.420
Screenshots of package thieves from these
doorbell cameras often end up

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:35.630
posted online in forums like Nextdoor
in hopes the community will

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:37.190
recognize and stop the thieves.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:40.790
More and more, neighbors are taking
matters into their own hands from

00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:44.840
baiting thieves with garbage-filled packages,
boxes rigged to explode with

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:48.440
blank shotgun shells, or the infamous
glitter bomb packages planted by a

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.580
former NASA engineer.

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.350
We would want to encourage people not to
take the law into their own hands

00:11:56.350 --> 00:12:01.030
and to go through the proper process of
alerting police and not try to set

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.580
anything up that could
be potentially dangerous.

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.060
Carriers and law enforcement recommend filing
a police report when a

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.500
package theft occurs. When you see
the same body type and disguise

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.940
happening repeatedly in a neighborhood and
you're keeping that footage and

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.090
you're sharing it with local law
enforcement, there's a much better chance

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.880
that you are going to catch someone.

00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:25.090
Still, even with a police report, the
chances of catching them are slim.

00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:30.890
It's actually really quite difficult to
find people who are doing this,

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.970
really unless you're caught
in the act.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.940
The Denver Police Department, one of
the few that tracks package theft,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:40.110
says it arrested 7 %
of package thieves in 2018.

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:43.240
The U.S. Postal Inspection Service
is your best bet.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:49.210
However, they were able to make arrests of
less than 1 % of the number of

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.730
packages that are being
stolen per year.

00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:55.000
And that's just arrests. It's not
convictions and it's not necessarily

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.680
finding any of the lost loot.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.270
USPS says postal inspectors arrested almost
2,500 suspects for theft of

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.990
mail and packages in 2018.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:07.030
The average value of a stolen package
is far below what would constitute a

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:10.390
felony. In California, for example, the item
needs to be worth more than

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.860
$950. But in South Carolina, a
proposed Defense Against Porch Pirates Act

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:18.520
would make it a felony. And in
Texas, lawmakers recently passed a bill

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.630
that would fine package thieves between
$4,000 and $10,000 with a possible

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:24.940
jail sentence between six
months and 10 years.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.150
And some police departments have
experimented with beating thieves with

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:30.010
packages and staking out doorsteps.

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:34.560
The reality is, as Amazon continues
to bring more shoppers online, there

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.350
are simply more opportunities for
these easy, simple thefts.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.510
I think it's our job to
continue innovating because there will be

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:46.200
continued innovation on the
criminal side as well.

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:50.130
Amazon and other sellers are highly
motivated to stop the huge losses

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:53.400
incurred by package theft, which
means the solutions are constantly

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.150
improving from doorbell cameras, tracking
and secure locations for package

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:01.320
delivery. There will come a time when we
look back at the way we handled

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:06.210
e-commerce deliveries, and I think
it'll probably seem fairly primitive

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:10.020
that you just have these
cardboard boxes sitting on porches.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:15.750
Whether it's things like the
Amazon Key or lockboxes, technological

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:21.300
innovation is so robust right now and
especially if you combine that with

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:25.140
an opportunity for individual entrepreneurs
to make money from solving

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:29.730
this problem, I really think that it
will be figured out to some extent.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:33.900
I actually think it's probably gotten
a little tougher for criminals to

00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.540
steal something because there's more
attention paid to this, consumer

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.330
awareness on it is growing,
which our data reflects.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.090
But you're starting from
a pretty easy position.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.680
This is not a
difficult crime to commit.
