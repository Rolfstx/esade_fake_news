00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:19.320
[Inspiring Music Playing]

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.180
&gt;&gt; MARIE: So we bought this house, which is
a kind of earthship, 10 years ago

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.020
and we renovated it while we were living in
Quebec City

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.080
and we now live full-time in it for 2 years.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.880
And it's an off-grid house.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.000
We live on solar panels,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.330
and rainwater, and with a composting toilet.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:45.330
We also have a big garden outside, about 250
square meters

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.950
and we produce a lot of our food

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.070
and we also have a greenhouse here

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.589
in our living room where we grow food also.

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:56.989
So yeah, in summer maybe our grocery is around
$30/week.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.479
We buy yogurt sometimes, sometimes cheese
as a treat

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:04.290
but otherwise we get the eggs, the veggies,
and the fruit from here.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.290
We do our own bread here.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.400
So we have a kind of self-sufficiency and
the garden gives us a lot food too

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.479
for the winter because we collected plenty
of fruits and we freeze them

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.570
or we preserve them as jams so we get a lot
all year long.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.610
It's a very good feeling to be self-sufficient,
to depend on yourself

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.770
for your food and everything.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.470
So we wanted this, we wanted to live in nature,
too.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.820
Very close to nature and the countryside.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.640
We didn't want to have a mortgage, too.

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.710
The expenses that you don't have when you
live off-grid is very important for us

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.600
because it means that you don't need to work
so much

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.430
or maybe you can take more holidays.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:57.640
We love travelling, too, so it allows us to
make a good mix between being here and travelling.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.930
&gt;&gt; FRANCIS: So we were looking for land and
I found this house on the web.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.420
And we decided just to come check it out and
it was not exactly the region we wanted to

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.420
move

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.549
but when we arrived here and we just fell
in love with the house

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.400
because it's just what we were looking for.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.349
&gt;&gt; MARIE: And it was very cheap, it was $15,000
CAD.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.690
It was not in this shape, I mean we renovated
it a lot.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.140
We've put some money but still it's a very
affordable house

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.840
for all that we have, the space outside and
the inside of the house.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.060
We fell in love with the owner, and he fell in
love with us, somehow.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:50.170
He had built this house 30 years ago, so he
was a pioneer in building, kind of, earthships

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.830
here in Quebec.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.310
He built this house all by himself, it took
him 5 years to build it

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.780
with the rocks from the land here, and the
beams from the forest.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.560
And so he built the house, lived in it, and
then he left for 7 years

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.500
and he was sad that the house was getting
bad.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.300
So he was looking for some people who would
take care of it.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.240
And we came and we were much younger than
he was, and we were

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.670
in the same way, same spirit as he was.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.300
So he was really happy to find young people.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.250
He left us all his books

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.599
about homesteading and all this, and for us
it was such a gift.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:41.760
[Inspiring Music Playing]

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.900
The first 8 years we had the house, we were
living in Quebec

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.030
and so we were commuting.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.590
We were coming here on the weekends

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.910
and working on the house

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.550
but we are not really skilled in construction
so we needed help

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.580
and we had some help.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.150
And also we were working in the garden because
when we came here, there was nothing,

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.500
just apple trees.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.720
So we planted everything,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.170
and for us it was very important to have the
garden from the beginning.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.330
So we worked, we had the flashlight and it
was 10pm at night on Saturday

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.769
and we were doing the garden because we had
only two days,

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.650
and then we, at the same time, we launched
a social economy enterprise

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.960
so we were very busy in town, and then we
had our daughter

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.590
so it was quite a lot job, and back and forth,
doing all this

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.219
but we made it, and two years ago we decided,
ok, now it's time to be full-time.

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:40.349
&gt;&gt; FRANCIS: So now we're able to garden when
we want,

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.840
and we have plenty of space to do what we
want,

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.719
and so yeah, we feel kind of free.

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:52.819
&gt;&gt; MARIE: So the total house is around 100
square meters

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:56.150
with 35 square meters for the greenhouse.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.090
We made it bigger because we wanted to have
a living space in here.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.110
So we are now in the greenhouse, that's where
we have a lot of our meals

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.009
because we have a table here.

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:14.080
We also have our bathroom in the greenhouse,
too, with a toilet and a shower.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.599
And we have an extra bed for the visit, and
as a sofa.

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:21.400
And inside the house, we have...its like a
loft

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.819
so we have our bed, our daughter's bed, we
have the kitchen,

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:28.849
and the dining room.

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.869
And in the back we have a root cellar and
outside we have

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:37.680
a shed and another toilet, a composting toilet.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.370
&gt;&gt; FRANCIS: the water is coming from the rain.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.580
We have different systems

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.860
to collect the rainwater.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.039
We have a big tank outside to collect the
water from the greenhouse,

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:53.529
and this water is transferred to a concrete
cylinder underground.

00:05:53.529 --> 00:05:57.689
So this water is coming from gravity into
the house.

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.749
And we have another tank in the greenhouse,
it's 1,000 litres.

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:07.939
We collect rainwater from the roof, basically,
that goes inside the greenhouse,

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:10.289
and we have another [system] from the shed
behind.

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:12.669
This is mostly for the garden and the chickens.

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:18.409
&gt;&gt; MARIE: So in total, when everything is
full it can be 10,000 litres of water.

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:22.009
So we almost never lack water.

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:26.029
One challenge here is that we still didn't
find

00:06:26.029 --> 00:06:31.249
spring water [well water], so we need to go
get our drinking water from another place,

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:35.210
a cabin that we have access to that is not
far from here.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.009
We could maybe drink the rainwater, it's filtered,
we filter it.

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:45.240
&gt;&gt; FRANCIS: We can use a system to filter
the water and to purify but at the moment

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:47.270
we didn't for some reason

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:53.680
we prefer to use the well at the other cabin,
it's quite simple that way.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.100
[Inspiring Music Playing]

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.059
&gt;&gt; MARIE: We feel really connected to nature
because it's all around

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:08.310
but also because as we use the rainwater,
when it rains, for us it's:

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.310
"Oh Wow!

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.810
It's going to water the garden and fill up
the tanks"

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.020
So even Emma, she is happy when it rains.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:19.270
You know, usually, we say: "Oh no, it's raining"
and people are sad because it's not sunny,

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:23.569
but in our case, we're happy when it rains
because we know we need it.

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:29.240
And it's the same with the sun, we need the
sun to get our power

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.619
so it's a very close connection.

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:36.189
&gt;&gt; FRANCIS: We have two little systems, solar
systems,

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:42.460
and two packs of batteries, two solar panels
and it's very simple

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.389
but it works really well, everything is fine.

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:50.970
The most consumption that we have is using
internet.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.479
Eventually we want to make it bigger.

00:07:52.479 --> 00:07:56.879
We try to use only 12 volt when it's possible.

00:07:56.879 --> 00:08:02.429
All the lights, and the pump, and eventually
I want to make the internet as well 12 volt.

00:08:02.429 --> 00:08:08.659
&gt;&gt; MARIE: For most of the time it's enough,
but a little more would be even better.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.740
&gt;&gt; FRANCIS: So most of the heat is coming
from the sun, because we are passive solar

00:08:15.749 --> 00:08:19.029
but we live in Canada, so we have a wood stove.

00:08:19.029 --> 00:08:24.939
We have an Amish cookstove in the middle of
the house,

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:27.949
and we use it to cook, we use it for the hot
water,

00:08:27.949 --> 00:08:31.069
and we use it to heat the house.

00:08:31.069 --> 00:08:38.050
This house, because it's underground, and
because we have a greenhouse in the house

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:44.660
it's kind of a challenge for humidity because
the house can be cold

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:49.060
and the greenhouse can be really hot so it
creates humidity,

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.930
and that's a challenge to create more ventilation,
natural ventilation.

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:58.330
&gt;&gt; MARIE: It's especially when we are not
here for awhile, when we come back from travel

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:06.350
or in the spring, for example, so the lower
part of the walls can get humid

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:11.390
but we deal with it, and we warm up the oven
and it works really well.

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.950
&gt;&gt; FRANCIS: After two days it's alright.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:17.470
&gt;&gt; MARIE: We have two dry composting toilets.

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.930
So one is inside, it's more for night,

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:24.250
and for our daughter, and in winter when it's
freezing cold outside

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.230
the other one is outside and it's the main
one.

00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:29.750
&gt;&gt; FRANCIS: And we have a pond for grey water.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:34.140
So we have plants that filter the grey water
in the pond.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.631
It's only the water from the shower and the
sink that goes there

00:09:37.631 --> 00:09:41.450
and that's it, it's that simple.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:46.260
&gt;&gt; MARIE: The house itself works very well
in winter, and even without heat

00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:49.450
it will stay above zero degrees.

00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:52.610
And the former owner, he loved winter here.

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:55.310
So someone who wants to live very relaxed

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.990
and read books all winter long, it's a perfect
place for this.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:03.750
And even in February for example, you can
be here with little clothes

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:07.100
and it can be warm on a sunny day

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:12.990
but most of the time because we are travellers
and we like discovering other places,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:18.060
and it's part of our lifestyle, most of the
time we go away for winter.

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.720
And usually we go for two, three, four months
for travel.

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:26.270
So we went to Europe, I come from France originally,
so usually

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.430
we go to Spain or France,

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:33.870
but the last two years, we went to Florida
for a road trip, and last year

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.970
it was Mexico, for four months.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.820
So our off-grid situation, and the fact that
we don't have a mortgage

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.580
that needs to be paid every month,

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:46.510
and we have very little expenses, allows us
to travel.

00:10:46.510 --> 00:10:52.750
We kind of found a balance between our homesteading
will,

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:56.250
we want to have a garden, and we want to grow
our food,

00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:02.410
and also, our wish to travel because it's
the two parts of our life.

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:07.430
Two things that we really love, and we manage
to do it this way.

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:11.560
[Inspiring Music Playing]

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:16.959
Emma is in first grade now, and we decided
to send her to school here in the village

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:22.600
because we love the school, it's a very small
one, with like 50-something kids.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:27.250
For us, it's important that she meets friends,
she is an only child,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:32.880
and so it's good that she spends some time
in a community of people her age.

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.840
And also, this gives us time for work, either
here, or our job,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:42.190
and she comes back from school at three, usually,

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:43.510
so we have plenty of time.

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:47.690
But when we travel, like last year, for four
months,

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:53.000
we did home school, or "travel school" ...RV
school,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.610
and we loved it.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:12:01.220
We did around one hour each day, and she didn't
lose anything.

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:06.440
She can read now already, and she liked it,
and we liked it, too.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:13.300
And we learned so much while travelling so
it's a good way to learn.

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:21.440
&gt;&gt; FRANCIS: We created Les Urbainsculteurs,
urban gardening, in Quebec City in 2009.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:24.180
It's a non-profit organization that we created
together,

00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:29.590
and we were doing rooftop garden, many projects
in the city,

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.950
it worked really well and we changed kind
of the mentality

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.630
of horticulture in Quebec.

00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:39.060
So to plant more food in the city.

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:43.920
So with this mission accomplished, we decided
just to move away

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.650
and to become homesteaders.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:51.510
And now we have a new project, we are Hempbassadors,

00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:55.990
we want to promote industrial hemp, the different
uses of it,

00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:59.850
and all the opportunity that it can create
for the Canadian economy.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:05.990
So yeah, we started the project four months
ago and we're really happy about it.

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:11.310
&gt;&gt; MARIE: Industrial hemp is allowed in Canada
for 20 years now,

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.690
but it's still emerging, re-emerging.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:20.620
When we started to read more about hemp, we
realized how great of a solution it is,

00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:25.240
because it provides food, it provides clothing,
it provides

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.440
construction material, shelter, so many things.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.400
It can make plastic, paper...and it's a very
ecological plant.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:41.490
It doesn't require pesticides, fungicides,
and all this, so it grows very easily.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:47.230
The idea is to go meet people who work with
hemp and interview them,

00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:51.660
and show their work, and promote the plant
in general.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.910
We want to be part of this and we want to...just
as we did with urban agriculture

00:13:55.910 --> 00:14:01.260
when it was not known, our goal with hemp
is to make it go mainstream.

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.100
&gt;&gt; MAT: I hope you enjoyed checking out this
video and learning about Francis and Marie's

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.100
story.

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.510
We find their lifestyle and the projects they're
working on really inspiring.

00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:18.040
If you want to learn more about the work they're
doing to promote hemp as the amazing plant

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.040
that it is,

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:20.810
