00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.166
Mrs. Obama:
Good morning.

00:00:02.166 --> 00:00:03.000
(applause)

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.200
Oh, what an honor.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.333
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:06.333 --> 00:00:09.834
First of all, let me thank
Hannah for that very bold

00:00:09.834 --> 00:00:12.367
and wonderful introduction.

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:15.834
And of course, I want to thank
all of you for being here today.

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:19.633
It is such a pleasure
to be here in Belfast.

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:23.533
And as you might imagine,
whenever we travel to places

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:25.667
like this or anywhere
else in the world,

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:28.400
we've got a pretty
packed schedule.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.700
We're meeting with Presidents
and Prime Ministers

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.266
and First Ladies.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:35.934
We're visiting historical sites
and attending state dinners.

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:39.000
And my husband is spending
hours trying to make progress

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.700
on global issues from trade
to international security.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.767
But wherever we go, no matter
what's on our plate, we always

00:00:48.767 --> 00:00:53.900
do our best to meet with young
people just like all of you.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.834
In fact, you all might just
very well be some of the most

00:00:57.834 --> 00:01:02.367
important people that we
talk to during our visits,

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:04.900
because in just a
couple of decades,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.300
you will be the
ones in charge.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.467
Yes, indeed.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:11.266
You'll be the ones shaping
our shared future with your

00:01:11.266 --> 00:01:14.834
passion and energy and ideas.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:17.533
So when I look around this room,

00:01:17.533 --> 00:01:20.166
I don't just see a
bunch of teenagers.

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:23.233
I see the people who will be
moving our world forward

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:25.300
in the years ahead.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.967
And that's why we
wanted to be here today.

00:01:28.967 --> 00:01:33.100
Let me tell you, when I was
your age, I never dreamed that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.133
I'd be standing here as First
Lady of the United States.

00:01:38.133 --> 00:01:39.066
And I know that my husband

00:01:39.066 --> 00:01:41.900
never thought he'd be
President, either.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.333
Neither of us grew
up with much money.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.100
Neither of my parents
went to university.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.200
Barack's father left
his family when Barack

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.300
was just two years old.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.834
He was raised by a single mom.

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:57.000
And all along the way, there
were plenty of people

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.767
who doubted that kids like us
had what it took to succeed --

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:05.800
people who told us not
to hope for too much

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.834
or set our sights too high.

00:02:08.834 --> 00:02:13.200
But Barack and I refused to
let other people define us.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.233
Instead, we held tight to those
values we were raised with --

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:23.734
things like honesty, hard work,
a commitment to our education.

00:02:23.734 --> 00:02:29.300
We did our best to be open to
others; to give everyone we met

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.767
a fair shake, no matter who they
were or where they came from.

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:39.700
And we soon realized that the
more we lived by those values,

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.033
the more we'd see them from
other people in return.

00:02:44.033 --> 00:02:47.333
We saw that when we reached out
and listened to somebody else's

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:52.433
perspective, that person was
more likely to listen to us.

00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:54.467
If we treated a classmate
with respect,

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:58.233
they'd treat us well in return.

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:02.266
And that's sort of how we
became who we are today.

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:06.600
That's how we learned what
leadership really means.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.033
It's about stepping outside
of your comfort zone

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:12.734
to explore new ideas.

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:16.600
It's about rising
above old divisions.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.700
It's about treating people

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.400
the way you want to
be treated in return.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:27.166
And as young people, you all are
in a very powerful position

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:31.266
to make some of those same
choices yourselves.

00:03:31.266 --> 00:03:35.100
You have the freedom
of an open mind.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.700
You have a fresh perspective
that can help you find solutions

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.233
to age-old problems.

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:43.600
And with today's technology,

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.433
you can connect with
other young people

00:03:45.433 --> 00:03:49.500
from all over Northern Ireland
and all around the world.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.867
So right now, you've
got a choice to make.

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:57.266
You've got to decide how you're
going to use those advantages

00:03:57.266 --> 00:04:02.700
and opportunities to build
the lives you dream of.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.166
Because that decision will
determine not only the kinds of

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:10.500
people you'll become, but also
the kinds of communities you'll

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.734
live in, the kind of world
we'll all share together.

00:04:15.734 --> 00:04:19.133
And standing here with
all of you today,

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:23.100
I have never felt more
optimistic, let me tell you.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.700
Because time and again,
I have seen young people

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.734
like all of you choosing
to work together,

00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:32.834
choosing to lift each other up,

00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:37.066
choosing to leave behind the
conflicts and prejudices

00:04:37.066 --> 00:04:42.333
of the past and create a
bright future for us all.

00:04:42.333 --> 00:04:45.767
That's what's so powerful
about your generation.

00:04:45.767 --> 00:04:49.500
And again, that's why we're here
today -- because we want you

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.834
to know that we believe in
each and every one of you.

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:57.200
That is exactly why we're here.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.433
We believe that you all have
the ability to make a mark

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:05.800
on this world that will last
for generations to come.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.967
We are so proud of you.

00:05:07.967 --> 00:05:10.567
We expect great things.

00:05:10.567 --> 00:05:13.533
So with that, I think it would
be a good opportunity for me

00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:17.700
to introduce someone who
accompanied me here today.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.367
(laughter)

00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:22.700
I let him travel with me
every now and then.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.367
(laughter)

00:05:24.367 --> 00:05:27.600
But he is someone who is
just as excited and delighted

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.834
to deliver a message
of encouragement

00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:31.667
and support to all of you --

00:05:31.667 --> 00:05:34.533
my husband, the President
of the United States,

00:05:34.533 --> 00:05:35.967
Barack Obama.

00:05:35.967 --> 00:05:52.633
(applause)

00:05:52.633 --> 00:06:00.900
The President:
Thank you!

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.300
Thank you so much.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:12.734
(applause)

00:06:12.734 --> 00:06:14.834
Please be seated.

00:06:14.834 --> 00:06:16.333
Well, hello, Belfast!

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.533
(applause)

00:06:18.533 --> 00:06:20.400
Hello, Northern Ireland!

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.033
(applause)

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:23.834
You now know why it's
so difficult to speak

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:26.567
after Michelle --
she's better than me.

00:06:26.567 --> 00:06:28.066
(laughter)

00:06:28.066 --> 00:06:30.500
But on behalf of both
of us, thank you so much

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.600
for this extraordinarily
warm welcome.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.867
And I want to thank Hannah
for introducing my wife.

00:06:37.867 --> 00:06:41.467
We had a chance to speak with
Hannah backstage and she's

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:44.500
an extraordinary young woman,
who I know is going to do

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.867
even greater things
in years to come.

00:06:47.867 --> 00:06:51.767
I want to thank two men, who
I've hosted at the White House

00:06:51.767 --> 00:06:56.166
on many a St. Patrick's Day,
for their warm welcome --

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.400
First Minister Peter Robinson --

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:06.433
(applause)

00:07:06.433 --> 00:07:09.567
-- and Deputy First Minister 
Martin McGuinness.

00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:16.066
(applause)

00:07:16.066 --> 00:07:19.033
I spend the whole year
trying to unite Washington

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:21.600
around things, and they come
to visit on St. Patrick's Day

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.700
and they do it in
a single afternoon.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:25.333
(laughter)

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:30.700
I want to thank the Secretary
of State for Northern Ireland,

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.667
Teresa Villiers.

00:07:32.667 --> 00:07:39.567
(applause)

00:07:39.567 --> 00:07:42.500
To all the Ministers
in the audience;

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:46.533
to Lord Mayor
Máirtín Ó Muilleoir.

00:07:46.533 --> 00:07:53.700
(applause)

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.567
And I want to thank
all the citizens of Belfast

00:07:55.567 --> 00:07:58.600
and Northern Ireland
for your hospitality.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:05.200
(applause)

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.166
As our daughters pointed
out as we were driving in,

00:08:08.166 --> 00:08:10.700
I cause a big
fuss wherever I go.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:11.834
(laughter)

00:08:11.834 --> 00:08:16.667
So traffic and barricades
and police officers,

00:08:16.667 --> 00:08:19.767
and it's all a big production,
a lot of people are involved --

00:08:19.767 --> 00:08:24.100
and I'm very, very grateful
for accommodating us.

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.500
The first time Michelle
and I visited this island

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.967
was about two years ago.

00:08:28.967 --> 00:08:32.000
We were honored to
join tens of thousands

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.500
on College Green in Dublin.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.633
We traveled to the little
village of Moneygall,

00:08:37.633 --> 00:08:39.200
where, as it turned out,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.934
my great-great-great grandfather 
was born.

00:08:42.934 --> 00:08:48.000
And I actually identified this
individual in this place

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.300
only a few years ago.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.433
When I was first running
for office in Chicago,

00:08:52.433 --> 00:08:54.567
I didn't know this,
but I wish I had.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:59.533
(laughter)

00:08:59.533 --> 00:09:01.900
When I was in Chicago,
as I was campaigning,

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:05.533
they'd look at my last name
and they'd say,

00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:09.967
"Oh, there's an O'Bama
from the homeland

00:09:09.967 --> 00:09:14.266
running on the South Side,
so he must be Irish --

00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:15.567
(laughter)

00:09:15.567 --> 00:09:17.800
-- but I've never
heard the Gaelic name, Barack"

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.834
(laughter)

00:09:19.834 --> 00:09:22.300
But it pays to be
Irish in Chicago.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.867
(laughter)

00:09:23.867 --> 00:09:25.300
So while we were in Moneygall,

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.266
I had a chance to meet
my eighth cousin, Henry --

00:09:28.266 --> 00:09:30.200
who's also known
as Henry the Eighth.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.166
(laughter)

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:37.200
We knew he was my cousin
because his ears flapped out

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.433
just like mine.

00:09:38.433 --> 00:09:41.333
(laughter)

00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:43.967
I leafed through the
parish logs where the names

00:09:43.967 --> 00:09:47.200
of my ancestors are recorded.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.734
I even watched Michelle learn

00:09:48.734 --> 00:09:51.734
how to pull a proper
pint of "black."

00:09:51.734 --> 00:09:52.967
Audience Member: Whoop!

00:09:52.967 --> 00:09:54.200
(laughter)

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.934
The President:
Who's cheering for that?

00:09:55.934 --> 00:09:57.533
(laughter)

00:09:57.533 --> 00:09:59.266
So it was a magical visit.

00:09:59.266 --> 00:10:01.567
But the only problem was
it was far too short.

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:03.533
A volcano in Iceland
forced us to leave

00:10:03.533 --> 00:10:05.767
before we could
even spend the night.

00:10:05.767 --> 00:10:10.800
So we've been eager for a chance
to return to the Emerald Isle

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.767
ever since -- and this time,
we brought our daughters, too.

00:10:15.767 --> 00:10:19.900
In particular, we wanted to come
here, to Northern Ireland,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:24.700
a place of remarkable beauty
and extraordinary history;

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:28.600
part of an island with which
tens of millions of Americans

00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:32.233
share an eternal relationship.

00:10:32.233 --> 00:10:36.600
America's story, in part,
began right outside the doors

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.033
of this gleaming hall.

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:43.934
Three hundred and twenty-five
years ago, a ship set sail

00:10:43.934 --> 00:10:49.266
from the River Lagan
for the Chesapeake Bay,

00:10:49.266 --> 00:10:51.266
filled with men
and women who dreamed

00:10:51.266 --> 00:10:56.367
of building a new
life in a new land.

00:10:56.367 --> 00:11:00.567
They, followed by hundreds
of thousands more,

00:11:00.567 --> 00:11:04.600
helped America write
those early chapters.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.567
They helped us win
our independence.

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:11.800
They helped us draft
our Constitution.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.100
Soon after,
America returned to Belfast,

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:20.967
opening one of our very first 
consulates here in 1796,

00:11:20.967 --> 00:11:24.667
when George Washington
was still President.

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:27.200
Today, names familiar
to many of you are etched

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.600
on schools and courthouses
and solemn memorials of war

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.600
across the United States --

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.166
names like Wilson and
Kelly, Campbell and O'Neill.

00:11:39.166 --> 00:11:43.767
So many of the qualities that we
Americans hold dear we imported

00:11:43.767 --> 00:11:51.800
from this land -- perseverance,
faith, an unbending belief

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.066
that we make our own destiny,

00:11:55.066 --> 00:11:57.734
and an unshakable dream
that if we work hard

00:11:57.734 --> 00:11:59.166
and we live responsibly,

00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:04.433
something better lies
just around the bend.

00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:09.800
So our histories are
bound by blood and belief,

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.400
by culture and by commerce.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.567
And our futures are equally,
inextricably linked.

00:12:18.567 --> 00:12:21.533
And that's why I've
come to Belfast today --

00:12:21.533 --> 00:12:27.700
to talk about the future
we can build together.

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:34.433
Your generation, a young
generation, has come of age

00:12:34.433 --> 00:12:39.467
in a world with fewer walls.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:45.600
You've been educated in an
era of instant information.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.133
You've been tempered by
some very difficult times

00:12:50.133 --> 00:12:53.367
around the globe.

00:12:53.367 --> 00:12:57.333
And as I travel, what I've seen
of young people like you --

00:12:57.333 --> 00:13:02.433
around the world, they show me
these currents have conspired to

00:13:02.433 --> 00:13:07.533
make you a generation possessed
by both a clear-eyed realism,

00:13:07.533 --> 00:13:12.133
but also an optimistic idealism;

00:13:12.133 --> 00:13:14.567
a generation keenly aware
of the world as it is,

00:13:14.567 --> 00:13:21.400
but eager to forge
the world as it should be.

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.000
And when it comes
to the future we share,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.266
that fills me with hope.

00:13:24.266 --> 00:13:29.834
Young people fill me with hope.

00:13:29.834 --> 00:13:32.600
Here, in Northern Ireland,

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.867
this generation has known
even more rapid change

00:13:34.867 --> 00:13:39.000
than many young people
have seen around the world.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.367
And while you have unique
challenges of your own,

00:13:41.367 --> 00:13:44.400
you also have unique
reasons to be hopeful.

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.767
For you are the first
generation in this land

00:13:47.767 --> 00:13:52.266
to inherit more than
just the hardened attitudes

00:13:52.266 --> 00:13:58.266
and the bitter
prejudices of the past.

00:13:58.266 --> 00:14:03.867
You're an inheritor of a
just and hard-earned peace.

00:14:03.867 --> 00:14:09.467
You now live in a thoroughly
modern Northern Ireland.

00:14:09.467 --> 00:14:11.567
Of course, the recessions that
spread through nearly every

00:14:11.567 --> 00:14:15.033
country in recent years have
inflicted hardship here, too,

00:14:15.033 --> 00:14:19.033
and there are communities
that still endure real pain.

00:14:19.033 --> 00:14:25.266
But, day to day, life is
changing throughout the North.

00:14:25.266 --> 00:14:28.633
There was a time people couldn't
have imagined Northern Ireland

00:14:28.633 --> 00:14:34.433
hosting a gathering of world
leaders, as you are today.

00:14:34.433 --> 00:14:37.367
And I want to thank Chief
Constable Matt Baggott

00:14:37.367 --> 00:14:40.934
for working to keep
everyone safe this week.

00:14:40.934 --> 00:14:53.333
(applause)

00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:56.066
Northern Ireland is hosting
the World Police and Fire Games

00:14:56.066 --> 00:14:58.533
later this year --

00:14:58.533 --> 00:15:03.567
(applause)

00:15:03.567 --> 00:15:08.033
-- which Dame Mary Peters
is helping to organize.

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:15.400
(applause)

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.200
Golf fans like me had
to wait a long six decades

00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.700
for the Irish Open to return
to the North last year.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:28.100
(applause)

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.033
I am unhappy that I will
not get a few rounds in

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:31.400
while I'm here.

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.300
(laughter)

00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.533
I did meet
Rory McIlroy last year --

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:39.400
(applause)

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.700
-- and Rory offered to
get my swing "sorted," --

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:42.767
(laughter)

00:15:42.767 --> 00:15:44.700
-- which was a polite
way of saying,

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.266
"Mr. President, you need help."

00:15:46.266 --> 00:15:49.233
(laughter)

00:15:49.233 --> 00:15:54.767
None of that would have been
imaginable a generation ago.

00:15:54.767 --> 00:15:57.433
And Belfast is a different city.

00:15:57.433 --> 00:15:59.500
Once-abandoned
factories are rebuilt.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.967
Former industrial
sites are reborn.

00:16:01.967 --> 00:16:05.734
Visitors come from all over
to see an exhibit at the MAC,

00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:11.400
a play at the Lyric, a concert
here at Waterfront Hall.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.300
Families crowd into pubs
in the Cathedral Quarter

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.700
to hear "trad."

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:23.367
Students lounge at cafés, asking
each other, "What's the craic?"

00:16:23.367 --> 00:16:42.000
(laughter and applause)

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.934
So to paraphrase
Seamus Heaney,

00:16:46.934 --> 00:16:51.567
it's the manifestation of
sheer, bloody genius.

00:16:51.567 --> 00:16:55.033
This island is now chic.

00:16:55.033 --> 00:16:59.500
And these daily moments of
life in a bustling city

00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:04.133
and a changing country, it may
seem ordinary to many of you --

00:17:04.133 --> 00:17:06.934
and that's what makes
it so extraordinary.

00:17:06.934 --> 00:17:08.834
That's what your parents
and grandparents dreamt

00:17:08.834 --> 00:17:10.934
for all of you --

00:17:10.934 --> 00:17:13.233
to travel without the
burden of checkpoints,

00:17:13.233 --> 00:17:18.033
or roadblocks, or seeing
soldiers on patrol.

00:17:18.033 --> 00:17:21.834
To enjoy a sunny day free from
the ever-present awareness

00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:26.000
that violence could
blacken it at any moment.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.266
To befriend or fall in love
with whomever you want.

00:17:31.266 --> 00:17:33.600
They hoped for a day when the
world would think something

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:38.734
different when they
heard the word "Belfast."

00:17:38.734 --> 00:17:42.633
Because of their effort,
because of their courage

00:17:42.633 --> 00:17:46.367
that day has come.

00:17:46.367 --> 00:17:49.934
Because of their work, those
dreams they had for you became

00:17:49.934 --> 00:17:54.166
the most incredible thing of
all -- they became a reality.

00:17:54.166 --> 00:17:59.467
It's been 15 years now since
the Good Friday Agreement;

00:17:59.467 --> 00:18:04.233
since clenched fists gave way
to outstretched hands.

00:18:04.233 --> 00:18:07.367
The people of this island voted
in overwhelming numbers

00:18:07.367 --> 00:18:12.133
to see beyond the scars
of violence and mistrust,

00:18:12.133 --> 00:18:17.600
and to choose to wage peace.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.967
Over the years,
other breakthroughs

00:18:18.967 --> 00:18:21.600
and agreements have followed.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.333
That's extraordinary,
because for years,

00:18:24.333 --> 00:18:29.066
few conflicts in the world 
seemed more intractable

00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:33.266
than the one here
in Northern Ireland.

00:18:33.266 --> 00:18:36.233
And when peace
was achieved here,

00:18:36.233 --> 00:18:38.300
it gave the entire world hope.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.433
The world rejoiced
in your achievement --

00:18:40.433 --> 00:18:41.800
especially in America.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:46.200
Pubs from Chicago to Boston
were scenes of revelry,

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.867
folks celebrating the hard work 
of Hume and Trimble and Adams

00:18:49.867 --> 00:18:54.834
and Paisley, and so many others.

00:18:54.834 --> 00:18:58.600
In America, you helped us
transcend our differences --

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.567
because if there's one thing on
which Democrats and Republicans

00:19:01.567 --> 00:19:06.166
in America wholeheartedly agree,
it's that we strongly support

00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:12.133
a peaceful and prosperous
Northern Ireland.

00:19:12.133 --> 00:19:18.066
But as all of you know all too
well, for all the strides

00:19:18.066 --> 00:19:24.033
that you've made, there's
still much work to do.

00:19:24.033 --> 00:19:25.867
There are still people
who haven't reaped

00:19:25.867 --> 00:19:28.667
the rewards of peace.

00:19:28.667 --> 00:19:30.700
There are those
who aren't convinced

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.867
that the effort is worth it.

00:19:33.867 --> 00:19:36.033
There are still wounds that
haven't healed, and communities

00:19:36.033 --> 00:19:40.767
where tensions and
mistrust hangs in the air.

00:19:40.767 --> 00:19:46.533
There are walls
that still stand;

00:19:46.533 --> 00:19:52.834
there are still
many miles to go.

00:19:52.834 --> 00:19:54.500
From the start, no one
was naïve enough to believe

00:19:54.500 --> 00:20:01.367
that peace would be anything
but a long journey.

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:06.500
Yeats once wrote
"Peace comes dropping slow."

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.400
But that doesn't mean our
efforts to forge a real

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.200
and lasting peace should
come dropping slow.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.100
This work is as urgent
now as it has ever been,

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:21.600
because there's more to lose
now than there has ever been.

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:25.033
In today's hyper-connected
world, what happens here

00:20:25.033 --> 00:20:29.533
has an impact on lives far
from these green shores.

00:20:29.533 --> 00:20:34.200
If you continue your courageous
path toward a permanent peace,

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.834
and all the social and economic
benefits that have come with it,

00:20:37.834 --> 00:20:40.000
that won't just be good for you,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.066
it will be good for
this entire island.

00:20:42.066 --> 00:20:43.633
It will be good for
the United Kingdom.

00:20:43.633 --> 00:20:44.767
It will be good for Europe.

00:20:44.767 --> 00:20:48.166
It will be good for the world.

00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:52.700
We need you to get this right.

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.300
And what's more,
you set an example

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:58.533
for those who seek
a peace of their own.

00:20:58.533 --> 00:20:59.867
Because beyond these
shores, right now,

00:20:59.867 --> 00:21:01.700
in scattered corners
of the world,

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:04.400
there are people living
in the grip of conflict --

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:10.934
ethnic conflict, religious
conflict, tribal conflicts --

00:21:10.934 --> 00:21:14.967
and they know something
better is out there.

00:21:14.967 --> 00:21:17.900
And they're groping
to find a way to discover

00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:24.133
how to move beyond
the heavy hand of history,

00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:29.000
to put aside the violence.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.633
They're studying
what you're doing.

00:21:32.633 --> 00:21:36.066
And they're wondering,
perhaps if Northern Ireland

00:21:36.066 --> 00:21:39.800
can achieve peace, we can, too.

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.367
You're their
blueprint to follow.

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:45.033
You're their proof
of what is possible --

00:21:45.033 --> 00:21:47.967
because hope is contagious.

00:21:47.967 --> 00:21:53.266
They're watching to
see what you do next.

00:21:53.266 --> 00:21:58.533
Now, some of that is
up to your leaders.

00:21:58.533 --> 00:22:00.500
As someone who knows
firsthand how politics

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:05.033
can encourage division and
discourage cooperation,

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:07.266
I admire the Northern
Ireland Executive

00:22:07.266 --> 00:22:08.533
and the Northern
Ireland Assembly

00:22:08.533 --> 00:22:10.934
all the more for making
power-sharing work.

00:22:10.934 --> 00:22:12.834
That's not easy to do.

00:22:12.834 --> 00:22:19.667
It requires compromise, and it
requires absorbing some pain

00:22:19.667 --> 00:22:23.533
from your own side.

00:22:23.533 --> 00:22:26.567
I applaud them for taking
responsibility for law

00:22:26.567 --> 00:22:30.300
enforcement and for justice,
and I commend their effort to

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:33.400
"Building a United Community" --

00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:38.500
important next steps along 
your transformational journey.

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:42.633
Because issues like segregated
schools and housing,

00:22:42.633 --> 00:22:46.467
lack of jobs and opportunity --

00:22:46.467 --> 00:22:48.567
symbols of history that are
a source of pride for some

00:22:48.567 --> 00:22:50.433
and pain for others --

00:22:50.433 --> 00:22:56.934
these are not tangential to
peace; they're essential to it.

00:22:56.934 --> 00:23:00.867
If towns remain divided -- if
Catholics have their schools

00:23:00.867 --> 00:23:04.700
and buildings, and Protestants
have theirs -- if we can't see

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:11.467
ourselves in one another, if
fear or resentment are allowed

00:23:11.467 --> 00:23:15.266
to harden, that
encourages division.

00:23:15.266 --> 00:23:18.266
It discourages cooperation.

00:23:18.266 --> 00:23:25.033
Ultimately, peace is
just not about politics.

00:23:25.033 --> 00:23:32.233
It's about attitudes; about a
sense of empathy; about breaking

00:23:32.233 --> 00:23:35.133
down the divisions that we
create for ourselves in our own

00:23:35.133 --> 00:23:41.767
minds and our own hearts that
don't exist in any objective

00:23:41.767 --> 00:23:49.633
reality, but that we carry with
us generation after generation.

00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:53.667
And I know, because America, we,
too, have had to work hard over

00:23:53.667 --> 00:23:57.367
the decades, slowly, gradually,
sometimes painfully,

00:23:57.367 --> 00:24:02.834
in fits and starts, to keep
perfecting our union.

00:24:02.834 --> 00:24:03.900
A hundred and fifty years ago,

00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:08.967
we were torn open
by a terrible conflict.

00:24:08.967 --> 00:24:11.367
Our Civil War was far
shorter than The Troubles,

00:24:11.367 --> 00:24:16.533
but it killed hundreds
of thousands of our people.

00:24:16.533 --> 00:24:22.800
And, of course, the legacy of
slavery endured for generations.

00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:27.000
Even a century after
we achieved our own peace,

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.934
we were not fully united.

00:24:28.934 --> 00:24:32.533
When I was a boy, many cities
still had separate drinking

00:24:32.533 --> 00:24:40.033
fountains and lunch counters and
washrooms for blacks and whites.

00:24:40.033 --> 00:24:45.033
My own parents' marriage
would have been illegal

00:24:45.033 --> 00:24:49.967
in certain states.

00:24:49.967 --> 00:24:52.700
And someone who looked
like me often had a hard time

00:24:52.700 --> 00:25:00.433
casting a ballot,
much less being on a ballot.

00:25:00.433 --> 00:25:06.266
But over time, laws changed,
and hearts and minds changed,

00:25:06.266 --> 00:25:09.066
sometimes driven by
courageous lawmakers,

00:25:09.066 --> 00:25:14.967
but more often driven
by committed citizens.

00:25:14.967 --> 00:25:19.800
Politicians oftentimes
follow rather than lead.

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.133
And so, especially
young people helped to push

00:25:23.133 --> 00:25:29.900
and to prod and to protest,
and to make common cause

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.900
with those who did
not look like them.

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:36.166
And that transformed America --

00:25:36.166 --> 00:25:39.567
so that Malia and
Sasha's generation,

00:25:39.567 --> 00:25:44.500
they have different attitudes
about differences and race

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:49.900
than mine and certainly 
different from the generation

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:51.700
before that.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:26:01.967
And each successive generation
creates a new space

00:26:01.967 --> 00:26:07.734
for peace and tolerance
and justice and fairness.

00:26:07.734 --> 00:26:11.033
And while we have work to do in
many ways, we have surely become

00:26:11.033 --> 00:26:16.000
more tolerant and more just,
more accepting, more willing

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.066
to see our diversity in America
not as something to fear,

00:26:20.066 --> 00:26:21.367
but as something to welcome

00:26:21.367 --> 00:26:28.233
because it's a source
of our national strength.

00:26:28.233 --> 00:26:32.900
So as your leaders step forward
to address your challenges

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:38.367
through talks by all parties,
they'll need you young people

00:26:38.367 --> 00:26:42.100
to keep pushing them,
to create a space for them,

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.400
to change attitudes.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:49.033
Because ultimately, whether your
communities deal with the past

00:26:49.033 --> 00:26:52.800
and face the future united
together isn't something

00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:56.433
you have to wait for
somebody else to do --

00:26:56.433 --> 00:27:01.233
that's a choice you
have to make right now.

00:27:01.233 --> 00:27:07.233
It's within your power
to bring about change.

00:27:07.233 --> 00:27:10.800
Whether you are a good neighbor
to someone from the other side

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.867
of past battles --
that's up to you.

00:27:14.867 --> 00:27:17.667
Whether you treat them
with the dignity and respect

00:27:17.667 --> 00:27:23.467
they deserve --
that's up to you.

00:27:23.467 --> 00:27:25.767
Whether you let your
kids play with kids

00:27:25.767 --> 00:27:29.066
who attend a different church --

00:27:29.066 --> 00:27:33.266
that's your decision.

00:27:33.266 --> 00:27:35.867
Whether you take a stand
against violence and hatred,

00:27:35.867 --> 00:27:37.967
and tell extremists
on both sides

00:27:37.967 --> 00:27:40.333
that no matter how many times 
they attack the peace,

00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:41.867
they will not succeed --

00:27:41.867 --> 00:27:47.767
that is in your hands.

00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:50.600
And whether you reach your
own outstretched hand

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.400
across dividing lines,
across peace walls,

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.734
to build trust in
a spirit of respect --

00:27:56.734 --> 00:28:01.767
that's up to you.

00:28:01.767 --> 00:28:04.900
The terms of peace may be
negotiated by political leaders,

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:16.100
but the fate of peace
is up to each of us.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:18.433
This peace in Northern
Ireland has been tested

00:28:18.433 --> 00:28:20.367
over the past 15 years.

00:28:20.367 --> 00:28:22.066
It's been tested
over the past year.

00:28:22.066 --> 00:28:25.633
It will be tested again.

00:28:25.633 --> 00:28:27.467
But remember something that
President Clinton said

00:28:27.467 --> 00:28:29.767
when he spoke here in Belfast

00:28:29.767 --> 00:28:35.567
just a few weeks
after the horrors of Omagh.

00:28:35.567 --> 00:28:38.500
That bomb, he said, "was not the
last bomb of The Troubles;

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:44.000
it was the opening shot of a
vicious attack on the peace."

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.667
And whenever your
peace is attacked,

00:28:46.667 --> 00:28:50.233
you will have to choose whether 
to respond with the same bravery

00:28:50.233 --> 00:28:52.834
that you've summoned so far,

00:28:52.834 --> 00:29:02.734
or whether you succumb
to the worst instincts.

00:29:02.734 --> 00:29:08.567
those impulses that kept this
great land divided for too long.

00:29:08.567 --> 00:29:12.400
You'll have to choose whether
to keep going forward,

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:16.367
not backwards.

00:29:16.367 --> 00:29:21.734
And you should know that so
long as you are moving forward,

00:29:21.734 --> 00:29:27.100
America will always
stand by you as you do.

00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.400
We will keep working closely
with leaders in Stormont,

00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:35.433
Dublin and Westminster to support 
your political progress.

00:29:35.433 --> 00:29:38.467
We'll keep working to
strengthen our economies,

00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:40.867
including through efforts like 
the broad economic initiative

00:29:40.867 --> 00:29:42.133
announced on Friday

00:29:42.133 --> 00:29:45.367
to unlock new opportunities for
growth and investment

00:29:45.367 --> 00:29:47.400
between our two
countries' businesses --

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:53.066
because jobs and opportunity
are essential to peace.

00:29:53.066 --> 00:29:55.266
Our scientists will keep
collaborating with yours

00:29:55.266 --> 00:29:57.000
in fields like nanotechnology

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.133
and clean energy
and health care that

00:30:00.133 --> 00:30:02.367
make our lives better
and fuel economic growth

00:30:02.367 --> 00:30:04.834
on both sides of the Atlantic --

00:30:04.834 --> 00:30:09.767
because progress is
essential to peace.

00:30:09.767 --> 00:30:11.033
And because knowledge
and understanding

00:30:11.033 --> 00:30:12.000
is essential to peace,

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:12.934
we will keep investing

00:30:12.934 --> 00:30:15.734
in programs that
enrich both of us --

00:30:15.734 --> 00:30:18.133
programs like the one at
Belfast Metropolitan College,

00:30:18.133 --> 00:30:21.333
which teaches students from West
and North Belfast the skills

00:30:21.333 --> 00:30:25.133
they need for new jobs, and
exchange programs that have

00:30:25.133 --> 00:30:27.834
given thousands in Northern
Ireland and the United States

00:30:27.834 --> 00:30:30.100
the chance to travel
to each other's communities

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:33.800
and learn from one another.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.600
Now, one of those young
people is here today.

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.533
Sylvia Gordon is the director

00:30:40.533 --> 00:30:44.033
of an organization called 
Groundwork Northern Ireland,

00:30:44.033 --> 00:30:48.834
which aims to bring about
change from the ground up.

00:30:48.834 --> 00:30:54.133
(applause)

00:30:54.133 --> 00:30:54.800
Where's Sylvia?

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.300
Where's Sylvia?

00:30:58.300 --> 00:30:59.333
Is Sylvia here somewhere?

00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:00.300
Where is she?

00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:05.567
She's here somewhere.

00:31:05.567 --> 00:31:07.767
You're here, too, yes.

00:31:07.767 --> 00:31:09.800
Some guy just waved,
he said, "I'm here."

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.000
(laughter)

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.767
Which is good, I
appreciate you being here.

00:31:12.767 --> 00:31:14.767
(laughter)

00:31:14.767 --> 00:31:17.667
As someone who got my start
as a community organizer,

00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:22.166
I was so impressed with
what Sylvia has done,

00:31:22.166 --> 00:31:23.233
because a few years ago,

00:31:23.233 --> 00:31:26.266
Sylvia visited the United
States to learn more about

00:31:26.266 --> 00:31:29.400
how Americans organize to
improve their communities.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.333
So after she came home,
Sylvia rolled up her sleeves

00:31:32.333 --> 00:31:34.867
here in Belfast and
decided to do something

00:31:34.867 --> 00:31:38.233
about Alexandra Park.

00:31:38.233 --> 00:31:40.467
Some of you may know this park.

00:31:40.467 --> 00:31:42.934
For years, it was thought
to be the only park in Europe

00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:46.400
still divided by a wall.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.533
Think about that.

00:31:48.533 --> 00:31:51.500
In all of Europe,
that one park has got

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.500
a wall in the middle of it.

00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:56.600
Sylvia and her colleagues knew
how hard it would be to do

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.500
anything about a peace wall, but
they reached out to the police,

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.800
they reached out to the
Department of Justice.

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.600
They brought together people
from across the communities.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.834
They knew it was going to be
hard, but they tried anyway.

00:32:08.834 --> 00:32:10.734
And together, they all decided

00:32:10.734 --> 00:32:15.500
to build a gate
to open that wall.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:19.767
And now, people can walk freely
through the park

00:32:19.767 --> 00:32:22.800
and enjoy the sun --
when it comes out --

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.000
(laughter)

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:32.967
-- just like people do every day 
in parks all around the world.

00:32:32.967 --> 00:32:37.300
A small bit of progress.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:43.767
But the fact that so far
we've only got a gate open

00:32:43.767 --> 00:32:49.233
and the wall is still up
means there's more work to do.

00:32:49.233 --> 00:32:52.633
And that's the work
of your generation.

00:32:52.633 --> 00:32:57.734
As long as more
walls still stand,

00:32:57.734 --> 00:33:01.300
we will need more
people like Sylvia.

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.300
We'll need more of you, young
people, who imagine the world

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:13.467
as it should be; who knock down
walls; who knock down barriers;

00:33:13.467 --> 00:33:17.500
who imagine something different
and have the courage

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.133
to make it happen.

00:33:21.133 --> 00:33:26.633
The courage to bring communities
together, to make even the small

00:33:26.633 --> 00:33:31.967
impossibilities a shining
example of what is possible.

00:33:31.967 --> 00:33:34.433
And that, more than anything,
will shape what Northern Ireland

00:33:34.433 --> 00:33:40.600
looks like 15 years
from now and beyond.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:43.233
All of you -- every single
young person here today --

00:33:43.233 --> 00:33:46.800
possess something the
generation before yours did not,

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:52.800
and that is an
example to follow.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.600
When those who took a
chance on peace got started,

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.533
they didn't have a successful
model to emulate.

00:33:58.533 --> 00:34:00.100
They didn't know
how it would work.

00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:02.900
But they took a chance.

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.900
And so far, it has succeeded.

00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:06.166
And the first
steps are the hardest

00:34:06.166 --> 00:34:11.567
and requires the most courage.

00:34:11.567 --> 00:34:17.567
The rest, now, is up to you.

00:34:17.567 --> 00:34:20.567
"Peace is indeed
harder than war,"

00:34:20.567 --> 00:34:25.367
the Irish author Colum McCann 
recently wrote.

00:34:25.367 --> 00:34:31.734
"And its constant fragility
is part of its beauty.

00:34:31.734 --> 00:34:39.734
A bullet need happen only once,
but for peace to work we need

00:34:39.734 --> 00:34:47.800
to be reminded of its existence
again and again and again."

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.667
And that's what
we need from you.

00:34:49.667 --> 00:34:52.066
That's what we need
from every young person

00:34:52.066 --> 00:34:53.266
in Northern Ireland,

00:34:53.266 --> 00:34:54.867
and that's what we need
from every young person

00:34:54.867 --> 00:34:56.000
around the world.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:59.967
You must remind us of the
existence of peace --

00:34:59.967 --> 00:35:03.100
the possibility of peace.

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:09.834
You have to remind us of hope
again and again and again.

00:35:09.834 --> 00:35:15.934
Despite resistance, despite
setbacks, despite hardship,

00:35:15.934 --> 00:35:26.000
despite tragedy, you have
to remind us of the future

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.400
again and again and again.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:35.834
I have confidence you
will choose that path;

00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:40.166
you will embrace that task.

00:35:40.166 --> 00:35:43.166
And to those who choose the
path of peace, I promise you

00:35:43.166 --> 00:35:47.367
the United States of
America will support you

00:35:47.367 --> 00:35:48.767
every step of the way.

00:35:48.767 --> 00:35:52.767
We will always be a
wind at your back.

00:35:52.767 --> 00:35:55.133
And as I said when I visited two
years ago, I am convinced that

00:35:55.133 --> 00:36:00.367
this little island that inspires
the biggest of things --

00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:04.467
this little island, its
best days are yet ahead.

00:36:04.467 --> 00:36:05.166
Good luck.

00:36:05.166 --> 00:36:05.934
God bless you.

00:36:05.934 --> 00:36:07.767
And God bless all the
people of Northern Ireland.

00:36:07.767 --> 00:36:08.467
(applause)

00:36:08.467 --> 00:36:09.667
Thank you.
