00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.001
President Obama: Well I
just had the opportunity

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.003
to have an excellent
conversation with

00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:06.106
President Elect Trump.

00:00:06.106 --> 00:00:10.944
It was wide ranging, we
talked about some of the

00:00:10.944 --> 00:00:13.680
organizational issues in
setting up a white house,

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.750
we talked about foreign
policy, we talked about

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.718
domestic policy.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:23.156
And as I said last night
my number one priority in

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:28.328
the next two months is
to try and felicitate a

00:00:28.328 --> 00:00:31.498
transition that ensures
our President Elect

00:00:31.498 --> 00:00:32.365
is successful.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:41.708
And I have been encouraged
by the, I think interests

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:48.748
in President Elect Trump's
wanting to work with my

00:00:48.748 --> 00:00:53.553
team around many the
issues that this great

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:59.359
country faces and I
believe that's important

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.496
for all of use regardless
of party, regardless of

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:07.534
political presences to now
come together, to work

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:11.438
together to deal with any
challenges that we face.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:17.844
In the meantime Michelle
has had a chance to greet

00:01:17.844 --> 00:01:23.349
the incoming first lady
we had an

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:26.152
excellent conversation
with her a well.

00:01:26.152 --> 00:01:29.456
And we want to make sure
they feel welcome as they

00:01:29.456 --> 00:01:31.791
prepare to make
this transition.

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:36.062
And most of all I want
to emphasize to you,

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:45.538
Mr. President Elect that
we now are going to want

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.707
to do everything we can to
help you succeed because

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.844
if you succeed then
the country succeeds.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:51.945
Please go ahead.

00:01:51.945 --> 00:01:53.346
President Elect Trump:
Well thank you very much

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:54.814
President Obama.

00:01:54.814 --> 00:01:56.716
This was a meeting that
was going to last for

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.818
maybe ten to
fifteen minutes.

00:01:58.818 --> 00:02:01.120
We were just going to get
to know each other, we had

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.322
never met each other.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:07.760
I have great respect, the
meeting lasted for maybe

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.763
an hour and a half and it
could have, as far as I'm

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.966
concerned, could have
gone on for a lot longer.

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:17.570
We really, we discussed
a lot of, different

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.243
situations, some wonderful
and some difficulties.

00:02:23.243 --> 00:02:25.445
I very much look forward
to dealing with the

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:32.752
president in the future,
including council, he's

00:02:32.752 --> 00:02:35.955
explained some of the
difficulties, some of the

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:38.992
high-flying assets some of
the really great things

00:02:38.992 --> 00:02:40.727
that have been achieved.

00:02:40.727 --> 00:02:43.229
So Mr. President it was a
great honor meeting with

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:46.332
you and look forward to
being you many many more

00:02:46.332 --> 00:02:47.233
times in the future.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.034
Thank you sir.
