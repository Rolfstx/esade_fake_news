00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:04.580
Every year, retailers and manufacturers end
up with billions of pounds of

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.250
excess unsold inventory that they're
sending straight to landfills.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.070
And for apparel, they often burn it.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.460
And it's creating more than five billion
pounds of waste a year in the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.700
U.S. and over fifteen million
metric tons of carbon dioxide.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.670
That's equivalent to all of the trash
produced by five million Americans a

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.930
year, or fifty six hundred
fully loaded Boeing 747s.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.830
In Germany, a recent study found that
10 to 20 percent of clothing goes

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.480
unsold, an estimated 230 million
items there each year.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.630
And the amount of inventory waste is
only growing as Amazon leads the way

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.710
in bringing more shoppers online, where the
rate of returns is 25 percent,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.370
compared to just 9
percent for in-store purchases.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.260
Returns are piling up as walls
of shame in warehouses everywhere.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.530
We wanted to find out, why is this
problem so big and what are major

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.100
players like Amazon doing to cut back
on the wasted inventory clogging our

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.070
landfills and our planet?

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.630
We have spoken to over 120 retailers and
over half of them have said that

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.840
they are disposing of over 25
percent of their customer returns.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.640
It's actually cheaper for them
to just throw them away.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.120
To understand why, you have to look
at the complicated journey a return

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.340
item takes, from the moment you bring
it back, potentially all the way to

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.820
a landfill. It goes back through a
distribution center where goods can sit

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.310
for a while, and then they end
up going to liquidators and vendors, and

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.120
then they get passed down to
smaller regional wholesalers, and then they

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.480
go from there to dollar stores,
pawn shops, thrift stores, eBay,

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.120
mom-and-pops at flea markets, and then
they get to consumers in certain

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.400
cases. And when when goods are cheaper
and used and have to go through

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.490
that whole process, often it doesn't make
economical sense, so they end up

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.410
in landfills. And other types of items,
if it's larger, items like a used

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.430
TV, going through that process, it has
a high likelihood of being damaged

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.830
and destroyed and ends up
in a landfill as well.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.810
It's this expensive, complicated reverse
logistics that keep more products

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.400
from being resold or recycled.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.530
Most organizations don't really inspect every
single item and say, is this

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.560
resellable, is it not?

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.780
What level of effort would it take
to get this back into a resellable

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.170
condition? And that's why companies take kind
of the easy route out and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.120
just say, well, let's
just destroy this.

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.770
And that way we can do that in bulk.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.010
And it's not taking up valuable
time and resources from the organization

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.030
that has to do other things.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.850
And some types of products can't
be resold, like open, over-the-counter

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.000
medicines. And some simply have no resale
value, like DVDs sold on the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.520
international market. Any DVD, once it's
returned, the resale value is

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.990
negligible to zero.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.700
And so in those cases, you didn't want
that to flood the market and become

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.230
a a zero price point to
compete with your brand new product.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.870
But at the same time, you didn't
want to pay for it to return.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.530
So in those cases, we had markets
where it was 100 percent in market

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.840
destruction, meaning we didn't take
a single unit back.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.600
Amazon and other retailers won't publicly
disclose how much inventory they

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.920
destroy. Let's acknowledge just for a fact
that there's a lot of product

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.450
waste. Obviously, that's true.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.430
We know that companies are getting rid
of a lot of products because

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.930
they're either out of date or
they don't work, they're unfixable.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.900
And that adds to landfill mass.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.920
So the question would be for organizations
is, well how do we reduce that?

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.470
Amazon's answer is that it launched
a program called Fulfilled by Amazon

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.610
Donations in September.

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.520
Donation is now the default option for
all sellers when they choose how to

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.060
dispose of their unsold or unwanted
products stored in Amazon warehouses

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.260
in the U.S. and the U.K.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.740
The donations program was launched after
CBS reported earlier this year

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.600
that a single Amazon facility sent 293
thousand products to a garbage dump

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.420
in just nine months. After a
French documentary found Amazon tossed three

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.760
million TVs in 2018, the country vowed
to outlaw the destruction of unsold

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.940
consumer products by 2023.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:59.990
And the E.U.

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.460
has an overarching packaging waste
directive that sets guidelines for

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.900
limiting waste for
manufacturers and retailers.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.820
But in the U.S., experts say
retailers are up against a relatively

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.430
unregulated infrastructure around
waste and recycling.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.740
We have a waste infrastructure,
particularly in the U.S.,

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.150
that is not consistent.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.390
There are no national
recycling laws in place.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.740
There are some statewide initiatives, of
course, but they are sporadic.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.990
Apparel has the biggest problem with
excess inventory, in part because of

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.600
the current trend of fast fashion.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.160
Apparel's a two trillion dollar market,
which is the largest consumer

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.080
vertical. So it's much bigger than
movies, bigger than music, bigger than

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.930
books, although 30 percent of
it never gets sold.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.250
And a lot of that
ends up in landfills.

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:51.060
In 2014 compared to 2010, the
average customer bought 60 percent more

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.340
clothing, but kept each
garment half as long.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.350
H&amp;M reported in 2018 that it had 4.3

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.590
billion dollars worth of unsold clothing,
up seven percent from the year

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.050
before. It incinerates some
of those clothes.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.070
Much of this is because unsold inventory
is pulled to make way for the

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.510
latest fashions. We've moved from a two
season fashion year to a 50 season

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.970
fashion year. New clothes
coming out every week.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.150
You don't want that prior season
product available, it's going to really

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.440
cannibalize your next wave of sales.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.300
Burberry famously revealed last year
that it incinerated unsold and

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.220
returned products worth 28.6

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.360
million British pounds, a
practice it's since stopped.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.650
So the reason that very often
these companies will incinerate products

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.790
that are perfectly fine and good is
because they don't want them out there

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.060
in the marketplace. Right, they don't want
the brand to be perceived as

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.790
low cost. So an example is
a lot of luxury sellers.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.440
A lot of luxury sellers will not allow their
items to be in like a TJ Maxx

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.530
or a Marshalls because they feel like,
right or wrong, that it degrades

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.830
the quality of the brand or
the view of the brand.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:59.650
But in some cases, incineration can
actually be more sustainable than

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:00.950
dumping clothes in a landfill.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.280
In H&amp;M's case, they have been
recovering energy from that incineration

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.700
process. So there are power plants,
for example, that use energy from

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.160
burning apparel products to input
into their power plant.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.510
Another useful end point for all
this apparel and other unused inventory

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:20.690
is secondary markets.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.220
This includes foreign countries where unused
goods are often donated or

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.560
sold at steep discounts.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.560
World Vision is a major non-profit
that helps retailers donate their

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.640
excess inventory. It says it received
84 thousand pallets of goods and

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.520
shipped them to 33
countries last year.

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:39.500
Even in secondary markets though, the
waste can pile up, especially after

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:43.950
China implemented its so-called "National
Sword" policy in 2018, limiting

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:46.650
how much waste countries can
export to Chinese landfills.

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:52.050
Southeast Asia in particular, has borne the
brunt of this, where waste is

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.040
being shipped to these countries, and
you then start finding out that

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.760
there are heaps of waste garments piling
up on islands in Southeast Asia,

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.900
because they also didn't have the
infrastructure to deal with this volume.

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:10.130
Other secondary markets for unused goods
to go are discount retailers like

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.860
TJ Maxx and outlet stores, where
returned and unsold merchandise is sent

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.960
in bulk, marked down, and sold again.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.850
And the online equivalent of this.

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:23.010
So you can go to some of these
third party companies and buy things that

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.120
have been returned, kind of
almost like a salvage process.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.930
And the really fascinating thing is some
of that ends up back on the

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.670
Amazon marketplace. Amazon even has
a separate program called Amazon

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:36.470
Warehouse, which sells renewed goods
at a discounted rate.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.740
And some retailers, like Apple, even
include mandates about recycling and

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.030
reusing in its contracts.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.990
Any of Apple's products, which are
high value, and that's often what

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:51.450
drives that in the first place,
have to be returned to Apple.

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:55.110
And they actually reuse as many
of the components as possible.

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:00.040
It also makes sure that their brand
is not undermined by making its way

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.170
onto a secondary black market.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.270
H&amp;M and others, like Patagonia, have
also started programs to help more

00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:07.960
used clothing find a second home.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:13.250
They will take trade in Patagonia items,
give you credit for it, and then

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.630
they'll repost it for sale
on their Worn Wear site.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.420
And then there are other companies,
like Nike, that have really been

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:25.250
innovating on designing their product for
circularity, so that it's easier

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:26.990
to recycle them and reuse them again.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:32.240
The take-back systems in retailers such
as H&amp;M, where you are encouraged

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.390
to take back your clothes, some of
those will be put towards insulation

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:39.490
for carseats, for housing.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:43.520
Returns are a major reason why the
apparel industry struggles so much with

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.400
wasted inventory. So in the apparel
industry, they probably have it the

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.780
hardest, because it can be upwards of
more than 50 percent or even nearly

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:57.970
100 percent of purchases are returned,
because you're buying two or three

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:02.800
of the same item and then keeping the
one that fits or looks best on you.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.370
65, 70 percent of what we return
is because of fit and/or style-related

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:11.170
things. Boston based True Fit is trying
to help with just that, by using

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:13.860
data and machine learning to better
match a customer's fit and

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.830
preferences, so they order
and return fewer items.

00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:22.170
Our role in this was to organize
billions of dollars of transactions from

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.650
the retailers, and you know thousands
and thousands of brands feeding us

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.250
their product data, and
consumers creating this profile.

00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.510
We have 130 million registered True Fit
users now who have shared with us

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.870
like, here's what I care about.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.830
True Fit works with major
retailers like Walmart and Target.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.450
Returns are going to go down and people
are going to keep what they love

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:44.450
because we're going to figure
that out better, right?

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:48.510
And the combination of both of those
two things should make the production

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.620
more efficient and so you have
less going into a landfill.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.340
Nike has a feature on its app that
uses your phone's camera to scan your

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.410
feet with 13 data points to
suggest the right shoe size.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.250
MTailor uses a similar concept, the
custom clothing fit app uses your

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:07.120
phone's camera to measure 17 different body
points that it claims are 20

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:09.230
percent more accurate than
a professional tailor.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:13.150
And there's in-person options like
Formcut, where customers get clothing

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.940
size measurements after stepping into
a 3D body scanner.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:20.190
Amazon is also tackling high apparel
returns with Prime Wardrobe, a

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.630
program launched in 2018 that lets you
try up to eight items before you

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.400
buy them. A similar program is
Rent the Runway, which eliminates returns

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.430
by renting out clothing.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.640
And H&amp;M just unveiled a line
of conscious exclusive dresses and skirts

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.790
available for rent. Google is also
leveraging its massive amount of data

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:41.000
to help its retail partners like
Macy's, Target and Kohl's understand what

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.100
online shoppers want and cut
down on returns and waste.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.170
Google, on an aggregate level, has an
understanding in a country or a

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.770
geography what people
are looking for.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:55.200
So getting that forecast right, how
much product do you need?

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.460
What should you be buying?

00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:58.950
What stores should you
be allocating it to?

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.120
Now, a handful of small companies have
sprung up to help with the waste

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:04.610
and help retailers save money.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:06.470
Optoro is one of them.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:10.400
It collects data on why returns come
back, then optimizes next steps for

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.600
its retail partners like Best
Buy, IKEA, Target and Staples.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:17.910
Real time, it captures the value of
that product in those markets, and

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:23.650
then it captures the data on how much
it would cost to get the good to

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:24.880
each specific channel.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:29.910
And making sure that each item is connected
to its next best home and not

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:33.360
a landfill. Some smaller companies have even
made a business out of taking

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.560
wasted inventory off bigger company's hands
and disposing of it for them.

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:40.650
One such company, Stericycle, estimates
it's destroyed or recycled 80

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.870
million pounds of unsold items
for manufacturers and retailers.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.520
And some big names, like
Nordstrom, are experimenting with end-to-end

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:51.250
automatic sorting and inventory distribution,
which it hopes will mean

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:54.740
more efficient reselling of returned
items, cutting down on wasted

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:59.680
inventory. Historically, you may find
that solutions are very much

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.350
segmented for fulfillment, as distinct
from sortation as distinct from

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:08.720
returns. And here at Nordstrom, we're
taking a holistic approach for

00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.000
end-to-end solutions and we're really excited
to be the first retailer to

00:12:14.070 --> 00:12:16.880
adopt this combined technology.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.750
Amazon is also using robots to
increase the efficiency of its distribution

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.470
centers and eventually reduce waste.

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:26.920
It also has a massive amount
of data on customer behavior.

00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:30.960
Amazon says its systems are constantly
evaluating what its customers will

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:34.560
want to buy, placing orders with vendors
to ensure it stocks the proper

00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.200
amount of inventory. Their technology
can make predictions that says,

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:42.530
"Hey, this product, there's going to
be others that want it.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:46.180
There is demand for it. So if we get
it back, and we get it back in the

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:48.710
region where it was shipped, we actually
think were going to be able to

00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:50.740
ship it to a buyer
in that same spot.".

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.410
From automation to algorithms, the good
news is big tools are being

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.510
developed to help retailers and
suppliers find more efficiency.

00:12:58.050 --> 00:13:01.220
And hopefully, one day, send fewer
of their excess goods to landfills.

00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.580
The trends are going
in the right direction.

00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.880
There's great brands that are helping
to lead the way, and there's

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.300
regulations in certain cases, which we've
seen more so in Europe, that

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.180
have also helped guide people
in the right direction.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:20.170
If we can provide, as consumers,
a demand for those more sustainable

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:25.620
products, it becomes easier for them to
do those jobs in improving those

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.000
systems.
