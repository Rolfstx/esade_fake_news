-Usually -- guys, usually
I come to work

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:02.635 size:75% position:38% line:92%
at 9 in the morning.

00:00:02.635 --> 00:00:05.005 align:start size:94% position:6%
I came into work just about
an hour ago today,

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:09.309
because my wife gave birth to
a baby boy yesterday afternoon.

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:12.912 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Cheers and applause ]
And...

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:16.583 align:start size:94% position:6%
I thank you.
Thank you so much.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.485 align:start size:94% position:6%

00:00:18.485 --> 00:00:20.220 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Here's the thing.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.922
Two years ago I sat at this desk
and I told a story

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:25.859 align:start size:94% position:6%
about how my first son, Ash,
was born

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.194 align:start size:94% position:6%
and how it was very dramatic
in that my wife --

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.263 align:start size:94% position:6%
her contractions started
coming very quickly,

00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:34.100
very suddenly, and we were
really worried that she was

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.271
going to give birth in the Uber,
and we just made it --

00:00:38.271 --> 00:00:39.572 line:92%
just made it to the hospital

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.775 align:start size:94% position:6%
with basically 20 minutes
to spare.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.844 line:92%
Well, move over, that story.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:45.412 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:49.916
'Cause that's so normal compared
to what happened yesterday.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:53.920
Wake up, totally normal Sunday,
go to brunch.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.323 align:start size:94% position:6%
We'll go to the park. My wife
starts feeling something.

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:58.792 align:start size:94% position:6%
We'd been talking
to the doctor.

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:01.728
We have a friend -- our friend
Neelu, is a -- she's a doula.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.630 align:start size:94% position:6%
She's like a midwife.
Talking to her.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.599
Everything sounds fine, but
we're thinking today is the day

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:07.767 align:start size:94% position:6%
we're going to work our way
to the hospital.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:12.505 align:start size:94% position:6%
But again, nothing. 20 minutes
apart, everything's fine.

00:01:12.505 --> 00:01:14.240 line:92%
I'm feeding our son Ash lunch.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.876
My wife is upstairs with
my mother-in-law, Joanne.

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:20.680
And about 20 minutes into lunch,
Joanne comes downstairs

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.915 line:92%
and just looks at me and says,

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:24.317 align:start size:94% position:6%
"We have to go
to the hospital now!"

00:01:24.317 --> 00:01:25.919 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
...which was not the calm

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:28.955 align:start size:94% position:6%
I was looking for.
[ Laughter ]

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.123 align:start size:94% position:6%
It was like Bill Paxton
in "Aliens."

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:33.760 align:start size:94% position:6%
It was like, "Game over, man!"
I'm like, whoa.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.394 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:37.931
Because Joanne hadn't been there
the last time. I'd been there.

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:40.834
And so I kind of knew how
dramatic it was last time,

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.437
but I figured we had plenty of
time to get to the hospital.

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:47.974
So my sister-in-law, Ariel,
she comes over to watch Ash,

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:51.044
who's in his crib taking a nap.
Neelu joins us,

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:52.912 align:start size:94% position:6%
and the four of us
get in the elevator.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.681
My wife is in an intense amount
of pain.

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:57.450 align:start size:94% position:6%
It seems like now it's just
one long contraction.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.785 align:start size:94% position:6%
We get into the lobby
of our building.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:01.988 size:81% position:41%
I have called an Uber.
The Uber is outside.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:03.923 align:start size:94% position:6%
And we basically get
to the steps of our building.

00:02:03.923 --> 00:02:05.959 align:start size:94% position:6%
We're in the lobby and we're
walking down the steps,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.527 size:88% position:44%
and my wife just says,
"I can't get in the car.

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.963
I'm going to have the baby
right now. The baby is coming."

00:02:09.963 --> 00:02:12.999 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I -- I'm just trying
to calm her down.

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.000 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm like,
look, this is it again.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.971
I know 'cause I've been through
exactly one birth.

00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:19.405 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.174 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm like,
"This happens all the time.

00:02:21.174 --> 00:02:24.244
You're feeling -- It's not --
Trust me, I know what I'm tal--"

00:02:24.244 --> 00:02:26.412 align:start size:94% position:6%
And but even our doula, Neelu,
was saying,

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:28.882
"Like, look, it's -- this is --
you're going to be fine."

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:29.883 align:start size:94% position:6%
And she's like --
My wife is saying,

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:33.620
"The baby is coming.
The baby is -- The baby is out,"

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.290 align:start size:94% position:6%
at which point Neelu looked,
and then looked at me

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.392 line:92%
and said, "The baby is out."

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:41.794 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.531
And I looked at my wife,
and the only way I can describe

00:02:44.531 --> 00:02:46.599 align:start size:94% position:6%
how my wife looked was she
looked like someone

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.103
who was hiding a baby in a pair
of sweatpants. [ Laughs ]

00:02:50.103 --> 00:02:53.673 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
It was...

00:02:53.673 --> 00:02:55.341 line:92%
It was like somebody was trying

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.311 align:start size:94% position:6%
to, like,
sneak a baby on a plane.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.412 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:02.415 align:start size:94% position:6%
And so then we're trying --
so we -- like, we bail.

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:05.051 align:start size:94% position:6%
We're not going to leave.
So we walk back in

00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:06.586 size:84% position:42%
and we had to decide
do we go into the lobby

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:10.056
or back on the elevator?
Those are terrible options

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:13.593 align:start size:94% position:6%
when what you're looking for
is a hospital,

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:16.829
because neither of them are
very close to a hospital.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.500 align:start size:94% position:6%
So my wife basically decided
for us, and she went

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.634 line:92%
and she lied down in our lobby.

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:25.738
And we just sort of, like,
created, like, a semicircle

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:27.440 align:start size:94% position:6%
around her and, you know,
we undressed her,

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.977
and the baby was just out.
The head of the baby was out.

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:33.846 align:start size:94% position:6%
I called 9-1-1.
This is how fast it happened.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:37.250
I called 9-1-1 and over the
course of a minute conversation,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.918 align:start size:94% position:6%
I basically said, "We're about
to have a baby.

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:41.588 align:start size:94% position:6%
We're having a baby.
We had a baby."

00:03:41.588 --> 00:03:43.856 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.492 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Applause ]
It was...

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:48.861 size:84% position:42% line:92%
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:03:48.861 --> 00:03:51.965 align:start size:94% position:6%
I went -- I went from someone,
like, calling in

00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.967 align:start size:94% position:6%
about an emergency
to just sharing good news

00:03:53.967 --> 00:03:56.336 align:start size:94% position:6%
with a stranger.
[ Laughter ]

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.871
It was like, "Yeah, it's a boy.
Yeah, it's great.

00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:01.174 align:start size:94% position:6%
You've probably got stuff
to do."

00:04:01.174 --> 00:04:06.179
Anyway, so my wife basically
takes our baby and puts him

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:09.949 align:start size:94% position:6%
on her chest
and is incredibly calm

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:12.719
for what she just went through.
I, uh...

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:16.522
And then fire department,
NYPD, the amount of people

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:18.558 align:start size:94% position:6%
that were in our lobby
was insane.

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:20.560
Uh, what? You don't believe
the entire fire department

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.795 align:start size:94% position:6%
came into our lobby
to help us deliver our baby?

00:04:22.795 --> 00:04:26.733 align:start size:94% position:6%
There they are. Look at that.
New York's finest.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:29.202 size:84% position:42% line:92%
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:31.804 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Um...

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.740 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
Lookit.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:37.977
Look at that. Cool dude.
Knew to put my hand on her head.

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:41.881 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:43.149 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
-There's that.

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.751 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:48.187 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Applause ]
I was not... [ Laughs ]

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:53.359
Uh...No one -- No one offered me
oxygen, I should point out.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:54.827 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:04:54.827 --> 00:04:56.929 align:start size:94% position:6%
Then I had to call our doctor.
I'm calling our doctor.

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:00.300 align:start size:94% position:6%
One of the firemen
cut the umbilical cord.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.002 align:start size:94% position:6%
That, I guess, is something,
they also know how to do,

00:05:03.002 --> 00:05:05.705 align:start size:94% position:6%
which was incredible --
did a great job.

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:08.207
Because when we got to the
hospital, I said, "How is that?"

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:10.243 align:start size:94% position:6%
And they said,
"He did a great job."

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:13.813 align:start size:94% position:6%
And the other crazy thing was
we -- our neighbors --

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.348 align:start size:94% position:6%
like we're --
like, other people --

00:05:15.348 --> 00:05:16.816 align:start size:94% position:6%
like, people live
in this building,

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.851 align:start size:94% position:6%
and our doormen,
who were amazing --

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start size:94% position:6%
they basically were stopping
neighbors from walking

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.256
into their own lobby because of
what was happening.

00:05:23.256 --> 00:05:26.259
And the other thing
was my wife was, like, facing --

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:29.629 size:78% position:39%
her legs were, like,
facing the elevators.

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:30.863 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:33.433 align:start size:94% position:6%
-And, like, thank God no one
came down.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:34.567 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
Because that would have made

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:38.171
for so many awkward interactions
for the rest of the time.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:42.442 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like, "Hey, I was there
that day." Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:45.011 align:start size:94% position:6%
So -- and we had not --
I should point out we have

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:47.180 align:start size:94% position:6%
not lived in this building
for a long time at all.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.748 align:start size:94% position:6%
We just moved in at the end
of last year.

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:52.485
I'm so glad that we are already
co-op-approved,

00:05:52.485 --> 00:05:54.120 size:75% position:38% line:92%
'cause I don't know.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.754 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:57.924 align:start size:94% position:6%
And these people, you know,
that I just -- I know

00:05:57.924 --> 00:05:58.891 line:92%
a little bit from the elevator.

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.226 align:start size:94% position:6%
I know a little bit
from the lobby.

00:06:00.226 --> 00:06:02.028 align:start size:94% position:6%
I mean, I cannot tell you
the kindness

00:06:02.028 --> 00:06:03.663 line:92%
we experienced from them.

00:06:03.663 --> 00:06:05.398 align:start size:94% position:6%
People running up to get us
blankets.

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:07.166 align:start size:94% position:6%
They were putting towels
in their dryer

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:09.168 size:81% position:41%
so we had warm towels
to keep the baby warm.

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:11.637 align:start size:94% position:6%
It was just this incredible
outpouring of kindness

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:14.574 align:start size:94% position:6%
from people we barely knew.
I kept apologizing.

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.242
I kept being like, "I'm so sorry
about this," and, of course,

00:06:16.242 --> 00:06:18.878
everyone was saying, "Oh, my
God. Oh, my God. Don't worry,"

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:20.246 align:start size:94% position:6%
which was so sweet to do,
and of course,

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:22.382 align:start size:94% position:6%
there's no alternative.
It's not like I would say,

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:24.083 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Oh, my God. I'm so sorry,"
and they would say,

00:06:24.083 --> 00:06:26.586 align:start size:94% position:6%
"This isn't what
the lobby's for!"

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:29.489 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:06:29.489 --> 00:06:32.392 align:start size:94% position:6%
And...then, uh, you know,
we, uh,

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:37.463
and then EMTs came, and the EMTs
got her onto the stretcher.

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:40.800
And then we went -- there was
an ambulance waiting for us.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.337
And we got into the ambulance,
and as we were loading my wife

00:06:44.337 --> 00:06:46.239 align:start size:94% position:6%
in the ambulance, there was --
it's a one-way street,

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.673 align:start size:94% position:6%
so there was one car
waiting for us

00:06:47.673 --> 00:06:48.641 align:start size:94% position:6%
to load my wife
in the ambulance.

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:50.743
And again, I said to him, like,
I'm so sorry.

00:06:50.743 --> 00:06:53.646
And he did this, which was
the most New York thing.

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.915 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
He just went...

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:56.783 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:06:56.783 --> 00:07:00.486 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like, he was like, "I g--
all right."

00:07:00.486 --> 00:07:01.320 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.123 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Yeah. Okay.
I don't have a choice."

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:06.426 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:11.431
And then -- I mean, we got to
the hospital and everything --

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:13.533 size:75% position:38% line:92%
everything was fine.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:18.237
It was -- you know, it's crazy,
obviously, anything --

00:07:18.237 --> 00:07:20.273 align:start size:94% position:6%
anytime anyone
has a baby, it's crazy.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.675 align:start size:94% position:6%
but I just -- I owe --
there's just so many people,

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:24.444 align:start size:94% position:6%
if you don't mind,
I would like to thank.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:27.513
I would like to thank our
incredible doorman, Kevin Ramon.

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:30.917
I would like to thank the NYPD,
I would like to thank

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:32.552 line:92%
the firemen from Engine 24.

00:07:32.552 --> 00:07:34.821 size:78% position:39%
I would like to thank
our incredible EMTs

00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:37.590 align:start size:94% position:6%
who showed up and got us
to our hospital,

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.691 size:84% position:42% line:92%
our doctor, Dr. Romoff,

00:07:38.691 --> 00:07:42.495 align:start size:94% position:6%
the incredible staff
at Lenox Hill.

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:44.697 align:start size:94% position:6%
[bleep] the Uber driver,
who charged me.

00:07:44.697 --> 00:07:47.700 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.936 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Cheers and applause ]
I mean, for real.

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:52.605 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Cheers and applause ]
Because...

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:55.608 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Applause ]

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:59.078 line:92%
'Cause we did you a huge favor.

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:03.583 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:09.088 size:88% position:44%
We were about to, like,
negative star your Uber.

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:12.525 align:start size:94% position:6%
Also want to thank
my sister-in-law, Ariel,

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:13.826 size:75% position:38% line:92%
who watched our son.

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:15.962
Neelu, who I literally don't
know what we would have done

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:20.266 align:start size:94% position:6%
what I would've done if I --
yeah. Um...

00:08:20.266 --> 00:08:22.702
[ Laughter ]
And then I want to thank Joanne,

00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:24.837 align:start size:94% position:6%
my mother-in-law,
who was incredible.

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:28.140
She really was. I couldn't have
done it without her.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:31.577 align:start size:94% position:6%
We named our son Axel. Here's
a normal picture of Axel.

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:33.846 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
There he is. Um...

00:08:33.846 --> 00:08:34.780 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
-Aw!

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.417 size:84% position:42% line:92%
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:43.589 align:start size:94% position:6%
-Uh, we named him Axel because
it's just a name we like,

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:45.224 align:start size:94% position:6%
but I'm going to tell him
it's because

00:08:45.224 --> 00:08:47.326 size:84% position:42%
firemen were there when
he was born. [ Laughs ]

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:50.463 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Laughter ]
-He'll say, "I don't like it!"

00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:53.165 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'll say,
"You could have been Hose!"

00:08:53.165 --> 00:08:56.636 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:59.138 line:92%
His middle name is Strahl,

00:08:59.138 --> 00:09:00.239 align:start size:94% position:6%
which is
my mother-in-law Joanne --

00:09:00.239 --> 00:09:03.242
That's her parents' name.
That's her maiden name.

00:09:03.242 --> 00:09:05.545 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I never met
my wife's grandparents,

00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.280 align:start size:94% position:6%
but I've heard so much
about them,

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.082 align:start size:94% position:6%
and they were --
they were Holocaust survivors

00:09:10.082 --> 00:09:13.920 size:78% position:39%
who met the day after
they were liberated.

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.655 align:start size:94% position:6%
They met in a hospital
in Austria.

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:18.691 align:start size:94% position:6%
And days like this,
you really --

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:19.992 align:start size:94% position:6%
you know when someone is born,
you just have such

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:23.195 align:start size:94% position:6%
an appreciation for everyone
in your lineage who lived

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:24.363 align:start size:94% position:6%
so that you could have
this moment.

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:27.667 size:84% position:42%
And we're just so happy
to give him this name

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.969 align:start size:94% position:6%
for people who obviously
had, uh,

00:09:29.969 --> 00:09:34.206
had to work so hard to do that.
And, uh...

00:09:34.206 --> 00:09:37.843 size:84% position:42% line:92%
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.617 align:start size:94% position:6%
Uh, but, of course, mostly
I just want to, uh...

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:46.852 align:start size:94% position:6%
thank my wife, who, uh,
you know, obviously has to

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:49.956 align:start size:94% position:6%
get an apartment closer
to the hospital.

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:52.458 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:57.163
But...I mean, she's so amazing,
and I...

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:58.764 align:start size:94% position:6%
You know, my kids --
like, you know,

00:09:58.764 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start size:94% position:6%
I haven't known 'em very long,
but I can guarantee you

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.869
I'm gonna -- I'm going to love
them unconditionally forever.

00:10:03.869 --> 00:10:08.841 align:start size:94% position:6%
But, uh, as far -- when I --
just the speed in which

00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:11.110 align:start size:94% position:6%
she took this guy and, like,
had him on her

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:13.379 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I just watched them.
Like, that guy is gonna be --

00:10:13.379 --> 00:10:16.148 align:start size:94% position:6%
that kid's going to be fine
forever because of her.

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:17.316 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Voice breaking ]
Um, she's really amazing.

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:21.187
I'm still getting choked up
thinking about how brave I was.

00:10:21.187 --> 00:10:23.189 align:start size:94% position:6% line:92%
[ Laughter ]

00:10:23.189 --> 00:10:25.725 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Applause ]
But, um...

00:10:25.725 --> 00:10:28.794 align:start size:94% position:6%
[ Cheers and applause ]
Uh...

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:29.695 size:81% position:41% line:92%
[ Applause continues ]

00:10:29.695 --> 00:10:33.099
But, you know, obviously I just
want to --

00:10:33.099 --> 00:10:34.667 align:start size:94% position:6%
I thank
my beautiful wife, Alexi,

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:38.204 align:start size:94% position:6%
who is twice now
an incredible rock star

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:40.973 size:84% position:42%
with these incredible
deliveries and stories.

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:43.142 line:92%
And thank you to everyone here

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:44.510 align:start size:94% position:6%
for indulging me
on this crazy story

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.881 align:start size:94% position:6%
and welcome Axel Strahl Meyers
to the world.
