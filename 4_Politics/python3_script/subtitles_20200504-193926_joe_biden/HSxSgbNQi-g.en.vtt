00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.489
 "It seems to me that twin-engine passenger jets cannot be used to fly long-distance transoceanic routes." 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:21.310
 This is the former director of the Federal Aviation Administration 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.640
 What Mr. Lynn Helms said during President Reagan’s administration 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.560
 The United States did not allow dual-engine aircraft to operate at the time 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.640
 Routes more than 60 minutes (flight time) from the alternate airport 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.240
 At that time, the aviation industry believed that the single-engine propulsion could only make the (dual-engine) aircraft safe for about one hour. 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.660
 But this greatly limits the use of twin-engine aircraft 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.640
 Like the North Atlantic route from New York to London, aircraft can only fly in green areas 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.380
 However, the direct routes of the two cities are like this 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.520
 The airline could only choose to bypass the Atlantic with a twin-engine aircraft 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.030
 Or use 3 or 4 engines with lower economic efficiency 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.960
 At the time, it was not a policy to allow airlines to move between smaller cities 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.699
 Direct flight routes operated by Shuangqing aircraft 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.090
 This regulation changed the aviation industry's code for designing aircraft 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.990
 In the 1960s, this regulation only applied to twin-engine aircraft 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.050
 Aircraft manufacturers can of course choose to build fuel-efficient ultra-high-engine 4-engine aircraft 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.270
 But their body must be big enough to make money 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.600
 At that time, Boeing 747 could carry more than 400 passengers 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.520
 So they can only fly super popular routes to have full hope 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.380
 For example, the route between London and New York 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.950
 In order to facilitate more niche routes 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.810
 Airplanes need to lose weight while crossing the ocean legally 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.109
 Three-engine aircraft appeared at this time &lt;3 

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:47.460
 The three-engine aircraft was not restricted at the time 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.660
 60-minute regulations for twin engines 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.310
 The Atlantic route is a piece of cake for them 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.729
 This is why most of the long-haul aircraft seen in the 70s and 80s 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.159
 Are all Boeing 747 or 3-engine aircraft like DC-10 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.360
 This 60-minute rule caused inconvenience for crossing the Atlantic 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.720
 But this changed the development path of Hawaii in the Pacific 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.660
 There is no alternate landing airport between California and Hawaii 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.680
 So this route and the 60-minute rule cannot be touched 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.060
 This determines that airlines can only use large aircraft to operate this route 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.500
 So the only option at the time was to land at Honolulu Airport 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.250
 At that time, there were few routes connecting other small islands with the mainland 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.920
 This means that the other islands are isolated 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.130
 This is the tourism industry of other small islands in Hawaii in recent decades 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:37.380
 One of the reasons it just started to grow 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.390
 Fortunately, the reform is finally here 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.980
 The 60-minute rule begins with a propeller plane 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.660
 And propeller engines often stop in the air 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.330
 This is the reason for installing the backup engine 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.320
 This regulation did not make adjustments to increasingly reliable jet engines 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:01.250
 Statistics show that there are 117 propeller engine failures behind every jet engine failure 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.340
 The advent of the era of jet engines means that engines become safer 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.420
 So the American Aviation Administration allowed Global Airlines in 1985 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.780
 Boeing 767 on the Boston-Paris route 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.840
 A route that may be 120 minutes away from the nearest alternate airport 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.540
 This is the first example of FAA's new certification rules (ETOPS) 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.720
 "Dual Engine Performance Operation Standard" or colloquially speaking 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.000
 "The engine will turn or the passengers will have to swim" 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.480
 Airlines must purchase ETOPS certified aircraft 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.700
 Used to fly over ocean routes 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.430
 This means that the plane has an engine failure 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.950
 There is also sufficient capacity to navigate safely, which requires the aircraft to have a sufficiently powerful background system including backup communications and fire fighting 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.700
 Boeing 767 is the first aircraft to obtain ETOPS certification 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.660
 Its certification level is 180 minutes 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.920
 This means she can fly routes less than 180 minutes from the alternate airport 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.360
 Obtaining certification does not mean that this airline is allowed to fly over ocean routes 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.860
 The aviation company must have a special maintenance plan, as well as specially trained crew members 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.000
 Special dispatchers, different from the usual fuel quantity and special evacuation rescue procedures 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.639
 The aircraft's ability to reach the runway does not mean that she can escape from danger 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.759
 Many times the plane is still critical after landing 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.940
 Alaska’s Cold Bay Airport is a travel between Asia 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.759
 And excellent examples of alternate airports in North America 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.920
 It only has six commercial aircraft a week 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.440
 But it runs long enough to benefit from its previous status as an air base 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.260
 The only problem is that this is a very small town 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.840
 There are only 108 people. When the plane makes an emergency landing, it will greatly increase the population of the town and make the town unable to load 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.100
 Because there are not enough accommodation and food resources to support so many passengers 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.580
 For this reason, if the airline company decides to use Cold Bay Airport as an emergency standby airport 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.360
 Airline Division needs to make a 48-hour plan to place passengers 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.610
 The right engine of a Boeing 787 flying from Shanghai to Chicago last year 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.470
 Breakdown in the middle of the Pacific 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.830
 The plane immediately diverted to Cold Bay Airport 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:16.000
 Before the landing, the whole plan was implemented 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.440
 One is that the flight attendant handed out the second meal early 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.880
 Only a few hours after safety 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.740
 American Airlines engineers set off from Seattle to Cold Bay to repair injured 787 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:31.380
 At the same time, American Airlines' alliance Alaska Airlines began to use 737 in Anchorage to send away trapped passengers 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.319
 In the process, the cabin crew delivered the third meal they prepared while waiting after landing 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.600
 At the same time, the Coast Guard opened its early-warming hangar for passengers 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.640
 Passengers flew to Anchorage only 10 hours after landing and stayed there for one night 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:48.500
 They took American Airlines flight 757 from Anchorage to Chicago the next day 

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:52.620
 This is a perfect case of a passenger grooming plan 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.160
 This compact and orderly plan helps airlines 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.620
 Fast and safe transfer of trapped passengers 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.550
 Thanks to the extremely reliable engine and many different safety measures as well as the well-designed passenger grooming plan 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.790
 Today's aircraft and airlines can obtain incredible ETOPS certification 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:16.259
 The 787 Dreamliner forced to downgrade to Cold Bay holds a 330-minute type rating 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:21.229
 This means she can fly 5.5 hours to the nearest airport 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.480
 Previously, the ultra-long cross-sea route where 4-engine aircraft can fly in the southern hemisphere is feasible 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:31.720
 But the economic benefits cannot be met because airlines cannot find enough passengers on low-demand routes to make a profit 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.140
 For example, the route from Melbourne to San Diego 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:41.560
 LATAM Airlines can operate the 787 on this relatively low demand transoceanic route while making money 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.660
 Thanks to her 330-minute ETOPS type rating 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:50.780
 Airbus A350 even received a 370-minute type rating 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.600
 Means that she flew 6 hours and 10 minutes from the alternate airport 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.900
 So she can sail on any route except for flying straight through Antarctica 

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.360
 The age of the 3 and 4 engine aircraft became the past due to changes in regulations 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:10.160
 Boeing and Airbus' largest aircraft are the only ones they produce today 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.620
 4-engine aircraft (B747 and A380) 

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.300
 Smaller and smaller aircraft can get ETOPS rating 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.400
 So now almost all transatlantic routes are operated with twin engines 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:26.710
 Air Canada uses their rated A319 daily 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.029
 From St John Airport to London Heathrow Airport 

00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:36.229
 British Airways even uses the smaller A318 to operate routes from London Airport to New York 

00:07:36.229 --> 00:07:39.980
 These routes were unthinkable 30 years ago 

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:46.460
 But the reliability of today’s aircraft means that we no longer have to be afraid of crossing the ocean with small aircraft
