00:00:00.131 --> 00:00:01.171
- This week on BuzzFeed Unsolved,

00:00:01.171 --> 00:00:03.160
we investigate the Roswell incident,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.632
either the biggest UFO
cover-up of all time

00:00:05.632 --> 00:00:08.432
or just the biggest
misunderstanding of all time.

00:00:08.432 --> 00:00:11.512
Either way, 70 years later,
we're still debating about it.

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.799
This is the Holy Grail of
alien stories, in my opinion.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:15.632
- Yeah, it's a buzzword.

00:00:15.632 --> 00:00:16.889
You hear it all the time.

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:18.360
I don't know all the gritty details.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.440
Desert, government, aliens, et cetera.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.273
- Alright, let's get into it.

00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:23.851
- Spin a yarn, Tommy Bahama.

00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:26.432
- [Ryan] The year is 1947,

00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:29.241
a year that saw an unusually large wave

00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:31.471
of reported UFO sightings.

00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:34.569
In the last six months of 1947 alone,

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:38.801
there were over 300
claims of UFO sightings.

00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:42.339
Among these, is the
infamous Roswell incident.

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:45.939
Skeptics and believers alike
can agree on one thing:

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:49.869
something crashed in the
fields of Foster Ranch

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:53.539
located just northwest
of Roswell, New Mexico.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.729
Whether that something is
something extraordinary or mundane

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.640
remains highly debated.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.869
You're clearly on the skeptic side here,

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:04.611
already going in, right?

00:01:04.611 --> 00:01:05.549
That's a dumbass question.

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.979
Of course you are, you're fucking Shane.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.099
Alright.

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:09.411
- Don't try to paint me as a--

00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:10.528
- I'll paint you however I want.

00:01:10.528 --> 00:01:11.829
- What?

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.578
- I'll paint the hell out
of you, however I want.

00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:15.491
- You paint me in your free time?

00:01:15.491 --> 00:01:16.324
- Yeah.

00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:17.157
(laughs)

00:01:17.157 --> 00:01:18.779
They're good.
- Oh Jesus.

00:01:18.779 --> 00:01:20.011
- You want to see them?

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:21.219
- Never.

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.419
- [Ryan] Let's go through
the official timeline

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:26.940
as played out in the media
and through official reports

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.768
from the US Air Force.

00:01:28.768 --> 00:01:33.629
Sometime before June 14th, a
crash occurred on Foster Ranch.

00:01:33.629 --> 00:01:37.277
On July 4th, a local
rancher named Mac Brazel

00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:40.549
visits the crash site to
pick up some of the debris.

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.737
On July 7th, Mac Brazel decides
to take some of the debris

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.147
to local sheriff George Wilcox.

00:01:47.147 --> 00:01:50.578
Wilcox then contacts
Colonel Butch Blanchard

00:01:50.578 --> 00:01:55.008
at the nearby military base,
the Roswell Army Airfield.

00:01:55.008 --> 00:01:57.709
This Roswell base was home to the elite

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.659
509th Bombardment Group,
which deployed atomic bombs

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.669
at the end of World War II.

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:07.179
Colonel Blanchard alerts his superior,

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.309
General Roger W. Ramey, and
orders Major Jesse Marcel,

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.096
the 509th's intelligence officer,

00:02:14.096 --> 00:02:17.848
to assess the crash site
and recover the materials.

00:02:17.848 --> 00:02:19.768
- [Shane] So much bureaucracy here.

00:02:19.768 --> 00:02:20.749
- [Ryan] I mean, it's the military.

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:22.808
- You gotta call one guy,
he calls a different guy,

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:25.179
who calls this guy, who orders
this guy to call that guy,

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:26.709
and then that guy's,
this is why information

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.248
gets muddled in cases like these

00:02:28.248 --> 00:02:30.286
because you got this big
shitty chain of command.

00:02:30.286 --> 00:02:31.897
- It's like a game of
telephone essentially,

00:02:31.897 --> 00:02:33.799
but it's the military,
it's a ladder structure.

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:34.988
Of course, it's gonna be that way.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:36.564
- Game of phones.

00:02:36.564 --> 00:02:38.108
- Oh my god.
- Good, huh?

00:02:38.108 --> 00:02:39.727
- No, that was terrible.
- It was good.

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:41.057
- I'm actually upset right now.

00:02:41.057 --> 00:02:42.188
- Good.

00:02:42.188 --> 00:02:43.748
- [Ryan] Colonel Blanchard is briefed

00:02:43.748 --> 00:02:47.428
by intelligence officer
Marcel on his crash site visit

00:02:47.428 --> 00:02:49.457
and, on the morning of July 8th,

00:02:49.457 --> 00:02:52.186
consequently orders
public information officer

00:02:52.186 --> 00:02:55.167
Lieutenant Walter Haut
to issue a press release

00:02:55.167 --> 00:02:59.559
stating that they believe
they have a "flying saucer"

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:01.226
in their possession.

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:05.464
Soon after, the Roswell
Daily Record's front page

00:03:05.464 --> 00:03:09.104
ran the headline, "Roswell Army Airfield

00:03:09.104 --> 00:03:13.271
captures flying saucer on
ranch in Roswell Region,"

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:18.360
where they revealed no
details of "the flying disk."

00:03:19.992 --> 00:03:24.159
That same day, the Air Force
strangely changes their story.

00:03:25.003 --> 00:03:27.391
General Ramey orders the crash remains

00:03:27.391 --> 00:03:29.912
to be taken to him in Fort Worth, Texas

00:03:29.912 --> 00:03:32.280
for his own personal inspection.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.910
He and his staff, including
a base weather officer,

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.123
identify them as pieces
of a weather balloon

00:03:39.123 --> 00:03:42.661
and issue a subsequent press
release with the correction.

00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:44.701
A photo is taken in Ramey's office

00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:46.791
of intelligence officer Marcel

00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:49.923
with the crash materials he misidentified.

00:03:49.923 --> 00:03:51.122
- [Shane] If you're a higher-up,

00:03:51.122 --> 00:03:52.621
and you see this press release,

00:03:52.621 --> 00:03:54.763
and you're like, "What the
fuck are, what is going on?"

00:03:54.763 --> 00:03:55.893
(Ryan laughs)

00:03:55.893 --> 00:03:57.283
"I gotta go clean this up now?"

00:03:57.283 --> 00:03:58.893
- [Ryan] Yeah, yeah.

00:03:58.893 --> 00:04:00.053
- [Shane] And I knew that we were

00:04:00.053 --> 00:04:02.972
pushing our big weather
balloons through that area.

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:04.492
- [Ryan] Oh, I see what you're saying.

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:05.753
- [Shane} And I'm like, well
they're not gonna believe me

00:04:05.753 --> 00:04:08.383
unless I bring in Carl, or
whatever the guy's name.

00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:10.280
- [Ryan] And make him
sit next to his mistake.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.492
- [Shane] Bring in the weatherman,

00:04:11.492 --> 00:04:13.981
bring in the idiot rancher,

00:04:13.981 --> 00:04:15.801
and kinda rub his nose in it, like a--

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:18.543
- [Ryan] I think it's hilarious
that the officer they sent

00:04:18.543 --> 00:04:20.951
to go assess the crash, they made him sit

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:22.652
and pose with all of the
materials in the office

00:04:22.652 --> 00:04:23.485
in the picture.

00:04:23.485 --> 00:04:24.900
- [Shane] "You sit here
for this photograph.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.590
"You know that's a weather
balloon, you idiot."

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.952
(laughs)

00:04:27.952 --> 00:04:31.981
- [Ryan] The next day, on July
9th, the Roswell Daily Record

00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:35.550
runs another article with the headline,

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.717
"Harassed rtncher who located
saucer sorry he told about it"

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.420
in which Brazel reveals that
the supposed alien wreckage

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.681
was merely "rubber strips, tinfoil,

00:04:47.681 --> 00:04:50.514
"a rather tough paper and sticks."

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:53.941
And with Ramey's weather
balloon explanation

00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:56.878
being corroborated by
the case's key witness,

00:04:56.878 --> 00:05:00.280
the world promptly forgets
about the Roswell incident

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.280
for a while.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.160
Enter Stanton Friedman in 1978.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.998
Friedman was a nuclear physicist
and leading UFO researcher.

00:05:08.998 --> 00:05:12.838
In 1978, Friedman
interviewed Jesse Marcel,

00:05:12.838 --> 00:05:16.571
the then retired intelligence
officer from the 509th,

00:05:16.571 --> 00:05:18.709
who was ordered to go assess the wreckage

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:20.438
of the Roswell incident.

00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:23.590
Marcel would fully reignite
the Roswell controversy,

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.270
when he revealed that he still believed

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.128
the wreckage was definitively
not a weather balloon.

00:05:30.128 --> 00:05:33.838
Here's a quote from Major
Marcel, in a different interview,

00:05:33.838 --> 00:05:37.358
regarding the metal at the crash site.

00:05:37.358 --> 00:05:40.038
"It felt like you had
nothing in your hands.

00:05:40.038 --> 00:05:41.905
"It wasn't any thicker than the foil

00:05:41.905 --> 00:05:43.768
"out of a pack of cigarettes.

00:05:43.768 --> 00:05:45.656
"But the thing about it that got me

00:05:45.656 --> 00:05:47.758
"is that you couldn't even bend it,

00:05:47.758 --> 00:05:49.198
"you couldn't dent it,

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:52.048
"even a sledgehammer
would bounce off of it.

00:05:52.048 --> 00:05:56.047
"I knew that I had never seen
anything like that before."

00:05:56.047 --> 00:06:00.207
He goes on to say, "It was
not anything from this earth,

00:06:00.207 --> 00:06:02.058
"that I'm quite sure of.

00:06:02.058 --> 00:06:03.586
"Being an intelligence officer,

00:06:03.586 --> 00:06:06.258
"I was familiar with
just about all materials

00:06:06.258 --> 00:06:09.738
"used in aircraft and/or air travel.

00:06:09.738 --> 00:06:14.437
"This was nothing like that.
It could not have been."

00:06:14.437 --> 00:06:16.597
- [Shane] That was some
funky, funky metal.

00:06:16.597 --> 00:06:18.098
- [Ryan] I mean, they
took a sledgehammer to it.

00:06:18.098 --> 00:06:20.155
- [Shane] I like the sound of this metal.

00:06:20.155 --> 00:06:21.466
- [Ryan] Yeah, it sounds like

00:06:21.466 --> 00:06:23.005
I wanna get my hands on this metal.

00:06:23.005 --> 00:06:26.578
- I like that he's given some
tactile descriptions here.

00:06:26.578 --> 00:06:29.185
It's not just something wasn't right.

00:06:29.185 --> 00:06:30.626
- It wouldn't go unshining.

00:06:30.626 --> 00:06:35.135
- Yeah, he's talking about the
weight of it, the feel of it.

00:06:35.135 --> 00:06:36.455
I like this.

00:06:36.455 --> 00:06:37.927
- [Ryan] After this admission,

00:06:37.927 --> 00:06:40.255
Friedman interviewed more witnesses,

00:06:40.255 --> 00:06:42.935
both civilian and military,

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:45.006
and in the end, concluded
that they had been

00:06:45.006 --> 00:06:49.506
in massive cover-up of the
Roswell incident in 1947.

00:06:49.506 --> 00:06:51.256
A "cosmic watergate".

00:06:53.194 --> 00:06:55.705
A cover-up that allegedly includes

00:06:55.705 --> 00:06:58.492
details of the crash site, the materials,

00:06:58.492 --> 00:07:00.563
the possible spacecraft

00:07:00.563 --> 00:07:04.355
and even alien bodies found at the scene.

00:07:04.355 --> 00:07:07.755
And with that, let's get
into the two main theories.

00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:10.163
The first theory is that
the events at Roswell

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:11.854
transpired as reported,

00:07:11.854 --> 00:07:14.963
and the alien wreck was
merely a weather balloon,

00:07:14.963 --> 00:07:16.955
as stated by the Air Force.

00:07:16.955 --> 00:07:19.196
When you look at the
physical evidence available,

00:07:19.196 --> 00:07:20.927
this appears to be what happened.

00:07:20.927 --> 00:07:25.443
Though, in 1994, the US
Air Force released a report

00:07:25.443 --> 00:07:28.826
admitting that there
was in fact a cover-up.

00:07:28.826 --> 00:07:32.226
However, it wasn't a cover-up
of extraterrestrials,

00:07:32.226 --> 00:07:36.677
but instead, a cover-up of a
top secret military operation.

00:07:36.677 --> 00:07:39.475
The report states that the
remains found on Foster Ranch

00:07:39.475 --> 00:07:43.675
in 1947 were indeed the
remains of a weather balloon,

00:07:43.675 --> 00:07:46.366
but not any regular weather balloon.

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:49.377
This balloon, was part of
a then top-secret program

00:07:49.377 --> 00:07:51.284
called Project Mogul.

00:07:51.284 --> 00:07:54.366
Project Mogul was conceived
up by Dr. Maurice Ewing,

00:07:54.366 --> 00:07:56.126
at Columbia University.

00:07:56.126 --> 00:07:58.604
He theorized that just
as underwater microphones

00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:01.375
could detect sound waves
produced by explosions,

00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:02.886
thousands of miles away,

00:08:02.886 --> 00:08:07.618
perhaps an airborne monitoring
system could do the same.

00:08:07.618 --> 00:08:10.007
Thus, as fears of nuclear war proliferated

00:08:10.007 --> 00:08:11.578
after World War II,

00:08:11.578 --> 00:08:14.228
and intensified at the
start of the Cold War,

00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:17.627
the top-secret airborne weather
balloons at Project Mogul,

00:08:17.627 --> 00:08:20.616
were launched to detect any nuclear tests

00:08:20.616 --> 00:08:22.427
carried out by the soviets.

00:08:22.427 --> 00:08:25.004
- Boy, that's a big explanation.

00:08:25.004 --> 00:08:26.826
- Yeah, here's the thing.

00:08:26.826 --> 00:08:28.673
If people are already
on you for a cover-up,

00:08:28.673 --> 00:08:30.855
I don't think it's a good
card to play to be like,

00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:32.466
"Oh, there was a cover-up,

00:08:32.466 --> 00:08:33.924
"that's why we were acting so weird.

00:08:33.924 --> 00:08:35.095
"But it was this, not that.

00:08:35.095 --> 00:08:37.066
"Don't look over there, look over here."

00:08:37.066 --> 00:08:37.946
It's the same thing.

00:08:37.946 --> 00:08:39.644
- Yeah, and also,

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:40.477
it's sort of they're trying

00:08:40.477 --> 00:08:42.314
to have their cake and
eat it too, by saying,

00:08:42.314 --> 00:08:44.034
"There was a cover-up,

00:08:44.034 --> 00:08:47.466
"but it was just a real
nice weather balloon."

00:08:47.466 --> 00:08:48.815
(laughs)

00:08:48.815 --> 00:08:50.895
"Like you've never seen, made out of

00:08:50.895 --> 00:08:52.855
"some real strange metal."

00:08:52.855 --> 00:08:53.924
- Very shiny.

00:08:53.924 --> 00:08:56.674
- Oh, the shiniest weather
balloon you've ever seen.

00:08:56.674 --> 00:08:58.466
- [Ryan] Project Mogul's
balloons were tested out

00:08:58.466 --> 00:09:01.946
at several locations around
the US and in the Pacific.

00:09:01.946 --> 00:09:05.381
And one of these locations
was over New Mexico,

00:09:05.381 --> 00:09:07.214
in the summer of 1947.

00:09:08.363 --> 00:09:13.142
Project Mogul balloons typically
measured over 650 feet long

00:09:13.142 --> 00:09:15.571
and had a tail on which various listening

00:09:15.571 --> 00:09:17.929
and sensory equipment was attached,

00:09:17.929 --> 00:09:19.803
which the military posits,

00:09:19.803 --> 00:09:23.252
could possibly be misidentified as a UFO.

00:09:23.252 --> 00:09:25.270
Interesting.
- [Shane] If it was 600 feet,

00:09:25.270 --> 00:09:26.790
it's gonna be a huge pile of debris,

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:28.692
there's gonna be a lot
of weird shit there,

00:09:28.692 --> 00:09:29.661
you're gonna be very confused.

00:09:29.661 --> 00:09:31.482
- [Ryan] At a glance, from far away,

00:09:31.482 --> 00:09:33.129
I'd be like, "Holy shit,
look at that field,

00:09:33.129 --> 00:09:34.501
"littered with debris-
- [Shane] No.

00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:35.752
- [Ryan] No, no, no, and I'd-
- [Shane] You would walk up

00:09:35.752 --> 00:09:38.090
to it and be like, "The end is nigh."

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.181
- [Ryan] (wheeze) No.

00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:41.322
- [Shane] You'd go running
through town, ringing a bell.

00:09:41.322 --> 00:09:43.070
"The Martians are here,

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:45.752
"lock yourselves in your basements."

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.520
- [Ryan] What I would do
is, maybe I'd do that,

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.469
running towards it.

00:09:48.469 --> 00:09:49.922
Then I'd get close and be like,

00:09:49.922 --> 00:09:52.989
"Oh, it's fucking tongue
depressors and Elmer's glue,"

00:09:52.989 --> 00:09:56.012
'cause that's what it
was, balsa wood sticks.

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.561
- [Shane] You gotta keep it
light if you want it to float.

00:09:58.561 --> 00:10:01.106
- [Ryan] That's not alien
materials, is what I'm getting at.

00:10:01.106 --> 00:10:02.706
I would obviously get close and be like,

00:10:02.706 --> 00:10:04.256
"Oh, this is just human's shit."

00:10:04.256 --> 00:10:06.577
In February of 1994,

00:10:06.577 --> 00:10:09.645
the general accounting
office of the US Congress,

00:10:09.645 --> 00:10:12.078
initiated an audit, at the request

00:10:12.078 --> 00:10:16.028
of New Mexico congressman,
Steve Schiff, a UFO skeptic,

00:10:16.028 --> 00:10:18.748
to locate all government records

00:10:18.748 --> 00:10:21.278
relating to the Roswell
incident and determine

00:10:21.278 --> 00:10:24.598
if these records were handled properly.

00:10:24.598 --> 00:10:28.804
The report was published by
the US Air Force in 1995,

00:10:28.804 --> 00:10:32.884
titled, "The Roswell
report: fact versus fiction

00:10:32.884 --> 00:10:35.717
"in the New Mexico desert."

00:10:35.717 --> 00:10:37.957
The findings of the audit
supported the theory

00:10:37.957 --> 00:10:41.106
that debris found in
1947 was from a balloon

00:10:41.106 --> 00:10:45.645
used in Project Mogul, and
found no evidence that aliens

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:48.736
or alien spacecraft were involved.

00:10:48.736 --> 00:10:51.116
The report concludes that
Marcel and Blanchard's

00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:54.332
original flying saucer
press release was, in part,

00:10:54.332 --> 00:10:57.644
an overreaction, and
in part due to the fact

00:10:57.644 --> 00:11:00.303
that flying saucer was a new term

00:11:00.303 --> 00:11:03.046
that didn't yet have a clear meaning.

00:11:03.046 --> 00:11:04.236
Bullshit.

00:11:04.236 --> 00:11:05.276
- [Shane] Uh, that's fair.

00:11:05.276 --> 00:11:06.716
- [Ryan] Are you fucking kidding me?

00:11:06.716 --> 00:11:08.196
- So, flying saucer, at that point,

00:11:08.196 --> 00:11:10.085
didn't necessarily mean space alien,

00:11:10.085 --> 00:11:12.013
it was just literally like,

00:11:12.013 --> 00:11:13.505
"That looks like the thing I put my tea on

00:11:13.505 --> 00:11:15.255
but it's levitating."

00:11:17.686 --> 00:11:19.014
Right?

00:11:19.014 --> 00:11:20.254
- What?

00:11:20.254 --> 00:11:23.405
You're saying that they
didn't know what they meant

00:11:23.405 --> 00:11:25.354
when they said flying saucer?

00:11:25.354 --> 00:11:28.445
- I mean, it hasn't always
been in the national lexicon,

00:11:28.445 --> 00:11:32.885
there weren't people in Ancient
Rome saying flying saucer.

00:11:32.885 --> 00:11:36.182
- [Ryan] In 1997, the Air
Force released another report

00:11:36.182 --> 00:11:39.682
titled, "The Roswell report: case closed,"

00:11:40.794 --> 00:11:43.734
in which they offered
this possible explanation

00:11:43.734 --> 00:11:47.134
for claims to alien bodies
found at the crash site.

00:11:47.134 --> 00:11:50.846
In the mid 1950s, the
military tested the effects

00:11:50.846 --> 00:11:53.064
of parachute jumping on humans,

00:11:53.064 --> 00:11:56.754
by dropping human-like
dummies over New Mexico.

00:11:56.754 --> 00:12:00.054
The dummies had latex or plastic skin,

00:12:00.054 --> 00:12:02.886
and could be mistaken per alien bodies

00:12:02.886 --> 00:12:05.905
by witnesses at the Roswell crash.

00:12:05.905 --> 00:12:10.134
But, if these dummy drops
were in the mid 1950s,

00:12:10.134 --> 00:12:13.075
how could this possibly
explain the Roswell incident,

00:12:13.075 --> 00:12:15.916
that preceded it by several years?

00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:18.366
The military has an answer for that, too.

00:12:18.366 --> 00:12:20.914
Air Force Colonel John
Haynes, explains that

00:12:20.914 --> 00:12:23.725
during the recounting
of events decades later,

00:12:23.725 --> 00:12:26.725
details "tend to become compressed,"

00:12:28.236 --> 00:12:32.666
suggesting, both he and the
Air Force, actually believe

00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:36.526
that witnesses are mixing up
events from the mid 1950s,

00:12:36.526 --> 00:12:39.707
with what was perhaps, the
most horrifying memories

00:12:39.707 --> 00:12:42.457
of their lives years earlier.

00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:44.068
- [Shane] Eh, we've all done it.

00:12:44.068 --> 00:12:44.901
- [Ryan] No.

00:12:44.901 --> 00:12:45.734
- [Shane] Right?

00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:46.567
- [Ryan] No, I mean,

00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:48.036
sure, if I'm trying to remember

00:12:48.036 --> 00:12:50.228
what I had for breakfast a year ago,

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.276
yeah, I'm gonna be a little foggy on that.

00:12:52.276 --> 00:12:53.737
But, if I'm remembering that time

00:12:53.737 --> 00:12:57.028
I saw alien bodies thrown from a wreckage,

00:12:57.028 --> 00:12:59.406
I think I'm gonna
remember that quite clear

00:12:59.406 --> 00:13:00.864
and when it happened.

00:13:00.864 --> 00:13:02.803
Another discrepancy is the fact

00:13:02.803 --> 00:13:07.673
that the bodies are repeatedly
described as "little",

00:13:07.673 --> 00:13:09.772
often four feet or less,

00:13:09.772 --> 00:13:14.023
yet the dummies used on these
drops were six feet tall.

00:13:14.023 --> 00:13:17.732
It's unclear how this
contradiction is also an effect

00:13:17.732 --> 00:13:19.393
of time compression.

00:13:19.393 --> 00:13:23.000
That being said, one interesting
tidbit from the report,

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.509
is the fact that, upon requesting files

00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:27.440
from the Roswell Air Force base,

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.789
from the year of the
Roswell incident in 1947,

00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:35.161
it was found that all
records from that time,

00:13:35.161 --> 00:13:39.161
from January to October
1947 had been destroyed.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.869
And even more suspicious,
the person or organization

00:13:43.869 --> 00:13:45.731
that had destroyed these files,

00:13:45.731 --> 00:13:48.509
and the authority under
which they had done so,

00:13:48.509 --> 00:13:50.520
were not indicated.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.411
- [Shane] Well.

00:13:51.411 --> 00:13:52.320
- [Ryan] This is a reach.

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:53.760
- [Shane] It's a bit of a reach.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:55.149
- [Ryan] There it is,
that's all I wanted to hear.

00:13:55.149 --> 00:13:56.251
- [Shane] No, it's a bit of a reach.

00:13:56.251 --> 00:13:57.171
(Ryan laughs)

00:13:57.171 --> 00:13:58.588
No, no. Some of this is gonna be baloney,

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:01.548
other bits I might not be so sure.

00:14:01.548 --> 00:14:03.669
- [Ryan] This one is certified fresh?

00:14:03.669 --> 00:14:07.341
- [Shane] (sniffs) Yeah,
I'll take a bite of that.

00:14:07.341 --> 00:14:08.931
- (laughs) That's a fresh cut.

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:12.131
And with that, let's get
into the second theory,

00:14:12.131 --> 00:14:14.749
that the Government engaged in a cover-up

00:14:14.749 --> 00:14:17.651
to hide knowledge of alien life.

00:14:17.651 --> 00:14:22.328
Actually, before I get into
it, I do have one more thing.

00:14:22.328 --> 00:14:24.740
- What's? No, no, no.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.706
This is not usually part of the thing.

00:14:27.706 --> 00:14:28.980
What are you doing?

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.369
Are you putting a tin foil hat? (laughs)

00:14:32.369 --> 00:14:33.757
- [Ryan] Before I get into this,

00:14:33.757 --> 00:14:36.228
I would like to preface
this theory with a fact

00:14:36.228 --> 00:14:38.718
that most of this is based off interviews

00:14:38.718 --> 00:14:41.987
with those who claimed to
have eyewitness testimony.

00:14:41.987 --> 00:14:46.298
The amount of witnesses is said
to be more than 600 people,

00:14:46.298 --> 00:14:50.258
ranging from civilian
to high-level military.

00:14:50.258 --> 00:14:53.578
Some details of these
stories vary between sources,

00:14:53.578 --> 00:14:56.629
so we've chosen to mainly
focus on interviews conducted

00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:58.287
by two respected researchers,

00:14:58.287 --> 00:15:01.707
named Thomas J. Carey
and Donald R. Schmitt,

00:15:01.707 --> 00:15:05.046
for their book, "Witness to Roswell,

00:15:05.046 --> 00:15:07.486
"Unmasking the 60-year cover-up."

00:15:07.486 --> 00:15:11.678
And while most skeptics
will scoff at that notion,

00:15:11.678 --> 00:15:14.925
consider this: if there
are hundreds of witnesses

00:15:14.925 --> 00:15:19.256
to a murder, all recounting
similar details of the crime,

00:15:19.256 --> 00:15:21.951
would you doubt they
were telling the truth?

00:15:21.951 --> 00:15:22.784
- [Shane] I don't know,

00:15:22.784 --> 00:15:25.216
I guess it depends on the circumstances.

00:15:25.216 --> 00:15:27.947
- [Ryan] No, there's hundreds of people.

00:15:27.947 --> 00:15:28.947
- [Shane] (laughs) I just don't want you

00:15:28.947 --> 00:15:29.806
to have any satisfaction.

00:15:29.806 --> 00:15:31.676
- [Ryan] You know I'm
making a good point there.

00:15:31.676 --> 00:15:32.756
If there's hundreds of people--

00:15:32.756 --> 00:15:33.589
- [Shane] I'm not gonna give it to you.

00:15:33.589 --> 00:15:34.426
- [Ryan] No, you're gonna give..

00:15:34.426 --> 00:15:36.156
By saying, "I'm not giving
you the satisfaction,"

00:15:36.156 --> 00:15:38.308
means you internally
want to agree with that.

00:15:38.308 --> 00:15:40.628
- [Shane] If there's only eyewitness proof

00:15:40.628 --> 00:15:43.208
and no actual proof of the murder?

00:15:43.208 --> 00:15:44.227
- [Ryan] Sure, if there's five people.

00:15:44.227 --> 00:15:45.259
But if there's six hundred

00:15:45.259 --> 00:15:47.127
that have high-level
military fucking people

00:15:47.127 --> 00:15:48.427
within that group...

00:15:48.427 --> 00:15:50.065
- [Shane] No blood though?

00:15:50.065 --> 00:15:52.139
No blood, no evidence, no nothing?

00:15:52.139 --> 00:15:54.357
- [Ryan] There's 600 people,
why would they all lie?

00:15:54.357 --> 00:15:55.859
- The more riled up you get right now,

00:15:55.859 --> 00:15:59.316
the worse you come off,
because of this accessory.

00:15:59.316 --> 00:16:01.187
- Yeah, I realize..
- It's really not helping.

00:16:01.187 --> 00:16:03.779
- I realize now that
this was a very bad call,

00:16:03.779 --> 00:16:04.928
I thought it would be really funny,

00:16:04.928 --> 00:16:06.566
but now I realize I look
like a fucking fool.

00:16:06.566 --> 00:16:09.116
Let's begin by going
over suspicious details

00:16:09.116 --> 00:16:10.819
around the time of the crash.

00:16:10.819 --> 00:16:14.707
Particularly, the contradiction
between the official record

00:16:14.707 --> 00:16:16.827
and eye-witness testimony.

00:16:16.827 --> 00:16:19.321
When Mac Brazel took
some of the crash debris

00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:20.361
to the sheriff,

00:16:20.361 --> 00:16:24.201
debris that crash site witnesses
described as otherworldly,

00:16:24.201 --> 00:16:28.373
Brazel also reported immediately
something significant.

00:16:28.373 --> 00:16:30.834
According to a local radio personality,

00:16:30.834 --> 00:16:33.831
Frank Joyce, at the KGFL radio station,

00:16:33.831 --> 00:16:38.204
Brazel admitted that the
crash site was likely a UFO,

00:16:38.204 --> 00:16:41.292
and more importantly, that
there were alien bodies

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:42.662
on the scene.

00:16:42.662 --> 00:16:45.322
According to Jud Roberts, a minority owner

00:16:45.322 --> 00:16:47.571
of KGFL radio station,

00:16:47.571 --> 00:16:50.179
this admission would be recorded later,

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:54.029
but KGFL did not air the
interview due to phone calls

00:16:54.029 --> 00:16:57.779
from the FCC and US Senator Dennis Chavez

00:16:57.779 --> 00:16:59.669
urging them not to.

00:16:59.669 --> 00:17:01.899
- [Shane] If you got a crazy
guy still spouting lies,

00:17:01.899 --> 00:17:03.459
yeah, I'll put a stop to him.

00:17:03.459 --> 00:17:06.619
- [Ryan] Or, you got a very
sane guy spouting truth.

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:07.749
- [Shane] Yeah, or that.

00:17:07.749 --> 00:17:09.011
(Ryan laughs)

00:17:09.011 --> 00:17:11.829
- [Ryan] As detailed before,
the military would issue

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:16.209
an incendiary press release,
saying they had a flying saucer

00:17:16.209 --> 00:17:19.369
only to correct themselves, a day later.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:22.356
Like the military,
Brazel would also recant

00:17:22.356 --> 00:17:26.059
any statements made
about UFOs at this time.

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:28.307
According to researchers
Carey and Schmitt,

00:17:28.307 --> 00:17:30.579
shortly after Brazel's new statements,

00:17:30.579 --> 00:17:35.019
neighbors said Brazel purchased
a brand new pickup truck,

00:17:35.019 --> 00:17:38.137
and left his job as a
rancher to start a business,

00:17:38.137 --> 00:17:40.607
in Alamogordo, New Mexico.

00:17:40.607 --> 00:17:43.436
Also suspicious in Carey
and Schmitt's findings:

00:17:43.436 --> 00:17:46.767
on testimonies from
locals and Brazel's family

00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:50.127
that revealed Brazel was
detained by the military

00:17:50.127 --> 00:17:52.797
around this time, further sugggesting

00:17:52.797 --> 00:17:54.408
that he could've been forced

00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:57.337
to recant his statements about UFOs.

00:17:57.337 --> 00:17:59.977
The military also
reportedly threatened locals

00:17:59.977 --> 00:18:03.428
to keep quiet, as well
as ransacked their homes

00:18:03.428 --> 00:18:05.729
for remaining crash site materials.

00:18:05.729 --> 00:18:08.759
This is corroborated by the
testimony of the foster daughter

00:18:08.759 --> 00:18:12.529
of Colonel Hunter G. Penn,
an Army Air Force officer,

00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:14.937
who's supposedly admitted
to his foster daughter

00:18:14.937 --> 00:18:19.104
that he was tasked with enforcing
an "information blackout",

00:18:20.777 --> 00:18:23.656
with a focus on the little bodies.

00:18:23.656 --> 00:18:26.417
He was authorized to use physical force

00:18:26.417 --> 00:18:30.649
and weaponry if necessary,
to get this accomplished.

00:18:30.649 --> 00:18:32.217
Another interesting contradiction

00:18:32.217 --> 00:18:35.709
was that Colonel Blanchard,
the superior to Major Marcel,

00:18:35.709 --> 00:18:38.690
who approved the initial
flying saucer press release,

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.589
strangely went on leave

00:18:40.589 --> 00:18:43.669
after he issued the controversial release.

00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:47.321
However, according to
Lieutenant Colonel Joe Briley,

00:18:47.321 --> 00:18:49.911
who was a staff member
of Colonel Blanchard,

00:18:49.911 --> 00:18:53.521
the reported leave was actually a cover-up

00:18:53.521 --> 00:18:56.609
to allow Blanchard to
coordinate a cleanup operation

00:18:56.609 --> 00:18:58.561
of the crash site.

00:18:58.561 --> 00:19:00.751
- [Shane] I mean, if he
fucked up and was like,

00:19:00.751 --> 00:19:01.849
"Yeah, it's UFOs,"

00:19:01.849 --> 00:19:03.220
and they were like, "No, it's not UFOs,

00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:04.489
"you stupid piece of shit."

00:19:04.489 --> 00:19:05.829
(Ryan laughs)

00:19:05.829 --> 00:19:07.369
"We'll fix your mess.

00:19:07.369 --> 00:19:08.679
"Why don't you take a little time off?"

00:19:08.679 --> 00:19:09.512
- [Ryan] "Why don't you leave?"

00:19:09.512 --> 00:19:10.921
- [Shane] "Get your shit
together, get your life together."

00:19:10.921 --> 00:19:11.848
- [Ryan] "Yeah, why don't you leave?"

00:19:11.848 --> 00:19:13.298
so people could look at
that later and be like,

00:19:13.298 --> 00:19:15.311
"Why did he leave, after he
makes this weird announcement?"

00:19:15.311 --> 00:19:16.144
- [Shane] I don't think they care.

00:19:16.144 --> 00:19:17.300
Again, I don't think they care.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.133
- [Ryan] I mean, they should care

00:19:18.133 --> 00:19:20.337
if there're people who
concentrate on details,

00:19:20.337 --> 00:19:21.569
is what I'm saying.

00:19:21.569 --> 00:19:24.409
Perhaps the key contradiction
is the photo taken

00:19:24.409 --> 00:19:26.001
in General Ramey's office

00:19:26.001 --> 00:19:28.740
of the supposed crash site materials.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:30.140
A sealed statement,

00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.887
apparently written by
Roswell Army Airfield's

00:19:32.887 --> 00:19:36.567
public information officer,
Lieutenant Walter G. Haut,

00:19:36.567 --> 00:19:39.128
which was only to be
opened after his death,

00:19:39.128 --> 00:19:43.237
claimed the photo taken in
Ramey's office was a hoax.

00:19:43.237 --> 00:19:46.016
Haut wrote that the actual crash materials

00:19:46.016 --> 00:19:49.027
were substituted with
weather balloon materials,

00:19:49.027 --> 00:19:53.637
and then photographed with
Marcel, a fact that upset Marcel.

00:19:53.637 --> 00:19:56.317
Just to hammer home the
possibility of a cover-up,

00:19:56.317 --> 00:19:59.787
a man named Ben Games,
was a personal pilot,

00:19:59.787 --> 00:20:02.656
to then Major General Laurence C. Craigie,

00:20:02.656 --> 00:20:05.717
the Chief of the engineering
division at Wright field,

00:20:05.717 --> 00:20:08.177
the air force base commonly thought to be

00:20:08.177 --> 00:20:11.817
where the UFO and aliens
were transported and housed.

00:20:11.817 --> 00:20:16.388
According to Games' testimony,
he flew Major General Craigie

00:20:16.388 --> 00:20:19.365
to Roswell, to examine the crash wreckage,

00:20:19.365 --> 00:20:23.532
and after a few hours, flew
General Craigie directly to DC

00:20:24.799 --> 00:20:27.068
to meet with President Truman.

00:20:27.068 --> 00:20:30.159
A few months later, Craigie
assumed the position

00:20:30.159 --> 00:20:33.257
of air force chief director of R&amp;D,

00:20:33.257 --> 00:20:36.527
and perhaps, influenced
by what he saw at Roswell,

00:20:36.527 --> 00:20:40.647
founded Project Sign, the
first official investigation

00:20:40.647 --> 00:20:42.980
of UFOs by the US air force.

00:20:43.848 --> 00:20:45.259
- [Shane] You know, maybe
he got there and said,

00:20:45.259 --> 00:20:46.560
"This is obviously a weather balloon,

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.498
"a UFO wouldn't do this,
it's not what UFOs are like."

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:51.208
And they were like, "Oh,
this guy knows a lot about

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.937
"what UFOs aren't."

00:20:52.937 --> 00:20:56.288
- [Ryan] No. (laughs) No, you don't-

00:20:56.288 --> 00:20:58.488
- [Shane] This guy's got a
good eye for what isn't a UFO.

00:20:58.488 --> 00:20:59.440
- [Ryan] So, you're
saying they send someone

00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:00.389
out in the ocean and be like,

00:21:00.389 --> 00:21:01.949
"Oh man, I didn't find Godzilla out here,

00:21:01.949 --> 00:21:04.400
"we should start a program
about finding about Godzilla."

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.920
- [Shane] I mean, clearly
he's got a good eye

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.118
for detecting what's not bullshit.

00:21:08.118 --> 00:21:09.021
- [Ryan] Now that we've established

00:21:09.021 --> 00:21:10.560
the cover-up in timeline,

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.810
let's quickly go over
some of the controversial

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:15.771
and fascinating details of this theory.

00:21:15.771 --> 00:21:20.181
Starting with the reported
alien bodies at the scene.

00:21:20.181 --> 00:21:23.891
The supposed witnesses are
consistent in their descriptions

00:21:23.891 --> 00:21:28.058
of the bodies as short in
stature, maybe 3.5 to four feet,

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:33.338
with large heads, large
eyes, only holes for a nose,

00:21:33.338 --> 00:21:35.937
and a small slit for the mouth.

00:21:35.937 --> 00:21:38.720
Numerous military officials
have claimed to hear

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:40.920
secondhand information of the bodies,

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.789
or even see the aliens for themselves.

00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:46.030
To name a few, there's First Lieutenant

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.659
and public information
officer at the Roswell Base

00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:49.930
Walter G. Haut,

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:53.099
retired Brigadier General Arthur E. Exon

00:21:53.099 --> 00:21:55.338
and Tech Sergeant Herschel Grice.

00:21:55.338 --> 00:21:57.187
Moving on to the spacecraft,

00:21:57.187 --> 00:21:59.880
according to Sergeant William C. Ennis,

00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.018
he was, at the time, a flight engineer

00:22:02.018 --> 00:22:04.720
of the 393rd bomb squadron,

00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.410
stationed in one of the
primary receiving hangars

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:10.818
for the debris, called hangar P-3.

00:22:10.818 --> 00:22:14.749
For years, Sergeant
Ennis denied the crash,

00:22:14.749 --> 00:22:17.029
writing it off as a weather balloon,

00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:18.800
like the rest of the military.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.967
However, in 2008, Sergeant
Ennis changed his tune,

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.978
admitting "It was a spaceship.
After all these years,

00:22:28.978 --> 00:22:33.338
"I still don't know how that
ship flew, there was no engine.

00:22:33.338 --> 00:22:36.005
"Before I go, I'd like to know."

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:41.070
- Before I go, I gotta
know how their ship flew.

00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:43.289
With the honest--

00:22:43.289 --> 00:22:46.908
- I like to imagining him
talking to his grandson,

00:22:46.908 --> 00:22:49.739
"The ship had no wings, did you hear me?

00:22:49.739 --> 00:22:51.430
"I don't know how it flew."

00:22:51.430 --> 00:22:53.540
- Jimmy, I think that ship was bedeviled.

00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.230
- [Ryan] The craft was also confirmed

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.460
in numerous other testimonies,

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.847
notably by Lieutenant Walter Haut,

00:23:00.847 --> 00:23:04.455
who described in his affidavit
a ship Colonel Blanchard

00:23:04.455 --> 00:23:07.959
had shown to him that
roughly 12 to 15 feet long

00:23:07.959 --> 00:23:09.569
and windowless.

00:23:09.569 --> 00:23:12.759
To close this out, let's move
on to the scattered debris

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:15.249
from the crash site, which many claimed,

00:23:15.249 --> 00:23:19.249
included a mysterious material,
that was described as,

00:23:19.249 --> 00:23:20.499
"memory metal".

00:23:21.577 --> 00:23:24.399
Some depth for more than two
dozen witnesses testimonies,

00:23:24.399 --> 00:23:26.729
ranging from military to civilian.

00:23:26.729 --> 00:23:30.569
The metal was said to be
weightless, smooth, thin,

00:23:30.569 --> 00:23:33.649
and could not be cut, scratched or burned.

00:23:33.649 --> 00:23:37.108
Though, the metal was able to
be temporarily manipulated.

00:23:37.108 --> 00:23:39.439
Here's a quote from Roswell Army Airfield

00:23:39.439 --> 00:23:41.997
Sergeant Earl Fulford,

00:23:41.997 --> 00:23:44.955
"I picked it up, but once
in the palm of your hand,

00:23:44.955 --> 00:23:47.448
you could wad it up into a small ball.

00:23:47.448 --> 00:23:50.515
Then, when you let it go,
it would immediately assume

00:23:50.515 --> 00:23:55.495
its original shape in a second
or two, just like that."

00:23:55.495 --> 00:23:57.678
This free-flowing quality of the metal

00:23:57.678 --> 00:24:00.198
was echoed amongst many testimonies.

00:24:00.198 --> 00:24:03.295
Retired Brigadier General,
Arthur E. Exon, said,

00:24:03.295 --> 00:24:06.506
"Some could be easily ripped or changed.

00:24:06.506 --> 00:24:09.015
There were other parts
of it that were very thin

00:24:09.015 --> 00:24:11.917
but awfully strong and couldn't be dented

00:24:11.917 --> 00:24:13.584
with heavy hammers."

00:24:14.886 --> 00:24:17.617
Exon also explained
that these observations

00:24:17.617 --> 00:24:20.927
were from his time as a Lieutenant
Colonel, when he was also

00:24:20.927 --> 00:24:23.258
an administration student in technology

00:24:23.258 --> 00:24:25.797
at Wright Field's foreign
technology division,

00:24:25.797 --> 00:24:27.317
a division whose purpose

00:24:27.317 --> 00:24:30.277
was to reverse engineer foreign tech.

00:24:30.277 --> 00:24:34.389
Additionally, a memo
surfaced in the early 1980s,

00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:38.197
detailing a September
15, 1950 conversation

00:24:38.197 --> 00:24:40.698
between physicist Robert I. Sarbacher,

00:24:40.698 --> 00:24:43.417
a consultant with a US
Department of Defense Research

00:24:43.417 --> 00:24:47.078
and Development Board and
other government scientists.

00:24:47.078 --> 00:24:50.205
In the memo, Sarbacher
is said to have worked

00:24:50.205 --> 00:24:53.988
on a field reverse engineering
project, allegedly stating,

00:24:53.988 --> 00:24:57.286
"All we know is, we didn't make them,

00:24:57.286 --> 00:25:01.453
and it's pretty certain they
didn't originate on the Earth."

00:25:02.347 --> 00:25:03.896
- [Shane] That's good.

00:25:03.896 --> 00:25:05.046
I love it.

00:25:05.046 --> 00:25:05.937
- [Ryan] I'm just...

00:25:05.937 --> 00:25:08.697
I think right now I'm just
punching the skeptics in the face

00:25:08.697 --> 00:25:09.638
over and over again.

00:25:09.638 --> 00:25:10.988
I'm slowly hammering away.

00:25:10.988 --> 00:25:13.697
One last point in favor of a cover-up.

00:25:13.697 --> 00:25:16.817
Let's assume that the
military is telling the truth,

00:25:16.817 --> 00:25:18.788
and that the crash was indeed

00:25:18.788 --> 00:25:21.345
a fancy project mobile weather balloon.

00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:24.268
That still does not change
the fact that the remains

00:25:24.268 --> 00:25:26.846
found at the crash site were, apparently,

00:25:26.846 --> 00:25:31.013
"rubber strips, tinfoil, a
rather tough paper and sticks,"

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:37.626
as stated by Brazel, in the
days after the story broke.

00:25:37.626 --> 00:25:39.546
The military has never said

00:25:39.546 --> 00:25:41.698
Brazel's description was innacurate,

00:25:41.698 --> 00:25:45.077
and you can even see these
coming items in the photo

00:25:45.077 --> 00:25:46.858
in Ramey's office.

00:25:46.858 --> 00:25:50.357
So, let's assume, these were
in fact, the items found

00:25:50.357 --> 00:25:53.498
at the crash site, and
forget about the allure

00:25:53.498 --> 00:25:56.686
of the seemingly high-tech
project Mogul balloon.

00:25:56.686 --> 00:26:00.797
With that in mind, let's
return to Major Jesse Marcel,

00:26:00.797 --> 00:26:02.826
the intelligence officer tasked

00:26:02.826 --> 00:26:04.917
with evaluating the crash site.

00:26:04.917 --> 00:26:07.877
Marcel pointed out he was well-versed in

00:26:07.877 --> 00:26:12.044
"all materials used in
aircraft and/or air travel,"

00:26:13.566 --> 00:26:16.428
and was also a graduate
from the Army's air force

00:26:16.428 --> 00:26:19.286
training command in radar technology.

00:26:19.286 --> 00:26:23.616
How could this man mistake
rubber strips and tin foil,

00:26:23.616 --> 00:26:26.788
per parts of an alien spaceship?

00:26:26.788 --> 00:26:31.057
Perhaps the answer lies in
a quote from Marcel himself.

00:26:31.057 --> 00:26:35.228
"All I could do is keep my
mouth shut and General Ramey

00:26:35.228 --> 00:26:37.958
was the one who told
the newsmen what it was,

00:26:37.958 --> 00:26:39.388
and to forget about it.

00:26:39.388 --> 00:26:42.666
It was nothing more than a
weather observation balloon.

00:26:42.666 --> 00:26:46.324
Of course, we both knew differently."

00:26:46.324 --> 00:26:49.158
First of, I'd like to tune my
own horn a little bit here,

00:26:49.158 --> 00:26:51.748
and I'm gonna take this hat off now.

00:26:51.748 --> 00:26:53.968
I did say that this would
be the most compelling case

00:26:53.968 --> 00:26:55.858
I've ever made, and that you, for once,

00:26:55.858 --> 00:26:57.938
may believe what I'm saying is true.

00:26:57.938 --> 00:26:59.208
Is that not correct?

00:26:59.208 --> 00:27:00.791
- You did say that.

00:27:01.629 --> 00:27:03.712
(laughs)

00:27:04.648 --> 00:27:06.317
It is the most compelling
case you've ever made,

00:27:06.317 --> 00:27:09.157
but also, you're in advantage
here because I already believe

00:27:09.157 --> 00:27:11.477
in extraterrestrials
and would not rule out

00:27:11.477 --> 00:27:13.298
that they have been to Earth.

00:27:13.298 --> 00:27:16.728
If that's your total
satisfaction, if that's what...

00:27:16.728 --> 00:27:18.368
Then great, you've done it, Ryan,

00:27:18.368 --> 00:27:21.818
you convinced me on a case
that I was already, you know,

00:27:21.818 --> 00:27:23.318
pretty lenient on.

00:27:24.977 --> 00:27:27.886
- Well, even though that's
dripping with sarcasm,

00:27:27.886 --> 00:27:29.806
it's definitely not genuine, I'll take it.

00:27:29.806 --> 00:27:32.722
Score one for the Bergara, case closed.

00:27:32.722 --> 00:27:35.212
Leave my house town dunce.

00:27:35.212 --> 00:27:36.045
- Town dunce?

00:27:36.045 --> 00:27:37.201
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:37.201 --> 00:27:39.420
- Because I now believe the
things that you believe?

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.292
- Oh shit.

00:27:40.292 --> 00:27:42.590
(laughs)

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:43.452
- If you say so.

00:27:43.452 --> 00:27:45.470
- [Ryan] In the end, no physical evidence

00:27:45.470 --> 00:27:49.420
of extraterrestrials or their
tech has ever been found.

00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:53.932
In fact, two archeological digs
took place on Foster Ranch,

00:27:53.932 --> 00:27:57.540
in search of physical
evidence and found nothing,

00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:01.157
only proof that there was indeed a crash.

00:28:01.157 --> 00:28:03.317
It's easy to see both sides,

00:28:03.317 --> 00:28:05.737
skeptics wonder how it's
possible that the military

00:28:05.737 --> 00:28:08.837
could have been so
absolute in their cleanup

00:28:08.837 --> 00:28:10.597
and subsequent cover-up.

00:28:10.597 --> 00:28:12.845
Believers wonder how it's
possible that there could be

00:28:12.845 --> 00:28:16.419
such consistent testimony
among hundreds of witnesses,

00:28:16.419 --> 00:28:19.957
down to small details of
something that, apparently,

00:28:19.957 --> 00:28:21.648
never happened.

00:28:21.648 --> 00:28:24.709
One thing is for sure,
what truly transpired

00:28:24.709 --> 00:28:27.557
near the sleepy town
of Roswell, New Mexico,

00:28:27.557 --> 00:28:29.309
will keep people debating.

00:28:29.309 --> 00:28:33.059
But for now, the answer
will remain unsolved.

00:28:34.509 --> 00:28:37.426
(mysterious music)
