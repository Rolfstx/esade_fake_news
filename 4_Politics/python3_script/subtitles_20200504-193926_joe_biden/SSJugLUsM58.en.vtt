00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.567
The President:
Madam Speaker,
Vice President Biden,

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:15.734
members of Congress, and the
American people: When I spoke

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:21.400
here last winter, this nation
was facing the worst economic

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.734
crisis since the
Great Depression.

00:00:24.734 --> 00:00:30.467
We were losing an average
of 700,000 jobs per month.

00:00:30.467 --> 00:00:32.500
Credit was frozen.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.867
And our financial system was
on the verge of collapse.

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:40.300
As any American who is still
looking for work or a way to pay

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.533
their bills will
tell you, we are by no

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:45.533
means out of the woods.

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:51.633
A full and vibrant recovery
is still many months away.

00:00:51.633 --> 00:00:55.800
And I will not let up until
those Americans who seek jobs

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.800
can find them --

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:20.166
(applause)

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:23.100
-- until those businesses that
seek capital and credit can

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.633
thrive; until all
responsible homeowners can

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:31.333
stay in their homes.
That is our ultimate goal.

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.033
But thanks to the bold and
decisive action we've taken

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:38.100
since January, I can stand here
with confidence and say that we

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.266
have pulled this economy
back from the brink.

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:58.667
(applause)

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:01.300
I want to thank the
members of this body for your

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.967
efforts and your support in
these last several months,

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:08.400
and especially those who've
taken the difficult votes that

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.767
have put us on a
path to recovery.

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:13.467
I also want to thank the
American people for their

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:18.066
patience and resolve during this
trying time for our nation.

00:02:18.066 --> 00:02:22.100
But we did not come here
just to clean up crises.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.300
We came here to build a future.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.633
(applause)

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:31.967
So tonight, I return
to speak to all of you about an

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:35.233
issue that is central to that
future -- and that is

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:38.066
the issue of health care.

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:40.600
I am not the first President
to take up this cause,

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.967
but I am determined
to be the last.

00:02:42.967 --> 00:03:02.567
(applause)

00:03:02.567 --> 00:03:06.734
It has now been nearly
a century since Theodore

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:10.567
Roosevelt first called
for health care reform.

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:13.333
And ever since, nearly every
President and Congress,

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:16.066
whether Democrat or Republican,
has attempted to meet this

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:18.400
challenge in some way.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.734
A bill for comprehensive health
reform was first introduced by

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:27.000
John Dingell Sr. in 1943.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.867
Sixty-five years later, his son
continues to introduce that same

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:32.400
bill at the beginning
of each session.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:50.800
(applause)

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.300
Our collective failure
to meet this challenge

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.000
-- year after year,
decade after decade --

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.166
has led us to
the breaking point.

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:03.367
Everyone understands the
extraordinary hardships that are

00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:07.333
placed on the uninsured, who
live every day just one accident

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:10.500
or illness away from bankruptcy.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.300
These are not primarily
people on welfare.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.900
These are middle-class
Americans.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.533
Some can't get
insurance on the job.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:20.000
Others are self-employed,
and can't afford it,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.367
since buying insurance on your
own costs you three times as

00:04:22.367 --> 00:04:26.266
much as the coverage you
get from your employer.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.367
Many other Americans who are
willing and able to pay are

00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:33.033
still denied insurance due to
previous illnesses or conditions

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:36.000
that insurance companies
decide are too risky

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.133
or too expensive to cover.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:45.700
We are the only democracy -- the
only advanced democracy on Earth

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.767
-- the only wealthy nation --
that allows such hardship for

00:04:49.767 --> 00:04:51.967
millions of its people.

00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:55.066
There are now more than 30
million American citizens who

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:57.367
cannot get coverage.

00:04:57.367 --> 00:05:00.767
In just a two-year period, one
in every three Americans goes

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:04.367
without health care
coverage at some point.

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:08.734
And every day, 14,000
Americans lose their coverage.

00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:12.400
In other words, it
can happen to anyone.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.700
But the problem that plagues the
health care system is not just a

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.166
problem for the uninsured.

00:05:19.166 --> 00:05:22.600
Those who do have insurance have
never had less security and

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.600
stability than they do today.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.567
More and more Americans worry
that if you move, lose your job,

00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:33.133
or change your job, you'll lose
your health insurance too.

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:35.266
More and more Americans
pay their premiums,

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:37.734
only to discover that their
insurance company has dropped

00:05:37.734 --> 00:05:40.433
their coverage
when they get sick,

00:05:40.433 --> 00:05:42.066
or won't pay the
full cost of care.

00:05:42.066 --> 00:05:44.900
It happens every day.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.367
One man from Illinois lost
his coverage in the middle of

00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:51.066
chemotherapy because his insurer
found that he hadn't reported

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:54.300
gallstones that he
didn't even know about.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.467
They delayed his treatment,
and he died because of it.

00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:02.600
Another woman from Texas was
about to get a double mastectomy

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.967
when her insurance company
canceled her policy because she

00:06:04.967 --> 00:06:08.133
forgot to declare
a case of acne.

00:06:08.133 --> 00:06:10.767
By the time she had her
insurance reinstated,

00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:15.133
her breast cancer had
more than doubled in size.

00:06:15.133 --> 00:06:18.233
That is heart-breaking,
it is wrong, and no one should

00:06:18.233 --> 00:06:20.200
be treated that way in the
United States of America.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:45.066
(applause)

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:48.333
Then there's the
problem of rising cost.

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:51.734
We spend one and a half times
more per person on health care

00:06:51.734 --> 00:06:56.867
than any other country, but we
aren't any healthier for it.

00:06:56.867 --> 00:06:59.633
This is one of the reasons that
insurance premiums have gone up

00:06:59.633 --> 00:07:02.600
three times faster than wages.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.000
It's why so many employers --
especially small businesses --

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.066
are forcing their employees
to pay more for insurance,

00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:13.100
or are dropping their
coverage entirely.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:15.700
It's why so many aspiring
entrepreneurs cannot afford to

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.033
open a business in
the first place,

00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:21.033
and why American businesses that
compete internationally -- like

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:23.900
our automakers -- are
at a huge disadvantage.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.500
And it's why those of us with
health insurance are also paying

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.433
a hidden and growing tax for
those without it -- about $1,000

00:07:31.433 --> 00:07:36.800
per year that pays for
somebody else's emergency room

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.333
and charitable care.

00:07:39.333 --> 00:07:41.900
Finally, our health care system
is placing an unsustainable

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.567
burden on taxpayers.

00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:46.834
When health care costs
grow at the rate they have,

00:07:46.834 --> 00:07:48.667
it puts greater
pressure on programs

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.467
like Medicare and Medicaid.

00:07:51.467 --> 00:07:55.100
If we do nothing to slow
these skyrocketing costs,

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.066
we will eventually be spending
more on Medicare and Medicaid

00:07:59.066 --> 00:08:03.533
than every other government
program combined.

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:07.900
Put simply, our health care
problem is our deficit problem.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.834
Nothing else even
comes close. Nothing else.

00:08:12.834 --> 00:08:19.867
(applause)

00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:27.700
Now, these are the
facts. Nobody disputes them.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.934
We know we must
reform this system.

00:08:31.934 --> 00:08:34.700
The question is how.

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.834
There are those on the left who
believe that the only way to fix

00:08:38.834 --> 00:08:41.834
the system is through a single-payer system like Canada's --

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:43.066
(applause)

00:08:43.066 --> 00:08:46.367
-- where we would
severely restrict the

00:08:46.367 --> 00:08:48.667
private insurance market and
have the government provide

00:08:48.667 --> 00:08:51.200
coverage for everybody.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.367
On the right, there are those
who argue that we should end

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.900
employer-based systems and
leave individuals to buy health

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.500
insurance on their own.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:05.266
I've said -- I have to say that
there are arguments to be made

00:09:05.266 --> 00:09:07.667
for both these approaches.

00:09:07.667 --> 00:09:11.900
But either one would represent a
radical shift that would disrupt

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:16.400
the health care most
people currently have.

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.133
Since health care represents
one-sixth of our economy,

00:09:20.133 --> 00:09:23.367
I believe it makes more sense to
build on what works and fix what

00:09:23.367 --> 00:09:26.266
doesn't, rather than
try to build an entirely

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:27.600
new system from scratch.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:44.433
(applause)

00:09:44.433 --> 00:09:46.600
And that is precisely
what those of you in Congress

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:50.266
have tried to do over
the past several months.

00:09:50.266 --> 00:09:52.200
During that time, we've
seen Washington at its

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:56.567
best and at its worst.

00:09:56.567 --> 00:10:00.166
We've seen many in this chamber
work tirelessly for the better

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:02.867
part of this year to
offer thoughtful ideas

00:10:02.867 --> 00:10:05.200
about how to achieve reform.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:07.867
Of the five committees
asked to develop bills,

00:10:07.867 --> 00:10:11.000
four have completed their work,
and the Senate Finance Committee

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.166
announced today that it will
move forward next week.

00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:18.133
That has never happened before.

00:10:18.133 --> 00:10:20.834
Our overall efforts have been
supported by an unprecedented

00:10:20.834 --> 00:10:25.433
coalition of doctors and nurses;
hospitals, seniors' groups,

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:27.533
and even drug
companies -- many of whom

00:10:27.533 --> 00:10:32.066
opposed reform in the past.

00:10:32.066 --> 00:10:35.600
And there is agreement in this
chamber on about 80 percent of

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.467
what needs to be done, putting
us closer to the goal of reform

00:10:39.467 --> 00:10:42.567
than we have ever been.

00:10:42.567 --> 00:10:47.333
But what we've also seen in
these last months is the same

00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:51.000
partisan spectacle that only
hardens the disdain many

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.166
Americans have towards
their own government.

00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:57.467
Instead of honest debate,
we've seen scare tactics.

00:10:57.467 --> 00:11:01.967
Some have dug into unyielding
ideological camps that offer no

00:11:01.967 --> 00:11:05.100
hope of compromise.

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:08.233
Too many have used this as an
opportunity to score short-term

00:11:08.233 --> 00:11:11.000
political points, even if
it robs the country of our

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.266
opportunity to solve
a long-term challenge.

00:11:14.266 --> 00:11:17.333
And out of this blizzard of
charges and counter-charges,

00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:20.300
confusion has reigned.

00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:24.734
Well, the time for
bickering is over.

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:28.300
The time for games has passed.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.133
(applause)

00:11:29.133 --> 00:11:31.066
Now is the season for action.

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:35.100
Now is when we must bring the
best ideas of both parties

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:38.967
together, and show the American
people that we can still do what

00:11:38.967 --> 00:11:40.800
we were sent here to do.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:44.066
Now is the time to
deliver on health care.

00:11:44.066 --> 00:11:48.800
Now is the time to
deliver on health care.

00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:54.300
The plan I'm announcing tonight
would meet three basic goals.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.800
It will provide more
security and stability to

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.133
those who have health insurance.

00:12:00.133 --> 00:12:03.600
It will provide insurance
for those who don't.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.467
And it will slow the growth
of health care costs for our

00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:10.500
families, our businesses,
and our government.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:17.233
(applause)

00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:20.934
It's a plan that asks
everyone to take responsibility

00:12:20.934 --> 00:12:22.667
for meeting this challenge
-- not just government,

00:12:22.667 --> 00:12:24.967
not just insurance companies,
but everybody including

00:12:24.967 --> 00:12:27.867
employers and individuals.

00:12:27.867 --> 00:12:30.133
And it's a plan that
incorporates ideas from senators

00:12:30.133 --> 00:12:35.233
and congressmen, from Democrats
and Republicans -- and yes,

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:37.133
from some of my
opponents in both the

00:12:37.133 --> 00:12:41.934
primary and general election.

00:12:41.934 --> 00:12:44.633
Here are the details
that every American needs

00:12:44.633 --> 00:12:47.533
to know about this plan.

00:12:47.533 --> 00:12:51.133
First, if you are among the
hundreds of millions of

00:12:51.133 --> 00:12:53.433
Americans who already have
health insurance through your

00:12:53.433 --> 00:12:59.734
job, or Medicare, or
Medicaid, or the VA,

00:12:59.734 --> 00:13:03.333
nothing in this plan will
require you or your employer to

00:13:03.333 --> 00:13:05.266
change the coverage or
the doctor you have.

00:13:05.266 --> 00:13:11.000
(applause)

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.333
Let me repeat this:
Nothing in our plan requires you

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:20.800
to change what you have.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.100
What this plan will do
is make the insurance you

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:27.266
have work better for you.

00:13:27.266 --> 00:13:29.800
Under this plan, it will be
against the law for insurance

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:31.800
companies to deny
you coverage because

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.200
of a preexisting condition.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:53.133
(applause)

00:13:53.133 --> 00:13:54.767
As soon as I sign this bill,

00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:57.633
it will be against the law for
insurance companies to drop your

00:13:57.633 --> 00:14:00.767
coverage when you get
sick or water it down

00:14:00.767 --> 00:14:02.200
when you need it the most.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:12.066
(applause)

00:14:12.066 --> 00:14:14.333
They will no longer be
able to place some arbitrary

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:17.266
cap on the amount of coverage
you can receive in a given year

00:14:17.266 --> 00:14:18.834
or in a lifetime.

00:14:18.834 --> 00:14:26.734
(applause)

00:14:26.734 --> 00:14:29.433
We will place a limit
on how much you can be charged

00:14:29.433 --> 00:14:31.667
for out-of-pocket expenses,
because in the United States of

00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:34.734
America, no one should go
broke because they get sick.

00:14:34.734 --> 00:14:49.200
(applause)

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.400
And insurance companies
will be required to

00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:55.900
cover, with no extra charge,
routine checkups and preventive

00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.667
care, like mammograms and
colonoscopies --

00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:58.333
(applause)

00:14:58.333 --> 00:15:01.333
-- because there's no reason we
shouldn't be catching diseases

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:05.200
like breast cancer and colon
cancer before they get worse.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.266
That makes sense, it saves
money, and it saves lives.

00:15:08.266 --> 00:15:17.567
(applause)

00:15:17.567 --> 00:15:19.867
Now, that's what
Americans who have health

00:15:19.867 --> 00:15:22.633
insurance can expect
from this plan -- more

00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:25.834
security and more stability.

00:15:25.834 --> 00:15:29.000
Now, if you're one of the tens
of millions of Americans who

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.667
don't currently have
health insurance,

00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:35.200
the second part of this plan
will finally offer you quality,

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.000
affordable choices.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.767
(applause)

00:15:40.767 --> 00:15:44.767
If you lose your job
or you change your job,

00:15:44.767 --> 00:15:46.367
you'll be able to get coverage.

00:15:46.367 --> 00:15:48.800
If you strike out on your own
and start a small business,

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.166
you'll be able to get coverage.

00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:54.233
We'll do this by creating a
new insurance exchange -- a

00:15:54.233 --> 00:15:57.567
marketplace where individuals
and small businesses will be

00:15:57.567 --> 00:16:01.500
able to shop for health
insurance at competitive prices.

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.033
Insurance companies will have an
incentive to participate in this

00:16:04.033 --> 00:16:06.734
exchange because it
lets them compete for

00:16:06.734 --> 00:16:09.166
millions of new customers.

00:16:09.166 --> 00:16:11.734
As one big group, these
customers will have greater

00:16:11.734 --> 00:16:14.166
leverage to bargain with the
insurance companies for better

00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:17.000
prices and quality coverage.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.300
This is how large
companies and government

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:20.667
employees get
affordable insurance.

00:16:20.667 --> 00:16:22.133
It's how everyone
in this Congress

00:16:22.133 --> 00:16:23.433
gets affordable insurance.

00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:25.934
And it's time to give every
American the same opportunity

00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:27.400
that we give ourselves.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:44.667
(applause)

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:46.900
Now, for those individuals
and small businesses

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:50.500
who still can't afford the
lower-priced insurance available

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.266
in the exchange, we'll
provide tax credits,

00:16:53.266 --> 00:16:56.033
the size of which will
be based on your need.

00:16:56.033 --> 00:16:58.834
And all insurance companies
that want access to this new

00:16:58.834 --> 00:17:01.467
marketplace will have
to abide by the consumer

00:17:01.467 --> 00:17:03.800
protections I already mentioned.

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.000
This exchange will take
effect in four years,

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.467
which will give us
time to do it right.

00:17:09.467 --> 00:17:11.967
In the meantime, for those
Americans who can't get

00:17:11.967 --> 00:17:15.400
insurance today because they
have preexisting medical

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.667
conditions, we will immediately
offer low-cost coverage that

00:17:18.667 --> 00:17:21.367
will protect you
against financial ruin if

00:17:21.367 --> 00:17:22.633
you become eriously ill.

00:17:22.633 --> 00:17:23.500
(applause)

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.600
This was a good idea
when Senator John McCain

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.567
proposed it in the campaign,
it's a good idea now,

00:17:29.567 --> 00:17:31.000
and we should all embrace it.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:47.667
(applause)

00:17:47.667 --> 00:17:54.433
Now, even if we provide these
affordable options, there may be

00:17:54.433 --> 00:17:58.233
those -- especially the
young and the healthy --

00:17:58.233 --> 00:18:02.033
who still want to take the
risk and go without coverage.

00:18:02.033 --> 00:18:04.967
There may still be companies
that refuse to do right by their

00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:08.934
workers by giving them coverage.

00:18:08.934 --> 00:18:11.633
The problem is, such
irresponsible behavior costs all

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:14.266
the rest of us money.

00:18:14.266 --> 00:18:17.800
If there are affordable options
and people still don't sign up

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.900
for health insurance, it means
we pay for these people's

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.867
expensive emergency room visits.

00:18:23.867 --> 00:18:27.100
If some businesses don't
provide workers health care,

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:30.100
it forces the rest of us to pick
up the tab when their workers

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:34.133
get sick, and gives those
businesses an unfair advantage

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:36.000
over their competitors.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.934
And unless everybody
does their part,

00:18:37.934 --> 00:18:41.834
many of the insurance reforms
we seek -- especially requiring

00:18:41.834 --> 00:18:44.800
insurance companies to cover
preexisting conditions -- just

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.100
can't be achieved.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:49.734
And that's why under my plan,
individuals will be required to

00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:52.633
carry basic health insurance --
just as most states require you

00:18:52.633 --> 00:18:54.233
to carry auto insurance.

00:18:54.233 --> 00:19:02.467
(applause)

00:19:02.467 --> 00:19:05.233
Likewise -- likewise,
businesses will be required to

00:19:05.233 --> 00:19:07.800
either offer their
workers health care,

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:11.333
or chip in to help cover
the cost of their workers.

00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:14.233
There will be a hardship waiver
for those individuals who still

00:19:14.233 --> 00:19:19.600
can't afford coverage, and 95
percent of all small businesses,

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:22.667
because of their size
and narrow profit margin,

00:19:22.667 --> 00:19:24.834
would be exempt from
these requirements.

00:19:24.834 --> 00:19:26.433
(applause)

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:31.133
But we can't have large
businesses and individuals

00:19:31.133 --> 00:19:34.734
who can afford coverage
game the system by avoiding

00:19:34.734 --> 00:19:38.133
responsibility to themselves
or their employees.

00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:41.066
Improving our health
care system only works if

00:19:41.066 --> 00:19:44.066
everybody does their part.

00:19:44.066 --> 00:19:46.200
And while there remain some
significant details to be ironed

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.900
out, I believe --

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:51.000
(laughter)

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.500
-- I believe a broad
consensus exists

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.767
for the aspects of the plan
I just outlined: consumer

00:19:56.767 --> 00:19:59.333
protections for
those with insurance,

00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:02.133
an exchange that allows
individuals and small businesses

00:20:02.133 --> 00:20:06.100
to purchase affordable coverage,
and a requirement that people

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.433
who can afford
insurance get insurance.

00:20:09.433 --> 00:20:12.600
And I have no doubt that these
reforms would greatly benefit

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.200
Americans from
all walks of life,

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:18.100
as well as the
economy as a whole.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.700
Still, given all the
misinformation that's been

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.300
spread over the past few months,
I realize - (applause) -- I

00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:29.767
realize that many Americans have
grown nervous about reform.

00:20:29.767 --> 00:20:33.333
So tonight I want to address
some of the key controversies

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:37.066
that are still out there.

00:20:37.066 --> 00:20:40.800
Some of people's concerns have
grown out of bogus claims spread

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:46.734
by those whose only agenda is
to kill reform at any cost.

00:20:46.734 --> 00:20:50.033
The best example is the claim
made not just by radio and cable

00:20:50.033 --> 00:20:53.967
talk show hosts, but by
prominent politicians,

00:20:53.967 --> 00:20:57.367
that we plan to set up panels of
bureaucrats with the power to

00:20:57.367 --> 00:21:01.133
kill off senior citizens.

00:21:01.133 --> 00:21:04.734
Now, such a charge would be
laughable if it weren't so

00:21:04.734 --> 00:21:06.967
cynical and irresponsible.

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:09.600
It is a lie, plain and simple.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:33.700
(applause)

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:35.133
There are also those
who claim that our reform

00:21:35.133 --> 00:21:38.700
efforts would insure
illegal immigrants.

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:41.700
This, too, is false.

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:46.266
The reforms -- the reforms I'm
proposing would not apply to

00:21:46.266 --> 00:21:47.800
those who are here illegally.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.133
Audience Member:
You lie!

00:21:49.133 --> 00:21:52.533
(Boos!)

00:21:52.533 --> 00:21:54.467
The President:
It's not true.

00:21:54.467 --> 00:21:59.066
And one more misunderstanding I
want to clear up -- under our

00:21:59.066 --> 00:22:04.567
plan, no federal dollars will
be used to fund abortions,

00:22:04.567 --> 00:22:07.867
and federal conscience
laws will remain in place.

00:22:07.867 --> 00:22:14.600
(applause)

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.700
Now, my health care
proposal has also been attacked

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.900
by some who oppose reform as a
"government takeover" of the

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:25.467
entire health care system.

00:22:25.467 --> 00:22:29.200
As proof, critics point to a
provision in our plan that

00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.667
allows the uninsured and small
businesses to choose a publicly

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:36.667
sponsored insurance option,
administered by the government

00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:39.000
just like Medicaid or Medicare.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:39.934
(applause)

00:22:39.934 --> 00:22:44.800
So let me set the
record straight here.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:49.266
My guiding principle
is, and always has been,

00:22:49.266 --> 00:22:52.734
that consumers do better when
there is choice and competition.

00:22:52.734 --> 00:22:53.700
That's how the market works.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:23:13.433
(applause)

00:23:13.433 --> 00:23:16.600
Unfortunately, in 34 states,

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.233
75 percent of the insurance
market is controlled

00:23:20.233 --> 00:23:23.500
by five or fewer companies.

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:29.934
In Alabama, almost 90 percent is
controlled by just one company.

00:23:29.934 --> 00:23:32.100
And without competition,
the price of insurance goes

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.734
up and quality goes down.

00:23:34.734 --> 00:23:36.633
And it makes it easier for
insurance companies to treat

00:23:36.633 --> 00:23:40.467
their customers badly -- by
cherry-picking the healthiest

00:23:40.467 --> 00:23:43.967
individuals and trying
to drop the sickest,

00:23:43.967 --> 00:23:46.967
by overcharging small businesses
who have no leverage,

00:23:46.967 --> 00:23:49.633
and by jacking up rates.

00:23:49.633 --> 00:23:53.233
Insurance executives don't do
this because they're bad people;

00:23:53.233 --> 00:23:55.567
they do it because
it's profitable.

00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:57.867
As one former insurance
executive testified before

00:23:57.867 --> 00:24:02.533
Congress, insurance companies
are not only encouraged to find

00:24:02.533 --> 00:24:07.600
reasons to drop the seriously
ill, they are rewarded for it.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:11.200
All of this is in service
of meeting what this former

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.600
executive called "Wall Street's
relentless profit expectations."

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:19.367
Now, I have no interest in
putting insurance companies out

00:24:19.367 --> 00:24:23.500
of business. They provide
a legitimate service,

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.767
and employ a lot of our
friends and neighbors.

00:24:26.767 --> 00:24:28.633
I just want to hold
them accountable.

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:47.967
(applause)

00:24:47.967 --> 00:24:49.166
And the insurance
reforms that I've already

00:24:49.166 --> 00:24:52.467
mentioned would do just that.

00:24:52.467 --> 00:24:55.200
But an additional step we can
take to keep insurance companies

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.467
honest is by making a
not-for-profit public option

00:24:58.467 --> 00:25:00.266
available in the
insurance exchange.

00:25:00.266 --> 00:25:04.934
(applause)

00:25:04.934 --> 00:25:13.934
Now, let me be clear.
Let me be clear.

00:25:13.934 --> 00:25:18.700
It would only be an option for
those who don't have insurance.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:22.066
No one would be
forced to choose it,

00:25:22.066 --> 00:25:26.200
and it would not impact those of
you who already have insurance.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.967
In fact, based on Congressional
Budget Office estimates,

00:25:29.967 --> 00:25:31.600
we believe that
less than 5 percent of

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.467
Americans would sign up.

00:25:35.467 --> 00:25:37.800
Despite all this, the insurance
companies and their allies don't

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.433
like this idea.

00:25:39.433 --> 00:25:42.100
They argue that these private
companies can't fairly compete

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:43.500
with the government.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:48.000
And they'd be right if taxpayers
were subsidizing this public

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.300
insurance option.
But they won't be.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.500
I've insisted that like any
private insurance company,

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.867
the public insurance option
would have to be self-sufficient

00:25:57.867 --> 00:26:00.734
and rely on the
premiums it collects.

00:26:00.734 --> 00:26:04.166
But by avoiding some of the
overhead that gets eaten up at

00:26:04.166 --> 00:26:07.300
private companies by profits and
excessive administrative costs

00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.600
and executive salaries, it
could provide a good deal for

00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:14.400
consumers, and would also keep
pressure on private insurers to

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.967
keep their policies affordable
and treat their customers

00:26:16.967 --> 00:26:20.934
better, the same way public
colleges and universities

00:26:20.934 --> 00:26:23.867
provide additional choice and
competition to students without

00:26:23.867 --> 00:26:26.100
in any way inhibiting
a vibrant system of

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.900
private colleges
and universities.

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.433
(applause)

00:26:30.433 --> 00:26:43.066
Now, it is -- it's
worth noting that a strong

00:26:43.066 --> 00:26:46.233
majority of Americans still
favor a public insurance option

00:26:46.233 --> 00:26:48.867
of the sort I've
proposed tonight.

00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:54.500
But its impact shouldn't be
exaggerated -- by the left or

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:58.700
the right or the media.

00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:03.000
It is only one part of my plan,
and shouldn't be used as a handy

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000
excuse for the usual Washington
ideological battles.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.967
To my progressive friends,
I would remind you that for

00:27:08.967 --> 00:27:13.033
decades, the driving idea behind
reform has been to end insurance

00:27:13.033 --> 00:27:16.834
company abuses and make coverage
available for those without it.

00:27:16.834 --> 00:27:19.500
(applause)

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.700
The public option --
the public option is only a

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.066
means to that end -- and we
should remain open to other

00:27:26.066 --> 00:27:29.967
ideas that accomplish
our ultimate goal.

00:27:29.967 --> 00:27:33.667
And to my Republican friends, I
say that rather than making wild

00:27:33.667 --> 00:27:37.066
claims about a government
takeover of health care,

00:27:37.066 --> 00:27:39.066
we should work together to
address any legitimate

00:27:39.066 --> 00:27:40.333
concerns you may have.

00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:56.834
(applause)

00:27:56.834 --> 00:27:58.900
For example -- for example,

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.300
some have suggested that the
public option go into effect

00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:04.333
only in those markets where
insurance companies are not

00:28:04.333 --> 00:28:06.967
providing affordable policies.

00:28:06.967 --> 00:28:10.667
Others have proposed a co-op or
another non-profit entity to

00:28:10.667 --> 00:28:12.767
administer the plan.

00:28:12.767 --> 00:28:16.333
These are all constructive
ideas worth exploring.

00:28:16.333 --> 00:28:18.700
But I will not back down on
the basic principle that if

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.967
Americans can't find
affordable coverage,

00:28:20.967 --> 00:28:23.100
we will provide
you with a choice.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:38.500
(applause)

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:44.200
And I will make sure that
no government bureaucrat or

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.633
insurance company bureaucrat
gets between you and

00:28:46.633 --> 00:28:48.066
the care that you need.

00:28:48.066 --> 00:29:02.166
(applause)

00:29:02.166 --> 00:29:05.867
Finally, let me discuss
an issue that is a great

00:29:05.867 --> 00:29:09.033
concern to me, to
members of this chamber,

00:29:09.033 --> 00:29:13.767
and to the public -- and that's
how we pay for this plan.

00:29:13.767 --> 00:29:16.266
And here's what
you need to know.

00:29:16.266 --> 00:29:20.834
First, I will not sign a plan
that adds one dime to our

00:29:20.834 --> 00:29:23.734
deficits -- either
now or in the future.

00:29:23.734 --> 00:29:37.367
(applause)

00:29:37.367 --> 00:29:41.834
I will not sign it if it
adds one dime to the deficit,

00:29:41.834 --> 00:29:45.000
now or in the future, period.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:47.500
And to prove that I'm serious,
there will be a provision in

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:50.133
this plan that requires us to
come forward with more spending

00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:54.233
cuts if the savings we
promised don't materialize.

00:29:54.233 --> 00:29:58.934
(applause)

00:29:58.934 --> 00:30:05.300
Now, part of the reason
I faced a trillion-dollar

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.266
deficit when I walked in the
door of the White House is

00:30:07.266 --> 00:30:09.967
because too many initiatives
over the last decade were not

00:30:09.967 --> 00:30:13.800
paid for -- from the Iraq war
to tax breaks for the wealthy.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:29.934
(applause)

00:30:29.934 --> 00:30:33.967
I will not make that same
mistake with health care.

00:30:33.967 --> 00:30:37.867
Second, we've estimated that
most of this plan can be paid

00:30:37.867 --> 00:30:42.500
for by finding savings within
the existing health care system,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.867
a system that is currently
full of waste and abuse.

00:30:46.867 --> 00:30:50.133
Right now, too much of the
hard-earned savings and tax

00:30:50.133 --> 00:30:54.166
dollars we spend on health care
don't make us any healthier.

00:30:54.166 --> 00:30:56.500
That's not my judgment --
it's the judgment of medical

00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.433
professionals
across this country.

00:30:59.433 --> 00:31:04.233
And this is also true when it
comes to Medicare and Medicaid.

00:31:04.233 --> 00:31:07.300
In fact, I want to speak
directly to seniors for a

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:10.367
moment, because Medicare is
another issue that's been

00:31:10.367 --> 00:31:13.033
subjected to demagoguery
and distortion during

00:31:13.033 --> 00:31:16.233
the course of this debate.

00:31:16.233 --> 00:31:19.533
More than four decades ago,
this nation stood up for the

00:31:19.533 --> 00:31:22.467
principle that after a
lifetime of hard work,

00:31:22.467 --> 00:31:25.066
our seniors should not be left
to struggle with a pile of

00:31:25.066 --> 00:31:27.867
medical bills in
their later years.

00:31:27.867 --> 00:31:30.166
That's how Medicare was born.

00:31:30.166 --> 00:31:34.066
And it remains a sacred trust
that must be passed down from

00:31:34.066 --> 00:31:35.900
one generation to the next.

00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:43.133
(applause)

00:31:43.133 --> 00:31:46.233
And that is why not a
dollar of the Medicare trust

00:31:46.233 --> 00:31:49.300
fund will be used to
pay for this plan.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:53.633
(applause)

00:31:53.633 --> 00:31:56.667
The only thing this plan
would eliminate is the

00:31:56.667 --> 00:31:59.867
hundreds of billions of
dollars in waste and fraud,

00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:03.500
as well as unwarranted subsidies
in Medicare that go to insurance

00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:08.000
companies -- subsidies that do
everything to pad their profits

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.100
but don't improve
the care of seniors.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.934
And we will also create an
independent commission of

00:32:14.934 --> 00:32:18.767
doctors and medical experts
charged with identifying more

00:32:18.767 --> 00:32:20.066
waste in the years ahead.

00:32:20.066 --> 00:32:25.200
(applause)

00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.233
Now, these steps will
ensure that you -- America's

00:32:28.233 --> 00:32:33.800
seniors -- get the benefits
you've been promised.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:37.867
They will ensure that Medicare
is there for future generations.

00:32:37.867 --> 00:32:40.700
And we can use some of the
savings to fill the gap in

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.734
coverage that forces too many
seniors to pay thousands of

00:32:43.734 --> 00:32:47.734
dollars a year out of their own
pockets for prescription drugs.

00:32:47.734 --> 00:33:02.734
(applause)

00:33:02.734 --> 00:33:05.767
That's what this
plan will do for you.

00:33:05.767 --> 00:33:08.800
So don't pay attention to those
scary stories about how your

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.800
benefits will be cut, especially
since some of the same folks who

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:16.133
are spreading these tall tales
have fought against Medicare in

00:33:16.133 --> 00:33:19.300
the past and just this year
supported a budget that would

00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:21.533
essentially have
turned Medicare into a

00:33:21.533 --> 00:33:23.734
privatized voucher program.

00:33:23.734 --> 00:33:25.100
That will not
happen on my watch.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:26.467
I will protect Medicare.

00:33:26.467 --> 00:33:42.400
(applause)

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.667
Now, because Medicare is
such a big part of the health

00:33:45.667 --> 00:33:50.233
care system, making the program
more efficient can help usher in

00:33:50.233 --> 00:33:52.500
changes in the way we deliver
health care that can reduce

00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:54.633
costs for everybody.

00:33:54.633 --> 00:33:58.300
We have long known that some
places -- like the Intermountain

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:03.333
Healthcare in Utah or the
Geisinger Health System in rural

00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:06.133
Pennsylvania -- offer
high-quality care

00:34:06.133 --> 00:34:08.166
at costs below average.

00:34:08.166 --> 00:34:11.500
So the commission can help
encourage the adoption of these

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:14.133
common-sense best practices
by doctors and medical

00:34:14.133 --> 00:34:17.133
professionals throughout the
system -- everything from

00:34:17.133 --> 00:34:19.734
reducing hospital infection
rates to encouraging better

00:34:19.734 --> 00:34:23.500
coordination between
teams of doctors.

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.166
Reducing the waste and
inefficiency in Medicare and

00:34:26.166 --> 00:34:29.367
Medicaid will pay for
most of this plan.

00:34:29.367 --> 00:34:32.767
(applause)

00:34:32.767 --> 00:34:35.934
Now, much of the rest
would be paid for with revenues

00:34:35.934 --> 00:34:38.834
from the very same drug and
insurance companies that stand

00:34:38.834 --> 00:34:43.033
to benefit from tens of
millions of new customers.

00:34:43.033 --> 00:34:47.400
And this reform will charge
insurance companies a fee for

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.400
their most expensive policies,
which will encourage them to

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:54.133
provide greater value for the
money -- an idea which has the

00:34:54.133 --> 00:34:57.700
support of Democratic
and Republican experts.

00:34:57.700 --> 00:34:59.767
And according to
these same experts,

00:34:59.767 --> 00:35:03.367
this modest change could help
hold down the cost of health

00:35:03.367 --> 00:35:07.467
care for all of us
in the long run.

00:35:07.467 --> 00:35:11.433
Now, finally, many in this
chamber -- particularly on the

00:35:11.433 --> 00:35:14.433
Republican side of the aisle
-- have long insisted that

00:35:14.433 --> 00:35:17.433
reforming our medical
malpractice laws can help bring

00:35:17.433 --> 00:35:20.033
down the cost of health care.

00:35:20.033 --> 00:35:35.834
(applause)

00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:45.600
Now -- there you go.
There you go.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.033
Now, I don't believe malpractice
reform is a silver bullet,

00:35:50.033 --> 00:35:52.400
but I've talked to enough
doctors to know that defensive

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.600
medicine may be contributing
to unnecessary costs.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.133
(applause)

00:35:58.133 --> 00:36:01.500
So I'm proposing that
we move forward on a range of

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:05.266
ideas about how to put patient
safety first and let doctors

00:36:05.266 --> 00:36:06.900
focus on practicing medicine.

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.433
(applause)

00:36:08.433 --> 00:36:11.800
I know that the Bush
administration considered

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.233
authorizing demonstration
projects in individual states

00:36:15.233 --> 00:36:17.433
to test these ideas.

00:36:17.433 --> 00:36:20.600
I think it's a good idea, and
I'm directing my Secretary of

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.934
Health and Human
Services to move forward

00:36:22.934 --> 00:36:24.900
on this initiative today.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:35.400
(applause)

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.433
Now, add it all up, and
the plan I'm proposing will

00:36:38.433 --> 00:36:46.000
cost around $900 billion over 10
years -- less than we have spent

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.734
on the Iraq and
Afghanistan wars,

00:36:48.734 --> 00:36:52.300
and less than the tax cuts for
the wealthiest few Americans

00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:53.667
that Congress passed
at the beginning

00:36:53.667 --> 00:36:55.600
of the previous administration.

00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:08.700
(applause)

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:11.600
Now, most of these
costs will be paid for with

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:16.033
money already being spent -- but
spent badly -- in the existing

00:37:16.033 --> 00:37:17.867
health care system.

00:37:17.867 --> 00:37:20.367
The plan will not
add to our deficit.

00:37:20.367 --> 00:37:22.667
The middle class will
realize greater security,

00:37:22.667 --> 00:37:24.400
not higher taxes.

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.400
And if we are able to slow the
growth of health care costs by

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:32.900
just one-tenth of 1 percent each
year -- one-tenth of 1 percent

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:37.233
-- it will actually reduce
the deficit by $4 trillion

00:37:37.233 --> 00:37:40.367
over the long term.

00:37:40.367 --> 00:37:43.000
Now, this is the
plan I'm proposing.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.500
It's a plan that incorporates
ideas from many of the people in

00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.700
this room tonight --
Democrats and Republicans.

00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:51.266
And I will continue
to seek common ground

00:37:51.266 --> 00:37:53.200
in the weeks ahead.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:57.333
If you come to me with a
serious set of proposals,

00:37:57.333 --> 00:38:03.433
I will be there to listen.
My door is always open.

00:38:03.433 --> 00:38:08.934
But know this: I will not waste
time with those who have made

00:38:08.934 --> 00:38:11.934
the calculation that it's
better politics to kill this

00:38:11.934 --> 00:38:13.800
plan than to improve it.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:30.000
(applause)

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.266
I won't stand by while
the special interests use

00:38:33.266 --> 00:38:36.667
the same old tactics to keep
things exactly the way they are.

00:38:36.667 --> 00:38:41.867
If you misrepresent what's in
this plan, we will call you out.

00:38:41.867 --> 00:38:44.367
(applause)

00:38:44.367 --> 00:38:47.934
And I will not -- and
I will not accept the status quo

00:38:47.934 --> 00:38:53.767
as a solution. Not
this time. Not now.

00:38:53.767 --> 00:38:58.967
Everyone in this room knows what
will happen if we do nothing.

00:38:58.967 --> 00:39:03.367
Our deficit will grow. More
families will go bankrupt.

00:39:03.367 --> 00:39:06.200
More businesses will close.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.166
More Americans will lose their
coverage when they are sick and

00:39:09.166 --> 00:39:10.834
need it the most.

00:39:10.834 --> 00:39:17.433
And more will die as a result.
We know these things to be true.

00:39:17.433 --> 00:39:20.800
That is why we cannot fail.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:23.867
Because there are too many
Americans counting on us to

00:39:23.867 --> 00:39:28.533
succeed -- the ones
who suffer silently,

00:39:28.533 --> 00:39:32.367
and the ones who shared their
stories with us at town halls,

00:39:32.367 --> 00:39:37.934
in e-mails, and in letters.

00:39:37.934 --> 00:39:41.500
I received one of those
letters a few days ago.

00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:46.400
It was from our beloved friend
and colleague, Ted Kennedy.

00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:49.900
He had written it back in May,
shortly after he was told that

00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.734
his illness was terminal.

00:39:52.734 --> 00:39:56.567
He asked that it be
delivered upon his death.

00:39:56.567 --> 00:40:01.533
In it, he spoke about what a
happy time his last months were,

00:40:01.533 --> 00:40:07.367
thanks to the love and support
of family and friends, his wife,

00:40:07.367 --> 00:40:11.200
Vicki, his amazing children,
who are all here tonight.

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.734
And he expressed confidence that
this would be the year that

00:40:13.734 --> 00:40:18.166
health care reform -- "that
great unfinished business of our

00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:23.033
society," he called it
-- would finally pass.

00:40:23.033 --> 00:40:26.467
He repeated the truth that
health care is decisive for our

00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:30.333
future prosperity, but he also
reminded me that "it concerns

00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:33.900
more than material things."

00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:39.700
"What we face," he wrote,
"is above all a moral issue;

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.867
at stake are not just
the details of policy,

00:40:42.867 --> 00:40:46.600
but fundamental principles
of social justice and the

00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:51.266
character of our country."

00:40:51.266 --> 00:40:54.967
I've thought about that phrase
quite a bit in recent days --

00:40:54.967 --> 00:40:59.333
the character of our country.

00:40:59.333 --> 00:41:02.767
One of the unique and wonderful
things about America has always

00:41:02.767 --> 00:41:06.266
been our self-reliance,
our rugged individualism,

00:41:06.266 --> 00:41:09.467
our fierce defense of
freedom and our healthy

00:41:09.467 --> 00:41:12.400
skepticism of government.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:15.533
And figuring out the appropriate
size and role of government has

00:41:15.533 --> 00:41:19.033
always been a source
of rigorous and, yes,

00:41:19.033 --> 00:41:23.967
sometimes angry debate.
That's our history.

00:41:23.967 --> 00:41:25.934
For some of Ted
Kennedy's critics,

00:41:25.934 --> 00:41:28.133
his brand of
liberalism represented an

00:41:28.133 --> 00:41:31.266
affront to American liberty.

00:41:31.266 --> 00:41:33.834
In their minds, his passion
for universal health care was

00:41:33.834 --> 00:41:38.800
nothing more than a
passion for big government.

00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:43.266
But those of us who knew Teddy
and worked with him here --

00:41:43.266 --> 00:41:46.233
people of both parties --
know that what drove

00:41:46.233 --> 00:41:49.200
him was something more.

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:53.166
His friend Orrin Hatch
-- he knows that.

00:41:53.166 --> 00:41:56.467
They worked together to provide
children with health insurance.

00:41:56.467 --> 00:41:59.166
His friend John
McCain knows that.

00:41:59.166 --> 00:42:02.233
They worked together on a
Patient's Bill of Rights.

00:42:02.233 --> 00:42:04.667
His friend Chuck
Grassley knows that.

00:42:04.667 --> 00:42:06.700
They worked together to
provide health care to

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:09.500
children with disabilities.

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.700
On issues like these, Ted
Kennedy's passion was born not

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:18.867
of some rigid ideology,
but of his own experience.

00:42:18.867 --> 00:42:20.834
It was the experience
of having two children

00:42:20.834 --> 00:42:23.633
stricken with cancer.

00:42:23.633 --> 00:42:28.000
He never forgot the sheer terror
and helplessness that any parent

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.300
feels when a child
is badly sick.

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:34.300
And he was able to imagine
what it must be like for those

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:38.033
without insurance, what it would
be like to have to say to a wife

00:42:38.033 --> 00:42:41.533
or a child or an aging parent,
there is something that could

00:42:41.533 --> 00:42:47.967
make you better, but I
just can't afford it.

00:42:47.967 --> 00:42:52.533
That large-heartedness -- that
concern and regard for the

00:42:52.533 --> 00:42:57.100
plight of others -- is
not a partisan feeling.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:01.100
It's not a Republican
or a Democratic feeling.

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.567
It, too, is part of the American
character -- our ability to

00:43:05.567 --> 00:43:09.166
stand in other people's shoes; a
recognition that we are all in

00:43:09.166 --> 00:43:12.834
this together, and when fortune
turns against one of us,

00:43:12.834 --> 00:43:16.367
others are there to
lend a helping hand;

00:43:16.367 --> 00:43:19.500
a belief that in this country,
hard work and responsibility

00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:22.467
should be rewarded by some
measure of security and fair

00:43:22.467 --> 00:43:27.066
play; and an acknowledgment that
sometimes government has to step

00:43:27.066 --> 00:43:32.033
in to help deliver
on that promise.

00:43:32.033 --> 00:43:36.400
This has always been the
history of our progress.

00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:40.533
In 1935, when over half of
our seniors could not support

00:43:40.533 --> 00:43:43.800
themselves and millions had
seen their savings wiped away,

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.600
there were those who argued that
Social Security would lead to

00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:50.400
socialism, but the men and
women of Congress stood fast,

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.433
and we are all
the better for it.

00:43:53.433 --> 00:43:57.300
In 1965, when some argued
that Medicare represented a

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.934
government takeover
of health care,

00:43:59.934 --> 00:44:04.233
members of Congress --
Democrats and Republicans --

00:44:04.233 --> 00:44:06.734
did not back down.

00:44:06.734 --> 00:44:10.166
They joined together so that all
of us could enter our golden

00:44:10.166 --> 00:44:14.867
years with some
basic peace of mind.

00:44:14.867 --> 00:44:18.967
You see, our predecessors
understood that government could

00:44:18.967 --> 00:44:22.400
not, and should not,
solve every problem.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.333
They understood that there are
instances when the gains in

00:44:25.333 --> 00:44:28.333
security from government
action are not worth the added

00:44:28.333 --> 00:44:31.734
constraints on our freedom.

00:44:31.734 --> 00:44:34.600
But they also understood
that the danger of too much

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.033
government is matched by
the perils of too little;

00:44:38.033 --> 00:44:40.100
that without the leavening
hand of wise policy,

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:44.100
markets can crash, monopolies
can stifle competition,

00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.367
the vulnerable can be exploited.

00:44:48.367 --> 00:44:51.166
And they knew that when
any government measure,

00:44:51.166 --> 00:44:53.567
no matter how carefully
crafted or beneficial,

00:44:53.567 --> 00:44:57.867
is subject to scorn; when any
efforts to help people in need

00:44:57.867 --> 00:45:02.066
are attacked as un-American;
when facts and reason are thrown

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:05.567
overboard and only timidity
passes for wisdom,

00:45:05.567 --> 00:45:08.367
and we can no longer even engage
in a civil conversation with

00:45:08.367 --> 00:45:12.033
each other over the things that
truly matter -- that at that

00:45:12.033 --> 00:45:14.166
point we don't merely
lose our capacity

00:45:14.166 --> 00:45:16.400
to solve big challenges.

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:20.867
We lose something
essential about ourselves.

00:45:20.867 --> 00:45:26.467
That was true then.
It remains true today.

00:45:26.467 --> 00:45:29.700
I understand how difficult this
health care debate has been.

00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:32.600
I know that many in this country
are deeply skeptical that

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:35.700
government is
looking out for them.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.834
I understand that the
politically safe move would be

00:45:37.834 --> 00:45:42.567
to kick the can further down the
road -- to defer reform one more

00:45:42.567 --> 00:45:46.700
year, or one more
election, or one more term.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.734
But that is not what
the moment calls for.

00:45:49.734 --> 00:45:52.200
That's not what we
came here to do.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:55.000
We did not come to
fear the future.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.266
We came here to shape it.

00:45:57.266 --> 00:46:00.800
I still believe we can
act even when it's hard.

00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:14.934
(applause)

00:46:14.934 --> 00:46:23.066
I still believe -- I
still believe that we

00:46:23.066 --> 00:46:25.333
can act when it's hard.

00:46:25.333 --> 00:46:29.100
I still believe we can replace
acrimony with civility,

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.900
and gridlock with progress.

00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:36.500
I still believe we can do great
things and that here and now we

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:41.233
will meet history's test.
Because that's who we are.

00:46:41.233 --> 00:46:47.233
That is our calling.
That is our character.

00:46:47.233 --> 00:46:49.333
Thank you, God bless you,
and may God bless the

00:46:49.333 --> 00:46:51.200
United States of America.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:47:04.967
(applause)
