00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.920
 Scrapwood Challenge Scrapwood Challenge 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.960
 It's junk, it's crap, it's firewood 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.180
 But some of the wood is good 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.180
 I will start picking and preparing wood 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.120
 Very much like I do in most challenges scrap wood 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.980
 And while I'm setting up that wood 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.520
 I'll tell you about the project 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.800
 I'm going to try and make a bladeless fan 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.700
 I'm not very sure how it will go 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.480
 I am not confident at all 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.780
 But it must be a fun project in either direction 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.700
 I think it definitely lives up to the challenge 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.140
 Scrap wood challenge 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.900
 And by the way for those still asking 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.460
 Wood is camphor Laurel 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.580
 It was given to me by local business 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.720
 That makes chopping boards 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.540
 I'm going to make a fan with a segmented shift 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.280
 I only did once before 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.260
 That was when he came back 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.060
 That one turns out good 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.720
 So hopefully this one will work just fine too 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.700
 Hopefully, the fan is actually working 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.400
 If not then it will end 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.380
 An interesting looking decor 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.820
 You do not need to make three different sized rings 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.660
 And I use an online calculator 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.540
 To work out the dimensions of each piece 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.380
 For cutting slices I will use my wedgie sled 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.780
 On a table saw 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.100
 It also does a very fine job 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.060
 These small rings will make a fan base 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.200
 And now I need to cut more segments 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.820
 For larger coupler rings 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.480
 Base rings have 6 sectors 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.000
 But other episodes have 18 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.960
 Even after changing the angle on the sled 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.180
 I did a test with some old pine 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.700
 To make sure it's accurate 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.260
 Before cutting the rest of the sectors 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.200
 I am using this ring made of bungee cord 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.030
 Just to hold the pieces together 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.060
 While I put a few rubber bands on 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.100
 I just turned these plywood discs on a lathe 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.780
 And they're going to have to mount the rings on a lathe 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.660
 But now I'm going to use it 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.280
 To help clamp the rings together 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.880
 While glue sets 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.500
 As expected the rings move around 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.840
 When pressing 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.680
 But I keep checking and modifying 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.200
 So they take from each other 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.260
 Please do not tell me about using salt to prevent them from moving 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.460
 It's also easy enough to do this without 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.580
 And I will provide salt for my dinner 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.180
 Now I'm ready to start turning 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.069
 But I'll quickly tell you what these pieces are 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:06.300
 And how it will work 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.800
 We hope how it will work anyway 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.900
 This piece is at the bottom of the base 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.380
 Which will feature a small fan 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.400
 That would push the air up and in this episode here 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.880
 This is the outer ring 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.720
 This one here would be a good fit inside 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.900
 And that will be the inner ring 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.780
 Between the two there will be a void 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.500
 And as the air pushes up 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.580
 This void fills 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:25.560
 It'll get forced out of the hatch in the back 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.560
 And the air must come through 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.900
 We must have a fan 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.060
 I wished anyway 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.580
 But at the moment I am not that confident 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:34.580
 But we'll give it a go 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.120
 One ends are not finished 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.768
 A bit of lip left on there 

00:07:04.768 --> 00:07:07.480
 But this is fine because we still need to set this goal 

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.080
 For other episodes to contain to 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.020
 Now you don't need to make templates 

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.240
 To help form loops 

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.100
 These voids give some good airflow 

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.740
 This is just outside turning on 

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.380
 Now it starts to get tricky 

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:07.760
 I've got to convert inside 

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.580
 I need to use this template here 

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.300
 And if you look I've got to turn back in behind here 

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:15.820
 I have no way to do this 

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.040
 So I'm going to remove some material 

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.320
 Then I'm going to reverse this on chuck 

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.440
 And work from the other side 

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.520
 I have removed most of the materials 

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.780
 Go back to the template go 

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.680
 You can see that the front part of the rim 

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.680
 It is thicker than the rest of it 

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.600
 So I've already turned it down to the right thickness 

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:14.300
 Now I need to get in there 

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.360
 And do this a little bit tapered bit here 

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.640
 And to do that I'm going to use this diamond tool 

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:38.880
 All of that is done away from the inside by this back door 

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.400
 Now that he's handed over 

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.240
 We can see exactly where I've got from the last little hollow 

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.220
 And just to show you here 

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:38.600
 It's this little inside of an outer ring 

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.980
 It's the next day 

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.940
 The inner ring is mounted on a lathe 

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.740
 Ready to convert 

00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.920
 You do not need to get a good fit between the two episodes 

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.100
 But only to that end where they join 

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.180
 Where this is an edge 

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:51.900
 To this end less when it gets in shape 

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.720
 I can start tapering this now 

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.500
 And I can keep testing it 

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:58.240
 And get this nice ring fit tight up there up there 

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:02.160
 Then I can use my template and finish the shape after that 

00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:24.740
 The inner ring is very deep 

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.940
 It's the lowest level on the outer ring 

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:30.620
 So I just need to take off all around about 10mm 

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:14.600
 I am sure with a good push 

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.880
 That fit every way 

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.309
 So I will call it done 

00:14:17.309 --> 00:14:20.100
 And I'll start forming it 

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.100
 Slot on the back is good looking 

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:02.200
 It seems even and where the air will come from 

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:04.200
 If he goes to plan 

00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.100
 I'm just converting the interface for the two episodes 

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.400
 With them hold with that tight fit 

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.000
 I think it should work just fine 

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.480
 I will not gluing the two rings together 

00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:39.400
 So I will still be able to reach the fan later 

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.580
 Because of that I am sanding the edge of the inner ring 

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.560
 Which will leave the setback details 

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:46.740
 Instead of trying to get them flush 

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.560
 I love it, and I figured it looked better anyway 

00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:01.720
 Removing hot glue was not so hard at all 

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.040
 It only took a few minutes 

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.740
 Now I need to match the rings to the base 

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.880
 I can use SketchUp to work from where to make the cuts 

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:25.560
 I did this by two crossed cylinders 

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.160
 Then I took a base 

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.360
 Unfolded and then print it to a range 

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.080
 I was just going to go for it with trial and error 

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.700
 But this method will get me shut straight 

00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:12.320
 I was going to cut this off with a handle saw 

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.880
 Because I did not have the right size hole saw 

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.760
 Or a little Forstner 

00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:18.800
 Then I remembered that I've got a really cheap set of hole saws 

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:20.880
 The one there was the perfect size 

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.760
 It also started to dig it 

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.620
 I realized that I'm going to go through 

00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.200
 Part of the edge inside 

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.380
 I did not want to do that 

00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:33.780
 So by rocking it she managed 

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.540
 And it developed fine 

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:57.580
 The fan will need to be able to draw air into it 

00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:00.040
 So the next thing is to cut some air intake holes 

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.240
 At base 

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.260
 I could easily drill a series of holes 

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:05.600
 And that would work but I think it's for a look 

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.000
 I played with many different ideas 

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.780
 Including this fake cartoon-up 

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:12.570
 I've decided I want to make a series of slots 

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:14.220
 I think that sounds great 

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.100
 But it is not the easiest thing to do 

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.560
 I've even made this jig 

00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:19.040
 It took about an hour to make 

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.880
 We hope it works 

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.260
 I use two touches of hot glue to hold the guide in place 

00:21:23.309 --> 00:21:24.860
 I made a mistake 

00:21:24.860 --> 00:21:26.520
 The ends of those slots do not line up 

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.220
 That was my mistake, I was neglected 

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.740
 I put this block here 

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.600
 For the purpose of setting up a base against 

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.500
 And I didn't do that it was more than a few millimeters 

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:37.920
 I can repeat that end now it's the right set 

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.500
 On the other side luckily this is the back of the fan 

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.400
 So I can glue a little bit in there 

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.120
 And try to arrange it up 

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.040
 I bought this fan only for use in this project 

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.960
 And for its size it has good specifications 

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.760
 As far as I can see 

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:30.220
 But if it does not work well enough 

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:32.920
 We will consider using a computer fan instead 

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.380
 Stacks of reviews were good 

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.460
 And because I am very useless in electricity 

00:22:36.460 --> 00:22:37.980
 This was an easy way to go 

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:39.500
 She has everything I need 

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.840
 The fan speed is set and it's also rechargeable 

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.720
 All I need to do is take parts 

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:47.760
 And rearrange them inside my fan 

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:51.200
 Which I think is something so that I can do 

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.000
 First I cut and make a plate with buttons 

00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.760
 There wasn't enough material to make it rectangular 

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.440
 I had made a new painting 

00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.060
 But I think it looked fine as it was 

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:40.980
 On the sides to open and slightly tapered 

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:42.660
 So it's well installed in there 

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.440
 Epoxy will be used to fix it in position 

00:23:50.820 --> 00:23:52.940
 I made a plywood disc for the base 

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:54.800
 I screwed up the battery holder to that 

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.420
 Put some hair on the bottom 

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.000
 And extended the wires 

00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:03.040
 I glued it a few small blocks inside the base 

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.820
 Screw the disk to 

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.020
 Now I attack fan housing 

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.340
 To get rid of any items I don't need 

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.360
 Leave the slice to select 

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.860
 It's a bit of a mess but I didn't sort it up after that 

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:20.240
 To test it out I'm using blue tack 

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.760
 Top rings held on 

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.360
 And make a good chop 

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.840
 Acting really well 

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.280
 So it is not a disaster 

00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.340
 Although I could hear the fans struggling to pull the air in 

00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:42.580
 So I decided to get rid of the base 

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.160
 With battery holder 

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:46.500
 Put some feet on the bass lift 

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.620
 And allow more air from under 

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.480
 The battery was unnecessary 

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:56.400
 And I'm not sure I have used it anyway 

00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:10.960
 I did not go back and chamfered the holes 

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.240
 And retool the screws later 

00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:18.660
 The circuit board can do with housing 

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:19.880
 To keep dust 

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.380
 Plus there are a couple of bulbs in this flash 

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.700
 It will hide those too 

00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:26.120
 The best way is likely to be with a 3D printer 

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:28.200
 I don't have one but I'm thinking about something 

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.800
 I will probably make it later 

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.560
 This is definitely a big improvement 

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.120
 Now that more air can get a fan 

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.160
 That project was really fun 

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.540
 With much problem solving 

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.400
 It worked which was a bonus 

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.179
 I think it looks great as well 

00:27:52.179 --> 00:27:54.920
 It can be improved with a stronger fan 

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.280
 And maybe this is something you will play with in the future 

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.240
 But I am happy that it works 

00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.639
 Hope you enjoyed the video 

00:28:00.639 --> 00:28:02.580
 If done please like and subscribe 

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:03.620
 thanks for watching 

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.160
 And I'll see you on the next one
