 [Glenn] Matte Ahoy, did you realize that 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.840
 Solar is the most abundant energy source on Earth? 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.770
 By switching to more solar powered objects, 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.240
 You reduce harmful emissions 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.980
 Be launched into your environment, 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.690
 How wonderful to say that you are harnessing the power of stars. 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.339
 I am Glenn and I will have a leader who rules today's topic. 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.460
 Let's take a look at 10 solar powered boats 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.019
 Yachts are making a big splash 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.160
 In the future of the water trip. 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.080
 - [Woman] No. 10. 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.300

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.500
 With Arkup Houseboat. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.920
 Play Noah and bring your animal or human companions too. 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.190
 This amazing boat can sail in the open seas 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.190
 At seven miles an hour. 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.449
 Or to be stabilized by hydraulic substrates 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.970
 You can rest on the bay or port of your choice. 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.339
 Worried about the potential of hurricanes? 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:04.059
 Arkup was created to carry the fourth category 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.330
 Hurricane winds reach 155 miles per hour. 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.910
 This contemporary Titanic design is two stories, 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.540
 Sitting approximately 4,350 square feet. 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.020
 Energy is collected from a wide range of solar panels, 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.460
 While rain water can be collected and purified for drinking. 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.080
 Enjoy the surface of the sun, which cliffs into the water 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.170
 And experience natural light all the time 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.500
 With floor to ceiling windows. 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.410
 Each of the four bedrooms has an attached bathroom 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.460

 Looking to launch this potentially 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.140
 As are eco resorts as well. 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.030
 You can expect this one to be a beautiful penny, 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.440
 But the good ones are usually. 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.140

 With loud engine noise. 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.030
 This solar beauty can cover 100 miles 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.890
 With electricity alone it is guaranteed to hear 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.900
 A calming voice for the sea and all its marvels. 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.900
 Its cruising speed rests at rest 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.209

 And you get a top speed of 46 mph. 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.510
 This solar powered tractor is an excellent choice for hunters 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.599

 So that you can focus on more than serenity 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.800

 With the purpose of studying more life in the oceans. 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.650
 Generated by solar energy, wind, and wave force, 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.670
 It is intended to carry up to 22 people. 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.290
 If we're lucky enough to see this final production, 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.019
 We may be able to get it a more personal look 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.960
 In ferocious sharks or little seahorse under the sea. 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.720
 Much mystery still lies deep in the ocean 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.080
 With this future ocean station, we hope you'll solve puzzles, 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.380
 Is there really a sea dragon? 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.220
 This ship is intended to have 12 decks, 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.200
 Six of them will be under water, 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.920
 Used for a variety of experiments and oceanography. 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.240
 It rings stepping into the New Atlantic era.

 So you can find perfect quarters of the captain. 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.680
 Wide searchlights and flush deck openings 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.310
 Allow too much natural light. 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.890
 You have freedom of control 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.370

 To keep the crew on their flight 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:20.110
 Induction cooktop is a nice touch, 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.480
 Does not require burning fuel. 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.730

 With high solar energy efficiency. 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.780
 Also competing in solar energy one sports competition, 

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.640
 This boat is getting ready for some recognition. 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.560
 You can also donate to the University of Twente team 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.490
 So they can achieve solar panels 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.840
 With 35% more efficient. 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.420
 Undoubtedly, the Twente solar boat 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.700
 It helps to prove this reliable renewable energy 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.700
 And a cool villain. 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.520
 - [Woman] Number Four. 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.080
 - [Glenn] This water demon is created from the team 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.330
 At the University of Applied Sciences in Germany. 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.630
 The solar panels are mounted to the carbon fiber body. 

00:06:57.630 --> 00:07:00.610
 Sunderbird made for daredevil 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.250
 The desire to break through the waves. 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.120
 It is interesting that you can drive this one with your feet 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.120
 So your hands are free 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.020
 To a wave when crossing the finish line 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.080
 Or free to give your competitor a middle finger. 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.440
 It's your call. 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:16.080
 With a top speed of 19 mph, 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.420
 What I am saying is a respectable way to cut through the waves. 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.830
 We hope this one develops and spreads awareness 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.460
 How to use clean solar energy. 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.940
 - [Woman] Number three. 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.500

 To race on the water with only the power of the sun. 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.750
 This boat covered solar panel can reach a top speed 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.980
 From 21 miles an hour on waves. 

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.240
 Although it may not look sharp 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.960
 As its gas-powered counterparts, 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.580
 The beauty of this Dutch sun boat is more environmentally friendly. 

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.260
 Racing has become easier with lighter and more efficient panels. 

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.400

 Hydrogen wind turbines produced from sea water 

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.480
 Or a sail glider. 

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.639
 Jerome Delavos says: "We want to make people dream. 

00:10:02.639 --> 00:10:05.440
 "To raise awareness, not to prove that humans can live 

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.819
 "In harmony with nature and that the battle against 

00:10:07.819 --> 00:10:09.829
