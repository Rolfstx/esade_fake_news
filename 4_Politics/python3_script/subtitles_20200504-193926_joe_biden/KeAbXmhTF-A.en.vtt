00:00:02.468 --> 00:00:03.770
-While the White House is
engulfed in scandal and chaos,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.905
it may seem like President Trump
is getting nothing done,

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.373
but that's not necessarily
the case.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:09.808
For example, he's already
signed an executive order

00:00:09.808 --> 00:00:11.010
on religious liberty.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.178
So we decided to take a break

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:13.613
from the breaking news
of the day

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:16.015
and look at Trump's evolving
views on religion, faith,

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.817
and the separation
of church and state.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.585
It's time for "The Check In."

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:23.055
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:24.957
Now that he's president,

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:27.093
Trump is realizing just
how difficult the job is,

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.528
and he doesn't have much
to show for it.

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:29.796
His health care bill failed,

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.097
there's constant infighting

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:32.565
and staff changes
in the White House,

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.334
and of course
the Russia investigation

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:35.968
continues to loom over him.

00:00:35.968 --> 00:00:37.637
And it's often
in dark times like this

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.338
that a man will turn to God.

00:00:39.338 --> 00:00:43.175
-Take care of the people
God put into your life.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:47.146
We want our children to know
the blessings of God.

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:52.718
Have a great life and love your
country and love your God, okay?

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:56.789 line:0%
In America,
we don't worship government.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.425 line:0%
We worship God.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.093
-Oh, don't worry.

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:02.862
Nobody is worshipping
government.

00:01:02.862 --> 00:01:04.063
[ Laughter ]

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:06.466
I didn't take three hours
at the DMV

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:10.169
because I had to push through
throngs of worshippers.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:14.073
In fact, I heard the Lord's name
taken in vain a lot.

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.142
Now, admittedly, Trump did talk

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:17.810
about God a lot
during the campaign,

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.780
but what he had to say about God
was a real mixed bag.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.883 line:0%
-I don't bring God into that
picture. I don't.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:27.854 line:0%
Why do I have to repent, why do
I have to ask for forgiveness,

00:01:27.854 --> 00:01:30.055 line:0%
if you're not making mistakes?

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.591 line:0%
I say God is the ultimate.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:33.426
You know, you look at this --
you look at this incredible --

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:35.061
here we are in
the Pacific Ocean.

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:36.195
How did I ever own this?

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:37.897
I bought it 15 years ago.

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:40.266
I made one of the great deals
they say ever.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.769
-We love the Bible.
It's the best.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:46.105
We love "The Art of the Deal,"

00:01:46.105 --> 00:01:49.709
but the Bible is far, far,
far superior, right? Yes.

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:52.445
-Not only is the Bible better
than "The Art of the Deal,"

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.247
it's also the opposite.

00:01:55.247 --> 00:01:56.749
The only thing
they have in common

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:59.419
is that Trump has never read
either of them.

00:01:59.419 --> 00:02:01.120
[ Laughter ]

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.389
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.126
Now, one moment
that best illustrated

00:02:06.126 --> 00:02:08.094
Trump's unfamiliarity
with the Bible

00:02:08.094 --> 00:02:10.029
was when he referred to
Second Corinthians

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:11.731
during a speech
at Liberty University

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.299
but called it something else.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.668
-i hear this is a major theme
right here,

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.570
but Two Corinthians, right,

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.507
Two Corinthians 3:17,
that's the whole ball game.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.543
-Two Corinthians,

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.845
like it's a sequel
to an action movie.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:30.316
"Who can forget the famous line
from 'Two Fast Two Corinthians'

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.918
when Vin Diesel said to Jesus,

00:02:32.918 --> 00:02:36.356
'Hey, long hair,
pop the clutch and let's ride.'"

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:37.823
[ Laughter ]

00:02:37.823 --> 00:02:43.963
And then there's the question
of Trump's church attendance.

00:02:43.963 --> 00:02:45.631
Based on where
he spends his Sundays,

00:02:45.631 --> 00:02:47.400
it's likely
his most common prayer is,

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.802
"God, please don't let me hit it
in the water."

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:51.938
And according to a Politico
article from April,

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.572
aside from Trump attending
church services

00:02:53.572 --> 00:02:55.507
on inauguration day,
making an appearance

00:02:55.507 --> 00:02:56.676
at the National
Prayer Breakfast,

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:57.977
and going to service
on Easter...

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.449
And that makes sense,
because Trump would hate church.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.086
It's an hour of people talking
about someone other than him.

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.355
"Is this whole thing"--

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.959
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.995
"Is this whole thing
gonna be about Jesus?

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:19.265
Did you know he had zero hotels?

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.134
True story.

00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:23.936
On the day he was born, he could
not get a hotel reservation."

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:27.440
[ Laughter ]

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.807
"It's sad."

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:33.412
But still,
Trump is trying to take steps

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:35.281
to please his evangelical base.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.115
In May,
on the National Day of Prayer,

00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:39.185
Trumped signed an executive
order on what he called

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:41.487
the promotion of free speech
and religious liberty,

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:44.456
which would allow churches and
other religious organizations

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:46.225
to become more
politically active.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:47.994
And it provides
regulatory relief

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:49.796
for organizations
that object to provisions

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.331
in the Affordable Care Act,

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.232
like including
contraception coverage

00:03:53.232 --> 00:03:54.633
in workers' health plans.

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:57.303
In fact, during Trump's speech
about the executive order,

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:58.971
he invited a group of nuns

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:01.007
who refused to abide
by this original rule

00:04:01.007 --> 00:04:03.209
and had taken their case
all the way to the Supreme Court

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.276
up to the podium.

00:04:04.276 --> 00:04:05.845
-Come on up here, Sister.

00:04:05.845 --> 00:04:07.714
Come on up. Right?

00:04:07.714 --> 00:04:10.183
Come on up.

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:14.319
[ Applause ]

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:16.055
-Pleased to meet you.

00:04:16.055 --> 00:04:17.490
-Congratulations.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.957
They sort of just won a lawsuit.

00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:20.459
That was pretty good.

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.728
That's a good way of doing it,
huh?

00:04:22.728 --> 00:04:25.398
Where are your lawyers?
Stand up. Come on. Stand up.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:28.567
Good job.

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:31.370
You mind if I use your lawyers
for various things?

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.773
I could use
some good lawyers too.

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:37.243
-Only Trump would compliment
nuns on their record in court.

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:38.678
[ Laughter ]

00:04:38.678 --> 00:04:41.547
"God would have been very proud
of how litigious you are."

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:43.415
Such a weird sequencing, too.

00:04:43.415 --> 00:04:44.750
Like, "Give it up for the nuns,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.654
but also, the real heroes,
their legal team."

00:04:48.654 --> 00:04:50.956
And the woman you see behind
Trump during that speech

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:54.193
is his spiritual advisor,
friend, and pastor, Paula White.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:55.995
Now, Paula White
is a televangelist

00:04:55.995 --> 00:04:57.663
who has known Trump
for 15 years.

00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:58.831
He even invited her

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.066
to deliver the invocation
on inauguration day.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:02.835
Now, on the surface,
it may not seem like

00:05:02.835 --> 00:05:04.437
she and Trump
have that much in common,

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.438
but like Trump
she's been divorced twice

00:05:06.438 --> 00:05:07.406
and married three times,

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:09.208
she's been under investigation,

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.544
and her former church has filed
for bankruptcy protection.

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:12.879
The difference between these two

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.548
is like night
and later that night.

00:05:15.548 --> 00:05:16.816
[ Laughter ]

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:18.083
Now, White has often
been criticized

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:19.185
for telling followers that

00:05:19.185 --> 00:05:20.886
if they donate money
to her ministry,

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:22.655
they will be
made wealthy by God.

00:05:22.655 --> 00:05:23.723
In fact, reports say that..

00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:32.531
And reports say that White
has benefited handsomely

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.366
from preaching
that kind of gospel.

00:05:34.366 --> 00:05:36.135
-They live like rock stars

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:40.372
with huge mansions, private
jets, and fancy cars.

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:42.675
Their lifestyles are so lavish,

00:05:42.675 --> 00:05:44.877
six of them
have been investigated

00:05:44.877 --> 00:05:46.412
by the U.S. Senate.

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:48.014
Like Paula White.

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:50.283 line:0%
-I've laid out the gospel
very clearly,

00:05:50.283 --> 00:05:52.651 line:0%
and I know that Donald is saved.

00:05:52.651 --> 00:05:55.054 line:0%
-Critics say she preaches
the prosperity gospel,

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:58.657 line:0%
emphasizing material riches
over spiritual ones.

00:05:58.657 --> 00:06:02.562 line:0%
-Click on that donation button
by minimizing the screen.

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:04.864 line:0%
-Do you tell them that
if they give to you,

00:06:04.864 --> 00:06:07.366 line:0%
they will get financial riches
from God?

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:10.336 line:0%
-Am I gonna say --
I have probably said that.

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:13.272 line:0%
Okay, here's when I go my
50-year-old self

00:06:13.272 --> 00:06:16.442 line:0%
wouldn't do what my 20-
or 30- or 40-year-old self did.

00:06:16.442 --> 00:06:18.944
-"To be fair, my 50-year-old
self doesn't have to

00:06:18.944 --> 00:06:21.780
because my 40-year-old self
made a killing."

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.916
Now, currently White leads

00:06:23.916 --> 00:06:25.818
the New Destiny Christian Center
in Florida.

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:26.886
Reports say that...

00:06:36.728 --> 00:06:38.765
And that kind of preaching
was on full display

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.766
during this sermon she gave
in 2012

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:42.868
to a predominantly
African-American audience

00:06:42.868 --> 00:06:45.438
on learning to appreciate
their significant others.

00:06:45.438 --> 00:06:47.472
And it's a little hard to watch.

00:06:47.472 --> 00:06:49.341 line:0%
-She don't have to do anything.

00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:50.709 line:0%
So every time she does,

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:53.679 line:0%
"Baby, there ain't nobody
that can do like what you do.

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:56.749 line:0%
This is the best Kraft Macaroni

00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:58.451 line:0%

00:06:58.451 --> 00:07:01.520 line:0%
You gon' wonder why
somebody else in five years

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.888 line:0%
has your husband.

00:07:02.888 --> 00:07:04.623 line:0%
You didn't appreciate him.

00:07:04.623 --> 00:07:09.428 line:0%
You let his secretary bring him
food at lunchtime.

00:07:09.428 --> 00:07:12.131 line:0%
You let her bring him coffee
in the morning.

00:07:12.131 --> 00:07:15.234 line:0%
You let all the other women
tell him how good he smells.

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:16.402 line:0%
And they do.

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:17.936 line:0%
They tell him
how good he smells.

00:07:17.936 --> 00:07:19.905 line:0%
They bring him his lunch
on time.

00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:22.675 line:0%
And you don't even notice him
when he comes in,

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:25.844 line:0%
and you still got your
funky curlers in your hair

00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:28.213 line:0%
and spinach
coming out of your teeth,

00:07:28.213 --> 00:07:32.151
and yo' bunny slippers on
and wonder what's going on?

00:07:32.151 --> 00:07:33.986
Are you serious?

00:07:33.986 --> 00:07:36.088
-Whoa.

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:38.224
It's hard to tell
what's more offensive,

00:07:38.224 --> 00:07:41.060
the insinuation that it's your
fault your husband left you

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.629
or the appropriation of
black idiomatic speech.

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.629
Amber?

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:46.732
-It's the black stuff.

00:07:46.732 --> 00:07:48.667
[ Laughter ]

00:07:48.667 --> 00:07:51.437
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:57.376
-Are you sure?

00:07:57.376 --> 00:07:59.078
-Yeah.

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:00.513
[ Laughter ]

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:02.315
-That was gonna be my guess.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:06.652
Again, this is a woman
who's referred to

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:11.290
as Donald Trump's pastor
and spiritual adviser.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.993
One member of a religious
watchdog organization put it...

00:08:17.095 --> 00:08:19.431
Many evangelicals
are actually uncomfortable

00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:21.534
with Paula White's presence
and her gospel.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:23.336
But that's not stopping
evangelicals

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.604
from basking in their access
to the president.

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:27.539
Who could forget this photo
of religious leaders

00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:29.842
with their hands on Trump's back
praying for him?

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.410
At least I think
they're praying for him.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.312
It could just as easily
be an exorcism.

00:08:34.312 --> 00:08:35.881
"I am the best demon.

00:08:35.881 --> 00:08:39.351
I have the highest ratings,
everyone says so!"

00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:43.455
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:08:43.455 --> 00:08:46.525
Remember Trump's meandering
answer about God

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:48.794
and his real-estate deals
and the Pacific Ocean?

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.663
Well, that interview was
conducted by this guy,

00:08:50.663 --> 00:08:52.531
the Christian
Broadcasting Network's

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:54.833
chief political correspondent
David Brody,

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:56.268
who's co-authoring a new book

00:08:56.268 --> 00:08:57.837
on the spiritual life
of President Trump.

00:08:57.837 --> 00:08:58.971
The title of that book is...

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:06.045
It'll be the first book
printed entirely on a Chiclet.

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.614
[ Laughter ]

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:12.150
So Trump's surrounding himself

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.353
with people who seem to
prioritize wealth over faith

00:09:14.353 --> 00:09:16.154
while using his friends
to convince others

00:09:16.154 --> 00:09:18.023
that he himself
is a man of deep faith.

00:09:18.023 --> 00:09:19.324
In the words of Paula White...

00:09:19.324 --> 00:09:20.693
-Are you serious?

00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:22.861
-This has been "The Check In."

00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:24.363
[ Cheers and applause ]
