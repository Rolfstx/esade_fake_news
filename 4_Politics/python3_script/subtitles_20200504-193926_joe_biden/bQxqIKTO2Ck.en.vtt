00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.570
I'm here to talk about success right

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.850
the first rule of success is to have a
vision you see if you don't have a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.230
vision of where you go and if you don't
have a goal where you go you drift

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.880
around and you never end up anywhere
it's like you can have the best ship in

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.980
the world
you can have the best airplane in the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.800
world if the pilot or the captain
doesn't know where to go

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.430
it would just drift around he would not
end up anywhere almost like in the wrong

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.370
place so I was very fortunate did I
stumble onto my vision I mean as you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.820
know I was born in 1947 in Austria after
the Second World War and I didn't really

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.969
like Austria grew up I couldn't
wait to get out of there I couldn't see

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.170
myself becoming a farmer or a worker in
a factory or anything like that even

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.570
though my parents wanted me to stay
there and have a normal life my father

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.369
wanted me to become a police officer
like he was my mother wanted me just to

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:28.080
stay there and marry a girl in the name
of Heidi hopefully and have a bunch of

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.830
kids and run around like the Von Trapp
family in The Sound of Music but that

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.750
was their vision not mine my vision was
totally different I felt that I was born

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.920
for something special for something
unique for something big didn't know how

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.740
great it felt that I knew where I was
going

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.659
imagine the majority of people don't
know where they're going

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.049
it's when you have a goal when you have
a vision everything becomes easy

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:03.409
because remember that in America for
instance when you study you will see the

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.380
percentage of people did like their jobs

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.350
74% hate their job in America
now there is not much different when you

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.810
come to Europe the majority of people
don't like what they're doing because

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.990
they're really not doing it because they
didn't have a goal and they'd followed

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:28.310
this goal they're just aimlessly drift
around and then over said and if there's

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.470
a job opening so they get their job
because if the world but then when you

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.300
grow it's a joy it's work it's not fun
so if you think about only a quarter of

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.700
the people really enjoy what they're
doing in life that is unbelievable if

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.440
you think about it so I felt so blessed
that I knew what I was doing it's like a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.460
medical student said studies and knows
he wants to become a doctor you know

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.460
where to go
so I know where to go so people always

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:07.270
ask me when they saw me in the gym in
the pumping iron days you say why is it

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.030
that you're working out so hard five
hours a day six hours a day and you have

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:19.330
always a smile in your face the others
are working out just as hard as you do

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.900
and then look sour in the face why is
that in the told people all the time is

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:33.569
it because to me I am shooting for gold
in front of mr. mr. Universe title

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.939
so every rep that I do gets me closer to
accomplishing the goal to make this call

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:45.420
this vision turn into reality every
single set that I do every repetition

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:49.230
every weight that I live will get my
step closer to turned his goal into

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.189
reality
so I couldn't wait to do another 500

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:58.140
pound squat I couldn't wait it to
another 500 pound bench press I couldn't

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.989
wait to do another 2,000 reps of sit-ups
I couldn't wait for the next exercise

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.049
for the next half hour posing and all
the kind of things that you have to do

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:14.340
you'll be a champion and with the age of
20 with the age of 20 I went to London

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.070
and I won the Mr Universe contest as the
youngest mr. universe ever and it was

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:29.310
because I had a goal so let me tell you
something visualizing your goal and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.410
going after it makes it fun you got to
have a purpose no matter what you do in

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.699
life you got to have a purpose so that's
rule number one

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:47.310
have a vision rule number two is don't
listen to the naysayers don't listen to

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:57.360
the naysayers everything I ever did the
thing that they heard out of people's

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:05.520
mouths was that's impossible that can't
be done Oh No so whenever someone said

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:13.650
to me it can't be done I heard it can be
done when they said no I heard yes and

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.539
when they said it's impossible I heard
it is possible I'm a strong believer

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:25.740
what Nelson Mandela said that everything
is always impossible until someone does

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.940
it
well I'm gonna be the one that said to

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:32.150
myself I'm gonna do it and I'm gonna
show it to them maybe it has never been

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:38.870
done before that's perfectly fine with
me but I am gonna do it and I did not

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:44.780
listen to the naysayers I think the
third point that I'm gonna make to you

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:49.610
is before we sit down with your gun and
talk about the rest of the three is work

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:58.070
your ass off there is no magic bill
there is no magic out there you cannot

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:02.240
get around you have to work and work and
work and it drives me crazy when people

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:09.200
say they don't have enough time to go to
the gym for 45 minutes a day and work

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:15.500
out or do something for 45 minutes to an
hour a day to improve if it is

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:22.660
physically improve of it is mentally to
improve imagine you read one hour a day

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:29.819
about history
how much you will learn after 365 hours

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:36.539
in one year think about if it's study
about the history of musicians of

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.270
composers how much you would know
imagine if you who work on the business

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:47.090
and some business that you want to
develop every day for an hour

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:54.300
imagine how further along you will go
and get so it drives me nuts because we

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:01.380
have when people say they don't have the
time we have 24 hours a day we sleep 6

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.860
hours a day so that gives you still 18
hours but there's someone shaking the

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.919
head out there in front to say probably
I don't sleep 6 hours

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:16.550
I sleep eight hours right or just sleep
faster

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:32.960
so we have 18 hours a day the average
person works around 8 to 10 hours so

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.949
let's assume it's 10 hours so if you
have 8 hours left then you travel around

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:43.999
an hour a day maybe 2 hours a day
so now you've still 6 hours left so what

00:07:43.999 --> 00:07:49.430
do you do it is 6 hours well you do with
the 6 hours then we eat a little bit and

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:55.879
we schmooze a little bit talk a little
bit the people and all that stuff but

00:07:55.879 --> 00:08:03.169
you can see how much time 2 is available
if you organize your day so you got the

00:08:03.169 --> 00:08:08.419
work hard I mean let me tell you
something when I went to America I went

00:08:08.419 --> 00:08:13.450
to college
I went and worked out five hours a day

00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:20.560
and I was working on construction
because in those days in bodybuilding

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:24.910
there was no money we didn't I didn't
have the money for food supplements or

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.860
anything so I had to go to work
say we worked on construction I went to

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.870
college I worked out in the gym and at
night from 8 o'clock at night to 12

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:42.219
midnight I went to acting class four
times a week say I did all that there

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:48.790
was not one single minute that I wasted
I became very friendly with Muhammad Ali

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:59.170
in the 70s Muhammad Ali worked his butt
off and I saw it firsthand now remember

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:04.360
that there was a sports rider that was
there in the gym when he was working out

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.990
and he was doing situps
and they asked him how many sit-ups do

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:15.670
you do and he said I don't start
counting until it hurts now think about

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:22.000
that he doesn't start counting his
setups until they be feels pain that's

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:28.660
when he says counting that is working
hard and so you can't get around the

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:34.650
hardware it doesn't matter who it is so
maverick I believe what Ted Turner said

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:39.240
work like hell and advertise

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:49.730
you get it work like hell go to bed and
early early to rise work like hell and

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:55.820
advertise so you work your ass off and
then you let the world know about your

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:01.310
work that's what it is all about let
people know if you have a company if you

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:07.250
have a movie if you do a sports work
your ass off but then advertise and let

00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:24.320
everyone know I hate plan B and I tell
you why because we have so many doubters

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:30.140
as I've said earlier they eat the no
sales we have so many of those people

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:36.590
that say no and you can't do it it's
impossible that is ok because we just

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:42.050
turn off as I said earlier and B's
listen and be here that now being a yes

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:47.720
you can't do it do it you can't do it
and all that so that that is possible to

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:52.700
do that amongst all the negative people
around you but when you start doubting

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:59.810
yourself that's very dangerous because
now what you're basically saying is is

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:09.080
that if my plan doesn't work I have a
fallback plan have a plan B

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.490
if that means that you start thinking
about Plan B and every thought that you

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:18.890
put into Plan B you're taking away now
that thought and that energy from

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:33.820
playing a and and it's very important to
understand that we function better if

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:41.030
there is no safety net because Plan B
becomes a safety net it says that if I

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:46.190
fail then afar
and I get picked up and I have something

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:51.830
else there that was they will protect me
and that's not good because people

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:59.090
perform better when there's no safety
net people perform better in sports and

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:05.420
everything else if you don't have a plan
B to me it is very dangerous to have a

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:11.180
plan B because you're cutting yourself
off from the chance of really succeeding

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.230
and the reason one of the main reasons
why people want to have a plan B is

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:21.080
because they are worried about failing
what is if I fail then I don't have

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.780
anything else well let me tell you
something don't be afraid of failing

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:31.790
because there's nothing wrong with
failing you have to fail in order to

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:37.320
climb that ladder there's no one that
doesn't fail

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:43.320
we all fail it's okay

00:12:46.910 --> 00:12:54.990
what is not okay is that when you fail
you stay down whoever stays down is a

00:12:54.990 --> 00:13:03.870
loser and winners will fail and get up
fail and get up fail and get up you

00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:09.440
always get up that is a winner that is a
winner

00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:14.790
hey we all lose
we all have lost us this is okay and

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:19.350
this is why I say don't be worried about
losing because when you're afraid of

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:25.290
losing then you get frozen you get stiff
you're not relaxed you got to be in

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:29.220
order to perform well in anything if
it's in boxing or if it is on your job

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:37.170
or with your thinking is only happening
when you relax so relax it's okay to

00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:42.149
fail let's just go all out and give it
everything that you got that's what it

00:13:42.149 --> 00:13:47.880
is all about so don't be afraid to fail
this is one of my six rules to success

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:57.200
you can only feel complete as a person
if you think about what can you do for

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:03.880
your fellow member around you that maybe
needs help

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:08.620
I felt like that everyone has a
different motivation why you get into

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:15.310
that I was an immigrant going to America
and I saw how America was the most

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:18.310
generous country in the world I mean
they opened up their arms to me they

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:21.490
helped me they invited me for
Thanksgiving dinner the people they

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:26.680
brought me the bodybuilders in the gym
brought me plates to my apartment

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.490
because I had no blade said no
silverware I had no bed where I had no

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.120
pillows at the blanket
I had no TV I had no radio I had nothing

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:41.710
they brought it to my apartment
they helped me that's all that firsthand

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:46.540
this generosity in America in the center
myself as an immigrant that is being

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:51.910
embraced with open arms that I need to
go and make sure that I give something

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:53.940
back
