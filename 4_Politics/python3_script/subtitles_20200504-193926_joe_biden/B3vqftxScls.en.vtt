00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:05.100
The President:
 Thank you, Chancellor Merkel, 
 for your leadership,

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.834
your friendship, and the
example of your life --

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:13.367
from a child of the East

00:00:13.367 --> 00:00:17.200
to the leader of a free
and united Germany.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.100
As I've said, Angela and
I don't exactly look

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:27.700
like previous German
and American leaders.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.967
But the fact that we can stand
here today, along the fault line

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:40.633
where a city was divided,
speaks to an eternal truth:

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:46.467
No wall can stand against
the yearning of justice,

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:48.867
the yearnings for freedom,

00:00:48.867 --> 00:00:53.166
the yearnings for peace that
burns in the human heart.

00:00:53.166 --> 00:01:01.333
(applause)

00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:05.767
Mayor Wowereit,
distinguished guests,

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:09.333
and especially the people
of Berlin and of Germany --

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:12.600
thank you for this 
extraordinarily warm welcome.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.500
In fact, it's so warm and I feel
so good that I'm actually

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.100
going to take off my jacket,
and anybody else who wants to,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.433
feel free to.

00:01:21.433 --> 00:01:29.433
(applause)

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:32.734
We can be a little more
informal among friends.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:39.934
(applause)

00:01:39.934 --> 00:01:42.633
As your Chancellor mentioned,
five years ago

00:01:42.633 --> 00:01:46.667
I had the privilege to address
this city as senator.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:52.367
Today, I'm proud to return as
President of the United States.

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:58.100
(applause)

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.300
And I bring with me
the enduring friendship

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.667
of the American people,
as well as my wife, Michelle,

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:05.967
and Malia and Sasha.

00:02:05.967 --> 00:02:10.633
(applause)

00:02:10.633 --> 00:02:14.133
You may notice that
they're not here.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.367
The last thing they
want to do is to listen

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:18.166
to another speech from me.

00:02:18.166 --> 00:02:19.433
(laughter)

00:02:19.433 --> 00:02:21.166
So they're out
experiencing the beauty

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:28.367
and the history of Berlin.

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:32.734
And this history
speaks to us today.

00:02:32.734 --> 00:02:37.266
Here, for thousands of years,
the people of this land

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:42.700
have journeyed from tribe to
principality to nation-state;

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.100
through Reformation
and Enlightenment,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.767
renowned as a "land
of poets and thinkers,"

00:02:50.767 --> 00:02:55.333
among them Immanuel Kant,
who taught us that freedom

00:02:55.333 --> 00:02:59.567
is the "unoriginated
birthright of man,

00:02:59.567 --> 00:03:04.867
and it belongs to him by
force of his humanity."

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:11.800
Here, for two centuries, this
gate stood tall as the world

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.734
around it convulsed -- through
the rise and fall of empires;

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:21.300
through revolutions and
republics; art and music

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.533
and science that reflected
the height of human endeavor,

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:29.033
but also war and carnage
that exposed the depths

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:32.934
of man's cruelty to man.

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:36.400
It was here that Berliners
carved out an island

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.367
of democracy against
the greatest of odds.

00:03:41.367 --> 00:03:43.033
As has already been mentioned,
they were supported

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:47.033
by an airlift of hope, and we
are so honored to be joined

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:50.667
by Colonel Halvorsen,
92 years old --

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:52.934
the original "candy bomber."

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:54.600
We could not be prouder of him.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:04.433
(applause)

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:07.400
I hope I look that good,
by the way, when I'm 92.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.266
(laughter)

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:16.100
During that time, a Marshall
Plan seeded a miracle,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.100
and a North Atlantic Alliance
protected our people.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.967
And those in the neighborhoods
and nations to the East drew

00:04:24.967 --> 00:04:28.700
strength from the knowledge that
freedom was possible here,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:34.266
in Berlin -- that the waves
of crackdowns and suppressions

00:04:34.266 --> 00:04:39.000
might therefore
someday be overcome.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.800
Today, 60 years after they
rose up against oppression,

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.233
we remember the East German
heroes of June 17th.

00:04:49.233 --> 00:04:53.300
When the wall finally came down,

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.200
it was their dreams
that were fulfilled.

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:02.700
Their strength and their
passion, their enduring example

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.633
remind us that for all
the power of militaries,

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:07.700
for all the authority
of governments,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:11.900
it is citizens who choose
whether to be defined by a wall,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.600
or whether to tear it down.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:23.100
(applause)

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:28.066
And we're now surrounded by the
symbols of a Germany reborn.

00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:33.433
A rebuilt Reichstag and
its glistening glass dome.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:38.800
An American embassy back at its
historic home on Pariser Platz.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.834
(applause)

00:05:42.834 --> 00:05:46.800
And this square itself,
once a desolate no man's land,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.934
is now open to all.

00:05:48.934 --> 00:05:51.133
So while I am not the
first American President

00:05:51.133 --> 00:05:54.700
to come to this gate, I am proud
to stand on its Eastern side

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:56.934
to pay tribute to the past.

00:05:56.934 --> 00:06:05.900
(applause)

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.900
For throughout all this history,

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.000
the fate of this city
came down to a simple question:

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.033
Will we live free or in chains?

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:21.166
Under governments that uphold
our universal rights,

00:06:21.166 --> 00:06:25.200
or regimes that suppress them?

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.867
In open societies that respect
the sanctity of the individual

00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:32.767
and our free will,
or in closed societies

00:06:32.767 --> 00:06:36.300
that suffocate the soul?

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.300
As free peoples, we stated
our convictions long ago.

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.967
As Americans, we believe that
"all men are created equal"

00:06:46.967 --> 00:06:49.767
with the right
to life and liberty,

00:06:49.767 --> 00:06:52.800
and the pursuit of happiness.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.600
And as Germans, you declared
in your Basic Law that

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.800
"the dignity of
man is inviolable."

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:07.867
(applause)

00:07:07.867 --> 00:07:10.600
Around the world, nations
have pledged themselves

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.433
to a Universal Declaration
of Human Rights,

00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:15.200
which recognizes the
inherent dignity and rights

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.433
of all members
of our human family.

00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:24.567
And this is what was at stake
here in Berlin all those years.

00:07:24.567 --> 00:07:30.300
And because courageous crowds
climbed atop that wall,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.467
because corrupt dictatorships 
gave way to new democracies,

00:07:34.467 --> 00:07:36.200
because millions
across this continent

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.667
now breathe the
fresh air of freedom,

00:07:38.667 --> 00:07:41.367
we can say, here in
Berlin, here in Europe --

00:07:41.367 --> 00:07:43.934
our values won.

00:07:43.934 --> 00:07:45.300
Openness won.

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:46.500
Tolerance won.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.367
And freedom won here in Berlin.

00:07:50.367 --> 00:07:59.700
(applause)

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:05.233
And yet, more than two
decades after that triumph,

00:08:05.233 --> 00:08:07.500
we must acknowledge
that there can, at times,

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:13.266
be a complacency among
our Western democracies.

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:15.433
Today, people often come
together in places like this

00:08:15.433 --> 00:08:19.834
to remember history --
not to make it.

00:08:19.834 --> 00:08:25.233
After all, we face no concrete
walls, no barbed wire.

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:28.667
There are no tanks
poised across a border.

00:08:28.667 --> 00:08:32.367
There are no visits
to fallout shelters.

00:08:32.367 --> 00:08:34.233
And so sometimes
there can be a sense

00:08:34.233 --> 00:08:39.767
that the great challenges
have somehow passed.

00:08:39.767 --> 00:08:43.033
And that brings with it a
temptation to turn inward --

00:08:43.033 --> 00:08:47.100
to think of our own pursuits, 
and not the sweep of history;

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:51.433
to believe that we've 
settled history's accounts,

00:08:51.433 --> 00:08:57.767
that we can simply enjoy 
the fruits won by our forebears.

00:08:57.767 --> 00:09:00.300
But I come here today, Berlin,

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:07.300
to say complacency is not
the character of great nations.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:11.300
Today's threats are not as stark
as they were half a century ago,

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:17.500
but the struggle for freedom and
security and human dignity --

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.100
that struggle goes on.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.467
And I've come here, to this city
of hope, because the tests

00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:28.000
of our time demand the same
fighting spirit that defined

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.100
Berlin a half-century ago.

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.166
Chancellor Merkel mentioned
that we mark the anniversary

00:09:36.166 --> 00:09:39.934
of President John F. Kennedy's 
stirring defense of freedom,

00:09:39.934 --> 00:09:44.333
embodied in the people
of this great city.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:50.266
His pledge of solidarity --
"Ich bin ein Berliner" --

00:09:50.266 --> 00:09:51.467
(applause)

00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:55.133
-- echoes through the ages.

00:09:55.133 --> 00:10:01.800
But that's not all
that he said that day.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.266
Less remembered is the challenge
that he issued to the crowd

00:10:05.266 --> 00:10:10.467
before him: "Let me ask you,"
he said to those Berliners,

00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:13.000
"let me ask you
to lift your eyes

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.734
beyond the dangers of today"

00:10:16.734 --> 00:10:20.834
and "beyond the freedom
of merely this city."

00:10:20.834 --> 00:10:26.266
Look, he said, "to the day
of peace with justice,

00:10:26.266 --> 00:10:33.033
beyond yourselves and
ourselves to all mankind."

00:10:33.033 --> 00:10:36.266
President Kennedy was taken
from us less than six months

00:10:36.266 --> 00:10:39.066
after he spoke those words.

00:10:39.066 --> 00:10:41.734
And like so many who died in
those decades of division,

00:10:41.734 --> 00:10:46.367
he did not live to see
Berlin united and free.

00:10:46.367 --> 00:10:51.533
Instead, he lives forever as
a young man in our memory.

00:10:51.533 --> 00:10:55.400
But his words are timeless
because they call upon us

00:10:55.400 --> 00:11:03.500
to care more about things
than just our own self-comfort,

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.300
about our own city,
about our own country.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:12.000
They demand that we embrace the
common endeavor of all humanity.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.900
And if we lift our eyes,
as President Kennedy called us

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:22.633
to do, then we'll recognize
that our work is not yet done.

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:25.700
For we are not only citizens
of America or Germany --

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.633
we are also citizens
of the world.

00:11:28.633 --> 00:11:34.033
And our fates and fortunes
are linked like never before.

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:37.900
We may no longer live in fear
of global annihilation,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:42.367
but so long as nuclear weapons
exist, we are not truly safe.

00:11:42.367 --> 00:11:49.066
(applause)

00:11:49.066 --> 00:11:51.767
We may strike blows
against terrorist networks,

00:11:51.767 --> 00:11:54.166
but if we ignore the
instability and intolerance

00:11:54.166 --> 00:11:56.533
that fuels extremism,

00:11:56.533 --> 00:12:01.400
our own freedom will
eventually be endangered.

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.800
We may enjoy a
standard of living

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.867
that is the envy of the world,

00:12:04.867 --> 00:12:08.367
but so long as hundreds
of millions endure the agony

00:12:08.367 --> 00:12:13.133
of an empty stomach or the
anguish of unemployment,

00:12:13.133 --> 00:12:16.233
we're not truly prosperous.

00:12:16.233 --> 00:12:23.200
(applause)

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.400
I say all this here,
in the heart of Europe,

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.600
because our shared past shows
that none of these challenges

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.300
can be met unless we see
ourselves as part of something

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.600
bigger than our own experience.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:41.400
Our alliance is the
foundation of global security.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.834
Our trade and our commerce

00:12:42.834 --> 00:12:46.233
is the engine of
our global economy.

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:48.800
Our values call upon us
to care about the lives

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.900
of people we will never meet.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.934
When Europe and America
lead with our hopes

00:12:53.934 --> 00:12:55.700
instead of our fears,

00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:00.667
we do things that no
other nations can do,

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:03.233
no other nations will do.

00:13:03.233 --> 00:13:06.967
So we have to lift up our eyes
today and consider the day

00:13:06.967 --> 00:13:13.200
of peace with justice that our
generation wants for this world.

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.867
I'd suggest that peace with
justice begins with the example

00:13:15.867 --> 00:13:20.166
we set here at home, for we
know from our own histories

00:13:20.166 --> 00:13:23.200
that intolerance
breeds injustice.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.567
Whether it's based
on race, or religion,

00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:29.600
gender or sexual orientation,

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.967
we are stronger
when all our people --

00:13:31.967 --> 00:13:34.200
no matter who they are
or what they look like --

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.934
are granted opportunity,

00:13:35.934 --> 00:13:37.500
and when our wives
and our daughters

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.266
have the same opportunities
as our husbands and our sons.

00:13:41.266 --> 00:13:50.533
(applause)

00:13:50.533 --> 00:13:53.000
When we respect the faiths
practiced in our churches

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.734
and synagogues, our mosques and
our temples, we're more secure.

00:13:58.734 --> 00:14:03.767
When we welcome the immigrant
with his talents or her dreams,

00:14:03.767 --> 00:14:06.000
we are renewed.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.266
(applause)

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.767
When we stand up for
our gay and lesbian brothers

00:14:12.767 --> 00:14:16.000
and sisters and treat their
love and their rights equally

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.633
under the law, we defend
our own liberty as well.

00:14:19.633 --> 00:14:23.433
We are more free when all people
can pursue their own happiness.

00:14:23.433 --> 00:14:31.166
(applause)

00:14:31.166 --> 00:14:37.834
And as long as walls exist
in our hearts to separate us

00:14:37.834 --> 00:14:40.734
from those who don't look
like us, or think like us,

00:14:40.734 --> 00:14:43.967
or worship as we do,

00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:47.633
then we're going to have
to work harder, together,

00:14:47.633 --> 00:14:52.700
to bring those walls
of division down.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:56.033
Peace with justice means free
enterprise that unleashes

00:14:56.033 --> 00:15:00.433
the talents and creativity
that reside in each of us;

00:15:00.433 --> 00:15:05.867
in other models, direct economic 
growth from the top down

00:15:05.867 --> 00:15:07.700
or relies solely
on the resources

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.800
extracted from the earth.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.967
But we believe
that real prosperity

00:15:10.967 --> 00:15:15.767
comes from our most 
precious resource -- our people.

00:15:15.767 --> 00:15:18.467
And that's why we choose
to invest in education,

00:15:18.467 --> 00:15:21.133
and science and research.

00:15:21.133 --> 00:15:27.600
(applause)

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.300
And now, as we
emerge from recession,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:31.934
we must not avert our eyes

00:15:31.934 --> 00:15:35.166
from the insult
of widening inequality,

00:15:35.166 --> 00:15:38.166
or the pain of youth
who are unemployed.

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:41.033
We have to build new ladders of
opportunity in our own societies

00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:44.467
that -- even as we pursue
new trade and investment

00:15:44.467 --> 00:15:48.266
that fuels growth
across the Atlantic.

00:15:48.266 --> 00:15:51.100
America will stand with Europe
as you strengthen your union.

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:55.433
And we want to work with you
to make sure that every person

00:15:55.433 --> 00:15:57.800
can enjoy the dignity
that comes from work --

00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:01.700
whether they live in Chicago 
or Cleveland or Belfast or Berlin,

00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:03.300
in Athens or Madrid,

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:05.567
everybody deserves opportunity.

00:16:05.567 --> 00:16:08.700
We have to have economies that
are working for all people,

00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.667
not just those at the very top.

00:16:10.667 --> 00:16:20.934
(applause)

00:16:20.934 --> 00:16:23.934
Peace with justice means
extending a hand to those

00:16:23.934 --> 00:16:28.900
who reach for freedom,
wherever they live.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.567
Different peoples and cultures
will follow their own path,

00:16:31.567 --> 00:16:36.834
but we must reject the lie that
those who live in distant places

00:16:36.834 --> 00:16:39.000
don't yearn for freedom
and self-determination

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.433
just like we do;

00:16:41.433 --> 00:16:44.400
that they don't somehow yearn
for dignity and rule of law

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.066
just like we do.

00:16:47.066 --> 00:16:49.133
We cannot dictate
the pace of change

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:50.734
in places like the Arab world,

00:16:50.734 --> 00:16:53.166
but we must reject the excuse

00:16:53.166 --> 00:16:56.333
that we can do nothing
to support it.

00:16:56.333 --> 00:17:01.500
(applause)

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.166
We cannot shrink from our role
of advancing the values

00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:06.900
we believe in -- whether it's
supporting Afghans as they take

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:10.867
responsibility for their
future, or working for an

00:17:10.867 --> 00:17:13.200
Israeli-Palestinian peace --

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.000
(applause)

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.200
-- or engaging as
we've done in Burma

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.433
to help create space
for brave people

00:17:20.433 --> 00:17:23.800
to emerge from decades
of dictatorship.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.433
In this century, these
are the citizens

00:17:26.433 --> 00:17:29.633
who long to join the free world.

00:17:29.633 --> 00:17:32.233
They are who you were.

00:17:32.233 --> 00:17:37.000
They deserve our support, for
they too, in their own way,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.767
are citizens of Berlin.

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:42.934
And we have to help
them every day.

00:17:42.934 --> 00:17:51.867
(applause)

00:17:51.867 --> 00:17:54.900
Peace with justice means
pursuing the security of a world

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.767
without nuclear weapons --
no matter how distant

00:17:57.767 --> 00:17:59.967
that dream may be.

00:17:59.967 --> 00:18:01.800
And so, as President, I've
strengthened our efforts

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.200
to stop the spread
of nuclear weapons,

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:09.066
and reduced the number and role 
of America's nuclear weapons.

00:18:09.066 --> 00:18:12.100
Because of the New START Treaty,
we're on track to cut American

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.300
and Russian deployed nuclear
warheads to their lowest levels

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.467
since the 1950s.

00:18:18.467 --> 00:18:23.133
(applause)

00:18:23.133 --> 00:18:25.433
But we have more work to do.

00:18:25.433 --> 00:18:28.700
So today, I'm announcing
additional steps forward.

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.867
After a comprehensive review,
I've determined that we can

00:18:30.867 --> 00:18:34.900
ensure the security of America
and our allies, and maintain

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:38.100
a strong and credible strategic
deterrent, while reducing our

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:42.934
deployed strategic nuclear
weapons by up to one-third.

00:18:42.934 --> 00:18:46.400
And I intend to seek negotiated
cuts with Russia to move beyond

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.166
Cold War nuclear postures.

00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:58.600
(applause)

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.467
At the same time, we'll work
with our NATO allies to seek

00:19:01.467 --> 00:19:05.467
bold reductions in U.S. 
and Russian tactical weapons

00:19:05.467 --> 00:19:07.533
in Europe.

00:19:07.533 --> 00:19:09.500
And we can forge a new
international framework

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:16.500
for peaceful nuclear power, and
reject the nuclear weaponization

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:20.400
that North Korea and
Iran may be seeking.

00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.133
America will host a summit in
2016 to continue our efforts to

00:19:24.133 --> 00:19:27.767
secure nuclear materials around
the world, and we will work

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:30.266
to build support in the
United States to ratify the

00:19:30.266 --> 00:19:34.533
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban
Treaty, and call on all nations

00:19:34.533 --> 00:19:37.367
to begin negotiations on a
treaty that ends the production

00:19:37.367 --> 00:19:39.800
of fissile materials
for nuclear weapons.

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.433
These are steps we can take
to create a world

00:19:43.433 --> 00:19:45.667
of peace with justice.

00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:56.734
(applause)

00:19:56.734 --> 00:19:59.633
Peace with justice means
refusing to condemn our children

00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:04.200
to a harsher, less
hospitable planet.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:07.934
The effort to slow climate
change requires bold action.

00:20:07.934 --> 00:20:11.533
And on this, Germany
and Europe have led.

00:20:11.533 --> 00:20:14.133
In the United States, we have
recently doubled our renewable

00:20:14.133 --> 00:20:17.400
energy from clean sources
like wind and solar power.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.033
We're doubling fuel
efficiency on our cars.

00:20:20.033 --> 00:20:22.467
Our dangerous carbon
emissions have come down.

00:20:22.467 --> 00:20:27.166
But we know we have to do
more -- and we will do more.

00:20:27.166 --> 00:20:33.900
(applause)

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:37.233
With a global middle class
consuming more energy every day,

00:20:37.233 --> 00:20:41.934
this must now be an effort of
all nations, not just some.

00:20:41.934 --> 00:20:45.633
For the grim alternative affects
all nations -- more severe

00:20:45.633 --> 00:20:51.633
storms, more famine and
floods, new waves of refugees,

00:20:51.633 --> 00:20:54.300
coastlines that vanish,
oceans that rise.

00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:57.533
This is the future
we must avert.

00:20:57.533 --> 00:21:00.500
This is the global
threat of our time.

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:04.266
And for the sake of future
generations, our generation must

00:21:04.266 --> 00:21:08.600
move toward a global compact
to confront a changing climate

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.200
before it is too late.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:11.767
That is our job.

00:21:11.767 --> 00:21:13.200
That is our task.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.967
We have to get to work.

00:21:14.967 --> 00:21:24.934
(applause)

00:21:24.934 --> 00:21:30.000
Peace with justice means
meeting our moral obligations.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.066
And we have a moral obligation
and a profound interest

00:21:33.066 --> 00:21:39.333
in helping lift the impoverished
corners of the world.

00:21:39.333 --> 00:21:42.734
By promoting growth so we spare
a child born today a lifetime

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:45.133
of extreme poverty.

00:21:45.133 --> 00:21:47.734
By investing in agriculture,
so we aren't just sending food,

00:21:47.734 --> 00:21:51.800
but also teaching
farmers to grow food.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.800
By strengthening public health,
so we're not just sending

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.233
medicine, but training doctors
and nurses who will help end

00:21:57.233 --> 00:22:02.100
the outrage of children dying
from preventable diseases.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:05.166
Making sure that we do
everything we can to realize

00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:08.333
the promise --
an achievable promise --

00:22:08.333 --> 00:22:11.000
of the first
AIDS-free generation.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.467
That is something that is
possible if we feel

00:22:14.467 --> 00:22:16.467
a sufficient sense of urgency.

00:22:16.467 --> 00:22:22.367
(applause)

00:22:22.367 --> 00:22:25.867
Our efforts have to be about
more than just charity.

00:22:25.867 --> 00:22:28.233
They're about new models of
empowering people -- to build

00:22:28.233 --> 00:22:33.767
institutions; to abandon the rot
of corruption; to create ties of

00:22:33.767 --> 00:22:39.700
trade, not just aid, both with
the West and among the nations

00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:45.300
that are seeking to rise and
increase their capacity.

00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:50.300
Because when they succeed, we
will be more successful as well.

00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:56.000
Our fates are linked, and we
cannot ignore those

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.934
who are yearning not only for
freedom but also prosperity.

00:23:01.934 --> 00:23:05.967
And finally, let's remember that
peace with justice depends

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:09.533
on our ability to sustain both
the security of our societies

00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:13.633
and the openness
that defines them.

00:23:13.633 --> 00:23:18.100
Threats to freedom don't
merely come from the outside.

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.734
They can emerge from within --

00:23:20.734 --> 00:23:23.000
from our own fears,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:27.400
from the disengagement
of our citizens.

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.700
For over a decade,
America has been at war.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.333
Yet much has now changed
over the five years

00:23:35.333 --> 00:23:38.867
since I last
spoke here in Berlin.

00:23:38.867 --> 00:23:41.433
The Iraq war is now over.

00:23:41.433 --> 00:23:44.700
The Afghan war is
coming to an end.

00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.734
Osama bin Laden is no more.

00:23:47.734 --> 00:23:52.767
Our efforts against
al Qaeda are evolving.

00:23:52.767 --> 00:23:56.100
And given these changes, last
month, I spoke about America's

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.433
efforts against terrorism.

00:23:59.433 --> 00:24:02.266
And I drew inspiration from
one of our founding fathers,

00:24:02.266 --> 00:24:06.266
James Madison, who wrote,
"No nation could preserve

00:24:06.266 --> 00:24:12.133
its freedom in the midst
of continual warfare."

00:24:12.133 --> 00:24:16.166
James Madison is right --
which is why, even as we remain

00:24:16.166 --> 00:24:19.133
vigilant about the
threat of terrorism,

00:24:19.133 --> 00:24:23.400
we must move beyond a
mindset of perpetual war.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.567
And in America, that
means redoubling our efforts

00:24:25.567 --> 00:24:28.734
to close the
prison at Guantanamo.

00:24:28.734 --> 00:24:37.633
(applause)

00:24:37.633 --> 00:24:40.700
It means tightly controlling
our use of new technologies

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.633
like drones.

00:24:42.633 --> 00:24:45.867
It means balancing
the pursuit of security

00:24:45.867 --> 00:24:48.133
with the protection of privacy.

00:24:48.133 --> 00:24:49.600
(applause)

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:54.233
And I'm confident that
that balance can be struck.

00:24:54.233 --> 00:24:59.700
I'm confident of that, and I'm
confident that working with

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:03.934
Germany, we can keep each other
safe while at the same time

00:25:03.934 --> 00:25:10.333
maintaining those essential
values for which we fought for.

00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:13.300
Our current programs
are bound by the rule of law,

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.600
and they're focused on
threats to our security --

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.700
not the communications
of ordinary persons.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.200
They help confront real dangers,
and they keep people safe here

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.433
in the United States
and here in Europe.

00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:29.200
But we must accept the challenge
that all of us in democratic

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:36.000
governments face: to listen to
the voices who disagree with us;

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.767
to have an open debate about
how we use our powers and how

00:25:41.767 --> 00:25:45.367
we must constrain them; and to
always remember that government

00:25:45.367 --> 00:25:48.000
exists to serve the
power of the individual,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.867
and not the other way around.

00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:52.800
That's what makes us who we
are, and that's what makes us

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.266
different from those on
the other side of the wall.

00:25:56.266 --> 00:26:04.934
(applause)

00:26:04.934 --> 00:26:08.467
That is how we'll stay true
to our better history while

00:26:08.467 --> 00:26:14.567
reaching for the day of peace
and justice that is to come.

00:26:14.567 --> 00:26:20.633
These are the beliefs that guide
us, the values that inspire us,

00:26:20.633 --> 00:26:25.033
the principles that bind us
together as free peoples

00:26:25.033 --> 00:26:29.000
who still believe the words of
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. --

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.633
that "injustice anywhere is a
threat to justice everywhere."

00:26:33.633 --> 00:26:34.800
(applause)

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.133
And we should ask, should
anyone ask if our generation

00:26:40.133 --> 00:26:43.400
has the courage
to meet these tests?

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:48.066
If anybody asks if President
Kennedy's words ring true today,

00:26:48.066 --> 00:26:51.567
let them come to Berlin, for
here they will find the people

00:26:51.567 --> 00:26:53.333
who emerged from
the ruins of war

00:26:53.333 --> 00:26:56.433
to reap the blessings of peace;

00:26:56.433 --> 00:27:01.400
from the pain of division
to the joy of reunification.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.100
And here, they will recall how
people trapped behind a wall

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.300
braved bullets,
and jumped barbed wire,

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.400
and dashed across minefields,
and dug through tunnels,

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.567
and leapt from buildings,
and swam across the Spree

00:27:13.567 --> 00:27:17.500
to claim their most
basic right of freedom.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:28.266
(applause)

00:27:28.266 --> 00:27:31.500
The wall belongs to history.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:34.900
But we have history
to make as well.

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:41.200
And the heroes that came before
us now call to us to live up

00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:43.934
to those highest ideals --

00:27:43.934 --> 00:27:45.967
to care for the young
people who can't find a job

00:27:45.967 --> 00:27:48.900
in our own countries,
and the girls who aren't allowed

00:27:48.900 --> 00:27:55.200
to go to school overseas; to be
vigilant in safeguarding our own

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.734
freedoms, but also to extend a
hand to those who are reaching

00:27:59.734 --> 00:28:02.867
for freedom abroad.

00:28:02.867 --> 00:28:06.000
This is the lesson of the ages.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.667
This is the spirit of Berlin.

00:28:08.667 --> 00:28:10.033
And the greatest
tribute that we can pay

00:28:10.033 --> 00:28:12.133
to those who came before us

00:28:12.133 --> 00:28:16.533
is by carrying on their work
to pursue peace and justice

00:28:16.533 --> 00:28:20.734
not only in our countries
but for all mankind.

00:28:20.734 --> 00:28:22.000
Vielen Dank.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.233
(applause)

00:28:23.233 --> 00:28:25.000
God bless you.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.600
God bless the
peoples of Germany.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.333
And God bless the United
States of America.

00:28:28.333 --> 00:28:29.567
Thank you very much.

00:28:29.567 --> 00:28:31.667
(applause)
