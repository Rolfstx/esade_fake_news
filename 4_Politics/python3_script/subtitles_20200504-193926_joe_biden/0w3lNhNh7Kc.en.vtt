- It's important for
all of us to know

00:00:02.602 --> 00:00:05.438 align:start size:97% position:3%
that at the end of the
day, if they were to choose

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:07.474
to activate some of
their sleeper cells

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.043 align:start size:97% position:3%
in places like Los Angeles,
because they are here,

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.379
or in places like in
Michigan, et cetera,

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:13.613
then it's game over.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:15.048 align:start size:81% position:19%
They know that
the United States,

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.550 align:start position:0%
either alone or with a
coalition, will go into Tehran.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.919 align:start size:84% position:16%
We'll be there within
12 to 24 hours.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:22.589

Welcome back to
The Rubin Report.

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:57.924 line:0%
- Pleasure, brother.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:01:00.326 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
I had you on here
about four years ago.

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:04.431 line:0%
It's like 18 studios ago,
feels like 27 lives ago.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:05.665
- Yeah.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:06.833
- Here we are, we
gotta lot to do.

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.234 align:start size:84% position:16%
- And you've become
an alt-right,

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:10.103
gay Nazi, which congratulations.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.438 align:start size:84% position:16%
Very exciting.
- Thank you, please.

00:01:11.438 --> 00:01:13.206 align:start size:84% position:16%
My mother is so proud.
- No, I'm honored.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.075
I do wonder though,
at the Klan meetings,

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:17.243 align:start size:97% position:3%
do you and your husband
wear like the rainbow hats,

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.478
do the rainbow?

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:19.446
- Well, they make you
wear the rainbow hat

00:01:19.446 --> 00:01:20.280 align:start size:72% position:28%
as a gay.
- Okay, okay.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.347
Well, incredible.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:22.615
(Dave laughing)

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.150
Great, great development
for you and your family.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.319
- Little did you know four
years ago when we sat down

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:27.921
that so much was gonna happen.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.322
- Yeah, here we are.

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:30.723
- All right, I'm really
glad to have you here

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.126
for many reasons.

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.895 align:start position:0%
Before we get into Iran, before
we get into the deep state,

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:38.731
before we get into the
split of the Democrats,

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.534 align:start size:97% position:3%
the rise of the socialists,
and the whole thing,

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.503
former CIA Ops.

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:46.372 align:start size:97% position:3%
Just give me a little recap
of what got ya into it,

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:48.074
what does that actually mean,

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:50.543
and then we'll take it
away on current events.

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:53.480 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So, back in early
2000, just before 9/11,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.482
I was interested in
national security

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:57.817 line:0%
and the State Department
and CIA were both options.

00:01:57.817 --> 00:01:59.919 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
I decided that after
looking at each,

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:02.122 line:0%
the CIA made the
most sense for me.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.389
It was a little bit more cowboy,

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.258
which coming from
a farm and a ranch

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:08.728
in the western part of this
country, it fit me better.

00:02:08.728 --> 00:02:12.432 align:start position:0%
So I applied, moved forward
through the application process,

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:15.435
took a couple years,
and ended up working up

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.804 align:start size:88% position:13%
as a what they call
the Clandestine Service
Trainee Program,

00:02:17.804 --> 00:02:19.038
was there for a couple years,

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.673
and then sent out
into the field.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:24.077
- So, what was it like being
in the field as a CIA guy?

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:25.578
- You know, just after 9/11,

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:30.583 align:start size:97% position:3%
it was an incredibly difficult
and challenging time.

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:33.920 align:start size:88% position:13%
You know, we didn't know
how many more threats

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.622
were going to be actualized,

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:38.191 align:start size:97% position:3%
you know, how many more people
were going to be killed.

00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:43.196
And so, it became
a very intense time

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.165 align:start size:84% position:16%
to be in the
Intelligence Community

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.833
but it was also thrilling.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:49.669 align:start size:94% position:6%
You know, at a very young
age, I was 24 or 25,

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.905 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you're out in the field,
doing incredible stuff,

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:55.675 align:start size:94% position:6%
meeting with the bad guys
who are good for you,

00:02:55.675 --> 00:02:58.111 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it was an
incredible opportunity

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:01.581
that what you were doing
every day helped ensure

00:03:01.581 --> 00:03:04.083
that people back
home didn't die.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.619
- How do you figure out which
bad guys are good for you?

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.221
(Bryan laughing)
(Dave laughing)

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.656
- Oh dear, yeah.

00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:10.490 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Is that a question
you can answer?

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.658
- Yeah.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.026 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, there's a vetting
process, right?

00:03:13.026 --> 00:03:15.662 align:start size:88% position:13%
You first start with,
what do you need to know

00:03:15.662 --> 00:03:17.263
in a particular
part of the world

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:19.098
on a particular issue, right?

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:21.100 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, once you do that, you
go through a target analysis

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.368
and you figure out who has

00:03:22.368 --> 00:03:24.037
the information in
that organization

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:25.772 align:start size:88% position:13%
or that piece of
knowledge that you need

00:03:25.772 --> 00:03:27.574 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then you target
that individual

00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:31.177
and then you approach
them in some capacity

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:34.314
and then you build
a relationship and
you not only ensure

00:03:34.314 --> 00:03:36.883 align:start size:97% position:3%
that they are who you
thought that they were to be,

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:38.785 align:start size:88% position:13%
you then make sure
that they're compatible

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:40.587
in terms of living
a clandestine life

00:03:40.587 --> 00:03:42.889 align:start size:84% position:16%
with you as an
Intelligence Officer.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.725
So, that is a very long
process, or it can be,

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:48.361
but in those early days,
we were recruiting people

00:03:48.361 --> 00:03:51.331 align:start size:94% position:6%
to be informants for us
with not a lot of scrutiny

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.499
because we just had
so little information

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:57.136 align:start size:97% position:3%
and the threat was so profound
and it was so immediate.

00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:59.939
- All right, so we could do
CIA 101 the whole time here

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.641
and for people that
want that, we'll link

00:04:01.641 --> 00:04:04.410 align:start size:94% position:6%
to our old interview
because I wanna catch up,

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.979 align:start size:84% position:16%
because we hadn't
had you on in awhile

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:07.914
and when we booked
this, this was before

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:10.383
this Iran World War
III thing happened.

00:04:10.383 --> 00:04:11.651
- Oh, it's happening?

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:12.885
World War 3, okay.
- Well, apparently

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.320
if you listen to Rose
McGowan on Twitter,

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.789
not only that but World
War Four has also begun.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:17.957
There's a lotta wars coming

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.459
- Oh my gosh.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.694
- Well, that's exactly why
I wanted to start with this

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:24.998
because it seems to me that
if you're paying attention

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.166
to social media, as it
does to most things,

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.368
we've ramped everything up

00:04:28.368 --> 00:04:30.103 align:start size:84% position:16%
to crazy levels
beyond imagination.

00:04:30.103 --> 00:04:34.107
It is so hard to find
sort of clear, sane,

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:37.110
non-extremist voices in
the midst of all this.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.911
I consider you one
of those people.

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:43.316
So can you talk to me about
what's going on with Iran

00:04:43.316 --> 00:04:45.184
and are we in World War III?

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:46.419 align:start size:97% position:3%
Are we going down the path?
- We are not.

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.187 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We're not in World War III.
- No, whew!

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:49.422 align:start size:84% position:16%
- All right, well
now we have the quote

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:50.123
for this interview.
- Yes, all right.

00:04:50.123 --> 00:04:51.391
- Okay, good

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.925
So, to understand
what's happening,

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:55.295
I think you have to step back
and ask yourself the question,

00:04:55.295 --> 00:04:57.463
you know, what does Iran
want ultimately, right?

00:04:57.463 --> 00:05:00.066
In general, what
this regime wants

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:03.202 align:start position:0%
is both stability and survival,
more than anything else.

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:05.371
So whatever it does in terms

00:05:05.371 --> 00:05:06.873 align:start size:94% position:6%
of international affairs,
domestic affairs,

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:10.143 align:start size:97% position:3%
it's all designed to make sure
that the regime continues.

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:11.110
So, they have red lines.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.378
They have red lines internally,

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.914
in terms of how far they
will let the populace go

00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.983 align:start size:84% position:16%
in terms of demanding
certain things,

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.519 align:start position:0%
and then abroad, you know,
they'll push as far as they can,

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.221
knowing full well that the
United States and the West

00:05:22.221 --> 00:05:24.557 align:start size:81% position:19%
and Israel at some
point will say,

00:05:24.557 --> 00:05:26.059
that's a bridge too far,

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:27.593 align:start size:94% position:6%
and they will pound the
living hell out of Tehran.

00:05:27.593 --> 00:05:29.062
So, they're always
poking the bear.

00:05:29.062 --> 00:05:31.631 align:start size:94% position:6%
They're always
challenging that red line.

00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.400
So, it's important
for all of us to know

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.469
that at the end of
the day, you know,

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.504 align:start size:84% position:16%
if they were to choose
to activate some

00:05:38.504 --> 00:05:40.907
of their sleeper cells in
places like Los Angeles,

00:05:40.907 --> 00:05:43.209
because they are here, or
in places like in Michigan,

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.511
et cetera, then it's game over.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.513 align:start size:94% position:6%
They know that the United
States, either alone

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.282
or with a coalition,
will go into Tehran

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:51.551
and we'll be there within,
you know, 12 to 24 hours.

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:53.319 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay, so let's pause
there for a moment

00:05:53.319 --> 00:05:54.554
because that was a
bit of knowledge.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:56.723
So, Iran basically
has sleeper cells--

00:05:56.723 --> 00:05:57.990
- Sure.

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.859
In Western cities, you
just said Los Angeles.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:01.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Correct.
- We're in Los Angeles,

00:06:01.094 --> 00:06:02.695
Michigan, I'm sure
in European cities.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.665
So, if we know these things
exist, what are we doing

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:07.633
to actually disrupt these cells?

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:10.670
- So, both the FBI and
the CIA have long known

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.173
that Hezbollah and Iran have
operated these sleeper cells

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:16.376 align:start size:97% position:3%
and so they've kept a pretty
good pulse on these folks

00:06:16.376 --> 00:06:20.079 align:start size:97% position:3%
but the issue is, do you know
about all of them, right?

00:06:20.079 --> 00:06:22.582
Because you have to be
perfect 100% of the time

00:06:22.582 --> 00:06:26.886 align:start position:0%
and they only have to be perfect
or executable once, right

00:06:26.886 --> 00:06:30.156 align:start size:97% position:3%
to implement something
horrific in the U.S. homeland.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:33.226 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, we have a good pulse
of what they're doing

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:34.994 align:start size:81% position:19%
and where they
are, who they are,

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:36.229
but do we know all of them?

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.731
I can almost assure you
that the answer is no.

00:06:38.731 --> 00:06:43.603 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So, as they sort of push
what that red line is,

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:46.806 align:start size:97% position:3%
we've had a policy of what,
maybe the last 10 or 15 years,

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:49.342
at least the Obama policy,

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:52.512
we kinda let them do what
they wanted to do, right?

00:06:52.512 --> 00:06:54.147
And so now Trump
has kind of flipped

00:06:54.147 --> 00:06:55.448
this thing on it's head.

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:56.916
so what do you make
about the strike

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.718
and what is Trump doing here?

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:02.255
- Yeah, so the Supreme Leader
never saw this attack coming.

00:07:02.255 --> 00:07:04.223
He had buffaloed, as I say,

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:06.759
or my family says on a
ranch in Oregon, right?

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:11.397 align:start size:94% position:6%
They buffaloed Bush and
Obama for many, many years

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:12.865
that we had certain red lines,

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:15.101
that we didn't want to
start this World War III,

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.336
so we allowed them,
that is the Iranians,

00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:21.274 align:start size:97% position:3%
to do all kinds of poor,
terrible, horrific activities

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.009 align:start size:94% position:6%
throughout the Middle
East and indeed the world.

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:26.512 align:start size:94% position:6%
We would give them
enough leash to attack us

00:07:26.512 --> 00:07:28.281 align:start size:84% position:16%
through this Soleimani
and the Quds force

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.482
and Hezbollah and what not.

00:07:29.482 --> 00:07:31.150
- What were our red
lines, actually?

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.618
Like, what would
have been the thing

00:07:32.618 --> 00:07:35.555 align:start size:94% position:6%
that would've changed
the equation on our side?

00:07:35.555 --> 00:07:37.089
- Well, that really
is the question.

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:38.558
I don't think any
of us really knew,

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.226
certainly with inside the
Intelligence Community

00:07:40.226 --> 00:07:43.696 align:start size:97% position:3%
because we had the infamous
Obama red line in Syria

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:46.199
that, of course, we
just erased that one

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.834 align:start size:84% position:16%
and moved to
somewhere different.

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:50.603 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I don't think that
the Iranian leadership
ever quite knew

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:54.640 align:start size:97% position:3%
where the United States
would, the switch would flip,

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.108 align:start size:84% position:16%
other than an attack
in the homeland.

00:07:56.108 --> 00:07:58.478 align:start size:97% position:3%
Certainly they learned that
after the 9/11 attacks,

00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.179 align:start size:84% position:16%
when we immediately
went into Afghanistan.

00:08:00.179 --> 00:08:02.181
We started making
noise elsewhere.

00:08:02.181 --> 00:08:03.850
I think most of this
is public knowledge

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.652
but the Iranian government
very quietly reached out

00:08:06.652 --> 00:08:10.590 align:start size:94% position:6%
and said, look, we will
stay on the good boy list,

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.624
just don't invade.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:14.060
So the upshot is that they know

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.295 align:start size:88% position:13%
that we will hit a point
where we say, enough,

00:08:16.295 --> 00:08:18.197
and I don't think that
they thought Soleimani

00:08:18.197 --> 00:08:21.667
would be the, in all
of his shenanigans,

00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:23.135
would be it but here we are.

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:25.605 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Right, so what do you
make of what Trump did here?

00:08:25.605 --> 00:08:27.206
'Cause it's like, if you
listen to the critics,

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:29.041 align:start size:97% position:3%
it's like, "Oh, Trump
doesn't know what he's doing.

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:30.977 align:start size:97% position:3%
"There's no plan for after,"
et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:30.977 --> 00:08:32.245
And I'm starting to think,

00:08:32.245 --> 00:08:33.746
if this guy doesn't
know what he's doing

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:36.148 align:start size:97% position:3%
and he has no plans, what does
that say about the experts?

00:08:36.148 --> 00:08:37.083 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Right.
- 'Cause he keeps one-upping

00:08:37.083 --> 00:08:37.884 align:start size:75% position:25%
the experts,
(Bryan laughing)

00:08:37.884 --> 00:08:39.385
so what's going on here?

00:08:39.385 --> 00:08:40.887
- Yeah, so I think he did
the right thing, right?

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:43.322
So, I have friends who work in
the Special Forces community

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:46.659
and they were all universally
thrilled at what happened.

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:49.061
Soleimani has so much
blood on his hands,

00:08:49.061 --> 00:08:51.097 align:start size:84% position:16%
has maimed and
killed more people,

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:53.533 align:start size:84% position:16%
not just Americans
but Iraqis and others,

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:56.068
so the man earned his death.

00:08:56.068 --> 00:08:58.871
The question is,
so what comes next?

00:08:58.871 --> 00:09:00.106
And I think people
could rightfully

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:01.741
and should be asking
that question, right?

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.142 align:start size:84% position:16%
And is this gonna
cause World War III?

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:04.977
Some of that is hyperbole

00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:07.046 align:start size:97% position:3%
but some of it's
appropriate to at least ask.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:08.447
So, the answer is
no, we're not gonna

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:10.383
be going into World War III.

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.819 align:start size:97% position:3%
The only thing that would
change that calculus would be

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:16.656 align:start size:97% position:3%
whether Moscow and Beijing
suddenly started moving troops

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:20.026 align:start size:97% position:3%
into and, or backed Iran,
basically wanted to use them

00:09:20.026 --> 00:09:21.761
as some sort of
forcing function,

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:24.130 align:start size:84% position:16%
this incident, to
create World War III.

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.598 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Right.
- I don't think--

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:26.966 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You mean, they would move
their troops into Iran?

00:09:26.966 --> 00:09:28.968 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Precisely, I mean,
something grandiose like that.

00:09:28.968 --> 00:09:31.337
Now suddenly we're looking
at a very different prospect

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:33.239
of conflict on a global level

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:36.442 align:start size:88% position:13%
if Russia and China
moved into Iran, right?

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:37.643
- Right.

00:09:37.643 --> 00:09:39.111 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So, they have a
degree of relationship

00:09:39.111 --> 00:09:41.080 align:start size:94% position:6%
but I'm talking about
physical assets into Iran

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.082 align:start size:84% position:16%
to make clear that
this is the equivalent

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:45.384
of that World War
I assassination

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:47.353
of the prince in
Sarajevo, right,

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:48.554
that people keep talking about.

00:09:48.554 --> 00:09:51.757 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Just to be clear,
that's a pretty far off,

00:09:51.757 --> 00:09:53.292 align:start size:88% position:13%
crazy thing, although--
- Correct.

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:54.560
- If you're just listening
to the pundits these days,

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.828
it's like anything's
on the table, like,

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.063 align:start size:84% position:16%
the Martians are
landing and you know--

00:09:57.063 --> 00:09:58.531
- In the Intelligence Community,

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.499 align:start size:97% position:3%
we talk about low, medium,
and high degrees of confidence

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:02.335
that something could
happen, all right?

00:10:02.335 --> 00:10:03.569
I think that most
of us would say

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:05.204 align:start size:88% position:13%
that we have high degree
of confidence that it

00:10:05.204 --> 00:10:06.672
is extraordinarily unlikely

00:10:06.672 --> 00:10:09.108
that Russia and China
would ever get involved

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:10.543
in this kind of conflict.

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:12.411 align:start size:97% position:3%
One, because Russia's
economy's the size of Italy.

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:15.014 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean, they have a lot of
internal struggles themselves.

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:18.351
And China, fundamentally
President Xi is concerned

00:10:18.351 --> 00:10:22.421 align:start position:0%
about making sure that his
stability of his country remains

00:10:22.421 --> 00:10:23.689
the most important priority

00:10:23.689 --> 00:10:25.224
and then they continue
to grow economically.

00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:27.059
Because of the number of
people in that country,

00:10:27.059 --> 00:10:28.628 align:start size:94% position:6%
they need to have
continued economic growth

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:30.062 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
so that is their
focus and their goal,

00:10:30.062 --> 00:10:31.430 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and that's why they
want stability.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.232 line:0%
So for them to step
into this conflict

00:10:33.232 --> 00:10:35.034 line:0%
and create some sort
of horrific outcome

00:10:35.034 --> 00:10:36.202 line:0%
like World War III

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:38.037 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
is just extraordinarily
unlikely, right?

00:10:38.037 --> 00:10:39.338 align:start size:84% position:16%
In terms of degrees
of confidence,

00:10:39.338 --> 00:10:40.506
I would say we have
degree of confidence

00:10:40.506 --> 00:10:42.274
that's not going to happen.

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:45.878
So, the question is, what
will Iran do next, right?

00:10:45.878 --> 00:10:49.081
So you're going to see, and
folks are talking about this,

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.050
absolutely a degree of pushback,

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.686 align:start position:0%
whether it's from cyber
attacks, the usage of Hezbollah.

00:10:53.686 --> 00:10:55.154
They're already talking about,

00:10:55.154 --> 00:10:56.555 align:start size:94% position:6%
that is, the Iranian
leadership talking about,

00:10:56.555 --> 00:11:00.493 align:start size:84% position:16%
targeting military
personnel in locations

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.994
throughout the Middle
East in particular.

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:03.396
We expect that,

00:11:03.396 --> 00:11:04.630 align:start size:97% position:3%
the administration expected
that, the Pentagon,

00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:06.966
when they authorized the
strike, expected that.

00:11:06.966 --> 00:11:09.201
That's why you're seeing
this flood of personnel,

00:11:09.201 --> 00:11:11.671 align:start position:0%
a lot of my friends, going
into the Middle East right now.

00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:15.908
And that is to make the price
of any kind of retribution

00:11:15.908 --> 00:11:17.510
or any kind of attack by Iran,

00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:18.911
the price will go
up dramatically.

00:11:18.911 --> 00:11:20.212
- How do we send that message

00:11:20.212 --> 00:11:21.947
beyond bombs and killing people?

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:23.849 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like, do we actually
go on the ground

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:25.718
and talk to contacts and say,

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.387
"Guys, okay, you
saw what we did.

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:29.555
"We know you're planning

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:31.624 align:start size:84% position:16%
"to do a couple things
here and there."

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:34.093
But do we really
give the hint like,

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:35.895
well, I guess Trump sorta did
it with this tweet, right?

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:38.464
His tweet about 52
sites that we've got.

00:11:38.464 --> 00:11:39.765 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean, is that
really how it works?

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:41.467 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like, we get down
there and talk to them

00:11:41.467 --> 00:11:42.835
about that sorta thing?

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:44.103
- Well, I think that
the talking that was--

00:11:44.103 --> 00:11:45.371
- Like your house is
on a list, basically.

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:46.605
- Right (laughing).

00:11:46.605 --> 00:11:47.973 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well, I think the
talking that was done

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:50.643
was a missile going into
Soleimani's head, right?

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:52.244
And so I think that the
Trump administration

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:54.613 align:start size:97% position:3%
very wisely has said, look,
we have tried diplomacy

00:11:54.613 --> 00:11:56.649 align:start size:88% position:13%
with these clowns and
they've continually lied

00:11:56.649 --> 00:11:58.751 align:start size:84% position:16%
to us about, say,
their nuclear program.

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:01.387
If you recall, in
January of 2017,

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.355 align:start size:84% position:16%
Israel did an
incredible operation

00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:06.459 align:start size:97% position:3%
where they went into
Tehran, they grabbed a bunch

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.494
of nuclear material,
that is, I should say

00:12:08.494 --> 00:12:12.631 align:start size:97% position:3%
documentary-based material,
from this warehouse in Tehran,

00:12:12.631 --> 00:12:14.133
they took it back to Israel,

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:17.136
that basically showed that
Iran was playing a game.

00:12:17.136 --> 00:12:18.904 align:start size:84% position:16%
They wanted to make
sure that they held on

00:12:18.904 --> 00:12:20.339 align:start size:88% position:13%
to their nuclear
program and the ability

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:22.007 align:start size:84% position:16%
to move forward
very, very quickly.

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:23.976 align:start size:81% position:19%
So there's no ever
real intention

00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:27.580
by the regime to give up
that nuclear capability.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.416
- What do you make of sort of
the set of people that think

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:32.885
that just 'cause you sign
something, it has meaning?

00:12:32.885 --> 00:12:36.288 align:start size:94% position:6%
So, like the Iran nuclear
deal, just any deal.

00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:38.958
The Climate Paris Accord or
the Paris Climate Accords,

00:12:38.958 --> 00:12:41.694
like we sign something
and that inherently means

00:12:41.694 --> 00:12:43.963
that it's real but
that's really not how

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:45.931
the world works, is it?

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:49.001 align:start size:88% position:13%
- If you have a
document, an agreement,

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:52.404
a treaty that is signed,
it is only as effective

00:12:52.404 --> 00:12:55.341 align:start size:84% position:16%
as the parties engaged
or involved intend

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:56.642
to carry it forward, right?

00:12:56.642 --> 00:13:00.045
Particularly with some
degree of some hammer

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:01.313
if people fall short.

00:13:01.313 --> 00:13:02.681
I mean, this what we've
experienced with Russia

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:04.617 align:start size:88% position:13%
with the START treaties,
et cetera, right?

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:07.419 align:start size:97% position:3%
They were constantly cheating
because they believed

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:08.954 align:start size:84% position:16%
that the United States
wouldn't respond

00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:11.423 align:start size:84% position:16%
in any kind of intense
or retaliatory way,

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:13.826 align:start size:97% position:3%
whether it be sanctions
beyond what we've already done

00:13:13.826 --> 00:13:16.295
to something more kinetic,
right, a military strike.

00:13:16.295 --> 00:13:18.697
So everybody who signs
any kind of document

00:13:18.697 --> 00:13:21.333
is always sitting back
and making the calculus

00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:23.669
or asking, can we
push this further?

00:13:23.669 --> 00:13:24.503
Can we do more?

00:13:24.503 --> 00:13:25.704
Can we sneak, right?

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:26.906 align:start size:84% position:16%
North Korea with
this nuclear program

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:28.674
is a great example
of doing exactly that

00:13:28.674 --> 00:13:30.543
and it's gotten away
with lying to the world

00:13:30.543 --> 00:13:32.044
and continuing to march forward,

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:34.146
irrespective of the silly
sanctions that we apply.

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:35.347 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's what you were
talking about earlier about,

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:36.816 align:start size:84% position:16%
you just keep
pushing the red line.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.284 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Correct.
- Because if you know the guy

00:13:38.284 --> 00:13:39.518 align:start size:97% position:3%
on the other side isn't
gonna ever gonna push back,

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:42.021
you can move that thing
pretty signficantly.

00:13:42.021 --> 00:13:43.522
- But I think it's important

00:13:43.522 --> 00:13:46.025
and I think you and I have
spoken about it previously,

00:13:46.025 --> 00:13:47.726
we hear a lot right
now in the media.

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:49.361
Folks are talking
about, you know,

00:13:49.361 --> 00:13:50.696
get us out of the Middle East.

00:13:50.696 --> 00:13:51.997
Get us out of Iran and Iraq

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:54.366
and all these places,
we shouldn't be there.

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:56.435
And that's true, we
shouldn't be there.

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:58.003 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah.
- Why are we there, right?

00:13:58.003 --> 00:14:00.206
- You're giving me a lot of my
good Libertarian side, right?

00:14:00.206 --> 00:14:01.073
- So, let's have
that conversation.

00:14:01.073 --> 00:14:02.575 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Yeah.
- So, it's good

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:04.877
that we killed Soleimani,
that the government in Iran

00:14:04.877 --> 00:14:07.346
is bad, but why in
the hell are we there

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:08.514
to begin with, right?

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:11.016 align:start size:84% position:16%
We are there because
Iran and Iraq

00:14:11.016 --> 00:14:13.419
and the Middle East
have oil, right?

00:14:13.419 --> 00:14:14.653
All these countries have oil.

00:14:14.653 --> 00:14:16.856 align:start size:81% position:19%
The global economy
is built on oil

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.157
so it's great the United States

00:14:18.157 --> 00:14:21.594 align:start size:88% position:13%
has become a net
exporter of oil, super,

00:14:21.594 --> 00:14:24.263 align:start size:97% position:3%
but the rest of the world
continues to be net importers.

00:14:24.263 --> 00:14:28.267
So, as long as these folks,
whether it be Iran or Iraq,

00:14:28.267 --> 00:14:30.769
either control the oil or,
through the Strait of Hormuz,

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:34.206
they control the ability of
that oil to get to market,

00:14:34.206 --> 00:14:36.709 align:start size:84% position:16%
we are stuck in
the sandbox, right?

00:14:36.709 --> 00:14:38.811 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, if we want to change
this conversation,

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:40.613
if we want to basically
make the Middle East

00:14:40.613 --> 00:14:42.681
the equivalent of what, you
know, happened in the '90s

00:14:42.681 --> 00:14:44.350
in Rwanda where the
Hutus and the Tutsis

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:45.851
were killing each other,

00:14:45.851 --> 00:14:47.853
if we want to let the Sunnis
and Shias slaughter each other

00:14:47.853 --> 00:14:50.322 align:start size:84% position:16%
and really, the
world doesn't care,

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:53.058 align:start size:84% position:16%
then we have to remove
the impetus for us

00:14:53.058 --> 00:14:53.893
to be there in the first place.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.160
Why do we care?

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.328
We have to change
our energy policy.

00:14:56.328 --> 00:14:58.264 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, if you're angry
about the fact

00:14:58.264 --> 00:15:00.099 align:start size:97% position:3%
that we're in the Middle East
and we have troops there,

00:15:00.099 --> 00:15:02.835 align:start position:0%
then you have to be onboard
with changing our energy policy.

00:15:02.835 --> 00:15:04.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So, what do you
make of the argument,

00:15:04.436 --> 00:15:05.571
so you can do it two ways.

00:15:05.571 --> 00:15:07.072
So, the Libertarian argument

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:08.841
is just get the hell out of
there, these aren't our wars,

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:11.076
these are sectarian conflicts
that have existed forever,

00:15:11.076 --> 00:15:13.612 align:start size:97% position:3%
they're gonna last longer
than we're ever gonna exist.

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:15.114
That's one side of it.

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:17.483
The other side is, well, you
broke it, you fix it, sort of.

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:19.718
So, it's like, Iraq, we actually

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:21.320
were turning it
around, you know?

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.289 align:start size:84% position:16%
Regardless of
whether you thought

00:15:23.289 --> 00:15:24.924
it was a good idea
to go in or not,

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:26.458 align:start size:97% position:3%
weapons of mass
destruction, the rest of it,

00:15:26.458 --> 00:15:29.528
they were having free and
fair elections basically

00:15:29.528 --> 00:15:31.430
and then we just left.

00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.564
You know, we announced the date.

00:15:32.564 --> 00:15:34.266 align:start size:88% position:13%
Obama said we're
getting out on this day.

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.302
We left and then it fell apart.

00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:38.137
How do we negotiate that?

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:41.874 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So, you have to sit
back and ask the question,

00:15:41.874 --> 00:15:43.409 align:start size:84% position:16%
from a foreign
policy perspective,

00:15:43.409 --> 00:15:45.344 align:start size:84% position:16%
why the hell are we
involved in the world?

00:15:45.344 --> 00:15:46.946
What is our ultimate goal?

00:15:46.946 --> 00:15:49.415
And most smart people will say

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:52.384
that we want the world
to be more democratic,

00:15:52.384 --> 00:15:54.586 align:start size:88% position:13%
because the more
democratic the world is,

00:15:54.586 --> 00:15:56.956
the less likely that the
nations who are democracies

00:15:56.956 --> 00:15:59.058 align:start size:88% position:13%
will get involved in
conflict and war, right?

00:15:59.058 --> 00:16:00.693
So, this is sort of
foreign policy 101.

00:16:00.693 --> 00:16:02.895
So, the question is,
how do you move nations

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:05.297 align:start size:84% position:16%
from being autocratic
or anything less

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:07.533 align:start size:84% position:16%
than a full democracy
to some shade

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:10.002
or variation of a
healthy democracy?

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:12.304 align:start position:0%
You know, President Bush's
idea, the neoconservative belief

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.473
was we can do it via
the barrel of a gun.

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.507
Well, oops.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:17.142
That didn't work out right?

00:16:17.142 --> 00:16:19.745
Not only did they
view us ultimately

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:21.880
as outsiders invading the nation

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:23.015
but they weren't really ready

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:25.617 align:start size:84% position:16%
for a true commitment
to democracy,

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:28.854
which requires a degree of
education of the people,

00:16:28.854 --> 00:16:31.056 align:start size:97% position:3%
right, to understand what
their obligations are, right?

00:16:31.056 --> 00:16:32.558
- But that's what I'm saying.

00:16:32.558 --> 00:16:34.026
If we had stayed longer, and
I'm not saying we should have,

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:37.196
but have we stayed longer,
once they had some elections,

00:16:37.196 --> 00:16:39.231
had we stayed longer to
build some institutions

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:42.134
and that sort of thing, it's
almost like it could've worked.

00:16:42.134 --> 00:16:44.036
There were signs that
it could've worked.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.605 align:start position:0%
- But what is the ultimate
benefit for the American people

00:16:46.605 --> 00:16:48.040
to go in and nation build

00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:50.309
in a place like Iraq
or any nation, right?

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:51.844 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, we have to ask
ourselves the questions,

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:52.945 align:start size:84% position:16%
as there are
hundreds and hundreds

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.179
of nations around the world,

00:16:54.179 --> 00:16:55.414
many of which are
not democratic,

00:16:55.414 --> 00:16:56.782
why are we gonna get
involved in that one?

00:16:56.782 --> 00:16:57.983 align:start size:84% position:16%
And one of things
that I actually think

00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:00.652 align:start size:84% position:16%
that President Trump
does correctly,

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:03.789 align:start size:88% position:13%
perhaps in his New
York braggadocious way,

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.124
is he says, "Well, what
are they giving us?"

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:06.859
Like, what do we
get in exchange?

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:08.027
And that's actually a good

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.862 align:start size:84% position:16%
and important thing
to ask, right?

00:17:09.862 --> 00:17:12.831 align:start size:97% position:3%
Because we shouldn't be
going into Zimbabwe, right,

00:17:12.831 --> 00:17:15.701 align:start size:84% position:16%
and trying to correct
all of the ills

00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:18.170
of Mugabe and all his
shenanigans, right?

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:19.038
Because what are they giving us?

00:17:19.038 --> 00:17:20.272
Nothing.

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:21.306
We would invest our
time and treasure

00:17:21.306 --> 00:17:22.841
into a place like Zimbabwe

00:17:22.841 --> 00:17:24.376
and we would be getting very
little to nothing in return,

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.912
other than a commitment to
the world and to ourselves

00:17:26.912 --> 00:17:28.280
and the Zimbabwean people

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.648
that we're creating
a democracy there,

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:32.051
and more democracy means
less global war, right?

00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:33.519
So, we have to rack and stack

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:35.087
or prioritize where we're
involved in the world.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:37.389 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, Iraq and Iran, the reason
that we want to be there,

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:39.425 align:start size:84% position:16%
why we give two bits
about the place,

00:17:39.425 --> 00:17:43.495 align:start size:97% position:3%
is because of this commitment,
not only just to democracy

00:17:43.495 --> 00:17:44.997
but because they have
something we need,

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:47.132 align:start size:94% position:6%
they have, and not just
we but the global economy.

00:17:47.132 --> 00:17:48.967
So, if you were to
withdraw, right,

00:17:48.967 --> 00:17:50.436
and just completely
let the place go

00:17:50.436 --> 00:17:53.672
and be as it is, you
better have a back up

00:17:53.672 --> 00:17:55.174 align:start size:84% position:16%
in terms of a
global energy policy

00:17:55.174 --> 00:17:56.375
that doesn't require that stuff,

00:17:56.375 --> 00:17:59.078 align:start size:84% position:16%
because if that price
of oil quadruples

00:17:59.078 --> 00:18:01.947
or goes up by 10,
20%, or at times,

00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:03.482
whatever number it might be

00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:06.051
and you start having global
recessions and depressions,

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:11.056 align:start size:94% position:6%
now we understand the cost
of our inaction, right?

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:13.425 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, there is a cost to just
completely pulling out.

00:18:13.425 --> 00:18:14.693
- Are you kind of surprised

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:17.396
that Trump seems to
understand all this?

00:18:17.396 --> 00:18:18.230
- No.

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.698
- In a weird way.

00:18:19.698 --> 00:18:22.668
- No, I have had concerns
about his temperament.

00:18:22.668 --> 00:18:24.169
I have--

00:18:24.169 --> 00:18:25.404
- By the way, wait, we should
pause for a moment and say,

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:26.905
you are a lifelong Democrat.

00:18:26.905 --> 00:18:28.373
- Yeah, here we are.

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:29.875
- I know the feeling, my friend.

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:31.143
(Men laughing)

00:18:31.143 --> 00:18:32.311 align:start size:88% position:13%
Here we are so.
- Although I don't know

00:18:32.311 --> 00:18:33.812 align:start size:88% position:13%
what that means anymore.
- Yeah.

00:18:33.812 --> 00:18:34.746
- What does it even mean
to be a Democrat anymore?

00:18:34.746 --> 00:18:36.248
- We'll get to that in a sec,

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:36.915
'cause you wrote a great--
- We'll get there, yeah.

00:18:36.915 --> 00:18:38.183
It's a disaster.

00:18:38.183 --> 00:18:39.118
- You wrote a great
piece on foxnews.com

00:18:39.118 --> 00:18:40.352
about the split of the Democrats

00:18:40.352 --> 00:18:41.553
and I've been screaming
about this for years.

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:43.589 align:start size:84% position:16%
But why do you think
Trump gets this?

00:18:43.589 --> 00:18:46.391
Like, he's not a politician,
he wasn't a foreign policy guy.

00:18:46.391 --> 00:18:47.826
If you asked him five years ago

00:18:47.826 --> 00:18:49.094
to put his finger on a map,

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:50.562
who knows what he
would have found?

00:18:50.562 --> 00:18:52.998
I mean, what is it about him
that you think understands this

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:55.167
or is he listening
to better generals

00:18:55.167 --> 00:18:56.502
than the guys before
were listening to?

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:57.703
Like, what's going on here?

00:18:57.703 --> 00:18:59.171
- Well, a couple things.

00:18:59.171 --> 00:19:01.840 align:start position:0%
How do we diagnose why President
Trump is the way that he is

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.242
and indeed that he's effective.

00:19:03.242 --> 00:19:04.476 align:start size:94% position:6%
I think we could probably
(Dave laughing)

00:19:04.476 --> 00:19:05.444
have a three hour
program on that

00:19:05.444 --> 00:19:06.645
but the upshot is,

00:19:06.645 --> 00:19:07.846 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think the American
people recognize

00:19:07.846 --> 00:19:10.082 align:start size:84% position:16%
that something was
important in that man,

00:19:10.082 --> 00:19:11.583
that he could serve
an important role,

00:19:11.583 --> 00:19:13.252
and that is the fact
that he is basically

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.220 align:start size:84% position:16%
a walking human
firecracker, right?

00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:17.556 align:start size:94% position:6%
And he went to Washington
to just blow stuff up

00:19:17.556 --> 00:19:19.558
because most of us were
sick and tired of the way

00:19:19.558 --> 00:19:21.059
that Washington was working.

00:19:21.059 --> 00:19:22.661
And we might talk about,
all right, can we have him

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:24.129
a little bit more Presidential?

00:19:24.129 --> 00:19:25.397 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well, when you
elect a firecracker,

00:19:25.397 --> 00:19:27.166 align:start size:84% position:16%
you're gonna get
what you get, right?

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:30.836 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, what I think
that he is doing well

00:19:30.836 --> 00:19:32.971
is he's asking really
important questions

00:19:32.971 --> 00:19:34.606 align:start size:81% position:19%
that Washington
has always assumed

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:36.241
that we've asked and answered.

00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:38.043
Like, well, of course, we're
gonna be absolutely committed

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:39.444
to NATO at all times.

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:41.113
Well, wait a minute.

00:19:41.113 --> 00:19:43.782 align:start size:84% position:16%
These a-holes aren't
contributing, you
know, their dues.

00:19:43.782 --> 00:19:45.584
So what, are we gonna
continue to pay for it?

00:19:45.584 --> 00:19:46.752
Like, go F yourself.

00:19:46.752 --> 00:19:48.053 align:start size:88% position:13%
I mean, that's basically
Trump's attitude.

00:19:48.053 --> 00:19:49.488
And it's like yeah, yeah,

00:19:49.488 --> 00:19:51.356 align:start size:94% position:6%
that's exactly what should
be happening, right?

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.492
There should be nothing
so sacred on the table

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:55.727
that we can't ask
a question as to,

00:19:55.727 --> 00:19:56.929
well, why are we
doing it that way?

00:19:56.929 --> 00:19:58.764 align:start size:84% position:16%
So, I think that
that is a good thing

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.933
that the President is
bringing to the table

00:20:00.933 --> 00:20:04.203 align:start position:0%
and I think that he is bringing
that outsider's perspective

00:20:04.203 --> 00:20:06.838
and asking really good
questions that might seem

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:10.142
to be crazy to the New
York and Washington elite

00:20:10.142 --> 00:20:11.743
but I should think most
people in middle America

00:20:11.743 --> 00:20:13.245 align:start size:81% position:19%
are like, yeah,
we agree with you.

00:20:13.245 --> 00:20:14.580
That makes sense, right?

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:16.615 align:start size:81% position:19%
- All right, so
with that in mind,

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:19.751 align:start size:97% position:3%
so Trump comes in basically
as the firecracker

00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:22.287 line:0%
to throw the chessboard
up, the whole thing.

00:20:23.755 --> 00:20:26.158 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
The administrative
state or the deep state

00:20:26.158 --> 00:20:28.026 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
or maybe you have a
different phrase for it.

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:29.561 line:0%
- [Bryan] Deep state works.

00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:33.832 line:0%
- This idea of a constant
group of people that stay,

00:20:33.832 --> 00:20:35.834 align:start size:97% position:3%
no matter what administration
comes and goes.

00:20:35.834 --> 00:20:37.369 align:start size:84% position:16%
Can you just
explain a little bit

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:39.471
about what that actually is?

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:40.572
(Bryan inhaling)

00:20:40.572 --> 00:20:41.406
- Lord have mercy.

00:20:41.406 --> 00:20:42.941
All right.

00:20:42.941 --> 00:20:44.243
(Dave laughing)

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:46.912
So, folks who get
their, those jobs,

00:20:46.912 --> 00:20:49.881
you are there for
20, 25, 30 years,

00:20:49.881 --> 00:20:53.518 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it's true that you
outlast all administrations.

00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:54.686
- So, what are these jobs?

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:55.887
Like, let's really do

00:20:55.887 --> 00:20:57.422 align:start size:97% position:3%
like the most base level here.
- Yeah.

00:20:57.422 --> 00:20:58.991
'Cause this is the type of
thing, you hear deep state,

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:01.260
and everyone online, you're
either a conspiracy theorist

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.029
or an Alex Jones guy or
give me something like,

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:05.964 align:start size:84% position:16%
what are these people
actually doing?

00:21:05.964 --> 00:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
- All right, so, when you,
let's just take the CIA, right?

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.837
So, someone like me who went
in as an Operations Officer,

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:13.338 align:start size:94% position:6%
so somebody who basically
goes out in the field

00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:15.807
and recruits spies and
steals secrets, right?

00:21:15.807 --> 00:21:18.010
You have a tremendous
amount of power, right?

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.545 align:start size:97% position:3%
A tremendous number of tools
to read people's emails,

00:21:20.545 --> 00:21:21.813
listen to people's phone calls,

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:23.715
I mean, you can call
up surveillance teams,

00:21:23.715 --> 00:21:27.486
you have a lot of power to
do or accomplish the mission

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:31.223 align:start size:97% position:3%
and through that, some people
have this mistaken belief

00:21:31.223 --> 00:21:35.694
that they are now anointed
to make decisions writ large

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:37.195
in terms of foreign policy.

00:21:37.195 --> 00:21:39.398 align:start size:94% position:6%
That is, they are the ones
that have the knowledge

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:41.033
to decide what the nation
should or shouldn't do

00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:44.369 align:start size:97% position:3%
on a particular issue,
instead of simply informing

00:21:44.369 --> 00:21:46.438 align:start position:0%
a policy maker, to say,
"Here's what I know to be true.

00:21:46.438 --> 00:21:47.973 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Here's what I
think we ought to do

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:49.274
"but here are a slew
of different options

00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:51.410
"and you make the
choice or the call

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.178 align:start size:97% position:3%
"because you are a
representative of the people

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:54.680
"and I am simply a tool."

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.748
- So basically, they
sort of have access

00:21:56.748 --> 00:22:00.285
to all of this information
and then after years of it,

00:22:00.285 --> 00:22:01.853 align:start size:81% position:19%
you start thinking
you're bigger--

00:22:01.853 --> 00:22:03.121
- [Bryan] That's right.

00:22:03.121 --> 00:22:04.523
- Than the people that
are coming and going.

00:22:04.523 --> 00:22:06.258 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So, one of the most
infamous spies, Aldrich Ames,

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:07.993
worked for the CIA
but indeed worked

00:22:07.993 --> 00:22:10.295
for the Russians secretly,
was eventually found out.

00:22:10.295 --> 00:22:14.166 align:start position:0%
It led to over 100 individuals,
assets, being killed.

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.068
When he was asked why he did it,

00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:19.371
he said, "I know what's best
for the nation's foreign policy

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:21.573
"and I'm gonna act on that."

00:22:21.573 --> 00:22:23.575
So, that degree of hubris...

00:22:23.575 --> 00:22:26.478
Right, you go in loving your
country, embracing the flag,

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:28.547
you're there at the CIA
for the right reasons

00:22:28.547 --> 00:22:30.182 align:start size:88% position:13%
but now suddenly, you've
come to this belief

00:22:30.182 --> 00:22:32.551
that you are anointed,
that you are somehow

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:34.753
the guardian of the republic,

00:22:34.753 --> 00:22:39.758
beyond the defensive
nature that the people,

00:22:40.892 --> 00:22:42.661 align:start size:84% position:16%
your government
has anointed on you

00:22:42.661 --> 00:22:44.796
to actually do good things,
to support the constitution,

00:22:44.796 --> 00:22:46.665
and support policymakers.

00:22:46.665 --> 00:22:48.100 align:start size:81% position:19%
Now you think that
you're actually

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.335
a king or a queen
behind the scenes

00:22:50.335 --> 00:22:53.338
and you will move
the levers of power

00:22:53.338 --> 00:22:55.307
and you will decide
who gets briefed

00:22:55.307 --> 00:22:56.975
on what pieces of information

00:22:56.975 --> 00:22:59.511 align:start size:94% position:6%
or you don't brief certain
pieces of information.

00:22:59.511 --> 00:23:01.012
Let me give you an example

00:23:01.012 --> 00:23:04.216
So, I worked an issue that
I can't talk a ton about

00:23:04.216 --> 00:23:06.118
but an Asia-related concern,

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:07.953 align:start size:88% position:13%
and what we were
briefing the White House

00:23:07.953 --> 00:23:09.588
was that what we as
the CIA were doing,

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:11.156
in terms of covert
action operations,

00:23:11.156 --> 00:23:13.492
were incredibly successful.

00:23:13.492 --> 00:23:15.627 align:start size:88% position:13%
But I actually knewthat
that wasn't true,

00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:16.895
so I sat down with the analysts

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:19.097
and I said, "Help
me understand why

00:23:19.097 --> 00:23:20.832
"you all make this judgment."

00:23:20.832 --> 00:23:22.033 align:start size:88% position:13%
They're like, "We don't
make that judgment.

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:23.735
"We don't believe that's true."

00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:26.405
So, I collated all
this information, I
presented it to our,

00:23:26.405 --> 00:23:28.273
what we call the 7th floor,

00:23:28.273 --> 00:23:31.176 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I said, "Sirs,
what we are presenting

00:23:31.176 --> 00:23:34.379
"to the White House
as effective isn't,"

00:23:34.379 --> 00:23:36.815
and they said, "Well, you
know," this song and dance,

00:23:36.815 --> 00:23:38.283
and then they said,

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:39.885 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Look, why don't you brief
that downtown," right?

00:23:39.885 --> 00:23:42.988
Knowing that I had absolutely
no ability to do that, right?

00:23:42.988 --> 00:23:46.358 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, they just sort of, it
took an issue that they knew

00:23:46.358 --> 00:23:48.894
would be problematic for
the agency, for themselves,

00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:52.030
they lied about it to the
NSC and to the White House,

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:56.268
and they decided what was best
for America's foreign policy

00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:57.836
as it relates to that
particular country

00:23:57.836 --> 00:23:59.137
and that particular issue

00:23:59.137 --> 00:24:00.539
around weapons of
mass destruction.

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:04.476 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, it's a tiny little
example of how the deep state

00:24:04.476 --> 00:24:07.679
can decide what a nation
should or shouldn't do.

00:24:07.679 --> 00:24:10.582 align:start size:88% position:13%
The rubric that I
think has been crossed,

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:12.951 align:start size:88% position:13%
that kind of stuff is
more typical Washington.

00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:16.655 align:start size:88% position:13%
What hasn't happened,
certainly in my lifetime

00:24:16.655 --> 00:24:20.192 align:start size:97% position:3%
or my recollection, is a
guy like Brennan and Clapper

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:24.062
deciding that a politician
or someone running as one,

00:24:24.062 --> 00:24:26.965
President Trump in this case,
candidate Trump in this case,

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:30.836
was not good enough to
assume the presidency.

00:24:30.836 --> 00:24:35.774
So, they were doing things
to kneecap his administration

00:24:35.774 --> 00:24:37.742
before, I should
say, his election,

00:24:37.742 --> 00:24:39.778
his ability to become
an elected official.

00:24:39.778 --> 00:24:41.546 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, can you
explain a little bit

00:24:41.546 --> 00:24:43.548
about what these
guys were doing?

00:24:43.548 --> 00:24:44.916 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So, let's just start
with the dossier.

00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:46.651 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah.
- All right because to me--

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:47.719
- You've had tweets
deleted over this.

00:24:47.719 --> 00:24:49.855 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Yeah.
- I mean, Twitter tried

00:24:49.855 --> 00:24:51.122 align:start size:94% position:6%
to boot you and ban you--
- Twice.

00:24:51.122 --> 00:24:53.992
Because you started,
as a former CIA guy,

00:24:53.992 --> 00:24:56.895
you started talking about
what Brennan was up to,

00:24:56.895 --> 00:24:58.396
what these guys were doing,

00:24:58.396 --> 00:25:00.499
and they were gonna
boot you off Twitter

00:25:00.499 --> 00:25:02.133
and then eventually there
was enough of a outcry.

00:25:02.133 --> 00:25:03.635
I tried to help as
much as I could--

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:05.036
- And you did, thank you.
- to get you back on there.

00:25:05.036 --> 00:25:06.238
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:25:06.238 --> 00:25:08.073 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, all right, if we
just look at the dossier

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:10.242 align:start size:94% position:6%
we knew for a considerable
amount of time

00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:13.044 align:start size:97% position:3%
that this information was
unvetted and uncorroborated.

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:15.747
It was internet rumor, I think,

00:25:15.747 --> 00:25:17.482
is what was in the
IG report, right?

00:25:17.482 --> 00:25:19.718
So, it was well known
that this was garbage

00:25:19.718 --> 00:25:23.488
but yet, it was utilized by the
FBI to continue surveillance

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:25.423
of a Trump campaign official.

00:25:25.423 --> 00:25:28.293
- So this is before the
election, this dossier,

00:25:28.293 --> 00:25:30.328
which is basically
an internet rumor,

00:25:30.328 --> 00:25:34.366 align:start size:94% position:6%
is now used so the CIA
can use spying techniques.

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:35.700
- Let me just tell you

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.569 align:start size:97% position:3%
how absolutely crazy this was.
- I'm just trying

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:38.770
to dumb it down, yeah.

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.640
- We had a foreign
spy that was hired by

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.109
a domestic political opponent

00:25:44.109 --> 00:25:46.311
inject this garbage
into the system,

00:25:46.311 --> 00:25:47.879
which if you work in
intelligence field,

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:50.081
you know that any
Russian sources

00:25:50.081 --> 00:25:53.618
are oftentimes controlled by
Vladimir Putin, the SVR, right?

00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:55.353
So, unless you really
vet the information--

00:25:55.353 --> 00:25:56.988
- They're smart enough
to have double agents?

00:25:56.988 --> 00:25:58.857
- Oh, amazing, isn't it?
- Jesus, these Russians.

00:25:58.857 --> 00:26:01.192
- So, we're pumping
this fake garbage

00:26:01.192 --> 00:26:03.261 align:start size:94% position:6%
that we haven't vetted
into the political system,

00:26:03.261 --> 00:26:06.331 align:start size:84% position:16%
we're using it for
surveillance purposes,

00:26:06.331 --> 00:26:10.969 align:start position:0%
and now, and here's the kicker,
in early January of 2017,

00:26:10.969 --> 00:26:12.938
they, Clapper and
Comey and Brennan,

00:26:12.938 --> 00:26:15.974 align:start size:84% position:16%
leaked this dossier
to the press,

00:26:15.974 --> 00:26:17.609 align:start size:94% position:6%
which it had already been
circulating out there

00:26:17.609 --> 00:26:20.312 align:start size:94% position:6%
but giving it their stamp
of, we know it exists

00:26:20.312 --> 00:26:21.580 align:start size:81% position:19%
and we're gonna
brief this, right?

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:24.349
So, they briefed it to
President-elect Trump

00:26:24.349 --> 00:26:26.184
and the very act of doing that

00:26:26.184 --> 00:26:28.553
and saying, "Hey, you should
be aware that this exists,"

00:26:28.553 --> 00:26:32.223
suddenly gave the hook for the
press to run with this story

00:26:32.223 --> 00:26:34.859
that we have a Russian agent
sitting in the White House.

00:26:34.859 --> 00:26:37.329
The FBI and the CIA, you
know, they believed enough

00:26:37.329 --> 00:26:41.499
in this document to brief
it, and then of course,

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:43.168
the fire was set, right?

00:26:43.168 --> 00:26:44.869 align:start size:88% position:13%
The brush fire took off.
- Yeah.

00:26:44.869 --> 00:26:47.205
- The hysteria was launched.

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:49.774
But what's amazing is
the next number of days

00:26:49.774 --> 00:26:53.044
and the next couple of weeks,
every one of those bastards,

00:26:53.044 --> 00:26:55.880 align:start size:94% position:6%
Comey and Clapper,
Brennan, all of them said,

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.049 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Oh, but you know, the
dossier, we don't believe it.

00:26:58.049 --> 00:26:59.951
"It's just rumors."

00:26:59.951 --> 00:27:01.152
Well, then why'd you brief it?

00:27:01.152 --> 00:27:02.654
Why did you spread
it around Washington?

00:27:02.654 --> 00:27:05.890
Because you knew that it
would cause a brush fire.

00:27:05.890 --> 00:27:07.959
You knew it would set
this nation on fire

00:27:07.959 --> 00:27:10.228 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you knew that
the Trump presidency

00:27:10.228 --> 00:27:11.730
would likely never
recover from it.

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.066 align:start size:97% position:3%
And in fact, John Brennan told
a crowd here in Los Angeles

00:27:15.066 --> 00:27:17.369 align:start size:94% position:6%
that President Trump would
no longer be in office,

00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:20.939
an interview he gave,
by the end of 2018.

00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:22.440 align:start size:88% position:13%
He told a bunch of
these Hollywood elites,

00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.675
"Don't worry about it,

00:27:23.675 --> 00:27:25.577
"Trump's gonna be gone
by the end of 2018."

00:27:25.577 --> 00:27:27.078
Thank God John Brennan was gone

00:27:27.078 --> 00:27:29.681
and now he's under criminal
investigation by AG Barr.

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:30.649
- So, that was my next question.

00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:31.816
- Chef's kiss.

00:27:31.816 --> 00:27:34.519 align:start size:84% position:16%
- How (laughing)
nervous should Clapper

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:36.655
and Brennan and Comey be?

00:27:36.655 --> 00:27:38.490
I mean, Clapper is the
guy who lied under oath

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.892 align:start size:88% position:13%
when they asked him
about, are we, you know,

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:44.329
doing mass surveillance on
people, on our own citizens?

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:46.531 align:start size:88% position:13%
And what was it, "Not
wittingly," that he said

00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:47.999
as he was scratching
the top of his head,

00:27:47.999 --> 00:27:49.567
which you ever see that
episode of Seinfeld?

00:27:49.567 --> 00:27:50.835
You know, when you're lying,

00:27:50.835 --> 00:27:52.303
the higher up on your
face that you scratch

00:27:52.303 --> 00:27:53.838
tells you if it's
a big lie or not?

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.740
I mean, he's literally
going, "Not wittingly."

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:57.008
- Right, right, yeah,

00:27:57.008 --> 00:27:58.977
and oddly enough his
nose starts growing.

00:27:58.977 --> 00:28:01.813 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah but then becomes
like a CNN analyst on this

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:04.816 align:start size:97% position:3%
and suffers no ramifications
for lying under oath.

00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:07.452 align:start size:97% position:3%
How much trouble do you think
these guys really are in?

00:28:07.452 --> 00:28:09.521 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I think they're in a lot
and I think that they know it.

00:28:09.521 --> 00:28:12.123 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I am, as an American,
forget my party affiliation,

00:28:12.123 --> 00:28:13.892
forget me having
worked in the CIA,

00:28:13.892 --> 00:28:15.960
although that's a
part of my anger

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.028
because I know what they've done

00:28:17.028 --> 00:28:18.496
to the Intelligence Community.

00:28:18.496 --> 00:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
They have now made the American
people reasonably concerned

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.401
about the degree
of politicization

00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:25.470
that they weren't aware of or
that they thought would be,

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.172
might be impossible.

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:29.474 align:start size:97% position:3%
So, they have really sullied
not only the reputation

00:28:29.474 --> 00:28:32.210
but the ability of the
FBI and the CIA to go out

00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:33.778
and do the good work
that they need to do.

00:28:33.778 --> 00:28:36.181 align:start size:84% position:16%
We do, in fact, need
an FBI and a CIA

00:28:36.181 --> 00:28:38.416 align:start size:81% position:19%
to do the good
work that they do.

00:28:38.416 --> 00:28:41.052
But it's reasonable for an
American to sit back and say,

00:28:41.052 --> 00:28:42.454 align:start size:81% position:19%
maybe we shouldn't
have these guys

00:28:42.454 --> 00:28:43.888
'cause they're so
highly politicized.

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:46.124 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, I think that Brennan
and Comey and Clapper

00:28:46.124 --> 00:28:47.659 align:start size:84% position:16%
and that whole cabal
that was involved

00:28:47.659 --> 00:28:50.261 align:start size:97% position:3%
in these shenanigans in
2016 should be very worried.

00:28:50.261 --> 00:28:52.530 align:start size:84% position:16%
John Durham, a very,
very smart man,

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:54.999 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I think AG Barr is playing
the long game on this one.

00:28:54.999 --> 00:28:57.736
I think he's letting Comey go
on some of the smaller stuff.

00:28:57.736 --> 00:28:59.838
I mean, he's hitting
him hard in some areas

00:28:59.838 --> 00:29:02.640
and the IG has called him,
you know, a dangerous man,

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.476 align:start size:84% position:16%
a man who set a
dangerous precedent

00:29:04.476 --> 00:29:07.746 align:start position:0%
for the 30 plus thousand former
and current FBI employees

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:09.481 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I think you're gonna
find the same thing

00:29:09.481 --> 00:29:12.817
with Clapper and Brennan
when this is all over.

00:29:12.817 --> 00:29:14.486 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So, if these guys
did so much bad stuff,

00:29:14.486 --> 00:29:16.788 align:start size:97% position:3%
what do you make of the fact
that they don't shut up?

00:29:16.788 --> 00:29:17.822
Like, what do you
make of the fact

00:29:17.822 --> 00:29:19.190
that Comey wrote the book,

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:21.459 align:start size:97% position:3%
which nobody bought the book--
- He teaches ethics!

00:29:21.459 --> 00:29:22.694
- But they push it out.
- Comey teaches ethics,

00:29:22.694 --> 00:29:24.195
what is happening in this world?

00:29:24.195 --> 00:29:25.563 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Or look at Brennan's
Twitter feed?

00:29:25.563 --> 00:29:26.731
It's just like, wait a minute?

00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.466
You were the head of the CIA,

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:29.868
I don't think you should be,

00:29:29.868 --> 00:29:32.137 align:start position:0%
like you're basically attacking
one of the institutions,

00:29:32.137 --> 00:29:33.371
the Office of the Presidency.

00:29:33.371 --> 00:29:34.639
Now I get it, Trump
attacks everybody too

00:29:34.639 --> 00:29:37.175 align:start size:88% position:13%
so there's nobody that's
totally clean here.

00:29:37.175 --> 00:29:39.577 align:start size:84% position:16%
But you look at
Brennan's Twitter feed

00:29:39.577 --> 00:29:41.813 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it's like,
what are you doing?

00:29:43.248 --> 00:29:45.150
But I guess they feel that
they'll never be caught.

00:29:45.150 --> 00:29:47.085 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well, here's I think
what's happening.

00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:50.388
You have Comey and
Clapper and Brennan,

00:29:50.388 --> 00:29:52.323
that they're all contributors,

00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:55.693 align:start position:0%
they go to these fancy
functions, here in Los Angeles,

00:29:55.693 --> 00:29:58.563 align:start position:0%
they belong to these
institutes, they go on Twitter,

00:29:58.563 --> 00:30:00.632
and they're all echoing
the same talking points,

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:03.835 align:start size:94% position:6%
which is, basically,
Trump is a Russian traitor

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:06.204
or he's all but and we
have to get this guy out

00:30:06.204 --> 00:30:08.239
of the Office of the Presidency,

00:30:08.239 --> 00:30:12.811
and we, as former
CIA, FBI, ODNI,

00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:15.647 line:0%
whatever three or four letter
agency they were a part of,

00:30:15.647 --> 00:30:17.715 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
we are the defenders
of the country,

00:30:17.715 --> 00:30:19.951 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
we are the defenders
of the nation.

00:30:19.951 --> 00:30:21.152 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
And so--
- That's literally what you

00:30:21.152 --> 00:30:22.086
were saying about the
deep state before.

00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:23.588
- Right, right.

00:30:23.588 --> 00:30:26.858
So, they are spinning this
over and over and over again

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:30.795 align:start size:84% position:16%
to continue this high
boil of hysteria,

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:33.231
so that people believe that
the Brennans and the Comeys

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:35.433 align:start size:94% position:6%
and the Clappers are
actually good guys, right?

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:37.769 align:start size:84% position:16%
They're creating
their hysterical base

00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:40.572 align:start position:0%
so that when AG Barr and Durham
come out with this report,

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:44.342
mark my words, you will have
the MSNBCs and Rachel Maddows

00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:45.543 align:start size:84% position:16%
from the top of
the roof screaming,

00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:47.412 align:start size:88% position:13%
"Well, but it's partisan
and it's not true

00:30:47.412 --> 00:30:50.014
"and this is just, this is
a witch hunt against them,"

00:30:50.014 --> 00:30:52.550
and they will deny facts.

00:30:52.550 --> 00:30:54.886
So, it's coming, so
they are preparing

00:30:54.886 --> 00:30:58.590 align:start size:97% position:3%
the battlefield very wisely,
although horrifically,

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.859
they're trying to
save their own skin

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:02.594 align:start size:88% position:13%
and so they're prepping
the battlefield

00:31:02.594 --> 00:31:04.495
with all of these
hysterical tweets

00:31:04.495 --> 00:31:07.098
so that they can find a way,
at least in the public sphere,

00:31:07.098 --> 00:31:09.200
to push back to save their skin.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.302
- All right, so I want to get
to the media portion of that

00:31:11.302 --> 00:31:13.972
because you've talked a lot
about how they leak things

00:31:13.972 --> 00:31:15.940
to the media and the rest of
that, but before we do that,

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.510
how pissed are these guys
at Mueller for the report?

00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:21.012 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean, they
obviously didn't think

00:31:21.012 --> 00:31:22.213
this was gonna be the outcome

00:31:22.213 --> 00:31:23.681 align:start size:84% position:16%
and it was all gonna
just be nonsense

00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:26.651 align:start position:0%
and make Rachel Maddow look
like a complete, raving lunatic.

00:31:26.651 --> 00:31:28.820
- Right, so no collusion.

00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.155
That was a surprise for
the Democratic Party,

00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:32.257
wasn't it, for the left?

00:31:32.257 --> 00:31:34.025
That was a slam dunk, right?

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:36.594
That was supposed to
be a very clear case

00:31:36.594 --> 00:31:40.064 align:start size:97% position:3%
of a president being a
Russian agent and he wasn't.

00:31:40.064 --> 00:31:41.299
Look, it was appropriate--

00:31:41.299 --> 00:31:42.567
- Did it all seem like nonsense?

00:31:42.567 --> 00:31:43.935
Like, what I kept saying
from the beginning was

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:47.071
if this is all true,
wouldn't every Democrat

00:31:47.071 --> 00:31:49.407
be saying, "We're in
World War III now?"

00:31:49.407 --> 00:31:50.942
- [Bryan] Yeah.

00:31:50.942 --> 00:31:52.176
- Like, let's really take this
thing to it's end collusion.

00:31:52.176 --> 00:31:53.578
If it's really true
that, in effect,

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:54.846
Russia basically installed

00:31:54.846 --> 00:31:56.414
the President of the
United States, I mean,

00:31:56.414 --> 00:31:58.650
that's as big a crime as
you could possibly get

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:01.019 align:start size:88% position:13%
so congratulations,
we're in World War III.

00:32:01.019 --> 00:32:02.520
They're worried about
the new World War III

00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.022
but we're in it already.

00:32:04.022 --> 00:32:06.491
- So, I think that many
of us, to include myself,

00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:10.828
at the very beginning were
concerned about connections,

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:13.865
not just the dossier-related
garbage 'cause that was silly,

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:16.467
but some of the rest of it,
and it was like, my position,

00:32:16.467 --> 00:32:18.202
I think a lot of us at
the very beginning said,

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:20.939 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Look, let Bob
Mueller do a fair job

00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:23.574 align:start size:97% position:3%
"within a short period of
time to address this issue."

00:32:23.574 --> 00:32:25.376
Because what I knew, working
in the Intelligence Community,

00:32:25.376 --> 00:32:27.879 align:start size:97% position:3%
is that if we had any
information, any intelligence,

00:32:27.879 --> 00:32:31.115
SIGINT or HUMINT, in other
words, phone calls, emails,

00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:33.184 align:start size:94% position:6%
if we had any kind of
sources from human beings,

00:32:33.184 --> 00:32:35.787
multiple individuals
throughout the world

00:32:35.787 --> 00:32:38.022
and in Moscow, et cetera,
who could all corroborate

00:32:38.022 --> 00:32:41.292
the same thing, then
we need to know that

00:32:41.292 --> 00:32:42.527
and let's put that forward.

00:32:42.527 --> 00:32:44.295
But very quickly,
that information

00:32:44.295 --> 00:32:45.763
should be brought to the table

00:32:45.763 --> 00:32:48.633 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we would be ejecting
the man from the White House

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:50.868 align:start size:94% position:6%
within the first few
months of his presidency.

00:32:50.868 --> 00:32:53.471
And when that didn't happen,
it became very clear to me,

00:32:53.471 --> 00:32:56.240 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I think most reasonable
intelligence officials

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.177
or former officials, that
there was nothing there,

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:01.946
that this was now getting
into a political exercise.

00:33:01.946 --> 00:33:04.182
And I think that the
report showed that,

00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:06.284 align:start size:84% position:16%
that there certainly
was no collusion.

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:09.754 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now, the issue of, did
he try to obstruct?

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.589
Well, boy, I think you
can take a step back

00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:13.925
and say, look, if I were
a newly elected president

00:33:13.925 --> 00:33:16.661
and I knew that I
was being smeared

00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:19.197 align:start size:97% position:3%
by a bunch of former FBI
and CIA people in the media,

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:21.265 align:start size:97% position:3%
saying I was a Russian agent,
I know that's not true,

00:33:21.265 --> 00:33:22.700 align:start size:84% position:16%
damn right I'm gonna
try to shut down

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.535 align:start size:94% position:6%
that investigation because
I know it's garbage.

00:33:24.535 --> 00:33:26.037 align:start size:84% position:16%
Most reasonable people
would wanna say,

00:33:26.037 --> 00:33:27.005
"Forget it, that's
garbage, and I know

00:33:27.005 --> 00:33:28.506
"what you're trying to do.

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:31.342
"you're trying to politicize
my ability to do this work

00:33:31.342 --> 00:33:32.276
"as President of
the United States.

00:33:32.276 --> 00:33:33.911
"You were trying to make sure

00:33:33.911 --> 00:33:35.747
"that I can't do what
the American people
elected me to do."

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:37.215 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Especially, literally
you were elected

00:33:37.215 --> 00:33:38.483 align:start size:84% position:16%
on draining the swamp.
- Correct.

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:40.618
- So, that's sort of
the core thing here.

00:33:40.618 --> 00:33:44.055
- So, the obstruction piece
I think is a political loser.

00:33:44.055 --> 00:33:46.224 align:start size:97% position:3%
I also think that the essence
of the argument's garbage

00:33:46.224 --> 00:33:48.659 align:start size:94% position:6%
as well but the Democratic
Party has clung to that

00:33:48.659 --> 00:33:50.928 align:start size:94% position:6%
and now that they see that
that wasn't working out

00:33:50.928 --> 00:33:52.330
and Bob Mueller,
bless his heart,

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:54.165 align:start size:81% position:19%
if you recall when
he testified--

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:55.133
- Poor guy.

00:33:55.133 --> 00:33:56.267
- Yeah, made me feel sad.

00:33:56.267 --> 00:33:57.568
- I actually felt bad for him,

00:33:57.568 --> 00:33:59.203
like he was just
way over his head--

00:33:59.203 --> 00:34:00.671
- He was.

00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:01.906
- Or he has a little bit
of the Biden, sort of like,

00:34:01.906 --> 00:34:03.841
are you even all
there kinda thing.

00:34:03.841 --> 00:34:05.076
- I mean, a good man.

00:34:05.076 --> 00:34:07.145 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think he worked
hard for his country

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:08.513
but he was way over his skis,

00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:09.747 align:start size:81% position:19%
doing something
he shouldn't have.

00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:13.251
He should've stayed in
retirement land, so.

00:34:13.251 --> 00:34:14.485
- So, the other piece of this,

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:16.020
which you've sort of
been hitting on here,

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:19.524
is the media portion and
how all of these leaks,

00:34:19.524 --> 00:34:22.326
every day you open
up The New York Times

00:34:22.326 --> 00:34:26.097 align:start size:94% position:6%
or CNN or MSNBC and
they're reporting on stuff

00:34:26.097 --> 00:34:28.199
that's supposed to be
behind closed doors,

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:30.701 align:start size:97% position:3%
there are secret congressional
meetings about things,

00:34:30.701 --> 00:34:32.804
but somehow MSNBC and
The New York Times

00:34:32.804 --> 00:34:35.740
has all of Schiff's talking
points and the rest of it,

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:37.942
how does this game
actually get played?

00:34:37.942 --> 00:34:40.812 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like, is it as
obviously ridiculous

00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:43.381
and just so blatant as it seems?

00:34:43.381 --> 00:34:44.549
Could it be that blatant?

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:46.050
- Yeah, it is.

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:49.720
Look, most of the leaking, so,
when you work in Washington,

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:53.024 align:start size:97% position:3%
you find out very quickly that
most of the leaking occurs

00:34:53.024 --> 00:34:55.626 align:start size:94% position:6%
either by the White House,
interestingly enough,

00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:57.095
or by the senior levels

00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:58.696 align:start size:94% position:6%
of the various
departments and agencies.

00:34:58.696 --> 00:35:03.501 align:start position:0%
It's rarely that lower or
working level individual, right?

00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:05.670 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's the people who,
again, like Aldrich Ames,

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.705
have decided that they know
what's best for the country

00:35:07.705 --> 00:35:09.273
so they're gonna act on it
and they're gonna leak things

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:12.343 align:start position:0%
to try to push the media
narrative in that one direction

00:35:12.343 --> 00:35:15.213 align:start size:94% position:6%
or another, based on
whatever they want, right?

00:35:15.213 --> 00:35:16.514
Whatever their goals are,
you know, personal goals.

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:17.982
We saw that with Comey.

00:35:17.982 --> 00:35:19.517 align:start size:94% position:6%
I mean, we know he leaked
to The New York Times

00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:22.620
via a cutout to try to push
for an independent counsel,

00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:24.088
and he got it.

00:35:24.088 --> 00:35:26.924 align:start position:0%
So it's not as though the tactic
doesn't work, it does work.

00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:28.059
So, that's frightening.

00:35:28.059 --> 00:35:29.360
That should frighten all of us.

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.628 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Dave] Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:35:30.628 --> 00:35:32.763
- So, both sides do it
but what we have seen

00:35:32.763 --> 00:35:35.833
over the past three years
is a group of individuals

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:38.836 align:start size:97% position:3%
from the FBI, from the
CIA, who are leaking pieces

00:35:38.836 --> 00:35:42.507
of information to kneecap
a duly elected president

00:35:42.507 --> 00:35:45.042 align:start position:0%
so that they can put the people
in power that they choose,

00:35:45.042 --> 00:35:46.911 align:start size:97% position:3%
irrespective of party,
whether it's a Never Trumper

00:35:46.911 --> 00:35:48.346
or whether it's one
of these, you know,

00:35:48.346 --> 00:35:50.014
more traditional
moderate Democrat

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:51.482
what the hell that
means these days.

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:53.684 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well, it's not really
irrespective of party, right?

00:35:53.684 --> 00:35:56.721 align:start position:0%
'Cause you mean a Never
Trumper or some other Democrat.

00:35:56.721 --> 00:35:59.690 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Sure, but I mean
historically the leaks

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.527
have come from both sides
of the aisle to the media

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:06.197
because of their own personal
desire to shape policy, right?

00:36:06.197 --> 00:36:08.065
We're just seeing
it on steroids now.

00:36:08.065 --> 00:36:09.233
- [Dave] Yeah.

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:11.068 align:start size:88% position:13%
- The amount of leaking,
the ferociousness

00:36:11.068 --> 00:36:13.571
of the impact of
those leaks, right?

00:36:13.571 --> 00:36:15.740 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's not just, we like
this or we don't like this.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:17.408 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's, you know,
Trump is a traitor

00:36:17.408 --> 00:36:19.043
or he's gonna launch
us into World War III

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:21.379 align:start size:88% position:13%
or it's that absurdity,
it's that hysteria

00:36:21.379 --> 00:36:23.681
that was kicked off in
2016 and hasn't stopped.

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:25.183 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Do you think that's
partly just because we're

00:36:25.183 --> 00:36:27.718
just watching institutions
crumble across the board

00:36:27.718 --> 00:36:29.754
and so they're all sort
of in their death throes,

00:36:29.754 --> 00:36:31.722
so you just throw
out everything?

00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:33.191
You know what I mean?

00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:34.525
Like, we're watching our
media institutions crumble,

00:36:34.525 --> 00:36:36.093 align:start size:94% position:6%
our political institutions
are crumbling,

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:38.763 align:start size:97% position:3%
we're exposing information,
conversations like this

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:40.798
weren't really being
had five years ago.

00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start size:84% position:16%
So as it all becomes
more obvious,

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.304
the ways it can lash out
become crazier, sort of.

00:36:46.304 --> 00:36:48.339
- As the curtain is pulled
back on the Wizard of Oz,

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:50.274 align:start size:88% position:13%
does he not get a
little bit more panicked

00:36:50.274 --> 00:36:51.776
about people understanding

00:36:51.776 --> 00:36:53.611 align:start size:97% position:3%
that he's like four foot two
and you know, 250 pounds?

00:36:53.611 --> 00:36:54.879
- Yeah.

00:36:54.879 --> 00:36:56.347
- I think that that
could explain a lot

00:36:56.347 --> 00:36:59.317
because again, at some level,
when you start looking at,

00:36:59.317 --> 00:37:00.952
for instance, let's just
take the media, right?

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:04.589
So, it's long been known
that the media focuses

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:06.424 align:start size:88% position:13%
on one particular party
and benefiting them

00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.625
and it's the Democratic Party.

00:37:07.625 --> 00:37:09.327
Which, by the way,
when you get like 95%

00:37:09.327 --> 00:37:13.764
of political funds or that
is, the media supports you

00:37:13.764 --> 00:37:16.267 align:start size:94% position:6%
from their political
donations, it's incredible

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:17.835 align:start size:94% position:6%
that the Republican
Party even exists, right?

00:37:17.835 --> 00:37:22.573
When you have that degree
of an avalanche of support

00:37:22.573 --> 00:37:25.042 align:start size:97% position:3%
in your nation's media, the
fact that another party exists

00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:26.410
is really incredible

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:27.678 align:start size:94% position:6%
or it means the Democrats
might be stupid.

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:29.280
- Reminder, I'm looking
at a lifelong Democrat.

00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.748 align:start size:97% position:3%
I just wanna say that again.
- Right, right.

00:37:30.748 --> 00:37:34.185 align:start position:0%
So, look, the last 10 to 15
years, forget that, five years,

00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:35.419
- Yeah, we'll get to that then.

00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:36.621
- has changed so much,
- We're gonna get there,

00:37:36.621 --> 00:37:37.855 align:start size:84% position:16%
we're gonna get there.
- it's incredible.

00:37:37.855 --> 00:37:38.789
But yeah, no, I think
you're right to say

00:37:38.789 --> 00:37:40.291
that the media's recognizing

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:43.294
that we're all pulling off the
mask and seeing who they are

00:37:43.294 --> 00:37:45.129
and that is horrifying to them

00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:48.499 align:start position:0%
because the moment that we start
questioning their authority

00:37:48.499 --> 00:37:49.967
to tell us what's
right and wrong

00:37:49.967 --> 00:37:51.769 align:start size:94% position:6%
and we start to say,
"You know what, actually,

00:37:51.769 --> 00:37:53.704
"you've given to the
other political party.

00:37:53.704 --> 00:37:55.273
"You used to work for
that other, you know,

00:37:55.273 --> 00:37:57.475 align:start size:97% position:3%
"organization or entity
that is now against Trump,"

00:37:57.475 --> 00:38:00.211
or like, we now know
that you are biased

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.545
and that's fine, right?

00:38:01.545 --> 00:38:02.980
You and I both have an opinion,

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.482
- [Dave] Sure.

00:38:04.482 --> 00:38:05.983 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We both go on TV and talk
about things and our opinions,

00:38:05.983 --> 00:38:08.152
that's fine, but let's be
candid about who we are

00:38:08.152 --> 00:38:10.254
and what we believe in and
let's not pass it as news

00:38:10.254 --> 00:38:12.456 align:start size:97% position:3%
because it's not news, it's
just an opinion, right?

00:38:12.456 --> 00:38:13.691
It's interesting.

00:38:13.691 --> 00:38:15.326
The former editor of
The New York Times

00:38:15.326 --> 00:38:17.695
gave this fantastic interview

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.230
where she talked
about her students.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:20.731
You know, she left
The New York Times

00:38:20.731 --> 00:38:22.967
now I believe is at Yale or
one of these fancy Ivies,

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:25.670
and she works with students
who wanna become journalists.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:27.938
And she said one
of the frustrations

00:38:27.938 --> 00:38:31.409
that she has is that
all want to report

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:32.843
on their own opinions

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:34.578 align:start position:0%
of what's happening in the
world, right, and not the news.

00:38:34.578 --> 00:38:37.448
And it's like, well, amen,
we have been down this road

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:39.517
for 15 plus years
where everybody

00:38:39.517 --> 00:38:41.018
in the role of journalism
- Right, why not admit it?

00:38:41.018 --> 00:38:43.354
- Yeah, so let's have
an honest conversation

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:45.923 align:start size:84% position:16%
that the Walter
Cronkites are gone.

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:47.158
- Yeah.

00:38:47.158 --> 00:38:48.759 align:start size:81% position:19%
- And it's now,
you know, a circus

00:38:48.759 --> 00:38:50.461
and everybody's got
a different performer

00:38:50.461 --> 00:38:52.897
that they prefer, and that's bad

00:38:52.897 --> 00:38:54.532 align:start size:94% position:6%
and we should acknowledge
that that's bad

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:57.368
and we should, I think, as
a country and at some point,

00:38:57.368 --> 00:39:00.004
when does journalism
ring it's own bell

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:01.238
and say, "We've gone too far,

00:39:01.238 --> 00:39:02.373
"let's see if we can do
something different."

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:03.641
- So, when you read the paper

00:39:03.641 --> 00:39:05.176
that was formerly
The New York Times,

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:08.312
are there phrases that you
can see are obvious tells

00:39:08.312 --> 00:39:11.315
when it's complete nonsense,
beyond just unnamed source

00:39:11.315 --> 00:39:12.650
or source on Capital Hill?
- You mean, other than just

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:13.984 align:start size:84% position:16%
picking it up and
saying New York Times

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:15.152
and putting it back down?

00:39:15.152 --> 00:39:16.087
- Yeah, yeah.

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:17.321
And by the way, as I always say

00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:18.789
every time I knock
The New York Times,

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:20.691
I would prefer this
not be the case.

00:39:20.691 --> 00:39:22.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Amen.
- Everyone knows it.

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:25.363 align:start position:0%
The people that I find that
are railing against it the most

00:39:25.363 --> 00:39:27.665
are the people that don't
want this to be the most,

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:28.599
you know what I mean?

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:30.234
Just don't be totally horrible.

00:39:30.234 --> 00:39:33.404 align:start position:0%
- I come from the middle of
nowhere in Eastern rural Oregon.

00:39:33.404 --> 00:39:35.506 align:start size:88% position:13%
The way that I was able
to get into the CIA

00:39:35.506 --> 00:39:37.007
was that I went to
The Washington Post

00:39:37.007 --> 00:39:39.410
and New York Times and I
read it every single day,

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.878 align:start size:84% position:16%
back in the late
'90s and early 2000s.

00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:42.113
I took notes on each story,

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:44.181 align:start size:84% position:16%
I built my knowledge
and understanding

00:39:44.181 --> 00:39:46.083
of the world based
on their reporting.

00:39:46.083 --> 00:39:48.252
So there was a time
when I was a big fan

00:39:48.252 --> 00:39:50.888
and I appreciated what
they were doing for me,

00:39:50.888 --> 00:39:52.223
for the world, for the country,

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:54.291
spreading what was
actually happening,

00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:56.527
and we've lost that
at the Gray Lady.

00:39:56.527 --> 00:39:57.862
And The Washington Post has gone

00:39:57.862 --> 00:39:59.597
even more bananas and bonkers

00:39:59.597 --> 00:40:01.065
and it's horrible
for the republic

00:40:01.065 --> 00:40:04.802 align:start size:84% position:16%
because democracies
need that voice

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:07.538
to challenge people in power.

00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:09.240
- So do you think we're
more than anything else,

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.175
I mean putting all the
political stuff aside,

00:40:11.175 --> 00:40:13.511
putting deep state aside,
putting the parties aside

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:15.980
that we're really more
in an information war

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.748 align:start size:81% position:19%
at this point than
anything else?

00:40:17.748 --> 00:40:19.250
It's not even information.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:20.951
It's really the delivery
system of the information

00:40:20.951 --> 00:40:22.453 align:start size:88% position:13%
more than anything else.
- Sure.

00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:24.989
I mean you're talking to a
guy who put out two tweets,

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:27.224
expressed a simple
political opinion,

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:29.393
no inflammatory language.
- Can you just remind me

00:40:29.393 --> 00:40:31.128 align:start size:97% position:3%
what the tweets were exactly?
- Yeah.

00:40:31.128 --> 00:40:33.297
- Because you're a
former CIA Ops guys.

00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:35.933
I think you've proven
here in this half hour,

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:37.868
whatever it is, that you know
what you're talking about.

00:40:37.868 --> 00:40:40.037 align:start size:88% position:13%
And here are the two
tweets that you put out.

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:43.841 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So both of them basically
had to do with President Trump

00:40:43.841 --> 00:40:45.776
or Democrats being crazy.

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:48.879 align:start size:97% position:3%
And one was taking a headline
from The Washington Post,

00:40:48.879 --> 00:40:51.382 align:start size:84% position:16%
which was silly
Parson Flimflammed.

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:53.617
I don't even remember what
the hell the headline was.

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:55.553
I was just commenting on
the fact that it was silly.

00:40:55.553 --> 00:40:58.088
And that was enough
to get me banned

00:40:58.088 --> 00:40:59.890
for whatever number of days.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.060
And the other one was
a thread talking about

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:07.665 align:start size:97% position:3%
the president and this
whole impeachment silliness

00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:09.333
and how absurd it is.

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:13.103 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think it was a relatively
short thread and I was banned.

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:16.740 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Again, simply taking a
snippet form the IG report

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.444 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
and commenting on that section
of report, that was enough.

00:41:20.444 --> 00:41:23.681 line:0%
So that to me, and I
know that you have been

00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:25.216
banging this drum
for a long time,

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:28.118 align:start size:94% position:6%
is incredibly frightening
that we now have

00:41:28.118 --> 00:41:30.855
a handful of entities
from Silicon Valley

00:41:30.855 --> 00:41:33.023 align:start size:84% position:16%
that are really
publishers deciding

00:41:33.023 --> 00:41:36.861 align:start size:88% position:13%
who gets to say whatever
they want them to say

00:41:36.861 --> 00:41:41.765
and if it goes too far,
either a corporate policy

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:46.170 align:start size:97% position:3%
or as a one off, whatever
number of decide that's bad,

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.205
there gonna throw a little
sand in the gears, right?

00:41:48.205 --> 00:41:50.708
They may not ban you
completely, they may.

00:41:50.708 --> 00:41:52.243
But they may just throw
some sand in the gear

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:54.378
and have you blocked for
a week or two or whatever

00:41:54.378 --> 00:41:55.980
when you want to share something

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.649
at a very important time
in the nation's politics,

00:41:58.649 --> 00:42:01.085
right during this Iran issue.

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:02.520 align:start size:88% position:13%
So we're gonna throw
some sand in your gears.

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.754
We're gonna stop
you from tweeting,

00:42:03.754 --> 00:42:05.789
or stop you from sharing
something on Facebook.

00:42:05.789 --> 00:42:06.824
That's what they're doing now.

00:42:06.824 --> 00:42:07.992
That's what they've done to me.

00:42:07.992 --> 00:42:09.994 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Does it feel
like the whole game

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:13.531
is designed to just make
us crazier, right now?

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start size:94% position:6%
Like every time you read--
- Well that's result.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.002 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Like once you start
seeing this stuff, right,

00:42:18.002 --> 00:42:19.837 align:start size:84% position:16%
you have your little
red pill moment,

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:20.804
you start seeing this stuff.

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:22.206
You don't wanna see it, right?

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:25.075 align:start size:84% position:16%
You wanna put the
ocean back in the cup.

00:42:25.075 --> 00:42:26.010
- Right.

00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.611
- And it just doesn't fit.

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:30.114 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well I think that this
has been a long time coming.

00:42:30.114 --> 00:42:31.515
So what's interesting is,

00:42:32.983 --> 00:42:34.718
MIT did this brilliant study

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:36.587
in the late '90s
when some of our

00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:38.188 align:start size:88% position:13%
economic trade
policies were changing,

00:42:38.188 --> 00:42:40.157
China went to the WTO.

00:42:40.157 --> 00:42:42.927
We had Mexico and
Canada and NAFTA

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:46.163
and a lotta the communities
were impacted negatively

00:42:46.163 --> 00:42:47.831
by these economic changes.

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:50.668 align:start size:88% position:13%
We're starting to elect
people to Congress

00:42:50.668 --> 00:42:54.772 align:start position:0%
and Senate who were
increasingly more inflammatory,

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.907 align:start size:97% position:3%
increasing further on the
left and further on the right.

00:42:56.907 --> 00:43:00.477 align:start size:97% position:3%
And what now you see that
that created the marketplace

00:43:00.477 --> 00:43:03.013
for people in media
to be even more loud

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:05.783
and bombastic and crazy,
because people were angry

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:08.052
and so they were able to
tap into that marketplace.

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:09.954
So it think that the things

00:43:09.954 --> 00:43:11.822 align:start size:94% position:6%
that you're seeing in
America's media right now

00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:15.092 align:start position:0%
are really reflective of a
country that's deeply unsettled.

00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:17.094 align:start size:97% position:3%
It doesn't mean that we
don't celebrate the progress

00:43:17.094 --> 00:43:18.596
here in this country,

00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:19.797
because economically, I think
you could make an argument,

00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:21.165 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you've had people
on this program

00:43:21.165 --> 00:43:22.266
that have made it very clear

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:24.034 align:start size:84% position:16%
that we are
benefiting profoundly

00:43:24.034 --> 00:43:26.704
from our wonderful economic
system, imperfect as it is,

00:43:26.704 --> 00:43:29.206 align:start size:88% position:13%
our wonderful republic,
imperfect as it is.

00:43:29.206 --> 00:43:30.841
But there's clearly a sickness

00:43:30.841 --> 00:43:33.110 align:start size:84% position:16%
that is being
reflected in our media

00:43:33.110 --> 00:43:34.612
that is really, at
the end of the day,

00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:37.314 align:start size:94% position:6%
it reflects our own
brokenness, our own anger,

00:43:37.314 --> 00:43:39.883
because we're responding
in such a visceral way

00:43:39.883 --> 00:43:41.085 align:start size:81% position:19%
we're giving those
people ratings.

00:43:41.085 --> 00:43:42.353
- Okay, so let's
go to our woe is me

00:43:42.353 --> 00:43:44.722
beat up lefty guys
here for a second.

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:45.923
Because as you're saying that

00:43:45.923 --> 00:43:47.157 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm reminded of
when I used to be on

00:43:47.157 --> 00:43:49.360
the Young Turks and
I was a big lefty,

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:50.995 align:start size:81% position:19%
that I'd be on
air with the hosts

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:54.398
and they'd be screaming like
crazy people about something.

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:56.367
There's no video of
me ever screaming

00:43:56.367 --> 00:43:57.568
about anything like this,

00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:58.535 align:start size:84% position:16%
but they'd be
screaming this thing

00:43:58.535 --> 00:43:59.770
and then we'd cut to break,

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:00.571 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then they'd be
completely fine again,

00:44:00.571 --> 00:44:01.805
like completely fine.

00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:03.040
Then we'd come back and
people were screaming

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.875
or crying or yelling or
pounding their fists.

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:08.512
And I remember thinking
is just all theater.

00:44:08.512 --> 00:44:10.014
This is not theater to me.

00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:11.715 align:start size:97% position:3%
We're having the same exact
conversation right now

00:44:11.715 --> 00:44:13.217 align:start size:94% position:6%
that we were having
before the cameras started

00:44:13.217 --> 00:44:14.451 align:start size:84% position:16%
and everything else.
- Correct.

00:44:14.451 --> 00:44:16.887
- But we've been sort of
primed that everything

00:44:16.887 --> 00:44:19.490
is sorta theater right now.

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:23.193
But it doesn't seem like
can get any of this back.

00:44:23.193 --> 00:44:25.896
Is that now where we're at?

00:44:25.896 --> 00:44:27.431
That we won't come back.

00:44:27.431 --> 00:44:28.899
So what I'm talking about
with the cup and the ocean

00:44:28.899 --> 00:44:31.301
it's like we now need
different institutions.

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.436 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think there's a
lotta people trying to

00:44:32.436 --> 00:44:34.672
hang on to the old institutions.

00:44:34.672 --> 00:44:35.839
I see this with a lotta my

00:44:35.839 --> 00:44:37.574 align:start size:84% position:16%
last remaining
sane lefty friends.

00:44:37.574 --> 00:44:40.411 align:start size:81% position:19%
The New York Times
will come back.

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:42.246 align:start size:84% position:16%
The Democratic
party'll coem back.

00:44:42.246 --> 00:44:45.049
But the ain't comin' back guys.

00:44:45.049 --> 00:44:49.720
- If there's any hope, it's
President Trump wins in 2020

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.455 align:start size:94% position:6%
and the Democratic party--
- And the death blow

00:44:51.455 --> 00:44:54.091
is so cataclysmic.
- It would have to be

00:44:54.091 --> 00:44:55.826 align:start size:94% position:6%
an overwhelming loss, both
the House, the Senate,

00:44:55.826 --> 00:44:57.294
and the Presidency.

00:44:57.294 --> 00:45:00.297 align:start size:97% position:3%
We would be talking about like
1984 election with Mondale

00:45:00.297 --> 00:45:01.765
and '88 election with Dukakis.

00:45:01.765 --> 00:45:06.637 align:start position:0%
But let's not forget that stupid
tends to be very resilient.

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:09.273
And so you're seeing a lot
of that coming out of places

00:45:09.273 --> 00:45:11.075 align:start size:81% position:19%
like New York with
Ocasio-Cortez.

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:13.343
We're getting a lot of
very crazy individuals

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:15.679 align:start size:97% position:3%
who are very now powerful
with in the Democratic party.

00:45:15.679 --> 00:45:17.214
We're absolutely reshaping it.

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:19.683
You would need to have
a progressive nominated

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:24.688
for the 2020 election lose
against President Trump.

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:26.790
- So they have to have
the Corbin basically.

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:27.725
- Yeah, yeah.

00:45:27.725 --> 00:45:28.926
- Yeah I mean I see that.

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:30.561
I mean how crazy
though for two guys

00:45:30.561 --> 00:45:32.529
that are basically
lifelong Democrats.

00:45:32.529 --> 00:45:34.798
And I can't call myself
part of the left anymore.

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.633
- I'm hanging on
by my fingernails.

00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:38.869
- Yeah I know, but
a lotta my good last

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:39.903
liberal friends are trying.

00:45:39.903 --> 00:45:41.438
Like I get it.

00:45:41.438 --> 00:45:43.407
And it just like, for me the
ship has sailed, it's fine.

00:45:44.742 --> 00:45:45.809
But you wrote a piece

00:45:45.809 --> 00:45:47.211 align:start size:88% position:13%
in Fox News.
- How about a life raft

00:45:47.211 --> 00:45:48.912 align:start size:97% position:3%
for those us who are
paddling behind behind you?

00:45:48.912 --> 00:45:51.348
- I'm gonna keep a life raft
out there, but not much longer,

00:45:51.348 --> 00:45:52.583 align:start size:84% position:16%
you know what I mean.
(Bryan laughs)

00:45:52.583 --> 00:45:53.550 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I gotta go now.
- I've been saving--

00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.752 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Make the jump.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:55.986
Well I feel like
I've been screaming

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:57.454
about this for so long
that now it's weird.

00:45:57.454 --> 00:45:59.423 align:start size:97% position:3%
Because you know how your
frustrations change over time.

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:01.959 align:start position:0%
And it's like I used to be
really frustrated with the right

00:46:01.959 --> 00:46:03.360
and then for these couple years

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:04.561 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've been frustrated
with the left.

00:46:04.561 --> 00:46:05.996
Now I'm like really
frustrated at my

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:07.798
last remaining lefty friends,

00:46:07.798 --> 00:46:09.700
that just refuse to see reality.

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.901
'Cause it's like come on guys,

00:46:10.901 --> 00:46:12.903
like how much more destruction

00:46:12.903 --> 00:46:15.606
do you want these people to sow?

00:46:15.606 --> 00:46:18.308 align:start position:0%
How much further down the
socialist path do you wanna go?

00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:20.911
But you wrote a piece
about this in Fox News.

00:46:20.911 --> 00:46:22.646
I mean do you think
there's any chance?

00:46:22.646 --> 00:46:24.848
Like who are the
remaining Democrats

00:46:24.848 --> 00:46:26.784
that would make someone like
you say you're a Democrat?

00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:29.286
Or forget the people,

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:30.587 align:start size:88% position:13%
although you're welcome
to tell me some,

00:46:30.587 --> 00:46:32.723
what are the Democratic policies

00:46:32.723 --> 00:46:35.359
that actually make
any sense anymore?

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:37.961 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So if you look at, if
you believe Gallup polling,

00:46:37.961 --> 00:46:40.898
so about 15% of Democrats
are conservative Democrats,

00:46:40.898 --> 00:46:42.399 align:start size:88% position:13%
are identified as
conservative Democrats.

00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:45.836 align:start size:97% position:3%
35 say they're moderate, 50%
say liberal, progressive.

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:48.405
So there is clearly a
split within the party.

00:46:48.405 --> 00:46:50.607
I think what you're seeing now

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:53.877
in place like Iowa
and New Hampshire

00:46:53.877 --> 00:46:56.814 align:start size:97% position:3%
and South Carolina and Nevada
and some of that polling,

00:46:56.814 --> 00:46:59.817
Biden's still got
the pole position.

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start size:84% position:16%
But clearly if you
look at Bernie Sanders

00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:05.422
and to somewhat of a lesser
extent Elizabeth Warren,

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:07.591
that wing of the party's strong.

00:47:07.591 --> 00:47:10.894 align:start size:84% position:16%
And so what happens
in this primary season

00:47:10.894 --> 00:47:12.162
I think will set the temperature

00:47:12.162 --> 00:47:13.397
in the direction for the party

00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:14.898
for many, many years to come.

00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:17.401 align:start size:97% position:3%
And that's why you're seeing
people like Ocasio-Cortez

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:19.169 align:start size:84% position:16%
just yesterday saying
in an interview

00:47:19.169 --> 00:47:20.337
that she can't believe that she

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:22.739 align:start size:88% position:13%
and Biden are both
part of the same party.

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:24.975
- [Dave] 'Cause that
was the plan all along.

00:47:24.975 --> 00:47:26.143
- She's not a Democrat.

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:27.678
Bernie Sanders isn't a Democrat.

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:30.013 align:start size:97% position:3%
They're Democratic
Socialists which of course,

00:47:30.013 --> 00:47:32.382
as you have, they're gonna
drop the democratic part

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:33.450 align:start size:84% position:16%
at some point.
- Yeah, the D word's

00:47:33.450 --> 00:47:34.918 align:start size:88% position:13%
goin' down.
- Although North Korea's

00:47:34.918 --> 00:47:36.887 align:start position:0%
calls themselves the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea.

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:38.889
So there is a branding
exercise there, right?

00:47:38.889 --> 00:47:40.791
- It's just pure branding, okay.

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:45.362
- It's really, there's some
chutzpah happening right now

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:49.366
within the socialist
wing of the party,

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.801
basically saying that
they are the party.

00:47:50.801 --> 00:47:53.804 align:start size:84% position:16%
So that's fight's
gonna continue 2020.

00:47:53.804 --> 00:47:55.873
Let's see what happens.

00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:58.642
My personal hope and
I hate to say this,

00:47:58.642 --> 00:48:02.012
but my person hope is that we
elect some crazy progressive,

00:48:02.012 --> 00:48:03.447
elect Bernie Sanders right,

00:48:03.447 --> 00:48:06.483 align:start size:97% position:3%
then the American people
have a very clear distinction

00:48:06.483 --> 00:48:08.652
for whom they should choose.

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:11.154
What should the future
of the country look like?

00:48:11.154 --> 00:48:14.024
Is it the Bernie Sanders
and the Green New Deals

00:48:14.024 --> 00:48:17.361
and the free everything that
nobody can pay for, right,

00:48:17.361 --> 00:48:18.762
and that's absurd?

00:48:18.762 --> 00:48:20.631
- Plus all the racism.

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:23.934
(both men talking
at the same time)

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:26.570
- So is that who
we wanna become?

00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:29.506 align:start size:97% position:3%
And if it's not, then you
have to look to the other guy,

00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:30.707
'cause you only
have two choices.

00:48:30.707 --> 00:48:32.943
- But do you think
there's any mechanism

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:34.244 align:start size:97% position:3%
and this is the thought that
I've really been stuck on

00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:35.445
for the last couple months,

00:48:35.445 --> 00:48:38.348 align:start size:88% position:13%
like is there mechanism
that liberals have,

00:48:38.348 --> 00:48:41.285
I mean good liberals, so like
an old school Democrat has,

00:48:41.285 --> 00:48:42.753
to fight off the bad thing?

00:48:42.753 --> 00:48:43.887
Because we're just watching

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:45.489 align:start size:84% position:16%
all of them be
pinned one at a time.

00:48:45.489 --> 00:48:47.024
You know what I mean?

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:49.059
Like Biden was brought in
to be the straight shooter

00:48:49.059 --> 00:48:50.627
and the decent guy and
the old school Democrat.

00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:52.596 align:start size:88% position:13%
Now he's telling you you
can pick which prison

00:48:52.596 --> 00:48:54.064 align:start size:88% position:13%
you wanna go to
depending on what gender

00:48:54.064 --> 00:48:55.132 align:start size:88% position:13%
you identify with.
- And learn how to code

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:56.500 align:start size:88% position:13%
coal miners.
- He literally, I mean--

00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.435 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah.
- Learn how to code

00:48:58.435 --> 00:49:00.304 align:start size:84% position:16%
coal miners and
then his other thing

00:49:00.304 --> 00:49:02.940 align:start size:97% position:3%
the other day about--
- So much for Western PA Joe.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.141
Yeah.

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:05.609 align:start size:88% position:13%
- But, but, oh I thought
you were gonna say,

00:49:05.609 --> 00:49:07.544 align:start size:97% position:3%
'cause he had this other
thing the other day about...

00:49:08.879 --> 00:49:11.148 align:start size:88% position:13%
Basically he said we're
a European culture,

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:13.550
not some culture that's
imported from Africa.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:16.420
And it's like, um, I
thought that's what...

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:18.088
Isn't that what...

00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:19.589
But he was brought in to be the,

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:21.325
and that's what I'm saying,
like there's no mechanism

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:22.793
for a decent Democrat anymore.

00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:24.861 align:start size:81% position:19%
There's no vehicle
for it anymore.

00:49:24.861 --> 00:49:26.396
- No there's not right?

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:29.566
Because at some level you
would hope that the media

00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:31.902 align:start size:84% position:16%
or people within
The Washington Post,

00:49:31.902 --> 00:49:34.771 align:start size:88% position:13%
the New York Times,
the CNNs and the MSNBCs

00:49:34.771 --> 00:49:37.708
that they would have some of
their more sensible voices

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:39.876 align:start size:94% position:6%
and calling out the
people like Ocasio-Cortez

00:49:39.876 --> 00:49:42.212
and Bernie Sanders saying,
they're not real Democrats.

00:49:42.212 --> 00:49:44.614 align:start size:97% position:3%
Let's talk about they
strategy document from 2012

00:49:44.614 --> 00:49:46.183
that talks about Marx and Lenin

00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.417
and taking over the economy.

00:49:47.417 --> 00:49:48.986 align:start size:81% position:19%
Like let's talk
about who they are

00:49:48.986 --> 00:49:51.588
versus the Joy Behars
of The View of like

00:49:51.588 --> 00:49:53.056
she's super awesome,

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:54.624 align:start size:84% position:16%
you know and Rachel
Maddow of like

00:49:54.624 --> 00:49:56.326
boy she's an impressive gal.

00:49:56.326 --> 00:49:58.028
Like what is happening?

00:49:58.028 --> 00:50:00.931
Like I don't care that
she can dance really

00:50:00.931 --> 00:50:03.633
fun on roof in Boston, like
that's stupid viral video.

00:50:03.633 --> 00:50:05.535
Like, that's not important.

00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:07.270 line:0%
The fact that she
wants to encourage

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:08.772 line:0%
the United States government

00:50:08.772 --> 00:50:11.475 line:0%
to take over the means of
production in this country,

00:50:11.475 --> 00:50:12.809 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
via socialism.
- Problematic would you say?

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:14.311 line:0%
- Yeah, right?

00:50:14.311 --> 00:50:16.813 line:0%
Let's up end it and let's
pass the New Green Deal,

00:50:16.813 --> 00:50:18.715
which we could never afford

00:50:18.715 --> 00:50:21.852 align:start position:0%
and oh by the way isn't
actually going to be effective.

00:50:21.852 --> 00:50:24.121 align:start size:97% position:3%
So let's slaughter all the
cows because of the cow farts.

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:25.355
Okay, super.

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:27.190 align:start size:81% position:19%
You are aware that
China and India

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
their combined CO2
and methane emissions,

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:32.429
would far and do far
eclipse everything

00:50:32.429 --> 00:50:34.765 align:start size:97% position:3%
the United States and
European union could ever do

00:50:34.765 --> 00:50:36.867
in terms of their
horrific pollution.

00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:38.435
So you can kill all
the cows you want,

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:41.872
but until you address the
India and China problem,

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:44.041
this is silly, this is
a silly conversation.

00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:45.575
And the only reasonable people

00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:46.843
in this conversation right now,

00:50:46.843 --> 00:50:49.479
shockingly enough,
are Republicans.

00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:51.381 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's the Dan Crenshaws
who are like,

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:55.218 align:start size:97% position:3%
yeah look CO2 and methane,
it's real, like it's happening

00:50:55.218 --> 00:50:57.521
and we need to focus on
R and D related issues

00:50:57.521 --> 00:50:59.122
that scrub the stuff
out of the environment

00:50:59.122 --> 00:51:00.857
and that's what we
need to be doing,

00:51:00.857 --> 00:51:03.326
versus knocking down every
house and rebuilding it,

00:51:03.326 --> 00:51:04.828
killing all the farting cows.

00:51:04.828 --> 00:51:07.097
If you're gonna kill farty
people, what about Swalwell?

00:51:07.097 --> 00:51:09.499 align:start position:0%
I mean he goes on TV and farts,
like what about that guy?

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:11.234 align:start size:75% position:25%
You know.
- Yeah that was

00:51:11.234 --> 00:51:14.337 align:start size:94% position:6%
the biggest fart of 2019.
- That was an amazing

00:51:14.337 --> 00:51:15.872
series of flatulence.

00:51:15.872 --> 00:51:17.607
(both men talking
at the same time)

00:51:17.607 --> 00:51:19.743
- Right he actually, no, no, no,

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:21.912 align:start size:84% position:16%
they said it was cup--
- Right, right.

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:24.681 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Move his cup on the table.
- Sure, sure.

00:51:24.681 --> 00:51:26.817 align:start size:84% position:16%
I use that excuse too.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:51:26.817 --> 00:51:30.220 align:start size:84% position:16%
So all right, if they
go down that road

00:51:30.220 --> 00:51:32.289
and then okay now Bernie,

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:33.523
let's just say it's Bernie

00:51:33.523 --> 00:51:34.991
'cause that's the
easier answer here.

00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:36.760
Bernie ends up gettin' crushed

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.228
and then we have
round two of Trump.

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:41.298 align:start size:97% position:3%
Do you think there's a chance
they actually recalibrate

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:42.866
and look in the
mirror and do it?

00:51:42.866 --> 00:51:45.135 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean Trump's president now.
- Right.

00:51:45.135 --> 00:51:47.437
- At every moment, and this
is where my frustration lies,

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:49.372 align:start size:81% position:19%
where there've
been every moment,

00:51:49.372 --> 00:51:50.707
when those road blocks have come

00:51:50.707 --> 00:51:52.275 align:start size:81% position:19%
of like guys let's
take the look,

00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:54.077
they always just
plow right through

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:56.079 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I sense that's exactly
what they're gonna do.

00:51:56.079 --> 00:51:59.349 align:start size:97% position:3%
I sense that's what they're
gonna do in the UK now.

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:01.251
Like it just, it doesn't stop.

00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:02.486
It doesn't stop.

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:04.421
- The question is,
are we at the point

00:52:04.421 --> 00:52:07.991 align:start size:94% position:6%
where leftism is so broken
that we double down,

00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:09.860
so we have our Mondale moment

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.595 align:start size:84% position:16%
and we're just gonna
go with Dukakis?

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:13.463
Or are we at the Bill
Clinton '92 moment

00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:16.700
where the powers that be in
the Democratic party say,

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.503 align:start size:88% position:13%
okay, we dipped our toes
in the crazy waters,

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:22.139 align:start size:81% position:19%
let's do something
different now?

00:52:22.139 --> 00:52:26.176
And I think that we are
more at our '84 moment

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:27.811 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I think that we are
gonna double down on stupid

00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:30.046 align:start size:88% position:13%
because I think that
the fever is too strong.

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:32.749
Look Tom Perez at DNC
said that Ocasio-Cortez

00:52:32.749 --> 00:52:34.151
is the future of the party.

00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:37.821 align:start size:88% position:13%
Barack Obama endorsed
her during her election.

00:52:37.821 --> 00:52:40.724
He's now endorsed
Medicare for All.

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:43.260
I mean this is man who at the
same time also talks about

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.896 align:start size:84% position:16%
we need to not go
too far to the left.

00:52:45.896 --> 00:52:49.332
Well then why the holy hell
are you endorsing socialists?

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:50.834
- He plays it both sides.

00:52:50.834 --> 00:52:52.369
Every other week he comes out
with something that sounds

00:52:52.369 --> 00:52:54.571 align:start size:84% position:16%
you know oh we
shouldn't judge people

00:52:54.571 --> 00:52:55.772
by the color of their
skin, and then (laughs)

00:52:55.772 --> 00:52:57.274
Britain should rule the world.

00:52:57.274 --> 00:52:59.009
And it's like come
on man, pick a side.

00:52:59.009 --> 00:53:00.744 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So we are in the
middle of silly season

00:53:00.744 --> 00:53:03.547
and it's not just...

00:53:03.547 --> 00:53:05.015
Why is this important?

00:53:05.015 --> 00:53:07.884 align:start size:97% position:3%
Right so this conversation
about where is the left today,

00:53:07.884 --> 00:53:09.186
why should we really care?

00:53:09.186 --> 00:53:10.487 align:start size:81% position:19%
The people who
are watching this,

00:53:10.487 --> 00:53:11.922
who are Republicans
or Libertarians,

00:53:11.922 --> 00:53:14.457 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they're like yeah,
screw you asshole.

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:16.059
- Well they keep beating on me.

00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:18.028 align:start size:94% position:6%
They keep saying Dave stop
givin' them the hints.

00:53:18.028 --> 00:53:19.296
- Right, right.

00:53:19.296 --> 00:53:20.497
But here's what I
would say to them

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:22.465 align:start size:84% position:16%
and this is what I
would say to any of us

00:53:22.465 --> 00:53:25.202 align:start size:84% position:16%
who are tired of the
left's silliness,

00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:27.771
but well we'll just
all vote for Trump.

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:30.574
We are not China with one party.

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:33.643
We are not North Korea
with one dear leader.

00:53:33.643 --> 00:53:38.014 align:start size:97% position:3%
A republic, a true democracy
requires vibrant parties

00:53:38.014 --> 00:53:41.218
to combat each other, to fight
with each other rhetorically

00:53:41.218 --> 00:53:43.820
to provide different
solutions to problems.

00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.256 align:start size:84% position:16%
So you need a vibrant
political class

00:53:46.256 --> 00:53:47.424
to have these conversations.

00:53:47.424 --> 00:53:48.925
Because at the end of the day,

00:53:48.925 --> 00:53:51.061
this is so important 'cause
who else is going to lead

00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.496 align:start size:84% position:16%
humanity for the
next number of years,

00:53:53.496 --> 00:53:54.998
for the next century.

00:53:54.998 --> 00:53:56.233
It's not going to be China.

00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:57.667
And it's not gonna be Russia

00:53:57.667 --> 00:53:59.669 align:start size:88% position:13%
and God forbid if either
of those two nations

00:53:59.669 --> 00:54:00.604
are leading humanity.

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:02.105
- And so is that the irony here

00:54:02.105 --> 00:54:05.075
that when people want us
to pull out of everything

00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:08.378 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I get that my Libertarian
side really feels that,

00:54:08.378 --> 00:54:10.080 align:start size:94% position:6%
and why are we giving
all these countries money

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.615
and if you told me right now

00:54:11.615 --> 00:54:14.584
we were gonna cut foreign
aid 25% across the board,

00:54:14.584 --> 00:54:15.819
I'd probably be for it.

00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:17.087
I don't know all of
the ramifications

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.321
of all of those things,

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:19.289
and I'm sure that--
- We could talk about

00:54:19.289 --> 00:54:20.557 align:start size:75% position:25%
foreign aid too.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:22.025
All right, so let's
talk about it then,

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:23.860
but like, so like that
part of me really exists.

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.129
But then it's like, it's
not just that we pull back

00:54:26.129 --> 00:54:28.331
and then things would
just keep operating.

00:54:28.331 --> 00:54:30.100 align:start size:94% position:6%
It's like well
somebody's gonna step in.

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:31.034
- Correct.

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:32.569
- And who do we wanna step in?

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:36.172
So as imperfect as we are, I
kind would rather it be us.

00:54:36.172 --> 00:54:38.642
It's just our sort
Faustian bargain

00:54:38.642 --> 00:54:40.076
with the universe or something.

00:54:40.076 --> 00:54:42.412 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well so, look from a
foreign policy perspective,

00:54:42.412 --> 00:54:43.713 align:start size:94% position:6%
you know people talk
about what's our strategy,

00:54:43.713 --> 00:54:44.914
what's our strategy?

00:54:44.914 --> 00:54:46.583 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well we wanna create
more democracies

00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:49.119
and then we want to try
to stop or slow down

00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:53.223
or bog down the parties who
would stop us, humanity,

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:55.125 align:start size:88% position:13%
from reaching that point
of greater liberty.

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:56.693
Right, because that is
ultimately the goal.

00:54:56.693 --> 00:54:59.629 align:start size:97% position:3%
And we are the torchbearers
of that legacy.

00:54:59.629 --> 00:55:00.864 align:start size:94% position:6%
It is our responsibility.
- When you say that,

00:55:00.864 --> 00:55:02.532
you hit on this earlier,
but when you say that,

00:55:02.532 --> 00:55:04.034 align:start size:88% position:13%
the idea that we're
giving them more liberty

00:55:04.034 --> 00:55:05.268
and we want more democracy,

00:55:05.268 --> 00:55:06.369
'cause democracies
don't get into wars

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:07.604 align:start size:75% position:25%
with each other.
- Right.

00:55:07.604 --> 00:55:09.205
- It's not purely, like
when people say that,

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:10.473
you wanna spread democracy,

00:55:10.473 --> 00:55:12.242
there's somehow it
means this sort of

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:14.611
financial thing or
capitalist thing,

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:16.112
but it actually is,

00:55:16.112 --> 00:55:18.048
I mean I don't know if you
read "Virtue in Nationalism"

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:21.785
by Yoram Hazony, it's like,
strong nations actually,

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.253
strong democratic nations,

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:24.721 align:start size:84% position:16%
that's what actually
brings peace.

00:55:24.721 --> 00:55:26.323
- Correct, absolutely.

00:55:26.323 --> 00:55:28.591 align:start size:94% position:6%
And this has been, again,
foreign policy 101.

00:55:28.591 --> 00:55:32.329 align:start size:84% position:16%
This has been a
profound goal of most

00:55:32.329 --> 00:55:34.264
United States Presidents
and their administrations.

00:55:34.264 --> 00:55:35.732
So yes we have to be involved

00:55:35.732 --> 00:55:37.067 align:start size:88% position:13%
and engaged in different
parts of the world

00:55:37.067 --> 00:55:39.736
where it suits our interests,

00:55:39.736 --> 00:55:42.172
particularly whether it
be economic and so forth.

00:55:42.172 --> 00:55:43.873 align:start size:97% position:3%
And again this is the Trump's
like what are we gettin'?

00:55:43.873 --> 00:55:45.675
Give us your oil stuff, right?

00:55:45.675 --> 00:55:48.878
He's using crass language
but the request is fair.

00:55:48.878 --> 00:55:51.014 align:start size:84% position:16%
But in places where
China or Russia

00:55:51.014 --> 00:55:55.118 align:start size:97% position:3%
that don't represent the
future of humanity in the way

00:55:55.118 --> 00:55:57.187 align:start size:97% position:3%
that I think you and I
would want all of us to be,

00:55:57.187 --> 00:56:00.557 align:start size:94% position:6%
like they're underwriting
corrupt regimes

00:56:00.557 --> 00:56:01.991
all over the world.

00:56:01.991 --> 00:56:04.828 align:start size:97% position:3%
Certainly China, definitely
in places like Africa.

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:08.131
What can we do to slow down
their reach and their power,

00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:09.532
because that is important,

00:56:09.532 --> 00:56:11.868
without committing a
ton of our resources,

00:56:11.868 --> 00:56:14.204 align:start size:88% position:13%
our people, and our
treasure to that, right?

00:56:14.204 --> 00:56:17.640
And then it becomes sort
of a strategic engagement

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.376 align:start size:97% position:3%
or withdrawal from different
parts of the world,

00:56:19.376 --> 00:56:22.011
because often times is aid
really the end of the day,

00:56:22.011 --> 00:56:26.116
we're paying people off
to keep the Russians out,

00:56:26.116 --> 00:56:28.651
the Chinese out, to try
to keep it a low boil,

00:56:28.651 --> 00:56:30.987
but not encouraging corruption.

00:56:30.987 --> 00:56:34.190 align:start size:97% position:3%
So that can be a very
difficult thing to balance.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:35.558
But I will tell you--
- Right you're probably

00:56:35.558 --> 00:56:36.826
gonna get a lotta corruption

00:56:36.826 --> 00:56:38.228
just as a result of it.
- You're going to get...

00:56:38.228 --> 00:56:40.463 align:start position:0%
Correct, so you have to
constantly keep a pulse on that.

00:56:40.463 --> 00:56:44.267
So it's not easy to do this.

00:56:44.267 --> 00:56:46.770
But I will tell you, I've
seen these aid projects

00:56:46.770 --> 00:56:49.339
in places like say in Zambia,

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:52.008
where we're giving
them all this money.

00:56:52.008 --> 00:56:53.543
For instance for
some of the tribes

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:56.513
we're giving them lots of
money to build fish ponds

00:56:56.513 --> 00:56:58.314
and yet you've got the world,

00:56:58.314 --> 00:57:00.450
these other NGOs coming
in and delivering food

00:57:00.450 --> 00:57:02.919
and so all the fish die
and the ponds go dry.

00:57:02.919 --> 00:57:04.187
But it's like well of course,

00:57:04.187 --> 00:57:05.755
because you're just
giving people food.

00:57:05.755 --> 00:57:07.991
They're not gonna schlep
out in this terrible heat

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:10.026
and like work, of
course they're not.

00:57:10.026 --> 00:57:13.830 align:start size:97% position:3%
So sometimes we do things
that are silly with our aid.

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:16.299
But the broader point,
the most important thing

00:57:16.299 --> 00:57:18.268
that we have to remember from
a foreign policy perspective

00:57:18.268 --> 00:57:20.069 align:start size:88% position:13%
is we're trying to
create more democracies.

00:57:20.069 --> 00:57:21.905
That's gonna be a
long loop process.

00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:23.473
It is not gonna happen
by the barrel of a gun

00:57:23.473 --> 00:57:25.642
and it's not gonna
happen tomorrow.

00:57:25.642 --> 00:57:27.477
So let's have some patience.

00:57:27.477 --> 00:57:29.446
And then where we are
engaged in the world,

00:57:29.446 --> 00:57:32.048 align:start size:84% position:16%
especially when it
comes to our military,

00:57:32.048 --> 00:57:33.383
damn right there
better be something

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:34.951
that the American people
are getting in return,

00:57:34.951 --> 00:57:36.719
because it can't be
this constant outlay.

00:57:36.719 --> 00:57:38.655 align:start size:84% position:16%
And that's what I
think you're seeing,

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:40.356 align:start size:84% position:16%
guys like Tucker
Carlson and others be

00:57:40.356 --> 00:57:42.792
very reluctant about
continued engagement

00:57:42.792 --> 00:57:44.227
in the Middle East.

00:57:44.227 --> 00:57:46.729 align:start size:97% position:3%
So change your energy
policy, make them irrelevant

00:57:46.729 --> 00:57:48.231
and now you can march forward.

00:57:48.231 --> 00:57:49.899 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You know it's interesting
that you bring up Tucker there

00:57:49.899 --> 00:57:52.635
because I see this
sort of split now

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:55.705 align:start size:81% position:19%
where Trump did
the strike in Iran

00:57:55.705 --> 00:57:57.607
and now suddenly Tucker
said well this is gonna

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:58.842
lead us to World War III.

00:57:58.842 --> 00:57:59.742
Trump's kinda just
like everybody else.

00:57:59.742 --> 00:58:00.977
- Yeah.

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:02.479
- And I like Tucker
very much, obviously.

00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:05.415
But I thought well everyone's
sorta jumpin' all over that,

00:58:05.415 --> 00:58:07.350
ah see this horrible
split that's occurred,

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:08.284 align:start size:72% position:28%
and oh my God.
- Right.

00:58:08.284 --> 00:58:09.619
- To me it's like this is great.

00:58:09.619 --> 00:58:11.254
- Right.

00:58:11.254 --> 00:58:13.189 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What a great debate
is happening on the
right, right now.

00:58:13.189 --> 00:58:14.123
- Right.

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:15.058
- You know can you do a strike?

00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.326
Does that lead to World War III?

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:17.794
Like what a beautiful thing.

00:58:17.794 --> 00:58:19.262
It's like where would that
happen on the left these days

00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:21.498 align:start size:94% position:6%
without someone being just
completely slaughtered

00:58:21.498 --> 00:58:22.999
in the crossfire.

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.267
- Well let's talk about what
the Democratic party has done

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:25.969
the last three to six
months about these,

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:27.570 align:start size:84% position:16%
so in terms of
foreign engagement.

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:30.240 line:0%
So Trump wants to
withdraw Syria,

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.708 line:0%
and you know he's
an idiot, right?

00:58:31.708 --> 00:58:32.909 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- Remember that conversation.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:32.909 --> 00:58:34.711 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- And now he's sending
people into Iraq

00:58:34.711 --> 00:58:36.312 line:0%
and well now he's an idiot.

00:58:36.312 --> 00:58:37.280 line:0%
Well what is it?

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.381
What do you guys want?

00:58:38.381 --> 00:58:40.083 align:start size:84% position:16%
What is your
strategy on the left?

00:58:40.083 --> 00:58:41.317 align:start size:81% position:19%
I mean I would
love to hear that.

00:58:41.317 --> 00:58:43.553
I mean we know what
Joe Biden likes to do

00:58:43.553 --> 00:58:45.288
in terms of some of his
foreign policy stuff.

00:58:45.288 --> 00:58:47.190 align:start size:94% position:6%
He's been wrong more
times than he's been right

00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:50.193
and sends his kid and
blesses his engagement

00:58:50.193 --> 00:58:52.061 align:start size:88% position:13%
with the corrupt Ukraine
oligarch and take a

00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:53.563
truckload of money.
- Oh let's, let's...

00:58:53.563 --> 00:58:54.764
Can we just finish
with that actually?

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:56.266
That's the right way to finish.

00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:57.667
I meant to get to it before
when we did the Russia stuff.

00:58:57.667 --> 00:59:01.771 align:start position:0%
So the Ukraine stuff and
impeachment and everything else.

00:59:01.771 --> 00:59:04.107
Is the basic takeaway here,

00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:05.775 align:start size:88% position:13%
beyond the obvious
stuff that everyone sees

00:59:05.775 --> 00:59:07.544 align:start size:84% position:16%
on the headlines,
like how insane it was

00:59:07.544 --> 00:59:08.578
that Hunter Biden's getting,

00:59:08.578 --> 00:59:09.979
what was it 50 grand a month?

00:59:09.979 --> 00:59:11.514 align:start size:97% position:3%
60, 80 grand a month?
- Sure whatever the amount is

00:59:11.514 --> 00:59:13.449 align:start size:97% position:3%
it's absurd and unacceptable.
- Something insane

00:59:13.449 --> 00:59:15.852 align:start size:97% position:3%
to work for an energy company
he had no expertise in,

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:17.120
blah, blah, blah.

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:19.155
His dad happened to be
vice-president, okay.

00:59:19.155 --> 00:59:21.224
That what it seems
that this all hinges

00:59:21.224 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start size:88% position:13%
on the idea that if
Trump felt legitimately

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:26.429
that there was corruption,
which there clearly was.

00:59:26.429 --> 00:59:27.897 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like nobody's really
debating whether

00:59:27.897 --> 00:59:29.699
something seriously
corrupt was going on.

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:31.367 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Jake Tapper's admitted
this on his program.

00:59:31.367 --> 00:59:32.201
Love it.

00:59:32.201 --> 00:59:33.670
- Jake is like 50, 50.

00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:35.438
It's like one day I'm like
Jake you get it, the next day

00:59:35.438 --> 00:59:36.706 align:start size:88% position:13%
he just doesn't get it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:59:36.706 --> 00:59:37.941
It's crazy.
- It's CNN.

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:39.509
- Bless his heart.
- It's a mind virus.

00:59:39.509 --> 00:59:41.678
But it seems that it all hinges

00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:43.780 align:start size:88% position:13%
on the idea that if
Trump genuinely believed

00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:45.014
that there was corruption,

00:59:45.014 --> 00:59:46.382 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I think every
sane person believes

00:59:46.382 --> 00:59:47.917 align:start size:97% position:3%
that there was corruption--
- Correct.

00:59:47.917 --> 00:59:48.851
- Then he had the,

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:51.588 align:start size:97% position:3%
is authorization the right--
- The obligation.

00:59:51.588 --> 00:59:53.189 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Or the obligation--
- Absolutely.

00:59:53.189 --> 00:59:55.124
- To actually do
something about it.

00:59:55.124 --> 00:59:57.694 align:start size:97% position:3%
Is that, is that, did I
get this thing kinda right?

00:59:57.694 --> 00:59:59.562
- Yes, right, and if
you look at polling,

00:59:59.562 --> 01:00:02.131
even I think it's some 40
odd percent of Democrats

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:04.167
actually think that what
the Bidens did was wrong

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.902 align:start size:84% position:16%
and deserves a
degree of scrutiny.

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:07.737
So you've got a good
chunk of the party,

01:00:07.737 --> 01:00:09.105
darn near half that think that

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:10.873 align:start size:94% position:6%
and of course independents
and Republicans

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:12.041
are fully on board with that.

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:13.409 align:start size:84% position:16%
So that's the
fundamental problem

01:00:13.409 --> 01:00:14.744
with this impeachment push.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:18.014
If there was nothing there,

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.415 align:start size:94% position:6%
if the Bidens did
absolutely nothing wrong,

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:20.850 align:start size:84% position:16%
then of course Trump
would have been

01:00:20.850 --> 01:00:22.819
absolutely, horrifically wrong

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:24.487 align:start size:94% position:6%
to ask them to get
involved in our politics,

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:27.090 align:start size:88% position:13%
or try to knee cap Biden
or any other person.

01:00:27.090 --> 01:00:28.825
But that's not the case.

01:00:28.825 --> 01:00:31.761 align:start size:94% position:6%
We know unquestionably,
just based on what we know

01:00:31.761 --> 01:00:34.263
from press reports and from,

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:37.867 align:start size:97% position:3%
we now have testimony by
Obama administration diplomat

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:41.504 align:start size:97% position:3%
that as early as 2015, they
were raising the flag in Kiev,

01:00:41.504 --> 01:00:43.573
saying hey look what
the Biden kid's doin'

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:46.409 align:start size:97% position:3%
is undercutting our ability
to fight corruption in Ukraine

01:00:46.409 --> 01:00:48.378 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they were told to
basically shut the hell up.

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:49.946 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well what about
that incredible video

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:51.547 align:start size:88% position:13%
of Biden just admitting
the whole thing.

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:53.282
- Well... (exhales loudly)

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:56.152
- Why doesn't that--
- It's all a scam.

01:00:56.152 --> 01:00:57.654
It's all a joke, it's all a scam

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.088
and this is when I wanna like,

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:00.556
I wanna channel--
- They're like

01:01:00.556 --> 01:01:02.058
it's so ridiculous, let's
just put it out there.

01:01:02.058 --> 01:01:03.526
- Yeah, this is when like I
wanna channel my inner Trump.

01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:05.361 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then be like it's a
witch hunt, it's all a scam.

01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:07.330
You know, because
it is, it's silly.

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:10.400
The Bidens did things that
were inappropriate and wrong.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.668 align:start size:84% position:16%
And they should have
been investigated

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:13.269
whether it be by the Ukrainians,

01:01:13.269 --> 01:01:15.605 align:start position:0%
whether it be by our
Department of Justice, or both,

01:01:15.605 --> 01:01:18.574
it's absolutely, enough
is there for us to say

01:01:18.574 --> 01:01:20.977
that was wrong and it
should be investigated.

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:22.512 align:start size:88% position:13%
And the fact that the
president's being called

01:01:22.512 --> 01:01:24.747
on the carpet for this and
impeached over his demand

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.382
to look into it,
I think is absurd.

01:01:26.382 --> 01:01:28.618 align:start size:97% position:3%
Put in committee, investigate
at the end of the day,

01:01:28.618 --> 01:01:30.119 align:start size:84% position:16%
but to actually
launch an impeachment

01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:33.089
and put this country through
something that is just silly,

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:36.793 align:start size:81% position:19%
it's absolutely
horrifically wrong

01:01:36.793 --> 01:01:40.096
of the Democratic party and
shame on Pelosi and Schumer

01:01:40.096 --> 01:01:41.831
and the legacy of the
past five, 10 years

01:01:41.831 --> 01:01:44.367
for what has happened under
the progressive leadership.

01:01:44.367 --> 01:01:46.636
I think you are going
to look back and say,

01:01:46.636 --> 01:01:48.604 align:start size:84% position:16%
what a sorrowful time
for this country.

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:50.707
- Well congratulations,
'cause as a Democrat

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:52.909 align:start size:84% position:16%
that thinks Trump
has to be re-elected

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.210
to get this thing to reset,

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:55.745
I'm pretty sure if you
ever wanted to fire up

01:01:55.745 --> 01:01:57.980
the Trump base you just did it
with a partisan impeachment.

01:01:57.980 --> 01:01:59.482
But what do you make
of now the fact that

01:01:59.482 --> 01:02:01.050 align:start size:88% position:13%
they're not even sending
this to the Senate?

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:03.419 align:start size:97% position:3%
So they do a completely
partisan impeachment, right,

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:05.655 align:start size:84% position:16%
completely partisan.
- Trump, Trump

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.190
is a Nazi guy, right,

01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:08.691
I mean he's Hitler.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.493
- So we were all living in--
- Well we better hold on this.

01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:12.028 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No right but--
- Let's hold on the paperwork.

01:02:12.028 --> 01:02:14.297
- We are living in Nazi Germany,

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.566
the equivalent of
modern day, right?

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.602
We're putting kids in cages
and Trump is Hitler, right?

01:02:19.602 --> 01:02:21.537 align:start size:88% position:13%
But you know what, let's
sit back for a while.

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:23.072 align:start size:84% position:16%
Let's sit back on
this impeachment stuff

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.006
for just a little bit.

01:02:24.006 --> 01:02:25.208
Let's think about this for,

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.176
like go to hell,
that's just absurd.

01:02:27.176 --> 01:02:29.779 align:start size:84% position:16%
And it defies logic,
it defies reason.

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:32.482
If you're gonna move forward,
you better have the facts,

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:35.284 align:start size:94% position:6%
and then let the American
people make the call.

01:02:35.284 --> 01:02:36.619
- Have you heard
the crazy theory

01:02:36.619 --> 01:02:38.488
that she's gonna sit
on it long enough,

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.289 align:start size:84% position:16%
that Pelosi will sit
on it long enough

01:02:40.289 --> 01:02:43.226 align:start size:84% position:16%
so that, assuming
Trump gets reelected,

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:45.094 align:start size:84% position:16%
but maybe something
happens in the Senate,

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:48.831 align:start position:0%
more favorably to the Democrats
then you move on it then.

01:02:48.831 --> 01:02:51.501 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean truly insanity.
- Well if that's

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:53.169 align:start size:88% position:13%
the strategy--
- And it's like, maybe.

01:02:53.169 --> 01:02:55.972
- I mean if that's
Pelosi's long game,

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:57.774
I'll tell you what, I
think she's gonna be

01:02:57.774 --> 01:02:59.275 line:0%
disappointed come next November.

01:02:59.275 --> 01:03:03.446 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Because in doing that,
she'd look flippin' absurd

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.181 line:0%
that most reasonable voters say,

01:03:05.181 --> 01:03:06.449 line:0%
these folks aren't serious.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:07.717 line:0%
They're not being
adults right now.

01:03:07.717 --> 01:03:09.685
You can have differences
with the administration,

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:11.387
with Trump in terms
of his temperament,

01:03:11.387 --> 01:03:12.989
in terms of some of his
policies, that's fine,

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:14.991
make the case, but
this kind of stuff,

01:03:14.991 --> 01:03:18.094
either if may, shit or
get off the pot, right?

01:03:18.094 --> 01:03:20.730
Move the impeachment forward
and move him out of office,

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:21.864
let the Senate judge,

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:23.232
and if they don't, tough.

01:03:23.232 --> 01:03:24.700
You've done your House, move on.

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.336
Now make the case to
the American people.

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.305 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I think you've proven
why I consider you

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:31.407 align:start size:88% position:13%
one of the few sane
people on Twitter here.

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:33.943 align:start position:0%
So I'm gonna tell the good
people to follow you on Twitter.

01:03:33.943 --> 01:03:38.948 align:start size:94% position:6%

Dean D-E-A-N W-R-I-G-H-T.

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:40.917
Thanks for coming in.

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:41.717
We're gonna have
to do this again.

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:42.952
- [Bryan] Can't wait.

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:43.886 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Once you move, once
you officially are like,

01:03:43.886 --> 01:03:45.721
left done, Democrat (mumbles).

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:48.658
- Hangin' by some nails brother.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:50.359
