00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.680
Cathy Glass

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:36.430
Cathy Glass was a 31-year-old woman who lived
in Cobb County, Georgia in 1991. She worked

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.090
at the Country Pines Apartments off South
Cobb Drive.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.739
In May 1991, Cathy’s neighbours heard noises
coming from Cathy’s apartment on Booth Road

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.310
in Marietta. Hearing the noises, the neighbours
called the police. When the officers arrived

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:57.500
at 15 Booth Road, they found Cathy’s body
lying in her apartment in a pool of blood.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.190
Her apartment had been ransacked.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.350
Included among the evidence collected at the
scene was a palm print. At the time of the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.110
crime, the print did not match anyone in the
law enforcement database. Police would question

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.340
her friends and family but nothing came out
of it.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.540
They also questioned neighbours and they said
they heard loud noises coming from the apartment

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.039
but did not see anyone come in or out of her
apartment. Police would continue their investigation

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:26.990
but no leads and no suspects the case would
eventually grow cold.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.430
The case reopened in 2014.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.230
Then in summer of 2019, The detective working
on the case, while sorting through the evidence

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.070
of Cathy’s case when he spotted a palm print
in one of the crime scene photos.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.880
At the time of Cathy’s murder, The database
only included fingerprints but only recently

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.220
the Automated Fingerprint Identification System
recently expanded its records to include palm

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.200
prints. The detective decided to send the
palm print for testing. This time the palm

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.880
print matched a 55-year-old man named Trent
Allen Brown.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.700
Trent was arrested on charges of Malice murder,
aggravated assault and burglary.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.900
He was already in jail in Indiana for burglary.
He has a long rap sheet that includes forgery,

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.140
theft, counterfeiting and receiving stolen
property. His latest conviction and sentencing

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.760
happened in 2018 with a release date of Sept.
1, 2021, but he will most likely find himself

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.330
behind bars for much longer if he is found
guilty of Cathy’s murder.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.989
Terri Lynn Hollis

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.400
In 1972, 11-year-old Terri Lynn Hollis was
living with her family in Torrance, California.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.180
On Thanksgiving day, November 23rd, 1972,
Terri went to play outside on her bike at

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.140
around 3pm. She would never return home.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.070
When Terri did not return home that night,
her family reported her missing. The police

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.381
would search around the neighbourhood that
night but could not find her. The next day,

00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:59.680
A fisherman found her body over 70 miles away,
wearing only a T-shirt.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.440
An autopsy later revealed that she had been
sexually assaulted and choked to death. Her

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.350
body was then dumped on a cliff below the
Pacific Coast Highway in Oxnard.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.031
Police believed that while on a bike ride,
Terri was most likely abducted. Detectives

00:03:15.031 --> 00:03:19.850
conducted more than 2,000 interviews and searches
in the local and surrounding areas in the

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.720
hopes to find any lead in the case. But nothing
would turn and the case would grow cold.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.840
In 2000, Detectives would reopen the case
and submitted DNA found at the crime scene

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.952
for comparative testing to the combined DNA
Index System but did not receive any matches.

00:03:35.952 --> 00:03:44.070
In 2018, Police submitted the DNA to Parabon-Nanolabs,
which conducted a genetic-genealogy analysis

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.670
on the DNA and found a potential match of
the suspect’s relative through a public

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.170
database.

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.550
That match led detectives to identify the
suspect as Jake Edward Brown. Brown died in

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.210
Arizona in 2003 and had previously been arrested
for narcotics, robbery and two rapes after

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:09.880
Hollis’, in April 1973 and again in April
1974. It is unclear whether he was convicted

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.680
for those crimes, but police do believe he
served some time in jail before he died of

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.680
illness.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.570
Detectives exhumed his body and collected
bone remains. Police used a company called

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.270
DNA Labs International in Virginia to extract
DNA and confirm that Jake Edward Brown was

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:33.490
the killer. The case was finally solved after
almost 5 decades.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.690
Pamela Milam

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:40.650
Pamela Milam was a 19-year-old girl studying
to become an English teacher at Indiana State

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.380
University. She was a member of the Sigma
Kappa sorority at the Indiana State and lived

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:52.200
with her parents and 2 sisters at their home
about 10 minutes from the Indiana State University.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.770
In September 1972, Pamela was staying at the
Sigma Kappa suite at ISU’S Lincoln Quad

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:05.100
during sorority rush festivities. On September
15, Pamela left Holmstedt Hall after a party

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.260
to move her car closer to the dorm and told
some of her sorority sisters she would return

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.419
to the suite in a few minutes.

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:13.120
She never returned.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:19.000
The next day, she missed her 8:00 am shift
at the library. No one had seen her all day.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.250
When no one had heard of her all day, she
was reported missing. Pamela’s parents would

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:27.650
spend the whole day searching for her at the
campus.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.490
Around 7 pm, two of her sorority sisters spotted
her 1964 Pontiac LeMans parked about a block

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.030
away from where it had been parked the day
before. Her glasses were seen through the

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.340
rear window of the car and her purse was in
the back seat.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.020
About an hour later, Pamela’s father arrived
with a spare set of keys. When they opened

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.440
the trunk of her car, they found Pamela’s
body. She had been bound with a clothesline

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.020
and her mouth was gagged. The gag was held
in place with a piece of white masking tape.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.930
She had bruises all over her body and she
had wounds on her head and face.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.770
All of the items used to tie her up had been
used at the rush party that Milam had been

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.541
at earlier and were in a box of decorations
she had been carrying to her car. A stick

00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:18.520
and other debris found between her pantyhose
and pants indicated her pants had been removed

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.830
at some point, likely in a wooded area. DNA
was recovered from a stain left on her light-blue

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.360
blouse.

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.070
An autopsy revealed she had died of strangulation.
Police had no witnesses and no descriptions

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.710
of who may have been responsible for her death.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.770
About seven weeks after the murder, a man
named Robert Wayne Austin was arrested for

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:45.610
a series of attempted and successful abductions
on the campus. Police said Austin would sexually

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.240
assault the students and then return them
back to the campus. Austin would eventually

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:54.440
be convicted of rape, sodomy and kidnapping
and sentenced to life in prison. He denied

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:59.300
having any involvement in Pamela’s murder
and police were never able to find any clues

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.650
that linked him to her murder.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.010
With no leads and no suspect, the case would
go cold.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:10.110
In 2001, the Indiana State Police lab did
an analysis of the stain found on Pamela’s

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.260
blouse. Austin’s DNA did not match the stain
on the blouse. A fingerprint found on the

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.770
door of Pamela’s car also did not match
Austin. The fingerprint was entered in the

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:24.590
Automated Fingerprint Identification System
but did not receive a match.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:30.070
In 2008, Terre Haute Police chief Shawn Keen
re-opened the case. The clothesline used to

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:34.270
bind Pamela helped establish a partial DNA
profile.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:40.810
Then in 2018, a DNA sample was sent to Parabon
NanoLabs in hopes to find a potential suspect.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.440
The result came back with a potential family
that the DNA might have come from.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:51.090
The family was investigated and further DNA
samples were analysed and Jeffrey Lynn Hand

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:56.979
was identified as the killer. DNA samples
from Jeffrey’s widow and his two sons helped

00:07:56.979 --> 00:08:00.310
link him to the stain found on Pamela’s
blouse.

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:06.190
Jeffrey was 23 years old at the time of Pamela’s
murder. He had been convicted in 1973 for

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:10.580
picking up a couple who were hitchhiking and
murdering the husband. The woman was able

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.960
to escape and call the police from a neighbouring
house. Jeffrey was eventually found not guilty

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:22.180
by reason of insanity but was committed to
the state reformatory until 1976.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.669
Then in 1976, Jeffrey was spotted trying to
abduct a woman near a Kokomo shopping mall.

00:08:27.669 --> 00:08:32.860
A police officer witnessed it and a pursuit
ensued. Jeffrey would eventually fire and

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:37.500
injure the police officer. Another officer
then shot and killed Jeffrey as he tried to

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.990
run away.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:43.560
After 47 years, Pamela’s family finally
got some closure knowing the identity of the

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:47.740
killer and his fate.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.000
Denise Sharon Kulb

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.650
Denise Sharon Kulb was a 27-year-old woman
who lived in Pennsylvania. In October on 1991,

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:01.839
She would move in with her boyfriend, Theodore
Dill Donahue. But just two weeks later, she

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:02.999
would move out.

00:09:02.999 --> 00:09:09.329
Sometime after October 19, 1991, Denise would
go missing. No one would report her missing.

00:09:09.329 --> 00:09:17.790
Then, on November 12th, 1991, her badly decomposed
body would be found. Denise was discovered

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:23.579
in a wooded, undeveloped cul-de-sac. She was
found wearing only a sweater, but two pairs

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:31.250
of pants, a T-shirt, jacket and one pale yellow
sock were discovered on top of the body. Because

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.050
of the decomposition, the autopsy by a Delaware
County medical examiner listed the manner

00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:44.420
of death as “undetermined and unnatural”
and the cause of death as “probably asphyxiation.”

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:50.380
Theodore was questioned and he said he had
last seen Denise on October 18, 1991, when

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:54.949
the pair had bought and used crack cocaine
together. He said that shortly after a man

00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:59.980
had robbed them at knifepoint. He told authorities
that Denise ran to get help and he never saw

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.470
her again.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:06.970
Denise’s family members told police that
they had last seen Denise on October 19th

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.040
at a funeral.
Denise’s sister said Denise had gotten into

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:15.420
a fight with Theodore outside of the bar where
she worked on October 19th. This was the last

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:18.050
time she was seen alive.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.170
On the day Denise’s body was discovered,
Theodore returned all the clothes she had

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:27.509
left behind at his apartment to her family
before the family was notified of her death.

00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:33.860
During his interview with the police, Theodore
admitted that his nickname was “Ted Bundy.”

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:38.420
He was considered a strong suspect in the
case and police searched his apartment days

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:42.899
later. During their search, they discovered
a yellow sock that appeared to match the one

00:10:42.899 --> 00:10:44.459
found at the crime scene. Even though a matching
sock was found, police did not have strong

00:10:44.459 --> 00:10:47.499
evidence to link him to the crime. At the
time, Theodore insisted he had no knowledge

00:10:47.499 --> 00:10:52.139
or involvement in Denise’s death. Eventually,
the case would grow cold.

00:10:52.139 --> 00:10:58.040
The case would be reopened in 2015 and Theodore
was reinterviewed. He admitted to police that

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:03.529
he had lied in his original story and he did
see Denise outside the bar on October 19th.

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:08.860
Phone records indicated Theodore and Denise
spoke before they met on that day at the bar.

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:13.589
The next few years, The police interviewed
Theodore’s family and friends. They would

00:11:13.589 --> 00:11:18.540
discover that Theodore had stayed at a motel
that was just over a mile from the crime scene

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.660
several times a year and that he'd shared
details about the crime scene that no one

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.079
but the perpetrator and the police would know.

00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:31.290
During his interview in 1991, Theodore had
asked police if Denise had been strangled

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:36.600
and he would call them twice more in 1991
to inquire about how she died. Authorities

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.050
would never tell Theodore how she died and
no media accounts reported the cause of her

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.050
death.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:47.439
In an interview, Lisa Campbell, who worked
with Theodore at a restaurant in the 1990s,

00:11:47.439 --> 00:11:51.880
said that he had told her that he once had
a roommate who died on the couch and that

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.399
he was questioned by police about the death.
“I found it odd. He acted like he got away

00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:00.100
with something”.

00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:04.939
Another acquaintance, Amber Booth, who had
been a roommate of Donahue’s in 2012 when

00:12:04.939 --> 00:12:07.699
they worked at Golden Crust Pizza in the 7100
block of Germantown Avenue, reported that

00:12:07.699 --> 00:12:12.420
Donahue told her one day he had just returned
from visiting a spot in the woods where a

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:16.970
former girlfriend’s body had been found.
He said that the woman’s name was Denise

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:23.509
and that she was found facedown, naked with
her legs spread something that was never released

00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:25.889
to the public.

00:12:25.889 --> 00:12:30.139
Investigators then took another look at the
sock that found with Denise’s body. The

00:12:30.139 --> 00:12:36.220
sock that was found at the crime scene was
lost so police with the help from Temple university’s

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:41.679
photography department, enhanced the details
of the sock in the image. The image of the

00:12:41.679 --> 00:12:46.439
sock was found to be a perfect match with
sock found in Theodore’s apartment.

00:12:46.439 --> 00:12:52.610
Theodore was finally arrested on 3rd September
2019 and charged with murder, abuse of a corpse,

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:58.480
tampering with evidence, obstruction of justice
and false reports to the police in 1991.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.920
Racine County Jane Doe

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:07.449
On 21st July 1999, a man and his teenage daughter
were walking their dog in Raymond, Wisconsin.

00:13:07.449 --> 00:13:13.499
It had rained the previous night and while
walking, they noticed drag marks on the ground.

00:13:13.499 --> 00:13:18.299
Curious, they followed it to a cornfield where
they stumbled upon the body of a deceased

00:13:18.299 --> 00:13:23.910
female. She appeared to have a broken arm
as it was sticking out at an odd angle. They

00:13:23.910 --> 00:13:27.819
alerted the local authorities who rushed to
the scene.

00:13:27.819 --> 00:13:33.040
An autopsy revealed that the woman had died
from severe injuries; she had been starved,

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.050
abused and tortured for a long time before
her death. She had received blunt force trauma

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:44.069
to her head, had a broken nose, cuts on her
head and on the bridge of her nose and forehead.

00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:50.339
She also suffered blunt force trauma to her
chest, abdomen, wrists, hands, and fingers

00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:55.740
and had numerous cuts all over her body. She
had also been sexually assaulted. She had

00:13:55.740 --> 00:14:02.509
burns on more than 25% of her body; her head,
face, neck, arms and upper torso. Her death

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:07.730
was ruled to be the result of multiple homicidal
injuries. She was estimated to be between

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:13.237
18-35 years old and was most likely cognitively
disabled as she appeared to have a small brain

00:14:13.237 --> 00:14:14.237
cavity with-in the skull.

00:14:14.237 --> 00:14:17.220
As it had rained the previous night, very
little evidence of the perpetrator was found

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:22.559
at the crime scene. When she was discovered,
she was wearing a men’s grey-country shirt

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:27.790
with embroidered red flowers on the front
and snap buttons. She was also wearing black

00:14:27.790 --> 00:14:30.769
sweatpants and did not have shoes or socks
on her.

00:14:30.769 --> 00:14:38.129
Over 50 people attended her funeral on October
27, 1999, after her autopsy. She was interred

00:14:38.129 --> 00:14:45.569
at Holy Family Cemetery in Caledonia, Wisconsin.
Her gravestone read "Daughter: Jane Doe",

00:14:45.569 --> 00:14:52.259
along with the dates of discovery and burial,
with the phrase "Gone, but not forgotten."

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:56.480
Detectives travelled to various homeless shelters
throughout Wisconsin and spoke to paediatric

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:01.170
and Dental offices throughout the country.
They also contacted agencies that work with

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:06.939
disabled children in hopes to find any lead
but to no avail.

00:15:06.939 --> 00:15:10.970
Multiple facial reconstructions were created
and distributed to the public in hopes of

00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:20.869
someone recognizing Jane Doe.

00:15:20.869 --> 00:15:26.350
On October 16th 2013, her body was exhumed
and her remains were sent to The Milwaukee

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:32.489
County Medical Examiner for Chemical Isotope
testing. This test measures the natural variations

00:15:32.489 --> 00:15:36.879
in a body and helps determine where a person
has spent significant time throughout their

00:15:36.879 --> 00:15:37.879
life.

00:15:37.879 --> 00:15:39.350
For twenty years the Jane Doe, who came to
be known as “Racine County Jane Doe” or

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:40.350
“Crystal Rae”, would remain unidentified.

00:15:40.350 --> 00:15:42.949
On October 20, 2016, it was announced that
chemical isotope testing performed by the

00:15:42.949 --> 00:15:48.730
Smithsonian on a sample of her hair and bone
suggest she may originally have been from

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:55.600
or spent several years of her life in Alaska,
Montana or portions of southern Canada.

00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:01.059
Then in September 2019, The Racine County
police received a tip from someone that a

00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:05.989
local woman was telling people that she had
killed a woman back when she lived in Illinois

00:16:05.989 --> 00:16:07.639
in the ’90s.

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:14.049
The suspect would be identified as a 64-year-old
nurse named Linda Sue LaRoche. And on November

00:16:14.049 --> 00:16:20.879
8, 2019, Racine County authorities identified
the victim, through DNA comparison, as Peggy

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:24.489
Lynn Johnson, 23, of McHenry, Illinois.

00:16:24.489 --> 00:16:30.290
It was found that Peggy did not have any relatives
and was never reported missing. Her mother,

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:36.689
father and brother were all dead by the 1990’s.
In the '90s, Peggy was about 18-years-old,

00:16:36.689 --> 00:16:41.100
cognitively impaired and on her own when she
went searching for help at a medical clinic

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:47.299
in McHenry, Illinois. There she would meet
a registered nurse, Linda Laroche. Linda claimed

00:16:47.299 --> 00:16:52.569
that she had experience and was aware of the
teenager's condition and took her into her

00:16:52.569 --> 00:16:53.569
home.

00:16:53.569 --> 00:16:57.949
According to Linda’s children, she had taken
Peggy in to work as a nanny and housekeeper

00:16:57.949 --> 00:17:02.829
in exchange for a place to live. Her children
told police that their mother would physically,

00:17:02.829 --> 00:17:08.419
verbally and emotionally abuse Peggy. Linda
had allegedly once stabbed Peggy in the head

00:17:08.419 --> 00:17:13.929
with a pitchfork. When not working Peggy was
forced to live in the crawlspace under the

00:17:13.929 --> 00:17:15.850
house.

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:20.240
Investigators also talked to Linda’s ex-husband
and he recalled that the last time he had

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:26.130
seen Peggy was at their home when he found
her lying on the ground lifeless. Linda had

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:29.870
told him that Peggy had overdosed and she
was going to take her away from their house

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:32.620
so they would not be involved.

00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:38.320
Investigators interrogated Linda and she admitted
to abusing Peggy and claimed Peggy would steal,

00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:42.680
have men come to see her at their house, and
that she would go into the crawlspace of their

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:49.310
house to steal medications. She said one day
Peggy was holding pills before she fainted.

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:54.350
As she was a registered nurse, she didn’t
call the Ambulance. Peggy eventually regained

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:59.890
consciousness. Linda then claimed she couldn’t
tolerate Peggy anymore and took her to a nearby

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:05.490
phone booth. She called Peggy’s grandmother
and then turned her over to her grandmother.

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.740
But when police confronted her that they had
talked to Peggy’s grandmother and she had

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:15.190
no idea who Linda was, she changed her story.
She now claimed that she was not sure who

00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:20.430
the person was that Peggy left with. She would
again change her story and said that she had

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:26.050
abandoned Peggy, while alive, along a roadway
in Wisconsin. Linda theorised that something

00:18:26.050 --> 00:18:31.310
must have happened to her after she had dropped
her off. Police did not buy her story and

00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:36.420
she was arrested in Florida and charged with
first-degree intentional homicide and hiding

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:42.290
a corpse. She has waived extradition and is
in the process of being moved to Racine, Wisconsin

00:18:42.290 --> 00:18:43.950
to face trail.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:50.270
Arrangements are being made for Peggy to be
laid to rest as her true identity and buried

00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:51.170
alongside her mother.
