(heart beating)
(siren wailing)

00:00:05.126 --> 00:00:06.438
- This week on Buzzfeed Unsolved,

00:00:06.438 --> 00:00:08.428
we cover the assassination
of John F. Kennedy,

00:00:08.428 --> 00:00:11.179
a topic of controversy
for over five decades.

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.908
Was there actually a conspiracy?

00:00:13.908 --> 00:00:15.179
What do you think?

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.529
I'm sure you are well-versed
in this one already.

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:19.515
- I know the broad strokes.

00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:20.874
I haven't really gotten into details.

00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:24.252
I figure I'll read like a
1,600-page book when I'm like 60.

00:00:24.252 --> 00:00:26.536
- Yeah, you don't strike
me as a detail guy.

00:00:26.536 --> 00:00:27.522
- I am a detail guy.

00:00:27.522 --> 00:00:28.355
- Let's get into it.

00:00:28.355 --> 00:00:29.188
- Okay.

00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:30.161
(both laughing)

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:32.911
- On Friday, November 22nd, 1963,

00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:36.751
President John F. Kennedy
was publicly assassinated

00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:40.560
while sitting in a car in a
motorcade through Dallas, Texas.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.154
Kennedy was struck by two bullets,

00:00:43.154 --> 00:00:46.149
with the second being a fatal headshot.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.526
Governor John B. Connally Jr.,
who was in the car with JFK,

00:00:50.526 --> 00:00:54.229
was also hit in the
shooting, but survived.

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:58.168
Officially, there were three
bullets fired by the gunman.

00:00:58.168 --> 00:01:00.525
The horrifying act was caught on film

00:01:00.525 --> 00:01:02.864
by a man named Abraham Zapruder

00:01:02.864 --> 00:01:05.108
with his eight-millimeter film camera.

00:01:05.108 --> 00:01:08.329
The film, now referred
to as the Zapruder film,

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.173
would later go on to be
integral into the investigation

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:14.361
as it allowed for frame-by-frame analysis.

00:01:14.361 --> 00:01:17.008
The shooting occurred from
the sixth floor window

00:01:17.008 --> 00:01:20.791
at the southeast corner of the
Texas School Book Depository,

00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.916
a building along the motorcade route.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.891
The official ruling was that the gunman

00:01:24.891 --> 00:01:27.730
was a man named Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.920
Two days after the assassination,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.958
Oswald was killed by a man named Jack Ruby

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.129
at the Dallas Police Department.

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:40.109
In fact, that shooting was
broadcast on live television.

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.081
I gotta say, kudos to that
camera guy for holding that shot

00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:45.547
'cause if a gunshot went
off, all bets are off for me.

00:01:45.547 --> 00:01:46.892
- I would throw the camera at the

00:01:46.892 --> 00:01:49.815
ceiling, scream, and just run.

00:01:49.815 --> 00:01:51.135
- Oh, I wouldn't think about anything--

00:01:51.135 --> 00:01:53.399
- I'd go (screams).

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.625
- [Ryan] Returning to JFK, there are many

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:57.737
who have criticized the motorcade route,

00:01:57.737 --> 00:02:00.728
believing it to have an
unusual amount of turns,

00:02:00.728 --> 00:02:04.089
which would have caused the
motorcade to have to slow down.

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:06.584
The route was chosen by
Secret Service agents,

00:02:06.584 --> 00:02:09.651
Winston G. Lawson and Forrest V. Sorrels.

00:02:09.651 --> 00:02:11.886
Secret Servicemen sent
in advance to check out

00:02:11.886 --> 00:02:13.260
the route noted that there were

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.358
over 20,000 windows overlooking the route.

00:02:16.358 --> 00:02:18.050
But since they didn't have enough men

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.154
to station at every window, they opted

00:02:20.154 --> 00:02:22.876
to inspect none of the
windows along the route.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:25.106
- [Shane] (laughs) Not a good alternative.

00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:26.296
- [Ryan] (laughs) I know.

00:02:26.296 --> 00:02:27.639
"Eh, there's far too many.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:29.158
"Eh, fuck it.
(Shane laughs)

00:02:29.158 --> 00:02:31.324
"You know what, just call it a day."

00:02:31.324 --> 00:02:32.395
- [Shane] "We don't have enough guys

00:02:32.395 --> 00:02:33.562
"to look at all these windows.

00:02:33.562 --> 00:02:35.442
"What if we just don't do shit?"

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:36.577
(Ryan laughs)

00:02:36.577 --> 00:02:37.751
"Eh, sounds like a good idea."

00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:38.709
- [Ryan] "But, sir, the President's

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.350
"gonna be coming to town."

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.472
"Eh, he won't care."

00:02:41.472 --> 00:02:43.033
- [Shane] "What are they
gonna do, shoot 'em?"

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:44.738
(Ryan laughs)

00:02:44.738 --> 00:02:46.472
- [Ryan] One week after the assassination,

00:02:46.472 --> 00:02:49.211
newly sworn-in President
and former Vice President,

00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:52.372
Lyndon B. Johnson, created
a commission to investigate

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.254
the circumstances of the JFK assassination

00:02:55.254 --> 00:02:58.244
and subsequent killing
of Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:02:58.244 --> 00:02:59.765
This commission was to be headed

00:02:59.765 --> 00:03:02.287
by Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren

00:03:02.287 --> 00:03:05.110
and staffed with other esteemed officials,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.507
And while the official findings
of the commission believes

00:03:07.507 --> 00:03:11.234
there was only one shooter, it
does have one thing in common

00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:13.378
with numerous conspiracy theories,

00:03:13.378 --> 00:03:15.937
that the shooter was Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:03:15.937 --> 00:03:18.809
And with that, let's get
into the main theory,

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:21.656
which is the official ruling
by the Warren Commission

00:03:21.656 --> 00:03:23.754
that Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated

00:03:23.754 --> 00:03:27.612
JFK alone, with no conspiracy involved.

00:03:27.612 --> 00:03:30.667
Let's get into the background
of Lee Harvey Oswald.

00:03:30.667 --> 00:03:33.348
Oswald had been in Russia in 1959

00:03:33.348 --> 00:03:36.176
and had tried to renounce
his American citizenship.

00:03:36.176 --> 00:03:39.138
Oswald had a history of
violence from a young age.

00:03:39.138 --> 00:03:41.666
He once chased a
half-brother with a knife.

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:44.962
And while in the Marine Corps,
where he spent three years,

00:03:44.962 --> 00:03:48.435
he became qualified as a
sharpshooter with the M-1 rifle.

00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:50.931
Oswald, a Dallas resident, was actually

00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:54.861
under active surveillance
by the FBI office in Dallas.

00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:58.836
However, the local FBI
strangely did not inform

00:03:58.836 --> 00:04:01.187
the Secret Service about Oswald.

00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:03.434
This is especially shocking considering

00:04:03.434 --> 00:04:05.685
the fact that Oswald was employed

00:04:05.685 --> 00:04:07.967
at the Texas School Book Depository,

00:04:07.967 --> 00:04:10.318
a location right along
the motorcade route,

00:04:10.318 --> 00:04:13.799
from where Oswald would
eventually fire the fatal shots

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.787
from the southeast corner
of the sixth floor window.

00:04:16.787 --> 00:04:20.367
However, to be fair, the
Secret Service did not inform

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:23.568
the local FBI office of
the motorcade route either.

00:04:23.568 --> 00:04:26.279
So, this was a mishandling
on both of their parts.

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.462
They didn't clue the Secret Service in.

00:04:28.462 --> 00:04:29.639
"Hey, there's kind of like a guy

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.920
"who's kind of crazy, hates America,

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:34.635
"sharpshooter, right along
where you're gonna be."

00:04:34.635 --> 00:04:36.131
But then again, I guess
they wouldn't know that

00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:37.985
because the Secret Service didn't let

00:04:37.985 --> 00:04:40.209
the FBI know of the motorcade route,

00:04:40.209 --> 00:04:41.369
which would be the first thing,

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:43.095
or one of the first things I would do.

00:04:43.095 --> 00:04:47.277
- Communication is important
in all fields, right?

00:04:47.277 --> 00:04:48.724
- Do you think I'm being too harsh--

00:04:48.724 --> 00:04:49.557
- [Shane] No, I don't think so.

00:04:49.557 --> 00:04:51.670
- In thinking that these were obvious

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.065
steps that should have been taken?

00:04:53.065 --> 00:04:56.739
- I think if you were in
one of those departments,

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:59.537
Jack Kennedy would probably
still be alive today.

00:04:59.537 --> 00:05:01.406
- Wow, that's that's high praise.

00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:03.238
So you think I could've
saved the President?

00:05:03.238 --> 00:05:04.619
- You know what, I'll give you it.

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:06.600
I think you could've saved him.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.968
- [Ryan] Here are direct quotes
from the Warren Commission

00:05:08.968 --> 00:05:12.137
in regards to evidence proving
Oswald was the shooter.

00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:16.435
Quote, "The Mannlicher-Carcano
6.5-millimeter Italian rifle

00:05:16.435 --> 00:05:19.082
"from which the shots
were fired was owned by

00:05:19.082 --> 00:05:22.036
"and in the possession
of Oswald," end quote.

00:05:22.036 --> 00:05:23.949
This was determined due to the fact

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.028
that there was a nearly
whole bullet recovered

00:05:26.028 --> 00:05:27.820
from Governor Connally's stretcher,

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.701
and two bullet fragments in the
car that matched that rifle.

00:05:31.701 --> 00:05:35.097
Quote, "To the exclusion of
all other weapons," end quote.

00:05:35.097 --> 00:05:38.089
The rifle was found hidden
near the sixth floor window,

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:39.969
as well as three bullet cartridges

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.443
matching the three shots heard.

00:05:41.443 --> 00:05:44.030
Continuing with the
commission's evidence, quote,

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:47.426
"Oswald had attempted to kill
Major General Edwin A. Walker

00:05:47.426 --> 00:05:50.984
"on April 10th, 1963,
thereby demonstrating

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:53.842
"his disposition to take
human life," end quote.

00:05:53.842 --> 00:05:56.683
So, this isn't his first big hit job.

00:05:56.683 --> 00:05:57.635
- [Shane] No.

00:05:57.635 --> 00:05:59.179
- [Ryan] The first one he missed.

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:00.784
Imagine he trained like a madman,

00:06:00.784 --> 00:06:02.493
so that he wouldn't miss again.

00:06:02.493 --> 00:06:04.831
- [Shane] Man, he's gotta
be good though, right?

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.374
- [Ryan] I mean, he hit two for three.

00:06:06.374 --> 00:06:07.207
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:06:07.207 --> 00:06:09.748
- [Ryan] Furthermore,
Oswald unquestionably

00:06:09.748 --> 00:06:13.359
also killed Dallas policeman
J. D. Tippit with a revolver

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:16.661
approximately 45 minutes
after the assassination.

00:06:16.661 --> 00:06:19.052
This is backed up by eyewitness testimony

00:06:19.052 --> 00:06:20.947
and also due to the cartridge cases found

00:06:20.947 --> 00:06:23.673
at the scene belonging
to a revolver on Oswald

00:06:23.673 --> 00:06:27.163
at the time of his arrest,
among other things as well.

00:06:27.163 --> 00:06:30.041
So, he also killed somebody
right after the assassination.

00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:32.303
- [Shane] At that point though, you know.

00:06:32.303 --> 00:06:33.301
- [Ryan] I mean, you killed the President.

00:06:33.301 --> 00:06:34.369
Everything else is below that.

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:36.653
- [Shane] Yeah, it's like,
when you eat a big meal

00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:39.149
and then have a little snack afterward.

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:41.103
- [Ryan] Yeah, like if you
go eat Chipotle for lunch,

00:06:41.103 --> 00:06:42.417
might as well have a muffin after.

00:06:42.417 --> 00:06:43.565
- [Shane] Might as well have a muffin.

00:06:43.565 --> 00:06:44.919
- [Ryan] You're already
doing damage to your body.

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.653
Might as well finish the job.

00:06:46.653 --> 00:06:49.300
- Do you think he uttered
the phrase, "Might as well"?

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.100
- (laughs) As he did it?

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.929
With all that in mind, it seems

00:06:52.929 --> 00:06:55.606
pretty clear that Oswald was the shooter.

00:06:55.606 --> 00:06:59.180
However, many have wondered
if Oswald acted alone.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.866
Unfortunately, due to
the fact that Oswald was

00:07:01.866 --> 00:07:05.125
killed by Jack Ruby, we
may never know for sure.

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:07.324
And while it should be noted
that the Warren Commission

00:07:07.324 --> 00:07:09.692
found no evidence that Ruby or Oswald

00:07:09.692 --> 00:07:12.170
were part of a conspiracy
to kill the President,

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.533
it's natural to wonder if Ruby may

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:17.446
have killed Oswald to keep him quiet.

00:07:17.446 --> 00:07:20.272
The Warren Commission also found, quote,

00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:22.720
"No evidence that Oswald was involved

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.344
"with any person or group in a conspiracy

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:28.161
"to assassinate the President," end quote.

00:07:28.161 --> 00:07:30.593
The Warren Commission
was firm in their belief

00:07:30.593 --> 00:07:32.886
that Oswald was the sole shooter.

00:07:32.886 --> 00:07:35.614
To examine that, let's take
a closer look at the scene

00:07:35.614 --> 00:07:39.580
of the crime, and more
specifically, the bullets fired.

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.900
The Warren Commission believes

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.022
that there were only three bullets fired

00:07:43.022 --> 00:07:45.509
with these three subsequent results.

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:48.966
The first bullet missed,
the second bullet hit JFK

00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:51.788
in the neck and also
hit Governor Connally,

00:07:51.788 --> 00:07:54.675
and the third bullet
was the fatal headshot.

00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:58.338
The second bullet, in particular,
is the most controversial,

00:07:58.338 --> 00:07:59.865
and that the Warren Commission

00:07:59.865 --> 00:08:02.865
posits it hit both JFK and Connally.

00:08:03.758 --> 00:08:07.145
This idea is referred to
as the magic bullet theory.

00:08:07.145 --> 00:08:10.103
The Commission theorizes that
from the sixth floor window,

00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:12.994
the bullet entered through
the back of JFK's neck,

00:08:12.994 --> 00:08:15.640
exiting downward, then
entered through Connolly's

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.932
right side of his back,
exited below his right nipple,

00:08:18.932 --> 00:08:21.928
then entered and exited
through Connolly's right wrist,

00:08:21.928 --> 00:08:25.231
and, finally, ended in
Connolly's left thigh.

00:08:25.231 --> 00:08:28.166
They even concluded that
the nearly full bullet found

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:31.560
in Connally's stretcher
was this second bullet.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.924
However, this magic bullet,
as it's often referred

00:08:34.924 --> 00:08:38.637
to online, has been met with
a fair share of skepticism.

00:08:38.637 --> 00:08:41.088
The main point of contention
is that many believe

00:08:41.088 --> 00:08:44.616
the trajectory from the sixth
floor window is impossible.

00:08:44.616 --> 00:08:46.985
Yet, computer renderings of the event

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:48.929
have shown that it is indeed possible

00:08:48.929 --> 00:08:50.963
when you consider that
Governor Connally was

00:08:50.963 --> 00:08:52.941
sitting on a lower seat than Kennedy,

00:08:52.941 --> 00:08:55.791
and also when you consider
their body positions.

00:08:55.791 --> 00:08:58.520
That being said, I do
find it hard to believe

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.038
that this so-called magic
bullet would be nearly intact

00:09:02.038 --> 00:09:04.334
after traveling through two bodies.

00:09:04.334 --> 00:09:06.856
- That first one went through JFK's--

00:09:06.856 --> 00:09:07.689
- Neck.

00:09:07.689 --> 00:09:08.592
- Neck, oh!

00:09:08.592 --> 00:09:10.077
- Out the front.
- Christ!

00:09:10.077 --> 00:09:13.232
- Through Connolly's back, right here,

00:09:13.232 --> 00:09:15.075
under his nipple, came out there.

00:09:15.075 --> 00:09:17.057
It went through his right wrist
that was sitting like this.

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.400
- Boof!
- Went through that,

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:21.025
landed in his left thigh and stayed there.

00:09:21.025 --> 00:09:22.511
- That's a lot for one bullet.

00:09:22.511 --> 00:09:24.200
- And a lot for one bullet to stay intact.

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.033
- Yeah.

00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:27.027
- [Ryan] Interestingly, the
Warren Commission claims

00:09:27.027 --> 00:09:29.395
the magic bullet theory is not integral

00:09:29.395 --> 00:09:32.554
to their theory that Oswald
was the sole shooter.

00:09:32.554 --> 00:09:36.020
However, when you examine the
frames of the Zapruder film,

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:38.502
it shows that there was
not enough time for Oswald

00:09:38.502 --> 00:09:41.005
to fire two shots within the time span

00:09:41.005 --> 00:09:43.710
that JFK and Connally were first hit.

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:47.229
Basically, if the magic
bullet theory isn't true,

00:09:47.229 --> 00:09:49.007
then there had to be two shooters.

00:09:49.007 --> 00:09:50.225
Do you follow that?

00:09:50.225 --> 00:09:51.528
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:09:51.528 --> 00:09:52.624
- [Ryan] Makes sense, right?

00:09:52.624 --> 00:09:54.265
- [Shane] Yeah, so I'm just gonna

00:09:54.265 --> 00:09:55.978
guess it's a single bullet, then.

00:09:55.978 --> 00:10:00.280
- I mean, now let me disprove
the single-bullet theory.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.901
- Okay, I'll let you do that.

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:03.738
- (laughs) Okay.

00:10:03.738 --> 00:10:05.617
Taking that into consideration,

00:10:05.617 --> 00:10:09.015
let's attempt to disprove
the magic bullet theory.

00:10:09.015 --> 00:10:10.721
Here is a quote from Governor Connally

00:10:10.721 --> 00:10:13.705
in a 1966 interview with Life Magazine.

00:10:13.705 --> 00:10:17.387
Quote, "There is my absolute
knowledge, and Nellie's too,

00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:20.234
"that one bullet caused the
President's first wound,

00:10:20.234 --> 00:10:24.268
"and that an entirely separate
shot struck me," end quote.

00:10:24.268 --> 00:10:26.706
As stated before, if this is true,

00:10:26.706 --> 00:10:28.659
then it had to be two shooters.

00:10:28.659 --> 00:10:31.941
Let's also look at the
testimony of James T. Tague,

00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:34.211
a spectator along the motorcade route

00:10:34.211 --> 00:10:37.202
who claims that a stray bullet
hit the sidewalk near him

00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:40.048
and a fragment of that bullet
struck him in the cheek.

00:10:40.048 --> 00:10:42.312
There was in fact a mark
on the sidewalk that,

00:10:42.312 --> 00:10:44.005
according to the Warren Commission report,

00:10:44.005 --> 00:10:45.819
quote, "Could have originated from the

00:10:45.819 --> 00:10:47.939
"lead core of a bullet," end quote.

00:10:47.939 --> 00:10:50.479
This potential stray bullet is noteworthy

00:10:50.479 --> 00:10:53.372
because Tague claims this
stray bullet was actually

00:10:53.372 --> 00:10:56.311
the second shot and not the first shot,

00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:59.643
which is particularly damning
to the magic bullet theory,

00:10:59.643 --> 00:11:02.713
which posits that the magic
bullet was the second shot

00:11:02.713 --> 00:11:04.882
and the missed bullet was the first.

00:11:04.882 --> 00:11:07.580
So either Tague
misinterpreted the situation

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.665
or there were more than
three bullets fired.

00:11:09.665 --> 00:11:12.703
And if you recall, there was
only three cartridges found

00:11:12.703 --> 00:11:15.912
by Oswald's window in the
Texas School Book Depository,

00:11:15.912 --> 00:11:18.573
so that would suggest
more than one shooter.

00:11:18.573 --> 00:11:22.623
Furthermore, in the 1970s, a
new acoustic research technique

00:11:22.623 --> 00:11:25.407
was used to analyze the
audio of the shooting,

00:11:25.407 --> 00:11:28.442
which found six points
in the audio that could

00:11:28.442 --> 00:11:31.850
contain echo patterns
similar to those of gunfire.

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.864
This further suggests that there may

00:11:33.864 --> 00:11:35.765
have been more than one shooter.

00:11:35.765 --> 00:11:38.538
There's even supposedly footage
of the JFK assassination

00:11:38.538 --> 00:11:40.889
from an angle different
than the Zapruder film.

00:11:40.889 --> 00:11:43.217
This alternate footage reportedly shows

00:11:43.217 --> 00:11:45.951
a now infamous grassy
knoll in the background.

00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:47.705
People who have seen the footage claim

00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:49.744
to see anything from puffs of gun smoke

00:11:49.744 --> 00:11:52.619
or a second shooter located
on the grassy knoll.

00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:56.125
However, this footage has
supposedly gone missing.

00:11:56.125 --> 00:12:00.062
- [Shane] (sighs) I know
people want to figure this out,

00:12:00.062 --> 00:12:01.560
and that people wanted justice,

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:03.499
but this just seems like a lot of work.

00:12:03.499 --> 00:12:05.404
- [Ryan] Have I not made
great points here, though?

00:12:05.404 --> 00:12:07.322
- [Shane] Yeah, you have,
but it's like, I don't know.

00:12:07.322 --> 00:12:08.882
It's not gonna bring him back to life.

00:12:08.882 --> 00:12:10.222
It's not gonna put his head back together.

00:12:10.222 --> 00:12:11.993
- [Ryan] Well, wouldn't you
like to know what happened?

00:12:11.993 --> 00:12:13.778
Do you really want to go on
the rest of your life thinking

00:12:13.778 --> 00:12:15.682
it was the sole actions of a madman

00:12:15.682 --> 00:12:18.523
and not a larger part of a
conspiracy or a bigger thing?

00:12:18.523 --> 00:12:20.547
- I'm content with that, I guess.

00:12:20.547 --> 00:12:22.782
Here's the thing, if it was a conspiracy,

00:12:22.782 --> 00:12:26.834
if it was a secretive group
operating, they did a great job.

00:12:26.834 --> 00:12:27.801
I commend them.

00:12:27.801 --> 00:12:29.240
- (laughs) No, this isn't--

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.895
- Hey, you fooled us.

00:12:30.895 --> 00:12:32.097
Let's move on, you know?

00:12:32.097 --> 00:12:34.121
- [Ryan] Cynthia Nix
Jackson, the granddaughter

00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:36.010
of the person who took the film,

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:38.611
sued the US government for $10 million

00:12:38.611 --> 00:12:41.520
in 2015 for the return of the film.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.179
Apparently, this film has not been seen

00:12:44.179 --> 00:12:48.217
since the House Select Committee
on Assassinations in 1978.

00:12:48.217 --> 00:12:51.659
This committee, by the
way, was formed in 1976

00:12:51.659 --> 00:12:54.339
to conduct an investigation
into the assassinations

00:12:54.339 --> 00:12:56.895
of JFK and Martin Luther King Jr.

00:12:56.895 --> 00:13:00.111
Why it was formed is
of particular interest.

00:13:00.111 --> 00:13:02.695
The House Select Committee
on Assassinations was formed

00:13:02.695 --> 00:13:04.424
after a Senate committee confirmed

00:13:04.424 --> 00:13:07.443
that the CIA had purposefully
withheld information

00:13:07.443 --> 00:13:09.889
from the Warren Commission investigation.

00:13:09.889 --> 00:13:11.823
The information withheld involved

00:13:11.823 --> 00:13:14.313
plots to assassinate Fidel Castro.

00:13:14.313 --> 00:13:16.708
The House Select Committee
on Assassinations concluded

00:13:16.708 --> 00:13:20.797
in 1978 that scientific
acoustical evidence established

00:13:20.797 --> 00:13:25.400
a high probability that
two gunmen had shot at JFK.

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.725
Also, here's a direct quote
from the committee's findings.

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:31.084
Quote, "The committee
believes on the basis

00:13:31.084 --> 00:13:32.872
"of the evidence available to it,

00:13:32.872 --> 00:13:35.328
"that President John
F. Kennedy was probably

00:13:35.328 --> 00:13:38.474
"assassinated as a result of a conspiracy.

00:13:38.474 --> 00:13:41.852
"The committee is unable to
identify the other gunmen

00:13:41.852 --> 00:13:45.322
"or the extent of the
conspiracy," end quote.

00:13:45.322 --> 00:13:47.688
That's the government
concluding that, not me.

00:13:47.688 --> 00:13:49.279
- [Shane] Yeah, again, I'm good with that.

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:53.246
- [Ryan] (laughs) You seem just so,

00:13:53.246 --> 00:13:55.179
I don't know, I don't know what--

00:13:55.179 --> 00:13:57.791
- [Shane] You know, I trust
whatever anybody says about it.

00:13:57.791 --> 00:14:00.223
If the CIA is withholding information

00:14:00.223 --> 00:14:02.698
that they don't want us
to know, great, you know?

00:14:02.698 --> 00:14:04.976
- That's a major bomb just
being dropped right there

00:14:04.976 --> 00:14:06.334
and you seem indifferent to it.

00:14:06.334 --> 00:14:07.855
How is that not like, holy shit?

00:14:07.855 --> 00:14:10.243
How are the gears not turning
in your brain now going,

00:14:10.243 --> 00:14:11.966
"What else are they withholding?"

00:14:11.966 --> 00:14:14.337
- JFK made a tonne of enemies.

00:14:14.337 --> 00:14:16.405
That guy was shady as hell.

00:14:16.405 --> 00:14:19.061
- Oh my god, what is this
gonna turn to, a character--

00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:21.369
- I'm just saying, if you go around

00:14:21.369 --> 00:14:24.086
doing shady shit, you know, that's not--

00:14:24.086 --> 00:14:25.164
- I mean, I think every president

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:26.228
has had to do some shady shit.

00:14:26.228 --> 00:14:27.075
- Well, for sure.

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:28.668
- [Ryan] When considering the conclusions

00:14:28.668 --> 00:14:31.084
of this committee, the acoustic evidence,

00:14:31.084 --> 00:14:33.293
the testimonies of Connolly and Tague,

00:14:33.293 --> 00:14:36.302
and the shaky premise of
the magic bullet theory,

00:14:36.302 --> 00:14:39.807
there is evidence to
suggest multiple shooters.

00:14:39.807 --> 00:14:41.492
It seems quite likely that there is

00:14:41.492 --> 00:14:43.819
more to this story than Lee Harvey Oswald

00:14:43.819 --> 00:14:46.652
killing the President
with no clear motive.

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:49.758
That being said, let's
break out the tinfoil hat

00:14:49.758 --> 00:14:53.025
and get into some conspiracy
theories, and trust me,

00:14:53.025 --> 00:14:55.402
you're gonna want to stick
around for the last one.

00:14:55.402 --> 00:14:58.744
The first theory is that Vice
President Lyndon B. Johnson

00:14:58.744 --> 00:15:02.058
had JFK assassinated for
political gain in power.

00:15:02.058 --> 00:15:04.878
Before Kennedy was
elected, LBJ had attempted

00:15:04.878 --> 00:15:07.436
to take the Democratic nomination from JFK

00:15:07.436 --> 00:15:10.958
at the 1960 Democratic
Convention in Los Angeles.

00:15:10.958 --> 00:15:13.322
According to the book
The Death of a President,

00:15:13.322 --> 00:15:15.730
LBJ asked the President to continue doing

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.197
part of his old job as Texas Senator,

00:15:18.197 --> 00:15:21.352
which basically meant LBJ
was bored and emasculated

00:15:21.352 --> 00:15:23.732
by the showy office of Vice President

00:15:23.732 --> 00:15:26.118
as opposed to the actual power he had held

00:15:26.118 --> 00:15:28.311
while being the Majority
Leader of the Senate.

00:15:28.311 --> 00:15:30.985
There were also rumors
that LBJ might be dropped

00:15:30.985 --> 00:15:33.558
from the reelection
ticket the following year.

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:36.981
LBJ and JFK also apparently had words

00:15:36.981 --> 00:15:39.064
the day before the assassination.

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:41.665
LBJ also played a big part in Kennedy

00:15:41.665 --> 00:15:44.080
going to Dallas in the first place.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.672
LBJ no longer had political
control of Texas, which was

00:15:47.672 --> 00:15:51.313
an important swing state
necessary for JFK's reelection.

00:15:51.313 --> 00:15:54.140
As a result, JFK
reluctantly went to Dallas

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.833
to try and solve the
Texas political crisis.

00:15:56.833 --> 00:15:59.919
Texas was LBJ's home turf, and JFK felt

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:02.606
LBJ should have had it handled.

00:16:02.606 --> 00:16:05.548
LBJ's right-hand man
had actually been warned

00:16:05.548 --> 00:16:09.025
by a high-profile Texas
lawyer named Byron Skelton

00:16:09.025 --> 00:16:12.308
that the political climate
in Dallas was not safe

00:16:12.308 --> 00:16:14.624
and that he feared for
the President's safety

00:16:14.624 --> 00:16:17.305
but the President was not informed,

00:16:17.305 --> 00:16:19.661
though this information was also received

00:16:19.661 --> 00:16:22.079
by other officials close to JFK,

00:16:22.079 --> 00:16:24.831
including JFK's brother Robert Kennedy.

00:16:24.831 --> 00:16:27.675
One incident that proponents
of this LBJ theory point to

00:16:27.675 --> 00:16:30.015
involves a woman named Madeleine Brown,

00:16:30.015 --> 00:16:32.942
who claimed to have an affair with LBJ.

00:16:32.942 --> 00:16:35.991
Brown claimed that she
attended a party with LBJ,

00:16:35.991 --> 00:16:38.520
Richard Nixon and J. Edgar Hoover

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.388
the night before JFK's assassination.

00:16:41.388 --> 00:16:44.788
She claimed that LBJ had
whispered into her ear, quote,

00:16:44.788 --> 00:16:46.906
"After tomorrow, those Kennedys

00:16:46.906 --> 00:16:48.899
"will never embarrass me again.

00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:50.231
"That's no threat.

00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:52.950
"That's a promise," end quote.

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:54.101
- [Shane] Jesus.

00:16:54.101 --> 00:16:55.609
(Ryan chuckles)

00:16:55.609 --> 00:16:57.930
That's compelling.

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.989
I guess that's a character
witness so you don't really know.

00:17:00.989 --> 00:17:03.921
I get the vibe that LBJ, he was President

00:17:03.921 --> 00:17:06.602
so obviously he's an intelligent man,

00:17:06.602 --> 00:17:09.627
but he also just seems
like kind of a idiot.

00:17:09.627 --> 00:17:10.946
(Ryan laughs)

00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:13.019
He was always walking
around with his pants off.

00:17:13.019 --> 00:17:14.139
- [Ryan] Yeah, that's true.

00:17:14.139 --> 00:17:16.791
- [Shane] He doesn't seem
like the mastermind type.

00:17:16.791 --> 00:17:19.042
- What stock do you
put into this admission

00:17:19.042 --> 00:17:20.994
from her or this claim by her?

00:17:20.994 --> 00:17:21.834
I'm curious.

00:17:21.834 --> 00:17:24.167
- If I'm LBJ and I've got my

00:17:26.144 --> 00:17:28.572
illicit arm-charm out for the evening

00:17:28.572 --> 00:17:32.071
with Tricky Dick next to me
and old J. Edgar Hooves--

00:17:32.071 --> 00:17:33.822
- (laughs) Tricky Dick.

00:17:33.822 --> 00:17:36.119
- I'm not gonna whisper into her ear,

00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:40.120
"Hey, the President's gonna die tomorrow."

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:42.578
- I can't get over you calling
Richard Nixon, Tricky Dick.

00:17:42.578 --> 00:17:43.438
- That's what everybody called him.

00:17:43.438 --> 00:17:44.347
- Is that what--

00:17:44.347 --> 00:17:45.180
- Oh, Tricky Dick!

00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:46.513
- Tricky Dick?
- Yeah.

00:17:46.513 --> 00:17:47.802
- Yeah, I will say the quote seems

00:17:47.802 --> 00:17:48.997
a little on the nose for me.

00:17:48.997 --> 00:17:49.830
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:51.954
- Why would someone say it so specifically

00:17:51.954 --> 00:17:53.130
when they're trying to pull off

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:54.827
one of the biggest coups in history?

00:17:54.827 --> 00:17:57.053
LBJ was on the Texas trip the night

00:17:57.053 --> 00:17:59.085
before the assassination, where his

00:17:59.085 --> 00:18:01.237
movements were heavily documented.

00:18:01.237 --> 00:18:03.696
Therefore, it's not
possible that this exchange

00:18:03.696 --> 00:18:05.981
with Madeleine Brown happened.

00:18:05.981 --> 00:18:07.907
Furthermore, while there is evidence

00:18:07.907 --> 00:18:11.902
that LBJ wasn't happiest as
VP, there is nothing to support

00:18:11.902 --> 00:18:14.558
the theory that he had JFK assassinated.

00:18:14.558 --> 00:18:16.776
He even helped form the Warren Commission.

00:18:16.776 --> 00:18:18.740
- [Shane] LBJ seemed
like a cool, cool guy.

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.235
- [Ryan] Well, you just said
he seems like a dumb ass.

00:18:20.235 --> 00:18:22.041
- [Shane] Yeah, he does,
but he's like a bro.

00:18:22.041 --> 00:18:24.246
- [Ryan] (laughs) You could
knock a cold one back with him?

00:18:24.246 --> 00:18:25.241
- Yeah.
- Play some pong?

00:18:25.241 --> 00:18:27.360
- [Shane] Just 'cause you're
a bit of a, you know--

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.838
- He was probably a
meathead back in the day.

00:18:28.838 --> 00:18:30.131
- A meathead, he's a meathead.

00:18:30.131 --> 00:18:31.465
- He's a meathead.
- He's a jock.

00:18:31.465 --> 00:18:32.450
- Yeah, he's a jock.

00:18:32.450 --> 00:18:34.542
Okay, I'm good with that.

00:18:34.542 --> 00:18:36.472
- I don't think any Vice President has

00:18:36.472 --> 00:18:38.164
accomplished anything throughout history.

00:18:38.164 --> 00:18:39.416
- In that respect, I don't think

00:18:39.416 --> 00:18:42.098
he had the moxie to pull off this.

00:18:42.098 --> 00:18:42.931
- No.

00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:44.749
- [Ryan] The second theory
is that the Russians

00:18:44.749 --> 00:18:47.473
were behind President
Kennedy's assassination.

00:18:47.473 --> 00:18:49.106
Obviously, there was tension between

00:18:49.106 --> 00:18:51.259
the two nations with the Cold War.

00:18:51.259 --> 00:18:53.201
Lee Harvey Oswald had tried to defect

00:18:53.201 --> 00:18:55.796
to the Soviet Union
before, and some theorize

00:18:55.796 --> 00:18:59.039
that he could have been
acting as a KGB agent.

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:02.224
Oswald was also inexplicably
at the Russian Embassy

00:19:02.224 --> 00:19:06.409
in Mexico City a few weeks
before the Kennedy assassination.

00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:08.812
Though, it's worth mentioning that Oswald

00:19:08.812 --> 00:19:11.604
would not be a smart option
for the Russians to use

00:19:11.604 --> 00:19:14.158
since he would immediately
cast suspicions on Russia

00:19:14.158 --> 00:19:16.197
due to his well-known Russian ties.

00:19:16.197 --> 00:19:17.990
- [Shane] Unless they're
doin' a double bluff.

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:18.941
- [Ryan] I wouldn't do that.

00:19:18.941 --> 00:19:20.470
- [Shane] Huh, huh, what about that?

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:22.136
- [Ryan] Well, I mean,
look at it logically.

00:19:22.136 --> 00:19:24.133
- [Shane] "Why would we hire Oswald?"

00:19:24.133 --> 00:19:25.856
- [Ryan] (laughs) "Why would we hire

00:19:25.856 --> 00:19:28.100
"Oswald when he clearly likes us?"

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:28.933
- [Shane] (laughs) Yeah.

00:19:28.933 --> 00:19:30.998
- From a logic perspective,
we're in this Cold War

00:19:30.998 --> 00:19:32.333
with them for about 10 years now.

00:19:32.333 --> 00:19:34.166
There's always the threat of nuclear war.

00:19:34.166 --> 00:19:37.666
Why the fuck would they even chance hiring

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.417
a person with Russian ties
to assassinate the President

00:19:41.417 --> 00:19:43.622
when they know the finger
would be pointed at them?

00:19:43.622 --> 00:19:45.943
And then if someone were to find out

00:19:45.943 --> 00:19:48.585
that Russia assassinated our
President, that's immediate--

00:19:48.585 --> 00:19:49.827
- War, baby, yeah.

00:19:49.827 --> 00:19:50.660
- Yeah, we all die.

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:51.493
- Yeah.

00:19:51.493 --> 00:19:53.642
- That's not Vladimir Putin fucking

00:19:53.642 --> 00:19:55.146
whispering sweet nothings
into Trump's ear.

00:19:55.146 --> 00:19:56.725
That's him blowing someone's head off.

00:19:56.725 --> 00:19:57.558
- [Shane] Right.

00:19:57.558 --> 00:19:58.537
- [Ryan] The third theory is

00:19:58.537 --> 00:20:00.745
that the mob assassinated Kennedy.

00:20:00.745 --> 00:20:02.879
Three different mob
groups separately claimed

00:20:02.879 --> 00:20:05.882
that they were responsible
for JFK's assassination:

00:20:05.882 --> 00:20:09.993
the Chicago mob, the Miami
mob, and the New Orleans mob.

00:20:09.993 --> 00:20:12.807
As Attorney General, Robert
Kennedy had made moves

00:20:12.807 --> 00:20:16.264
against organized crime
possibly, possibly angering them.

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:19.372
Jack Ruby, the man who
killed Lee Harvey Oswald,

00:20:19.372 --> 00:20:21.581
was a Dallas nightclub owner who some

00:20:21.581 --> 00:20:23.581
theorize had Mafia connections.

00:20:23.581 --> 00:20:26.165
Some even believe that the
mob was working in collusion

00:20:26.165 --> 00:20:29.071
with the CIA to carry out the Kennedy hit.

00:20:29.071 --> 00:20:32.487
In 2015, an imprisoned former Mafia hitman

00:20:32.487 --> 00:20:34.295
named James Files claimed to have been

00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:36.615
the second shooter in the assassination,

00:20:36.615 --> 00:20:39.161
saying he was part of
a plot in collaboration

00:20:39.161 --> 00:20:41.616
between the Mafia and the CIA.

00:20:41.616 --> 00:20:44.657
However, there's no
evidence supporting this.

00:20:44.657 --> 00:20:47.897
Perhaps the most compelling
aspect to the mob and CIA theory

00:20:47.897 --> 00:20:51.384
comes from JFK's supposed
ties to Sam Giancana,

00:20:51.384 --> 00:20:54.097
the head of the Chicago
Syndicate at the time.

00:20:54.097 --> 00:20:56.761
JFK's father, Joseph Kennedy, supposedly

00:20:56.761 --> 00:20:59.100
worked with Sam Giancana
in the bootlegging

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.260
industry during the Prohibition.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.478
There have also been rumors
that Giancana and the mob helped

00:21:04.478 --> 00:21:07.777
JFK win the 1960 election
in the first place.

00:21:07.777 --> 00:21:10.841
JFK and Giancana also
reportedly shared a mistress

00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:14.224
at different times, named
Judith Campbell Exner.

00:21:14.224 --> 00:21:17.756
In fact, in 1975, Giancana was supposed

00:21:17.756 --> 00:21:19.538
to testify to a Senate committee

00:21:19.538 --> 00:21:22.579
about his role in a CIA assassination plot

00:21:22.579 --> 00:21:25.939
when he himself was assassinated.

00:21:25.939 --> 00:21:29.608
It makes you wonder if someone
was trying to keep him quiet.

00:21:29.608 --> 00:21:30.749
But why even claim it then?

00:21:30.749 --> 00:21:31.622
- [Shane] Eh.

00:21:31.622 --> 00:21:32.505
- [Ryan] Why would he even make that up?

00:21:32.505 --> 00:21:34.166
Do you think maybe he was
just trying to up his cred,

00:21:34.166 --> 00:21:36.716
like in prison, like,
"Yeah, I whacked Kennedy."

00:21:36.716 --> 00:21:37.785
- [Shane] Yeah, this happens a lot,

00:21:37.785 --> 00:21:39.403
people always just claiming--

00:21:39.403 --> 00:21:40.432
- [Ryan] Yeah, but I feel like

00:21:40.432 --> 00:21:41.397
if you're gonna claim something,

00:21:41.397 --> 00:21:43.450
maybe claim you killed some dude

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:44.898
carrying groceries down the alleyway.

00:21:44.898 --> 00:21:46.502
Don't just claim I killed JFK.

00:21:46.502 --> 00:21:47.460
- [Shane] (laughs) Right?

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:49.280
- [Ryan] I feel like nothing
good could come of that.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.919
- [Shane] Everyone just kinda
rolls their eyes at him.

00:21:50.919 --> 00:21:51.987
- [Ryan] "How could I make my prison

00:21:51.987 --> 00:21:53.920
"sentence a life sentence, huh?

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.881
- [Shane] "I killed God."

00:21:54.881 --> 00:21:55.778
(Ryan laughs)

00:21:55.778 --> 00:21:58.442
- [Ryan] Speaking of the
CIA, let's move to our fourth

00:21:58.442 --> 00:22:01.431
and final theory, that
the CIA was ultimately

00:22:01.431 --> 00:22:04.012
behind the assassination of JFK.

00:22:04.012 --> 00:22:06.802
Allen Dulles, the former head of the CIA,

00:22:06.802 --> 00:22:09.140
was actually on the Warren Commission,

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.426
and, as mentioned before, the CIA

00:22:11.426 --> 00:22:14.260
withheld information from that commission.

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:16.460
The CIA now refers to this as a,

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.270
quote, "Benign coverup," end quote.

00:22:19.270 --> 00:22:21.085
There are plenty of
wild theories out there

00:22:21.085 --> 00:22:24.100
for possible motives for the
CIA assassinating Kennedy.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:26.845
Some feel that JFK may
have found out that the CIA

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:29.339
had a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro,

00:22:29.339 --> 00:22:31.332
and the CIA felt threatened that Kennedy

00:22:31.332 --> 00:22:34.179
might have a different
agenda or even disband them,

00:22:34.179 --> 00:22:35.928
so they plotted to assassinate him.

00:22:35.928 --> 00:22:37.446
Yeah, possible, I'm not gonna say

00:22:37.446 --> 00:22:38.735
this one's out of the
realm of possibility.

00:22:38.735 --> 00:22:39.568
- [Shane] There were a bunch of

00:22:39.568 --> 00:22:40.872
attempts on Castro's life, right?

00:22:40.872 --> 00:22:41.705
- [Ryan] Oh yeah.

00:22:41.705 --> 00:22:42.538
- [Shane] Exploding cigar?

00:22:42.538 --> 00:22:43.746
- [Ryan] There was also
the Bay of Pigs invasion.

00:22:43.746 --> 00:22:45.699
- [Shane] Yeah, not great.

00:22:45.699 --> 00:22:46.602
- [Ryan] We all know how that went.

00:22:46.602 --> 00:22:49.722
Forensic historian Patrick
Nolan wrote a book entitled

00:22:49.722 --> 00:22:52.556
CIA Rogues and the
Killing of the Kennedys,

00:22:52.556 --> 00:22:55.559
in which he theorizes that
four high-level agents

00:22:55.559 --> 00:22:57.317
not only planned the shooting,

00:22:57.317 --> 00:23:01.245
but three of them fired four
shots during the assassination.

00:23:01.245 --> 00:23:03.613
People also feel that the CIA could have

00:23:03.613 --> 00:23:05.796
picked Oswald to carry out the hit,

00:23:05.796 --> 00:23:08.814
as he was a known communist
and Russian sympathizer.

00:23:08.814 --> 00:23:11.165
Another possible CIA motive was that,

00:23:11.165 --> 00:23:13.909
after the failed Bay of
Pigs invasion into Cuba,

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:16.460
the CIA underwent personnel changes

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:19.355
at the hand of Kennedy,
which may have upset them.

00:23:19.355 --> 00:23:21.297
Blaming something on
the CIA is essentially

00:23:21.297 --> 00:23:22.525
pointing a finger at a shadow.

00:23:22.525 --> 00:23:24.281
There's nothing we know about them,

00:23:24.281 --> 00:23:25.673
and there's nothing we
ever will know about them.

00:23:25.673 --> 00:23:27.386
- [Shane] We won't.

00:23:27.386 --> 00:23:29.385
I think maybe that's
why I'm so comfortable

00:23:29.385 --> 00:23:32.502
with just never knowing
on this and hanging it up

00:23:32.502 --> 00:23:33.897
because there's just unknowables.

00:23:33.897 --> 00:23:35.836
There's people who are good
at covering their tracks.

00:23:35.836 --> 00:23:40.554
The CIA is very, very good at
operating in total secrecy.

00:23:40.554 --> 00:23:42.606
- [Ryan] Yeah, the CIA
doesn't even leave tracks.

00:23:42.606 --> 00:23:43.931
They're the boogeyman of the world.

00:23:43.931 --> 00:23:45.872
- They probably control more of our

00:23:45.872 --> 00:23:47.930
daily life than we'd ever know.

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.704
They're pulling strings,
it's all I'm saying.

00:23:49.704 --> 00:23:51.353
- It's pointless to point the finger

00:23:51.353 --> 00:23:53.139
at them is what I'm saying.

00:23:53.139 --> 00:23:54.574
You could say it's anybody at that

00:23:54.574 --> 00:23:55.459
point 'cause it doesn't matter.

00:23:55.459 --> 00:23:56.916
You're making a baseless conclusion.

00:23:56.916 --> 00:23:59.302
You could say it's fucking
Limecat or something.

00:23:59.302 --> 00:24:00.146
- Limecat?

00:24:00.146 --> 00:24:01.413
- You know, the cat that has a lime cut

00:24:01.413 --> 00:24:03.041
in half and he wears it as a helmet.

00:24:03.041 --> 00:24:04.660
He's the person who pulled
the trigger, or she.

00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.493
I don't know if Limecat's--

00:24:05.493 --> 00:24:06.476
- An internet photo?

00:24:06.476 --> 00:24:07.859
- Yeah, yeah, Limecat killed JFK.

00:24:07.859 --> 00:24:08.760
That's what I'm saying.

00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.027
- Do people call that Limecat?

00:24:10.027 --> 00:24:10.977
- [Ryan] Yeah, it's Limecat.

00:24:10.977 --> 00:24:12.048
- Isn't it a cantaloupe or something--

00:24:12.048 --> 00:24:13.112
- [Ryan] No, it's a lime.

00:24:13.112 --> 00:24:13.945
- It's a lime?

00:24:13.945 --> 00:24:14.779
- Oh, I don't know, is it Limecat?

00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:16.201
I'm pretty sure it's Limecat.

00:24:16.201 --> 00:24:19.693
- I've never heard someone
refer to this cat so casually.

00:24:19.693 --> 00:24:21.855
- [Ryan] Also during that
Bay of Pigs invasion,

00:24:21.855 --> 00:24:25.175
Kennedy refused to offer
additional US military support

00:24:25.175 --> 00:24:29.192
despite the CIA offering an
umbrella of air protection.

00:24:29.192 --> 00:24:31.584
The explicit use of the word umbrella

00:24:31.584 --> 00:24:35.152
unlocks one controversial
wrinkle to this CIA theory.

00:24:35.152 --> 00:24:38.325
This wrinkle, which is
popular in conspiracy circles,

00:24:38.325 --> 00:24:40.034
is that Lee Harvey Oswald acted

00:24:40.034 --> 00:24:41.849
with a potential CIA operative,

00:24:41.849 --> 00:24:44.499
referred to as the Umbrella Man.

00:24:44.499 --> 00:24:47.443
- [Shane] Whoa, I love names like that!

00:24:47.443 --> 00:24:48.787
- [Ryan] Oh, it's not just a name.

00:24:48.787 --> 00:24:49.858
It is very practical.

00:24:49.858 --> 00:24:50.691
- [Shane] The Umbrella Man.

00:24:50.691 --> 00:24:52.712
- [Ryan] There's no creative
input into this name.

00:24:52.712 --> 00:24:53.678
It's all practical.

00:24:53.678 --> 00:24:55.754
- [Shane] I fucking love that!

00:24:55.754 --> 00:24:56.587
- [Ryan] Oh man, I can't wait--

00:24:56.587 --> 00:24:57.487
- [Shane] The Umbrella Man?

00:24:57.487 --> 00:24:58.366
- [Ryan] Oh, I love it, too.

00:24:58.366 --> 00:24:59.257
I can't wait to tell you--

00:24:59.257 --> 00:25:02.159
- [Shane] Oh, baby, the Umbrella Man!

00:25:02.159 --> 00:25:03.576
- [Ryan] Don't call me baby, but yeah.

00:25:03.576 --> 00:25:05.480
In the Zapruder film and other photos

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:07.500
taken at the time of the
shooting, you can see

00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.249
one lone man holding an open
umbrella above his head.

00:25:11.249 --> 00:25:14.140
At a glance, this may
seem fairly innocuous,

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:16.689
but there are two things
that make it unusual.

00:25:16.689 --> 00:25:18.877
The first is that it wasn't raining,

00:25:18.877 --> 00:25:21.431
and despite it raining in
Dallas the night before,

00:25:21.431 --> 00:25:23.364
nobody in the crowd, as far as pictures

00:25:23.364 --> 00:25:25.811
and media can tell, had an umbrella.

00:25:25.811 --> 00:25:28.793
The second and more dubious
occurrence is the fact

00:25:28.793 --> 00:25:30.937
that Kennedy is struck by the first bullet

00:25:30.937 --> 00:25:34.692
at the moment his car passes
in front of this umbrella man.

00:25:34.692 --> 00:25:37.744
Also in that moment, some
believe that the Umbrella Man

00:25:37.744 --> 00:25:40.341
appears to lift his umbrella a foot or so.

00:25:40.341 --> 00:25:41.930
Both of these things in conjunction

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:43.649
have led some to believe that the umbrella

00:25:43.649 --> 00:25:45.503
was a signal to another gunman,

00:25:45.503 --> 00:25:49.067
or that the umbrella itself
was a spy-like weapon

00:25:49.067 --> 00:25:51.604
that could fire darts, perhaps explaining

00:25:51.604 --> 00:25:54.075
the slight hole in JFK's neck.

00:25:54.075 --> 00:25:55.833
- [Shane] He's like Oswald Cobblepot?

00:25:55.833 --> 00:25:58.028
- [Ryan] Yeah, he's like James Bond

00:25:58.028 --> 00:25:59.243
and this is a new weapon that M--

00:25:59.243 --> 00:26:01.087
- [Shane] No, he's like the Penguin.

00:26:01.087 --> 00:26:01.920
- [Ryan] Or the Penguin.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.966
- [Shane] The Penguin
had a gun, a gun-brella.

00:26:03.966 --> 00:26:04.799
(Ryan laughs)

00:26:04.799 --> 00:26:06.227
I do want to ask, though.

00:26:06.227 --> 00:26:08.334
The term, umbrella, in the previous

00:26:08.334 --> 00:26:10.947
quote is what links that, why?

00:26:10.947 --> 00:26:13.238
Is that just an innocuous link there?

00:26:13.238 --> 00:26:15.822
Was that a segue from
you, or are people like,

00:26:15.822 --> 00:26:16.872
"That proves that this is a--"

00:26:16.872 --> 00:26:18.156
- [Ryan] It's a segue and it's

00:26:18.156 --> 00:26:20.628
somewhat proof in conspiracy circles.

00:26:20.628 --> 00:26:22.159
- [Shane] Okay, well, that's a grasp.

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:23.858
- [Ryan] If the CIA said they were gonna

00:26:23.858 --> 00:26:26.218
offer an umbrella of air protection

00:26:26.218 --> 00:26:28.816
and Kennedy said, "Nah, you ain't."

00:26:28.816 --> 00:26:30.459
- [Shane] Mm-hm, okay, well, that--

00:26:30.459 --> 00:26:31.292
- [Ryan] And then--

00:26:31.292 --> 00:26:32.362
- [Shane] So that's very tenuous.

00:26:32.362 --> 00:26:33.262
- [Ryan] And then they're like,

00:26:33.262 --> 00:26:34.986
"All right, we're gonna kill
you with an umbrella, then."

00:26:34.986 --> 00:26:35.819
- [Shane] Uh-huh.

00:26:35.819 --> 00:26:36.940
(Ryan laughs)

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:38.821
- [Ryan] As outlandish as this may seem,

00:26:38.821 --> 00:26:40.799
a Department of Defense weapons developer

00:26:40.799 --> 00:26:43.402
named Charles Senseney
incredibly testified

00:26:43.402 --> 00:26:45.272
to the Senate Intelligence Committee

00:26:45.272 --> 00:26:47.511
that a form of this wacky umbrella weapon

00:26:47.511 --> 00:26:50.297
exists because he designed it.

00:26:50.297 --> 00:26:52.678
Senseney described an umbrella-like weapon

00:26:52.678 --> 00:26:54.981
that could silently fire darts.

00:26:54.981 --> 00:26:57.320
One JFK book author named Jim Marrs

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.286
also claimed that these darts were fired

00:26:59.286 --> 00:27:01.485
through the umbrellas webbing when opened.

00:27:01.485 --> 00:27:03.445
Furthermore, there are pictures that show

00:27:03.445 --> 00:27:06.730
the umbrella closed before
and after the assassination.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:09.976
But during the assassination,
the umbrella was clearly open

00:27:09.976 --> 00:27:12.342
as Kennedy passed the Umbrella Man.

00:27:12.342 --> 00:27:15.028
- [Shane] The Umbrella Man strikes.

00:27:15.028 --> 00:27:16.322
Yeah, I don't think you have to

00:27:16.322 --> 00:27:18.043
sell me any more on this, Ryan.

00:27:18.043 --> 00:27:21.549
I was all-in once you mentioned
the words, Umbrella Man.

00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:22.784
- [Ryan] What do you
think about the umbrella

00:27:22.784 --> 00:27:24.864
only being able to fire
through the webbing of the--

00:27:24.864 --> 00:27:26.057
- [Shane] Great, I'm on board.

00:27:26.057 --> 00:27:27.383
- [Ryan] That's pretty
fucking cool, right?

00:27:27.383 --> 00:27:30.051
- [Shane] Look, you could
convince me any of anything

00:27:30.051 --> 00:27:32.442
in the world if you just
use the words, Umbrella Man.

00:27:32.442 --> 00:27:34.942
If you say, "Amelia Earhart,
her plane was attacked

00:27:34.942 --> 00:27:36.965
"by an Umbrella Man and
he took her to space,"

00:27:36.965 --> 00:27:38.640
I'd say, "That sounds about right."

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.274
- [Ryan] Also suspicious is the fact

00:27:40.274 --> 00:27:42.846
that, after the shooting,
while other spectators

00:27:42.846 --> 00:27:45.190
fled the scene, this Umbrella Man,

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.878
along with another man,
sat down next to each other

00:27:47.878 --> 00:27:50.893
on the curb, seemingly undisturbed.

00:27:50.893 --> 00:27:53.361
However, a possible explanation came

00:27:53.361 --> 00:27:55.930
from the purported Umbrella Man himself.

00:27:55.930 --> 00:27:58.844
This man was a man
named Louie Steven Witt,

00:27:58.844 --> 00:28:01.592
who came forward to the
Senate committee to testify,

00:28:01.592 --> 00:28:04.146
even bringing the umbrella along with him.

00:28:04.146 --> 00:28:06.660
He claimed that the umbrella
was a symbol of protest

00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:08.826
to JFK's father Joseph Kennedy.

00:28:08.826 --> 00:28:10.826
Witt was not a fan of Joseph Kennedy's

00:28:10.826 --> 00:28:13.255
appeasement policies when
Joseph was ambassador

00:28:13.255 --> 00:28:16.888
to the Court of St. James in 1938 to 1939.

00:28:16.888 --> 00:28:21.043
So, as a symbol of protest,
Witt used an umbrella,

00:28:21.043 --> 00:28:22.879
a reference to the signature accessory

00:28:22.879 --> 00:28:24.812
of Neville Chamberlain, who promoted

00:28:24.812 --> 00:28:27.709
appeasement as Prime Minister of England.

00:28:27.709 --> 00:28:30.679
Witt also explains that he
only opened the umbrella

00:28:30.679 --> 00:28:32.996
when he believed Kennedy could see it.

00:28:32.996 --> 00:28:35.899
And as odd as this may
seem, throughout history,

00:28:35.899 --> 00:28:38.576
many people, both in England and America,

00:28:38.576 --> 00:28:41.601
have used umbrellas as
a symbol of protest.

00:28:41.601 --> 00:28:44.062
Even the paranoid former President Nixon

00:28:44.062 --> 00:28:46.033
banned his aides from having umbrellas

00:28:46.033 --> 00:28:48.281
when he was Vice President to Eisenhower

00:28:48.281 --> 00:28:50.027
for fear of having a visual link

00:28:50.027 --> 00:28:53.016
to the unpopular policy of appeasement.

00:28:53.016 --> 00:28:55.348
- [Shane] I'm fed up with this guy.

00:28:55.348 --> 00:28:57.187
Also, oh, he shows up to court

00:28:57.187 --> 00:28:59.120
and says, "No, this is the umbrella.

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.007
(Ryan laughs)

00:29:00.007 --> 00:29:02.233
"I couldn't possibly have two umbrellas."

00:29:02.233 --> 00:29:04.434
- [Ryan] By the way, no
follow up from this testimony,

00:29:04.434 --> 00:29:07.563
none of them searching
his house, nobody's saying

00:29:07.563 --> 00:29:09.205
and confirming that this
is the Umbrella Man.

00:29:09.205 --> 00:29:11.970
It's just a guy saying
this flimsy little excuse

00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.389
about some history
lesson that he probably,

00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:16.585
I guess he couldn't Googled it,

00:29:16.585 --> 00:29:20.381
but he he could have went to
the local history professor.

00:29:20.381 --> 00:29:22.187
- [Shane] Absolutely shameful.

00:29:22.187 --> 00:29:23.020
- [Ryan] I don't know.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.066
I find it very weak.

00:29:25.066 --> 00:29:27.276
The supposed Umbrella Man, Witt,

00:29:27.276 --> 00:29:29.291
also claimed that the umbrella blocked

00:29:29.291 --> 00:29:31.949
his view of Kennedy being assassinated,

00:29:31.949 --> 00:29:34.569
thus explaining his
apparent state of calm,

00:29:34.569 --> 00:29:36.769
or shock, as he described it, as he sat

00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:39.026
on the curb after the shooting.

00:29:39.026 --> 00:29:42.618
but some have claimed this
isn't proven in the footage

00:29:42.618 --> 00:29:46.091
Perhaps Louis Stephen Witt
is in fact the umbrella man

00:29:46.091 --> 00:29:48.337
and this is all a misunderstanding

00:29:48.337 --> 00:29:52.504
or perhaps Witt is a puppet for
the CIA to cover its tracks.

00:29:53.341 --> 00:29:56.280
Nobody can say definitively which is true.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.839
- [Shane] Fucking Umbrella Man.

00:29:57.839 --> 00:30:01.967
- [Ryan] Like I just can't
believe that that's his excuse

00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:04.045
I couldn't see it I didn't
see it I heard the gunshots

00:30:04.045 --> 00:30:05.379
I saw everyone running and I thought

00:30:05.379 --> 00:30:07.457
oh it must be part of the parade

00:30:07.457 --> 00:30:09.233
- [Shane] It was a very
parade I didn't see

00:30:09.233 --> 00:30:12.811
the part where the president
got shot in the head.

00:30:12.811 --> 00:30:15.077
- [Ryan] In the end people
continue to speculate

00:30:15.077 --> 00:30:17.274
on what truly have been in Dallas that day

00:30:17.274 --> 00:30:19.761
A 2003 ABC News poll conducted

00:30:19.761 --> 00:30:22.441
years after JFK's assassinations

00:30:22.441 --> 00:30:25.447
found that approximately
% of Americans believed

00:30:25.447 --> 00:30:28.245
there was some sort of
plot behind the killings

00:30:28.245 --> 00:30:31.917
Only 32% accepted the
Warren Commission's findings

00:30:31.917 --> 00:30:36.143
And 51% believe there was
a second gunman involved

00:30:36.143 --> 00:30:41.081
In 1973 LBJ told the Atlantic
quote, "I never believed

00:30:41.081 --> 00:30:44.344
"that Oswald acted alone,
although I can accept

00:30:44.344 --> 00:30:47.571
"that he pulled the trigger," end quote

00:30:47.571 --> 00:30:51.204
I just can't believe
that one single douchebag

00:30:51.204 --> 00:30:52.541
could assassinate a president

00:30:52.541 --> 00:30:54.462
- Yeah he's not a very
good villain, right?

00:30:54.462 --> 00:30:55.702
- No.

00:30:55.702 --> 00:30:58.130
He doesn't even have a scary outfit.

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:00.255
- No he's got like a nice smart sweater

00:31:00.255 --> 00:31:02.755
and he's got like trendy hair.

00:31:03.887 --> 00:31:05.000
It's, like, perfectly greasy.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.451
- Side note what do you think

00:31:06.451 --> 00:31:08.409
Lee Harvey Oswald used his hair?

00:31:08.409 --> 00:31:09.470
I gotta get some of that.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:10.461
- Some good pomade.

00:31:10.461 --> 00:31:13.410
- Some gentleman's pomade right there.

00:31:13.410 --> 00:31:14.722
- Well I guess we'll never know

00:31:14.722 --> 00:31:17.427
what happened in Dallas that day.

00:31:17.427 --> 00:31:19.451
- Limecat.
- Limecat.

00:31:19.451 --> 00:31:21.079
- [Ryan] Limecat.

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:23.909
Did Lee Harvey Oswald act alone?

00:31:23.909 --> 00:31:25.434
Was there other gunmen?

00:31:25.434 --> 00:31:27.565
Perhaps the mysterious umbrella man?

00:31:27.565 --> 00:31:30.062
And if there were, who
were they working for?

00:31:30.062 --> 00:31:31.349
The horrific assassination

00:31:31.349 --> 00:31:34.599
of John F Kennedy will remain unsolved.
