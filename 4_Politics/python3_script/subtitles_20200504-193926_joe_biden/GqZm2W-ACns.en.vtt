Hi, I'm Heidi Rader here in the Alaska
Garden.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.620
I'm with UAF Cooperative Extension Service and Tanana Chiefs Conference.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.960
I'm here in Homer, Alaska checking out all the cool things farmers are doing here to extend the season like

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:32.420
high tunnels, hoop houses, low tunnels and also the other cool tools they're using as small-scale farmers.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.740
I'm here with Emily Garrity at Twitter Creek Gardens and we're gonna check

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.620
out her passive solar greenhouse. So, how do you maximize

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.260
the sun and heat retention with this
greenhouse?

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.680
So the design of the passive solar is you want your glazing at an angle perpendicular to the shoulder

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.640
season sun, so basically spring and fall
equinox.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.600
Okay. And what do you use the greenhouse for?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.160
So, we use it for various
things at different seasons. In the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.939
spring, we do all of our soil blocking
and seed starting and then in the summer

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.380
we'll put a summer crop and in the fall
we'll plant a winter crop and that's

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.819
primarily for home consumption, but we
can grow spinach and kale and hearty

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.659
greens in there in the fall and then
harvest them through the winter and then

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.600
do the whole cycle again, come spring.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.180
Wow. That's great. Let's go inside and check it out.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.460
So you've got your passive solar greenhouse kind of dug into the ground a little bit.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:47.000
What aspects of the greenhouse help maximize the sun and heat retention.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.459
So, the glazing angle like
we talked about before really maximizes

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:55.959
the sun and the heat retention qualities
of the greenhouse are both the concrete

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:01.149
walls - the north side being completely
dug into the ground so the whole north

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.499
wall is covered in soil on the outside.
And the east, west and south pony walls

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:10.000
are at 4-foot and they're all concrete
as well. And then our raised beds full of

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.440
soil have the heat retention quality.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.820
Okay. Because that kind of gets the plants off the floor a little bit more.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.840
It gets the plants off of the floor. Yup, exactly.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.650
So down at the four-foot level it tends
to be a little cooler so we built the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.960
raised beds on platforms which kind of
doubled as a heat retention technique. So it worked out well.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.000
And then you even have a second layer of plants up there.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.530
We do. We use that just in the
spring for our transplants or our seed

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.550
starting. And then all of those go out
into the field and we remove the

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.560
shelving and then we're just growing our
summer crop in here.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.040
Okay then that keeps them nice and warm up there, I bet.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.640
Yup. Full sun and
nice and warm.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.260
So, I see you have a wood stove here. Do you ever have to use this much?

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.540
Not very often, but it's really nice to have as kind of an insurance policy. So if we have a

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.840
series of cloudy days or it's really
cold and we have starts out here, then we

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.460
can fire up the wood stove and it keeps
the space warm, so we don't lose our tender starts.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.800
Great. So what do you grow in here mostly like say in the spring?

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.880
So in the spring we do all of our soil
blocking and our seed starting to grow

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.500
transplants to go out into the field. And
then once those are out in the field in

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.130
the summer we put a crop of various
warmer-loving things like hot peppers or

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.070
we grow in here - cucumbers - we've grown basil in here. Sometimes lettuce.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.540
So, kind of a variety of summer crops.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.480
Great. And then are you able to grow into the fall and winter at all?

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.540
We are. So, once our summer crop comes out we're able to

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:53.000
plant the raised beds with hearty greens
or kale and we try to get them up to a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.280
harvestable size before the sun gets too
dim in the wintertime and then we can

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.549
harvest through the winter those hearty
greens and if we get them in here a

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.720
little too late then in the spring as
soon as we're getting into February

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.680
March and a little bit more light, then
they tend to have a growth spurt and we

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.680
can harvest them really early in the
spring to eat.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.460
Nice. Well, it sounds like a really sustainable solution for Alaska.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.840
It is. Yeah, it's really helpful and works

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.810
really well for our farm as a
propagation house and kind of an extra

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.320
warm climate to grow some of those
diverse vegetables.

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.620
Great. Well, thanks Emily. This has been really interesting.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.140
Yeah, You're welcome. Thanks for having me.
