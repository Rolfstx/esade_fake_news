00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:01.896
And it was a Sunday morning

00:00:02.104 --> 00:00:03.104
I was in bed

00:00:03.657 --> 00:00:05.676
still asleep, it was
early in the morning

00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:07.098
maybe like 9 or 10 o'clock.

00:00:11.187 --> 00:00:12.437
and the phone rings

00:00:13.072 --> 00:00:15.194
and it's my baby brother
using my mom's phone

00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:16.909
his name is Isaac, he's 9 years old

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:19.030
so I answer the phone like, hello?

00:00:19.605 --> 00:00:21.327
"Hello, Trevor?"

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.577
I said, hey Isaac what do you want?

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.290
"How are you?"

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.240
I am fine thanks.

00:00:28.693 --> 00:00:30.265
"I am also fine, thank you."

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.658
I am fine thanks and how are you Isaac?

00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:34.231
"I am fine thanks and how are you?

00:00:35.036 --> 00:00:35.978
I am fine thank you.

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:37.034
"It's a pleasure."

00:00:38.886 --> 00:00:41.625
"Oh, and Trevor are you busy?"

00:00:42.565 --> 00:00:44.391
yes sort of, why?

00:00:44.756 --> 00:00:46.704
"No, because mom's been shot."

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:48.857
I am sorry, what?

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:51.422
"Yeah, mom has been shot and we are
at the hospital. Can you come?"

00:00:52.147 --> 00:00:54.054
Mom's been shot, okay,
what do you mean?

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.815
Okay of course I can
come, which hospital?

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.366
and he tells me the hospital.

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:58.391
can you come?

00:00:58.818 --> 00:01:01.122
Like he is to polite for his own good

00:01:01.541 --> 00:01:02.767
can you come?

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:05.723
Like I am going to have to
slot mom into my schedule

00:01:05.748 --> 00:01:08.130
"Oh, coffee at two and then, eish!

00:01:08.406 --> 00:01:10.879
PlayStation at one,
okay mom we will try...

00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:11.899
Come on, can I come?

00:01:11.924 --> 00:01:13.486
of course I can come, I am panicking.

00:01:13.584 --> 00:01:15.647
I jump out of bed, I am running around

00:01:15.672 --> 00:01:17.331
I am trying to put my clothes on, some things are backwards

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:19.156
I don’t even notice, I don’t even care

00:01:19.188 --> 00:01:21.321
I grab the car keys but I
am looking for the car keys

00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:23.187
I am busy running around
there, losing my mind

00:01:23.212 --> 00:01:25.085
I jump into the car, into the streets

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.286
as soon as I am out the gate,
the tears start coming out

00:01:27.386 --> 00:01:29.382
You cant even control it, you are
just driving and all of the sudden

00:01:29.478 --> 00:01:36.376
(Crying)

00:01:36.514 --> 00:01:37.901
I am driving, I am trying to hold it back

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:40.427
but then I get to the
traffic light and the robot is red

00:01:40.452 --> 00:01:42.056
and I let it out, it just comes out

00:01:42.112 --> 00:01:47.871
(crying)

00:01:47.905 --> 00:01:49.110
NO don’t wash my window!

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:51.279
No, no, don’t, don’t!

00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:56.457
Hey, no, no, hey, no, no!

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:58.795
Hey, no.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.125
(crying)

00:02:03.132 --> 00:02:05.945
there I am, driving to the
hospital like a mad man

00:02:05.945 --> 00:02:07.502
I get there, jump out the car

00:02:07.527 --> 00:02:09.803
my brother is standing there
at the emergency section

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.456
I see him outside, he is just standing
like nothing happened, looking around

00:02:12.684 --> 00:02:13.983
I am like, Isaac what happened?

00:02:14.008 --> 00:02:15.827
He's like, "Mom got shot, she's inside"

00:02:16.029 --> 00:02:17.194
I am like, are you okay?

00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:18.694
He's like, "mom was shot, not me."

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.118
No, that's not what I am saying you idiot

00:02:21.143 --> 00:02:22.120
whatever, I am coming back

00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:23.200
So I run inside

00:02:23.325 --> 00:02:26.114
My mom is in the prep area, all the
doctors are standing around her

00:02:26.183 --> 00:02:27.822
there is blood everywhere,
I am looking at the doctors

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:28.715
and just by the way

00:02:28.813 --> 00:02:31.159
doctors are not as good looking
as they are on those T.V shows

00:02:31.737 --> 00:02:33.337
No, like they set the bar really high

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:34.942
I was shocked because
I ran in and was like what the hell

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:37.373
(Confused)

00:02:37.572 --> 00:02:39.806
Sorry, that was inappropriate,
what's happening here guys?

00:02:39.831 --> 00:02:40.586
"Sir, you need to leave"

00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:42.649
I said I was sorry, what's happening?

00:02:42.744 --> 00:02:44.008
No sir, you cant be
here please leave.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.613
I am like whatever, okay.

00:02:45.638 --> 00:02:47.654
So I go outside, the nurse
come to me and she is like

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:48.679
"Mr. Noah?"
I said yes.

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:51.426
"Okay Mr. Noah, we have your
wife stabilized right now and"

00:02:51.517 --> 00:02:52.619
I said, my wife?

00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:54.231
She said yes, that's Mrs. Noah right?

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:55.638
Yes, that's my mom.

00:02:55.706 --> 00:02:56.956
Oh, I am sorry thought she was

00:02:56.981 --> 00:02:59.259
Come on, why would you think she is my wife?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.834
You think I would, she
is cool but I mean

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.250
like have you seen the girls

00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:04.877
oh, I will show you the pictures
afterward. What's going on?

00:03:05.014 --> 00:03:06.436
She's like, "Okay Mr. Noah

00:03:06.512 --> 00:03:09.884
your mom has just been stabilized and we are
gonna have to start thinking about surgery

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.956
She has been shot in the head and she
has been shot in the lower buttox region

00:03:12.981 --> 00:03:14.904
so this is a very serious thing.

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:16.587
I am like, yes it is
so what's happening?

00:03:16.716 --> 00:03:18.932
"Well, we just found out that
she doesn’t have medical aid.

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:19.865
I said, what?

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.992
She goes, yeah she
doesn’t have medical aid.

00:03:21.432 --> 00:03:23.270
Now my mom always had
medical aid, always

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.312
but now it turns out she canceled it a few years ago

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:26.876
I didn’t know this, she canceled it

00:03:26.901 --> 00:03:27.901
because she never gets sick.

00:03:28.283 --> 00:03:29.182
you know those people?

00:03:29.284 --> 00:03:30.906
I never get sick, I
never get sick Trevor

00:03:30.931 --> 00:03:33.336
I never get sick, I don’t know why
I have this. I never get sick

00:03:33.356 --> 00:03:35.711
Yes, but you didn’t think of bullets.

00:03:41.046 --> 00:03:43.219
Now she is in the hospital, no medical aid

00:03:43.244 --> 00:03:44.660
So I said to the nurse, what does this mean?

00:03:44.721 --> 00:03:47.319
She says well it means we are going to
have to put her back in the ambulance

00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:48.999
and send her to a public hospital.

00:03:49.506 --> 00:03:51.436
I said, but she is bleeding
now, you cant send her

00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.666
She said, " I am sorry sir but that is all
we can do, she has to go to public hospital"

00:03:53.946 --> 00:03:55.892
Now I am panicking, a public hospital?

00:03:56.314 --> 00:03:58.561
Normally a good place to go, normally

00:03:58.856 --> 00:04:02.630
but now what's happening is
just mis-administation of funds

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.660
money is going missing, you
don’t know what's happening

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.220
they don’t have the right equipment

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.220
now I am picturing guys
trying to fix my mom

00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:09.875
There's the doctor, "give me a scalpel"

00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:11.107
"We got a spanner"

00:04:12.263 --> 00:04:14.117
"Yeah, bring it. At least it's a shifting

00:04:14.142 --> 00:04:15.659
okay, lets try something."

00:04:16.038 --> 00:04:17.216
I am stressed.

00:04:18.302 --> 00:04:20.324
so I said, well what do we
do without medical aid?

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:21.492
She says, "well, nothing sir."

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:22.699
I said well what if I
give you the money?

00:04:22.782 --> 00:04:24.415
She says, "well, you don’t know
how much it will cost sir

00:04:24.434 --> 00:04:26.775
you cant unless you give us your card
and then we just work from there

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.156
I said well take my card,
here's my credit card.

00:04:28.181 --> 00:04:30.008
She goes, "Sir, it can
get very expensive"

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:31.177
I said, this is my mom

00:04:31.222 --> 00:04:33.155
this is my mom, you use the money.
Go!

00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:35.323
She goes, don’t tell me it's expensive

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.047
this is my mother we are
talking about, you know?

00:04:37.591 --> 00:04:39.827
I realized through this I
have neglected my brother

00:04:39.859 --> 00:04:41.884
he's been standing there the
whole time with these big eyes

00:04:43.892 --> 00:04:45.786
So I am like hey Isaac, 
hey Isaac

00:04:45.966 --> 00:04:47.202
what's on your mind man

00:04:47.335 --> 00:04:48.536
you okay big boy?

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:49.655
His like, "Trevor?"

00:04:50.377 --> 00:04:51.134
Yes?

00:04:52.081 --> 00:04:54.676
"can I come to your house and
play PlayStation later today?"

00:04:56.217 --> 00:04:58.046
How can you ask me about PlayStation,
your mom has just been shot

00:04:58.071 --> 00:05:00.120
you cant be asking me about that, whats
wrong with you you stupid child!

00:05:00.204 --> 00:05:01.891
You know what, you are never going
to play PlayStation again, ever

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:03.568
no PlayStation for you ever in your life, ever

00:05:03.593 --> 00:05:05.593
Go away, go sit down and think about what you just said!

00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:07.889
PlayStation, how the hell is he
going to ask me about PlayStation

00:05:07.921 --> 00:05:09.407
the nurse comes back and
she goes, "Okay Mr. Noah

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:11.918
we just used R900 for some blood tests."

00:05:11.943 --> 00:05:13.007
I am like okay, why are
you telling me this?

00:05:13.032 --> 00:05:15.344
It's R900, this is my mom.
Use the money, go!

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:17.479
She goes away. R900, how
you gonna talk about that?

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.759
She comes back and says, " Mr. Noah
we need R2000 for some x-rays"

00:05:20.784 --> 00:05:22.221
This is my mom, not a pair of jeans

00:05:22.246 --> 00:05:23.707
use the money, go!

00:05:23.787 --> 00:05:25.498
She goes away, I am like
my mom is going to die

00:05:25.523 --> 00:05:26.704
busy asking me questions over here

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:27.823
My mom is gonna die,
my mom's gonna die

00:05:27.848 --> 00:05:30.269
that's all I am saying, and I
say it and my brother hears me

00:05:30.388 --> 00:05:31.388
He starts crying.

00:05:31.707 --> 00:05:36.572
(crying)

00:05:36.597 --> 00:05:37.421
I am like, Isaac I am sorry.

00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:38.849
I am sorry, are you okay?

00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:40.750
He says, "I am not okay"

00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:44.387
"you said I am never going to play
PlayStation ever in my life!

00:05:45.375 --> 00:05:48.017
now I cant play Need for Speed
and cant play PlayStation"

00:05:48.042 --> 00:05:49.419
I am like, you still crying about PlayStation?

00:05:49.444 --> 00:05:51.070
you have no right to cry, you hear me!

00:05:51.095 --> 00:05:52.169
Shut up, stop crying!

00:05:52.302 --> 00:05:53.844
You cant cry about this,
you shut up!

00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:55.996
Now a woman comes out, she
knows my mom has been shot

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:58.165
now she thinks I am telling my
brother not to cry about my mom

00:05:58.196 --> 00:05:59.024
She just gets involved, she is like

00:05:59.049 --> 00:06:00.548
"Hey, you let him cry okay!

00:06:00.645 --> 00:06:03.323
you let him cry, some people
express their pain in different ways

00:06:03.348 --> 00:06:04.348
you let him cry!"

00:06:04.715 --> 00:06:06.739
I am like I will not let him cry
lady, I will not let him cry

00:06:06.844 --> 00:06:08.582
many kids grow up without one, okay

00:06:08.607 --> 00:06:09.839
this is not, it's fine

00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:11.973
like, he should go play
in the park or something

00:06:12.045 --> 00:06:13.325
it's not the time to cry
right now, what the hell

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.111
you spoil your kids,
that's your problem

00:06:15.152 --> 00:06:17.351
you take it away from them so
they can learn about life!

00:06:17.507 --> 00:06:19.609
You and you, you both shut up!
All of you, shut up!

00:06:20.078 --> 00:06:21.366
I am telling them this,
the nurse comes back

00:06:21.391 --> 00:06:23.057
She goes, "Mr Noah, we
are ready for surgery."

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:23.813
I am like, so do the surgery.

00:06:23.838 --> 00:06:25.364
She says, "yes but sir,
this can get very expensive

00:06:25.425 --> 00:06:26.634
ICU and surgery is very expensive"

00:06:26.667 --> 00:06:29.182
I am like, Lady what is expensive? 
This is my mother.

00:06:29.242 --> 00:06:30.659
She says, "anywhere from like R20 000"

00:06:30.684 --> 00:06:31.944
I am like, R20 000?
This is my mom.

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:33.976
"all the way to like R500 000."

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.116
Yo, but she has lived hey?

00:06:50.281 --> 00:06:51.193
I mean

00:06:53.487 --> 00:06:55.815
I mean she is like what 57, 57?

00:06:55.884 --> 00:06:57.595
it's almost finished, you know?

00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:00.542
even she says she is old, I mean.
You know?

00:07:01.034 --> 00:07:04.195
You said the bullet is in the head,
I mean the head, it's finished.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.471
yo, because with that money we
need to pay for the funeral

00:07:09.246 --> 00:07:11.570
we need to buy scones for everybody

00:07:12.638 --> 00:07:15.018
this guy needs a
PlayStation, you know

00:07:15.677 --> 00:07:16.931
so I don’t know if

00:07:17.455 --> 00:07:20.102
she says, "Sir we need the go ahead
otherwise we cant do anything"

00:07:20.368 --> 00:07:23.326
I said okay, well use the card.
Just use the card

00:07:23.881 --> 00:07:25.239
we will handle the debt

00:07:25.505 --> 00:07:27.176
She goes away, I am stressed

00:07:27.817 --> 00:07:29.258
because I have seen this happen to people

00:07:29.676 --> 00:07:31.865
go into hospital, don’t
have enough money

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.597
use your credit card and the next
thing you are in debt for years

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:35.377
and the person could die

00:07:35.489 --> 00:07:37.293
the person dies and when they die

00:07:37.392 --> 00:07:38.659
the doctor doesn’t give
you your money back

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:40.685
No, no he doesn’t

00:07:40.743 --> 00:07:42.608
because he tried and
that is all he has to do

00:07:42.744 --> 00:07:44.841
you will get there and be
like, Doctor did you win?

00:07:44.945 --> 00:07:46.238
He would be like
(Ironic sound)

00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:50.498
and your money is gone

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.120
that is all I was stressed about

00:07:55.064 --> 00:07:56.774
but the most amazing thing happened

00:07:57.854 --> 00:08:01.467
turns out my mother was not that badly hurt.

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:03.296
it was a miracle really

00:08:04.215 --> 00:08:05.364
the ass bullets

00:08:06.184 --> 00:08:07.396
didn’t do much damage

00:08:08.114 --> 00:08:09.429
because my family is gifted.

00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:13.466
the head bullet

00:08:13.891 --> 00:08:15.294
didn’t hit anything vital

00:08:15.548 --> 00:08:17.128
other than the head, obviously

00:08:18.559 --> 00:08:20.529
but it missed her spinal cord

00:08:20.746 --> 00:08:23.427
missed the nerves,
didn’t touch the brain

00:08:23.632 --> 00:08:25.993
went right through, missed the eye

00:08:26.134 --> 00:08:28.243
hit the eye socket and deflected

00:08:28.342 --> 00:08:31.081
and all it did was cut a
piece of her nostril off

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:32.295
just one side

00:08:32.443 --> 00:08:34.122
and the bullet went out clean.

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:37.355
which meant she didn’t have to
go in for intensive surgery

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:39.557
and her recovery was only a week.

00:08:40.068 --> 00:08:42.011
Yeah, a week. 
Which was fantastic

00:08:42.449 --> 00:08:45.433
because that means the bill was only R24 000.

00:08:47.133 --> 00:08:49.297
and she is alive, yes
but the bill

00:08:49.804 --> 00:08:51.553
was only R24 000

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:53.723
this was great, really great

00:08:53.811 --> 00:08:55.527
because R25 000 was my cut-off

00:08:56.603 --> 00:08:57.489
So

00:08:57.754 --> 00:09:01.023
You laugh but that is how much I
calculated I am willing to pay my mom back

00:09:01.254 --> 00:09:03.820
for all the Ultramel custard
I have consumed in my life.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.752
everything else, none of my business

00:09:07.177 --> 00:09:10.011
food, clothes, schooling, all
of that stuff I am not paying

00:09:10.083 --> 00:09:11.299
I hate it when the parents
say that to they're kids

00:09:11.324 --> 00:09:13.513
"You know how hard I have to work
for your bloody school and clothes"

00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:14.951
"No, no, no!

00:09:15.104 --> 00:09:16.652
I didn’t ask to be born,
that's your job.

00:09:17.104 --> 00:09:19.169
Please, you handle that

00:09:19.525 --> 00:09:21.617
I asked for the Ultramel,
we can keep a tab

00:09:23.273 --> 00:09:24.882
don’t involve me in your things."

00:09:26.324 --> 00:09:28.018
and that is what I calculated, R25 000.

00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:31.117
I would have been there, R24 750

00:09:31.136 --> 00:09:32.420
I would have been
there by the doctor

00:09:32.445 --> 00:09:34.176
Hey Doc, it's fine my man.
No stop.

00:09:34.202 --> 00:09:35.336
no, you tried

00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:36.361
you tried, it's cool

00:09:36.424 --> 00:09:38.704
no you tried, just switch
off there, switch off

00:09:39.239 --> 00:09:40.405
How much, 250 left?

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.421
we will pop a draw, just
switch off there, it's fine

00:09:43.396 --> 00:09:44.396
you tried.

00:09:48.123 --> 00:09:49.190
it was fantastic

00:09:49.419 --> 00:09:51.605
I told my mom about
the 25, she laughed

00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:53.274
she didn’t know I was serious.

00:09:56.217 --> 00:09:58.026
and to show you what a
crazy family we have

00:09:58.903 --> 00:10:00.258
my mom is in the recovery ward

00:10:00.283 --> 00:10:01.824
she has got these tubes
in her and everything

00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:03.078
and an I.V

00:10:03.505 --> 00:10:06.175
and my brother is in the
corner, bored out of his mind

00:10:06.795 --> 00:10:09.330
and my grandmother is in the
other corner reading the bible

00:10:09.558 --> 00:10:11.222
and I am holding my mom's
hand and I am crying

00:10:11.348 --> 00:10:12.867
still crying, this is a week later.
I am still crying

00:10:13.179 --> 00:10:15.268
(crying)

00:10:15.293 --> 00:10:16.419
I have been crying the whole week

00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:19.008
but I have also been using this time
to cry for other things in my life.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:21.957
No, because as a man you
need to know when to cry

00:10:21.988 --> 00:10:24.284
you loop it all together and you
just cry one time, it's like

00:10:24.748 --> 00:10:27.119
like we cry in bulk,
you got to understand

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:29.528
You don’t just cry, one, one, one, no

00:10:30.021 --> 00:10:31.021
cry in bulk.

00:10:31.839 --> 00:10:32.839
so I am crying for everything

00:10:32.864 --> 00:10:35.258
(crying)

00:10:35.283 --> 00:10:36.441
and my mom looks at me and she goes

00:10:36.466 --> 00:10:38.917
"Shh Trevor, don’t 
cry my baby"

00:10:39.098 --> 00:10:41.062
I said no mom I got to cry,
you where shot in the head.

00:10:41.087 --> 00:10:43.461
She says no, look on the bright side

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.053
I said, what bright side?

00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:47.735
She said, at least now
because of my nose

00:10:48.616 --> 00:10:51.144
you are officially the best
looking person in the family.

00:10:52.579 --> 00:10:55.410
I was like, by default.
(crying)
