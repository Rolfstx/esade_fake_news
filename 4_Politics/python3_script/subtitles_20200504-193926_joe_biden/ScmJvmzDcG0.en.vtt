JOHN OLIVER:<i> Crime.</i>

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.472
You know that thing that was
almost solved

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:08.908
-by a flasher dog in 1980's.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:09.008 --> 00:00:10.476
But specifically this story
is about

00:00:10.576 --> 00:00:13.413
how we increasingly solve crimes
using forensic evidence.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:15.648
It's that thing that
is just a staple

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:17.116
of TV crime shows.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.486
Pull it from the torso
on the left.

00:00:20.953 --> 00:00:22.789
Pull it from
the boat on the right.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.091
Two hearts beat as one.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:27.393
Matches up perfectly.

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:30.062
-(DISTORTED SOUND)
-That's a match.

00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.698
-(COMPUTER BEEPS)
-MAN 1: We've got a match.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:32.865
MAN 2: And it just found
us a match.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.033
WOMAN 1: Visible match.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:35.401
-WOMAN 2: We've a match.
-Match.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:36.636
MAN 3: Were you able
to determine

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:37.837
which monkey bit him?

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:38.938
The bite marks match

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:40.573
those of the monkey found
at the scene.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.941
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Wow!

00:00:42.608 --> 00:00:43.943
That last one was presumably

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.979
from one of the crossover
episodes where the team

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.080
from<i> Law &amp; Order,</i>

00:00:47.447 --> 00:00:50.283
worked a case with the cast
of Monkey Law and Monkey Order.

00:00:50.383 --> 00:00:52.318
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-(MONKEY SCREECHES)

00:00:52.418 --> 00:00:53.820
-But...
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:57.356
on TV and in real life
forensic science plays

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.392
an important role
in criminal convictions.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:02.995
Prosecutors often complain
about a so called C.S.I. effect,

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:06.365
where jurors expect to see
forensic evidence in every case.

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:08.835
The problem is,
not all forensic science

00:01:08.935 --> 00:01:11.438
is as reliable as we've become
accustomed to believe.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:12.939
A report in 2009,

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.874
by the National Academy
of Sciences found that

00:01:14.974 --> 00:01:16.176
many forensic scientists

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:19.012
do not meet the fundamental
requirements of science.

00:01:19.112 --> 00:01:20.179
And a report last year

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.415
by a Presidential Science
Council agreed saying that,

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.617
"expert witnesses have often
overstated

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:27.319
the value of their evidence,
going far beyond

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:29.388
what the relevant science
can justify,"

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:30.756
and that's the thing here.

00:01:30.856 --> 00:01:33.092
It's not that
all forensic science is bad,

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:35.227
'cause it's not, but too often,

00:01:35.327 --> 00:01:37.997
it's reliability
is dangerously overstated

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:40.600
and one sign of that is that
forensic experts in court

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.802
are often nudged to use one
very convincing phrase.

00:01:44.303 --> 00:01:46.705
MAN 4: To a reasonable degree
of the scientific certainty...

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.607
To a reasonable degree
of scientific certainty...

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:50.677
MAN 5: To a reasonable degree
of the scientific certainty...

00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.512 line:0%
Within reasonable
scientific certainty...

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:55.948 line:0%
To a reasonable degree
of scientific certainty...

00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:58.684
MAN 6: Are you able to say that
within a reasonable degree

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:00.853
-of the scientific certainty?
-Yes.

00:02:01.387 --> 00:02:02.722
And here's the thing that phrase

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:05.158
does have a persuasive ring
to it. Unfortunately,

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:07.093
as that Presidential Council
pointed out,

00:02:07.193 --> 00:02:10.396
it has no generally accepted
meaning in science.

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:13.232
It's one of those terms
like, basic or trill

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:16.001
that has no commonly
understood definition.

00:02:16.202 --> 00:02:17.469
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Am I trill?

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:18.704
Is that good or bad?

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:21.840
I mean I do feel trill,
so I'm guessing it's awful.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:25.110
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And-- when bad science

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.080
is confidently presented,
terrible convictions can happen.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.982
In fact, among the hundreds
of people

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:32.785
who have been exonerated
by DNA testing since 1989,

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:34.921
in nearly half of their cases,

00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.289
there was some misapplication
of forensic science

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.492
and there are people
behind those numbers.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:42.295
Take Santae Tribble, who was
convicted of murder

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:44.630
and served 26 years.
In large part,

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:47.300
thanks to an FBI analyst
who testified that his hair

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.735
matched hairs found
at the scene.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:49.869
And as he will tell you,

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:52.538
the evidence was presented,
as being rock solid.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.208 line:0%
They said they matched my hair

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:57.843 line:0%
in all microscopical
characteristics.

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:01.213
<i> And that's the way
 they presented it to the jury</i>

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:05.051
and the jury took it for granted
that, that was my hair.

00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:07.520
But you know, I can see,
why they did.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.189
Because who other
than an FBI expert

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:12.525
would possibly know
that much about hair?

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.626
Except of course,

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:17.096
whoever stalled Amanda Seyfried
at the 2009 Oscars.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.564
Breath taking waves,

00:03:18.665 --> 00:03:21.000
without loosing
any of their body or bounce.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.035
-Stunning.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.604
-Stunning!
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:03:25.704 --> 00:03:27.339

Stunning! Stunning! Stunning!
Stunning! Stunning! Stunning!

00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:32.378
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:35.782
The jurors in Tribble's case,
were actually told

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:37.784
there was one chance
in ten million

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:39.986
that it could be someone
else's hair, and guess what?

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:41.354
He was exonerated.

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:44.590
Because once DNA analysis became
available, his lawyer tested

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.158
the thirteen hairs from the case

00:03:46.258 --> 00:03:48.461
and not only were
none of them his,

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.762
some of what they found
was incredible.

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:52.899
SANDRA LEVICK:<i> Nine of the
 hairs had come from the
 same source,</i>

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.067 line:0%
a couple had come
from different sources

00:03:55.167 --> 00:03:56.202 line:0%
and one was a dog.

INTERVIEWER: Two different
FBI agents who had, eh,

00:03:58.604 --> 00:04:01.107 line:0%
looked at that and analyzed it,
didn't recognize that it was

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:02.709
-dog hair?
-It was a K9.

00:04:03.876 --> 00:04:05.611
It was a domestic dog, yes.

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:08.381
My personal conclusion was,

00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:11.818
-the dog committed the crime.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:04:12.585 --> 00:04:13.519
Okay.

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:17.055
So, first, it is amazing that
he is able to laugh at that,

00:04:17.322 --> 00:04:19.425
but second, if a dog did
commit the crime

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:22.528
there's really no recourse there
because there is actually no law

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:24.163
against dogs committing murder

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:26.365
and that's a fact
that learned in<i> Air Bud 9,</i>

00:04:26.465 --> 00:04:27.566
<i> Fuck the Paw-lice!</i>

00:04:27.666 --> 00:04:29.102
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And--

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:30.503
it turns out,

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:33.739
Tribble is not the only case
where FBI experts

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.875
overstated their confidence
in their results.

there is weak scientific support

is highly subjective
and unreliable.

The President's Council found
the entire discipline,

00:06:10.536 --> 00:06:12.504
does not meet
the scientific standards

speak for "Bullshit!"

But people have been sent
to prison

00:06:20.246 --> 00:06:22.648
on the basis of bite mark
testimony by experts like,

00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:23.949

to a bite mark
in a bologna sandwich,

00:06:47.806 --> 00:06:49.976
although, you should know
that the defendant in that case,

00:06:50.076 --> 00:06:52.044
got a new trial
after an autopsy report

00:06:52.144 --> 00:06:53.345
found that the murder victim

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:55.748
had actually eaten
a small amount of bologna

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:58.217

bitten off the sandwich.

and where the charges
were dropped

00:07:17.402 --> 00:07:18.971
or the conviction was
later over turned

00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:20.373
and even West himself

00:07:20.573 --> 00:07:22.508
has admitted that
he no longer believes

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:25.745
in bite mark analysis
for identifying perpetrators

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:27.679
and he doesn't think it should
be used in court.

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:29.115
And yet, incredibly,

00:07:29.215 --> 00:07:31.784
every time a defendant
has challenged its validity

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.819
the court has
ruled it admissible.

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:35.955
And a key reason for that

00:07:36.055 --> 00:07:38.190
is that judges often rely
on precedent

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.325
to decide what to allow
in front of a jury. So,

00:07:40.425 --> 00:07:43.061
if a particular discipline
has been in court before

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:45.398
it is likely that a judge
will admit it again.

00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:47.633
All of which means
that as the co-founder

00:07:47.733 --> 00:07:49.301
of the Innocence Project
points out,

00:07:49.568 --> 00:07:52.171
decisions about the validity
of science are being made

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:55.174
by people who don't necessarily
know much about it.

00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:58.310 line:0%
Historically, we had
a situation where,

00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:00.879 line:0%
two scientifically
illiterate lawyers

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:04.216
argued the bonafides
of scientific evidence

00:08:04.416 --> 00:08:06.485
before a scientifically
illiterate judge,

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:09.355
so the 12 scientifically
illiterate jurors

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:11.423
could decide the weight
of that evidence.

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.760
And if you think about it,
that's absolutely terrifying.

00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:17.429
Trials can often be a situation
when no one

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:18.998
really knows
what they are doing.

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:21.199
It's like a cooking competition
for toddlers,

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:24.403
hosted by a stray cat
and judged by goats.

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:25.504
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Oh.

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:26.906
The tuna was under cooked

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:28.741
and covered
in cold spaghetti sauce.

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:29.808
You then for some reason

00:08:29.908 --> 00:08:32.110
cover the whole dish
in honey nut cheerios.

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:34.646
-I loved it.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.682
And look, none of this
is to say,

00:08:36.782 --> 00:08:39.251
that there is not reliable
forensic science out there.

00:08:39.351 --> 00:08:41.019
Finger prints and DNA

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:43.822
are obvious examples but while
we think of them as perfect,

00:08:43.922 --> 00:08:45.190
it is important to know

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:47.459
they are by no means infallible.

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:49.528
The FBI has found
fingerprint analysis

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:50.830
could have a false positive rate

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.699
as high as one error
in 306 cases.

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.334
And a dramatic example of this

00:08:55.434 --> 00:08:58.137
came after the Madrid's
train bombings in 2004

00:08:58.237 --> 00:09:02.074
when the FBI arrested this
Oregon man, Brandon Mayfield.

00:09:02.174 --> 00:09:05.177
He had never even
been to Spain in his life.

00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:09.081
But, three separate examiners,
matched his finger prints

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.917
to one on a bag of detonators.
So, he was at that point,

00:09:12.184 --> 00:09:13.785
completely fucked!

00:09:14.052 --> 00:09:16.522
Until, investigators happen
to determine that,

00:09:16.622 --> 00:09:19.658
that fingerprint actually
also matched someone else

00:09:19.958 --> 00:09:22.661
who was in Spain at the time
and that blew the minds

00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:24.263
of finger print experts.

00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:25.798
MARK ACREE:
<i> We always assume</i>

00:09:25.898 --> 00:09:28.066
<i> that finger prints
 are very very unique,</i>

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.237
<i> but what the Mayfield case
 demonstrates, is that</i>

00:09:32.604 --> 00:09:35.040 line:0%
parts of a fingerprint
can be

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:38.510 line:0%
so similar, it's possible
for two people to be

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.346
<i> identified to one print.</i>

00:09:41.613 --> 00:09:42.682
That's true.

00:09:42.782 --> 00:09:44.817
It turns out that two people
can have finger prints

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:47.320
that are so close that even
experts can't tell them apart.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.288
Meaning that we are
now this close

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:53.525
to finally proving my theory.
There is only one Olsen twin.

00:09:53.892 --> 00:09:55.861
She's just moving very fast

00:09:55.961 --> 00:09:56.962
-back and forth.
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:09:57.062 --> 00:09:58.297
She confuses your eye.

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.933
Now, I don't know how this
new information helps me, yet,

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:04.636
but when it does, the end is--
No! You frauds! You frauds!

00:10:04.903 --> 00:10:07.973
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.609
And then-- there is DNA,

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:13.512
which is the gold standard
in forensic science for a reason

00:10:13.612 --> 00:10:14.747
because in perfect conditions

00:10:14.847 --> 00:10:17.282
it's seen as the most reliable
form of evidence, but

00:10:17.716 --> 00:10:19.785
not all DNA tests are equal

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:23.322
and crime scenes can produce DNA
of widely varying quality.

00:10:23.822 --> 00:10:26.992 line:0%
NARRATOR 2:<i> DNA is very fragile
 and easily mixed up</i>

00:10:27.226 --> 00:10:28.427
<i> at a messy scene.</i>

00:10:28.527 --> 00:10:30.062
BRAD HART:<i> So, imagine you come
 across a crime scene.</i>

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:31.196 line:0%
You may have a pool of blood

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:33.265 line:0%
but it may not just be
one person's blood, right?

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:36.669 line:0%
The more contributors to that--
mixture of DNA

00:10:36.769 --> 00:10:39.505
the more difficult it is,
to determine, whose DNA it was.

00:10:39.605 --> 00:10:40.772
<i> Whose blood it was.</i>

00:10:41.172 --> 00:10:43.709
Exactly, it can be difficult
to tell whose blood is whose,

00:10:43.809 --> 00:10:46.145
in a large pool of blood,
which is coincidentally,

00:10:46.412 --> 00:10:48.013
the premise
of my new game show.

00:10:48.113 --> 00:10:49.915
So, you think you can tell
whose blood is whose

00:10:50.015 --> 00:10:51.250
in a large pool of blood?

00:10:51.483 --> 00:10:53.619
It premieres on Tuesday night
and apparently,

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:56.589
-it's already been cancelled.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:58.523
But the problem here is,

00:10:58.623 --> 00:11:01.893
lower quality DNA samples are
sometimes presented to juries

00:11:01.993 --> 00:11:04.897
as if they are highly reliable.
In 2003,

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:08.100
a prosecutor in a double murder
told the jury that the odds,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.436
the defendant's DNA match
the glove found at the scene

00:11:10.536 --> 00:11:13.639
by chance,
was one in 1.1 billion.

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:16.308
So, that's pretty
strikingly impressive, but

00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:18.777
it turned out the glove
actually contained at least

00:11:19.078 --> 00:11:21.313
three people's DNA
and a later analysis

00:11:21.413 --> 00:11:23.915
put the odds closer,
to one in two.

00:11:24.216 --> 00:11:26.685
And you know what?
That's close enough isn't it?

00:11:26.919 --> 00:11:28.053
People do confuse

00:11:28.153 --> 00:11:31.390
the numbers 1.1 billion
and two all the time.

00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.158
That's why I'm always
mistakenly saying

00:11:33.258 --> 00:11:36.394
that my favorite R&amp;B group
is Boyz 1.1 Billion Men.

00:11:36.494 --> 00:11:37.496
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:40.265
And on top of all of this
there is one more fact

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:42.100
that can be impossible
to detect.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.137
And it concerns the relationship
between law enforcement

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:47.807
and the forensic labs themselves
because you would hope

00:11:47.907 --> 00:11:51.410
that those labs would work
independently taking in evidence

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:55.247
and spitting out results.
But many labs work closely

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:57.650
with law enforcement
knowing details

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.151
of the case that they are
working on

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:02.254
which can prejudice their work
even subconsciously.

00:12:02.688 --> 00:12:05.123 line:0%
Sometimes
it's not intentional fraud

00:12:05.223 --> 00:12:09.528 line:0%
but rather, something, um,
much more, uh, inadvertent.

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.564 line:0%
Uh, which is the kind of bias

00:12:11.764 --> 00:12:14.433 line:0%
that can come from feeling like
you're part of a side

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:16.735 line:0%
part of a team, that you--
you're part of--

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:18.403 line:0%
you're attached
to the prosecution

00:12:18.603 --> 00:12:21.407 line:0%
and you wanna get, uh,
get the bad guy.

00:12:21.874 --> 00:12:24.176
Yeah, but that's not their job!

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:26.612
At all! They are supposed
to be neutral.

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.814
If a referee,
started participating

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:30.616
in a team's end zone
celebration,

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:33.451
you'd have some serious
fucking questions,

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:35.187
like, why have you picked
a side?

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:37.789
And, how long you've been
practicing the dirty bird?

00:12:37.889 --> 00:12:39.058
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:12:39.158 --> 00:12:41.927
So, clearly here a lot needs
to be fixed

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:45.063
and some states have stepped up.
One has done a lot.

00:12:45.163 --> 00:12:48.434
Including passing a first
of its kind Junk Science law.

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:51.470
Which enables convicts
to request a new trial,

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.772
if the sides used to convict
them was flawed,

00:12:53.872 --> 00:12:55.440
and that sounds great and

00:12:55.707 --> 00:12:57.942
the pioneering state that did
that by the way,

00:12:58.243 --> 00:12:59.478
-was Texas.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:12:59.678 --> 00:13:01.346
Yes, I know!

00:13:01.613 --> 00:13:02.881
-Texas!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:05.450
You don't expect Texas
to lead the nation

00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.686
in science-related criminal
justice reform.

00:13:08.153 --> 00:13:09.521
You expect them to lead
the nation

00:13:09.621 --> 00:13:11.123
in remembering the Alamo

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.425
or naming
their children "Football."

00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:14.626
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:13:14.726 --> 00:13:17.229
"I love you Football but if you
ever forget the Alamo

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:19.064
-we are done."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:13:19.164 --> 00:13:21.166
Now, sadly, at the federal level

00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:23.401
progress has been slow.
Although, one group,

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:25.403
the National Commission
on Forensic Science

00:13:25.503 --> 00:13:27.406
has tried to fix that.
They were founded

00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:31.109
to advise the DOJ on how
to address many of the problems,

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:32.377
that you've seen tonight.

00:13:32.578 --> 00:13:34.279
And their most recent meeting,

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:36.348
featured powerful remarks
from Keith Harward,

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:38.550
who spent 33 years in prison

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.285
for a crime that
he did not commit

00:13:40.385 --> 00:13:42.287
based on faulty
bite mark evidence.

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:45.457
Some would say, "Well you're
a free man," well...

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:48.427
I will never be free of this.

00:13:49.094 --> 00:13:52.665
There's no possibility--
Excuse me if I get emotional.

00:13:53.398 --> 00:13:54.400 line:0%
That...

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.337 line:0%
I spent more than half my life
in prison...

00:13:59.538 --> 00:14:02.374 line:0%
behind the opinions...

00:14:03.442 --> 00:14:06.145 line:0%
and the expert egos...

00:14:07.212 --> 00:14:09.047 line:0%
of two Odontologist.

00:14:09.514 --> 00:14:11.950 line:0%
There's a death penalty case
in Pennsylvania

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.051 line:0%
that's going on now

00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:14.787 line:0%
and the judge
is going to allow

00:14:14.987 --> 00:14:16.222 line:0%
bite mark evidence.

00:14:17.021 --> 00:14:18.724 line:0%
How many people have to be

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:21.093 line:0%
wrongly convicted
before they realize

00:14:21.927 --> 00:14:23.762 line:0%
that this stuff's all bogus?

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:25.798 line:0%
It's all-- made up.

00:14:26.632 --> 00:14:28.033
That's a good question

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:29.668
and it's also the kind of speech

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:31.569
that could really inspire
that commission

00:14:31.669 --> 00:14:33.705
to do a lot of good work.
Unfortunately,

00:14:34.072 --> 00:14:36.041
that was actually their
final meeting

00:14:36.275 --> 00:14:38.076
because the commission
was shut down in April

00:14:38.176 --> 00:14:39.144
by Attorney General

00:14:39.244 --> 00:14:41.513
and xenophobic boss baby,
Jeff Sessions.

00:14:41.613 --> 00:14:42.647
And know what?

00:14:42.747 --> 00:14:44.482
That shouldn't really surprise
you anyways.

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:46.184
Sessions is a former prosecutor

00:14:46.284 --> 00:14:47.986
and he does seem like the kind
of guy who watched

00:14:48.086 --> 00:14:50.355
<i> Dead Man Walking</i> and was
like, hurry up!

00:14:50.455 --> 00:14:52.057
Let's kill the guy already!

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:54.692
This movie should be called,
"Dead Man Dilly Dallying".

00:14:54.792 --> 00:14:56.695
Let's go people, let's go!

00:14:57.262 --> 00:15:00.398
So, we may honestly be actively
going backwards on this issue,

00:15:00.498 --> 00:15:01.599
which is dangerous,

00:15:01.699 --> 00:15:04.235
because not only are innocent
people getting convicted,

00:15:04.469 --> 00:15:07.539
guilty criminals are being left
on the streets as a result.

00:15:07.739 --> 00:15:10.475
And if this administration
does not see this as a problem

00:15:10.575 --> 00:15:12.310
then we should
at the very least,

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.246
do more to educate
potential jurors

00:15:14.346 --> 00:15:16.414
about some of the short comings
in our system

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:19.351
and one small way to do that,
might be this:

♪ (ROCK &amp; ROLL MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

00:15:33.532 --> 00:15:35.968
Alright everybody, let's get
this stuff back to the lab.

00:15:36.068 --> 00:15:40.205
Hey chief, no need.
Look what I found, bite mark.

00:15:40.773 --> 00:15:42.074
Bologna sandwich.

00:15:43.007 --> 00:15:44.476
Now, that's what I call...

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:48.380
-"Dead meat."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:15:50.816 --> 00:15:53.352
Whoa!
The fuck is wrong with you?

00:15:53.452 --> 00:15:55.020
Dead meat? This is a murder.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.190
-That's a human person.
-That is his wife over there.

00:16:05.931 --> 00:16:07.499
I'm getting something on these
bite marks here,

00:16:07.599 --> 00:16:09.134
but it's far from conclusive.

00:16:09.435 --> 00:16:11.336
Would you say
there's a reasonable degree

00:16:11.436 --> 00:16:13.105
of scientific certainty?

00:16:13.372 --> 00:16:14.273
No.

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:16.942

-Right.

Slow down.

00:16:27.385 --> 00:16:30.222
Microscopic hair comparison
is bullshit science.

00:16:30.322 --> 00:16:31.356
Chief,

00:16:31.456 --> 00:16:33.859
I ran a mitochondrial DNA test
on those hairs.

00:16:33.959 --> 00:16:35.860
The wife did it right?
Case closed.

00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:37.629
Actually, there were five hairs.

00:16:37.996 --> 00:16:41.833
-Three were from... a coconut.
-And two were from... the wife.

00:16:42.133 --> 00:16:44.869
One was
from a Cabbage Patch Kid

00:16:44.969 --> 00:16:46.405
and the remaining one was from--

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.674
-The wife.
-This Golden Retriever.

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:51.643

"Woof" justice.

00:17:07.158 --> 00:17:09.828
We're in doors. Fuck you.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:13.031
NARRATOR 3:<i> And he won't stop
 asking the hard questions.</i>

00:17:13.598 --> 00:17:18.470
How 'bout a certainly reasonable
science degree to--

00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:20.205
No.

00:17:20.972 --> 00:17:22.007
Yeah, okay.

00:17:22.608 --> 00:17:24.742
NARRATOR 3:<i> Because
 he's passionate about his job.</i>

00:17:25.009 --> 00:17:28.346

 what that job is.</i>

If we don't have something solid
by tomorrow,

00:17:30.615 --> 00:17:32.150
D.A. is gonna have my ass.

00:17:32.517 --> 00:17:34.152
Why would the D.A.
have your ass?

00:17:34.252 --> 00:17:35.821
We don't work for the D.A.

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:39.190
-What?
-We don't work for the D.A.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.659
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You do understand that, right?

00:17:40.759 --> 00:17:42.861
Please, tell us
you understand that.

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:46.164
-Well, yeah.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:17:46.264 --> 00:17:47.466
I understand that.
Totally.

00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:50.135
NARRATOR 3:<i> Oh, there's no way
 he understands that.</i>

00:17:50.435 --> 00:17:54.439
<i>Because this guy, will not quit.</i>

00:17:54.772 --> 00:17:56.942
How about
a certainly reasonable--

00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:58.477
-Stop talking.
-Okay.

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.412
-Keep up the good work.
-Okay.

NARRATOR 3:<i> And even when
 his team abandons him</i>

00:18:02.981 --> 00:18:05.083

 for back-up.</i>

00:18:05.183 --> 00:18:07.118
-This better be good.
-Oh, it is.

00:18:07.218 --> 00:18:08.520
I brought in some extra help.

00:18:08.787 --> 00:18:11.090
Expert witnesses to help
lock in this case.

00:18:11.556 --> 00:18:12.658
Take a look.

-(PONY WHEEZING)
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:18:25.404 --> 00:18:27.205
None of this is admissible
in court.

00:18:27.705 --> 00:18:30.108
Actually, three of them have
testified in court before

00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:31.577
and they all got convictions.

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:34.645
Is that the bologna
evidence sandwich?

Oh my God!
