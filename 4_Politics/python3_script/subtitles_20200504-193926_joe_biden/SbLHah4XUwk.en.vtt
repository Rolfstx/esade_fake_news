00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.910
- I'm going to fly on Bhutan
Airlines 8319 on a flight to Paro.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:06.280
- Our boarding time is 8:13,

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.860
and after the immigration checks, on the right-hand side,

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.730
there is the Radisson lounge

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.320
and you can use the Radisson lounge, okay?

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.820
Have a nice flight, sir.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.848
- [Sam] Thank you.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.945
(upbeat music)

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:20.000
You can use your credit
card, a Lounge Key

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.487
or a Priority Pass to come to the lounge.

00:00:22.487 --> 00:00:25.070
(upbeat music)

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:33.880
Good morning from
Kathmandu Airport Lounge.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.090
And today I'm going to
fly to Paro, Bhutan.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.420
If you don't know where Bhutan is,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.830
it's a landlocked country in the Himalayas

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.900
between China, India, and Nepal.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.330
But as an Aviation geek, Bhutan
is very special because

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.520
Bhutan is well known for its dangerous

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.980
and unique approach in to their airport.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.580
The airport is situated between
the mountains in the valley.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.690
So guys, I'm very excited,
and let's go and fly.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.190
(aeroplane engine roaring)

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.980
- This is our plane, welcome aboard.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.675
- Hot towel sir ?

00:01:14.675 --> 00:01:16.475
- [Sam] Thank you.

00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:17.417
- What would you like to drink sir?

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:18.430
There's a drink menu.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.570
Please turn to the list, sir.

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:23.300
- [Sam] Orange juice.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.883
(upbeat music)

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.194
- Hello, and welcome aboard, Sam.

00:01:31.194 --> 00:01:32.670
My name is Chenga,

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.923
and I'm the Chief Pilot
of Bhutan Airlines.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.490
Today, the flight will be
from Kathmandu to Paro.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.250
The flight time will be just about

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.490
approximately about 40 minutes.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.373
And today we are expecting
to climb at least around,

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.730
subject to traffic, around
33,000 or maybe 35,000 feet,

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.000
and we're expecting good
weather on this route.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.303
And as we, maybe after 15 minutes or so,

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.270
we might see Mount
Everest, so as we go I'll,

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.960
I'll point them out to you.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.400
Thank you, welcome aboard.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.983
(upbeat music)

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.236
- Cockpit?

00:02:13.236 --> 00:02:14.342
- [Cockpit] Yes, sir?

00:02:14.342 --> 00:02:16.978
- We're just scanning hand signals
on the right, thank you.

00:02:16.978 --> 00:02:17.811
(cockpit responds)

00:02:17.811 --> 00:02:19.253
Bye-bye.

00:02:19.253 --> 00:02:21.468
(upbeat music)

00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:22.967
- Bhutan Air 774 to depart next

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:24.151
(tower responds)

00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.271
Next to all the plane, the
co-run is 02 Bhutan Air 774.

00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:30.410
(Chenga speaking softly)
Clear, I said.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.173
Next to all the plane a
co-run is 02 Bhutan Air 774.

00:02:34.294 --> 00:02:38.710
Are we clear to Paro, Gulf 34872708.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:43.880
This one ground departure,
Smoke 2510 Bhutan Air 774.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.860
(plane engine roaring)

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.540
Before takeoff check list.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.975
- Right.
- Flight controls?

00:02:52.975 --> 00:02:53.808
- Check.
- Check.

00:02:53.808 --> 00:02:56.030
Flight instruments?
- Check.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.123
- Check, briefing?
- Confirmed.

00:02:59.402 --> 00:03:03.013
- Flaps setting?
(Chenga speaks softly)

00:03:03.013 --> 00:03:06.733
V1, VR, V2, flex temperature?
- 1-2-7, 1-2-7, 1-40-8.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.189
- What?
- Flex 50.

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.007
- 1-2-7, 1-2-7, 1-4-8, flex 5-0.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.213
ATC, set.

00:03:15.717 --> 00:03:17.640
ECAM Memo?
- I don't know who.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.114
- Down with the 90.

00:03:19.114 --> 00:03:21.720
- Today, we are lucky.

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.896
Fortunately, not much traffic,

00:03:23.896 --> 00:03:26.203
But, most of the time,

00:03:26.203 --> 00:03:29.960
because of the traffic conditions

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.710
and the parking stands,

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.780
we end up holding sometimes for almost

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.760
45 minutes or at least one hour.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.903
We can end up waiting for that long
but today we are fortunate.

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:42.657
- [Tower] Bhutan Air
774 line up on the 02.

00:03:43.727 --> 00:03:46.692
- [Copilot] Line up on
the 02, Bhutan Air 774.

00:03:46.692 --> 00:03:51.692
(upbeat music)
(plane engine roaring)

00:03:55.142 --> 00:03:57.600
[Cheng] So we have the backs all green.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.042
(audio from tower)
(copilot speaking)

00:04:00.042 --> 00:04:03.173
- Runway 02, confirm.
(audio from tower]

00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:04.942
Cabin crew?
- Advised.

00:04:04.942 --> 00:04:06.695
(Copilot speaking)
- We are ready.

00:04:06.695 --> 00:04:08.671
(Cheng and copilot speaking)

00:04:08.671 --> 00:04:10.312
- Packs?
- On.

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:11.595
- Before lift off checklist?
- Done.

00:04:11.595 --> 00:04:12.849
- Okay, done.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.432
(upbeat music)

00:04:18.686 --> 00:04:23.686
- [Tower] Bhutan Air 774,
clear (muffled instructions)

00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:26.790

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.383
- [Copilot] Take this one (muffled speech)

00:04:31.383 --> 00:04:35.333
Clear for takeoff, Runway
02, Bhutan Air 774.

00:04:35.333 --> 00:04:36.213
- [Cheng] Are you ready?

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.033
Ready?
- Ready.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:38.902
- Ready, go.

00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:46.287
- Stabilised.
(plan engine revving)

00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:48.578
(audio from tower)

00:04:48.578 --> 00:04:50.052
- Check.

00:04:50.052 --> 00:04:51.993
We're all set.

00:04:51.993 --> 00:04:55.243
(plane engine roaring)

00:05:04.178 --> 00:05:06.401
- [Tower] 4519 (muffled instructions)

00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:10.444
(Copilot and tower conversing)

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:13.194
(plane rattling)

00:05:16.444 --> 00:05:17.277
- 3-1.

00:05:18.415 --> 00:05:19.248
Rocking.

00:05:22.467 --> 00:05:24.125
(plane engine rattling)

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:25.875
All systems light up.

00:05:27.031 --> 00:05:28.130
- Yep.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:29.061
Check.

00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:31.978
(audio from tower)

00:05:37.895 --> 00:05:40.262
- [Cheng] (speaking softly) Bhutan Air 774

00:05:40.262 --> 00:05:43.095
(speaking softly)

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:45.946
- [Tower] Bhutan Air 774

00:05:48.121 --> 00:05:49.786
Continue climb to flight level,

00:05:49.786 --> 00:05:52.619
2-7-0 continue to climb.

00:05:53.484 --> 00:05:57.743
- Correcting the plan level
2-7-0-8 Bhutan Air 774.

00:05:57.743 --> 00:06:00.465
(upbeat music)

00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:04.080
- [Tower] Bhatan Air 774
input crossing level.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.045
- [Cheng] Crossing 8,300 Bhutan Air 774.

00:06:07.045 --> 00:06:09.595
- [Tower] Bhutan 774 identified.

00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:12.160
- Between Kathmandu and
New Delhi you see almost

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.162
the top 10 highest mountains
in the world, except K2.

00:06:14.162 --> 00:06:15.840
- On the centre,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.883
just between the... within
a span of less than

00:06:18.883 --> 00:06:20.500
two hours,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.107
you almost see the top 10 highest
mountains in the world.

00:06:22.107 --> 00:06:25.310
So exactly left of me, that is Cho Oyu.

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.950
That is the 6th highest
mountain in the world.

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.930
And you can see a pointed peak there

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.453
with some snow getting blown off.

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.830
That is Everest.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.280
That is the highest point
around Mount Everest.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.660
The height is measured at 8,850 metres.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.610
And just close to Mt. Everest
you see another mountain.

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.443
That is Lhotse.

00:06:46.443 --> 00:06:48.940
That is supposed to be
the 4th highest mountain

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.580
in the world, Mount Lhotse.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.163
And the height of Mount
Lhotse is 8,516 metres.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.880
The last one that you see

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:57.070
is Mount Makalu.

00:06:57.070 --> 00:06:59.750
That is number five, 5th
highest mountain in the world.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.573
And the height of Mount
Makalu is 8,463 metres.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.303
(upbeat music)

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:17.790
Around twenty years back,

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:20.814
we used to find that this
area had a lot of snow.

00:07:20.814 --> 00:07:23.680
A lot of snow between
this Himalayan range.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.797
But as you can see, you know,

00:07:25.797 --> 00:07:27.307
now we don't see much snow.

00:07:27.307 --> 00:07:29.720
Sadly, I think that clearly shows

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:33.908
that global warming is
taking a big role here.

00:07:33.908 --> 00:07:36.491
(upbeat music)

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.600
- It's a 40-minute flight.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.734
This is very nice.

00:07:49.734 --> 00:07:52.400
This is like a chicken
pie here, very nice.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.233
Cheers.

00:07:57.755 --> 00:07:59.192
- I'd like to welcome you on board.

00:07:59.192 --> 00:08:00.114
- Wow.

00:08:00.114 --> 00:08:02.697
- This is something just yours.

00:08:03.824 --> 00:08:05.169
- Wow, so nice, thank you so much.

00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:07.378
- This is a welcome gift
to welcome you to town.

00:08:07.378 --> 00:08:09.045
- Wow, look at this.

00:08:11.553 --> 00:08:14.820
It says, "Bhutan Airlines
welcomes you on board."

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:15.900
Beautiful cake.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.210
Let's enjoy this cake
together with all the crew.

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:20.300
The captain, first officer.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.312
You guys are so kind.

00:08:21.312 --> 00:08:24.541
Lets share with everyone
later when we land in Paro.

00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:25.374
- Sure, sir.

00:08:25.374 --> 00:08:26.207
- Yeah? Alright, excellent.

00:08:26.207 --> 00:08:28.220
Thank you so much.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.637
(soft music)

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:34.553
- [Cheng] There, that's Bhutan Mountain.

00:08:34.553 --> 00:08:37.353
The left one is Jomolhari,

00:08:37.353 --> 00:08:38.814
that is the second highest mountain in Bhutan.

00:08:38.814 --> 00:08:39.647
- [Sam] Oh!

00:08:39.647 --> 00:08:42.940
- [Cheng] Yeah,and slightly
to the right is Jitchu Drake.

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:46.080
Then we have Masangang,
then it's Balonchista.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.750
Sam, so what we are going to do now...

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.410
We have just about 14 miles to go

00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:55.550
and then we will have the visual.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:58.590
So normally, once we have the
visual, we always turn

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.019
this GPWS system off.

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:03.450
Because normally it's a known standard.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.940
We're supposed to follow the
instruction of what the...

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.140
That means we are close to the mountains.

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.281
Since we have the visual, we
always turn this one off.

00:09:11.281 --> 00:09:13.503
(signal beep)

00:09:13.503 --> 00:09:15.678
- GPWS off?
- Yeah.

00:09:15.678 --> 00:09:18.928
(plane engine roaring)

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.240
(beep)

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.170
Once you push it, the GPWS will fall.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.201
(mechanical whining)
Gear down.

00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:34.091
(plane engine roaring)

00:09:34.091 --> 00:09:35.341
Bhutan Air 774.

00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:40.350
- [Tower] Bhutan Air 774
(muffled instructions).

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.586
- So the airport is just here behind this.

00:09:42.586 --> 00:09:44.305
Just behind this cloud.

00:09:44.305 --> 00:09:46.771
So what we're doing is
we're landing on Runway 3-3.

00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:50.957
So Sam, our viewer is just
over the hill, just over there.

00:09:50.957 --> 00:09:53.291
The reason why we had to keep this viewer

00:09:53.291 --> 00:09:54.701
is just to get the signal.

00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:57.326
Normally, the viewer is right

00:09:57.326 --> 00:10:00.073
at the airfield next to the runway.

00:10:00.073 --> 00:10:03.321
Here, in order to get the signal,

00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:04.928
the concept people are quickly going

00:10:04.928 --> 00:10:05.846
in order to get the signal.

00:10:05.846 --> 00:10:07.767
So we are just over the hill,

00:10:07.767 --> 00:10:11.794
and the airfield is just behind the hill.

00:10:11.794 --> 00:10:12.627
- [Sam] Right.

00:10:12.627 --> 00:10:13.460
- [Cheng] So what we're doing is

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.490
we're trying to lose the height

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.450
and trying to fly between the valley.

00:10:17.450 --> 00:10:19.160
And then our aim is to...

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.443
You can see there's a bridge there.

00:10:20.443 --> 00:10:21.463
- [Sam] Yeah.

00:10:21.463 --> 00:10:22.367
- That's where we're aiming there

00:10:22.367 --> 00:10:24.433
and we're looking for about 12,000 feet.

00:10:24.433 --> 00:10:27.576
And we call this a confluence because this is where

00:10:27.576 --> 00:10:30.429
two rivers from Thimphu
and Paro meet.

00:10:30.429 --> 00:10:32.412
So we are heading towards the bridge,

00:10:32.412 --> 00:10:34.376
and then we're going to
make a slight left turn

00:10:34.376 --> 00:10:35.668
and head towards the airfield.

00:10:35.668 --> 00:10:37.580
You can see the airfield just now.

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.032
Now you don't see it.

00:10:39.032 --> 00:10:40.553
You'll see airfield
only at the last minute.

00:10:40.553 --> 00:10:42.698
Only at the last moment
will you be able to see over there,

00:10:42.698 --> 00:10:44.028
because of the hills.

00:10:44.028 --> 00:10:45.290
- [Sam] Ah, it's hiding.

00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.200
- It's hiding, yeah.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.283
- [Sam] Yeah.

00:10:48.655 --> 00:10:50.854
- Let's do it, the landing checklist.

00:10:50.854 --> 00:10:53.354
- [Copilot] Landing checklist.

00:10:54.539 --> 00:10:55.456
Cabin crew?

00:10:57.453 --> 00:10:59.619
- Advised.
- Cabin crew.

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:00.829

ECAM MEMO?
- Steady.

00:11:10.003 --> 00:11:13.836
- And I'm a Buddhist so
I have to pray to God.

00:11:15.366 --> 00:11:17.599
And we have a lot of monasteries here.

00:11:17.599 --> 00:11:19.694
Can you see there's a
lot of monasteries here?

00:11:19.694 --> 00:11:21.244
There, one monastery there, one monastery,

00:11:21.244 --> 00:11:22.262
and one is below here.

00:11:22.262 --> 00:11:23.917
We have a lot of monasteries here.

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:27.167
(plane engine roaring)

00:11:29.449 --> 00:11:31.699
- [Electronic Voice] 2,500.

00:11:33.113 --> 00:11:38.113
- [Copilot] Bhutan Air

00:11:42.786 --> 00:11:47.786
(plane engine roaring)
(mechanical whirring)

00:11:53.601 --> 00:11:56.820
- We have a... you can see
there's another monastery here.

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.952
There, one more monastery,
there's Paro Taktsang.

00:11:58.952 --> 00:12:00.281
It's a very popular monastery.

00:12:00.281 --> 00:12:03.748
And, further left, you
can see another monastery.

00:12:03.748 --> 00:12:08.748
(plane engine roaring)
(solemn music)

00:12:21.117 --> 00:12:23.332
- [Electronic Voice] 1,000.

00:12:23.332 --> 00:12:25.915
- [Copilot] Flight, stabilised.

00:12:34.208 --> 00:12:36.291

- [Electronic Voice] 200.

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:32.941
- [Electronic Voice] 50.

00:13:32.941 --> 00:13:35.539
- [Electronic Voice] 40, 30, 20, retard,

00:13:35.539 --> 00:13:39.217
retard, retard, retard.

00:13:40.339 --> 00:13:42.541
- [Copilot] Spoilers.

00:13:42.541 --> 00:13:43.374
GUSB?

00:13:44.498 --> 00:13:45.331
It's in.

00:13:46.335 --> 00:13:49.585
(plane engine roaring)

00:13:56.745 --> 00:14:00.245
(Copilot speaking softly)

00:14:07.755 --> 00:14:12.755
(Audio from tower)
(Mechanical clicking)

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:21.882
(Audio from tower)

00:14:21.882 --> 00:14:24.465
(upbeat music)

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.830
- I never could dream of doing a landing

00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:53.700
into Paro, the world's
most challenging airport.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:54.533
I just want to know,

00:14:54.533 --> 00:14:57.030
is it only captains that can land
at this airport, I heard?

00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:59.090
- Yes, only captains are allowed here.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.923
- Only captains allowed.

00:14:59.923 --> 00:15:00.756
- Yes, captains are allowed,

00:15:00.756 --> 00:15:04.600
and it will take a minimum of at least,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.680
a minimum of eight to 10 years
to qualify for the captains.

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.550
- Eight to 10 years for first officers-

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.383
- Minimum.

00:15:10.383 --> 00:15:11.748
- to become a captain
to land at this airport.

00:15:11.748 --> 00:15:12.581
- Yes, that's minimum.

00:15:12.581 --> 00:15:14.500
- I heard also, like,
there's only like 15 captains

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.783
certified and qualified to land here.

00:15:15.783 --> 00:15:18.650
- Approximately, we have local pilots,

00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:20.701
about 15, approximately 15 local pilots.

00:15:20.701 --> 00:15:21.550
- Thrilling.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.160
It's thrilling, really thrilling.

00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.230
Until last minute, you turn
and you see the runway.

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.087
- [Cheng] Welcome to Bhutan.

00:15:27.087 --> 00:15:27.920
- [Sam] Amazing, thank
you, sir, thank you.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:28.753
- [Cheng] I'm sure more than landing,

00:15:28.753 --> 00:15:29.980
I'm sure you'll enjoy Bhutan, as well.

00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:31.900
- Thank you so much
for the cake, everyone.

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.390
It's so amazing and such an honour

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.693
to come to the beautiful
country of Bhutan.

00:15:36.693 --> 00:15:38.516
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:38.516 --> 00:15:40.127
(clapping)
- It's a beautiful cake.

00:15:40.127 --> 00:15:42.245
(speaking foreign language)

00:15:42.245 --> 00:15:44.995
(powerful music)

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:42.040
- I'm already doing plane spotting,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:43.360
10 minutes after landing.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.230
So this is the beautiful
Paro International Airport.

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:48.510
From this view point here, really high up,

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:50.410
you can see the whole terminal.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.650
Beautiful day, and you
can also see da tzong,

00:16:52.650 --> 00:16:55.610
which is like a palace museum of Paro,

00:16:55.610 --> 00:16:57.976
and then you can see the
mountains with snow cover.

00:16:57.976 --> 00:17:00.893
(plane taking off)

00:17:02.157 --> 00:17:07.157
(birds chirping)
(plane engine roaring)

00:17:27.858 --> 00:17:30.564
(whooshing)

00:17:30.564 --> 00:17:34.647
(ding)
(popping)
