00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:18.518
 If you want to buy cocaine with high quality and cheap price, 

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:21.379
 There is only one place to go. 

00:00:21.403 --> 00:00:24.882
 It is anonymous dark network markets. 

00:00:25.664 --> 00:00:27.288
 You can not access these sites 

00:00:27.312 --> 00:00:31.775
 Through a regular browser such as Chrome or Firefox 

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:34.932
 Because it's on this hidden side of the internet, 

00:00:34.956 --> 00:00:37.058
 Known as "hidden Tor services", 

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:41.775
 Where the links are a sterile series of numbers and letters ending in (onion) 

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:44.605
 You access it through a private browser 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.074
 It's called the Tor Browser. 

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:51.375
 Tor Browser was originally a US Naval Intelligence Project. 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.280
 Then it became an open source program, 

00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:55.891
 Anyone allowed to browse the Internet 

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:58.367
 Without showing his location. 

00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:02.489
 It does this by encrypting your IP address 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.295
 Then it directs it across many other computers around the world 

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:08.658
 Using the same program. 

00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:11.775
 You can use it for regular internet browsing, 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.514
 But it's also your key to the Dark Grid. 

00:01:16.438 --> 00:01:19.508
 Because of this highly intelligent coding system, 

00:01:19.532 --> 00:01:24.951
 Because the 20,000 or 30,000 sites that are run there - we don't know how many there are - 

00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:28.182
 Very difficult to close. 

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:34.095
 It is a world without censorship that anonymous users visit. 

00:01:35.268 --> 00:01:39.586
 It is not surprising, then, that it is a natural place to go 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.522
 Anyone with something that wants to hide it, 

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:46.137
 Of course, this thing is illegal. 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.638
 On the dark grid, you'll find 

00:01:48.662 --> 00:01:50.900
 Detectives of Corruption, The New Yorker, 

00:01:51.225 --> 00:01:53.711
 And you'll find blogs of political activity. 

00:01:53.735 --> 00:01:56.843
 You will find pirated book libraries. 

00:01:56.867 --> 00:02:00.490
 But you will also find drug markets, 

00:02:00.514 --> 00:02:04.619
 Illegal pornography, commercial hacking services, 

00:02:04.643 --> 00:02:06.240
 And many, many. 

00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:12.074
 So, the Dark Grid is one of the most exciting and exciting places 

00:02:12.098 --> 00:02:13.775
 Anywhere else on the internet. 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.475
 And the reason for this - with its innovation of course, 

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.775
 Is that they happen in big business, 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.198
 He spoke at the best universities of the world, 

00:02:22.222 --> 00:02:24.775
 He also spoke in marginalized groups, 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.342
 Because these people are marginalized, ostracized and expelled from their country 

00:02:29.366 --> 00:02:32.603
 They are often the most creative, because they have to. 

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.052
 On this side of the internet, 

00:02:36.076 --> 00:02:38.355
 You will not find one of the funny cat pictures, 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.560
 You will not find any popup ad anywhere. 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:43.862
 This is one of the reasons I see it 

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:47.575
 It will get many of you into the dark grid very soon. 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.599
 (Laughter) 

00:02:50.177 --> 00:02:53.469
 This does not mean that I suggest one of you to use the network 

00:02:53.493 --> 00:02:56.410
 To have access to excellent quality drugs. 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.390
 But let's say for a moment you would do it. 

00:02:58.414 --> 00:02:59.987
 (Laughter) 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.591
 Excuse me. 

00:03:02.868 --> 00:03:07.444
 The first thing that you will notice when registering at one of these sites 

00:03:07.468 --> 00:03:09.053
 It is very similar. 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.265
 So every product 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:15.153
 Thousands of products. 

00:03:15.177 --> 00:03:19.193
 It has a high-quality glossy image, 

00:03:19.217 --> 00:03:22.065
 A detailed description of the product and its price. 

00:03:22.414 --> 00:03:25.494
 And there is an icon "Scan the product" 

00:03:25.518 --> 00:03:28.276
 And the most beautiful of all this, there is even 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.458
 Report this product button. 

00:03:30.482 --> 00:03:33.189
 (Laughter) 

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:35.139
 just awesome! 

00:03:35.163 --> 00:03:37.550
 You sail through the site, make your choice, 

00:03:37.574 --> 00:03:39.993
 Bitcoin is paid in cryptocurrency, 

00:03:40.017 --> 00:03:43.046
 Enter an address - preferably not your home address - 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.775
 And waiting for the product to arrive in the mail, 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.662
 And always up. 

00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:53.139
 The reason for this is not due to smart coding. 

00:03:53.163 --> 00:03:54.328
 this is important. 

00:03:54.674 --> 00:03:58.003
 But it is much simpler than that. 

00:03:58.027 --> 00:03:59.252
 It is user evaluation. 

00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:01.259
 (Laughter) 

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:05.054
 You see, every seller in these sites 

00:04:05.078 --> 00:04:07.396
 Uses a pseudonym, this is very natural, 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.213
 But they continue to use the same nickname to build reputation. 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.910
 Because it is easy for the buyer to change his mind at any time 

00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:21.207
 It is the only way to trust the seller 

00:04:21.231 --> 00:04:24.869
 She is seeing if he has a good history of positive evaluation 

00:04:24.893 --> 00:04:26.483
 From other users of the site. 

00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:31.873
 The concept of competition and choice is this 

00:04:31.897 --> 00:04:36.166
 Do exactly what economists had predicted. 

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:42.032
 As prices decrease, product quality rises, 

00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:44.429
 Sellers are kind, 

00:04:44.453 --> 00:04:46.884
 Polite, and the consumer becomes their priority, 

00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:51.220
 They offer all kinds of specials, unique offers, 

00:04:51.244 --> 00:04:54.415
 Buy one get one free, free delivery, 

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.623
 All of this to make you happy 

00:04:56.953 --> 00:04:59.871
 I talked to Dragon Heaven. 

00:04:59.895 --> 00:05:05.785
 (Dragon Heaven) was showing excellent banjo and in good condition 

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:07.351
 At a reasonable price. 

00:05:08.154 --> 00:05:11.963
 He was working on a refund policy, 

00:05:11.987 --> 00:05:13.775
 Detailed terms and conditions, 

00:05:13.799 --> 00:05:15.211
 And suitable charging times. 

00:05:15.608 --> 00:05:17.869
 "Honorable Dragons Heaven" - that's what I wrote - 

00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:21.707
 Of course, the internal messaging system is also encrypted. 

00:05:22.397 --> 00:05:26.538
 "I'm new here. Do you mind if I buy just one gram of banjo?" 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.574
 Two hours later, I got a response. 

00:05:29.598 --> 00:05:30.784
 And they always respond. 

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.026
 Hello, thanks for your message. 

00:05:34.154 --> 00:05:39.422
 "Starting with a small dose is the mind's eye. I would have done the same if I were you." 

00:05:39.446 --> 00:05:41.208
 (Laughter) 

00:05:41.232 --> 00:05:44.353
 “So, it is okay if you only want to start with one gram.” 

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:46.888
 “I hope we do business together.” 

00:05:46.912 --> 00:05:48.775
 Best Regards, (Dragon Heaven). 

00:05:48.799 --> 00:05:50.775
 (Laughter) 

00:05:50.799 --> 00:05:54.063
 I don’t know if he speaks a fine English accent, but I assume he did. 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:00.775
 This type of attitude is keen on the consumer 

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:06.235
 Why is it that when I reviewed 120 thousand ratings 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:10.239
 From reviews that have been posted to one of these sites in more than three months, 

00:06:10.263 --> 00:06:13.392
 I found that 95% of these reviews got 5/5 

00:06:14.563 --> 00:06:17.104
 As you can see, the customer is the king. 

00:06:17.799 --> 00:06:19.009
 But what does this mean? 

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:20.974
 Well, on the one hand, 

00:06:20.998 --> 00:06:25.032
 This means that there are more drugs, more available and easier, 

00:06:25.056 --> 00:06:26.207
 To more people. 

00:06:26.799 --> 00:06:29.729
 In my opinion, this is not a good thing, 

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:34.512
 But on the other hand, if you intend to use drugs, 

00:06:34.536 --> 00:06:37.597
 You have a reasonable and appropriate way 

00:06:37.621 --> 00:06:42.035
 To ensure a certain level of purity and quality. 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:45.775
 This is important for drug users. 

00:06:45.799 --> 00:06:48.917
 You can do this while you are at home. 

00:06:48.941 --> 00:06:53.128
 Without the risk associated with street buying. 

00:06:53.961 --> 00:06:55.437
 As I said, 

00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:59.563
 You have to be creative and innovative to stay in this market. 

00:07:00.277 --> 00:07:03.371
 Twenty or more or less locations are currently running 

00:07:03.395 --> 00:07:07.100
 However, it doesn't always work, not always perfect, 

00:07:07.124 --> 00:07:09.726
 These sites I showed you were closed 18 months ago. 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:14.901
 But after she made more than a billion dollars worth of trade. 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.623
 But these markets, 

00:07:18.647 --> 00:07:21.709
 Due to the difficult conditions in which you work, 

00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:23.221
 These conditions are not appropriate. 

00:07:23.245 --> 00:07:26.593
 These markets are always innovative and thoughtful in ways to become more active 

00:07:26.617 --> 00:07:28.855
 Less centralized, more difficult to monitor, 

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:31.235
 More attractive to customers. 

00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:33.775
 Let's take a payment system 

00:07:34.383 --> 00:07:36.181
 You do not pay with your credit card, 

00:07:36.205 --> 00:07:38.550
 Of course this is up to you. 

00:07:38.574 --> 00:07:40.551
 But you use Bitcoin cryptocurrency, 

00:07:40.575 --> 00:07:45.030
 That are easy to exchange in real currencies 

00:07:45.054 --> 00:07:48.799
 It gives a high degree of anonymity to its users. 

00:07:49.367 --> 00:07:52.294
 But at the beginning of these sites, people noticed a defect. 

00:07:52.318 --> 00:07:56.383
 Some unscrupulous traders were fleeing people's coins 

00:07:56.407 --> 00:07:58.212
 Before sending drugs to them. 

00:07:59.155 --> 00:08:05.050
 The community has come up with a solution called multiple signature escrow payments. 

00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:10.628
 So when I buy something, 

00:08:10.652 --> 00:08:13.678
 I will send my Bitcoin coin 

00:08:13.702 --> 00:08:17.994
 To another safe and neutral digital wallet. 

00:08:18.799 --> 00:08:21.388
 It will become the seller - who will see that I sent the coin - 

00:08:21.412 --> 00:08:24.368
 Confident that they can send the product to me 

00:08:24.392 --> 00:08:25.775
 And when I receive it, 

00:08:25.799 --> 00:08:28.775
 It will have two out of three people involved in the deal 

00:08:28.799 --> 00:08:31.339
 They are the seller, buyer, and site manager 

00:08:31.363 --> 00:08:33.775
 They will have to sign the deal 

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:35.877
 With a unique digital signature, 

00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:37.876
 Then the amount will be transferred. 

00:08:38.263 --> 00:08:39.563
 Fabulous! 

00:08:39.587 --> 00:08:40.738
 Excellent! 

00:08:40.762 --> 00:08:41.913
 He's working. 

00:08:42.877 --> 00:08:45.528
 But then they realized that there was a problem with Bitcoin, 

00:08:45.552 --> 00:08:47.253
 Because every trade is made in bitcoin 

00:08:47.277 --> 00:08:49.775
 Register publicly in a public ledger. 

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:53.076
 So if you are skilled, you can try and find out who is behind them. 

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.385
 So they came to a flipping service. 

00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:59.800
 Hundreds of people send their Bitcoin coins to one address, 

00:08:59.824 --> 00:09:01.799
 Then they are flipped and scattered, 

00:09:01.823 --> 00:09:05.613
 Then the correct amount is sent to the correct recipient, 

00:09:05.637 --> 00:09:07.459
 But they are different bitcoins: 

00:09:07.483 --> 00:09:09.173
 Miniature washing systems. 

00:09:09.197 --> 00:09:10.731
 (Laughter) 

00:09:10.755 --> 00:09:11.911
 this is unbelievable. 

00:09:11.935 --> 00:09:17.128
 Interested in what drugs are currently heading in the dark network markets? 

00:09:17.152 --> 00:09:19.229
 Scan your search engine (Grams). 

00:09:19.253 --> 00:09:21.418
 You can even buy ad space. 

00:09:21.442 --> 00:09:23.507
 (Laughter) 

00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:28.469
 Are you a consumer who is ethical and concerned about what the drug industry does? 

00:09:29.064 --> 00:09:30.215
 Yes. 

00:09:30.592 --> 00:09:33.986
 A seller will offer you a fair trade for organic cocaine. 

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.152
 (Laughter) 

00:09:35.176 --> 00:09:38.471
 It is not from the Colombian drug king, 

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:39.924
 But the Guatemalan farms. 

00:09:39.948 --> 00:09:43.260
 They even promised to reinvest up to 20% of the profits 

00:09:43.284 --> 00:09:45.074
 In local educational programs. 

00:09:45.098 --> 00:09:46.120
 (Laughter) 

00:09:46.144 --> 00:09:48.123
 There is even a hidden shopper. 

00:09:48.936 --> 00:09:52.320
 Now, whatever you think about the ethics of these sites 

00:09:52.344 --> 00:09:55.659
 I acknowledge that it is not really an easy question 

00:09:55.683 --> 00:10:01.185
 Creating hidden competitive professional markets, 

00:10:01.209 --> 00:10:03.775
 Where no one knows who the other will be, 

00:10:03.799 --> 00:10:06.898
 And its constant confrontation with the danger of the authorities closing it 

00:10:06.922 --> 00:10:09.456
 It is an amazing achievement, 

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.518
 Unusual achievement. 

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:15.993
 And this kind of innovation 

00:10:16.017 --> 00:10:18.775
 It is the reason that these marginalized people 

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:21.646
 Often they predict the future. 

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.464
 Due to the short life of the internet, 

00:10:24.488 --> 00:10:26.550
 Easy to forget 

00:10:26.574 --> 00:10:29.991
 The Internet has changed many times 

00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.775
 During the past thirty or more years. 

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:34.775
 It started in the 1970s as a military project, 

00:10:34.799 --> 00:10:38.775
 In the 1980s, it turned into an academic network, 

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:41.261
 Then it was run by commercial companies in the 1990s, 

00:10:41.285 --> 00:10:44.740
 Then we invaded it all via social media in the early 2000s 

00:10:44.764 --> 00:10:46.693
 But I think it will change again. 

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:49.775
 And I think things like dark network markets 

00:10:49.799 --> 00:10:53.775
 Safe, hard to monitor 

00:10:53.799 --> 00:10:55.401
 I think it is the future. 

00:10:56.929 --> 00:10:58.557
 The reason is that it is the future 

00:10:58.581 --> 00:11:01.249
 It is that we all worry about our privacy. 

00:11:01.273 --> 00:11:04.498
 Surveys regularly show privacy concerns. 

00:11:04.522 --> 00:11:08.481
 The more time we spend on the Internet, the more we worry about our privacy. 

00:11:08.505 --> 00:11:10.775
 These studies show that our anxiety is increasing. 

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:12.915
 We worry about what happens to our data. 

00:11:12.939 --> 00:11:15.048
 We worry about who might be watching us. 

00:11:15.072 --> 00:11:17.640
 Since Edward Snowden leaks. 

00:11:17.664 --> 00:11:20.110
 There is a large increase in the number of people 

00:11:20.134 --> 00:11:23.226
 Users of various privacy enhancement tools. 

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:26.487
 There are now about two to three million users a day 

00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:27.786
 They use the Tor Browser, 

00:11:27.810 --> 00:11:32.977
 Most of its uses are completely legitimate. 

00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:34.760
 Sometimes simple. 

00:11:35.658 --> 00:11:38.809
 There are hundreds of activists around the world 

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:44.099
 They work on methods and tools that maintain your privacy on the Internet 

00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:47.592
 Like default encrypted messaging services. 

00:11:47.616 --> 00:11:51.639
 (Ethereum), a project that tries to link 

00:11:51.663 --> 00:11:56.741
 Connected hard drives not used by millions of computers around the world, 

00:11:56.765 --> 00:12:00.636
 To create a kind of distributed Internet that is not controlled by anyone. 

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:03.553
 Currently, we have pre-distributed computing of course. 

00:12:03.577 --> 00:12:07.775
 They are used for everything from Skype to the search for extraterrestrial life. 

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:12.288
 But you add distributed computing and robust encryption - 

00:12:12.312 --> 00:12:16.199
 Very difficult to monitor and control. 

00:12:16.625 --> 00:12:19.438
 And another one called (midsif), it works on the same basis. 

00:12:19.462 --> 00:12:22.910
 Another is called a twister, and so on. 

00:12:23.396 --> 00:12:25.386
 And this is the matter-- 

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:26.874
 Whenever many of us join, 

00:12:26.898 --> 00:12:29.349
 These sites have become more exciting, 

00:12:29.373 --> 00:12:31.861
 Then more of us will join, and so on. 

00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:34.293
 I think this is what will happen. 

00:12:34.317 --> 00:12:36.465
 In fact, it does happen. 

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:40.365
 The Dark Grille is no longer a den for merchants 

00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:42.956
 A refuge for those who reveal corruption 

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.667
 It is already moving in the mainstream. 

00:12:45.698 --> 00:12:52.272
 Recently, musician (Avex Twain) released his album as a Dark Web Site 

00:12:52.296 --> 00:12:56.249
 (Facebook) founded a dark network site. 

00:12:56.273 --> 00:12:59.906
 A group of London architects opened a dark web site. 

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:02.775
 For people who worry about renovation projects. 

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:05.372
 Yes, the dark web is moving in the mainstream, 

00:13:05.396 --> 00:13:09.013
 And I predict that very soon, social media companies will use, 

00:13:09.037 --> 00:13:10.472
 And every leading news outlet, 

00:13:10.496 --> 00:13:13.580
 And then most of this audience, 

00:13:13.604 --> 00:13:15.960
 The dark grid also. 

00:13:16.942 --> 00:13:19.971
 So the Internet is about to get more interesting, 

00:13:19.995 --> 00:13:22.775
 More exciting, more innovative, 

00:13:22.799 --> 00:13:24.524
 And more terrible 

00:13:24.548 --> 00:13:25.902
 And more destroyed. 

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.413
 And this is good news if you care about liberation. 

00:13:29.437 --> 00:13:31.407
 It is good news if you care about freedom. 

00:13:31.431 --> 00:13:33.550
 It is good news if you are interested in democracy. 

00:13:33.574 --> 00:13:34.952
 It is also good news 

00:13:34.976 --> 00:13:37.422
 If you want to browse illegal pornography 

00:13:37.446 --> 00:13:39.775
 And if you want to buy and sell drugs 

00:13:39.799 --> 00:13:41.092
 Without fear of punishment. 

00:13:41.876 --> 00:13:45.775
 Whether the Internet is completely dark or completely bright. 

00:13:45.799 --> 00:13:49.476
 It is not one side or the other that will work, but both. 

00:13:50.352 --> 00:13:52.240
 Thank you very much. 

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.950
 (clap)
