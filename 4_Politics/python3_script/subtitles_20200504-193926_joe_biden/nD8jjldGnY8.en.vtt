00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
If you've got a 250 mile range pack
you need four thousand cycles.

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.860
It's very achievable. We already do that 
with a stationary storage solutions like

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.080
PowerPack. We already deploy PowerPack 
with 4000 cycle life capability.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.600
Hey this is Warren Redlich. Let's talk
about Tesla's upcoming super battery!

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.849
Ultra super crazy awesome battery - 
Coming from Tesla really soon. Tesla is

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.440
developing batteries that are capable of
not only 1 million miles, but we may see

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.120
battery life up to 5 million miles. This
is a super long battery life. We are also

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.340
going to see batteries that charge from 20%
of charge up to 80% of charge in less

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.560
than five minutes. Super Fast Super
Charging. We're going to see increased

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.120
battery densities, up from the current
250 watt hours per kilogram in the Model 3

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.580
up to as high as 500 watt hours per
kilogram or more. The increased energy

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.700
density of the batteries mean either
lighter weight battery packs with the

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.250
same range, or similar weight battery
packs with much longer range. If Tesla

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.909
goes with lighter batteries with the
same range, that means Tesla will have

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.259
more batteries to be able to make more
cars. We're also going to see much faster,

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.189
super-fast production of batteries.
Battery production is going to increase

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.810
more than 50 percent a year. One of the
first things to understand is how Tesla

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.740
gets to 1 million miles in their battery
pack and this is actually believe it or

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.130
not easy. Currently it's common to see a
250-mile battery pack in a Tesla Model 3

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.460
or a Tesla Model Y. If you add to that,
that the battery is able to achieve

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.899
4000 cycles - 4000 cycles
meaning from zero battery charge to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.939
100% battery charge and back.
If Tesla is able to achieve

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.560
4000 battery cycles - which believe it
or not they're already accomplishing in

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.170
their research - this will happen. If you
get 4000 battery cycles with a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.850
250-mile pack, that's 1 million miles
4000 times 250 is 1 million

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.039
miles. But it doesn't stop there. The
Tesla Model S is already approaching

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.270
400 miles. A 400-mile battery pack.
They're at 390 now.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:23.750
If you do a 400-mile battery pack with
4000 cycles you get 1.6 million miles.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.580
1.6 million miles. Take it to the next
level up. The top-of-the-line Cyber Truck

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.120
model the 3 motor (tri-motor) Cyber Truck is
expected to have a 500 mile range. If you

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.840
do 4,000 cycles with a 500 mile range
that's 2 million miles of range.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.330
2 million miles of battery life on
that car. But we get more. The Roadster is

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.640
projected to have 600 miles of range. 600
miles with a 4,000 cycle battery pack is

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.040
2.4 million miles of battery life in the
Tesla Roadster. But it's going to get

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.830
better than that.
So there are two battery chemistry

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.250
developments that have happened fairly
recently that will take Tesla well

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.810
beyond 4000 cycles of battery life. In
the earlier days of lithium-ion

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.610
batteries for electric vehicles there
was a problem. If you use the battery

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.880
from zero - you drove the battery down to
0% and then you charge it up to 100%

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.360
You have this cycle where you're fully
draining the battery and fully charging

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:34.079
the battery. That process puts the most
stress on a lithium-ion battery.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.299
It stresses the battery materials badly and
the cycle life is worse. It turns out

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.640
with the earlier battery chemistries, if
you kept the car between the battery

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.190
between 40% to 60% - you
charged it up to 60% - you drove it down

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.989
to 40% and you charged it up to 60%,
that's when you got maximum battery

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.799
cycle life. The batteries would last a
long time because you weren't straining

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.299
the underlying materials inside the
battery. The problem is that only going

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.340
from 40 to 60% means you're only getting
20% of your range, so if you have a 200

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.420
let's say a 300 mile battery pack that
means you can only go 60 miles a day

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.979
before you recharge. And that doesn't - 
that's not what people are hoping for

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:22.770
with EVs. Temperature is also an issue - 
in the early days, and really the current

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.070
days of electric vehicles 
the temperature has

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.870
a big effect on how the battery life
lasts. When you have higher temperatures

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:35.950
the batteries don't last as long. Tesla
is very good about managing temperature

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.390
during life of the battery to keep that
battery life longer. "I mean we are super

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.430
deep on cell - Super Deep -  cell through
battery.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.080
That rabbit hole goes down pretty far. Man do we know a lot about batteries.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.580
We do have a decade - lots of

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.540
experience of not just like what a cell
should be but how to integrate into the

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.169
product and that's really helpful. Yeah
absolutely how to manage the cell,

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.310
module, battery and through different
weather conditions and different

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.720
environmental and different charge regimes and ... 
Wow we really know a lot about batteries!

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.340
There are new materials - new battery chemistries -
that are making this problem much less

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.710
important and going to extend battery
life. In research they start with pouch

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:25.750
cells that come typically from a factory
in China. That pouch cell has no

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.250
electrolyte additives in it. The
researchers add different electrolytes

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.419
and play around to see what gives them
more battery life - what allows the cells

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.650
to last longer. What prevents - what
different electrolytes limit the

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.229
problems created by battery chemistry
and charge cycles and storing at full limits.

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.720
What the research showed was that
choosing the right electrolyte additives

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.860
makes a massive massive difference in
how long those batteries will last.

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.090
How long they will retain capacity. How well
they will retain capacity over time

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.550
storing battery charge, and over cycle
life charging out discharging the

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.520
battery to zero and charging the battery
up to 100%. They still don't have a

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.160
great theoretical understanding of why
one electrolyte works and why another

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.479
electrolyte doesn't. What really makes
this all work.

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:19.479
They just keep trying different
materials to see what works and they

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.650
have some insights into - they see one
material working well. This other

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.979
material is similar in some ways. Let's
try this. And they're looking for

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:30.880
something called Coulombic inefficiency.
When you have more coulombic

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.960
inefficiency - inefficiency is bad - then
the battery doesn't last

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.130
long. The capacity fails quicker. In the
process of doing their research they

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.720
found some electrolyte additives that
made a huge difference. The important

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.050
thing to understand about the chemistry
research - because there's a lot going on

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.210
There's a lot of different chemistry
issues. Every battery has a cathode, an

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.970
anode, and electrolytes in the middle. And
there are different materials being

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.590
tried out, and this has been going on for
years now. Different materials being

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:06.580
tried out, both in the cathode, the anode
and in the electrolytes.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:13.080
"Although something is called Lithium-Ion, the actual
percentage of lithium in a lithium-ion cell

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.860
is approximately 2%. Our cells should be
called nickel - nickel graphite because

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.540
the primary constituent in the
cathode is - or the cell as a whole - is

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.840
nickel. On the anode side it's it's
graphite with silicon oxide and then

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.560
there's a little bit of lithium in
there, but it's kind of like the - it's

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.560
like the salt on the salad. Small
percentage of the mass. It's still

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.659
important to avoid supply constraints
and to make sure that the tail doesn't

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:42.340
like a dog on cost. Though the main
determinants of the cost of the cell are

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.300
the price of nickel in the form that we
need it and there's a little bit

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:53.860
of cobalt and some aluminum. And then the
cost of the synthetic graphite with the

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.270
silicon oxide coating." Some research is
pushing towards lithium iron phosphate

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:05.020
batteries for some uses. There's a lot of
push in nickel manganese cobalt both

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:11.020
nickel manganese cobalt 532 which is
50 percent nickel, 30% manganese, and

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:18.280
20 percent cobalt. There's now a shift to
NMC 811 which is 80 percent nickel,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.110
10 percent manganese and 10 percent cobalt.
That has two big benefits. One it reduces

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:28.870
the amount of cobalt. Reducing cobalt on
its own has big benefits because cobalt

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:35.529
is both expensive and troublesome. The
NMC 811 chemistry appears to have

00:08:35.529 --> 00:08:39.870
higher energy density which means
lighter batteries can hold more storage.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:43.839
They can hold more energy which
means the battery  - you'll have more range in a

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:48.070
car. The other issues relate to the
electrolyte additives.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:53.900
What's going on in the space between the
cathode and anode. Putting different

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:59.360
additives in the batteries makes a huge
difference. And a third thing is single

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:04.970
crystal materials in the electrodes. If
they use the normal materials that have

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:08.300
been used in electrodes that are not
single crystal, they're polycrystalline

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:13.220
materials. The different materials expand
and contract and in the process of doing

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.690
that it causes micro cracking and that
micro cracking dramatically reduces the

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:22.520
number of cycles that you can get out of
a battery. At the same time there's two

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:28.010
big issues that researchers have found
one is if you store a battery at full it

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:32.180
tends to lose compact capacity faster
but there have been some improvements in

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.160
cell chemistry's that allow batteries to
retain capacity longer even while

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.900
remaining full another big issue is the
charge discharge cycle as the battery

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:48.470
fills up and goes back down and as if
battery charges and discharges you're

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:52.760
filling the battery up with energy
you're discharging energy from the

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:59.090
battery to power the the wheels of the
car then the charge discharge cycles

00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:03.220
tend to cause a problem called micro
cracking particularly when you use

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:08.090
polycrystalline materials in the anodes
more recently researchers have found

00:10:08.090 --> 00:10:12.710
that single crystal materials that these
single crystal materials are expanding

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:17.270
and contracting they expand and contract
but they're not pushing against other

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:22.670
crystals nearby they're seated in carbon
black and it ends up dramatically

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:26.990
reducing the micro cracking so you get
more a lot more cycles and we're seeing

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:32.150
as much as eight thousand cycles with
minimal loss of battery capacity in some

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.510
applications I'd like to tell you that
researchers are going to come up with

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.840
one magic battery solution that's going
to be the perfect battery for every

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.990
situation
but I don't think that's the case and I

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.280
don't think it's important we're seeing
with with Tesla doing these new

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:51.860
batteries with C ATL yes they're lower
energy density but those batteries cycle

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:57.380
better they retain their capacity longer
even with substantial charge discharge

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:02.420
cycling so it makes sense that
different batteries would be used in

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.890
different circumstances for example the
batteries you might use for energy

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:12.589
storage to store energy from solar or
wind to backup the grid the types of

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:16.459
batteries you might use for that would
be different or could be different from

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:20.120
the batteries you would use in a
high-performance sports car and that

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.360
might be different from the batteries
you would use in a tractor-trailer in

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:27.050
the Tesla semi so I think we're going to
see different applications for different

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:31.519
uses just as an example the Tesla semi
you would expect that those are driving

00:11:31.519 --> 00:11:34.730
very long distances and they're
expensive and you want them to last for

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:40.880
a very long time you want them to be
able to go a lot of miles so the type of

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:47.720
battery that most supports a long
mileage a long life process would be

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.320
particularly good for Tesla semi
something like the lithium iron

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.209
phosphate batteries that Tesla is
working with CIT L in China on might be

00:11:56.209 --> 00:12:02.000
very very appropriate for Tesla semi at
the same time something that does a high

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:07.880
out a high fast charging and fast
discharging approach if you think about

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.740
something like the Tesla Roadster where
performance is everything then the goal

00:12:12.740 --> 00:12:18.770
of a long battery cycle life is not very
important sports cars aren't typically

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:23.450
driven for hundreds of thousands of
miles you would be happy to get getting

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.810
a half a million miles on a Tesla
Roadster would be fantastic

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:32.420
so it seems sensible that Tesla would
tweak the battery chemistry and approach

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:39.140
to handling the Tesla Roadster so that
it would have high discharge rates it

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:43.760
would be able to put a lot of power out
really fast to dramatically improve

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.079
performance same thing with the Model S
plat power train maybe the cyber truck

00:12:48.079 --> 00:12:52.910
tri-motor the goal here is to be able to
get very very high performance because

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:56.390
that's what people are paying for in a
performance model if you're going for a

00:12:56.390 --> 00:13:01.130
vehicle like the semi or perhaps like a
regular Tesla Model S or a model through

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:05.480
your model why you may be thinking you
know we're not shooting here for high

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:09.709
performance not that the performance
would be bad but that's not the primary

00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:13.510
goal a third thing that occurred to me
was with something like Tesla

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:18.040
which is gonna have a really large
number of batteries it would make sense

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.180
to have more than one charging port
rather than just charging in one spot

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.550
you could have let's say four separate
battery packs in the larger semi the

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:31.180
semi would be large enough they would be
able to hold it doesn't need the energy

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.870
density because it's so large so you
could use lithium iron phosphate and you

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:38.800
could have maybe four battery packs each
one of them charging separately which

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.250
would allow it to charge much quicker
because you're charging out of four

00:13:42.250 --> 00:13:46.360
ports in one recent research paper a
group of battery researchers were able

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:51.280
to achieve well over five thousand
cycles of charge discharge full

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.330
discharge discharge from zero percent
all the way to 100 percent obtaining

00:13:55.330 --> 00:14:01.900
over five thousand cycles with minimal
loss of battery capacity maybe 96 97

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:07.330
percent battery capacity remaining after
5300 cycles this is just amazing this is

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:12.580
fantastic results so at this point we're
out to well over a five thousand full 0

00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:18.670
to 100 charge/discharge cycles with well
over ninety percent battery capacity

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.930
retention at the end of the battery's
life you know after five thousand cycles

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:25.840
more than five thousand cycles so
putting the worst kind of strain on

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:29.560
these batteries in terms of both
temperature and charge discharge cycling

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.340
and storage capacity
you still get nearly three million

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:39.940
kilometres or one / 1.5 million miles of
battery life and that's on a 200-mile

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.920
battery pack and it lasts over 20 years
so now when you throw in improved

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.330
electrolyte additives and single crystal
materials we are talking about

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:55.150
approaching 8,000 cycles the battery
life will last 8,000 cycles this is huge

00:14:55.150 --> 00:15:00.160
this is massive this is amazing we
started out hoping for 4000 cycles we

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.330
are art we know we're already at 4000
cycles but down the road we're gonna get

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:08.230
to 8,000 cycles and eight thousand
cycles matters another huge development

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:12.870
in progress is improvements in energy
density the current generation of

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:18.880
battery technology gets to maybe 250
watt hours per kilogram in the Tesla

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:24.180
Model 3 or the Tesla Model Y but we're
about to see a revolution with a

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.629
substantial increase in energy
density a lot of people think the next

00:15:28.629 --> 00:15:32.110
level is going to be 330 watt hours per
kilogram I think we're gonna get there

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:36.069
very soon but not far down the road
maybe two or three years we're gonna hit

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:41.379
400 and then 500 watt hours per kilogram
so if you imagine the Tesla Model 3 that

00:15:41.379 --> 00:15:46.569
currently has a 300 let's say a 300 mile
battery pack just use a simple example

00:15:46.569 --> 00:15:51.999
if you take that 300 mile battery pack
and you say you know what we've got

00:15:51.999 --> 00:15:57.040
twice the energy density you can now
either take the same amount of battery

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:02.050
weight and get a 600 mile battery in a
Tesla Model 3 or you can say you know

00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:08.620
what we don't need to use as much
battery mass in the Tesla Model 3 you

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:14.529
cut the mass of the battery down from
the current weight you cut it in half

00:16:14.529 --> 00:16:18.240
and you're dramatically reducing the
weight that the Model 3 has to carry

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.600
while maintaining the same range so on
the one side you could say we're gonna

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.339
see a 600 mile + Model 3 and you could
look at the Tesla Model S and say we're

00:16:27.339 --> 00:16:34.180
gonna see an 800 mile Tesla Model S the
other side of it is we're able to make

00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:39.939
cars in a more battery efficient manner
that the design of the cars ultimately

00:16:39.939 --> 00:16:44.319
changes because you don't need as much
structure to hold the mass of a larger

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:49.360
battery pack and the battery pack ends
up being more efficient and you see a

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:55.149
Tesla Model 3 perhaps getting 350 or 400
miles of range with a battery pack that

00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:58.269
weighs half as much and you save
hundreds of pounds of weight on the car

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:02.470
if you really get into it getting 500
watt hours per kilogram may make it more

00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:06.880
possible to have electric airplanes but
Elon has been pretty clear that Tesla's

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:15.339
not going to go there with that it takes
a massive amount of effort to do any one

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:19.240
of these things you can't do it all
Tesla is going to make similar progress

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:24.010
on its battery materials pushing that
nickel cobalt aluminum there they've

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.500
definitely been clear they're gonna
reduce the amount of cobalt

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:29.710
they're gonna find ways to increase that
battery energy density to allow more

00:17:29.710 --> 00:17:34.450
lithium into the batteries and that will
increase the amount of charge it can

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:38.410
hold and we're gonna see them approach
they're already leading in

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:41.470
energy density they're gonna extend
their lead and they're gonna get there

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:45.220
they're gonna get to that 500 watt hours
per kilogram let's say Tesla's able to

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:49.300
use half the number of cells to make a
Model 3 that they're currently making

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.940
now let's leave aside everything else I
just say they're gonna make the same

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:55.810
Model 3 but they only have to use half
as many cells to get the same range that

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:59.830
means they have twice as many batteries
available which means they'll be able to

00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:05.230
make twice as many cars it gets better
than that because once you get to the

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:09.190
point where you realize we only need
half as many cells you can engineer the

00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:13.870
car differently you need less structure
to hold those batteries and it decreases

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:18.340
the weight of the vehicle so you
actually get more than more range with

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.160
half the batteries because you've
reduced the weight of the batteries and

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.680
you've reduced the weight of the
structure of the vehicle to hold those

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.060
batteries and so that means that you're
probably gonna see a Tesla Model 3 with

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:33.580
close to 400 miles of range with half
the battery cells and again that's gonna

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:37.360
allow Tesla to make twice as many cars
same thing with the model why this is

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.630
coming this is a couple years away two
three years away but this is coming

00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:44.620
what's always the biggest hurdle for
Tesla and any company that's trying to

00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.090
do is Tesla doing is production getting
the manufacturing down and then

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:53.110
increasing production getting more and
more batteries produced Tesla has been

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:56.950
limited by the number of batteries
produced they're not able to make any

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.250
more cars Elon said this at one point
that it doesn't matter whether they make

00:19:00.250 --> 00:19:03.670
cyber trucks or model wise or model
freeze if they don't produce more

00:19:03.670 --> 00:19:07.930
batteries they can't make more cars
overall the thing we're gonna be really

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:15.820
focused on is increasing battery
production capacity because the best

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:19.900
very fundamental because if you don't
improve battery production capacity then

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:24.310
you end up just shifting you to volume
for one part to another and you haven't

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.330
actually produced more electric vehicles
that's part of reason why we have not

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:32.380
for example really accelerated
production of that Tesla Semite because

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:38.110
it does use a lot of cells and unless
we've got a lot of battery cells

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.590
available accelerating production of the
test time I wouldn't necessarily be

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:47.020
making pure motor wiring so with the
acquisition of Maxwell technologies and

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:51.430
high bar and with all the work that the
tesla team is doing they are developing

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:54.640
ways
of making batteries themselves making

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.419
them faster making them better one of
the challenges when you manufacture

00:19:58.419 --> 00:20:02.799
batteries is some of the cells end up
not being good and you have to improve

00:20:02.799 --> 00:20:06.640
the quality of manufacturing so that you
have more good cells out of what you're

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.659
making but the biggest thing is just to
as everything Tesla does it's the

00:20:10.659 --> 00:20:14.860
machine that builds the machine the
traditional T and where the greatest

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.279
potential is is building the machine
that makes the machine

00:20:18.279 --> 00:20:21.429
you know it's building the factory and
really thinking of the factory like a

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:26.110
product you're going to try to create a
car by ordering a bunch of things on the

00:20:26.110 --> 00:20:32.380
catalog we designed the car the way it
should be and then we maple either we

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:37.419
with working with suppliers make all of
those individual components the same

00:20:37.419 --> 00:20:44.559
approach is the right approach to take
when building the machine maker that the

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:52.059
factory I actually think that the
potential for improvement in the machine

00:20:52.059 --> 00:20:58.750
that makes the machine is a factor of 10
greater than the potential on the car

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:05.590
side Tesla is going to improve the
manufacturing methods they're gonna

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:09.039
further automate they're just gonna make
it so that they can produce more

00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:13.720
batteries faster and by producing more
batteries faster they'll be able to

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.140
produce more cars and we will see more
Model threes we will see more model wise

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.970
we're seeing tracks cyber truck coming
soon and getting more batteries is

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.720
essential to being able to make the
Tesla semi which requires a lot of

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:32.370
batteries when you combine higher energy
density with longer battery life and

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:37.690
improved manufacturing volume what you
end up with is a lot of great options

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.740
for what you're gonna do going forward
what Tesla is going to do going forward

00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.500
one option is to say you know what we're
just gonna make really long-range

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.090
vehicles we're gonna turn the Tesla
Model S into an 800-mile vehicle that

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:53.260
will last for five million miles you
could end up with a Tesla Model S with

00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:58.659
an 800 mile battery pack that's able to
achieve eight thousand cycles which is

00:21:58.659 --> 00:22:03.309
six point four million miles now if you
asked me once you get beyond one or two

00:22:03.309 --> 00:22:07.030
million miles it becomes use
so the question is what else can you do

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:10.090
with these improvements in battery
chemistry what else can you do with this

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:14.020
improvement in battery life
well you can say you know what we don't

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.850
need to attain 5 or 6 million miles of
battery life we can increase the

00:22:18.850 --> 00:22:24.220
discharge rate which in a vehicle like
say the Tesla Roadster would allow the

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:29.320
Roadster to accelerate even quicker we
can increase the charge rate which

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.340
allows the batteries to charge much
quicker if you increase the charge rate

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:37.870
you may be able to get those batteries
charged from 20 to 80 percent in just

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:42.370
five minutes you may be able to do the
full zero to a hundred in five minutes

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:47.049
and now the biggest complaint that we
hear people make about electric vehicles

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:51.130
as oh it takes too long to charge well
that may not be the future it may be

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.460
that we're able to charge them much
quicker in the future and that choice

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:59.320
that choice of increasing the ability to
discharge energy quickly and to charge

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.340
quickly means the battery life won't be
as long but if you're starting with an

00:23:03.340 --> 00:23:07.929
eight with a with an eight thousand
cycle life and you put these limits on

00:23:07.929 --> 00:23:11.890
it and you only get to a four thousand
cycle life but you have a 600 mile

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:17.110
battery pack you're still getting 2.4
million miles of life on a Tesla

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:21.640
Roadster with a 600 mile battery pack
you can see a Tesla Model 3 with 700

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:27.640
miles of range or you could see a Tesla
Model 3 with 350 miles of range but much

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:33.039
less cost to manufacture and a lot more
of them you could take the higher energy

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:37.600
density battery pack and allow the Model
3 to have a higher charge rate and a

00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:42.340
higher discharge rate and then what you
would see is that yes instead of getting

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:46.090
you have your 700 mile battery pack that
could conceivably go out eight thousand

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:51.130
cycles or five million miles we're gonna
compromise that battery life to improve

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:56.289
performance and to improve charge speed
so you're able to charge that Tesla

00:23:56.289 --> 00:24:01.000
Model 3 battery pack in five minutes or
so you're able to go from zero to 60 in

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.950
three seconds personally I don't think
performance is going to be a critical

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:11.230
feature in the future of EVs
I think in the future of EVs we're

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:15.159
talking about Robo taxis and I think the
most exciting thing is when we're

00:24:15.159 --> 00:24:17.950
heading towards the future I'm gonna
make a video about this down the road

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:22.300
about the future of single passenger
lightweight pod cars they might have a

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:27.490
25 a 20 or 25 kilowatt hour battery pack
but they're very lightweight so that

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:30.940
carries you a long way they're
lightweight because it's basically just

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:36.040
the skate and a arguably just recyclable
plastic shell because they never get the

00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:39.550
crashes it would be able to charge
extremely fast to be very small they

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:43.390
take up less space on the road maybe
hyper-efficient you might have a city

00:24:43.390 --> 00:24:47.440
car that's optimized for city driving
you might have a highway version a

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.860
long-distance version that's optimized
for long-distance travel where it's

00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:56.260
lower more aerodynamic and it's geared
for higher speeds so altogether we have

00:24:56.260 --> 00:25:00.700
a very exciting future with Tesla's new
battery technology we're going to learn

00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:04.480
a lot more about this on battery day on
April assuming battery day goes ahead I

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:11.860
think the the current pan panic in the
United States over infectious disease

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.950
has changed how people are thinking
about things so maybe we're not going to

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:18.790
see it as quickly as we'd like but as
far as we can see Tesla is going

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:23.770
full-bore ahead with its research and
development of these technologies and we

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.910
are going to hear fairly soon about a
gigafactory

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:33.070
producing tesla batteries my prediction
is that at some point with the success

00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.550
of the model why tesla decides they
don't need to produce the Model X

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:41.890
anymore and they use the space currently
taken up in Fremont for building Model X

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.520
they use that space for battery
production it could be that they use

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:48.970
that space for something else and that
can produce batteries somewhere else you

00:25:48.970 --> 00:25:52.840
can see with Giga Shanghai how
efficiently they've laid out the

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:58.930
manufacturing space to improve the
process to lower the cost of

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.320
manufacturing and improve the speed of
manufacturing we're gonna see something

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.400
very similar with Tesla's battery
production coming very soon one of the

00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:10.420
most important things that Elon has
stated as a goal and is very clearly a

00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:16.810
goal is reducing the cost per kilowatt
hour of these battery packs continue to

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.630
improve the cost per kilowatt hour of
the batteries

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:25.309
because a very fundamental and extremely
difficult it's actually one of the big

00:26:25.309 --> 00:26:30.740
advantages of the lithium iron phosphate
battery chemistry is it doesn't involve

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:36.890
cobalt it does have higher weight or
lower energy density in the battery pack

00:26:36.890 --> 00:26:42.170
but it doesn't involve cobalt which
makes it a lot less expensive so there's

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:47.090
a few things that Tesla is going to do
to dramatically reduce the cost per

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:52.090
kilowatt hour one is just producing a
higher volume you get economies of scale

00:26:52.090 --> 00:26:58.220
to is tweaking chemistry so the NMC
eight one one uses a lower proportion of

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:02.150
cobalt so for applications where they're
going to be using the nickel manganese

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:07.640
cobalt eighty percent ten percent ten
percent formulation the cost of cobalt

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.770
goes down and that makes the cost of
batteries less expensive on top of that

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.760
we have technologies we don't really
know a lot about from high bar and

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:22.429
maxwell that may further reduce the cost
per kilowatt hour right now Tesla's

00:27:22.429 --> 00:27:26.900
approaching 100 dollars a kilowatt hour
coming the cost of battery technology is

00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:31.400
coming down close to a hundred dollars
per kilowatt hour it seems reasonable

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:36.530
that we will see Tesla get down to maybe
eighty dollars a kilowatt hour but again

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:40.309
with the different types of batteries
that Tesla may be using I think we're

00:27:40.309 --> 00:27:45.740
gonna see different applications so the
lithium iron phosphate appears to be the

00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:53.120
least expensive format I think we'll be
seeing a lot of a lot of the shorter

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.740
range vehicles will start using lithium
iron phosphate this is I'm not saying I

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:02.210
know I'm just saying this is what I
think makes sense is Tesla wants to

00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:05.600
produce vehicles in volume so it's
important to produce more and more

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:09.500
batteries see ATL is clearly going to
increase their output at some point

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.910
Tesla is going to be making their own
batteries they already have lines using

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:19.429
certain chemistry's particularly nickel
cobalt aluminum so it's unlikely that

00:28:19.429 --> 00:28:23.540
Tesla will stop any of their existing
lines they've already expressed that

00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:27.020
they think it's important to continue
producing lines that are efficient and

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:34.210
effective fifteen lines you know
for a long time and in a world where

00:28:34.210 --> 00:28:40.390
self supply is fueling growth like all
part of the field of growth I don't see

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:44.530
a reason to turn that sells fly off I
think we're gonna see Tesla adding new

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:49.690
lines of battery production in different
places they may rely on C ATL and China

00:28:49.690 --> 00:28:53.650
to produce lithium iron phosphate it's
likely that they will find another place

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:56.710
to produce batteries my own prediction
and this is kind of an out-there

00:28:56.710 --> 00:29:01.360
prediction is that Tesla will stop
producing the Model X that the model of

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:06.220
Y will basically replace the Model X the
Model X is expensive to produce it's

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:10.420
difficult to produce and it takes up a
lot of space in a factory then that

00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.720
space can be used for producing
something else now whether it's used to

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:17.590
produce batteries or something else I
don't know Elon is clearly talking about

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:21.550
opening more Giga factories in different
places and an important part of that

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:26.220
will be producing more batteries so it's
likely that we are going to see a

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:29.710
variety of batteries that Tesla's going
to use the other thing I should mention

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:37.840
is when some batteries run out of
usefulness in the cars it makes a lot of

00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:44.140
sense to continue using those batteries
for grid storage that the demands of

00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:48.700
grid storage are less than the demands
of vehicles and it's likely that Tesla

00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.120
will find a way to take a batteries out
of a vehicle let's lay the batteries

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:56.290
down to 90 percent capacity and that
vehicles driven a lot of miles and is no

00:29:56.290 --> 00:30:00.100
longer is maybe somewhat obsolete
compared to whatever is new at that time

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:05.650
as part of recycling the materials in
that vehicle you take the batteries out

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:10.030
and you can apply them in grid storage
it might not be part of power pack or

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:14.200
mega pack it might be some future
product that Tesla puts out that uses

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:20.590
the recycled battery material uses those
recycled batteries to create a grid

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.740
storage product that cost less because
you're using batteries that have already

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:27.250
been paid for it I'm very excited about
the future with Tesla I know we're going

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:31.030
through a difficult time now but we're
gonna come through it test is gonna come

00:30:31.030 --> 00:30:35.080
through at Tesla as a great cash cushion
thanks to that capital raise we are

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:40.660
going to see Tesla taking the lead in
the automotive industry making it

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:48.190
particularly with battery technology
with self-driving technology Tesla is

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:52.419
taking lead in so many ways over-the-air
updates etc we are going to see

00:30:52.419 --> 00:30:58.330
tremendous improvements in automotive
transportation in America and the world

00:30:58.330 --> 00:31:02.139
let's stay excited about it let's look
forward to the future thank you very

00:31:02.139 --> 00:31:05.860
much for watching if you like what
you've seen here please subscribe please

00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:10.240
let us let me know what you think in the
comments and I want to stress very soon

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:14.860
I'm gonna do a new video about pod cars
I think this is the biggest thing going

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:18.820
forward in the future is we're gonna see
a future of these one passenger maybe

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:24.789
two passenger cars people do prefer to
drive in their cars mostly adults I mean

00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:30.129
the average number occupants in a car I
think is like 1.2 and maybe with us Hana

00:31:30.129 --> 00:31:36.999
me maybe look at 1.4 maybe that's even
goes there that are much more

00:31:36.999 --> 00:31:41.529
lightweight much more efficient I'm very
excited about that future stay tuned

00:31:41.529 --> 00:31:45.669
it's gonna be amazing you know again I
know we're in difficult times when I'm

00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:50.049
making this video but our future is very
bright I'm always optimistic about the

00:31:50.049 --> 00:31:53.740
future and I want us to all stay
optimistic yeah we've got we're hitting

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.429
a bump in the road right now but Tesla's
gonna plow through it SpaceX is gonna

00:31:57.429 --> 00:32:00.279
plow through it and we're gonna plow
through it and our future is gonna be

00:32:00.279 --> 00:32:04.200
fantastic thanks for watching
