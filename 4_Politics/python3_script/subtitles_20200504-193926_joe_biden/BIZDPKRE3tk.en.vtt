get inside a boat and it was locked you
could<00:08:34.940><c> just</c><00:08:35.089><c> use</c><00:08:35.210><c> a</c><00:08:35.240><c> crowbar</c><00:08:35.539><c> to</c><00:08:35.750><c> open</c><00:08:36.320><c> this</c><00:08:36.409><c> up</c>

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:36.589 align:start position:0%
could just use a crowbar to open this up
 

00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:38.260 align:start position:0%
could just use a crowbar to open this up
or<00:08:36.919><c> smash</c><00:08:37.370><c> it</c><00:08:37.550><c> from</c><00:08:37.760><c> the</c><00:08:37.849><c> top</c>

or smash it from the top
 

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.899 align:start position:0%
or smash it from the top
so<00:08:38.450><c> it's</c><00:08:39.289><c> more</c><00:08:39.860><c> of</c><00:08:39.950><c> a</c><00:08:40.070><c> deterrent</c><00:08:40.430><c> than</c>

00:08:40.899 --> 00:08:40.909 align:start position:0%
so it's more of a deterrent than
