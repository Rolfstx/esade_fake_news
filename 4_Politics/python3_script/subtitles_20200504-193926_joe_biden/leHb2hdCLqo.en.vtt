00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.400
 Just when i arrived 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.880
 At Geneva airport 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.520
 I realize this is over. 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.460
 It's hard over there 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.560
 Physically but mainly psychologically 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.440
 If i had to do it again 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.440
 it is good... 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.000
 I don't think I will. 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.180
 In September 2008 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.660
 I left Switzerland, very comfortable 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.580
 Spend 10 months alone in Tonga Islands 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.940
 In the central pacific 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.600
 For life, I brought 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.320
 A machete and my swiss knife 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.000
 I also have a medicine bag 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.080
 Satellite phones, solar panels and batteries 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.820
 Power my camera. 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.860
 The dream i want to achieve 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.780
 I have been working for this for 14 months 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.020
 Now, now I am here 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.660
 But I think the most important thing is 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.820
 Keep zen 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.900
 keep cool 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.820
 Because no matter what happens, I will be alone 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.680
 Tonga islands got lost 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.680
 In the central pacific 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.340
 About 250 km from Tofua Island 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.180
 From the capital and its last resident 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.420
 Left about 20 years ago 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.160
 Tofu is a caldera, 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.460
 A once exploding volcano 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.400
 There is a sulfuric acid lake in the middle 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.720
 In the north of the island 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.580
 You can see the smoke 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.580
 From still active volcanoes 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.760
 I'm only 24 hours here 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.180
 I miss food i miss drinks 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.300
 water 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.720
 I miss everything 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.340
 This is too bad 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.000
 No, this is not terrible, but 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.540
 It tells me 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.540
 You can't do it for the first time 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:36.700
 You have to go step by step 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.440
 I have to learn 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.880
 And it took much more time than I expected. 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.080
 The next day, I installed solar panels 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.060
 Charge my battery 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.300
 Then I went fishing 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.100
 At sunset 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.160
 I still didn't catch anything. 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.080
 But like i'm giving up 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.940
 I hit the first fish. 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.220
 the most important is 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.740
 It's enough to feed me 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.980
 In the next two days 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.960
 I feel good, I feel much better this morning 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.660
 Because i can get a fish 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.160
 I can eat it, there is still time tomorrow 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.480
 Then I am very happy 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.600
 I will burn the fire again 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.940
 Five minutes ten minutes and then I sleep 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.560
 because 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.640
 I don't want to waste wood 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.620
 There are many, but... 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.920
 It does not work. 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.840
 All the wood is wet 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.380
 Hello 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.220
 Ants everywhere 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.420
 I can't even eat anymore. 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.460
 Oh yes, I'm sure, 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.880
 They got everything 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.960
 There are not many friends on the island. 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:59.620
 I must find a way to protect my fishing. 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.500
 At home in the Alps 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.600
 Elders use two methods 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.840
 Preserved meat 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:06.660
 Marinated and smoked. 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.040
 Okay, the goal is to make a difference 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.960
 Fish 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:12.340
 Because I hope there are many fish 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.980
 Not many fish 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.540
 I want to smoke 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.460
 It doesnâ€™t take much time to build a smoke house 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.780
 It works very well 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.660
 My grandfather will be proud of me 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.560
 In the first two days I tried to sleep 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.920
 Use the curved trunk of a coconut tree 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.300
 But I won't spend ten months like that. 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.760
 I had to build a shelter for myself. 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.780
 I start from the roof. 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.700
 Latex works, coconut eyelashes, 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.020
 New or dry 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.320
 Usual lock 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.500
 Or unusual 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.240
 Roof with coconut branches 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.100
 I played through paneling 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.300
 Hope this won't let water pass 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.080
 Four days later, my shelter was built 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.640
 And I can move on. 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.240
 I still have to complete an important ceremony 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.480
 To live under the laws of nature. 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.620
 I have to stop time 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.160
 The thing is, I should find a good place to watch 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.180
 Not too far from the ocean 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.500
 So even underground 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.600
 It can get a good atmosphere from the sea 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.280
 Yes 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:36.440
 very beautiful 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.940
 So from now on i will be here 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.120
 About nine months and twenty days 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.100
 The time I stopped alone 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.720
 At the beginning, fishing spent most of my time. 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:03.740
 I am not catching fish every day 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.380
 I spent a long time 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.640
 Wait for them to bite 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.080
 I imagine there is a system that can get rid of the tedious work 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.060
 The principle is very simple 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.400
 A heavy branch like a fishing rod 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.560
 A heavy stone as a counterweight 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.360
 Fishing line and bait 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.780
 Then it succeeded. 

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.260
 OK, I'm exhausted 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.800
 It seems easy, I know what to do, but 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.400
 I don't eat too much now 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.880
 Because i have no choice 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.720
 My drink is ok, but 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.740
 Every time I have to work hard 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.020
 I get tired easily 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.140
 Now i want to rest 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.940
 I'm not worried anyway 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.000
 When you are hungry, you are less picky 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.520
 I found some snails 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.500
 Ok, only a few of them 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:54.000
 Superstars are not enough. 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.040
 Okay, good appetite 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.040
 Lack of food 

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.040
 Sudden loneliness 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:01.860
 No reference point 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.100
 I don't know what is most important to me 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.760
 But eight days later 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:06.980
 I cracked 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.220
 My family miss me 

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.620
 Everything I know is actually missing me. 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.120
 Very good, but I... 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.780
 I can not find 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.780
 I have no food 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.940
 I have water, but itâ€™s difficult, itâ€™s difficult 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.700
 with... 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.760
 In my house, I have everything, and then I say 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.560
 Why, why do you do this? 

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:43.559
 You can, you can, you can stay at home, cool 

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.820
 With your friends, girlfriends 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:48.300
 family 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.780
 Just hit me without warning 

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.640
 I'm in the dump 

00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.600
 22,000 km from home 

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.000
 Away from my friends, my family my refrigerator 

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:06.640
 The worst part is that this is my idea. 

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.340
 Fortunately I have a motivated sign 

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.640
 My friend wrote my message on it 

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.700
 Reading them gave me the courage to move on 

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.020
 the most important is 

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:18.240
 That day was the first time I saw a whale 

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.580
 When you see this 

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:22.880
 I can tell you that you have forgotten all the questions. 

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.220
 I miss many things here, 

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.700
 I have a lot of things here 

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.260
 I can't go home 

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.080
 But it's hard in the morning 

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:38.900
 Remember this 

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:40.600
 But at night 

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.720
 I feel this feeling again, I feel very happy 

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.820
 I am quiet 

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:48.960
 I think what I want to learn is to walk slowly now 

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:50.160
 I must learn... 

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:52.380
 Take time to do everything 

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:55.640
 Everything I still want to do here is fast 

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.120
 Make it finish as soon as possible 

00:08:58.760 --> 00:08:59.920
 This is not the way. 

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:06.860
 I have to put this, this plastic 

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.860
 This is the protection of my solar panel 

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.120
 Because i realized 

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.340
 My roof is not waterproof at all 

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:13.680
 with 

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:16.580
 I really need a waterproof roof 

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.160
 For all the materials I have, 

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.620
 That's why i put this 

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.160
 I will start today 

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.380
 Work with coconut sleeves 

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.380
 Make a waterproof roof. 

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:29.860
 The first step is 

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.680
 Reaching the top of the coconut tree 

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.980
 But it seems easy if you climb the tree 

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.900
 Reaching the palm of the tree 

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.160
 Such a smooth suitcase 

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.860
 It's another fish. 

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.600
 Complete this exploit 

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.820
 I peeled off the palm tree 

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.320
 I chose them because of their length 

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.020
 It matches very well with one of my roofs. 

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:51.920
 Then weave 

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:53.860
 The method is very simple 

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.040
 More than once, less than once 

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.320
 More than once, less than once 

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.800
 In Tonga Islands, the roof of the shelter 

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.100
 Covered by layered lattice work 

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.600
 Make them waterproof. 

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:18.080
 Obviously some of them are needed anyway 

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.660
 Another major problem I encountered was mosquitoes 

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:24.680
 There are thousands of people in that forest 

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.380
 So the best way to keep them away from my camp 

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.320
 Is to clean around the shelter 

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.120
 And open up space 

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.700
 So the wind from the ocean 

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.360
 Can create natural protection 

00:10:34.220 --> 00:10:35.200
 But this is useless. 

00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.360
 From this morning, I heard the sound of the volcano 

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:44.640
 I don't know what happened 

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.160
 I'm a little worried 

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.320
 Because we never know 

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:49.980
 That's why i 

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.620
 I came to the top 

00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:54.840
 I must find a way 

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.820
 I came to the top of the mountain to see the volcano 

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:02.540
 The road to the volcano is not a piece of cake 

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:03.860
 Especially here 

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.860
 Through the jungle 

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:08.280
 But once it reaches the side of the crater 

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.360
 Sight makes you forget about hard work. 

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.640
 very beautiful 

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.320
 At this moment you really feel humble 

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:31.880
 It makes me cry 

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.060
 Indeed, sometimes I feel lonely 

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:40.600
 The only constant is me 

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.540
 At the beginning 

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:45.780
 But i stayed for a month 

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.760
 Indeed, I almost missed everything 

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.280
 I'm in the middle of nature 

00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.940
 But in the middle of nowhere 

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:54.660
 I'm alone 

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.260
 I am really lonely, it is not easy. 

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:06.440
 After my first trip to the volcano 

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.360
 I decided to extend every day 

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.160
 The known circumference is more than a few hundred meters 

00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.420
 I always look around 

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.640
 There is always something to discover 

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.180
 forever and ever 

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.140
 Today is a mango tree 

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.100
 Huge, bent due to too much fruit 

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:38.960
 Looking for those almost ripe fruits 

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.440
 It feels like getting a Christmas present 

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.840
 To strengthen my roof, 

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.060
 I need some rope 

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:52.280
 On Tofua, there is a rope tree. 

00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:54.140
 I just need to find it 

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.580
 Oh no, it's not very strong, is it? 

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.200
 This is completely rotten 

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.420
 After several attempts, 

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.680
 I finally found what I wanted 

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:07.500
 ee 

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:10.840
 I just need to cut some long belts from the minstrel 

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:12.700
 Let them dry in the sun 

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.200
 I finished the roof on one side today 

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.840
 We certainly have to see if it is waterproof, but 

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.620
 At least i got nothing 

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.740
 And coconut sleeves 

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.960
 I am proud of this 

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:37.840
 You know life here 

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.920
 It's very simple, but not so easy... 

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.740
 Everything you do 

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.540
 I have learnt a lot 

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:54.400
 It gives me a new understanding of the world 

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.420
 Because fishing does not bring me food every day 

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:00.620
 I added new dishes to my diet 

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.040
 Small coconut bud 

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.140
 Cook with charcoal 

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:07.360
 Wear ashes and bran. 

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:12.220
 Coconuts are easy to cut. 

00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.840
 It looks like a fruit plate 

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.320
 It's hard to describe the taste 

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.920
 Soft 

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:21.320
 a bit sweet 

00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.960
 But no cocoa 

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:24.240
 A warm 

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.240
 This is awesome 

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.160
 Spent more than a month on the island 

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.240
 I can survive and organize the necessities 

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.500
 Only one question left 

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.920
 Lack of interpersonal communication 

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.680
 I realize now 

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.040
 I started to feel lonely 

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:48.820
 Because i have nothing to say 

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.260
 I have no one to change my opinion 

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.460
 Then I said to myself 

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.760
 But I always agree with me 

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:58.040
 That's not fun 

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.880
 No one can give me more information 

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:05.920
 About what i already know 

00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.720
 No matter what I do, I am alone 

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:13.500
 I can't say it by myself 

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.940
 You know 

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.400
 No i think i'm enough 

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:24.300
 I'm bored now 

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:26.740
 Alone, alone and bored. 

00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:41.400
 I found a good place there 

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:44.320
 But it is difficult to enter from the beach 

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.840
 Because all the stones 

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.440
 Maybe I can find the easiest way 

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:51.500
 Walk from inside 

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:53.380
 yeeeesss 

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.840
 Sitting on that beach 

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.120
 I considered the vastness of the sea 

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.040
 Taste my victory 

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:25.840
 But look around me 

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.200
 I found myself 

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:29.740
 Facing the worst moment of our civilization 

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:35.500
 So much garbage 

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.360
 Throw into the sea 

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.520
 Thousands of kilometers from here 

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.960
 Take away by water 

00:16:42.180 --> 00:16:43.440
 Finally along the coast. 

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.860
 I even found a little bamboo. 

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.400
 I can use it for... 

00:16:52.980 --> 00:16:54.720
 I decided to take it back to the camp 

00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.220
 Until it finds use 

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.020
 But I already have an idea 

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.660
 Now, in theory, I have... 

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.380
 I have a digeridoo 

00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.140
 If you forget the mosquito 

00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.560
 Life on Tofua seems mellow 

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.880
 But when fishing every day 

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:37.860
 I risk hurting myself 

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.020
 Walking on the rock. 

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:40.840
 I often scrub myself 

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:42.740
 When I was exploring the forest 

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.880
 I eventually got infected under the skin 

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.380
 No longer healed. 

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.000
 I have to use a satellite phone 

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
 Call Dr. Rich in Switzerland 

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.980
 He did follow-up work from there. 

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.000
 Yes, Jack, this is Xavier Rosset's call 

00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:58.740
 Spiritually, I am fine 

00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:00.720
 I can almost do what I want 

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.660
 But in fact 

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.660
 I have a small technical problem 

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.420
 I need you too 

00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.420
 I introduced him to what it looked like 

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.720
 He told me what to use from the medical kit 

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.120
 He helped me get together in Switzerland 

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:14.880
 Now i go, i go 

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.040
 I really donâ€™t want to do it because 

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.480
 Already hurt 

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.920
 Maybe it will be better in the future. 

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.440
 Dirt appears every day 

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.320
 I have to wash the sea water every day 

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.320
 When I boil the water 

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.520
 Flat water, I have to wash it with ordinary water again 

00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:34.420
 I have to release betadine 

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:35.980
 This is special cream 

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:38.220
 I am in the middle of nowhere 

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.000
 And I am taking antibiotics! ! ! 

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.720
 Within five days, if the situation is not good 

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
 I must call the doctor 

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:53.900
 Thanks to my doctor's advice 

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.700
 I am taking special care of the wound 

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:57.920
 They healed within a few days 

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.500
 But even if I am busy every day 

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:04.880
 I started to suffer another problem 

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:06.940
 The medicine cannot be cured. 

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.260
 I am not motivated to do anything now 

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:13.760
 because 

00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:15.480
 I am alone 

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.920
 I didn't even try to make fire 

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:19.940
 Use the wood you know 

00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:22.460
 because... 

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.240
 Because i'm fed up 

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:32.560
 I have nothing 

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.320
 I donâ€™t know why and why 

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.140
 I am alone, I should 

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:40.480
 Share with 

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:41.760
 nobody 

00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:44.460
 nobody. 

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.420
 I came because of me 

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.160
 Need some help 

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.820
 For my friends in the village 

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.820
 Cut his finger 

00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:56.980
 like this 

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:00.020
 Break the river 

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:01.620
 Also break his finger 

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.840
 Just like he heard my voice 

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.520
 Lofi appeared in my life. 

00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.500
 A few days a year 

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.120
 Farmers on neighboring islands 

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:11.120
 Come tofu planting Sichuan 

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.900
 A plant whose root is used to produce bitter drinks 

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.740
 Luffy is one of them 

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:18.220
 He more or less knows where my camp is 

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.220
 He came to me 

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.340
 Hope i can save his friend's finger 

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.900
 But their camp is more than six hours away from us 

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.020
 Row 

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.540
 Now and on the way back 

00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.280
 My friend Love's Village 

00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:36.960
 Because one of his friends has a big cut and finger 

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.960
 Fingers stick out 

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.720
 possible 

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:42.960
 What can i do 

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.080
 I will try my best 

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.140
 But if the infection has already started 

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.600
 It's too late. 

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.760
 The best way to observe is to take a look. 

00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:57.860
 Lofi likes to follow me 

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:00.220
 So he can adapt to my speed 

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.220
 Instead of looking at his shoulder 

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.480
 Avoid losing me 

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.760
 Very sweet eh? 

00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:07.860
 In the middle? Very very sweet. 

00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:13.980
 It's so good 

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.840
 Once we reach the camp 

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.280
 I can quickly measure the severity of the case 

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.440
 are you alright? 

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:24.340
 Malo Ariel 

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.860
 I cannot manage first aid 

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:28.120
 But i know he will have to 

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.680
 Go to the medical center 

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:32.240
 As long as there is a boat to pick him up 

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.860
 During this time, I tried my best 

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:37.000
 With a medicine chest and my little knowledge 

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:41.300
 Ok i think i've done my best with your friends 

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.220
 I can do it until tomorrow, but it will be better 

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.620
 He went to the hospital. 

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:48.720
 Okay thank you 

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.460
 Iâ€™m Tofuaâ€™s doctor, but 

00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:52.880
 I tried my best. 

00:21:56.980 --> 00:22:00.780
 Chimy's fingers are much better now 

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:03.600
 For me, it's time 

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.340
 Back to Hokula 

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.420
 I arrive at my house in Hokula 

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:12.720
 Yes 

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.580
 Leaving these people makes me very strange 

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.500
 Every good person comes back alone 

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.680
 In my place i don't know 

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:29.280
 But now itâ€™s time to go, Iâ€™m on the way 

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.360
 Very warm day 

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.440
 You are not always alone 

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:38.220
 Even if you are looking for it. 

00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.020
 About sailing 

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.520
 As if it were close to Hokula 

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:45.900
 For me, this may be an extraordinary visit 

00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:47.960
 I really look forward to seeing them 

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:52.120
 The same boat brought a group of Norwegians 

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:53.360
 They finished two months 

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.080
 Sail in Archipelago. 

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:58.020
 I wasn't in the camera 

00:22:58.420 --> 00:22:59.780
 No, it's a visitor 

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.980
 What do you think of the house? 

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:05.700
 Did you see it 

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:09.740
 Not many luxury goods 

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:14.200
 I guess it's really good for you, for the next... 

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.380
 Half a year or one year 

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.080
 You have a bed 

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.380
 Where you hide in the rain 

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.380
 If you are finishing the roof 

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.620
 Before finishing the roof, I took them to the volcano 

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.080
 They spent the day, and I 

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.700
 I have been in the world all the time. 

00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.580
 This is not my first time here 

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.420
 But until now I have stayed on the crest. 

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.520
 With them, I'm closer to the crater 

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:58.760
 I like this. 

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000
 An isolated island in the middle of nowhere 

00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:03.240
 Yes 

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:05.520
 One by one residents 

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.380
 That's cool 

00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.640
 You like machete 

00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.940
 You like the job of machete 

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.480
 Cool way 

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.880
 Work in the forest 

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.920
 I can guide these people, very nice people 

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.380
 I can guide them to the top of the island 

00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.460
 Take them to the volcano 

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:26.200
 Spend a day with them 

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.920
 They regret that they must leave today 

00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.020
 But we spent a beautiful day together 

00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:33.380
 Now i have a little rice 

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.720
 I take onions, I take a garlic, 

00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.440
 I drank two glasses of beer 

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.060
 I also got 

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:40.220
 Coca Cola 

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.800
 Then I am really happy to meet them 

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:51.160
 It's cool, because today I am no longer lonely 

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.400
 Talk to people 

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.280
 I can exchange opinions, I can...you know me 

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.040
 I am no longer alone 

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.640
 Ok now i feel very happy 

00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.380
 Because they are here, but in another way 

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:08.960
 I also feel sad because they are leaving 

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.620
 But what I have to remember is 

00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.080
 They are with me 

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.420
 They changed my day 

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.560
 Thank you Norwegian people, thank you very much 

00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.560
 My visitors are right 

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.940
 In December, the rainy season begins 

00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.420
 I must make sure that my roof is waterproof 

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:40.560
 Once the work is completed and the last branch is determined 

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:44.060
 I decided to give myself a little luxury 

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.160
 Scenery on the ocean. 

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.120
 All work of the machete 

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.880
 The blade was finally mixed. 

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.080
 The machete is no longer cutting 

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.680
 And improve it, there is nothing better than this 

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.120
 There are more volcanic stones polished by the sea 

00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.860
 Once wet, it works well 

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.400
 After spending a few months on the island 

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.640
 I have enough knowledge. 

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.960
 In this way, routine transactions can be resolved. 

00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.940
 I am very good at providing food for myself 

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:22.340
 And around my camp 

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.340
 Has greatly increased 

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.120
 And loneliness... 

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.260
 At Christmas 

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:30.400
 I decided to use a satellite phone 

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.940
 Leave a message to my parents 

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:34.920
 This is my first Christmas without you 

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.060
 Feel a bit strange 

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.740
 That's it 

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.780
 I just want to wish you a Merry Christmas 

00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.380
 And dad, hope your hips are better 

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.380
 everything is fine 

00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.040
 I want you to know 

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.940
 Everything goes well 

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:52.200
 Don't worry about me 

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.200
 Merry Christmas. 

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:57.920
 Spend Christmas and New Year's Eve 

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.120
 Alone on the island 

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:00.220
 It's really frustrating. 

00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:02.240
 I am thinking of my friend 

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:04.320
 My family, foie gras 

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.960
 Champagne and all these things sparkle 

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.500
 Usually I donâ€™t like it very much. 

00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:11.280
 I stayed here for another six months 

00:27:11.780 --> 00:27:15.260
 Okay, not entirely because of my best friend Gael 

00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:16.780
 Promise to come 

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.240
 Spent two with me last week 

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:19.580
 But at the same time 

00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:20.680
 Myself. 

00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.000
 That's what i think 

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:24.340
 Because there are amazing company competitors 

00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:25.620
 Cheer up 

00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:27.000
 His name is sugar 

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.680
 He is nine months old 

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.780
 Lofi's father gave it to me 

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.680
 Because he thought i was 

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.980
 Hokula is so lonely here. 

00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:41.320
 Luffy came to the farmer I helped 

00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:42.380
 Come back one morning 

00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:43.960
 Give me these dogs as gifts. 

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:45.460
 He wanted to thank me 

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.120
 Because he saved his friend's finger. 

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.520
 My motivation is back on track 

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.320
 A small garden will increase my dietary diversity. 

00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.020
 So i became a farmer 

00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:58.920
 Always use what I can find. 

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.760
 I chose the front of the school may be strange 

00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.900
 Make my plantation 

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.480
 But this is very strategic thinking 

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:15.380
 because 

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.620
 First of all, this is the only place 

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.680
 Where there are no big trees 

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.640
 Another thing is 

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.560
 15 to 20 minutes away from my camp. 

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.640
 Then I can come every day 

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.960
 Because of wild boar 

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.120
 If i don't come every day 

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.820
 They will eat everything I do here. 

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.260
 Another reason is that the waterwheel is here 

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.700
 I will use it to 

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.820
 Watering my plantation. 

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:47.300
 I need to work more than beauty. 

00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.580
 I also kept the watermelon seeds 

00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.380
 Lofi gave it to me with the dog. 

00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.920
 The ground seems fertile 

00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.160
 And ideal temperature. 

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.720
 Therefore, while waiting for things to develop, 

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.520
 I decided to continue exploring the island. 

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.880
 Looking for new fruits or vegetables, 

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.260
 beach 

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.120
 cave 

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:15.080
 Or just a new landscape 

00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.260
 I walk west along the coast 

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.900
 Along the rocky cliff, 

00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:20.680
 Stop going to sea. 

00:29:20.680 --> 00:29:23.080
 I'm on the west side of the island, 

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:25.580
 The goal is to discover 

00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.420
 This part of the island 

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.880
 This is 

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.740
 I have that part of the house. 

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.800
 There are no big trees here 

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.860
 Insufficient vegetation 

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.800
 Vegetation is very dry 

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.660
 And one of the goals is to find 

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.340
 Captain Cook Cave 

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.880
 Because it's near the ocean 

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:49.920
 But here is big 

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:52.040
 Can't find it 

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.080
 Not impossible but difficult 

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.140
 OK, now itâ€™s time to go home and cook 

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.140
 Able to eat 

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.360
 I need a fish. 

00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:18.640
 That evening, 

00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.740
 I have a big surprise... 

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.560
 I put this 

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:26.000
 I was a little scared to see this little beast. 

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.000
 I saw another 

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.820
 About a month ago 

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.360
 Same size 

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.320
 I think what you see is great. 

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.280
 In addition to the impressive animals 

00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:39.800
 Suddenly I have a lot of food. 

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.320
 I tried hum 

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.340
 This is the hole in the ground where you are going to fire. 

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.640
 You put the fish fillet on the hot amber, 

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.360
 And completely cover up 

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:49.900
 Like an oven 

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.900
 The heat from it should 

00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.580
 Cook slowly 

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.200
 a couple of hours 

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.460
 The shark is cooked all night 

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.080
 I pray that no insect will invite me 

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.700
 Eat at your own expense. 

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.960
 After removing leaves and dirt 

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.920
 Mask it 

00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:13.500
 I won't believe it is hot 

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.540
 It's still hot! 

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:23.580
 Slow cooking is to save the fish 

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:25.060
 Lasts two to three days 

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:26.140
 But i'm frustrated 

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:27.920
 Only eat fish in the past few months 

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.680
 So I decided to hunt wild boar. 

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.360
 I tried to find a pig road, 

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.720
 There are many, many ways 

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.700
 For the pigs here 

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:44.100
 The pig used this road 

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:46.540
 For us, this is impossible... 

00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:48.560
 Follow all paths 

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:49.520
 Because if they are 

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:51.600
 No longer 60 cm high 

00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:54.700
 But if I find out, I want to make a hole 

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.640
 On it, 80 cm long 

00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.120
 40 cm 

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.160
 Maybe one meter 20 deep 

00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:06.400
 I want to hide some coconuts 

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:09.940
 Maybe I can raise a pig. 

00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.180
 Go this way, I want to find a suitable place 

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.340
 The ground is soft and near the water 

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.380
 The pig will definitely pass by. 

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.340
 water... 

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:21.820
 I think I found a good way 

00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:25.760
 Now i have to 

00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:28.940
 Find a good place to make a hole 

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.460
 While waiting, my small garden started to grow up. 

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.920
 The first bud is visible. 

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:03.280
 This is a huge success 

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.760
 The end result looks promising. 

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:06.720
 Big 

00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:08.620
 This is watermelon 

00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:14.480
 There are small onions here. 

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:17.920
 After only one week of my gardening work, 

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.700
 Everything is on the ground 

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:21.920
 Okay, I donâ€™t have many choices 

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.540
 But i see my job 

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.940
 Bear fruit. 

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:26.660
 Trap is ready 

00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:28.200
 Planted garden 

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.340
 That was the perfect time 

00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.800
 Visit the volcano 

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:37.760
 I woke up this morning 

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.820
 Then I have nothing to do... 

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.740
 why do not you go 

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.880
 Go to see the volcano 

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.300
 And the way from the top 

00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.120
 I have heard the loud sound of the volcano... already 

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.060
 When you are here 

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:56.000
 It looks real 

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.460
 It really looks like the moon 

00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.860
 Where the moon is. 

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.240
 Now i go to see the volcano 

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.140
 Deep sense of humility 

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.300
 Characterize each visit to the volcano 

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:05.980
 I touched the center of the earth 

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:07.260
 water 

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.240
 air 

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:09.880
 Earth and fire 

00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.940
 All elements have been collected. 

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.280
 Tropical rain for thousands of years 

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.400
 Created this magnificent scenery. 

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:22.780
 When i cross the canyon 

00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:24.180
 I was deeply attracted 

00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:26.580
 Unbelievable story formed by entering the island 

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.460
 Scratches are part of 

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:37.800
 My inconvenience every day 

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:39.880
 I pay little attention to this. 

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.780
 But when one of them starts to swell 

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.720
 And I canâ€™t even bend my fingers, 

00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:46.880
 I started to worry. 

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.420
 AaaaaÃ¯ueueeeeee 

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.020
 It's really painful. 

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.700
 By phone, my doctor explained 

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.860
 Actions i have to perform 

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.240
 Try to stop the infection. 

00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:04.940
 Within 24 hours, if it doesnâ€™t look good, 

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:06.760
 I go to the hospital 

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.600
 I need five to ten days 

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.580
 Until i can go to the first hospital 

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.440
 They can do something for me. 

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:16.740
 then... 

00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:18.960
 You know i don't have to wait too long 

00:36:19.380 --> 00:36:21.560
 If the infection doesnâ€™t really last 

00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:23.540
 In hand 

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:26.660
 It can rise to the arm 

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:28.420
 Into the blood 

00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:31.060
 It can cause general infections 

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.040
 If I have a general infection, 

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.220
 This is the danger in my life 

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.960
 I don't want to die 

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.480
 I'm not afraid of that 

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.160
 If I can do something against it, I will 

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.460
 In Tofua, it rains almost every day. 

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.140
 From now on my roof has proven itself 

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:55.340
 waterproof 

00:36:55.800 --> 00:36:57.320
 Therefore, well protected 

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.080
 I waited for the rain to stop 

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.600
 My hands are left 

00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:02.440
 nothing special 

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.640
 This is the day you have to study 

00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:05.840
 do nothing. 

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:10.540
 Then i do nothing 

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.600
 The next morning, when I reached the trap 

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.440
 It was a surprise to see this 

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.760
 It is no longer covered. 

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.020
 That's a pig 

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:22.180
 A female 

00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.220
 Its mother must have passed it 

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:25.920
 But the little guy fell into it. 

00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:38.800
 do you know, 

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.480
 I made a big hole just for you 

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.700
 Little pig like you 

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:05.400
 I really do not know 

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:07.020
 What do i plan to do 

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:10.460
 But of course I will not leave it and die here 

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:11.520
 alone 

00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:16.040
 A few days later, when my fingers are ready 

00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:19.080
 I decided to continue searching for Captain Cook's cave. 

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:21.360
 When Tonga took me to the island 

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.100
 They told me there 

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.040
 This time, luck is on my side. 

00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.820
 I will feel some shock 

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:37.360
 I have a feeling that I finally found it 

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.580
 In my garden 

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.180
 These plants make me happier 

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.500
 This is a 

00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:54.600
 And here 

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:57.080
 Another very small person at the beginning 

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.220
 I am really happy 

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:01.800
 I made it with my little hand 

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.380
 This is the result 

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.580
 Usually when I walk, the pig will follow me, but 

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.360
 I have to walk a lot today 

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.120
 Pig follow me 

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:20.320
 But followed me a mile 

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:21.180
 Something like this 

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.640
 Then enter the bush 

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:25.920
 And start hiding 

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.120
 It may take me two hours for me 

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.400
 Bring the pig back 

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:34.020
 After i have to carry it 

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.000
 Pig doesn't like to be taken away 

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.920
 Then shout 

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:43.000
 with 

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.220
 Pig raising 

00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:48.920
 Raising pigs for two hours and three hours 

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.760
 Such a shout is impossible. 

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.860
 Very noisy, pig 

00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:56.280
 Why 

00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:00.480
 Next time I will put a small cage in front of my house 

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.380
 Pigs are because... 

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.480
 How patient are you longing... 

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.440
 These two hours! 

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:17.980
 so terrible! 

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.600
 Every day, the island is full of surprises. 

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.060
 From waving a machete 

00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:46.280
 I ended up cutting some strange vines. 

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:47.180
 Yes 

00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:48.860
 It's coming 

00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:52.380
 Yes definitely take some time 

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.080
 Drink water in our country, but... 

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:58.720
 At least we have water, here we have time 

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.200
 Very good, a little sweet 

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.120
 When I go to the forest, I have a 

00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:08.300
 This is because there are not many coconuts around 

00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.760
 I want to drink 

00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.400
 Since I'm on tofu, it's really 

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.840
 I saw this for the first time 

00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:17.800
 Big wave 

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:19.200
 This is a very big wave. 

00:41:20.660 --> 00:41:22.760
 That's where I go fishing 

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.280
 Today's waves are 10m higher than they are now 

00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:34.060
 Seems like the beginning of the storm, or I donâ€™t know 

00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:38.140
 Oh la la! Big waaaaaave 

00:41:40.860 --> 00:41:42.260
 Really good 

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:52.500
 Seeing the storm coming, 

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:54.940
 I want to know if my heart will survive 

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.720
 Water resistance is one thing 

00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.760
 But there are other issues to consider 

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.560
 Like the roof is flying away 

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.480
 Or a coconut tree poured on it. 

00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:06.080
 I have to take out the solar panel. 

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:09.320
 The next morning, return to the same place 

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:10.780
 Have nothing. 

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.400
 The ocean took everything away. 

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.140
 at night 

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.120
 The wind is getting bigger 

00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.100
 When night came, my ordeal really began. 

00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:22.740
 The crackling sound is very scary 

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.060
 But the worst is when the wind turns 

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:27.120
 Rain hit me 

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.260
 There is no more hiding place. 

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.900
 I soak... 

00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:34.480
 Hello everyone 

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:40.160
 Now morning again 

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:42.980
 This is good because 

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.520
 All night, I did not sleep 

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.380
 I can't see around me 

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:51.860
 I don't know what happened 

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:53.000
 I can hear thunderstorm thunder 

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.560
 A lot of noise, thunderstorms, 

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.840
 Thunder, lightning and everything. 

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.420
 I fell asleep, but every time I fall asleep 

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.060
 Things wake me up again 

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.880
 Very short night 

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:18.880
 Now i won't come again 

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.600
 Because i can see it again 

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:24.120
 What happened is important 

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.340
 New day new day 

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.020
 I am happy because my residence is still there 

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:35.660
 that's good 

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:43.520
 This is what I cleaned in front of the house 

00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:48.220
 I decided to take two paths in front of the house. 

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.580
 I know it is not very useful to take these paths 

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.580
 Because every day I have to do it again 

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.540
 Because the leaves on the tree 

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:57.640
 Fell a lot 

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.220
 I need to do it again 

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:02.120
 Then I still have something to do 

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.120
 Because sometimes, the time here 

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.080
 Sometimes it's very long, and then I don't know what to do. 

00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:12.100
 I must also put the solar system back 

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.520
 Obviously not wrong 

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:18.200
 It's fully charged 

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:20.500
 I am not sure about the adapter 

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:23.220
 Work because of all the humidity 

00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.100
 Probably in a storm 

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:28.140
 I thought he was broken, but still 

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.500
 It looks good. 

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:35.340
 But there were some casualties and storms anyway. 

00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.360
 At first glance everything is okay. 

00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.320
 Sugar cane grew up 

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.120
 And onions and taro 

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.400
 Watermelon did not. 

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.600
 They are rotten, terrible 

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.340
 Everything is destroyed 

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:54.480
 I am suffering in a new manual project 

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.960
 I am very happy because now I have a bench. 

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.600
 Sometimes itâ€™s hard to get motivated here 

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:31.400
 But today 

00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.120
 I woke up and I said yes, I'm going to make a bench 

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.420
 Now i have a bench at night 

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.280
 I have a bench 

00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.140
 I am very happy. 

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.920
 I'm about to end the adventure 

00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:52.640
 Gail will come to help me soon 

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:54.200
 Adapt to social life 

00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.840
 Ready to go home 

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.460
 So I started to scan the horizon. 

00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:02.680
 In this world, nothing is taken for granted. 

00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.580
 Baby is a surprising surprise for me 

00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:08.120
 as usual 

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.500
 Itâ€™s down, but this time 

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:12.720
 She is gone. 

00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:16.180
 I went to the island today 

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.480
 Itâ€™s about 500 meters, otherwise itâ€™s 500 meters. 

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.720
 I tried to find her, but... 

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.960
 The island is too big 

00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:29.600
 How long can you find... 

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:34.440
 Can't find her. 

00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:36.420
 But at least i tried 

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.020
 When I proposed to her in the cave, I did 

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:41.880
 She is a bit like 

00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:44.060
 Up to three weeks 

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.440
 Very small 

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:47.800
 I must try my best to feed her 

00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.550
 A week later she started to eat by herself 

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.040
 A great victory for me 

00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:57.000
 I feel like my parents 

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.900
 People who need to let their children out. 

00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:04.480
 If this is her decision 

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:07.100
 Back to nature and split with me 

00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.780
 And start living in the wild again 

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:13.960
 This is her decision 

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:15.540
 I am very happy 

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:19.620
 Now she is gone 

00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:23.440
 There is no trouble around my house. 

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.160
 I kind of miss this... 

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.860
 I mean you know, this is part of the game. 

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:31.540
 I just hope she is all right. 

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.840
 If the day before I left 

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.220
 She wants to come back to say hello 

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.340
 I will be happy 

00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.620
 Gael's arrival means the end of my lonely life 

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.920
 It really restored my energy. 

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:09.400
 I want to show him everything 

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:11.940
 When it comes back 

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.620
 I told myself it was incredible. 

00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:36.280
 Very good, since Gail arrived 

00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.220
 I can be like 

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:39.940
 The food i used to eat 

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:43.400
 In Switzerland, there is dried meat and 

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.360
 And cheese 

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:47.400
 with 

00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:49.980
 This is Nirvana Paradise 

00:48:50.980 --> 00:48:52.020
 Christmas time 

00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.540
 One of Gael's first challenges 

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.320
 Is walking through the forest 

00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:58.340
 Um, Gail, where is the road? 

00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:07.460
 In another two weeks, 

00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:08.760
 I tried to share my experience 

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.760
 One of my friendâ€™s last nine months 

00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:12.100
 fishing 

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:14.220
 volcanic 

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.980
 I told him all 

00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:19.000
 My joy 

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.320
 My sadness 

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.300
 My loneliness 

00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:45.880
 The final departure is coming to an end. 

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.240
 There is another task to be completed 

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.840
 Before leaving the island 

00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:54.900
 When i put the box in the hole 

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.100
 I stopped time 

00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:58.520
 What i realize now is 

00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:01.140
 Even if i want to stop the time 

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.980
 Time continues 

00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.120
 But you donâ€™t have the same opinion 

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:10.020
 For me, it is important to always know 

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.060
 Day of the week 

00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:17.060
 I know that every experience has a beginning 

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:18.360
 And it's over. 

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:22.040
 And when to start the experience 

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.480
 When the adventure begins 

00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.480
 You always have to move forward 

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.200
 Finally, you must accept 

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:31.060
 You have given up all this. 

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.620
 This is part of quitting all games 

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:36.000
 Then back 

00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:38.960
 My previous life 

00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:46.000
 When i came here i didn't know 

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.100
 Anything about this place 

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:48.480
 anything 

00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:50.160
 just now 

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.520
 I can say that after nine and a half months 

00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.540
 I feel home 

00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:55.700
 Yes 

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.420
 I feel home
