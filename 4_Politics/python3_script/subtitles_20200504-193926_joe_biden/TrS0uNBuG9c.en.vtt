JOHN OLIVER: North Korea...
America's number one excuse

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:07.506
for putting off chores
this week.

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:09.776
"Y'know, I could do laundry,
but if the world's

00:00:09.876 --> 00:00:13.012
about to erupt into nuclear war,
what really is the point?"

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:14.046
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:14.446 --> 00:00:16.949
North Korea has clearly been
on everyone's minds this week,

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:18.317
and I think you know why.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:21.287 line:0%
President Trump and North Korea
escalate the war of words,

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:24.590 line:0%
lobbing new threats
and sending new tweets.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.359 line:0%
North Korea now accusing the
president of the United States

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:31.864 line:0%
of pushing the world to, quote,
"the brink of nuclear war."

00:00:32.631 --> 00:00:36.402
Wow. When Twitter was
invented, I bet even they

00:00:36.502 --> 00:00:39.138
didn't imagine that it would
one day lead us to the brink

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.907
-of nuclear Armageddon.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:43.075
It's like if the invention
of the Furby had led

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:45.111
-to the Sudanese civil war.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:47.146
Who knew that that's
where it was headed?

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.247
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:48.347 --> 00:00:50.483
Now, tensions have sharply
escalated this week,

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.418
which is a little surprising,
given that the world

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:53.953
has been dealing
with North Korea's

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:56.022
provocative missile tests
for years now.

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.024
Just two weeks ago,
they were doing this.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:00.225 line:0%
CORRESPONDENT:<i> North Korea fires
 yet another missile,</i>

00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.595 line:0%

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:04.196 line:0%

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:13.772
Wait! New York?
I live in New York!

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.176
-This shit just got real!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.978
No, I think if anyone is--
if everyone is really honest,

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.514
your level of fear
over the North Korea situation

00:01:21.614 --> 00:01:23.449
is in direct proportion
to whether or not

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.451
they can hit the exact place
where you live.

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:26.285
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:28.487
We film this show
on 57th street.

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:31.791
If you told me that the blast
radius stops at 56th street,

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:33.960
I'd think, "Well, I hope nothing
happens,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.662
but we've still got time
before things get serious."

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:37.730
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:01:38.298 --> 00:01:41.334
-Now, it is-- it is worth
properly understanding
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDS)

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.970
what North Korea is
currently capable of,

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.205
because while their missiles
may be able to reach us

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:48.407
and they do have
nuclear warheads,

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:51.678
most experts believe that they
don't yet have the technology

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.947
to reliably hit
the U.S. mainland,

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:57.417
so that is reassuring.
Although, on the other hand

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.186
a recent Pentagon assessment did
suggest that they could cross

00:02:00.286 --> 00:02:01.821
that threshold next year.

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:05.291
So, if a job interviewer asks
you, "Where do you see yourself

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.492
in five years' time?"

00:02:06.592 --> 00:02:09.629
It is now perfectly acceptable
just to scream in terror

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.831
-into their face.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:15.335
Look, this is clearly a very
serious situation,

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:16.802
requiring a deft hand.

00:02:16.902 --> 00:02:19.605
And, sadly,
that's not what it got.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:24.210
North Korea best not
make any more threats

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.612
to the United states.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:30.517
They will be met
with fire and fury,

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:33.719
like the world has never seen.

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:38.424
"Fire and fury." The only way
that that is not terrifying

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:41.427
is if you report it the way one
newspaper actually did in Maine

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:44.364
saying, "Trump warns
of fire and furry."

00:02:44.464 --> 00:02:45.431
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:48.001
In which case, Trump was
threatening to send this

00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:51.404
to North Korea, which is a very
different kind of threat.

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.907
Now-- now, in response,
North Korea announced plans

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:58.611
to fire missiles that would land
just off the coast of the U.S.
territory of Guam,

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:02.381
which is frightening,
although not unprecedented.

00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:04.650
They have made similar
threats before.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.887
But what is different this time,
obviously, is that we now have

00:03:07.987 --> 00:03:11.023
a president who has the general
temperament of a wet cat.

00:03:11.323 --> 00:03:13.726
And, in response
to that Guam threat,

00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:15.561
Trump promptly doubled down.

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:17.964 line:0%
Frankly, uh, the people
that were questioning

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.999 line:0%
that statement,
"Was it too tough?"

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.668 line:0%
Maybe it wasn't tough enough.

00:03:21.768 --> 00:03:24.904 line:0%
If anything, that statement
may not be tough enough.

00:03:26.972 --> 00:03:28.407 line:0%
Well, you'll see, you'll see.

00:03:29.008 --> 00:03:31.911
"Yeah, we're gonna go
with that bomb more destructive

00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:34.113
than the nuclear bomb.
Why? I don't know!

00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:36.482
Who cares that it doesn't exist?
Sincerely yours, Donald Trump.

00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.617
I'm not writing a letter.
I'm talking. Says you!

00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:39.719
Fake news. Goodbye!"

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:41.287
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS, APPLAUDS)

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:44.489
So, tonight,
we thought we would ask,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.792
"What, exactly,
is North Korea thinking?

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:48.794
How did we get into this mess?

00:03:48.894 --> 00:03:50.596
And what can we possibly
do about it?"

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:53.299
And let's start by trying
to understand just a little bit

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:54.733
more about North Korea.

00:03:54.833 --> 00:03:57.937
And that in itself is difficult.
It's one of the most isolated

00:03:58.037 --> 00:03:59.272
and insular nations on earth.

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:01.640
If you know anything about it
at all, it's probably just that

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:05.110
they have a wacky totalitarian
leader who loves

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.480
military parades
and Dennis Rodman,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.416
and who really didn't like that
Seth Rogen movie

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:11.584
about his assassination.

00:04:11.684 --> 00:04:13.319
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And it can be hard

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.521
to trust any information
about North Korea,

00:04:15.621 --> 00:04:18.724
because lots of it is
inaccurate for multiple reasons.

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.993
First, there's the outright
state propaganda,

00:04:21.093 --> 00:04:24.296
which glorifies North Korea's
leaders, the Kim family.

00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:27.600
Just last year, we showed you
western journalists being taken

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.568
on a tour
of a historic target range,

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:32.004
where they learned something
suspiciously impressive

00:04:32.104 --> 00:04:33.639
about Kim Jong-Un's father.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.042 line:0%
Comrade Kim Jong-il shot three
bullets and three of them

00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:38.143 line:0%
got bulls-eye.

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:39.412 line:0%
-They all got bulls-eye?
-Mm-hmm.

00:04:39.512 --> 00:04:42.548 line:0%
-And how old was he at the time?
-He was 7-year-old.

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:43.482 line:0%
A 7-year-old's got

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:44.850 line:0%
-three bulls-eyes?
-Mm-hmm. yeah.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.753 line:0%
-That's pretty impressive.
-(LAUGHS) Mm-hmm.

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.922
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:04:50.022 --> 00:04:52.725
I mean, that-- that is
the "mm-hmm"

00:04:52.958 --> 00:04:55.828
of someone who really wants
to shut down a conversation.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:58.264
She sounds like a parent
fielding questions

00:04:58.364 --> 00:04:59.698
about where babies come from.

00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:02.368
-"So, a stork brings the baby?"
-"Mm-hmm."

00:05:02.701 --> 00:05:05.437
"It carries an eight-pound baby
through the air in its mouth?"

00:05:05.537 --> 00:05:06.538
"Mm-hmm."

00:05:06.638 --> 00:05:08.407
-"Isn't that dangerous?"
-"Mm-hmm."

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:10.643
"Where does the stork get
the babies?"

00:05:10.743 --> 00:05:14.846
"Storks fuck! They fuck each
other! Storks fuck each other,

00:05:14.947 --> 00:05:17.249
and the baby comes
out of the stork's vagina!

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.219
Don't ask for the truth
if you can't handle it!"

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.821
(AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS)

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.023
But, here's the thing.

00:05:25.291 --> 00:05:28.093
Inaccuracies like that are
easy to spot.

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:30.129
What is trickier is that a lot
of eye-catching western

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.498
reporting about North Korea
can be shakily sourced,

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:33.599
like this one.

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:37.102
JOY-ANN REID:<i> The BBC reports
 all of the men in the
 hermit kingdom</i>

00:05:37.202 --> 00:05:40.873
<i>must now sport the same haircut
as the dear leader, Kim Jong-un.</i>

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.743
<i> His look was known as
 the Chinese smuggler haircut</i>

00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:46.645
<i>not too long ago in the region,
 but now it will be known as</i>

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:49.548
"The haircut every man
in North Korea must have."

00:05:49.815 --> 00:05:50.916
Lucky them.

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:52.284
Here's the thing...

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:55.321
There is no solid evidence
that that story is true.

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:58.190
But it is seductive because it
sounds like it could be.

00:05:58.391 --> 00:05:59.625
It's like if you saw
the headline

00:05:59.725 --> 00:06:01.794
"Trump to NATO:
I invented Squirrels."

00:06:02.094 --> 00:06:04.663
You'd believe it because it
sounds like something

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:08.267
he would've claimed, even though
as of this taping, he has not.

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:11.970
And, while it may not be true
that all men had to get

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.974
the same haircut as Kim Jong-un,
state TV did run a series

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:17.476
called "Let Us Trim
Our Hair in Accordance

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:18.877
with the Socialist Lifestyle."

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:23.182
And it's weird when a verifiable
truth is almost as strange

00:06:23.282 --> 00:06:24.283
as a wild rumor.

00:06:24.683 --> 00:06:27.953
It's like how the "Richard Gere
Put a Gerbil in His Ass" story

00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:30.523
is completely false,
but what if the truth

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:33.092
was that he engaged in
consensual mutual anal play

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:36.295
with a chinchilla?
That would still be bizarre.

00:06:36.495 --> 00:06:38.497
You wouldn't have
to exaggerate that.

00:06:39.164 --> 00:06:41.734
And sometimes, the truth
about life in North Korea

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:44.303
can be just as striking
as the urban legends.

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:47.507
For instance, you may have seen
claims online that every teacher

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:50.475
in North Korea is obligated
to play the accordion.

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:52.177
We could not confirm that.

00:06:52.277 --> 00:06:55.447
Although, in trying to, we did
discover that North Korea

00:06:55.547 --> 00:06:58.884
does love the accordion
to a surprising extent.

00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:02.488
The country is full of them.
Here is an accordion factory.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:04.890
Here's some schoolchildren
playing the accordion.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:07.159
Here's Kim Jong-un
looking at an accordion.

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:10.162
Here is an air combat exercise
where the camera pans

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.797
<i> across pilots, and guess what?</i>

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:15.301
<i>-Yep. It's a fucking accordion.</i>
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:07:15.535 --> 00:07:17.569
They also have a very
popular song called

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.306
"Nothing to Envy in the World"
that begins with the line

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:22.608
"The sky is blue,
my heart is merry,

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:24.810
let the sound
of accordions ring."

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.947
And then there is this video
of North Koreans playing

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:30.116
the last song that
you would expect.

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:33.553

-Yes.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:07:44.197 --> 00:07:46.231
That is North Korean
accordionists playing

00:07:46.331 --> 00:07:47.400
"Take on Me."

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.736
So beat that, everyone else
who plays the accordion!

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:53.739
By which I mean exactly
two old French men

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:55.374
and one "Weird Al" Yankovic.

00:07:56.041 --> 00:07:59.578
And if you think that that is
the most amazing piece

00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:01.647
of North Korean Pop culture
that you're gonna see tonight,

00:08:01.747 --> 00:08:02.748
you are wrong.

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:02.654
Partly because, remember,
Kim Jong-un believes they are

00:17:02.754 --> 00:17:04.790
critical for his survival,
and on top of that,

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:07.492
Donald Trump is a shitty
negotiator.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.162
In his short presidency,
he has failed to get Mexico

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:12.364
to pay for his stupid wall,
he's failed to get

00:17:12.464 --> 00:17:15.700
a Congress his party controls
to pass a health care bill,

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.336
and even when his administration
does get something done,

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:21.072
it way oversells it,
like when the White House

00:17:21.172 --> 00:17:23.174
announced a trade deal with
China as,

00:17:23.274 --> 00:17:26.912
"Very Big News," "Gigantic," and
"Herculean,"

00:17:27.012 --> 00:17:29.347
and one much-celebrated
component turned out to be

00:17:29.447 --> 00:17:32.751
lifting a ban on beef imports
that China had preliminarily

00:17:32.851 --> 00:17:34.553
agreed to last September.

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:36.921
So way to fucking go there,
Donald!

00:17:37.021 --> 00:17:39.191
What a very big, herculean deal!

00:17:39.291 --> 00:17:42.628
Thanks to you, except,
not entirely thanks to you,

00:17:42.728 --> 00:17:46.631
America is now marginally
more able to export beef again!

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:49.267
And since taking office,

00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:51.903
Trump has voiced support
for an even simpler solution.

So, in the space of 14
seconds there,

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:11.189
he said the word "great" twice,

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:14.058
he pronounced "China"
with three syllables,

00:18:14.292 --> 00:18:16.361
suggested someone else should
do the work for him,

00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:18.463
and then, threw in a
"possibly or probably,"

00:18:18.563 --> 00:18:19.932
rendering the whole
thing meaningless.

00:18:20.032 --> 00:18:22.234
I think I may have just hit
Trump bingo,

00:18:22.334 --> 00:18:24.869

(CROWD LAUGHS)

00:18:26.004 --> 00:18:29.708
But Trump's idea there
of convincing China

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:31.743
to exert influence
on North Korea,

00:18:31.843 --> 00:18:33.545
is not inherently crazy.

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:36.414
China shares an 800-mile border
with North Korea

00:18:36.514 --> 00:18:38.283
and accounts for
as much as 90 percent

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:39.717
of North Korea's total trade,

00:18:39.817 --> 00:18:41.419
so they do have
significant leverage.

00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:45.056
But, some are skeptical about
just what China could,

00:18:45.156 --> 00:18:46.558
or is willing to do.

00:18:46.658 --> 00:18:49.761
Take sanctions. The U.N.
have tried multiple rounds

00:18:49.861 --> 00:18:52.965

but North Korea has always found

00:18:53.065 --> 00:18:54.166
easy ways around them.

could get out of hand very fast.

00:20:20.218 --> 00:20:22.087
North Korea would likely
retaliate and they have

00:20:22.187 --> 00:20:25.657
an estimated 8,000 pieces
of heavy artillery stationed

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:28.226
just north of the DMZ,
which is here.

00:20:28.493 --> 00:20:30.729

of reaching Seoul,

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:32.397

that vacuum can be filled
with terrible things.

We do not want to find out what
North Korea's ISIS would be.

"North Korea's ISIS"
