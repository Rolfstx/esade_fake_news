00:00:01.065 --> 00:00:03.765
 Don't the rich tell you "Don't reveal this to them, Rob"? 

00:00:03.765 --> 00:00:07.175
 Yes Yes Yes. "Don't tell them what you know. Keep them poor." 

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.645
 My father was a supporter of education. 

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:14.895
 I went home and asked him: 

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:17.005
 - Why don't we learn about money at school? 

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:21.705
 And he looked at me and said, "Because the government won't let us." 

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:22.805
 to teach this subject. 

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:26.045
 The government tells us what we can teach and what we can't. 

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:27.045
 The government tells us what we can teach and what we can't 

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:29.520
 I thought that was weird. And I said - But ... 

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:34.065
 Don't we go to school to learn about money? 

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:35.135
 He said, "No." 

00:00:35.455 --> 00:00:37.195
 Your job is to find a job. 

00:00:37.585 --> 00:00:40.325
 I said, "You're getting a job." 

00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:41.325
 so you can make money. 

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.615
 He replied, "No!" You just have to find a job 

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:45.875
 And I answer - No, no, no, no .. 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.500
 The purpose of the job, isn't it to make money? 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.540
 He said, "You're right." 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.580
 I said, "Then why don't they teach us how to make money, not how to work?" 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 He got angry with me and said: 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:02.080
 "If you want to learn about money, why don't you ask your best friend's father." 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.680
 about money? 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.860
 And I asked, "Why should I ask him?" 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.300
 He said, "Because it's Mike's father." 

00:01:10.305 --> 00:01:11.305
 businessman. 

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:13.140
 And I asked: - And what are you? 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.755
 He replied, "I am an employee." 

00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:15.755
 I am a government employee. 

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:19.425
 And I said, "Oh ... What's the difference?" 

00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:22.725
 He said, "The difference is that he's an entrepreneur." 

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:25.505
 obliged to know about the money. Or he is not an entrepreneur at all. 

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:28.455
 And the employee is not needed 

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:30.925
 to know nothing about money because 

00:01:30.925 --> 00:01:32.565
 the government takes care of him, the company takes care of him. 

00:01:33.325 --> 00:01:35.305
 I was just a kid. I was confused 

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:38.815
 But I followed my father's advice 

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:42.145
 I went to Mike's father's office and knocked on the door. 

00:01:42.175 --> 00:01:44.615
 And I said, "Hey!" I'm here. 9 years old. 

00:01:44.615 --> 00:01:47.655
 Teach me about money. And he said, "Get lost, kid." 

00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:50.525
 But this is how the story of Rich Dad Poor Dad began. 

00:01:50.525 --> 00:01:53.715
 Finally, because of my perseverance, my rich father began teaching me about money 

00:01:53.715 --> 00:01:55.575
 however, under one condition. 

00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:58.495
 And that condition was that he would never pay me money. 

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.715
 He said, "The moment you get paid, you'll start thinking like a worker." 

00:02:02.795 --> 00:02:04.525
 This is the trap. 

00:02:04.905 --> 00:02:06.835
 Businessmen work for free. 

00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:10.815
 I was 9 years old then and my head was just splitting in half. 

00:02:10.815 --> 00:02:11.815
 I was 9 years old then and my head was just splitting in half. 

00:02:11.955 --> 00:02:15.185
 He said, "Never ask for my salary, kid." Do you understand ? 

00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:17.505
 - All right. Understood. 

00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:20.205
 Then he asked me, "Okay." Then how do I make money? 

00:02:20.665 --> 00:02:23.425
 This is exactly what business people need to find out 

00:02:23.775 --> 00:02:26.905
 - How to learn about money, I asked? Learn to play Monopoly, he said 

00:02:26.905 --> 00:02:29.435
 - How to learn about money, I asked? Learn to play Monopoly, he said 

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:32.345
 I started working for him for free. He had hotels and restaurants in real life. 

00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:35.235
 I cleaned, discarded butts, and performed the duties of a servant. 

00:02:35.305 --> 00:02:38.385
 And when I grew up, I started doing office work and marketing 

00:02:38.385 --> 00:02:41.055
 and accounting and I was an apprentice in general. 

00:02:41.055 --> 00:02:42.215
 But I always worked for free. 

00:02:43.815 --> 00:02:46.855
 And he taught me about money, but the way he taught me about money, 

00:02:46.855 --> 00:02:47.925
 it was through Monopoly. 

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.835
 And one day I just got tired. 

00:02:50.835 --> 00:02:53.845
 And I asked him, "Okay." When will you really teach me about money? He said, "What do you think we're doing?" 

00:02:55.745 --> 00:02:58.295
 "Are we playing Monopoly?" He said, "No, no, no." 

00:02:58.525 --> 00:02:59.835
 Is that what you think we're doing? 

00:03:01.735 --> 00:03:03.735
 - We play Monopoly. "Is that what you think we're doing?" 

00:03:03.735 --> 00:03:04.275
 - We play Monopoly. "Is that what you think we're doing?" 

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:07.415
 I said, I don't know. He said, "I'm teaching you about money." 

00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:11.205
 And then, it was like having a green house in Monopoly 

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:12.775
 And he said, 

00:03:12.995 --> 00:03:16.085
 - There are many formulas for huge success with money. 

00:03:16.085 --> 00:03:18.925
 There are thousands, but one of the best discovered is through the game of Monopoly. " 

00:03:19.535 --> 00:03:20.535
 And it still is. 

00:03:21.065 --> 00:03:22.065
 Four green houses. 

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:23.565
 A red hotel. 

00:03:25.885 --> 00:03:28.845
 He said, "One of the best ways." 

00:03:28.845 --> 00:03:31.875
 to be rich is like playing Monopoly in real life. 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.160
 Four green houses. A red hotel. 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.940
 - Is that all? - Yes, this is it. 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.060
 And then he said, "Okay." What do you think I'm doing? - I do not know. I replied 

00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:45.575
 And then he took me out, showed me his green houses. 

00:03:46.945 --> 00:03:50.215
 And 10 years later, when I was 19 years old. and I was at school in New York 

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:53.605
 I returned to Hawaii. My rich dad had bought ... 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.160
 ... the largest piece of land located in the center of Waikiki Beach. 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.840
 ... the largest piece of land located in the center of Waikiki Beach. 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.320
 And when you go to Waikiki Beach even today, you will see the Hyatt Regency Hotel. 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.220
 This was his hotel. 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.620
 Just like in the game of Monopoly. 

00:04:07.005 --> 00:04:08.505
 Just like in the game of Monopoly. 

00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:12.185
 Acquired assets have become larger assets. He was just doing what it's called 

00:04:12.235 --> 00:04:15.315
 accumulation because this property 

00:04:15.315 --> 00:04:18.295
 it wasn't that big at the time. He had to buy the smaller ones 

00:04:18.295 --> 00:04:19.295
 it wasn't that big at the time. He had to buy the smaller ones. 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.860
 Because Waikiki was just a small muddy town. 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.480
 That's why he bought a shop from one owner and a cafe from another owner 

00:04:25.845 --> 00:04:29.205
 It took him a while, but he finally put this big piece of land together. 

00:04:29.205 --> 00:04:30.605
 It took him a while, but he finally put this big piece of land together. 

00:04:31.335 --> 00:04:32.755
 And then he and Hyatt 

00:04:33.115 --> 00:04:34.745
 built this huge hotel. 

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.855
 And they sold it for $ 800,000,000 

00:04:37.855 --> 00:04:39.475
 And they sold it for $ 800,000,000 

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:43.125
 And that's the way I learned about money. 

00:04:48.485 --> 00:04:51.335
 I've had financial disasters. 

00:04:51.335 --> 00:04:54.265
 I've had people stab me in the back, but it's all for the best. 

00:04:54.485 --> 00:04:57.425
 Because that's how you build yourself as a person. This is progress. 

00:04:57.425 --> 00:05:00.185
 People who are afraid to make mistakes as they were taught in school. 

00:05:00.185 --> 00:05:01.405
 They never grow up 

00:05:02.035 --> 00:05:03.325
 Because growing up is a process. 

00:05:03.325 --> 00:05:05.015
 There are good moments There are bad moments 

00:05:05.015 --> 00:05:08.065
 There are wrong things to do. There are also the right actions. 

00:05:08.065 --> 00:05:09.060
 There are ups There are downs 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.260
 Most people want to be right all the time. 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.220
 It can't be that way. This is not the reality. 

00:05:17.815 --> 00:05:20.675
 I was not poor by the standards of others. 

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:21.675
 I was not poor, by the standards of others. 

00:05:22.075 --> 00:05:24.945
 But I came from a poor-minded family. 

00:05:24.945 --> 00:05:27.335
 If you understand what I mean 

00:05:27.335 --> 00:05:30.185
 Because rich, poor and middle class .. 

00:05:30.185 --> 00:05:31.765
 Poverty begins with limited thinking. 

00:05:33.225 --> 00:05:34.875
 Poverty is passed on. 

00:05:35.425 --> 00:05:37.015
 He studies in the family. 

00:05:38.435 --> 00:05:40.595
 And the middle class learns in the family. 

00:05:40.915 --> 00:05:43.965
 And the people who are just staying at home now, 

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:47.325
 who are suffering financially or worried about money, 

00:05:47.405 --> 00:05:50.355
 or they are unhappy, they can make a lot of money, but they are still unhappy 

00:05:50.355 --> 00:05:51.695
 because of what they do 

00:05:52.525 --> 00:05:54.225
 they were most likely learned that way. 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.680
 It's planted in their heads 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.640
 Find a job and work hard 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.185
 either you will never be rich, or the rich are evil ... whatever. 

00:06:02.185 --> 00:06:04.965
 The education system will never teach you about money. 

00:06:04.965 --> 00:06:06.395
 The education system is done 

00:06:06.395 --> 00:06:09.445
 so that it can teach you to be an employee, 

00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:11.995
 or a doctor or lawyer. 

00:06:11.995 --> 00:06:13.045
 Specialist. 

00:06:13.555 --> 00:06:15.275
 But not wealthy. 

00:06:15.935 --> 00:06:18.535
 And what most people miss 

00:06:18.735 --> 00:06:21.545
 are real business knowledge. Like keeping accounts 

00:06:21.815 --> 00:06:24.245
 as debts, as fees 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:28.460
 You need to know this, but you are not taught in school. They don't teach anyone. 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.500
 And people ask me: How did your rich father learn this ... 

00:06:32.505 --> 00:06:33.505
 And people ask me: How did your rich father learn this ... 

00:06:33.735 --> 00:06:37.145
 ... which the poor man with a doctorate in education failed to do 

00:06:37.265 --> 00:06:38.785
 And the answer is very simple. 

00:06:38.785 --> 00:06:41.785
 My rich father, the father of my best friend 

00:06:41.785 --> 00:06:44.805
 his father died when he was 13 years old. 

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:47.655
 On his shoulders remained a family business, which was to continue at the age of 13. 

00:06:47.655 --> 00:06:48.655
 On his shoulders remained a family business, which was to continue at the age of 13. 

00:06:48.735 --> 00:06:51.025
 He even had to leave school for that 

00:06:51.025 --> 00:06:52.405
 which was a blessing. 

00:06:52.755 --> 00:06:54.575
 There are blessings that ... 

00:06:55.215 --> 00:06:57.885
 ... sometimes they don't look like that 

00:06:57.885 --> 00:06:59.245
 but it turns out they are 

00:06:59.645 --> 00:07:02.155
 And then his teachers were 

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:05.145
 his accountants, lawyers, 

00:07:05.145 --> 00:07:08.335
 his bankers, his real estate agents. He has this, 

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.420
 which I call "True Teachers." Not these fake teachers at school. 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:15.920
 Most teachers in school 

00:07:15.925 --> 00:07:18.645
 they have no moral principles. They study subjects, 

00:07:18.645 --> 00:07:20.495
 which they themselves do not use. 

00:07:21.405 --> 00:07:24.525
 I asked the teacher, "Okay, this is my third year of higher math." 

00:07:24.525 --> 00:07:27.755
 They called it "The strength of materials" 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.280
 I asked, "Will I ever use this?" 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.220
 He replied, "No." 

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.240
 "Then why are you teaching us?" 

00:07:37.935 --> 00:07:39.035
 "Because they pay me." 

00:07:39.375 --> 00:07:41.675
 - Do you ever use it? - No. 

00:07:43.195 --> 00:07:46.505
 That is why I say that in order to succeed in life ... 

00:07:47.035 --> 00:07:49.985
 ... one of the things you have to do is 

00:07:49.985 --> 00:07:52.225
 to find a real teacher instead of a fake. 

00:07:52.535 --> 00:07:55.635
 fake teachers are those who do not practice what they teach 

00:07:56.925 --> 00:07:59.845
 And real teachers do what they teach every day 

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.925
 So my accountants, my lawyers 

00:08:02.925 --> 00:08:05.785
 they do it every day of God. This is how I learned. 

00:08:05.785 --> 00:08:07.595
 Because every day I deal with the problems in my business. 

00:08:08.305 --> 00:08:11.235
 I have accountants and lawyers and bankers, 

00:08:11.235 --> 00:08:14.275
 and all these speed dial people, 

00:08:14.275 --> 00:08:16.545
 because I solve problems with my team. 

00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:20.795
 "I see you're imparting this knowledge." - Yes 

00:08:20.795 --> 00:08:23.225
 Are rich people uncomfortable? And do they tell you "Don't tell them this, Rob"? 

00:08:23.225 --> 00:08:26.625
 Yes Yes Yes. Don't tell people what you know. Keep them poor. 

00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:30.075
 but, unfortunately for the poor, 

00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:32.655
 as in the bible, i'm not very religious, 

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.300
 but the poor will always be poor, because it all starts here 

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.200
 Is this fear mental? 

00:08:37.515 --> 00:08:40.345
 He is in their words, and the words 

00:08:40.345 --> 00:08:43.295
 become a reality. 

00:08:44.745 --> 00:08:47.755
 When they say, "I can't afford it. I can't do this." 

00:08:48.385 --> 00:08:51.165
 They fail. They become what they say 

00:08:51.615 --> 00:08:54.805
 My poor father used to say, "What do you think?" That I'm made of money? 

00:08:54.875 --> 00:08:56.295
 I can't afford that. 

00:08:56.905 --> 00:08:58.660
 And my rich father would say, "That's why he's poor." 

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.175
 And my rich father would say, "That's why he's poor." 

00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:03.535
 Poor people say, I can't afford it, I can't do that, I don't have time. 

00:09:03.535 --> 00:09:04.535
 The poor people say, I can't afford it, I can't do that, I don't have time. 

00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:06.295
 Because this is the way out. 

00:09:07.105 --> 00:09:09.995
 This is a way out. It's easier to say "I can't afford it" 

00:09:10.075 --> 00:09:11.975
 And what did you say, your rich father? 

00:09:11.975 --> 00:09:15.285
 instead, "I can't afford it" - How can I afford it? 

00:09:15.615 --> 00:09:18.765
 How can I do this? What will it cost me? 

00:09:18.765 --> 00:09:20.275
 Or why do it? 

00:09:20.635 --> 00:09:23.625
 He said, "Questions open the mind." 

00:09:23.625 --> 00:09:26.415
 The allegations close it. And when you say "I can't afford it" 

00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:29.765
 Your mind goes out. And what you say happens. 

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.900
 Rugby is a team sport, as is football 

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.180
 the rules are different. Others play golf. 

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.420
 They play alone. 

00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.235
 Everybody is different. 

00:09:40.795 --> 00:09:43.755
 My game №1, financially, is business. 

00:09:43.755 --> 00:09:45.745
 № 2 is real estate. 

00:09:46.255 --> 00:09:49.645
 What I tell young people is, find your game.
