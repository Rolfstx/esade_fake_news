00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.009
And quickly, once you’ve finished this video
there are two others to watch, both where

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.539
I appear on camera for the first time—a
behind the scenes video on my brand new personal

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.150
channel and my appearance on StarTalk with
Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.529
Both are linked in the description.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.880
“Suppose we’re in a cave right now.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.669
This is a cave, and there’s maybe 10 of
us, we have a mini family tribe and I say

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.330
“you know, I want to go out and see what
on the other side of that mountain.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.969
We can see it from here,” and you say, “no,
no we have cave problems we have to fix first.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:45.100
Fix all the cave problems first, then you
can go out on the mountain.”

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.943
And that’s what it sounds like to me when
I hear people say, when we talk about exposing

00:00:48.943 --> 00:00:53.710
space, we have problems on earth, let’s
fix those before we go into space, and here’s

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.230
Earth, a speck of dirt orbiting an ordinary
star and there’s this vastness of the Universe

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:05.760
that is waiting for us.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.020
It beckons.”

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.200
The commercial space industry is heating up.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.520
Fifty years ago outer space was reserved for
the most powerful of nations, the most dominant

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.190
governments, but today there’s a democratization
of space.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.060
Commercial industry is inching us closer to
the cosmos, and in the process, there’s

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.430
a growing interdependence between what’s
happening hundreds of miles up in space and

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.020
down below on earth.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.910
The commercial space industry, using multi-million
dollar satellites and rockets, is increasingly

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.270
playing a part in our everyday lives.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.390
You may think of this industry as a new phenomenon,
you may have only started hearing about profit-seeking

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:53.450
space enterprise in the past few years, but
in reality, this has been going on for decades.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:02:01.610
“Our founder, Walter Scott, founded the
company in his garage in Palo Alto 25 years

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.610
ago.”

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.610
This is Dan Jablonsky.

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.560
He’s President of one of the commercial
space companies that you might not have heard

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.560
of—DigitalGlobe.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.400
They might not be as flashy as SpaceX or as
exciting as Virgin Galactic, but they’ve

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.859
been flying satellites since before Elon Musk
even graduated college.

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:23.340
In fact, they were the very first American
company to be granted a license to take high-resolution

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.849
pictures from space and that is essentially
what they do—they take pictures from space,

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.030
but it’s a lot more complicated than it
sounds.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.890
To take those images from space, you need
satellites, and DigitalGlobe has five of them.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.780
“So the five satellites we have on orbit
are GeoEye 1, WorldView 1, WorldView 2, WorldView

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.519
3, and you’re noticing a trend here, WorldView
4.

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.739
The first of those was launched in 2007.

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:53.390
The most recent was launched in 2016 and they
have an expected life of over ten years each.”

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.180
And these are really good satellites.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.970
WorldView 4, for example, DigitalGlobe’s
newest satellite, has a pixel size of 12 inches.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:08.299
That means that this satellite, orbiting 383
miles above earth, can clearly see a single

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.700
sheet of paper placed in a parking lot.

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.969
Horizontally, that’s like if a camera in
Toronto took a picture that could identify

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.430
the individual eyes of Statue of Liberty in
New York.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.180
It is insanely high resolution.

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.200
“With a 30 cm pixel you can actually pick
up road markings.

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.279
You can see the lines on the roads, whether
they’re straight or dashed lines, you can

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:34.609
see whether there are turn arrows there, whether
there’s a stop word on the road markings,

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:37.950
you can even pick up some of the traffic signs
and traffic light sizes.”

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.629
The potential uses of such high quality imagery
are endless, but how do the satellites even

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:44.629
work?

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.969
“Well first off its good to know that our
satellites are in a low earth orbit which

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:51.519
means that they actually, they’re not like
a geo satellite which sits up in a fixed orbit

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:53.400
and sits over one place in the planet.”

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.310
Some satellites are designed to stay directly
over one position for their whole service

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.310
lives.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.650
Their orbits are significantly higher above
earth so the time it takes them to complete

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.730
an orbit is exactly the same as the time it
takes the earth to make a full rotation so,

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.959
relative to earth, the satellite doesn’t
move at all.

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:16.760
This is incredibly useful for certain uses
like communications.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.360
When a communications company launches a satellite
to broadcast TV or radio or internet, they

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.840
want that satellite to stay over their particular
service area.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.040
DirecTV, for example, the American satellite
TV company, want their satellites to stay

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.470
over the US because that’s their service
area.

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.320
If they weren’t able to put their satellites
into geosynchronous orbit, they would have

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.250
to launch enough satellites to cover the entire
world even if they were only broadcasting

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.440
to the US.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.730
So, DirecTV want their satellites to stay
over one area because they’re broadcasting

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:55.130
to one area, but DigitalGlobe, on the other
hand, want their satellites to move because

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.310
they’re imaging the entire world.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:01.670
“Each of our satellites right now are in
sun synchronous orbits.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.630
So what that means is that the orbital plane
that the satellite is flying around in stays

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.650
in the same orientation relative to the sun
all the time.”

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.290
Simplified, that means that any given satellite
passes over any given location on earth at

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.820
the exact same time every day.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.130
WorldView 3, for example, always orbits above
the points on earth where it’s 10:30 am.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.360
When it passes over Denver, it’s 10:30 in
Denver, when it passes over Paris, it’s

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.020
10:30 in Paris, and when it passes over Tokyo,
it’s 10:30 in Tokyo.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.531
How this works is that essentially, with each
pass over the light side of earth, the orbit

00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:40.280
advances relative to the earth at the same
rate as the sunlight advances.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.840
This orbit type is crucial because a lot of
what satellite imaging is about is detecting

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:51.930
change from day to day, month to month, or
year to year and an image taken at 10:30 am

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.620
is going to look very different than one taken
at 6:00 pm.

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:01.010
This orbit type allows the satellite to pass
over the entirety of earth, once per day at

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:04.610
the same time so the light conditions look
the same.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.340
The satellites do, of course, need to be told
what to do and that all comes down to four

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.280
people in one room.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.080
“So this is our mission operations control
center.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.720
This is where we fly the five satellites on
orbit and really inside this room is what

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:25.620
we consider our time-dominant, real-time activities
from choosing, making the final choices of

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:30.830
what images we’re going to collect in the
next several minutes to the next several hours.”

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.550
These four individuals are controlling billions
of dollars worth of satellites.

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:40.670
This whole company, the thousands of employees
and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:46.620
all exists to organize and fund what these
four individuals are doing—sitting and piloting

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.840
the satellites above in space.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.070
The mission operations center is, of course,
staffed 24/7 since, while it’s nighttime

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.140
in the US, it’s daytime in Asia and Australia.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.720
The satellite vehicle operators’ main task
is to load plans onto the satellites of which

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.120
images to take when, to monitor that the satellites
are operating correctly, and and to assure

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.860
that the satellites won’t collide with other
satellites or space junk.

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.530
These central screens at the front show the
current location of each of the five satellites,

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:18.750
while the one to the left displays other information
such as the total number of times each satellite

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:23.580
has orbited around the earth and how much
time they have until the satellite loses signal.

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.920
You see, in order for satellites to function
they need to be able to communicate with the

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.400
ground and that’s done with ground stations.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:36.490
These antennae communicate to satellites using
what are essentially super-high powered wifi

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.490
signals.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:41.720
The ground stations DigitalGlobe use are able
to receive about a gigabyte of information

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.680
every second from the satellites.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.190
“Each of those antennas around the world
see each satellite several times a day so

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.200
as we go through the day we accumulate about
seven terabytes of raw imagery through that

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.610
gigabit connection.”

00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:59.840
Satellites can only communicate with ground
stations while they have a line-of-sight with

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.090
the antenna so, due to the curvature of the
earth, in the view of any given ground station

00:08:05.090 --> 00:08:08.310
the satellite will eventually dip below the
horizon.

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:12.610
Therefore, each ground station only has a
limited operating range.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.780
The exact locations of ground stations are,
understandably, kept secret but if there was

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.420
one in Germany, for example, it would communicate
with the DigitalGlobe satellites exclusively

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.550
while they passed over Europe.

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:28.270
The fact that these satellites have to, by
nature, pass over the entire world is actually,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.130
however, quite useful.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.840
Not only does this let DigitalGlobe map the
entire world, but they also use this extra

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:37.529
capacity for humanitarian efforts.

00:08:37.529 --> 00:08:42.529
“It’s actually easier for us on the humanitarian
global development side because we have much

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:45.490
more capacity over these areas.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:50.639
There’s a lot more demand for our satellites
over developed countries, for instance, right,

00:08:50.639 --> 00:08:56.199
so people are typically for commercial applications
much more interested in the US or Europe or

00:08:56.199 --> 00:09:02.249
some of these more developed areas versus
sub-saharan Africa where we just generally

00:09:02.249 --> 00:09:06.839
have much more ability to task the constellation
and to collect those imagery so it’s actually

00:09:06.839 --> 00:09:12.000
an opportunity for us to support those use-cases
much more than others.”

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.079
For instance, DigitalGlobe partnered with
the Gates foundation to map every single building

00:09:16.079 --> 00:09:21.220
structure in rural Zambia so aid workers now
know things like how many bed nets, vaccines,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.850
or food to bring to communities that were
previously unmapped.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:30.790
There are few companies the size of commercial
space companies that rely on so few assets.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:36.120
What makes DigitalGlobe, for example, run
are those five satellites and, to get these

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.750
to space, to the place where they make money,
they had to put them on rockets which tend

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.190
to, from time to time, blow up.

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:46.670
“It’s always a bit of a nail biter as
you come up to a launch.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:51.990
We put an enormous capital investment into
the satellites, the launch vehicle, and it

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:56.360
all comes down to a one hour event lifting
off from the ground and going on into orbit

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:00.420
and that can be a little bit of a nerve-racking
period but certainly very exciting at the

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:01.640
same time.”

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:07.279
An average of one in twenty rocket launches
fail and then on top of that, some satellites

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:11.380
fail once they reach orbit which makes the
space business risky.

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:15.699
Companies like DigitalGlobe will therefore
purchase enormously expensive insurance policies

00:10:15.699 --> 00:10:19.970
on their satellites in case the launch or
the satellite itself fails.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:24.300
If they didn’t, one bad launch could spell
the end for the company.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.329
Of course, some launch providers are much
more reliable than others.

00:10:28.329 --> 00:10:32.070
United Launch Alliance, the launch provider
that DigitalGlobe used for their current five

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:36.579
satellites, has not had a launch failure in
its 11 year history.

00:10:36.579 --> 00:10:40.889
Insurance rates for ULA would be relatively
low while insurance rates for a newer launch

00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:45.199
provider, such as Orbital ATK or Blue Origin
would be comparatively high.

00:10:45.199 --> 00:10:50.160
Nonetheless, the cost of newer launch providers
with insurance included is now often less

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.790
than the older, more reliable launch companies.

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:58.100
But how does DigitalGlobe fund their exploits,
what keeps those satellites flying, how do

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.259
they make their money?

00:10:59.259 --> 00:11:02.809
“Our largest customer is the US government
and we have been very proud to be their mission

00:11:02.809 --> 00:11:06.829
partner for over a decade and a half coming
up on two decades now.”

00:11:06.829 --> 00:11:11.810
It used to be that the commercial satellite
industry was essentially focused on one major

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.180
customer—governments.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:19.120
In the past the US government has been the
single largest customer of the few commercial

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.949
space companies there were thanks to its enormous
defense spending, but today as commercial

00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:29.069
customers contract commercial space companies,
the business is spreading globally.

00:11:29.069 --> 00:11:34.279
Over the past decade, the customer base has
become more international and more diversified.

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:40.879
“Our other customers are international customers
who may be US allies or may be technology

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:42.709
companies across the world.

00:11:42.709 --> 00:11:48.209
We go deep in the communications infrastructure,
online mapping, energy industries, mining

00:11:48.209 --> 00:11:50.470
industries, forestry applications…”

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:55.629
There’s really a huge variety of customers,
but the most obvious ones are those mapping

00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:59.560
companies.“If you’ve ever used Google
Maps you’re using our imagery, if you’ve

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.730
ever used Apple Maps you’re using our imagery,
if you ever look and do crowdsourcing projects

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:10.420
in OpenStreetMap you’re using our imagery
as well,” but perhaps the single most promising

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.029
use of earth imagery is with autonomous vehicles.

00:12:14.029 --> 00:12:20.170
Having good, solid, current satellite imagery
is an integral part of how autonomous vehicles

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.170
work.

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:25.949
These vehicles can’t just rely on their
internal sensors to understand their surroundings—they

00:12:25.949 --> 00:12:27.580
need a view from above.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:33.829
“As we think about autonomous vehicles it’s
not ok to update the image once a quarter,

00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:36.670
once a year, even once a week.

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:41.430
It needs to be, they really need imagery that’s
coming in much much faster than that to deal

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:46.760
with changes in traffic conditions, changes
in roads, crashes, etc.”

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.369
Uber, which is developing autonomous cars,
is already a customer of DigitalGlobe for

00:12:51.369 --> 00:12:56.370
navigation purposes and as more and more companies
move into the autonomous vehicle race, the

00:12:56.370 --> 00:13:01.050
competition between earth observation companies
for their business is likely to heat up.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:05.850
There are plenty of other emerging uses as
well which, as an ensemble, are growing the

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:08.499
demand for earth imagery day by day.

00:13:08.499 --> 00:13:12.149
It is a tremendously fast growing industry.

00:13:12.149 --> 00:13:15.579
But satellite imagery by itself really isn’t
worth much.

00:13:15.579 --> 00:13:16.870
You need something more.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:24.029
“I would say that our customers are demanding
more actionable information faster than ever.”

00:13:24.029 --> 00:13:26.579
Translation: customers want data.

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:30.420
They want the information embedded in the
images.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:33.019
For that, there’s another company—Radiant
Solutions.

00:13:33.019 --> 00:13:39.639
“So today customers, the big challenge is
around, where it used to be more of, ‘hey

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:43.910
we just need to get an answer now,’ now
it’s more of ‘how do we deal with all

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:47.240
this data’ and ‘how do we deal with the
more complex questions,’ because they are

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.759
getting more complex and they’re getting
even harder to answer nowadays by virtue of

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:53.480
being inundated with data.”

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:58.300
Radiant Solutions would describe themselves
as a geospatial analytics company—they take

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.190
satellite imagery and translate it into information.

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:05.749
“We're able to take in vast amount of data
and make sense of it to produce insight.”

00:14:05.749 --> 00:14:08.209
They answer big questions.

00:14:08.209 --> 00:14:12.740
A logging company might ask a question like,
“what’s the density of trees in this particular

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.279
region of Canada,” before purchasing new
land and Radiant would be able to look at

00:14:17.279 --> 00:14:22.439
hundreds or thousands or millions of square
miles of imagery to tell them how many trees

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:23.439
there are.

00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:29.139
Now, with so much imagery and such a big world,
you can’t just do this all by hand, at least

00:14:29.139 --> 00:14:30.139
economically.

00:14:30.139 --> 00:14:34.700
For that reason, there’s been a huge shift
in the geospatial analytics business towards

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.249
using artificial intelligence.

00:14:36.249 --> 00:14:39.860
“We hear more and more now that data is
kind of like the new oil.

00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:45.070
Well that’s sort of true but the data has
to be reliable, it has to be high confidence

00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:46.629
in the data."

00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:48.009
So the AI has to be good.

00:14:48.009 --> 00:14:52.250
To train a machine to find a red car, for
example, you need to show it thousands or

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:57.990
millions of examples of what a red car looks
like, but “It’s very different for a machine

00:14:57.990 --> 00:15:02.300
to look for a red car in an urban environment
as it is to find a red car in snow.

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:07.530
So not only are you training those models
on how to find the object, you have to train

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.019
it on where to find it regionally.”

00:15:10.019 --> 00:15:16.259
It is hugely complicated, but that’s why
these guys are in business—to answer complicated

00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:17.499
questions.

00:15:17.499 --> 00:15:20.850
Some data, however, isn’t in the visual
spectrum.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:25.560
Some data is hidden, but luckily, there’s
a special satellite just for that.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:30.389
“In the old days it was just please get
me good, solid image pixels to use, and I’ll

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:32.170
go figure out how to use them.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:36.920
Today, particularly in commercial space, it's
all about information.”

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.999
That’s Paul Kennedy, Vice President of Ground
Systems at MDA.

00:15:40.999 --> 00:15:44.329
They’ve been in business since 1969.

00:15:44.329 --> 00:15:48.869
Their most visible project was on developing
the Canadarm for the Space Shuttles and International

00:15:48.869 --> 00:15:49.970
Space Station.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:54.379
As a long-time player in the industry, they
serve a variety of functions from developing

00:15:54.379 --> 00:15:59.470
space robotics to building satellite ground
stations, but one of their most valuable assets

00:15:59.470 --> 00:16:02.809
is that special satellite—Radarsat-2.

00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:07.439
While most earth observation satellites image
using the visual spectrum, what we can see

00:16:07.439 --> 00:16:10.970
with our own eyes, Radarsat-2 uses radar.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:19.059
“Radar is an active pulse so the satellite
actually sends a beam of energy to the ground

00:16:19.059 --> 00:16:27.180
and reads back what it gets back from the
earth and that gives us a couple of interesting

00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.800
advantages in SAR.”

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.910
For one, radar can see through clouds and
darkness.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:38.079
It doesn’t matter what the light and weather
conditions are, it’s all the same for Radarsat-2.

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:44.319
Now, MDA is a Canadian company, and it’s
no coincidence that a Canadian company operates

00:16:44.319 --> 00:16:45.529
this satellite.

00:16:45.529 --> 00:16:50.199
Just like the US government is a major customer
of DigitalGlobe, the Canadian government is

00:16:50.199 --> 00:16:55.540
a major customer of MDA, and here’s the
thing about Canada—the weather is terrible

00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:00.399
and it’s always dark, quite literally in
Northern Canada where the sun stays down for

00:17:00.399 --> 00:17:01.639
the entire winter.

00:17:01.639 --> 00:17:05.929
It’s no coincidence that the company that
works so closely with the Canadian government

00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:09.529
operates the satellite that can see through
clouds and night.

00:17:09.529 --> 00:17:13.970
Without Radarsat-2, the Canadian government
would be blind—they would have no way of

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:19.449
monitoring huge swaths of their territory
in the high arctic for months out of the year.

00:17:19.449 --> 00:17:24.149
With new launch providers emerging such as
Blue Origin and RocketLab and SpaceX, the

00:17:24.149 --> 00:17:27.600
cost of launching material into space is plummeting.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:32.220
Now, this is useful to these companies, at
least in some ways.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:36.650
With lower launch costs, DigitalGlobe and
MDA can launch more satellites which means

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:42.090
more data for Radiant solutions, but that
also makes it easier for competitors to launch

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.090
satellites.

00:17:43.090 --> 00:17:47.080
The earth imagery business is growing, but
so is the competition.

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.410
The best known earth imagery start-up, Planet,
is launching a constellation of small satellites.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:57.020
While DigitalGlobe’s satellites are the
size of a bus, Planet’s smallest are the

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:59.100
size of a toaster.

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:02.570
With the smaller size, development and launch
costs are lower.

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:07.390
While in the past starting a space imagery
company required hundreds of millions or billions

00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:12.950
of dollars in funding, the emergence of small-sats
means that it’s enormously easier to break

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.830
into the satellite imagery business nowadays.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:19.340
But there is a key difference between these
two companies.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:24.620
DigitalGlobe’s satellites capture imagery
with a pixel size of 12 inches while Planet’s

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:30.059
primary satellite constellation captures imagery
with a pixel size of 10-15 feet at a much

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:31.340
lower cost.

00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:35.570
There are certain uses for high-resolution
imagery and there are certain other uses for

00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:41.169
low-cost imagery so in some ways, these two
companies aren’t even direct competitors.

00:18:41.169 --> 00:18:46.360
Nonetheless, the space industry is changing,
growing, and becoming more competitive so

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.160
the established companies needs to adapt.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:54.700
United Launch Alliance knows that, Airbus
knows that, Arianespace knows that, and DigitalGlobe,

00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.860
MDA, and Radiant know that too, so they made
a change.

00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:00.950
These three companies are now one.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:05.659
Along with a forth company, a spacecraft manufacturing
company called SSL that will be covered in

00:19:05.659 --> 00:19:11.450
a future video, these are the entities that
make up the newest powerhouse in the space

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:12.500
technology business.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.890
This merger wasn’t necessarily in response
to heavy competition, but rather, at least

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:22.000
from an outsiders perspective, a preemptive
strike to establish themselves as a major

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.980
international player before the commercial
space industry truly lifts off.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:33.130
“Increasingly, the more traditional aerospace
and defense companies that have been supplying

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:41.170
technology in space have been able to provide
the performance but the cost has been extremely

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.170
high.”

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:45.660
Maxar is now a fully vertically integrated
company.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:49.760
In the earth imagery space, for example, they’ll
do everything from building satellites, to

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.679
operating them, to extracting data from imagery.

00:19:52.679 --> 00:19:57.269
By performing all the steps in the process
internally, Maxar lowers its costs and this

00:19:57.269 --> 00:20:02.510
also puts them in the same league as Airbus
as one of the very few end-to-end integrated

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:04.380
space companies.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.389
The commercial space industry as a whole is
doing a phenomenal job of making access to

00:20:09.389 --> 00:20:11.429
orbital space commonplace.

00:20:11.429 --> 00:20:21.110
“The routine steps of space activities are
slowly being ceded to private enterprise that

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:22.669
can do it faster, better, cheaper.”

00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:27.299
We’re now at a place where launching a satellite
to low earth orbit is unexceptional.

00:20:27.299 --> 00:20:32.620
That’s exactly what we want, easy access
to space, and, for near space, that exists

00:20:32.620 --> 00:20:33.950
right now.

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:39.400
Getting beyond earth’s orbit, though, outside
our cosmic neighborhood, into deep space,

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.250
that’s still tough.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:46.740
The problem is that private enterprise, by
it’s very nature, needs to make money.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:50.260
Companies and their leaders are beholden to
their investors to make money.

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.900
If they’re not, then they’re not a company.

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:57.990
Companies can and do make money with deep
space but only through developing and building

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:00.769
technology for NASA and other government agencies.

00:21:00.769 --> 00:21:05.460
There is zero commercial demand for deep space
technology today.

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:11.611
Going to new planets, to new solar systems,
exploring space—that really doesn’t make

00:21:11.611 --> 00:21:12.611
money.

00:21:12.611 --> 00:21:17.289
“Many people who think about commercial
space, I think they’re over predicting what

00:21:17.289 --> 00:21:18.389
their role will be.

00:21:18.389 --> 00:21:23.090
They’re imagining commercial space leading
a space frontier, but to lead a space frontier

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:28.120
is expensive, and it’s not an obvious return
on the investment.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.360
You might do it as a vanity project, there
are enough billionaires that could all pool

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:40.149
their money, Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, Elon
Musk, they could do a vanity project and send

00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:42.090
humans to Mars, let’s say.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:47.210
But it’s not a business model and it would
get a lot of attention but, is that something

00:21:47.210 --> 00:21:48.299
you can sustain?

00:21:48.299 --> 00:21:51.090
No, it would be a one-off.

00:21:51.090 --> 00:21:56.870
When people imagine a future of space and
industry they’re imagining a sustained business

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:57.870
case.”

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:03.060
Of course, you could’ve said the same about
the space-race sixty years ago—that was

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:08.980
exploration however, in the long term, it
was an investment that paid off because space

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:10.789
now makes money.

00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:18.620
“Space today is an integral part of what
we know and what we can do on the planet.

00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:28.130
Communications, imagery, climate science,
defense and intelligence, and security applications—all

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:36.429
of those are seamlessly enabled by space technologies
without most of us going about our daily lives

00:22:36.429 --> 00:22:38.809
even thinking about it.”

00:22:38.809 --> 00:22:43.159
The difference between commercial enterprise
and governments is time.

00:22:43.159 --> 00:22:47.510
Commercial enterprises need to think about
investments that pay off within the lifetime

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:48.510
of their shareholders.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:53.899
“So you’re always thinking about, what
is the return on investment you’re making,

00:22:53.899 --> 00:22:59.730
how long will it take you to achieve the returns
on your investment, and what’s the probability

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:03.220
that the R&amp;D that you’re putting in will
be successful.”

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:04.220
“If you take cues from history, the government
does what hasn’t been done before and private

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.220
enterprise does what’s routine.”

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:08.600
While companies look at investments in terms
of years, governments can look at investments

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:14.260
in terms of decades or centuries because governments
transcend generations.

00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:18.650
The innovation that will occur by bringing
humans to Mars and beyond will absolutely

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:24.090
make money in the very long term, but right
now, it would take an enormous amount of money

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.320
that few people want to risk.

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:30.799
You could point to Elon Musk as an exception
to this rule, he more than anyone understands

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:35.830
the value of super long-term investments like
going to Mars, but he also understands that

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.769
he’s alone in that.

00:23:37.769 --> 00:23:41.909
Individuals don’t want to invest in something
that won’t make money until after they're

00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:42.909
dead.

00:23:42.909 --> 00:23:48.159
Musk has stated that he has no plans to take
SpaceX public until after a successful mission

00:23:48.159 --> 00:23:53.940
to Mars which means that, for the moment,
the company is almost acting more as an organization.

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.710
He’s funneling the money from launches,
which make money, into exploration, which

00:23:58.710 --> 00:23:59.710
doesn’t.

00:23:59.710 --> 00:24:05.320
“Governments need to lead the way because
they have the longer time horizons that they

00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.600
can think about and monetize.

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:14.710
When they do that, once they lead the way
they have now quantified the risks, and you

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:19.830
know the cost, and where the friendlies are
and where the hostiles—whatever are the

00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:24.180
things that would compromise your mission
they’ve already figured this out.

00:24:24.180 --> 00:24:28.960
Then if they do it right, you then hand that
to private industry that makes a buck off

00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:32.549
of it then the government can tax that if
they so choose.”

00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:37.480
Maxar Technologies and its four businesses,
meanwhile, absolutely innovate including in

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.889
deep space technologies, but they’re not
going to put the pieces together to go to

00:24:41.889 --> 00:24:46.320
Mars by themselves because that’s not a
good investment.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:50.759
One should be careful to realize that this
coming era of commercialized space does not

00:24:50.759 --> 00:24:54.940
necessarily translate into a renaissance of
space exploration.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:00.640
Commercial industry is not a substitute for
NASA or the ESA or any other government institution.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.620
They are collaborators, they can make the
government’s job easier and cheaper, but

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.679
they cannot replace those whose jobs are to
go where no human has gone before.

00:25:10.679 --> 00:25:17.000
The next few decades and centuries can be
the era of space exploration, but for that,

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.370
you need a public, you need an electorate
that understands anything good, anything truly

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:27.120
worthwhile takes time.

00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.100
There are so many thanks I have to give for
help with this video, but one is to Away not

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.410
only for making this video possible through
sponsorship, but also for literally carrying

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:42.020
my possessions over the 15,000 miles I travelled
while making this video… and unfortunately

00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:43.380
that number is not a mistake.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:47.650
I’ve now owned my Away suitcase for almost
a year, have travelled all around the world

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.460
with it, and I love it.

00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:54.640
The suitcase is just solidly built, you can
feel it, and has a built in yet removable

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:59.700
battery, a laundry bag, a laptop sleeve, and
a compression system so you can pack more

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.350
in a smaller space.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:05.970
Best of all, for how good it is, the Away
suitcase is sold for an amazing price and

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:11.850
its at an even more amazing price if you go
to awaytravel.com/wendover and use the code

00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:15.990
“wendover” at check-out to get $20 off
your Away suitcase.

00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:21.240
They’re so confident you’ll love the product
that all Away suitcases have a lifetime warranty

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.870
and 100 day unconditional return policy.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:29.170
It’s quite literally no risk and they made
this enormous video possible so if you need

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:35.309
a suitcase for life, check out awaytravel.com/wendover
and use the code “wendover” at checkout.

00:26:35.309 --> 00:26:40.380
I also have to give a huge thanks to Maxar
Technologies, especially Kristin Carringer

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:45.429
and Turner Brinton, for letting me film this
video, as it takes an enormous amount of work

00:26:45.429 --> 00:26:48.769
to allow cameras into such a high security
environment.

00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:53.240
Lastly, as I mentioned at the beginning, I
appeared on Neil deGrasse Tyson’s show StarTalk

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:57.780
and also launched a new personal channel where
I made a behind the scenes video for that

00:26:57.780 --> 00:26:58.780
appearance.

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.320
Both are linked in the description and on-screen
now.

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:05.289
Thanks again for watching and I’ll see you
again in three weeks for another Wendover

00:27:05.289 --> 00:27:06.459
Productions video.
