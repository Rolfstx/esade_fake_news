(gentle music)

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:20.253 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Frank Abagnale,
thanks for joining us

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:21.521 line:0%
on Prairie Pulse,

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:22.655
a pleasure to have
you with us today.

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:23.857 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Thank you,
pleasure to be here.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.358 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Before we get
into our discussion

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.694
I just want to read a bit
from a brief bio of you

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.229
to sort of set the scene here,

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:31.765 align:start size:84% position:16%
because your life
is very interesting.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.800
Frank W. Abagnale is
one of the world's

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.970
most respected authorities
on forgery, embezzlement,

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.805
and secure documents.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.875 align:start size:88% position:13%
For over 40 years he has
worked with, advised,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:44.811
and consulted with hundreds
of financial institutions,

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:48.448
corporations, and government
agencies around the world.

00:00:48.448 --> 00:00:51.551
Mr. Abagnale's rare blend
of knowledge and expertise

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:55.355
began more than 45 years
ago when he was known as

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:58.391
one of the world's most
famous confidence men.

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
Any holes we should fill
in in that brief bio?

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:05.298 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- People I know are
fascinated by what I did

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:07.133 line:0%
between 16 and 21.

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:11.037
I'm 70 and so when I
look back on my life

00:01:11.037 --> 00:01:13.940
I'm fascinated by the
fact that I did it.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.110
Served my time in prison,
I've worked for the FBI

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.481 align:start size:94% position:6%
for four decades and
have spent my entire life

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.684 align:start size:94% position:6%
dealing with fighting
crime and educating people

00:01:24.684 --> 00:01:27.720
about dealing with
all types of crimes.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.890
Been married to my one and
only wife for 40-plus years.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.826
Three sons, five grandchildren.

00:01:32.826 --> 00:01:34.828
A son who's an FBI agent.

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:37.230 align:start size:84% position:16%
A kind of amazing
other side of my life

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.165
than the side people
know from the movie.

00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.701 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Doug] Well those
five years from 16 to 21

00:01:41.701 --> 00:01:44.571 align:start size:94% position:6%
were filled with some very
interesting adventures.

00:01:44.571 --> 00:01:48.341 align:start size:97% position:3%
You impersonated an
airline pilot, a physician,

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:51.077 align:start size:84% position:16%
an attorney, and a
federal prisons agent.

00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:53.246 align:start size:84% position:16%
So let's talk about
the pilot one,

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:56.416
just to set the scene for how
you did this kind of thing.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.184
- Well you know,
people always say

00:01:58.184 --> 00:02:00.920
that they thought I was
brilliant when in fact

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.357
I was just an adolescent, so
I had no fear of being caught.

00:02:04.357 --> 00:02:06.459
I never premeditated anything.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.096
I had ran away from home
at 16, back in the '60s

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:12.298
a lot of kids ran away from
home but they got caught up

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:15.135 align:start size:97% position:3%
in Haight-Ashbury, the
hippie scene, the drug scene.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:16.870
I ended up on the
streets in New York

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.539
and didn't have any money,
I kind of quickly realized

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.208 align:start size:84% position:16%
that as long as people
believed I was 16

00:02:22.208 --> 00:02:23.710
I wasn't going to get anywhere.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.979
So the first thing I did was
alter my driver's license.

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.448
Back then didn't
have a photo on it.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.583
It was just an IBM card
so I altered one digit

00:02:30.583 --> 00:02:32.118
of my date of birth.

00:02:32.118 --> 00:02:35.522
I was actually born in April
of 1948, I dropped the four,

00:02:35.522 --> 00:02:37.323
converted it to it three.

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:39.792
So that made me 26 years old.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.262
And I started writing checks.

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:43.930 align:start size:84% position:16%
I had an account,
when the money ran out

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.799 align:start size:94% position:6%
I kept writing the
checks to support myself.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.802 align:start size:88% position:13%
And one day I was
walking down the street

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:52.472 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I saw an airline
crew come out of a hotel,

00:02:52.472 --> 00:02:56.075
and I thought to myself if
I could get that uniform,

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:58.144
then when I walked into a bank

00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.179 align:start size:84% position:16%
it would give so
much more credibility

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.914
to asking to cash a check.

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:04.717
And that was the sole purpose
of it, nothing more than that.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.587 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I was able to finagle
getting a uniform,

00:03:07.587 --> 00:03:09.989 align:start size:81% position:19%
once I got the
uniform I realized

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.025 align:start size:84% position:16%
that you could
actually board planes

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.094
and ride on planes for
free in the jump seat.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.797
So I did that and I was
able to stay in hotels

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:19.832 align:start size:84% position:16%
and bill the
airline for my room.

00:03:19.832 --> 00:03:23.770 align:start size:84% position:16%
So by the two
years from 16 to 18

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.638
I flew in more than 260 aircraft

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:28.608 align:start size:94% position:6%
in more than 62 countries
around the world.

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:31.644
Just riding the jump seat
and posing as a pilot.

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:34.280
But it started out as more
of a front for the checks

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.549 align:start size:81% position:19%
and then every
time I moved along

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.351
something else would come up

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.786
and I was somewhat
of an opportunist,

00:03:39.786 --> 00:03:41.654 align:start size:97% position:3%
so I saw it as an
opportunity and I took that

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:42.889
to the next step.

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.191 line:0%
- [Mill] Was there a
thrill in it for you?

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.926 line:0%
- Not so much the thrill
as a more of a survival

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:50.530 line:0%
and running from the law
and how to avoid the law.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.632
I could travel around the
world without a passport

00:03:52.632 --> 00:03:54.934
on an airline crew card.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:58.438
There were a lot of reasons
I did it other than just,

00:03:58.438 --> 00:04:00.506
I don't think there was
ever really a thrill,

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:02.842 align:start size:97% position:3%
it was more about just staying
one step ahead of the law

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:06.079
and staying one step
of trying to survive.

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.381
- Were you ever in the cockpit?

00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:11.284
- Many many times, most of
the time in the cockpit,

00:04:11.284 --> 00:04:12.819
but in the jump seat.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.421 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was smart enough
never to ride on Pan Am,

00:04:15.421 --> 00:04:17.724
which was the pilot
I was posing as,

00:04:17.724 --> 00:04:19.192
because I was always afraid

00:04:19.192 --> 00:04:21.861
someone would start asking
me questions about who I knew

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.696
and where I was based.

00:04:23.696 --> 00:04:25.598
So I always rode
on other carriers.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.634
And then I also knew
they would never ask me

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:29.402 align:start size:81% position:19%
to do any function
in the cockpit,

00:04:29.402 --> 00:04:33.172
since I was a pilot riding the
jump seat on another carrier.

00:04:33.172 --> 00:04:35.108 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I always put
those things in place

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:37.176
so that I didn't get
myself in a situation

00:04:37.176 --> 00:04:38.511
I couldn't get out of.

00:04:38.511 --> 00:04:40.647 align:start position:0%
- [Doug] Well, you impersonated
a physician as well,

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:43.850 align:start size:97% position:3%
so how did you protect
other people from yourself?

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.686 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Again, the same thing,
I moved to Atlanta,

00:04:46.686 --> 00:04:48.821
and I moved into an
apartment complex.

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.757
On the application
it asked profession,

00:04:50.757 --> 00:04:53.459
so I didn't want to
put airline pilot

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.861
because the police
were looking for me,

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:57.530
so I put down doctor
and left it at that.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.532 align:start size:84% position:16%
Had a very inquisitive
apartment manager

00:04:59.532 --> 00:05:01.167 align:start size:84% position:16%
who asked me what
kind of doctor I was,

00:05:01.167 --> 00:05:05.071 align:start size:97% position:3%
so I said pediatrician because
it was a singles complex

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:06.773
and there were no
children there.

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:09.909
And then the next thing you
know I met a pediatrician

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.377
who lived there.

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.479 align:start size:94% position:6%
I got to know him he took
me up to the hospital

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:14.781
to meet people.

00:05:14.781 --> 00:05:17.350 align:start size:88% position:13%
And then one day he
asked me if I would mind

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.852
covering a shift at the
hospital for two weeks

00:05:19.852 --> 00:05:22.789
while a doctor had gone
home because of a death,

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.091 align:start size:88% position:13%
and that it was an
administrative position,

00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:26.893
didn't have to treat anybody.

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:29.162
And so again I saw it
more as a challenge

00:05:29.162 --> 00:05:30.697
to see if I could get
away with doing it,

00:05:30.697 --> 00:05:34.000
so I went to the hospital
and worked in the hospital.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.370 align:start position:0%
In the hospital and the lawyer,
no one really ever doubted

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.106
I was not that person, it
was I who left on my own.

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:41.674
- [Doug] Nobody said,
here's an emergency,

00:05:41.674 --> 00:05:43.209
it's time for you to--

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:45.011
- No, because it was mainly
an administrative position,

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:48.314 align:start position:0%
so I kind of just administrated
the staff on my shift,

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:50.383 align:start size:84% position:16%
so it wasn't a very
difficult thing to do.

00:05:50.383 --> 00:05:52.518
- [Doug] Well, you were
ultimately apprehended

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.320
at a pretty tender age, 21.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.722 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Yes.
- In Europe.

00:05:55.722 --> 00:05:58.291
- I was arrested by
the French police

00:05:58.291 --> 00:05:59.692
when I was 21 years old,

00:05:59.692 --> 00:06:02.195 align:start position:0%
actually on an Interpol
warrant from the Swedish police

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:05.098
who were looking for me
for forgery in Sweden,

00:06:05.098 --> 00:06:07.567
but they believed I
was living in France.

00:06:07.567 --> 00:06:09.635 align:start position:0%
But when the French authorities
took me into custody

00:06:09.635 --> 00:06:12.505
on the Swedish warrant they
realized I had forged checks

00:06:12.505 --> 00:06:15.475 align:start size:97% position:3%
all over France, so they
refused to honor the warrant

00:06:15.475 --> 00:06:17.610 align:start size:81% position:19%
and they requested
my extradition.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.545 align:start size:88% position:13%
And they later
convicted me of forgery

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:21.547
and sent me to French prison.

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.516
I eventually served
my time in France,

00:06:23.516 --> 00:06:25.084
was extradited to Sweden,

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:27.253
where I served time in
a Swedish penitentiary

00:06:27.253 --> 00:06:29.021
in Malmo, Sweden.

00:06:29.021 --> 00:06:31.190
When my sentence was up,
US federal authorities

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:33.659 align:start size:97% position:3%
took custody of me, returned
me to the United States,

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.995
and eventually a United
States federal judge

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:38.164
in Atlanta Georgia sentenced me

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:41.334
to 12 years in federal prison.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:43.669 align:start size:88% position:13%
I served about four
years of those 12 years

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:46.639
at a federal prison in
Petersburg, Virginia.

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:49.008
When I was 26 years old
the government offered to

00:06:49.008 --> 00:06:50.977 align:start size:84% position:16%
take me out of prison
on the condition

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:53.713 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'd go to work with an agency
of the federal government

00:06:53.713 --> 00:06:55.047
for the remainder of my sentence

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:58.017
or until my parole
had been completed.

00:06:58.017 --> 00:07:02.889
I agreed and I've spent the
last four decades at the FBI.

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.958 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So you're put in
prison at the age of 21.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.662
And ultimately you come out
of prison helping the FBI

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:11.531
and the federal government.

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:13.399
How did that happen?

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.736 line:0%
- Two reasons, at the time,
this was right after Hoover,

00:07:16.736 --> 00:07:19.071 line:0%
Clarence Kelly was the
director of the Bureau.

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.542
I think one, to teach
agents at the academy

00:07:22.542 --> 00:07:25.611 align:start size:84% position:16%
where I've taught
for four decades now.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.213
I had to go out in the
field and teach agents

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:28.948
how to think out of the box,

00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:31.884
how to look at things not
just as black and white,

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:33.686
how to deal with
social engineering,

00:07:33.686 --> 00:07:36.189 align:start size:84% position:16%
so that they can use
it in a legal way

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:37.657
to gather information.

00:07:37.657 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
And also in the first
part of my career

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.695
I did a lot of undercover work,

00:07:42.695 --> 00:07:45.097 align:start size:84% position:16%
mainly because the
bureau could say to me

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:47.266
I need you to be this
particular person,

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:48.935
a lieutenant in the Army.

00:07:48.935 --> 00:07:52.004 align:start size:84% position:16%
Your expertise is this
particular missile.

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.606 align:start size:81% position:19%
I need you to know
enough about it

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:56.075
to go onto this base and
find out what's going on

00:07:56.075 --> 00:07:58.277
about whatever it
might be the event.

00:07:58.277 --> 00:08:01.380
So I think a lot of it was
all of those things combined.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:03.950
I don't think they ever
dreamed or I ever dreamed

00:08:03.950 --> 00:08:07.987
I would stay there more than
the allotted time of my parole,

00:08:07.987 --> 00:08:12.325 align:start size:97% position:3%
but when my parole was up
and the court order was over,

00:08:12.325 --> 00:08:14.627
they asked me to
stay and I stayed

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:15.828
and have been there ever since.

00:08:15.828 --> 00:08:17.563
- In the course of your
doing time in prison

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:20.633
and subsequently working
with the federal government

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:24.670
on various security
issues have you ever,

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:26.172
over the course of your life,

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:30.810 align:start size:97% position:3%
had the occasion to sort of
look inwardly and ask yourself

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.612
why did I do this?

00:08:32.612 --> 00:08:35.715 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I think it was just
more about being a runaway

00:08:35.715 --> 00:08:38.084 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then thinking
about how to survive,

00:08:38.084 --> 00:08:40.119
and those kind of things.

00:08:40.119 --> 00:08:42.688
I think it was more about that
there was no real motivation

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:45.458
to want to be a pilot, be
a doctor, or be a lawyer.

00:08:45.458 --> 00:08:47.627
All of those things I
fell into, the lawyer,

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:51.030
I met a girl whose father
was the Attorney General

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.600
in Louisiana and I
ended up telling her

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.103
I had a law degree.

00:08:57.103 --> 00:09:00.039
As I went to Louisiana
I actually took the bar,

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:03.743 align:start position:0%
I passed the bar, so I
practiced law there for a while.

00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:06.812
I think it was all a matter
of just going on knowing

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.614
that sooner or later
I would get caught.

00:09:08.614 --> 00:09:12.385
I always knew I'd get caught,
it was just a matter of time.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.221 align:start position:0%
But it was just a matter of
how long I could stretch it out

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.323
and how long I could
just keep going along

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:18.824
and just encountered things.

00:09:19.959 --> 00:09:21.661 align:start size:84% position:16%
And again very much
an opportunist,

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:23.796
very much an adolescent who
had no fear of being caught.

00:09:23.796 --> 00:09:26.165
Didn't think of
the consequences.

00:09:26.165 --> 00:09:27.867
Didn't premeditate anything,

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.535
if I was standing out
in front of a bank

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:32.705
with a check for $500,
I didn't have a plan,

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:35.708
I didn't say I was going to
go in and if they say this

00:09:35.708 --> 00:09:38.311
I'll do this if they
do that I'll do that.

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:39.879 align:start size:81% position:19%
I just simply went
in and did it,

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.814
so everything was kind
of ad-libbed and I think

00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:43.783 align:start size:81% position:19%
that was very much
the adolescent.

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:47.086 align:start size:97% position:3%
But I think the adolescent was
why I was successful at it.

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.989 align:start size:88% position:13%
Had I been a little
smarter, a little older,

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:52.158
I think I would have
started to rationalize

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:54.727
and say you'll never get away
with that, you can't do that,

00:09:54.727 --> 00:09:56.762 align:start size:81% position:19%
and I probably
wouldn't have done

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.030
half the things that I did.

00:09:58.030 --> 00:09:59.732
- [Doug] Well it sounds
like you were following

00:09:59.732 --> 00:10:03.035 align:start size:97% position:3%
the KISS principle, the keep
it simple principle here,

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:05.705
in terms of hoodwinking people.

00:10:05.705 --> 00:10:07.173
Is that your message

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:10.242 align:start size:94% position:6%
when you're talking to
people in law enforcement,

00:10:10.242 --> 00:10:12.311
don't get too complicated?

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:15.147 line:0%
- Yeah a lot of it is, you
know my career has changed

00:10:15.147 --> 00:10:17.316 line:0%
in the 40 years that I've
worked with the Bureau.

00:10:17.316 --> 00:10:20.453 line:0%
I started out dealing with
counterfeits and forgeries

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:23.322
and embezzlement,
financial crimes.

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:25.424 align:start size:81% position:19%
The last 20 years,
my whole career

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:28.628 align:start size:97% position:3%
has been about cyber-related
crimes and the Internet

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:31.697
and breaches and so
I've had to change

00:10:31.697 --> 00:10:33.199
just as crime has changed.

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:36.369 align:start size:97% position:3%
I've had to learn how
criminals commit those crimes

00:10:36.369 --> 00:10:41.107
and then find out how to do
the investigative end of that

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:45.144
and how to teach agents how
to look into those crimes.

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:47.413
So my career's changed
a lot in the 40 years

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:48.748
just as crime has changed

00:10:48.748 --> 00:10:51.517 align:start size:88% position:13%
because it's constantly
changing every day.

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:55.054
So a good example is I've
spent the last 40 years,

00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:58.124 align:start size:88% position:13%
when I do go outside
the government to speak,

00:10:58.124 --> 00:11:02.328
mainly to banks, financial
institutions, corporations.

00:11:02.328 --> 00:11:04.530
I think when I was in
North Dakota in '08,

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.999
I was here for US Bank,

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.135
and they invited their
corporate customers,

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:11.537
came back in '14 for
the Chamber of Commerce

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:13.739 align:start size:88% position:13%
because the United
States attorney asked me

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:17.710
to come and do a presentation
for all the businesses here.

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.646
But in the last of four years
I've got involved very much

00:11:20.646 --> 00:11:22.581
with crimes against the elderly.

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:25.718
And so I've been working
very closely with AARP.

00:11:25.718 --> 00:11:28.320
And they take me out
about 15 times a year,

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.090 align:start size:84% position:16%
we've been to about
38 states now,

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.027
to reach thousands of people
and basically seniors mostly,

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:38.297
to teach them about how not to
be hoodwinked by these scams,

00:11:38.297 --> 00:11:41.367
sweepstakes scams, Internet
scams, grandparent scams,

00:11:41.367 --> 00:11:44.670 align:start size:84% position:16%
all kinds of telephone
robo-call scams.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.939
So I'm a big believer,
and I've always been

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:49.241
in all the books I've
written over my career,

00:11:49.241 --> 00:11:52.411
all revolve around education
being the most powerful tool

00:11:52.411 --> 00:11:53.779
to fighting crime.

00:11:53.779 --> 00:11:56.148
So I think it's simply
if you explain to people

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:58.718 align:start size:97% position:3%
how the scam works, when
they get that next phone call

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:01.187 align:start size:94% position:6%
they get that next
letter or the next email,

00:12:01.187 --> 00:12:03.856
they know how to deal with that.

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:05.558
- [Doug] If it sounds
too good to be true

00:12:05.558 --> 00:12:06.792
it probably is.
- That's right.

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:09.228 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You have a company,
Abagnale and Associates,

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:12.665 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you specialize in
financial fraud consultancy.

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:15.901 align:start position:0%
You're in North Dakota visiting
Fargo because of the AARP

00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:18.871
and the Fargo Moorhead West
Fargo Chamber of Commerce.

00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:22.441
What are the central messages
you share with your clients?

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:24.577
- Well, two things
we'll do here tonight

00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:27.213 align:start size:97% position:3%
because a lot of our
audience will be businesses

00:12:27.213 --> 00:12:31.817 align:start size:84% position:16%
invited by the Chamber
and regular folks
and seniors as well

00:12:31.817 --> 00:12:33.853 align:start size:81% position:19%
so it'll be an
awareness program,

00:12:33.853 --> 00:12:36.021 align:start size:88% position:13%
this will be a
PowerPoint presentation

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:39.825 align:start size:97% position:3%
where I will talk about
identity theft and breaches

00:12:39.825 --> 00:12:42.828 align:start size:94% position:6%
and protecting your
identity and the Internet

00:12:42.828 --> 00:12:46.332
and social media and how
to protect your children

00:12:46.332 --> 00:12:49.535 align:start position:0%
on social media, so it's pretty
much an awareness program

00:12:49.535 --> 00:12:51.771
so that people walk away
with a lot of information

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:53.239
about a lot of different things

00:12:53.239 --> 00:12:56.275 align:start position:0%
not only to protect their
business, protect their family,

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:59.145
protect their children but
also protect their assets.

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:02.681 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it'll be entertaining
but very educational

00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:04.683
and will give them
the necessary tools

00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:06.819
to take back and use.

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.687
And what I do is
I have a website,

00:13:08.687 --> 00:13:10.890
it's just my name, abagnale.com,

00:13:10.890 --> 00:13:14.126 align:start size:97% position:3%
obviously I sell no products,
I provide no services.

00:13:14.126 --> 00:13:16.262
It is strictly an
educational site.

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:18.097
So we refer people to that

00:13:18.097 --> 00:13:19.932
because there's so much
information to cover,

00:13:19.932 --> 00:13:21.433
you can't cover it in a seminar

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:23.369
whether it's two or
three hours long.

00:13:23.369 --> 00:13:25.805
So we refer people to
pamphlets and booklets

00:13:25.805 --> 00:13:27.606 align:start size:88% position:13%
that I write constantly
and put up there

00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:30.810 align:start size:97% position:3%
that people can use from
everything from check forgery

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:33.879 align:start size:97% position:3%
to identity theft,
embezzlement, whatever it is

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:36.615
that they are concerned
about they can go there

00:13:36.615 --> 00:13:38.918
and research it and
get information.

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:40.586
- [Doug] Well if
there's anything

00:13:40.586 --> 00:13:41.520
that scares a senior citizen,

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.089
and I'm on the brink of it too,

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:48.027
and that is my assets,
how secure are they.

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:52.231
All my banking's online,
my retirement is online.

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:54.934
How vulnerable am I?

00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:57.870 line:0%
- Well you know any any
system can be breached,

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:00.573 line:0%
there is no foolproof system.

00:14:00.573 --> 00:14:03.676
We've obviously had many
many breaches reported

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:07.112
and unreported from
very sophisticated
technology companies

00:14:07.112 --> 00:14:08.881
that have been breached.

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:11.050
So I wouldn't say it's
impossible for someone

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.786
to breach the bank but
I will say that banks

00:14:13.786 --> 00:14:17.656
and financial institutions as
a whole do a much better job

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:19.758 align:start size:97% position:3%
than the federal government,
the state government,

00:14:19.758 --> 00:14:21.794
the county government,
the city government does

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:25.397
in protecting people's
assets and information.

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:27.566
You take a bank like
City National Bank

00:14:27.566 --> 00:14:29.201
or Chase in Manhattan,

00:14:29.201 --> 00:14:32.471 align:start size:84% position:16%
they spend about a
half a billion dollars
a year, every year

00:14:32.471 --> 00:14:34.940
on technology to
keep criminals out.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.776
They're constantly staying one
step ahead of the criminals,

00:14:37.776 --> 00:14:39.745 align:start size:88% position:13%
understand what they're
doing and they have

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:43.315
a lot of fail safe programs
in place to protect them.

00:14:43.315 --> 00:14:46.685 align:start size:97% position:3%
We don't have that, we have
an infrastructure today

00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:50.556 align:start position:0%
with electrical grid that
hasn't been updated in 25 years.

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:53.859 align:start size:88% position:13%
There's a lot of weak
spots in our government.

00:14:53.859 --> 00:14:55.828
Our Medicare and
Medicaid last year

00:14:55.828 --> 00:15:00.199
paid out $200 billion
in fraudulent claims

00:15:00.199 --> 00:15:03.168 align:start position:0%
to criminals who lived in other
countries around the world.

00:15:03.168 --> 00:15:07.339
$200 billion, that's 10%
of Medicare and Medicaid's

00:15:07.339 --> 00:15:10.175
annual budget went to criminals.

00:15:10.175 --> 00:15:13.345 align:start size:84% position:16%
So the government does
a very horrible job

00:15:13.345 --> 00:15:15.281
of protecting information.

00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:17.917 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I would say that you're
in much better hands,

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:19.418
it's not anything foolproof,

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:20.986
but you're much better
hands with your bank

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:22.821 align:start size:84% position:16%
than you would be
with the government.

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:26.258 align:start size:97% position:3%
- There are lots of scams
that involve senior citizens,

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.093
and they evolve over time,

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:31.230
but maybe you could share with
our viewers some of the scams

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:34.099
that are current and
what they should do.

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.168
- I use very simple
rules, so for example

00:15:36.168 --> 00:15:38.137
the most common scams
we have right now,

00:15:38.137 --> 00:15:40.306
one is called the
grandparent scam.

00:15:40.306 --> 00:15:43.375
So the telephone rings, you
walk over to the caller ID,

00:15:43.375 --> 00:15:45.878 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it says it's the
Fargo Police Department.

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.013
So you pick it up
because you believe

00:15:48.013 --> 00:15:49.515 align:start size:81% position:19%
it is the Fargo
Police Department.

00:15:49.515 --> 00:15:52.851
One of the simplest things
to manipulate is caller ID.

00:15:52.851 --> 00:15:54.987 align:start size:94% position:6%
Someone says that they're
Sergeant So-and-So

00:15:54.987 --> 00:15:56.455 align:start size:81% position:19%
with the Fargo
Police Department,

00:15:56.455 --> 00:16:00.359 align:start size:97% position:3%
they've arrested your grandson
for DWI on Interstate 94.

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.561
And they describe
his car to you,

00:16:02.561 --> 00:16:04.630 align:start size:84% position:16%
they describe the
name of his girlfriend

00:16:04.630 --> 00:16:06.665
that was riding in
the car with him.

00:16:06.665 --> 00:16:09.601 align:start position:0%
All the details, and then
simply tell you that he asked us

00:16:09.601 --> 00:16:12.071
not to call his parents,
he asked us to call you.

00:16:12.071 --> 00:16:13.872
He'll have to spend
the weekend in jail

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:16.008 align:start size:84% position:16%
before he sees a judge
unless he post bail

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.543
in the next couple of hours.

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:20.145 align:start size:97% position:3%
Of course the grandparent
says, oh how much is the bail,

00:16:20.145 --> 00:16:23.182
you know, $500, and you can
give us a credit card number

00:16:23.182 --> 00:16:24.917
and we can release him.

00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:28.053
And it's amazing how
many, unfortunately
millions of people,

00:16:28.053 --> 00:16:29.588
fall for that every day.

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:31.623
So if you explain
that to anyone,

00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:33.225 align:start size:88% position:13%
whether they are a
senior or a millennial,

00:16:33.225 --> 00:16:35.294
and you tell them
how the scam works,

00:16:35.294 --> 00:16:38.430
the next time that call comes
and that information comes

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.734
about your grandson or
someone's in custody,

00:16:41.734 --> 00:16:44.703
they know smart enough
to hang up the phone,

00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:47.373
pick up the phone book, look
up the Fargo Police Department

00:16:47.373 --> 00:16:49.908
in the phone book, call
the police department,

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:51.643 align:start size:84% position:16%
and ask them if they
placed that call.

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:54.113 align:start size:84% position:16%
That takes two
minutes to do that.

00:16:54.113 --> 00:16:57.683 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I'm a big believer
in stop, verify.

00:16:57.683 --> 00:17:01.820
If you get a phone call from
the IRS and you're concerned

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:04.656
that it is a real call, the IRS
really doesn't call anybody,

00:17:04.656 --> 00:17:07.359
but if you do get a
call from the IRS,

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:08.827
then just simply
hang up the phone,

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:10.129
again go to the phone book,

00:17:10.129 --> 00:17:12.364
don't call the number
back they gave you.

00:17:12.364 --> 00:17:15.167
Look up the IRS, call the
IRS, tell them you received

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:18.237
that phone call, and of
course they'll tell you

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:20.305 align:start size:88% position:13%
that that's a fictitious
fraudulent call.

00:17:20.305 --> 00:17:23.709
So it doesn't take but a
minute to stop and verify,

00:17:23.709 --> 00:17:26.045
and that's what I tell
people is the solution

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:28.847
to most all of these scams.

00:17:28.847 --> 00:17:30.783 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Doug] Well, a
common scam years ago,

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:33.218 align:start size:94% position:6%
and it keeps coming
around in some variation,

00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:35.988
is the Nigerian windfall.

00:17:35.988 --> 00:17:37.956 align:start size:81% position:19%
The email that
comes to me saying

00:17:37.956 --> 00:17:40.592
there's all this money
that might come my way

00:17:40.592 --> 00:17:42.194
with a modest investment.

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:43.862 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- Yeah, and they've
moved along from that,

00:17:43.862 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
you know the Nigerians years
ago people used to ask me

00:17:46.799 --> 00:17:50.002
how they sent out thousands
and thousands of letters,

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:52.371 align:start size:84% position:16%
who paid the postage
for the stamps.

00:17:52.371 --> 00:17:55.240 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I told them that the
stamps were all counterfeit.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.144 align:start position:0%
So they paid nothing for
fraudulent stamps from Nigeria.

00:17:59.144 --> 00:18:00.712 align:start size:84% position:16%
The difference
today with that scam

00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:03.248
is you used to send
out 10,000 letters

00:18:03.248 --> 00:18:06.452
and hope that 1/10th
of 1% would respond.

00:18:06.452 --> 00:18:08.654 align:start size:97% position:3%
Today, through the
Internet, you could send out

00:18:08.654 --> 00:18:11.723 align:start size:88% position:13%
10 million letters,
and again you only need

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:14.193
1/10th of 1% to respond.

00:18:14.193 --> 00:18:17.863 align:start size:84% position:16%
So it's basically
the same scam again.

00:18:17.863 --> 00:18:20.699
And all these scams,

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:23.669 align:start size:88% position:13%
as I tell people, the
same way in a love scam,

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:26.538
someone might have met
someone on the Internet,

00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:29.007
they've been involved for
six months talking to them

00:18:29.007 --> 00:18:30.442
back and forth on the Internet,

00:18:30.442 --> 00:18:32.077
they've spoken to
them on the phone.

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:33.879
They never met them personally,

00:18:33.879 --> 00:18:36.582
they tell them they live in the
next state over in Minnesota

00:18:36.582 --> 00:18:38.050
or wherever they might be.

00:18:38.050 --> 00:18:40.853
And one day out of the
clear blue they say well,

00:18:40.853 --> 00:18:44.389
I'd come and see you but I
have to have an operation.

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:45.858
I don't have the money for it

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:48.393 align:start size:97% position:3%
and if I don't have the
operation I might, you know,

00:18:48.393 --> 00:18:49.828
might lose my life.

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:53.132 align:start size:97% position:3%
Oh well, how much is the
operation, well it's $35,000.

00:18:53.132 --> 00:18:54.433
Well I'll give you the money.

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:56.702
So the minute someone
asks you for money

00:18:56.702 --> 00:18:58.937 align:start size:84% position:16%
or someone asked
you for information,

00:18:58.937 --> 00:19:00.439 align:start size:84% position:16%
social security
number, date of birth,

00:19:00.439 --> 00:19:01.840
bank account information,

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.042
that's when the red
flag should go up.

00:19:04.042 --> 00:19:07.312 align:start size:88% position:13%
So there are obvious
red flags in every scam.

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:09.615
And if you learn to
spot those red flags

00:19:09.615 --> 00:19:12.217
that's when you need to
end that relationship

00:19:12.217 --> 00:19:14.353
end that conversation and know

00:19:14.353 --> 00:19:16.555
that there's actually a scam
being perpetrated against you.

00:19:16.555 --> 00:19:19.358
- [Doug] There's a sort of an
emotional involvement here,

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:20.792
too though, some of these scams,

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:22.895
and even the ones you
talked about yourself,

00:19:22.895 --> 00:19:25.864 align:start size:88% position:13%
becoming an attorney
because your girlfriend,

00:19:25.864 --> 00:19:28.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
there was some sort
of a connection there.

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:32.070
How good are fraud
artists, con men,

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:33.672
at sort of reading people?

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:36.875
- They're very good and people,

00:19:38.277 --> 00:19:40.412 align:start position:0%
you know I have two incidences,
my neighbor next to me,

00:19:40.412 --> 00:19:42.681
and again I live
in South Carolina.

00:19:42.681 --> 00:19:44.483
Her mother lives in Iowa.

00:19:44.483 --> 00:19:48.020 align:start size:97% position:3%
Her husband worked for John
Deere for years and he retired

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:50.355
and passed away, she's 70.

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:51.924
Very intelligent woman.

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:55.260
Her daughter came over
to me because she said

00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:58.063
my mother's been getting
a phone call from a guy

00:19:58.063 --> 00:20:00.032
that says he's an ex-FBI agent,

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:02.100
and that he would investigate,

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.036
she had lost some money
on some scam in Jamaica,

00:20:04.036 --> 00:20:06.004
and he would investigate it.

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:08.674
And he said he was retired
because he had been shot

00:20:08.674 --> 00:20:11.243
and she asked me if I
could check that out.

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:12.544
So I told her right off the top,

00:20:12.544 --> 00:20:14.813
I said no FBI agent's been shot.

00:20:14.813 --> 00:20:18.050
So I said but give me his
name and I'll find it out.

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:21.620
So I came back and said to
her there is no FBI agent

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.989
by that name or has there
ever been an FBI agent

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:26.091 align:start size:84% position:16%
by that name retired
or otherwise.

00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:28.227
So she told her mother
and her mother said,

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:30.395
when she confronted the guy
the guy said well really

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:35.334 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm not an FBI
agent I'm a private
investigator in Maryland,

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:36.935
and I just said that.

00:20:36.935 --> 00:20:40.772 align:start size:84% position:16%
So again her
daughter came to me.

00:20:40.772 --> 00:20:42.174
I said let me just
talk to your mother,

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:43.709 align:start size:84% position:16%
so I got her mother
on the phone.

00:20:43.709 --> 00:20:45.911
I said look I called the
Attorney General's office

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:48.413 align:start size:84% position:16%
in Maryland, I know
him personally.

00:20:48.413 --> 00:20:51.550 align:start position:0%
He said there is nobody licensed
in that state by that name.

00:20:51.550 --> 00:20:52.851
So obviously this guy's

00:20:52.851 --> 00:20:54.886
just trying to get
money out of you.

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:58.357
So whatever you do don't
give him any money, OK?

00:20:58.357 --> 00:21:00.292
Because he's not
who he says he is.

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:02.427 align:start size:94% position:6%
And the next thing I
know, she said he said no,

00:21:02.427 --> 00:21:04.930 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's not Maryland,
it's actually New York.

00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:07.366 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I checked one more
time for her in New York

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:09.368
and I said I'm not
gonna check anymore,

00:21:09.368 --> 00:21:10.902 align:start size:84% position:16%
but don't send
this guy any money,

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:12.437
he's not who he says he is.

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:14.940
Next thing I know he tells
her I need to come see you

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.742
to investigate the case,

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:18.443 align:start size:84% position:16%
but you have to
send me the airfare.

00:21:18.443 --> 00:21:20.879
She sent $1,200,

00:21:20.879 --> 00:21:24.116
said he'd meet her like an
hour from where she lives

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.084
in a small town in
Iowa, in Des Moines.

00:21:26.084 --> 00:21:28.153
And he never showed up.

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:30.956
I have another incident where
a friend of mine's father,

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:33.025 align:start size:84% position:16%
who was a very
intelligent gentleman

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:37.296
who owned a huge corporation
in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he retired.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:38.997
And he was sending money because

00:21:38.997 --> 00:21:42.000
he said he won Mercedes Benz
but you have to pay the tax.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.503 align:start size:97% position:3%
And he kept sending money
every time he'd send the money

00:21:44.503 --> 00:21:46.038
then they'd say send more money.

00:21:46.038 --> 00:21:48.874
And his son kept telling him,
Dad you've sent more money

00:21:48.874 --> 00:21:50.409
than a Mercedes cost.

00:21:50.409 --> 00:21:53.512
First of all, you have enough
money to go buy 10 Mercedes,

00:21:53.512 --> 00:21:55.781
you want to go buy a
Mercedes go buy one.

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:57.215
But you've already
sent these people,

00:21:57.215 --> 00:21:59.284
and he kept sending them money.

00:21:59.284 --> 00:22:01.086 align:start size:84% position:16%
So yes, a lot of
people get caught up,

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:02.154
and those are the ones
that are very frustrating

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.455
and difficult to deal with

00:22:03.455 --> 00:22:05.123
because no matter
what tell them,

00:22:05.123 --> 00:22:07.159 align:start size:88% position:13%
no matter how much
evidence you give them,

00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:08.927
they're so emotionally involved

00:22:08.927 --> 00:22:11.196
they still go on with the scam.

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:14.666
- [Doug] Well we also live
in a brave new world here

00:22:14.666 --> 00:22:19.438
of social media, where a lot
of our identifying information

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:22.441
is readily available to
somebody who wants to do

00:22:22.441 --> 00:22:24.643 align:start size:81% position:19%
even a cursory
search of Facebook

00:22:24.643 --> 00:22:26.945 align:start size:84% position:16%
or some other social
media platform.

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:29.981 line:0%
- Absolutely, I'm not on
any social media, Facebook,

00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:32.651 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Linkedin, Twitter, I don't
do any of those things.

00:22:32.651 --> 00:22:34.319
But that is why we're seeing

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:36.788
such sophisticated
phishing scams now.

00:22:38.223 --> 00:22:41.126
The kind of scams we see
now is an email that says,

00:22:41.126 --> 00:22:44.029
hi Karen, great having
lunch with you today.

00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:46.231
We need to do that
again more often.

00:22:46.231 --> 00:22:48.433 align:start size:97% position:3%
I hope you and your husband
Robin have a great time

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:50.435
at Disney World with
the kids this week.

00:22:50.435 --> 00:22:53.138
When you get back give me a
call we'll do lunch again.

00:22:53.138 --> 00:22:55.741
By the way, I saw
this on YouTube

00:22:55.741 --> 00:22:58.043 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I thought you'd enjoy
it, here is the link.

00:22:59.411 --> 00:23:00.912
Signed, Joan.

00:23:00.912 --> 00:23:03.081 align:start size:88% position:13%
That's because she
already said on Facebook

00:23:03.081 --> 00:23:06.651 align:start position:0%
she was going to lunch, she
already said her friend's name,

00:23:06.651 --> 00:23:08.954 align:start size:84% position:16%
she said her husband's
name several times,

00:23:08.954 --> 00:23:11.089 align:start size:84% position:16%
they said they were
going to Disney World.

00:23:11.089 --> 00:23:13.725
They use all of that to
establish credibility,

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:16.962 align:start size:97% position:3%
so that when you get that
email you think this must be,

00:23:16.962 --> 00:23:19.364
who else would it be,
must be my friend.

00:23:19.364 --> 00:23:21.967 align:start size:97% position:3%
So yes, there's a tremendous
amount of information

00:23:21.967 --> 00:23:24.035
given away on social media.

00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:26.671
If you tell someone
on social media,

00:23:26.671 --> 00:23:28.607
whether it be Facebook
or whatever it might be,

00:23:28.607 --> 00:23:32.110 align:start size:88% position:13%
where you were born
and your date of birth,

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:34.813
that's 98% I need to
steal your identity.

00:23:34.813 --> 00:23:37.115
I only need to know
those two things.

00:23:37.115 --> 00:23:39.718
So if on your Facebook
page you told me that,

00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:41.453
that's all I need to know.

00:23:41.453 --> 00:23:44.556 align:start size:84% position:16%
If you post a
straight photograph of
yourself on Facebook

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:46.525
I can capture that image of you,

00:23:46.525 --> 00:23:48.860 align:start size:84% position:16%
I can use it on
phony identification,

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.829
and also through
facial recognition

00:23:50.829 --> 00:23:54.366
they can research your photo
and go to your Facebook page,

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:56.101
through facial recognition.

00:23:56.101 --> 00:23:57.369
So I always tell young people,

00:23:57.369 --> 00:23:59.371
you're gonna put
a photo up there,

00:23:59.371 --> 00:24:00.806
you put a photo of
you and your friends,

00:24:00.806 --> 00:24:02.741 align:start size:97% position:3%
and your arm's around them,
you're playing soccer,

00:24:02.741 --> 00:24:04.209
you have your dog.

00:24:04.209 --> 00:24:07.078 align:start size:97% position:3%
You don't have a straight-on
photograph of yourself.

00:24:07.078 --> 00:24:08.713 align:start size:84% position:16%
I also remind a
lot of young people

00:24:08.713 --> 00:24:11.183 align:start size:97% position:3%
that what you say on
Facebook stays on Facebook,

00:24:11.183 --> 00:24:14.386
whether you erase it, delete
it, or you close your account,

00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:15.987
it'll always be there.

00:24:15.987 --> 00:24:17.689
So if the government's
going to hire tomorrow

00:24:17.689 --> 00:24:19.724
they are going to
your Facebook page,

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:21.693
and if there's a picture
of you nude on the beach

00:24:21.693 --> 00:24:23.795 align:start size:84% position:16%
with a bunch of
drug paraphernalia
all over your body,

00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:25.430 align:start size:84% position:16%
and wine bottles
and whiskey bottles,

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:26.932
they're not gonna hire you.

00:24:26.932 --> 00:24:29.468 align:start size:94% position:6%
If you're 12 years old and
you make a racial slur,

00:24:29.468 --> 00:24:31.870 align:start size:88% position:13%
your employer will
read it when you're 21.

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.140
University of North Dakota
will read it at admissions.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.609
If you say something about
someone's sexual orientation

00:24:37.609 --> 00:24:40.011
because you're 14 and
don't know any better,

00:24:40.011 --> 00:24:41.279
someone's going to read it.

00:24:41.279 --> 00:24:44.049
So I always remind young
people before you post,

00:24:44.049 --> 00:24:46.651
before you say something,
you need to ask yourself,

00:24:46.651 --> 00:24:49.421
do I want someone to read
this five years from now,

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:52.624
10 years from now,
because they will.

00:24:52.624 --> 00:24:55.293 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You mentioned you don't
have any social media identity

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:57.329 align:start size:88% position:13%
out there, but
everybody seems to have

00:24:57.329 --> 00:24:59.931 align:start size:84% position:16%
some sort of an
online relationship

00:24:59.931 --> 00:25:02.167
that requires a password.

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:04.135 line:0%
How safe is a password?

00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:08.640 line:0%
I mean some people use the
word password, or 123456.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.141
How safe are the ways

00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:13.812
that we try to protect
our security online?

00:25:13.812 --> 00:25:16.047 line:0%
- Great question,
but first of all,

00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:18.383 line:0%
passwords are for tree houses.

00:25:18.383 --> 00:25:21.486
It is just absurd that we
are using passwords today.

00:25:21.486 --> 00:25:24.890 align:start size:84% position:16%
Passwords are actually
a 1964 technology,

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:26.992
before I ever did anything,

00:25:26.992 --> 00:25:28.927
that we're using in 2018.

00:25:30.362 --> 00:25:32.264
So had you read a lot of things

00:25:32.264 --> 00:25:33.999
that I've written
over the years,

00:25:33.999 --> 00:25:37.402 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's simply trying to
get away from passwords.

00:25:37.402 --> 00:25:40.605
We need to eliminate
the use of passwords.

00:25:40.605 --> 00:25:43.241
So for the last five years
I've worked as an adviser

00:25:43.241 --> 00:25:46.411 align:start size:88% position:13%
to a technology
company called Trusona,

00:25:46.411 --> 00:25:47.913 align:start size:84% position:16%
which is out in
Scottsdale, Arizona.

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:51.149
It stands for true
persona, of a person.

00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:54.152 align:start size:97% position:3%
And Trusona is the
technology that does in fact

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:56.922 align:start size:81% position:19%
eliminate the need
for passwords.

00:25:56.922 --> 00:25:59.925
So within the next couple of
years, two or three years,

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:02.561
you will see passwords go away.

00:26:02.561 --> 00:26:05.964
Big financial institutions
are adopting that technology,

00:26:05.964 --> 00:26:08.867 align:start size:88% position:13%
governments are
adopting the technology.

00:26:08.867 --> 00:26:11.236
And so when you go up to
an ATM you will basically

00:26:11.236 --> 00:26:13.505
just have your phone,
and when you pull up

00:26:13.505 --> 00:26:16.341 align:start size:97% position:3%
you will not need a card,
you will not need a password.

00:26:16.341 --> 00:26:19.077
You will be able to just
simply pull up your phone,

00:26:19.077 --> 00:26:20.812
press your app for your bank,

00:26:20.812 --> 00:26:22.981 align:start size:94% position:6%
and up will come a
little dot on the screen.

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:26.251
You'll hold your phone up
and they'll know it's you.

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:28.286 align:start size:84% position:16%
You won't have to
enter any passwords.

00:26:28.286 --> 00:26:30.789
Delta for example
is using that now

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:34.059 align:start size:97% position:3%
with they're 80,000 employees,
there's no passwords

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:36.261 align:start size:88% position:13%
between their employees
and the company.

00:26:36.261 --> 00:26:38.964
So they vet it and then they
will eventually put it out

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:42.767 align:start size:97% position:3%
into the market for their
millions of flying customers.

00:26:42.767 --> 00:26:45.170
However they will always
start out by saying to you

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.807 align:start size:97% position:3%
on your home screen, do
you want to use a password?

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:51.810 align:start size:84% position:16%
No, no password, so
you'll have the option

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.212
of using your password or
not using your password,

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:55.647
but eventually I
think you'll see

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:57.282
the whole password go away.

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:59.417
And we absolutely
need to do that,

00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:00.919
we need to get rid of passwords.

00:27:00.919 --> 00:27:03.822
- Well some banks or some
institutions these days

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:06.725 align:start size:84% position:16%
are using biometrics
like a finger tip

00:27:06.725 --> 00:27:08.393
or facial recognition.

00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:11.262
- I'm not a big fan
on biometrics, and
I'll explain why.

00:27:12.764 --> 00:27:16.067
If I take a picture of
you on your iPhone 10,

00:27:16.067 --> 00:27:17.936
and your image, or I
take your fingerprint,

00:27:17.936 --> 00:27:19.671
or I take your eye scan,

00:27:19.671 --> 00:27:22.874
biometrics means that I've
taken that digital image

00:27:22.874 --> 00:27:25.510
and I've converted it
to numbers and letters,

00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:28.046 align:start size:84% position:16%
a series of long
numbers and letters.

00:27:28.046 --> 00:27:30.882
If I can capture those
long numbers and letters

00:27:30.882 --> 00:27:34.152 align:start size:97% position:3%
then I can replay them
again and do the same thing,

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:36.121
I can become you, I
can be the retina,

00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:39.190
I can be the fingerprint,
I can be you on the iPhone.

00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:41.493
We know replay is a
very common thing.

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:44.763
So for example when
Trusona was invented

00:27:44.763 --> 00:27:48.299
the people at Trusona when I
got involved with them I said,

00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:52.203
unless you first start out
by inventing anti-replay,

00:27:52.203 --> 00:27:55.707 align:start size:97% position:3%
which no one has done, don't
even go down this path.

00:27:55.707 --> 00:27:58.343 align:start size:88% position:13%
Because as long as I can
replay whatever it is

00:27:58.343 --> 00:28:00.912 align:start size:84% position:16%
you did on your
phone, I can be you.

00:28:02.147 --> 00:28:04.582
So the whole concept was
to develop anti-replay,

00:28:04.582 --> 00:28:08.553
and that's what we did first
and then we developed Trusona.

00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:12.891 align:start size:94% position:6%
So biometrics can be
replayed just like a wire

00:28:12.891 --> 00:28:16.795 align:start position:0%
the bank sends, a company sends
a wire tomorrow, their CFO,

00:28:16.795 --> 00:28:20.298 align:start size:88% position:13%
for $20 million, I
capture that wire data,

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:24.302
I can replay it again and
resend another $20 million.

00:28:24.302 --> 00:28:28.139 align:start position:0%
So you have to have anti-replay
technology to prevent that,

00:28:28.139 --> 00:28:31.076
and in biometrics
we don't have that.

00:28:31.076 --> 00:28:33.344 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Doug] You mentioned
that financial institutions

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:36.981
typically have the the highest
level of security these days.

00:28:36.981 --> 00:28:41.386 align:start size:84% position:16%
We have had some
really fundamentally
troubling breaches,

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:43.288
Equifax for example.

00:28:43.288 --> 00:28:45.757
Sort of backs up that
financial institutions

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:47.726
with very important data.

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:52.564
Is it realistic to
think that my data

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:54.933 align:start size:81% position:19%
isn't out there
already somewhere?

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:58.169
- No, I think it is, I believe
that everyone's information's

00:28:58.169 --> 00:29:00.672
already been stolen,
we've had billions,

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:03.942
literally billions
of personal names

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:05.944
and information breached.

00:29:05.944 --> 00:29:08.880
I am a strong believer
that every breach occurs

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.015 align:start size:88% position:13%
because somebody in that
company did something

00:29:11.015 --> 00:29:13.651
they weren't supposed to do
or somebody in that company

00:29:13.651 --> 00:29:16.287
failed to do something
they were supposed to do.

00:29:16.287 --> 00:29:19.858 align:start size:94% position:6%
Hackers actually don't
cause breaches, people do.

00:29:19.858 --> 00:29:21.826
So in the case of
Equifax they failed

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:24.229
to update their internal system.

00:29:24.229 --> 00:29:27.432 align:start size:84% position:16%
They failed to
import their patches

00:29:27.432 --> 00:29:30.268
that Microsoft sent them
and told them to install.

00:29:30.268 --> 00:29:34.606 align:start position:0%
They did a horrible job of doing
the security infrastructure

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:38.309 align:start size:94% position:6%
and consequently they
allowed hackers to get in.

00:29:38.309 --> 00:29:40.612 align:start size:88% position:13%
And like in every breach
it always starts out

00:29:40.612 --> 00:29:43.481 align:start size:84% position:16%
with a low number,
they said 140 million,

00:29:43.481 --> 00:29:45.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
that it was 142 million,
then 145 million,

00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:48.219
now it's 148 million.

00:29:48.219 --> 00:29:51.322
It's probably more than 200
million pieces of information

00:29:51.322 --> 00:29:54.092
and data have been
stolen from Equifax.

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:56.494
And that's just one
of many breaches.

00:29:56.494 --> 00:29:59.697
We have Yahoo, it had a
half a billion breaches.

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:02.100
There have been so many
names and information,

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.935 align:start size:88% position:13%
one would have to assume
that their identity

00:30:03.935 --> 00:30:07.639 align:start size:84% position:16%
has already been
stolen and out there.

00:30:07.639 --> 00:30:10.408
Yes, but I always remind
people that every breach

00:30:10.408 --> 00:30:11.876
occurs for that reason.

00:30:11.876 --> 00:30:14.579
So during the month of
October was we refer that

00:30:14.579 --> 00:30:16.147
as Cyber Awareness Month.

00:30:16.147 --> 00:30:19.984 align:start size:97% position:3%
So every day for the last
five years, five days a week

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:23.054 align:start size:84% position:16%
I am at a fortune
500 company in house,

00:30:23.054 --> 00:30:25.924 align:start position:0%
Monday through Friday,
somewhere in the United States,

00:30:25.924 --> 00:30:27.525
during the month of October.

00:30:27.525 --> 00:30:29.928
So I think last year I
finished up at Google,

00:30:29.928 --> 00:30:32.096 align:start position:0%
at their corporate headquarters,
and the day before that

00:30:32.096 --> 00:30:33.832
I was at Nationwide Insurance,

00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:36.034
which is in Columbus Ohio.

00:30:36.034 --> 00:30:39.304 align:start size:97% position:3%
Now they have 15,000 people
at Nationwide on their campus,

00:30:39.304 --> 00:30:41.573
so when I go there I
have to spend a day,

00:30:41.573 --> 00:30:43.474 align:start size:94% position:6%
I have to go to the
auditorium, the cafeteria,

00:30:43.474 --> 00:30:45.543
keep speaking to people.

00:30:45.543 --> 00:30:49.581
My message to them is that the
most important job they have,

00:30:49.581 --> 00:30:52.016
whether they're the
janitor or the CEO,

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:54.953
is to protect the information
that's been entrusted to them

00:30:54.953 --> 00:30:56.387
by their clients.

00:30:56.387 --> 00:30:57.922
So when I get out
to those companies

00:30:57.922 --> 00:30:59.224
I have a little thing I do,

00:30:59.224 --> 00:31:01.025
I don't park in the
visitor parking lot.

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:03.228 align:start size:84% position:16%
I park in the
employee parking lot.

00:31:03.228 --> 00:31:05.129
When I get out of the
car empty my pockets

00:31:05.129 --> 00:31:08.032
of some memory sticks
that say confidential.

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:10.034 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I throw them all
over the grounds.

00:31:10.034 --> 00:31:12.403
I have a tracing device
on them so at lunch time

00:31:12.403 --> 00:31:14.973
in the cafeteria I open it
up to see how many employees

00:31:14.973 --> 00:31:16.341
went to see what it said.

00:31:16.341 --> 00:31:19.878
And it says, "This is
a test and you failed."

00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:22.480
But in five years, at
hundreds of companies,

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:24.916
I have yet to have
that not happen.

00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:26.551
Someone's gonna go look.

00:31:26.551 --> 00:31:29.254
Later I explain to them that I
could have cost their company

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:31.189
a billion dollars overnight

00:31:31.189 --> 00:31:33.691
and destroyed their
100-year old brand.

00:31:33.691 --> 00:31:35.660
So there is nothing
more important again

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.263 align:start size:84% position:16%
than educating
employees in a company

00:31:38.263 --> 00:31:40.398
about protecting the
information and data

00:31:40.398 --> 00:31:44.969
that's been entrusted to
them by their their clients

00:31:44.969 --> 00:31:46.871
or their citizens or
whoever it may be.

00:31:46.871 --> 00:31:48.573 align:start size:88% position:13%
- [Doug] So just picking
up that memory stick,

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:50.341
putting it in your
company computer,

00:31:50.341 --> 00:31:51.743
unloads maybe a program--

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.511
- Right, that's it.

00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:54.746
Going to a link that came up

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:55.713
because a friend
sent you something,

00:31:55.713 --> 00:31:57.382
you believe it's your friend.

00:31:57.382 --> 00:32:00.018
There are so many
of those things,

00:32:00.018 --> 00:32:03.087 align:start size:84% position:16%
99% of malware
comes from phishing.

00:32:03.087 --> 00:32:05.456
So they're all by emails
or somebody telling you

00:32:05.456 --> 00:32:08.226
to do something that you're
probably not supposed to do.

00:32:08.226 --> 00:32:11.296 align:start size:94% position:6%
- [Doug] Equifax of course
went on the offensive,

00:32:11.296 --> 00:32:15.366 align:start size:97% position:3%
in terms of its PR
protection, to let people know

00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:17.602 align:start size:81% position:19%
that they were
going to help them

00:32:17.602 --> 00:32:19.237 align:start size:84% position:16%
determine the depth
of the problem

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:21.339
they might personally have.

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:24.008
In my case there was going
to be a deep Internet search

00:32:24.008 --> 00:32:25.977
of whether or not my
social security number,

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:29.113
my phone number, some other
data, of my email address,

00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:30.848
was broadly available.

00:32:30.848 --> 00:32:35.353 align:start size:97% position:3%
I came up clean but somehow
I don't feel secure.

00:32:35.353 --> 00:32:38.756 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
- I kind of felt that
the whole Equifax thing,

00:32:38.756 --> 00:32:42.493 line:0%
what they did post-breach
was a little bit unethical.

00:32:42.493 --> 00:32:45.930 align:start size:97% position:3%
So first of all they
immediately came out and said

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.400
that they will provide one year
of credit monitoring service

00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:53.571
for free, so millions of
people went and signed up

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:56.274
for Equifax credit
monitoring service.

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.977
Then as the year passed
they came back and said,

00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:01.913 align:start size:94% position:6%
well nothing's really
came up yet so we suggest

00:33:01.913 --> 00:33:04.949 align:start size:94% position:6%
you sign up for this
service, it's $15 a month

00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:06.317
or $20 a month.

00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:09.554 align:start size:88% position:13%
So they made millions
and millions of dollars.

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:13.358
I thought that was very
unethical on their part

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:18.363 align:start size:97% position:3%
and basically took advantage
of people and their fear.

00:33:18.363 --> 00:33:21.566
One thing is that when
you breach a company,

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:25.603
if it's a retail environment
such as Home Depot or Target,

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:27.105
and you're stealing
credit card numbers

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start size:94% position:6%
and debit card numbers you
have to get rid of that

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.542
right away, it has a
very short shelf life.

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:34.579
When you breach someone like
an Equifax you're stealing data

00:33:34.579 --> 00:33:38.116 align:start size:97% position:3%
that is name, social security
number, date of birth.

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:39.517
You can't change your name,

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:41.219
you can't change your
social security number,

00:33:41.219 --> 00:33:43.087
and you can't change
your date of birth.

00:33:43.087 --> 00:33:45.423
So the longer I hold that data

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:47.859 align:start size:97% position:3%
the more valuable it becomes
when I go to sell it.

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:50.261 align:start size:88% position:13%
So in those types of
breaches we usually find

00:33:50.261 --> 00:33:52.363
about a four-year lag

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:54.832 align:start size:84% position:16%
because they warehouse
that information.

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:57.468 align:start size:88% position:13%
So in reality we
haven't even been to see

00:33:57.468 --> 00:33:59.404 align:start size:84% position:16%
what's going to
happen with Equifax

00:33:59.404 --> 00:34:02.640
and the information that
was stolen off of Equifax.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.143
We're just now seeing the
South Carolina breach,

00:34:05.143 --> 00:34:07.612 align:start size:84% position:16%
the Target breach,
the Home Depot breach.

00:34:07.612 --> 00:34:10.214 align:start size:88% position:13%
When it came to personal
data such as name,

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:12.216 align:start size:84% position:16%
social security
number, date of birth,

00:34:12.216 --> 00:34:13.885 align:start size:84% position:16%
because they can hold
that for so long.

00:34:13.885 --> 00:34:16.754
So we don't really know
the damage of Equifax.

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:18.322
Now, here's the thing.

00:34:19.524 --> 00:34:21.025
What's really bad
about all of this

00:34:21.025 --> 00:34:24.295 align:start size:94% position:6%
is whether it be Equifax,
Experian, TransUnion,

00:34:24.295 --> 00:34:26.597
you never gave the credit bureau

00:34:26.597 --> 00:34:27.765
permission to have
your information.

00:34:27.765 --> 00:34:29.300 align:start size:84% position:16%
There's not one single
thing you signed

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.170 align:start size:84% position:16%
that said hey, you
can store all my data,

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:34.305
and you can make
billions of dollars

00:34:34.305 --> 00:34:37.642 align:start size:97% position:3%
selling it to credit purposes,
background checks, etc.,

00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:41.179 align:start size:84% position:16%
insurance, etc.,
you never said that.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:45.083
So I think that you and every
citizen, including myself,

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:47.652
should have the right
to freeze their credit.

00:34:47.652 --> 00:34:50.822
And we should be able to say
no, you can't use my credit

00:34:50.822 --> 00:34:52.990
unless I give you permission

00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:56.094 align:start size:88% position:13%
to give that
information to someone.

00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:59.664 align:start size:84% position:16%
So up until this year
only eight states

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start size:81% position:19%
allowed you to
freeze your credit

00:35:01.599 --> 00:35:03.401
without charging you a fee.

00:35:03.401 --> 00:35:05.970 align:start size:84% position:16%
All the other states
required a fee,

00:35:05.970 --> 00:35:10.241
could be $10 to freeze
it, $15 to unfreeze it,

00:35:10.241 --> 00:35:12.510
$10 to freeze it back again.

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:14.846 align:start size:84% position:16%
So not only was it
costly but for seniors

00:35:14.846 --> 00:35:18.249 align:start size:94% position:6%
it became very troublesome
and very involved

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:20.218
in trying to keep up on
whether they froze it,

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:21.619
they didn't freeze it.

00:35:21.619 --> 00:35:23.921 align:start size:94% position:6%
So for two years I
testified before Congress

00:35:23.921 --> 00:35:26.324
asking the government,
the federal government,

00:35:26.324 --> 00:35:29.327 align:start size:84% position:16%
to actually take it
and make it continuous

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:31.329
throughout all the 50 states,

00:35:31.329 --> 00:35:33.764
so we had continuity.

00:35:33.764 --> 00:35:35.900
And that no credit bureau
in any of the 50 states

00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:37.635
could charge you to
freeze your credit,

00:35:37.635 --> 00:35:40.471 align:start size:94% position:6%
unfreeze your credit,
freeze your credit again.

00:35:40.471 --> 00:35:43.741 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm happy to say that
Congress created the bill,

00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:46.744
they passed the bill, the
President signed the bill,

00:35:46.744 --> 00:35:50.281
and on September 1st of
this year, all 50 states,

00:35:50.281 --> 00:35:53.284
citizens will be able
to freeze their credit

00:35:53.284 --> 00:35:55.987
and then unfreeze it
and freeze it again

00:35:55.987 --> 00:35:58.356
at no cost to do so.

00:35:58.356 --> 00:36:02.760
And so if you were a senior
and you're 78 years old,

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.862
you own your house,
you own your cars,

00:36:04.862 --> 00:36:07.298
you have credit cards, you're
not looking for any credit.

00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:08.766
You need to freeze your credit,

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:10.968
there's no reason for
you to have your credit

00:36:10.968 --> 00:36:12.403
floating out there.

00:36:12.403 --> 00:36:14.739 align:start size:97% position:3%
If I'm a young man or
woman, I'm in the military,

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:18.276
I'm getting sent overseas for
two years, to Afghanistan.

00:36:18.276 --> 00:36:21.179
I freeze my credit, I have
no reason to use my credit

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:23.848 align:start size:88% position:13%
while I'm overseas
thousands of miles away.

00:36:23.848 --> 00:36:26.250 align:start size:88% position:13%
So freezing your credit
is the best option.

00:36:26.250 --> 00:36:27.885
And now you'll be
able to do that.

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:31.389
And if you were 78
and you wanted to buy
a washer and dryer,

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:33.457
but you wanted to finance it

00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:34.392 align:start size:81% position:19%
from the local
appliance company,

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:35.860
then you go down and simply say

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:38.796
I'm going to unfreeze my
credit to ABC Appliance,

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:41.666
so they can give me this
washer and dryer on credit.

00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:44.669 align:start position:0%
And then freeze it back, they're
the only ones can see it.

00:36:44.669 --> 00:36:47.471 align:start position:0%
And that's an ability we
didn't have before we have now.

00:36:47.471 --> 00:36:50.041
- [Doug] So this would
be a much simpler process

00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:51.008
than it currently--

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:53.044
- Than it currently is.

00:36:53.044 --> 00:36:54.545
And no cost involved.

00:36:54.545 --> 00:36:58.115
- [Doug] You mentioned, you
suggested the commoditization

00:36:58.115 --> 00:37:01.185
of this information, this
kind of dark Internet world

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:05.022 align:start size:97% position:3%
that's out there were personal
data is literally sold

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:08.292 align:start size:84% position:16%
to other people
for nefarious uses.

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:11.128
And that it might be
years down the road

00:37:11.128 --> 00:37:15.233
before my information
makes me vulnerable.

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:17.435
That's scary.

00:37:18.402 --> 00:37:19.804
- It is very scary.

00:37:19.804 --> 00:37:21.305
And you know this is not new,

00:37:21.305 --> 00:37:23.241 align:start size:94% position:6%
years ago it used to be
what we called chat rooms,

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:24.976
where we'd monitor
these chat rooms

00:37:24.976 --> 00:37:27.278 align:start size:97% position:3%
and we see them selling
all these driver's license,

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start size:84% position:16%
mother's maiden
names, dates of birth,

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.015
bank account information.

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:33.884
Now you have the dark web where
they're doing the same thing

00:37:33.884 --> 00:37:36.687 align:start size:84% position:16%
but they're doing
it much bigger bulk.

00:37:36.687 --> 00:37:38.889 align:start size:94% position:6%
But yes, when you have
one of these big breaches,

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:41.058
always keep in mind
that information,

00:37:41.058 --> 00:37:43.961
so when someone says to you
well what we're gonna do

00:37:43.961 --> 00:37:47.331
is offer you one-year credit
monitoring service for free,

00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:49.200
nothing's gonna
happen in a year.

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.269 align:start size:94% position:6%
First of all you've
already told the criminal,

00:37:51.269 --> 00:37:54.372 align:start position:0%
I've given all these people
credit monitoring for one year,

00:37:54.372 --> 00:37:57.608
so as a criminal I'm gonna
go OK, well then for one year

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.343
I'm not gonna do anything.

00:37:59.343 --> 00:38:01.679 align:start size:97% position:3%
So one year of credit
monitoring would be worthless,

00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.848
you would always need at
least three or four years

00:38:03.848 --> 00:38:07.151 align:start size:97% position:3%
of credit monitoring to make
sure you're not picked up

00:38:07.151 --> 00:38:09.553
and victimized by it.

00:38:09.553 --> 00:38:11.922
- [Doug] Frank Abagnale
is an author, a lecturer,

00:38:11.922 --> 00:38:14.725
and a financial
fraud consultant.

00:38:14.725 --> 00:38:18.029 align:start position:0%
And your story, we started
talking about your life history,

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:21.666
those formative five
years from 16 to 21

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:25.236 align:start size:94% position:6%
that launched a career
helping people ultimately.

00:38:25.236 --> 00:38:27.905
But your story was
told in a movie.

00:38:27.905 --> 00:38:31.375 align:start size:88% position:13%
And a Broadway musical,
Catch Me if I Can.

00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:32.476
- Catch Me if You Can.

00:38:33.911 --> 00:38:36.280 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
- [Doug] What was
that experience like,

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.750 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
having your story told
in a different way.

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:41.018 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You know I didn't
have I didn't have a lot

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:43.754
to do with the movie, but
I thought it was great

00:38:43.754 --> 00:38:45.589
that it was Steven
Spielberg who did it.

00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:50.594
He loved the story because
of how the story ended out,

00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:52.763
and how my life turned out.

00:38:52.763 --> 00:38:56.167 align:start size:84% position:16%
So he held the
rights for 20 years,

00:38:56.167 --> 00:38:58.803 align:start size:94% position:6%
back when he was making
Jaws he bought the rights.

00:38:58.803 --> 00:39:01.038 align:start size:88% position:13%
So Barbara Walters asked
him in an interview,

00:39:01.038 --> 00:39:03.140 align:start size:94% position:6%
why did you wait 20
years to make this movie?

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.809
And he said well,
I waited to see

00:39:04.809 --> 00:39:06.844 align:start size:94% position:6%
what the real Frank
Abagnale did with his life

00:39:06.844 --> 00:39:09.580 align:start size:84% position:16%
before I immortalized
him on film.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:13.184 align:start size:97% position:3%
So I think it was, he loved
that part of the story,

00:39:13.184 --> 00:39:15.152
and he wanted the
world to know it.

00:39:15.152 --> 00:39:18.356
So I was very fortunate that
it was he who made the movie.

00:39:18.356 --> 00:39:20.658
I thought he did a great
job of telling the story.

00:39:20.658 --> 00:39:23.627
Broadway did a great job of
telling the story to music.

00:39:24.762 --> 00:39:26.831
I was very fortunate,
Leonardo DiCaprio,

00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:29.500
who did an amazing
job, he took the role

00:39:29.500 --> 00:39:31.769
when he was 27, 28 years old,

00:39:31.769 --> 00:39:34.004
and portrayed the part
of a 16 year old boy.

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:36.574
Did an amazing, he's a
great character actor.

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:39.977
Had people like Tom Hanks
and Christopher Walken,

00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:41.312
so they had an amazing cast.

00:39:41.312 --> 00:39:44.548
But I thought they
did a great job.

00:39:44.548 --> 00:39:46.217
So if you're gonna have
to have your story told,

00:39:46.217 --> 00:39:48.986
I was very fortunate it was he
who told the world the story.

00:39:48.986 --> 00:39:51.355 line:0%
- How has Catch Me if
You Can, the movie,

00:39:52.289 --> 00:39:53.257 line:0%
affected your life?

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:55.359
- I get asked quite often,

00:39:55.359 --> 00:39:56.927
how did the movie
change my life.

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:59.597
And the truth is I do
the same thing today

00:39:59.597 --> 00:40:01.665
that I did years ago.

00:40:01.665 --> 00:40:05.002 align:start size:97% position:3%
The only difference is I
get paid more money to do it

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:07.605
and people want to take
their picture with me.

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:09.540
I don't know how many
thousands of pictures

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.308
I've taken with people.

00:40:11.308 --> 00:40:13.277 align:start size:84% position:16%
You know I had
written five books,

00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:17.381
I had been on the lecture
series for years and years.

00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:19.917
No one ever asked to
have a photo with me.

00:40:19.917 --> 00:40:23.187 align:start size:94% position:6%
Now everywhere I go, in
the airport wherever I am,

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:24.955
someone wants take
a picture with me.

00:40:24.955 --> 00:40:27.858
So I think that has a lot to
do what people have cameras,

00:40:27.858 --> 00:40:30.494
and social media, they want
to put it up on social media.

00:40:30.494 --> 00:40:34.298 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I always say, my
sons always remind me,

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:35.933
you know Dad you tell people
you're not on social media,

00:40:35.933 --> 00:40:38.669 align:start size:88% position:13%
but if you type in Frank
Abagnale on Twitter

00:40:38.669 --> 00:40:41.105
there are 10,000 people
that are Frank Abagnale,

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:42.740
and the same way on a Facebook.

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:46.777
- [Doug] Well what is the
next stage of your story?

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:48.312
You're a senior
citizen now, too.

00:40:48.312 --> 00:40:49.113
- Yes.

00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:52.483
So I'll probably, as
the FBI always ask me

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:55.586 align:start size:97% position:3%
when am I gonna retire,
because they don't want me to,

00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:58.856 align:start size:97% position:3%
I always tell them that as
long as I can go out and speak

00:40:58.856 --> 00:41:01.292
and sound of mind and
physically capable

00:41:01.292 --> 00:41:03.894
of getting on airplanes
and traveling every day,

00:41:03.894 --> 00:41:05.229
I'll continue to do this,

00:41:05.229 --> 00:41:06.997 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'll continue to
teach at the academy,

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:09.200
I'll be there on
August 1st again.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.703
I will do that as long
as I'm physically able to

00:41:12.703 --> 00:41:15.773
and I don't start slurring my
words or something like that.

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:18.175 align:start position:0%
Then I'll know it's time to
quit, but until that time comes

00:41:18.175 --> 00:41:19.910
I'll just continue
doing what I'm doing.

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:21.946
- [Doug] And are
you proselytizing,

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:24.748
if you're standing in
a line in and airport,

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:26.217 align:start size:84% position:16%
if you're at a table
in a restaurant

00:41:26.217 --> 00:41:28.619
and somebody suggests something

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:30.754
that sounds too good to be true,

00:41:30.754 --> 00:41:33.290
does does your impulse kick in?

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.526
- Yeah absolutely, you know
you gave a perfect example,

00:41:35.526 --> 00:41:37.161
the airport.

00:41:37.161 --> 00:41:40.164
So I travel every day, I'm
in and out of the airport

00:41:40.164 --> 00:41:41.832
once or twice a day.

00:41:41.832 --> 00:41:44.869 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I watch people go
through the airport line

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:49.840 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I realized that there
might be 19 TSA officers there

00:41:51.275 --> 00:41:52.776 align:start size:97% position:3%
but the truth is I only
need to get to one of them.

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:55.446 align:start size:97% position:3%
So if I can get to one of
them because of lack of ethics

00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:57.381
or character in their makeup,

00:41:57.381 --> 00:41:59.884
I win and the airport loses.

00:41:59.884 --> 00:42:02.186
So it's not a difficult
thing unfortunately.

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:04.555
And then when I watch the
airline crews go through,

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:07.591
they basically are just
waving their ID card.

00:42:07.591 --> 00:42:09.894
Now years ago it
took a lot of work

00:42:09.894 --> 00:42:11.529
to make one of those ID cards.

00:42:11.529 --> 00:42:13.764
Today you sit down at your
computer, you design it,

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:16.534 align:start size:94% position:6%
you capture the logos,
you have a beautiful card,

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:19.069 align:start size:84% position:16%
hologram, no hologram,
it doesn't matter.

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:22.506
So I ask myself, is anyone
really looking at those cards

00:42:22.506 --> 00:42:24.975 align:start size:88% position:13%
and paying any attention
to those cards?

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:27.611
So I don't know
that it would be,

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:29.013
I always tell people
when they say well,

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.415
could you do today what
you did 40 years ago?

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:33.384
Yeah, it's thousands
of times easier today,

00:42:33.384 --> 00:42:36.420
because I didn't have the
technology 40 years ago

00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:39.123
to do the things
that are done today

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:41.258
which make it so much easier.

00:42:41.258 --> 00:42:44.328
Technology breeds crime, it
always has, it always will.

00:42:44.328 --> 00:42:46.030
And there will always be
people using technology

00:42:46.030 --> 00:42:47.565
in a self-negative way.

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:50.100
So yes it would be
a lot easier today,

00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.869
so some of those
things do scare me,

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.971
because I realize that
someone could do that

00:42:53.971 --> 00:42:55.839
if they wanted to do it.

00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:56.807
- [Doug] So when you
go through the airport,

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:58.409
you go through airport security,

00:42:58.409 --> 00:43:00.611
do you feel safer today, or?

00:43:00.611 --> 00:43:03.514 line:0%
- No, I don't really feel any
safer going through there.

00:43:03.514 --> 00:43:06.483 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
Because I know that if someone
really had an intention

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:08.285
of doing something
they could still

00:43:08.285 --> 00:43:10.087
get an airline pilot's uniform,

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:12.523
they could still
make up an ID card,

00:43:12.523 --> 00:43:14.692 align:start size:88% position:13%
they could still finagle
their way somehow,

00:43:14.692 --> 00:43:17.561
through bribery or some way
to get through the airport,

00:43:17.561 --> 00:43:20.397 align:start size:84% position:16%
so I don't feel a
hundred percent safer.

00:43:20.397 --> 00:43:25.235 align:start size:97% position:3%
I do believe that it's such
an immense hindrance to travel

00:43:25.235 --> 00:43:28.939 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I think a lot of people
are unfairly picked out

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:31.909
that shouldn't be searched.

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:33.644
So it's a horrible way to live

00:43:33.644 --> 00:43:35.946
because of an incident
that the rest of life,

00:43:35.946 --> 00:43:37.848
my life and other generations

00:43:37.848 --> 00:43:39.683 align:start size:84% position:16%
will have to be
searched all the time.

00:43:39.683 --> 00:43:41.185 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Doug] It's a
bit of a conundrum,

00:43:41.185 --> 00:43:45.422
there's I suppose some value
at having a show of security,

00:43:45.422 --> 00:43:50.427
and yet if you were advising
airport security operations,

00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:53.097
what kind of advice
would you give them?

00:43:53.097 --> 00:43:55.199 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Well for example
what I observe

00:43:55.199 --> 00:43:57.267
is the person that's
doing the screening,

00:43:57.267 --> 00:43:59.336
that's the person
watching the screen

00:43:59.336 --> 00:44:01.805
as the stuff goes
through the belt,

00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:03.574
there needs to be more
than one person there,

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:05.976
because if I'm able
to get to that person

00:44:05.976 --> 00:44:07.511
that's really all
I need to get to.

00:44:07.511 --> 00:44:10.981
Because when I show my ID,
which would be a phony ID,

00:44:10.981 --> 00:44:13.450
and my boarding pass, and
I go over to the belt,

00:44:13.450 --> 00:44:15.185
whatever it is I have in my bag

00:44:15.185 --> 00:44:18.689 align:start size:88% position:13%
I just need that one
individual to ignore it.

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:20.724 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm gonna walk
through the screening

00:44:20.724 --> 00:44:22.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
because I don't
have anything on me.

00:44:22.159 --> 00:44:24.728 align:start size:97% position:3%
And if that one person
sees what's ever in the bag

00:44:24.728 --> 00:44:28.032 align:start size:97% position:3%
and ignores it because I
bribed them or whatever I did,

00:44:28.032 --> 00:44:31.068 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it gets through, I
pick up my bag and off I go

00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:33.704 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I get on the plane, no
one else is going to check it.

00:44:33.704 --> 00:44:35.673
So I don't like the fact

00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:37.441
that there's just one
person observing that.

00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:39.343
And once in while you'll
see them being trained,

00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:41.779
so there's a trainer behind
them, but most of the time

00:44:41.779 --> 00:44:43.313
they're doing that themselves.

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:46.684
And obviously, unfortunately,

00:44:46.684 --> 00:44:49.253
we live in an extremely
unethical world today,

00:44:49.253 --> 00:44:50.888 align:start size:84% position:16%
where we don't teach
ethics at home,

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:52.356
we don't teach ethics in school,

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:53.857
we don't teach it
in the university,

00:44:53.857 --> 00:44:55.659
we don't teach it
in the workplace.

00:44:55.659 --> 00:44:59.063 align:start size:97% position:3%
So there is a tremendous
lack of character and ethics,

00:44:59.063 --> 00:45:03.467
and that's very scary when it
comes to those types of jobs.

00:45:03.467 --> 00:45:06.537
- [Doug] So, what about
your own upbringing?

00:45:06.537 --> 00:45:08.072
You had a father and mother.

00:45:09.406 --> 00:45:13.210 align:start position:0%
What were the ethical struggles
that you might have had?

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:16.380
- Yeah, I think that, I had
not only a mother and father

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.981
but I went to Catholic school

00:45:17.981 --> 00:45:21.985 align:start size:81% position:19%
most of my life
up to high school.

00:45:21.985 --> 00:45:25.222
I believe that sometimes
all of us go make mistakes

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:27.124
and we go down the wrong path.

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:29.993 align:start size:97% position:3%
But you have to have that
rope that's been given to you

00:45:29.993 --> 00:45:32.496
to pull yourself back
to the right path.

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:34.832 align:start size:88% position:13%
I think my parents gave
me the right tools,

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:37.868
I just went down the
wrong road, ran away,

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:39.336
started to get into
a lot of trouble.

00:45:39.336 --> 00:45:41.905
But I had that rope that I
always knew I could reach for

00:45:41.905 --> 00:45:44.441
and pull myself back
on the right road.

00:45:44.441 --> 00:45:46.210
I think today there are
a lot of young people

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.678
don't have that rope.

00:45:47.678 --> 00:45:51.181 align:start size:97% position:3%
So once they make that wrong
turn it's very difficult

00:45:51.181 --> 00:45:54.618
to get back onto the
onto the right road.

00:45:54.618 --> 00:45:57.955
- You've now spent
more than 40 years

00:45:57.955 --> 00:46:00.891
working with FBI
agents in training

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:03.160
and other federal agencies.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.529
How many professional's lives

00:46:05.529 --> 00:46:08.065 align:start size:94% position:6%
do you think you've
touched over those years?

00:46:08.065 --> 00:46:10.968 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well I know that I've taught
more than two generations

00:46:10.968 --> 00:46:15.272 align:start size:84% position:16%
of FBI agents, we have
13,000 FBI agents.

00:46:15.272 --> 00:46:16.874
Many of them all retired today

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:18.375 align:start size:84% position:16%
that are very close
friends of mine

00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:20.677
that are retired agents I taught

00:46:20.677 --> 00:46:21.979 align:start size:84% position:16%
when they went
through the Academy.

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:24.481 align:start size:84% position:16%
Agents have to retire
at 57 years old,

00:46:24.481 --> 00:46:27.818
so I've met many agents
who are now retired.

00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:29.319
My son is an FBI agent,

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:32.055
he's celebrating 12
years in the Bureau.

00:46:32.055 --> 00:46:34.091
I taught him, he was in my class

00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:36.093 align:start size:84% position:16%
when he went
through the Academy.

00:46:36.093 --> 00:46:39.062
So yes, I was recently,

00:46:39.062 --> 00:46:40.631 align:start size:81% position:19%
on my website I
have a little clip

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:44.601 align:start size:97% position:3%
from a US Senate committee,
about 12 senators,

00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:48.005 align:start size:88% position:13%
interviewing me, and the
senator from Oklahoma

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:53.010
mentioned that I had trained
two generations of FBI agents

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:56.914 align:start size:97% position:3%
during my career and that's
been a wonderful thing for me.

00:46:56.914 --> 00:47:00.250
- The FBI has had some
problems in its past,

00:47:00.250 --> 00:47:02.653
it was a bit problematic
around the Hoover years.

00:47:02.653 --> 00:47:06.256 align:start size:88% position:13%
And now there is concern
about whether or not

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:10.627 align:start size:94% position:6%
the FBI is following
certain ethical guidelines

00:47:10.627 --> 00:47:12.629
in its dealings.

00:47:12.629 --> 00:47:14.932
How does that concern you?

00:47:14.932 --> 00:47:18.435 line:0%
- Well, like in every
in every organization

00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:20.037 line:0%
there are a few bad people.

00:47:20.037 --> 00:47:24.741 align:start position:0%
I truly believe that you
cannot be involved politically,

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:26.243
you can have your
political thoughts,

00:47:26.243 --> 00:47:28.712 align:start size:88% position:13%
you cannot let them
interfere in your work.

00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:32.049
The 13,000 agents
that are out there,

00:47:32.049 --> 00:47:34.985
they don't let politics
interfere in their work.

00:47:34.985 --> 00:47:36.887
I think this was a
handful of people,

00:47:36.887 --> 00:47:40.290
who obviously now have
been fired and dismissed,

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:43.627 align:start size:84% position:16%
but who let politics
get involved with
their decision-making

00:47:43.627 --> 00:47:45.729
and that was wrong.

00:47:45.729 --> 00:47:47.231
And you can't become political.

00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:49.199
And obviously you have to serve

00:47:49.199 --> 00:47:52.569
whatever president the
public puts in place.

00:47:52.569 --> 00:47:54.438
They're your president, you
have to serve the president,

00:47:54.438 --> 00:47:55.873 align:start size:84% position:16%
whether you like
them, don't like them,

00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:58.308
don't believe in their politics.

00:47:58.308 --> 00:48:01.478
That's not your decision
to make as an FBI agent.

00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:04.081 align:start position:0%
And when you investigate a
crime you investigate the crime

00:48:04.081 --> 00:48:07.517 align:start size:94% position:6%
based on facts and
information you've gotten.

00:48:07.517 --> 00:48:12.022 align:start size:97% position:3%
And as for the FBI and
their over 100 year history,

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:15.192 align:start size:97% position:3%
their sole job, as they
remind people all the time,

00:48:15.192 --> 00:48:17.594
is only an investigative arm

00:48:17.594 --> 00:48:19.963
of the Department of Justice.

00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:21.732
So they investigate the crime,

00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:24.902 align:start size:88% position:13%
they bring the evidence
to the US attorney,

00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.103
or in this case the
Attorney General,

00:48:26.103 --> 00:48:27.971
say here's all the evidence.

00:48:27.971 --> 00:48:30.374 align:start size:88% position:13%
And the Attorney General
or the US Attorney

00:48:30.374 --> 00:48:33.610
makes a decision whether to
prosecute or not prosecute.

00:48:34.578 --> 00:48:36.046
So in my personal opinion,

00:48:36.046 --> 00:48:39.283 align:start position:0%
Director Comey should have never
ever made those statements.

00:48:39.283 --> 00:48:41.818
It was not his place to
make those statements.

00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:44.154
He should have simply said
to the Attorney General,

00:48:44.154 --> 00:48:46.523
I'm not doing that,
that's not my job.

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:48.859 align:start size:84% position:16%
And if you force me
to do it, I'll resign,

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:52.262
and that will look even worse
if I tell people why I resign.

00:48:52.262 --> 00:48:55.732
I think that was where it
all started, the mistake.

00:48:55.732 --> 00:48:57.467
He should have never done that.

00:48:57.467 --> 00:49:00.170 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think he was a
little more political.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:02.272 align:start size:88% position:13%
I not only knew Director
Muller very well

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:04.107
but I traveled with
director Muller.

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:07.577
He's a fine, ethical gentleman.

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:10.414
And never once did I see
him in front of a camera.

00:49:10.414 --> 00:49:14.151
He avoided the news media,
he didn't talk to the press.

00:49:14.151 --> 00:49:16.486
If we were at a conference I
would go speak with the press,

00:49:16.486 --> 00:49:18.855 align:start size:81% position:19%
he didn't go speak
with the press.

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:21.358
He was very much the
Director of the Bureau.

00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:22.659
And that's the way it should be.

00:49:22.659 --> 00:49:24.628 align:start size:84% position:16%
He didn't get
involved in comments,

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:25.896
politically or otherwise.

00:49:25.896 --> 00:49:29.066
So I think it was a
change in directors

00:49:29.066 --> 00:49:32.102
and that was a problem
and I think hopefully

00:49:32.102 --> 00:49:33.804
they'll get this all cleared up,

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:36.173
but it's no reflection
on the 13,000 agents,

00:49:36.173 --> 00:49:38.175
men and women who do
their job every day.

00:49:38.175 --> 00:49:40.510 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well again you're
in North Dakota

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.279 align:start size:84% position:16%
to talk about fraud,
particularly that

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:44.915
that's perpetrated
on senior citizens.

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:46.950
And you'll be talking to
business owners as well.

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.019 line:0%
We live in an age of security,

00:49:49.019 --> 00:49:51.321 line:0%
where we are on line to bank,

00:49:51.321 --> 00:49:54.324 line:0%
and on line to make purchases.

00:49:55.692 --> 00:49:57.995 align:start size:94% position:6%
What should we know
about our online presence

00:49:57.995 --> 00:50:00.330
that should concern us?

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:04.401 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well first of all, make sure
that you shred everything.

00:50:04.401 --> 00:50:07.738
So you got a catalog
yesterday from Macy's,

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:09.706 align:start size:88% position:13%
you looked at it, wasn't
anything you wanted,

00:50:09.706 --> 00:50:11.508
so you threw it away.

00:50:11.508 --> 00:50:12.709 align:start size:84% position:16%
But on the back
cover of the catalog

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:14.911 align:start size:84% position:16%
was your name and
address, your barcode,

00:50:14.911 --> 00:50:17.948
source code, ID number.

00:50:17.948 --> 00:50:19.616
That's all I need to become you.

00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:21.084
So you want to shred that.

00:50:21.084 --> 00:50:23.020 align:start size:97% position:3%
You went to the grocery
store and you wrote a check.

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.055 align:start size:84% position:16%
On the check was your
name and address,

00:50:25.055 --> 00:50:27.424 align:start size:84% position:16%
phone number, bank's
name and address,

00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:29.159
account number at your bank,

00:50:29.159 --> 00:50:31.194 align:start size:81% position:19%
routing number
into your account,

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:32.996
that you're wiring instructions.

00:50:32.996 --> 00:50:36.433 align:start size:94% position:6%
Signature on the signature
card at your bank.

00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:37.634
Then the clerk wrote down

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:39.936 align:start size:88% position:13%
your North Dakota
driver's license number

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:41.638
and your date of
birth on the front.

00:50:41.638 --> 00:50:43.173
You don't get the check back.

00:50:43.173 --> 00:50:46.410
We live in truncation so you
get an image of the check.

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:49.479 align:start position:0%
The check goes to that company's
headquarters in Chicago

00:50:49.479 --> 00:50:52.015
where it sits in a
warehouse for 65 days

00:50:52.015 --> 00:50:54.051 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then they
physically destroy it.

00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:56.153
Anyone who would see
the face of that check

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.288 align:start size:81% position:19%
could draft on
your bank account,

00:50:58.288 --> 00:50:59.823
wire money out of your account.

00:50:59.823 --> 00:51:02.459
So I don't get over paranoid,
I'm a little old-fashioned,

00:51:02.459 --> 00:51:03.393
I write a check to
pay the mortgage

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:05.128
or write a check to pay a loan,

00:51:05.128 --> 00:51:06.329 align:start size:94% position:6%
but I'm very careful about
where I write a check.

00:51:06.329 --> 00:51:07.998 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because I'm actually
handing someone

00:51:07.998 --> 00:51:10.700
information with all
my banking information

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.702
on a piece of paper.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.272
I don't own a debit card.

00:51:15.272 --> 00:51:16.473
I've never owned one,

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:19.142 align:start size:84% position:16%
never allowed my three
sons to have one.

00:51:19.142 --> 00:51:22.679
A long time ago while writing
a book on financial security,

00:51:22.679 --> 00:51:27.584 align:start position:0%
I asked myself how would someone
remove 99.9% of their risk.

00:51:27.584 --> 00:51:30.687
And the answer was to use
the safest form of payment

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:32.656
that exists on the
face of the earth.

00:51:32.656 --> 00:51:35.092
And that is a credit card.

00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:37.127
Credit card, Visa, MasterCard,

00:51:37.127 --> 00:51:39.129
American Express, Discover card.

00:51:39.129 --> 00:51:42.332
Not a debit-credit
but a credit card.

00:51:42.332 --> 00:51:43.934
And every day of my life

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:46.103
I spend the credit
card company's money.

00:51:46.103 --> 00:51:47.604
I never spend my money,

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:50.173 align:start position:0%
my money sits in a money market
account, it earns interest.

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:53.310 align:start position:0%
No one knows where it is because
it's not exposed to anyone.

00:51:53.310 --> 00:51:56.546 align:start size:88% position:13%
I only expose the credit
card company's money.

00:51:56.546 --> 00:51:58.949
I will do everything I
can to protect the card,

00:51:58.949 --> 00:52:00.584
but if someone gets my number

00:52:00.584 --> 00:52:03.687 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they charge a
million dollars on my
credit card tomorrow

00:52:03.687 --> 00:52:07.591
by federal law my liability
is zero, I have no liability.

00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:10.193
If I buy something online
and use my credit card

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:12.195 align:start size:84% position:16%
and they don't deliver
it I'm covered.

00:52:12.195 --> 00:52:14.297 align:start size:94% position:6%
If I buy something
online and it comes broke

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:16.633
and they refuse to take
it back, I'm covered.

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:19.402
If I buy something online
from a fictitious website

00:52:19.402 --> 00:52:21.238 align:start size:81% position:19%
because I don't
know is fictitious

00:52:21.238 --> 00:52:23.473
and I never get it, I'm covered.

00:52:23.473 --> 00:52:26.510
Every time I pay my bill or
part of my bill every month,

00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:28.712
my credit score goes up,

00:52:28.712 --> 00:52:30.914 align:start size:94% position:6%
so I keep building credit
on my credit score.

00:52:30.914 --> 00:52:33.383
When you use a debit card
every time you reach for it

00:52:33.383 --> 00:52:35.652 align:start size:94% position:6%
you're exposing the money
in your bank account.

00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:38.288 align:start size:94% position:6%
The only money they gonna
steel is your money.

00:52:38.288 --> 00:52:41.825 align:start position:0%
So in every post-investigation,
Target, Home Depot,

00:52:41.825 --> 00:52:44.728 align:start size:97% position:3%
every one of those came
down to the simple question,

00:52:44.728 --> 00:52:45.929
what happened?

00:52:45.929 --> 00:52:47.731 align:start size:81% position:19%
Well, I had a Visa
card at Target

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.533
so they just canceled my card,

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:52.669 align:start size:97% position:3%
I think two days later FedEx
delivered me a new card.

00:52:52.669 --> 00:52:54.404
That was the last
I heard about it.

00:52:54.404 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start size:94% position:6%
Oh no, I had a debit
card, and they took $3,000

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:58.942
out of my checking account,

00:52:58.942 --> 00:53:01.411
and it took me two months
to get the $3,000 back

00:53:01.411 --> 00:53:04.748
while the bank said they
were investigating it.

00:53:04.748 --> 00:53:08.752
You do nothing for your
credit score whatsoever.

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:12.122 align:start position:0%
If you could use that debit
card 20 times a day for 20 years

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:13.323
your credit will
not move this much.

00:53:13.323 --> 00:53:16.593 align:start size:88% position:13%
So I had three sons that
went off to college.

00:53:16.593 --> 00:53:19.563
I said to them I'm not
giving you a debit card.

00:53:19.563 --> 00:53:22.666
I've actually applied for
a credit card in your name.

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:24.401
So it's your card.

00:53:24.401 --> 00:53:26.269
Of course you're 18
you have no credit.

00:53:26.269 --> 00:53:27.904
So I had to guarantee the card.

00:53:29.105 --> 00:53:30.574
And that means three
things will happen.

00:53:30.574 --> 00:53:32.842
One, the bill comes to me,
I'm responsible for the bill.

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:34.511
So if you're spending a
lot of time in the bar

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:36.046
I'm gonna know it.

00:53:36.046 --> 00:53:40.684
Two, every time I pay the bill
it's gonna go on your credit.

00:53:40.684 --> 00:53:42.886
So five years from now,
four years from now,

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:44.321
when you graduated from college

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:46.489 align:start size:88% position:13%
you should have a credit
score of about 800.

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.325
You want to buy a
car, buy a house,

00:53:48.325 --> 00:53:50.327
you can do that without
me you don't need me

00:53:50.327 --> 00:53:52.162
to do that for you.

00:53:52.162 --> 00:53:53.930
And of course I control
the limit on the card,

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:56.233 align:start size:94% position:6%
so whatever I think you
need to spend every month,

00:53:56.233 --> 00:53:58.235 align:start size:81% position:19%
that'll be the
limit of the card.

00:53:58.235 --> 00:53:59.803
One of the best things you
can do for your children

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:03.340 line:0%
is to teach them early on to
build credit in their name.

00:54:03.340 --> 00:54:06.076 line:0%
We have a lot of young people
now only use a debit card.

00:54:06.076 --> 00:54:08.878
They graduate from college,
they come back to Fargo,

00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.580
they get a beautiful job.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:13.483
They go down to rent
an apartment, they
fill out the lease,

00:54:13.483 --> 00:54:15.518 align:start size:88% position:13%
and the manager says
son, you have no credit.

00:54:15.518 --> 00:54:17.854
You don't even have a credit
file with the credit bureau.

00:54:17.854 --> 00:54:21.391
So you're gonna have to have
your parents co-sign the lease.

00:54:21.391 --> 00:54:23.426
So one of the best
things you can do

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:24.894
is teach them to build credit.

00:54:24.894 --> 00:54:26.763
You know 30 years ago credit
was all about do I get the car,

00:54:26.763 --> 00:54:27.998
do I get the home.

00:54:27.998 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start size:84% position:16%
Everything today,
everything literally

00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:31.901
is based on your credit.

00:54:31.901 --> 00:54:34.237 align:start size:94% position:6%
So if you apply for a job,
they check your credit.

00:54:34.237 --> 00:54:36.506 align:start size:97% position:3%
You apply for auto insurance,
they check your credit.

00:54:36.506 --> 00:54:38.775
Life insurance, they
check your credit.

00:54:38.775 --> 00:54:40.644 align:start size:84% position:16%
Health insurance, they
check your credit.

00:54:40.644 --> 00:54:42.479
No matter what it is,
open a bank account,

00:54:42.479 --> 00:54:43.647
they check your credit.

00:54:43.647 --> 00:54:46.082 align:start size:84% position:16%
So everything is
based on your credit,

00:54:46.082 --> 00:54:48.618
and it's very important
to teach young people

00:54:48.618 --> 00:54:50.787
to build credit and
use that credit.

00:54:50.787 --> 00:54:53.223
And then finally I would
say freeze your credit.

00:54:53.223 --> 00:54:55.025
And if you don't want
to freeze your credit

00:54:55.025 --> 00:54:56.760
then use a credit
monitoring service,

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.728
they're are like
$13, $15 a month,

00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:01.131
companies like Life
Lock, Privacy Guard,

00:55:01.131 --> 00:55:03.066
where they monitor
your credit for you

00:55:03.066 --> 00:55:04.601
and notify you in real time

00:55:04.601 --> 00:55:06.469 align:start size:88% position:13%
if someone's attempting
to use your name,

00:55:06.469 --> 00:55:08.038 align:start size:84% position:16%
social security
number, date of birth,

00:55:08.038 --> 00:55:09.973 align:start size:84% position:16%
or some of that
personal information

00:55:09.973 --> 00:55:12.042 align:start size:84% position:16%
so you can do
something about it.

00:55:12.042 --> 00:55:15.412
You have to be proactive,
you can't be reactive.

00:55:15.412 --> 00:55:17.781
This is not 30 years ago,

00:55:17.781 --> 00:55:19.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
you have to be a
smarter consumer today.

00:55:19.683 --> 00:55:21.551
You certainly have to be a
smarter businessman today.

00:55:21.551 --> 00:55:23.219
So you cannot rely
on the government,

00:55:23.219 --> 00:55:24.521
you cannot rely on the bank,

00:55:24.521 --> 00:55:26.856
you cannot rely on the
police to protect you.

00:55:26.856 --> 00:55:29.326
You have to learn
to protect yourself

00:55:29.326 --> 00:55:31.461
and take the steps
necessary to do that.

00:55:31.461 --> 00:55:33.229
