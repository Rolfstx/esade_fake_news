00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:17.649
How are you?

00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:20.850
This is very exciting -
very, very exciting.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:21.961
I love Nashville.

00:00:21.961 --> 00:00:23.816
It's one of my favorite towns.

00:00:23.816 --> 00:00:28.429
I'm here to ask you guys
a very specific question:

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.289
What do I want?

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:34.399
What do you want?

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.439
Have you ever asked yourself
that question, what do I want?

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:41.534
I never really did until about 2005.

00:00:41.914 --> 00:00:43.270
A little background.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.519
I was born and raised
in Hollywood, California.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.389
A first-generation American.

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.950
It's where my parents moved to
after they met in New York in the '50s.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.550
My dad.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.900
My dad was Bulgarian.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.387
He spoke five languages.

00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:02.805
He was an incredible man.

00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:04.849
He was beloved by everyone
who knew him.

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:07.120
He had so much integrity.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.930
But he lived in Bulgaria.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.710
And he wanted a better life.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.300
He was drafted into the Bulgarian Army

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.520
at 19 years old,

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.883
and while he was there,
one day, in passing,

00:01:20.883 --> 00:01:25.761
he sees that there are 12 seltzer bottles
sitting on the back of a truck.

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:28.209
And he looks around, and nobody's there,

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:29.540
and he takes them.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.035
I don't know why he took them.

00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:33.052
For no reason

00:01:33.052 --> 00:01:37.240
other than probably he wanted to give them
to his father, who had a little inn.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.560
But he was caught, and the Bulgarian Army
decided to make an example out of him.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.630
And so they sentenced him
to three years and four months in jail,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.380
which he did.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.860
He got out early, at three years,
for good behavior.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.930
He decided to stay in Plovdiv,
the town where the jail was,

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.600
and he eventually met a young woman,
and they got married.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.393
Soon she was pregnant,

00:02:03.393 --> 00:02:08.420
and while she was giving birth,
she died in labor.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.870
Their son was born,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.840
but my brother Emil
died four months later.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.060
My dad, I think, experienced trauma -

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.510
he wanted to be free.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.377
He wanted to leave this communism.

00:02:26.377 --> 00:02:29.957
And so he thought,
"I want to go to America."

00:02:29.957 --> 00:02:33.724
Not so easy to do - you can't just leave
a communist country.

00:02:33.724 --> 00:02:37.560
So he tried to escape,
and they caught him.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.880
And they put him into a forced labor camp.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.513
While he was in this forced labor camp,
he saw a pattern starting to develop.

00:02:47.513 --> 00:02:51.290
He was a coal miner,
and he was working during the days,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.530
but he noticed that at night
these trains would come in,

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.390
and these trains blocked a certain
visual point where the guards were.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.980
And he became friends with the guard,
and he said to this guard,

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.247
bribing him with a pack of cigarettes
or a carton of cigarettes:

00:03:07.247 --> 00:03:10.200
"Listen, do you think
I can get on the night shift?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.430
I'm more of a night person."

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.870
And so the guy said, "Okay."

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.565
So my dad now has a plan.

00:03:17.565 --> 00:03:21.670
He starts looking at all of the trains
and when they come in,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.940
and he's starting to see the pattern.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.750
And one night, on the night shift,
at about 1:30 in the morning,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.857
he says to the other people
and the guards,

00:03:31.857 --> 00:03:33.707
"Listen, it's getting a little chilly.

00:03:33.707 --> 00:03:36.850
Do you think I can go down
and get some firewood for the fire?"

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.670
And they said,
"I think that's a good idea."

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.220
And he said, "Can I bring
my friend Richard with me

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.690
because the two of us will save time?"

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.511
So the guard said, "Okay."

00:03:48.121 --> 00:03:51.220
They timed it perfectly,
the trains came up,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.050
they shot between two train cars,

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.741
and they ran, and they ran, and they ran,

00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:58.903
and they continued running.

00:03:58.903 --> 00:04:02.040
And by the time they realized
that they were gone,

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.830
they were too far ahead to be found.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.800
They got a job on a boat -

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.820
well, my dad did,
and he was the stevedore,

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.230
the guy that shoveled
the coal on the boat.

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.786
And that boat was coming to America.

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.073
But there was only one job,

00:04:15.073 --> 00:04:18.261
so he decided to ask if he could bring
his friend Richard with them,

00:04:18.261 --> 00:04:19.550
and they said, "No."

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:22.490
So my dad stowed Richard away on the ship.

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.890
(Laughter)

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.170
They eventually made it to Philadelphia,

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.270
where they left the ship to be in America,

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.800
and never turned back.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.835
And that's where my parents
met, in New York City,

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:41.550
because my dad had the courage
to understand what it was that he wanted:

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.570
he wanted to be free.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.720
He wanted to come to America.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.805
And he did that.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.230
My mom.

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.190
My mom was Greek.

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.107
My mom was Greek,
but she was born in America.

00:04:57.727 --> 00:04:59.744
And when she was four years old,

00:04:59.744 --> 00:05:03.520
her family, who was doing well in America
and they were all American citizens,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.222
decided to go back to their village,

00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:08.990
which was on the border
of Albania and Greece,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.380
but technically in Albania.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.979
And there,

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.050
during that wonderful summer of vacation,

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.980
this little American family
was struck with tragedy:

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.050
her father died unexpectedly.

00:05:22.802 --> 00:05:28.394
And my grandmother was now a widow
with four children under the age of 10.

00:05:29.778 --> 00:05:32.029
And the [Greek] relatives said,

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:33.840
"Stay in the village.

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.220
What is a widow with four children
going to do in America?"

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.390
And so now you have
these American citizens

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.876
that have left their home

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:48.610
back in this village that was not the home
any of the kids knew.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.080
It was just the home for now.

00:05:52.474 --> 00:05:55.622
So they stayed,

00:05:55.622 --> 00:05:57.370
and they stayed for a few years.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.510
But war started to break out,
and soon after the war,

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.433
which was now occupied by Italians
that were working with the Nazis -

00:06:05.433 --> 00:06:07.420
armed guards everywhere -

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.688
they knew that it was getting rougher
and they were going to have to leave.

00:06:12.938 --> 00:06:14.590
But they didn't know how.

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.960
Now, you have to understand something.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.770
When my mom was talking
about escaping these mountains -

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.419
I grew up in the Hollywood Hills -

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:26.020
I thought it was going to be 
like little rolling hills

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.620
like you see in the movies
where the Hollywood sign is.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.730
But no, there were more mountains.

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:36.938
The mountains were huge,
but they came up with a plan.

00:06:36.938 --> 00:06:38.720
And the plan was this:

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:43.241
my family was going to go at night,

00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:45.200
when they weren't going to be suspicious,

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.386
when everybody was thinking
they were sleeping,

00:06:47.386 --> 00:06:50.120
when there was no reason to think
anybody would ever leave

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.550
in the middle of the night.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.770
But there was a hitch.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:59.760
My mom found out there was a letter
that was supposed to arrive the next day.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.248
And if somebody was not there
to receive this letter,

00:07:03.248 --> 00:07:06.490
the guards would know they had left.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:07.915
This was a tiny village.

00:07:07.915 --> 00:07:10.500
They would recognize if you weren't there.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.861
And so my mom had to ask
herself the question:

00:07:13.861 --> 00:07:15.270
What do I want?

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.150
What do I want?

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:19.310
I want to go home.

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.555
So she decided to volunteer
to be the one to stay behind.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:29.660
Her family went on ahead,
she waited, she got the letter,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:35.940
and the next night, she went by herself
over those huge mountains

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:39.642
to meet her family, who was waiting
on the other side in Greece

00:07:39.642 --> 00:07:45.150
so that they could go back to Athens,
renew their passports and come to America.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.210
That's how they end up
in Hollywood, where I'm born.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.650
And my parents accomplished
the most amazing things:

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.710
they were able to ask themselves
what they wanted

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.039
and take the steps to make it happen.

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:04.388
And here I was, I was able
to start a career at 14 years old,

00:08:04.388 --> 00:08:06.918
modeling and doing the Brady Bunch -

00:08:07.104 --> 00:08:08.820
some might know that episode.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.455
Pat Conway, Greg, chose me
to be head cheerleader,

00:08:13.455 --> 00:08:15.640
not Marcia or his girlfriend.

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.395
(Laughter)

00:08:18.075 --> 00:08:20.810
And I loved my life.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.690
And my dad was a bartender.

00:08:22.690 --> 00:08:26.535
And I remember putting
the little coins, that he would make,

00:08:26.535 --> 00:08:28.708
from his tip bag together on Saturdays,

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:30.265
and those would go to the bank.

00:08:30.265 --> 00:08:33.790
I didn't think I wanted to be
more successful than my parents.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:38.399
I wanted to be like my parents
because of what they did.

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:42.370
They allowed me to have dreams
to do things that I wanted to do,

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.467
to be an actor,

00:08:43.467 --> 00:08:46.071
because of the risks that they had taken.

00:08:46.071 --> 00:08:48.819
And so I just wanted to be with them,

00:08:48.819 --> 00:08:51.564
and I never thought
that I could have anything else

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:53.528
or could even want anything else.

00:08:54.129 --> 00:08:57.069
Success to them was living without fear,

00:08:57.069 --> 00:08:59.623
was living in a free country.

00:08:59.623 --> 00:09:01.636
And then in 2005,

00:09:02.376 --> 00:09:05.239
I read an article that changed my life.

00:09:06.089 --> 00:09:09.470
It was an interview
that was with Oprah Winfrey.

00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.349
And the reporter was asking Oprah,

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:16.865
"I don't understand it, Oprah,
how do you do all the things that you do?

00:09:16.865 --> 00:09:21.599
You have a TV show, you write books,
you do speeches, you act in movies,

00:09:21.599 --> 00:09:23.869
you produce movies and TV series.

00:09:23.869 --> 00:09:25.470
How do you do it?"

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.310
And she said, "Well,
I know what it is that I want.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:34.270
And when you know
what it is that you want,

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:37.409
you can take the steps
to make that happen.

00:09:38.246 --> 00:09:41.756
Most people don't know
what it is that they want."

00:09:42.576 --> 00:09:44.060
What do I want?

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.720
That was a terrifying question to me.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.940
How could I even want anything?

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:56.404
Like, I felt that that's a question
you can't ask yourself.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.560
That is something
other people can ask, but not me.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.045
Why?

00:10:03.045 --> 00:10:04.290
I had everything.

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:07.449
In 2005, I had the greatest parents.

00:10:07.449 --> 00:10:09.929
I had an amazing husband, children.

00:10:09.969 --> 00:10:11.769
We had our health.

00:10:11.769 --> 00:10:13.340
We were living the life.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:15.744
To ask a question like "What do I want?"

00:10:15.744 --> 00:10:17.069
felt selfish.

00:10:17.409 --> 00:10:18.569
It felt greedy.

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:20.439
It felt that I couldn't.

00:10:20.979 --> 00:10:22.989
And so I didn't ask the question.

00:10:22.989 --> 00:10:26.190
I tried to ask it,
but I kept getting shut down.

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:31.320
I wouldn't even allow myself the fantasy
of asking that question.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.920
But as an actor, we have an actors' game
and that's called "What if?"

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.189
So I started thinking,

00:10:37.189 --> 00:10:41.239
"What if I could want something,
what would it be?"

00:10:41.399 --> 00:10:42.719
What if?

00:10:43.119 --> 00:10:46.824
And so I'd go jogging,
and I'd go walking, and I'd go hiking,

00:10:46.824 --> 00:10:49.460
and I'd be asking myself that question.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.879
What if I could want something,
what would it be?

00:10:53.566 --> 00:10:57.000
And one day, the answer came to me.

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:00.301
Music.

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:04.779
Music was the thing that gave me joy.

00:11:05.242 --> 00:11:09.350
When I look back
on what gave me joy as a child,

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:10.580
it was music.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.490
I would sing "Ode to Billy Joe"
at the drop of a hat.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.330
And by the way, what the heck
is going on in that song?

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:18.360
(Laughter)

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.350
My mom and I would drive in the [car];

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:21.980
I would hear music on the radio,

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.429
and she would say things to me
in her Greek accent

00:11:24.429 --> 00:11:27.315
like "That song going to be a hit."

00:11:27.315 --> 00:11:28.320
(Laughter)

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:29.920
And we would sing along.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.870
I took a job as a ticket-taker
at a concert venue

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:36.830
called the Universal Amphitheatre,

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.478
because all summer long
I could take the tickets,

00:11:40.478 --> 00:11:43.050
but we were allowed to watch the concerts.

00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.889
And I would sit on those steps,

00:11:44.889 --> 00:11:49.465
and I would watch the artists
come through all summer - all the greats.

00:11:49.465 --> 00:11:52.880
And I thought to myself,
"How? How do they do it?

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.373
How do they get up there?

00:11:54.373 --> 00:11:56.770
How do they get in a band?

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.960
How do you write music?

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:00.650
How long does it take
to learn an instrument?"

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:02.990
I didn't know how to make that happen.

00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:04.560
There wasn't YouTube at the time.

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:07.297
My dad was a bartender;
my mom was a house maker -

00:12:07.297 --> 00:12:09.613
nobody in the business that I knew -

00:12:09.613 --> 00:12:12.110
but I wanted it so badly.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.660
So back to 2005,
I get this epiphany of music,

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.900
and shortly thereafter,
I'm having a meeting with my agency.

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.000
And I walk into the office,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.425
and they asked me the typical question

00:12:25.425 --> 00:12:27.540
when you're having a meeting
with your agent:

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.520
"So, Rita, tell us
what it is that you want.

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:32.710
What do you want to do?"

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:37.410
And I said the words,

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:38.990
"Music.

00:12:40.167 --> 00:12:43.127
I wouldn't mind doing a musical."

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:47.560
And it felt like I was standing there

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.070
like in that dream when you're naked

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.210
(Laughter)

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:53.590
and everybody is staring at you

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:56.150
and you know it, but you can't move.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.780
That's what it felt like.

00:12:58.780 --> 00:13:02.840
And they looked at me like, "Hmm, music."

00:13:03.316 --> 00:13:06.250
They had never heard that from me before.

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:12.930
So sometimes the universe conspires
to work with you, not against you.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:15.600
And I promise you this.

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:19.111
The very next day, I got a call.

00:13:19.111 --> 00:13:20.854
And they said, "Rita,

00:13:20.854 --> 00:13:27.259
you have an offer to play Roxie Hart
in the musical 'Chicago' on Broadway."

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:32.670
I really couldn't believe it -
I called my friend Nora Ephron,

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.468
and I said, "Nora" -

00:13:34.468 --> 00:13:37.689
you know who she is,
the amazing screenwriter and director -

00:13:37.689 --> 00:13:41.749
and I said "Nora, I've been offered
this musical on Broadway, 'Chicago.'

00:13:41.749 --> 00:13:42.960
What should I do?"

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:48.039
And she said, "Well, you should go see it,
make sure it's in good shape."

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:49.824
(Laughter)

00:13:50.974 --> 00:13:53.029
So I was like, "Okay."

00:13:53.729 --> 00:13:57.900
So I get my husband, I get my daughter,
and we fly off to New York,

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.189
and we go see the musical "Chicago."

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.075
It is fantastic.

00:14:04.285 --> 00:14:05.822
Everybody is incredible -

00:14:05.822 --> 00:14:08.946
the Bob Fosse choreography,
the jazz hands,

00:14:08.946 --> 00:14:11.990
the singing, the dancing, the laughter -

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:13.720
it was incredible!

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.335
And during the intermission,

00:14:17.275 --> 00:14:19.810
I turned to my husband, and I said,

00:14:21.242 --> 00:14:23.410
(Laughter)

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.980
"There is no way I am doing this musical."

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:30.690
(Laughter)

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:34.990
And he said, "You are doing this."

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.113
I said, "I'm too terrified;
I can't do this."

00:14:38.113 --> 00:14:40.980
I turn to my daughter,
hoping that she would agree.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.420
And she said, "No,
you're 1,000% doing this."

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.000
And I think sometimes
the people you love

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.870
know what it is that you should be doing
before you even do it.

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.665
And so I did "Chicago The Musical"

00:14:56.665 --> 00:14:57.930
on Broadway.

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.620
(Applause)

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:05.790
And it changed my life.

00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:07.140
It changed my life.

00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.340
I got to sing every day.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:11.652
I got to sing great songs every day.

00:15:11.652 --> 00:15:13.085
I met amazing people.

00:15:13.085 --> 00:15:14.630
I had a community.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.570
It led me to the mission statement -
my personal mission statement -

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:22.069
that I was only going to do projects
that had music in them.

00:15:22.069 --> 00:15:26.838
And fortunately, I found
an ABBA musical called "Mamma Mia"

00:15:26.838 --> 00:15:31.530
that my husband and I made
into its movie and sequel.

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:35.630
I wanted to do a musical
based on '70s music,

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.973
and met with a friend of mine
who was an A&amp;R guy at a label.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.676
And I was telling him the ideas,

00:15:40.676 --> 00:15:44.440
and he said, "Well, why don't you
make an album out of this first

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.460
and see if you - where it goes."

00:15:46.460 --> 00:15:48.249
I said, "But I'm not a singer;

00:15:48.249 --> 00:15:50.277
I did a musical, but I'm not a singer."

00:15:50.277 --> 00:15:53.185
He says, "Just meet a friend of mine
who's a producer."

00:15:53.185 --> 00:15:57.970
And before you knew it, I was making
an album of cover songs called "AM/FM."

00:15:59.261 --> 00:16:03.209
Going to the studio every day,
I was so happy.

00:16:03.209 --> 00:16:08.980
I can't even tell you the endorphin high
I got out of singing every day.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.905
And then another miracle happened:

00:16:12.945 --> 00:16:15.280
I met Kara DioGuardi.

00:16:15.700 --> 00:16:19.050
Kara DioGuardi was also a gift
that "Chicago" gave me.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.995
She's an amazing songwriter, producer.

00:16:21.995 --> 00:16:25.491
Some of you may know her
from being a judge on American Idol.

00:16:25.491 --> 00:16:28.180
And our dance captain,
Greg Butler from "Chicago" said,

00:16:28.180 --> 00:16:30.770
"You would love Kara -
you should meet her."

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:32.830
And we met.

00:16:33.456 --> 00:16:36.540
And she said to me,
"Rita, tell me something.

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.070
What is it that you want?"

00:16:40.890 --> 00:16:44.930
And I said, "Oh my gosh, Kara,
there's that question again.

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.219
I would love to be a songwriter.

00:16:47.326 --> 00:16:51.150
I would love to write,
but I don't play an instrument.

00:16:51.739 --> 00:16:53.180
I don't do that.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.040
I don't read music like you do."

00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.260
And she says, "I don't play instruments
or read music either."

00:16:58.979 --> 00:17:00.837
She asked me a question:

00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:03.790
"Do you have something you want to say?"

00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.070
And I said that I have a lot
that I want to say.

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:10.771
So she said, "You know what?

00:17:10.771 --> 00:17:13.190
I'm going to write
those first two songs with you."

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:15.887
And she brought in
another writer, Jason Reeves,

00:17:15.887 --> 00:17:18.000
and we wrote my first two songs.

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:21.490
After that, I started coming to Nashville,

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.440
and I met an incredible community
of musicians that I write with,

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.276
here in this amazing town of yours.

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.402
And it was in 2015,

00:17:31.402 --> 00:17:34.490
when I was working
on my first album of original music,

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:36.590
things that I had written,

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.344
that I heard the words
that you never want to hear:

00:17:41.754 --> 00:17:43.542
"You have cancer."

00:17:45.212 --> 00:17:47.007
Couldn't believe it.

00:17:48.457 --> 00:17:50.090
You have cancer.

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:56.655
I was doing a play on Broadway,
and it shocked me.

00:17:57.330 --> 00:17:59.485
And I thought to myself,

00:18:00.265 --> 00:18:02.020
"This is what happens.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:04.490
Every day is one day at a time."

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.210
But I also knew -

00:18:07.570 --> 00:18:09.795
even though I was going to have

00:18:09.795 --> 00:18:12.020
a bilateral mastectomy
and reconstruction -

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:16.890
that there were some things
I had to get off my chest.

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.800
(Laughter)

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:24.540
And I had to ask myself "What do I want?"

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:29.862
And so, I had some things that I wanted.

00:18:29.862 --> 00:18:32.177
I wanted to have
some discussions with my family.

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.689
I wanted to talk to my husband.

00:18:34.099 --> 00:18:36.613
And I told my husband
that I wanted two things:

00:18:37.213 --> 00:18:39.500
that if I were to die before him,

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:43.430
that I wanted him to be very sad
for a very long time

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:44.960
(Laughter)

00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.320
and that I also wanted to have a party.

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:52.920
I wanted to have a celebration.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:59.090
I wanted it to be about life and joy
and telling stories and having sparklers

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.420
and having a good time!

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.820
Because I had found joy.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.350
I was happy.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:07.995
I was happy to be alive.

00:19:07.995 --> 00:19:09.880
I was happy to be songwriting.

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.871
I was happy to have found my passion.

00:19:15.941 --> 00:19:17.590
Now my parents,

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:19.305
they came to this country.

00:19:19.305 --> 00:19:22.990
They exhibited enormous, enormous courage.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.950
My dad knew what he wanted.

00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.510
He wanted to be free.

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.250
He wanted to live in America.

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:32.834
My mom knew that she wanted
to come home.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.720
Now I'm not at all equating
the risks that my parents took

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.930
to the risk of being able to say
you want to write music.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.830
But sometimes it feels that way.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:49.340
When I sign CDs after a show,
and people come up to me and they say,

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.230
"I can't believe you're doing this now.

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.580
This is so incredible.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:55.680
I've always wanted to ... "
and then fill in the blank.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:59.044
Because we get the message
somewhere in our life

00:19:59.044 --> 00:20:01.997
that you're joyfully saying,
"I love singing,"

00:20:01.997 --> 00:20:03.679
and somebody goes, "You can't sing.

00:20:03.679 --> 00:20:05.040
You're tone-deaf."

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.426
Or you're dancing,
and you're having the best time,

00:20:07.426 --> 00:20:09.660
and everybody's like,
"You have two left feet."

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:13.834
Or you say to your parents,
"I want to be a poet."

00:20:13.834 --> 00:20:17.810
They say, "If you're going to be a poet,
I'm not paying for you to go to college."

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:19.895
And those dreams are squashed,

00:20:19.895 --> 00:20:21.922
and you're put into your corner,

00:20:21.922 --> 00:20:24.070
and you go off and you do something else.

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:26.890
And maybe you're not that happy.

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.910
And maybe that little dream
is still living inside of you.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.490
And that, to me, was what I had found.

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:41.690
I was lucky enough to find that
and answer that question.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.145
Music gives me joy -

00:20:44.145 --> 00:20:45.320
I chose this picture

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:49.480
because this is exactly what I feel like
in my body when I'm singing.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.240
It is an exhilaration.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:58.667
It's never too late to find out
what it is that you want.

00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.256
At that songwriting camp that I did -

00:21:03.256 --> 00:21:07.750
you saw that picture with all
these amazing Nashville songwriters -

00:21:08.399 --> 00:21:11.632
I had this title of a song
that was about that experience,

00:21:11.632 --> 00:21:14.245
about what it was that I wanted

00:21:14.465 --> 00:21:17.410
if I were to go
before my husband and family.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.310
And I was able and lucky enough

00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:26.500
to write it with Kristian Bush
and Liz Rose, two amazing songwriters.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.110
I'm going to sing that song for you.

00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:30.755
But as we're setting up,

00:21:30.755 --> 00:21:35.070
I want you to think about
what it is that you want.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.377
Ask yourself that question.

00:21:37.377 --> 00:21:38.732
You may know it instantly.

00:21:38.732 --> 00:21:43.090
It may take you three months,
three years to come up with the answer.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.800
But I want you to know
that it's never too late

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.480
to ask yourself that question:

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.710
"What do I do want?"

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:52.073
Thank you.

00:21:52.073 --> 00:21:54.181
(Applause)
