00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.381 align:start position:0%
I'M A LITTLE HUNGRY.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.817 align:start position:0%
I'M THINKING OF COOKING SOME RED
BEANS AND RICE.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.752 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHOO!

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:20.553 align:start position:0%

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.524 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, EXACTLY.

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:30.530 align:start position:0%
MY MOM'S RECIPE, ONE OF THE
PRODUCERS ON THE SHOW'S COOKED

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:34.734

HIM.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.503 align:start position:0%
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO DRY ICE HIM
MY PLATE.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:39.772 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S A RED BEAN

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:43.976 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE
CALL IT, THE RED BEAN THROW

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.244 align:start position:0%
DOWN.

00:00:45.277 --> 00:00:47.280
AND YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE THE RIGHT
INGREDIENTS AND I JUST GOT THEM

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.315 align:start position:0%
SHIPPED IN, SO I'M ABOUT TO DO
IT.

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:50.416 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GOOD LUCK WITH
THAT.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:51.684 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Jon: YES, YES.

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:52.485 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SAVE ME SOME.

00:00:52.518 --> 00:00:53.753 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Jon: OH, I WILL.

00:00:53.786 --> 00:00:56.789
THEY MIGHT TURN BY THE TIME WE
SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN, BUT I'LL

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:58.357 align:start position:0%

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:58.924 align:start position:0%

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:52.712
WELL, I BELIEVE MAKING THOSE MEN

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.580 align:start position:0%
IS DANGEROUS AND IRRESPONSIBLE,
AND JAPAN SHOULD GO BACK TO

00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:14.800 size:81% position:41%
MIGHT START STRESS EATING.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:16.903 align:start position:0%
ONE MAJOR U.S. BOOKMAKER SAID
"HIS COMPANY DECIDED TO ADD SUMO

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:24.843 align:start position:0%

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:26.479
SO YOUR CO-WORKER WHO WON'T SHUT

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:47.166 align:start position:0%
WITHOUT A CROWD.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.668
