00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.866
Just like the rest of us,

00:00:01.866 --> 00:00:03.533
our first guest
was heartbroken to hear

00:00:03.533 --> 00:00:05.100
that Adam Levine got married.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.233
Take a look.

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:07.700
- I don't want you to be
too sad,

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.533
but I was gonna tell you,

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.166
Adam Levine got married.

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.700
- No.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.800
- He did.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
- No way!
[crying]

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.233
[laughter]

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:24.033
No, he didn't, Mommy!

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:29.266
Mommy, he didn't.

00:00:29.266 --> 00:00:31.933
- [laughs]
Oh, man.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.033
[applause]
I know.

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:36.933
So, please welcome
three-year-old Mila

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.366
and her mom Emily.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:40.433
So you've been wanting
to marry Adam for a long time?

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:42.066
- Yeah.
- He's, like, your boyfriend?

00:00:42.066 --> 00:00:43.233
- Yeah.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.733
- Have you ever talked to him
or anything?

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:46.333
- Mm...no.

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:47.933
- Well, you will, I mean,
if he's your boyfriend

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:49.533
at some point you will.
- Yeah.

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:50.700
- [laughs]
- Did you think--

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.533
How did you know that she was--
I mean, obviously,

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.466
you knew she loved him,

00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:57.333
but when did you know
that she'd react that way?

00:00:57.333 --> 00:00:59.200
- We were in the grocery store

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.666
and I think I said,

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:03.733
"Oh, Adam.
Adam got married."

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:05.200
And meltdown, so...

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.700
"Okay no. Let's go over here--
change the subject."

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.466
And then, I felt really bad,

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:15.500
but I told her again
and I filmed it.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.400
- You are s--
- [laughs]

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.300
And...and yeah, so...

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.100
- But then she got over it
really fast, right?

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.366
- Yeah, we turned on the radio.

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:27.000
We started singing
and, you know,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.733
3-year-old style...moved on.
- Yeah.

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:30.400
- You just moved on?
- But she still loves him?

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.866
- Yeah, you still love him
a whole lot, right?

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:33.033
- Yeah.
- Do you like him

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:34.533
or do you love him?
- I love him.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:37.033
- You love him.
audience: Aww.

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.100
- Well, if he ever met you
he would love you, too.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.666
Is he married?

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:42.833
Or he's not married,
right, Mila?

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:44.100
- He--yeah.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.666
- He is or he is not?

00:01:45.666 --> 00:01:47.300
- Um...he's not.
- He is married?

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.833
He's not married.

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:51.533
Good, okay.
'Cause--'cause, so...

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.366
but you're gonna marry him.
- Yeah.

00:01:53.366 --> 00:01:54.533
- Mm-kay, good.
- [laughs]

00:01:54.533 --> 00:01:55.800
- When do you think
you will marry him,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.666
and at what age?

00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.866
- I don't know.

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.600
- You're gonna wait
for a little while?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.400
'Cause you're too young now,
right?

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.133
So you think you'll wait till
you're like 7 or 8?

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.500
[laughter]
Yeah, good.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.200
All right, well,
I have an outfit for you

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.466
that I think you're gonna love
a whole lot, and it says...

00:02:10.466 --> 00:02:13.333
- [gasps and laughs]
- [giggling]

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:15.733
- That...yeah.
- Look at what's on there.

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:18.400
- And then you have pictures
of him all over.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.066
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh, Mila.

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:21.233
- Isn't that cute?
- Yeah.

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:23.200
- It's adorable.
- Yeah.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.200
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.533
- You're welcome.
- [laughs]

00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:32.966
- Okay, and I got you something
else that--it's not in this bag.

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:34.933
Where is it?
It's over there, I think.

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:36.100
[Maroon 5's "One More Night"]

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.266
- [singing]
And I know I said it

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:40.100
a million times

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.600
But I'll only stay
with you one more night

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.500
Try to tell you no

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.700
But my body
keeps on telling you yes

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.333
Try to tell you stop
but your lipstick--

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:55.000
[music ends]
- Look who it is.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.366
What do you say to Adam?
- [laughs]

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:57.466
Can I have a hug?
- Thank you.

00:02:57.466 --> 00:02:59.633
- Give him a hug.
- Can I have a hug?

00:02:59.633 --> 00:03:02.366
[cheers and applause]

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:05.033
- [chuckles]
Aw.

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.933
- Thank you so much.

00:03:10.933 --> 00:03:13.166
[laughs]
- I still love you.

00:03:13.166 --> 00:03:14.800
I still love you.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.133
I think she's changed his mind.
I don't know what happened.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.533
- She is--
- She is over it.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.500
- Yeah.
It's, uh, you know...

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:22.733
- It's--I mean, it's a lot.

00:03:22.733 --> 00:03:24.766
It's a lot to meet
the love of your life

00:03:24.766 --> 00:03:28.166
all of a sudden.
- Yeah.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.633
- [chuckles]
- What'd you do--I called you,

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:31.733
I asked if you saw the video
and you said you'd seen it.

00:03:31.733 --> 00:03:33.366
What did you think
when you saw it?

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:35.833
- It was kind of heartbreaking,
like--

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:37.700
But it was so unbelievably cute

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.666
and every single person
that I know

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:42.666
in my entire life...
- Sent it to you?

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:44.166
- Sent it to me.
- [laughs]

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:48.500
I think the first two people
were my wife--sorry, earmuffs.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.900
[laughter]

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.266
And then my mother,
and they're like,

00:03:51.266 --> 00:03:54.100
"This is so cute,"
and then we spoke...

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.100
- Yeah.
- And here we are.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.700
- And I think--
- And she's clearly transfixed.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.400
- Yeah.
[laughter]

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.166
I hate to tell you,
but I think it was Emily's plan

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:04.800
to get you here
for Emily to meet you, I--

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800
[laughter and applause]

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:10.933
That's what I think.
- Aha.

00:04:10.933 --> 00:04:12.566
- All right.
- But yeah, she's, like,

00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:13.833
the cutest person.
- Well, this is very exciting,

00:04:13.833 --> 00:04:15.666
and she's gonna be excited
later on.

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:17.533
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:04:17.533 --> 00:04:19.400
- How you doing?
- [mumbles]

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.633
- Who is it--Mila,
do you know who this is?

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:23.966
Who is this?

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:25.133
- Usher.

00:04:25.133 --> 00:04:28.266
[laughter]

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:30.600
- All right.
Well, we'll take a break,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.333
and do you--
- Oh, my gosh.

00:04:32.333 --> 00:04:34.466
- Do you still want this?
- I have the same outfit.

00:04:34.466 --> 00:04:37.000
- I thought you did.
- Go take your outfit.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.266
- All right.
- Get your outfit.

00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:41.166
We will, uh--I think...
audience: Aww.

00:04:41.166 --> 00:04:43.100
- No, Mila's seeing
someone else, I think.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.633
- [laughing]
- She's--she has moved on, so...

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:46.233
- All right. She's moved on.
