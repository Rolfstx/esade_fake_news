00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.870
A Lion Air Boeing 737

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.880
crashed into the sea this morning.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.450
Rescuers have located debris,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.600
but they do not expect
to find any survivors.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.530
Some of the warning signs, in retrospect

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.280
were there all along.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.180
Some of the decisions, or changes,

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.800
were so subtle that people
might not even have realized

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.293
the importance, as they were taking place.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.110
And Ethiopian Airlines flight

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.970
has crashed shortly after takeoff

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.970
from Addis Ababa, killing
all 157 passengers and crew

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.500
thought to be on board.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.770
Boeing's best-selling plane

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.140
is coming under increased scrutiny

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020
after another deadly accident.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.800
We'll do everything
possible to earn and re-earn

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.510
that trust and confidence

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.548
from our customers and the flying public

00:00:46.548 --> 00:00:48.893
in the weeks and months ahead.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.030
Boeing is an American icon,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.290
revered around the world for
its engineering innovation.

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.030
But with two crashes in under six months,

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.950
critics have asked if Boeing is straying

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.250
from its original mission.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.610
The SEC is investigating whether Boeing

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.920
properly disclosed issues
tied to the grounding

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.520
of its 737 Max Airliners.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.510
One message described the 737 Max

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.610
as a plane designed by
clowns, overseen by monkeys.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.420
The safety culture at Boeing was corrupted

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.180
under pressure from Wall Street,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.290
and executives, and board members

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.170
who were lookin' more at their bonuses

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.370
than they were at the
integrity of the organization.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.550
Boeing was playing a
game, to a certain extent.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.930
It was a game of numbers.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:36.990
They were meeting Wall
Street's expectations,

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.190
but unfortunately, that came

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.140
at the expense of the end
customer, and the flying public.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.430
The failures that happened at Boeing

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.170
are really complicated,
and involve subtle forces

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.730
and cultural changes
that have been underway

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.370
for decades at the company.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.550
This is a story of how

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.770
an American icon lost its way,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.913
and whether or not it can find it again.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.420
2019 was not the best year for Boeing.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.970
Just five months apart, two
Boeing 737 Max planes crashed,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.330
and the planes have been
grounded since March of 2019.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.080
There's simply no precedent, in aviation,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.067
for a plane this important
to be grounded this long.

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:23.250
In the first crash, Lion air flight 610,

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.600
something was discovered with
the technology on the plane.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.650
Investigators believe the plane's sensors

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.770
or its computers, had bad data
suggesting a potential stall.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.360
There was this software system,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.140
known as MCAST, that stands for

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.160
maneuvering characteristics
augmentation system.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.160
This obscure flight control software

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.400
was created so the Max handled
the same way for pilots

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.450
as the previous generation of 737s.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.180
Black box data indicated that

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.550
a bad sensor had triggered MCAST,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.540
which automatically pushed the plane down.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.040
Within probably 24 hours
of them discovering this,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.950
Boeing and the FAA put out a warning,

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.690
indicating that this could occur,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.410
and then also telling
them how to counteract it.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.110
There is a fix, simply flipping a switch

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.460
should have turned the
automatic system off.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.510
The second crash,
however, the same failure.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.960
I've covered dozens and
dozens of plane crashes,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.080
and one of my mantras has always been

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.260
that crashes don't occur
for the same cause.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.680
China grounded the plane,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.160
and it just set off a ripple effect.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.550
Any plane currently in the air

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.080
will go to its destination,
and thereafter be grounded.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.890
Boeing is an incredible company,

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:42.040
and hopefully they'll very
quickly come up with the answer.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.250
What had been billed as

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.083
a relatively simple software
fix proved not to be so simple.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.980
Every time it seemed like Boeing
was just around the corner,

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.780
then a new issue cropped up.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.610
MCAST wasn't the only
issue on this airplane,

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.430
you had issues where the computers

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.220
were getting overloaded with information,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.470
now there's a new issue that

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.950
the computers don't start up properly,

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.050
when you want them to.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.040
And then, the first batch of

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.100
really embarrassing
employee emails leaked.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.260
The FAA is demanding answers from Boeing

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.270
after they waited months
to disclose to the agency

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.820
internal messages between test pilots

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.277
who were working in the
737 Max flight simulator.

00:04:25.277 --> 00:04:27.810
"It's running rampant in the sim on me."

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.197
One pilot, referencing
the flight simulator.

00:04:30.197 --> 00:04:32.650
"The plane is trimming itself like crazy."

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.880
The emails came out two weeks before

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.800
Boeing's Chief Executive,
Dennis Muilenburg,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.350
was due to testify before Congress,

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:43.550
and it was a bipartisan shellacking.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.850
346 people are dead

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.850
because what these chief
pilots describe as egregious.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.490
You're the CEO, the buck stops with you,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.870
did you read this document,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.000
and how did your team not
put it in front of you,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.210
run in with their hair on fire, sayin'

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.977
'We got a real problem here.'

00:05:05.032 --> 00:05:06.930
Ultimately, we don't quite know

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.420
exactly what caused the MCAST design,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.160
just like we don't know all
the causes of the crash,

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.460
we don't quite know, but it's very clear

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.510
that the one big cultural change at Boeing

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:19.910
had been a disruption in the communication

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.490
between engineers and top management.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.990
But this kind of cultural change

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.680
for a company as old as
Boeing happens slowly,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.850
over the course of not years, but decades.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.420
Boeing's history goes back over a century,

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.010
and while its early sea
planes weren't iconic,

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:38.690
by World War Two, their
military aircraft were.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.660
When news of the successful raid

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.770
by the Flying Fortresses comes in,

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.020
these are the people who
get the biggest thrill,

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.920
the thousands of Boeing
workers who build them.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.150
Boeing's an American manufacturing icon.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.370
It was churning out bombers

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.460
that were critical to the
allied defense effort,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.800
and gave us Rosie the Riveter.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.204
Sort of a symbol for
American can-do culture.

00:06:02.204 --> 00:06:04.110
Employers find that women can do

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.710
many jobs as well as
men, some jobs better.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.400
They were the great survivors
of the post-World War Two

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.670
shakedown in aircraft design,

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.520
and the most successful new entrant

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.950
in the new jetliner
market of the late 1950s.

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.270
The company gambled
everything on a prototype

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:24.900
of what became its first
jetliner, the Boeing 707.

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.740
Nearing completion

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.010
in the Boeing plant at Seattle,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.610
America's first jet transport

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.830
is a unit of glistening beauty.

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:34.900
And that was followed by the 727,

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:39.230
and built this revolutionary
behemoth, the 747,

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.810
you probably know it for
the hump behind the nose,

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.640
and at the same time, they
came up with what became

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.680
Boeing's greatest commercial success,

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.603
and that was the 737.

00:06:51.777 --> 00:06:54.970
The 737 wasn't immediately successful.

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:57.410
It took several design
and engineering iterations

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.020
to turn it into the
plane that we see today.

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.490
It became a work horse for
airlines like Southwest,

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.000
that fly primarily shorter routes,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.300
and really brought travel
to every day people.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:12.590
And even as more and more

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:14.480
travelers flew on these aircraft,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.720
the aviation safety
record during this time

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.150
made flying one of the
statistically safest ways to travel.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:23.910
We've been the technology
leader in aviation in the world.

00:07:23.910 --> 00:07:26.130
Boeing was a magnificent company,

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:30.250
who made, in my opinion, the
best airplanes in the world,

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.430
until some of these
recent cultural changes,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.210
which all came from
pressure to Wall Street,

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.423
and bad management.

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:40.330
You know, over the years,

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.660
Boeing was this tremendously important

00:07:43.660 --> 00:07:45.150
and innovative company,

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.600
but it wasn't necessarily a great stock.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.940
In 1997, Boeing merged
with McDonnell Douglas,

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.550
another aerospace and defense giant.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.600
Boeing said

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.990
'let's do a merger, we'll
continue with the innovation,

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:00.143
'and maybe McDonnell Douglas will help us

00:08:00.143 --> 00:08:01.870
'in terms of our structure

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.550
'and telling our story to Wall Street.'

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:05.890
Almost immediately you began to hear

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:08.030
kind of a bitter joke
coming out of Seattle,

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:10.050
that McDonnell Douglas had used

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:11.500
Boeing's money to buy Boeing,

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:15.320
and certainly, in terms
of management structure,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.780
it began to look that way.

00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:19.650
Harry Stonecipher, a former GE executive

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.380
and McDonnell Douglas CEO,

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:24.690
becomes COO of the combined companies.

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:27.560
And more and more of the
company's style and culture

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.380
began to be more of a McDonnell
Douglas sort of picture.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.310
He almost immediately signaled

00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:36.112
there was a new sheriff in town,

00:08:36.112 --> 00:08:40.590
and he was gonna bring
financial disciple to Boeing.

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:43.030
Stonecipher would eventually become CEO,

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.620
and continued his emphasis on

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.950
controlling costs within the company.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.270
A culture that engineers
within the company

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.800
would begin to feel.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.063
We had breakfast with
the president of the--

00:08:53.063 --> 00:08:54.060
This is Stan Sorscher,

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.600
he was a physicist at
Boeing for over 20 years,

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.570
and felt these changes firsthand.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.049
And he said he was so proud of cutting his

00:09:01.049 --> 00:09:05.620
capital expenditure budgets by 60%.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.890
Capital expenditures, for us,

00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:10.470
were improvements in the
factory, in our shop floor,

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:13.960
in processes and materials
and things like that.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:18.490
By 2000, there was a great
deal of dissatisfaction

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.550
with the way our

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:23.160
problem solving culture
was being displaced,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.020
and we thought it was
just much more difficult

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.730
for us to do our job.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:28.299
And that's when a lot of people trace

00:09:28.299 --> 00:09:30.700
this sort of fundamental shift in thinking

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:32.440
in terms of what you prioritize,

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.590
whether that be profits, or
whether that be engineering.

00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:36.560
Further evidence of

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.270
a move away from engineering prowess

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:41.170
and innovation, to profit,
was Boeing's decision

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.520
to move company headquarters to Chicago,

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.150
when Boeing's jet manufacturing

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:48.230
and airplane designers were in Seattle.

00:09:48.230 --> 00:09:49.710
Probably the biggest motivation was

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.450
to send a message to the Street

00:09:51.450 --> 00:09:53.970
that this was a company
that was not going to make

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:57.280
investment decisions
on the basis of legacy,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.100
or heritage, or anything like that,

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.290
but rather, purely make
investment decisions

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:04.760
on the basis of returns,

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:07.590
and by moving to a place
where there were no

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:11.230
legacy loyalties, no heritage
production facilities,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:12.760
they were sending that message.

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.370
And it also started to shape how

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.560
Boeing viewed its own internal investments

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.270
in things like airplane programs,

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:25.950
tremendously important as the company

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:30.510
started planning for what
became the 787 Dreamliner.

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:31.890
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:34.903
your 787 Dreamliner.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.780
For this event, it was held
on July 8, 2007, so 787,

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.970
Tom Brokaw was there,

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:50.090
I was there just sitting in the audience,

00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:51.900
just trying to soak it all in.

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:53.590
I think they raised the factory door,

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:54.790
and there was the plane.

00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.700
But at the time, it was
just, it was an empty shell.

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.900
We didn't know it, but it
was all for appearances.

00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:05.880
For the 787, Boeing attempted

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.260
a new system for designing the aircraft.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.270
Instead of doing everything in house,

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.100
it would outsource much of the plane's

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.620
design and manufacturing
to its biggest suppliers.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.160
It was gonna be about outsourcing,

00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.500
outsourcing to the places where

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.439
we could produce things more cheaply,

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:23.070
as opposed to the finest, best,

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.320
safest airplanes in the world,

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.730
which is what Boeing made for decades.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:31.540
This works for running
shoes, ladies garments,

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:35.580
cell phones, hard drives,
integrated circuits,

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.000
it works for everybody, it'll
work for you, and I thought

00:11:40.174 --> 00:11:42.130
'No, it won't.'

00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:45.530
Boeing had never done a plane
using the system before,

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.630
this was very different from

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.690
Boeing controlling the processes itself,

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:54.020
and it did not go well.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:58.010
We launched the 787, the
worst I could think of

00:11:58.010 --> 00:11:59.980
was that we'd be three months late,

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.990
which is a shooting offense at Boeing.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:05.790
It wasn't three months late,
it was three years late,

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:08.120
it wasn't 5 billion dollars over budget,

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.690
it was 30 or 40 or 50
billion dollars over budget.

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.730
Grounded the fleet for three months.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:16.620
The suppliers were just
in over their heads,

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.530
most of them, we had years of issues,

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.740
there was an engine
explosion at one point,

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:27.085
there was an electrical fire
on flight test aircraft.

00:12:27.085 --> 00:12:27.918
And I thought

00:12:27.918 --> 00:12:29.477
'Okay, this experiment is done.'

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.103
This didn't work.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:35.140
And the executive said

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:38.970
'The business model is fine,
we just didn't execute it.'

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:41.090
Every new airplane has growing pains,

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.260
especially those that kind of

00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:45.300
push the edge of the
envelope in technology.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:46.730
Eventually, Boeing would fix

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.560
many of the 787's issues,

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:52.150
and the Dreamliner slowly
started to bring in big returns,

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.910
and with a profitable plane,

00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:55.660
Boeing looked at other measures

00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:58.240
to boost its returns to shareholders.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.700
There's different ways of
getting your profit up,

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:04.040
so one is just that you make
the best product imaginable,

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.640
and everybody wants to buy it,

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:06.730
and so your sales go up,

00:13:06.730 --> 00:13:08.780
and you make more money on that plane.

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.012
The other is that you do
financial engineering.

00:13:12.012 --> 00:13:13.440
One common technique

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.420
for companies to boost their stock price

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.970
is a practice known as stock buybacks,

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.820
where a company uses its capital

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:23.330
to buy back its own stock
from the marketplace.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:26.130
And the math is really
simple to understand,

00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.100
if you have fewer shares
trading, absent all else,

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:32.530
the price goes up, the shares worth more,

00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:34.770
they get a nice return
on their investment.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:36.350
Boeing's stock was on the rise,

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.580
and by 2015, new CEO Dennis Muilenburg

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:42.200
would ramp the program up even more.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:45.720
From 2014 to 2019,
Boeing would re-purchase

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.800
about 38 billion of its own shares.

00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.130
They went from a relatively
normal percentage,

00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:53.660
something like 30%, to over 90%

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.020
of cash being returned to investors.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.150
And the contrast to pensions being cut

00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:01.830
was really shocking,

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:04.343
and sort of a bitter
moment for some people.

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.460
Buying back shares, and
paying huge dividends,

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.770
while you're laying off senior engineers

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:15.590
to hire cheap labor in
India, that's a sickness.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:17.440
But while long time employees at Boeing

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.680
may have been frustrated, at the time,

00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:21.970
this was viewed as a huge success.

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:25.540
In less than a decade, the
company's stock price tripled.

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:29.230
Wall Street just loved this
company, its stock shot up.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.540
I see a new Boeing, I just
see just straight line growth.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:35.620
And Muilenburg was getting
the rockstar treatment.

00:14:35.620 --> 00:14:37.440
You're obviously a very
accomplished executive,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.210
you've done a great job for
Boeing and its shareholders,

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:42.330
I wish I had bought the
stock when you took over.

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:43.690
It's still a good deal.
Still a good deal.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.250
Around the same time all
of this was happening,

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:48.980
Boeing was selling record
numbers of its newest plane,

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.777
the 737 Max.

00:14:51.777 --> 00:14:56.470
The 737 Max was born out of
a competition with Airbus.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.900
The aviation industry is

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:00.320
a duopoly between Boeing and Airbus,

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.860
with the two giants controlling

00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.260
almost all of the jetliner market.

00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:06.980
For both companies, it's
beating commercial heart

00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.660
is an enormously profitable
family of single-aisle jets,

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.200
the Boeing 737, and Airbus A320.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.500
While Boeing had planned
to build an all-new jet

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.330
to replace the 737,

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:21.150
it was sidetracked by
the Dreamliner debacle.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:24.360
Airbus shocked everyone by
announcing a simple upgrade

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.550
to its A320 family of planes,

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.490
in what became known as the A320 Neo.

00:15:29.490 --> 00:15:31.060
Since the new planes had engines

00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:32.500
that increased fuel efficiency

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:35.530
and required no lengthy
training for pilots to fly,

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:38.340
it became a huge cost saver for airlines,

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:40.430
and a big hit for Airbus.

00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:43.860
So Boeing had to do the same thing,

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.200
if Boeing didn't act, or waited too long,

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.530
they could lose significant market share.

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.268
American Airlines called Boeing and said

00:15:52.268 --> 00:15:54.303
'We're gonna buy 400 planes,

00:15:55.822 --> 00:15:57.790
'and they will all be Airbus

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.280
'unless you can match their fuel economy,

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.710
'and the fact that no
pilot training is required,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.850
'it's identical to their
other Airbus models.'

00:16:06.850 --> 00:16:09.050
And the Boeing CEO said

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.410
'No no no no, we'll match that,

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:12.780
'we want half that order.'

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:16.800
With the Max, Boeing
was also trying to shake

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.271
the image of incompetence
that had followed

00:16:19.271 --> 00:16:21.560
the 787 debacle,

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.360
so there was a lot of pressure there,

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.390
to show that the,

00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:25.573
'Hey, look, we can design planes,

00:16:25.573 --> 00:16:28.060
'and we can meet deadlines with the Max.'

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:31.470
And to their credit,
with the Max, they did.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.723
Unfortunately for Boeing,

00:16:32.723 --> 00:16:36.530
some of the critical engineering
decisions that were made

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.810
came back to haunt them.

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:40.060
In late 2015,

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.590
Boeing's first 737 Max takes
shape, right on schedule.

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.170
Flight testing begins in early 2016,

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:50.660
and in 2017, the Max enters
the commercial market,

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.926
months early, and it is, in fact,

00:16:52.926 --> 00:16:56.160
that fastest selling
aircraft in company history.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.690
You saw huge orders
coming for both companies,

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:00.350
airlines seemed generally pleased with it,

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:02.020
and to be honest, they still are.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.620
Even after the crisis, some
of the biggest customers say

00:17:04.620 --> 00:17:06.280
'You know what, this is a good airplane.'

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.480
But internal emails,

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:09.230
made public from investigators,

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.080
revealed that Boeing had gone
to extraordinary measures

00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.840
to get the Max into the air,

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.960
including some employees lying to the FAA.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.970
The Chief Technical Pilot on the plane

00:17:19.970 --> 00:17:23.170
described how he used Jedi
mind tricks on regulators.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:25.577
In one exchange, a Boeing employee says

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:27.677
"I still haven't been forgiven by God

00:17:27.677 --> 00:17:30.000
"for the covering up I did last year."

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.140
The most disturbing thing we've found is,

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:34.680
there was a 2013 meeting,

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.890
and they conspired to conceal the system.

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:40.230
MCAST was created

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.530
so that the larger, more
fuel-efficient engines on the Max

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:46.020
wouldn't make the plane
handle any differently

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.190
than the previous generation of 737s.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:50.050
At that meeting, they said

00:17:50.050 --> 00:17:51.270
'Well wait a minute, wait a minute,

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:54.025
'if we tell anybody about this system,

00:17:54.025 --> 00:17:56.769
'then they might require that

00:17:56.769 --> 00:17:58.940
'pilots have additional training,

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:02.943
'and our bosses, from the top, in Boeing,

00:18:02.943 --> 00:18:05.910
'and our contracts with the airlines say

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.770
'no additional training required,

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:09.370
'so we have to conceal this,

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:11.820
'no one outside Boeing can know

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.750
'that this safety-critical system exists.'

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.400
Another week, another shakeup at Boeing.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:20.810
The company's former
CEO, Dennis Muilenburg,

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:23.220
forced out after 35
years with the company,

00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.200
and four years as CEO.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.820
After firing Muilenburg,

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.030
Boeing would close their books

00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:31.250
on one of the worst financial
performances in history,

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:34.450
estimating 18.6 billion in total costs

00:18:34.450 --> 00:18:36.670
for the grounded 737 Max,

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:40.520
and it would report its
first annual loss since 1997.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.970
Dave Calhoun, a member of Boeing's board,

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:44.550
was tapped as the next CEO,

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.870
and immediately starts to make

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:48.130
sweeping changes within the company.

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.040
The first couple of weeks on the job,

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:54.740
he moved very quickly to get
any embarrassing overhang

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.560
from the last year, just
clean out the cobwebs,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.160
get all the bad news out there right now.

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.840
Trying to be more transparent,

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.520
Calhoun dumped even
more damning documents,

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.751
and holds a conference
call with reporters.

00:19:07.751 --> 00:19:11.260
When boards reach a
conclusion to change a CEO,

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:13.700
they expect change.

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.323
And they recognize the arguments

00:19:15.323 --> 00:19:18.190
that have been presented from
the outside world as legit,

00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:20.391
and they're gonna experience

00:19:20.391 --> 00:19:21.480
a different style of leadership,

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.530
a different way of doin' things.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.600
But it's unclear whether or not Calhoun

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:29.060
will shift Boeing's priority
away from pleasing Wall Street,

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.450
and return the company
to its engineering roots

00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:34.890
and heritage of creating
top flight planes.

00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:36.800
We believe this airplane's safer

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.350
than the safest airplane flying today.

00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:41.290
Every next airplane has to be that way,

00:19:41.290 --> 00:19:42.730
it has to be that way for Boeing,

00:19:42.730 --> 00:19:45.210
it has to be that way for our competitors.

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.450
He's been on the board since mid-2009,

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.790
and also one of the, well,

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:50.960
almost all of the board members

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.730
that do not have an engineering degrees,

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:55.050
from a purely accounting background,

00:19:55.050 --> 00:19:56.970
private equity, hedge
funds, that kind of thing.

00:19:56.970 --> 00:19:58.580
This is a bit strange,
because on one level

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.450
a company really needs to change.

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:03.400
On the other hand, other
than a shareholder emergency,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:04.233
I'm not really sure

00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:06.160
what would be the
instigator of that change.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:09.180
We are gonna have the most open book

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:11.133
the world's ever seen, on this subject.

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.860
Transparency is what we lost for a moment,

00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:16.380
and it's something we have to regain,

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:19.940
because it speaks to the trust
that the world has in us.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.310
I am very hopeful that he can restore

00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:24.600
the safety culture there,

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.080
so that they can focus
on making safe airplanes.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.430
The old days of simply harvesting cash

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:32.140
from legacy programs,

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.400
and returning it to
shareholders, needs to stop,

00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:39.000
and the idea of engineers
being some sort of a commodity

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.770
that you can rely upon
to come through for you,

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:42.164
that needs to stop, too.

00:20:42.164 --> 00:20:45.170
The bigger issue of setting the tone,

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:49.060
changing culture, which,
these things happen gradually,

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.420
bit by bit, he's saying all
the right things right now,

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.600
about correcting course,

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:59.230
but we won't know for awhile as to whether

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:01.113
Boeing's on the right course.
