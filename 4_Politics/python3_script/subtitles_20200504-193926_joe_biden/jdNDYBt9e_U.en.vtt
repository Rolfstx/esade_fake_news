00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.660
This is East Asia—comprised of China, Japan,
Korea, and Taiwan—and this is Europe.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.910
2.4 billion people live in these two areas—a
third of the world’s population.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.869
More impressively, each of these two regions
have a GDP of about $20 trillion.

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.369
Combined, just these countries account for
half of the world’s economic activity.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.090
They are two of the world’s most dense,
most developed, and m ost economically interlinked

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.010
regions and are home to the world’s largest
and most influential cities yet laying between

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.460
them is just one country—Russia.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.150
This more of less means that one country controls
whether Europe can get to Asia and vice versa

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.600
and for a while, they couldn’t.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.550
During the cold war, almost universally, non-soviet
airlines were not allowed to fly over the

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.710
Soviet Union.

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.420
This proved a huge barrier to travel.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.250
In the 1950’s, flying on BOAC, which later
became British Airways, the fastest route

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.650
from London to Tokyo involved leaving London
at 10am on Friday and stopping in Rome, Beirut,

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.010
Bahrain, Karachi, Calcutta, Yangon, Bangkok,
and Manila before finally arriving in Tokyo

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.620
at 6am on a Sunday.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.810
All in all, that was 36 hours and 10,000 miles
of travel to get between two cities 6,000

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.470
miles apart and that was also their fastest
service on the Comet jet plane.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.610
Their slower and cheaper propeller plane service
would leave London on a Sunday and not arrive

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.290
in Tokyo until Thursday after 88 hours of
travel.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.850
It was just hugely inefficient but there was
a better way—over the Arctic.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.390
SAS was the first to develop routes overflying
the Arctic but other airlines soon followed.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.300
These routes were first used to get to the
American west coast faster.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.909
This involved developing new navigation systems
to overcome the issue of traditional magnetic

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.620
compasses not working properly in the high
north.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.229
In the 1950’s no commercial airplane had
the range to fly to the American west coast

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.720
non-stop but with SAS’s new polar route
they would take a relatively quick route from

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.700
Copenhagen stopping in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland
and Winnipeg, Canada before arriving in Los

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.700
Angeles.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.590
This cut what was previously a 36 hour trip
down to 22.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.030
With SAS having proven that commercial flights
over the Arctic were both safe and commercially

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.190
viable, other airlines quickly followed not
only setting up routes to the American west

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.560
coast but also to the far east.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.220
The most direct route from London to Tokyo
flies over Siberia, but since that airspace

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.940
was closed airlines chose another way—the
other way around the world.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.980
In 1960, only 40,000 people lived in Anchorage,
Alaska and Alaska had just became a state

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.069
the year before, but its airport emerged as
a crucial stopping point between Europe and

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:55.069
Asia.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.730
BOAC’s thrice weekly polar route from London
to Tokyo would leave Heathrow at 1:45 pm,

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.599
arrive in Anchorage nine and a half hours
later, stop for an hour to refuel, and then

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.550
fly the remaining seven hours to Tokyo.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:11.930
All in all, it was timetabled to take only
seventeen and a half hours—half of what

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.349
the trip took before.

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.930
It was as drastic a reduction in travel time
as when Concorde cut New York to London flights

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:19.730
from six hours to three.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.860
BOAC wasn’t the only one.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.650
All the major European carriers set up routes
to the far east via Anchorage in the 1960s

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:27.650
and 1970s.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.860
While Anchorage sees only a few dozen daily
commercial flights mostly to the continental

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.920
US today, in the 1970s it was served by Air
France, SAS, KLM, Iberia, Lufthansa, Japan

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.209
Airlines, Korean Air, and more.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.090
This tiny town in Alaska quickly became one
of the most connected and cosmopolitan areas

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.810
of the world with passengers and flight crews
from all around the world stopping over all

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.640
because of where it was.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.170
As aircraft became more advanced with longer
range, there were a few airlines that managed

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.660
to avoid stopping in Anchorage on their way
from Europe to East Asia.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.209
Finnair, for example, starting flying from
Helsinki to Tokyo non-stop in 1983 by flying

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.980
in international airspace north of Russia
over the North Pole.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.500
This made what is today a nine hour flight
thirteen hours but it was still faster than

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.870
stopping in Anchorage.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.239
Overwhelmingly, though, airlines continued
to fly through Anchorage.

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:24.650
Eventually, though, the Soviet Union did of
course fall in 1991 and with that Russia started

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.240
to grant overflight rights to European and
East Asian airlines.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.689
They first had to modernize and anglicize
their air traffic control system.

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.389
All international pilots and air traffic controllers
worldwide speak English but before, since

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.400
there were few international flights over
Russia, the Russian air traffic controllers

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.740
didn’t speak english.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.659
Once the changes were made, airlines quickly
switched to flying non-stop from Europe to

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.560
Asia over Siberia.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.169
That left Anchorage largely deserted.

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.090
The airport built a large and modern international
terminal in 1982 to handle all the traffic

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.849
passing through the airport but then, less
than ten years later, all those airlines that

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:03.860
kept the airport busy left in droves.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.499
Today, that international terminal, built
to handle hundreds of flights per month, only

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:10.569
sees a flight every few days.

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.460
Russia, meanwhile, is prospering thanks to
the opening up of its airspace.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.469
Flying to Asia over Siberia saves airlines
huge amounts of time and money so Russia therefore

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:23.330
charges airlines huge amounts of money to
do so.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.020
Exact numbers vary by airline and are kept
secret, but for each roundtrip flight between

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.590
Europe and Asia, Siberian overflight fees
are believed to account for up to $100 of

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.379
a single passenger’s ticket price.

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:41.080
Russia has an enormous amount of power by
controlling this airspace and they use it

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.650
to their advantage.

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.349
133 countries have signed the International
Civil Aviation Organization’s Transit Agreement

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:51.259
which essentially allows any airline from
any country to fly through the signatory’s

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:56.129
airspace but Russia, however, has not, so
they can pick and choose which country’s

00:05:56.129 --> 00:05:58.030
airlines get to fly through their airspace.

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:03.509
The country can and has used its airspace
as a geopolitical weapon—in 2014 they threatened

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.539
to shut down their airspace to European Union
airlines in response to sanctions, in 2017

00:06:08.539 --> 00:06:12.300
they threatened to close the airspace to Dutch
airlines in response to a reduction in landing

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.189
slots for a Russian airline at Schiphol airport,
and in April 2018 they tacitly threatened

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:21.830
to close their airspace to US airlines in
response to US military action in Syria.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.020
But Russia not only decides which countries
can fly in its airspace, it also decides which

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.889
specific airlines.

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:33.809
There is more or less a rule that only one
airline per European country can overfly Russia.

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:38.120
There are certainly exceptions—both British
Airways and Virgin Atlantic are London based,

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.379
for example, but both overfly Siberia on their
routes to Shanghai and Hong Kong, but Air

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:46.819
France is the only French airline with Siberian
overflight rights, Lufthansa is the only German

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:51.309
airline with overflight rights, Iberia is
the only Spanish airline with overflight rights,

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:53.099
and so on and so forth.

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:55.789
For the longest while, this wasn’t a problem.

00:06:55.789 --> 00:07:00.379
European countries aren’t that big and few
had more than one intercontinental airline

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:02.499
but nowadays, however, that’s changing.

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:06.929
We’re seeing more and more budget airlines
competing with the large, established carriers

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:11.849
on long-haul routes but, with this system
of overflight permissions, the legacy carriers

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:15.309
more or less have a monopoly on east Asian
routes.

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:20.249
SAS, for example, operates out of Norway,
Denmark, and Sweden and they have Siberian

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:24.599
overflight rights that take them to destinations
like Tokyo, Beijing, and Shanghai.

00:07:24.599 --> 00:07:29.889
SAS is therefore the only Scandinavian airline
allowed to overfly Siberia.

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:32.610
But also in Scandinavia is Norwegian Air.

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:37.219
As one of the largest low-cost airlines in
the world, Norwegian has pioneered long-haul

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:42.060
budget flying mainly focusing on flights from
major European cities to the US.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.339
The airline has said, though, that it wants
to expand eastwards.

00:07:45.339 --> 00:07:49.949
They already have flights from Copenhagen,
Oslo, and Stockholm to Bangkok and from London

00:07:49.949 --> 00:07:54.340
to Singapore, but these destinations are far
enough south that they don’t involve flying

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.659
over Siberia.

00:07:55.659 --> 00:08:00.599
The airline has repeatedly applied for Siberian
overflight rights and repeatedly been denied.

00:08:00.599 --> 00:08:05.539
They argue that SAS does not operate any flight
from Norway to Asia so they should be granted

00:08:05.539 --> 00:08:11.300
permission as the only Norwegian airline but,
since SAS is partially registered in Norway,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.449
Russia isn’t granting permission.

00:08:13.449 --> 00:08:18.270
Norwegian does have a subsidiary legally registered
in the UK but its unlikely that Russia would

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.860
grant overflight rights to this since British
Airways and Virgin Atlantic also have overflight

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:23.860
rights.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:28.050
Norwegian airlines also has a subsidiary based
in Ireland which does not have an airline

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:33.020
with Siberian overflight rights but, SAS also
has a subsidiary based in the country which

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.870
could mean that Russia will deny rights to
this subsidiary too.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.690
As of now, Russia has not granted overflight
permission to any budget airline.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.250
Others have tried—Icelandic airlines Wow
Air and Icelandair have attempted to negotiate

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:50.830
overflight rights—but Russia views overflights
as a way to make money and wants to charge

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.670
fees that would make it impossible for a low-cost
airline.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:59.230
For now, Wow Air has planned to start flights
from Reykjavik to Delhi, India which, in a

00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:03.990
direct routing would fly over Russia but can
route around Russia by only adding 45 minutes

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:09.050
in extra flight time if an arrangement isn’t
made before flights start in December 2018.

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:13.600
Russia is a powerful politically-savvy country
that knows that these overflight rights are

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.480
a huge negotiation tool.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.520
Pulling the rights of a country’s airline
would be a huge financial blow and granting

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.940
rights is also a huge advantage.

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:26.800
Competition, though, is good for the consumer
and this current system stifles it.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.350
Until Russia starts granting overflight rights
to budget airlines, nonstop flights to Asia

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.090
will stay expensive.

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:37.470
The fact that this shortcut over Siberia is
now open at all, however, saves millions of

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:42.270
passengers yearly enormous amounts of time
and money.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.750
Watching this ten-minute video of our technological
progress might make you think that we got

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.440
here in one giant leap, but that, of course,
is not the case.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:53.830
We had to develop new navigation systems to
work around old-school compasses, build airports

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.700
to help planes refuel, and extend the range
of aircraft.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:00.700
The problem of advancing enough to be able
to fly non-stop to the other side of the world

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:04.730
was huge but it was broken down and approached
in small steps.

00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:09.120
Brilliant works in a similar way—breaking
a problem down, identifying the relevant concepts,

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:12.640
thinking clearly through each part, and building
it back up to the conclusion.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:17.490
In this manner, super complex topics like
number theory or calculus can be easily understood

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:18.530
by anyone.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:22.440
My favorite from Brilliant is their logic
course, which starts simple, but then builds

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.370
up your skills so you can solve seemingly
impossible problems.
