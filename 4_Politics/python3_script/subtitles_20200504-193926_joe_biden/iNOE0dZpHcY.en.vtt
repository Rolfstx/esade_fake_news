00:00:26.724 --> 00:00:28.901
I'd like to tell you a story.

00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:30.577
It's about a little boy

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.339
who grew up in Sweden, 
in the '60s and '70s.

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:39.551
His dad was this tall,
good-looking army officer.

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:43.416
His mom was this pretty but shy linguist.

00:00:43.971 --> 00:00:48.967
He had a brother and two sisters,
and they lived in suburb of Stockholm.

00:00:51.085 --> 00:00:53.263
And that little boy was me.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:00.299
I think I remember
the first time my dad hit me.

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:04.156
I was around three or four, I think.

00:01:04.656 --> 00:01:07.007
I was walking in front of the TV
and he kicked me,

00:01:07.007 --> 00:01:09.208
and I flew into some bookshelves.

00:01:09.588 --> 00:01:13.346
And I remember there was blood
and my mom was screaming.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.198
You see, my dad had a lot of problems
and he took it out on me and my mom.

00:01:18.198 --> 00:01:21.499
He never touched my brothers or sisters.

00:01:21.926 --> 00:01:24.148
And this started
when I was about three or four

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:28.030
and went on till I was about 11 or 12.

00:01:28.566 --> 00:01:30.296
It was a really hard part of my life

00:01:30.296 --> 00:01:34.725
because I had to go to school
with a black eye or, you know,

00:01:34.725 --> 00:01:38.435
some of my hair was missing
because he'd been yanking my head.

00:01:39.638 --> 00:01:42.952
I think some of you may know
what I'm talking about.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.414
I understand how you're feeling.

00:01:47.937 --> 00:01:49.777
You see, when you get abused at home,

00:01:49.777 --> 00:01:53.379
you have two choices, 
just like and animal: fight or flight.

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:54.788
You can either run away,

00:01:54.788 --> 00:01:59.721
which was impossible for me
because I was a little kid living at home;

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.551
or you can fight back,

00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:04.517
which I couldn't do because,
you know, I was just a little kid.

00:02:04.517 --> 00:02:06.506
My dad was my size.

00:02:08.914 --> 00:02:11.481
But I learned later 
there's a third choice:

00:02:12.958 --> 00:02:14.544
you freeze.

00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:18.243
It's like a gazelle being taken by a lion.

00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:23.722
You just freeze and go dead;
all your emotions are bottled up inside.

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.342
I would just [lie] there.

00:02:26.342 --> 00:02:29.294
When he was hitting me,
I wouldn't even cry.

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:35.129
And, by the time I was 11 or 12,
I was smoking, I was drinking,

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.373
I was running away from home
on stolen motorcycles,

00:02:38.373 --> 00:02:40.782
sleeping over in someone's garage,

00:02:41.252 --> 00:02:43.587
but my dad always found me.

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:47.119
Back home for another beating.

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:49.372
So, my grades at school were terrible,

00:02:49.372 --> 00:02:51.582
and my dad said, 
"I've got to do something.

00:02:51.582 --> 00:02:54.658
I've got get rid of this kid somehow
and get him out of here."

00:02:54.658 --> 00:02:58.399
So, he decided to send me up north,
to his parents', my grandparents'.

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.405
And they lived in a small town
in the northern part of Sweden.

00:03:01.405 --> 00:03:05.255
Now, Sweden is a country pretty far north.

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:09.582
I mean, Stockholm in the winter
gets dark at 2:30 p.m..

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:15.376
Stockholm was like Miami Beach,
compared to the place I was being sent.

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:18.670
But my grandparents were quite nice to me,

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.225
and they took care of me
and my grades got better.

00:03:22.542 --> 00:03:26.443
I discovered ice hockey,
and then weight training, and karate,

00:03:26.443 --> 00:03:28.435
and I started to heal.

00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:34.786
And, by the time I was about 17 or 18,
I remembered something my dad had told me.

00:03:34.786 --> 00:03:37.209
Because, you know,
my dad was this pretty smart guy,

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.919
he was very charming, he was a nice guy -

00:03:40.284 --> 00:03:44.166
most of the time,
when he wasn't going nuts.

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:46.455
And he told me, "Listen -

00:03:46.455 --> 00:03:51.033
Listen, kid, this socialistic country,
forget it, you can't do anything here.

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:53.970
If you want to be somebody,
you've got to go to America."

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.228
I always remembered that.

00:03:55.228 --> 00:03:59.185
So, I kind of got all the scholarships
I could because I didn't have any money.

00:03:59.185 --> 00:04:02.795
I got a scholarship to WSU,
Washington State University;

00:04:02.795 --> 00:04:03.978
another one to Clemson.

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:06.873
Finally, I got a
Fulbright sholarship to MIT,

00:04:06.873 --> 00:04:08.993
which is the reason I am standing here.

00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:10.936
And there was just one little snag -

00:04:10.936 --> 00:04:15.027
because, my forth year
to my last year as a master's,

00:04:15.027 --> 00:04:18.220
I was in Sydney,
at the University of Sydney,

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.328
and I was studying engineering
on a scholarship,

00:04:21.328 --> 00:04:24.678
and I was working extra as a bouncer

00:04:24.678 --> 00:04:27.196
because, you know,
that trauma is really helpful

00:04:27.196 --> 00:04:29.459
when you get into a ring with somebody.

00:04:29.459 --> 00:04:31.469
So, I became a pretty good fighter.

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:35.749
I was a karate champion and I had
what you call a "killer instinct."

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.348
So, me and my buddy
who was my sparring partner

00:04:38.348 --> 00:04:42.499
got hired to do some special work
at a rock concert, different artists,

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:46.517
and one of them was
this beautiful black singer,

00:04:46.517 --> 00:04:49.864
a statuesque lady named Grace Jones.

00:04:49.864 --> 00:04:51.479
We worked there and, afterwards,

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.309
she hired some of us to do
especial security at her party

00:04:55.309 --> 00:04:59.179
when she was going to go out
and hang out at the nightclubs in Sydney.

00:04:59.179 --> 00:05:04.152
I didn't really realize right away why
she'd picked this tall, blond, buff guy

00:05:04.152 --> 00:05:06.151
to be her special security.

00:05:06.151 --> 00:05:09.470
But, you know, I found out
later that evening.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.523
(Laughter)

00:05:11.523 --> 00:05:13.291
I, uh -

00:05:13.291 --> 00:05:15.232
(Laughter)

00:05:15.232 --> 00:05:17.490
I ended up in a hotel room,

00:05:17.893 --> 00:05:21.451
missed a few classes
the next day, college -

00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:24.562
And, you know, 
she was a world-class artist,

00:05:24.562 --> 00:05:25.991
totally out of my league.

00:05:25.991 --> 00:05:28.532
That's what I thought,
but she didn't agree, you know.

00:05:28.532 --> 00:05:30.900
So, we ended up having this relationship.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.669
I went to Tokyo to do some karate,
she was there doing a commercial.

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:36.767
Then I ended up moving to New York.

00:05:36.767 --> 00:05:40.288
So, I had a couple of months
before I was going to start at MIT,

00:05:40.288 --> 00:05:43.729
and those months literally changed my life
because my what happened was -

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.292
This was New York city, Studio 54 -

00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:50.052
I met David Bowie, Michael Jackson.

00:05:50.052 --> 00:05:52.156
First week I was there,
I went to some party.

00:05:52.156 --> 00:05:54.033
There was a little guy with white hair.

00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:57.310
He came up to me and said,
"Hi! What are you famous for?"

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.424
He took a picture of me and I'm like,
"Nothing, as far as I know."

00:06:00.424 --> 00:06:02.913
And he goes, "Hey, I want
to put you on my magazine."

00:06:02.913 --> 00:06:05.414
Well, that was Andy Worhol,
Interview Magazine.

00:06:05.414 --> 00:06:11.345
So, finally, when it was time to go back
to school, to Cambridge, MIT,

00:06:12.065 --> 00:06:15.777
chemical engineering just didn't seem
as exciting, somehow.

00:06:15.777 --> 00:06:17.256
(Laughter)

00:06:17.256 --> 00:06:18.825
So -

00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:23.287
But, anyway, I picked this big black
motorcycle I had bought, 1200CC,

00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:27.010
threw Grace on the back,
all decked out in leather.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.285
I got in my leather pants,

00:06:28.285 --> 00:06:30.427
I didn't wear a shirt
too often in those days.

00:06:30.427 --> 00:06:32.742
I drove up to Cambridge,

00:06:32.742 --> 00:06:36.786
and I think the professors at MIT
had a slightly different idea

00:06:36.786 --> 00:06:39.379
of who this Swedish star student was -

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:40.747
(Laughter)

00:06:40.747 --> 00:06:44.805
So, when this thing just - "vroom" -
went past a window,

00:06:44.805 --> 00:06:47.011
I think they were
sort of shocked, you know.

00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:49.176
They expected somebody else,
slightly smaller,

00:06:49.176 --> 00:06:51.522
maybe with some Coke-bottle
glasses or something,

00:06:51.522 --> 00:06:57.268
but, anyway, they were as shocked
as I was not belonging there.

00:06:57.268 --> 00:07:00.595
I felt that right away,
and three weeks later I was gone.

00:07:00.595 --> 00:07:02.951
I went back to New York,

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:06.069
got an agent - so all other actors -

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:08.746
started studying, acting,
got up for a couple of movies.

00:07:08.746 --> 00:07:10.618
One was a "boxing" movie.

00:07:10.618 --> 00:07:15.259
It turned out to be Rocky IV,
and I auditioned for it.

00:07:15.259 --> 00:07:17.367
Finally, I got the role, moved out here.

00:07:17.367 --> 00:07:22.361
I was training with Sly Stallone
down here, about a mile away from here.

00:07:22.951 --> 00:07:28.010
And the film was shot and opened
30 years ago, Memorial Day.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.758
And I came out of the theater with Grace
and people were taking pictures of me,

00:07:31.758 --> 00:07:35.566
and I'm like, "What happened?
Oh, I guess I'm a movie star. OK, great."

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:39.981
But, you know, the problem was this:
my troubles had only started,

00:07:39.981 --> 00:07:42.539
because what happened
was that frozen part of me -

00:07:42.539 --> 00:07:43.838
remember that I told you? -

00:07:43.838 --> 00:07:46.438
started coming out
and kind of running my life.

00:07:46.438 --> 00:07:49.070
Because what happens is this:
when you have this trauma,

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:51.947
it's like a soldier
with post-traumatic stress.

00:07:51.947 --> 00:07:55.721
You end up acting on something
called escape behavior.

00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:58.266
You try to escape from something
you can't escape from

00:07:58.266 --> 00:08:00.057
because it's inside of you:

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:07.454
drinking, sexual affairs,
overeating, violence, you name it.

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:10.870
I did a lot of bad things to myself,

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.804
and, 25 years later, 40 movies later,

00:08:13.804 --> 00:08:17.013
yeah, I was a movie star,
but I was miserable most of the time.

00:08:17.505 --> 00:08:18.876
I had a failed marriage,

00:08:18.876 --> 00:08:22.299
two daughters who I loved,
but they didn't even know me.

00:08:22.757 --> 00:08:25.383
My career was kind of rock-bottom.

00:08:25.383 --> 00:08:27.337
This was only five years ago,

00:08:27.337 --> 00:08:29.608
and I didn't know how to get out of it.

00:08:30.457 --> 00:08:32.258
Two things happened.

00:08:32.258 --> 00:08:34.675
I got a call from
my old buddy Sly Stallone,

00:08:34.675 --> 00:08:36.587
"Hey, Dolph, how are you doing?"

00:08:36.587 --> 00:08:38.546
(Laughter)

00:08:38.546 --> 00:08:41.427
"I've got this script, so check it out,
see what you think."

00:08:41.427 --> 00:08:44.457
Well, the script was called
The Expendables.

00:08:44.457 --> 00:08:48.157
It was a big hit, I was back
in the big screen after 15 years.

00:08:48.727 --> 00:08:51.676
The other thing is I met this girl,
fell in love with her,

00:08:52.346 --> 00:08:55.167
and I knew I was going to embark
on the same stupid path

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:56.917
I'd been down before.

00:08:56.917 --> 00:08:58.318
Actually, something happened.

00:08:58.318 --> 00:09:00.849
Some girl was flirting with me,
I gave her my number -

00:09:00.849 --> 00:09:03.898
The usual: the text,
the pictures; she saw it -

00:09:03.898 --> 00:09:05.497
A few of you may have been there.

00:09:05.497 --> 00:09:07.538
She went nuts, we were about to break up,

00:09:07.538 --> 00:09:11.229
and I said, "I can't do this.
I've got to change my life somehow."

00:09:11.229 --> 00:09:13.595
She'd told me before,
"Why don't you try therapy?"

00:09:13.595 --> 00:09:15.838
I was like, "Forget about it.
It's for sissies."

00:09:15.838 --> 00:09:17.577
"What about meditation?"

00:09:17.577 --> 00:09:20.109
"Ah, do I look like an Indian guru?
I don't think so."

00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:21.128
(Laughter)

00:09:21.128 --> 00:09:22.969
So, to make a long story short,

00:09:22.969 --> 00:09:26.450
I took up therapy
three years ago, meditation,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:29.026
and it totally changed my life.

00:09:29.639 --> 00:09:33.229
Suddenly, this fog
that I was living in lifted.

00:09:33.229 --> 00:09:35.717
I did the therapy
where you go back in time,

00:09:35.717 --> 00:09:40.732
you relive your experiences, you cry,
scream, you roll up in a little ball,

00:09:40.732 --> 00:09:43.440
you hit the couch
with a baseball bat, you know,

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.496
anything you've got to do
to start to attack this part of you,

00:09:47.496 --> 00:09:50.183
this frozen part of me
that was running my life.

00:09:50.183 --> 00:09:52.756
And slowly it started to become
smaller and smaller,

00:09:52.756 --> 00:09:55.389
and I could sort of see my life
come back to me.

00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:57.389
And the meditation helped as well.

00:09:57.389 --> 00:10:00.260
So, the first thing I did:

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.379
I went back to see my kids,

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:05.820
and I asked them for forgiveness
for what I had done

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:09.110
because I told them
what happened with my dad,

00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:11.251
and I was a guy who
didn't like what I'd done,

00:10:11.251 --> 00:10:12.940
and they started crying right away.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.111
And I realized they had had a lot of pain,
and I cried with them.

00:10:16.981 --> 00:10:19.280
I did the same with my ex-wife,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.434
and a few other people I had hurt.

00:10:21.749 --> 00:10:26.302
And, as a matter of fact,
I also, in my head, forgave my dad

00:10:26.302 --> 00:10:27.800
for what he did,

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.602
and my mom, for what she didn't do.

00:10:29.602 --> 00:10:31.574
And I started embarking on this new life.

00:10:31.574 --> 00:10:34.782
It was like a fight worth fighting,
to come to terms with yourself,

00:10:34.782 --> 00:10:36.782
to heal yourself.

00:10:36.782 --> 00:10:39.792
But what I didn't realize
was there's another level to that,

00:10:39.792 --> 00:10:42.472
because, once you start
healing yourself and feel better,

00:10:42.472 --> 00:10:46.235
you see other people around you
who need help, who have pain.

00:10:46.235 --> 00:10:47.841
And faith kind of came to me,

00:10:47.841 --> 00:10:52.183
and I wrote and produce a movie
about human trafficking,

00:10:52.183 --> 00:10:53.513
called Skin Trade.

00:10:53.513 --> 00:10:57.694
And I learned about human trafficking,
which is a terrible crime.

00:10:57.694 --> 00:11:00.725
There are 20 million slaves
in the world today.

00:11:00.725 --> 00:11:05.213
It's a 20-billion-dollar industry,
second largest in the world.

00:11:05.213 --> 00:11:09.865
These people are physically humiliated,
psychologically abused.

00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:13.494
They have no self worth,
sort of like how I used to feel.

00:11:13.494 --> 00:11:16.316
And kind of faith brought me
in contact with this,

00:11:16.316 --> 00:11:18.802
with human trafficking and these victims.

00:11:18.802 --> 00:11:22.757
When I came back to LA,
I called an organization called CAST,

00:11:22.757 --> 00:11:24.676
and asked them if I could help -

00:11:24.676 --> 00:11:28.155
Coalition to Abolish
Slavery and Trafficking.

00:11:28.155 --> 00:11:30.343
Well, I've been helping them ever since,

00:11:30.343 --> 00:11:34.117
and it's a great feeling for me
to finally give something back.

00:11:34.117 --> 00:11:36.086
You know, a lot of this human trafficking

00:11:36.086 --> 00:11:39.627
isn't just happening in, like, India,
and Africa, and over there.

00:11:39.627 --> 00:11:42.513
As a matter of fact,
one of the most interesting cases

00:11:42.513 --> 00:11:45.956
was a girl that was brought over
from a Third World country

00:11:45.956 --> 00:11:48.035
by a very wealthy family.

00:11:48.035 --> 00:11:50.693
She was kept in a house,
they took her passport,

00:11:50.693 --> 00:11:53.566
kept on the guard all the time,
threatened her with violence,

00:11:53.566 --> 00:11:54.937
threatened her family.

00:11:54.937 --> 00:11:57.236
You know where the house was?

00:11:57.856 --> 00:12:00.667
In Brentwood, right here,

00:12:00.667 --> 00:12:02.538
about a mile from here.

00:12:02.538 --> 00:12:05.097
And she didn't know what to do.

00:12:05.097 --> 00:12:08.241
They brought this American nanny in
to take care of the little kid,

00:12:08.241 --> 00:12:11.067
and they talked, and the American
nanny said she'd help her,

00:12:11.067 --> 00:12:15.158
but nothing happened,
a week passed, a month passed -

00:12:15.158 --> 00:12:17.968
Finally, they were coming back
from the park one day.

00:12:17.968 --> 00:12:21.518
She was taking care of this kid,
and there was this security guy as usual,

00:12:23.158 --> 00:12:27.618
and there were 15 FBI agents
outside of the house.

00:12:28.338 --> 00:12:29.868
They took her inside and said,

00:12:29.868 --> 00:12:32.279
"Do you want to stay
or do you want to leave?"

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:33.970
She said, "I want to leave."

00:12:34.529 --> 00:12:38.758
CAST got her into a shelter,
re-educated her, brought her back.

00:12:39.478 --> 00:12:41.370
She learned a job.

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.368
She finally ended up 
getting a green card.

00:12:44.719 --> 00:12:46.448
As a matter of fact,

00:12:46.448 --> 00:12:50.262
she met this man from her home country,
that she fell in love with,

00:12:50.262 --> 00:12:52.844
and they got married.

00:12:53.592 --> 00:12:58.131
And to be part of something
like that is just amazing.

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:04.140
As a matter of fact, Alice is also
pregnant with her new baby,

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:08.352
and towards the end of my talk,
I wanted to say hi to Alice.

00:13:08.352 --> 00:13:09.854
Please stand up.

00:13:10.229 --> 00:13:12.820
(Applause)

00:13:18.244 --> 00:13:19.759
Anyway,

00:13:20.105 --> 00:13:24.365
I guess, for me, the experience
that I told you about is -

00:13:25.235 --> 00:13:27.810
like, you have to come
to terms with yourself.

00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:32.303
You have to love yourself so you can
appreciate those things in others.

00:13:32.684 --> 00:13:35.238
If you heal yourself, you can heal others.

00:13:35.944 --> 00:13:37.266
And -

00:13:37.817 --> 00:13:42.150
I think if you take time
to look inside and find that little boy,

00:13:43.307 --> 00:13:45.644
that little girl, inside yourself -

00:13:46.986 --> 00:13:50.147
then, you treat them well -

00:13:50.147 --> 00:13:52.187
and are you ready to look

00:13:52.187 --> 00:13:55.678
and see a little boy or a little girl next
to you that may need some help?

00:13:56.237 --> 00:13:58.093
Because, if you do that,

00:13:58.566 --> 00:14:00.290
it's just

00:14:02.171 --> 00:14:04.200
the greatest feeling in the world.

00:14:04.911 --> 00:14:06.136
Thanks.

00:14:06.136 --> 00:14:08.437
(Applause)

00:14:19.308 --> 00:14:20.568
Thank you.

00:14:20.568 --> 00:14:22.383
(Applause)
