00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.635
Edward Snowden, uh,
welcome to the show.

00:00:02.668 --> 00:00:04.837
-Good to be home. -Let's jump
straight into the book,

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.740
because I don't know how long
you have in that secret hideout

00:00:07.773 --> 00:00:09.475
where you're doing
this interview from.

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:10.743
-Um...
-(laughs)

00:00:10.776 --> 00:00:12.378
It's just my apartment
in Moscow.

00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:13.713
-Oh, okay.
-(laughter)

00:00:13.746 --> 00:00:14.947
Well, don't tell us
where it is.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.549
I mean, I don't want to...
I don't...

00:00:16.582 --> 00:00:18.484
Don't pull a Trump here, dude.
Come on.

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:21.187
Um, some people call you
a patriot, right?

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.456
Others believe that-that...
that you're a traitor.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.092
Do you think this book will
change peoples' perceptions,

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.562
and what do you see yourself as?

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:32.432
Well, when I-I-I...
I set out to write this book,

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.534
I wasn't trying
to change opinions.

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:36.903
I was just trying to, uh,

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:39.338
tell the story
of what has happened.

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:42.408
Um, and when I'm looking at,

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:44.677
like, the change of technology
and everything like that,

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.313
the only way you can get people
to pay attention to something

00:00:47.346 --> 00:00:49.682
that has been in expert
conversation for so long,

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:52.718
that's so complex, uh, is
to give them characters, right?

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.720
Um, so, yeah,
it's the story of my life,

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:55.988
but it's actually about more.

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:57.190
It's a dual history

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.791
of the change of technology
and the change

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:01.194
of the intelligence community
over time.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.563
When people ask me
if I'm a hero or a traitor,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.432
uh, I say, "Look,
I'm-I'm just an ordinary person.

00:01:06.465 --> 00:01:07.767
I'm like you."

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.069
Whistleblowers
aren't, uh, like...

00:01:10.102 --> 00:01:12.171
You know, we-we... we aren't...

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:14.173
um... elected.

00:01:14.206 --> 00:01:16.576
We're not, uh,
exceptionally skilled.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:20.346
Uh, the-the thing that-that...
that puts us in place,

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.181
the thing that makes, um,

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:23.916
the disclosure matter
are-are the facts.

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:26.385
It's really about what you see,
rather than what you are.

00:01:26.418 --> 00:01:27.587
-So...
-Right.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.855
We're kind of elected
by circumstance.

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.990
Right, and one of... one
of the things you talk about

00:01:31.023 --> 00:01:32.925
in the book-- in fact,
the first line of the book--

00:01:32.958 --> 00:01:35.928
is you say, "I used to work
for the government.

00:01:35.961 --> 00:01:37.396
Now I work for the public."

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.199
What does that mean?

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:42.735
Well, I didn't realize
there was a difference.

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:45.037
Um, I-I grew up
in a federal family.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.672
My-my father worked
for the government,

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:48.207
my mother worked
for the government,

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.810
uh, in the-the courts
after she worked for the NSA.

00:01:50.843 --> 00:01:52.678
She actually still works
for the courts,

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.680
uh, and they-they, uh...

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.315
The government just sued me

00:01:56.348 --> 00:01:58.518
-on the day this book
hit the shelves. -Right.

00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:01.220
Uh, so you could say
it was... "born a crime."

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:03.489
-Um...
-(laughter)

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:04.757
TouchÃ©.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.792
-(laughter)
-But, uh...

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:10.096
(laughs) Yeah,
the-the nice thing about that,

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.566
um, is the-the book was, uh,
not getting that much attention.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.735
It was, like, uh,
25 on the charts.

00:02:15.768 --> 00:02:17.103
And then, the government said,

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:18.871
"You know, we don't want you
to read this book."

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:21.541
Uh, they said, "God, sue Snowden
as fast as you can.

00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:23.876
Do anything you can.
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!"

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.679
And, uh, now we're number one
basically everywhere.

00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:28.214
So you can say
the attorney general is

00:02:28.247 --> 00:02:30.216
the best hype man
that I've ever had.

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.185
(applause)

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:34.687
The... the attorney general
has come out and said

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.323
that, like, you were supposed
to pass this book for review.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.592
So as somebody who's worked
in-in, um...

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:40.826
you know, in the defense space,

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:42.428
as somebody who worked
with government secrets,

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:44.230
you were meant
to submit this book to them.

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:46.199
And they are saying
they would have passed it

00:02:46.232 --> 00:02:47.633
if you just followed the rules.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:49.001
Why didn't you follow the rules?

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:51.137
-(Snowden laughs)
-(laughter)

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.707
Okay, well, first off,
I am a noted rule follower.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.076
-Um...
-(laughter)

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.712
but, uh, while... while
they are technically right,

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:01.414
uh, there's no oath of secrecy.

00:03:01.447 --> 00:03:03.816
A lot of people think
there's an oath of secrecy.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.385
There's an oath of service,
which is not to the Agency,

00:03:06.418 --> 00:03:08.554
it's not to the government--
it's to support and defend

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:10.556
the Constitution
of the United States

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:12.558
against all enemies
foreign and domestic.

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:14.060
But there is
a secrecy agreement,

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.661
and that's
what he's talking about.

00:03:15.694 --> 00:03:18.164
It's called Standard Form 312,
and it basically says:

00:03:18.197 --> 00:03:22.134
No, after I know all the secrets
and I know where the aliens are,

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:25.438
um, I'm not gonna tell anybody
about it.

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.807
Uh, however...

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.744
if the thing that you see, uh,
in your secrecy agreement

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:34.447
conflicts
with that oath of service,

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.316
if the thing that you see
is that the government itself--

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.884
the Agency itself--

00:03:38.917 --> 00:03:41.220
is actually violating
that Constitution,

00:03:41.253 --> 00:03:43.456
well, now you're
kind of screwed.

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.725
And then if you try
to explain what happened,

00:03:45.758 --> 00:03:48.127
and if you write a book
about how it happened

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.329
and-and how we get out of it,

00:03:50.362 --> 00:03:54.100
and then you're supposed
to send that book to the CIA

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:57.903
and let the CIA kind of edit
your life story,

00:03:57.936 --> 00:03:59.939
would you do that?

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:01.340
I would not.

00:04:01.373 --> 00:04:03.776
-I can safely say I would not.
-Me, neither.

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:05.811
Right. Uh, where do people go...

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:08.080
so then where do we go
from here?

00:04:08.113 --> 00:04:11.684
I mean, you-you became infamous
for spilling the secrets.

00:04:11.717 --> 00:04:13.653
You know, people now know
about mass surveillance.

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:15.521
But now we live
in a world where,

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.690
as you talk about in the book,
you know,

00:04:17.723 --> 00:04:19.659
surveillance has
so many levels to it.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:22.495
You have... institutions
that are surveilling us.

00:04:22.528 --> 00:04:24.864
We have private companies,
as you know, surveilling us.

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:28.801
You see breaches from everyone,
you know, Equifax to Facebook.

00:04:28.834 --> 00:04:32.638
What can people do to protect
themselves and their data?

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:36.008
Or is this something
that we should just give up?

00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:38.744
Well, so this is, you know,
a lot of people ask me this,

00:04:38.777 --> 00:04:40.913
and they want, like,
sort of the Edward Snowden

00:04:40.946 --> 00:04:44.317
operation security guide for,
like, how I would use a phone

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.918
or how I avoid surveillance,

00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:48.921
but, guys, uh,
you don't want to live like me.

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:51.724
Um, you don't want to have
ordinary people

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:53.526
fighting an arms race

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:55.961
against the most well resourced
intelligence services

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:57.330
on the planet.

00:04:57.363 --> 00:05:00.232
You don't want ordinary people
trying to out-engineer

00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:02.735
these technology companies
that are basically earning

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:05.104
more money than anybody else
on the planet.

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:07.740
Um, that's not reasonable.
It doesn't make sense.

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:10.476
And then when we look
at what's happening in Congress,

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.912
Congress is like, "You know,
oh, we'll pass some law."

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:14.347
By the way, the United States

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.615
is one of the only
advanced democracies

00:05:16.648 --> 00:05:19.485
on the planet that doesn't have
a basic privacy law.

00:05:19.518 --> 00:05:21.554
Right? Everybody's like,
"Oh, we've got a privacy law,

00:05:21.587 --> 00:05:22.755
the Fourth Amendment."

00:05:22.788 --> 00:05:24.523
Fourth Amendment's
obviously very dear to me.

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:25.791
That's what I stood up

00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:28.027
and really burned my life
to the ground over.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.462
But the Fourth Amendment
only restricts

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:30.996
the operations
of the federal government,

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.398
the state government.

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:35.768
It doesn't do squat for you
against Google and Facebook.

00:05:35.801 --> 00:05:38.204
So they say
"data protection laws," right?

00:05:38.237 --> 00:05:40.206
And we've had advances
since 2013--

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.041
more communications
are encrypted;

00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:43.743
now you've got
encrypted messengers.

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.978
We've got lots of ways
to be safe-er, right?

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:48.881
But then when we talk about
what all these guys are doing

00:05:48.914 --> 00:05:51.617
and how they're monitoring
all of us, um...

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.220
they say,
"Well, data protection laws."

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:56.922
But the problem
with data protection laws

00:05:56.955 --> 00:06:00.760
is that it presumes
the data collection was okay.

00:06:00.793 --> 00:06:03.062
And that's the problem.

00:06:03.095 --> 00:06:05.464
Um, as you might have realized,

00:06:05.497 --> 00:06:07.967
I was flipping through
your memoir before this,

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.736
because that's
kind of what spies do,

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:12.304
-(laughter)
-um, and, uh,

00:06:12.337 --> 00:06:14.006
you wrote...

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.508
you wrote
actually really movingly

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:18.043
about something that struck me,
and it was kind of similar

00:06:18.076 --> 00:06:19.945
to one of the chapters
in my book.

00:06:19.978 --> 00:06:22.181
Mine was called "The Boy,"
and it's about

00:06:22.214 --> 00:06:25.651
how I am, um, uh,
in my final position,

00:06:25.684 --> 00:06:28.087
working directly with the tools
of mass surveillance,

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.722
I can see anybody's e-mails,

00:06:29.755 --> 00:06:31.557
I can see what you're texting
back and forth.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.026
You know, the guys that are
working left and right of me

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:36.595
are turning their monitor
to show me nudes

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:38.731
of the wife of one
of their targets,

00:06:38.764 --> 00:06:42.535
and, uh, they say, "Bonus."

00:06:42.568 --> 00:06:46.372
Um... But then I see,

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:50.276
uh, this picture--
it was actually a video--

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:54.146
of a child in the lap
of his father.

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:56.215
A-And the, you know,
it's like a toddler,

00:06:56.248 --> 00:06:58.250
they're smacking
on the keyboard.

00:06:58.283 --> 00:06:59.985
Um, and they don't realize
what's going on,

00:07:00.018 --> 00:07:01.454
but he kind of glanced
at the camera,

00:07:01.487 --> 00:07:02.888
and I felt
like he was looking at me.

00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:04.290
And this really shook me

00:07:04.323 --> 00:07:05.791
because when we talk
about surveillance,

00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:08.060
we're talking so much
about an abstraction,

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:10.296
-we're talking about things
that don't feel real. -Right.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:13.899
And when I was looking at yours,
you mentioned, um,

00:07:13.932 --> 00:07:16.168
buying a camera at some point.

00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:17.903
There were so many times,
you know,

00:07:17.936 --> 00:07:20.105
you get an electric razor,
it doesn't really bother you.

00:07:20.138 --> 00:07:22.875
It doesn't strike you
as anything criminal.

00:07:22.908 --> 00:07:24.376
-Right, but the camera
has something -But then...

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:26.345
inside of it that contains
peoples' memories

00:07:26.378 --> 00:07:28.747
-and their lives.
-Right.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.650
You realized
that it wasn't a thing

00:07:31.683 --> 00:07:34.553
that had been stolen,
it-it was a memory.

00:07:34.586 --> 00:07:36.555
And that was in the context
of one person.

00:07:36.588 --> 00:07:38.424
I realized that the machine--

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:40.893
I was a technologist
in the NSA--

00:07:40.926 --> 00:07:42.695
all of the different parts
that I'd been working with,

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:46.131
all of the systems,
they had stolen

00:07:46.164 --> 00:07:49.101
and were stealing, not just
one person's memories,

00:07:49.134 --> 00:07:52.805
they were stealing everyone's,
everywhere, all the time,

00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:56.542
and they still are right now.

00:07:56.575 --> 00:07:59.378
A-And so I got up out
of the chair and, you know,

00:07:59.411 --> 00:08:01.213
I didn't try to burn down
the NSA.

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:04.149
I didn't-- I've published
zero documents.

00:08:04.182 --> 00:08:06.585
I-I gave them to journalists,
and there's a long,

00:08:06.618 --> 00:08:08.354
complicated thing in the book
about how and why

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:10.055
and where the lines are.

00:08:10.088 --> 00:08:13.025
Um, but I wanted not to say,

00:08:13.058 --> 00:08:14.994
"This is the way
the world should be."

00:08:15.027 --> 00:08:16.996
I wanted to give it to you.

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:19.932
I-I wanted to say,
"This is what's happening."

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:23.736
And really, guys,
the question for you is,

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.938
"How do you want to live?"

00:08:25.971 --> 00:08:28.173
We are, today, being used
against the future.

00:08:28.206 --> 00:08:29.575
We're being used against
our children.

00:08:29.608 --> 00:08:32.578
Everything we do now
lasts forever.

00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:34.947
Not because
we want to remember it,

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.516
but because we're no longer
allowed to forget.

00:08:37.549 --> 00:08:39.385
So then when people
read this book,

00:08:39.418 --> 00:08:41.654
and people read through
the life of Edward Snowden,

00:08:41.687 --> 00:08:43.322
and-and what you had to do--

00:08:43.355 --> 00:08:46.725
as you say, burn down your life
to expose these secrets.

00:08:46.758 --> 00:08:49.695
Some might say, "Well, Edward,
why don't you come back

00:08:49.728 --> 00:08:51.964
"to the U.S.
and then just fight,

00:08:51.997 --> 00:08:54.700
you know, the legal system,
and prove your case?"

00:08:54.733 --> 00:08:57.136
You know,
and you've said previously

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:58.871
you can't do that because
some of the information

00:08:58.904 --> 00:09:00.639
you need to fight your case
is something

00:09:00.672 --> 00:09:03.008
that they would not allow you
to use in court.

00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:06.011
But you-you are at a point now
where people know the name.

00:09:06.044 --> 00:09:07.880
You know, the book
is gonna be out now.

00:09:07.913 --> 00:09:09.748
Do you think you would take
your chances coming back

00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:11.517
to the U.S.
and hope that one juror

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.985
would see your point of view?

00:09:13.018 --> 00:09:15.020
Or are you just living
in Russia now forever?

00:09:15.053 --> 00:09:16.822
Is that your life?

00:09:16.855 --> 00:09:18.424
No. This is, this is
a great question.

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:20.426
My-My ultimate goal
will always be

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.194
to return back
to the United States.

00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:24.830
And I've told the government,
actually, from year one,

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:26.999
that I only had one condition
for returning,

00:09:27.032 --> 00:09:28.901
and that's that I could get
a fair trial.

00:09:28.934 --> 00:09:30.803
Now, people go, "Oh, well,
what's a fair trial?

00:09:30.836 --> 00:09:33.138
What does that mean?"
Um, and I-I think

00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:35.174
that's actually not
that hard of question.

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:38.077
There are two questions
that come up in this case.

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:40.846
Um, one: Was the law broken?

00:09:40.879 --> 00:09:42.281
A-And that's not actually,

00:09:42.314 --> 00:09:44.717
really particularly
the interesting question,

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.553
um, because the law
in this case is simply:

00:09:47.586 --> 00:09:49.288
Was classified information
given to someone

00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:51.190
who is not authorized
to receive it?

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:52.992
Which is basically
any journalist.

00:09:53.025 --> 00:09:54.293
It's the public. It's you.

00:09:54.326 --> 00:09:56.462
It's everyone who did not know

00:09:56.495 --> 00:09:58.397
that their constitutional rights
were being violated,

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:00.299
because that was the secret.

00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:03.369
Um, but there's
another question there,

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:06.405
which is, okay,
if the law was broken,

00:10:06.438 --> 00:10:08.607
was it justified?
And think about this.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.177
If you murder someone,

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.545
you can tell the jury,

00:10:13.578 --> 00:10:15.214
"Well, they were trying
to kill me.

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:16.582
It was self-defense."

00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:19.151
The jury can go, "Well, yes,
they did break the law.

00:10:19.184 --> 00:10:20.686
-"Yes, they did murder someone.
-Mm-hmm.

00:10:20.719 --> 00:10:23.489
But it was justified."
The government argues,

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:25.991
um, that you...
there is no justification

00:10:26.024 --> 00:10:27.393
for telling a journalist,
no matter what.

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:30.095
In fact, they forbid the jury

00:10:30.128 --> 00:10:32.398
from hearing
why you did what you did.

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.533
You cannot voice this.
And don't take my word for it.

00:10:34.566 --> 00:10:38.103
Just two days ago,
the day before my book came out,

00:10:38.136 --> 00:10:41.940
um, there is a whistleblower
by the name of Daniel Hale.

00:10:41.973 --> 00:10:44.610
He's in U.S. prison right now.

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:47.680
He was arrested for giving
documents that were classified

00:10:47.713 --> 00:10:50.249
to journalists
about the U.S. drone program.

00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:51.917
Extrajudicial killings.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.554
And the United States government
just filed--

00:10:55.587 --> 00:10:57.890
in the same court
that they're going to charge me,

00:10:57.923 --> 00:10:59.625
the Eastern District
of Virginia--

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:02.861
they just put in a complaint,
a filing before the judge

00:11:02.894 --> 00:11:05.731
that said,
"We demand that the court

00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:07.533
"prohibit the jury from hearing

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:09.134
"and we prohibit the defendant

00:11:09.167 --> 00:11:11.737
"from saying
why he did what he did

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.305
-because it's irrelevant."
-And that... Yeah.

00:11:13.338 --> 00:11:15.174
-And so you feel... -They said
the jury shouldn't be distracted

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:16.508
-with reasons.
-Right. So...

00:11:16.541 --> 00:11:18.477
I mean, that makes...
that makes a lot of sense.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.045
And so you're in a...

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:21.580
you're in a serious predicament
right now.

00:11:21.613 --> 00:11:22.848
The book is gonna come out.

00:11:22.881 --> 00:11:24.416
Um, you know,
the U.S. government's

00:11:24.449 --> 00:11:25.651
gonna fight not...

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:27.286
for you to not get the money
from the book.

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:29.021
They can't stop the book
from coming out.

00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:30.689
Uh, but you are in Russia,

00:11:30.722 --> 00:11:33.492
where you've lived
for a long time now.

00:11:33.525 --> 00:11:36.195
You seem to be in good spirits,
which is interesting

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:38.630
for someone who's been
in Russia for this long.

00:11:38.663 --> 00:11:39.998
(laughter)

00:11:40.031 --> 00:11:42.434
-Like, what is that like? -Well,
they don't have Taco Bell,

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:43.869
-but they do have Burger King.
-Because, I mean, as someone

00:11:43.902 --> 00:11:45.637
who's not a fan of surveillance,
Russia's a weird place

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:47.673
to be enjoying your life.

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:49.508
-Is there something about Russia
we don't know? -Yeah, yeah.

00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:50.676
-So, this is...
-Is, like... Is there...

00:11:50.709 --> 00:11:51.944
Are there, like,
cool spots in Russia

00:11:51.977 --> 00:11:53.479
that more people
need to learn about?

00:11:53.512 --> 00:11:55.380
-Is that where Edward Snowden
goes to chill? -At least...

00:11:55.413 --> 00:11:56.782
(laughs)

00:11:56.815 --> 00:11:59.451
So, Moscow is actually
a lot more like New York

00:11:59.484 --> 00:12:02.087
than you might think,
for good and bad there.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.957
Um, the problem is the politics
in Russia.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:07.693
The human rights record
of Russia are terrible.

00:12:07.726 --> 00:12:09.128
And a lot of people
don't realize--

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.263
and this is extensively covered
in the book--

00:12:11.296 --> 00:12:13.432
I didn't choose to go to Russia.

00:12:13.465 --> 00:12:15.501
-Right. -I was en route
to Latin America.

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:18.437
Um, the United States government
canceled my passport,

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.640
and then, uh, when I was trapped
in the Russian airport...

00:12:21.673 --> 00:12:25.310
Uh, I spent 40 days
stuck in an airport

00:12:25.343 --> 00:12:27.479
because I wouldn't cooperate
with the Russian authorities.

00:12:27.512 --> 00:12:29.848
I don't know what the longest
layover you guys have ever had,

00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:31.717
but 40 days, uh...

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:33.752
(laughs)
That was not the best part

00:12:33.785 --> 00:12:35.087
of the time I've spent
in Russia.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.288
Um, I applied for asylum

00:12:36.321 --> 00:12:38.056
in 27 different countries
around the world,

00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:41.260
places like France,
Germany, Italy, Norway.

00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:45.063
And every time they got close,
uh, to letting me come,

00:12:45.096 --> 00:12:46.698
the United States government

00:12:46.731 --> 00:12:48.834
would call, uh,
their foreign ministry,

00:12:48.867 --> 00:12:51.537
and it would be either
then the vice president

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:53.605
or then the Secretary of State,
and they would say,

00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:55.440
"There will be consequences
if you let this guy in.

00:12:55.473 --> 00:12:56.842
"Doesn't matter if it's legal.

00:12:56.875 --> 00:12:58.977
"Doesn't matter if the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.079
"says he has a right to seek
and enjoy asylum.

00:13:01.112 --> 00:13:02.481
"Um, there's gonna be
consequences.

00:13:02.514 --> 00:13:03.615
"We're not gonna say
what they are,

00:13:03.648 --> 00:13:04.716
but there will be punishment."

00:13:04.749 --> 00:13:07.085
And so what I ask you guys is

00:13:07.118 --> 00:13:10.889
you would think, right,
former NSA, former CIA,

00:13:10.922 --> 00:13:13.358
like, the last place on Earth

00:13:13.391 --> 00:13:16.562
the government would want me
to be is in Russia.

00:13:16.595 --> 00:13:19.198
Why are they working so hard
to keep me here?

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:20.732
And I think the reality is

00:13:20.765 --> 00:13:23.669
it's just a convenient political
attack that will never go away.

00:13:23.702 --> 00:13:27.339
Well, you are truly one of the
most interesting human beings

00:13:27.372 --> 00:13:28.740
on the planet,
because you have lived

00:13:28.773 --> 00:13:30.542
one of the most interesting
lives on the planet.

00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:33.078
But one thing that
really struck me from the book

00:13:33.111 --> 00:13:34.880
is I think a lot of people
don't realize

00:13:34.913 --> 00:13:37.683
how young and normal
you are and were

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:39.151
before this happened to you.

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:41.553
Like, you're just a young guy
who, like,

00:13:41.586 --> 00:13:43.889
likes computers
and plays video games.

00:13:43.922 --> 00:13:45.290
-(laughs)
-And, like,

00:13:45.323 --> 00:13:47.626
I know that you-you
actually have to pirate games

00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:48.894
'cause you can't use
a credit card

00:13:48.927 --> 00:13:50.529
because then people
can track you.

00:13:50.562 --> 00:13:52.130
So, what--
like, what games are you--

00:13:52.163 --> 00:13:54.333
Are you, like,
a Fortnite person? Are you...

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:55.801
-(laughs)
-Like, what-what games

00:13:55.834 --> 00:13:57.603
-does Edward Snowden play?
-I played...

00:13:57.636 --> 00:13:59.738
I-I played Fortnite recently.

00:13:59.771 --> 00:14:02.207
And, uh, I-I spent,
like, a week on it.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.742
And then I got really mad,

00:14:03.775 --> 00:14:05.811
because, like,
their matchmaking system, man.

00:14:05.844 --> 00:14:07.212
They-they just put people
who don't know

00:14:07.245 --> 00:14:09.014
what the hell they're doing in

00:14:09.047 --> 00:14:11.149
-with, like, the world's
greatest pros. -(laughing)

00:14:11.182 --> 00:14:12.818
And I'm like, "Come on. Come--"

00:14:12.851 --> 00:14:14.286
I'm 36 years old, man.

00:14:14.319 --> 00:14:17.022
I can't keep up
with these 12-year-olds.

00:14:17.055 --> 00:14:18.357
Well, you know what, man,

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.892
I just want to say thank you
so much for your time.

00:14:19.925 --> 00:14:21.760
Um, the book is illuminating.

00:14:21.793 --> 00:14:23.962
Uh, I think everyone has
benefited from what you've done.

00:14:23.995 --> 00:14:25.597
Before you go though,
I do have one question,

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:27.266
uh, to that r--
uh, to that regard.

00:14:27.299 --> 00:14:29.334
Do you think
you've made a difference?

00:14:29.367 --> 00:14:31.603
Or do you think
you've just been a big story?

00:14:31.636 --> 00:14:33.739
Like, is our data safer?

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:36.141
Has the government
changed its tactics?

00:14:36.174 --> 00:14:38.810
Or was this all for nothing?
You know?

00:14:38.843 --> 00:14:41.680
Do you live in Russia
for-for nothing?

00:14:41.713 --> 00:14:43.882
There's no question, um...

00:14:43.915 --> 00:14:45.550
And this is covered in the book.
It's actually--

00:14:45.583 --> 00:14:47.219
The-the final chapter's, uh,

00:14:47.252 --> 00:14:49.821
sort of an overview
of what's changed.

00:14:49.854 --> 00:14:51.757
Um, there's no question.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.160
The entire structure of the
Internet has changed since 2013.

00:14:55.193 --> 00:14:57.529
Uh, the world's biggest
technology companies,

00:14:57.562 --> 00:15:00.265
good and bad for privacy,
h-have reengineered,

00:15:00.298 --> 00:15:03.201
um, the kind of protections
that we experience

00:15:03.234 --> 00:15:05.203
that you don't even see,

00:15:05.236 --> 00:15:08.206
uh, simply because they realized
the government w-was sort of,

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:10.375
-uh, going in, uh,
under cover of darkness -Mm-hmm.

00:15:10.408 --> 00:15:12.377
and helping themselves
to the buffet,

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.179
uh, without anybody noticing.

00:15:14.212 --> 00:15:16.248
Our laws have changed.

00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:18.517
Our international standards
has changed.

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:20.252
But the most important thing--

00:15:20.285 --> 00:15:22.120
and this is what I think
people forget--

00:15:22.153 --> 00:15:24.990
um, is you don't look,

00:15:25.023 --> 00:15:28.460
uh, for some guy to come out of
a building a-and save the world.

00:15:28.493 --> 00:15:30.329
That-That's not how life works.

00:15:30.362 --> 00:15:32.764
Um, what 2013 did,

00:15:32.797 --> 00:15:35.500
the most important thing
that no one can ever change,

00:15:35.533 --> 00:15:37.569
uh, is, before 2013,

00:15:37.602 --> 00:15:39.171
the idea of mass surveillance,

00:15:39.204 --> 00:15:41.506
people knew it was possible.

00:15:41.539 --> 00:15:43.241
There were technologists
and academics

00:15:43.274 --> 00:15:45.310
and people who suspected
this was going on.

00:15:45.343 --> 00:15:47.579
Um, but it was
kind of a conspiracy theory,

00:15:47.612 --> 00:15:49.181
because it was a suspicion.

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:51.316
And that distance

00:15:51.349 --> 00:15:53.919
between suspicion and fact

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:55.854
is everything in a democracy.

00:15:55.887 --> 00:15:58.390
That is all we have
in a free society, because we--

00:15:58.423 --> 00:16:02.060
if we can't agree
on what is happening,

00:16:02.093 --> 00:16:03.862
how can we decide

00:16:03.895 --> 00:16:06.431
what we should do about it?

00:16:06.464 --> 00:16:09.034
Government in a democracy
derives its, uh,

00:16:09.067 --> 00:16:11.570
legitimacy from the consent
of the governed.

00:16:11.603 --> 00:16:14.106
And the biggest problem in 2013,

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:18.043
uh, was that consent is only
meaningful if it's informed.

00:16:18.076 --> 00:16:19.778
And they lied to us.

00:16:19.811 --> 00:16:23.048
Edward Snowden, thank you so
much for joining us on the show.

00:16:23.081 --> 00:16:24.850
Good luck in Fortnite.

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:28.887
