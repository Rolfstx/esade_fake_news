00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.040
Once an online bookstore, Amazon now
sells just about anything you would

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.610
find in a home or business,
and has developed a formidable formula.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.190
Meanwhile storied and
once dominant U.S.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.560
retail chains everywhere
are struggling.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.760
Faced with monumental shifts in
the way consumers shop. Once

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.330
remarkably durable brands have shuttered
their stores, which sometimes

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.650
number in the hundreds.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.300
The more than century-old retailer,
Sears, once the country's largest

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.810
chain, filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy in 2018.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.310
Just one of the many victims
of the so-called retail apocalypse.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.930
There is no question, the world
is dramatically different than it was

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.700
even a decade ago.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.390
So how do
traditional retailers survive?

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.600
Some answers may lie with Best Buy.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.270
It might seem to be a
relic of a bygone era.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.620
Much of its business model is
based on large format physical stores.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.430
Pretty much the very definition of
what is failing across the industry.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.980
But Best Buy is killing it.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.630
Shares are hovering near an all
time high fueled by a transformation

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.250
centered on in-store service and stocking
its shelves with new key

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.410
products in health care
and smart homes.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.340
It is a rebirth many
in the industry consider miraculous.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.030
In 2012, Best Buy was in dire shape.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.560
Sales were plummeting, morale had
tanked, and executives were scrambling

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.400
to save the company.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.810
Within the space of just a few
years, a retail giant that employed

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.900
nearly 170,000 people and dominated
its industry, nearly died.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.020
Then, somehow, it didn't.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.670
While retailers such as Toys R Us
bit the dust, Best Buy bucked the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:58.150
trend.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.190
Now the CEO who pulled off
this miraculous turnaround is stepping down,

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.870
and the company's CFO will now steer
the revived retailer and fend off

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.220
still growing threats.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.370
So how did Best Buy
engineered such a renaissance?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.740
Is its massive recovery sustainable?

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.270
And can it be replicated?

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.430
Best Buy's origins can be
traced back to St.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.710
Paul Minnesota in the late 1960s.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.640
Electronics salesman, Richard Schultz, founded
a store in the area

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.930
called Sound of Music.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.370
It sold stereos, speakers, vinyl
records and other audio equipment.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.060
It grew into a chain but
the business found greater success after

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.010
Schultz adopted the big box format.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.150
The Best Buy concept was born, and
Schultz renamed the store in 1983.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.380
Two years later it went public.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.910
Growth was slow at first in its
first decade as a public company.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.560
Its stock only peaked at a high of
five dollars and three cents in late

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.600
1994.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.290
But over the next 20 years,
Best Buy became the largest U.S.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.150
seller of electronics in the Golden
Age of America's big box retailers.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.470
These big stores, modeled on warehouses,
really rose to dominance in the

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.800
1980s and 1990s and
they spread across segments.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.310
Home Depot and Lowe's became
major home improvement stores.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.430
Petco and Petsmart ruled
the pets category.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.600
Stores such as Bed Bath and Beyond
and Linens and Things dominated home

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.020
goods.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.220
Best Buy was considered a best in
class retailer and the growth was

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.970
spectacular.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.870
Best Buy had 679 stores
at the end of 2003.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.210
By the end of 2009, it had 3,889.

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:47.470
Sales climbed from roughly 21 billion
to 45 billion over the same

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.980
period.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.300
Its stock jumped to above
50 dollars a share.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.720
But Amazon was starting to rise in the
late 1990s and it seemed to offer

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.460
deals too good to refuse.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.730
It could sell a customer the same
exact products they could find in a

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.630
store, but often at lower prices and
with free shipping due to the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.960
nature of e-commerce.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.700
Amazon often did not have to charge
sales tax which could make a huge

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.490
difference in price on high
ticket items like televisions and

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.210
appliances.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.650
Amazon's first wave of success began
to shake out smaller competitors

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.690
such as Comp USA and Twitter.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.290
But it took a bit longer and a
few other blows to dent bigger players

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.650
like Circuit City, which during Best
Buy's heyday, was its biggest

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.330
competitor in 2008.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.560
Circuit City was fending off an active
investor who wanted to shake up

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.190
its management.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.670
Then the financial crisis hit and
sparked a slowdown in consumer

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.720
spending that culminated in the
Great Recession in November 2008.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.080
It filed for bankruptcy, and with the
lack of credit, was forced to

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.620
liquidate.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.180
Circuit City closed its last
567 stores in 2009.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.020
At that point, the retailer had been
around for more than 60 years, and

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.240
it had more than 700
stores in its heyday.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.690
Circuit City's demise gave Best Buy
a bit of a tailwind.

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.780
Industry sales were down about
10 percent that year.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.280
But as Circuit City began closing
up stores, shoppers shifted to Best

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.880
Buy. The result: Best Buy's
sales fell only five percent.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:13.570
It had gone from being the
biggest of several national electronics

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.550
chains to the only one left.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.240
But, competing with fellow brick and
mortar stores like this was what

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.470
Best Buy was used to, and the
rapidly ascending Amazon was a another

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:24.640
beast entirely.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.360
Analysts who follow Best Buy say
the company might have underestimated

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.330
the threat from the
Seattle based e-commerce giant.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.700
The Amazon threat, for years, had been
masked by the arrival of the flat

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:37.510
screen television.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.710
Massive technological leaps to sleek
televisions with crystal clear

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:44.980
pictures motivated people all over the country
to go out and buy new

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:45.550
sets.

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.590
Perhaps the best years for the
product cycle were 2005 and 2006.

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:51.070
B

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.550
ut retailers benefited for the better
part of the decade as e-commerce

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.100
continued to quietly strengthen its
grip on the market.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.090
But by the time the Great Recession
began to hit, Best Buy started to

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:05.890
suffer. A slowing housing market in
2007 hit sales of appliances and

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.720
large home electronics. The

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.810
following financial crisis dried up
credit and tightened consumer

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:11.950
spending around the country.

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.630
Finding the lowest prices possible on
what items a buyer could afford

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.640
became even more of a priority.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.940
Best Buy same store sales fell 1.3

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.600
percent in 2008.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:28.630
Things turned around briefly in 2009,
but same store sales fell again

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.600
every year from 2010 through 2013.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.870
Best Buy went from pulling in 1.2

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:40.180
billion dollars in net income in 2011,
to a one billion dollar loss in

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:46.210
2012, and another forty three
million dollar loss in 2013.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.660
Other things happening at the
company did not exactly inspire

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:51.220
confidence among investors.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.320
Then CEO Brian Dunn a lifelong best
buy employee who had started as a

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.190
blue shirt worker on the
store floor resigned in 2012.

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.390
This came after news surfaced that he
may have had a relationship with

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.800
a younger female employee.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:10.900
The fallout from the episode led Schultz
to resign as chairman in 2012

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.580
Best Buy's board brought in Zubair
Joly a relative outsider who had

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.720
previously worked at McKinsey and Vivendi
where approved the launch of

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.600
successful video games such
as World of Warcraft.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:26.740
It is Jolie's tenure that is
credited with turning the company around

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.150
when he joined.

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:34.090
It was a very tumultuous time at
Best Buy as a retail analyst with

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.560
almost 20 years of experience.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.690
There are very few retailers that
have experienced going through such a

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.130
period of hatred and
concern as Best Buy.

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:48.610
I was going through in 2012 if
you looked at valuation metrics the

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.940
stock was priced as if this was a
company that was going to go bankrupt

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:53.450
within five years.

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:58.060
And the initial reaction from the
Wall Street community and investors

00:07:58.150 --> 00:08:03.180
was who is who bear Jolie and how
is this man going to save Best Buy.

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:07.390
The new CEO and his staff began
cutting costs and investing in parts of

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:11.050
Best Buy's business that gave it
advantages over its online competitors

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.340
that started with service and
stores up to that point.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:18.520
Best Buy was one of many
retailers faced with a problem sometimes

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.240
referred to as showroom where customers
would walk into a store to

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.630
inspect and learn about products they wanted
only to go home and buy

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.380
them online often via Amazon
and usually at cheaper prices.

00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:33.430
So Best Buy had to take the fight
to them and it did so by leveraging

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:38.920
its large network of stores matching
Amazon's prices and focusing on

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.730
providing the customer service
and online retailer can't.

00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:47.620
In 2012 Best Buy began matching any
price on an item anyone could find

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.850
elsewhere. That meant a customer checking
out a stereo system computer

00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:55.690
or phone could walk out of one
of Best Buy stores with that product.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.000
On that day and pay the same price.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.050
The company also started shipping
online orders directly from stores

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.190
turning every store into a small
warehouse which increased Best Buy's

00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:08.590
available inventory and
shorten delivery times.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.820
They also put in place an easy
process for returning online products in

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.660
stores saving customers the trouble of
packing something back up in a

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.230
box.

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.680
If you think about it all or
all of retail right now is working

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.520
aggressively to become omni channel
and that's their advantage versus

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:24.880
the web.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.240
They have physical stores.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:30.850
Why not leverage that use those stores
as pickup points drop off points

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.050
shipping points.

00:09:32.330 --> 00:09:34.240
The Web can't really do that.

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:38.350
The web that last mile is really where
the stores can come in and try

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:39.520
to be more effective.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:44.000
And you've seen that you know
Wal-Mart Target Costco they're going big

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.880
time after the
omni channel consumer.

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:49.270
Best Buy also begin working closely
with the store's vendors which many

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:51.760
say has been a crucial
step in the company's turnaround.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.720
The company started giving electronics
makers their own dedicated

00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.280
sections at Best Buy stores.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.290
This store within-a-store concept was
mutually beneficial to both Best

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.640
Buy and these tech firms.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:07.330
The first deal during Jolie's tenure
was with Korean electronics maker

00:10:07.330 --> 00:10:10.060
Samsung in April of 2013. Then

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.080
Microsoft followed.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.220
Best Buy also made a deal with
Apple to revamp its displays even worked

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:19.090
with Amazon to be the exclusive
seller of smart TV's embedded with

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.070
Amazon's fired TV technology.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.850
The retailer keeps the exact details of
these deals close to its chest,

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:28.300
but essentially it shares the cost
of investments and the revenues with

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:30.250
each manufacturer in turn.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:33.430
Device makers can exercise greater control
over how their products are

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:34.570
presented to customers.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.900
They can set up their displays
and tailor the shopping experience much

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.680
the way they want.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:41.770
They often bring their own staff
into the stores who obviously know

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:42.670
their products best.

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:46.120
Customers can learn about something
directly from its manufacturer and

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.400
Best Buy employees can receive
training from the vendors.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.870
This arrangement gives sometimes fierce
competitors such as Google Apple

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.530
and Amazon a kind of neutral ground
where each can sell their competing

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.760
products side by side.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.150
The store within a store
concept deepened the symbiotic relationship

00:11:01.150 --> 00:11:04.240
between the retailer and suppliers and
kept them invested in Best Buy

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.440
survival and success.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:09.100
Best Buy's troubles had spelled danger
from any of these device makers

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.990
who do not really have their
own physical retail networks and

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:13.790
suppliers.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.460
That was a scary time for them.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.800
All of a sudden they
started to think about.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:21.160
What if we're in a world
where there is no Best Buy.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.510
Suppliers realized that was
not a pleasant world.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.260
And I think that the
message was to suppliers

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.240
from Best Buy was, "You need us as
much as we need you. So, you

00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.440
know, help to support us and we
will showcase and sell your products."

00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:42.820
The company also bet on service both
inside and outside its stores Best

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:46.360
Buy invested in training for its
floor employees commonly known as blue

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.040
shirts for the polo
shirts they wear.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.000
The retailer figured that a store
can offer customers something online

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.970
typically does not flesh and blood
authorities on products who can

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:57.610
answer questions and
make recommendations.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:02.920
One of the pillars of Best Buy's
approach to service is its Geek Squad

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.650
division which it acquired
back in 2002.

00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:10.180
Geek Squad sends technicians to homes
to set up troubleshoot and repair

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.880
electronics bought at Best
Buy or elsewhere.

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.960
The group has a membership program
and aims to be a comprehensive

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:20.730
in-home service that will set up
fix or troubleshoot anything that

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:24.690
plugs into a wall from home
theaters to networking devices to

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:29.430
appliances. Geek Squad has 23 years
of experience making house calls

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.480
and currently employs 20000 people
who make 33 million total

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.920
interactions with consumers a year
including one point eight million

00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:42.540
home visits according to Jefferies, Geek
Squad and other services make

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.090
up a small but growing
portion of Best Buy's revenues.

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.630
The chain pulled in about five percent
of its sales from services in

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.170
2018 up from about four
percent the previous year.

00:12:52.530 --> 00:12:55.920
Best Buy is betting that as
our homes fill up with complex

00:12:56.010 --> 00:13:00.090
interconnected devices customers will
increasingly want one company

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:02.070
that can tackle everything.

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.120
It is also pushing a new product
areas it thinks offer potentially high

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.660
margins such as smart home
technology and health care.

00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:13.890
In 2018 it acquired Great
Call for $800 million dollars.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:18.660
Great call makes smartphones and wearables
aimed at older adults and

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.080
sells the service customers can use
to quickly access caregivers and

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.040
first responders.

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.140
The work has paid off.

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:30.090
Best Buy shares have risen
from a high of $44.66

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:34.890
a share in 2013 to $75.95

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:36.860
cents a share in 2019.

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:41.100
Same store sales have grown
every year since 2015.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.760
In the process the company is becoming
something of a model for other

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:48.270
retailers showing how businesses can
steer through a competitive and

00:13:48.270 --> 00:13:51.390
rapidly changing technology
fueled retail market.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.500
Now that Best Buy has turned itself
around though the question is: Where

00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:56.520
does it go from here?

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.360
Joly is stepping down, and Best
Buy has appointed its chief financial

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:02.220
officer Corie Barry to the top job.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.300
Barry oversees the company's service
division and its Health Division

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:10.710
and was a key player in the
Great Call acquisition and she's a veteran.

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:13.020
She's worked at the
company since 1999.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.820
Analysts say Barry is certainly qualified
to take the job and she's

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.970
well liked by Wall Street.

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.880
But Joly's shoes will not
be easy to fill.

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:25.560
Corie Barry is a very strong
leader within their Best Buy organization

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.900
and I think she's going to
be great as the next CEO.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.220
She has big shoes to fill.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:32.970
Hubert Joly did a phenomenal job turning
Best Buy around and making it

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:33.660
relevant again.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:38.670
But I think Corey Barry has
a very strong operating background and

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.940
strategic thinking background that's going to
help her to achieve great

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:43.310
things in the future for Best Buy.

00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:46.320
For now the company
is focused on execution.

00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:49.770
It has put together some plans that give
it a solid chance at a future.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.240
But what about competitors.

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:55.860
Amazon after all surprised the world
by buying Whole Foods and entering

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.000
the grocery business.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.150
Best Buy is still the
largest seller of electronics.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.310
It sold 32.4

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:06.270
billion dollars in electronics in 2017,
a five percent increase over

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:09.540
the previous year according
to industry publication twice.

00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:12.990
But Amazon was not
far behind, selling 30.1

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:16.800
billion dollars worth a four
percent increase over 2016.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.310
Could the online giant move
on to Best Buy's turf?

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.860
Once again this time
with its own stores.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:27.060
For now, Best Buy has found a way
to dig deep into what it knows:

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:31.500
electronics. It is also leveraged its
strengths in stores and service

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.360
while beefing up
its online presence.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:38.460
Analysts are optimistic but this is
an era of unprecedented disruption

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:41.250
and there is a long list of
retailers that have gone out of

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:43.110
business, in electronics alone.

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:47.190
If Best Buy expects to stick around it
needs to keep a pretty wide moat

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.520
between it and
rivals especially Amazon.
