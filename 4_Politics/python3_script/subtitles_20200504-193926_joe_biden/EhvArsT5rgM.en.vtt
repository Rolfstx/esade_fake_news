00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:10.109
This guy as a young man had a dream a dream to become a big movie star to come to a

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.209
Hollywood and to become a great director and producer and a writer and all those kind of dreams

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.340
He had of course everyone told him it can't be done

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.189
But, you know, he wouldn't take no for an answer and he moved across from New York to Los Angeles to Hollywood

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.849
And of course one day after struggling as we all do in the beginning to get into TV and in the movies

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.639
He had this idea of writing a script and in longhand he wrote this script

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.190
Which was Rocky?

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.960
It's all about dreams, you know, and by the way dreams cost nothing they're free

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.700
the hard part is just keeping them going and please keep them going because

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.660
We're here for one simple reason he believed in the dream

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:01.689
I believed in the dream and our dreams come true and there's no reason every one of yours. Can't either I

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.820
Used to sit in this little apartment in that I was a room with my factory was so small

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.350
Remember I was able to open up the window and close the door while sitting on the bed at the same time

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.029
it was like eight feet by eight feet by nine feet and but

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.869
The one thing about that room there was really very little distraction

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.399
so I would sit there propped up in bed and I go out with my big pen and a

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:37.689
legal pad and just start writing these these stories and and most of them were very very trivial but

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.300
there was something about the process of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.610
Unrealized dreams. I was always brought back to this subject because I think it's one of the most

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.389
enduring subjects and one of the most difficult

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.979
Passages for people to accept that they never were realized in their own lifetime that they just didn't get that shot

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.549
I decided it was a time to come to California

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:04.939
so to, California

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:10.599
and I moved in the valley and things weren't going very well there as a matter of fact I had to confront and

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.149
Try to sell my dog because he was either

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.680
do that or

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.590
He just was not gonna be very well fed and then one night I went to see

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.739
Muhammad Ali a fight for one brief moment

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.090
this

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.090
supposed

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.459
Stumblebum turned out to be

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.250
Magnificent in the fact that he lasted and knocked the champion down I said boy

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.559
This isn't a metaphor for life his entire life crystallized at that moment. He will be remembered

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.649
For all eternity, at least it was among the fight fans. He did something extraordinary none of that

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.429
That is probably what I need as a catalyst for an idea the man who's going to stand up to life

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.549
And take one shot and maybe go the distance

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.679
So I started to write and it was one of those writing frenzies and three days later

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.709
I came up with the script of Rocky

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.729
Now the script by no means was a finished piece of material

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:16.358
It was probably about 90 pages and maybe 10% of it remained in the final script, but it was done

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.989
I

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.079
First met Bob shot off in Irwin Winkler and I believe I was there on on a

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.790
casting call

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.120
So we're talking a little bit and I guess I really wasn't right for the acting partner on the way out

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.090
I said, um, I don't know if it matters but I do a little bit of writing because really he says he's yeah

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.680
I'm writing this story

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.049
So I have this thing about wrestlers and I might do some of the boxing while you as well

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.610
Bringing around and I thought if I hadn't stopped on the way out

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.599
That's why I tell all actors hover haters don't give up keep talking eventually. You might hit a nerve somewhere. They go

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:59.849
come on back and

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.690
If they didn't say come on back or bring it later and let's see what you've developed. I wouldn't be sitting here

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:14.279
so I have to give incredible credit to their to their insight and their patience and they're willing to take a chance which

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.749
It doesn't exist much anymore unfortunately

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.630
Originally when I brought the script to them they were and fairly enthusiastic about it

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.179
The one thing they were not enthusiastic about was me playing the pardon and I really can't blame them at the time

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.360
But there was something inside of me that that you know

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.730
this

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.319
opportunity is never gonna come around and I really wasn't used to money and I had no idea of what I would be missing but

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.010
the temptation started to come forward first it was

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.250
25 grains and

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:00.379
$100,000 zero, I never heard of 100 selling because I had had like a hundred six dollars the banking

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.130
Like I said, I had to sell my dog and things were not looking very very good

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.029
My $40 car had just blown up. So I was taking a bus to work

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.920
And was still it didn't matter. I wanted to stick with it. Then I went up to 150

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.560
775 south and went up to

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.130
250,000 now my head was starting to spin and it went up to three hundred and thirty thousand and

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.770
Probably I heard it was three hundred sixty thousand and I thought all right, you know

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.179
You've really managed poverty very well. You've got this down to a science

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:37.519
You really don't need much to live on I had like sort of figured it out. So I was not

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.029
in in any way I

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.258
Used to to the good life, so I thought you know what?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.789
If I know in the back of my mind if I sell the script and it does very very well

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.000
I'm gonna jump off the pole and if I'm not it

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
so this is one of those things where you just roll the dice and you

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.579
Fly by the proverbial seat of your pants a guy got frightened. I gotta just do it

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.430
I may be totally wrong and I'm gonna be taking a lot of people down with me, but I just believe in it

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.049
we were working with the handheld camera at the time was was Garrett Brown and it was

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:22.579
Somewhat experimental and he'd film me running through shopping balls and up down and steps and flights. I mean

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.929
curved corridors along the river until finally my legs basically gave out and I'm like writhing on the ground and I want to

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:38.359
Rise up as hey John. I'm dying here and he goes no no use it used to pain. I said for what I mean

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.840
I'm in misery because well no, no, you know, it's giving your character

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:47.599
It's giving him some depth I said is giving me bruises is giving me like agony

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:52.819
I can't sleep at night like the scene where we just jumped down and saw this ship along the dock this

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.959
Doctor long appearance it just jump out run as faster

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:02.210
You can launch this ship and and and I'm running and running I said, you know what my legs are buckling

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.759
I'm literally gonna crash down here. Teeth are gonna go jaw face

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.569
I'm just gonna be ground down to this flat faced image, please

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.680
Just barely made it

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:34.469
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows it's a very mean and nasty place and I don't care how tough you are

00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:38.729
It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it you

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:45.088
Me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:52.588
But it ain't about how hard you hit it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:54.659
And keep moving forward

00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:57.119
That's how weird it is done

00:08:04.209 --> 00:08:07.078
Now if you know what you're worth that go out and get what you're worth

00:08:07.079 --> 00:08:12.929
but you got to be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you ain't where you wanna be because of him or

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:15.029
Her or anybody?

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:18.268
Cowards do that and that ain't you you're better than that

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.120
You can't be alone

00:08:27.879 --> 00:08:29.039
To really succeed

00:08:29.039 --> 00:08:29.669
No, man

00:08:29.669 --> 00:08:31.669
Really is an island when you find the right

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:36.599
components in your life the right people that gel with you then you feel as though you

00:08:37.719 --> 00:08:40.349
You're invincible. It may be a fallacy

00:08:40.349 --> 00:08:44.429
But you at least feel as though you can you can take all that life has to dish out

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:54.129
At the very end of our lives if we can still say, you know, and we were never humbled

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.309
we were knocked down but we got up and I can say I

00:08:57.770 --> 00:09:05.230
Lived life with integrity and I took all the blows as the song says and I still prevailed I think that's it. That's a

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:07.870
Good epitaph for anyone

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:23.099
It's all about dreams, you know, and by the way dreams cost nothing they're free

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.849
The hard part is just keeping them going and please keep them growing because we're here for one simple reason

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:37.440
He believed in the dream. I believed in the dream when our dreams come true and there's no reason every one of yours. Can't either

00:10:03.649 --> 00:10:05.649
You
