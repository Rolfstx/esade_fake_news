00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.460
Singapore's Changi Airport is considered by
many travelers to be the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.440
best in the world.
Have a long layover?

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.830
Stop by the butterfly garden or catch
a Disney film at the airports

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.910
movie theater.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.370
In Qatar's Hamad Airport
for a few hours?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.640
For about 50 bucks,

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.800
travelers can swim laps in a 25
meter indoor swimming pool or workout

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.090
in a fully equipped gym.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.040
Traveling during Christmas?

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.430
Each year Munich's airport puts
a pop-up holiday market, complete

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.330
with an ice skating rink, a
microbrewery and 450 real Christmas

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.470
trees. And then, there's LaGuardia
Airport in New York City.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.260
The 1950's and 60's have often been
described as the Golden Age of

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.190
flying. Traveling by air meant three
piece suits for men, high heels

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.980
for women, lavish meals and
lots of leg room.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.910
Today, at U.S. airports, passengers are
forced to wait in long

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.240
security lanes and then line up
for fast food, before boarding

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.790
overcrowded airplanes with
no free meals.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.240
So why are U.S. airports so
cash strapped compared to their

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.620
international counterparts?

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.700
Airports in the U.S. started to
take shape in the early 1920's.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.740
At the time, passenger service
was virtually nonexistent and airlines

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.990
were flying mostly mail.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.390
While a few airfields were
built before World War I,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.110
airport construction really began in the
United States when the post

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.590
office began to experiment with
carrying the mail by air,

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.070
they needed places to land.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.120
During the Great Depression with
big improvements in technology,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.130
passenger service suddenly
took off.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.210
In 1930, America's airlines
carried about 6,000 travelers.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.810
By 1938, that number soared to 1.2

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.260
million. Flying was loud, cold and
only business travelers or the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.560
wealthy could afford it. Most of
the passengers during the 1930's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.710
were business people and they
understood that time is money.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.030
As aviation grew, as new airplanes
came in, they understood that this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.260
could move them faster, but
also could move financial instruments

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.740
faster. By 1940, modern
airports started to evolve.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.750
Planes got bigger, grass gave way
to pavement and terminal buildings

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.180
grew, from simple structures that were
small and dingy, to art deco

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.140
buildings designed by architects.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.990
With massive amounts
of public financing,

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.070
America was well into the jet age.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.630
By 2019, thanks in large part
to government cash, the U.S.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.640
has more than 19,000 airports.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.900
For the most part,
airports in the U.S.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.770
are publicly owned and operated by either
a city, a county, a state

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.930
or in some cases
a public authority.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.320
There are thousands of airports, big
and small, but about 500 are

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.390
consider public use
commercial airports.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.110
In its latest ranking of the
most profitable airports in the U.S.,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.920
the American City Business Journal's said,
the top five airports by

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.200
revenue were JFK, Newark, San
Francisco, Los Angeles and Miami.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.700
Every airport has its own model
for how it brings in cash.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.970
Revenue is also dependent on a whole
lot of factors outside of an

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.930
airport's control, including airline
routes, passenger flows, plus

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.880
local and
international regulations.

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.730
But generally speaking, airport
income in the U.S.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.210
can be boiled down to
three categories: aeronautical operating

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.260
revenue, non-aeronautical operating
revenue and non-operating

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.590
revenue. That first category pulls
in the most cash.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.530
Airports in the U.S. make most
of their money from the airlines.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.040
And that revenue is everything from
landing fees to terminal rents to

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.110
fuel sales.

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.200
In 2016, the most recent year,
the FAA made this data publicly

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.280
available, U.S.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.560
airports collected revenue of $11.3

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.180
billion dollars from the airlines,
including landing fees of $3.7

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.030
billion dollars, terminal rents of $5
billion dollars and cargo and

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.220
hangar rentals of
$661 million dollars.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.550
Because they are government owned
and receive taxpayer subsidies,

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.310
airports try to keep costs low.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.210
Airport revenue streams are really
based historically on minimizing

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.980
costs for the airlines. And that kind
of harkens back to the pre-1978

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.450
days when the airlines
were regulated by government.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.660
As a result, the airports are run
in this kind of cost recovery

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.960
framework where they collect
revenues from various sources.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.920
Non-aeronautical revenue brought in 35
percent of all income for

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.570
airports across the U.S.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.260
For many airports, the biggest
non-airline revenue is from parking.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.820
In 2016, U.S.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.090
airports collected $5.8

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.660
billion dollars from parking
and rental cars.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.750
Parking is a big way
that airports can earn money.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.830
And so you can see why some
airports might be a little reluctant to

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.310
have, say, mass transit, because if
people are coming out there on

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.300
mass transit, they aren't
parking their cars.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.100
We're in an unsettled period in terms
of how people are going to

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.350
choose to access the airport.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.900
Ride sharing has been
growing very fast.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.760
There is a debate
about autonomous vehicles.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.870
Food and beverage operations is another
big source of income pulling

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.830
in $1.5 billion dollars across
all airports in 2016.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.190
And then there's non-operating revenue,
which includes grants from

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.670
the government and interest earned
on surplus cash when airports

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.300
invest in things like bonds.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.650
The biggest source of income within
this category is the passenger

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.770
facility charge, that goes to the
upkeep and maintenance of the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.550
airport. It accounted for 48
percent of all non-operating revenue.

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.390
U.S. airports, particularly smaller ones,
also rely heavily on

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.680
funding from the government.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.210
In 2018, the Airport Improvement Program
gave out over $3 billion to

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.100
more than 1,600 airports.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.760
The Airport Improvement Program supports
the runways, taxiways and

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.830
overall quality and
health of airfields.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.200
Despite America's capitalist driven
economy, it's actually Europe

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.200
that has taken the lead
on privatizing its airports.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.640
In the 1980's and 90's, deregulation
and an increase in demand for

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:46.210
air travel, along with a scarcity
of public funds, forced many

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.020
airports worldwide to seek out
some form of privatization.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.980
Starting with the UK airports in
the mid-1980's, privatization is now

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.600
widespread across Europe.

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:00.280
In 2018, more than 50 percent of
European airports had some form of

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.270
private ownership. Many of the European
airports are run by private

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:07.640
entities that are looking to maximize
shareholder return and gain a

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.930
profit. In the United States
there is no profit motive.

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:14.800
The European airports have found better
ways to extract higher dollar

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.660
amounts from their passengers.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:21.040
In 1996, Congress created the
Airport Privatization Pilot Program,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.610
allowing for experimentation with
public-private partnerships at a

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.110
limited number of airports.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.950
But it wasn't until the
mid-2010's that privatization really started

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.510
to gain momentum in the U.S.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.960
In the face of decaying
infrastructure, a handful of U.S.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.900
airports have started to abandon the
public model and turned to

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.270
private money to fund
billion dollar projects.

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.990
Just take LaGuardia. In numerous
customer surveys, LaGuardia Airport

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:47.540
has consistently ranked the
worst in the U.S.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.530
In 2018, 28 percent of LaGuardia
flights were delayed, placing its

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:54.500
second to last in the
ranking of America's largest airports,

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.660
according to the
Department of Transportation.

00:06:56.930 --> 00:07:01.940
Laguardia Airport was very crowded,
it had low ceilings, the

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.850
furniture was very tired.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.670
After 9-11 where you had to put
in all these security lines, you

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.530
would have lines everywhere.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.070
In 2016, New York State and
the Port Authority partnered with Delta

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.610
Airlines and LaGuardia Gateway Partners
to completely rebuild the

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.910
airport. The airport is now
getting an $8 billion overhaul.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.360
The public-private partnership model has become
more of a trend at

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.820
airports around the world, according
to the World Bank.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.720
Public-private partnerships are a very,
very important part of the

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.810
planning, I would say
at most airports.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.220
The government has limited funds.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:37.400
LaGuardia Gateway Partners, the group
that will finance, construct

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.670
and operate Terminal B, said
the redevelopment, expected to be

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:44.480
finished by 2022, will provide a
host of new services to passengers,

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:48.490
including restaurants like Shake Shack, La
Chula and stores like FAO

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.170
Schwartz. We've introduced the shops,
the amenities, larger hold

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.410
rooms, higher ceilings, lots
of natural light.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.750
Behind me is a
park area with trees.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:08:00.710
There are many things that private
enterprise does much better than

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:01.850
public agencies.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:06.260
And one of them, we believe,
is actually operate both the commercial

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:08.840
and the operational side
of an airport.

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.640
And more airports across the U.S.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:14.060
are also on the way to
getting massive multi-billion dollar makeovers

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.100
thanks to cash
from private companies.

00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:19.670
New York's JFK Airport is planning
to spend $13 billion, including

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.180
$12 billion in private funding
for improvements including two new

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.350
international terminals.

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.610
Los Angeles Airport is spending $14
billion on a giant expansion.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.410
LAX Integrated Express Solutions was
selected to design, build and

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:35.240
operate the terminals
passenger train.

00:08:35.390 --> 00:08:38.990
The Automated People Mover is
LAX's first public-private partnership

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:42.830
project. Since 2000, U.S.

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.860
airports have had to withstand a
number of critical events that have

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.900
had a major impact
on their bottom line.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.930
Following the September 11th attacks, for
the first time since World

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.560
War II, the number of airline
passengers declined for two consecutive

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.510
years. Additional security at U.S.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:09:00.050
airports has placed an even
greater burden on airport operations.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.470
This puts a lot of
capital requirements onto the airports.

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:05.900
So they had to take on a lot
of debt, in order to reconfigure their

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.710
terminals. The financial crisis that started
in 2007 was another blow

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:14.090
to airports. In 2008, air passenger
traffic dropped again at airports

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:17.480
around the country. What I think was
a larger impact was the slow

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.510
recovery following the
Great Recession.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:23.030
In historical recessions there's been a
pretty quick bump back in

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.410
terms of passenger traffic increasing
once the recession was over.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.410
Here, we saw a multi-year period of
a malaise with low growth in the

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:35.690
1 to 2 percent or less than
1 percent and that really started to

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.260
challenge airport finances.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.100
Another factor, dragging down profit
margins for some of the

00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:42.440
country's medium to
smaller size airports.

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.070
There are fewer airlines flying today
than there were in 2009.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.700
In the 10 years to 2018,
the airline industry has experienced

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.470
multiple mergers and acquisitions.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:55.780
In 2008, Northwest Airlines
merged with Delta Airlines.

00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.420
In 2010, Continental Airlines
merged with United Airlines.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.250
And in 2013, U.S.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.550
Airways and American Airlines
parent AMR merged.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.180
That was good news for a few
larger hub airports, but many smaller

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:10.790
airports were forced to deal
with the economic fallout.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.090
A hub airport has a large
number of connecting flights from one

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:15.170
dominating airline.

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:19.910
The mergers that have been happening and
the shrinkage from 10 or 12

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:22.780
major airlines in this country
down to what, three, four?

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.710
That's been a huge challenge.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:29.910
Airports can really grow, look
at Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.370
Those that have maintained hubs,
they're dealing with growth.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:38.300
Airports that had been hubs, they've
had to deal with decline.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.960
According to Airports Council
International, industry consolidation

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.770
had a big impact on
several regional airports, including Pittsburgh,

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.860
St. Lewis, Cincinnati,
Memphis and Cleveland.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.300
If part of a business is severed and
you have a lack of cash flow,

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.560
that money is not flowing into
an airport, you're going to suffer.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:56.010
That means restaurants closed down.

00:10:56.030 --> 00:10:57.560
That means employees get laid off.

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.870
That means revenue is not
coming into that airport.

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.830
While flying is generally cheaper and
safer than it's ever been.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.160
An increase in travelers will
put massive pressure on existing

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:10.360
airport infrastructure.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.910
U.S. airlines and foreign
airlines serving the U.S.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.780
carried about a billion passengers in
2018, up 5 percent from the

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.390
previous year, according to
the Bureau of Transportation.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:23.350
Millions of people go through
LaGuardia, just for everyday

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.700
maintenance and wear and tear, to keep
the floors clean, to keep the

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:30.000
lights on, that takes
a lot of money.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.980
And U.S. airports are getting
older, according to the Airports

00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:34.170
Council International.

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.630
They say airports will need
over $100 billion in infrastructure

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.340
spending over the next five years.

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.790
A useful time period for an airport
to exist is between 25 and 30

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.110
years before it
becomes non-competitive.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.450
Right now, the average age of a
terminal in the United States is a

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:53.210
little over 40 years, so we're
way beyond the international number.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.490
While airports in the U.S.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.280
have shown signs of improvement
in recent years, additional

00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.030
passengers, tightening budgets and
growing competition will force

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:04.600
cash strapped airports to seek out
new sources of financing to

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.010
compete on the world stage.
