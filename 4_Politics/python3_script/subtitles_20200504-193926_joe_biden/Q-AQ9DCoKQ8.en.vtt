00:00:01.048 --> 00:00:02.523
Mr. Orange: Get out of the f---ing car!

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.217
Neil Woods: No wonder he
got shot, to be honest.

00:00:08.217 --> 00:00:09.640
Mind you, he showed out, didn't he?

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.550
Golden rule.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:11.610
I'm Neil Woods.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.928
I'm a former undercover police officer,

00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:15.440
now a board member of the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.590
Law Enforcement Action Partnership,

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.215
and I'm here today to look at

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:21.890
some undercover scenes in movies.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.573
Brian: Yeah, this is
Officer Brian O'Connor.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.560
I'm off-duty MAPD.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.530
Neil: The ethics of undercover
policing is actually

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.169
quite straightforward, because
you remain a police officer.

00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:39.143
So your first duty is to preserve life.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.502
He had no other option there, really.

00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:45.070
A police officer's duty
always remains the same.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.869
Brian: I got one trauma victim,

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:48.553
about 24 years of age,

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:51.030
6 foot, maybe 200 pounds.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.966
Neil: It's actually quite nice detail

00:00:52.966 --> 00:00:56.830
in the verbals that he was using

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.855
to make it clear that

00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:01.304
his knowledge of the situation,

00:01:01.304 --> 00:01:03.615
the trauma to the body,
the medical information,

00:01:03.615 --> 00:01:04.927
was gonna make a real difference

00:01:04.927 --> 00:01:06.293
to the likelihood of his survival.

00:01:06.293 --> 00:01:09.700
So, actually, quite
nicely scripted, really.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.420
But there was a situation where
I was in an isolated place

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.970
with three problematic heroin users,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.930
one of which was yellow with,
suffering from hepatitis C,

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.420
and I found out just before he injected

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.229
that he'd been in police
custody and had no tolerance,

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.140
and then another one, it was
only two filters between them,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.691
and so he injected without
a filter into his groin.

00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:34.250
You know, the chances of
him having an embolism

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.401
as a result of that very
risky injecting behavior.

00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:40.502
Some vulnerable people really
putting themselves at risk.

00:01:40.502 --> 00:01:44.402
It was quite a frightening situation.

00:01:48.702 --> 00:01:50.043
Dwight: We have never met each other.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:51.960
We are complete strangers.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.147
Also, we're gonna need a signal

00:01:53.147 --> 00:01:55.186
to bolt out of there in
case there is danger,

00:01:55.186 --> 00:01:57.700
and that signal is lick your lips. Try it.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.503
No, no, no.

00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:02.046
Like this.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.655
Neil: Well, never have
signals is what I would say,

00:02:06.655 --> 00:02:09.133
but when I have worked on a job,

00:02:09.133 --> 00:02:13.120
very early on I worked with a drug squad,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.170
and I've been meeting this guy,

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.860
who was just wanting to see the money,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.422
and I said to the squad, "There's no way

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:20.655
is there gonna be any drugs.

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:21.890
There's gonna be no drugs."

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.197
And he said, "Well, we'll have a signal

00:02:23.197 --> 00:02:25.070
just in case the drugs are there,"

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.746
of me putting my arm on top of the car.

00:02:27.746 --> 00:02:30.642
Only when we got in the car did I remember

00:02:30.642 --> 00:02:32.170
that that's what he did all the time,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.370
and so all the drug squad all ran in,

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.978
arrested the guy, and there was no drugs.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.115
So signals can always go wrong.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.450
Holdaway: To do this job,
you gotta be a great actor.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.547
You gotta be naturalistic;

00:02:49.547 --> 00:02:51.680
you gotta be naturalistic as h---.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.170
Neil: You are not an actor.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.680
You have to play a different
version of yourself,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.290
but if you're there with the
same people day in, day out,

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.156
you can't maintain an act

00:03:01.156 --> 00:03:02.731
because it becomes fragile.

00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:05.791
It is a good thing to
have anecdotes ready.

00:03:05.791 --> 00:03:07.908
You do; you need anecdotes of the time

00:03:07.908 --> 00:03:09.833
when you ran away from that security guard

00:03:09.833 --> 00:03:11.459
when he caught you shoplifting.

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:12.690
The person you tripped over,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.530
what happened when you fell over.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.170
But you can't rehearse
them from a piece of paper;

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.470
they gotta be yours.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.878
They gotta be your storytelling

00:03:18.878 --> 00:03:20.244
from your imagination,

00:03:20.244 --> 00:03:22.630
and they've got to be
from your own personality.

00:03:23.817 --> 00:03:26.237
Freddy: You're not gonna get hurt.

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:28.460
You're f---ing Beretta. They
believe every f---ing word

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.988
'cause you're supercool.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.940
Neil: Let's say I was
pairing up with someone,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.970
working with another undercover cop.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.500
If I saw them do that in the mirror,

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.970
it would not fill me full
of confidence at all.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.480
If you need that reassurance,

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.228
perhaps you're not where you need to be.

00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:45.760
Mr. Orange: Hold it, hold it!

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.801
Right there.

00:03:48.374 --> 00:03:49.749
Get out of the f---ing car.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.570
Neil: No wonder he got shot, to be honest.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:58.900
Mind you, he showed out, didn't he?

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.900
Golden rule.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.285
Neil: That level of
corruption, where there is

00:04:10.285 --> 00:04:13.220
a spy from one camp in the other camp,

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.200
people assume that that's unusual,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.270
but it's not.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.530
I was on an undercover operation,

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.956
trying to infiltrate just
the periphery of a cartel,

00:04:22.956 --> 00:04:24.880
but that cartel had a spy

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.763
right at the heart of my camp.

00:04:26.763 --> 00:04:28.720
One of my backup team was replaced

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.530
four and a half months into the operation

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.280
with someone that I shook the hand of,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.918
and 12 months later, it
turned out that that person,

00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:39.530
he'd been paid to join the police.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.290
As in, just like "The Departed."

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.360
The time I met him, he'd been
in the police for seven years.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.340
Phone operator: Wait,
there's still one phone up.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:47.563
George: Where?

00:04:49.362 --> 00:04:51.262
[phone vibrates]

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.100
Neil: The handler is sat
next to the covert team

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.380
and actually receiving
messages from the undercover

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.971
while they're there.

00:05:03.971 --> 00:05:05.254
That's a no-no.

00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:07.060
You have to have a complete separation

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.480
from any covert investigating team.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.010
But, yeah, I would've had a mobile phone,

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.630
and sometimes two mobile phones,

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.470
'cause one would have been
an electronic open mic

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.180
and the other phone would
be a normal, operating phone

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.547
that would have all different names in

00:05:21.547 --> 00:05:22.780
that would relate to different people

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.550
I could talk about in my legend.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.350
Because if your gangster friends,

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.967
then see you with a phone and they think,

00:05:28.967 --> 00:05:30.650
"I'm gonna check your phone,"

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.120
and they see that you sent
a message at that time,

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.620
or to even send a message
at that time is ludicrous.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.260
He picked up on the
hostility and the suspicion.

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.335
The moment he did that,

00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:54.800
they picked up on their body
language, subtle as it was.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.360
You have to be sensitive to colloquialism,

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.700
but in my experience, if
someone is suspicious of you,

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.992
they will challenge it instantly.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:06.650
Tony: What's his occupation?

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.483
Mary: Fisherman.

00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:08.380
Tony: Where were you born?

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.580
Mary: Halifax, Nova Scotia.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.835
Tony: What's your date of birth?

00:06:11.835 --> 00:06:14.010
Mary: February 21, 1952.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.130
Neil: Yeah, it's interesting, this.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.160
Whenever you're working undercover,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.180
you have to have your cover story,

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.440
you have to have your legend,

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.580
but in domestic undercover work,

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.696
the legend that you build is more about

00:06:24.696 --> 00:06:25.846
where you've been,

00:06:25.846 --> 00:06:28.020
the experiences you've had,
the people that you know.

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.560
So, for example, if I
was working undercover

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:33.847
and I say to someone that
I used to go drinking

00:06:33.847 --> 00:06:36.040
in The Nags Head in Lincoln,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.940
I would need to know
the name of the person

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.950
who worked the bar on a Wednesday.

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:41.120
Tony: What's your middle name?

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.180
Tony: What's your middle name?
Joe: Leon?

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.616
Tony: Shoot him. He's an American spy.

00:06:44.616 --> 00:06:45.710
Neil: A bit harsh.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.730
Undercover work is a confidence trick.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:49.130
You don't go into it unless

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.920
you know exactly who you
are and for that role,

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.690
and I don't need anyone
testing me for that,

00:06:56.690 --> 00:06:58.180
because testing suggests

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.060
there's some kind of vulnerability there,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.077
and you've got to feel invulnerable.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.903
Martin: Hey.

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:13.790
Gangster: Good, huh?

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:14.693
Tasty, smooth?

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:17.932
Martin: Now, let me say I,

00:07:17.932 --> 00:07:20.143
I take the whole stash
off your hands for free,

00:07:21.686 --> 00:07:23.411
and you a--holes can go to jail,

00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:24.744
what do you say about that?

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.571
Neil: Yeah, [laughs] OK.

00:07:27.571 --> 00:07:28.534
Yeah, that's a good way of

00:07:28.534 --> 00:07:29.870
trying to get you killed, I suppose.

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.933
There's an arrogance with him

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:33.740
that wouldn't really fit
with undercover work.

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.880
You are completely separate
from normal police work.

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.890
You don't have your
warrant card or your badge

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.320
or anything like that on you.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.510
You are, for all intents and purposes,

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.080
pretending to be someone else,

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.530
and you would be highly at risk

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:46.742
if you did have anything on you

00:07:46.742 --> 00:07:49.475
which could identify
you as a police officer.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.820
Police officer: The drug
itself is referred to as

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:00.970
pot, tea, boo, stuff.

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:01.803
Man: Dew.

00:08:01.803 --> 00:08:02.800
Police officer: Grass.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.810
Neil: I mean, "Serpico" is meant to

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.990
be based on a memoir, isn't it?

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.610
It's meant to actually
be based on a true story,

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:11.090
and it's about the sort of beginnings

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.470
of undercover work as a tactic.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.014
I still find it really
difficult to believe.

00:08:15.014 --> 00:08:16.210
I mean, maybe it's true,

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.600
but it just seems so bizarre, doesn't it?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:20.435
Handing out drugs at a briefing.

00:08:20.435 --> 00:08:23.030
For "Serpico," there are many scenes

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.690
which appear very unrealistic,

00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.230
but you have to remember the context

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.440
that it was the 1970s,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.590
fresh from Nixon's drug war.

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.440
For a major Hollywood
film, at least it dared

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.930
to look at the grimy underbelly of it.

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.880
The techniques were more about

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.383
how to avoid being in a situation

00:08:39.383 --> 00:08:42.233
where you would be forced to take drugs,

00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:43.940
and for heroin and
crack, that's quite easy,

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.530
because most of the
exchanges are done in places

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:49.430
where it wouldn't be so easy to do it.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:51.880
I could skin up, or I cook up heroin

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.088
in a syringe if I had to.

00:08:54.088 --> 00:08:56.810
I had to take some speed once,

00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.310
which was quite uncomfortable.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.349
Cannabis a few times, I
think maybe three times?

00:09:03.349 --> 00:09:06.280
Frank: An undercover cop
walks around in disguise,

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.980
wearing black shoes and white socks.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.860
Everybody knows who he is.

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.110
Neil: If you need to look
scruffy, you look scruffy.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.560
I used to play a traveling thief,

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.965
so I'd be in a full tracksuit
and Nike Air Max trainers.

00:09:18.965 --> 00:09:20.650
Other times I would wear clothes

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.690
that would make me look like

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.950
I was living partially in squats,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.000
you know, I would be really
struggling with life.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:30.905
Jason: Tie your shoe, tie your shoe,

00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:31.910
right now, tie your shoe.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:33.386
Man: Oh, s---.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:41.100
Neil: I think you'd need to have

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:42.920
superhuman powers like Jason Bourne

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.111
to actually avoid

00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:47.986
a full surveillance like that,

00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:49.520
because the people that I've worked with

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.540
who were very good at surveillance,

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.437
you've got very little chance
of getting away from them

00:09:53.437 --> 00:09:55.550
or spotting them, actually.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.383
Jason: Wait.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.503
Wait.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.680
Neil: I know it's a
visual aid in the film,

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.940
but it is rather ridiculous to actually

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.113
lift your lapel to talk to a microphone,

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.271
or even have an earpiece in
your ear with a wire actually.

00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:11.793
Why would you have that?

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.836
But of course it's
quite visual for a film.

00:10:14.836 --> 00:10:16.340
You have a microphone attached to you,

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:20.520
which is discrete, and you don't need to

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.660
speak into your wrist
or lapel or whatever.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.040
You just speak.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.440
Police or security services

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.480
who are good at surveillance,

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.055
they know where and when
to use the right codes.

00:10:35.090 --> 00:10:36.570
Felix: Eddie, I just
wanna ask you a question.

00:10:36.570 --> 00:10:37.653
Eddie: Yes, Felix.

00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:40.549
Felix: Stop it. You wouldn't f---ing

00:10:40.549 --> 00:10:41.707
think you were gonna
get away with this s---?

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:42.991
[screams]

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.250
Neil: You never break cover.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.450
The golden rule is you never show out.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.880
Going deeper undercover, or, rather,

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.450
wondering who you can trust.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.367
Very early on in my career I realized

00:10:57.367 --> 00:10:59.840
that I was at potentially
the greatest risk

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.240
from my colleagues,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:04.740
and most undercover work
is about the drug war.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.540
And the trouble is it's

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.910
half a trillion dollar industry worldwide,

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.760
and that inevitably causes corruption.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.710
I've come across that
corruption many times,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:15.985
and that's the thing that's always made me

00:11:15.985 --> 00:11:17.030
feel the most unsafe,

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.640
so the most unsettling
thing about undercover work

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.133
is not really knowing who you can trust.

00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:26.053
Felix: So, Johnny, what do you think?

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.868
Johnny: I think you made your point.

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.543
Jim: Let's see you roll.

00:11:37.828 --> 00:11:38.661
Kristen: OK.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.190
Neil: It's extremely far-fetched.

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:51.040
You don't go into undercover work

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.623
intending to take drugs.

00:11:53.623 --> 00:11:55.480
The vast majority of
times I've brought drugs

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.060
and someone said, "Go and do it, then,"

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.057
I would say, "I don't want to take it now.

00:11:59.057 --> 00:12:00.919
Why do you want me to take it now?"

00:12:00.919 --> 00:12:02.130
The training for undercover work

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.800
isn't actually about behaviors

00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.950
or about how to roll a spliff.

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:10.530
It's actually about
the law and the ethics;

00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:12.180
that's the training, really.

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.350
The rest you work out later.

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.588
Schmidt: Hey, my partner,
he wanna see the product.

00:12:21.588 --> 00:12:22.688
Gangster: Why isn't he talking?

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.203
Jenko: My name's Jeff.

00:12:28.203 --> 00:12:30.744
Schmidt: That's Jefe, man.

00:12:30.744 --> 00:12:32.840
Neil: That does seem a bit daft. I think,

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.465
any mistake that your partner makes,

00:12:34.465 --> 00:12:36.409
you're both implicated.

00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:38.380
You know, if there's a
suspicion on one of you,

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:39.900
then as soon as someone

00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:42.230
has the slightest bit
of suspicion about you,

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:45.230
they're looking for other
things to be suspicious about.

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:47.687
One of the first things they'll
do is look you up and down.

00:12:47.687 --> 00:12:49.450
They'll unconsciously do it,

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:51.750
and then they'll move on
to the verbal questioning.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.127
They'll usually ask something
like an open question, like,

00:12:55.127 --> 00:12:56.780
"Where did you say you're from again?"

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:59.810
You've got to put that
fire out very quickly.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:02.290
If there's two of you, they're
looking you up and down,

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.560
they're looking the other one up and down.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.570
They've got twice as much
information to work with

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:08.150
and become suspicious with.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.980
So they can become suspicious much quicker

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.414
if there's more than one of you.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:17.000
John: I'm John, and this is Trevor.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.950
Martin: John and Trevor, b------.

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.750
You're f---ing Old Bill, mate.

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.970
Neil: Your ultimate nightmare,
really, as an undercover,

00:13:31.970 --> 00:13:33.740
is someone going, locking the door

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.560
just after you've been challenged.

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:36.530
They're aggressive people;

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.980
he's responding in the appropriate way

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.105
in the right situation.

00:13:39.105 --> 00:13:40.820
And he's thinking on his feet,

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.670
and he's keeping the eye contact.

00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.750
I think it's a very realistic scene.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:47.337
It's exactly the kind of
challenge that you would get.

00:13:47.337 --> 00:13:48.857
"Who are you?"

00:13:48.857 --> 00:13:51.170
That's your classic first
challenge question, really.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.570
In fact, I was buying off

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:57.000
football hooligans, actually, in Darby,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:59.020
and they were that kind of people.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.570
Where I was pushed up against a wall,

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:02.860
said he was going to rip my head off

00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.457
and s--- down my neck.

00:14:04.457 --> 00:14:07.348
You know, and he was instantly violent,

00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:10.265
and the people around
him, 'cause we were, like,

00:14:10.265 --> 00:14:12.090
behind a pub in the outdoor area.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:13.260
They all responded really

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:15.250
quite interestingly, quite quickly.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.590
They were all instantly
part of the violence

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.440
that was about to go on,
you know, if there was any.

00:14:21.527 --> 00:14:24.177
But my response: "I'm sorry, mate.

00:14:24.177 --> 00:14:27.300
I wasn't meaning to tussle
you, you know, sorry."

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.775
And that meek, humble response
was the right way to go.

00:14:37.723 --> 00:14:39.573
Yeah, [laughs] OK.

00:14:39.573 --> 00:14:40.406
Yeah, that's a good way of

00:14:40.406 --> 00:14:41.439
trying to get you killed, I suppose.
