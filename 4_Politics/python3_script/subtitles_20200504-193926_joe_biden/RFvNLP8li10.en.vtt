&gt;&gt; Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY.

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.368 size:78% position:39%
WELCOME TO "A LATE SHOW."

00:00:02.401 --> 00:00:05.138
I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:08.341
JUST HEARING THE BAND DO THE
THEME SONG IS STRANGELY MOVING.

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
I FORGOT HOW MUCH I MISSED
HEARING THOSE GUYS!

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:14.513 align:start position:0%
IT'S HOW MANY DAYS?

00:00:14.546 --> 00:00:16.983 align:start position:0%
HOW MANY DAYS HAVE WE BEEN DOING
THIS?

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:18.151 align:start position:0%
40 DAYS.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:24.190
THIS IS THE 40th DAY THAT I
HAVE BEEN QUARANTINED WITH MY

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:25.324 align:start position:0%
WIFE AND KIDS.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:29.529 size:88% position:44%
I FEEL LIKE NOAH, BUT I ONLY
HAVE ONE DOG, AND HE'S ONLY

00:00:29.562 --> 00:00:30.797 align:start position:0%
INTERESTED IN MY LEG.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.633 align:start position:0%
WE ALL WANT HAIRCUTS AT THIS
POINT.

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.903 align:start position:0%
I DID SOMETHING DRASTIC TONIGHT,
I COMBED MY HAIR IN THE OTHER

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:44.744
DIRECTION JUST FOR A CHANGE OF
PACE AND THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.

00:00:44.777 --> 00:00:51.751 align:start position:0%
FIRST OF ALL, I'M GETTING A VERY
P ATRICIAN FLOP OVER HERE.

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:55.621 align:start position:0%
THIS THE VERY MID-'70s JACKSON
BROWN.

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:57.523 align:start position:0%
OVER HERE, THERE'S A LOT OF
EMPTY REAL ESTATE I DIDN'T KNOW

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:58.991 align:start position:0%
WAS THERE.

00:00:59.024 --> 00:01:01.494 align:start position:0%
THIS IS USUALLY COVERED BY THE
COMBOVER.

00:01:01.527 --> 00:01:05.531 align:start position:0%
WE SHOULD TALK TO THE NETWORK
AND SELL AD SPACE THERE.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:07.867 align:start position:0%
IT COULD SAY HONDA, MOUNTAIN DEW
OR V.W.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:15.975 size:88% position:44%
WHO'S THE SPONSOR RIGHT NOW?

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:16.709 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; CLARITIN.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:20.680 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: STAY CLARITIN
CLEAR!

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:25.952
BUT YOU'RE REALLY BEGINNING TO
FEEL IT, NOW, IN WEEK SEVEN OF

00:01:25.985 --> 00:01:26.853 size:78% position:39%
THIS NATIONWIDE LOCKDOWN.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:27.754 align:start position:0%
DON'T GET ME WRONG.

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:29.388 align:start position:0%
I WILL STAY INSIDE FOR AS LONG
AS IT TAKES.

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:31.757
I'M JUST SAYING, I DIDN'T KNOW I
WOULD RUN OUT OF PATIENCE BEFORE

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.694 size:81% position:41%
I RAN OUT OF TOILET PAPER.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:37.296 align:start position:0%
ONE OF THE MOST FRUSTRATING
ASPECTS OF THIS WHOLE LOCKDOWN

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.066 align:start position:0%
IS THAT THERE ISN'T ONE
CONSISTENT MESSAGE FROM OUR

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.534 align:start position:0%
LEADERSHIP.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:46.005
HOW COME I'M STILL GROUNDED AND
GEORGIA GETS TO GO OUT AND PLAY?

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:46.906 align:start position:0%
IT'S NOT FAIR!

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.978 align:start position:0%
WE BOTH MADE THE MISTAKE OF
BEING MORTAL!

00:01:52.011 --> 00:01:53.146 align:start position:0%
I'M SORRY!

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:54.013
ALSO, IT WOULD BE EASIER TO
AGREE ON WHAT TO DO IF WE ALL

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:57.183 align:start position:0%
KNEW HOW LONG WE WERE SUPPOSED
TO DO IT.

00:01:57.216 --> 00:01:58.351 align:start position:0%
ON FRIDAY, WE GOT WHAT APPEARED
TO BE GOOD NEWS FROM VICE

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:03.523 align:start position:0%
PRESIDENT PENCE:
&gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK AT THE TRENDS

00:02:03.556 --> 00:02:07.393
TODAY THAT-- I THINK BY MEMORIAL
DAY WEEKEND WE WILL LARGELY HAVE

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:14.367 align:start position:0%
THIS CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC BEHIND
US.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.368 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: GREAT.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.436 align:start position:0%
MEMORIAL DAY.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.106 align:start position:0%
PUT AWAY THE N-95 MASKS, BREAK
OUT THE N-95 BIKINIS.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:24.744
BUT YESTERDAY, THAT IDEA GOT
SHOT DOWN BY DR. DEBORAH BIRX:

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:28.514 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; SOCIAL DISTANCING WILL BE
WITH US THROUGH THE SUMMER.

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:29.181 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OF COURSE, SHE'S
GOING TO SAY THAT.

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:32.051
SHE'S ALWAYS DRESSED FOR FALL.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:34.754 align:start position:0%
THE QUARANTINES IS DRIVING
EVERYONE A LITTLE CRAZY, EXCEPT

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:37.657 align:start position:0%
DONALD TRUMP.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.358
IT'S DRIVING HIM A LOT CRAZY.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:39.492
TAKE THURSDAY'S PRESS BRIEFING.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
AFTER AN EXPERT FROM THE
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:44.964 align:start position:0%
TOLD THE MEDIA THAT
DISINFECTANTS AND SUNLIGHT WERE

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:48.467
VERY EFFECTIVE AGAINST THE VIRUS
ON SURFACES, TRUMP FLOATED THIS

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.873 align:start position:0%
POSSIBLE COVID CURE:
&gt;&gt; I SEE THE DISINFECTANT, WHERE

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:55.841
IT KNOCKS IT OUT IN A MINUTE.

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:56.909 align:start position:0%
ONE MINUTE.

00:02:56.942 --> 00:03:00.213 align:start position:0%
AND IS THERE A WAY WE CAN DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT, BY

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:03.082 align:start position:0%
INJECTION INSIDE OR-- OR ALMOST
A CLEANING.

00:03:03.115 --> 00:03:04.850
BECAUSE YOU SEE IT GETS IN THE
LUNGS, AND IT DOES A TREMENDOUS

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:05.751 align:start position:0%
NUMBER ON THE LUNGS.

00:03:05.784 --> 00:03:09.021 align:start position:0%
SO IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO
CHECK THAT.

00:03:09.054 --> 00:03:11.591 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: HE'S SUGGESTING
INJECTING BLEACH TO FIGHT

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:14.327 align:start position:0%
CORONAVIRUS.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.860 align:start position:0%
IT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT HIS
SUPPORTERS ARE ALL WHITE ON THE

00:03:14.893 --> 00:03:17.163 align:start position:0%
OUTSIDE.

00:03:17.196 --> 00:03:22.635 align:start position:0%
OBVIOUSLY, NO ONE SHOULD DO
THAT.

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:25.638
SO, THIS WEEKEND, PEOPLE DID IT.

00:03:25.671 --> 00:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
MULTIPLE STATES SAW AN UPTICK IN
CALLS TO POISON CONTROL, AND

00:03:27.072 --> 00:03:30.643 align:start position:0%
TRUMP'S COMMENTS WERE
UNIVERSALLY REVILED, SO ON

00:03:30.676 --> 00:03:32.578
FRIDAY, HE DID DAMAGE CONTROL.

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:34.614 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; MR. PRESIDENT, CAN YOU
CLARIFY YOUR COMMENTS ABOUT

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:37.350 size:84% position:42%
INJECTIONS OF DISINFECTANT?

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:38.718 size:88% position:44%
THEY'RE QUITE PROVOCATIVE--
&gt;&gt; I WAS ASKING THE QUESTION

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:42.021 align:start position:0%
SARCASTICALLY TO REPORTERS LIKE
YOU.

00:03:42.054 --> 00:03:43.189 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OH, YEAH, TRUMP IS
FAMOUS FOR HIS SARCASTIC

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:46.325 align:start position:0%
COMMENTS, LIKE THIS ONE:
&gt;&gt; PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND

00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:50.596 align:start position:0%
THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED
STATES.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.133 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: HILARIOUS.

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:55.334
TRUMP GOT SO MUCH HEAT FOR THE
COMMENT THAT HE THREATENED TO

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:59.005
STOP DOING PRESS BRIEFINGS AT
ALL, TWEETING, "WHAT IS THE

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:04.076 align:start position:0%
PURPOSE OF HAVING WHITE HOUSE
NEWS CONFERENCES WHEN THE

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.146
LAMESTREAM MEDIA ASKS NOTHING
BUT HOSTILE QUESTIONS, AND THEN

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:11.751 align:start position:0%
REFUSES TO REPORT THE TRUTH OR
FACTS ACCURATELY.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.252
THEY GET RECORD RATINGS, AND THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE GET NOTHING BUT

00:04:13.285 --> 00:04:17.056 align:start position:0%
FAKE NEWS.

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:20.593
NOT WORTH THE TIME AND EFFORT!"
YES, IT'S SO HOSTILE TO QUOTE

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:21.460 size:78% position:39%
THE PRESIDENT TO HIMSELF!

00:04:21.494 --> 00:04:24.263 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"LOOK, MY PRESS BRIEFINGS ARE

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:28.067 align:start position:0%
ALL SAID IN THE STRICTEST
CONFIDENCE.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.203
WHAT'S SAID DIRECTLY INTO A
CAMERA, STAYS DIRECTLY INTO A

00:04:31.236 --> 00:04:33.873 align:start position:0%
CAMERA."

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:36.509
HE DIDN'T SHOW UP FOR THE PRESS
BRIEFING YESTERDAY, ALTHOUGH,

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:39.645 align:start position:0%
THE WHITE HOUSE EXPLAINED THAT
IT WAS MELANIA'S BIRTHDAY.

00:04:39.678 --> 00:04:43.049 align:start position:0%
THEY CELEBRATED BY SPENDING A
QUIET EVENING IN SEPARATE ROOMS.

00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:47.386 size:84% position:42%
THEY WERE SOCIAL DISTANCING
YEARS BEFORE IT WAS COOL.

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.021 size:84% position:42%
TRUMP ALSO SCRAPPED TODAY'S
WHITE HOUSE PRESS BRIEFING,

00:04:49.054 --> 00:04:53.025 align:start position:0%
UNTIL IT WAS ANNOUNCED,
"PRESIDENT @REALDONALDTRUMP WILL

00:04:53.058 --> 00:04:58.230 align:start position:0%
BRIEF THE NATION DURING A PRESS
CONFERENCE THIS EVENING."

00:04:58.263 --> 00:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
WOW, THAT FLIPPED SO FAST, I GOT
WHIPLASH.

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:01.233 align:start position:0%
I'LL BE FINE.

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:04.070 align:start position:0%
I'LL INJECT SOME BLEACH INTO MY
SPINE.

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:07.206 align:start position:0%
BUT STRATEGICALLY, THIS IS A
GOOD MOVE.

00:05:07.239 --> 00:05:09.008
HE DOESN'T WANT LAST THURSDAY TO
BE THE FINAL IMPRESSION OF THESE

00:05:09.041 --> 00:05:13.646 align:start position:0%
BRIEFINGS.

00:05:13.679 --> 00:05:16.382 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"EVERYBODY DRINK POISON.

00:05:16.415 --> 00:05:22.388 align:start position:0%
DONNY T. OUT!"
TRUMP VENTED HIS FRUSTRATION AT

00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:28.194 align:start position:0%
THE MEDIA IN GENERAL:
"WHEN WILL ALL OF THE

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:32.698 align:start position:0%
'REPORTERS' WHO HAVE RECEIVED
'NOBLE' PRIZES FOR THEIR WORK ON

00:05:32.731 --> 00:05:34.867
RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, ONLY TO
HAVE BEEN PROVEN TOTALLY WRONG

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.372 align:start position:0%
BE TURNING BACK THEIR CHERISHED
'NOBLES'?

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:42.608 align:start position:0%
WHEN WILL THE 'NOBLE' COMMITTEE
DEMAND THE PRIZES BACK?

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:44.176 align:start position:0%
WHEN WILL THE 'NOBLE' COMMITTEE
ACT?

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:49.348 align:start position:0%
BETTER BE FAST!"
AH, YES, THE CHERISHED "NOBLE"

00:05:49.381 --> 00:05:52.184
PRIZE, GIVEN TO SUCH LAUREATES
AS ALBERT EINSTAIN AND MARTIN

00:05:52.217 --> 00:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
BURGER KING.

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:56.622
TRUMP CLEARLY MEANT THE "NOBEL"
PRIZE, EXCEPT THERE IS NO NOBEL

00:05:56.655 --> 00:06:00.192 align:start position:0%
PRIZE FOR JOURNALISM, WHICH
THE INTERNET HELPFULLY POINTED

00:06:00.225 --> 00:06:03.529 align:start position:0%
OUT.

00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:06.232 size:81% position:41%
SO TRUMP REVIVED HIS NEW
FAVORITE DEFENSE, TWEETING

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:10.403
"DOES ANYBODY GET THE MEANING OF
WHAT A SO-CALLED 'NOBLE'-- NOT

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:12.505
NOBEL-- PRIZE IS, ESPECIALLY
AS IT PERTAINS TO REPORTERS AND

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:15.908 align:start position:0%
JOURNALISTS?

00:06:15.941 --> 00:06:18.878
NOBLE IS DEFINED AS, 'HAVING OR
SHOWING FINE PERSONAL QUALITIES

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:22.448 align:start position:0%
OR HIGH MORAL PRINCIPLES
AND IDEALS.'

00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:26.285 align:start position:0%
DOES SARCASM EVER WORK?"
(SARCASTICALLY)

00:06:26.318 --> 00:06:27.486 size:88% position:44%
OH, SARCASM WORKS GREEEAAAT.

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:30.723
SARCASM'S ABSOLUTELY THE BEST
THING FOR A PRESIDENT TO DO IN

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:33.025 size:78% position:39%
THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC.

00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:38.964 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE DOING AMAZING,
MR. PRESIDENT.

00:06:38.997 --> 00:06:41.467 align:start position:0%
TRUMP MIGHT BE TRYING TO PUT A
HOLD ON HIS DAILY PRESS

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.335
CONFERENCES, BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN HE'S GIVEN UP ON HAVING AN

00:06:43.368 --> 00:06:48.541 align:start position:0%
AUDIENCE, BECAUSE IN JUNE, TRUMP
WILL TRAVEL TO WEST POINT TO

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:50.309 align:start position:0%
SPEAK AT THE U.S. MILITARY
ACADEMY GRADUATION.

00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:53.779 align:start position:0%
UNLESS HE COMES DOWN WITH THROAT
SPURS.

00:06:53.812 --> 00:06:55.013 align:start position:0%
THERE IS ONE CATCH.

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:58.350
LIKE MOST COLLEGES, WEST POINT
ALREADY SENT CADETS HOME BECAUSE

00:06:58.383 --> 00:06:59.919
OF CORONAVIRUS, AND NOW THEY
HAVE TO BRING BACK 1,000 CADETS

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:06.559 align:start position:0%
FOR TRUMP'S COMMENCEMENT
ADDRESS.

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:08.761 align:start position:0%
SURE, THAT'S HAZARDOUS.

00:07:08.794 --> 00:07:09.929 size:88% position:44%
BUT THOSE CADETS TRAINED TO
BRAVELY SERVE WHEREVER THEIR

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:12.598
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF SENDS THEM:
WHETHER IT'S IRAQ, SYRIA, OR

00:07:12.631 --> 00:07:13.832 align:start position:0%
EGO-SLAVIA.

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:18.437
KEEP IN MIND, TRUMP DIDN'T RUN
THIS SPEECH IDEA BY THE MILITARY

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.039 align:start position:0%
BRASS.

00:07:20.072 --> 00:07:22.074 align:start position:0%
"WEST POINT OFFICIALS SAID THEY
WERE TAKEN ABACK BY THE

00:07:22.107 --> 00:07:23.242 size:75% position:38%
IMPROMPTU ANNOUNCEMENT."

00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:25.978 align:start position:0%
MAKING TRUMP THE FIRST COMMANDER
IN CHIEF TO LAUNCH A SNEAK

00:07:26.011 --> 00:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
ATTACK ON HIS OWN ARMY.

00:07:27.112 --> 00:07:30.382 size:88% position:44%
GETTING THE CADETS BACK TO
CAMPUS SAFELY WON'T BE EASY.

00:07:30.415 --> 00:07:32.818
RETURNING SENIORS WILL BE TESTED
OFF-CAMPUS FOR THE CORONAVIRUS.

00:07:32.851 --> 00:07:36.989 size:88% position:44%
THOSE WHO TEST NEGATIVE WILL
THEN BE SENT TO THE SCHOOL,

00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:42.394 align:start position:0%
WHERE THEY WILL BE MONITORED FOR
14 DAYS BEFORE GRADUATION.

00:07:42.427 --> 00:07:46.398 size:78% position:39%
THAT'S A LOT OF BUILD-UP.

00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:47.299 size:88% position:44%
IT BETTER BE A GREAT SPEECH.

00:07:47.332 --> 00:07:52.371 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"CONGRATULATIONS, CLASS OF 2020.

00:07:52.404 --> 00:07:56.375
AS YOU EMBARK ON YOUR JOURNEY,
REMEMBER: ONE TIME, NO ONE SAID

00:07:56.408 --> 00:07:58.377 align:start position:0%
I COULD WIN, BUT AFTER I WON
WISCONSIN IT LOOKED PRETTY GOOD.

ONCE THEY'RE ASSEMBLED, WHO
KNOWS HOW SAFE THE CADETS WILL

00:08:09.054 --> 00:08:11.991 align:start position:0%
ACTUALLY BE, BECAUSE TRUMP
TOLD REPORTERS HE DID NOT LIKE

00:08:20.198 --> 00:08:22.468
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO BOUNCE A

CADETS, PUT ON YOUR DRESS

00:08:27.739 --> 00:08:30.442 align:start position:0%
TRUMP'S NOT THE ONLY DANGER TO
OUR MILITARY.

00:08:30.475 --> 00:08:31.810 align:start position:0%
SO IS NORTH KOREA.

00:08:31.843 --> 00:08:34.446
AND THERE'S A MYSTERY BREWING
ABOUT NORTH KOREAN DICTATOR AND

00:08:34.479 --> 00:08:38.150 align:start position:0%
MAN THEY MODELED LEGO HEADS
AFTER, KIM JONG-UN.

00:08:38.183 --> 00:08:40.953 align:start position:0%
TRUMP'S LITTLE ROCKET BUDDY
HASN'T BEEN SEEN IN PUBLIC FOR

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:44.657
WEEKS, AND RUMORS STARTED FLYING
WHEN HE FAILED TO MAKE A PUBLIC

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:47.660 align:start position:0%
APPEARANCE ON APRIL 15, WHICH IS
NORTH KOREA'S MOST IMPORTANT

THE REGIME, KIM IL-SUNG.

00:08:52.998 --> 00:08:54.800
YOU CAN'T BLAME HIM FOR SOCIALLY
DISTANCING FROM HIS GRANDFATHER.

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:58.470
HE'S IN THAT GROUP OF ESPECIALLY
VULNERABLE PEOPLE: DEAD FOR 26

YEARS.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.508 size:75% position:38%
SO WHERE IS KIM JONG-UN?

00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:05.411 align:start position:0%
NOBODY KNOWS.

00:09:05.444 --> 00:09:08.047
LAST WEEK, SOUTH KOREAN MEDIA
REPORTED THAT KIM MAY HAVE

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.449 align:start position:0%
UNDERGONE CARDIOVASCULAR
SURGERY.

00:09:10.482 --> 00:09:13.052 align:start position:0%
WHAT?

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:14.186
BUT HE'S SO YOUNG AND VIBRANT!

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:18.524 align:start position:0%
LOOK AT HIM LAUGHING WITH HIS
BEST FRIEND, VAT OF LUBE.

00:09:18.557 --> 00:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
A SOUTH KOREAN OFFICIAL CLAIMS
THE RUMORS ARE "UN"-TRUE.

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:24.363 align:start position:0%
INSTEAD, "KIM JONG-UN IS ALIVE
AND WELL.

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:26.532 align:start position:0%
HE HAS BEEN STAYING IN THE
WANSAN AREA."

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:28.867 align:start position:0%
YES.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.771
I REMEMBER HOW SAD MY KIDS WERE
WHEN OUR DOG RUSTY HAD TO GO

00:09:32.804 --> 00:09:34.239 size:81% position:41%
"STAY IN THE WANSAN AREA."

00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:37.009 align:start position:0%
BUT THAT HASN'T STOPPED PEOPLE
FROM WILDLY SPECULATING.

00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:42.147 align:start position:0%
IT'S BEING REPORTED THAT KIM
JONG-UN IS EITHER IN A

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.750
"VEGETATIVE STATE," ALIVE AND
WELL, DEAD, BRAIN-DEAD OR JUST

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:46.518 align:start position:0%
FINE.

00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:49.054 align:start position:0%
HEADLINES SHOULDN'T BE MULTIPLE
CHOICE.

00:09:49.087 --> 00:09:53.459
THERE'S A REASON WE NEVER SAW
"WAR! OR, YOU KNOW, PEACE."

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:56.428 align:start position:0%
OF COURSE, NOBODY KNOWS WHAT'S
REALLY GOING ON.

00:09:56.461 --> 00:10:00.532
AND IT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE OF
ME TO SPECULATE THAT KIM JONG-UN

00:10:00.565 --> 00:10:02.568 align:start position:0%
IS ALIVE OR DEAD OR, AFTER A
TRAGIC ACCIDENT AT A LUBE

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:06.538 align:start position:0%
FACTORY, IS NOW JUST A HEAD IN A
JAR.

00:10:06.571 --> 00:10:08.807
WHICH, I SHOULD NOT SPECULATE,
IN A GROTESQUE EXPERIMENT, HAS

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.743 size:88% position:44%
BEEN STITCHED TO THE BODY OF
A BEAR, WHICH NOW ROAMS THE

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:14.146
FORESTS SEARCHING FOR MORE LUBE.

00:10:14.179 --> 00:10:17.449
NEITHER MAN NOR BEAST, YEARNING
FOR A LOVE HE WILL NEVER FEEL.

00:10:17.482 --> 00:10:17.950 align:start position:0%
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:18.617 align:start position:0%
OR IS IT?

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.452 align:start position:0%
IT'S NOT.

00:10:20.485 --> 00:10:20.952 align:start position:0%
BUT IT COULD BE.

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:25.324 align:start position:0%
HE'S PROBABLY FINE.

00:10:25.357 --> 00:10:27.126 align:start position:0%
LIKE I SAID EARLIER, QUARANTINE
CONTINUES FOR MOST PEOPLE.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:31.997 align:start position:0%
YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED, SINCE
YOU ARE ONE.

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:34.600
