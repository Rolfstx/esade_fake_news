00:00:12.758 --> 00:00:14.350
Claudia Romeo: OlÃ¡ from Portugal!

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.770
We are in Matosinhos, a town nearby Porto.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.330
We are at Conservas Pinhais,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.988
which is one of the

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:26.321
oldest preserving
factories here in Portugal

00:00:26.321 --> 00:00:29.575
and one of the few that
still cans sardines

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:32.065
the traditional, artisanal way.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.480
Today we're going to
learn how this small fish

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.810
got such a big cult following.

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.920
We're going to see how sardines are canned

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.730
here at Pinhais and
taste a few to understand

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.605
what sets this artisanal method apart.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.030
If you travel to Portugal,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:54.750
chances are you will come back home

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.790
with an array of souvenirs
in the shape of sardines.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.160
And during the country's
festivities in June,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.903
13 sardines are eaten every second.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.120
The country has a long
fish-canning tradition,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.810
to the point that the sardine

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.601
has become a national icon.

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:11.492
But why?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.300
Claudia: Canning itself did
not originate in Portugal.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.130
It was a French
confectioner, Nicolas Appert,

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.400
who first successfully
preserved foods with the method.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.210
He found his way to
fame in the early 1800s

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.035
after presenting his inventions

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:42.701
to French emperor Napoleon,

00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:45.070
who was looking for a new
food-preserving method

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.330
to feed his army.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.890
After Appert's discovery was made public,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.980
canning quickly became popular.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.050
With Portugal's extensive coastline

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.610
and an abundance of fish,

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.260
it wasn't hard for the
country to jump on the trend,

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.368
and by 1925 it counted
about 400 canneries.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.600
Claudia: An important
fishing port already,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.641
Matosinhos became a hub
for the canning industry.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.020
Claudia: After the war, the
industry gradually declined.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.361
In 2013, Portugal counted

00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:57.800
only 20 fish-preserving factories.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.420
Many factors contributed to this decline.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.550
The replacement of
high-quality ingredients

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.380
with cheaper raw material, climate change,

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:08.020
fishing regulations due
to diminishing stock,

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.163
and the automation of the canning process.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.610
Founded in 1920, Pinhais
is one of Portugal's

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.010
last surviving preserving factories.

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.890
Claudia: Pinhais makes four
types of canned sardines:

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.270
sardines in olive oil,
sardines in tomato sauce,

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.250
spiced sardines in olive oil,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.770
and sardines in spiced tomato sauce.

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:21.800
We followed the making of
sardines in tomato sauce

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.833
and the spiced sardines in olive oil.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.150
These are the fresh sardines

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.750
that have arrived this morning
from Matosinhos harbor,

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.480
and the canning process
will take place in one day,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.220
so everything is gonna be finished

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.840
by 5 p.m. this afternoon.

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.280
All the sardines are gonna be tinned.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.550
Now it's time to go and see

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.303
how sardines are actually
canned here at Pinhais.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.270
After the sardines arrive at the factory,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.983
they are placed on a marble table,

00:04:49.983 --> 00:04:52.916
and the head and bowel of
the fish are cut off by hand.

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.274
Then they are brined
for about half an hour.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.090
The sardines are placed
on grids that are handmade

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.232
by Senhor Albino in his
workshop at the factory.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.242
Then the sardines are rinsed
to remove salt and steamed.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.320
Claudia: All the ingredients
are cut during the day

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.583
and added by hand, one by one.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.160
Each can of spiced sardines
has one pinch of black pepper,

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.913
carrot, laurel, piri-piri,
clove, and cucumber.

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.360
Senhora Emilia is in
charge of the tomato sauce,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.027
and she keeps her recipe secret.

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:39.810
The fish are canned in tinplate tins,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.623
then washed and sterilized.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.470
These are the only two
machines at the factory.

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.500
These two ladies are in
charge of quality control.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.320
They do that by listening carefully

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.640
to the sound of each tin.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.511
This is the sound of a good tin.

00:06:58.511 --> 00:06:59.690
[tins clanking]

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:01.451
And this is a bad one.

00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:03.150
[tins clanking]

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.280
Tins are stored for at
least three to six months.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.340
Whenever a customer submits an order,

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.308
the cans are wrapped by hand.

00:07:10.308 --> 00:07:12.540
Which, by the way, is not an easy job,

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.731
as I had the chance to wrap a can myself.

00:07:16.344 --> 00:07:17.594
So, this one?

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.614
Employee: You've got more than one there.

00:07:24.981 --> 00:07:26.381
First on the bottom.

00:07:28.357 --> 00:07:30.492
Claudia: Oh, it's very slippery.

00:07:31.967 --> 00:07:34.014
Employee: With this hand
and with this finger.

00:07:34.014 --> 00:07:36.264
[laughing]

00:07:41.168 --> 00:07:43.385
Claudia: Too much tape. A bit big, no?

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.166
Yeah, it's hard.

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:52.480
Obrigada.

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.990
So, we have finished our
tour here at Pinhais,

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:59.660
and now it's time for tasting.

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:02.230
We have sardines in tomato sauce

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:06.410
and sardines in spiced olive oil.

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.690
This is actually my very,
very, very first time

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:11.720
eating sardines out of a can.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:14.773
Now it's sardines-in-tomato-sauce time.

00:08:14.773 --> 00:08:16.590
I'm not good at opening cans.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.680
This particular can was made in 2015.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.770
It's four years ago.

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:22.483
Well, let's have a sardine.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:26.000
Oh, it's so good.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.640
[laughing]

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.633
Wow.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.035
Wow, this is so good.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.030
It's really amazing.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:36.000
It tastes as sweet as tomatoes,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.780
and the oil is incredible.

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:42.408
Just by this one bite I can
tell that it's good oil.

00:08:42.408 --> 00:08:43.970
I have a bad memory of canned stuff

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.669
because I'm really scared of, like,

00:08:45.669 --> 00:08:48.827
the strong taste of vinegar

00:08:48.827 --> 00:08:51.470
or, like, very, very bad vegetable oil.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.250
Whereas this is so fresh; it's so nice.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.416
It reminds me of just, like,

00:08:55.416 --> 00:08:57.141
my grandmother cooking tomato sauce.

00:08:57.141 --> 00:08:59.740
She could have just, you
know, done it this morning

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:02.473
and this would be my lunch. Like, so good.

00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:05.190
[laughs]

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.270
OK, well, let's try the spiced.

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.785
I'm not big fan of spices.

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:12.540
So. [laughs]

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:15.253
Let's see if this is
going to change my mind.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:21.040
It's not the spice that I was expecting.

00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:23.360
This one is a very subtle spice,

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.550
and also it tastes very, like, earthy.

00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.400
I can taste the laurel straight away,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.380
and that is interesting

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:32.930
because that's, like,
very, very, very tiny part.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.081
Why haven't I been eating
sardines all this time?

00:09:36.081 --> 00:09:37.780
[laughs]
It's so good.

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:40.283
Canning them, I think,
makes them even better.

00:09:41.463 --> 00:09:45.420
Pinhais exports 90% of its
products all over the globe,

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.920
from Austria to the Caribbean.
