00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.460
Bread has been a staple on the
human diet for thousands of years.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.600
But for the last few decades,
modern diets have villainized the baked

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.440
good. And bread has been taking
a hit over the years.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.390
Total U.S. sales have been stagnant
since 2015, showing little to no

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.920
growth leading up to 2020.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.390
And on average, Americans spent less money
on bread in 2017 than they did

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.650
just four years earlier.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.400
Not to mention the fact that
some of the country's biggest bread

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.810
manufacturers are complaining about the rising
costs of key ingredients in

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.990
an industry where small players battle
low margins and excess capacity.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.190
The bread business has to consolidate Sara
Lee and Wonderbread, two of the

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.210
biggest names in bread.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.020
Both were bought out by publicly traded
flour foods in 2012 and 2013,

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.870
respectively. And another big
problem for bread.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.930
It's facing increased scrutiny for
some of its extra ingredients.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.560
Things like chemical dough conditioner's,
preservatives, added sugar and

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.690
GMO's. Those additives helped manufacturers produce
a loaf in less time,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.250
prolong a shelf life and
keep the bread soft.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.410
But bread is making a comeback.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.090
Well, specifically, this preservative
free artisan, tangy flavored

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.230
sourdough bread sourdough was made with
just two ingredients, whereas a

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.330
loaf of Wonderbread has
over 20 ingredients.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.230
Another big difference sourdough can take up
to seven days to make from

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.230
scratch versus just a few
hours to make commercial bread.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.210
There's also a price difference.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.370
From 2015 to 2019.

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.920
sourdough bread sales have
seen significant growth.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.780
Sourdough is also growing more popular at
restaurants in 2019, it was on

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.270
14.3 percent of restaurant
menus, up from 11.6

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.800
percent ten years earlier. Even DIYers
are getting in on the sourdough

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.700
craze. Now sending days baking bread
is the cool thing to do.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.750
Instagram is full of DIY self-taught
bakers making their own sourdough.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.320
Even coders out in Silicon Valley
are blogging about the fermentation

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.910
graphs of their sourdough starters.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.660
And perhaps most importantly, health
evangelists are praising the benefits

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.680
of adding sourdough bread
into your diet.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.870
Between sourdough is almost cult like following
on social media and a more

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.380
health focused consumer base looking for
better food options; s ourdough

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.820
bread is more popular than ever.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.230
According to a survey, almost nine out
of 10 people know about sourdough

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.480
and another seven out of
10 have tried it.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.520
In the U.S. alone, sourdough is
a multibillion dollar market between 2014

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.160
and 2018. Sourdough's market value
in America jumped from 229.7

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.670
million dollars to 2.4

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.010
billion dollars. The question now?

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.530
Is the sourdough market
destined to keep rising?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.200
Or is it just another
fad destined to fade away?

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.450
Sourdough was made with just two
basic ingredients flour and water.

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.080
You mix them together. Leave it at
room temperature over time and feed the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.180
same amount of flour and
water for a few days.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.650
That m ixture when exposed to the
elements eventually starts to bubble and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.350
that bubbling is actually a
chemical change called fermentation.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.680
What's happening is that microbes
from the surrounding environment are

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.980
essentially colonizing the dough t
hen growing and dividing.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.670
Basically turning it into a medley
of flour, water, bacteria and wild

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.830
yeast, which is a
single celled fungi.

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.830
The bubbling mixture is called a sourdough
starter, and you could think of

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.690
it as a living thing. All that
bacteria is generating lactic acid and the

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.030
yeast is actively feeding
off starches in flour.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.480
It pumps the resulting carbon dioxide
and ethanol into the dough.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.890
The carbon dioxide expands the gluten network
in the dough, while the acid

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.230
in alcohol is what gives
sourdough its sour taste.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.950
It also digests this gluten network and
allows the enzymes present in the

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.520
flour to do their job, like cutting
the starches into edible pieces of

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.720
sugar for the yeast.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.650
Though sourdough, whose origin story has
been contested over the years,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.430
the first written record of sourdough
dates back around 4000 B.C.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.510
in ancient Egypt.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:52.150
The first written evidence on
sourdough is from the pyramids,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.080
and there are hieroglyphs showing people making
beer and bread in the same

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.020
hieroglyphs. So this
is crossover fermentation.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.400
The sourdough starter was discovered when a
mixture of flour and water was

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.960
exposed to the elements over time.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.800
The mixture began to bubble and rise,
a process we now know is called

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.280
fermentation. Rather than throw out
the odd smelling and expanding

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.940
mixture. The mystery cook
decided a baker anyway.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.120
The result? A large round, spongy loaf
of bread that we now call

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.470
sourdough. Since ancient Egypt, this method
of bread making was passed

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.340
down from civilization to civilization,
from ancient Rome to ancient

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.040
Greece all the way to
the American Yukon gold rush.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.640
Using a sourdough starter was pretty much
the only way of making bread for

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.660
thousands of years.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.990
But things started to change for sourdough
during the later half of the

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.220
19th century. Now, as the population kind
of changed and we went towards

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.380
cities, we always had to feed a
population on an industrialized scale, so

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.400
we had the creation of
an industrialized bread system.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.880
It wasn't until the mid 19th century
that scientists caught on to the

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.400
microbiology behind what
makes bread rise.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.570
Once they knew about wild yeast and how
it works, a race set off to figure

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.490
out how to make it
available to the masses.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.500
Brothers Charles and Maximilian Fleischmann were
one of the first to bring

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.530
commercial use to the market on a
large scale when they unveiled their

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.340
product to 10 million people at
the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:20.450
1876.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.830
The only problem it was perishable and would
go bad after two weeks in the

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:28.580
fridge. It wasn't until World War II
that the bread business was totally

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.610
revolutionized. As the wall came
in, we readily the American

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.090
side. They contacted the Fleischmann brothers,
who were the people who

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.350
originally discovered that you could
turn yeast into a tablet.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.560
And in the 1940s, the push
was produced fast bread for

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.430
soldiers. The Fleischmann Company improved
on its original yeast product

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.740
by creating the first
ever active dry yeast.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.280
It didn't require refrigeration and could
be easily activated with warm

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.490
water. Fleischman's active dry yeast was
a game changer to the commercial

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.660
bread business as well.

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.740
After the war ended, active drug use
was brought to the retail market and

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:11.490
the mass production of bread in the US
took off, which was bad news for

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.080
the slow-bake sourdough bread.

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.020
Out went the use of sourdough starters in
came in what we see today, large

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.990
commercial bakeries filling grocery stores
with ready made pre sliced

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:23.570
bread wrapped in cellophane that
could last for weeks.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.310
By 1944, 85 percent of the bread that
was made in the United States came

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.160
from large commercial bakeries, according to
a survey conducted at that

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.140
time. From the 1950s up through
today, bread companies have continued to

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.320
add extra ingredients to its products in
order to make bread faster than

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.150
ever and to prolong its shelf life.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.720
But the same chemical additives
that helped industrialize spread quickly

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.080
and cheaply brought on a laundry
list of health concerns for shoppers.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:56.220
Well, why not post World War II
anymore, We're in a very, very different

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.420
situation.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.690
And so this very fast
plastic kind of bread,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:10.590
which was really, I guess done out
to the well-meaning sort of aim, is

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.680
actually causing issues across the
globe with people's health, wellness,

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:23.100
blood sugar management, calorific management
and the amount of

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.200
nutrition they get from
their base food.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.060
2000 was the year of peak
grain when the average American 137.6

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:35.450
pounds of grain in a year, mostly in
the form of breads and other baked

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:40.990
goods. According to the USDA, per
capita consumption of flour was 146

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:42.820
pounds per person in 2000.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.250
In 2018, it had fallen to 132 pounds.

00:07:46.730 --> 00:07:48.230
It's all been downhill from there.

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.770
The timing dovetails with the rise of low
fat and low carb diets in the

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.240
90s and early 2000s.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.900
This decline has also come as more
and more Americans are diagnosed with

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.950
an allergy to gluten.

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.850
Remember gluten? It's the protein that plays
a key role in helping dough

00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.300
to rise. The number of Americans
following the gluten free diet triple

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.710
from 2013 to 2018, according to
Sundale Research and gluten free products

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.150
appear to be virtually everywhere.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.650
Nearly 30 percent consumers are now
buying foods with gluten free labels,

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.540
and sales of gluten free foods reach
17 billion dollars in 2018, more than

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.310
double the amount spent in 2011.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.150
All this may seem like a
doomsday scenario for sourdough bread, but

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:29.210
sourdough is actually proving to be one
option for bread lovers who want

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:32.570
to eat the real thing without facing
nearly as many side effects as its

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.740
commercial bread rivals.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.270
So why is that? sourdough is
typically more nutritious than regular bread.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.260
It's easier to digest and is a
potential better option for blood sugar

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:46.790
control. The reason it all comes down
to the active drugs versus sourdough

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.600
starter. What makes the sourdough starter
so special are all the

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.210
micro-organisms derived from
the fermentation process.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.250
Commercial bread misses out on that.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.520
It uses an active dry yeast
which simulates the chemical process that

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.970
makes bread rise. However, it lacks
the naturally occurring fungi and

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.830
bacteria that sourdough bread has.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:08.630
Here's why that matters. Sourdough slow
fermentation process makes a lot

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.970
easier for our bodies
to absorb important nutrients.

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:15.230
All of those micro-organisms and
sourdough also promote gut metabolic

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:18.800
health. Sourdough also doesn't lead to
blood sugar spikes and crashes.

00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.980
It actually slows down the speed at
which glucose is released into the

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.310
bloodstream, which is a great thing for
diabetics who have to watch their

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.640
insulin levels. Sourdough has another
big thing going for it.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:31.820
Store-bought bread has been put under
intense scrutiny for the extra

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:35.000
ingredients manufacturers add in order
to extend shelf life.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:38.810
These include everything from extra
gluten, fat, reducing agents,

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.000
emulsifiers enzymes
and preservatives.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.990
Some U.S. commercial breads, along with a
lot of other foods found in

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.170
grocery stores, were slammed for using
the same chemical ingredient found

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:53.990
in yoga mats. When I first
discovered making sourdough bread, I realized

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.080
even the best bread I was
giving my family wasn't real bread.

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:02.900
It had 38 ingredients in it and
should just be flour, water, salt and

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:08.240
yeast. And I make a lot of it
and we eat a lot of it.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.150
And we're not getting fat from it
and we're not getting sick from it.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:15.290
And my friends that have thought they
had gluten issues had no problem

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:20.210
with it. And it wasn't that it was
gluten, it was that we were eating

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.610
chemicals and fake processed food.

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:25.910
Sourdough's surge in popularity isn't
just linked to health conscious

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.330
consumers. It's actually developed a cult
like following on social media

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:32.420
and has drawn attention from a
new wave of DIY bakers.

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:38.930
In 2019, one of the founders
of Microsoft's Xbox, Seamus Blackley,

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.950
resurrected a sourdough starter dating back
over 4000 years to ancient

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:46.760
Egypt. Blackley used dormant yeast
and bacteria from ancient Egyptian

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.120
pots. He mixed those samples with
the sourdough starter he made, creating

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.900
this sourdough loaf with its origins
dating back to ancient Egypt.

00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:57.560
Blackley isn't alone in his affinity
for delving into the science behind

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.950
sourdough. Silicon Valley coders are
charting out their fermentation of

00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:04.130
their starter cultures to try to understand
the inner workings of all of

00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:08.120
its microbes. Since sourdough starters
all contain living microorganisms,

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:10.700
it requires constant attention,
like all living things.

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.600
If a startup is probably taking care of
it can last for years, decades and

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.770
sometimes generations.

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:20.820
N one of us has something that is
old, you know, if you have something

00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.180
that's a hundred years old, it's
almost certainly an heirloom that was

00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.050
given to you. It's a set of
earrings that came from your great grandmother

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:32.020
or some vase that came from the old
country but it's not something alive .

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.760
Imagine having something alive that's
a hundred years old.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:40.080
So the stories that come with
starters, I think are valuable.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:43.770
I think part of
recapturing of culture.

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:46.620
Maintaining your own sourdough starter
isn't an easy business.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.980
It requires constant feeding to ensure that
the same starter can be used

00:11:50.010 --> 00:11:52.890
over and over again. Feeding
a starter looks like this.

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:56.220
It's just simply adding a little bit
of flour and water to the mixture.

00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:59.710
And over time, it becomes like taking
care of a new family pet.

00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:01.200
There's a whole schedule.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:04.200
It's like a pet. It's like, you know,
you don't just get a goldfish and

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.760
then leave town for three months.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.730
It's like you need
to feed this thing.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.250
Like this is this is mine right here.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.740
And this is one of two.

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.760
And when I take off, I'm
you know, I'm a comedian.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.470
When I'm on the road, I'm constantly
thinking, like, who's going to feed

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:26.880
it? That's where unique sourdough
business like Matias Jakobsen's comes

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.430
into play. Jakobsen has been baking
sourdough for nearly eight years, and

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:35.160
for five years Jakobsen has been
operating The Sourdough Inn in Brooklyn.

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:38.570
He takes care of people starters
while they're on vacation, feeding them

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:40.620
with flour and water a
few times a week.

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.850
The questions I ask as part of the
check-in process, like I want to know

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:48.080
how how they currently feed it.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.040
And, you know, just so I understand
what they're trying to do with it.

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:57.180
So they told me like they would prefer
to just feed it, you know, around

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.510
every five days and generally
keep it in the fridge.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:05.850
And this one is a very, very low
maintenance in terms of what it means

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:12.360
generally that the sourdoughs have had had
not been any kind of peculiar

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:17.940
requests. And then other than that, I
think it's like meeting as people

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.370
that are passionate about something.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:24.680
So I always ask about people, you
know, how they started making sourdough

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.460
and why. According to his website, Jakobsen
charges $15 per week for hotel

00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:33.240
services and also runs a training
and rehabilitation service that revives

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.470
a starter for about $60 per session.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.250
The idea for sourdough Hotel in
Brooklyn actually originated from a

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:41.430
sourdough hotel that
started in Sweden.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:47.670
There is a sourdough hotel in
Stockholm and Scandinavia has a generally

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.590
advanced bread culture.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.670
So in Stockholm, obviously there was
this sourdough Hotel and they were

00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:58.380
teasing and well, because you bake bread Matias,
you need to be the one to

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:01.410
start a Brooklyn sourdough hotel.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.920
You really you really need
to do that in Sweden.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:07.030
Some bakers could bring
their starters to R.C.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.730
Chocolat. It's a bakery based in
Stockholm that charges their guests 100

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.790
Swedish krona or roughly $10 per week
for each of their starters as of

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.410
February 19th 2020.

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.790
And about a 1,000 miles southwest of
Stockholm, there is another place for

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:23.790
several starters are looked after
and handled with extreme care.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.820
And it's in the world's
only sourdough starter library.

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:29.820
The collection last week was 115.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.190
But now we have up to 125.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:34.440
So I will.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:42.640
So these are the fridges and they
are filled w ith the different

00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.640
s ourdoughs. This is Karl De Smedt .

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:49.530
He's the head baker of Puratos and
he runs the first and only sourdough

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:54.610
starter library. And then here
we have number 43,

00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:00.670
which was actually my very first sour
do I saw in my life.

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.760
Back in 2013, the company Puratos
launch its sourdough Library in Saint

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.170
Vith, Belgium. The library develops,
researches and preserves the

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:11.870
biodiversity of different sourdough
starters for the future.

00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:16.280
And while they're just 125 starters in
the library's walls, there are over

00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:19.850
1,600 starters registered in the company's
digital library from all around

00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:23.660
the world. Each new starter that arrives to
the library is sent to a lab

00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:27.800
for analysis, a process that can cost
anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 dollars

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:29.450
to analyze a single starter.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.880
So every sourdough that we get into
the library is sent to a university

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.110
with whom we work together.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.180
That can be in Italy
and France and Spain.

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:44.210
And there the sourdough is actually placed
on petri dishes and then they

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.290
grow the cultures.

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:49.520
And as such, it takes about three
months, forty five working days on

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:55.700
average. You can select the different
colonies on these petri dishes and

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:57.740
grow and grow and grow them further.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:04.250
Then we we are actually taking
all these different microorganisms and we

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:10.580
have these little test tubes where we
sort of isolated strain is put in

00:16:10.580 --> 00:16:13.640
there and that can be a
yeast or lactic acid bacteria.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:18.440
And as such, the sourdough strains
are preserved for the future.

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:21.980
In the library, there are some
starters that date back centuries.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:27.570
The baker who gave me it is said that
it must be from 1886, more or less.

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:33.290
Then we have this one,
which is number one hundred.

00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.730
That's a sourdough that we have from
a bakery in the centre of Tokyo.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:42.080
And that was a sourdough that
has been developed by Mr.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:46.520
Kimura, and he was one of the
last samurai, and he converted himself into

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:51.170
a baker, and one of his friends was
making saké based on rice, and so he

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:53.310
converted his sourdough into rice.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:57.350
And so this is now the only rice
sourdough we have in the library and it

00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:59.290
dates back to 1875.

00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:05.240
And then this one is
from Ioane Christensen in Whitehall's.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:11.660
And she was the first mayor
of Whitehall's and senator of Yukon.

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:18.230
And this sourdough dates back to
1896 when her great grandfather was

00:17:18.590 --> 00:17:21.110
participating in the
Klondike Goldrush.

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:27.050
So why spend thousands just to
analyze starters several decades old, Karl

00:17:27.070 --> 00:17:29.680
says the research that they're providing
actually helps the bakers of

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:30.820
today and the future.

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:35.140
Through DNA analysis, t
hey are identified.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:41.530
And as such, we have discovered now
more than 900, 950 different strains

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:47.950
already from two from six genus of
yeast and six genus of lactic

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:53.500
acid bacteria. Since its discovery, sourdough
has been a key fixture

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.720
across different cultures and
countries around the world.

00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:01.060
Bread has been a staple food for the
last 5000 years and it will probably

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:07.450
be the staple food for the next
5000 years, maybe more, because it

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:12.250
is a fantastic product that can be set
in the middle of the table and

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.110
unite all the good things.

00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.010
Sourdough has survived the invention of
commercial, active, dry east, no

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.130
carb diets, and some analysts say sourdough
has a lot more room for

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:24.940
growth. But with the rise of sourdough,
so too comes the rise of

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.970
"sourfaux" bread.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:29.770
Sourfaux is a term used for retail
bread that claims to be traditional

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:33.880
sourdough, but in fact sourfaux has
the same commercial use additives and

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.340
flavoring as a cellphone
wrapped in retail bread.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.770
As impostors flood the market, some worry
it would be bad for sourdough

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.940
street cred as a locally produced
artisanal premium product offering a

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.010
healthy alternative to
commercial rivals.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.570
But sourdough experts like Tom
Papa aren't too worried.

00:18:50.930 --> 00:18:54.200
The reason why we're the first generation
that has all of these issues,

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:56.660
we're heavier than ever before.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.030
We're being told that
you can't eat bread.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:01.670
You're being told that all
this stuff makes you sick.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.860
It's not the case.

00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.630
The cases that four in my lifetime we've
been eating a lot of things that

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:11.810
we're not food. They
were food adjacent.

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.200
So I really think that processes
like this, like making sourdough bread

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:23.210
and making things, making real food is
just going to get bigger and

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.870
stronger.
