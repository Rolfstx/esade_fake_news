We're gonna talk about

00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:08.808
specifically, one increasingly
influential member of it,

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.042
Alex Jones,

And I know you may be thinking,

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:18.251
there is nothing more I need
to know about Alex Jones.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.787

that is not happening,
just imagine how upset

00:00:49.382 --> 00:00:51.985
he's gonna be when he finds out
about one that is actually is.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.152
Like the fact
that the government

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.020
is turning raccoons bi-lingual.

And that famous clip
is by no means and outlier.

who gets charged up

Now look, ideally, ideally,
the first thing you should know

about<i> The Alex Jones Show,</i>
is nothing.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.387
But, unfortunately,
it is an important part

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:02.888
of a lot of people's

00:02:02.988 --> 00:02:06.092

or watch it online every week,

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:10.796

And two, my British accent

But-- but I will give him this,
Jones is right,

00:03:39.284 --> 00:03:42.855
that too often, people don't
present him in his full context.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:44.990
So tonight,
we are going to do that,

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.393
and let's first set aside
the key context,

00:03:47.627 --> 00:03:49.428
that Alex Jones has repeatedly
used his show

00:03:49.528 --> 00:03:51.864
to fuel speculation
that the Sandy Hook Massacre

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:54.833
was staged by the government,
which has been deeply hurtful

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:56.669
for the parents of those
children over the years.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.705
That is disgusting
and should be disqualifying

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:01.807
in terms of ever taking
him seriously.

00:04:02.274 --> 00:04:04.410
Sadly, doing things
that disqualify you

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:05.878
from being taken seriously,

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:08.413
doesn't really seem to be much
of a thing anymore.

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:11.117
But-- but there is a piece
of context,

00:04:11.217 --> 00:04:12.452
you may be less aware of

00:04:12.552 --> 00:04:15.554
and that concerns the nature
of Jones' show itself.

00:04:15.754 --> 00:04:17.489
It is four hours long,

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:19.292

into the whole thing,

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:21.561
your most shocking discovery
might be how frequently

00:04:21.661 --> 00:04:24.597
and shamelessly he pitches
products that he sells.

00:04:24.697 --> 00:04:26.733

him earlier,

In one week of recent broadcast
on his sight,

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.128
we found he spent nearly
a quarter of the time,

00:05:29.395 --> 00:05:31.964
either talking about
or playing ads for his products,

00:05:32.064 --> 00:05:34.534

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:55.741
a chocolate flavored drink mix,
made from bee pollen, stevia

00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:57.909
and the dust
of chicken skeletons.

00:07:58.276 --> 00:08:01.948
Now, according to Infowars,
it is one of the most popular

00:08:02.048 --> 00:08:04.550
new health trend
in the world today.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:07.186
And by the look on Jones' face,
it tastes

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.321
exactly as good as it sounds.

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:11.323
You pour that in on a couple
of ice cubes.

00:08:11.556 --> 00:08:12.725
And folks, it tastes...

00:08:12.991 --> 00:08:15.728
when it's creamy and thick,
I think, better than Ovaltine.

00:08:16.161 --> 00:08:19.599
And it has got all the bone
broth and so much more.

00:08:20.299 --> 00:08:22.368
This is why, the ancients,
they believe were--

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:23.568
had such better bones,

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:24.870
were so much healthier,
you can look it up.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.106
This-- you could freeze this
and this will be better

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:29.208

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:41.020
that Alex Jones did not enjoy
drinking that glass of Caveman.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.523
Because, I have got a glass
of Caveman, right here.

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:47.226

between those two photos

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:35.807
is that you walked shirtless

You-- you could flip those
two photos around

and the effect would be
exactly the same. Also...

00:09:46.284 --> 00:09:50.589

he does have a medical expert,

00:09:50.689 --> 00:09:52.458
who consults on many
of his supplements,

that "bunch of degrees"

00:11:27.252 --> 00:11:28.286
Jones mentioned.

00:11:28.386 --> 00:11:30.722

a Doctor of Chiropractic degree

from Texas Chiropractic College,

but, while he listed-- lists all
these other schools on LinkedIn

00:11:35.794 --> 00:11:38.497
we checked and he didn't
graduate from any of them.

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:40.699
In fact, we asked him
and he admits,

00:11:40.799 --> 00:11:43.269
he does not have
an undergraduate degree.

00:11:43.469 --> 00:11:46.171
And as for whether he's
an "MIT alumni,"

00:11:46.371 --> 00:11:49.275
he only completed a non-degree
certificate program there,

00:11:49.375 --> 00:11:51.843
in fact, just to be sure,
we contacted MIT,

00:11:51.943 --> 00:11:54.113
and according to them,
"It is not accurate to say

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:57.783
he has a degree from MIT...
and calling him an alumni

00:11:57.883 --> 00:11:59.651

First, 45 to 50 million dollars
is a lot of money.

And second,

that every penny they earn
is being plowed back

00:15:34.366 --> 00:15:35.600 line:0%
JONES:
<i> We need to fund ourselves,</i>

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.502 line:0%
<i> and we find ourselves
 by you buying the products.</i>

00:15:37.602 --> 00:15:39.605 line:0%
We're at a shortfall now
because of the massive,

00:15:39.838 --> 00:15:42.741 line:0%
sustained economic attacks
we're under, but the listeners

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.809 line:0%
in just two weeks
have almost narrowed that gap.

00:15:44.909 --> 00:15:46.612 line:0%
I could have to sell my house...

00:15:47.212 --> 00:15:49.014 line:0%
to keep this place running
three, four months.

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:50.882 line:0%
I could have sponsors
every segment.

00:15:50.983 --> 00:15:53.151 line:0%
I don't do it.
I plug enough to fund things.

00:15:53.351 --> 00:15:55.821 line:0%
Fund us, give me the energy

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:57.489 line:0%
and I will attack the enemy.

00:15:58.357 --> 00:16:00.659
Exactly! It's like
an NPR pledge drive

00:16:00.759 --> 00:16:04.663
for people who hate NPR.
Because to listen to Jones,

00:16:04.763 --> 00:16:07.566
Infowars is perpetually
on the edge of disaster.

00:16:07.766 --> 00:16:09.568
He even has a link
on the Infowars store,

00:16:09.668 --> 00:16:11.470
where you can just
give him money,

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:13.805
to help fund the fight
against tyranny.

00:16:13.905 --> 00:16:15.941
And contributors
have left comments like,

00:16:16.041 --> 00:16:17.575
"Twenty-five dollars
may not be much,

00:16:17.675 --> 00:16:19.444
but I know
every little bit helps."

00:16:19.845 --> 00:16:22.480
But Jones seems
to be doing a bit more

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:24.516
than just keeping his head
above water.

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.052
Ex-employees describe
a thriving business

00:16:27.152 --> 00:16:29.487
with one saying,
"He can sell 500 supplements

00:16:29.588 --> 00:16:32.257
in an hour...
It's like QVC for conspiracy."

00:16:33.025 --> 00:16:34.793
And in one of those clips
we showed earlier,

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:37.896
we noticed he's wearing
what looks like a Rolex watch

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.098
worth around 8000 dollars.

00:16:40.198 --> 00:16:41.800
Which... cool.

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:44.002
And, y'know,
as we looked around,

00:16:44.102 --> 00:16:47.472
we noticed he also seems to have
another two different Rolexes.

00:16:47.572 --> 00:16:49.174
And you know... cooler.

00:16:49.908 --> 00:16:52.443
And here's the thing,
that is honestly fine.

00:16:52.543 --> 00:16:53.978
He can have fancy watches.

00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:56.448
There is nothing wrong
with him getting paid.

00:16:56.548 --> 00:16:58.383
I get paid to make this show.

00:16:58.483 --> 00:17:00.385
But it does fight
with his message

00:17:00.485 --> 00:17:02.321
that he needs you
to buy products

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:05.657
to help keep his show going.
And even Alex Jones

00:17:05.757 --> 00:17:07.059
seems to be
a little self-conscious

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:08.326
about that disconnect.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.529
But don't worry,
he's reconciled it

00:17:10.762 --> 00:17:12.564
in a truly amazing way.

00:17:13.097 --> 00:17:15.934 line:0%
I wear a blue sports coat
and a Rolex

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.869 line:0%
because it's a symbol
of middle-class

00:17:17.969 --> 00:17:21.840 line:0%
and humanity having prosperity
and promoting human prosperity

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:23.976 line:0%
for respect
of empowering humanity

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:26.712 line:0%
and stealing the image
of a man in a sports jacket

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:29.380 line:0%
with a Rolex,
that is the satanic image.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.084 line:0%
So, I dress as a Satanist,

00:17:32.284 --> 00:17:34.886 line:0%
so that I can enter their world
and show you

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:36.454 line:0%
that none of it means anything.

00:17:36.821 --> 00:17:38.890
Oh bullshit!

00:17:39.524 --> 00:17:42.027
How stupid do you think
your audience is?

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:43.595
Okay, you bought a Rolex

00:17:43.695 --> 00:17:45.330
so you could dress up
like a Satanist.

00:17:45.597 --> 00:17:47.265
What are the other two for?

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:50.969
And incidentally tormenting
the parents of Sandy Hooke

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.538
should comfortably get you
into the satanic club.

00:17:53.738 --> 00:17:56.174
I believe that's the easy pass
to whatever hell's version

00:17:56.274 --> 00:17:57.742
of the champagne room is.

00:17:58.109 --> 00:17:59.811
And look, so, at the start
of this piece,

00:17:59.911 --> 00:18:02.246
I promised Alex Jones
that I would put his statements

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:04.649
in context, because he is right

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.952
that if you place small clips
in isolation,

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:08.319
he looks like a loon.

00:18:08.419 --> 00:18:10.823
But if you play them in context,

00:18:10.923 --> 00:18:13.959
he looks like a skilled salesman
spending hours a day

00:18:14.192 --> 00:18:17.395
frightening you about problems
like refugees spreading disease

00:18:17.496 --> 00:18:19.131
and then selling you an answer.

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:21.833
Remember that gay frog clip
at the start?

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:24.136
He did a follow-up show,
explaining how chemicals

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:27.005
were being placed in the water
to feminize society

00:18:27.105 --> 00:18:28.206
and reduce the population,

00:18:28.306 --> 00:18:30.642
and then immediately
segued to this...

00:18:31.209 --> 00:18:34.479 line:0%
We shell five different brands
of the very best water--

00:18:34.679 --> 00:18:36.148 line:0%
<i> water filtration systems
 out there.</i>

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:38.850 line:0%
<i> They're amazing,
 they cut out 99.99 percent</i>

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:40.718 line:0%
<i> of the glyphosate,
 the herbicides,</i>

00:18:40.819 --> 00:18:42.187 line:0%
<i> the pesticides, the fluoride.</i>

00:18:42.687 --> 00:18:45.323
I mean to an untrained eye,
it sure seems like

00:18:45.423 --> 00:18:47.392
he was using the idea
of a gay frog

00:18:47.492 --> 00:18:50.728
to sell his products, which,
incidentally is the same mistake

00:18:50.828 --> 00:18:52.831
-the WB network made.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

00:18:52.931 --> 00:18:57.703
And-- and listen, listen!
I'm not saying-- I'm not saying

00:18:57.803 --> 00:19:00.338
the only reason Jones is talking
about the globalist,

00:19:00.572 --> 00:19:02.307
systematically feminizing us,

00:19:02.407 --> 00:19:03.976
is to sell over-priced
nutraceuticals

00:19:04.076 --> 00:19:06.812
so he can buy luxury watches,
but if I were saying that,

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:09.548
it certainly wouldn't be
the stupidest conspiracy theory

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:11.216
that you've heard
so far, tonight.

00:19:11.316 --> 00:19:14.486
So, if Alex Jones wants
his words in context,

00:19:14.586 --> 00:19:15.721
this is it.

00:19:16.054 --> 00:19:19.157
The fact that he happens to sell
so many solutions

00:19:19.258 --> 00:19:22.093
should really re-contextualize
how you think

00:19:22.193 --> 00:19:24.329
about what he is claiming
are problems.

00:19:24.596 --> 00:19:27.132
Think about it like this.
How would you feel,

00:19:27.365 --> 00:19:29.568
if at the end of this segment
that may well have made you

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:33.438
feel a little dirty, I tried
to sell you something

00:19:33.538 --> 00:19:38.109
to wipe that gross feeling away?
Would you question my motives?

00:19:38.376 --> 00:19:40.212
Well, I certainly hope not,

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:42.514
because that's what we are doing
right now.

00:19:42.614 --> 00:19:43.481
(CROWD CHEERING)

00:19:43.782 --> 00:19:47.085
Come with me. Come with me
because I'm proud to say

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:50.255
that we've been working
with a leading medical expert,

00:19:50.355 --> 00:19:52.356
and I would like you
to meet him right now.

00:19:52.457 --> 00:19:56.427
Please, please welcome
Doctor Ted Group III.

00:19:56.528 --> 00:19:57.529
-(CROWD CHEERING)
-Doctor Ted.

00:19:57.629 --> 00:19:59.631
Ah, so happy to be here.

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:03.401
We-- we're so happy
to have you, doctor.

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:08.306
A-- and we are-- we are here,
the doctor and I, to offer you

00:20:08.406 --> 00:20:11.843 line:0%
the John Oliver Moisture Armored
Tactical Assault Wipe.

00:20:12.443 --> 00:20:15.747 line:0%
The first tactical wipe
for use, exclusively,

00:20:15.847 --> 00:20:16.681 line:0%
on the perineal.

00:20:16.781 --> 00:20:18.249 line:0%
That's right.
Uh, for goodness sake,

00:20:18.349 --> 00:20:23.188
don't use this anywhere else.
You're gonna wanna just focus...

00:20:23.288 --> 00:20:25.824
-Right.
-...on this area right here.

00:20:25.924 --> 00:20:27.492
-JOHN: OK.
-DOCTOR: Right here.

00:20:27.592 --> 00:20:30.628
Now... now... now Doctor,

00:20:30.995 --> 00:20:34.165
Doctor, how is this going
to make people feel better

00:20:34.365 --> 00:20:36.134
about what they've seen tonight?
How...

00:20:36.234 --> 00:20:39.437
Well my studies show
that when you vigorously apply

00:20:39.537 --> 00:20:41.706
this taint wipe,
it causes a sensation

00:20:41.806 --> 00:20:44.675
that distracts the brain
from whatever it had previously

00:20:44.775 --> 00:20:45.944
-been thinking about.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

00:20:46.044 --> 00:20:50.182
OK, and again,
you've got degrees from MIT,

00:20:50.282 --> 00:20:51.883
and everywhere else,
and a bunch of other degrees.

00:20:51.983 --> 00:20:53.952
The media makes fun of you
and says that you're an idiot.

00:20:54.152 --> 00:20:56.588
-They do.
-(CROWD LAUGHING)

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:59.290
Just-- just for the record,
you did go to MIT, right?

00:20:59.390 --> 00:21:01.760
Well I've definitely
physically been there.

00:21:02.627 --> 00:21:04.196
That's... that's essentially
the same.

00:21:04.296 --> 00:21:06.297
That's what I've been telling
everybody.

00:21:06.397 --> 00:21:09.501
Now-- now you can actually
buy one of these wipes

00:21:09.601 --> 00:21:13.471 line:0%
at infowipes.com
for one million dollars.

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:16.341 line:0%
This is real.
They are actually available

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:17.809 line:0%
for a million dollars apiece,

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:20.078 line:0%
and don't even think
about buying a similar wipe

00:21:20.178 --> 00:21:22.481
in a store, because those wipes
will kill you.

00:21:23.748 --> 00:21:26.217
Yeah, also, these wipes
have the power

00:21:26.317 --> 00:21:28.353
to heterosexualize frogs.

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:30.355
So uh, that's very nice to have,

00:21:30.455 --> 00:21:31.956
'cause that's been
a real problem

00:21:32.056 --> 00:21:34.325
-what with all the refugees.
-(CROWD GROANS AND LAUGHS)

00:21:34.425 --> 00:21:37.795
And look-- look, this tactical
taint wipe has demonstrated

00:21:37.895 --> 00:21:39.231
incredible results,
hasn't it, Doctor?

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:40.598
Absolutely, it sure has.

00:21:40.698 --> 00:21:42.233 line:0%
Look at this photo of me.

00:21:42.867 --> 00:21:46.271 line:0%
<i>And now look at this photo of me
 forty-five minutes later...</i>

00:21:46.371 --> 00:21:48.640 line:0%
<i>-after applying the taint wipe.</i>
-(CROWD LAUGHING AND CLAPPING)

00:21:49.174 --> 00:21:51.176
You-- you're much redder there.

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:54.079
-I'm so much redder!
-So much redder!

00:21:54.179 --> 00:21:55.914
-So disturbingly red!
-So much...

00:21:56.114 --> 00:21:58.550
So, if you want to spend
a million dollars

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:01.319
on a taint wipe,
go to infowipes.com,

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:03.388
and if you're thinking, "Well,
no one's going to do that,"

00:22:03.488 --> 00:22:07.225
all I will say is, people pay
Alex Jones 45 dollars

00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:09.427
for a jar of chocolate flavored
chicken juice,

00:22:09.527 --> 00:22:11.630
so anything is fucking possible.
