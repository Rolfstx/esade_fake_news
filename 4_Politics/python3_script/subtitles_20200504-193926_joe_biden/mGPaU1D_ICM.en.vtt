00:00:00.278 --> 00:00:01.111
(grinding electric guitar)
- What did you think

00:00:01.111 --> 00:00:01.976
when you saw him coming up with it?

00:00:01.976 --> 00:00:03.037
- Oh, well he was telling us

00:00:03.037 --> 00:00:05.140
that it wasn't loaded, so that was okay.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.630
- I think he says it
is, is the gun loaded?

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.120
- [Woman] No, he said it wa--

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.960
- No, my gun's got ammo in it.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.170
We carry it like the police carry it.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.228
- But you're not the police.

00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:15.061
- [Woman] But you're not, yeah.

00:00:15.061 --> 00:00:16.200
- Well, that's just it, there's really

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.730
no distinction between the police

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.100
and the citizenship other than their

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.890
general training and permits to do so.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.040
- [Jordan] Training, though, is one thing.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.520
Why keep it loaded right now?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.550
- Because if somebody,
an Islamic terrorist,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.850
whatnot, crazy guy--

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:30.250
- [Jordan] Islamic terrorist?

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.210
What's your expectation?

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.630
Do you fear that's gonna happen right now?

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.463
- No.

00:00:33.463 --> 00:00:34.296
- Just cause you're walking around

00:00:34.296 --> 00:00:35.790
with a gun on your side
don't make me safe.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.817
It just doesn't look right, in society.

00:00:37.817 --> 00:00:39.780
- And to be fair, you're passing this out

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.590
because you want more rights because

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.423
you feel you're not--

00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:44.310
- [Man With Gun] I want a
greater restoration of rights.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.590
- So you don't have enough?

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.730
You're walking around a parade route

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.700
like John Wick and you
feel like, "I want more."

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.090
- That is me, Jordan Klepper, at a parade

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.420
in Gonzalez, Texas.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.790
I am facilitating a conversation

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.370
between a concerned parade-goer

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.440
and an open carry gun rights activist.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.860
They were carrying their
guns, out in the open,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.020
they were big guns, and
they were advocating

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.350
for the idea of constitutional carry.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.450
And across the state
in Dallas was my friend

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.050
Kobi Libii, and he was with a group

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.210
called Guerrilla Mainframe,
and they are a group

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.550
of black activists who
are drawing attention

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.260
to the cause of police violence

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.370
towards the African-American community.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.620
We decided to go out on this day

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.110
to see how people reacted to both

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.827
of these groups, to see if race

00:01:21.827 --> 00:01:24.301
played into this at all.

00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:27.120
Spoiler alert, it does.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.240
It's a really interesting episode for us,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.200
and I'm inviting my friend Kobi Libii

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.033
on to talk about it.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:33.360
We both had different experiences

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.410
but we were making one show, and we saw

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.770
some of these things from
different perspectives,

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.100
it wasn't always easy.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.430
One state, two protests and a conversation

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.770
around guns and racism in America.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.939
This is Klepper.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.772
(lighthearted guitar music)

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:48.950
- I'm always to get
rid of the shock factor

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:49.783
of seeing a gun.

00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:51.517
I think people have been conditioned

00:01:51.517 --> 00:01:52.924
"Oh gosh, there's a guy with a gun,

00:01:52.924 --> 00:01:54.570
"I'm gonna call 911."

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.890
- That's a good condition.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.750
- Well, is it?

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.210
When I see somebody going to church

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.907
I don't call the police
to say "Hey, they're

00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:02.910
"exercising their First Amendment rights."

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.390
- Yeah, well, people aren't getting killed

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.210
with churches all around the country.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.250
- Some people are getting
killed in churches.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.870
- Yeah, with guns!

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.590
C.J. is the founder of Open Carry Texas,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.930
a group that wants to normalize

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.130
the sight of people
carrying guns into Chipotle

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.890
and loosen Texas gun laws.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.292
They've been effective, in 2016 OCT

00:02:21.292 --> 00:02:23.200
successfully lobbied the state

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.620
to legalized licensed
open carry of handguns.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.620
- [C.J.] Are we done?

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.453
- [All] No!

00:02:28.498 --> 00:02:30.550
- [Jordan] And today C.J. and 30

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.748
of his OCT buddies are headed to a parade

00:02:32.748 --> 00:02:35.520
in Gonzalez, Texas to spread the word.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.490
Because this is Texas,
where the state bird

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.450
is a revolver, OCT isn't even the only

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.540
activist group open carrying today.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.870
250 miles north a second,
totally unrelated group

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.550
is using guns to draw
attention to their cause.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.910
My friend Kobi Libii
is embedding with them.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.860
- So I know I'm meeting this group

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.361
called Guerrilla Mainframe, I know that

00:02:55.361 --> 00:02:56.750
they're a group of black activists

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.420
and that they open carry to protest

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.332
police brutality, and I
know that we're in the South

00:03:01.332 --> 00:03:03.170
which has never had a problem

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.492
with black guys with guns.

00:03:04.492 --> 00:03:05.530
- I think you're gonna be totally fine,

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.530
I wouldn't worry at all.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.700
- Okay, you have the confidence

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.541
that only a white man
with security can have.

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:14.209
(metal rubbing)

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.080
- So I am here with Mr. Kobi Libii,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.050
who is both performer
and writer on Klepper.

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.270
What is Guerrilla Mainframe?

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.820
- So Guerrilla Mainframe is a group

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.880
of black activists based it Texas,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.150
and they do a bunch of things,

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.350
they do a bunch of community programs,

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.030
in their sort of working
class black community

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.550
in Dallas, but the thing
their most known for

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.290
are these sort of brash, confrontational,

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.750
militant open carry protests
against police brutality.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.780
So, if you don't know
what some of those phrases

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.340
mean, they take big, conspicuous guns

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.400
out in public and protest
the unjust killing

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:49.370
of black people by police.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.970
And so, there's sort of a
militant aesthetic to it,

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.010
so it's a lot of, picture
the Black Panthers,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.330
picture military fatigues and black gloves

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.708
and, you know, sort of
loud, very sort of direct

00:04:01.708 --> 00:04:02.541
(electric guitar music)

00:04:02.541 --> 00:04:03.900
confrontational chanting, that's

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.532
sort of their style of protest.

00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:07.213
- Whose streets?
- [Group] Our streets!

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:08.734
- I think this might be them.

00:04:08.734 --> 00:04:10.731
(military drum march)

00:04:10.731 --> 00:04:11.766
Okay, you got a second now?

00:04:11.766 --> 00:04:12.822
- Yeah, yeah, this is time
- All right, awesome.

00:04:12.822 --> 00:04:14.160
Those aren't loaded, right?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.993
- Huh?

00:04:14.993 --> 00:04:15.826
- Those aren't loaded.

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:16.659
- No, they are loaded.

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:17.492
- Oh, okay, yeah.

00:04:17.492 --> 00:04:18.910
- Yes, they're loaded, rocked and ready.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:19.743
- Great.
(cymbal roll)

00:04:19.743 --> 00:04:21.530
- What, specifically, were
they protesting that day?

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.950
- So, specifically they were protesting

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.161
the death of a gentleman named Botham Jean

00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:28.750
who was shot to death in his own home

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.760
by an off-duty police officer.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.270
So, a woman named Amber Guyger

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.280
is an off-duty police officer,

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.850
lived in the same building as Botham Jean

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.570
and went into Botham Jean's apartment,

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.610
and her story is that she believed

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.990
it was her own apartment.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.680
She walked into Botham Jean's apartment,

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.040
saw a man there, that she believed

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.170
to be a burglar, and
shot him with her weapon,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.003
and he died.

00:04:50.003 --> 00:04:51.520
- It's an absolutely insane story.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.620
- It's an insane story, yes.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.700
So she's white and an
off-duty police officer,

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.080
he's a black man in
line with a lot of other

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.660
unjust killings of unarmed black people,

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.890
this was a particularly
egregious one because

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:05.180
a dude's just sitting on
his own couch, you know.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.010
So this was protest about her prosecution

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.620
and what she was charged with,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.970
and what she wasn't charged with,

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.570
and more broadly raising awareness

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:15.870
about that killing and

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:17.502
this sort of epidemic

00:05:17.502 --> 00:05:18.335
(grinding electric guitar)

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:21.397
of unjust killings of people
of color by the police.

00:05:47.687 --> 00:05:48.590
(cymbal roll)

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.800
- The reason Rakim, who's the leader

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.590
of Guerrilla Mainframe
ended up in, as a figure

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.330
in the national news at all was because

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.680
he was detained for a number of months

00:06:00.322 --> 00:06:02.910
as a result of him being investigated

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:05.650
under what's called the
Black Identity Extremist

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.880
designation, which is a very shadowy,

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.480
new designation that the FBI created

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.750
to monitor quote-unquote
"Black Identity Extremists"

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.338
which is a nebulously defined, possibly

00:06:16.338 --> 00:06:20.424
nonexistent thing that gives the FBI

00:06:20.424 --> 00:06:24.330
a mandate to follow black activists

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.970
that they are concerned
about for whatever reason.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.260
And that's distressing to a lot of people

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.710
that care about, you know, civil rights,

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.930
because of COINTELPRO,
there's a long history

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.900
of the FBI doing very troubling monitoring

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.380
of black activists.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.090
You know, the FBI famously monitored

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.580
Martin Luther King, allegedly sent him

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.130
and a number of other activists

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:51.980
letters trying to get
them to stop their work,

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.830
encouraging them to kill themselves,

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.780
you know, there's a very troubling history

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.070
of law enforcement, and
the FBI specifically

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.840
monitoring black activists and trying

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.820
to make bad things happen
to black activists.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.770
Right, so that's the sort
of historical backdrop

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.603
of this.

00:07:05.603 --> 00:07:08.310
And then in 2017 we see
Black Identity Extremist

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:10.190
program pop the scene, we can't really

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.020
get much context on it, there's no,

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:13.310
for example there's no equivalent

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.584
White Identity Extremist program to cover

00:07:15.584 --> 00:07:18.900
the white supremacists, and, you know,

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.730
the antisemitic violence,
there's no equivalent

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.930
program to look at that kind of extremism

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:26.890
but, for some reason
Black Identity Extremism

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.400
is something that the FBI believes,

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.640
or certain parties at the FBI believe

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.010
needs to be monitored in this extreme way.

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:33.360
Anyway, that's the
backdrop of this and Rakim

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.990
is believed to be the first person

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:38.162
who's been detained under this

00:07:38.162 --> 00:07:40.140
Black Identity Extremist designation,

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.370
and particularly why he
was on the FBI's radar

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:44.210
is he's made a number
of very inflammatory,

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.680
very offensive remarks
about law enforcement

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.560
and the death of law enforcement officers

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.415
on Facebook and on Twitter,
and it's explicitly said

00:07:53.415 --> 00:07:56.190
in his trial that the reason he ended up

00:07:56.190 --> 00:07:59.160
on law enforcement's radar
is because of these things.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.237
Specifically, an FBI,
and this isn't a bit,

00:08:02.237 --> 00:08:05.960
the FBI officer that first flagged him

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.483
found out about him from Alex Jones.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.450
So the FBI officer watches InfoWars

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.530
and saw InfoWars covering not even

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.240
Rakim's group, but another group

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.570
of black activists marching around.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.237
And you can imagine the InfoWars
coverage of this, right.

00:08:20.237 --> 00:08:22.790
- I, uh, we watched a lot of that.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:24.880
- We spend a lot of time with
that fine gentleman, right,

00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.740
but so that's the sort
of level of thinking

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.240
that is going into this, at least

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.850
that's the criticism of it, right.

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:33.130
So anyway this guy ends up in jail,

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.470
Rakim ends up in jail for five months,

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:37.410
held without, denied parole, effectively,

00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:38.870
ultimately the charges are dismisses,

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.057
the judge is effectively like,

00:08:40.057 --> 00:08:42.297
"This is nonsense, you can't jail a person

00:08:42.297 --> 00:08:44.470
"because of things they said on Facebook."

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.290
And he was set free,
but the coverage of that

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.360
obviously caused a lot of consternation

00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:52.750
you know, across

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.070
everybody that cares about civil rights.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:57.520
So that's the background of this.

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.600
Anyway, we were interested in that group,

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.740
that particular treatment under
the Black Identity Extremist

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.010
designation, what their deal is generally,

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.050
their relationship to gun rights,

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.560
because a black militant group like this

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.613
has a different relationship to gun rights

00:09:08.613 --> 00:09:10.750
than a lot of other progressive groups.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:13.720
The difficulty about
trying to tell the story

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.230
of Rakim and Guerrilla Mainframe quickly

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.750
is, ultimately, a difficulty
I think we ran into

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:19.340
on this show, which is
that some of the statements

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.160
that Rakim and Guerrilla
Mainframe have made

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.750
are so inflammatory that there is gonna be

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:26.440
a certain segment of the population

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.472
that just shuts down in response to them.

00:09:28.472 --> 00:09:32.098
And one of my concerns
about trying to do that

00:09:32.098 --> 00:09:36.110
was trying to unpack that sort of

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.860
with the detail and care that it deserves

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.050
to be unpacked and, to my sensibility,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:46.330
to get people through
the discomfort with that.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.930
And to be clear, with
this kind of militant

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.490
rhetoric that discomfort
is part of the point.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.660
- The headlines with Rakim,
rightfully so or not,

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.818
focused on the rhetoric
that was there to get

00:09:54.818 --> 00:09:58.000
attention, that talked
about killing police

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.770
in a flippant manner, "laugh my ass off"

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:02.670
or "LMAO" I remember was one of the things

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:03.670
that stood out there.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.220
And so I recall at the
beginning part of it

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:06.440
it was like "Oh, it's tough."

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.460
As we're choosing things to put

00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:10.060
on television, is this
the kind of thing, are we

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.460
signal boosting a group
that is more problematic

00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.790
than it is helpful?

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.420
I remember that being part of the early

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.600
discussions we had there.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.277
And I think, like, as this story evolved

00:10:19.277 --> 00:10:20.800
we did find this day when they were

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:21.633
having the protest.

00:10:21.633 --> 00:10:25.030
The detail that seemed
unique, and a fun way in

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.470
was, on that same day they
were having that protest

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.750
another group was having
a protest, also in Texas,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.170
also using an open carry protest.

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.850
Specifically, their protest
was to bring attention

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:38.020
to open carrying, and more specifically

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:39.687
constitutional carry, and that group

00:10:39.687 --> 00:10:43.593
was Open Carry Texas, a
group run by C.J. Grisham.

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:47.900
They are there to normalize the idea of

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.260
brandishing a weapon in Texas.

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.780
They had some success a couple years ago,

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.480
Texas is an open carry
state, and it's part of

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.030
the efforts they had taken to make it

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.090
an open carry state.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.400
What they are pushing
for, they are consistently

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.200
pro Second Amendment, pro gun rights,

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.150
and there's smaller laws
that they are consistently,

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.170
C.J. is often at the State Building

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.520
attempting to push forward on that,

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.353
but what they were doing there

00:11:12.353 --> 00:11:14.200
was a thing called constitutional carry,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.670
which essentially is the rights,

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.600
the Constitution gives
you the right have a gun

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.670
and to carry a gun and they don't want

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.390
those extra steps to open carry.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.010
Once you get a gun you
should be able to open carry,

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.550
was essentially what they
were out in Gonzalez, Texas,

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.246
with their guns, trying
to get people to feel

00:11:29.246 --> 00:11:31.360
comfortable with guns and to support

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:32.720
the idea of constitutional carry.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:33.970
- And just to go back to the sort of

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.500
origination phase of
this, one of the reasons

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:39.812
that Lucy was so excited about

00:11:39.812 --> 00:11:42.680
Open Carry Texas specifically was because

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.360
Open Carry Texas is quite extreme, too,

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.420
in a lot of ways.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:48.310
And one of the ways
they're extreme is that

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.270
their leader C.J. Grisham
has also made a lot of

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.990
inflammatory, violent statements

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.580
about police the kind of
slightly different context

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.643
more about, you know,
the Bundys, basically,

00:11:56.643 --> 00:11:59.107
you know, cops coming for, you know,

00:11:59.107 --> 00:12:01.763
"If anyone messes with my
cattle rights, I'll kill 'em."

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:03.370
kind of thing.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.860
I'm not, that's not a direct
quote I just, you know--

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.990
- That's just your own personal beliefs.

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.823
- Exactly, yeah.

00:12:07.823 --> 00:12:08.836
- Big cattle rights guy.

00:12:08.836 --> 00:12:10.940
- If grazing rights aren't a thing--

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:13.030
- Kobi, we don't have time.
- I'm sorry, it's a soapbox,

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.863
it's a soapbox.

00:12:13.863 --> 00:12:16.270
- You and your grazing rights soapbox.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:17.103
- But it is true.

00:12:17.103 --> 00:12:20.281
What we started to find, so
C.J. is a controversial figure,

00:12:20.281 --> 00:12:21.114
(grinding electric guitar)

00:12:21.114 --> 00:12:22.527
he has been arrested multiple times,

00:12:22.527 --> 00:12:24.550
he is often an aggressor.

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:27.760
In 2018, C.J and OCT had a standoff

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.700
with police in Olmos Park, Texas

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.450
- [C.J] So you got an AR-15 because

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.110
a man is lawfully carrying.

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:34.380
- Get on the ground.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:35.414
- [C.J] No, we're not
getting on the ground.

00:12:35.414 --> 00:12:36.247
- Get on the ground.

00:12:36.247 --> 00:12:37.260
- [C.J] We're not getting on the ground.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.460
- Get on the ground, I'm
not gonna tell you again.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:39.293
- [C.J] I'm not doing
anything against the la--

00:12:39.293 --> 00:12:40.450
- Get on the ground!

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.475
(C.J. cries out)

00:12:42.475 --> 00:12:45.260
- [Officer] Hey, get back!

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:47.090
- This event was remarkable because

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:49.900
no one got killed, and because in response

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.990
to C.J.'s provocation Olmos Park

00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:53.520
repealed their gun ordinance.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.390
- That was a tense situation, they ask you

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.840
to get down, you didn't get down.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.673
What do you think would have happened

00:12:58.673 --> 00:13:00.720
if you were black and
that situation arose?

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:02.100
- It happens to white people, it happens

00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:02.950
to black people.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:04.270
When it happens to a black person

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:06.250
they get a lot of
credit, they get a lot of

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.760
attention for it, but when it happens

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.330
to a white guy we don't get the same

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.447
kind of attention. It's
not a black or white thing

00:13:11.447 --> 00:13:13.140
- I don't think black
people are getting credit

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.260
for dying at the hands of police.

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.226
That's not exactly a credit

00:13:16.226 --> 00:13:17.687
they're tying to put on their IMDb page.

00:13:17.687 --> 00:13:19.353
- No, I don't think it is,
I'm trying-- (cymbal roll)

00:13:19.353 --> 00:13:20.650
- And as you look into it, he has said

00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.090
some very similar things aimed at cops

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:25.150
online, on Facebook.

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:27.670
- And hasn't been
persecuted in the same way

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:29.280
for those statements, hasn't been jailed

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.180
for those statements, and, you know,

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.487
one of the ambitions with this episode is

00:13:32.487 --> 00:13:36.120
you're trying to show different
treatment under the law

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.650
and you're trying to
show, what essentially is,

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.640
you're trying to pin down unconscious bias

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.900
and the way it attacks,
it turns into actual

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.950
violence in communities and actual

00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.240
violations of civil rights.

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.100
It's sometimes hard to
prove, and sometimes

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.330
hard to see real concrete evidence of,

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:56.190
and one of the things we
liked about this contrast

00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:57.820
was, and that we thought we could do

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.200
in this format that we can't necessarily

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.430
do at The Opposition was, in showing

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.620
someone who has also made violent

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.140
anti-police statements but not faced

00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:08.410
some of the same
ramification, it's easier,

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:12.730
theoretically at least,
it gives some context

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:14.160
for people that are shut down

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.110
by the violent rhetoric as such.

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:19.240
It gives some context to them for why

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.320
even if you find that rhetoric offensive,

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.660
even if you find that
rhetoric a nonstarter,

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.410
the treatment of, you
know, Rakim specifically

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.940
around this rhetoric is a
broader civil rights problem

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.530
that we should all be concerned about

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.690
and emblematic of the
various disproportionate

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:36.340
treatments under the law, of which

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:39.290
killing unarmed people is
just one horrific example.

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:40.160
- And I think one of the first things

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.270
we wanted to do with this,
just because of this day,

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.657
it gave us a focal point to like,

00:14:44.657 --> 00:14:47.346
"Let's go and see what,
experientially, can happen."

00:14:47.346 --> 00:14:49.530
What were your expectations going down

00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.760
to Dallas to essentially
an open carry protest?

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:55.270
- Um yeah, well I--
- You're not a big guns guy.

00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:57.230
- I'm not a big guns guy,
so there's some jokes

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.346
early in the episode, and
when I'm at the gun range.

00:14:59.346 --> 00:15:00.179
(grinding electric guitar)

00:15:00.179 --> 00:15:01.500
I shoot a gun for the
first time in this episode,

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.760
so you should probably
watch it, if you haven't.

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:04.920
Hello, hello.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.730
So this is my first time.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.380
- Just relax, be comfortable,
you'll be good to go, man.

00:15:09.380 --> 00:15:10.237
- Would you like to...

00:15:10.237 --> 00:15:12.626
(gunshots drowning out dialogue)

00:15:12.626 --> 00:15:13.813
- I can't hear.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:19.463
- Just come on.

00:15:19.463 --> 00:15:20.296
- Okay.

00:15:20.296 --> 00:15:21.970
- [Rakim] So, now, do
a slow, steady squeeze,

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.668
and breathe out as you're
coming towards the end.

00:15:24.668 --> 00:15:26.570
(gun fires)

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.527
- Goddamn

00:15:27.527 --> 00:15:29.690
(gun firing)

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:31.420
- It feels like I fucking
summoned lightning.

00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:32.253
(laughing)

00:15:32.253 --> 00:15:33.335
- Yes!

00:15:33.335 --> 00:15:34.168
- Something that's wild about it

00:15:34.168 --> 00:15:36.580
is just the physical thing you do,

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.130
which is just this little
finger pull, you know,

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.384
that's what you call it,
right is finger pull?

00:15:40.384 --> 00:15:41.217
That's the technical term?
- Finger pull, yeah.

00:15:41.217 --> 00:15:42.050
You're a real pro.

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.905
What do you do?

00:15:42.905 --> 00:15:43.738
That finger pull.

00:15:43.738 --> 00:15:45.000
- I'm good at body stuff,
I'm an athlete, you know.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:45.959
Yeah, cool, cool, cool.

00:15:45.959 --> 00:15:46.792
- Yeah, no Clint Eastwood
often talks about,

00:15:46.792 --> 00:15:47.760
like, the finger pull.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:48.696
- Yeah, totally, exactly.

00:15:48.696 --> 00:15:49.529
- Yeah, I remember those classic moments,

00:15:49.529 --> 00:15:51.060
those classic finger pull lines.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:52.150
- Yeah, I think my career from here

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.983
is going to be as an action star,

00:15:52.983 --> 00:15:55.082
we don't need to get into it.
- I don't think you will.

00:15:55.082 --> 00:15:56.360
(both laughing)

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.310
- But the reaction you get from the weapon

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.840
is so wildly disproportionate
to the thing you do,

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.437
that it's a very surreal experience

00:16:04.437 --> 00:16:06.113
in that way, I found.

00:16:07.005 --> 00:16:10.410
- Yeah, actually I think
that's a really nice way

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:11.243
of putting it.

00:16:11.243 --> 00:16:14.300
I think for a lot of people
that is the draw, right?

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:15.900
That you have that access to that power,

00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.300
and for a lot of people
that is also the giant fear,

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.540
I'm like, by no means
should I have whatever

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.630
you can do to have that kind of power,

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.060
because whether or not yourself with

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:26.010
that amount of power.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.900
- And I think that the symbolism of that

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.340
is not lost on me in the
context of this episode

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:35.180
because I think what
you have is two groups

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.210
very much interested in the personal power

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.525
and the empowerment and the masculinity,

00:16:41.525 --> 00:16:45.810
you know, traditionally
defined, that comes from

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:47.910
wielding that, from physically having that

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.200
and from being seen having that,

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.540
and for Guerrilla Mainframe I think

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:55.480
it's a powerful antidote
to the lack of agency

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.800
that they're experiencing
in their community.

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:58.300
If you can be in your own home

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.870
and a police officer can walk in

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:01.270
and just shoot you to
death while you're sitting

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:04.250
in your own house, you know, if that's

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:08.480
the level of agency
you have, having a tool

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.940
or a symbol that is the opposite

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:15.270
of that powerlessness, there's a seduction

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:17.540
to that that I understand,
that fills a hole

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:19.960
that I think it's
reasonable to want filled.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.097
And then I think with a lot of sort of

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.670
run-of-the-mill gun rights guys

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:28.550
it's about, it's a little more cosplay,

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.840
like you have a great joke in the episode

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.850
where you call one of the guys John Wick,

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.560
and I think that's what
it is, it's a fantasy

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.540
about a kind of masculine prowess

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.170
that maybe they don't
feel in other respects

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:43.840
in their life or that
is satisfying to imagine

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:45.830
being the hero, the protector, the savior.

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:46.663
- For sure.

00:17:46.663 --> 00:17:48.430
- And it's like, but
the difference between

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.590
wanting that kind of power because

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.740
it sort of feels good and scratches

00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.310
an itch in you broken masculinity

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:56.370
is very different than
wanting that kind of power

00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:57.750
because you're afraid for your life

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:58.900
and feel powerlessness.

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:00.930
- Well said.

00:18:00.930 --> 00:18:02.120
Definitely the experience I had

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.730
when I was out in Gonzalez
with the open carry group,

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:08.620
there was probably about 30 or so people

00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:09.615
who were open carrying

00:18:09.615 --> 00:18:10.448
(grinding electric guitar)

00:18:10.448 --> 00:18:11.683
of all ages, even down to, I believe,

00:18:11.683 --> 00:18:13.720
a 13-year-old, who was open carrying.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.780
What are you carrying?

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.850
- I don't know the specific number,

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:18.300
I know it's an AR, I
believe it's an AR-15.

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:19.240
- It's an AR-15.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.760
Do you like open carrying?

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.593
- Uh, yes.

00:18:21.593 --> 00:18:22.750
- Why is that?

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:24.610
- It's just, like, if we don't have

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:28.850
any open carry, if we
don't get to have our guns

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.280
then what happens is
that there's gonna be,

00:18:31.280 --> 00:18:33.110
just gonna be chaos, like we're not going

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.970
to be able to protect ourselves.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.403
- How much practice do
you have on that thing?

00:18:36.403 --> 00:18:38.040
- I don't have practice right now,

00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.430
I'm just open carrying it.

00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:42.240
I feel responsible for protecting others

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.510
because I'm the one that could

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:46.080
provide protection with the gun.

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.650
- That's a lot of responsibility
for you, you're 13.

00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:49.483
- Yeah.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:51.263
- Is that good for you guys?

00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:53.010
A 13-year- old carrying an AR-15?

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.770
- He's probably a better shot than I am.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:55.930
Well, that's not true, not many people

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:56.930
are better shot's than I am.
(cymbal roll)

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:58.220
- I think for me the issue that I always

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.090
get caught up on is like, there's the idea

00:19:00.090 --> 00:19:02.050
that I have a gun, this is my right

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:02.883
to bring it in.

00:19:02.883 --> 00:19:04.630
They rarely take into effect how the gun

00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:07.690
does change speech in that situation.

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.690
You're injecting a potential
threat into a situation

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.220
and you're limiting other people's ability

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:14.073
to be free because
you've injected the idea

00:19:14.073 --> 00:19:16.860
of violence, and you call it protection,

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:19.730
and if you're not lucky enough to be

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.110
one of the people who feels safe

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.920
in that environment, that
person has the upper hand.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.820
I feel like that's
often not reckoned with.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.070
At the same time, I will give, like,

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.610
the arguments that feel
most compelling to me

00:19:27.610 --> 00:19:30.170
with Open Carry Texas, I
do think are essentially

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:33.750
libertarian arguments,
and a lot of that is, like

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:35.100
what the Second Amendment means

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.387
and I have these rights,

00:19:36.387 --> 00:19:38.747
they feel very anti-government,

00:19:38.747 --> 00:19:40.440
"You shouldn't be able to take

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.880
anything away from me."

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.760
And I think we've talked
a lot about this here.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:47.310
I think open carry, I think they

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.250
are able to reckon with what I deserve

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:51.530
but they have a hard time
reckoning, sometimes,

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.310
with how that affects culture, but to them

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.176
that doesn't matter.

00:19:55.176 --> 00:19:57.830
Initially, I thought this
piece was going to be,

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.720
we're going to see what
happens at two open carry,

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.130
I think I was probably overly simplistic

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:02.963
in my assumption going in.

00:20:02.963 --> 00:20:05.557
I was like "Oh, two open carry groups,

00:20:05.557 --> 00:20:07.567
"in Texas, that feels like that's a

00:20:07.567 --> 00:20:10.387
"Texas day, that's a Texas
a day as you're gonna get.

00:20:10.387 --> 00:20:12.147
"We're gonna go, I'm gonna go off on one,

00:20:12.147 --> 00:20:13.427
"Kobi can go off on one.

00:20:13.427 --> 00:20:15.167
"We can kind of tell
this stor to see, like,

00:20:15.167 --> 00:20:16.870
"what is the reaction to these groups?"

00:20:16.870 --> 00:20:18.010
- And to be clear, they were happening

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:19.570
at literally the same time.

00:20:19.570 --> 00:20:20.403
- Yes.

00:20:20.403 --> 00:20:21.770
- It was like the same
morning at the same time.

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:22.603
There's a shot in the
episode of us FaceTiming

00:20:22.603 --> 00:20:24.630
with each other, which
is, we didn't cheat,

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.130
that's real, that happened, right?

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:29.630
- Yeah, I think, like, it felt like

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.630
a social experiment. I think
also at that point in the show

00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.557
it was like, "Let's go without

00:20:33.557 --> 00:20:35.340
"a whole lot of expectation
what we're getting back."

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:37.000
- And, I was just, and I
think one of the things

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.960
we were very curious
about was just to watch

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:41.610
the experience of a bunch of black guys

00:20:41.610 --> 00:20:42.700
walking around with guns and a bunch

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:43.960
of white guys walking around with guns,

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.140
and just see how they're treated

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:47.570
and see what the temperature feels like,

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:48.760
you know, in the room, as it were,

00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.410
walking around with those groups.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.243
We really wanted to see what it was like

00:20:51.243 --> 00:20:52.811
for those two groups, you know,

00:20:52.811 --> 00:20:53.644
a black group and a white group

00:20:53.644 --> 00:20:55.290
walking around with guns,
and when we say guns

00:20:55.290 --> 00:20:56.298
we mean guns, right?

00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:57.365
- They're big guns.

00:20:57.365 --> 00:20:58.380
(Kobi laughing)

00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.850
There were some guns on the hip

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:03.430
but it was mostly giant,
giant military-style

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.263
weapons.

00:21:04.263 --> 00:21:05.096
- Yeah, these are long guns, there's no

00:21:05.096 --> 00:21:07.552
missing these guns, you
know, and it's a gaggle

00:21:07.552 --> 00:21:09.150
of these people, which is what you call

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.130
that's a technical term for

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.100
a group of men with guns.
- It's a gaggle of guns.

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.890
- It's a gaggle of guns.
- Yes, yes. (laughs)

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:15.970
- But it's, you know,
with Guerrilla Mainframe

00:21:15.970 --> 00:21:18.837
they're marching in
formation, it's, you know

00:21:18.837 --> 00:21:22.180
20 or 30 folks walking around with

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:24.100
weapons, you know, and Open Carry Texas

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:25.360
probably a little smaller than that.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.317
15, 10, 15, 20 guys?

00:21:27.317 --> 00:21:28.950
- I would say 15
- [Kobi] 15 guys, yeah.

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:31.480
- Yeah, it fluctuated, and I think

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.850
they also had big guns,

00:21:32.850 --> 00:21:35.140
I think their purpose there was

00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:37.040
this normalization and
so, they had those guns,

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.650
they wanted to be seen with those guns.

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:41.440
They had guns and
flyers, and C.J. Grisham,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.820
who is the leader, C.J. is very congenial.

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:47.140
Or genial. Congenial?

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:47.973
Genial.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:49.610
- I think congenial is like a disease.

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:50.443
- Oh. Is he--

00:21:50.443 --> 00:21:51.863
- Or no, that's congenital.

00:21:53.544 --> 00:21:54.377
Congenital is a disease.

00:21:54.377 --> 00:21:55.210
- He's genital.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.043
Is he genital?

00:21:56.043 --> 00:21:56.876
- He's genital.

00:21:56.876 --> 00:21:57.709
(Jordan laughing)

00:21:57.709 --> 00:21:59.647
C.J.'s genital, let's go with that.

00:21:59.647 --> 00:22:04.150
- You, this is my genital
friend over here. (laughs)

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.400
But his goal was to be
a friendly as possible,

00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:07.730
and so he's handing out flyers with a

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.867
big old gun on his back, saying like,

00:22:09.867 --> 00:22:11.577
"Oh, hi ma'am, hi ma'am, we're here

00:22:11.577 --> 00:22:13.407
"to talk about constitutional carry,

00:22:13.407 --> 00:22:14.480
"take this flyer."

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.280
Like, to be a presence,
but to almost blend into

00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.390
the background, which was
very different than the

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:24.290
way in which Guerrilla
Mainframe was hoping to

00:22:24.290 --> 00:22:25.130
affect the group.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:28.490
- Yeah, so it's really
interesting, with almost everything

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:29.810
you talk about with Guerrilla Mainframe

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:32.440
you have to talk about
different audiences,

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.410
because there is sort of one audience,

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:37.530
which is the black
community they come from

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:41.000
which is the working class community,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.160
working class, predominantly
black community,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:45.840
faces this kind of police
violence regularly,

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.260
has a number of other
very legitimate complaints

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.700
about the way structural racism

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.130
has impacted their
community, and so you have to

00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:53.920
talk about that audience,
and then separately

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.110
you have to talk about what I would call

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:57.560
the white mainstream audience,

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.683
which has a different reaction

00:22:58.683 --> 00:23:00.260
to some of these signifiers.

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:03.430
So Guerrilla Mainframe's posture, is,

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:05.663
I would say, confrontational, right?

00:23:05.663 --> 00:23:08.200
But the question is, what
are they confronting?

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.750
And what they are confronting is

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:13.770
a paradigm that lets black people

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.030
get killed in their own homes, right?

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:17.870
And even though that
posture is confrontational

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:21.250
to something, different
audiences read that differently.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:22.520
So when we were walking through that

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:23.670
working class black community,

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.120
it doesn't feel confrontational.

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:27.430
It feels actually quite
warm and friendly and known,

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:29.260
and so we'd get Black Power signs,

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:32.370
so that kind of confrontation, even though

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:34.500
the posture is an antagonistic posture,

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:35.970
it's a confrontational posture,

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.740
how that's received by the audience

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.740
is as empowering and as nourishing

00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:44.357
because the experience is like,

00:23:44.357 --> 00:23:47.357
"Oh, thank God, someone is expressing

00:23:47.357 --> 00:23:51.610
"how we feel in the
face of this violence."

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:53.350
And I have to say, for me personally,

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:56.130
I was surprised, I expected
to be mostly afraid,

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:57.967
because of police
retribution, my fear was,

00:23:57.967 --> 00:23:59.870
I'm afraid to be a black
person walking around

00:23:59.870 --> 00:24:02.520
in general, you know, because of

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.330
this kind of police
violence, I'm certainly

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.210
afraid to do it when we're
black guys with guns.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.520
Like, if my cell phone can be perceived

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:10.080
as a gun and I can be shot to death,

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:12.099
like, if I'm around actual guns, that's

00:24:12.099 --> 00:24:13.580
legitimately frightening to me.

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.590
So I was legitimately afraid walking in,

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.550
and what I was surprised
by in the working class

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:21.550
black community was how nourishing it felt

00:24:21.550 --> 00:24:26.550
to have this posture of confronting

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:28.190
the system that makes me feel afraid

00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:30.000
walking around like that all the time.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.220
Right, and I think that's what that

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.226
community responded to, and, you know

00:24:35.226 --> 00:24:37.180
you can say what you want
about the effectiveness

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.800
of that protest, you can say what you want

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.000
about the positivity of guns being out

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.490
in public at all, but it was

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.880
absolutely striking to me
how personally, and also

00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:51.450
in the community, that posture felt like

00:24:53.508 --> 00:24:56.537
a deeply nourishing counterpoint to

00:24:56.537 --> 00:24:59.170
the sort of pressure and persecution

00:24:59.170 --> 00:25:02.060
that that community and I
personally feel all the time.

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:03.270
So that's sort of one audience, right?

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.280
And then functionally what happens is

00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.300
we started in this working
class black community

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.600
and then crossed over and
were at the UT-Oklahoma

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.517
football game, which is a lot of uh,

00:25:11.517 --> 00:25:12.350
(Jordan laughing)

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:14.010
you know, you know, like a Saturday.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:14.843
- Yeah.

00:25:14.843 --> 00:25:17.010
It's, how do we get this,
how do we make it more Texas?

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.400
- Yeah, so it's a bunch
of, you know, I was about

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:23.070
to call them good ol'
boys, is that offensive?

00:25:23.070 --> 00:25:24.401
Is that like a slur against the South?

00:25:24.401 --> 00:25:25.361
- It's offensive to my people,

00:25:25.361 --> 00:25:27.160
I come from a long like of good ol' boys.

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.378
- Yeah, so forgive me, I
apologize to the South,

00:25:31.378 --> 00:25:32.359
broadly speaking.

00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:33.192
(Jordan laughing)

00:25:33.192 --> 00:25:35.320
But it's, you know it's the--

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:36.690
- They knew where they were walking into.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:38.066
- Yeah, it's frat boys, right?
- Yeah

00:25:38.066 --> 00:25:39.020
- One of the things that's incredibly

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.963
hard to capture on camera,

00:25:42.834 --> 00:25:47.834
and I think is also
difficult to communicate

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:50.980
to people who don't have this experience

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.010
in one axis of their life or other,

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:58.010
but the discomfort stepping outside

00:25:58.810 --> 00:26:01.760
of your place, is that when you are

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:04.090
being uppity, like
there's a particular way

00:26:04.090 --> 00:26:05.440
you get regarded as a black person

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.740
when your uppity, right?

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.780
Which is that if I walk into a place

00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:11.390
that's too expensive, or if I walk into

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:14.215
a particularly white
place, there is a tension

00:26:14.215 --> 00:26:18.330
that comes into the air,
of the way I'm regarded

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:20.730
until I can offer a couple of signifiers

00:26:20.730 --> 00:26:21.563
that say "Oh no no, don't worry,

00:26:21.563 --> 00:26:23.157
"I'm not, like a black
guy who wandered in here,

00:26:23.157 --> 00:26:24.487
"I'm like, a middle class black guy,

00:26:24.487 --> 00:26:25.987
"who, like went to an Ivy League school,

00:26:25.987 --> 00:26:28.835
"and, like, has money,
and can, like, talk good,"

00:26:28.835 --> 00:26:31.900
There's a certain, the sort of texture

00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:34.740
of that discomfort is very difficult

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:37.420
to explain if you're not familiar with it.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:39.583
And there's violence on
the back of that, too.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:43.330
We're coming off more than a century

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.224
of domestic terrorism,
in terms of black people

00:26:45.224 --> 00:26:48.860
being afraid about how
being uppity in that way

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.210
and being in communities they're not

00:26:50.210 --> 00:26:51.840
supposed to be in, asserting power

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.700
and agency that they're
not supposed to have,

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.500
can literally be a death sentence, right?

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.230
And so that texture is
still in the culture,

00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:59.680
so that's a long way of saying that

00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:01.980
there's one experience that
I was expecting to have,

00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.080
of just being with guns and people being

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.700
uncomfortable around
guns, and I think we both

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.640
had that experience and
saw that in different ways

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.473
people in Texas find that banal,

00:27:08.473 --> 00:27:10.210
people in Texas find that uncomfortable.

00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:12.360
But there's a whole other
texture to this experience,

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:13.900
once we'd crossed over
into the white community

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.520
which is just watching a group

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.210
of middle class white
people be uncomfortable

00:27:21.210 --> 00:27:26.210
at black people taking
a power and an agency

00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:28.940
that they're not comfortable
with them having.

00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:29.960
Does that make sense?

00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:30.793
- I think so, yeah.

00:27:30.793 --> 00:27:32.090
- And it's a really difficult experience--

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.750
- How does that show itself?

00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:34.850
How do you become aware of that?

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.150
- So I'll give you an
example, which is that,

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:38.270
and I think this is an example I think

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:39.660
we will have different
perspectives on this

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.160
in terms of how it showed up on the tape.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.760
Which is, there's that gentleman,

00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.010
I think he's still in this cut,

00:27:45.010 --> 00:27:46.599
who's like, "You know we
didn't use to see that."

00:27:46.599 --> 00:27:47.432
(grinding electric guitar)

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:48.937
The guy who's like "We
didn't use to see that

00:27:48.937 --> 00:27:50.900
"back in my day."

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:51.950
- Do you know what this is?

00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:52.783
- I have no idea.

00:27:52.783 --> 00:27:53.616
- I don't know but it makes
you uncomfortable, don't it?

00:27:53.616 --> 00:27:55.510
It's not like the America I grew up in

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.850
for the last 63 years, I promise you.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:27:59.380
- Yeah, no, I definitely tell you that.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.175
We were much more
separated before, for sure.

00:28:01.175 --> 00:28:02.008
- Right.

00:28:02.008 --> 00:28:03.960
(cymbal roll)
- I made a segregation joke.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.007
Because I'm classy

00:28:05.007 --> 00:28:07.690
- Thank you, I would go dick joke there,

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:08.523
it would've been out of place,

00:28:08.523 --> 00:28:09.356
it wouldn't have--
- Different strokes

00:28:09.356 --> 00:28:11.400
- Yeah, we each have
different strong suits.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.987
He's noticing something,
and to him it's like,

00:28:12.987 --> 00:28:14.380
"This is just not how it should be."

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.213
- Yeah.

00:28:15.213 --> 00:28:18.700
- Which is probably the
most kind reading of that,

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.950
is an unconscious bias,
and probably the most

00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:25.330
pointed reading is just a conscious bias.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.240
- Yeah, and so a cleaner
example is actually

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.187
something we cut, and I don't think

00:28:28.187 --> 00:28:30.005
it was a bad decision to
cut this, but there was--

00:28:30.005 --> 00:28:31.005
- Thank you.

00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.270
There were a group of kids,

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.160
there were a group of teenagers

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:40.887
who I interviewed on camera and I was like

00:28:40.887 --> 00:28:42.627
"Are you comfortable
with the group that you

00:28:42.627 --> 00:28:43.460
"just saw go past?"

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.290
And they were like "Oh,
yeah, no problem, whatever."

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:46.790
Or no, this is what it
was, they pretended they

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:48.308
didn't see them, so they were like,

00:28:48.308 --> 00:28:49.278
I don't know if you remember these guys,

00:28:49.278 --> 00:28:51.930
and I was pretty hard
on them in the interview

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.537
and I think too, I know there was,

00:28:54.537 --> 00:28:56.894
one of our white colleagues was like

00:28:56.894 --> 00:28:59.369
"I think you're being too hard on them."

00:28:59.369 --> 00:29:03.030
and you know, whatever
whatever in terms of

00:29:03.030 --> 00:29:05.110
what showed up on camera but they were

00:29:05.110 --> 00:29:07.520
talking about the group when we walked up,

00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.330
and they were talking
about calling the police

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:10.820
on them when I walked up.

00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.870
- Oh really, I didn't know that.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.580
- And so I heard that and so I was probing

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.246
because I was like
"Motherfuckers, I just heard you,

00:29:17.246 --> 00:29:19.727
"I just heard you talking
about calling the police

00:29:19.727 --> 00:29:20.586
"on them."

00:29:20.586 --> 00:29:23.510
And they're like "Oh, no
man, I didn't even see that."

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.680
and this is the sort of
doublespeak that I think

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:33.470
I'm attuned to in a
different way, just because

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:35.310
of my experience with this stuff, right?

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:40.093
And it's an incredibly difficult thing to,

00:29:42.073 --> 00:29:44.150
an experience like that
is a bit of a Rorschach,

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:49.150
where it's like in all
the nonverbal behavior

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:52.978
that's coming at me
from people all the time

00:29:52.978 --> 00:29:53.990
and it's like there's
all these studies about

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:55.750
how so much communication
is not about language

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.710
and what you're literally
saying but just like

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.320
the vibe you're sending out.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:00.960
It's why everybody
thinks we're so charming,

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.600
it's not our words it's our energy.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.880
- Thank you.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.210
- But there's the nonverbal
energy I'm getting

00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:10.570
from that context is so deeply hostile

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:13.970
and deeply uncomfortable in a way that is

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:18.970
very hard to communicate
to people who aren't

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:23.070
attenuated to hear that
discomfort as danger.

00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.903
Does that make sense?

00:30:23.903 --> 00:30:25.820
Because when I feel that
discomfort in a group

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.243
of white people, I'm like "Oh, shit."

00:30:27.243 --> 00:30:30.197
I am like "I need to be aware because

00:30:30.197 --> 00:30:31.220
"I am in trouble."

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:33.700
Because that level of concern

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.963
from a police officer is something

00:30:34.963 --> 00:30:36.210
that could kill me, that level of

00:30:36.210 --> 00:30:37.810
concern is gonna get
the police called on me,

00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:39.830
that level of concern is
gonna get me into a conflict

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.240
in my nice middle class
restaurant that I'm in,

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:44.420
you know, and so it's
perhaps a hyper-awareness

00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:47.610
to it but that discomfort is a real thing,

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:49.060
and that's very much what we got

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.570
when we crossed over into
that white community.

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:52.403
- That totally makes sense.

00:30:52.403 --> 00:30:54.882
I guess my thought in that is,

00:30:54.882 --> 00:30:57.640
that's also the intended
response, correct?

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.473
- Sure, yeah.

00:30:58.473 --> 00:31:01.260
- So is that a successful form of protest?

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.540
In the fact that you are able to see that,

00:31:03.540 --> 00:31:06.940
in the fact that you
have some white people

00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:07.817
going to a football game who are like,

00:31:07.817 --> 00:31:09.370
"Holy shit, what is this? What is this?"

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:12.580
and then they're forced to
have that conversation then.

00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:14.780
Like, no matter what, if I'm going

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:15.613
to a football game and a bunch of people

00:31:15.613 --> 00:31:18.200
are coming up with guns,
I'm gonna talk about it.

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:19.610
And then if a camera comes up to me,

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:20.443
I'm probably gonna be like,

00:31:20.443 --> 00:31:21.630
"Uh, I wasn't talking about it."

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:24.710
Now, I don't doubt that there is a giant

00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:26.653
racial component there, of course,

00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.370
but I'm wondering, is
that how that situation

00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:30.313
is going to play out?

00:31:30.313 --> 00:31:32.330
- I think it's as much about, you know,

00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:34.754
angry anti-police chants and a bunch of

00:31:34.754 --> 00:31:37.830
loud black guys being loud and direct

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:39.060
and confrontational and black

00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.520
as it is the weapons on their backs.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.170
In terms of whether or
not that's successful,

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:44.350
I think it's a really good question,

00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:46.790
and it's an audience question, right?

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.430
So there's the one conversation about

00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:49.940
it being nourishing to a community

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.990
that feels stepped on, and then

00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.950
there's a conversation about, okay

00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:56.420
what are we doing with
this kind of rhetoric?

00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.470
One of the functions of
this kind of militant

00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:01.367
posturing, rhetorically, is to say,

00:32:01.367 --> 00:32:05.077
"Okay, well, if you are comfortable

00:32:05.077 --> 00:32:07.817
"with this kind of
violence being done to us,

00:32:07.817 --> 00:32:10.487
"what do you feel, like come with me on

00:32:10.487 --> 00:32:12.997
"the empathetic exercise of imagining

00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:15.077
"if this kind of violence came back to you

00:32:15.077 --> 00:32:16.490
"and your community."

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:21.270
And the level of discomfort
that white people

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.108
feel when they hear somebody like

00:32:23.108 --> 00:32:26.310
Rakim talk so cavalierly about the death

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:27.930
of white police officers, that level

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:30.590
of discomfort is the level of discomfort

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:32.399
a mainstream white audience should feel

00:32:32.399 --> 00:32:34.210
every single time they hear about

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:35.440
a black person being killed.

00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.630
And I think the criticism,
the most generous,

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.210
sophisticated reading of this vocabulary

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:42.682
of protest is that, okay well,

00:32:42.682 --> 00:32:45.730
obviously, nonviolent protests,

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.460
Black Lives Matter, all these other modes

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.570
of trying to communicate
how fundamentally,

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:53.320
viscerally unjust the situation we're in,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.980
all that's not really
getting the job done,

00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:00.320
and so I'm going to try to reflect back

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.950
the kind of violence we
are experiencing at you

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:05.213
and see if that shakes anything.

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:08.740
So, to your point, it is designed

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:10.750
to make people, I think, uncomfortable,

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.270
and I think the question
is whether or not,

00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:14.900
is what we then do with that discomfort.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.850
What does that discomfort mean?

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:20.300
And do I have a similar
level of discomfort

00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:21.917
about the injustices
they're complaining about?

00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:24.870
- The argument that you make is, I think,

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:25.980
and incredible argument, and I think,

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.530
like, what you're asking
for is an engagement

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.780
with a white community
that is not engaging

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:33.660
with a community that is under duress,

00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:34.960
that is feeling that this kind of stress,

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:37.717
and has felt this kind of violence for

00:33:37.717 --> 00:33:40.190
a hundred years, but the articulation

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:42.840
of that in the moment is,
obviously it's the guns

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.690
to grab attention.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.940
It is chants, it's chants,
it's "Oink oink, bang bang."

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:49.500
Like, the chants are directed at police

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.340
- Yeah, that's about killing police.

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:52.173
- 100 percent.

00:33:52.173 --> 00:33:53.050
- That is a chant about killing police.

00:33:53.050 --> 00:33:54.750
- So I feel like you
have, there are definitely

00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:55.740
people on the right,
there are people who are

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:58.200
very critical of Guerrilla Mainframe

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.560
specifically because of their tactics

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.293
because of the lines that they cross.

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.160
Again, this is the
conversations that we were

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.843
having, like, when you are there

00:34:07.843 --> 00:34:09.250
and you are seeing that happen,

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:11.890
and you're having that emotional journey

00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:14.170
to see how people are reacting to that,

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:16.370
are you frustrated with the means

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:18.360
that they're using to elicit that reaction

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:21.078
or do you find this reaction,

00:34:21.078 --> 00:34:24.000
I understand that it's a
reaction out of necessity,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.680
but how comfortable are you with

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.333
that form of protest?

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:37.503
- It's difficult to, I have my ambivalence

00:34:37.503 --> 00:34:38.480
about it, right?

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:43.480
Like I don't, I have my
ambivalence about it, I think.

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:47.470
But, my sort of first order, before I can

00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:50.020
engage with my own personal ambivalence

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:54.510
about it, I have, sort
of first and foremost,

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:58.860
the work of asking other people,

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.350
asking white people, effectively,

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:02.423
to engage with it honestly,

00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:05.040
and it's one of the frustrations

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.530
about working on this piece, honestly,

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:09.570
is that I do have real questions

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.020
about this group
specifically, and I do have

00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:13.520
real questions about whether or not

00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.580
this mode of protest moves the needle

00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:16.413
in a positive way.

00:35:16.413 --> 00:35:17.320
The same questions I had about

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.650
the Black Panther Party, and militant

00:35:19.650 --> 00:35:21.780
Marcus Garvey groups on
back through the history

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:22.850
of black people.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.060
But again, to me that's sort of

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:29.300
a second-order problem,
because the first-order

00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:33.410
problem is asking for meaningful

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.550
engagement with the thing that it is.

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:40.550
And I find that, and I
found working on this piece

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:45.010
that the discomfort that is produced

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:48.940
by the rhetoric is so loud that it

00:35:50.361 --> 00:35:51.803
shuts white people down.

00:35:53.092 --> 00:35:56.390
- But is the actions,
are they disqualifying?

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.223
- In what sense?

00:35:57.223 --> 00:35:58.056
- Well, I think--

00:35:58.056 --> 00:35:59.760
- It's language, no, it's language,

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.607
you know what I mean?

00:36:00.607 --> 00:36:02.900
- But at some point somebody shuts off,

00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.240
and we're aware of when you push something

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:10.060
so somebody shuts off,
and I think the reticence

00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:12.960
that you have if people
hear "Oink oink, bang bang."

00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.780
If you hear something
online that is making fun

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:19.210
of police officers who are
dead and their families,

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.913
and you challenged Rakim on that.

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:25.240
Is that a line that is
crossed at which point

00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.200
you are not going to be heard because

00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.620
you have crossed that now delegitimizes

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:30.820
the argument that you have?

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:31.990
- It's a larger conversation about decorum

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.470
in politics, about decorum, you know,

00:36:34.470 --> 00:36:37.035
and propriety, and there are communities

00:36:37.035 --> 00:36:39.440
that feel like they don't have the luxury

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.150
of being polite because they're dying.

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:44.510
I do have concerns, I often
wish groups like this,

00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:46.310
and I very much include
the Black Panther Party

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:49.440
in this, were more
thoughtful and deliberate

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.560
about how this kind of
confrontational messaging

00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:57.010
can be useful and can
be counterproductive.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.910
Like, I almost always
want groups like this

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:02.730
to be a little more sophisticated

00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:04.550
with how they wield the powerful tools

00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:05.460
that they're wielding.

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:07.780
But again that's like,
that's let's shut the door

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.453
and have that conversation separately.

00:37:10.446 --> 00:37:13.960
Because to me that's an abdication

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.260
of responsibility as
a mainstream audience,

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.510
and it's an abdication of responsibility

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:20.137
as white listeners to say,

00:37:20.137 --> 00:37:22.878
"Okay, well you haven't
packaged this for me

00:37:22.878 --> 00:37:24.827
"in a way that makes me comfortable,

00:37:24.827 --> 00:37:27.527
"therefore, I have permission to keep

00:37:27.527 --> 00:37:28.440
"shutting the door on this."

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.500
It's a less conservative version

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:32.090
of the conversation about
Kaepernick and kneeling

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:33.897
which is like "Oh, I get
that police brutality

00:37:33.897 --> 00:37:35.277
"is is a thing you wanna talk about,

00:37:35.277 --> 00:37:36.887
"but the way you're doing it,

00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:40.477
"the nature of this protest turns me off

00:37:40.477 --> 00:37:42.447
"so I'm not going to
engage with the substance

00:37:42.447 --> 00:37:43.897
"of your criticism because the manner

00:37:43.897 --> 00:37:45.200
"of your speech is shutting me down."

00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.620
It's a similar criticism, right?

00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.390
- But I would say, I remember watching

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.910
your interview with Rakim and,

00:37:51.910 --> 00:37:53.250
I think we even watched this together,

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:54.217
and I think, like,

00:37:54.217 --> 00:37:57.010
- I remember this I remember very clearly.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:38:00.598
- You ask him about his Facebook posts,

00:38:00.598 --> 00:38:03.527
and you say, like "These police officers

00:38:03.527 --> 00:38:06.687
"were killed in Dallas, and you said LMAO

00:38:06.687 --> 00:38:08.017
"smiley face."

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.960
And Rakim was like "Oh,
yeah, I laughed, I laughed."

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.593
Rakim owned it.

00:38:13.593 --> 00:38:14.426
(grinding electric guitar)

00:38:14.426 --> 00:38:15.259
And he was joyous at a few moments,

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:17.460
and for me, I'm like "Fuck this guy."

00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:18.830
- Do you stand by those statements?

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:21.740
- I didn't say those
officers as individuals

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.770
deserved what they got,

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:26.237
I said the police
department deserved that.

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:27.510
- So, just to be clear, I'm pretty sure

00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:29.200
the exact quote was "They
deserve what they got."

00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.080
and I think it was, "LMAO" afterwards.

00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.450
- Yes, and I was laughing, and I'm still

00:38:34.450 --> 00:38:38.400
laughing today, just like
they're laughing at me, right?

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.060
Because as a black person what you hear

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:46.060
is Trayvon Martin, is
Michael Brown, Tamir Rice.

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:49.500
Eventually at some point
it become frustrating.

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:53.260
- How can you, then,
turn around and celebrate

00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.810
other people, going through the pain

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.020
of losing people that they love?

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.550
- Just like America celebrated Hiroshima

00:38:59.550 --> 00:39:02.940
and Nagasaki, after
Pearl Harbor, you know.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:06.870
It's just, you guys get
to grieve, for a change.

00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:09.460
- Do you have any intention
of doing something

00:39:09.460 --> 00:39:10.293
like what he did?

00:39:10.293 --> 00:39:11.126
- No.

00:39:11.126 --> 00:39:14.260
Killing police officers is not gonna stop

00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:18.270
police brutality, if anything
it's gonna encourage it.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:19.103
You know--

00:39:19.103 --> 00:39:20.020
- But couldn't you say the same thing

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.510
about your statements, though?

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:24.420
- I wanna be provocative
enough to get their attention.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.253
- Okay.
(cymbal roll)

00:39:25.253 --> 00:39:26.727
- I was like, "This
negates everything he did

00:39:26.727 --> 00:39:27.890
"up until this point."

00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:31.597
And also I'm like, "I
feel weird about putting

00:39:31.597 --> 00:39:33.587
"this guy on television because of that

00:39:33.587 --> 00:39:35.490
"aggressive stance."

00:39:35.490 --> 00:39:36.890
Also I feel protective, because I do think

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:38.170
I agree with the things that you're saying

00:39:38.170 --> 00:39:39.920
in the attention that they're bringing,

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:41.207
but I'm like, "This is delegitimizing

00:39:41.207 --> 00:39:42.470
"all the stuff he did before."

00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:45.700
Like, in order to try to amplify

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.400
the actual story, which,
at that point, to me

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:51.190
felt like drawing attention
to police violence

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:52.440
against African-American communities,

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.960
specifically in Texas, it's like

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.330
you have a guy who's laughing about

00:39:56.330 --> 00:39:57.780
cops getting killed, and like,

00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.848
guess what the stories gonna be,

00:39:59.848 --> 00:40:01.190
the stories gonna be
the guy who's laughing

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:02.470
at cops getting killed.

00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.800
We want it to be about something else,

00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:05.630
we can't amplify that part of that story.

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:06.960
- It's interesting, and I appreciate

00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:09.033
your bringing up that, you
watching it for the first time,

00:40:09.033 --> 00:40:10.621
because I was really struck by that,

00:40:10.621 --> 00:40:14.560
that was a striking
moment just in the process

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:17.450
of making that for me because I've never

00:40:17.450 --> 00:40:21.270
seen you react so
negatively to an interview

00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:22.377
subject before.

00:40:24.530 --> 00:40:25.790
My experience of it was
that you were really

00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:29.610
quite reviled by that and
really quite disgusted

00:40:29.610 --> 00:40:31.810
by that in a way that
I think is, is, that's

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:34.384
your personal reaction
and is very appropriate

00:40:34.384 --> 00:40:36.210
in that respect.

00:40:36.210 --> 00:40:38.310
But I remember being
very surprised by that

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:42.120
because I don't have,
I challenge him on it

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:42.953
in the interview.

00:40:42.953 --> 00:40:47.755
I find those statements
at the very least clumsy,

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:51.263
and at the very most, immoral.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:57.960
But they don't elicit the
same real repulsion for me,

00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:06.093
and I do think that is
a racialized difference,

00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:10.653
because there is, and this is not

00:41:10.653 --> 00:41:12.360
a you personally thing, this is just

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.360
the fucking culture.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:18.200
Black people are scary in this culture,

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.570
and I think that part of why that reaction

00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:21.850
for not just you, for a couple other

00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.450
of the white writers on the show

00:41:24.570 --> 00:41:25.790
had such a negative reaction to that

00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:29.410
was because of the racial coding

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:30.820
of that language coming out of the mouth

00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:31.653
of a black guy.

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.240
And the situation that pivots me into

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:41.380
is not being able to engage with my own

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:42.690
ambivalence about it because it's like,

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:46.720
oh shit, I get that reaction,

00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.800
and then I also get why
that kind of language

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:51.750
is totally banal and just an NWA album.

00:41:54.373 --> 00:41:56.130
There's a long history in pop culture

00:41:56.130 --> 00:41:57.930
of, like, people saying that kind of stuff

00:41:57.930 --> 00:41:59.836
where it's just a kind
of rhetorical posturing.

00:41:59.836 --> 00:42:00.669
- Sure.

00:42:00.669 --> 00:42:01.750
- From a community that's just like,

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.207
beat up by the cops, and is just like

00:42:04.207 --> 00:42:06.450
"Well, not fuck you, fuck you!"

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:08.840
There's something
pedestrian about it as well.

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:12.800
And the fact that it
reads as really dangerous

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.420
and reads as really disquieting

00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:17.570
and raises a real earnest engagement

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.680
and endorsement of that kind of violence,

00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.621
I do think is racialized.

00:42:21.621 --> 00:42:23.190
And I don't think it's about the skill

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:25.410
of us as storytellers to tell that story

00:42:25.410 --> 00:42:27.423
but I think it's about,
and I think this is

00:42:27.423 --> 00:42:28.640
a really difficult thing, it's a more

00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.950
difficult thing for you,
that me in some ways,

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:35.254
but to engage honestly
with that discomfort,

00:42:35.254 --> 00:42:38.420
and to tell the story of that discomfort

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:39.870
which is your honest reaction to it,

00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:42.810
while also telling the story of some of my

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:45.730
experience of it, which
is where the discomfort

00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:48.730
is not the headline, the
discomfort of that language

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:50.000
and that kind of violent rhetoric is not

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.026
the headline, the discomfort is "Look what

00:42:52.026 --> 00:42:54.717
"this particular group's organic response

00:42:54.717 --> 00:42:57.000
"to the other violence
they're suffering is."

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.500
And the most elite version of this story

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.580
is being able to tell
both of those experiences

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.563
at the same time.

00:43:04.496 --> 00:43:08.013
And it's super hard, it's super hard.

00:43:08.013 --> 00:43:09.170
- I think what was interesting too

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:12.780
in putting this together, functionally,

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:17.780
the way you make television is you have

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:19.560
these stories and you
have to edit them down

00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.860
and you pick the things that represent

00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:23.920
the experience that you had, and you

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.150
put them in an order, and we got into

00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:28.000
an interesting conversation
and debate about

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.860
if we're representing them correctly.

00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.330
And I think this got down, it got into the

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:36.330
minutiae, it got into the music choices

00:43:36.330 --> 00:43:37.163
we were using to address them--

00:43:37.163 --> 00:43:38.200
- Underscoring what we're using.

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.390
- How we underscore them, like--

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:41.780
- What order do we introduce them in?

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:42.613
- Right.

00:43:42.613 --> 00:43:43.610
- Like whether or not we can show C.J.

00:43:43.610 --> 00:43:45.000
Riding on a bike and being playful,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.080
whether or not, you know, like,

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.400
we had a bunch of discussions.

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:52.350
- And I'll admit, honestly,
we had four writers,

00:43:52.350 --> 00:43:54.194
you're the only black writer.

00:43:54.194 --> 00:43:55.440
- I was aware.

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.530
- You're aware, but I think like,

00:43:56.530 --> 00:43:58.050
I probably wasn't.

00:43:58.050 --> 00:43:59.260
I think that is unfair, as somebody

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.023
who's like, you're also an actor in this,

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.450
you wear many hats, you're doing

00:44:04.450 --> 00:44:05.651
a lot of things there.

00:44:05.651 --> 00:44:07.670
You've written on all these episodes,

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:09.310
on the one you're in, and all of that,

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:11.440
but you're also representing
the only voice in the room

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.740
who sees it from that perspective.

00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.650
And I do think, like,
I saw my own ignorance

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:16.983
in that discussion, but I do think

00:44:16.983 --> 00:44:18.657
it's an important conversation to have

00:44:18.657 --> 00:44:20.290
and it's one that I don't know if

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:22.603
I would have had without being challenged.

00:44:24.405 --> 00:44:25.730
- I appreciate, because we had

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:27.510
some tense discussions about this

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:29.190
at different points, you
know, and I appreciate

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:32.160
you were really receptive
to my perspective on it

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.410
but the thing that's difficult,

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:35.860
and I've said this in different ways

00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:37.560
even in this conversation,
but the situation

00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:39.440
it puts me in is, I don't have the luxury

00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:42.500
of my own ambivalence, because I end up

00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:46.153
fighting for the sort of most favorable

00:44:46.153 --> 00:44:48.550
view of these subjects and these groups

00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.200
because it's underrepresented in the room.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.550
And it's what it is, that's the role

00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.610
I ended up taking on this
particular conversation.

00:44:57.610 --> 00:44:59.030
It's tricky, it's a tricky situation

00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.863
to be in.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:02.247
That's what it was.

00:45:03.195 --> 00:45:04.028
- That's what it was.

00:45:04.028 --> 00:45:05.900
(laughing)

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.387
Kobi, I love talking to
you about this stuff,

00:45:08.387 --> 00:45:10.210
and I feel like this was really

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:11.043
a learning experience.

00:45:11.043 --> 00:45:13.723
This was a tough episode to work on.

00:45:13.723 --> 00:45:15.763
I really respect what you
do and what you bring to it.

00:45:15.763 --> 00:45:16.846
(upbeat guitar music)

00:45:16.846 --> 00:45:18.670
Thank you for trying to keep me honest.

00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:20.115
- Jordan, thanks so much
for coming on my podcast

00:45:20.115 --> 00:45:22.750
(Jordan laughing)

00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:23.810
Oh shit, you're supposed to--

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:24.643
- Oh shit, yeah. (laughs)

00:45:24.643 --> 00:45:26.180
- I'm sorry.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.061
- I just got into it.

00:45:28.061 --> 00:45:29.410
- If you liked listening to this podcast,

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:31.720
you're gonna like watching it even more.

00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:34.820
Go check out Klepper, it's

00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:36.010

00:45:36.010 --> 00:45:37.490
Go check it out.

00:45:37.490 --> 00:45:39.323
Thank you for listening.
