00:00:01.014 --> 00:00:03.764
(distant sirens)

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:06.450
- This week on BuzzFeed Unsolved,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.060
we investigate the murder
of William Desmond Taylor,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.900
a notable film director
in 1920's Hollywood.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.080
Let's peek behind the curtain

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.400
and see a little bit behind
the glitz and the glamour.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.500
- Well, but you know what they say.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.589
It's not all glitz and glamour.

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:22.960
But you just said that, right?

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:23.793
- Yeah.

00:00:23.793 --> 00:00:26.040
- Ah, I don't know how else to restate it.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.470
Sometimes people get
murdered in Hollywood.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.580
(laughter)

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.210
- Let's get into it.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.400
- [Narrator] Hollywood.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.240
February 2, 1922.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.690
The crime: murder.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.610
And what would become one
of the biggest scandals

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.830
to rock early Hollywood.

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.860
The victim: film director
William Desmond Taylor.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.260
Known by his friends as Bill.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.350
Born in Carlow, Ireland on April 26, 1872.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.910
Directing more than 40 films

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:59.960
for what is now known as Paramount

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.140
and working with
Tinseltown's brightest stars.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.830
Taylor was well-liked, respected,

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.720
and seen as a leading filmmaker.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.000
Taylor himself even starred

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.830
in one of the first feature films

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.830
that would define Hollywood

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.080
and would later serve as President

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.800
of the Motion Picture
Directors Association

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.640
for several years.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.840
By all accounts, William Desmond Taylor

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.680
was a glimmering beacon
in the cinema firmament.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.690
- [Shane] Forty movies in 1920
equates to two weeks of work?

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.140
- [Ryan] Yeah, 'cause they...

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.931
- [Shane] This movie's
called "Man Drops Potato."

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.190
- (laughter) Yeah.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.630
And there was like shooting
ten movies at the same time,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.463
in the same room.

00:01:43.463 --> 00:01:44.610
- Uh huh.
- No sound.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.930
- He's got six cigars in his mouth.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.260
He's operating seven different cameras.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:49.620
- He also acted in one.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:50.886
And that became a Hollywood classic.

00:01:50.886 --> 00:01:52.110
- Was he a good actor?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.230
- He only acted in one so...
- Nope.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.460
- He was a big deal back then, all right?

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.293
- Okay.

00:01:57.293 --> 00:01:58.470
- Leave WDT alone.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.303
- Okay.

00:01:59.303 --> 00:02:00.170
- Jesus.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.000
- Look, I'm not calling
into question his talent.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.410
- Yeah.
- Or his reputation.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:05.500
- This is coming from the auteur

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.280
of "Dogs Watch Television
for the First Time."

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.320
- It's a good video.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.610
- [Narrator] Picture if you
will the scene of the crime.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.820
Nestled on the corner of
Alvarado and Maryland,

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.120
in the posh L.A. neighborhood
of Westlake Park,

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.940
sits the luxurious apartment
of William Desmond Taylor.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.990
The time: 7:30 a.m.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.770
February 2nd.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.910
Taylor's valet, Henry Peavey,

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.778
arrives at his usual time to
make breakfast for Taylor.

00:02:35.778 --> 00:02:38.140
Upon opening the door,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.910
Peavey spots the obscured feet
of his boss on the ground.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.930
He calls out to Taylor.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.400
No response.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.170
Creeping in a bit farther,
Peavey discovers to his horror

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.230
the body of William Desmond
Taylor, fully dressed,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.750
lying face up with blood around his mouth.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.920
No sign of a struggle
is immediately apparent.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.300
It's assumed he died of natural causes.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.900
Peavey's shouts alert the neighbors,

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.710
many of them Hollywood stars
and starlets themselves,

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.900
who gradually shuffle
into Taylor's apartment.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.733
- [Shane] Who's there?

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:17.810
Like Greta Garbo and Charlie Chaplin?

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.030
"Let's get a load of this bloody man."

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.863
- [Ryan] Well, the thing is,

00:03:19.863 --> 00:03:22.520
he lived in an apartment
complex that was very luxurious

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.850
and there was a lot of people
who were already in Hollywood

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.950
living next door.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.070
- [Shane] Wow, that's fun.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:28.380
- [Ryan] It was a wild scene.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.213
Also, the last th--

00:03:29.213 --> 00:03:30.046
- [Shane] Asdfghj.

00:03:30.046 --> 00:03:31.770
"It was a wild scene."
- It is!

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.730
- The last thing you want

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.780
when there's a crime scene that's fresh

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.902
is everybody shuffling in
their fucking night robes.

00:03:36.902 --> 00:03:38.410
- Walking in with cosmopolitans.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.243
- Yeah, exactly.

00:03:39.243 --> 00:03:40.360
"Wonder what's goin' on here.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.188
"Ew, gross. Blood.

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:43.380
"Oh, I got it on my shoe.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.030
"Let me rub it off on this carpet."

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.863
That kind of thing.

00:03:45.863 --> 00:03:46.696
- Yeah.

00:03:46.696 --> 00:03:49.130
- You don't want that in a crime scene.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.300
- [Narrator] 8:00 a.m.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.420
The police arrive on the scene.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.860
8:40 a.m.

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.090
Coroner William Macdonald arrives

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.055
to move and examine the body.

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:00.410
And it becomes quite obvious;

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.040
this death was not due to natural causes.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.260
They lift Taylor's body
to reveal a pool of blood

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.640
staining the carpet where Taylor lay.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.291
A .38 caliber bullet had entered
the left side of his back.

00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:15.660
(gun fires)

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.790
Based on the placement of the bullet holes

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.810
in Taylor's jacket and vest,

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.670
officials conclude that
his arms were raised

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.220
at the time he was shot.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.540
Bizarrely, the police would
later consider this could mean

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.540
Taylor was embracing somebody
who then shot him in the back.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.180
- [Ryan] Meaning they shot him
while they were hugging him.

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:39.020
And then, boom.

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:43.900
- Or just from the...

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.830
Like, boom.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.041
- No, but he got shot in the back.

00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:47.480
It went through the back.
- He got shot in the back?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.010
- That seems awkward.
- Right?

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.610
- Also, wouldn't you shoot yourself?

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.443
- Wouldn't you shoot yourself?

00:04:51.443 --> 00:04:52.860
I don't know, bullets...

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.575
Do they stay in a body or do they just...

00:04:55.575 --> 00:04:56.818
Yeah, they stay in a body, right?

00:04:56.818 --> 00:04:58.810
- Well, there's exit wounds sometimes,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.010
and this one had an exit wound.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.510
- So it would've shot the person.

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.560
- Unless they planned it
so that they were like,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.032
kind of like an ole
situation where he's like,

00:05:07.032 --> 00:05:08.810
(grunt) and move like that.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:09.730
- Or like, (pfffw)

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:10.563
- Yeah, they're like,
running with the bulls...

00:05:10.563 --> 00:05:12.320
- Something like that, yeah.
- ...except it's a bullet.

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.200
- [Narrator] Police also
supposedly find a silky garment,

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.180
pinkish in color that
"resembled a nightgown."

00:05:21.091 --> 00:05:25.110
Detectives Sargent Edward
King later tells reporters

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.400
he thinks it belonged to a woman.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.260
A robbery is ruled out as
Taylor's wallet was left behind

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.000
with $78 cash inside,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.350
as well as other valuable
items in the home.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.150
Shortly after the discovery
of the bullet wound,

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.440
the Alvarado Court Apartments
are filled with reporters

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.720
and photographers from
every L.A. newspaper,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.980
as well as several papers outside of L.A.

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.310
Amidst the chaos of the crime scene,

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.821
one detail worth mentioning

00:05:53.821 --> 00:05:57.200
is the fact that before
police and reporters arrived,

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.536
Paramount's studio manager Charles Eyton

00:06:00.536 --> 00:06:04.160
visited the crime scene
upon hearing the news.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.990
It's believed that Eyton removed evidence

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:09.350
from Taylor's apartment that morning

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.550
in an attempt to avoid or at
least minimize the scandal.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.880
Some even believe he may
have planted false evidence

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.350
such as pink lingerie,
perhaps to hide the fact that,

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.830
as one theory had it,
Taylor was a homosexual.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.110
Detective Sargent Edward King,

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.240
who was assigned to the Taylor case,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.350
is among those who believed
Paramount was taking measures

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:34.580
to keep silent their stars

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.720
who may have had useful information

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.080
on the chance that it
would implicate them.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.940
When considering their roster of stars

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.337
associated with the case,

00:06:42.337 --> 00:06:46.430
the motive for the studio
interfering was quite strong.

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:49.300
Though, this only leads to more questions.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.020
What was Eyton cleaning up?

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:53.510
And whom was he covering for?

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.690
- [Shane] So the studio heads back then...

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.930
Sort of playing God.

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.660
- [Ryan] Yeah, sort of, yeah,

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.330
like a little bit of a God complex.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.760
Any time a major studio and a
person in a position of power

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.340
starts tampering with any
kind of case like this,

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.120
things aren't what they seem, obviously.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.380
- [Shane] All bets are off.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.870
Got those dirty, dirty
Hollywood fingers all over it.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.634
- [Ryan] This is like a
classic dirty Hollywood story.

00:07:17.634 --> 00:07:18.870
- [Shane] It stink, man.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:19.703
- [Ryan] It stinks, yeah.

00:07:19.703 --> 00:07:21.081
- [Shane] All the way up to the top.

00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:22.431
- It's makin' my mouth dry.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.911
That's better.

00:07:24.911 --> 00:07:25.767
(puckering lips)

00:07:25.767 --> 00:07:26.810
(laughter)

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:27.643
- Poppy.

00:07:27.643 --> 00:07:29.050
- [Narrator] Let's take
a look at the night

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.140
before the body is discovered.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.890
The night that Taylor was shot.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:35.980
7:45 p.m.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.760
Hollywood comedy star Mabel Normand,

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.220
the last person known to
have seen Taylor alive,

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.850
leaves Taylor's home

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.650
and is driven off by her
chauffeur, William Davis.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.870
8:00 p.m.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:51.520
A sound that could have been a gunshot

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.510
is heard by actor and
neighbor, Douglas MacLean,

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:56.410
and his wife, Faith.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:00.430
This possible gunshot is also
heard by apartment manager,

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:04.710
E.C. Jeseren, who writes it
off as a misidentification

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.040
when no other disturbance follows.

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.950
- [Ryan] At first I thought,
that's a bit suspicious.

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:11.900
But then the more I thought
about it, I was thinking...

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.550
- [Shane] You write it off last night,

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.740
I was in my apartment,

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.310
and in the hallway I heard what, at first,

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:22.310
I thought was a woman like,
maybe, in pain or in distress.

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.420
At first, it was, "ahhh!"

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.060
and I was like, "Oh, no.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.330
"Is someone in my building in trouble?"

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.672
And then I just put my ear by
the door and it changed to,

00:08:31.672 --> 00:08:34.060
"Eohhh, uhhh, ohhh!"

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.490
It could have been someone in distress,

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:38.830
but my brain immediately was like,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.530
"I think someone's having
sex in the elevator."

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.870
And then the elevator door closes

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.810
and I stopped hearing anything so...

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.010
- [Ryan] It's a bit much
to confront the fact that,

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.910
"Hey, maybe someone's
being murdered right now."

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.743
- [Shane] It's a lot. It's a lot.

00:08:51.743 --> 00:08:53.000
- So you take, maybe not consciously,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.560
you take the easy way out.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.890
Much like you take the easy way out

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.735
when you're confronted
with ghost evidence.

00:08:57.735 --> 00:08:58.730
Oh, win.

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.880
- Ryan, not the season for it.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.820
- Shoes pivoting.
- Nope!

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.830
- Just thought I'd make that point.

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.829
- Let's not discuss that this season.

00:09:04.829 --> 00:09:06.946
- [Narrator] After hearing this sound,

00:09:06.946 --> 00:09:11.240
Faith MacLean spots a man
outside Taylor's home.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:14.450
She does not get a good
look at the man's face,

00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.730
but sees that he is clean
shaven, white, of medium build,

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:23.652
around 5'9", and dressed
in dark clothing and a cap.

00:09:23.652 --> 00:09:25.730
She would later say,

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:30.080
"He was dressed like my idea
of a motion-picture burglar."

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.303
- [Shane] Sounds like a hunk, right?

00:09:31.303 --> 00:09:32.380
(laughter)

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:34.450
- [Ryan] Well, it sounds like
someone went to Party City

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:36.220
and was like, "Make me
look like a criminal."

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.053
- [Shane] He have a cape?

00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:38.050
- [Ryan] No, he didn't have a cape.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:39.064
He wasn't Zorro.

00:09:39.064 --> 00:09:41.870
- [Narrator] The man seems
to notice Faith watching him,

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:45.190
but does not appear to be
alarmed or in any hurry.

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:48.710
Faith sees the man look back
into Taylor's home for a moment

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.350
as if saying goodbye.

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:54.730
Then, the man leaves, closing
Taylor's door behind him.

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.880
At the time, Faith does
not think much of it.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.730
- [Ryan] I don't know how she
didn't think much of that.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:01.307
You say he's dressed like a cat burglar.

00:10:01.307 --> 00:10:03.440
He's poking around this guys' house.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.996
You heard something that
sounded like a gunshot.

00:10:04.996 --> 00:10:06.500
I think all those things together

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.001
may make me think a little bit about it.

00:10:08.001 --> 00:10:09.704
- [Shane] What if he was
just turning around, though,

00:10:09.704 --> 00:10:12.030
and like, it looked like
he was saying goodbye,

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.630
but what if he just sorta
did a double take like,

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:16.463
"That's a wrap."

00:10:16.463 --> 00:10:17.770
(laughter)

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.250
- [Narrator] 8:15 p.m.

00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:23.240
Howard Fellows, Taylor's chauffeur
at the time of his death,

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.682
moves Taylor's car into the garage.

00:10:25.682 --> 00:10:29.197
When he goes to drop off the
keys at Taylor's apartment,

00:10:29.197 --> 00:10:32.220
Taylor does not answer his door,

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.740
despite the lights being on inside.

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:36.230
It's assumed by police

00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.210
that Taylor was already dead at this time.

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.520
The next day, police would
find six cigarette butts

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.865
in the alley behind Taylor's
and the MacLean's apartments.

00:10:46.865 --> 00:10:49.890
The MacLean's maid, Kristina Jewett,

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:52.140
heard footsteps in this alley

00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:55.090
around the time of the supposed gunshot.

00:10:55.090 --> 00:10:57.217
Perhaps the killer bided his time

00:10:57.217 --> 00:11:00.780
until he saw an opportunity to strike.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.648
- [Shane] Why is this unsolved?

00:11:02.648 --> 00:11:03.857
Seems like a...

00:11:03.857 --> 00:11:07.040
Seems like they're really zeroing in here.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.495
- [Ryan] Well, we don't
know who the man is.

00:11:08.495 --> 00:11:09.565
- [Shane] Ohhh...

00:11:09.565 --> 00:11:10.840
- [Ryan] And most importantly,

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.030
we don't know if the man
was acting independently.

00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:14.574
- [Shane] Mmm...

00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:17.770
- [Ryan] Looks like you're
jumping to conclusions.

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.210
- [Shane] Yeah, I am.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.800
- [Ryan] Yeah... (laughter)

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.854
Maybe that detective mind of yours

00:11:21.854 --> 00:11:23.303
isn't as strong as you thought.

00:11:23.303 --> 00:11:24.136
- No, no, no.

00:11:24.136 --> 00:11:26.520
It's pretty strong.

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:28.213
I have a strong brain.

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.500
- [Narrator] Also left out
was the testimony of two men

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.850
who claimed an unknown man
inquired where Taylor lived

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.630
around 6:00 p.m. on the night of murder

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.710
at a nearby gas station.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.392
The man's description was
similar to Faith MacLean's.

00:11:45.392 --> 00:11:49.460
Although, this man was
wearing a dark suit.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:51.100
- [Shane] Yeah, he's at a gas station?

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:51.933
- [Ryan] He's at a gas station near--

00:11:51.933 --> 00:11:54.200
- [Shane] Maybe buyin' more smokes.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.033
- [Ryan] There it is.

00:11:55.033 --> 00:11:57.120
See there, he's back!

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:58.350
He's back.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:01.070
Yeah, he was asking where Taylor lived.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:04.140
He was at a gas station near
where Taylor lived already.

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:06.270
- [Shane] Wait, he was asking where Tay--

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.230
- [Ryan] He was asking these
two men at a gas station,

00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:11.060
at 6:00 p.m., two hours
before the gunshot,

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:11.900
where Taylor lived.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.250
- Oh, I missed that part entirely.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.736
- I guess the detective mind
is actually not there at all.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.720
- Ah, interesting.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.680
- [Narrator] Exiting the
events of that night,

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.290
let's examine odd events that, perhaps,

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:25.494
foreshadowed Taylor's demise.

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:27.220
(phone ringing)

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:29.640
Towards the end of 1921,

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.220
Taylor had received several mysterious

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.170
and unnerving phone calls

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:36.964
seemingly with nobody on
the other end of the line

00:12:36.964 --> 00:12:38.300
when he answered.

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.480
Additionally, Taylor's home
was robbed on December 4, 1921.

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.430
The thief had taken jewelry

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:49.600
and the special imported
cigarettes Taylor smoked,

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.610
which had gold tips.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:56.180
On December 27th, he
received a strange package.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:59.190
And for more details on that,

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.890
let's get into our first suspect.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:05.430
The first suspect is Edward F. Sands,

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.160
who had previously served

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.750
as Taylor's secretary
slash valet slash cook.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.750
In 1921, Sands had
forged checks from Taylor

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.170
for more than $5,000.

00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:19.840
Also taking jewelry and clothing

00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.700
before eventually disappearing.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.631
Sands had previously been
court-martialed for embezzlement

00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:29.480
and dishonorably discharged
from the U.S. Navy.

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:31.840
According to actress Clair Windsor,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.404
Taylor had voiced his
intention to skill Sands

00:13:34.404 --> 00:13:36.890
if he ever saw him again.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:38.060
- [Ryan] $5,000 back then,

00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.574
it's actually quite a bit of cash.

00:13:39.574 --> 00:13:41.300
- [Shane] Yeah. So, oh!

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:43.203
So Taylor was going to kill him!

00:13:43.203 --> 00:13:45.930
- [Ryan] Yeah because he
had stolen so much from him.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:46.930
- [Shane] That's so strange.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.256
Do you think he meant it?

00:13:48.256 --> 00:13:50.030
- [Ryan] I mean, it could have been like,

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:51.193
"I'm gonna kill him next time I see him,"

00:13:51.193 --> 00:13:53.639
and then you see him
and you're like, "Hey!"

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:54.472
- [Shane] Yeah, right.

00:13:54.472 --> 00:13:58.000
I can't imagine he'd see
him at like the Copacabana

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.833
and he just...

00:13:58.833 --> 00:14:00.072
- [Ryan] Just pull out
a gun and shoot him.

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:01.240
- [Shane] Yeah, yeah.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.040
- [Ryan] No, I think he was angry with him

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.215
is what we'll get from that.

00:14:04.215 --> 00:14:05.240
- [Shane] Mmm...

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:06.610
- [Ryan] This is just demonstrating

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.258
that there is bad blood
between the two of them.

00:14:08.258 --> 00:14:09.430
- [Shane] Yes.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.430
- [Narrator] This
conversation was several days

00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:14.060
before Taylor himself was murdered,

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.840
further demonstrating a grudge.

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.740
Sands had spent time digging up dirt

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.804
on Taylor's private life

00:14:18.804 --> 00:14:21.990
before finally absconding with his money.

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:23.350
This snooping brings us

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.160
to one of the weirdest twists in the case.

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.070
The revelation that Taylor
wasn't who he said he was

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:32.807
and Sands, perhaps, knew it.

00:14:32.807 --> 00:14:37.340
As mentioned before, Taylor
had received a strange package

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:38.858
on December 27th.

00:14:38.858 --> 00:14:42.717
The package was postmarked
from Stockton, California

00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:45.600
and contained a pawn slip for the jewelry

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:47.958
that was stolen on December 4th.

00:14:47.958 --> 00:14:52.140
The pawn slips had been
signed William Deane-Tanner,

00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:55.320
which as Taylor's murder
investigation would reveal,

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.550
was Taylor's real name.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.970
Along with the pawn slip
was a note that read,

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.084
"So sorry to inconvenience
you, even temporarily.

00:15:04.084 --> 00:15:08.540
"Also observe the lesson of
the forced sale of assets.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.210
"A Merry Christmas and a happy
and prosperous New Year."

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:16.700
Also notable was the name
used to sign the note.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.950
"Alias Jimmy V."

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:21.700
This could possibly be a reference

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.020
to the film "Alias Jimmy Valentine,"

00:15:24.020 --> 00:15:27.810
a movie about a thief who
frequently alludes the cops.

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.770
More importantly, this
note suggests the thief,

00:15:31.770 --> 00:15:36.220
possibly Sands, stole the
jewelry and then pawned it off

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.570
using Taylor's real name to taunt him

00:15:39.570 --> 00:15:42.210
as Sands likely knew there was a reason

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.150
Taylor had changed his name.

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:45.890
Before making the change,

00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:49.030
Taylor had started and deserted a family.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.550
A past he had hidden to
preserve his reputation.

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.190
Perhaps knowing this,

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:58.330
Sands sent this note and jewelry
pawn slips to mock Taylor.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.374
It's worth mentioning,

00:15:59.374 --> 00:16:03.030
the handwriting on this
note was similar to Sands.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:05.760
Police attempted to lure
Sands to Los Angeles

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.720
via a woman he'd dated.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.940
A ploy that did not work.

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:14.166
And police were never able to
question their major suspect.

00:16:14.166 --> 00:16:16.760
- [Ryan] I mean, it very
well likely could be him.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.590
They just never were able to catch him.

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:19.500
He's a greasy one.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.380
- [Shane] They just couldn't find him.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:23.160
- [Ryan] I mean, I don't know, it's 1920s.

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:24.510
Must be harder to find people.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.556
- [Shane] Yeah, I guess
you just go find a tree

00:16:26.556 --> 00:16:27.863
to sit under somewhere.

00:16:27.863 --> 00:16:29.162
- [Ryan] Yeah, yellow pages?

00:16:29.162 --> 00:16:30.350
I don't know.

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:31.350
I mean, I think you're pretty fucked

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:32.596
once he gets passed the state border.

00:16:32.596 --> 00:16:33.760
- [Shane] Move to a new town.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.520
Tell 'em, "Hi there, my
name is Ricky Goldsworth."

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.380
- [Ryan] Ricky Goldsworth.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:40.190
- You know, if you ever
get tired of doing this,

00:16:40.190 --> 00:16:41.580
you can just move to a new town,

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.410
tell 'em your name's Ricky
Goldsworth, and you're done.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:44.357
You're set for life.

00:16:44.357 --> 00:16:46.290
- Yeah, I'd tell 'em that.

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.600
I want the top house.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.433
I want the top room.

00:16:48.433 --> 00:16:49.266
- You can just move into a new town--

00:16:49.266 --> 00:16:50.099
- No, no. Yeah I can.

00:16:50.099 --> 00:16:53.950
- No, you can't just move
into a town and take a house.

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:55.870
- I don't think you heard me.
- With what?

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.460
- "I want the best house
in your neighborhood

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:00.580
"and I want it stocked
with food, furnished,

00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:02.120
"and I want servants, as well.

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:03.870
"I want butlers and you're gonna be one."

00:17:03.870 --> 00:17:05.143
- "Sir, you can't..

00:17:05.143 --> 00:17:06.780
"I'm the mayor, sir."

00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:09.380
- "No, that's not how this is goin' down."

00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:10.407
- "Oh, shit."

00:17:10.407 --> 00:17:11.900
- "Your outfit's in my car.

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:14.950
"I'll expect you at my
house later, 8:00 a.m.

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:15.920
"Leave the keys under the mat."

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:17.374
- "Yes sir, Mr. Goldsworth."

00:17:17.374 --> 00:17:18.756
(deep sigh)

00:17:18.756 --> 00:17:19.950
- Good Goldsworth.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.359
What a story.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:25.020
Goldsworth's really comin' into his own.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.272
- You're talkin' to me?

00:17:26.272 --> 00:17:28.522
(laughter)

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.720
- [Narrator] The second
suspect is Mabel Normand,

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.360
the Queen of Comedy.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:38.580
Mabel was the last known
person to see Taylor alive

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.310
and it had been long rumored

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.970
that Mabel and Taylor were intimate.

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.946
A fact that Mabel denied.

00:17:44.946 --> 00:17:48.250
Though, it's easy to see
why this was believed.

00:17:48.250 --> 00:17:50.520
One of the valuables
found in Taylor's pocket

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:54.710
was a silver locket containing
a photo of Mabel Normand,

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:57.770
engraved with "To my dearest."

00:17:58.730 --> 00:18:00.910
Mabel also admitted that she and Taylor

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.403
had exchanged letters,

00:18:02.403 --> 00:18:07.400
which the press dubbed the
"Blessed Baby letters,"

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:10.140
named after Taylor's pet name for Mabel,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.270
which she used when
signing her letters to him.

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:17.500
However, the letters were not
found at Taylor's apartment.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.440
Some believe these letters

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.950
could have been among the evidence

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:22.730
removed from Taylor's apartment

00:18:22.730 --> 00:18:25.460
by studio manager Charles Eyton.

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.594
- [Ryan] I think it's pretty certain

00:18:27.594 --> 00:18:30.090
that they were in his house
and they were removed,

00:18:30.090 --> 00:18:31.240
which doesn't look good.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.310
- [Shane] The studio head
removed these love letters

00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:35.940
between Mabel and...

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.690
- [Ryan] Yeah, so she
would sign her letters,

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:38.670
"Blessed Baby."

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:39.503
- [Shane] Blessed Baby.

00:18:39.503 --> 00:18:40.830
Weird thing to sign--

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:42.119
- [Ryan] Well that was his
pet name for her, which is--

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:43.164
- [Shane] "Oh, Blessed Baby."

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:43.997
(laughter)

00:18:43.997 --> 00:18:44.850
That's, ugh.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:45.920
- [Ryan] Yeah, it's gross.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.670
- [Shane] Why does the studio head care...

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:49.060
- [Ryan] That's the question
you should be asking.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.491
Why should he care that Mabel Normand

00:18:51.491 --> 00:18:54.260
is placed inside his
apartment several times

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.290
with these letters possibly.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.930
Why does he care about the
relationship being public?

00:18:57.930 --> 00:18:59.930
- [Narrator] Mabel said
she wouldn't have minded

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:01.290
if people read them,

00:19:01.290 --> 00:19:04.690
but thought that they
might be "misunderstood."

00:19:05.764 --> 00:19:07.430
Eyton would eventually turn over

00:19:07.430 --> 00:19:10.280
some of Taylor's personal
papers to the police.

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:13.080
But it's possible that
he still retained papers

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.290
the studio didn't want them to see.

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:16.930
- [Ryan] Well, also, what the shit?

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.440
Why don't they just get a search warrant,

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.720
and go to this dude's house,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.700
and be like, "Hey man,
give us everything."

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.210
- [Shane] He owns the law, man.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:26.220
- [Ryan] Oh, you think that like,

00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:28.056
the studio owns the
police like in the pocket?

00:19:28.056 --> 00:19:29.820
- [Shane] Yeah, 'course they are.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:31.370
- [Ryan] I mean, that's
not for sure, is it?

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.670
- [Shane] You ever see L.A. Confidential?

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.240
L.A. cops back in the
day were in the pocket

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.210
of the powerful men in the city.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.520
- [Ryan] That's a fictional film.

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.400
- [Shane] Yeah, I know.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.460
- [Narrator] On February 9th,
the "Blessed Baby letters"

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.740
were turned over to the
Chief Deputy DA W.C. Doran.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.600
After causing such a fuss,

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.140
what did these letters day you might ask.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.390
Of what I could find,

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:55.760
in all of what was actually handed over,

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.820
one read, "Sorry I cannot
dine with you tomorrow,

00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:03.210
"because I have a previous
engagement with a Hindu prince.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:04.610
"Some other time.

00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:05.800
"Blessed Baby."

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.257
- [Ryan] Not exactly a criminal manifesto.

00:20:08.257 --> 00:20:09.550
- [Shane] No.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.120
Hey, we've all been to
dinner with a Hindu prince.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:13.090
- [Ryan] Yeah! Yeah, right?

00:20:13.090 --> 00:20:14.230
That's just something you do.

00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:15.770
- [Shane] What a life she's leading.

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.110
- [Ryan] So, this could either be A:

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.280
these letters were in fact very suspicious

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.850
and not all of them were handed over.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.950
Or B: she was kind of worried

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:28.090
that this may make it seem
like they're in a relationship,

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.417
overreacted, and by her
overreacting and saying,

00:20:30.417 --> 00:20:32.176
"These may be misunderstood,"

00:20:32.176 --> 00:20:35.227
it actually made her look more guilty.

00:20:35.227 --> 00:20:36.230
- [Shane] Yes.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:37.080
- [Narrator] At the behest

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.520
of District Attorney Thomas Lee Woolwine,

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.600
Detective Sargent King
had Mabel's home searched

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.030
in response to a tip
that the murder weapon

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.671
would be found in her house.

00:20:46.671 --> 00:20:50.870
During that search, two
guns were uncovered,

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:52.910
but both were .25 caliber

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.320
and did not match the murder weapon.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.670
One theory holds

00:20:56.670 --> 00:20:59.480
that while Mabel didn't
murder Taylor herself,

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.450
Mabel's addiction to drugs,

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:03.586
her association with drug dealers,

00:21:03.586 --> 00:21:07.910
and Taylor's known insistence
in helping Mabel get off drugs

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:12.400
possibly led to someone from
Mabel's world doing the job.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.610
- [Shane] She's on drugs?

00:21:13.610 --> 00:21:14.443
- Yeah.
- Mabel!

00:21:14.443 --> 00:21:16.500
- [Ryan] She had trouble
with alcohol and drugs.

00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.620
To be fair, most of Hollywood

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:20.180
had trouble with drugs back then.

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:21.690
- [Shane] It's just like
amphetamines or somethin'?

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.600
This a old-timey drug?

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:24.840
- [Ryan] I'm not sure what the drugs were,

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.473
but I know that most of
Hollywood at the time

00:21:26.473 --> 00:21:28.300
was under the influence of drugs

00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:30.505
and Taylor was crusader in terms of that.

00:21:30.505 --> 00:21:31.640
He was against it.

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.120
He was trying to clean Hollywood up.

00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.678
- [Shane] Pretty boring
for him to be that way.

00:21:34.678 --> 00:21:37.540
- [Ryan] Well, I mean,
maybe boring enough--

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:39.370
- [Shane] Maybe all of
Hollywood ganged up on him

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:42.200
and said, "This guy's a real buzzkill."

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.490
- [Narrator] Captain Edward A. Salisbury,

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:48.720
an explorer and colleague of
Taylor's, was quoted saying,

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.100
"Billy Taylor threatened
to make an example

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.310
"of the drug peddlers in Hollywood,

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.700
"but they evidently got him first."

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:01.010
The third suspect is Mary Miles Minter,

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:03.150
a 19-year-old silent film star

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.160
who was vocal about her most likely

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:07.220
unreciprocated love for Taylor,

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:09.680
who had directed her in the past.

00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.300
A few love letters
written by Mary to Taylor

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.560
were found amongst Taylor's possessions.

00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.650
One of which read, "Dearst, I love you.

00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.410
"I love you. I love you.

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:23.750
"X X X X X X X X X X.

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:26.090
"Yours always, Mary."

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:28.313
- [Ryan] Not exactly a poet.

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.854
(laughter)

00:22:29.854 --> 00:22:30.950
- [Shane] Very insistent.

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.680
That's a lot.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.680
- [Ryan] You know,
incriminating, perhaps not.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.170
Embarrassing, definitely.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:37.080
- [Shane] Yeah, I wouldn't want that.

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.917
I'd kill someone if they were like,

00:22:38.917 --> 00:22:40.770
"I'm going to make this letter public."

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:44.070
- [Narrator] Other letters
were bizarrely written in code.

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.580
Though, when decoded,

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.810
contained nothing but
the written affections

00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.015
of a young girl.

00:22:49.015 --> 00:22:51.270
- [Ryan] I know that may
seem weird, it is weird.

00:22:51.270 --> 00:22:52.230
- [Shane] What kind of code?

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:54.420
- [Ryan] Like a cypher and when decoded,

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.610
it was pretty much her telling him

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:58.580
she wanted to take long drives with him,

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:00.270
sit by the fire and snog.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:02.860
- [Shane] Boy, I can't
imagine why this guy

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:04.294
didn't want anything to do with her.

00:23:04.294 --> 00:23:05.750
(laughter)

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:07.700
- [Narrator] Another item
turned over to police

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.390
on February 9th was a
lace and silk handkerchief

00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:15.620
embroidered with Mary's initials of M-M-M.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:20.040
Rumors began that the pink
nightgown found in the apartment

00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.020
also had the initials M-M-M.

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:26.060
Both of these items
could possibly place Mary

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.102
in his apartment at least at some point.

00:23:29.102 --> 00:23:31.260
- [Shane] So where was the handkerchief?

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:32.093
- [Ryan] In his apartment.

00:23:32.093 --> 00:23:32.926
- [Shane] In his apartment.

00:23:32.926 --> 00:23:34.484
- [Ryan] And so was,
apparently, this nightgown.

00:23:34.484 --> 00:23:37.100
If there, in fact, is a
pink nightgown in there

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:38.770
with her initials on it, I mean,

00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:41.555
that looks like maybe they
may have been intimate.

00:23:41.555 --> 00:23:44.497
At the very least, it places
her inside his apartment,

00:23:44.497 --> 00:23:46.770
which all the investigators
are trying to do.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.140
- [Shane] Which to me,
again, is not that suspect.

00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:49.990
- [Ryan] I suppose.

00:23:49.990 --> 00:23:51.210
- [Shane] I've had people in my apartment

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:53.130
who didn't murder me.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.500
I don't find it that suspicious

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.890
that the handkerchief was in the apartment

00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:59.750
'cause, I don't know, she
seems to have been after him

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:01.709
and she's over there for a
cup of tea at some point.

00:24:01.709 --> 00:24:03.770
- [Ryan] Or maybe she could
have mailed it to him.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.910
- Yeah, just like, "Here's my scent.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.295
"I'm a weirdo, remember?"

00:24:08.295 --> 00:24:10.310
- "Smell it before you go to
sleep at night think of..."

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:12.320
- "Think of the drives we might take.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.600
"I love you, I love you, I love you."

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.460
- "You decoded the letter, right?"

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.520
- "Yeah, I'll get to that."

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:18.232
- [Narrator] Though, interestingly,

00:24:18.232 --> 00:24:22.610
Mary claimed that she and
Taylor had never been intimate.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:25.220
Mary also stated that she did not believe

00:24:25.220 --> 00:24:27.320
that any of the men she had rebuffed

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.570
would be jealous enough to kill Taylor.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.760
After hearing that Taylor had been shot,

00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:35.360
Mary showed up at his
apartment in dramatic fashion

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.073
as reporters took note.

00:24:37.073 --> 00:24:38.073
- [Shane] I love it!

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:41.230
Her showing up in
dramatic fashion, though.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:44.957
That's just her, you know,
going to the hot party of the...

00:24:44.957 --> 00:24:48.490
If all, like you say, all the
big stars are there, like,

00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:50.028
"Oh... Oh and here she comes

00:24:50.028 --> 00:24:51.532
"slipping in a fresh puddle of blood."

00:24:51.532 --> 00:24:52.990
- [Ryan] You think they
were taking selfies

00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:53.970
with the body or something?

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.590
- [Shane] Well, maybe. I don't know.

00:24:55.590 --> 00:24:57.530
It seemed like it was the hot ticket.

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:58.830
- [Ryan] Well, I looked at that more,

00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.990
with a more incriminating lens.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.380
I thought it was her putting on a show

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.990
to show that she was remorseful

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.961
so that in the case of
a murder investigation,

00:25:04.961 --> 00:25:08.710
everyone would have taken
note how heartbroken she was.

00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:11.270
- [Narrator] Aside from a
possible motive of killing Taylor

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.447
due to being rejected,

00:25:12.447 --> 00:25:15.370
there isn't much to implicate Mary.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.800
It's more likely her
relationship with Taylor

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.446
boiled down as a way to escape

00:25:19.446 --> 00:25:23.530
from her overbearing stage
mother, Charlotte Shelby.

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:27.400
Who, by the way, is our
fourth and final suspect.

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.690
Charlotte Shelby, mother
of Mary Miles Minter,

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:33.770
pushed her daughter into
acting at a young age.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:37.720
Mary was actually originally named Juliet

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.650
and Shelby even went as far as having Mary

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:44.920
steal the identity of a dead
cousin named Mary Minter

00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.620
to make Juliet older on paper

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:51.620
so that Mary slash Juliet
could continue working.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:55.970
From then on, Juliet went
by Mary Miles Minter.

00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:57.300
- [Shane] Classic stage mom.

00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:59.300
- [Ryan] That is fucking insane.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.160
- [Shane] I mean, we've talked
about stage moms before.

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:05.429
I think it's a little strange
to take your little child,

00:26:05.429 --> 00:26:07.510
dress them up like a little pony,

00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:09.070
put them out on a stage,

00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:10.460
"Ohh, dance for the people.

00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.770
"Dance."

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:12.603
- [Ryan] "Dance!"

00:26:12.603 --> 00:26:13.436
- [Shane] You're three years old!

00:26:13.436 --> 00:26:15.470
- [Ryan] "Dance for them and
make sure you refer to yourself

00:26:15.470 --> 00:26:16.990
"by the name of your dead cousin."

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.057
- [Shane] It's very strange.

00:26:18.057 --> 00:26:20.930
- [Ryan] It's one thing to
have a stage name, right?

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:23.370
It's another thing to steal the identity

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:28.370
of a dead family member so that
you could go recite Hamlet.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:29.965
It's fucking strange.

00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:31.620
- I don't think she was reciting Hamlet.

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:32.853
- You get what I'm saying.

00:26:32.853 --> 00:26:34.530
(laughter)

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.430
- [Narrator] Shelby was a reported suspect

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.350
because she'd been angry with Taylor

00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.660
for her belief that he
deflowered her daughter.

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.800
Once Charlotte Shelby learned of this,

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.130
she started several arguments with Taylor

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:48.550
for getting too close to her daughter.

00:26:48.550 --> 00:26:50.500
Shelby's relationship with her daughter

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.497
was already strained to begin with

00:26:52.497 --> 00:26:55.180
and it's conceivable
that there was jealousy

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:58.380
that she was losing her
daughter to an older man.

00:26:58.380 --> 00:26:59.980
According to some accounts,

00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.130
Shelby had even threatened to kill Taylor

00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:06.030
on more than one occasion if
he got too close to Mary again.

00:27:06.030 --> 00:27:08.140
Both an author of a book on the case,

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.370
as well as a film director

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:11.540
who planned to adapt the case into a film

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.550
believed that Shelby is
the most likely culprit.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.482
If you'll recall,

00:27:15.482 --> 00:27:19.090
police speculated that Taylor
was shot during an embrace.

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.090
Perhaps that embrace
was a faux-olive branch

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:26.452
extended by Shelby to Taylor
to lure him into a trap.

00:27:26.452 --> 00:27:28.040
- [Shane] Mmm...

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:29.650
- [Ryan] She's the only one I could see

00:27:29.650 --> 00:27:31.810
who would have fake-hugged
him so she could shoot him.

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:34.090
- [Shane] Yeah. Yeah.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:34.923
- [Ryan] 'Cause maybe it's like,

00:27:34.923 --> 00:27:35.770
"Bury the hatchet.

00:27:35.770 --> 00:27:37.210
"It's okay that you're dating my daughter.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:38.950
"I approve. You're dead."

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:39.783
- [Shane] That's pretty good.

00:27:39.783 --> 00:27:40.923
I like this lady as a suspect.

00:27:40.923 --> 00:27:42.680
- [Ryan] A lot of people
like her as a suspect.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:45.710
- Yeah? God, I love the hug murder.

00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:46.639
That's good.
- It is, right?

00:27:46.639 --> 00:27:48.780
- Especially if it's her, you know,

00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:51.980
I'm picturing like, Anjelica Huston.

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.690
Just sort of embracing and just eyes.

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.940
- And then, yeah, while the hand is there,

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.730
putting her back, taking
the gun to the back, boom.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:05.210
It doesn't even seem very
logical or effective.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:07.280
I feel like you're more
likely to shoot yourself.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.010
But, you know, old Hollywood.

00:28:09.010 --> 00:28:09.870
She was a stage mom.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:11.350
She liked theatricality.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.420
- [Narrator] There were rumors that Shelby

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.541
and District Attorney Thomas
Lee Woolwin were friends

00:28:15.541 --> 00:28:19.306
and perhaps, romantically
interested in one another,

00:28:19.306 --> 00:28:23.390
opening the door for some
to suspect a cover-up.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:25.680
- [Shane] She's just
sleeping with the detective?

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.710
- [Ryan] The district attorney.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:27.927
- District attorney?
- Yeah.

00:28:27.927 --> 00:28:29.759
- They were just like, "A dame, huh?"

00:28:29.759 --> 00:28:30.870
(laughter)

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.880
"I guess I'll cover-up a murder for her.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.947
"As long as she's smoochin' me."

00:28:33.947 --> 00:28:35.592
- (laughter) Exactly.

00:28:35.592 --> 00:28:37.650
- Push a bunch of files into the garbage

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:38.750
and that's a cover-up.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.710
"Cover-up what you can.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:41.310
"Let's make some more pictures."

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:43.730
- She seems the most likely suspect to me.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:45.210
On that, we agree.

00:28:45.210 --> 00:28:46.831
- The only thing that's weird

00:28:46.831 --> 00:28:50.340
about Charlotte Shelby being the culprit

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:55.340
is that the MacLean's saw a
white male leave the apartment

00:28:55.690 --> 00:28:57.130
around the time of the gunshot.

00:28:57.130 --> 00:28:58.433
- I mean, there could have
been two people there.

00:28:58.433 --> 00:29:00.190
- I guess she could have hired someone

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:01.500
to do the whacking for her.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.360
- That's true.

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.190
- [Narrator] William Desmond
Taylor's high profile murder

00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:06.860
continues to baffle.

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.210
An intertwined web of stardom,
lust, jealousy, and rage

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:13.630
set against the backdrop
of the false facade

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.780
of glitz and glamour in
an immoral Hollywood.

00:29:16.780 --> 00:29:19.590
In the end, all we can do is take a guess

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:21.830
as to who was truly responsible.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:25.570
But for now, the case remains unsolved.
