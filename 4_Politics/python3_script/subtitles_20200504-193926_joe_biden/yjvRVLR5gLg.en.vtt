00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.440
Hello friends this video is about my most
interesting summer projects at my secret

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.780
log cabin camp I worked on a lot of
different projects at once but the most

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.960
prominent was my log cabin I've been
building it for a few years in this

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.910
remote location near Ladoga Lake and this
season I finally got to the cabin's roof

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.140
construction initially I wanted to make
a traditional Finnish

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.510
birch-bark roof but due to time
constraints I had to toss the idea in

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.360
favor of a sod roof not only does the
sod roof look great but it also provides

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.870
heat insulation and it protects the
wooden roof structure from UV light

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.370
I installed a polymer roofing underlayment
under the sod to make sure the roof is

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.050
leak free as well as to protect the roof
members from moisture to make the

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.010
roofing job go faster I made a simple
ladderr from long sticks here's a life

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.250
hack you can easily debark green sticks
using a regular spoon I use my wire

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.409
clamper to secure the rungs on the
ladder this joinery method is better

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.680
than screws nails or even bolts this is
my prototype being tested if you want to

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.590
learn more about my wire clamper you
can find the link below it is a lot

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.079
easier to climb the log cabin's roof
using the makeshift ladder especially

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.110
when you have a heavy roll of wet sod on
your shoulder during the last summer I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.930
managed to cover the roof with only one
layer of sod this year I added a second

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.509
layer to it I tried different approaches
of sod installation I found each

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.329
approach has its pros and cons at least
now I know the roof will be able to

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.430
withstand large snow caps in the winter
and in the summer it turns beautiful

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.549
with lush grass ferns and wild
strawberries

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.860
I spent a lot of time and effort to make
an original log cabin door I wanted to

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.130
make it from oak slabs but couldn't find
any fallen oak trees so I made it from

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.700
a pine tree I used three different
methods to cut boards from a log two of

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.310
which I could recommend after two years
of experimentation I found the best way

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.830
to cut thick wide boards from a fallen
tree you can find a link to the board

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:43.000
cutting video below note the slabs were
not cracked or twisted after drying I

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.790
think now I know how to dry wood in the
outdoor setting the steps to install the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.790
door were time-consuming but interesting
tasks I had to cut a log into thick

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.410
slabs and transport them to the log
cabin then I had to joint the boards and

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.390
plane the grooves on the sides
followed by reinforcing the door using

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.650
horizontal dovetailed inserts I secured
the inserts with wooden dowels and hand

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.020
planed the door to make it look nice
only then did I finally install the

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:26.650
door perhaps the most challenging task
was to leave the upper door casing along

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.640
with the whole roof to install the door
with the built-in pin hinges the halved

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:40.600
logs used to deck the roof plus the weight
of the log rafters and sod made my roof

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.650
super heavy I'll be honest I wasn't
sure if I could do it by myself but the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:54.730
boldness of an inexperienced log cabin
builder helped another time-consuming

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:00.519
but important task was to make tools and
jigs for the ongoing projects for example

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.950
I made an improvised workbench from a
fallen pine tree the workbenche's legs

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.630
are the trees branches and roots then I
made a canopy roof above the work bench

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:15.970
so as far as I'm concerned it is a
woodworking shop you could have seen this

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.430
tarp in my other video the
tarp that was torn by a Yeti at least

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.590
this is what most people suggested under it these improvised saw horses were

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.620
also made quickly to save time I used Y-shaped sticks for its legs when you're

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.740
in a rush the functionality of a jig
becomes the priority you might have seen

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.830
my makeshift vise used for chainsaw
sharpening before I recently combined it

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:48.840
with this pneumatic wedge and got myself
a nice adjustable bushcraft vise that I

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.550
ended up using for different tasks this
summer because of its fine adjustment

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:59.810
feature there is no risk to over
tightening something in with this device

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.300
you might have noticed an unusual round
window in my log cabin I like this

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.340
non-traditional look if someone tries to
break this window they will be up for a

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.169
surprise I installed a 1/2 inch (12 mm) Plexiglas into the cabin's

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:22.020
wall I might even make a double window
with a window hatch later some will

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.060
probably think I'm building a fortress
here's a question how do you guys think

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.970
I made this perfectly round porthole?
this is a problem nobody quite solved

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.770
since I have posted it on my Instagram
talk to me in the comment section I'd

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:44.729
love to hear how you would do it as you
can see there is still a lot of work

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:51.090
that needs to be done inside I still
need to make bushcraft style furniture

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:56.640
to match the log cabin's style but first I
need to make and install the back door

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:01.470
I'm thinking about what design would be
the best perhaps I will go with the

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:05.460
French door for a change I just need to
figure out how to make it

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.770
energy-efficient the front door turned
out nicely there are virtually no gaps

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.960
around it once the log cabin is
furnished inside I'm planning to spend a

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.320
few weeks in it in January which means
the log cabin needs a wood stove I

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.860
decided to build the cabins heating
system starting from a chimney it will

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.750
be an unusual wooden chimney made from
two hollowed log halves that are connected

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:34.439
with wire clamps
the chimney will not penetrate the roof

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:39.210
but will leave the house underground
and will stand outside the cabin this

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:45.030
way the roof will not have a potential
weak point where it could leak and the

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.860
chimney won't take precious space inside
the cabin

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:55.580
such chimney design will also allow me to
cold-smoke fish underground as a bonus

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:00.750
once done I'm planning to make a
stationary wood stove using rocks and

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:06.689
clay meanwhile I'm using my portable
metal stove to cook food and to stay

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:15.060
warm and dry as it was raining during my
most stay this summer you might think I

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:20.669
spent most of my stay to build the log
cabin this is not entirely true the most

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:26.819
time-consuming project this summer was
transporting and planting trees during

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:32.729
the last few years I planted over 250
deciduous trees around my camp to

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:37.919
replenish the ones that were knocked
down by a severe storm most of the tree

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:43.379
saplings are growing in three nurseries
around my log cabin camp I planted

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:49.139
Alligan Birches,Indigo trees, Amur
Velvet trees, White Acacia trees, German

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:55.500
Medlar trees, Red Bud Cercis, Scarlet
Red Maple, Manchurian Walnut trees and

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:58.860
a few more names
I either forgot or their tree saplings

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:06.479
didn't make it to this day to be precise
I spent at least seven full days at my

00:08:06.479 --> 00:08:10.650
three nurseries this summer
this estimate doesn't include the time

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:16.080
and effort of growing these saplings
from seeds and transporting them to my

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:24.270
camp by boat however I believe the final
result is well worth the effort I'm

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.800
planning to make a separate video about
how to grow trees from seeds and make

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:36.990
money doing it last year I made a packframe from a few planks bird cherry

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:43.880
branches two straps from my old backpack
and some PET rope cut from a bottle

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.230
the time spent making it was well worth
it

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:52.040
my packframe saved me a lot of time and
effort this season

00:08:52.040 --> 00:09:00.290
I used it extensively to transport soil
heavy tools my metal oven tree saplings

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:05.870
and even long heavy wooden slabs for my
cabin doors construction if you don't

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:16.190
have one I highly recommend you to
consider obtaining or making a packframe one of this video's goals is to
get the advice for what videos you would

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:20.839
like me to make first I have more than
20 projects that were filmed but they're

00:09:20.839 --> 00:09:25.069
still awaiting to be edited and
published I know I won't have time to

00:09:25.069 --> 00:09:28.970
publish them all which is why your
opinion will help me to prioritize my

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:35.449
efforts I'm asking you to help me to
make that choice but in order to give me

00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:39.740
a valid recommendation please finish
watching this video there are still a

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:46.699
few good project spoilers ahead when you
do one activity for a while it tends to

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:52.970
get boring which is why I try to work
with multiple projects at once this

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:58.310
summer I built another catamaran and a
new composite kayak in addition to my

00:09:58.310 --> 00:10:05.089
old inflatable floaters / duffle bags
catamaran you probably have noticed that

00:10:05.089 --> 00:10:11.990
my new composite kayak has two latches
one on each end this kayak can be used

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:18.439
as is or can be included into a
catamaran's frame last year I already made

00:10:18.439 --> 00:10:24.589
a catamaran but didn't have much time to
test it even though my plastic wrap

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:30.230
kayak is fairly reliable and would work
as is I decided to reinforce it with a

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:37.310
couple of extra ribs and stringers as well
as to reinforce the kayak's skin I used

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:43.040
synthetic fabric and polymer resin to
mold a hardshell over its branch frame

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:50.560
and plastic skin now the kayak won't
leak even if you hit an underwater rock

00:10:50.560 --> 00:11:00.459
I have extensively tested this new model
kayak running over rocks and floating

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:07.269
logs the new shell didn't even budge
this is my first experience in molding

00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:13.480
fabric with polymer resin the next kayak
will be even better I already have plans

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:19.899
for it and the new model will be a part
of a sailing catamaran here is an idea I

00:11:19.899 --> 00:11:24.339
have in mind I want to make a watch
tower that would be taller than the pine

00:11:24.339 --> 00:11:29.740
tree I use to get my phone reception in
the woods I need to get about 10 feet (3

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:34.779
meters) above this pine for more stable
phone reception I'm going to use long

00:11:34.779 --> 00:11:41.529
sticks and wire clamps to build this
makeshift phone tower if you liked this

00:11:41.529 --> 00:11:45.639
video perhaps you could share it with
your friends let good people watch good

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:51.639
videos this is Max Egorov st.
Petersburg Russia and a final note I

00:11:51.639 --> 00:11:57.069
only produce on one or two videos max a
month and if you don't want to miss new

00:11:57.069 --> 00:12:02.139
content like this you can click on the
bell reminder for notifications I hope

00:12:02.139 --> 00:12:05.550
to see back on Advoko MAKES...
