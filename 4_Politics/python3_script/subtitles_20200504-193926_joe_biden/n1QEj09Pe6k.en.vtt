00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.330
 This is a video from the publisher of Wendover, produced by Audible 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.760
 Recently, I have been busy with nothing, check the old flight schedule. 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.269
 Airlines often publish these timetable booklets with fares and flight times 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.950
 When I saw the timetable issued by American Airlines in 1967, I found an interesting thing 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:25.660
 From the timetable, the flight time from New York to Los Angeles is 5 hours and 43 minutes 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:26.660
 But this may not be the case 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.330
 American Airlines Flight 3 departs from New York JFK Airport at 12 noon 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.860
 And arrived in Los Angeles at 2:43 in the afternoon. There is a time difference of 3 hours 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.210
 Today, American Airlines Flight 3 still takes off from New York JFK Airport at noon 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.920
 But the difference is that the time to arrive in Los Angeles is 3:27 pm 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.510
 44 minutes more than it was in 1967 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.620
 In fact, this is a universal phenomenon. Almost all flights are more than in the 1960s 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.350
 Flight time is longer. 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.690
 Generally speaking, the flight time in the true sense, that is, the actual time spent by the plane flying in the air, is the same. 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.390
 But now, the congestion and delays at the airport and the ground have been counted in the flight time, which caused the flight time to be extended. 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.950
 Even so, in any case, the plane we took was indeed flying slower. 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.700
 In 1967, humans had not yet landed on the moon, and the computers at that time still seemed to fill the entire room like this. 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.290
 But at that time, wherever we flew, we were as fast as now, even faster than now. 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.690
 Why hasn't the flight speed increased in the past 50 years, but has become slower? 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.510
 First look at three commonly used aircraft engines: turboprop engines (turboprop engines), turbofan engines (turbofan engines) and turbojet engines (turbojet engines). 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.070
 Each engine has a most economical flight speed range 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.630
 You can see this turboprop on most aircraft with propellers 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.400
 For this kind of engine, almost all the thrust comes from the propeller 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.030
 Although the turbine used to drive the propeller can suck in and accelerate part of the air flow, 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.200
 But the air flow rate from the engine is not very fast, so the engine exhaust can only contribute less than 10% of the thrust 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.920
 As far as turboprop engines are concerned, because of their low purchase and operating costs, many short-distance regional commuter aircraft 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.340
 All use turboprops as power 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.770
 Of course, no aircraft using this engine can fly very fast. 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.260
 The most economical speed of turboprop engines is between 325 miles per hour and 375 miles per hour. 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.600
 If you need to fly faster, it is best to use a turbofan engine 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.819
 Now you can see turbofan engines everywhere 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:22.200
 Most commercial aircraft are powered by turbofan engines. 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.290
 Turbo fan, as the name implies, air first needs to flow through a fan 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.040
 As you can see in front of the engine 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.480
 Then part of the air will flow into the internal combustion chamber 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.810
 Push the turbine to do work, used to drive the fan. A part of the air will pass through the periphery of the turbine. 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.550
 The part of the air passing from the periphery of the turbine actually passes through the outside duct. This part of the air is also accelerated 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.540
 And the main thrust of the turbofan engine is provided by the airflow ejected from the inner channel 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.920
 Most modern airplanes fly between 400-620 miles per hour, which is also the most economical speed of turbofan engines 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.709
 If you want to fly at supersonic speeds, which means that the speed exceeds 767 miles per hour, you need a turbojet engine (turbojet engine). 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.680
 Turbojet engines are very similar to turbofan engines. The difference is that all air flows through the turbine. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.100
 No external culvert 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.620
 This allows the aircraft to reach very fast speeds, but at the cost of consuming a lot of fuel 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.500
 The turbojet engine's economic speed is between 1300-1400 miles per hour 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.180
 What really determines the efficiency of the aircraft engine is a value, called the "bypass ratio" 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.220
 This is the ratio of the external culvert air flow and the engine core (internal tract) air flow 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.269
 This is the ratio of the external culvert air flow and the engine core (internal tract) air flow 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.569
 This is the case. In fact, driving a larger fan does not need to consume too much energy. 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.500
 But if you need more air to enter the engine, you need to increase the fuel supply 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.319
 In other words, under the same energy consumption, if more air can flow through the external culvert, you can get more thrust 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.680
 Therefore, this is like a law, that is, the greater the bypass ratio, the higher the engine efficiency 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.550
 Check out this GE GEnx engine 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.519
 This is a new ultra-high efficiency engine used on Boeing 787 Dreamliner and Boeing 747-8i Intercontinental airliner. 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:01.400
 You can see that the size of the fan is much larger than the turbine 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.280
 This is because this engine has a bypass ratio of 10:1. Means the air flow around the turbine (external duct) 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.020
 10 times the flow into the turbine 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:14.680
 In comparison, the efficiency of the older CFM56 engine produced by CFM International is lower 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.969
 You can see that the size of the fan is not so big compared to the turbine 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:24.430
 Because the bypass ratio of this engine is only 5.9:1, but it still belongs to the large bypass ratio 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.009
 If compared with Pratt &amp; Whitney's JT8D engine, the gap will be more obvious 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:36.330
 Because the bypass ratio of the JT8D engine is only 0.96:1, its efficiency is even lower 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.020
 But still much more efficient than Rolls-Royceâ€™s Olympus 593 engine 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.289
 Because the 593 engine is a turbojet engine 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.680
 As I said before, in the case of turbojet engines, all the air must pass through the turbine 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.540
 No external culvert 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:58.319
 Therefore, the bypass ratio of the turbojet engine is 0:1, also known as "no external bypass engine" 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:02.839
 Since 100% of the air passes through the engine and through the turbine, this leads to 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:10.050
 Need to consume more fuel. Fuel consumption is higher than the previously introduced GEnx, CFM56, and even JT8D engines 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:18.289
 The Concorde airliner uses a non-ducted Rolls-Royce Olympus 593 engine. Every 1 mile (1.61 km) of Concorde 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:24.879
 21.25 kg of fuel will be burned. In contrast, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner uses a GEnx engine with a bypass ratio of 10:1 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:31.300
 Each mile (1.61 kilometers) burns only 8.5 kg of fuel. However, even when compared to medium-sized aircraft like the Boeing 787, the Concorde 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.969
 Can only be regarded as a small plane 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:39.189
 Concorde can only take 100 people, but 787 Dreamliner can take 291 people 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:44.080
 This can be calculated by the amount of fuel consumed by each person in a Concorde, each person consumes 17 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers of flight 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.369
 The Boeing 787 Dreamliner consumes only 2.3 liters of fuel per 100 kilometers of flight 

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:53.059
 In the end, Air France and British Airways, the only two airlines operating Concorde aircraft 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:55.310
 Also unable to undertake the flight of the Concorde 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.020
 Because less than 1/3 of the passengers actually bought a ticket to take the Concorde 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.360
 The remaining passengers are redeemed using accumulated journeys or transferred from first class on other flights 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.189
 After all, a Concorde flight costs at least US$7,500 today to buy a one-way ticket from London to New York 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:18.090
 The flight time is only 3 hours. But the seat is like this 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.169
 There is almost no difference from the seats of the economy class of today's aircraft 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:25.819
 When the Concorde aircraft just asked the city, the first class of other aircraft was like this 

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:30.539
 Although it looks beautiful, this is just a widened economy class seat 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:31.779
 It is really difficult to sleep on such a seat 

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:37.159
 However, when the Concorde retired from operation in 2003, the first-class seats became like this, 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:39.509
 And it can be spread out like a bed 

00:06:39.509 --> 00:06:45.189
 So many people would choose to spend 7 hours on such a seat, rather than squeeze on a small seat like the Concorde 

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:47.069
 Spend 3 hours 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:51.890
 In 2000, British Airways introduced this fully reclining seat even in business class 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.839
 But the fare is much lower than the Concorde. When flying over the Atlantic Ocean, travelers can lie flat and sleep 

00:06:58.179 --> 00:07:00.599
 Therefore, riding a Concorde is no longer a luxury. 

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:05.449
 The original intention of designing Concorde was to provide business people with an efficient way to cross the Atlantic 

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:10.159
 However, if the seat can lie completely flat, passengers flying to Europe 

00:07:10.159 --> 00:07:15.689
 You can leave the United States at night, sleep on the plane, and wake up to Europe 

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:17.479
 Actually did not waste time 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:22.889
 Neither luxurious nor efficient, the Concorde completed its last commercial flight on October 24, 2003 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:28.319
 And declared the end of the era of supersonic commercial flight 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.930
 Also, airlines really donâ€™t care much about flight speed 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.990
 Flying speed is just a selling point to attract customers 

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:40.759
 The cost of the aircraft itself is only a fraction of the total flight cost. 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:44.759
 Therefore, airlines will not use the method of increasing speed to increase the number of times the aircraft is used 

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:50.039
 Generally speaking, the life of the aircraft is related to the takeoff and landing cycle, that is, to the number of aircraft takeoffs and landings 

00:07:50.039 --> 00:07:54.959
 The Boeing 787 Dreamliner can withstand 44,000 takeoffs and landings. The Boeing 787's suggested selling price is usually higher than the actual selling price 

00:07:54.959 --> 00:08:00.020
 Much higher, each aircraft reached $224.6 million 

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.300
 This means that each take-off and landing will cost more than 5000 dollars. 

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.979
 Coupled with fuel costs, from New York to London, fuel costs also exceeded 15,000 US dollars 

00:08:09.979 --> 00:08:15.270
 Therefore, airlines let the aircraft fly at the most fuel efficient speed possible 

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:21.259
 This speed is almost always within the range of 500-550 miles per hour 

00:08:21.259 --> 00:08:27.159
 The consequence of this is that the flight speed is much lower than the speed of sound-767 miles per hour 

00:08:27.159 --> 00:08:30.439
 Why can't the plane fly close to the speed of sound? 

00:08:30.439 --> 00:08:34.500
 This chart shows the resistance of the aircraft at different speeds 

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.409
 Between 0.8 and 1.2 Mach belongs to the "transonic" range (1 Mach is equivalent to 1 times the speed of sound) 

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:44.930
 Within this range, the airflow around the aircraft is not completely subsonic or supersonic. 

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:48.660
 Essentially, some airflows have exceeded the speed of sound, but there are still some airflows that have not reached the speed of sound 

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:54.750
 So starting from Mach 0.8, part of the airflow has exceeded the speed of sound, which will increase the resistance sharply 

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:59.441
 And reduce the aircraft's handling stability. So flying at speeds close to the speed of sound is very dangerous 

00:08:59.441 --> 00:09:03.129
 You need to fly far above the speed of sound or far below the speed of sound to be safe 

00:09:03.129 --> 00:09:06.940
 When the plane is flying at transonic speed, you can see this phenomenon 

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.980
 Look at these stripes especially like scratches on the camera lens. Although this is hard to see. 

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:14.459
 These stripes are actually miniature supersonic shock waves 

00:09:14.459 --> 00:09:20.020
 Because of the considerable resistance to air flow, when flying at a speed of 0.8 to 1.2 Mach 

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:26.870
 It actually consumes more fuel than flying above Mach 1.2. This is why we have the number 613.8 mph 

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:32.560
 This number is almost the speed limit of a modern subsonic jet 

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:37.500
 Although it is cool and exciting to take a supersonic flight across the Atlantic in 3 hours 

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:43.740
 But as far as airlines are concerned, what they really want is to be as fast as jumping into a pond and have a profit of 100 or 200 dollars in minutes. 

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:47.290
 And this is now easier to achieve. 

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:53.750
 The speed of the aircraft today has allowed us to fly to any place on earth within 24 hours 

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:55.680
 This is fast enough for most people 

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.660
 For most people, the real factor restricting travel is cost, not speed. and so 

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:06.860
 Aircraft manufacturers and airlines will continue to work to reduce travel costs, not travel time 

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:13.540
 One last word. Time is the enemy of very few privileged people. And cost is the enemy of most people 

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.300
 This video was made by Audible. 

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:20.209
 Audible is a leading online audio provider, but I believe you have heard of it before. 

00:10:20.209 --> 00:10:22.060
 So I will only tell you how I use audible 

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:26.029
 I like reading but there are times when I cannot read paper books 

00:10:26.029 --> 00:10:30.440
 For example, when working, cooking or even editing videos. So I downloaded a lot of audio books 

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.580
 Through Audible, I can learn no matter what I do 

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:38.390
 If you like me to listen to something while working, you can make boring work more interesting 

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:44.819
 I recently started listening to Skyfaring, this is a book written by 747 pilot Mark Vanhoenacker 

00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:48.160
 Allows you to understand the flight from the perspective of a pilot, but it reads more like reading a novel or memoir 

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.430
 Not as boring as reading a lot of professional books 

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.420
 The main thing is that you can listen to this book for free now. 

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.410
 Audible gives you 30 days of free trial time, you can log in to the Audible.com/Wendover link to get it
