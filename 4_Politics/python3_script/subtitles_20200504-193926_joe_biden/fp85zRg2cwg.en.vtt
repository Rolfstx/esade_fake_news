00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:03.967
Speaker:
Mr. President,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:03.967 --> 00:00:09.600
history is more than the
path left by the past.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.700
It influences the present
and can shape the future.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.033
We meet today in
Westminster Hall,

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:23.567
a building begun 900 years ago
when the Vikings were visiting

00:00:23.567 --> 00:00:28.300
the shores of what would
become the United States,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.233
even if it was Columbus who
would subsequently demonstrate

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:36.066
the politician's art
of arriving late,

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:37.800
but claiming all the credit.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.767
(laughter)

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:45.033
This hall has witnessed grim
trials in the sentencing to

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:51.533
death of a king, coronation
banquets, ceremonial addresses,

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:56.000
and the coffins of those
receiving the last respects of

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.266
our people.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:04.700
Few places reach so far into
the heart of our nation.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:11.333
Yet until today, no American
president has stood on these

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:16.433
steps to address our
country's Parliament.

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:23.600
It is my honor, Mr. President,
to welcome you as our friend and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.266
as a statesman.

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:33.033
Statesmanship is the cement
which seals our shared idealism

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:34.000
as nations.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.767
It makes meaningful the unity of
ambition, passion for freedom,

00:01:38.767 --> 00:01:43.333
and abhorrence of injustice
that is the call of our

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.467
close alliance.

00:01:45.467 --> 00:01:52.133
It has fallen to you to tackle
economic turbulence at home,

00:01:52.133 --> 00:01:57.867
to protect the health
of those without wealth,

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:03.734
and to seek that precious
balance between security which

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:09.233
is too often threatened, and
human rights which are too

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:12.200
often denied.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.367
History is not the burden of
any one man or woman alone.

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:23.133
But some are called to
meet a special share of

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:25.400
it's challenges.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.800
It is a duty that you discharge
with a dignity, determination,

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.967
and distinction that
are widely admired.

00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:42.200
Abraham Lincoln once observed
that nearly all men can

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.200
stand adversity.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.367
But if you want to test a man's
character, give him power.

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:55.233
Ladies and gentlemen, the
President of the United States

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:58.233
of America, Barack Obama.

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:16.400
(applause)

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:17.934
President Obama:
Thank you very much.

00:03:17.934 --> 00:03:24.533
(applause)

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:25.567
Thank you very much.

00:03:25.567 --> 00:03:26.567
Thank you.

00:03:26.567 --> 00:03:27.967
(applause)

00:03:27.967 --> 00:03:28.967
Thank you.

00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:30.600
(applause)

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.767
Thank you so much.

00:03:31.767 --> 00:03:35.633
(applause)

00:03:35.633 --> 00:03:44.633
My Lord Chancellor, Mr. Speaker,
Mr. Prime Minister, my lords,

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:48.433
and members of the
House of Commons:

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:55.233
I have known few greater honors
than the opportunity to address

00:03:55.233 --> 00:04:00.066
the Mother of Parliaments
at Westminster Hall.

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:04.333
I am told that the last three
speakers here have been the

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:11.166
Pope, Her Majesty the
Queen, and Nelson Mandela --

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:15.367
which is either a very high
bar or the beginning of a very

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:16.533
funny joke.

00:04:16.533 --> 00:04:28.266
(laughter)

00:04:28.266 --> 00:04:34.834
I come here today to
reaffirm one of the oldest,

00:04:34.834 --> 00:04:40.033
one of the strongest alliances
the world has ever known.

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:42.467
It's long been said that the
United States and the United

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:47.633
Kingdom share a
special relationship.

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:51.900
And since we also share an
especially active press corps,

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.233
that relationship is often
analyzed and overanalyzed

00:04:56.233 --> 00:05:01.734
for the slightest hint
of stress or strain.

00:05:01.734 --> 00:05:05.734
Of course, all relationships
have their ups and downs.

00:05:05.734 --> 00:05:10.367
Admittedly, ours got off on the
wrong foot with a small scrape

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:12.567
about tea and taxes.

00:05:12.567 --> 00:05:14.633
(laughter)

00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:17.867
There may also have been
some hurt feelings when the

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:21.400
White House was set on fire
during the War of 1812.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.633
(laughter)

00:05:23.633 --> 00:05:28.934
But fortunately, it's been
smooth sailing ever since.

00:05:28.934 --> 00:05:31.934
The reason for this close
friendship doesn't just have

00:05:31.934 --> 00:05:36.867
to do with our shared history,
our shared heritage;

00:05:36.867 --> 00:05:39.967
our ties of language
and culture;

00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:44.367
or even the strong partnership
between our governments.

00:05:44.367 --> 00:05:47.767
Our relationship is special
because of the values and

00:05:47.767 --> 00:05:54.000
beliefs that have united
our people through the ages.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.333
Centuries ago, when
kings, emperors,

00:05:57.333 --> 00:06:01.333
and warlords reigned
over much of the world,

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:04.200
it was the English who first
spelled out the rights and

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.633
liberties of man
in the Magna Carta.

00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:12.900
It was here, in this very hall,
where the rule of law first

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.066
developed, courts
were established,

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:20.567
disputes were settled, and
citizens came to petition

00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:23.633
their leaders.

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:26.734
Over time, the people of
this nation waged a long and

00:06:26.734 --> 00:06:29.767
sometimes bloody struggle
to expand and secure their

00:06:29.767 --> 00:06:33.567
freedom from the crown.

00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:36.233
Propelled by the ideals
of the Enlightenment,

00:06:36.233 --> 00:06:40.033
they would ultimately forge
an English Bill of Rights,

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:45.467
and invest the power to govern
in an elected parliament that's

00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:48.900
gathered here today.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.867
What began on this island would
inspire millions throughout the

00:06:52.867 --> 00:06:57.433
continent of Europe
and across the world.

00:06:57.433 --> 00:07:00.767
But perhaps no one drew greater
inspiration from these notions

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:05.033
of freedom than your
rabble-rousing colonists

00:07:05.033 --> 00:07:08.967
on the other side
of the Atlantic.

00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:11.867
As Winston Churchill
said, the "...Magna Carta,

00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:15.867
the Bill of Rights, Habeas
Corpus, trial by jury,

00:07:15.867 --> 00:07:20.166
and English common law find
their most famous expression in

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:25.333
the American Declaration
of Independence."

00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:31.300
For both of our nations, living
up to the ideals enshrined in

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:37.033
these founding documents has
sometimes been difficult,

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:39.967
has always been a
work in progress.

00:07:39.967 --> 00:07:43.033
The path has never been perfect.

00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:47.734
But through the struggles
of slaves and immigrants,

00:07:47.734 --> 00:07:52.767
women and ethnic minorities,
former colonies and persecuted

00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:56.433
religions, we have learned
better than most that the

00:07:56.433 --> 00:08:00.934
longing for freedom and human
dignity is not English or

00:08:00.934 --> 00:08:07.667
American or Western
-- it is universal,

00:08:07.667 --> 00:08:12.133
and it beats in every heart.

00:08:12.133 --> 00:08:16.867
Perhaps that's why there are
few nations that stand firmer,

00:08:16.867 --> 00:08:22.033
speak louder, and fight harder
to defend democratic values

00:08:22.033 --> 00:08:28.600
around the world than the United
States and the United Kingdom.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.967
We are the allies who
landed at Omaha and Gold,

00:08:32.967 --> 00:08:35.700
who sacrificed side by side to
free a continent from the march

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:42.066
of tyranny, and help prosperity
flourish from the ruins of war.

00:08:42.066 --> 00:08:47.700
And with the founding of
NATO -- a British idea --

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:50.934
we joined a transatlantic
alliance that has ensured our

00:08:50.934 --> 00:08:55.333
security for over
half a century.

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:58.533
Together with our allies,
we forged a lasting peace

00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:01.266
from a cold war.

00:09:01.266 --> 00:09:04.367
When the Iron Curtain lifted, we
expanded our alliance to include

00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:07.700
the nations of Central
and Eastern Europe,

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.266
and built new bridges to Russia
and the former states of the

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:15.000
Soviet Union.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.767
And when there was
strife in the Balkans,

00:09:16.767 --> 00:09:21.467
we worked together
to keep the peace.

00:09:21.467 --> 00:09:27.200
Today, after a difficult decade
that began with war and ended in

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:32.266
recession, our nations have
arrived at a pivotal moment

00:09:32.266 --> 00:09:35.266
once more.

00:09:35.266 --> 00:09:38.800
A global economy that once stood
on the brink of depression is

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:42.400
now stable and recovering.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.333
After years of conflict, the
United States has removed

00:09:46.333 --> 00:09:50.500
100,000 troops from Iraq, the
United Kingdom has removed its

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:55.367
forces, and our combat
mission there has ended.

00:09:55.367 --> 00:09:58.800
In Afghanistan, we've broken the
Taliban's momentum and will soon

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.734
begin a transition
to Afghan lead.

00:10:03.734 --> 00:10:06.367
And nearly 10 years after 9/11,
we have disrupted terrorist

00:10:06.367 --> 00:10:10.367
networks and dealt al Qaeda a
huge blow by killing its leader

00:10:10.367 --> 00:10:13.900
-- Osama bin Laden.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:19.834
Together, we have
met great challenges.

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:23.667
But as we enter this new
chapter in our shared history,

00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:28.467
profound challenges
stretch out before us.

00:10:28.467 --> 00:10:31.400
In a world where the prosperity
of all nations is now

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.200
inextricably linked, a new era
of cooperation is required to

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.533
ensure the growth and stability
of the global economy.

00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:46.100
As new threats spread
across borders and oceans,

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.667
we must dismantle terrorist
networks and stop the spread

00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:52.467
of nuclear weapons, confront
climate change and combat

00:10:52.467 --> 00:10:56.467
famine and disease.

00:10:56.467 --> 00:10:59.000
And as a revolution races
through the streets of the

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.900
Middle East and North Africa,
the entire world has a stake

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.467
in the aspirations of a
generation that longs to

00:11:05.467 --> 00:11:10.667
determine its own destiny.

00:11:10.667 --> 00:11:13.734
These challenges come at a time
when the international order has

00:11:13.734 --> 00:11:18.300
already been reshaped
for a new century.

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:22.033
Countries like China, India,
and Brazil are growing by

00:11:22.033 --> 00:11:25.400
leaps and bounds.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.266
We should welcome
this development,

00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:30.367
for it has lifted hundreds of
millions from poverty around

00:11:30.367 --> 00:11:34.300
the globe, and created new
markets and opportunities

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:37.633
for our own nations.

00:11:37.633 --> 00:11:39.900
And yet, as this rapid
change has taken place,

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:44.233
it's become fashionable in some
quarters to question whether the

00:11:44.233 --> 00:11:48.433
rise of these nations will
accompany the decline of

00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:53.667
American and European
influence around the world.

00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:58.100
Perhaps, the argument goes,
these nations represent the

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:05.467
future, and the time for
our leadership has passed.

00:12:05.467 --> 00:12:09.266
That argument is wrong.

00:12:09.266 --> 00:12:13.567
The time for our
leadership is now.

00:12:13.567 --> 00:12:15.934
It was the United States and
the United Kingdom and our

00:12:15.934 --> 00:12:19.233
democratic allies that shaped a
world in which new nations could

00:12:19.233 --> 00:12:23.367
emerge and individuals
could thrive.

00:12:23.367 --> 00:12:27.200
And even as more nations take on
the responsibilities of global

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.834
leadership, our alliance will
remain indispensable to the goal

00:12:32.834 --> 00:12:35.734
of a century that
is more peaceful,

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:41.567
more prosperous and more just.

00:12:41.567 --> 00:12:44.033
At a time when threats and
challenges require nations

00:12:44.033 --> 00:12:45.834
to work in concert
with one another,

00:12:45.834 --> 00:12:51.433
we remain the greatest
catalysts for global action.

00:12:51.433 --> 00:12:54.033
In an era defined by the
rapid flow of commerce and

00:12:54.033 --> 00:12:59.834
information, it is our free
market tradition, our openness,

00:12:59.834 --> 00:13:03.467
fortified by our commitment to
basic security for our citizens,

00:13:03.467 --> 00:13:06.533
that offers the best chance
of prosperity that is both

00:13:06.533 --> 00:13:10.633
strong and shared.

00:13:10.633 --> 00:13:13.333
As millions are still denied
their basic human rights because

00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:15.467
of who they are, or
what they believe,

00:13:15.467 --> 00:13:17.900
or the kind of government
that they live under,

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:21.800
we are the nations most willing
to stand up for the values of

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:30.233
tolerance and self-determination
that lead to peace and dignity.

00:13:30.233 --> 00:13:34.700
Now, this doesn't mean we
can afford to stand still.

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:40.667
The nature of our leadership will
need to change with the times.

00:13:40.667 --> 00:13:43.600
As I said the first time I
came to London as President,

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.467
for the G20 summit, the days
are gone when Roosevelt and

00:13:47.467 --> 00:13:50.800
Churchill could sit in a room
and solve the world's problems

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.667
over a glass of brandy --
although I'm sure that Prime

00:13:54.667 --> 00:13:59.033
Minister Cameron would agree
that some days we could both

00:13:59.033 --> 00:14:00.133
use a stiff drink.

00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:03.567
(laughter)

00:14:03.567 --> 00:14:06.867
In this century, our joint
leadership will require

00:14:06.867 --> 00:14:12.667
building new partnerships,
adapting to new circumstances,

00:14:12.667 --> 00:14:19.200
and remaking ourselves to meet
the demands of a new era.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:24.000
That begins with our
economic leadership.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.667
Adam Smith's central insight
remains true today: There is no

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:32.633
greater generator of wealth and
innovation than a system of free

00:14:32.633 --> 00:14:36.700
enterprise that unleashes the
full potential of individual

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.533
men and women.

00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:41.567
That's what led to the
Industrial Revolution that began

00:14:41.567 --> 00:14:44.800
in the factories of Manchester.

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.333
That is what led to the dawn of
the Information Age that arose

00:14:47.333 --> 00:14:52.500
from the office parks
of Silicon Valley.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:56.033
That's why countries like China,
India and Brazil are growing so

00:14:56.033 --> 00:14:59.133
rapidly -- because
in fits and starts,

00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:01.867
they are moving toward
market-based principles that

00:15:01.867 --> 00:15:08.633
the United States and the United
Kingdom have always embraced.

00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:12.734
In other words, we live in a
global economy that is largely

00:15:12.734 --> 00:15:15.433
of our own making.

00:15:15.433 --> 00:15:18.133
And today, the competition for
the best jobs and industries

00:15:18.133 --> 00:15:20.266
favors countries that
are free-thinking and

00:15:20.266 --> 00:15:24.667
forward-looking; countries with
the most creative and innovative

00:15:24.667 --> 00:15:27.867
and entrepreneurial citizens.

00:15:27.867 --> 00:15:30.600
That gives nations like the
United States and the United

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:35.133
Kingdom an inherent advantage.

00:15:35.133 --> 00:15:40.433
For from Newton and Darwin
to Edison and Einstein,

00:15:40.433 --> 00:15:46.033
from Alan Turing to Steve Jobs,
we have led the world in our

00:15:46.033 --> 00:15:50.066
commitment to science and
cutting-edge research,

00:15:50.066 --> 00:15:53.900
the discovery of new
medicines and technologies.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.500
We educate our citizens and
train our workers in the best

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.900
colleges and
universities on Earth.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.967
But to maintain this advantage
in a world that's more

00:16:03.967 --> 00:16:09.166
competitive than ever, we will
have to redouble our investments

00:16:09.166 --> 00:16:13.166
in science and engineering, and
renew our national commitments

00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:17.734
to educating our workforces.

00:16:17.734 --> 00:16:20.367
We've also been reminded in the
last few years that markets can

00:16:20.367 --> 00:16:23.700
sometimes fail.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:26.600
In the last century, both our
nations put in place regulatory

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.367
frameworks to deal with such
market failures -- safeguards

00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:33.900
to protect the banking system
after the Great Depression,

00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.166
for example; regulations that
were established to prevent the

00:16:37.166 --> 00:16:43.166
pollution of our air and
our water during the 1970s.

00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:48.433
But in today's economy, such
threats of market failure can

00:16:48.433 --> 00:16:53.734
no longer be contained within
the borders of any one country.

00:16:53.734 --> 00:16:58.533
Market failures can go
global, and go viral,

00:16:58.533 --> 00:17:02.967
and demand international responses.

00:17:02.967 --> 00:17:05.767
A financial crisis that began
on Wall Street infected nearly

00:17:05.767 --> 00:17:09.567
every continent, which is why we
must keep working through forums

00:17:09.567 --> 00:17:12.700
like the G20 to put in place
global rules of the road to

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:17.767
prevent future
excesses and abuse.

00:17:17.767 --> 00:17:20.767
No country can hide from the
dangers of carbon pollution,

00:17:20.767 --> 00:17:24.467
which is why we must build on
what was achieved at Copenhagen

00:17:24.467 --> 00:17:27.166
and Cancun to leave our
children a planet that

00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:32.233
is safer and cleaner.

00:17:32.233 --> 00:17:36.700
Moreover, even when the free
market works as it should,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.133
both our countries recognize
that no matter how responsibly

00:17:40.133 --> 00:17:44.900
we live in our lives,
hard times or bad luck,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:50.166
a crippling illness or a layoff
may strike any one of us.

00:17:50.166 --> 00:17:53.033
And so part of our common
tradition has expressed itself

00:17:53.033 --> 00:17:56.633
in a conviction that every
citizen deserves a basic measure

00:17:56.633 --> 00:18:01.433
of security -- health
care if you get sick,

00:18:01.433 --> 00:18:04.967
unemployment insurance
if you lose your job,

00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:10.533
a dignified retirement after
a lifetime of hard work.

00:18:10.533 --> 00:18:14.066
That commitment to our citizens
has also been the reason for our

00:18:14.066 --> 00:18:17.967
leadership in the world.

00:18:17.967 --> 00:18:20.066
And now, having come through
a terrible recession,

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:24.000
our challenge is to meet these
obligations while ensuring that

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.700
we're not consuming -- and hence
consumed -- with a level of debt

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.600
that could sap the strength
and vitality of our economies.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.800
And that will require difficult
choices and it will require

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.467
different paths for
both of our countries.

00:18:40.467 --> 00:18:44.333
But we have faced such
challenges before,

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:46.834
and have always been able to
balance the need for fiscal

00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:50.734
responsibility with the
responsibilities we have

00:18:50.734 --> 00:18:53.700
to one another.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.867
And I believe we
can do this again.

00:18:57.867 --> 00:19:00.934
As we do, the successes and
failures of our own past can

00:19:00.934 --> 00:19:05.533
serve as an example for emerging
economies -- that it's possible

00:19:05.533 --> 00:19:11.567
to grow without polluting; that
lasting prosperity comes not

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:13.867
from what a nation consumes,
but from what it produces,

00:19:13.867 --> 00:19:17.066
and from the investments
it makes in its people

00:19:17.066 --> 00:19:21.700
and its infrastructure.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.233
And just as we must lead on
behalf of the prosperity of

00:19:24.233 --> 00:19:29.767
our citizens, so we must
safeguard their security.

00:19:29.767 --> 00:19:36.133
Our two nations know what it is
to confront evil in the world.

00:19:36.133 --> 00:19:38.734
Hitler's armies would not have
stopped their killing had we not

00:19:38.734 --> 00:19:43.266
fought them on the beaches
and on the landing grounds,

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:48.333
in the fields and
on the streets.

00:19:48.333 --> 00:19:51.433
We must never forget that there
was nothing inevitable about our

00:19:51.433 --> 00:19:54.800
victory in that terrible war.

00:19:54.800 --> 00:20:00.667
It was won through the courage
and character of our people.

00:20:00.667 --> 00:20:03.333
Precisely because we are
willing to bear its burden,

00:20:03.333 --> 00:20:06.934
we know well the cost of war.

00:20:06.934 --> 00:20:09.033
And that is why we built an
alliance that was strong enough

00:20:09.033 --> 00:20:15.600
to defend this continent
while deterring our enemies.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:19.233
At its core, NATO is rooted in
the simple concept of Article

00:20:19.233 --> 00:20:24.133
Five: that no NATO nation
will have to fend on its own;

00:20:24.133 --> 00:20:29.033
that allies will stand
by one another, always.

00:20:29.033 --> 00:20:31.500
And for six decades, NATO
has been the most successful

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.734
alliance in human history.

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:39.967
Today, we confront
a different enemy.

00:20:39.967 --> 00:20:42.967
Terrorists have taken the lives
of our citizens in New York and

00:20:42.967 --> 00:20:45.200
in London.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.734
And while al Qaeda seeks a
religious war with the West,

00:20:48.734 --> 00:20:53.100
we must remember that they have
killed thousands of Muslims --

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:57.133
men, women and children
-- around the globe.

00:20:57.133 --> 00:21:01.166
Our nations are not and will
never be at war with Islam.

00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:04.200
Our fight is focused on
defeating al Qaeda and

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:07.333
its extremist allies.

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:09.667
In that effort, we
will not relent,

00:21:09.667 --> 00:21:14.467
as Osama bin Laden and his
followers have learned.

00:21:14.467 --> 00:21:17.967
And as we fight an enemy
that respects no law of war,

00:21:17.967 --> 00:21:22.300
we will continue to hold
ourselves to a higher standard

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:27.600
-- by living up to the values,
the rule of law and due process

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:32.734
that we so ardently defend.

00:21:32.734 --> 00:21:36.633
For almost a decade, Afghanistan
has been a central front of

00:21:36.633 --> 00:21:39.066
these efforts.

00:21:39.066 --> 00:21:44.734
Throughout those years,
you, the British people,

00:21:44.734 --> 00:21:48.734
have been a stalwart ally, along
with so many others who fight by

00:21:48.734 --> 00:21:51.800
our side.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.133
Together, let us pay tribute to
all of our men and women who

00:21:55.133 --> 00:21:59.734
have served and sacrificed over
the last several years -- for

00:21:59.734 --> 00:22:02.700
they are part of an unbroken
line of heroes who have borne

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:07.800
the heaviest burden for the
freedoms that we enjoy.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:12.934
Because of them, we have
broken the Taliban's momentum.

00:22:12.934 --> 00:22:15.667
Because of them, we have
built the capacity of

00:22:15.667 --> 00:22:19.000
Afghan security forces.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.734
And because of them, we are now
preparing to turn a corner in

00:22:21.734 --> 00:22:25.834
Afghanistan by transitioning
to Afghan lead.

00:22:25.834 --> 00:22:28.400
And during this transition, we
will pursue a lasting peace with

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.000
those who break free of al
Qaeda and respect the Afghan

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.166
constitution and lay down arms.

00:22:34.166 --> 00:22:37.100
And we will ensure that
Afghanistan is never a safe

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:41.300
haven for terror, but is instead
a country that is strong,

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:48.100
sovereign, and able to
stand on its own two feet.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.767
Indeed, our efforts in this
young century have led us to

00:22:50.767 --> 00:22:54.200
a new concept for NATO that will
give us the capabilities needed

00:22:54.200 --> 00:23:00.266
to meet new threats -- threats
like terrorism and piracy,

00:23:00.266 --> 00:23:03.867
cyber attacks and
ballistic missiles.

00:23:03.867 --> 00:23:06.633
But a revitalized NATO will
continue to hew to that original

00:23:06.633 --> 00:23:12.266
vision of its founders, allowing
us to rally collective action

00:23:12.266 --> 00:23:15.500
for the defense of our people,
while building upon the broader

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.500
belief of Roosevelt and
Churchill that all nations

00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.400
have both rights and
responsibilities,

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.400
and all nations share a common
interest in an international

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:30.300
architecture that
maintains the peace.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.834
We also share a common interest
in stopping the spread of

00:23:32.834 --> 00:23:36.033
nuclear weapons.

00:23:36.033 --> 00:23:39.400
Across the globe, nations are
locking down nuclear materials

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:43.400
so they never fall into
the wrong hands -- because

00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:46.433
of our leadership.

00:23:46.433 --> 00:23:50.567
From North Korea to Iran, we've
sent a message that those who

00:23:50.567 --> 00:23:53.533
flaunt their obligations will
face consequences -- which is

00:23:53.533 --> 00:23:56.900
why America and the European
Union just recently strengthened

00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:03.467
our sanctions on Iran, in large
part because of the leadership

00:24:03.467 --> 00:24:08.567
of the United Kingdom
and the United States.

00:24:08.567 --> 00:24:11.200
And while we hold
others to account,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.133
we will meet our own obligations
under the Non-Proliferation

00:24:14.133 --> 00:24:21.467
Treaty, and strive for a world
without nuclear weapons.

00:24:21.467 --> 00:24:24.166
We share a common interest in
resolving conflicts that prolong

00:24:24.166 --> 00:24:31.333
human suffering and threaten
to tear whole regions asunder.

00:24:31.333 --> 00:24:34.834
In Sudan, after years of
war and thousands of deaths,

00:24:34.834 --> 00:24:37.467
we call on both North and South
to pull back from the brink of

00:24:37.467 --> 00:24:42.233
violence and choose
the path of peace.

00:24:42.233 --> 00:24:45.734
And in the Middle East, we stand
united in our support for a

00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:53.233
secure Israel and a
sovereign Palestine.

00:24:53.233 --> 00:24:56.734
And we share a common interest
in development that advances

00:24:56.734 --> 00:25:00.500
dignity and security.

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:02.834
To succeed, we must cast
aside the impulse to look

00:25:02.834 --> 00:25:07.567
at impoverished parts of the
globe as a place for charity.

00:25:07.567 --> 00:25:09.900
Instead, we should empower the
same forces that have allowed

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.700
our own people to thrive: We
should help the hungry to feed

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:18.600
themselves, the doctors
who care for the sick.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.900
We should support countries
that confront corruption,

00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.233
and allow their
people to innovate.

00:25:24.233 --> 00:25:26.834
And we should advance the truth
that nations prosper when they

00:25:26.834 --> 00:25:33.367
allow women and girls to
reach their full potential.

00:25:33.367 --> 00:25:38.100
We do these things because we
believe not simply in the rights

00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:44.767
of nations; we believe in
the rights of citizens.

00:25:44.767 --> 00:25:47.166
That is the beacon that guided
us through our fight against

00:25:47.166 --> 00:25:50.200
fascism and our twilight
struggle against communism.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:54.100
And today, that idea is being
put to the test in the Middle

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:59.066
East and North Africa.

00:25:59.066 --> 00:26:02.633
In country after country,
people are mobilizing to

00:26:02.633 --> 00:26:07.900
free themselves from the
grip of an iron fist.

00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:12.333
And while these movements for
change are just six months old,

00:26:12.333 --> 00:26:16.433
we have seen them play out
before -- from Eastern Europe

00:26:16.433 --> 00:26:23.467
to the Americas, from South
Africa to Southeast Asia.

00:26:23.467 --> 00:26:27.166
History tells us that
democracy is not easy.

00:26:27.166 --> 00:26:29.700
It will be years before these
revolutions reach their

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:35.000
conclusion, and there will be
difficult days along the way.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.900
Power rarely gives up without a
fight -- particularly in places

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:44.333
where there are divisions of
tribe and divisions of sect.

00:26:44.333 --> 00:26:48.300
We also know that populism can
take dangerous turns -- from the

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.533
extremism of those who would
use democracy to deny minority

00:26:51.533 --> 00:26:55.166
rights, to the nationalism that
left so many scars on this

00:26:55.166 --> 00:26:59.033
continent in the 20th century.

00:26:59.033 --> 00:27:04.066
But make no mistake:
What we saw,

00:27:04.066 --> 00:27:09.000
what we are seeing in Tehran,
in Tunis, in Tahrir Square,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.700
is a longing for the same
freedoms that we take for

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:15.667
granted here at home.

00:27:15.667 --> 00:27:18.433
It was a rejection of the notion
that people in certain parts of

00:27:18.433 --> 00:27:22.567
the world don't want to be
free, or need to have democracy

00:27:22.567 --> 00:27:25.467
imposed upon them.

00:27:25.467 --> 00:27:28.300
It was a rebuke to the
worldview of al Qaeda,

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.633
which smothers the
rights of individuals,

00:27:30.633 --> 00:27:33.066
and would thereby subject
them to perpetual poverty

00:27:33.066 --> 00:27:35.900
and violence.

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:40.867
Let there be no doubt: The
United States and United Kingdom

00:27:40.867 --> 00:27:47.767
stand squarely on the side of
those who long to be free.

00:27:47.767 --> 00:27:50.800
And now, we must show that
we will back up those words

00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.133
with deeds.

00:27:54.133 --> 00:27:57.266
That means investing in the
future of those nations that

00:27:57.266 --> 00:28:02.467
transition to democracy,
starting with Tunisia and Egypt

00:28:02.467 --> 00:28:05.800
-- by deepening ties
of trade and commerce;

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:11.967
by helping them demonstrate
that freedom brings prosperity.

00:28:11.967 --> 00:28:16.567
And that means standing
up for universal rights

00:28:16.567 --> 00:28:19.667
-- by sanctioning those
who pursue repression,

00:28:19.667 --> 00:28:22.700
strengthening civil
society, supporting

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:27.333
the rights of minorities.

00:28:27.333 --> 00:28:33.033
We do this knowing that the West
must overcome suspicion and

00:28:33.033 --> 00:28:38.066
mistrust among many in the
Middle East and North Africa

00:28:38.066 --> 00:28:43.100
-- a mistrust that is
rooted in a difficult past.

00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:46.233
For years, we've faced charges
of hypocrisy from those who do

00:28:46.233 --> 00:28:52.300
not enjoy the freedoms
that they hear us espouse.

00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:55.100
And so to them, we must
squarely acknowledge that, yes,

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:58.633
we have enduring interests in
the region -- to fight terror,

00:28:58.633 --> 00:29:02.600
sometimes with partners
who may not be perfect;

00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:08.266
to protect against disruptions
of the world's energy supply.

00:29:08.266 --> 00:29:12.533
But we must also insist that
we reject as false the choice

00:29:12.533 --> 00:29:16.934
between our interests
and our ideals;

00:29:16.934 --> 00:29:21.033
between stability and democracy.

00:29:21.033 --> 00:29:26.166
For our idealism is rooted in
the realities of history -- that

00:29:26.166 --> 00:29:32.500
repression offers only the
false promise of stability,

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.800
that societies are more
successful when their citizens

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:45.700
are free, and that democracies
are the closest allies we have.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:51.333
It is that truth that
guides our action in Libya.

00:29:51.333 --> 00:29:56.066
It would have been easy at the
outset of the crackdown in Libya

00:29:56.066 --> 00:30:00.767
to say that none of this was
our business -- that a nation's

00:30:00.767 --> 00:30:03.066
sovereignty is more important
than the slaughter of civilians

00:30:03.066 --> 00:30:07.367
within its borders.

00:30:07.367 --> 00:30:13.834
That argument carries
weight with some.

00:30:13.834 --> 00:30:17.200
But we are different.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:22.000
We embrace a broader responsibility.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.800
And while we cannot
stop every injustice,

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:30.133
there are circumstances that cut
through our caution -- when a

00:30:30.133 --> 00:30:33.367
leader is threatening
to massacre his people,

00:30:33.367 --> 00:30:38.266
and the international community
is calling for action.

00:30:38.266 --> 00:30:43.400
That's why we stopped
a massacre in Libya.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:47.867
And we will not relent until the
people of Libya are protected

00:30:47.867 --> 00:30:53.533
and the shadow of
tyranny is lifted.

00:30:53.533 --> 00:30:57.867
We will proceed with humility,
and the knowledge that we cannot

00:30:57.867 --> 00:31:01.200
dictate every outcome abroad.

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.834
Ultimately, freedom must be
won by the people themselves,

00:31:03.834 --> 00:31:08.100
not imposed from without.

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:13.400
But we can and must stand
with those who so struggle.

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.100
Because we have always believed
that the future of our children

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.233
and grandchildren will be better
if other people's children and

00:31:20.233 --> 00:31:26.667
grandchildren are more
prosperous and more free

00:31:26.667 --> 00:31:29.934
-- from the beaches of Normandy
to the Balkans to Benghazi.

00:31:29.934 --> 00:31:36.600
That is our interests
and our ideals.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.066
And if we fail to meet
that responsibility,

00:31:40.066 --> 00:31:45.333
who would take our place,
and what kind of world would

00:31:45.333 --> 00:31:50.867
we pass on?

00:31:50.867 --> 00:31:55.533
Our action -- our leadership
-- is essential to the cause

00:31:55.533 --> 00:31:58.133
of human dignity.

00:31:58.133 --> 00:32:01.600
And so we must
act -- and lead --

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.033
with confidence in our ideals,
and an abiding faith in the

00:32:04.033 --> 00:32:10.533
character of our people,
who sent us all here today.

00:32:10.533 --> 00:32:13.900
For there is one final quality
that I believe makes the United

00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:17.867
States and the United
Kingdom indispensable

00:32:17.867 --> 00:32:20.633
to this moment in history.

00:32:20.633 --> 00:32:26.667
And that is how we define
ourselves as nations.

00:32:26.667 --> 00:32:27.800
Unlike most countries
in the world,

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:34.567
we do not define citizenship
based on race or ethnicity.

00:32:34.567 --> 00:32:38.667
Being American or British is not
about belonging to a certain

00:32:38.667 --> 00:32:46.000
group; it's about believing
in a certain set of ideals --

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.333
the rights of individuals,
the rule of law.

00:32:52.333 --> 00:32:58.967
That is why we hold incredible
diversity within our borders.

00:32:58.967 --> 00:33:01.033
That's why there are people
around the world right now

00:33:01.033 --> 00:33:03.266
who believe that if
they come to America,

00:33:03.266 --> 00:33:05.567
if they come to New York,
if they come to London,

00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:11.500
if they work hard, they can
pledge allegiance to our flag

00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:15.700
and call themselves Americans;
if they come to England,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:21.700
they can make a new life for
themselves and can sing God

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:28.200
Save The Queen just
like any other citizen.

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.500
Yes, our diversity
can lead to tension.

00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.967
And throughout our history there
have been heated debates about

00:33:33.967 --> 00:33:39.834
immigration and assimilation
in both of our countries.

00:33:39.834 --> 00:33:41.967
But even as these
debates can be difficult,

00:33:41.967 --> 00:33:46.066
we fundamentally recognize that
our patchwork heritage is an

00:33:46.066 --> 00:33:50.800
enormous strength -- that in
a world which will only grow

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:56.667
smaller and more interconnected,
the example of our two nations

00:33:56.667 --> 00:34:01.633
says it is possible for people
to be united by their ideals,

00:34:01.633 --> 00:34:05.500
instead of divided
by their differences;

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:11.000
that it's possible for hearts to
change and old hatreds to pass;

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.734
that it's possible for the sons
and daughters of former colonies

00:34:14.734 --> 00:34:19.400
to sit here as members
of this great Parliament,

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.300
and for the grandson of a Kenyan
who served as a cook in the

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:25.600
British Army to stand
before you as President

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.300
of the United States.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:47.100
(applause)

00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.200
That is what defines us.

00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:56.467
That is why the young men and
women in the streets of Damascus

00:34:56.467 --> 00:35:01.500
and Cairo still reach for the
rights our citizens enjoy,

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:06.133
even if they sometimes
differ with our policies.

00:35:06.133 --> 00:35:09.500
As two of the most powerful
nations in the history of the

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.700
world, we must always remember
that the true source of our

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:17.633
influence hasn't just been
the size of our economies,

00:35:17.633 --> 00:35:23.600
or the reach of our militaries,
or the land that we've claimed.

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:27.066
It has been the values that we
must never waver in defending

00:35:27.066 --> 00:35:32.300
around the world -- the idea
that all beings are endowed

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:38.867
by our Creator with certain
rights that cannot be denied.

00:35:38.867 --> 00:35:43.867
That is what forged our bond
in the fire of war -- a bond

00:35:43.867 --> 00:35:46.533
made manifest by the
friendship between two

00:35:46.533 --> 00:35:50.533
of our greatest leaders.

00:35:50.533 --> 00:35:54.266
Churchill and Roosevelt
had their differences.

00:35:54.266 --> 00:35:57.567
They were keen observers of
each other's blind spots and

00:35:57.567 --> 00:36:02.166
shortcomings, if not
always their own,

00:36:02.166 --> 00:36:04.233
and they were hard-headed
about their ability to

00:36:04.233 --> 00:36:08.133
remake the world.

00:36:08.133 --> 00:36:12.467
But what joined the fates of
these two men at that particular

00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:16.100
moment in history was not simply
a shared interest in victory on

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.033
the battlefield.

00:36:19.033 --> 00:36:21.500
It was a shared belief in the
ultimate triumph of human

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:28.333
freedom and human dignity -- a
conviction that we have a say

00:36:28.333 --> 00:36:33.300
in how this story ends.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:40.200
This conviction lives on
in their people today.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:43.300
The challenges we
face are great.

00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:46.967
The work before us is hard.

00:36:46.967 --> 00:36:49.834
But we have come through
a difficult decade,

00:36:49.834 --> 00:36:52.500
and whenever the tests and
trials ahead may seem too big

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.200
or too many, let us
turn to their example,

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.734
and the words that Churchill
spoke on the day that Europe was

00:36:59.734 --> 00:37:05.300
freed: "In the
long years to come,

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:10.000
not only will the people of this
island but...the world, wherever

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.767
the bird of freedom
chirps in the human heart,

00:37:13.767 --> 00:37:16.567
look back to what we've done,
and they will say 'do not

00:37:16.567 --> 00:37:23.266
despair, do not yield...
march straightforward.'"

00:37:23.266 --> 00:37:28.600
With courage and purpose,
with humility and with hope,

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:31.700
with faith in the
promise of tomorrow,

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:37.500
let us march
straightforward together,

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:42.433
enduring allies in the cause of
a world that is more peaceful,

00:37:42.433 --> 00:37:46.133
more prosperous, and more just.

00:37:46.133 --> 00:37:47.233
Thank you very much.

00:37:47.233 --> 00:38:50.900
(applause)

00:38:53.867 --> 00:38:59.333
Speaker:
Mr. President, I think that
response describes far more

00:38:59.333 --> 00:39:06.600
eloquently than any words of
mine could do how much that very

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:13.500
memorable and inspiring address
was appreciated by everybody who

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.867
heard it here today.

00:39:16.867 --> 00:39:17.967
You spoke --

00:39:17.967 --> 00:39:29.000
(applause)

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.867
You spoke with great warmth
and great generosity about the

00:39:34.867 --> 00:39:39.834
British Parliament and the
British people and about the

00:39:39.834 --> 00:39:46.000
links that bind us, the
values and the traditions

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.100
that we share.

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:52.734
The history that we have
experienced together.

00:39:52.734 --> 00:39:57.500
But more than that, you
spoke too not just of the

00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:03.266
relationships of the past, but
the relationships of the future.

00:40:03.266 --> 00:40:10.467
And I think that was what made
what you said so inspirational.

00:40:10.467 --> 00:40:18.867
It was a distinguished American
governor of New York who

00:40:18.867 --> 00:40:24.500
remarked on the propensity of
politicians to campaign in

00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:30.533
poetry, but to govern in prose.

00:40:30.533 --> 00:40:36.000
The world you described to us
today was not just one that is

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.400
prosaic; it was one where the
challenges are difficult and

00:40:41.400 --> 00:40:44.066
sometimes dangerous.

00:40:44.066 --> 00:40:48.567
One that is fast
moving, that is complex,

00:40:48.567 --> 00:40:51.233
sometimes contradictory.

00:40:51.233 --> 00:40:59.433
And that offers at least as
many threats as opportunities.

00:40:59.433 --> 00:41:03.600
But in the eloquence
of your address,

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:08.200
you reminded us of the
importance of maintaining the

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.033
poetry in government.

00:41:12.033 --> 00:41:18.767
Because to lead, that
poetry is necessary.

00:41:18.767 --> 00:41:24.166
Necessary not only to
articulate the challenges,

00:41:24.166 --> 00:41:27.700
as you did so masterfully.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:33.200
But also to bring others
together to face those

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.100
challenges with common
principles and with

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:39.533
shared purpose.

00:41:39.533 --> 00:41:45.467
Mr. President, it has been a
