00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
- You know, so we're watching the story

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.580
about the Toy Hall of Fame,
which is in Rochester.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.340
And we're seeing all the
toys that are being inducted

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.660
and so everyone in the
office starts talking

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.980
about their favorite
toys growing up, right?

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.460
So some people are like "Oh yeah, no

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.140
for me it was Shoots and Ladders,

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.420
and for me it was the sled,

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.027
and for me it was this, it was that."

00:00:18.027 --> 00:00:19.057
And then, the people were like,

00:00:19.057 --> 00:00:21.590
"What was your favorite,
favorite toy growing up?"

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:22.800
And I was like, "Genuinely,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.854
my favorite toy growing up was a brick."

00:00:25.854 --> 00:00:26.687
(audience laughs)

00:00:26.687 --> 00:00:28.820
All right, which sounds crazy

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.003
but, Spinny why do you
walk away like I'm a crazy?

00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:33.836
(audience laughs)

00:00:33.836 --> 00:00:34.930
like you literally walk away

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.530
like I'm saying the wildest thing.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.630
No cause we, so what happened was no,

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.700
we had, when we were growing up I'd live

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.690
at my Gran's house in Soweto,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.020
and then what would happen is,

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.380
a lot of kids didn't have toys,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.410
but it wasn't like a sad thing

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.360
like "Oh, I don't have toys."

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.870
It was like we'd play
with whatever we find.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.980
And so the most popular
thing little boys would play

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.370
with was bricks, and your brick was,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.890
you'd play with it like a toy car.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.490
So you'd walk around the
neighborhood searching

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.030
for the best brick, all right?

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.880
'Cause the game you would play,

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.110
we didn't put wheels on it or anything,

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.083
like someone asked in the office,

00:01:00.083 --> 00:01:00.916
they're like, "Did you put wheels on?"

00:01:00.916 --> 00:01:02.720
No, there's no wheels, where
were we gonna find wheels?

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.226
If we have wheels, we
wouldn't have these problems.

00:01:04.226 --> 00:01:06.310
(audience laughs)
So we just took bricks,

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.390
so you would find bricks,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.170
and then the game you'd
play is you'd drive around

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.800
in the dirt with your brick car,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.430
and then you would smash
into the other boys' bricks,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.020
and then if your brick was
the last brick standing,

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.340
you won the game.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.750
So, like all of us, it was like a mission.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:19.987
You're like, "Man, I gotta
find bricks, I gotta."

00:01:19.987 --> 00:01:22.320
You just walk around the
whole day, just searching

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.290
for bricks, and there's this one brick

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.450
that we had called a
face brick, all right?

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.410
Which is basically like
a really beautiful brick

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.843
that you can, you know bricks
that you don't plaster over?

00:01:29.843 --> 00:01:31.810
'Cause you have that as
the face of your house,

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.190
that's why you would call
it the face brick, right?

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.897
And so, that was like the dream brick.

00:01:34.897 --> 00:01:37.110
It was the most expensive brick, though.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.420
You couldn't, you'd find everyone

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.200
with gray bricks and the dark black bricks

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.960
and all those, but those bricks break.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.790
You come with a face brick,
everyone would see you,

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.340
you'd pitch up, you'd be
like a pimp rolling up

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.330
in a Rolls-Royce Phantom, like genuinely.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.390
I remember one day I found the face brick,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.190
and you know I got the, all the
kids were like (car noises).

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.627
And I've got the little
swag, and they're like,

00:01:57.627 --> 00:01:59.310
"Oh Trevor, are you
playing, are you playing?"

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.380
And then I was like, "Yeah."

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.720
and I pulled my brick
out from behind my back.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.570
And they're like (gasps)
"Face brick, face brick."

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.547
And it's like, "Now he has
a face brick, face brick."

00:02:07.547 --> 00:02:08.730
And it's like, "Let's go."

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:10.480
And then you drive, and
then everyone rams in,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.380
and I'll be like, "You guys
ram me first, I'll just chill."

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.910
And everyone tries to ram your brick,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.770
and because it's a face brick,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.900
it's compact, it doesn't crack,

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.300
and everyone's brick crack in half,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.560
people are devastated.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.393
You see kids smash their brick,

00:02:21.393 --> 00:02:22.880
and the brick cracks dead in the middle,

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.123
and they're like (cries dramatically)

00:02:25.123 --> 00:02:27.731
(cries out in foreign language)

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:28.650
It's like a big thing.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.450
And then you'd play, and
you'd take the brick,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.290
and it was such a popular thing

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.140
that you had to be careful
if you lived in the townships

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.300
because kids would steal
bricks from outside your house

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.110
if you were doing renovations,

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.300
so if you weren't careful,

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.810
you would have all your bricks outside,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.400
'cause you're like, "Oh
I'm gonna build a wall."

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.470
And then the next day
you would come there,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.205
and you'd be like, "Where
the fuck are my bricks?"

00:02:47.205 --> 00:02:48.130
(audience laughs)

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.141
And all the bricks are gone,

00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:52.607
and there's just kids driving
around, like (car noises).

00:02:53.563 --> 00:02:54.727
It's like, "Are those my bricks?"

00:02:54.727 --> 00:02:57.190
"I don't know what you're
talking about, man.

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.120
This is my favorite toy."

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.040
It just makes you realize,
you can just have fun

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.990
with anything, man, it was,
that was genuinely my favorite.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.760
Even now when I see bricks, I get happy.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.030
Like I said to friends,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.830
that's the one thing I
don't like about living

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.140
in New York, you don't see bricks often,

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.730
just loose bricks hanging around.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.617
You take that for granted,
I walk around, I'm like,

00:03:16.617 --> 00:03:19.220
"Man, no bricks, no bricks,
no bricks, no bricks."

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.320
And if I see a brick,
there's a thing in me still

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.270
to this day that wants to take the brick,

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.103
and I have to stop myself and be like,

00:03:24.103 --> 00:03:25.573
"You're the host of 'The Daily Show'.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.770
You can buy all the bricks you want."

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:30.100
And it's like, "Yeah, but
take that brick Trevor,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.180
come on, you know you want to."

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.160
And I was thinking, imagine
if TMZ caught me on camera,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.910
and it's like, "Trevor Noah
spotted stealing a brick."

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:38.897
And then I'd be trying to explain it,

00:03:38.897 --> 00:03:41.087
"No, it's a car, no it's not a" (laughs)

00:03:41.087 --> 00:03:42.517
"Is Trevor Noah oh drugs?"

00:03:42.517 --> 00:03:45.967
"No wait, it's so strong."

00:03:46.957 --> 00:03:47.790
"What were you doing Trevor?"

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.467
"I was gonna build my own wall."

00:03:49.467 --> 00:03:51.290
(audience laughs)

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.300
That's what South Africa, you guys,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.650
you should let Donald
Trump build the wall,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.431
and then just bring all the
South African kids overnight.

00:03:56.431 --> 00:03:58.213
(audience claps and laughs)

00:03:58.213 --> 00:04:01.110
And they'll just like take the.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.190
So in my grandmother's house,

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.950
we didn't have a tap in the house.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:06.250
We had one tap shared amongst four houses,

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.660
and that seemed cool
compared to my cousins

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.410
because in the villages, they had one tap,

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:12.820
which was like a mile away.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.384
So I'd go to my cousins to visit them

00:04:14.384 --> 00:04:18.860
for the holidays, and then I would,

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.970
my cousin would wake me up at like 5 a.m.,

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.803
I'd be like, "Dude, what are you doing?"

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.430
He's like, "We gotta go get water."

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:24.387
And I'm like, "What?"

00:04:24.387 --> 00:04:26.070
And then you get the wheelbarrow,

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.700
and then you go, and it's fun
when you're on the way there

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:28.830
'cause you're like, "This is fun."

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.640
You've got your
wheelbarrow, you're rolling.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.140
And then you fill up,
you forget that you have

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.385
to fill them up with water.

00:04:33.385 --> 00:04:36.090
So these giant, giant,
giant drums of water,

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.130
and then you bring them back,

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.100
and your like, "Fuck."

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.933
The whole time, you're just like,

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:42.600
"I don't need water, I don't need water."

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.070
And then one day I took,

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.170
'cause my cousin was shredded
just because of that.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.040
Every single day was just
him lifting a barrel.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.870
It was like 400 pounds on a wheelbarrow,

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.770
just pushing that every single day.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.110
And then one day I remember,
I was like, "I can do this."

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.180
And I took it, and I was
like, "Oh, oh, oh oh"

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.963
And then all the water gone.

00:04:58.963 --> 00:05:00.430
(audience gasps)
Just like all of it.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.710
And then I was like, "Well, well,

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.599
you shouldn't have let
me take the wheelbarrow."

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:06.480
I just pulled a Ben Carson,

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:07.970
I was like, "That was your bad."

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:09.660
Did I know my life
would turn out like this

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.710
since I was a kid?

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember
when I was like four years old,

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.020
and there was like this
little kid who pushed me

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.877
to the ground, and then I was like,

00:05:17.877 --> 00:05:21.240
"Ha, one day I'm gonna be the
host of 'The Daily Show'."

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.380
No, I get what you're saying,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.710
and I'm joking obviously,
I'm being facetious.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.350
No, I had no clue.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.319
Nor did I wish for that,
I'll be honest with you.

00:05:28.319 --> 00:05:31.330
I was, I still joke with my
mom about that 'til this day.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.110
I go, "I did not know
where life would take me,

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.570
or how life would end up.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:37.500
All I knew is that I
wanted to be able to afford

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.520
to buy as much food as I wanted to buy.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.500
Like at any time."

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.623
That was the big time in my life.

00:05:43.623 --> 00:05:46.564
'Cause when you don't
have money in a family,

00:05:46.564 --> 00:05:49.805
the food decision is the
biggest decision you can make.

00:05:49.805 --> 00:05:50.970
So let me put it this way.

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:54.970
We would go out for
take-out maybe once a month

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:56.130
if we're lucky,

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.070
and I remember the
pressure that I was under

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.770
'cause you'd get the menu,

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.680
and then they'd be like,
"Do you want a burger

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.577
or do you want pizza or,"

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.390
and I was just like (groans)
"Don't mess this up,

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.360
don't mess this up."

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:10.170
It was such a big decision.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.557
And I remember one day, I
said to my mom, I was like,

00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:14.261
"One day I'm gonna be
rich enough to buy two."

00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:16.020
(audience coos)

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.381
And then my mom could have
been like, "Shut up kid."

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:20.270
But she was like, "Yeah, you
will be rich enough, yeah."

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.660
And I was like, "And I'll buy dessert."

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.660
She's like, "You go buy all the dessert.

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:25.797
All of the dessert."

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.563
And so then now, my mom was like,

00:06:28.563 --> 00:06:31.110
"Did you buy the dessert,
did you buy the dessert?"

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.950
And then she point at my tummy,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.680
and she's like, "Look like
you bought the dessert."

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.770
In Africa, like so my mom,

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.760
she would let me watch
a sex scene in a movie,

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.300
she would be like, "I
don't care about that."

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.410
But if kids were playing with food,

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.140
she'd make me turn the movie off.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.410
So whenever, so whenever there's like,

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.860
I used to watch those high school movies,

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.310
those American movies, and then you know,

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:51.120
there'd always be a food
fight in the cafeteria.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.770
Then my mom would be like,
"Turn it off, turn it off."

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.603
And then I'd be like, "What you mean?"

00:06:54.603 --> 00:06:55.749
She's like, "Why they wasting food?"

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:56.582
Then I was like, "It's a movie."

00:06:56.582 --> 00:06:59.160
She's like, "But it's
real food, it's real food.

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.990
It's real food, how can
you waste food like that?"

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.300
And then I was, it's
like my mom was going,

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:05.180
you know parents will go,
"There's children starving."

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.780
My mom as like, "We
are starving in Africa.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.050
We are starving, why
are they wasting food?"

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.820
The first time I remember hearing a joke

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.290
as a child was actually,
I was with my grandfather,

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:20.290
and we were at a protest in
the streets in South Africa.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.490
And I don't know what the protest was for,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:24.090
I'm assuming it was
anti-apartheid or whatever.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.920
But I was very young, and
I was with my grandfather,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.800
and we're walking, marching
through the streets,

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.120
and a policeman came by on a horse.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.570
And policemen on horses is like, yo you,

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.770
like no one is comfortable,
do you know what I mean?

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.923
Just generally, as black
people, we're never like, "Yay,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:41.570
yay, he's gonna do the thing."

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:44.848
No, you were terrified of
a policeman on a horse.

00:07:44.848 --> 00:07:48.310
And this guy was trying to
move the crowd along, move,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.450
and he's like, "Move, move,
bloody hell, move, move."

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.130
And he got to my grandfather,

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.592
and then my grandfather turned to him,

00:07:53.592 --> 00:07:54.425
and the guy looked at
him, and he was like,

00:07:54.425 --> 00:07:55.258
"Hey, why aren't you moving."

00:07:55.258 --> 00:07:56.835
And my grandfather turned to
him, and he said, he said,

00:07:56.835 --> 00:08:01.835
"Master, master, can
I ask you a question?"

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.290
And this guy was like, "What,
what, what did you say?"

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:08.363
He said, "Can I ask you
a question, master?"

00:08:09.242 --> 00:08:11.080
And it was like, and then
he asked him a question,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.780
and to give you the context,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.033
that weekend, the previous weekend,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:20.580
there was our version of the
Kentucky Derby took place,

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.610
and then the winning horse was celebrated,

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:25.130
and the president went and gave a kiss

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.513
to the horse that won,
and liked kissed him,

00:08:26.513 --> 00:08:28.610
and was on the front
page of the newspaper,

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:29.940
the president kissing the horse.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.040
And so then, so that's the context.

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.190
So my grandfather turns
to the cop, and he's like,

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:35.540
"Can I ask you a question?"

00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.400
and the cop is like,
"What, what do you want?"

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.650
And he says, "Master, why is it

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.770
that your president can kiss a horse,

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:47.216
but he won't kiss my sister?"

00:08:47.216 --> 00:08:50.550
(audience laughs)

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:52.760
And like, you could see
the cop was just like,

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.593
he's like, "What?"

00:08:53.593 --> 00:08:55.717
And he's like, "What, I don't know."

00:08:57.210 --> 00:08:59.540
And I was like, and then my
grandfather turned to me,

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.357
and he's like, "Because you
haven't seen my sister."

00:09:02.357 --> 00:09:06.024
(audience laughs and claps)

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.530
And I'll never forget
the policeman's face,

00:09:11.530 --> 00:09:13.400
he burst into tears laughing,

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.233
'cause he was like, "What?"

00:09:14.233 --> 00:09:15.430
And then he just started laughing,

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.490
and my grandfather was laughing,

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:19.300
and I'd never seen, two
things I had never seen,

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:22.290
like a policeman laughing
with black people ever before,

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:23.820
that was my first time seeing that.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:25.580
And it was just my first time seeing

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.667
how a joke could diffuse
tension, you know what I mean?

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:29.440
And then I just remember growing up,

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.900
I was like, "Oh I want to
do that thing, I wanna.

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.720
Yeah, I wanna do that thing more."

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.593
Diapers, I hate changing diapers.

00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:40.023
I don't have kids, but I
just hate changing diapers.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:41.913
I have two younger brothers,

00:09:41.913 --> 00:09:43.600
so I changed their diapers
when I was growing up.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.330
And then at some point
with my youngest brother,

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:47.530
who's 20 years younger than me,

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.820
I was just like, "You're just,
you're gonna keep shitting,

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.170
so just don't wear pants."

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.150
and I was like, "It's easier
to pooper scoop this person

00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:57.420
than it is."

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.790
So then my little brother would just come,

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.883
I'd teach him, the thing was,

00:09:59.883 --> 00:10:01.170
he'd just come running up to me,

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.050
and then he'd be like, "Trevor, poo poo."

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.160
And then I'd be like, "Aight."

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.680
And then we'd just run outside,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.520
and then I'd make him shit in the garden,

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.450
like I would, I would fold him,

00:10:09.450 --> 00:10:11.450
I'd hold his legs and his body,

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:13.140
and then I'd hold him like this,

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.420
and then he'd be like a
little turtle in my hands,

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.510
and then I would hold him,
and then he would shit,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.560
and then he'd be like,
"Doo doos, doo doos."

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.393
And then I'd be like, "Finished?"

00:10:21.393 --> 00:10:22.226
And he's like, "Doo doos."

00:10:22.226 --> 00:10:23.059
Then I'm like, "All right cool."

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:25.010
And then I shake him a little bit,

00:10:25.010 --> 00:10:27.840
and then I'd take him,
yeah, and then I'd take him,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:29.520
and he'd stand, and
then I'd spray him down

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.820
with a hose pipe, so take him,

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:33.190
and he loved it, he was like

00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:35.240
this is the greatest experience ever.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.137
And then I'd be like,

00:10:36.137 --> 00:10:38.820
"Just don't tell mom what we're doing."

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.006
And then he'd always tell mom.

00:10:41.006 --> 00:10:43.380
He'd always be like,
"Mommy, Trevor sprayed me

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.320
with the hose pipe."

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:47.160
Then I'm like, "Jesus, kid,
you're killing me here."

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.993
He would love it.

00:10:47.993 --> 00:10:49.207
It was just like a fun,
and then I remember,

00:10:49.207 --> 00:10:51.300
one of the funniest things was like a year

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.133
or something later.

00:10:52.133 --> 00:10:54.090
We're sitting together watching TV,

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.560
and we're watching footage
of police spraying people

00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.430
with, like, protesters
with the water hoses.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:01.263
And then he looks at me,

00:11:01.263 --> 00:11:02.540
he's like, "Trevor, did they doo doos?"

00:11:02.540 --> 00:11:07.540
Then I'm like (laughs)
I'm like, "No." (laughs)

00:11:07.578 --> 00:11:10.393
So in my family, my two
younger brothers are,

00:11:12.012 --> 00:11:13.890
so from my mother's second marriage,

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:15.720
and so I'm still the only person

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.830
in my family that looks like this.

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:20.940
So my mom is an African
woman, black Xhosa woman,

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:22.450
my father's Swiss from Switzerland,

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.670
so he's a white man,
and so I look like this.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:26.130
And then my mom remarried a black man,

00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:28.130
and so my brothers don't
look like me either.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.290
And I remember what was
really beautiful was,

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:31.920
my brother's, we always
spoke about this stuff.

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:33.360
My parents, they were like,
"Yeah, different dads,

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.470
we get how this works."

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.060
So my brother one day,

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.580
I pick him up from school.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.880
He's really young at the time,

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.640
he was what, maybe like, trying think,

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.630
he was 9, maybe 10 years old,

00:11:42.630 --> 00:11:45.120
and he gets in the car
and he just deflates.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.690
And he gets in the passenger seat,

00:11:46.690 --> 00:11:48.307
and he fastens his seatbelt, and I'm like,

00:11:48.307 --> 00:11:49.140
"What's going on Isaac?"

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.420
And he's like, "Trevor."

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:54.187
He's like, "Oh, kids, man,
I can't do this, kids."

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.170
So I go, "Kids, tell me more."

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.000
And then he's like, "I
just, I just don't know

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.960
what to do with kids, Trevor, you know?

00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.353
Like today, one of my friends said,

00:12:04.353 --> 00:12:05.500
'Oh, are we walking home?'

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.350
Then I said, 'No, my
brother's picking me up.'

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.803
Then he said, 'Ah, who's your brother.'

00:12:08.803 --> 00:12:10.340
And I sad, 'Trevor.'

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:12.260
Then now when we're walking,
he sees you in the car,

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.660
then he says, 'Who's that?'

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.690
Then I say, 'It's my brother.'

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:17.180
Then he says, 'Ah, but
how can your brother,

00:12:17.180 --> 00:12:18.460
how can your brother be white?'

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:22.240
Then I said, 'He's not white,
he's not white, he's mixed.'

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.570
Then he said, 'But you not
mixed, you don't look the same.

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.050
How can your brother not look the same?'"

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:27.750
So now I'm like, "Oh, man,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:28.850
I'm gonna have to go through this."

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.407
So then I'm like, "So
what did you say to him."

00:12:30.407 --> 00:12:32.420
And he's like, "Ah Trevor, I'd have

00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:34.370
to explain it the way kids understand."

00:12:35.438 --> 00:12:36.593
He said, "I just said to him, I said,

00:12:36.593 --> 00:12:39.010
'Zweli, you've gotta understand,

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.150
people are like chocolates, okay?

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:44.180
Like you can have a white chocolate,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.800
and you can have a dark chocolate,

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.270
and you can have a milk chocolate.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:48.878
But it's all Nestle, okay?'"

00:12:48.878 --> 00:12:51.920
(audience laughs)

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:53.253
Any questions?

00:12:53.253 --> 00:12:54.213
(audience murmurs)

00:12:54.213 --> 00:12:55.757
No, you good, okay.

00:12:55.757 --> 00:12:57.757
(audience laughs)

00:12:57.757 --> 00:12:59.820
Yeah.
- [Audience Woman] How's Fufi?

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:01.580
- How's, oh how's Fufi?

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.596
- Yeah.
- Wow, that's a deep cut.

00:13:03.596 --> 00:13:05.451
(audience laughs)

00:13:05.451 --> 00:13:06.970
You guys just asked me
that like just random,

00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:10.170
you gotta be like, "Hey Trevor,
so I read in your book."

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.003
You can't just be like, "How's Fufi?"

00:13:11.003 --> 00:13:13.547
'Cause in my mind, who
the hell, Fufi (cries).

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:16.811
No because,
- [Audience Woman] Sorry.

00:13:16.811 --> 00:13:17.877
because Fufi died.

00:13:17.877 --> 00:13:18.940
(audience cries)

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.773
So for those who don't,

00:13:19.773 --> 00:13:22.410
so I had a dog when I was growing up,

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.593
one of the dogs we had,

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:27.690
my mom was working at a
pharmaceutical company,

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:30.867
and her colleague came to
work one day and was like,

00:13:30.867 --> 00:13:35.177
"Hey, my neighbor's
dog impregnated my dog,

00:13:35.177 --> 00:13:37.550
so now I have all these
puppies I don't want,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.670
and they're like this weird mix

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.740
of bull-terrier and a Maltese poodle.

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:41.660
So do you want to take them?"

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.290
And my mom's like, "All
right, I'll take two."

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.060
And then my mom brought them home,

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.440
and I'd never had a dog before,

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.840
and I was like this is the most
amazing thing in the world.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:49.700
And so we raised them, and
it was two beautiful dogs

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:51.230
that look completely different,
but they were sisters.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:52.790
They were the best, Fufi and Panther,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:54.170
and my mom called the one Panther

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:56.120
'cause she had a pink
nose, so the Pink Panther,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:14:00.850
and then Fufi was like the
dumbest most beautiful dog ever,

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.960
and Panther was the smartest,
ugliest dog you'd ever seen,

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:06.340
and so I loved Fufi the most

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.580
'cause she's just looked really viscous.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.900
And I used to think that
Fufi was really stupid,

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.910
and then one day what happened was

00:14:16.330 --> 00:14:19.944
at our house, somebody was
trying to come into the house,

00:14:19.944 --> 00:14:21.720
like a family friend, and they were trying

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.440
to open the gate, and
then they moved the gate,

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.190
and then the gate fell,
and then Panther ran away

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:29.540
'cause they liked to sleep by the gate,

00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:32.010
and then Panther ran,
but then Fufi didn't.

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.120
And then the gate hit her,
and then it broke her spine.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:37.330
It was devastating, so
then we went to the vet,

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:39.450
and the vet was like, "I can't help her,

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:41.120
we've gotta put her down,
put her out of her misery."

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.470
And the vet was like,
"But this was amazing,

00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:45.860
how were you guys, how did
you guys raise a deaf dog?"

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.110
And we were like, "What?"

00:14:49.977 --> 00:14:51.860
And we're like, "What
do you mean a deaf dog?"

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.023
And he was like, "Oh, like afterwards,

00:14:53.023 --> 00:14:55.210
when I was just going
through, examining her

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.470
while she was still living,

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:58.530
I realized that she wasn't born

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.500
with I guess a certain part
of the cochlea or something."

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.447
And we're like, "Wait, this
dog was deaf the whole time?"

00:15:03.447 --> 00:15:05.020
(audience laughs)

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.283
And we just genuinely,

00:15:06.283 --> 00:15:10.870
we'd just be like, "Fufi,
sit, listen to me, sit Fufi!"

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.750
And I was like, "You're
so dumb, you're so dumb."

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:15.120
And I never knew that the dog,

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:17.550
and then we realized,
what used to happen was,

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:19.100
when we'd call the dogs,

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:20.490
we'd be like, "Fufi, Panther."

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.790
And Fufi would never come,

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:23.290
but Panther would come running sometimes,

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:24.530
and then she'd look at you,

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.810
and then she'd run back, and
then they would both come.

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:29.620
And I always used to be
like, Fufi's just dumb.

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:30.847
And then I realized Panther was like,

00:15:30.847 --> 00:15:32.080
"Ah, she didn't hear."

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.230
And then she'd go back and fetch her,

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.270
and then she would then,
both of them would come,

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.360
and then like now, I went back,

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.697
and I was like (cries)
Fufi, Fufi, I miss you Fufi.

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.000
So that's how Fufi's doing, she's yeah.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.290
What happened to Teddy from my book?

00:15:52.290 --> 00:15:54.390
You know what's funny is randomly one day,

00:15:55.414 --> 00:15:57.000
I was driving to a car dealership.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.970
I had bought an Audi, and I
went to the car dealership

00:15:59.970 --> 00:16:01.620
'cause I needed them to
help me with something,

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.973
and then they said, "We will,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.810
we'll call our top mechanic."

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:08.490
And just to give you a bit of a backstory,

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.160
Teddy was my best friend
in primary school,

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.600
and him and I used to
go shoplifting together.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.660
And then one day, we
were busted shoplifting,

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.610
and then we ran away, and
then they caught Teddy,

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:21.327
but they didn't catch me, and then,

00:16:21.327 --> 00:16:23.970
but they had security
footage of what happened,

00:16:23.970 --> 00:16:25.650
and they went to all the
schools in the area looking

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.950
for who was shoplifting with Teddy.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.780
And then they didn't know it was me

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.700
because the security
camera was black and white,

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.810
it was like the old school
black and white cameras,

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:36.170
and so they were like, "We're
looking for a white kid,"

00:16:36.170 --> 00:16:38.430
because on the camera, in black and white,

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.330
it chose, the camera chose white.

00:16:40.330 --> 00:16:41.550
So then at the school they asked me,

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:42.520
they were like, "Trevor, come in here."

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.580
They're like, "You're friends with Teddy?"

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.730
I was like, "Uh-huh."

00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:46.010
And they're like, "Well Teddy
was caught shoplifting."

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:46.970
I was like, "Uh-huh."

00:16:46.970 --> 00:16:48.113
They're like, "There
was someone with him."

00:16:48.113 --> 00:16:48.946
I was like, "Uh-huh."

00:16:48.946 --> 00:16:50.690
They're like, "It was a
white kid, who was he?"

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.217
I was like, "Huh?"

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.400
And then they just never caught me,

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.653
and then Teddy never snitched or anything,

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.100
but he got expelled from the school,

00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:02.070
and then I thought he
went to jail or something.

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:04.800
So, and I never knew
where he ended up in life.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:07.890
10 years later, maybe even more,

00:17:07.890 --> 00:17:09.960
I was, yeah, I had an Audi, drove

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:11.100
to an Audi dealership 'cause they wanted

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.210
to help me with something.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:13.500
And I pulled in, and I
said, "Can you help me?"

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.670
They said, "Oh, this is complicated.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:17.150
Let's call our top technician mechanic."

00:17:17.150 --> 00:17:19.287
And then they call the
guy, and they're like,

00:17:19.287 --> 00:17:20.810
"Theo, come out," and then he came out,

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.108
and then it was Teddy, and I was like,

00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:24.551
"Teddy,

00:17:24.551 --> 00:17:25.384
Teddy,

00:17:27.593 --> 00:17:32.593
Teddy."

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.340
So that's what happened to Teddy.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.940
All right, let's do this.

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:36.857
I was devastated, and he was just like,

00:17:36.857 --> 00:17:39.062
"What are you crying about?"

00:17:39.062 --> 00:17:41.473
I was like, "I'm so happy."

00:17:41.473 --> 00:17:43.690
He's like, "Dude, we were
stealing chocolate bars,

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:44.640
why would you be thinking,

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:45.473
why would you thinK."

00:17:45.473 --> 00:17:47.197
"I thought you went to jail for life."

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:50.010
It's funny, in South Africa,

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.640
we have a saying, and you must remember,

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.100
because of so many of the struggle leaders

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:57.300
in South Africa were either
imprisoned or exiled,

00:17:57.300 --> 00:17:59.550
the movement in South
Africa was held together

00:17:59.550 --> 00:18:01.990
in large part by women in the country.

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:03.840
And so it's weird for
me 'cause I understand,

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.510
you travel the world, you
understand that everywhere,

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:07.990
feminism is different, and the
idea of women is different,

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:10.350
but I grew up in a world
that was very matriarchal,

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:13.380
and where women were the most
dangerous freedom fighters

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.510
that existed.
(audience screams)

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:18.430
It's true, you read up on Winnie Mandela,

00:18:18.430 --> 00:18:20.210
like Nelson Mandela was an icon,

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.309
but the police in the country were afraid

00:18:22.309 --> 00:18:24.530
of Winnie Mandela, you know, they were.

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.810
And we had a phrase in
South Africa that was,

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.034
we still use it today, which was

00:18:28.034 --> 00:18:30.530
"Wathint' abafazi, wathint' imbokodo'"

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:33.440
which means, "You strike a
woman you strike a rock."

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:34.273
And that's what

00:18:34.273 --> 00:18:36.231
I grew up learning.
(audience cheers)

00:18:36.231 --> 00:18:38.640
That was, it was kudos, man.

00:18:40.343 --> 00:18:41.593
It was fire, it was fire.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:45.374
And a lot of the time, my mom
would strike me with a rock.

00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:49.291
