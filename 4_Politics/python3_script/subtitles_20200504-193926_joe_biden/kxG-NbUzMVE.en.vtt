00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.820
 Scrapwood Challenge Scrapwood Challenge 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.160
 It's junk it's crap it's firewood 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.000
 But some of the wood is good 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.460
 I will start choosing from the pieces 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.800
 I don't need a project today 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.260
 It is a coffee table 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.300
 As you can see 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.880
 There is still enough laurel camphor left 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.140
 For a few challenges scrap wood yet 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.640
 I'm planning one flat edge over all the pieces 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.500
 And then tear the opposite edge 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.600
 On a table saw 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.000
 I am making a segmented episode 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.500
 Or off the schedule 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.540
 This requires 18 pieces 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.280
 And cutting waste will come in handy for another project 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.520
 I'm going through and cutting one end 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.220
 On each piece at 10 degrees 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.320
 When you're all done 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.880
 I also cut a 10 degree angle on the other end 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.860
 I join slices with floating tongues 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.900
 So here I am delineating positions 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.960
 From mortises 

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.120
 Now I am making a discount 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.900
 For a piece of plywood to sit 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.980
 I make a pass then cut a little bit and go again 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.320
 I have made about five assists in total 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.120
 Carry on the router bit 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.700
 He thrives on the table 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.160
 So I had to raise the job a little 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.000
 This smiley face dance is going to help me cut the bevel 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.560
 On the underside of the ring 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.900
 It maintains an insurance ring against jig 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.240
 But it is allowed to transform into a raised blade 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.140
 I reclaimed this plywood 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.240
 From some shelves that were recently pulled down 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.420
 It is of excellent quality and very flat 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.260
 I just need to remove the vinyl 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.380
 And glue off for the first time 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.280
 The middle of the table will be Kumiko 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:42.840
 Then I'm going to pour epoxy resin into it 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.720
 If you are not sure what Kumiko is 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.300
 Then around a stick you will know 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.360
 Next I need to fill in the center with Kumiko 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.480
 It's coming along but not just ready yet 

00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.860
 To put a cup of coffee on 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.020
 But as it is a new day 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.960
 I am ready for a good and strong cup of coffee 

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:40.160
 And while I'm making this 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.500
 I thank the coffee business 

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.760
 To take care of today's video 

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.620
 If you are struggling to find the perfect coffee 

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.180
 From the grocery store 

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.800
 Business solves that by tying you to fresh coffee 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.380
 Top roasting to satisfy your taste buds 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:53.320
 Take this competition to refine your selection 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.640
 Find the perfect coffee 

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.340
 This is a lot for your style and palate 

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.009
 If you like medium light or dark roast 

00:07:59.009 --> 00:08:00.120
 Beans or ground 

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:02.640
 Or even the equipment you use to make your own coffee 

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.480
 Help to find a perfect match 

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.180
 I personally love strong coffee 

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:07.280
 That tastes like coffee 

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.240
 But if you prefer your coffee with a hint of nothing else 

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.240
 Then this contest has covered you for that as well 

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:13.840
 After selecting your coffee 

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.790
 You can choose the delivery frequency 

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:17.320
 It will appear at your door 

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.580
 Fresh from the toaster 

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:19.720
 Then adjusted and repeated 

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:20.660
 The rate of those matches 

00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.300
 So the trade can continue to delight you with the coffee that you will love

 And thanks again for trading to sponsor today's video 

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:36.540
 Now I will start preparing your board 

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.800
 To make bars for Kumiko 

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:22.120
 Beautifully clean ribbons come off 

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.800
 And you just need a pass from the plane 

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:25.340
 To be cleaned on either side 

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.040
 And to get them to the final thickness 

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.680
 I am now painting Kumiko with water based lacquer 

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:40.720
 To shut them down before they get cut and assembled 

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.380
 I gave them a few coats and sanded them between 

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:49.840
 I was about to make a dance to make Kumiko 

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:52.340
 Then I found a video by Mike Farrington 

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.000
 Show exactly how to do it 

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.789
 I will put a link to this in the description 

00:09:55.789 --> 00:09:58.240
 It turns out the dance is pretty much the same 

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.720
 As my sled wedgie 

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.820
 I just need to add a groove to get a key 

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.640
 The video also shows Mike the whole process 

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.680
 How to make this kumiko style 

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:09.080
 The network consists of two different pieces 

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.100
 The first one is cut to the nearest fence 

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.500
 And about a third of the way to strip 

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:18.720
 Then she flipped over to cut on either side 

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.600
 For another type of tape 

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.700
 Blade needs rise to two thirds 

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:38.740
 Strip height 

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.640
 The first step of its kind is made on the nearest fence 

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.900
 Then the same position is cut again 

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:44.200
 But on the farthest fence 

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:45.400
 There are twice that number 

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.860
 From these second strips as the first 

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.000
 I stamp the inner edges of the loop with water-based varnish 

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.380
 Ready to pour epoxy for later 

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.420
 But also use this glue down the kumiko grid 

00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.240
 A few pieces of the network broke off and need repair 

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.120
 From when you cut it to fit the ring 

00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.900
 Now I need a lot of small bits of kumiko 

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:58.700
 To fill the grid and to be around 400 pieces 

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.620
 Every piece in this style is exactly the same 

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.870
 I go through and cut I 

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:44.840
 Point 30 degrees one on the end of each piece 

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.180
 Then I go through all of them again 

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.420
 I place a 60 degree point on the other end 

00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:35.300
 I am using water based varnish again 

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.100
 Glue the pieces but also to seal the joints 

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.140
 Air bubbles would help prevent 

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:43.610
 When pouring the epoxy 

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:27.640
 While full triangles are in the center 

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:28.900
 Took some time 

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:31.420
 All broken triangles around the edge 

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:32.960
 He took for much longer 

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.120
 I had to match each piece separately 

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.850
 And the glue in its place 

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.800
 I started sanding them with a size 

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.060
 But I found it easier to hone them 

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:44.560
 Cut with a chisel and a Kumiko dance 

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.600
 With the closest matching angle 

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.440
 This is the first time that epoxy has flowed in this kind of quantity 

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.400
 But his hope is to work with it 

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:30.780
 Although I closed the plywood to the edge of the ring 

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.760
 She did seep through in a few places 

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.300
 So I just had to put the clamp on 

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.220
 And tighten those areas up 

00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:39.300
 It's the next day the epoxy still setup 

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:42.540
 So I will start at the legs 

00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:21.500
 I decided to have a bit of practice with a chisel deviation 

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.340
 I definitely need a lot more 

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.520
 But it is a very fun tool to use 

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.760
 The legs are very skinny 

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:31.060
 This is what I was looking for 

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.660
 I also want her to be very slender and elegant 

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.020
 To match with Kumiko 

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:37.840
 Any thing that chunky would spoil the look of the table perfectly 

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.220
 And it only has to hold a few cups of coffee 

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.220
 The legs are done 

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.920
 Now you don't need to make two bars to make it 

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.380
 These rims would have been easier to make 

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:29.060
 On saw miter before I glued the pieces together 

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:30.620
 They are not even necessary 

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:31.900
 Because it will not appear 

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.340
 But I couldn't help myself 

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:36.620
 So I just did it with a block plane 

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.240
 Epoxy is set 

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:40.500
 And yet it can start on sandbar 

00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.520
 I do not want glossy finish 

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.280
 Satin finish is what I am after 

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.880
 So I will go through Freek 

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.400
 Until I get to the end that I love 

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:17.460
 I am very happy with only 400 finished 

00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.370
 But I will not go one more and try 600 

00:22:20.370 --> 00:22:23.420
 And see how that looks 

00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:11.600
 I'm super happy with how you turned out 

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.370
 I can improve on a few things 

00:23:13.370 --> 00:23:14.800
 But I know next time 

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.560
 But overall I am very very happy with it 

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.940
