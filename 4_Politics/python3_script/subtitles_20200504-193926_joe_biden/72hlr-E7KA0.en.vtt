00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.349
Airline ticket pricing probably seems like
a crapshoot.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.150
The numbers change seemingly arbitrarily every
week, day, or hour, but there’s some real

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.930
science behind these prices.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.930
People spend their whole lives figuring out
what to charge you to fly.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.020
Let’s take a look at one flight on one route
by one airline to understand.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.530
American Flight 33 leaves New York’s JFK
airport every day at 7 AM bound for Los Angeles

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.410
arriving at 10:51 AM pacific time.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.120
This transcontinental route is one of the
most competitive in the world with over 3.5

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.320
million yearly passengers and five major airlines
connecting the country’s two largest cities.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.010
There’s nowhere where pricing strategies
are more important for airlines than here.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.829
Looking at three months of fares for this
flight, there are eight distinct prices for

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.269
economy ranging from $129 to $472.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.860
These all get you on the exact same flight
in the exact same seat but each and every

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.350
price has a purpose and place.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.720
The lowest price, $129, is the most competitive
price.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.170
This fare only shows up three times in our
three month span—each time on Tuesdays.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.310
Now, Tuesdays are very often the cheapest
days of the week to fly.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.960
Business travelers tend to make up much of
the demand during the week and they most often

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.040
want to fly out on Monday and return on Thursday
or Friday so Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.000
tend to be the most expensive travel days
while Tuesdays and Wednesdays are often the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
cheapest.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.490
The average ticket price for this flight shows
this—Tuesdays average $182 and Wednesdays

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.939
$173.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.850
Even if the demand is lower American Airlines
runs the flight anyways and they have to fill

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.960
seats to break even so they sell the flight
at rock-bottom prices.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.659
The next price, $144, actually demonstrates
a very interesting phenomenon.

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.030
Whenever American prices their flight at $144,
they are not alone.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.939
Take March 6th for example.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:14.019
American, Delta, Virgin America, JetBlue,
and United all have flights from New York

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.719
to LA at around 7 in the morning selling for
$144.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:21.139
They’re doing what is called price matching.

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:24.379
Because this is one of the most competitive
routes in the world and because the number

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.419
one determinant for travelers on which airline
they take is price, all five airlines flying

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.889
this route match each others prices.

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:37.019
This way, travelers make their decision based
off the reputation of each airline rather

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.209
than the price.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.769
The price stays at $144 because it’s in
each airlines best interest to keep it there.

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.269
In a normal market, if Delta, for example,
dropped their price to $119 they would get

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.330
more travelers since they were the cheapest,
but in this price matched market all the other

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.249
airlines would drop their prices as soon as
Delta drops theirs so all of them would get

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:04.290
the same amount of travelers as before while
earning less money, but there are some cases

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:10.309
where it can make business sense for airlines
to drop prices to below even being profitable.

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:15.049
Around the year 2000, WestJet and the now
defunct CanJet airlines started flying from

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.419
central Canada to Newfoundland.

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:23.439
These routes were historically operated exclusively
by Air Canada and they were expensive.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:30.390
A one-way flight from Montreal in 1999 cost
over $600, but when the budget airlines WestJet

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.129
and CanJet started flying the route, prices
dropped dramatically and Air Canada was threatened,

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.930
so they dropped their prices even lower.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.400
The $600 Air Canada fares then cost $89.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.470
Now, it wouldn’t make sense for anyone to
fly a budget airline over Air Canada at the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.209
same price so WestJet and CanJet were almost
driven out of business on these routes, until

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.629
Canada’s Competition Bureau stepped in.

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.700
They concluded that Air Canada was engaging
in the uncompetitive action of predatory pricing

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.900
since they were pricing flights below what
it cost to operate them, so they were forced

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.079
to stop.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.189
Airlines in the US, with some newly strong
budget competitors, are engaging in similar

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.870
actions nowadays.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.450
United airlines, for example, is matching
Frontier’s $40 fares on many days from Denver

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:23.130
to Chicago, among other routes, in order to
maintain their market stronghold in Denver

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.590
and Chicago even though their cost to operate
the route is drastically higher than Frontier

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.090
so they are almost certainly loosing money
on those fares.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.460
But back to the New York to LA route.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.080
$159 is the lowest regular fare for this flight.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.530
The $129 and $144 price points were both basic
economy fares—the most restrictive type

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.120
with no seat selection, no carry on bags,
and no changes or refunds.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.560
Every flight has a bunch of different booking
classes each with a fare code.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:01.280
For example, the basic economy fare code for
the $129 and $144 price is B, but the $159

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.691
price books into fare code N. These different
booking classes are sometimes known are fare

00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:06.691
buckets.

00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:10.480
Essentially the airline decides it’s going
to sell a certain number of tickets at the

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.530
$159 price with fare code N, let’s say 10,
then when those ten tickets are sold the airline

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.630
then sells economy at fare code G for $204
then when those are sold it sells economy

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.830
at fare code V for $269 then fare code L for
$318 and so on and so forth.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.240
There are also some cases where a ticket will
default to a more expensive fare bucket because

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.360
of reasons other than the lower fare selling
out.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.810
Many fares, including each mentioned so far,
have advance purchase requirements meaning

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.960
that, even if a flight is not full at all,
the price will increase closer to departure.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:51.140
All the fares below $204 have an advance purchase
requirement of two weeks meaning that you

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.610
can only purchase them more than two weeks
before departure while the $269 fare, for

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.150
example, has an advance purchase requirement
of only one week.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.651
Although, the cheapest fare without an advance
purchase requirement at all, that is, the

00:06:04.651 --> 00:06:11.120
cheapest fare that you could buy day-of for
this flight is fare class K at $472 which

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.950
happens to be the most expensive economy class
fare.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.060
And now for some caveats.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:22.140
Not every fare for this flight is going to
be priced at one of these eight prices.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.060
Airlines have mechanisms to adjust fares from
these buckets.

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.920
In the short-term, they can adjust things
like the fuel surcharge to raise the price

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.160
if other factors, like oil prices, increase.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.100
In the long term they can adjust the actual
prices of the different fare buckets.

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:41.350
Airline often increase the base fares for
busy seasons like summer.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.080
American Airlines does exactly that on this
New York to LA route where their fare class

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.340
M, for example, increases from $357 to $410
in August.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.900
But so far we’ve looked at this at a micro
level—how prices differ on one flight—but

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:00.650
we also have to consider the macro level.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:07.690
Why if you leave on Tuesday February 6th and
fly 2,469 miles to the west to LA do you pay

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:15.350
$129 while if you fly 3,442 miles to the east
to London—only a thousand miles further

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.580
than LA—you pay $2,772.

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:25.410
Well, the second figure is a bit deceptive
because that’s the price of a one-way ticket.

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.950
If you switch the LA flight to a round-trip
ticket returning a week later it will cost

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.670
$257—exactly double—while if you turn
the London flight into a round-trip returning

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:41.210
a week later the price will drop to $602—almost
five times less.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.960
This is understandably confusing—a one-way
ticket that costs more than a roundtrip—but

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.139
the reason this is goes back to the fare codes.

00:07:49.139 --> 00:07:54.310
Embedded within each fare code are a bunch
of little restrictions that dictate when you

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.900
can use that fare.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.610
On the New York to LA trip those restrictions
are just things like blackout dates for the

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:04.300
fare and advance purchase requirements, but
the New York to London ticket has loads more

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:09.090
restrictions and the ones that make one-ways
more expensive than round-trips are the minimum

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.800
stay requirements.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.620
These requirements dictate how soon your return
flight can be in order to get a particular

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.620
fare.

00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:21.950
The idea is to price discriminate—business
travelers should pay more because they can

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:22.990
pay more.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.180
Meanwhile, airlines try to give the lowest
prices to leisure travelers since they’re

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:30.880
the ones paying for their own tickets and
therefore they’re the ones that are the

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.829
most price sensitive.

00:08:32.829 --> 00:08:36.419
Business travelers often want to be home for
the weekend, so many of these minimum stay

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:42.140
requirements, like with fares Q, N, and S,
just require a Sunday at your destination.

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.920
Others, trying to accomplish the same thing,
require seven days, a full week, which would

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.730
also require a traveller to stay the weekend
at their destination.

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:56.100
Now as the prices go up the requirements go
down so once you get to paying around $2000

00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.050
you can stay for as few as three days, but
the cheapest roundtrip base airfare with no

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:09.990
stay requirement at all is $5,544 in fare
class Y—exactly double the one way price.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:15.370
So that explains this—the one way ticket
is so expensive because, since the airline

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:19.319
doesn’t know how long the traveller will
stay at their destination the one-way fare

00:09:19.319 --> 00:09:24.059
has to be booked into the least restrictive
fare class without the minimum stay requirement.

00:09:24.059 --> 00:09:28.110
You’ll see this idea of price discrimination
all over ticketing structures.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:33.249
It’s a genius pricing concept that allows
different people to buy products at the prices

00:09:33.249 --> 00:09:39.319
they can afford and therefore its allows businesses
to sell the same product to more people.

00:09:39.319 --> 00:09:43.600
Tickets increase in price closer to departure
because leisure travelers buy tickets far-out

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.509
and business travelers buy their tickets close
to departure and flexible tickets are more

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:51.720
expensive because that’s what business travelers
need, but there’s another pricing difference

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.120
going on that’s less fair—between routes.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.120
It’s all about competition.

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.930
Different routes of the same distance cost
different amounts generally not because they

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:07.050
cost different amounts to operate, but because
of how much the competitors are charging.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:13.279
This is part of why flights into small airports
are so expensive—because they lack competition.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:20.421
You can fly the 240 miles from Detroit to
Pellston, Michigan on a CRJ 200 for $242 or

00:10:20.421 --> 00:10:26.839
you can fly the 170 miles from Detroit to
South Bend, Indiana on a CRJ 200 for $76.

00:10:26.839 --> 00:10:31.769
The only difference is that South Bend Airport
has flights from United, Delta, and Allegiant

00:10:31.769 --> 00:10:34.660
while Pellston only has flights from Delta.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:37.259
The same phenomenon happens over the Atlantic.

00:10:37.259 --> 00:10:41.550
There’s more competition on the six hour
flight from New York to LA than on the six

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:47.649
hour flight from New York to Dublin so you
can fly to LA for $250 round trip while Dublin

00:10:47.649 --> 00:10:49.500
costs $500 round trip.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.980
Of course, travelers from New York to LA can
drive, take the bus, take the train, or take

00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:00.339
a flight connecting halfway there while travelers
to Dublin only have one choice—to fly.

00:11:00.339 --> 00:11:05.559
In all, the truth is that prices reflect what
people will pay and so people will pay what

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:07.620
flights are priced.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.630
If you’re a busy person like me, you know
that eating healthy can be difficult.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:15.839
Sometimes it seems like you have two choices—quick
food or healthy food—but you have another

00:11:15.839 --> 00:11:20.199
one—quick and healthy food because that’s
what Blue Apron is.

00:11:20.199 --> 00:11:24.300
Blue Apron ships you boxes every week with
farm-fresh pre-apportioned ingredients and

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:29.300
recipes that let you make these delicious,
healthy meals in at the very most 40 minutes.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.579
I recently made the Spicy Pork and Korean
Rice Cakes meal which was delicious and quick.

00:11:34.579 --> 00:11:37.850
With Blue Apron, you’re sure to get stuff
that you’ll actually like because they have

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.869

00:11:46.379 --> 00:11:48.769
start at just $8.99/10.99 per serving.

00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:53.749
I highly recommend you try Blue Apron out
and the good news is that you can try out

00:11:53.749 --> 00:11:56.550
