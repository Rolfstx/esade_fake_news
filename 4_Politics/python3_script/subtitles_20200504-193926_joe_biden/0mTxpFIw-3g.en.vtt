00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.220
Peter: Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge, I am
Peter Robinson. Andrew Breitbart grew up in

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.941
Los Angeles then attended Tulane University.
He helped edit the Drudge Report and then

00:00:09.941 --> 00:00:15.669
was a developer of the Huffington Post. The
author of a book entitled Hollywood Interrupted,

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:22.170
Insanity Chic in Babylon, the Case Against
Celebrity. Mr. Breitbart now manages two of

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.900
his own sites on the internet, Breitbart.com
and a cultural and political site called big

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.640
Hollywood. His abiding concern is the politics
of Hollywood, which he views as a problem

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.300
and which he intends to correct. Segment 1:
Insanity Chic: Andrew Breitbart, I am quoting

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.140
you in a newspaper interview he gave last
year discussing the people who run Hollywood.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.140
Quote.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.140
Andrew: Uh oh.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.680
Peter: Yes, quote I am telling you they are
uninteresting. They are vicious. They are

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.300
vitriolic. They are really, really not good
people and I am willing to say that on the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.690
record. Close quote. Is there any of that
you regret?

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.690
Andrew: No.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.340
Peter: What makes them really, really not
good people?

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.079
Andrew: Well I am not saying the entirety,
but the ones who have controlled Hollywood

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:18.219
for the last 40 years that quote could be
attributed to the campus left as well. It

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:25.240
could be attributed to people who are in charge
in Venezuela right now. Anywhere where the

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:32.250
left gets control, you start to see political
correctness run amuck. You start seeing dissenting

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.649
views quashed. They use projection right before
they do so they start attacking the people

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.920
they are about to go after about being guilty
of the very things that they do. That is why

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:53.429
the dissent is patriotic, I mean was so hysterical
during the 2000, during Bush's presidency,

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.329
because whenever I would ask any of these
people can you name one person who has attempted

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.560
to quash your dissent and they would usually?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.560
Peter: The liberals?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.939
Andrew: The liberals would say that they couldn't
come up with any individuals, they would just

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.920
say you have got to be crazy. It is everywhere.
Well exactly where is that? The first thing

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.480
that this president did.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.360
Peter: Obama?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:27.180
Andrew: That President Obama did was isolate
Russ Limbaugh who was a symbol of a [inaudible]

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:36.629
anti-Obama sentiment and he isolated him and
the mainstream media and Hollywood completely

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.500
got behind this. That to me was chilling that
the Bill Mahers of the world, the Joy Behars

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.730
of the world, the entirety of MSNBC all went
after Russ Limbaugh. He hadn't said anything

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:58.859
at that moment in time that was anything that
was outrageous at all, especially compared

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.180
to what had been said for the 8 previous years.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.030
Peter: He was guilty only of a political crime.
He disagreed with them and said so vividly.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.030
Andrew: Right.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.549
Peter: And that was it. Listen historical
question, golden age of Hollywood, which wasn't

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:17.200
all that long ago. We measure in decades not
centuries after all. Producers, Jack Warner

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.791
of Warner Brothers was a republican, Directors
Frank Capra, immigrant from Sicily, a republican

00:03:22.791 --> 00:03:27.810
and a conservative. He produces movies such
as It's a Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith goes to

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:34.140
Washington, the town in those days produced
movie after movie after movie that was fundamentally

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.951
affirming about American life, fundamentally
affectionate even about American life. How

00:03:40.951 --> 00:03:49.150
did Hollywood go from Republican David Selznick,
who produced Gone with the Wind to Liberal

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.099
David Gaffin. What happened?

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:56.340
Andrew: Well two things, the studio system
ended and now the celebrities are in charge.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.090
Peter: The studio system ended, what bearing
did that have on the politics?

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.700
Andrew: Well there were people, actors have
always been held in low regard by society

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.659
and the businessmen who ran the studios cleaned
up after their messes around town. I mean

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:24.210
that is sort of the LA Confidential movie
you know. That changed in the 1960s to a great

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.830
extent, but I would attribute a majority of
this to the cultural revolution in the late

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:39.101
1960s and at the end part of John Wayne's
career, he no longer had the swagger. He was

00:04:39.101 --> 00:04:44.160
60 something years old, the movie were no
longer original. They were doing the same

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.840
hacking thing over and over and over and simultaneously
you know, there is a youth revolution going

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:59.810
on in the country and while the left was never
able to take over the White House while George

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:06.410
McGovern was not able to be victorious, Hollywood
was taken over by the left and they have never

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:14.970
relinquished it and in fact I would argue
that the right has abrogated its place in

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.400
Hollywood because they were told that you
are not wanted here anymore and they never

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.910
fought for it. So I don't know who I have
more contempt for, the left for its totalitarian

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.020
behavior of those that disagree with them
or the right the conservative movement just

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.380
for allowing it to happen and not to fight
back.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.660
Peter: Segment 2 is what difference does it
make? Let me quote you again, Andrew Breitbart

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:44.050
the popularity of American movies, I am quoting
you. Quote allows for a very parochial political

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.790
sensibility in this town Hollywood to be propagated
around the world and people just assume well

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:57.270
that is Hollywood that is the voice of the
American people, close quote. So Hollywood

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.580
is messing up our foreign policy?

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.560
Andrew: It is more subtle.

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:06.230
Peter: What difference does it make that Hollywood
is so far to the left, it is a small community,

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.370
a few 1000 lefties running the entertainment
business, so what?

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:17.660
Andrew: Well would you hire, if Madison avenue
is willing to hire an actor and give him a

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:24.790
million dollars to pour a beer in Japan that
actor must be worth that money, because they

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.360
are going to get the audience to buy that
specific brand of beer. When the entirety,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:37.080
when the collective of Hollywood sends a message
to the rest of the world that affirms the

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.860
worst narrative about the United States that
only tells half of the story or perhaps not

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:48.750
even half of the story, it ends up having
a net effect, especially when a left leaning

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:57.280
European press, their sensibilities are in
simpatico and what I think is at play is a

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:04.210
lot of insecure actors who didn't go to college
and feel intimidated by people of a higher

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:10.160
intellect, take their movies to Cannes or
San Sebastian and they find themselves not

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:16.140
around the working class of France or Spain.
They find themselves around the elite of the

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:18.810
elite of the elite and what?

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:21.550
Peter: They are foolish enough to suppose
that just because they smoke their cigarettes

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:26.040
like this that French critics are superior
to them.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:31.460
Andrew: There is such a limitation on the
point of view that comes out of Hollywood,

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:38.050
especially on political movies these days,
even movies like Wolverine that is out right

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:39.050
now.

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:42.210
Peter: I haven't seen it yet, but my teenage
boys came home.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:51.610
Andrew: There is an anti, the bad guy in the
movie is a repressed military guy who has,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:58.020
who in one subliminal scene has a little cross
on his lapel and?

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.860
Peter: James Bond, who is it James Craig,
the new James Bond?

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:02.860
Andrew: Yes.

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:05.400
Peter: The second Bond movie, which I rented
the other evening, the bad guy, it is unbelievable.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.400
Andrew: Well it is non-stop.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.620
Peter: The Americans are trying to take over
Bolivia.

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:14.610
Andrew: Look you cannot get a film produced
now that has is lamest [assumed spelling]

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:21.230
terrorists. You can get movies produced, in
fact, you see them all over the place in which

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:28.770
people of traditional values or corporations,
American corporations are the bad guys and

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:34.530
I know people within the system that tell
me how this plays out that one thing I have

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:43.610
been able to find out over the last 10 years
is more money now comes from foreign box office.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:48.990
65 percent to 35 percent, that wasn't always
the case.

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:50.290
Peter: You make most of your money on foreign.

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:58.900
Andrew: Right, so you're catering to the foreign
audience and so we might have an invested

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:05.550
at you know we may have an investment against
radical Islam, but the rest of the world wants

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:09.880
to kind of keep it bay and doesn't want to
take them on, doesn't want to ferment rage

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.450
against that community.

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:16.400
Peter: Domestic politics, in the 2008 election
cycle, the entertainment industry contributed

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:24.920
47 million to political campaigns, 36.5 to
democrats, 10.4 to republicans, so Hollywood

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:31.870
contributes to Democrats over Republicans
of a margin of about 4 to 1, which suggests

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:37.581
that those few thousand people that live down
there on the coast of California in Los Angeles

00:09:37.581 --> 00:09:42.840
and Environs exerts an enormous influence
over one of the nation's national parties.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:48.340
Andrew: Yes, the first job I took in Los Angeles
was working for a producer and he asked me

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:55.090
to take Senator Frank Lautenberg around and
I took him to Don Henley's house and the Senator

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:59.430
from New Jersey came out and said hey he is
going to do a fundraiser for me. He is going

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:03.250
to perform and all the celebrities are going
to come and I started to figure out how the

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:08.700
system worked, what does New Jersey have to
do with Don Henley and Los Angeles? That is

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.910
fine and good if that is legal, but what I
find offensive in this system is that the

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:20.560
conservatives that I know in Hollywood and
there are a lot cannot give money, because

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:26.950
through a simple FEC search, their names will
come up as Republicans and then the word will

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:33.310
spread around town that the Republican and
there is a strong likelihood that many people

00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:40.270
who would have ordinarily hired them will
not hire them and thankfully that behavior

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:45.390
was put on display after Proposition 8, because
the American people.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:49.250
Peter: Remind folks. That was just on the
ballot here in California a few months ago.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:51.560
Andrew: It was the anti-gay marriage initiative.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.279
Peter: Right.

00:10:53.279 --> 00:11:00.020
Andrew: Those people that donated as little
as 100 dollars were isolated.

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.980
Peter: Donated as little as 100 dollars to
the effort.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.550
Andrew: On behalf of the traditional marriage
stance.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.580
Peter: The pro man and woman means marriage
side.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.940
Andrew: Right, religious people, Mormons,
many from the black community, many from the

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:22.460
Hispanic community, California voted this
in. The gay left isolated those people who

00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:27.500
gave money to that even down to a cashier
of a famous Hollywood haunt by the name of

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:33.600
L. Coyote; they didn't just isolate her, but
they isolate the restaurant in order to put

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:37.529
pressure on to fire her. That happens all
the times.

00:11:37.529 --> 00:11:39.440
Peter: They put individual names up on websites.

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:45.550
Andrew: Yes, at a more subtle level that is
what has been going on in Hollywood for years.

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:51.020
I get phone calls all the time from major
name actors fearful of retribution that their

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:56.430
politics have somehow been outed, whether
it be from a donation they have given or the

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:02.590
fact that they were seen at a semi-public
event that could be attributed to the Republican

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.590
Party.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:09.210
Peter: Segment 3, who is Andrew Breitbart?
Washington Television Producer, Tammy Haddad,

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:15.440
Andrew Breitbart is quote one of the 10 most
important people in the media, who nobody

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.550
has ever met, closed quote. So let's take
a moment to introduce you. I said in the introduction,

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:28.529
you grew up in LA. You went to Tulane. Get
us from Tulane to editing the Trudge report.

00:12:28.529 --> 00:12:34.040
Andrew: Well I was a C student in high school
and in college and I think that saved me from

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.770
indoctrination in the left. I went to.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.400
Peter: You went to a pretty fancy prep school
down there, didn't you?

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:46.600
Andrew: I did, but all I got away with there
was my sense of humor. I sneaked my way around

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.661
classes, you know.

00:12:47.661 --> 00:12:49.601
Peter: Were you conservative in high school?

00:12:49.601 --> 00:12:56.160
Andrew: I wasn't ideological during the Reagan
years. My parents in hindsight were conservative,

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.850
but didn't speak of their conservatism and
so they allowed for me to sway in to the realm

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:06.490
of the left. In my latter years of high school,
I would say I was a mamby pamby liberal and

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:13.730
in college, I certainly considered myself
a liberal democrat. It wasn't until I graduated.

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:18.340
Peter: So what changed your politics, you
came back from Tulane straight back to LA,

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:19.440
right?

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:25.540
Andrew: That my mindset was not amenable to
working within the system that I thought the

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:31.460
system was inherently corrupt and then I realized
that I had to make a living that was that.

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:37.529
Then I lived in a rent control apartment and
I started to see what it did to people's soul

00:13:37.529 --> 00:13:44.089
quite frankly. People who thought they were
making out like bandits saving 400, 500, 600

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:50.490
dollars a month 10 years later were still
there and weren't entering the American dream.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:56.470
My family members who still lived in that
apartment when I have bought two houses since

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:59.580
then and I have been able to move up the scale.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.040
Peter: Because they couldn't surrender the
little gimme from the welfare, the subsidized

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.040
apartment.

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.220
Andrew: That's right. And that old ladies
would knock on my door at midnight, because

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:13.180
they knew that my family owned the building,
but I certainly wasn't benefiting from it

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:19.580
other than I was getting the low rent would
say you need to change the light bulb in my

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:24.620
apartment. There was a sense of entitlement
that was palpable in that place and I just

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:29.250
started to have. You know what I will tell
you the thing that really changed me, because

00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:35.610
for me and we haven't really touched on it,
everything to me is media biased and that

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:40.991
media bias for me was born of watching during
this period of transition between college

00:14:40.991 --> 00:14:45.990
life and theoretical life to the real world
and I watched the Clarence Thomas hearings

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:50.370
from beginning, middle and end, because I
had gone to the Iran Contra Hearings rooting

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:56.370
the Reagan administration on and that it be
taken down. So I liked political theater,

00:14:56.370 --> 00:15:02.060
so I watched that initially rooting for Clarence
Thomas to be taken down. By the very end,

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:10.029
I believed the seeds of my future were planted
right there when I realized that Ted Kennedy

00:15:10.029 --> 00:15:18.190
knew something. What did he know that he could
ask Clarence Thomas these questions of a man

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:24.540
who came from humble beginnings as an African
American. What did he know about the media?

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:31.610
What did he know about the political process?
What did he know about Hollywood that they

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:38.260
would side with a known lothario with chap[inaudible],
you know, in his background that they would

00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:45.670
allow for him and his allies in the Democratic
Party to ask this man in the realm of privacy

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:51.070
have you ever rented any pornography. Do you
know who Long Dong Silver is? It was so obvious

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:57.560
that this was a takedown that eventually I
started to see things through what I called

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.589
the Democrat Media Complex.

00:15:59.589 --> 00:16:06.450
Peter: Okay now hold on, you helped Arianna
Huffington develop the Huffington Post. So

00:16:06.450 --> 00:16:16.110
you are now here as leading conservative in
Hollywood and you helped produce possibly

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:18.589
the leading liberal website, explain yourself
Andrew?

00:16:18.589 --> 00:16:20.300
Andrew: Am I squirming?

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:21.459
Peter: Not enough for me.

00:16:21.459 --> 00:16:29.610
Andrew: Okay, my first job within the realm
of politics, I tripped upon it and I became

00:16:29.610 --> 00:16:34.490
Arianna Huffington's director of research.
I was a researcher, I helped her with her

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:38.630
columns and you know helped her with the books
and stuff like that.

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:39.630
Peter: But she is already liberal.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.891
Andrew: She was a conservative then.

00:16:40.891 --> 00:16:43.610
Peter: She was in motion by then.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:49.100
Andrew: I don't know what was going on in
her head. I certainly was a conservative then

00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:56.230
and the first thing that we did together,
the first project and I really gained an enormous

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:58.360
amount of respect for her writing skills and
her?

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.650
Peter: Oh she is a highly intelligent writer.

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:05.529
Andrew: And her investigative skills, when
she got Clinton's top donor, Larry Lawrence

00:17:05.529 --> 00:17:10.919
dug up from Arlington National Cemetery, I
remember Maureen Dowd saying this is the most

00:17:10.919 --> 00:17:21.669
loathsome thing that I have ever seen a conservative
republican do is to impugn this war heroes

00:17:21.669 --> 00:17:25.980
service, this dead man's service and Arianna
just had this smile on her face like she knew

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:36.020
that she had it and when I watched that Friday
an aerial view of CNN disinterring this fraud.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.850
Peter: Oh because he had not actually served.

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.940
Andrew: No well he didn't even served.

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.840
Peter: He was not entitled to be buried in
Arlington.

00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:49.210
Andrew: Right and he had gotten a waiver,
because he was the first person allegedly

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:53.759
in the Merchant Marines. He wasn't even in
the Merchant Marines, so she got him disinterred.

00:17:53.759 --> 00:18:00.419
I respected the hell out of her for that.
She switched. I left and went my own way,

00:18:00.419 --> 00:18:06.470
next thing I know she calls me up after the
2004 election and says you know, do you have

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:11.880
any ideas for a website for me? The idea,
its premise, I think benefitted her and I

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:18.499
think benefitted my side, because I wanted
the world to see how the far left thinks.

00:18:18.499 --> 00:18:25.559
The cocktail parties that I was privy too
where conspiracy theories were running amuck,

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:32.049
the only place one could see in the blogosphere
after 911 and after the Carey campaign, after

00:18:32.049 --> 00:18:39.499
Carey lost was that the daily costs were mostly
anonymous people would put their ideas down.

00:18:39.499 --> 00:18:45.960
I thought it would be great to see how the
hard left thought with people would be willing

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:48.779
to put their names down, huge miscalculation
here.

00:18:48.779 --> 00:18:55.960
Peter: Segment 4, who is winning on the internet?
You just teed this up, daily costs, move on.org,

00:18:55.960 --> 00:19:00.679
democratic underground, Huffington Post, they
dominate the internet. Wouldn't you agree

00:19:00.679 --> 00:19:04.861
or not? Or do you think it is relatively evenly
balanced, the left is ahead isn't it?

00:19:04.861 --> 00:19:11.190
Andrew: I would say the left is ahead, because
what all those sites do is protect the mainstream

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:16.470
media, before those sites became dominate
and the mainstream media granted them the

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:22.049
authority that they didn't grant the equivalent
blog sites on the right, these sites are there

00:19:22.049 --> 00:19:27.980
to protect them from future swift boat stories
to protect them from future Dan Rather stories,

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:34.360
because these stories would start rising through
the rightwing blogosphere and people on the

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:39.239
left were thinking, we don't want this story
to make it to the mainstream media and so

00:19:39.239 --> 00:19:43.990
they expected that John Carey would come out
and defend himself against the swift boat

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:49.659
feds and when he didn't, he was destroyed,
so that is what these people do. In a very

00:19:49.659 --> 00:19:57.309
coordinated fashion with George Sorel's money,
with heavy coordination with the Democratic

00:19:57.309 --> 00:20:02.070
Party, they feed these people information,
they feed them ideas.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:06.129
Peter: So the bad stories get smothered on
the internet before they make it to television.

00:20:06.129 --> 00:20:07.129
Andrew: Yes.

00:20:07.129 --> 00:20:15.269
Peter: Let me ask you a question about the
nature of well of two media. On talk radio,

00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:19.389
conservatives are dominant. Al Franken, they
try to get Air America going. I believe America

00:20:19.389 --> 00:20:22.399
is still limping along in some form or another,
but they can't get the listenership. They

00:20:22.399 --> 00:20:27.620
can't get the advertising. On conservative
talk radio, you have Russ Limbaugh, Sean Hannity,

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:32.249
Hugh Hewitt, Mark Levin, a number of people
prospering, right?

00:20:32.249 --> 00:20:33.249
Andrew: Um hmm.

00:20:33.249 --> 00:20:37.179
Peter: And you just argued that on the internet
it is the other way around that the left is

00:20:37.179 --> 00:20:42.179
dominate on the internet, why? What is it
about talk radio and the internet [inaudible]?

00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:49.980
Andrew: I think that the writing in the right
wing blogosphere is much better. I would put

00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:55.210
my side against Arianna's any day. I would
put National Review against Democrat Underground

00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:03.340
any day. I think that is scientifically provable,
but in terms of its affect, the right wing

00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:08.909
blogosphere no longer has the ability to do
what it did in 2004 before the coordinated

00:21:08.909 --> 00:21:15.119
online environment of the left became so successful.
I need to talk about why talk radio works

00:21:15.119 --> 00:21:21.009
for the right and why it doesn't work for
the left. It is a pretty simple. If you took

00:21:21.009 --> 00:21:29.039
away media bias from the equation, Russ Limbaugh
and Sean Hannity's ratings would fall. The

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:36.350
existence of, the subtext of every single
story is media biased. They are consuming

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:41.440
the media and then they are analyzing and
they are showing this is what they are saying,

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:47.429
but this is what is really happening out there
and when you are on the left, when the media

00:21:47.429 --> 00:21:53.690
is so on your side to try to pretend that
the media bias goes the other way, you are

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:59.759
going to fall on your face after two hours
of doing talk radio. You can't do three hours

00:21:59.759 --> 00:22:06.630
of talk radio every single day saying that
channel 360 out of 1000 on your direct TV

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.190
dial is the bane of humanity.

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:14.980
Peter: Okay, so Russ Limbaugh, Sean Hannity
and Hugh Hewitt are premised on reality and

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.279
Air America was not. There is a media reality
that they are responding too.

00:22:18.279 --> 00:22:19.279
Andrew: Right.

00:22:19.279 --> 00:22:22.440
Peter: Okay big Hollywood, why did you find
it and what do you hope to accomplish?

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:28.539
Andrew: Well it is by far, the Hollywood.com,
right? Well it is this very complicated URL

00:22:28.539 --> 00:22:29.539
but I am?

00:22:29.539 --> 00:22:30.539
Peter: Just Google Big Hollywood.

00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:34.470
Andrew: We are creating a series of group
blogs, this happens to be the first one, big

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:41.960
Hollywood begets big education next. We are
going to do Big Race, Big Climate. We are

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:44.830
going to do the group blog model and be?

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.289
Peter: When you are saying we here, you mean?

00:22:47.289 --> 00:22:52.980
Andrew: I have a business partner by the name
of Larry Salve who graduated from this lovely

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:56.899
campus and every C student needs an A student
in his life.

00:22:56.899 --> 00:22:58.200
Peter: To be his lawyer?

00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.200
Andrew: That's right.

00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:04.139
Peter: So Big Hollywood, start with Big Hollywood.
By the way you said you were contemptuous

00:23:04.139 --> 00:23:05.601
of conservatives in Hollywood?

00:23:05.601 --> 00:23:07.779
Andrew: I am not contemptuous of conservatives
in Hollywood.

00:23:07.779 --> 00:23:08.779
Peter: [Inaudible]

00:23:08.779 --> 00:23:12.450
Andrew: No, no, no I said I am contemptuous
of the movement.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:17.149
Peter: Explain that and then explain how Big
Hollywood has to do with that contemptuous,

00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:18.149
with formulating that.

00:23:18.149 --> 00:23:23.270
Andrew: That we have accepted our gilded ghetto
of Nat Review, Weekly Standard, all of the

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:30.840
think tanks that we think that alone is enough
to win elections, when it is so obvious.

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.309
Peter: The last election proved otherwise.

00:23:32.309 --> 00:23:37.909
Andrew: Right that pop culture matters, so
I am not blaming that the holdouts, I am not

00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:42.210
blaming the holdouts in Hollywood and there
are a lot of them. As a matter of fact, they

00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:46.100
need more help and that is precisely why Big
Hollywood was created.

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.619
Peter: Explain Big Hollywood.

00:23:47.619 --> 00:23:55.559
Andrew: Well when I wrote with Mark Ebner
Hollywood Interrupted in 2003, it came out

00:23:55.559 --> 00:24:00.530
in 2004, it was a reaction to and this was
before the Iraq war, so I am not going to

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:06.669
accept the narrative that the Hollywood left
stood behind George Bush and the United States

00:24:06.669 --> 00:24:16.009
during Afghanistan or after 911 in solidarity.
This was born from watching how the lot of

00:24:16.009 --> 00:24:20.889
Bush chimp, chimp Hitler, you know, commander
in thief.

00:24:20.889 --> 00:24:23.360
Peter: That had already started before Iraq.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:29.700
Andrew: That started certainly before Iraq.
It started before he took the office, but

00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:37.639
in Hollywood the animosity toward a wartime
president before Iraq was out of control and

00:24:37.639 --> 00:24:44.940
so that was why the book was written and I
had my incorrect assessment is that Hollywood

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:51.470
is 99.9 percent left. What I now know as a
result of having written the book and now

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:58.149
people knowing that I am the guy out there
in the center blogosphere, people have come

00:24:58.149 --> 00:25:03.369
to me, big name people have come to me. Small
people have come to me. All of them have the

00:25:03.369 --> 00:25:10.070
exact same story and what I talked about in
the first segment, they accuse you about what

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:15.720
they are doing to you. Hollywood makes movies
about McCarthyism about it was the worst thing

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:23.280
that ever happened in Hollywood or in the
Cold War that is their take away of the Cold

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:28.640
War that if a few screenwriters had to write
under pseudonyms for a few years. That is

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:33.510
not to take away, not to say that the black
list was a good or a bad thing, but for the

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:40.039
very people who for the last 40 years had
been vicious to people who disagree with them,

00:25:40.039 --> 00:25:46.730
who exude behavior like that you see Perez
Hilton doing against Ms. California when he

00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:52.369
calls her the B and the C word and the media
affirms that and makes her out to be the bad

00:25:52.369 --> 00:25:58.840
guy in that story line. That is what the average
actor, director in Hollywood has to deal with

00:25:58.840 --> 00:25:59.840
every single day.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:05.700
Peter: Segment 5, Andrew Breitbart's politics,
President Obama has just finished his first

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:06.779
100 days, what do you make of it?

00:26:06.779 --> 00:26:08.769
Andrew: You know.

00:26:08.769 --> 00:26:12.130
Peter: I am asking you, here is Hollywood,
here is the nation, talk a moment about the

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:13.919
nation. What are your politics?

00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:21.119
Andrew: You know what, I am definitely very
conservative. The transition was a typical

00:26:21.119 --> 00:26:27.139
one where I thought I was a libertarian, but
the more that I read books that were deprived

00:26:27.139 --> 00:26:32.499
of me during my college experience, ones that
should be required reading, just so people

00:26:32.499 --> 00:26:38.100
have a counter point. Once I started reading
what true conservatism was and that it wasn't

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:44.129
Jerry Falwell's autobiography, which is how
the media portrays conservatism that it is

00:26:44.129 --> 00:26:53.710
high, it is Kirk, it is Berke. It is writers
that loud David Mamet into becoming a conservative,

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:59.440
because he is at that high end of the media
food chain, of the Hollywood food chain had

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:00.440
the same epiphany.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:04.809
Peter: Has David Mamet had to pay any price
or is he so big that he hasn't had to pay

00:27:04.809 --> 00:27:06.380
a price for being a conservative.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.960
Andrew: That is a great question. I think
I think when you are a David Mamet or a Michael

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:19.369
Creighton who just died that your legacy is
everything. Michael Creighton was an incredible

00:27:19.369 --> 00:27:24.950
figure, not just in Hollywood. He was a huge
pop cultural figure. His death could not have

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:33.870
gone more unnoticed, because of his apostasy
on Hollywood's current big issue and that

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:41.580
is climate change. So I believe his legacy
is tainted, because the New York Times will

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:42.650
put him below the fold.

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:49.679
Peter: I am trying to get you going on national
politics, but the truth is this talk about

00:27:49.679 --> 00:27:51.360
Hollywood is irresistible.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:57.080
Andrew: Well what I will say is this, being
the Hollywood conservative, I defer to the

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:03.440
DC crowd when it comes to policy. I am not
a policy guy, but what I am obsessed on and

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:08.899
I am granted a great perspective of media
bias, because of what I have done in the media,

00:28:08.899 --> 00:28:13.440
my relationship with the New York Times, the
Associated Press, what is the traditional

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:20.479
media, ABC, NBC, every single day paying attention
to the text and realizing oh my goodness,

00:28:20.479 --> 00:28:25.529
these people really are ideological and they
really are in control and they really do mean

00:28:25.529 --> 00:28:32.380
business. Everything to me is media biased
and what talk radio has done has focused on

00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:44.020
the New York Times, the AP, HBO, and any place
where the View, ABC, CBS, NBC, Los Angeles

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:51.600
Time, you know it, the mainstream media. Our
media has set its sights on the mainstream

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:56.229
media as a checks and balance and we have
done a pretty good job. What we haven't done

00:28:56.229 --> 00:29:02.489
is that on Hollywood and Hollywood has a far
greater sway than that collective does. I

00:29:02.489 --> 00:29:03.489
tell people?

00:29:03.489 --> 00:29:09.119
Peter: You for sure want to call Hollywood
on its bias that is clear. It is clear that

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:16.470
you have done a fantastically energetic job
doing that, but you also have said in interviews

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:20.059
that you won't be satisfied until the culture
of Hollywood actually changes. So it is not

00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:25.710
enough for you to hold up a sign with a big
finger pointing to them and say hypocrites,

00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:31.409
so here is a question. Listen to this list
of movies that came out in 1939 and even seven

00:29:31.409 --> 00:29:38.169
decades ago: Gone with the Wind, The Wizard
of Oz, Mr. Smith goes to Washington. Artistic

00:29:38.169 --> 00:29:46.859
classics, fundamentally affectionate and celebratory
of American life, even Dorothy in the opening

00:29:46.859 --> 00:29:52.260
sequence in the Wizard of Oz where Kansas
is black and white and the environment is

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:56.639
rather grey and withered, she can't wait to
go home. There is no place like home, which

00:29:56.639 --> 00:30:01.619
means in effect, Hollywood is saying there
is no place like America. Can those days ever

00:30:01.619 --> 00:30:02.619
come back?

00:30:02.619 --> 00:30:07.359
Andrew: I don't know and I think the same
question people are asking right now with

00:30:07.359 --> 00:30:12.700
politics and referring to Ronald Reagan, but
I think that there are Bedrock principles

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:21.669
of conservative standby and I think that creativity
and new people carrying these ideas, there

00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:29.859
is no reason that we can't go back to an America
that is self assured and confident. In our

00:30:29.859 --> 00:30:35.549
differences from those counties around the
world, what I stand for politically is American

00:30:35.549 --> 00:30:36.549
exceptionalism.

00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:41.410
Peter: Let me ask you, two sentences, three
sentences at the very most, because I am out

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:45.599
of time. I am going to quote you once again.
I desperately want to change the environment

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:49.899
in Hollywood. In two or three sentences, how
will you know when you have succeeded Andrew?

00:30:49.899 --> 00:30:57.929
Andrew: When those people who are conservative
in my life, who are very creative and powerful

00:30:57.929 --> 00:31:04.639
in that town can behave in the same fashion
that the Hollywood left behaves in. That they

00:31:04.639 --> 00:31:09.649
can make movies that reflect their value system.
That they can make movies that affirm their

00:31:09.649 --> 00:31:15.490
traditional values. I am not even a social
conservative. I just want those people to

00:31:15.490 --> 00:31:19.349
be able to make movies that affirm their point
of view and they can't right now. And when

00:31:19.349 --> 00:31:24.169
I see those people being able to do it without
the retribution that you are seeing right

00:31:24.169 --> 00:31:30.200
now by the left or at large, I will not stop
this crusade.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:36.019
Peter: Andrew Breitbart of Breitbart.com and
Big Hollywood, thank you. I am Peter Robinson

00:31:36.019 --> 00:31:39.129

Thanks for joining us.
