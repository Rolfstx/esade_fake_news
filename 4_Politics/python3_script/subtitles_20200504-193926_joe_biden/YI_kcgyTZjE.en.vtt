ROBERT COSTA: Welcome to the Washington Week Extra. I'm Robert Costa. Let's pick up

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.740 position:98%
our conversation where we left it off on the broadcast: the 2020 presidential campaign.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.710 position:97%
With me tonight to finish this discussion: Susan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.410 position:98%
Today; and Philip Rucker, White House bureau chief for The Washington Post.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.720 position:80%
Susan, Phil, I appreciate you both sticking around.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.800 position:98%
Let's continue with the discussion about former Vice President Joe Biden.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.520 position:98%
Susan, what kind of crossroads was this for the 2020 campaign, big picture?

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.770 position:98%
I mean, Biden has been there in Delaware in his basement doing TV interviews, and now the

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.000 position:95%
hot spotlight of a sexual assault allegation on his campaign.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.280 position:98%
He's been in the public eye for so many decades, but this was a test.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.660 position:97%
SUSAN PAGE: That's right, and remember also this is - this week was the six-month mark

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.480 position:97%
before the national election. We are getting really close to the election.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.570 position:97%
We're in the - in the heat of the - in the heat of the campaign.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.310 position:97%
That's been obscured so much because we've been so occupied with the coronavirus

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.480 position:98%
pandemic. This is a test for Biden. He's had tests before. You know, we thought

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.370 position:98%
he had lost the nomination when he did so badly in Iowa and New Hampshire, and then

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.910 position:98%
he came back in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday and became the presumptive nominee.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.740 position:97%
But this will be a test of his ability to hold the Democrats together, including some of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.260 position:97%
the liberal Democrats, the progressives who backed Bernie Sanders who were less than

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.930 position:63%
enthusiastic about Biden as the nominee.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.100 position:98%
Does he manage to hold them, and can he generate the kind of enthusiasm among women

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.480 position:97%
voters, including suburban women voters who were so important for Democrats in their

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.060 position:98%
victories in the 2018 midterms? This particular issue is important to many of those voters.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.350 position:97%
COSTA: Phil, we saw Secretary Clinton endorse former Vice President Joe Biden this week.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.610 position:72%
What's the significance of that, in your view?

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.580 position:88%
PHILIP RUCKER: You know, it's more of a symbolic moment.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.030 position:98%
I mean, the primary race is effectively over, so she didn't really have a choice.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.130 position:97%
We assumed Hillary Clinton was not going to be endorsing Donald Trump - (laughs) - for

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.150 position:97%
reelection, but it nonetheless was a coming together of these two huge forces in

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.270 position:56%
Democratic politics for decades now.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.390 position:98%
The two of them were together, both broadcasting from their homes side by side in sort of

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.060 position:98%
a virtual campaign event, and it was a - it was sort of a passing of the torch from

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.290 position:97%
Clinton, who was the party's standard-bearer four years ago, to Biden.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.210 position:97%
You know, they got along fairly well in the Obama administration, but remember back in

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.920 position:98%
2016, when Hillary Clinton was starting to run, there were all sorts of rumors that Biden

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.660 position:97%
might get in that race, might try to take the nomination from her.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.400 position:98%
He ultimately did not run, but they have been rivals in the past as well.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.280 position:98%
COSTA: Is there any chance, Phil, she could land on the ticket?

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:57.360 position:97%
RUCKER: That seems pretty farfetched, but she certainly meets two of the criteria that

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.310 position:97%
Joe Biden has set out: one, that he wants a woman as his vice presidential nominee; and,

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.450 position:97%
two, that he wants somebody who he thinks is qualified and ready to be president, and we

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.050 position:98%
know he believes that about her. But he - all of the reporting indicates that

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.110 position:98%
Biden is looking to a younger generation of women, people like Kamala Harris;

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.820 position:97%
Gretchen Whitmer, the governor of Michigan; Stacey Abrams down in Georgia.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.480 position:98%
COSTA: I have a little surprise for you, Susan and Phil. We are now joined by

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.260 position:97%
Weijia Jiang from CBS News, who has reappeared on our Extra broadcast.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.620 position:66%
Weijia, welcome. Thank you for being here.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.890 position:75%
WEIJIA JIANG: Thanks so much for having me, Bob.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.210 position:61%
COSTA: We're just talking 2020, Weijia.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.090 position:97%
And Vice President Pence, we didn't get to this in the broadcast, but he drew a lot of

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.930 position:98%
scrutiny this week for not wearing a mask at the Mayo Clinic and then wearing one when he

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.620 position:98%
was in Indiana later in the week. What's going on with him behind the scenes at the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.910 position:98%
White House and his decision to wear a mask or not wear a mask?

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.900 position:98%
JIANG: So this was very dramatic because it was so stark, the images that we saw from

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.230 position:97%
the Mayo Clinic when Vice President Pence went to visit the facilities and talk to

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:11.780 position:97%
doctors as well as patients, and he was the only one who was not wearing a facemask.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.500 position:98%
And his defense was that he was still following the CDC guidelines, and because he is

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:23.390 position:98%
tested often and because those around him are tested often, he knows that he does not

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:28.980 position:97%
have the virus, and that's why he did not wear a mask because it's meant to prevent you,

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.190 position:73%
if you do have it, from spreading it to others.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.850 position:98%
And that defense only drummed up a host of more criticism because doctors have said you

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.790 position:97%
could test for it negative but if - you know, you could possibly have it the very next

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:48.430 position:97%
day. And also, you know, people look to the vice president and the president to set an

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:54.930 position:98%
example, and they've received criticism before for sort of practicing do as I say, not as

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:01.950 position:97%
I do. And so the drama continued when the second lady defended her husband and said,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.930 position:98%
look, the vice president didn't know it was the policy at the Mayo Clinic to wear a

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.540 position:97%
facemask until after he left the facility. Well, of course, the Mayo Clinic had tweeted,

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:19.670 position:97%
you know, almost right after he left there saying that he knew beforehand what the rules were.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:26.990 position:97%
So fast forward a couple days, he visited a ventilator production line in Indiana and he

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.830 position:97%
was wearing a mask. He didn't talk about the controversy because he wasn't asked

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.460 position:97%
about it, but I think his actions spoke clearly and that he was going to do what

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.350 position:97%
he was asking everybody else to do, which is of course to wear a mask.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.710 position:97%
COSTA: Let's stick with this VP, number two, theme. Susan, I was kind of teasing

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.780 position:98%
Phil when I asked him about Secretary Clinton. We all know it's unlikely she is

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.950 position:98%
going to be on the short list, but you never know in politics, of course.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.590 position:97%
But it is a serious point, the VP question, because now - with this allegation of sexual

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.300 position:97%
assault and his denial, and he has decided, as Phil said, to pick a woman to be on the

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:10.110 position:97%
ticket - who he picks is going to perhaps matter as he reaches out to those women voters

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:15.380 position:98%
who may be backing away from President Trump. What are you hearing about that decision?

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.810 position:97%
I know the Biden campaign is moving to formalize the process, but what about the contenders?

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.720 position:98%
PAGE: Right, the former vice president has announced the people who are going to be

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.880 position:97%
handling his vice presidential selection process. By the way, I would take the bet

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.410 position:97%
on Hillary Clinton. Like if you want to take Hillary Clinton could be on the ticket,

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.650 position:97%
I will take that bet for any amount of money. I think that's really - (laughs) - unlikely.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.940 position:97%
Whoever is the - we know that the vice presidential pick is going to be female - Joe

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:50.340 position:98%
Biden has already said that - and that woman is going to have a big load to carry because

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:55.690 position:98%
she is going to need to take Biden's side, defend his record when it comes to the

00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.060 position:97%
treatment of women. She's going to have to counter the Tara Reade allegations,

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.490
wherever they stand at that point.

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.260 position:98%
She is going to need to energize Biden's support among the places where he is weak, and

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:12.160 position:98%
the places where he is weak tend to be young voters, lack of enthusiasm in black voters -

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:17.300 position:98%
that has been a big concern for the Biden camp - and the need to energize women voters,

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.670 position:98%
especially suburban women voters. So they're going to need like a political super woman

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:29.440 position:98%
to join his ticket, and of course, special importance for Joe Biden, he's 77 years old now.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.020 position:98%
He'll set a record, if he's elected, for the age of a president taking office for the

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.720 position:97%
first time. So that means there will special scrutiny that his

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.160 position:98%
vice presidential pick is qualified to step into the role of president.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.670 position:97%
COSTA: I know you all haven't prepared for this, but I've just - I was looking over my

00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:51.010 position:97%
notebook today. I mean, it's just a whirlwind of news. And let's start with you, Phil.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:55.660 position:97%
When you look back at this week and you look ahead to next week, what are you really

00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.710 position:98%
thinking about? What's on the top of your list of - next week I want to pay attention to X?

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.550 position:98%
I'm just really curious what's on your mind after all this torrent of information and news.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:10.310 position:98%
RUCKER: Yeah, well, the most important thing in the coronavirus pandemic that has

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.450 position:97%
happened this week is we've started to see states open. And I think by next week

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.340 position:98%
we're going to have a clearer sense of what that really looks like.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.710 position:97%
Are people willing to leave their homes in a state like Texas?

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:26.050 position:98%
Even though businesses are open, is people's behavior in society different?

00:08:26.050 --> 00:08:30.170 position:98%
Is the psychology different, like Yamiche was talking about with restaurants on the

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:35.050 position:98%
broadcast earlier? And also we want to keep an eye on the coronavirus cases and

00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:39.560 position:97%
death totals in those states that are reopening. Is this going to prove to have been

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:44.960 position:98%
a dangerous and premature decision as a lot of health experts have warned? Or is it not

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.150 position:97%
going to have much of an impact there? I'm going to be looking at all of that next week.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:51.870 position:98%
COSTA: What about you, Weijia? What are you looking at next week?

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:58.300 position:97%
JIANG: You know, to pile on to Phil's point, I'm looking to hear from the health experts

00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:03.080 position:97%
again at the White House, which is something that was pretty sorely missing this week as

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:09.280 position:98%
the death toll continued to climb and as the number of cases continued to grow.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:15.180 position:98%
Again, as we talked about on the broadcast, President Trump relishes that time in the

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.800 position:97%
spotlight, and he wants to be the one in command of the message. But I think

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:26.800 position:97%
Americans are really craving the raw facts and the data from Dr. Birx, from Dr. Fauci,

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.650 position:98%
and they want to know, you know, why the models continue to change, why the numbers

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:38.760 position:98%
continue to grow, and how this reopening from coast to coast is going to impact that.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.300 position:97%
I mean, even though governors are allowing people to do it, at the end of the day, you

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.200 position:98%
know, it's still up to the consumer whether they want to go back and return to some sense

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.770 position:98%
of normalcy. And the irony here is that there are very little physical tools that the

00:09:54.770 --> 00:10:00.080 position:97%
administration can give people to have that peace of mind, but testing is one of them.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.620 position:97%
So that's something I will continue to track and to try to understand about, you know,

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:11.760 position:98%
where we stand in the supply chain because, as of right now, it is not nearly enough and,

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.810 position:98%
you know, it's something that the president will continue to have to answer to.

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.370
COSTA: Susan?

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:23.950 position:98%
PAGE: You know, we're going to head into a new phase of this incredible crisis next week.

00:10:23.950 --> 00:10:30.030 position:98%
We're going to have a patchwork quilt of states with some of them closed down tight, some

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.520 position:98%
of them beginning to open up in a big way, and I think the debate that we're going to see

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.440 position:97%
is the tradeoff between the economic effect of keeping things closed down and the health

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:45.150 position:97%
effect of opening things up. And will different states come to different conclusions

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:50.080 position:97%
about what an acceptable tradeoff will be? That will be what I'm watching.

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.810 position:98%
COSTA: That's it for this edition of the Washington Week Extra.

00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:57.740 position:97%
