 Translator: Ereblir Kadriu Reviewer: Artan Shabani 

00:00:13.942 --> 00:00:17.105
 Thank you very much. 

00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:19.326
 I came to America 12 years ago 

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:21.352
 with my wife Terry and our two children. 

00:00:21.352 --> 00:00:27.788
 In fact, we came to Los Angeles - 

00:00:27.788 --> 00:00:29.545
 thinking we were coming to America. 

00:00:29.545 --> 00:00:35.965
 Either way, it’s a short flight of 

00:00:35.965 --> 00:00:38.846
 Los Angeles in America. 

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:41.059
 I arrived 12 years ago, 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.869
 and when I arrived, I was told some things, 

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:50.319
 as if, "Americans don't understand irony." 

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:53.139
 Have you heard of this idea before? 

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:56.220
 It's not true. I have traveled the entire length and breadth of this state. 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.479
 I have found no evidence that Americans do not understand irony. 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:02.074
 It is one of the cultural myths, 

00:01:02.074 --> 00:01:06.118
 as if, "The British are reserved people." 

00:01:06.118 --> 00:01:08.455
 I don't know why people think that way. 

00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:10.966
 We have conquered every state we have encountered. 

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:14.602
 (Laughter) 

00:01:14.602 --> 00:01:17.126
 It is not true that Americans do not understand irony, 

00:01:17.126 --> 00:01:19.622
 but I want you to know that this is what others do 

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:21.097
 say about you, behind your back. 

00:01:21.097 --> 00:01:24.416
 So when you leave the living rooms in Europe, 

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:28.889
 people say, fortunately no one was ironic in your presence. 

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.619
 I realized that Americans understand irony 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.174
 when I came across the legislation No Child Left Behind. 

00:01:37.174 --> 00:01:42.191
 Because anyone who thinks about this title understands the irony, 

00:01:42.191 --> 00:01:44.043
 or not, because - 

00:01:44.043 --> 00:01:49.866
 (Laughter) (Applause) - 

00:01:49.866 --> 00:01:53.413
 because I'm leaving millions of children behind. 

00:01:53.413 --> 00:01:56.584
 I can say that this is not a very attractive name for a legislation. 

00:01:56.584 --> 00:02:00.208
 Millions of Children Remain Behind. I can understand this title. 

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:01.413
 What is the plan? We propose 

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:03.010
 to leave millions of children behind, 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.489
 and here’s how it will work. 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:08.476
 And it is working wonders. 

00:02:08.476 --> 00:02:09.670
 In some parts of the state, 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.677
 60% of children drop out of high school. 

00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:15.175
 In the communities of Native Americans 

00:02:15.175 --> 00:02:17.403
 80% of children drop out of school. 

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:21.616
 If we halve this number, a calculation 

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:26.050
 indicates it would generate profits for the US economy, 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.902
 so over the next 10 years they will earn $ 10 trillion. 

00:02:30.902 --> 00:02:32.548
 From an economic point of view, 

00:02:32.548 --> 00:02:35.789
 that's a good calculation, isn't it, and we have to do it? 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.138
 In fact, it costs a lot to cover 

00:02:38.138 --> 00:02:42.300
 the damage of the school dropout crisis. 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.029
 But dropping out of school is just the beginning of the iceberg. 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.279
 This does not take into account students who are in school, 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:52.346
 but they are not ungrateful, they do not enjoy school, 

00:02:52.346 --> 00:02:55.436
 and have no benefit from schooling. 

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:56.975
 The reason for this is not 

00:02:56.975 --> 00:02:58.614
 that we are not spending enough money. 

00:02:58.614 --> 00:03:00.531
 America spends more money on education 

00:03:00.531 --> 00:03:02.103
 than most other states. 

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:05.529
 The size of the classes is much smaller than in many other countries. 

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:07.967
 There are hundreds of initiatives every year that 

00:03:07.967 --> 00:03:10.244
 try to improve education. 

00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:14.765
 The problem is that all of this is going in the wrong direction. 

00:03:14.765 --> 00:03:15.934
 Human life develops over 

00:03:15.934 --> 00:03:19.364
 three principles 

00:03:19.364 --> 00:03:23.375
 and these principles are opposed by the culture of education 

00:03:23.375 --> 00:03:25.652
 which most teachers follow, 

00:03:25.652 --> 00:03:28.976
 and most students afford it. 

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:31.540
 The first principle is that human beings 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.228
 are naturally different and varied. 

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:37.529
 Can I ask how many of you 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.754
 do you have children 

00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:43.905
 Good. Granddaughter or granddaughter? 

00:03:43.905 --> 00:03:47.645
 Who has two or more children? 

00:03:47.645 --> 00:03:49.652
 And the rest of you have probably seen such children. 

00:03:49.652 --> 00:03:52.525
 (Laughter) 

00:03:52.525 --> 00:03:55.542
 Little people around. 

00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:57.636
 I will place a bet, 

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:59.066
 and I have confidence that I will win. 

00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:01.551
 If you have two or more children, 

00:04:01.551 --> 00:04:05.380
 bet they are very different from each other. 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.751
 Or not? Or not? (Applause) 

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:12.354
 You're not going to confuse them, are you? 

00:04:12.354 --> 00:04:16.931
 You will not ask. "Who are you? Remember me. 

00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:18.263
 Your mother and I will start using 

00:04:18.263 --> 00:04:21.522
 colors, so we won't confuse you anymore. " 

00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:24.774
 Education According to No Child Left Behind 

00:04:24.774 --> 00:04:29.818
 it is not based on variety, but on adaptation. 

00:04:29.818 --> 00:04:32.376
 Schools are encouraged to find things that 

00:04:32.376 --> 00:04:36.736
 children can do along a narrow spectrum of achievement. 

00:04:36.736 --> 00:04:39.130
 One of the effects of No Child Left Behind 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.086
 has been to narrow the focus 

00:04:41.086 --> 00:04:44.835
 to STEM disciplines. These are very important. 

00:04:44.835 --> 00:04:46.954
 I am not here to oppose science and mathematics. 

00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:51.178
 On the contrary, they are necessary, but not enough. 

00:04:51.178 --> 00:04:53.377
 True education must be given equal importance 

00:04:53.377 --> 00:04:57.114
 arts, humanities, physical education. 

00:04:57.114 --> 00:05:04.298
 Many children ... thank you (Applause) ... 

00:05:04.298 --> 00:05:07.210
 A current calculation in America shows that 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.866
 10% of children who follow this program, 

00:05:09.866 --> 00:05:14.180
 have been diagnosed with various conditions 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.502
 that are part of concentration disorders. 

00:05:18.502 --> 00:05:22.179
 ADHD. I am not saying that this disorder does not exist. 

00:05:22.179 --> 00:05:25.154
 But I do not believe it is such an epidemic. 

00:05:25.154 --> 00:05:27.970
 If you put the kids down, hour after hour, 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.146
 and push them to do clerical work, 

00:05:31.146 --> 00:05:34.435
 don't be surprised if they start to get upset. 

00:05:34.435 --> 00:05:41.913
 (Laughter and applause) 

00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:44.322
 Most of these children do not suffer from 

00:05:44.322 --> 00:05:46.190
 any psychological condition. 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:52.379
 They suffer from childhood. 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.452
 I know this because I spent the early years 

00:05:54.452 --> 00:05:58.306
 of life as a child. I went through all this. 

00:05:58.306 --> 00:06:01.315
 Children progress when they have a lesson plan 

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:03.723
 celebrating various talents, 

00:06:03.723 --> 00:06:05.360
 and not just an extension of them. 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.510
 I mean the arts are not important 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:08.784
 just because they improve points in math. 

00:06:08.784 --> 00:06:10.635
 They are important because they talk to them 

00:06:10.635 --> 00:06:14.150
 parts of children that would remain intact. 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:20.562
 Second..Thank you. 

00:06:20.562 --> 00:06:24.725
 The second principle that drives the progress of 

00:06:24.725 --> 00:06:26.355
 human life, is curiosity. 

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:29.730
 If you can turn on the light of curiosity in a child, 

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:33.343
 they often learn without any other help. 

00:06:33.343 --> 00:06:35.548
 Children are natural students. 

00:06:35.548 --> 00:06:39.864
 It is a real achievement to stop this 

00:06:39.864 --> 00:06:42.010
 skill, or drown it. 

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:46.235
 Curiosity is the engine of achievement. 

00:06:46.235 --> 00:06:48.487
 I say this because one of the effects of the current culture 

00:06:48.487 --> 00:06:52.879
 if I may say so. 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:56.698
 is the de-professionalization of teachers. 

00:06:56.698 --> 00:06:59.050
 There is no school in the world that is 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.930
 or in any state 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:05.028
 which is better than its teachers. 

00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:09.636
 Teachers are the life and success of the school. 

00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:12.615
 But teaching is a creative profession. 

00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:16.048
 Teaching, if understood properly, is not a delivery system. 

00:07:16.048 --> 00:07:18.941
 So, you are not there just to convey the information received. 

00:07:18.941 --> 00:07:21.498
 Good teachers do it, 

00:07:21.498 --> 00:07:24.361
 but what good teachers do is counseling, 

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:27.869
 simulation, provocation, interaction. 

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:30.682
 So, in the end, education is about learning. 

00:07:30.682 --> 00:07:32.402
 If you don't learn, 

00:07:32.402 --> 00:07:34.039
 then there is no education. 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:35.881
 People can spend a lot of time 

00:07:35.881 --> 00:07:38.297
 discussing education without discussing teaching. 

00:07:38.297 --> 00:07:41.186
 The whole purpose of education is to make people learn. 

00:07:41.186 --> 00:07:43.875
 A friend of mine, an old friend-- actually very old 

00:07:43.875 --> 00:07:47.672
 he cdekur. (Laughter) 

00:07:47.672 --> 00:07:53.401
 It is very old. 

00:07:53.401 --> 00:07:58.737
 But he was a wonderful man, a wonderful philosopher. 

00:07:58.737 --> 00:08:01.749
 He talked about the difference between tasks 

00:08:01.749 --> 00:08:05.818
 and achievement. 

00:08:05.818 --> 00:08:07.622
 Thus, you can engage in any activity, 

00:08:07.622 --> 00:08:09.213
 but not by reaching it, 

00:08:09.213 --> 00:08:13.865
 as if dieting. It is a very good example. 

00:08:13.865 --> 00:08:18.531
 Here it is. He is on a diet. Is he losing weight? Not so. 

00:08:18.531 --> 00:08:19.844
 Teaching is a word like this. 

00:08:19.844 --> 00:08:23.816
 You might say, "Here's Deborah, she's in room 34, she's a teacher." 

00:08:23.816 --> 00:08:25.551
 But if no one learns anything, 

00:08:25.551 --> 00:08:27.350
 then she can engage in the teaching task 

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.419
 but in fact not fulfilling it. 

00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:34.266
 The role of the teacher is to facilitate teaching. This is all. 

00:08:34.266 --> 00:08:36.579
 And part of the problem is, I think, 

00:08:36.579 --> 00:08:40.035
 that the dominant culture of education is not in focus 

00:08:40.035 --> 00:08:43.703
 teaching and learning, but testing. 

00:08:43.703 --> 00:08:47.401
 Now, testing is important. Standardization tests are important. 

00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:50.715
 But they cannot be the dominant culture of education. 

00:08:50.715 --> 00:08:52.573
 They must be diagnostic. They need help. 

00:08:52.573 --> 00:09:00.139
 (Applause) 

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:02.603
 If I want to take a medical exam, 

00:09:02.603 --> 00:09:06.187
 I would like standardized tests. 

00:09:06.187 --> 00:09:07.858
 So, I want to know what my cholesterol level is 

00:09:07.858 --> 00:09:10.546
 compared to others in the standard scale. 

00:09:15.555 --> 00:09:18.609
 "Your cholesterol is what we call Orange Level." 

00:09:18.609 --> 00:09:24.297
 Really? Is it okay? "" We don't know. " 

00:09:24.297 --> 00:09:29.364
 But all of this must support learning. I should not hinder him 

00:09:29.364 --> 00:09:31.275
 which usually happens. 

00:09:31.275 --> 00:09:33.441
 So as for curiosity, what do we have 

00:09:33.441 --> 00:09:35.975
 it is the culture of reconciliation. 

00:09:35.975 --> 00:09:38.900
 Our children and teachers are encouraged 

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.499
 to follow the routine algorithm 

00:09:41.499 --> 00:09:45.837
 instead of testing the power of imagination and curiosity 

00:09:45.837 --> 00:09:46.905
 And the third principle is this: 

00:09:46.905 --> 00:09:49.900
 that human life is naturally creative. 

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.308
 That is why we all have different beginnings. 

00:09:52.308 --> 00:09:54.094
 We create our lives, 

00:09:54.094 --> 00:09:56.432
 and we can recreate it as we pass through it 

00:09:56.432 --> 00:09:59.446
 It is the common currency of being human. 

00:09:59.446 --> 00:10:01.979
 This is why human culture is so interesting and diverse 

00:10:01.979 --> 00:10:03.325
 and dynamic. 

00:10:03.325 --> 00:10:06.334
 I mean, other animals may have imagination 

00:10:06.334 --> 00:10:08.614
 and creativity, but there isn’t even that much evidence, 

00:10:08.614 --> 00:10:10.062
 yes no, not how much for us? 

00:10:10.062 --> 00:10:12.638
 You may have had one. 

00:10:12.638 --> 00:10:15.644
 And your dog may be depressed. 

00:10:15.644 --> 00:10:18.099
 So, but he doesn't listen to Radiohead, does he? 

00:10:18.099 --> 00:10:22.019
 (Laughter) 

00:10:22.019 --> 00:10:24.531
 And he stares out the window at a bottle of Jack Daniels. 

00:10:24.531 --> 00:10:28.955
 (Laughter) 

00:10:28.955 --> 00:10:30.616
 And say, "Want to walk?" 

00:10:30.616 --> 00:10:33.747
 He says, "No, I'm fine. 

00:10:33.747 --> 00:10:39.519
 You go, I will wait. But I take pictures. " 

00:10:39.519 --> 00:10:42.433
 We all create our lives through this tireless process 

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.442
 imagining alternatives and opportunities, 

00:10:44.442 --> 00:10:46.681
 and one of the roles of education 

00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:50.717
 is to awaken and develop these competencies of creativity. 

00:10:50.717 --> 00:10:54.277
 Instead, what we have is a culture of standardization. 

00:10:54.277 --> 00:10:58.384
 Then, it shouldn't be that way. It really shouldn't be. 

00:10:58.384 --> 00:11:01.936
 Finland usually comes out first 

00:11:01.936 --> 00:11:03.311
 in mathematics, science and reading. 

00:11:03.311 --> 00:11:05.927
 We know this is what they do best 

00:11:05.927 --> 00:11:07.791
 because that’s all that’s currently being tested. 

00:11:07.791 --> 00:11:09.432
 This is one of the problems of the test. 

00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:15.095
 The issue with Finland's work is this: 

00:11:15.095 --> 00:11:18.474
 they are not affected by these disciplines. 

00:11:18.474 --> 00:11:20.237
 They have a broad approach to education 

00:11:20.237 --> 00:11:24.775
 which includes humanization, physical education, the arts. 

00:11:24.775 --> 00:11:30.511
 Second, there are no standardization tests in Finland. 

00:11:30.511 --> 00:11:32.271
 I mean, there's a little, 

00:11:32.271 --> 00:11:33.822
 but that doesn't wake people up in the morning. 

00:11:33.822 --> 00:11:36.027
 That's not why he keeps them on their desks. 

00:11:36.027 --> 00:11:37.860
 And the third thing, and I was in a meeting last time 

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.287
 with some people from Finland, really Finnish people, 

00:11:41.287 --> 00:11:44.090
 and someone from the American system 

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:45.863
 was telling people in Finland, 

00:11:45.863 --> 00:11:49.782
 "What do you do about the abandonment cycle in Finland?" 

00:11:49.782 --> 00:11:51.403
 And they all looked a little surprised, and said, 

00:11:51.403 --> 00:11:54.252
 "Look, we don't have one. 

00:11:54.252 --> 00:11:56.591
 Why would you leave? 

00:11:56.591 --> 00:11:58.856
 If people are in trouble, we deal with them very quickly 

00:11:58.856 --> 00:12:00.441
 and we help them and support them. " 

00:12:00.441 --> 00:12:02.335
 Now people always say, “Okay, look, 

00:12:02.335 --> 00:12:05.463
 you can't compare Finland with America. " 

00:12:05.463 --> 00:12:06.858
 No. I think in Finland 

00:12:06.858 --> 00:12:08.986
 has a population of about 5 million. 

00:12:08.986 --> 00:12:12.815
 But you can compare it to the state of America. 

00:12:12.815 --> 00:12:16.719
 Many states in America have fewer people in them than that. 

00:12:16.719 --> 00:12:18.386
 I mean, I've been to a few countries in America 

00:12:18.386 --> 00:12:22.199
 and I was the only person there. (Laughter) 

00:12:22.199 --> 00:12:26.572
 Really. Really. I was told to make sure I left. 

00:12:26.572 --> 00:12:30.603
 (Laughter) 

00:12:30.603 --> 00:12:34.536
 But what do performance systems in the world do? 

00:12:34.536 --> 00:12:38.718
 it is now what is not evident, unfortunately 

00:12:38.718 --> 00:12:42.703
 through systems in America-- I mean, as a whole. 

00:12:42.703 --> 00:12:47.637
 One is this: They distinguish between teaching and learning. 

00:12:47.637 --> 00:12:51.103
 They claim that it is the students who are learning 

00:12:51.103 --> 00:12:54.761
 and the system must engage them, their curiosity, 

00:12:54.761 --> 00:12:57.338
 their individuality, and their creativity. 

00:12:57.338 --> 00:12:59.697
 This is how it stimulates them to learn 

00:12:59.697 --> 00:13:03.784
 The second is that they attribute a high status to it 

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:06.065
 teaching profession. 

00:13:06.065 --> 00:13:09.009
 They acknowledge that education cannot be improved 

00:13:09.009 --> 00:13:10.658
 if you do not employ excellent people 

00:13:10.658 --> 00:13:12.517
 and if you do not provide constant support 

00:13:12.517 --> 00:13:14.282
 and professional development. 

00:13:14.282 --> 00:13:17.219
 Investing in professional development is not an expense 

00:13:17.219 --> 00:13:18.625
 It's an investment, 

00:13:18.625 --> 00:13:21.556
 and every country that is having good success knows this, 

00:13:21.556 --> 00:13:26.515
 if it is Australia, Canada, South Korea, Singapore, 

00:13:26.515 --> 00:13:29.961
 Hong Kong or Shanghai. 

00:13:29.961 --> 00:13:33.504
 And the third is, they transfer responsibility 

00:13:33.504 --> 00:13:37.243
 at the school level to do the job as well as possible. 

00:13:37.243 --> 00:13:39.621
 Thus, there is a big difference between 

00:13:39.621 --> 00:13:43.385
 way of command and control in education-- 

00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:44.985
 This is what happens in some systems. 

00:13:44.985 --> 00:13:46.306
 Thus, central governments decide 

00:13:46.306 --> 00:13:47.596
 or state governments decide 

00:13:47.596 --> 00:13:50.591
 they know things better and they will tell you what to do. 

00:13:50.591 --> 00:13:54.318
 The problem is that education does not work 

00:13:54.318 --> 00:13:57.196
 in the commission rooms of legal buildings. 

00:13:57.196 --> 00:14:00.284
 It takes place in classrooms and schools, 

00:14:00.284 --> 00:14:03.357
 and the people who do it are teachers and students, 

00:14:03.357 --> 00:14:06.765
 and if you remove their discretion, the work stops. 

00:14:06.765 --> 00:14:09.815
 You have to put it back on people. 

00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:14.644
 (Duartroktije) 

00:14:14.644 --> 00:14:17.356
 A great job is being done in this country. 

00:14:17.356 --> 00:14:19.499
 But I have to say that this is happening 

00:14:19.499 --> 00:14:22.065
 despite the dominant culture of education, 

00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:23.466
 not because of that. 

00:14:23.466 --> 00:14:27.070
 It seems like people are floating in the opposite direction all the time. 

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.531
 And the reason I think is this: 

00:14:29.531 --> 00:14:32.868
 that most current policies are based on 

00:14:32.868 --> 00:14:35.909
 mechanical conceptions of education. 

00:14:35.909 --> 00:14:39.677
 It seems like education is an industrial process 

00:14:39.677 --> 00:14:42.684
 which can only be improved by having better data, 

00:14:42.684 --> 00:14:44.351
 I think, that in the mind 

00:14:44.351 --> 00:14:46.487
 of some policy makers is this idea that 

00:14:52.436 --> 00:14:55.657
 It will not be done, and it has never been done. 

00:14:55.657 --> 00:14:59.756
 The point is that education is not a mechanical system. 

00:14:59.756 --> 00:15:03.653
 It is a human system. It has to do with people, 

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:06.708
 who are willing or unwilling to learn. 

00:15:06.708 --> 00:15:11.523
 Every student who leaves school has a reason 

00:15:11.523 --> 00:15:13.844
 which is rooted in their biography. 

00:15:13.844 --> 00:15:16.867
 You may find them boring. It may seem out of place to them. 

00:15:16.867 --> 00:15:19.381
 This may seem contradictory to them 

00:15:19.381 --> 00:15:21.925
 with the life they are living outside of school. 

00:15:21.925 --> 00:15:25.764
 There are trends, but the stories remain unique each time. 

00:15:25.764 --> 00:15:28.765
 Finally, I was in a meeting in Los Angeles - 

00:15:28.765 --> 00:15:31.010
 they are called alternative education programs. 

00:15:31.010 --> 00:15:34.413
 These are programs designed to get children back to school. 

00:15:34.413 --> 00:15:36.357
 They have certain features in common. 

00:15:36.357 --> 00:15:38.389
 They are very personalized. 

00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:41.599
 They have total support from teachers, 

00:15:41.599 --> 00:15:43.860
 close ties with the community 

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.486
 and a wide and varied curriculum, 

00:15:45.486 --> 00:15:48.117
 and very often programs in which students are involved 

00:15:48.117 --> 00:15:50.790
 outside the school as well as inside it. 

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.500
 And they work. 

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.902
 What is interesting to me is that, 

00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:57.088
 these are called "alternative education." 

00:15:57.088 --> 00:15:59.270
 You know? 

00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:01.046
 And all the evidence from all over the world is, 

00:16:01.046 --> 00:16:05.272
 if we all did that, there would be no need for an alternative. 

00:16:05.272 --> 00:16:13.692
 (Duartroktije) 

00:16:13.692 --> 00:16:16.540
 So I think we have to choose a different metaphor. 

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:19.197
 We have to accept that this is a human system, 

00:16:19.197 --> 00:16:22.793
 and there are conditions under which people thrive, 

00:16:22.793 --> 00:16:25.698
 and conditions against which they will not flourish. 

00:16:25.698 --> 00:16:28.623
 After all, we are organic creatures, 

00:16:28.623 --> 00:16:33.269
 and school culture is absolutely essential. 

00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:35.697
 Culture is an organic term, isn't it? 

00:16:35.697 --> 00:16:39.426
 Not far from where I live is a place called Death Valley. 

00:16:39.426 --> 00:16:45.098
 Death Valley is the hottest, driest place in America, 

00:16:45.098 --> 00:16:47.900
 and nothing grows there. 

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.524
 Nothing grows there because it doesn’t rain. 

00:16:50.524 --> 00:16:52.917
 Therefore, Death Valley. 

00:16:52.917 --> 00:17:00.064
 In the winter of 2004, it rained in the Death Valley. 

00:17:00.064 --> 00:17:03.836
 Seven inches of rain fell during a very short period. 

00:17:03.836 --> 00:17:09.038
 And in the spring of 2005, it was a phenomenon. 

00:17:09.038 --> 00:17:13.672
 The entire floor of the Death Valley was covered with flowers 

00:17:13.672 --> 00:17:15.428
 for some time. 

00:17:15.428 --> 00:17:20.722
 What is proven is that: Death Valley is not dead. 

00:17:20.722 --> 00:17:23.593
 Is sleeping. 

00:17:23.593 --> 00:17:26.838
 Right in the middle of the surface are these seeds of opportunity 

00:17:26.838 --> 00:17:30.613
 waiting for the right conditions to erupt, 

00:17:30.613 --> 00:17:33.956
 and with organic systems, if the conditions are in order, 

00:17:33.956 --> 00:17:37.685
 life is inevitable. It happens every time. 

00:17:37.685 --> 00:17:40.285
 You get an area, a school, a province, 

00:17:40.285 --> 00:17:43.325
 change the conditions, give people another sense of opportunity. 

00:17:43.325 --> 00:17:44.987
 another group of vulnerabilities, 

00:17:44.987 --> 00:17:46.743
 a wider range of possibilities, 

00:17:46.743 --> 00:17:49.994
 you nurture and value the relationship between teachers and students, 

00:17:49.994 --> 00:17:52.304
 you offer people the choice to be creative 

00:17:52.304 --> 00:17:54.058
 and what they do, 

00:17:54.058 --> 00:17:57.669
 and schools that were once deprived of life. 

00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:59.331
 Great leaders know it. 

00:17:59.331 --> 00:18:01.787
 The real role of leadership in education-- 

00:18:01.787 --> 00:18:04.344
 should not be controlled and commanded by 

00:18:04.344 --> 00:18:05.902
 national, state level 

00:18:05.902 --> 00:18:10.302
 and school level-- 

00:18:10.302 --> 00:18:14.307
 The main role of leadership is environmental control, 

00:18:14.307 --> 00:18:16.909
 creating an environmental opportunity. 

00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:19.306
 And if you do that, people will rise up for it 

00:18:19.306 --> 00:18:22.325
 and last things they did not anticipate 

00:18:22.325 --> 00:18:24.125
 and that they did not expect them. 

00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:26.492
 It's a wonderful saying from Benjamin Franklin. 

00:18:26.492 --> 00:18:29.355
 "There are three types of people in the world: 

00:18:29.355 --> 00:18:31.733
 Those who are immutable 

00:18:31.733 --> 00:18:33.604
 people who don't understand, those who don't want to understand, 

00:18:33.604 --> 00:18:35.001
 those who do everything to achieve. 

00:18:35.001 --> 00:18:36.904
 There are people who are different, 

00:18:36.904 --> 00:18:38.226
 people who see the need for change 

00:18:38.226 --> 00:18:40.872
 and are prepared to listen to it. 

00:18:40.872 --> 00:18:42.723
 And there are people who move, 

00:18:42.723 --> 00:18:44.503
 people who put things in perspective. " 

00:18:44.503 --> 00:18:46.673
 And if we can encourage more people, 

00:18:46.673 --> 00:18:49.339
 this will be a move. 

00:18:49.339 --> 00:18:51.526
 And if the movement is strong enough, 

00:18:51.526 --> 00:18:54.668
 which means, in the good sense of the word, revolution. 

00:18:54.668 --> 00:18:56.447
 And that's what we need. 

00:18:56.447 --> 00:18:57.680
 Thank you very much. 

00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.863
 applause 

00:19:00.863 --> 00:19:05.894
 Thank you very much. (Applause)
