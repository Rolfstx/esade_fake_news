00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 welcome dear lovers 10 chess nice communication mother picture 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.210
 maximum Aryans today we will see how 13 world champion Harry Kasparov spent 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.330
 brilliant attack against us champion fabiano caruana 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:24.820
 [music] this game played since 2016 at the tournament 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.110
 ultimate shave challenge where harry kasparov fought with the best chess player 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.300
 usa and here is fabiano caruana making the first move horse f3 horse f6 answer harry 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.370
 Kasparov g3 is our reti debut and now we will see what is prepared for 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.470
 Harry Kimovich and against this boring beginning, so we have complete 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.250
 symmetry apparently wants to dry Harry in this 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.500
 the party is by the way the last batch in this 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.960
 tournament and maybe harry is already tired all the more he is no longer a young man like you 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.610
 You know, he quit chess for quite some time, but he will return to the game so far. 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.729
 us going leisurely and development and 5 play harry caspars based on 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.180
 old Indian defense against fabiano caruana decided to picket both elephants 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.020
 curly affect the center but maybe now he doesn’t want to spend more 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.720
 and d4 that is, not only in figures of such 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.800
 center but also by pawns so c5 playing harry caspars without giving an opportunity 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.330
 play d2d 4 but this move has a minus field t5 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.759
 now the horse is loosening, it can go to the center then the second horse will go to e1 well 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.990
 and in general a policy of up to 5 white can occupy but no other plan has chosen 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.209
 he wants to play d4 anyway, so he played e3 caspars with the game 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:46.479
 horse c6 added a strike to the d4 field but also develops 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.690
 a horse and now Fabiano Caruana’s fundamental choice is developing a horse 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.940
 on zither as if at 5 now the elephant d3 already wants to go somewhere in the Harry variants 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.560
 Kasparov therefore needs to react somehow 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.489
 now is the time to play d4 then maybe it can be too late 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:11.290
 because black can really block this field play slando 3 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.110
 then e4 that is, a mechanical block such 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.950
 put therefore to 4 plays caruana does everything right and 4 followed on 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.580
 the right answer, but this answer is neutralization, and Harry Kasparov remembers everything he has 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.239
 the same position stood for eighty years against chess players 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.520
 for simon international master roughly and harry 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.319
 Kasparov has a simply phenomenal circus memory remembers almost everything 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:44.060
 his parties since childhood and even sessions of simultaneous play that is, he has 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.110
 really brilliant memory and this is not the opposition stood on the board 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.680
 only there the horse on the same 5 removed the web sim and here the fabian took the horse to e1 and here 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.930
 led him to t2 now we will see if this route is better or not and Kasparov 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.970
 start offensive plays h5 now he wants to play h4 and this is the standard plan 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.230
 in such positions the pawn goes our 4 then maybe on h3 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.290
 the queen is on d7, that is, here Black has a very clear plan of attack on the king and White 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.230
 start the contour game on the queenside and here the question is who will create faster 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.750
 problems the race begins literally this formula 1 on the chessboard and now we 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.640
 let's see who is faster than the 53-year-old Kasparov for the 24-year-old 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.709
 fabiano caruana chess speed is not determined for years as you understand 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.170
 and skill and so Harry thought thinks ahead 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.510
 prepares an attack plan because there are many obvious moves, for example, text b7 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.060
 play or h40 is very deeply immersed in a position even in blitz 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.680
 in games and running ahead I’ll say that now you need to prepare a pen and 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.360
 leaflet because you will see just a brilliant example 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.910
 attacks on the king from the world champion lessons from the champion are doubly valuable 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.220
 so remember what will now show you harry kasparov remind 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.260
 you friends that the tournament in which harry kasparov will return to chess will take place 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.900
 already in August from August 14 to August 18 and we will broadcast all this action in 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.680
 live on this channel so don't miss 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.220
 be sure to subscribe to the channel put a bell so as not to 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.090
 skip live because it will be very interesting and many 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.419
 invited grandmasters so now back to the party 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:43.160
 Harry Kimovich thought giving me the opportunity to talk but Kalash 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.510
 muddy topic once again remind that very soon will be his return 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.720
 so he plays with 4 is the standard promotion of such 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.460
 positions he can occasionally play even h3 to lock the white elephant 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.770
 he will have to leave on the field h1 but there is also an idea to play from 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.389
 to weaken the coverage of the white king so it’s advisable to hold a pawn for now 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.190
 on the h4 field to save room for maneuver, but Fabian thought 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.600
 because he doesn’t know how to stop this avalanche attack, but it cost him 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.410
 play h3 judges 4 of us, he plays the same 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.070
 or not and opens up and if black plays say queen b7 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.510
 then we can play the same 4 without fear of the sacrifice of an elephant because here we have 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:31.130
 here is f3 and as a result, white fights off while preserving even the extra 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:39.139
 a piece so that the h3 move allowed to hold the position but as if 3 plays Fabiano 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:43.940
 Karuana and Kasparov just didn’t understand where he put the aslans, but he attacked a pawn 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.310
 c5 and I want to play b4, that is, there are two ideas for this move so that 6 plays 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.380
 Kasparov defended the pawn away from sin, but could not even defend it on 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.720
 in fact, just in case, in a blitz, it’s especially useful to protect a pawn so that 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.110
 nowhere to miscalculate, but she thinks about the cortex. 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.590
 counterplay is here to develop a nose he plays 4 and what's next 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:14.360
 both 4 can even hit several times the Fabian diode thought bitter 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.180
 painful thoughts he began Kasparov clearly pleased with his position 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.310
 even the non-verbalise shows why he prefers to play for black here and 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:29.539
 By the way, the order is a fit of a black shirt that fits perfectly to the image 

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:35.389
 killers somewhere one play child ru she wants somewhere on foot to 6 maybe 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:41.300
 I grab but I got it right there and I own it I had to remove Kasparov I'm sure 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.650
 himself and column 1 to 7, the queen wants to transfer to the field and at 5 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.690
 also there is still an idea to play scrapping h3 well, rather queen at five because our 3 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:55.610
 without threats there as if one will be four play the cortex she wants to hide 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.800
 lines to somehow distract the power of black from his king because 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.580
 if you do nothing then really now the queen on f5 will move all the pieces 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:10.340
 rebuild and checkmate the white king and now Kasparov thinks how 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:17.659
 maximally effectively rebuild your pieces playing the queen in turn 5 is very 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:21.560
 logical elephant now threatens to move to f3 queen 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.090
 h5 also has an idea of ​​it let's look at the clock for two minutes 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:32.240
 the Koran’s rivals left even a little more time but still time 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.240
 enough they will now begin the hottest part of the party all that came before 

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:44.800
 this can be called with people right now the fun begins 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:50.780
 so Karl she thinks and in fact it’s time to burn bridges there is nothing left to lose 

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.949
 position is just the hardest game islam b2 it's a victim 

00:07:54.949 --> 00:08:00.139
 you can play pawns on being four but Kasparov, even I think not 

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:05.419
 pay attention to this pawn because it has a sweeter target 

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:09.740
 the white king so far is getting along well up to 8 to protect you need 6 but now no 

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:15.560
 dc care because there after black dc capture the line and yes but 

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:20.210
 something good to suggest for Fabian is not so easy to play for them 5 

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:25.669
 attack a pawn up to 6 on occasion, that is, chain the rook to the pawn defense plus 

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:30.680
 maybe at 7 it’ll take it somewhere, as if in 3 it’s playing Kasparov already starting to change 

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.450
 figures who are involved in the defense of the king as if 2 he is the main 

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.810
 protector the main bodyguard and here it is 

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:44.380
 trying to eliminate harry kasparov really acts like a hit man 

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:51.890
 first removes all bodyguards then already gets to the boss with us 

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:57.200
 this will be the forensic theme of this party but it's all because of the shirt 

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.839
 kasparova like jason stetham in the movie parker d5 play fabiano caruana 

00:09:01.839 --> 00:09:06.680
 opens the way for the elephant plus attacks the horse some changes nevertheless 

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.800
 occur because it was as if inactive now he at least has 

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.050
 green work can be exchanged for horse f6 so that this horse does not take part in 

00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:18.709
 attack horses 5 plays Kasparov changed horse 

00:09:18.709 --> 00:09:25.740
 own e5 horses one horse connected to the defense it seems that somehow 

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:32.910
 consolidate the defense of Fabiano Caruana and now let's see if Harry Kimovich succeeds 

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:37.760
 u find some additional resources to attack here because 

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:41.519
 really horse connected to the defense word here 

00:09:41.519 --> 00:09:48.680
 plus changed the important horse it seems that the worst is behind, in fact it is only 

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:54.060
 I cheer up fans of Fabiano Caruana because Harry Kasparov is merciless 

00:09:54.060 --> 00:10:00.959
 to play from the same one was chosen by the brother as much as he thought or a pawn f but if a pawn 

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:07.889
 you can take it there just by the line or drop by play r for pc 5 then g4 horse 

00:10:07.889 --> 00:10:13.170
 therefore already plays but so that watering 2 appears at the king's escape, plus the queen 

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:18.569
 maybe our pawn can also go to it; 3 it can go as if 6 is playing Kasparov 

00:10:18.569 --> 00:10:26.160
 attacked the e3 pawn just in case Fabian played db-1 in cold blood king 

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.290
 the same 7 just wants a rook on the line already put light h8 give him along the line 

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:36.679
 that is, all the pieces connected to the attack caspars in diablo 3 played Caruana and 

00:10:36.679 --> 00:10:42.269
 it turns out that you own 8 you can’t play because you walk up to 6 therefore 

00:10:42.269 --> 00:10:46.980
 Kasparov thinks how can he activate his rook immediately seemed 

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:53.009
 h8 no so you need to look for some other ways to strengthen the position of a 

00:10:53.009 --> 00:10:56.819
 there isn’t much time, Kasparov has forty seconds left, just a game 

00:10:56.819 --> 00:11:01.529
 queen h5 do you want to play d4 knight and attack a pawn already 2 + pawn on e3 

00:11:01.529 --> 00:11:06.209
 will hang, that is, again, the voltage hung over 

00:11:06.209 --> 00:11:10.669
 a white king 

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:18.970
 fabiano thinks he’s principle still has 44 seconds but time isn’t too thick 

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:22.990
 as they say how is it here to defend play h3 

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:29.110
 wants to play 4 is the idea to which we spoke earlier he wants to drive the enemy 

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:34.630
 from his territory to drive the entire black army into his camp, Kasparov thinks 

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.620
 play conner 7 of course 5 wants to connect to put pressure on a pawn as many as three 

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:44.290
 plus the root can jump on f3 how to defend against this plan to play the same 4 

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.810
 drives the enemy but Kasparov does not run and takes the battle to sacrifice an elephant for two 

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:54.040
 pawns and it turns out that running away with the king is now completely not 

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.269
 it seems possible because on korolev Vadim will own 5 and beyond 

00:11:58.269 --> 00:12:03.370
 the path to the king is circumcised therefore try to change the queens Fabian &amp; grafix to 1 but 

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:08.949
 Of course, Harry Kasparov refuses the column g3 and now the position is even more 

00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:14.170
 aggravated pawn on e3 freezes threatens to hold h5 threatens horse same 5 threatens 

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:19.060
 all any move creates a threat to the white king ending 5 plays Kasparov 

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:23.769
 connects the knight to all the same black pieces involved the offensive 

00:12:23.769 --> 00:12:29.350
 king h1 but it is certainly a very confident departure into the corner with something that the line already 

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:33.310
 fully exposed it looks like suicide water h8 play caspars 

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:38.050
 connects the last piece to the attack and the king g8 just clears the way 

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:43.509
 his elephant wants to steal a crowbar axis to eat a horse on the field to 6 and he plays 

00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:49.089
 their 8 shah the king is one horse h3 korolev one ate a horse now here I am their 5 step 

00:12:49.089 --> 00:12:56.199
 threatens what to do in by it is 5 seconds left he takes a horse you own 5 check a horse 

00:12:56.199 --> 00:13:02.019
 f3 have to play and after owning f3 fabiana admitted defeat because 

00:13:02.019 --> 00:13:05.670
 what to take and there will be just verses one magician 

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:11.760
 here is such a brilliant party of 13 world champion he showed how to 

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.910
 attack so friends but all you liked 

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:19.050

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:23.070
