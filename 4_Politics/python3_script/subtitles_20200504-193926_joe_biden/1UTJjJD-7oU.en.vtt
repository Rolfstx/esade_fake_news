00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.333
- There's no one
I'd rather talk politics with

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.566
than Macey Hensley.

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:04.733
She's only five years old,

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.433
and even though I spent
two weeks in college,

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:09.466
Macey knows way more about
presidential history than I do.

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:12.800
Here she is, the future
President of the United States.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.100
So you know
all about presidents.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.966
When did you start
learning about presidents?

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.866
- Oh, when I was about--

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:20.233
Oh...

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:21.466
Since I was four.

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.100
- Four.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.666
And you're five now.
So about a year now.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:25.933
- Yeah.

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:27.500
- And what made you get
interested in presidents?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.800
- Oh, well, I started
telling everybody

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.566
the presidents on money.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:35.933
And I was asking
for everybody's Jackson.

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:39.633
- Uh-huh.
Oh. Very smart.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:41.300
- Well, then after that

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.933
my grandma bought me
some flashcards.

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:45.366
- Mm-hmm.
- With the presidents.

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:46.500
- Right.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.333
- And on the back,
I started reading facts.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:50.533
- Uh-huh.

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.200
- And so that's how.
- That's how.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
- And also books.
- Yes.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.933
You read books at five?
- Yeah.

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:59.366
- Okay, um, and I heard
you made up a song

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:01.000
so you could remember
all the presidents.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.200
- Yeah.
- Can we hear the song?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.266
- Sure.
- Okay.

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:05.000

Really good.

00:01:45.766 --> 00:01:47.666
Oh.

00:01:47.666 --> 00:01:49.466
That's amazing.

00:01:49.466 --> 00:01:51.466
[cheers and applause]

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:56.033
Wow.

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.466
I'm not gonna be able to get
that out of my head tonight.

00:01:58.466 --> 00:02:01.733
That's--
[laughter]

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.466
Who's your favorite
president?

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:04.633
- Zachary Taylor.

00:02:04.633 --> 00:02:05.800
- And why is that?

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.033
- 'Cause he wears blue.

00:02:07.033 --> 00:02:09.066
'Cause he was a general
in the Mexican War,

00:02:09.066 --> 00:02:10.700
and blue's my favorite color.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.700
- Oh, blue's
my favorite color too.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.600
So he's my favorite president
now too.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.000
[chuckles]

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.966
And so you wanted a Zachary
Taylor-themed birthday cake

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:20.233
and a whole party, right?

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:22.200
- Yeah, but I didn't get it.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.466
My mom just got me
a White House cake instead.

00:02:25.466 --> 00:02:27.566
- Oh, well, that's nice, huh?

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:29.733
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.833
[cheers and applause]

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.833
Have you been
to the White House?

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:38.500
- Nope.
- Oh, you should go.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.900
That would be nice, right?
- Yeah.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.066
- I think so too.

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:42.800
What do you want to do
when you grow up?

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.433
- Become president.

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:47.266
- I want you to.
[cheers and applause]

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:50.566
I love that.

00:02:50.566 --> 00:02:52.566
And why do you want
to become president?

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:54.700
- So I can eat
all the candy I want.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.233
- Ah.
[laughter]

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:01.800
Oh, that's as good a reason
as any.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.466
So I'm gonna test you on your
presidential knowledge, okay?

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:06.866
- Okay.
- And so the first one is...

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:08.166
- Washington.

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:10.266
- And tell me what you know
about George Washington.

00:03:10.266 --> 00:03:12.600
- Um...

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.400
- Who was the first lady?
- Martha.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.733
- Mm-hmm.
And the vice president?

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:16.900
- John Adams.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.266
- Any fun fact?

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:21.533
- Um, the story of
the cherry tree wasn't true.

00:03:21.533 --> 00:03:23.533
A newspaper man
just made it up

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:25.366
so people would like him.

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:26.900
- Wow.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.566
They were making stuff up
back then.

00:03:28.566 --> 00:03:29.833
- Oh!
- That's amazing.

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:31.433
- One more.

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:33.633
By the time
of Washington's presidency,

00:03:33.633 --> 00:03:37.233
he only had
one real tooth left.

00:03:37.233 --> 00:03:39.233
[laughter]

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.866
- I like that fun fact.
Who's this?

00:03:48.866 --> 00:03:50.200
- John Quincy Adams.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.566
- And who was the first lady?

00:03:51.566 --> 00:03:52.733
- Louisa.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.433
- And the vice president was?

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:56.166
- John C. Calhoun.

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:58.366
- Okay, do you have
any fun facts on him?

00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:00.433
- He swam naked
in the Potomac.

00:04:00.433 --> 00:04:02.266
[laughter]

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.233
Oh, and he also
had a pet alligator.

00:04:08.233 --> 00:04:09.700
- A pet alligator?

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.300
That seems dangerous,
doesn't it?

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.100
- Yeah.
- I think you know who this is.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.666
- Zachary Taylor.
- That's too easy.

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:18.000
And there's a fun fact
that doesn't seem so fun.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.800
What's the fun fact here?

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.333
- Oh.

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.766
He wore a wool suit
to the Fourth of July,

00:04:24.766 --> 00:04:26.566
and he got too hot.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:30.333
Then he drank
two full glasses of milk

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:33.033
and some cherries,
and that's how he died.

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:36.900
Some people thought that
the cherries were poisonous.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.600
[laughter]

00:04:41.733 --> 00:04:43.800
[applause]

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.000
- Oh.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.200
Well, I could just do this
all day long.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.266
Who's this?

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:53.066
- Rutherford B. Hayes.
- Uh-huh.

00:04:53.066 --> 00:04:55.466
And who was
the vice president?

00:04:55.466 --> 00:04:57.600
- Uh...
William Wheeler.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.533
- Yeah, sure.
You remember that guy.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:03.166
Fun fact?

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:05.466
He was the first president
to have what?

00:05:05.466 --> 00:05:07.466
- A telephone.
- And what was his phone number?

00:05:07.466 --> 00:05:10.200
- One.
[laughter]

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.866
Oh, also his wife,
they called her Lemonade Lucy

00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:19.200
'cause she never served alcohol
at the White House.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.833
- Oh.
[laughs]

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.200
Oh, this is fantastic.
