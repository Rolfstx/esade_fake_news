-Hello, everyone, and welcome
back to the attic.

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:04.604
As many of you know, I've been
doing the show from home

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:06.472
despite some non-ideal
circumstances,

00:00:06.472 --> 00:00:08.274
specifically I only have
three shirts,

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.109

different varieties --

00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.012
blue, blue, and a slightly
lighter blue.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:16.148
And, yeah, I'm aware that this
makes me, as the kids say,

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:18.885
"basic," but in fairness,
I've been slightly distracted

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:21.388
from wardrobe questions by the
fact that there are wasps --

00:00:21.388 --> 00:00:23.323

The reason it was such
a hot topic for a while

00:02:52.405 --> 00:02:54.474
was because everyone was afraid
we were going to run out.

to make ventilators,

First of all,
there are major companies

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:15.300
before there are plans to
effectively contain

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.969
the spread of the virus.

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.971
-The goal here is to get people
back to work.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:21.440
The eternal lockdown crowd
can make jokes

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.309
on late-night television,
but the reality is,

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:27.246
is that the data is on our side.
-Oh, my God.

00:07:27.246 --> 00:07:29.281
First of all,
thank you for watching.

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:31.817
[ Chuckles ] Sorry about that
Tom Brady joke, so stupid.

00:07:31.817 --> 00:07:34.921
But also, I'm kind of terrified
that you're watching.

00:07:34.921 --> 00:07:36.154
Now I'm going to have nightmares

00:07:36.154 --> 00:07:38.290
about that tiny door back there
creaking open

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.860
and seeing Jared Kushner's face
in the shadows.

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.897
Second, no one wants
eternal lockdowns.

00:07:44.897 --> 00:07:46.532
If I see another one of my
friends holding up

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:48.534
a janky loaf of homemade bread
on Instagram,

00:07:48.534 --> 00:07:50.502
I'm going to run outside
and lick a banister.

00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:53.673
We want a plan for re-opening
things safely.

00:07:53.673 --> 00:07:56.842
You think I don't want things
to open up?

00:07:56.842 --> 00:08:00.345
I used to do a show with
multiple shirts and zero wasps.

00:08:00.345 --> 00:08:02.648
I worked in a building that had
50 lunch options.

00:08:02.648 --> 00:08:03.749
Now the only thing on the menu

00:08:03.749 --> 00:08:05.050
is whatever the boys
don't finish.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:07.119
Which isn't much, mind you,
because the 2-year-old

00:08:07.119 --> 00:08:08.820
eats like a horse and he has
the dumps to prove it.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.089
I just changed his diaper.

00:08:10.089 --> 00:08:11.590
You know when I'll have
to change the next one?

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.493
Based on recent patterns,
any minute now.

00:08:14.493 --> 00:08:15.527
You know what this, bro?

00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:16.896
You know what this is
right here?

00:08:16.896 --> 00:08:18.697
It's a [bleep] space heater.

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:21.500
And I have it because
I'm cold all the time.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.069
I always feel like
you just looked at me.

00:08:24.069 --> 00:08:25.471
I mean, I used to have
an audience

00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:27.206
of human beings who laughed
at jokes.

00:08:27.206 --> 00:08:29.575
Now the only thing watching me
are the dead black eyes

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:31.243
of a stuffed elephant rocker.

00:08:31.243 --> 00:08:35.781
So, yeah, I want to go
back to normal, too.

00:08:35.781 --> 00:08:38.284
Now, not only is
the administration's response

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:40.419
not a success story,
in reality,

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.855
we're learning that the death
toll is almost certainly

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.424
an undercount, according
to analysis of CDC data

00:08:45.424 --> 00:08:46.692
by "The New York Times"
this week.

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:48.494
And if you're looking for
a metric to compare

00:08:48.494 --> 00:08:50.897
our so-called success story
to actual success stories

00:08:50.897 --> 00:08:52.664
in other countries,
there's this --

00:08:52.664 --> 00:08:54.833
We recorded our first case
of coronavirus

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:58.370
on the same day that South Korea
recorded theirs.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.806
And this week, while we
were passing 1 million cases,

00:09:00.806 --> 00:09:03.075
South Korea was reporting
that they had reported

00:09:03.075 --> 00:09:05.344
no new domestic cases
of COVID-19

00:09:05.344 --> 00:09:07.179
for the first time since
February.

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:08.313
That's right. In South Korea,

00:09:08.313 --> 00:09:10.616
they're down to zero
new domestic cases,

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:12.151
while over here,
the president is suggesting

00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:13.685
we should gnaw
on the Tide To Go pens

00:09:13.685 --> 00:09:14.854
like they're bread sticks.

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:17.255
And not only is our case load
much higher,

00:09:17.255 --> 00:09:19.725
but the federal government
has also failed to provide

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:22.461
any leadership at all in
responding to that case load.

00:09:22.461 --> 00:09:25.197
In fact, Trump has failed
so spectacularly

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:27.366
to provide any coherent
federal coordination

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:29.835
that states have essentially
divvied themselves up

00:09:29.835 --> 00:09:31.604
into regional partnerships
to work together,

00:09:31.604 --> 00:09:33.672
basically forming
mini-federal governments.

00:09:33.672 --> 00:09:36.441
There's a Western States Pact
that includes

00:09:36.441 --> 00:09:38.076
California and Oregon,

00:09:38.076 --> 00:09:40.245
a Midwest partnership between
Illinois and Michigan

00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:41.514
and five other states,

00:09:41.514 --> 00:09:43.382
and a regional advisory council
of seven states

00:09:43.382 --> 00:09:44.783
including New York
and New Jersey.

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:46.084
First of all,
I just want to say,

00:09:46.084 --> 00:09:47.753
I'm genuinely happy to see
New York and New Jersey

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.521
working together after
their years long feud

00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:51.624
over who actually owns the Jets.
"It's you."

00:09:51.624 --> 00:09:53.693
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
You take them. We're good."

00:09:53.693 --> 00:09:56.228
"No, no, no, I think
it's definitely you."

00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:58.597
Second, look at this,
I knew Republicans

00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:00.833
loved the confederacy, but
I don't think they literally

00:10:00.833 --> 00:10:02.368
wanted to break up the Union.

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:04.303
The country is broken down
into districts,

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:05.770
we're facing meat shortages,

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:07.739
and the postal service
is warning it could collapse.

00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:09.441
We're like a week away from
Trump announcing

00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:11.310
the first annual hunger games.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.946
[ As Trump ] Pennsylvania,
who do you send as tribute?

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:17.716
[ Spooky Philly accent ] We send
a most enticing creature.

00:10:17.716 --> 00:10:20.352
[ Normal voice ]
Pretty good Philadelphia accent.

00:10:20.352 --> 00:10:23.522
[ Spooky Philly accent ]
His name is Gritty.

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:25.924
[ Normal voice ] In fact,
just to give you an idea

00:10:25.924 --> 00:10:27.760
of how miserably that Trump
has failed

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.628
at even the most basic aspects
of his job,

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:32.865
here's a truly insane story
about what officials in Illinois

00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:35.701
had to do just to get masks
for healthcare workers

00:10:35.701 --> 00:10:37.003
without federal leadership.

00:10:37.003 --> 00:10:39.004
Illinois officials tracked down
a supply

00:10:39.004 --> 00:10:41.073
of 1.5 million potentially
life-saving

00:10:41.073 --> 00:10:44.510
N-95 respirator masks in China
through a middleman

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.046
in the Chicago area and
negotiated a deal to buy them.

00:10:47.046 --> 00:10:49.081
One day before they were
expecting to complete

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.517
the purchase, they got a call in
the morning from the supplier,

00:10:51.517 --> 00:10:53.619
informing them he had to get
a check to the bank

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:55.488
by 2:00 p.m. that day,
or the deal was off.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.256
Other bidders had surfaced.

00:10:57.256 --> 00:10:59.324
Illinois' Assistant Comptroller
Ellen Andres

00:10:59.324 --> 00:11:02.094
jumped into her car and raced
north on I-55

00:11:02.094 --> 00:11:03.862
with a check for $3.5 million.

00:11:03.862 --> 00:11:05.430
They arranged to meet
in the parking lot

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.466
of a McDonald's restaurant
just off the interstate

00:11:07.466 --> 00:11:09.768
and they made the handoff there.

00:11:09.768 --> 00:11:10.836
That is insane.

00:11:10.836 --> 00:11:12.738
We're talking about
protective gear

00:11:12.738 --> 00:11:14.173
for frontline healthcare workers

00:11:14.173 --> 00:11:15.874
and states are forced to do
million-dollar deals

00:11:15.874 --> 00:11:17.876
in McDonald's parking lots
like they're buying meth

00:11:17.876 --> 00:11:18.977
from Walter White.

00:11:18.977 --> 00:11:20.712
If New Mexico wants to buy
ventilators,

00:11:20.712 --> 00:11:21.814
they're going to have
to go to the basement

00:11:21.814 --> 00:11:23.415
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

00:11:23.415 --> 00:11:26.852
So, needless to say,
good news is hard to come by

00:11:26.852 --> 00:11:29.688
these days, but on Wednesday,
we did finally get

00:11:29.688 --> 00:11:32.524
some genuinely good news
when it was announced

00:11:32.524 --> 00:11:34.860
that a potential therapy
for COVID-19

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.396
had proven effective in a
randomized clinical trial

00:11:37.396 --> 00:11:39.031
as Dr. Anthony Fauci explained

00:11:39.031 --> 00:11:40.599
during a meeting
in the Oval Office.

00:11:40.599 --> 00:11:44.403
-Right now, I can bring you
one of the best headlines

00:11:44.403 --> 00:11:46.572
since coronavirus took hold
of the United States.

00:11:46.572 --> 00:11:49.508
Here it is, the potential
for a true treatment.

00:11:49.508 --> 00:11:51.843
Now, there are no approved
medications for coronavirus.

00:11:51.843 --> 00:11:53.211
But just a short time ago,

00:11:53.211 --> 00:11:55.280
the nation's leading infectious
disease expert

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.183
said the result of this
randomized controlled study

00:11:58.183 --> 00:11:59.885
for this drug called remdesivir

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:04.089
is according to Dr. Fauci,
quite good news.

00:12:04.089 --> 00:12:05.524
Why you ask?

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:08.594
Because it showed remdesivir
appeared to be effective

00:12:08.594 --> 00:12:11.463
and helped people recover more
quickly once they were sick.

00:12:11.463 --> 00:12:14.199
-The data shows that remdesivir

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:17.970
has a clear-cut significant
positive effect

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.207
in diminishing the time
to recovery.

00:12:22.207 --> 00:12:25.044
This is really quite important
for a number of reasons,

00:12:25.044 --> 00:12:26.878
and I'll give you the data.

00:12:26.878 --> 00:12:28.114
It's highly significant.

00:12:28.114 --> 00:12:30.649
It is a very important
proof of concept.

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:33.252
Because what it has proven

00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:36.489
is that a drug
can block this virus.

00:12:36.489 --> 00:12:37.689
-You know when Trump heard that,

00:12:37.689 --> 00:12:39.191
he so badly wanted to pipe up
and say,

00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:40.392
[ As Trump ] All right,
that's great news,

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:43.929
but should we maybe pair that
with lights?

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:46.331
Just next time we do a study,
give them that?

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:49.267
You know, remdesivir
and then maybe a lava lamp

00:12:49.267 --> 00:12:51.437
or something might double
the effectiveness,

00:12:51.437 --> 00:12:53.539
and then we'd both be right,
you know, the scientists

00:12:53.539 --> 00:12:56.641
who spend time with clinical
studies and then me,

00:12:56.641 --> 00:12:59.011
the guy who said "light."

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:00.546
[ Normal voice ] But what's
especially notable about

00:13:00.546 --> 00:13:02.514
this genuinely promising news
is that it comes after months

00:13:02.514 --> 00:13:03.582
of the president floating

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:05.584
one unproven miracle cure
after another,

00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:07.953
each getting more desperate and
more dangerous than the last.

00:13:07.953 --> 00:13:11.257
-It's a little like the regular
flu that we have flu shots for

00:13:11.257 --> 00:13:13.491
and we'll essentially
have a flu shot for this

00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:14.960
in a fairly quick manner.

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.028
You take a solid flu vaccine,

00:13:17.028 --> 00:13:18.497
you don't think that would
have an impact

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:21.099
or much of an impact on corona?
-No.

00:13:21.099 --> 00:13:23.835
-They're going to have vaccines,
I think, relatively soon,

00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:27.973
and they're going to have
something

00:13:27.973 --> 00:13:30.875
that makes you better and that's
going to actually take place,

00:13:30.875 --> 00:13:32.277
we think, even sooner.

00:13:32.277 --> 00:13:35.080
And I hope they use
the hydroxychloroquine.

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.216
It will be a gift from heaven,
and it works.

00:13:38.216 --> 00:13:41.420
Is there a way we can do
something like that?

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:46.959
By injection inside
or almost a cleaning?

00:13:46.959 --> 00:13:49.661
I would like you to speak
to the medical doctors

00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:52.731
to see if there is any way
that you can apply

00:13:52.731 --> 00:13:56.568
light and heat to cure.

00:13:56.568 --> 00:13:58.870
-When you heard
an 18th-century doctor

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.339
say "apply light and heat
to cure,"

00:14:01.339 --> 00:14:03.041
you knew were a goner.

00:14:03.041 --> 00:14:05.177
"So, bad news, the leeches
didn't work.

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:08.914
But we can still try
light and heat.

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:12.150
Though, maybe,
get your affairs in order."

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:14.419
It's not hard to look at
countries like South Korea

00:14:14.419 --> 00:14:16.655
and see what an actual success
story would have looked like.

00:14:16.655 --> 00:14:19.157
We could have had
an early robust response

00:14:19.157 --> 00:14:20.358
to contain the spread
of the virus

00:14:20.358 --> 00:14:21.693
and allowed things
to remain open.

00:14:21.693 --> 00:14:24.596
Instead I'm stuck here
in my attic dodging wasps
