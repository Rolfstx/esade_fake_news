00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:22.769
Might be interesting that... Let's
see needs have people hostage or engage

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.640
in ransom taking to get 100% of your way they're trying to

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.420
hold veterans hostage to force Obamacare
on the American people you cannot

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.079
negotiate with a hostage situation we've
got a group to think that they can hold

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:41.910
America hostage the president somehow
wants to keep this hostage they've taken

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.289
hostages no person should be held
hostage holding our government hostage

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:54.570
holding the u.s. hostage hold the entire
country hostage oh they took hostage

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.940
well Thursday thanks for hostages they
had to take the country hostage

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.369
whether or not it's it's it's correct to
kind of use the hostage terms of by

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.479
politicians when you see this as
somebody who's negotiated a lot when you

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
see what's going on Washington what
jumps out to you well there's two things

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.850
about that you know on a personal note I
like that they use the word because then

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.150
it gives me a chance to be on your show

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.780
focus on anything his company is called
the Black Swan group that is the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.040
baddest-ass name I have ever heard I
love that now what is the Black Swan

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.619
group that's like the coolest what is
that thank you very much a Black Swan is

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.860
something unusual that has a great
impact and we like to think that the way

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.299
we negotiate is a great impact

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:51.660
all right how often do you get a chance
to make Anderson Cooper laughs right all

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.600
right but there's actually a negotiation
lesson in there which I'll get to in a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.360
minute but I you know I can remember I
was sitting there then and they've got

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.880
you in a room that's kind of a dark
closet a light shines in your eyes and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.230
you wait to come on and I'm hearing like
hostage this hostage that Barack Obama

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.360
hostage taking a country hostage and I'm
thinking you know I don't know this

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.500
seems like a straight line I just can't
let this go one of the things that we

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.000
talked about in negotiation and how you
will get better as a negotiator never be

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.840
so sure of what you want that you
wouldn't take something better all right

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.270
so fine yeah what does that mean on top
of that how do I make that happen

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.020
interestingly enough the inside is a
negotiation tip there which two-thirds

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.380
of us are not that good good with I
don't tell that joke

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.940
Jeffrey Tobin doesn't give me the best
commercial of my company ever gotten his

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.040
company is a Black Swan group that is a
baddest-ass name I ever heard imagine if

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.970
they were in preparation and they're
talking about going on camera and Tobin

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.290
says you know Black Swan it sounds kind
of cool you know I I'm gonna say it's a

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.100
badass name Anderson Cooper everybody
else says no that's stupid don't do that

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.739
you know the proof sir gets in his ear
and says don't do that that's a dumb

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.930
idea but getting people to do something
stuff Spontini spontaneously in a

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.000
negotiation how do you do that well the
brain works up to 31 percent better in a

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.470
positive frame of mind 31% it's no small
jump you make yourself 31 percent

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.800
smarter just being in a positive frame
of mind you're 31 percent more likely to

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.220
come up with a better answer in a
positive frame of mind we have things in

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:32.910
our head called mirror neurons I smile
at somebody in the front it hits your

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.700
mirror neurons you smile back
involuntarily

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.049
what's that happen I've just triggered a
chemical change in your brain started to

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:45.930
pick up your mental processes with that
smile I tell a joke Jeffrey Tobin's

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.220
brain picks up a little bit more he's in
a better mood in a negotiation he's

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.340
willing to give me one of the best
commercials I

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.709
national TV for free how much do I
paying for that never be so sure of what

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.319
you want they wouldn't take something
better how do you make these things

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.330
happen
I'm gonna give you a couple of ideas

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.580
tiny little things 2 millimeter shifts
we're gonna have Tony Robbins here later

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.120
this afternoon I'm a big Tony Robbins
fan he talks about the 2 millimeter

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.090
ships that make all the difference in
the world would it give you some of

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:26.580
those 2 millimeter shifts so I was the
FBI's leading international kidnapping

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.620
negotiator I handled the kidnapping
negotiation strategy of every American

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.310
kidnapped overseas might ask yourself
how often is Chris Wallace busy when

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.190
he's doing that well it's a big world
there are a lot of Americans doing

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:45.990
stupid things and crazy places some of
you in this room managed to get away

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.590
with something bad so we got that way
before the earthquake in Haiti we've got

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.350
a just kidnapping is out of control but
it's dual nationals they don't know

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.200
they're grabbing Americans which comes
to be the case in many cases of

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.250
Americans being kidnapped overseas bad
guys think they got a local happens to

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.070
be a dual national one of the great
things about the United States of

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:11.640
America do you know how many countries
in the world that you're citizen of that

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.810
country if you're born in that country

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.660
like I grew up thinking that was just
natural and normal yeah I was born in of

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.190
course I'm a citizen must be that way
everywhere one other developed nation

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:30.900
Canada not one country in Europe not
Australia they think you're born in

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.260
Australia an American citizen they're
the earthÂ´s Australian see Australian

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.740
citizen they laugh at you it's a
birthright that we take for granted one

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.289
of the great things about this country
country is not perfect a lot of good

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:45.200
things about it what does that have to
do with this story Haitian moms know

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.510
there's a very best gift they could
potentially give their child on their

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.470
child's first actual birthday it's a
gift of American citizenship one way or

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.539
another Haitian moms by hook or by crook
find themselves on American soil so the

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.110
child can be born American citizenship
and all the things that that immediately

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.099
brings with it so a kidnapping business
model in Haiti at the time this is

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:09.289
before the earthquake
kidnapping is a business it's

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.110
commodities business to us it's horrible
to them it's another day at the office

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.449
understand the business at your
counterparts in how they see it how you

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:22.129
see it doesn't matter which it did
doesn't it's a business in Haiti

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:25.879
business model is it's a great business
model car checker car with more than one

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.210
person in it
keep a car in a person let the other

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.639
person go they're gonna let them know
they probably they were in a car with

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.589
them they probably know who their
families you can tell them they got

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:38.839
kidnapped I'd if they got enough money
for a car and gas money they plug onto

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:42.259
money for a ransom get it you got a car
in Haiti at the time you probably got

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:46.279
some money it's a great target for a
kidnapping what happens if you know the

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:53.979
person you grabbed was one person and
family nobody likes you still got a car

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:59.899
it's a great business model say good and
if there's a kid in there he's done

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:05.209
better families more likely to pay 12
your boy gets grabbed in carjacking and

00:07:05.209 --> 00:07:12.050
Haiti father is not an American citizen
but he knows his son is and he's told

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:17.169
that the the FBI is gonna help now I
don't know what went through his mind

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:21.529
when he was told that the FBI was gonna
help him but I could imagine that

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:26.029
probably he figured maybe about 15
minutes later he's gonna hear on a front

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:32.930
door and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones
were saying you know maybe maybe he

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:39.919
might have FBI hats on no no instead 15
minutes later he gets a call from some

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:45.909
guy in Washington DC says his name is
Chris Foster he's gonna help

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:55.340
he literally says to me on the phone
you're in Washington DC how you gonna

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:06.020
help me how long have I got four he
hangs up seriously what do you say what

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.090
do you say to this guy how do you lay
this out

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:18.620
how long before he hangs up maybe ten
everybody you deal with maybe less

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.759
intensely when they interact with you
says to themself how you gonna help me

00:08:24.759 --> 00:08:28.250
they don't they don't with less
intensity but it's the same question

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:34.640
everybody that you interact with it's
not an unfair question to ask how are

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.740
you gonna help me now I've done this
wrong before how do I know what to say

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.649
because I did it wrong before remember
the first time I was in the Philippines

00:08:42.649 --> 00:08:47.060
on a kidnapping which I'm gonna tell you
about a couple minutes I showed up the

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.560
FBI's expert which pretty much at the
time made me the expert for the United

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.810
States government and I'm walking to
room that in the Philippines everybody's

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.260
shorter everybody below the president
everybody but the president Philippines

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.410
is in a room Secretary of Defense
president's personal advisor all the

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:08.000
cabinet members who are you you know why
should we rely on you and I make the

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.980
mistake of trotting out my resume FBI
this many years train not only trained

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:19.550
to Quantico but I teach at Quantico now
I wrote the book at Quantico lay out my

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:27.709
my resume my my experience they might as
well have looked yawned in my face cuz

00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:31.100
they've never seen me before so I've
made this mistake before and you guys

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:37.990
know a resume correlates loosely with
whether or not you know how to do a job

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:44.420
if your resume shows for sure that you
could do a job you'd never lose one

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.370
they'd never be a bad hire they'd never
be an employee that didn't work out

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:55.820
correlates loosely with whether or not
you know how to do the job so do I say

00:09:55.820 --> 00:10:00.710
this father in Haiti I got maybe
somewhere between 3 and 10

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:05.620
yes well the line goes there this is
what I said

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.650
all right so Haitian kidnappers are not
killing kidnap victims these days I

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:13.280
realized it's really stupid because they
kill each other at the drop of a hat but

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.370
for whatever reason and not killing
kidnap victims now today is Thursday and

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:26.030
Haitian kidnappers love the party on
Saturday night if you say the things I

00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:29.240
want you to say and you do the things
that I asked you to do we'll have your

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:35.960
son out by late Friday early Saturday
morning he said tell me what you want me

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:46.520
to do and we had his son out Saturday
morning did I lay my resume out did I

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.850
lay a strategy out I begin to provide
value

00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:03.080
what's your value proposition what I did
was I showed him in less than 10 seconds

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:10.020
that I saw what he was looking at and I
offered the slightest amount of insight

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.490
into the dynamic and anybody that you
deal with the first question they ask

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:24.360
themselves is do you see what I see I
didn't say I understand to try to

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.960
shortcut the process it doesn't take
that much longer so delay to save time

00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:35.670
10 seconds 15 times telling them in no
uncertain terms there's no doubt in his

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:40.110
mind that I see what he sees and I have
the slightest and if I see what he sees

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:47.010
the chances are that I got answers to it
are very high he never asked me how many

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:52.950
kidnappings I worked he never asked me
how many times how many kidnappings in

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.740
Haiti I worked the qualifier questions
how long you've been in this industry

00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:00.480
what's your resume how many times you've
done this before he didn't ask me how

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.450
many kidnappings had worked in Haiti he
never asked me how many times I've been

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:09.180
to Haiti you know how many times I've
been to Haiti never been there he didn't

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.510
ask me what languages I speak do you
speak French do you speak Creole do you

00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:15.810
know you may ask yourself Chris Voss and
I was the international negotiation

00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:20.010
coach really I coached negotiations all
over the world how many languages is

00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:25.910
Chris Paul speak by now you realize the
answer that is almost one

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:34.090
and a lot of languages in there I'm
happy with complete sentences and don't

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:40.120
hold me to pronunciations but I
understand negotiations I understand -

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:44.200
oh she Asian skills here's a bad news
for what's the bad news you know it

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.990
works where people are involved won't
work any other time cuz I get asked all

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:56.350
the time I said working real estate it's
a working media to media negotiations

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:59.080
you know what stuff doesn't work it
doesn't work it doesn't work where

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:04.030
people aren't involved so I'm gonna talk
to a couple get you out of a couple of

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:11.490
bad habits real quick what's hurting you
the most in your negotiations this is

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:17.140
addicted to yes I mean you got a bad
addiction - yes you know was that kind

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:24.010
of a meeting right hi I'm addicted - yes
hi Chris here's the problem with yes

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.930
we're all taught its of gold the gold
end of the rainbow where we want to go

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:33.970
do you want to be a better negotiator
would you like to make more money would

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:45.730
you like to have more free time bigger
house buy my book boom yes is always a

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:50.200
trap it's always a trap I don't know if
this ever was a good idea maybe there

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.580
was a point in time that it was a good
idea to get people in - yes mode or mere

00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.960
agreement the theory of that if I get
you saying yes to a little yeses the

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.870
chances are that you're gonna say yes to
the big yes is much higher there's

00:14:01.870 --> 00:14:06.520
actually a study out there that says
that that works if you find out if you

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.610
hear there's a study that says something
more take a hard look at the study see

00:14:09.610 --> 00:14:14.860
if you agree with how it's done but even
better still ask yourself if you pick up

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:20.800
the phone six o'clock at night I don't
care what time it is one o'clock in the

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:24.820
afternoon and a person on the other end
of the line says would you like to make

00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:32.350
more money do you go thank God you
called I've been waiting all day long or

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.950
somebody to ask me that question
somebody calls you on the phone and says

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:45.010
have you got a few minutes to talk well
nobody immediately says yes any question

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:47.800
there are three kinds of yeses
commitment confirmation and counterfeit

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:53.020
people have gotten us try to walk us in
the commitment he has so much with

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.250
confirmation yes that the vast majority
of us are good with counterfeit yes

00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:03.790
that's all you ever hear counterfeit yes
nobody in my company or that I've

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:07.210
trained ever calls people on the phone
and says have you got a few minutes to

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:12.940
talk nobody what does that do to you
when somebody asks you that's a it's at

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:17.490
least four questions in one if I have a
few minutes do I want to talk to you I

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.680
have a few minutes I don't want to talk
to you do I want to talk about what you

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:28.380
want to talk about how long is a few
minutes how do I get off the phone

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:33.259
the problem is why all these questions
are running through your mind you're

00:15:33.259 --> 00:15:36.470
actually not listening to the other
person it's equivalent to talking to

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:40.250
someone who has another person
whispering in their ear watch out it's

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.730
coming you know there's a hook how long
it's gonna be there taking you somewhere

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:48.019
be careful be careful that person is
whispering in there all the time so the

00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:51.800
very first thing you could do is get out
of that and believe me that's gonna be

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:56.750
one of the hardest things you have to
overcome it's not complicated it's

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:01.730
really difficult to break that habit
I hope I'm getting you to the point

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:06.800
where you're worried about that so you
might be asking yourself right so now

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:17.509
what am I supposed to do well anybody
recognize this guy Jack Welch came

00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:21.470
through Los Angeles but two and a half
years ago with his wife Suzy the

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:25.100
real-life MBA I'm at a book signing I
want to ask Jack well sir coming be

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:28.459

in the MBA program how many people in
that book son you're gonna ask Jack

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:38.600
Walter to say yes or something easily
200 people come through the book signing

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:46.839
Jack want to come over to the house Jack
come come we be Godfather to my my child

00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:50.630
how many how many yeses are gonna try to
get out of them in the book that day

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:54.380
that week how many people are trying to
get Jack Walter say yes on top of

00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:57.920
everything else this is a book signing
up to 300 people walking through how

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.540
long do I have with Jack Welch they ask
you your name write on a piece of paper

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:08.689
Jack looks ups Chris when I stay keep
going they don't want me there for

00:17:08.689 --> 00:17:11.900
logistics reasons they don't want me
bothering him on top of that Jack

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:16.309
Walters his celebrity he's legitimate
celebrities got a security detail I'm

00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:20.030
gonna be within arm's length of Jack
what so what am I gonna do to him and

00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:26.299
you know I I could kiss him they don't
know what I'm gonna do right how much do

00:17:26.299 --> 00:17:30.830
I have less time with Jack Wilson I had
with the Haitian father so I walked

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:35.360
knowing this hostage negotiator I know
how the brain works emotionally I woke

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.100
up to Jack Walton I say is it a
ridiculous idea

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:45.380
for you to come and speak to the
negotiation course I teach at USC and he

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:50.030
looks up and to the left of his face
just freezes just gets this really

00:17:50.030 --> 00:18:01.610
intense look on his face and I think to
myself I just killed Jack Walsh I mean I

00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:05.240
got scared
first I figured he's gonna fall he had a

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:08.300
stroke he's gonna fall over the
Securities gonna tackle me they could

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:13.600
drag me on handcuffs I'm gonna say but
I'm an FBI agent

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.580
so initially when he doesn't die I'm
relieved but now I figure he's gonna

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:25.880
start he's still security security he
doesn't do that either he looks back you

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.840
mean he says it's my personal assistants
name this is a Twitter account that we

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:35.150
have set up her I will call her and tell
her who you are what you're gonna be

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:39.290
reaching out to her about I think we're
gonna be in Los Angeles in fall if we

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:42.520
are we'll come in and speak to you class

00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.420
what I get him to say instead of trying
to get it you'd be shocked at what

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:54.950
people are willing to say no to as
insane as it is all the problems of

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:59.060
trying to get somebody to say yes the
complete opposite happens when they say

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:04.490
no people feel protected they feel safe
their brain clears up you'd be shocked

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:09.890
at what people are willing to say no to
I coach some of my students and some of

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:15.320
my clients that are in job negotiations
to say to their bosses do you want me to

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:22.430
fail you'd be shocked shocked shocked at
what people will comfortably say no to

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:30.700
we do it all the time when you get home
Google Ronald Reagan are you better off

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:35.540
Ronald Reagan Presidential first time he
was elected president when he beat Jimmy

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.800
Carter their last presidential debate he
stood up in front of the American public

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:44.030
and said next Tuesday you go to the
voting booth next Tuesday you have a

00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:47.390
decision to make which by the way is
exactly what I did when I was laying

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:50.450
things out to the Haitian kid now
this is what you see this is what you're

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.410
gonna look at this is what you're faced
with Megan is smart enough to just lay

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:57.650
this out he knows he's getting your
attention by telling you what you're

00:19:57.650 --> 00:20:01.370
gonna look at he says I just ask you
this question are you better off than

00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:05.840
you were four years ago have you got
more spending power than you had four

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.210
years ago is America in better shape
that was four years ago succession of no

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:16.460
questions no no no no no says if the
answer to any of these questions are yes

00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:22.490
and then your your choice is clear but
if it's no well I'd ask you to vote for

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:30.710
me no no no no no make a deal you got
elected give you one other subtle

00:20:30.710 --> 00:20:37.280
insight what if knows not enough what do
you do next here's what you want really

00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:44.600
want people to say this is the game
changer it doesn't seem wonderful you

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.700
see that's right and you don't feel the
heavens apart and the birds chirp and a

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:54.410
choir sing but when other people say
that's right you'd be stunned at the

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:59.150
transformation that they go through the
last presidential election whether

00:20:59.150 --> 00:21:03.140
you're a Republican or Democrat when you
watched the presidential debates in

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:07.250
either candidate that you supported said
something that you believed in you you

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.690
said that's right that's what you say
when the other person have said

00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:16.370
something that you completely buy into
there's an actual chemical change that

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:21.400
happens it's a combination of an
establishment of empathy and epiphany

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:28.190
simultaneously and suddenly you feel you
so so much more connected to the person

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:32.750
that got you to say that's right now I
need to point out very clearly that this

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:38.450
is not your right your right is the
worst form of false agreement that there

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:43.880
is it's probably costs people and
companies more money across the board

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:52.130
and cause people to accuse each other of
being liars when one of your colleagues

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:56.030
at your job when anybody in your life is
after you about something and they won't

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.570
let up and you want to maintain the
relationship but you just want to shut

00:21:59.570 --> 00:22:04.620
up
what do you say to you look him in the

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:16.470
eye and go you're right they go yeah and
they go away and they come back the next

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:20.190
day and go whoa wait a minute we talked
yesterday I laid out my case I told you

00:22:20.190 --> 00:22:24.840
everything I was talking about and you
look at them again you go again you're

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:31.080
right okay they leave again
nobody would ever do that to you would

00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:37.830
they so the two millimeter shifts from
getting the other person to say you're

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:42.570
right there that's right does it work on
social passes are working kidnappings

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:46.500
this American got grabbed overseas he's
being held by our friend up here on the

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.430
right hand side and this is a bad to the
bone sociopathic rape and murder and

00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:57.570
killer named subbaiah so bite is as bad
as they come it's no coincidence that

00:22:57.570 --> 00:23:01.260
he's got on sunglasses a black bandana
black t-shirt he always dressed up like

00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:03.840
this because terrorists like the media
that's why you're in a terrorism

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:09.540
business you want attention it's a cry
for help he always made sure he got

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:13.680
himself photographed but like this
American is wandered into the wrong

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:17.070
place to the wrong times being held and
there's a ten million dollar demand for

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:24.060
his release this is guy I'm coaching a
great human being one of the few people

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.890
on a planet I would literally trust with
the life of my son and in the

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.700
Philippines this is no small amount of
trust

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:35.550
he actually recently at the time he was
a colonel he recently retired from the

00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.250
Philippines he was the number three
general on Philippine National Police a

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:44.190
legitimate hero and a bad-to-the-bone
himself guy because he was the leader of

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:48.420
the special action force which was
Philippine National Police version of

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:54.390
the Navy SEALs when I met this man he
had personally led 30 rescue operations

00:23:54.390 --> 00:24:01.320
for kidnapping victims that year it was
only August give you an idea how often

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:06.870
they're out the door and he and his guys
didn't take handcuffs so that means 30

00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:13.080
firefights we get into the midst of the
negotiation with our terrorists

00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.370
still made it for four months and I tell
my guy you know what we're gonna do

00:24:17.370 --> 00:24:20.010
today we're gonna get it that's right
out of the other side that's right out

00:24:20.010 --> 00:24:23.490
of a sociopath that's right out of a
killer because if they're not coming

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:27.470
down by one penny on the ten million
dollar ransom

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:31.409
so we coach them up we get the
terrorists on the phone and my guy

00:24:31.409 --> 00:24:36.779
repeats chapter and verse all the other
sides of nonsense you know how asking

00:24:36.779 --> 00:24:41.309
for ransom you're asking for war damages
you're asking for ten million dollars of

00:24:41.309 --> 00:24:46.799
economic harm it's happened in this
Philippines for the last 500 years from

00:24:46.799 --> 00:24:49.890
the Spanish to the Japanese to the
Americans in atrocities under blackjack

00:24:49.890 --> 00:24:54.480
Pershing now I realize that this doesn't
apply to you because you would never be

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.210
in a discussion with somebody where they
brought up stuff that had nothing to do

00:24:57.210 --> 00:25:02.669
with the situation would you nobody
would ever bring up something that

00:25:02.669 --> 00:25:06.120
happened in the past that had been
resolved for years and bring it back up

00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:13.649
again that never happens to you
so we summarized all the nonsense that

00:25:13.649 --> 00:25:19.860
this terrorist had been spouting the
sociopaths have been spouting my guy got

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:27.240
done there was a moment of silence and a
terrorist said that's right another

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:33.149
moment of silence and my guy says talk
again in a couple of days we went from

00:25:33.149 --> 00:25:40.649
ten million dollars to zero in that
moment it went away they never brought

00:25:40.649 --> 00:25:45.600
up money again a couple of months later
the American walks away we fly them out

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:53.010
of the Philippines the terrorists got
nothing zero I'm back in the Philippines

00:25:53.010 --> 00:25:57.179
three weeks later on another case I
connect up with my guy he says you're

00:25:57.179 --> 00:26:01.559
not gonna believe who called me on the
phone I don't know who called you on the

00:26:01.559 --> 00:26:04.440
phone
our terrorists still knew him by his

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.070
undercover name had the undercover
number calls him on phone and literally

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:20.169
says have you been promoted yet
I don't know what you said to me on the

00:26:20.169 --> 00:26:24.630
phone but whatever was I was gonna kill
the American you stop me from doing your

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:31.289
really good they should promote you
hangs up the phone

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:38.870
what's he saying he's saying I deal with
you again at the end of a negotiation

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:43.670
where he got nothing
he called his counterpart up on the

00:26:43.670 --> 00:26:50.870
phone to pay his respects everybody that
you deal with regardless of how much

00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:57.530
they get out of it should be willing to
say to you after the negotiation yeah

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:03.050
I'd talk to you again
I feel respected by you that's the way

00:27:03.050 --> 00:27:07.490
you should leave everybody that's what
builds a long term career that's what

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:14.330
builds success in your negotiations and
that approach the tactical approach of

00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:17.240
empathy and getting that's right side of
people give you the opportunity because

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.140
we made mistakes people used to say to
me you know what's it like when the

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:25.130
slightest mistake and somebody get
killed said it wasn't a slut we're gonna

00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:30.020
make mistakes
I took an approach overall that gave me

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.490
latitude because I knew occasionally I
would make mistakes I do my preparation

00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:38.750
I'd get into a negotiation I do and I do
and I'd say something wrong but take an

00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:43.970
approach based on this genuinely trying
to understand the other side for

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:48.440
sociopathic reasons not for missionary
reasons but for mercenary reasons

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.860
because of how much latitude it gives
you in the negotiation understand you're

00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.180
not going to be perfect don't try to be
perfect

00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:01.910
so in closing allow me to leave you with
this problems how to overcome problems

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.160
even matter how regardless of your
preparation

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.980
a proof of life video that's what
they're called the ultimate good news

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:16.309
bad news story if you're ever
unfortunate enough to see one today hot

00:28:16.309 --> 00:28:19.940
today's high stakes rescue mission in
Columbia ended a drama that has been

00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.140
dragging on for years Kris Voss is the
former FBI lead the International

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:27.820
kidnapping negotiator he worked on them

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:33.100
so in terms of preparation what have I
done wrong here

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:42.929
my hair sticking out now this is the
first time I was on CNN Anderson Cooper

00:28:42.929 --> 00:28:46.260
like I'm enthusiastic about being here I
mean I think this is cool

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:49.530
I'm a small-town boy from Iowa son of
Richard and Joyce have lost time to

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:54.870
7,000 people Anderson Cooper a million
people gonna watch this you go in there

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:58.890
you go through makeup makeup then you
put you in a room that's a big dark

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:02.640
closet light shines right in your eyes I
say look right below the light down to

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:06.150
the left is a monitor I say do you want
it's gonna go live when we go live do

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.090
you want it off Iran I go I leave that
baby on

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:15.840
I never seen me on TV before I want to
see me on TV so we have just gone live

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.720
and I'm looking down as you can see I'm
looking down at the monitor and I've

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:26.460
realized my hair sticking out the
additional problem is the monitors a

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:31.190
mirror image so I don't know what's out
of my head they're sticking up

00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.190
this is my first issue I got a I'm a
negotiator I gotta figure stuff out I

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:38.460
got I got a workout option so I have to
identify which side of my head the hair

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:43.549
is this case from the beginning until
retirement of last year

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:53.630
I know why I thought move my head around
you're gonna make my hair like shake or

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:56.720
something and I'd be able to tell but
you see from look at my face I'm like

00:29:56.720 --> 00:30:01.280
now it didn't work I feel the one where
it is so I gotta decide what to do how

00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.730
much time do I got my mom's probably
watching this back in Iowa all these

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:08.450
friends from a Bible study class are
watching this you know you can't teach

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:12.740
you son how to comb his hair so I'm
sitting there trying to decide you know

00:30:12.740 --> 00:30:17.540
and tonight how can I handle it you know
and I realized what can't I do I can't

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:23.140
lick my hand and do that some senators
on each side

00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:32.299
why don't they gonna make me look worse
I know the Bruce is going like Hanson's

00:30:32.299 --> 00:30:36.520
hairs perfect let's go side by side
somebody can see this thing but is no

00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.380
Anderson Cooper mr. perfect hair on a
planet

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.500
let's make him look bad it's like being
the before it was a fat guy in the

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:46.970
before-and-after right so I'm sitting
there I'm trying to decide what to do

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:51.200
when can I make my move how many moves
can I make what can I do you know work

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:56.470
up the courage closely involved in this
finally

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:24.200
I'm kind of disgusted right now but it
went on to finish the interview and they

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:31.730
did ask me back so what I'm here to tell
you is you'll make mistakes and they

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:35.870
won't be the end of everything and let
yourself make mistakes it's gonna be

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:39.560
okay have a good steady process where
you treat people with respect and

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:43.220
appreciation you use empathy in a
positive way not because you're a nice

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:52.430
guy you are but because it works got a
free newsletter texts to sign up FBI

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.680
empathy all one word don't let it
spellcheck it take it out of it

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.580
so in closing and this is only if you
want it's for free only if you want then

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.850
we bother with it if you don't want
remember remember I mentioned Will Smith

00:32:04.850 --> 00:32:09.380
and Tommy Lee Jones at the beginning men
in black well they actually worked for

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:18.200
me I like everybody stand up please
stand up but it stand up remember the

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.550
little red flashy thing all right got
one right here

00:32:23.550 --> 00:32:33.750
we look up here watch very closely all
right after today you'll take an

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:38.150
approach with people what's not a
problem to treat them with respect

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:42.480
you're gonna make people feel good about
dealing with you so that no matter what

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:48.300
the outcome is they'll let you know that
after they dealt with you they're

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.350
willing to continue to deal with you on
other projects because they felt

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:56.130
respected they felt appreciation and
they felt some kind of way they don't

00:32:56.130 --> 00:33:00.210
know what it was but they felt like a
bond with you so move through the rest

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:04.559
of your careers by that with that and
you'll be very happy where it takes you

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:09.320
