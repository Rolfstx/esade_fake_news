The border, the boundary
that is incredibly tough

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:09.175
to smuggle a monkey across...
I am told.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:15.981
President Trump has famously
made securing the border

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:17.884
a key priority
for his administration,

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:19.785
most notably
through his border wall,

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:21.787
something which, as we've
pointed out before,

00:00:21.887 --> 00:00:25.057
he himself inadvertently found
a flaw in on the campaign trail.

-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a rope.

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.072
And I know that sounds stupid,
but to be fair,

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.406
you haven't heard Phase Six

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:42.308
of Donald Trump's
border security plan,

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:44.510
"Go get me all the ropes."

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:49.048
And while that wall idea
has received a lot of coverage,

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.284
it is by no means
Trump's only border plan.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:53.653
One of his more benign-sounding,
but potentially

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:56.856
no less dangerous, ideas
concerns the Border Patrol.

00:00:57.056 --> 00:00:59.191
And first, let's be clear
about who they are.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.627
They are part of Customs
and Border Protection.

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:04.430
They are not ICE, who you may
know from immigration raids.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.231
They're also
not customs officers,

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.734
who you'll see at airports
and border crossings,

00:01:08.834 --> 00:01:11.971
nor are they the Borders Patrol,
a group of vigilantes

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:14.874
who defend abandoned Borders
bookstores from raccoons.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:18.778
No, the Border Patrol
are the people in green uniforms

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.447
who literally patrol
the boundaries of our country.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:23.949
There are around 20,000 of them.

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:25.752
But Trump,
in an executive order,

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:28.288
has called for them to add
five thousand more,

00:01:28.388 --> 00:01:30.056
to tackle the many problems
that he sees

00:01:30.156 --> 00:01:31.490
on our southern border.

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.514
Now, that right there,
is what happens

00:01:54.614 --> 00:01:56.882
when Donald Trump starts
a sentence feeling xenophobic

00:01:56.982 --> 00:01:59.018
-and ends it feeling hungry.

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:10.029
But-- but for the record,
Border Patrol agents

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:13.699
do a lot more than just fight
drugs, crime and gravy.

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:17.303
In recent years, the number
of Mexicans apprehended
crossing the border

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:19.838
has dramatically dropped
and has now been surpassed

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.375
by the sharp rise in migrants
fleeing violence

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:26.746
in Central America, for whom
there is a legal process
to seek asylum here.

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.648
Meaning that agents' days

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.950
can frequently include
moments like this.

what people expect

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:56.208

00:02:59.311 --> 00:03:00.780

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.516
that middle section
is pretty much just Linus.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.036
But-- but the truth is,
it is moments like that there,

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:27.573
that show how difficult the job
of a Border Patrol agent can be,

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:29.542
because in that moment,
they are delivering aid

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.977
and processing migrants,
but later, that same day,

00:03:32.077 --> 00:03:33.846
they may be chasing down
drug traffickers.

00:03:33.946 --> 00:03:36.382
So, it's a mixture
between humanitarian work

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:39.285
and law enforcement,
and not everyone can do it.

00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:41.254
And that is what makes
Trump's plan

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:44.356
to expand the Border Patrol
by 25 percent so concerning,

00:03:44.457 --> 00:03:47.626
because if you hire agents
quickly and badly,

00:03:47.726 --> 00:03:50.096
it can actually leave us
much less safe

00:03:50.396 --> 00:03:52.065
and have
devastating consequences.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:56.402
And the reason we know this
is because we have been
down this road before.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.571
So, tonight, I would like
to talk to you

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.806
about the last Border Patrol
hiring surge,

00:04:00.906 --> 00:04:02.575
because it wasn't that long ago.

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:14.019

<i> from 10,000 agents to 20,000.</i>

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:20.426
It's true. The late 2000s saw
a surge in Border Patrol agents

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.161
that was matched only
by the surge in the number

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.997

making cakes.

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:27.433

Now-- now, to meet the surge's
ambitious targets,

recruitment was aggressive,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:18.196
yes, you did commit a crime,
or at the very least,

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:20.599
you really fucked up a souffl√©.

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:23.436
I mean, you fucked
that thing up bad.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:27.606
And the problems didn't stop
once the new agents were hired,

00:08:27.706 --> 00:08:30.810
because the training was also
significantly cut back,

00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:33.612
and that caused real issues,
as one trainer revealed,

00:08:33.712 --> 00:08:34.880
while, for some reason,

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.316
being disguised
as an asthmatic scarecrow.

00:08:37.983 --> 00:08:39.651

00:08:42.354 --> 00:08:44.423
<i>because of fears of retaliation.</i>

00:08:44.523 --> 00:08:47.359
AGENT:

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:48.994
So, the standards were lowered?

00:08:49.094 --> 00:08:51.230
AGENT:

00:08:52.732 --> 00:08:55.734
-What is happening there?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:08:55.834 --> 00:08:59.237
He sounds like Jesse Ventura
after swallowing one of those

00:08:59.338 --> 00:09:01.474
novelty cow-voice noise makers.

00:09:01.574 --> 00:09:04.777
And look, I know that it is
really hard to pay attention

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.612
to what Robot Neil Young
is saying there,

00:09:07.045 --> 00:09:09.114
but it is genuinely
worth listening

00:09:09.214 --> 00:09:10.750
to where they cut corners.

00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:13.919
REPORTER:<i> The source told us
 Spanish-language classes</i>

00:09:14.019 --> 00:09:15.921
<i> and physical training
 were cut back.</i>

00:09:16.021 --> 00:09:17.623
AGENT:

00:09:24.697 --> 00:09:27.299
They cut back on Spanish
and physical training,

00:09:27.399 --> 00:09:29.535
so the new standards affected
agents' ability

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:31.270
to talk to the people
they caught

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:34.773
and their ability
to catch the people
they wanted to talk to.

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:38.110
Which seem like pretty essential
facets of their job.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.247
It's like if the training
program at SeaWorld left out

00:09:41.347 --> 00:09:43.915
putting on a wetsuit
and systematically driving

00:09:44.015 --> 00:09:45.718
carnivorous whales insane.

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:47.620
That's the whole job there!

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.289
Take them away, you're left
with nothing else!

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.091
And consequently,
as the ranks grew,

00:09:53.191 --> 00:09:55.327
corruption and excessive force
sky-rocketed

00:09:55.794 --> 00:09:57.763
and misconduct became
such a problem

00:09:57.863 --> 00:10:00.699
that, at one point,
the Border Patrol felt it needed

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:02.868
to issue a memo about the fact
their agents

00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:06.271
"were averaging two alcohol-
related arrests per week,"

00:10:06.371 --> 00:10:08.908
and some agents off-duty
run-ins with the law

00:10:09.008 --> 00:10:10.475
were even more spectacular.

(CHUCKLING) Wow!

00:10:26.458 --> 00:10:29.395
Now, I should tell you,
one agent was found guilty

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:30.796
of assaulting the woman
who complained,

00:10:30.896 --> 00:10:33.165
but both denied that anything
sexual was happening,

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:35.634
and they were found not guilty
of the sex act,

00:10:35.734 --> 00:10:39.105
presumably because they were
at Cirque du Soleil,

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.573
where everything looks
like a sex act.

That is a bird person sex act.

what's happening there,

And things got-- things got
more serious than that.

00:11:03.562 --> 00:11:07.532
Since 2005, 77 agents
were arrested or indicted

00:11:07.632 --> 00:11:09.301
for corruption, and if you think
about it,

00:11:09.401 --> 00:11:11.736
Border Patrol agents
are particularly attractive

00:11:11.836 --> 00:11:13.038
to drug-traffickers.

00:11:13.138 --> 00:11:15.374
Remember, they often work
on their own,

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:16.409
patrolling the border,

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.143
which, as one journalist
points out,

00:11:18.443 --> 00:11:20.345
is a pretty potent recipe

where someone saying
"a ton of drugs"

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:43.235
actually means a literal ton
of drugs.

00:11:43.468 --> 00:11:46.304
No, Kevin, you did not do
"a ton of drugs,"

00:11:46.538 --> 00:11:48.941
you took a Benadryl,
you made out with a goldfish,

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:51.343

just a taste of the kind

of spectacular corruption
involved.

00:11:59.151 --> 00:12:01.587
Take Agent Joel Luna,
who, it turned out,

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:04.923
had a brother in the Gulf Cartel
and who was convicted

00:12:05.023 --> 00:12:06.425
of engaging in organized crime

00:12:06.525 --> 00:12:08.360

<i> it says "Gulf Cartel" on it.

00:12:30.282 --> 00:12:33.118
It's hard to explain
why your Border Patrol badge

00:12:33.218 --> 00:12:37.022
is in a safe with cocaine,
money and a cartel pistol.

00:12:37.122 --> 00:12:38.022
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Yeah.

00:12:38.123 --> 00:12:39.658
That is really hard to explain.

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:41.727
I mean, the best I can do
is, uh,

00:12:41.827 --> 00:12:43.829
"My badge had a drug problem
that it couldn't bear

00:12:43.929 --> 00:12:46.765
to tell me about, so finally,
it decided to shoot itself

00:12:46.865 --> 00:12:48.099
with a gun that we found
on a case,

00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:49.901
planning to die surrounded
by its money

00:12:50.002 --> 00:12:52.304
because its views on death
resemble those
of Ancient Egyptians."

00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:55.708
But even then, we are talking
about a sentient police badge

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:58.376
with an interest in Egyptology,
so you're already banking

00:12:58.476 --> 00:13:01.313
on a pretty large suspension
of disbelief there.

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:03.548
Oh, and you should know,

00:13:03.648 --> 00:13:06.585
Luna was hired during the last
recruitment surge.

00:13:06.885 --> 00:13:09.021
And CBP will tell you
what they told us,

00:13:09.121 --> 00:13:11.990
that while some agents did
disgrace the badge
with corruption,

00:13:12.090 --> 00:13:13.758
the vast majority did not.

00:13:13.859 --> 00:13:15.861
Although, it is worth knowing
that Tomsheck,

00:13:16.194 --> 00:13:17.429
the Internal Affairs guy,

00:13:17.529 --> 00:13:20.132
believes the problem
is much bigger than they imply.

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.802
Mr. Luna is not one bad apple.

<i> He is part of

<i> that exceeded that of

00:13:31.844 --> 00:13:33.779
Okay, so it's less
"one bad apple,"

00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:37.415
than, "Oh, my God.
That is a lot of bad apples."

00:13:37.615 --> 00:13:39.551
Which, by the way, should really
be the marketing theme

00:13:39.651 --> 00:13:41.220
for red delicious apples.

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.721
"Red delicious apples...

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:44.923
Well, at least we got
the 'red' part right!"

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:13:46.158 --> 00:13:47.526
And it gets even worse.

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:49.794
Because remember,
these agents have guns.

00:13:49.894 --> 00:13:52.130
And some have made
very bad decisions.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.033

is, "Could a 16-year-old boy

at least a 20-foot cliff?

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:25.964 line:0%
And on the other side
of that fence?"

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:29.301
I mean, yeah.
That does seem pretty unlikely.

00:14:29.401 --> 00:14:31.236
And to explain why,
tune in next week

00:14:31.336 --> 00:14:33.272
when our main story will be
"Gravity...

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:36.007

00:14:36.107 --> 00:14:38.209
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, so you know,

00:14:38.309 --> 00:14:39.644
that case is still
in the courts.

00:14:39.744 --> 00:14:42.614
And agents can sometimes feel
threatened by rock throwers,

00:14:42.714 --> 00:14:46.018
but it is worth pointing out
that a report which looked at
25 cases

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:48.954
where Border Patrol agents
shot people who'd thrown rocks,

00:14:49.287 --> 00:14:52.358
concluded that "too many cases
do not appear to meet

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:54.159
the test
of objective reasonableness

00:14:54.426 --> 00:14:56.428
with regard to the use
of deadly force."

00:14:56.528 --> 00:14:59.531
Which I believe is kind of
law enforcement legalese for

00:14:59.731 --> 00:15:04.402
"Holy shit! You shot some people
you should not have
fucking shot at.

00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:07.472
-Maybe don't do that as much."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:15:07.572 --> 00:15:10.175
Oh, and there is one more thing
about the agent

00:15:10.275 --> 00:15:13.178
in that fence shooting...
that will not surprise you.

00:15:13.678 --> 00:15:17.515 line:0%
<i> He was one of those persons

00:15:17.916 --> 00:15:20.185 line:0%
<i> -during the surge.</i>
-Of course he was.

00:15:20.552 --> 00:15:22.887
And yet, despite all of these
warning signs,

00:15:22.988 --> 00:15:25.324
we are about to embark
upon another ambitious

00:15:25.424 --> 00:15:26.658
Border Patrol hiring surge.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.793
And CBP will tell you
not to worry about that,

00:15:28.893 --> 00:15:31.797
that in recent years
they've improved hiring
and made reforms.

00:15:31.897 --> 00:15:34.166
For instance, they've slightly
increased transparency

00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:36.101
and given agents more
non-lethal weapons

00:15:36.201 --> 00:15:37.336
like pepper spray guns,

00:15:37.436 --> 00:15:40.004
as well as rewriting
the use of force rulebook to,

00:15:40.105 --> 00:15:42.874
and I quote, "prohibit
the shooting of suspects

00:15:43.241 --> 00:15:47.346
fleeing the scene who do not
pose a threat to themselves
or others."

00:15:47.446 --> 00:15:48.880
And look, that is great,

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:51.416
although it does seem
to be one of those rules

00:15:51.516 --> 00:15:53.718

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:02.394

00:16:05.697 --> 00:16:09.701
But the problem is,
many other reforms
have not been made,

00:16:09.801 --> 00:16:11.536
and it is hard to believe
that they will be

00:16:11.636 --> 00:16:14.339
now that President
Gravy Drugs is in charge.

00:16:14.907 --> 00:16:16.808
In fact, worryingly,
there has already been talk

00:16:16.908 --> 00:16:18.643
that hiring standards
might drop again

00:16:18.743 --> 00:16:20.779
with suggestions like
a shorter polygraph,

00:16:20.879 --> 00:16:23.515
or removing parts of
the entrance exam.

00:16:23.615 --> 00:16:28.086
And most frustratingly of all,
there may be no reason for us
to take this risk,

00:16:28.186 --> 00:16:31.390
because a report from
the Inspector General
For Homeland Security

00:16:31.657 --> 00:16:35.861
questions whether we even need
5,000 more Border Patrol agents.

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:38.463
And yet, Trump seems determined
to do this anyway.

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:39.698
Who knows why?

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:43.168
There is a fairly good chance
he only said 5,000

00:16:43.268 --> 00:16:46.738
because someone told him
five bazillion is not
a real number.

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:16:47.939 --> 00:16:49.741
And look,
whatever your feelings...

00:16:49.841 --> 00:16:52.711
about the laws the Border Patrol
have been given to enforce,

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:54.813
and I have plenty
of feelings on that,

00:16:54.913 --> 00:16:57.415
you do want the best possible
people enforcing them,

00:16:57.515 --> 00:16:59.718
because if you don't,
as we have seen,

00:16:59.951 --> 00:17:01.319
bad things happen.

00:17:01.419 --> 00:17:03.922
This is a story about the danger

00:17:04.022 --> 00:17:05.757
of not learning from
your mistakes.

00:17:05.857 --> 00:17:07.860
And for the sake of
absolutely everybody,

of the border,

just trying to do
a difficult job well,

00:17:14.332 --> 00:17:16.701
if we are going to hire
all these new people,

00:17:16.801 --> 00:17:19.938
the very least we can do is be
more careful this time around.

00:17:20.038 --> 00:17:23.074
And one tiny step would be
to have recruitment ads

00:17:23.174 --> 00:17:26.211

what the job is really like.
