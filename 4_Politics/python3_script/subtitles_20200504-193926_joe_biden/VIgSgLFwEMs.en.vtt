[APPLAUSE] [LAUGHTER] THANK YOU, DON'T STAND, THAT  WOULDN'T BE

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.999
RIGHT. GOOD EVENING, THANK YOU, MR. PRESIDENT, MRS. OBAMA,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.999
DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE PRESS AND BON JOVI. [LAUGHTER]

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.999
YES, IT IS AN HONOR TO SHARE THE STAGE WITH THE PRESIDENT. WHEN

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.999
YOU THINK ABOUT IT, HE AND I ARE A LOT ALIKE. WE BOTH WENT TO

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.999
HARVARD, WE BOTH HAVE TWO CHILDREN AND WE BOTH OLD -- TOLD JOE

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.999
BIDEN WE DID NOT HAVE EXTRA TICKETS FOR  TONIGHT EVENT.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.999
[LAUGHTER] WE ALSO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE IN COMMON, I TOO

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.999
RECENTLY GOT IN TROUBLE FOR TALKING ABOUT A PUBLIC OFFICIAL'S

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.999
GOOD LOOKS. IT WAS WHEN I WOULD NOT SHUT UP  ABOUT THAT STONE

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.999
COLD FOX, SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION RAY LAHOOD. OH, MAN. I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.999
LIKE THE CUT OF HIS JIB. [LAUGHTER] PRESIDENT OBAMA, YOU HAD

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.999
SOME GREAT JOKES. IT WAS A PLEASURE WATCHING YOU STAND HERE AND

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.999
DO WHAT I DO. NOW IT IS ONLY FAIR THAT I GET TO DO WHAT YOU DO.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.999
THAT IS RIGHT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, FOR THE NEXT 15 MINUTES I

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.999
WILL BE MIRED IN A DYSFUNCTIONAL STANDOFF WITH CONGRESS. THIS

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.999
IS GOING TO BE FUN. [LAUGHTER] I WOULD LIKE TO FORMALLY

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.999
CONGRATULATE THE PRESIDENT ON HIS REELECTION. CONGRATULATIONS.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.999
[APPLAUSE] AS YOU ALL KNOW, HE IS HARD AT WORK READING JOBS.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.999
SINCE HE WAS FIRST SELECTED, THE NUMBER OF POPES HAS DOUBLED.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.999
[LAUGHTER] AND THE NUMBER OF TONIGHT SHOW HOSTS HAS TRIPLED.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.999
CONGRATULATIONS. [LAUGHTER] WHILE I'M AT IT, I WOULD LIKE TO

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.999
CONGRATULATE PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH ON BIG DEDICATION OF HIS

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.999
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY. YES, THE LIBRARY HAS MILLIONS OF BOOKS,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:12.999
ARTICLES, AND DOCUMENTS AND IF YOU GO, YOU CAN BE THE FIRST TO

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.999
READ THEM. [LAUGHTER] YOU CAN'T HURT ME. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.999
LET'S GET GOING. RIGHT HERE AT THE START I AM GOING TO SHARE

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.999
SOMETHING WITH YOU PEOPLE AND IT DOES NOT LEAVE THIS ROOM. I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.999
SAY THIS WITH ABSOLUTE CONFIDENCE, BECAUSE WE ARE ON C- SPAN.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.999
[LAUGHTER] WHO DOESN'T LOVE C-SPAN, SERIOUSLY? C-SPAN.  AN

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.999
ENTIRE CHANNEL SHOT THE BACKUP CAMERA ON A FORD EXPLORER.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.999
CONGRATULATIONS TO C-SPAN FOR WINNING THE BID TO BROADCAST THIS

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.999
EVENT. THEY BEAT OUT HD TV TWO, TVC SOUTH AMERICA AND THE

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.999
HILTON HOTEL HOW TO CHECK OUT CHANNEL. [LAUGHTER] THAT IS

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.999
RIGHT, THE HILTON. IT IS GREAT TO BE HERE AT THE HILTON. IS IT

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.999
JUST ME OR IS IT TIME TO STOP USING PRICELINE TO BOOK THIS

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.999
EVENT CAP.? I LOVE THE HILTON. I LOVE THEIR MOTTO, SORRY THE

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.999
RADISSON WAS BOOKED. I WAS WORRIED THAT BECAUSE OF THE

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.999
SEQUESTER WE WOULD BE FORCED TO HOLD THIS EVENT AT A LESS

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.999
PRESTIGIOUS HOTEL THEN THE DC HILTON. THEN I WAS TOLD THAT WAS

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.999
NOT POSSIBLE. [LAUGHTER] I DO WANT TO THANK THE HILTON FOR

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.999
ACCOMMODATING US. THEY WERE KIND ENOUGH TO RESCHEDULE A CASH

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.999
FOR GOLD SEMINAR. [LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, FOR THOSE OF YOU  HERE

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.999
FOR THE CASH FOR GOLD SEMINAR, THAT HAS BEEN MOVED TO SALON BE

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.999

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.999
TICKETS FOR THAT, EITHER. QUICK ANNOUNCEMENT, BEFORE WE REALLY

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.999
GET GOING, BEFORE WE CONTINUE, IF ANY OF YOU ARE LIVE TWEETING

00:03:51.000 --> 00:04:01.999
THIS EVENT, PLEASE USE THE #INCAPABLE OFLIVINGINTHEMOMENT.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.999
[LAUGHTER] YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. ALSO, TO ANY U.S. SENATORS HERE

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.999
TONIGHT, IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SWITCH YOUR DESSERT OR YOUR

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.999
POSITION ON GAY MARRIAGE, PLEASE SIGNAL A WAITER. [LAUGHTER]

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:20.999
SPEAKING OF DINNER, TONIGHT ENTREES OR HOW ABOUT AND FILET

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.999
MIGNON -- HALIBUT, AND FILET MIGNON. OR AS CNN REPORTED,

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.999
LASAGNA AND COUSCOUS. [LAUGHTER] THERE IS A GAVEL HERE, AND I

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.999
DON'T KNOW WHY. [GAVEL POUNDS] HERE IS A FUN FACT ABOUT

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.999
TONIGHT'S FOOD, EVERYTHING YOU IT WAS PERSONALLY SHOCKED BY

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.999
WAYNE LAPIERRE. -- SHOT BY WAYNE MOTT THE AIR. DON'T WORRY IT

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.999
WAS DURING A HOME INVASION. THE FISH CAME IN THROUGH THE

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.999
WINDOW. IT WASN'T PEPPERCORN, IT WAS BUCKSHOT. INCIDENTALLY,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.999
YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS, BUT WAYNE LAPIERRE IS MERELY THE

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.999
EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE NRA. WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION,

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.999
HOW FREAKING CRAZY DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO BE THE ACTUAL PRESIDENT

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.999
OF THE NRA? [LAUGHTER] [APPLAUSE] HE IS NOT EVEN AT THE TOP.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.999
[LAUGHTER] I WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT EARLIER THIS

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.999
EVENING THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION WITH THE SEATING CHART. FOR A

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.999
MOMENT, SOMEONE ACCIDENTALLY SAT GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE WITH

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.999
THE REPUBLICANS. THAT WAS AWKWARD, AND I APOLOGIZE. VERY

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.999
AWKWARD. SPEAKING OF TABLES, BEFORE DINNER, I HAD A CHANCE TO

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.999
MINGLE, YOU PROBABLY SAW ME. I WORKED THE CROWD, SHOOK SOME

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.999
HANDS AND SOLD MY TWITTER ACCOUNT TO AL JAZEERA FOR $500

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.999
MILLION. THEY WILL BUY ANYTHING. IT IS AN ABSOLUTE JOY TO BE

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.999
HER AT THE WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENTS DINNER. LAST YEAR, TOM

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.999
BROKAW CRITICIZED THIS EVENT FOR HAVING TOO MANY SUPERSTARS AND

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.999
A-LIST CELEBRITIES. WHEN I TOLD HIM I WOULD BE ATTENDING THIS

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.999
YEAR, HE SAID, THAT IS MORE LIKE IT. [LAUGHTER] THAT SHOULD NOT

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.999
BE FUNNY TO YOU. BUT THIS IS REALLY A STAR-  STUDDED EVENT.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.999
THIS YEAR, YOU HAVE TAKEN IT TO NEW HEIGHTS. I HAVE TO

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.999
CONGRATULATE YOU. IT'S. YOU HAVE SOME OF THE GUY FROM DUCT

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.999
MINUS TO HEAR. --- DUCK DYNASTY. WHICH CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.999
THE GUYS FROM STORAGE WARS SAID NO. I LOVE DUCK DYNASTY, DON'T

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.999
GET ME WRONG. I REALLY DON'T THINK THE WHISTLE -- ALL MY GOD,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.999
IT WORKS. HE IS HERE. I ALWAYS HATED THAT ONE. AS SOME OF YOU

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.999
KNOW, THIS IS MY SECOND TIME SPEAKING AT THIS EVENT. I WAS 18

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.999
YEARS AGO IN 1995, A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN. TODAY YOU CAN

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.999
GET REAL-TIME INFORMATION ON WORLD EVENTS FROM SOMETHING SMALL

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.999
ENOUGH TO FIT IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND. BACK IN 1995, WE CALLED

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.999
THAT GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS. [LAUGHTER] I CAN SEE IF GEORGE IS

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.999
HERE BECAUSE THERE IS A CROUTON IN THE WAY. [LAUGHTER] IT IS

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.999
AMAZING TO THINK HOW MUCH OUR COUNTRY HAS CHANGED IN 18 YEARS.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.999
THINK ABOUT IT. IF IN 1995 HE TOLD ME THAT IN  2013, WE WOULD

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.999
HAVE AN AFRICAN- AMERICAN PRESIDENT WITH A MIDDLE NAME HUSSEIN,

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.999
WHO WAS JUST REELECTED TO A SECOND TERM IN A SLUGGISH ECONOMY,

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.999
I WOULD HAVE SAID, OH, YOU MUST HAVE RUN AGAINST MITT ROMNEY.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.999
[LAUGHTER] BY THE WAY, NO OFFENSE, I DO  CONGRATULATE YOU ON

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.999
YOUR VICTORY, BUT AS A LATE-NIGHT COMEDIAN, I WAS KIND OF

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.999
PULLING FOR THE RICH GUY WHO'S OR STANSTED THE OLYMPICS. --

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.999
WHOSE HORSE DANCED IN THE OLYMPICS. [LAUGHTER] THE DEMOGRAPHICS

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.999
OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE BEEN RAPIDLY CHANGING OVER THE PAST TWO

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:17.999
DECADES. I LOOK FORWARD TO HOSTING THIS EVENT 18 YEARS FROM

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.999
NOW. THEN, MY OPENING LINE WILL BE, [SPEAKING SPANISH] SI.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.999
ESPECIALMENTE, PRESIDENTE MARIO LOPEZ. MY PRIOR EXPERIENCE HAS

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.999
TAUGHT ME HOW THESE DINNERS WORK. IF THE PRESIDENT LAUGHS,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:43.999
EVERYONE LAUGHS. IF THE FOX NEWS TABLE LAUGHS, A LITTLE GIRL

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.999
JUST FELL OFF HER BIKE. [LAUGHTER] HOW ARE YOU DOING, BILL?

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.999
I'LL BE WASHINGTON NEWS MEDIATOR TONIGHT, INCLUDING THE  STARS

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.999
OF ONLINE JOURNALISM. I DID THE HUFFINGTON POST HAS A TABLE.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.999
WHICH HAS ME WONDERING, IF YOU ARE HERE, WHO IS COVERING MILEY

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:15.999
CYRUS'S LATEST NIP SLIP? WHO IS ASSEMBLING TODAY'S TOP 25

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.999
YOGURT RELATED TWEETS? [LAUGHTER] JUST BEFORE DINNER, I TRIED

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:26.999
TO SAY HELLO TO EVERY ON HUFFINGTON, BUT SHE MADE ME WATCH A

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.999
32ND AD FIRST. -- 30-SECOND AD FIRST. [LAUGHTER] A LOT OF

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.999
ONLINE STARS IN THE ROOM, BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT JUDGE COULDN'T

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.999
MAKE IT. HE HAD A PRIOR COMMITMENT TO TEACH A WEB DESIGN CLASS

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.999
IN 1997. THE WASHINGTON PRINT MEDIA IS ALSO JOINING US THIS

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:55.999
EVENING. THE PRINT MEDIA ARE HERE FOR TWO VERY GOOD REASONS.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.999
FOOD AND SHELTER. [LAUGHTER] YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE SAY PRINT

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:07.999
MEDIA IS DYING, BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT. NEITHER DOES MY

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.999
BLACKSMITH. [LAUGHTER] YOU HAVE GOT TO MEET ZACHARIAH, HE IS

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.999
GREAT. NEWSWEEK, WHICH AFTER 80 YEARS PUBLISHED ITS LAST PRINT

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.999
ISSUE. TIME MAGAZINE MIGHT BE GLOATING, BUT THEY REALLY

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:28.999
SHOULDN'T, BECAUSE TIME WILL OUTLIVE NEWSWEEK A WAY JULIETT

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.999
OUTLIVED ROMEO. READ THE PLAY, IT IS VERY SMART. [LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.999
THINGS ARE SO TOUGH FOR MEDIA, REUTERS IS HAVING ITS AFTER

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.999
PARTY RIGHT HERE AT THE HILTON. BECAUSE NOTHING SAYS WE ARE

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.999
HAVING A GREAT HERE LIKE HAVING YOUR AFTER PARTY AT THE SAME

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.999
TABLE WHERE YOU JUST HAD DINNER. [LAUGHTER] WITH THAT IN MIND,

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:58.999
REUTERS IS ASKING EVERYONE HERE TO LEAVE A LITTLE WINE AT THE

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.999
BOTTOM OF THE GLASS. [LAUGHTER] TO BE FAIR, PRINT MEDIA STILL

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.999
HAS A BIG STAR IN BOB WOODWARD. GOT TO GIVE IT UP FOR BOB

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.999
WOODWARD. [APPLAUSE] EARLIER THIS EVENING, A WAITER ASKED HIM

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.999
IF HE WANTED REGULAR OR DECAF AND HE SAID, THREATENING ME. --

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.999
STOP THREATENING ME! SOME BIG NAMES IN TELEVISION NEWS.  WHEN

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.999
IT COMES TO TELEVISION NEWS, WE HAVE A DIVIDED  LANDSCAPE. FOX

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.999
NEWS IS WATCHED BY CONSERVATIVES, MSNBC WATCHED BY LIBERALS AND

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:41.999
CNN IS WATCHED BY PEOPLE WHO CLEAN THE OFFICES AT  CNN.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.999
[LAUGHTER] [OOHS] OH, IT GETS WORST. CNN'S RATINGS ARE SO LOW,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:52.999
WHEN IT COMES UP, JAMES EARL JONES SAYS, YOU ARE WATCHING CNN?

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.999
WHAT THE HELL? I HAVE TO SAY, IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, CNN HAS

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:09.999
MADE SOME ODD MOVES. IT REPLACED THE -- POPULAR LARRY KING WITH

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.999
ONE OF THE FOOTMAN FROM "DOWNTON ABBEY." IT IS GOOD TO SEE MY

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.999
OLD FRIENDS AT MSNBC. CHRIS MATTHEWS IS HERE. CHRIS MATTHEWS

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.999
HAS THE ONLY SHOW WHERE THE COMMERCIAL EXISTS JUST SO THEY CAN

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.999
WIPE THE SPITTLE OFF THE LENS. [LAUGHTER] DURING THE BOSTON

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.999
COVERAGE ON MSNBC LAST WEEK, CHUCK TODD STOPPED A PUNDIT FROM

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.999
SPECULATING ON ON FIRE SIDE -- UNVERIFIED INFORMATION. THERE IS

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.999
NO JOKE HERE. I'M JUST LETTING THE PEOPLE AT CNN KNOW THAT YOU

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.999
CAN DO THAT. [LAUGHTER] THIS IS A LEARNING EXPERIENCE. FOX NEWS

00:12:47.000 --> 00:13:01.999
STAR BILL O'REILLY, HE HAS BECOME QUITE THE AUTHOR. TWO RECENT

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.999
BESTSELLERS, " KILLING KENNEDY" AND "KILLING LINCOLN." BILL

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.999
O'REILLY IS NOW WORKING ON HIS NEXT BOOK, DUE OUT THIS FALL,

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.999
THIS TIME ABOUT THE KILLING OF JESUS. IT WILL BE THE FIRST TIME

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.999
IN HISTORY THAT HIS DEATH IS BLAMED ON OBAMACARE. [LAUGHTER]

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:27.999
TWO QUICK SHOUT OUTS TO PBS AND NPR. PBS -- YES! [APPLAUSE]

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.999
THOSE PEOPLE LOVE TO PARTY. BE SAFE, WHERE A TOTE BAG.  IT

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.999
WORKS. YOU HAVE GOT TO LOVE NPR. STILL THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:45.999
FOR NEWS DELIVERED AS IF THERE IS A TODDLER SLEEPING IN THE

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.999
NEXT ROOM. [LAUGHTER] SHH! NBC NEWS IS IN THE HOUSE. THEY HAVE

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.999
HAD A ROUGH GO OF IT. THE TODAY SHOW LET GO OF INQUIRY. AFTER

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.999
BEING TOLD THAT AN CURRY SAID, HOW BROKER TELLS THE WORLD THAT

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.999
HE CRAFTED ANSWER THE WHITE HOUSE AND I AM GETTING FIRED? AL IS

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:10.999
THE REASON THERE ARE NO MORE CHORES OF THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY'RE

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.999
STILL HOSING DOWN. [CROWD OOHS] BRIAN WILLIAMS IS HERE. I AM A

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.999
BIG FAN OF YOUR SHOW. IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT, IMAGINE BRAND

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.999
DELIVERING THE EVENING NEWS ON A DIFFERENT FLOOR OF THE

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.999
BUILDING, A LITTLE LATER, WITH A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TYPE. IT IS

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.999
A MIND BLOWER. CHECK IT OUT. AS I LOOK ALL AROUND THE ROOM, I

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.999
REALIZE THIS IS ONE BIG HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA. THAT IS ALL IT

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.999
IS. THINK ABOUT IT. FOX IS THE JOCKS. MSNBC IS THE NERDS.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:56.999

WITH THIS PORT OF CELEBRITIES LIKE TED NUGENT AND MEET HOUSE.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:42.999

FOR VICE PRESIDENT. AFTER THE ELECTION, HE SAID PRESIDENT OBAMA

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.999
WAS REELECTED BECAUSE OF THE HIGH TURNOUT OF  URBAN VOTERS.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.999

FAVORITE WHILE THE CONSERVATIVES OPPOSE ANY LIFE LONG UNION

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:48.999

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.999
REALLY SCARY ENEMIES LIKE SADDAM HUSSAIN AND HITLER. NOW,

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:48.999
SUDDENLY OUR NEMESIS IS A POUTY TEENAGE BOY WHO DRESSES LIKE

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.999
ROSIE O'DONNELL AT THE EMMYS. KIM JONG-UN DOES NOT UNDERSTAND

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.999
THAT WE AREN'T AFRAID OF HIM. WHAT THAT GUY DOESN'T GET IS

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.999

NOW. HE IS AT THE VERY NICE STAGE  WHERE THERE ARE NO MORE

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.999
SECRETS LEFT TO COME OUT ABOUT HIM. WE ALL KNOW THAT HE LIVED

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.999
IN INDONESIA AS A CHILD, STUDIED AT A MUSLIM SEMINARY AND

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.999
OCCASIONALLY A DOG. -- ATE DOG. FROM THE BEGINNING, A KID WHO

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.999

THE PRESIDENT AND THE PRESS CAN SEEM A BIT STRAINED AT TIMES.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.999
SOME IN THIS ROOM HAVE ACCUSED HIM OF BEING DISTANT AND ALOOF.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:54.999
WHEN I ASKED THE PRESIDENT ABOUT IT EARLIER, HE SAID, OH, AND

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.999
THEN WALKED AWAY. [LAUGHTER] IT IS ONLY NATURAL, BUT MR.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.999
PRESIDENT ELECTION WAS LESS EXCITING THAN THE FIRST TIME AROUND

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.999
IN 2008. AN ELECTION NIGHT, YOU CELEBRATED WITH HUNDREDS OF

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.999
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN CHICAGO'S GRANT PARK. IT WAS

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.999
FASCINATING. THIS TIME AROUND, YOU SPLIT THE HOT DOG DID NOT

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.999
ASK ABOUT. IT DID NOT HAVE THE SAME BUZZ. IT HAS BEEN SEVERAL

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.999
MONTHS SINCE YOU WERE REELECTED, SO I AM CURIOUS, WHY ARE YOU

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.999
STILL SENDING EVERYONE FIVE E-MAILS A DAY ASKING FOR MORE

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.999
MONEY? YOU ONE. -- YOU WON. DO YOU HAVE A GAMBLING PROBLEM  WE

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.999
DON'T KNOW ABOUT? DID YOU PUT IT ALL ON GONZAGA? YOU DID,

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.999
DIDN'T YOU? HE DID. [GAVEL POUNDS] PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS ALREADY

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.999
MADE A LOT OF CHANGES IN HIS SECOND TERM. YOU RECENTLY

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.999
APPOINTED JOHN KERRY AND CHUCK HAGEL.  SMART MOVES. THE ONLY

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.999
TWO PEOPLE IN THE UNITED TO LOOK EVEN MORE TIRED THAN YOU.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.999
[LAUGHTER] A GREAT STRATEGY. MR. PRESIDENT, YOU WILL LEAVE

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.999
OFFICE A VERY YOUNG MAN. THE PRESIDENCY HAS TAKEN HOLD -- TAKEN

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.999
IT'S TOLL. YOU ARE STARTING TO LOOK LIKE A JUDGE ON "LAW AND

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.999
ORDER." JUST SAY, YOU ARE ON THIN ICE, COUNSELOR. YOU COULD

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.999
HAVE THAT PART RIGHT AWAY. YOUR HAIR IS SO WHITE, IT COULD  BE

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.999
A MEMBER OF YOUR CABINET. [LAUGHTER] [CROWD OOHS] HE CAN HANDLE

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.999
IT. HE RECENTLY PICKED THE NEW TREASURY SECRETARY, JACK LEW. IF

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.999
THE PRESIDENT EVER HAS TO LET HIM GO, HE CAN SAY, IT IS NOT

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.999
LEW, IT'S ME. [LAUGHTER] THE QUOTE A CITY MUST BUT THE

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.999
PRESIDENT IS THAT HE IS ALWAYS THE COOLEST GUY IN THE ROOM.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.999
THAT IS WHAT EVERYONE SAYS. HE IS THE COOLEST GUY IN THE  ROOM.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.999
HERE IS MY QUESTION. WHO ELSE IS IN THAT ROOM? IT IS NOT HARD

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:59.999
TO BE THE COOL ONE WHEN THE OTHER GUYS IN THE ROOM R BIDEN,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.999

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.999
LOOKING FORWARD TO MY AUDIT. [LAUGHTER] IT IS COMING. I KNOW. I

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.999
WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT HERE AND CHANGE GEARS AND SAY SOME

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.999
INTO THE PRESIDENT. REGARDING THE EVENTS OF THE PAST TWO WEEKS.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.999
SOME OF YOU MAY NOT KNOW THIS. I GREW UP IN BOSTON. BUT PARENTS

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.999
STILL LIVE THERE. MY BROTHER, LUKE, RAISED HIS FAMILY IN

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.999
WATERTOWN. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK, YOU

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.999
MR. PRESIDENT, FOR VISITING THAT GREAT CITY AND HELPING PEOPLE

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:52.999
BEGIN TO HEAL WITH YOUR INSPIRING WORDS. YOU MADE A HUGE

DIFFERENCE. [APPLAUSE] IT HAS BEEN SAID RECENTLY THAT YOU DON'T

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.999
MESS WITH BOSTON. AS SOMEONE WHO GREW UP THERE, I WOULD LIKE TO

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.999
ECHO THAT SENTIMENT. IT IS REALLY PRETTY SIMPLE. IF YOU'RE

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.999
GOING TO PICK ON A CITY, DON'T CHOOSE ONE WHERE NINE OUT OF 10

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:16.999
PEOPLE ARE RELATED TO A COP. DON'T DO IT. IT IS STUPID. THAT

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.999
INCLUDES MYSELF. I HAVE ONE MORE THING TO MENTION BEFORE I GO.
