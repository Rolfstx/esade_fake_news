00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
 If you want to change the world 

00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:03.420
 Start with your bed first 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.840
 If you arrange your bed every morning 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.880
 You will have completed the first mission of the day 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.760
 This will give you a little sense of pride and will encourage you to do other tasks 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.040
 And others and more 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.660
 And at the end of the day it will turn into many completed tasks 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.200
 And arranging your bed will really enhance 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.820
 The small things in life are important 

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:29.605
 If you are not able to do small things correctly 

00:00:30.055 --> 00:00:32.395
 Then you will not be able to do the most important things correctly 

00:00:32.885 --> 00:00:35.175
 And if I had a bad day 

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.625
 You will return to the mattress you have arranged 

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:44.685
 A tidy bed gives you enough courage that tomorrow will be better 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.360
 To cross the maritime training assignments 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.720
 A long series of types of swimming must be completed 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.880
 Someone is swimming at night 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.320
 The mentors happily brief their students 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.300
 On all kinds of sharks that live in the waters of San Clemente 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.720
 They confirm with you however 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.880
 There is no trainee that has been eaten by any penny 

00:01:06.805 --> 00:01:08.365
 At least no one remembered this had happened 

00:01:09.785 --> 00:01:11.445
 But you also knew 

00:01:11.785 --> 00:01:14.425
 If one penny surrounds your position 

00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:16.035
 You will remain your place 

00:01:16.595 --> 00:01:17.945
 Do not swim far 

00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:19.685
 Do not represent that you are afraid 

00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:23.085
 And if the shark 

00:01:23.085 --> 00:01:25.820
 And if the shark wanted you for a dinner, head towards you 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.660
 Then gather your strength 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.420
 The punch is on his snout 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.920
 He will be included again 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.540
 There are a lot of sharks in this world 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.420
 If you hope to complete swimming 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.520
 You have to make a deal with them 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.360
 So if you want to change the world 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.720
 Do not be afraid and retreat in front of the sharks 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.880
 After a few weeks of difficult exercises 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.880
 My sailing class started with 150 men 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.580
 Only 42 of them remain 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.600
 There are now 6 boats each for 7 men 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.160
 I was on a boat with tall men 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.080
 But the best crew made was young men 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.940
 We call them Mengin crew 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.260
 None of them was longer than 5 feet 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.120
 The men short crew contained an American Indian, African American and Polish American 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.100
 Greek American and Italian American 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.640
 And 2 were from the Midwest 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.460
 They outperformed all other teams 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.475
 There is a tall man in another team 

00:02:24.475 --> 00:02:25.475
 He was fun-loving in nature 

00:02:25.965 --> 00:02:28.565
 From small fins 

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.275
 That Al-Qassar team places on their legs 

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:32.865
 Before every time they swim 

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:35.875
 But somehow these ones 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.380
 From every corner of the earth 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.140
 They always laugh at last 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.440
 They swim faster than all teams and first reach the beach 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.800
 Faster than others 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.880
 Maritime training was a good simulator 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.180
 Nothing important but your determination to succeed 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.480
 Neither your education nor your social skills 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.415
 If you want to change the world 

00:02:56.415 --> 00:02:58.045
 See the person the size of his heart 

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.185
 Neither their height nor their fins 

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:03.565
 The 9 weeks of training were called Hell Weeks 

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.075
 6 days without sleep 

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:08.165
 Suffering from physical and mental pain 

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:10.515
 And one special day is clay day 

00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:14.045
 The clay area is from the Hilla region between San Diego and Taiwan 

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:16.875
 Where the water runs out 

00:03:16.875 --> 00:03:19.455
 A mud swamp where mud will drown you 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.220
 It is Wednesday of the week of Hell 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.000
 But the trainees are sleeping in the mud 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.580
 They spend the next 15 hours 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.420
 Trying to survive the bitter cold 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.880
 And the pressure placed on them by the mentors 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.140
 And when the sun begins to sunset on Wednesday evening 

00:03:37.735 --> 00:03:39.875
 My training class 

00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:41.395
 They made some terrible mistakes in the rules 

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.185
 That I ordered in the mud 

00:03:44.955 --> 00:03:47.925
 Clay consumes every man 

00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:49.425
 There is nothing clear except their heads 

00:03:50.005 --> 00:03:53.035
 The supervisors told us that we can leave the mud now 

00:03:53.035 --> 00:03:54.065
 If 5 men quit 

00:03:54.805 --> 00:03:57.695
 Five men only five! 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.060
 Then we can get out of the cold death 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.480
 Look around the mud swamp 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.900
 It was clear that some of the trainees were about to surrender 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.620
 It had been 8 hours to stay and our bones chilled 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.340
 Teeth shiver and officials complain 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.160
 From the loud trainees 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.380
 Then there was one voice that echoed at night 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.620
 Ola sounded like a song 

00:04:24.835 --> 00:04:26.175
 Bad song notes 

00:04:27.695 --> 00:04:29.655
 But the enthusiasm in it was wonderful 

00:04:30.275 --> 00:04:31.885
 One vote became two 

00:04:32.205 --> 00:04:34.695
 And then three 

00:04:34.695 --> 00:04:35.725
 And before the time everyone started singing 

00:04:36.095 --> 00:04:38.805
 The supervisors threatened us that we will stay longer in the mud 

00:04:38.805 --> 00:04:41.080
 If we continue singing 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.800
 But we were insisting singing 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.940
 Somehow, the clay became warmer 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.000
 And the swamp land was not far from us 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.440
 If I learned something during my travel around the world 

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:54.405
 It is the power of hope 

00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:56.975
 The power of one person 

00:04:57.645 --> 00:04:59.685
 Washington, Lincoln, King, or Mandela 

00:05:00.395 --> 00:05:03.245
 Even the young girl from Malala Pakistan 

00:05:03.245 --> 00:05:05.395
 One person can change the world by giving people hope 

00:05:05.825 --> 00:05:08.705
 So if you want to change the world 

00:05:09.865 --> 00:05:12.005
 Start each day by completing a mission 

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:15.875
 He helped anyone in his life 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.960
 Respect everyone, know that life is not fair and will fall again and again 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.500
 But if you take a risk 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.620
 Standing in difficult times, standing against bullies, raising the weak and miserable 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:27.260
 And never will never give up 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.460
 If you do such things 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.600
 The next generation and the next generation 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.340
 They will experience this world much better than we lived 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.160
 What certainly seemed here 

00:05:37.745 --> 00:05:39.975
 He changed the world for the better
