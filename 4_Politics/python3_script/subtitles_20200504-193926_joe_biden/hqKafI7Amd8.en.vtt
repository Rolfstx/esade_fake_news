 Translated by: Rik Delaet Checked by: Christel Foncke 

00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:15.587
 So this is a hotel room, just like the one I stay in. 

00:00:15.587 --> 00:00:17.731
 Sometimes I get bored. 

00:00:17.731 --> 00:00:21.158
 Such a room does not offer much entertainment. 

00:00:21.158 --> 00:00:25.687
 But for a hacker, she's a bit interesting, 

00:00:25.687 --> 00:00:28.136
 because that television is different from the home, 

00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:31.058
 it is a node on a network. 

00:00:31.058 --> 00:00:33.442
 That means I can mess with it. 

00:00:33.442 --> 00:00:37.024
 I plug a small device like this into my computer. 

00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:40.359
 It is an infrared transmitter-receiver with which I can send the codes 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.524
 that the TV remote can transmit and some other codes. 

00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:47.128
 Well, then I can watch movies for free. 

00:00:47.277 --> 00:00:49.275
 (Laughter) 

00:00:49.275 --> 00:00:53.681
 That doesn't really matter to me, but I can also play video games. 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:57.734
 Hey, but what is this? 

00:00:57.935 --> 00:01:01.010
 Not only can I do this for my TV in my hotel room, 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.822
 I can also control the TV in your hotel room. 

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:05.006
 (Laughter) 

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:07.906
 So I can see what you are looking at, 

00:01:07.906 --> 00:01:10.892
 you know, that data on your TV 

00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:13.512
 when you surf the web on your hotel TV. 

00:01:13.512 --> 00:01:16.224
 I can see you doing it. 

00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:19.983
 Sometimes it is very interesting. 

00:01:19.983 --> 00:01:22.374
 Transfer of funds. 

00:01:22.712 --> 00:01:25.830
 Really large payment traffic. 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.041
 You never know what people want to do 

00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:31.528
 while surfing the web from their hotel room. 

00:01:31.892 --> 00:01:34.633
 (Laughter) 

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:38.122
 The point is I can tell if you're watching Disney or porn tonight. 

00:01:38.122 --> 00:01:40.451
 Is there anyone else in the Affinia hotel here? 

00:01:40.451 --> 00:01:42.614
 (Laughter) 

00:01:42.614 --> 00:01:46.502
 This is a project I worked on when we were trying to figure it out 

00:01:46.502 --> 00:01:49.292
 what about the security of wireless networks. 

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:50.446
 It is called the 'Hackerbot'. 

00:01:50.446 --> 00:01:54.007
 This is a robot we built to find WiFi users. 

00:01:54.007 --> 00:01:57.358
 He drives over to them and shows them their passwords on the screen. 

00:01:57.358 --> 00:02:00.621
 (Laughter) 

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.572
 We just wanted to build a robot, 

00:02:02.572 --> 00:02:05.143
 but we didn't know what to let him do, so - 

00:02:05.143 --> 00:02:07.338
 we made it a gun version. 

00:02:07.338 --> 00:02:09.131
 This is called the 'Sniper Yagi'. 

00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:11.890
 He sniffs long-distance passwords. 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.669
 I can see your wireless network from a mile away. 

00:02:14.669 --> 00:02:16.728
 This is a project I did with Ben Laurie 

00:02:16.728 --> 00:02:19.308
 worked to demonstrate passive surveillance. 

00:02:19.308 --> 00:02:22.171
 This is a map of the conference 

00:02:22.171 --> 00:02:24.427
 Computers, Freedom and Privacy. 

00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:28.774
 This conference took place in a hotel, and we placed 

00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:31.346
 a computer in every room 

00:02:31.346 --> 00:02:33.284
 which recorded all bluetooth traffic. 

00:02:33.284 --> 00:02:36.376
 We were able to hear telephone and laptop traffic from everyone 

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:38.667
 record and correlate, 

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:42.198
 and then I could make such a card for everyone at the conference. 

00:02:42.198 --> 00:02:45.541
 This is Kim Cameron, the Chief Privacy Architect at Microsoft. 

00:02:45.541 --> 00:02:46.468
 (Laughter) 

00:02:46.468 --> 00:02:49.139
 Without knowing it, 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.880
 I could see where he went everywhere 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.220
 and correlate with who he was, 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.023
 (dial phone) 

00:02:56.023 --> 00:02:57.522
 when he was bored, 

00:02:57.522 --> 00:02:59.210
 (dial phone) 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.521
 hangs out in the lobby. 

00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:02.964
 Does anyone here use a cell phone? 

00:03:02.964 --> 00:03:04.616
 (Laughter) 

00:03:04.616 --> 00:03:08.488
 (Telephone rings) 

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:12.459
 My phone is ringing - 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.401
 (ringing) 

00:03:17.401 --> 00:03:19.429
 rings - 

00:03:23.593 --> 00:03:25.769
 Voice mail: You have 100 messages. 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.586
 Palbos Holman: Oh, oh! 

00:03:27.586 --> 00:03:29.744
 VM: First unheard message - 

00:03:29.744 --> 00:03:31.086
 PH: Where should I press - 

00:03:31.086 --> 00:03:33.687
 VM: Message skipped. First skipped message. 

00:03:33.687 --> 00:03:34.603
 PH: Oh, oh! 

00:03:34.603 --> 00:03:38.133
 VM: Main menu: to listen - You pressed the wrong key - 

00:03:38.133 --> 00:03:41.463
 You have two skipped messages. Three saved messages. 

00:03:41.463 --> 00:03:42.583
 Farewell. 

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:46.264
 PH: Oh, oh! We are in Brad's voicemail. 

00:03:46.543 --> 00:03:47.994
 (Laughter) 

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:50.240
 I wanted to record a new message for him, 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.953
 but I seem to have pressed an invalid key, 

00:03:52.953 --> 00:03:54.323
 so we continue. 

00:03:54.323 --> 00:03:57.963
 I'll explain later because we don't have much time. 

00:03:57.963 --> 00:04:00.114
 Does anyone here use MySpace? 

00:04:00.114 --> 00:04:01.745
 MySpace users? Oh! 

00:04:01.745 --> 00:04:05.111
 Was popular once. It's kind of like Facebook. 

00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:08.663
 Our friend Samy tried to meet sweethearts on MySpace 

00:04:08.663 --> 00:04:10.824
 - I think it used to be before. 

00:04:10.824 --> 00:04:15.514
 He created a page on MySpace for himself. 

00:04:16.241 --> 00:04:19.075
 It made a list of all your friends, and you knew that 

00:04:19.075 --> 00:04:22.031
 if someone was cool because they had a lot of friends on MySpace. 

00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:23.852
 Samy had no friends. 

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:27.743
 He wrote a little Javascript code that he put in his page, 

00:04:27.743 --> 00:04:29.585
 so that when you looked at his page 

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:32.028
 you were simply added 'automagically' as a friend. 

00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:35.369
 And it skipped the entire recognition protocol 

00:04:35.369 --> 00:04:37.703
 that asked, "Is Samy really your friend?" 

00:04:37.703 --> 00:04:40.939
 But then it copied that code to your page, 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:43.045
 so that when someone looked at your page 

00:04:43.045 --> 00:04:45.856
 who automatically also became Samy's friend. 

00:04:45.856 --> 00:04:46.925
 (Laughter) 

00:04:46.925 --> 00:04:50.514
 And it customized your page by saying, "Samy is your hero." 

00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:52.023
 (Laughter) 

00:04:52.023 --> 00:04:56.442
 In less than 24 hours, Samy had over a million friends on MySpace. 

00:04:56.442 --> 00:04:58.615
 (Laughter) 

00:04:58.615 --> 00:05:03.415
 His three years of probation have just ended. 

00:05:03.553 --> 00:05:05.446
 (Laughter) 

00:05:05.446 --> 00:05:09.209
 Even better, Christopher Abad, this guy, another hacker, did even better. 

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:12.319
 He also tried to get sweethearts through MySpace, 

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:13.782
 but with uneven results. 

00:05:13.782 --> 00:05:15.653
 Sometimes these dates were disappointing, 

00:05:15.653 --> 00:05:19.678
 so Abad wrote a little piece of code 

00:05:19.678 --> 00:05:25.602
 to connect MySpace to SpamAssassin, an open source spam filter. 

00:05:25.602 --> 00:05:28.045
 It works just like the spam filter in your email. 

00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:30.280
 You train it by giving up some spam, 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.722
 also some legitimate email, 

00:05:32.722 --> 00:05:35.149
 and it tries to deal with artificial intelligence 

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:37.270
 work out the difference. Yes? 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.280
 Well, he dropped girls' profiles 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.262
 who he met and liked, 

00:05:41.262 --> 00:05:43.088
 treat it as legitimate email. 

00:05:43.088 --> 00:05:45.478
 Profiles of girls he didn't like, 

00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:46.745
 were considered spam. 

00:05:46.745 --> 00:05:50.347
 And he applied that to every profile on MySpace. 

00:05:50.347 --> 00:05:52.923
 (Laughter) 

00:05:52.923 --> 00:05:56.818
 Girls you might like to meet up with come out. 

00:05:56.818 --> 00:05:59.326
 Three things can be said about Abad. 

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:02.531
 Why do we need Match.com when we can have spam dating? 

00:06:02.531 --> 00:06:05.105
 You know this is innovation. 

00:06:05.105 --> 00:06:07.461
 He had a problem and found a solution. 

00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:08.623
 Is someone using 

00:06:08.623 --> 00:06:09.483
 - bleep - 

00:06:09.483 --> 00:06:12.053
 this kind of key to open his car remotely? 

00:06:12.053 --> 00:06:16.421
 They're popular in, well, maybe not Chicago, okay. 

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:19.929
 Today, young people drive past a Walmart parking lot 

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:22.183
 and click open, open, open, bloep. 

00:06:22.183 --> 00:06:25.690
 In the end you will find another Jetta or whatever just like yours, 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.555
 maybe a different color, which has the same key code. 

00:06:29.714 --> 00:06:31.321
 And they run away with it. 

00:06:31.321 --> 00:06:34.182
 Your insurance company will shift the debt on you, 

00:06:34.182 --> 00:06:35.854
 because there is no evidence of burglary. 

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:39.626
 For a manufacturer, we figured out how to manipulate that key 

00:06:39.626 --> 00:06:43.373
 so that he got every car from that manufacturer open. 

00:06:43.373 --> 00:06:44.659
 (Laughter) 

00:06:44.659 --> 00:06:48.510
 I could tell you more about this, but I hardly have time, 

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.184
 because your car or phone are now also PCs, 

00:06:52.184 --> 00:06:55.723
 and maybe your toaster soon. 

00:06:55.723 --> 00:06:57.757
 I'm not joking. 

00:06:57.757 --> 00:07:00.192
 When that happens, 

00:07:00.192 --> 00:07:04.342
 you have to deal with all the security problems of PCs. 

00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:06.462
 And there are many. 

00:07:06.462 --> 00:07:09.262
 Keep that in mind, we'll get to it. 

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.575
 Does anyone have such a lock on their front door? 

00:07:12.575 --> 00:07:14.528
 Okay. 

00:07:14.528 --> 00:07:15.895
 Me too. 

00:07:15.895 --> 00:07:17.205
 This is a Schlage lock. 

00:07:17.205 --> 00:07:19.800
 It sits on half of the front doors in America. 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:23.240
 I brought one. 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.437
 This is my Schlage lock. 

00:07:25.437 --> 00:07:30.413
 This is a key that fits in the lock but is filed incorrectly, so it does not turn. 

00:07:30.413 --> 00:07:34.702
 Has anyone here ever tried to open locks with something like this? 

00:07:34.702 --> 00:07:39.207
 Okay, some nasty slot toddlers. 

00:07:39.893 --> 00:07:41.994
 Well it is for children with OCD. 

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:44.615
 You have to put them in and pick them out. 

00:07:44.615 --> 00:07:48.193
 It takes hours to be handy enough to manipulate the pins. 

00:07:48.193 --> 00:07:51.177
 There is an easier way for ADD children at home. 

00:07:51.177 --> 00:07:53.376
 I put my little magic key here, 

00:07:53.376 --> 00:07:55.126
 With a little pressure I turn it over, 

00:07:55.126 --> 00:07:55.917
 (to knock) 

00:07:55.917 --> 00:07:59.253
 tap it a few times with this special mallet 

00:07:59.253 --> 00:08:02.322
 and just opened the lock. We're in there. 

00:08:03.312 --> 00:08:05.094
 It's easy. 

00:08:05.094 --> 00:08:08.309
 In fact, I don't really know much more about it than you do. 

00:08:08.309 --> 00:08:09.897
 It's really, really easy. 

00:08:09.897 --> 00:08:12.748
 I made a key ring with the same type of key 

00:08:12.748 --> 00:08:14.508
 for every lock in America. 

00:08:14.508 --> 00:08:19.442
 And for those interested I bought a key machine 

00:08:19.442 --> 00:08:22.510
 to make such a key for all of you. 

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:23.710
 (Laughter) 

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:25.134
 (Applause) 

00:08:25.134 --> 00:08:28.256
 As a gift for you. Come later and I'll show you 

00:08:28.256 --> 00:08:30.609
 how to force a lock and give you such a key 

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:32.628
 to test it at your door at home. 

00:08:32.628 --> 00:08:35.663
 Does anyone use these USB drives? 

00:08:35.663 --> 00:08:39.378
 Yes, print my Word document, yes! 

00:08:39.378 --> 00:08:41.703
 They are very popular. 

00:08:41.703 --> 00:08:43.833
 Mine works a bit like yours. 

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:46.259
 You can print my Word document for me. 

00:08:46.259 --> 00:08:47.859
 But while you do that, 

00:08:47.859 --> 00:08:50.935
 makes it invisible and magically in the background 

00:08:50.935 --> 00:08:54.056
 just a handy backup of your 'My Documents' folder, 

00:08:54.056 --> 00:08:58.132
 your browser history, cookies, your registration and password database 

00:08:58.132 --> 00:09:00.782
 and all the things you could ever need 

00:09:00.782 --> 00:09:01.986
 if you have a problem. 

00:09:01.986 --> 00:09:03.936
 We enjoy making such things 

00:09:03.936 --> 00:09:06.183
 and leave them lying around at conferences. 

00:09:06.183 --> 00:09:09.758
 (Laughter) 

00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.977
 Does anyone here use credit cards? 

00:09:11.977 --> 00:09:13.145
 (Laughter) 

00:09:13.145 --> 00:09:14.435
 Oh well! 

00:09:14.435 --> 00:09:17.956
 Yes, they are popular and extremely safe. 

00:09:17.956 --> 00:09:19.210
 (Laughter) 

00:09:19.210 --> 00:09:21.996
 New credit cards have been sent 

00:09:21.996 --> 00:09:25.768
 with a letter explaining that it is your new "Secure credit card". 

00:09:25.768 --> 00:09:27.004
 Does anyone already have them? 

00:09:27.004 --> 00:09:31.593
 You know she's safe because it contains a chip, an RFID tag. 

00:09:31.593 --> 00:09:34.792
 You can use them for Taxicabs and at Starbucks, 

00:09:34.792 --> 00:09:35.792
 I brought one, 

00:09:35.792 --> 00:09:37.956
 you just have to touch the reader. 

00:09:37.956 --> 00:09:39.969
 Has anyone ever seen it? 

00:09:39.969 --> 00:09:42.451
 Okay, who has one? 

00:09:44.151 --> 00:09:45.960
 Bring them here. 

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.910
 (Laughter) 

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.616
 There is a price for you. 

00:09:50.616 --> 00:09:53.772
 I just want to show what we found out about it. 

00:09:53.772 --> 00:09:55.663
 I received this credit card by post. 

00:09:55.663 --> 00:09:57.709
 I really need some volunteers. 

00:09:57.709 --> 00:10:01.517
 I need one, two, three, four, five volunteers because the winners 

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:04.181
 get this amazing stainless steel wallet 

00:10:04.181 --> 00:10:08.270
 that protects you from the problem, you guessed it, I'm going to show. 

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.670
 Bring your credit card and I'll show you. 

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:14.158
 I want to try it with one of these great new credit cards. 

00:10:14.158 --> 00:10:15.670
 Okay. 

00:10:18.796 --> 00:10:21.258
 We have a conference organizer, 

00:10:21.258 --> 00:10:23.872
 someone who can force people to cooperate? 

00:10:23.872 --> 00:10:24.825
 (Laughter) 

00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:28.583
 It's because you want it yourself, because - 

00:10:29.573 --> 00:10:32.708
 now the demo is going to be really great. 

00:10:32.708 --> 00:10:34.490
 You've never seen this - 

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:35.564
 (Inaudible question) 

00:10:35.564 --> 00:10:37.092
 What? 

00:10:37.092 --> 00:10:40.626
 They are really cool stainless steel wallets. 

00:10:41.133 --> 00:10:44.867
 Ever seen code on the screen at TED? 

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:47.001
 Yes, this is quite special. 

00:10:47.001 --> 00:10:49.808
 (Laughter) 

00:10:51.528 --> 00:10:53.432
 Great, I have volunteers. 

00:10:53.432 --> 00:10:56.590
 Who has such a great credit card? 

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.282
 Okay, here we go. 

00:10:59.282 --> 00:11:01.506
 I'm going to communicate your credit card number 

00:11:01.506 --> 00:11:03.890
 to only 350 close friends. 

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.194
 Do you hear the beep? 

00:11:06.194 --> 00:11:08.780
 That means someone is hacking your credit card. 

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.107
 Okay, what do we have now? 

00:11:10.107 --> 00:11:14.623
 Valued customer, card number and expiration date. 

00:11:14.623 --> 00:11:18.916
 It turns out that your safe new credit card is not that safe. 

00:11:19.332 --> 00:11:21.664
 Anyone else wanting to try it while you're here? 

00:11:21.664 --> 00:11:24.053
 Man: Can you install overdraft protection? 

00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:26.172
 PH: Beep, let's see what we have? 

00:11:26.172 --> 00:11:28.842
 We objected and AMEX changed it. 

00:11:28.842 --> 00:11:31.146
 so that the name is no longer visible. 

00:11:31.146 --> 00:11:33.353
 That is progress. 

00:11:33.353 --> 00:11:37.043
 You can see mine when it is shown. 

00:11:37.043 --> 00:11:40.702
 Yes, my name can be seen on it. That's what my mom calls me. 

00:11:40.702 --> 00:11:43.395
 Yours doesn't have it. 

00:11:44.365 --> 00:11:48.530
 Either way, next time you get something in the mail 

00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:51.957
 that says it's safe, send it to me. 

00:11:51.957 --> 00:11:54.582
 (Laughter) 

00:11:55.754 --> 00:11:59.046
 Oh wait, one of these is empty, hold on. 

00:12:00.856 --> 00:12:03.459
 I think it's this, yep, here it goes. 

00:12:03.459 --> 00:12:05.422
 You get the disassembled. 

00:12:05.422 --> 00:12:06.829
 Okay, cool. 

00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:10.351
 (Applause) 

00:12:10.351 --> 00:12:14.094
 I have a few minutes left, I'm going to tell you something. 

00:12:14.094 --> 00:12:15.025
 (Laughter) 

00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:15.926
 Oh shit. 

00:12:15.926 --> 00:12:17.670
 [I'm crazy] 

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.289
 That's my secret message. 

00:12:19.289 --> 00:12:20.719
 It should have been much faster. 

00:12:20.749 --> 00:12:25.209
 Here is the most exciting slide ever shown at TED. 

00:12:25.209 --> 00:12:27.502
 This is the protocol diagram for SSL, 

00:12:27.502 --> 00:12:29.613
 the encryption system in your web browser. 

00:12:29.613 --> 00:12:33.704
 It protects your credit card when you send them to Amazon and so on. 

00:12:33.704 --> 00:12:35.871
 Very exciting, I know, but the point is 

00:12:35.871 --> 00:12:39.173
 that hackers will attack every point in this protocol, right? 

00:12:39.173 --> 00:12:42.795
 I'm going to send two responses when the server expects one. 

00:12:42.795 --> 00:12:45.664
 I'm going to send a zero when he expects a one. 

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:48.506
 I'm going to send twice as much data as expected. 

00:12:48.506 --> 00:12:51.384
 I'm going to answer twice as long as expected. 

00:12:51.384 --> 00:12:54.406
 Try a lot of things and see where it breaks 

00:12:54.406 --> 00:12:56.218
 and wait to see what falls into my lap. 

00:12:56.218 --> 00:13:00.872
 If I find such a hole, I can look for a vulnerability. 

00:13:00.872 --> 00:13:03.240
 This is a bit more as SSL looks 

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.990
 very boring for hackers. 

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:10.747
 This little guy kills a million Africans every year. 

00:13:11.031 --> 00:13:14.791
 It is the Anopheles stephensi mosquito, carrier of malaria. 

00:13:15.738 --> 00:13:17.788
 Is this the wrong talk? 

00:13:17.788 --> 00:13:19.403
 (Laughter) 

00:13:19.403 --> 00:13:23.258
 This is a protocol diagram for malaria. 

00:13:23.892 --> 00:13:27.477
 We attack this protocol in our lab 

00:13:27.477 --> 00:13:29.241
 at every possible point. 

00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:32.878
 It has a very complicated life cycle that I will not go into right now, 

00:13:32.878 --> 00:13:36.227
 but it spends some time in humans and some time in mosquitoes. 

00:13:36.227 --> 00:13:39.467
 For that I need hackers. 

00:13:39.467 --> 00:13:43.508
 Because hackers have a mind out to explore, 

00:13:43.614 --> 00:13:47.407
 that is optimized to look for opportunities. 

00:13:47.407 --> 00:13:49.805
 I often illustrate this as follows. 

00:13:49.805 --> 00:13:54.676
 You have a new gadget and show it to your mother. 

00:13:55.455 --> 00:13:59.245
 Maybe she says, "What's this doing?" And you, "Mom, it's a phone." 

00:13:59.245 --> 00:14:02.566
 And she immediately knows exactly what it is for. 

00:14:02.566 --> 00:14:05.085
 But a hacker asks other questions. 

00:14:05.085 --> 00:14:08.909
 "What can I get this thing to do?" 

00:14:09.102 --> 00:14:12.029
 I take out all the screws, take the back off 

00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:13.984
 and break it into many small pieces 

00:14:13.984 --> 00:14:17.343
 and then figure out what I can make with that mess. 

00:14:17.343 --> 00:14:21.299
 That is discovery. We need that in science and technology 

00:14:21.299 --> 00:14:23.439
 to find the possibilities. 

00:14:23.439 --> 00:14:26.818
 In the lab I try to apply that way of thinking 

00:14:26.818 --> 00:14:29.843
 on some of the biggest problems people have. 

00:14:29.843 --> 00:14:34.152
 We are working on malaria at the request of Bill Gates. 

00:14:34.152 --> 00:14:36.863
 That is how we tried to solve malaria. 

00:14:36.863 --> 00:14:39.070
 This is a real 1940s ad. 

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:43.205
 We eradicated malaria in the US by spraying DDT everywhere. 

00:14:44.455 --> 00:14:48.505
 In the lab, we work hard to understand the problem. 

00:14:48.505 --> 00:14:53.658
 This is a high-speed video, we have a boulder from a video camera 

00:14:53.658 --> 00:14:56.293
 to learn how mosquitoes fly. 

00:14:56.293 --> 00:14:58.931
 You can see that they swim in the air earlier. 

00:14:58.931 --> 00:15:01.299
 We actually have no idea how they fly. 

00:15:01.299 --> 00:15:03.740
 But we have a nice video camera, so we - 

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.534
 (Laughter) 

00:15:05.534 --> 00:15:08.535
 Yes, it costs more than a Ferrari. 

00:15:08.535 --> 00:15:12.395
 In any case, we found a number of ways to get rid of mosquitoes. 

00:15:12.395 --> 00:15:14.807
 We fire them with laser beams. 

00:15:14.807 --> 00:15:19.318
 You get this if you have all kinds of scientists 

00:15:19.318 --> 00:15:21.318
 and put a laser nerd together in a room. 

00:15:21.318 --> 00:15:25.237
 At first people thought it was funny, 

00:15:25.237 --> 00:15:30.076
 but we found out we could build this with regular electronics. 

00:15:30.076 --> 00:15:33.390
 With the CCD of a webcam, 

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.590
 the laser of a Blu-ray burner, 

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:40.212
 the laser galvo comes from a laser printer. 

00:15:40.212 --> 00:15:43.220
 We do motion detection on a GPU processor 

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.414
 as you find it in a video game system. 

00:15:45.414 --> 00:15:47.613
 All things that follow Moore's law. 

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:50.228
 So it is not going to be too expensive. 

00:15:50.228 --> 00:15:52.466
 We want these laser systems 

00:15:52.466 --> 00:15:56.317
 around a building or village 

00:15:56.317 --> 00:15:59.507
 and just shoot all the mosquitoes that come at the people. 

00:15:59.507 --> 00:16:02.800
 And we would like to do that for your backyard. 

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.763
 We could also start protecting crops. 

00:16:04.763 --> 00:16:06.489
 Our team is now investigating 

00:16:06.489 --> 00:16:09.725
 what they need to do the same 

00:16:09.725 --> 00:16:12.899
 for the plague that is about two-thirds 

00:16:12.899 --> 00:16:16.477
 of the orange plantations in Florida. 

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:20.719
 People first laughed at it. 

00:16:20.719 --> 00:16:23.441
 This is a video of our system at work. 

00:16:23.441 --> 00:16:26.119
 We follow the mosquitoes as they fly around. 

00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:28.622
 Those visors come from our computer. 

00:16:28.622 --> 00:16:30.713
 It looks at them, sees them move 

00:16:30.713 --> 00:16:34.217
 and then point a laser at it to measure their wing beat frequency. 

00:16:34.217 --> 00:16:37.424
 That reveals which mosquito it is. 

00:16:37.424 --> 00:16:40.325
 An Anopheles stephensi? A female? 

00:16:40.325 --> 00:16:44.912
 And if so, she'll get a deadly laser shot. 

00:16:44.912 --> 00:16:46.981
 (Laughter) 

00:16:46.981 --> 00:16:48.753
 This works in a lab. 

00:16:48.753 --> 00:16:51.879
 Now we are going to test it in the field. 

00:16:51.879 --> 00:16:54.735
 All this is done in the Intellectual Ventures Lab 

00:16:54.735 --> 00:16:56.425
 in Seattle where I work. 

00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:59.356
 We try some of the most difficult problems 

00:16:59.356 --> 00:17:01.626
 that people have to deal with. 

00:17:01.626 --> 00:17:03.468
 This is the crucial shot. 

00:17:03.468 --> 00:17:07.171
 We just burn off his wing with a UV laser. 

00:17:07.171 --> 00:17:08.848
 He's not coming back. 

00:17:08.848 --> 00:17:12.071
 (Applause) 

00:17:12.071 --> 00:17:15.874
 His wing just evaporated. 

00:17:15.874 --> 00:17:18.636
 They love it. I mean, you know. 

00:17:18.636 --> 00:17:20.769
 Never received a call from PETA or anyone else. 

00:17:20.769 --> 00:17:23.226
 I mean it's the perfect enemy. 

00:17:23.226 --> 00:17:26.378
 There is simply no one who comes to the rescue of mosquitoes. 

00:17:26.378 --> 00:17:29.660
 Sometimes we exaggerate. 

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.093
 Anyway, I'm leaving now. 

00:17:32.093 --> 00:17:35.141
 This is the Intellectual Ventures Lab where I work. 

00:17:35.141 --> 00:17:38.565
 In principle, we use any kind of scientist 

00:17:38.565 --> 00:17:42.185
 and every tool in the world to develop crazy inventions. 

00:17:42.185 --> 00:17:43.537
 Thanks. 

00:17:43.537 --> 00:17:47.265
 (Applause)
