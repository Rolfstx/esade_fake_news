00:00:00.498 --> 00:00:03.081
(upbeat music)

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.000
- We're Sustainable Harvesters.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.740
What you're standing in is about

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.130
12,000 square feet of controlled

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.320
environment greenhouse space.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.663
In this space we can grow
up to 7,000 heads of lettuce

00:00:23.663 --> 00:00:27.157
in every week utilizing growing techniques

00:00:27.157 --> 00:00:29.060
called Aquaponics

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.520
and this awesome controlled
environment greenhouse

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.100
to protect us from the heat

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.480
in the Houston summers.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.264
So we grow a bunch of different varieties

00:00:37.264 --> 00:00:38.737
of leafy green lettuces

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:41.480
and we distribute that to restaurants

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.180
and other food service partners

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.530
all throughout Houston, San Antonio,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.560
Austin, Dallas, and even in Louisiana,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.090
including New Orleans and Baton Rouge.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.920
So we grow about 12 different
varieties of lettuce

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.750
and we pack them into our cardboard boxes

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.470
with seven varieties in each one,

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.271
a beautiful blend of reds and greens,

00:01:00.271 --> 00:01:02.140
crunchy and tender.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.470
From butter head lettuce, to oak leaf,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.570
to lolla rossa, and even
green and red romaine

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.770
to really bump our
differentiating product line

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.650
where chefs and other
food service partners

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.420
can get a product that
they've never seen before

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.540
and a product that has quality

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.800
and consistency like no other.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.400
So we seed all of our lettuce by hand

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.430
and we start them on these
grow trays right here.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.130
So this grow tray has 162 spots

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.400
of a one and one inch cube

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.730
that we ultimately put one seed in

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.570
and let them germinate in the dark

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.150
for about two days.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.943
After that time period they
have access to the sunlight.

00:01:43.943 --> 00:01:45.950
They're gonna grow their first leaf

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.860
and specifically with lettuce that

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.509
first leaf is called a radical.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.570
So once they hit that radical stage,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.250
we bring them into the sunlight

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.930
and we ultimately leave them under

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.336
LED lights for about two to three weeks.

00:01:57.336 --> 00:01:59.015
When they get to about this size

00:01:59.015 --> 00:02:00.550
or a little bit younger

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.450
or a little bit older,

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.446
we actually bring these trays down

00:02:03.446 --> 00:02:05.622
to the very back of the greenhouse

00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:07.622
where each one of these will pop out

00:02:07.622 --> 00:02:12.622
on a bed of pegs exposing
its cubed material.

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:17.150
This cube material is
made of 99% peat moss

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.530
with 1% elastic polymer

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.520
giving it a sponge-like effect,

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.151
allowing us to submerge
this root structure

00:02:24.151 --> 00:02:27.100
into water for the life of the product.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.780
So when we put these products in the water

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.422
we ultimately have to
remove product first.

00:02:32.422 --> 00:02:34.726
So the first stage in
every day is harvesting.

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:38.640
We try to harvest in the
earlier morning time period

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.490
because the lettuce does tend to wilt

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.775
in the summertime during the 11 to

00:02:42.775 --> 00:02:45.460
4 or 5 o'clock period of time.

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.702
So we're limited to the
morning hours to harvest.

00:02:47.702 --> 00:02:49.767
When we do harvest in the morning,

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:53.970
it's as easy as pulling this entire board

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.240
out of the water

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.103
and carefully bringing it
to our food preparation area

00:03:00.103 --> 00:03:02.534
where we'll ultimately take each one

00:03:02.534 --> 00:03:05.687
of these heads of
lettuce off of this board

00:03:05.687 --> 00:03:07.592
by pulling them out,

00:03:07.592 --> 00:03:10.860
exposing just a few of the bad leaves

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.210
that might be there.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.183
We'll ultimately compost those leaves,

00:03:14.183 --> 00:03:16.264
leaving this head of lettuce with

00:03:16.264 --> 00:03:17.831
its roots still in tact.

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:20.296
When we put these roots around this,

00:03:20.296 --> 00:03:22.890
it gives a shelf life of close to

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.240
three weeks in your refrigerator.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.780
Now that's a really big value for

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.390
our farmer's market patrons that

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.100
might take it home

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.060
and not wanna eat it that first week

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.260
and have that access to it the next week.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.576
For our restaurant partners,

00:03:35.576 --> 00:03:37.240
it's not as important,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.850
but it still allows that product

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.960
to be the freshest
product in their kitchen

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.296
because it is still living.

00:03:42.296 --> 00:03:44.456
Now when we remove these boards,

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:47.160
it leaves a space in these grow beds.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.112
These are 100 foot grow beds

00:03:49.112 --> 00:03:51.700
and we stack these every single day.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.822
Our entire process is very
similar to blockchain.

00:03:54.822 --> 00:03:56.378
When one thing goes out,

00:03:56.378 --> 00:03:58.519
one thing will go in at a different

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.620
area of the system.

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.280
So when we remove these boards,

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.550
we ultimately have to seed appropriately

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.420
because it's a time frame.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.940
So those seeds won't be in the water

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.944
for another two weeks

00:04:09.944 --> 00:04:13.157
so we really have to plan on
having that product in there

00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:17.288
and think forward about two
to six weeks at all time.

00:04:17.288 --> 00:04:19.321
Now when we remove the boards,

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:21.706
we leave a gap up in the front

00:04:21.706 --> 00:04:24.576
and then that allows us to push all

00:04:24.576 --> 00:04:27.318
the boards towards us
here, our harvest area,

00:04:27.318 --> 00:04:29.321
and stack new boards in the back

00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:32.124
utilizing our germination cubes.

00:04:32.124 --> 00:04:34.821
So it's as easy as pushing these back

00:04:34.821 --> 00:04:37.180
with just one hand

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.984
and if you can think of the reverse

00:04:38.984 --> 00:04:41.120
we'd be pushing these forward

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.353
so that we can ultimately
harvest this lettuce

00:04:43.353 --> 00:04:45.497
closer to our clean area

00:04:45.497 --> 00:04:48.010
so it really eliminates a lot of

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.060
the cross contamination effects.

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.712
We wear gloves, we wear aprons

00:04:51.712 --> 00:04:53.510
and hair nets or hats

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:55.860
so that there is a very limited chance

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.633
for any kind of cross
contamination in our system.

00:04:58.633 --> 00:05:01.593
Now when there is an
opening spot in the back,

00:05:01.593 --> 00:05:04.232
we'll ultimately have
to restock these plants

00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:08.350
and it's as easy as pulling
these little cubes out,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.650
all 162 of them,

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.811
and simply putting them directly into

00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:16.537
these raft boards that are made perfectly

00:05:16.537 --> 00:05:20.440
for those one inch by one inch cubes.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.540
Now when we put those in,

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:23.610
we'll fully stock this.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.260
This happens every single day

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.913
so that we're always keeping
this grow bed covered.

00:05:27.913 --> 00:05:30.808
If we were to leave an open
spot for more than a day,

00:05:30.808 --> 00:05:32.780
the nutrients in this water would

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:34.630
really ignite algae

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.310
and it would just grow
like the lettuce would.

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:39.280
It really grows in full force.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.340
It's a beautiful algae,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.945
I wish we could utilize it for something,

00:05:41.945 --> 00:05:44.800
but in our system it's not beneficial.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.075
It takes away from the nutrients

00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:48.985
that all the plants are trying to eat.

00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:52.290
So a little bit more about our process

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.489
of harvesting and ultimately packing

00:05:54.489 --> 00:05:57.673
before we get into the
science side of Aquaponics.

00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:00.407
So when we move these rafts
over to our clean area

00:06:00.407 --> 00:06:02.670
and we ultimately clean
all of that lettuce,

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.840
wrap the roots,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.710
we have to pack it and put
it in our cooler right away

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.040
to crisp it up.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.660
So we'll pack it in these trays

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:11.529
that we call our transfer trays.

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:14.200
Ultimately packing one variety

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.330
in each one of these trays,

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.314
giving us the ability to
pack all seven varieties

00:06:19.314 --> 00:06:20.970
with a couple of these

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.230
and keep them in our cooler to crisp up.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:24.970
Then it's time to pack our lettuce

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.010
and make our mixed cases.

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.270
So it'll be as easy as
doing one variety at a time,

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.800
laying out all boxes,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.460
and just putting the red
all in the ten boxes,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.050
then the green and then the red

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.790
and so that really keeps the lettuce

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:40.770
from being out in the heat for

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.720
an extended period of time.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.470
Everything will be fresh and crisp

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.402
in our 36 degree cooler space

00:06:46.402 --> 00:06:48.520
until it's ready to be packed.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.520
When they are packed,

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.930
we'll leave them on the other side

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:52.680
of the cooler stacked up

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.513
and we can fit about 150 boxes in there

00:06:55.513 --> 00:06:58.326
and every other day almost,

00:06:58.326 --> 00:07:00.820
Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays,

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.578
we have distribution companies come

00:07:02.578 --> 00:07:05.570
to our roll up door, pick up the product,

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.378
and ultimately distribute it out

00:07:07.378 --> 00:07:09.390
to our restaurant partners that

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:11.410
might be a little bit
further from our reach.

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:15.080
We do still keep a loyal
small customer base

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.474
of delivery routes that we personally do,

00:07:17.474 --> 00:07:19.522
but we limit those to a lot of the

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.049
restaurants in a very small area,

00:07:22.049 --> 00:07:24.210
but we do try and distribute out

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:26.480
and promote as many
restaurants that we work with

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.299
with the distribution partners as we can.

00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:30.978
So that's really the process

00:07:30.978 --> 00:07:34.881
of moving from seed to
harvest in our system

00:07:34.881 --> 00:07:36.742
and up next I think we're gonna really

00:07:36.742 --> 00:07:38.980
dive into the Aquaponics side

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.012
and what makes this product grow so well

00:07:41.012 --> 00:07:42.550
in this system

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.215
and ultimately the greenhouse that

00:07:44.215 --> 00:07:46.418
allows us to grow year round,

00:07:46.418 --> 00:07:48.350
creating a consistent product

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.491
and ultimately a great customer base.

00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:54.980
So now it's really time to
get into the Aquaponics side

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.194
and what makes us different than

00:07:56.194 --> 00:07:58.710
most traditional growers out there.

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:00.530
So the way that we grow all this fresh,

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.506
leafy green lettuce is a combination

00:08:03.506 --> 00:08:06.540
between two ecosystems in a growing

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.466
technique called Aquaponics.

00:08:08.466 --> 00:08:11.091
So the basic definition of Aquaponics

00:08:11.091 --> 00:08:14.065
is the combination between aquaculture,

00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:17.450
raising fish, our freshwater fish,

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:19.280
in a controlled environment

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.491
and hydroponics which is growing plants

00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:23.820
in a soil-less environment.

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:26.435
So we utilize both
ecosystems working together

00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:29.571
to simultaneously create the nutrients

00:08:29.571 --> 00:08:31.875
and ultimately remove the nutrients

00:08:31.875 --> 00:08:33.858
in the form of up taking

00:08:33.858 --> 00:08:36.786
and growing their beautiful
leafy green leaves.

00:08:36.786 --> 00:08:40.550
So starting first with
the fresh water fish,

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.950
specifically we use Blue Nile Tilapia

00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:45.922
and these tilapia come to us all male

00:08:45.922 --> 00:08:48.520
from a great breeder in New Mexico

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.940
called Americulture.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:52.834
We get them all male for three
really important reasons.

00:08:52.834 --> 00:08:55.380
First they create more waste as a male

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.469
versus a female to create
nutrients in our system.

00:08:58.469 --> 00:09:01.030
Second they grow much quicker as a male

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:02.350
versus a female.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:03.825
And third and most importantly,

00:09:03.825 --> 00:09:05.840
they don't reproduce.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.266
If they were to reproduce,

00:09:07.266 --> 00:09:09.492
we would be having tons and tons

00:09:09.492 --> 00:09:12.131
of small little spawn
get through the filters

00:09:12.131 --> 00:09:14.226
that we have at the bottom of these tanks,

00:09:14.226 --> 00:09:16.482
ultimately get into our filtration

00:09:16.482 --> 00:09:18.760
over on the rock media,

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.210
and if they were lucky enough,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.325
maybe even swim into our grow beds

00:09:22.325 --> 00:09:26.330
and become really, really
hungry vegetarians.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:27.620
They would eat all of our roots

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.890
until the point that we really

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:30.250
wouldn't have a product.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.870
Now there are some types of fish

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.637
that are beneficial in grow beds,

00:09:33.637 --> 00:09:35.778
but we really try and separate

00:09:35.778 --> 00:09:38.386
these two components the best we can.

00:09:38.386 --> 00:09:42.131
So these tilapia are the
real engine to our motor.

00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:46.030
They create that nutrient in
its raw form called ammonia

00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.554
and they create that my
excreting a waste product

00:09:49.554 --> 00:09:54.284
after we feed them every
day two to three times.

00:09:54.284 --> 00:09:56.620
So I'm about to feed these guys

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.730
and they're probably pretty hungry

00:09:57.730 --> 00:09:58.980
here in the summertime.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:00.530
In the winter they kinda slow down,

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:02.755
but in the summer they are full force,

00:10:02.755 --> 00:10:04.034
ready and hungry

00:10:04.034 --> 00:10:06.550
and creating that lean meat that

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:09.410
we really like to create
with these tilapia.

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:11.290
So we'll feed them real quick

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.133
and see if they're actually excited here.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.610
So as these tilapia eat that waste product

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:23.079
and ultimately create that waste product,

00:10:23.079 --> 00:10:25.820
it gets brought down by gravity

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:27.900
to the base of these fish tanks.

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:30.151
These tanks are equipped
with a conical base

00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.071
and that conical base can really help

00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:33.688
trap a lot of that solids

00:10:33.688 --> 00:10:36.583
and move it to a lower point in the system

00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:40.104
which is our next
filtration, our biofilters.

00:10:40.104 --> 00:10:42.700
These are a simple baffle system

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.568
that separates out the solids

00:10:44.568 --> 00:10:47.040
from the liquid ammonia,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.660
or broken apart ammonia.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:51.196
We can remove almost 50% of all the

00:10:51.196 --> 00:10:54.030
fish waste in those two tanks

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:55.940
and we flush that out once a week

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.470
to our compost beds,

00:10:57.470 --> 00:10:59.767
adding a really rich nutrient igniter

00:10:59.767 --> 00:11:02.055
in that compost bin.

00:11:02.055 --> 00:11:05.620
So after it removes its 50%,

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.860
that other 50% of that waste

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.660
heads down to our second filter

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.170
we like to call our living filter.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.810
This is an ebb and flow, flood and drain,

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:15.959
rock media bed

00:11:15.959 --> 00:11:19.240
that raises that water to a certain level

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.791
and then drains it out quickly

00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:24.310
creating aeration and
ultimately slowing down

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:26.920
the momentum of those
solid waste particles

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:29.050
so that they can be consumed by

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:32.071
naturally occurring
bacteria in the system.

00:11:32.071 --> 00:11:34.730
Not only do we have
naturally occurring bacteria

00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.551
helping us out creating that nutrient,

00:11:36.551 --> 00:11:39.053
every one of these beds is equipped

00:11:39.053 --> 00:11:43.659
with about four pounds of
these red wiggler worms.

00:11:43.659 --> 00:11:45.627
These red wiggler worms are a great

00:11:45.627 --> 00:11:49.360
little rumba in these media beds.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.303
They clean out any of the bigger particles

00:11:51.303 --> 00:11:52.800
that we might have

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:54.610
ultimately that might get clogged

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:56.759
in the smaller pipes in our system.

00:11:56.759 --> 00:11:59.903
They also excrete a supplemental
nutrient to the system,

00:11:59.903 --> 00:12:03.910
ultimately balancing out
these grow beds right here

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:07.110
so that the water passing
below this walkway

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:10.875
into our grow beds is
clean of any solid debris

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:13.700
and just really rich in ammonia

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:16.330
and hopefully really high in nitrates

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:18.295
which the plants can ultimately take up

00:12:18.295 --> 00:12:20.520
in the form of that nitrate

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.490
and remove it from the system

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:24.423
before that water flows directly back

00:12:24.423 --> 00:12:26.840
to the lowest point in our system

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.970
where we equipped a pump sending it

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.808
eight feet directly above so that

00:12:30.808 --> 00:12:33.690
we can have fresh water going directly

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:34.817
to those fish tanks

00:12:34.817 --> 00:12:37.850
creating a closed look, re-circulatory,

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:42.010
aquaculture system by the
scientific definition.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:44.120
So Aquaponics really allows you to

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.369
grow almost any type of vegetable

00:12:46.369 --> 00:12:48.780
or fruit that you really want to.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.865
You just have to adapt your system

00:12:50.865 --> 00:12:53.740
to accommodate for those
certain types of crops.

00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:55.347
Here we have deep water culture

00:12:55.347 --> 00:12:58.150
which allows us to really
grow a fast moving crop

00:12:58.150 --> 00:13:00.754
that doesn't need to stay
in these beds for too long.

00:13:00.754 --> 00:13:03.950
It also limits your growing abilities

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.610
in that deep water culture

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.552
to crops that might not
be a rooting vegetable

00:13:07.552 --> 00:13:10.021
or have a really dense amount of roots.

00:13:10.021 --> 00:13:13.460
So things like carrots,
beets, or radishes,

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.720
or even tomatoes that have to be vined up

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.930
and are really a long lasting crop

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.060
would be better suited in those media beds

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.693
that we just left on the
other side of the greenhouse.

00:13:22.693 --> 00:13:24.940
Now no matter what you're growing

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.374
or what type of environment
you really have or system,

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:31.340
you really have to control the weather.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.620
In this environment in Houston,

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.281
we're really hot and humid.

00:13:35.281 --> 00:13:39.050
It gets up into the 105, 110 degrees

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:41.025
with almost 100% humidity.

00:13:41.025 --> 00:13:43.137
So growing these products outdoors

00:13:43.137 --> 00:13:46.140
is really only limited to the springtime

00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.320
and early or late winter.

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.430
So having this greenhouse environment

00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:53.954
allows us to really trap
the heat in the winter

00:13:53.954 --> 00:13:56.722
and really cool this
place down in the summer

00:13:56.722 --> 00:13:59.580
utilizing a couple different components

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.110
throughout the greenhouse.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:03.300
Now all of these components are really

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.830
dictated through an
environmental control box

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.504
set with parameters as that
temperature raises or lowers,

00:14:09.504 --> 00:14:11.250
it will turn certain things on

00:14:11.250 --> 00:14:14.090
in accordance to that temperature gauge

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:15.850
so that we're not really always

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:18.033
having full force AC coming through here

00:14:18.033 --> 00:14:20.640
or we're blowing through our heaters.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:22.664
So all of those temperature readings

00:14:22.664 --> 00:14:25.770
are situated through a sensor hanging

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:26.823
throughout the greenhouse

00:14:26.823 --> 00:14:30.960
and a weather mass outdoors
in front of the front door.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:33.220
So those will come into that control box

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.552
and ultimately turn on the
various components that we have.

00:14:36.552 --> 00:14:38.327
Now first we'll talk about the winter.

00:14:38.327 --> 00:14:40.952
A little bit easier to
grow here in Houston.

00:14:40.952 --> 00:14:44.040
In the winter time we really don't have to

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.483
warm this place up too much.

00:14:45.483 --> 00:14:48.408
The only real concern is
getting the temperature

00:14:48.408 --> 00:14:51.340
in the water too cold for the tilapia.

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.050
If they get below 55 degrees,

00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:57.430
they're really prone and really
open to disease and death.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:59.788
So we create an ambient
temperature in here

00:14:59.788 --> 00:15:02.663
that's a little bit
higher than its threshold

00:15:02.663 --> 00:15:06.679
and we utilize these 200,000 BTU heaters

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:09.561
to turn on propane we engage

00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:11.900
so that we can only turn those on,

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.990
raise that temperature
just to that threshold,

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:15.330
and then they'll turn off

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.120
so that we're not wasting a lot of propane

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.649
or a lot of electricity doing that.

00:15:20.649 --> 00:15:23.353
So now getting into the
harder part of the year,

00:15:23.353 --> 00:15:26.281
our summertime is really hot here

00:15:26.281 --> 00:15:28.984
and so we really have
to control the weather

00:15:28.984 --> 00:15:31.785
to grow throughout the year all 12 months.

00:15:31.785 --> 00:15:34.665
And the way we do that is
a couple various components

00:15:34.665 --> 00:15:37.866
that create a wind tunnel
through this greenhouse.

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:40.630
So on the other side of the greenhouse,

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:41.817
we have exhaust fans.

00:15:41.817 --> 00:15:45.289
We have nine, four foot
by four foot exhaust fans

00:15:45.289 --> 00:15:48.810
that will turn on in the
morning of a hot day.

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:50.694
One by one as those turn on,

00:15:50.694 --> 00:15:53.593
a vent on the other
side of that brown wall

00:15:53.593 --> 00:15:56.185
gradually gets larger and larger.

00:15:56.185 --> 00:15:58.650
So now we're sucking that air from outside

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.962
through the greenhouse

00:15:59.962 --> 00:16:02.280
and out the top of the other side

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.560
creating almost a wind tunnel that

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.230
moves that humidity up
and out of the greenhouse.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:08.713
Now on a really hot day,

00:16:08.713 --> 00:16:11.566
we're really just sucking
hot air in from outside.

00:16:11.566 --> 00:16:14.870
So we have to add one
more layer to this system

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.640
to really cool it down to the threshold

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:19.660
that this lettuce can really thrive in

00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:22.409
and the way we do that
is drenching that entire

00:16:22.409 --> 00:16:25.931
brown wall from top to bottom reservoir

00:16:25.931 --> 00:16:28.169
and circulating that over and over again

00:16:28.169 --> 00:16:31.933
until all of those cooling
pads are drenched with water.

00:16:31.933 --> 00:16:35.230
Now that vent on the
other side is still open

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:37.545
and those exhaust fans are
still pulling that air,

00:16:37.545 --> 00:16:39.404
but now it comes in contact with

00:16:39.404 --> 00:16:41.913
a very thin stream of water,

00:16:41.913 --> 00:16:44.585
ultimately evaporating that water

00:16:44.585 --> 00:16:47.330
and cooling this temperature
in the greenhouse

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.160
down to about 90 degrees,

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.840
which is our upwards threshold

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:52.876
in the hottest days of the summertime.

00:16:52.876 --> 00:16:56.233
This allows us to really
grow the lettuce year round,

00:16:56.233 --> 00:16:59.340
but we are still limited in the summertime

00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:01.630
to harvesting and planting

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:05.130
to more early or late hours of the day.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.289
Some greenhouses will
incorporate shade cloth

00:17:07.289 --> 00:17:09.610
and that really is dependent on

00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:11.033
the crop variety that you have.

00:17:11.033 --> 00:17:13.270
We have ultimately decided not to

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:14.955
utilize shade cloth because this lettuce

00:17:14.955 --> 00:17:17.593
really needs as much sunlight as possible

00:17:17.593 --> 00:17:20.360
and through a lot of
years of trial and error,

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.770
we've just found out
that with our environment

00:17:22.770 --> 00:17:24.249
and our product and our system,

00:17:24.249 --> 00:17:26.028
shade cloth is not appropriate

00:17:26.028 --> 00:17:28.168
for what we're doing here.

00:17:28.168 --> 00:17:29.641
So that's really how we cool

00:17:29.641 --> 00:17:32.713
and heat this place up to
grow a product year round

00:17:32.713 --> 00:17:35.467
creating some consistency in the market

00:17:35.467 --> 00:17:37.530
and really boosting our credibility

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.009
to the chefs and the patrons
at our farmer's markets

00:17:40.009 --> 00:17:42.343
throughout Texas and Louisiana.

00:17:43.391 --> 00:17:46.640
So not only is this system sustainable,

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.980
but it's really efficient on labor.

00:17:48.980 --> 00:17:51.310
We've incorporated a very simple way

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.010
of harvesting, seeding, and planting

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.779
so that you can really minimize

00:17:55.779 --> 00:17:57.681
the expense of labor

00:17:57.681 --> 00:18:00.470
and really maximize your profits.

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:02.068
This entire greenhouse can be run

00:18:02.068 --> 00:18:05.150
with 7,000 heads of lettuce per week

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.040
with just two people operating it.

00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:10.399
So one efficiency here is planting

00:18:10.399 --> 00:18:12.831
and so these cubes that
we talked about earlier

00:18:12.831 --> 00:18:15.520
come in one inch by one inch square

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.580
coconut core and elastic polymer cubes.

00:18:19.580 --> 00:18:22.160
Now these guys are perfectly sized

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:25.696
to be put and placed into our grow boards.

00:18:25.696 --> 00:18:28.415
So by putting it on a bed of pegs,

00:18:28.415 --> 00:18:31.505
I can ultimately pop
all of these cubes out

00:18:31.505 --> 00:18:33.760
and very simply grab them,

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.410
maybe six at a time,

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.836
two by two if you're not so skilled,

00:18:36.836 --> 00:18:38.786
and start plugging away.

00:18:38.786 --> 00:18:40.608
So we'll start planting these

00:18:40.608 --> 00:18:42.790
and we go by variety

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:46.225
and we can really do about
four and a half trays

00:18:46.225 --> 00:18:50.580
or grow boards and rafts per cube tray.

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:54.464
And so we'll do about
four or five per cube tray

00:18:54.464 --> 00:18:57.960
and we really try and
time how much we harvest

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.970
to how many seeds we
have ready to go as well.

00:19:00.970 --> 00:19:04.000
So usually we'll have
excess seeds ready to go

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.950
so that if something bad happens

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:08.260
or if we harvest a lot of one variety,

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.340
let's say butter head
goes in really popular

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.750
for the Easter holiday

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.880
or for any kind of different holiday

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:15.830
at our farmer's market,

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.850
we might have gone through
a lot more of that,

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.640
we can ultimately have some back up

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.350
so that we're ready to put them

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:23.280
into our system when they need to.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.080
So when we put our first tray in

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.088
we always date and label that

00:19:27.088 --> 00:19:30.620
with the variety of lettuce

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:33.890
and ultimately the date that
we're putting it in here.

00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:35.748
We also have the date
that we germinated it

00:19:35.748 --> 00:19:38.448
and this all goes back
into those Google forms

00:19:38.448 --> 00:19:41.170
so that we can really track production

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:42.832
and see how many weeks it's taking us

00:19:42.832 --> 00:19:44.320
to get a head of lettuce

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:46.460
from the back of the grow bed

00:19:46.460 --> 00:19:48.624
all the way to the front of the grow bed.

00:19:48.624 --> 00:19:50.450
So as I mentioned earlier,

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:52.355
it's as easy as stacking them in the back

00:19:52.355 --> 00:19:55.792
and pushing them forward
to place this lettuce

00:19:55.792 --> 00:19:58.096
where its appropriate spot is.

00:19:58.096 --> 00:20:00.224
So we'll push those all the way forward,

00:20:00.224 --> 00:20:02.096
keep stacking these until this

00:20:02.096 --> 00:20:04.230
entire grow bed is full

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:06.770
and so that we have a
nice blanket of insulation

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.848
to keep that cool temperature in the water

00:20:08.848 --> 00:20:12.487
and limit the amount of
algae growth in this system.

00:20:12.487 --> 00:20:16.576
We do have a difference
between aqua and hydro

00:20:16.576 --> 00:20:20.176
and so aqua utilizes fresh water fish

00:20:20.176 --> 00:20:22.002
as our nutrient base.

00:20:22.002 --> 00:20:25.552
Hydroponic, like we have these
tomatoes growing right here,

00:20:25.552 --> 00:20:28.840
is actually solely chemical based

00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:31.105
or you add your soluble nutrients

00:20:31.105 --> 00:20:33.810
and ultimately distribute
them the same way

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:35.200
that you would do in Aquaponics,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.824
but it doesn't fully get recirculated

00:20:37.824 --> 00:20:40.944
and so you ultimately have to
keep adding those nutrients

00:20:40.944 --> 00:20:42.673
once every two weeks or so

00:20:42.673 --> 00:20:44.950
and keep draining that body of water

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:46.660
to replenish those nutrients

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.464
so it's not as sustainable.

00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:51.703
It's very difficult to
get organic for that

00:20:51.703 --> 00:20:54.970
and it is a very efficient

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:58.130
and future way of doing
it, much like this,

00:20:58.130 --> 00:21:01.090
but we ultimately like to utilize

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:03.792
the sustainability features of Aquaponics.

00:21:03.792 --> 00:21:06.449
LANDiO, LAND is OPPORTUNITY.

00:21:06.449 --> 00:21:09.032
(upbeat music)
