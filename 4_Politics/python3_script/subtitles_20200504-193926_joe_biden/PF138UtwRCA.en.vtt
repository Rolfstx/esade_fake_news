00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:05.850
so for me in essence a super house is
something that is beyond the everyday

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.960
you know we're very used to certain
conventional ways of living but clever

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.330
architects can interpret the sight the
brief the materials and they can deliver

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.280
it in a way that is quite it takes people
 beyond but in a beautiful way

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.060
and is very adaptive to their lifestyle we
did have a certain criteria around

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.520
around what we were looking for and
connection to nature was actually really

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.680
major and it does provide quite a thread
throughout the book and the exhibition

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.590
when you look at that that connection so
excite was very important this 360

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.559
delivery of form was very important a
great interior was important but also

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.719
that it had something to hook on to
conceptually so that might be an idea

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.030
that was delivered through technology or
through crafts and so it meant that it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.660
just had to have one central idea that
took it beyond the everyday

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.140
to me there are many things that would
make a house a super house that would

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.050
elevate it to that level and you know it
can be in in terms of the location the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.140
construction the elevation the
dimensions all of those things would

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.300
make a house a super house but for me
the really important element is the

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.290
emotional one I need to have that
emotional attachment to a house as well

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.240
it can tick all the boxes in terms of its
 construction and size and everything

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.789
but it needs to have an emotional appeal
to me as well a super house to me is

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.050
something that's actually able to stand
on its own two feet and really have its

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.860
own personality and its and demonstrate
this kind of clear thinking and it's

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.850
anything that really responds to the
brief the client the context and and and

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.350
create something that we haven't seen
before it's it's it's uniquely relevant

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.560
for that project to me is super house is
a architectural perfect storm it's got

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.070
everything going it's got the right
materials it's got the right sides got

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:24.450
the the right feel and I think most
importantly for me it challenges the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.519
conventions of how you think a house
should be and then once you get there

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.950
you go I don't yeah I get this I could
live here this is like the perfect space

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.269
it's the space where you go it's the
house that gives you envy I think the

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.590
most important thing is super house
should have is a place for all your old

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.230
junk so that you can chuck it all in
here and no one complains that it's in

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.769
the living space so this is what I love
the term super house I don't think has

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.780
anything really to do with the design of
a building I think through design houses

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.070
can be super as an outcome and we would
never sit down roll up our sleeves and

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:16.470
say let's make this one a super house I
think the super house is a combination

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:23.060
between a client their brief
and the architectural response to it

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.150
well I think what's great about the
houses in this exhibition is they just

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.010
take a different perspective on everyday
living and I think that's why people can

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.360
identify with it they can think oh I
could live like that or I couldn't you

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.090
know when I talk to young Bentham about
his tiny highs I said how did you deal

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.239
you know with children and staff and so
forth and and those are you know real

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.569
issues and but they were prepared to
live that way and I think it's that

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.620
creativity of approach and again the
openness to how things might be or could

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.920
be
that really helps push these concepts

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.680
forward and allows you to have something
that is personally super a house I

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.470
visited on Sydney's Northern Beaches
almost 16 years ago was probably my

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:19.410
first encounter with a super house it
was an extraordinary place designed by

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.050
the architect Richard Laplace 3a and set
back just from the beach hidden there

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.810
amongst the palms totally dictated by by
the weather and by the geography of the

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.910
area the house was just to me an
absolute gem and I have never forgotten

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.169
it I can remember sitting there in that
home as clearly today as if it was

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.010
yesterday
and it was just remarkable because it to

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.200
me represented a whole new way of living
and it was it was my entree into a whole

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.090
new continent and a whole new Hemisphere
and for me that was definitely a super

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:01.550
house my super house it's the sheets
Goldstein house by John Lautner and

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.570
Lorton are designed the house from
inside out and and and everything within

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.669
it so it was a complete package and kind
of sounds a little bit like a major

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.330
control freak moment but you know
everything the house itself including

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.330
all the furnishings and little
accessories are designed for it but it's

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.050
an amazing achievement you know back in
the 60s there probably weren't concern

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.710
with them with safety like we are now I
think I've seen some images of people

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.849
walking around and you know being able
to almost fall

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.289
you know to their mercy down into the
you know into the bush but we have to

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:37.249
navigate all of these rules and
regulations nowadays and still come up

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:39.860
with something extraordinary kind of
sucks

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.539
I think Lautner was probably a rock star
of architecture it was a bit of I don't

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:50.629
care I just want to make it cool so what
would be in my view a super house will

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:57.229
be over maize Bordeaux house and it is
you know the brief or I should decline

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:04.159
for the house is a paraplegic person and
his family and the unique nature of the

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.119
briefing it has necessitated the
architect that totally rethink how the

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:14.830
house is organized Horizonte and also
vertically and what I'm a did was to

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.990
design a very large four by four meter
platform which also acts as a room and

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.709
that platform is really a lift at the
same time that there's in the center of

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:29.209
the house and it totally by putting it
in the center powers it totally

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:32.930
structures the house around that lift
around that platform and in doing so

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:37.339
does reorganizes and we thinks what a
house in everything's a traditional

00:06:37.339 --> 00:06:43.490
house Dulli because of the unique nature
of the brief well I think that there are

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:48.769
so many incredible examples you know
around the world but the one the one

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:52.550
that I feel connected to you know super
houses for me

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:58.610
yeah are these traditional Island homes
built you know often by the occupant and

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:04.279
owner you know with very basic materials
that have been collected salvaged from

00:07:04.279 --> 00:07:10.399
the place itself often where they there
is the traces of hand at every level of

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:15.829
making where they've you know cobbled
the place together with with friends and

00:07:15.829 --> 00:07:21.919
family I think it's the fingerprints of
of a human endeavor or of activity of

00:07:21.919 --> 00:07:27.169
their and that those fingerprints or
traces are important because they reveal

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:33.499
authenticity it doesn't remove the story
the human story and narrative if I think

00:07:33.499 --> 00:07:37.639
places need to have a human story and
narrative and they need and that's how

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:41.390
we generate this kind of visceral
response to the things

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:46.560
it was very important to me that small
spaces had cut a role to play in this

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.940
exhibition as well because I think
that's the the way things are trending

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.930
and the ingenuity required from
architects to deliver something small

00:07:54.930 --> 00:08:00.690
and powerful it is a great example of
how the thinking is expressed and so in

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:04.200
in the exhibition we have we have
several great examples that are very

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:11.580
diverse so one is in Ireland and it's
the Golding summer house which is tiny

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:17.220
and was originally built really as a
sort of party house really as a dance

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:22.890
floor cantilevered over a river it it
did the winter is sort of a period of

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:27.930
ruin and is recently being been revamped
to have a more domesticated feeling that

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.640
it now has a you know a bedroom and a
small kitchen and bathroom but it

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:38.520
remains this kind of wonderful museum
pavilion suspended over over the river

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:44.099
in a way that it's very unusual in
Ireland particularly in that period and

00:08:44.099 --> 00:08:47.880
then on the other hand you have in a
very dense urban environment you have

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:53.910
Dominic alvaro small house which was a
tremendous global success and an

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:59.610
award-winning project and that was
taking a sort of almost unbuildable tiny

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:04.890
car park site and turn it turning it
into something through clever planning

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:10.620
and into something that was light filled
and and quite beautiful

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:16.170
yeah I mean we we've been looking in
Surry Hills and we found this particular

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.940
site it was a seven by six meter side
but it was in a laneway

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:26.970
it wasn't on the on a primary street and
it was also adjacent a 12-story office

00:09:26.970 --> 00:09:32.940
building and it was essentially an empty
car park for to two or three cars but at

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:39.360
the same time 7 by 6 meters whilst the
perception is that is actually small for

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.860
me I saw that as a key opportunity and
it did immediately upon visiting the

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:48.810
site was actually this is quite
substantial if you took a six by six by

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:55.260
six volume it's quite a substantial
volume and most living spaces in modern

00:09:55.260 --> 00:09:59.100
apartment buildings don't even get
anywhere near six metres my first

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:05.280
reading was well this is amazing this is
huge this is a big space I could really

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.110
manage this quite neatly and the fact
that I was surrounded by tall buildings

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.160
also gave me the confidence that
actually the height won't become an

00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.770
issue once you get elevated over the
second level it has an amazing view back

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:25.260
to back to the CBD that started to sit
where we might locate the living space

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.150
and then we had a living space and
entertainment and sleeping so that they

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:35.400
just become zones and so we thought well
we don't want the sleeping zone to be

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.050
elevated on the rooftop we want it to be
more of a sanctuary and more low down it

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:44.370
was really about getting that living and
entertainment elevated as high as we

00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:50.340
could because you move either up to the
roof terrace or down to a living space

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:55.620
or the kitchen then became this sort of
hub between the three living spaces so

00:10:55.620 --> 00:10:59.820
actually low down it's quite solid the
house sits there punched windows it's

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:05.070
quite protective it is this idea of a
sanctuary let you go into this concrete

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:11.640
bunker and inside is this sanctuary of
of your home in the city and then as you

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:16.320
move out from the lower levels it just
opens up to being very light very

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.709
spacious the ambient daylight was
tastic we actually built the house in

00:11:20.709 --> 00:11:25.600
four days because of the small footprint
because of the repetition we built

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.279
off-site we fabricated everything
off-site we assembled it all on-site

00:11:30.279 --> 00:11:36.519
proofing prefabricated so it was you
know lift one two three four and the

00:11:36.519 --> 00:11:42.190
entire house was built yeah you have to
close the road and that's expensive but

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:46.570
you're only doing there four times so we
delivered a building for the cost of an

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:52.269
apartment and delivered the finishes and
all of the the value adds that I wanted

00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:58.510
in in the project so it works really
hard this more like it works very hard

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:06.910
on many levels and I think that's what
makes it a super house it's not so much

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:11.380
the super houses is super in terms of
Bhrigu impressive it's about does it

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:17.620
work for my life and Canada adapt to my
changing life so I might you know have

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:22.209
kids or kids might leave or I might feel
like it at certain times I'm working a

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:27.699
lot from home or we're out of home a lot
so you know can it expand and contract

00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:34.360
with me as my as my life continues so
that is something that adaptable home

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:38.290
and that home that really suits the kind
of life I I want to leave that's a super

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:48.940
house the trunk house is located in a
forest in the central highlands of

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.860
Victoria it's just stringing back
forests so there's almost no ground

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.690
cover it's just just the trees you know
quite a you know very under present

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:05.380
canopy as well but I guess from the
outset ourselves architects and the

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:11.769
clients were keen to integrate the house
into the context of the forest so that

00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:19.630
at certain points the structure of the
house is almost a confusion or a

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.610
blurring between the structure of the
house and

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:29.959
the trucks in the forest with the
engineer pedophilic Shetty we came

00:13:29.959 --> 00:13:38.269
across the idea of using the tree trunks
of our vacations to act as supporting

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:45.350
members for the house I mean it's the
kind of project where we really needed

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:51.709
the right engineer and the right builder
and the right craftsman become sculptor

00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:56.450
to put the bifurcations together you
don't want it to look too rustic

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:02.839
you know - kitsch so you get someone
with the skill to be able to to work

00:14:02.839 --> 00:14:09.320
these bifurcations and join the tops and
the columns which have different

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:18.440
diameters and cross-sections to join
them so it looks like a fluid form takes

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:23.690
a lot of skill and time the house is
basically you know one giant trusts so

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:29.570
it's very strong even though the the men
was a you know they're only about that

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:35.750
that diameter they're quite thin but but
very strong it's a very small house

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:41.089
that's the size of an apartment
basically because it's a weekend but we

00:14:41.089 --> 00:14:47.029
don't tend to see that as a limitation
in the interior and living areas that

00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:55.190
it's all timber and that was even a
conscious affect the timber lining

00:14:55.190 --> 00:15:01.940
internally on the living room walls is
stringy bug so when the trees were

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:06.560
removed to make way for the house
construction it was a milling machine

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:12.040
that came on site milled down those
stringy back trees that were removed

00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.270
those boards were seasoned over about
eight months or so

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:23.600
they weren't exactly sure what kind of
figuration would get more grain after

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.580
they've been milled but we were really
pleased because the grain has a lot of

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:36.740
character so to apply the term super
house to the trunk house for me is about

00:15:36.740 --> 00:15:44.510
the idea that this house is about going
into a forest and developing a concept

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:52.970
in this case using bifurcations using
forms in the ecology in a very primary

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.910
sense to create the concept of the house

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:11.390
well you know the first time I looked
the site up it was some it was like sort

00:16:11.390 --> 00:16:15.170
of going into God's country it's looks
like this I haven't really been to any

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:18.260
other places like that before
so you sort of enter the valley and you

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.470
really feel like you're in this
incredibly secluded area and you also

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:24.830
feel like you're in a very it's not only
sort of more inspiring its beauty but

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:29.060
you've got the its flanked by two large
mountain ranges so you really feel like

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.750
you're very safe and secure and on the
side there's a creek that runs through

00:16:32.750 --> 00:16:36.560
the site and so one of the very
important parts of the brief was that

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:41.930
the house had to be sited near the creek
we oriented the house along the axis

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:45.050
that along the axis of the mountains
because it was formed such a strong line

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:49.400
it was very hard to ignore it so that
that became the sort of access for the

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:54.680
whole design and we had to incorporate
to sort of stone cottages that were part

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:59.000
of the sort of history of the site and
apparently they'd been Bushrangers in

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.860
the area that had hidden out quite a
famous bushranger was there so we kind

00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:07.670
of felt it was very important to
maintain the cottages as as part of the

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:12.320
house I'm sort of very fascinated with
the idea of grafting so the idea of

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:17.060
grafting in in Japanese gardens where
they there's an existing sort of tree

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:22.070
and they might sort of chop it all
they'll alter it in some way or they

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:26.600
might add another piece to it and so the
new piece becomes part of almost part of

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:32.150
the whole so you wouldn't really know
so that that approach was taken so that

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:38.750
the the new part of the house sort of
almost becomes part of the old part so

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:43.580
that the two cottages are sort of framed
by by the new house but they become like

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:49.010
sort of these jewel like sort of special
kind of parts of the house there's quite

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:54.950
deep overhangs on the roofs that's
really protecting you and from rain and

00:17:54.950 --> 00:18:00.710
some sort of shelter the roof of the
house is angled so that they perfectly

00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:04.280
frame the mountain range so you sort of
see the whole top of the mountain range

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:09.200
see so it's not cut off halfway there
sort of angling right up so that you

00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:15.620
sort of see the whole mountain range the
new materials we still wanted to use

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:19.460
something that was almost part of the
site as well so even though it's a light

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.090
material we used iron bark which is a
reference to a lot there's a lot of iron

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:26.450
bark trees in the area rough sawn iron
bark

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:31.490
it's used externally everything inside
the house is very sort of smooth and

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:36.110
jewel-like
and we've used black but ply along the

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:40.520
bedroom wing there's also a bit of
rammed earth that we used in the house

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.290
so we've used sort of local earth and
did lots of experimentation with

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:48.560
different types of rammed earth walls
and the colour kind of it's quite

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.740
related to the colour of the earth yeah
we've also used brass mesh on all the

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:59.030
outside sort of deck areas which give
you protection from the mosquitoes and

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:03.020
the insects and flies and that sort of
thing but also enable you to look

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:07.040
outside sort of almost like you're in
your own little world but you can look

00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.600
out but you don't really feel like
you're you're being observed yourself

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:17.270
the surroundings become the thing that
you really look at rather than the

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:21.410
inside of the house it's almost like a
sort of frame for looking for looking at

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:26.360
the outside so the house itself has is
quite zen-like and quite has a sort of

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.930
sense of calm
it was just great working on a project

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:35.540
where you're in such a fabulous place
it's quite a privilege to be able to

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.770
design something that is really sort of
particular than that area are in very

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.900
special better and
becomes part of the area so I think

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:52.890
that's quite a great opportunity for an
architect so we know that humans and you

00:19:52.890 --> 00:20:00.780
know you know respond to places and I
think super houses are these places that

00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:05.160
we immediately feel a visceral response
to we don't necessarily always know why

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:10.740
we might think it's because of concrete
or the way that a circulation space

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:16.500
works or an incredibly crafted material
but there are other aspects that are

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:23.880
less obvious but you know as critical in
terms of building a sensibility and the

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:35.400
feeling of comfort within a space I was
on the Croft house which is near Phillip

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:40.890
Island in Victoria it's on a pre exposed
part of coastline and faces east so the

00:20:40.890 --> 00:20:45.780
winds blow offshore there which makes it
a bit easy because you can just face the

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:52.049
view and have the wing behind you where
I came about was I was there for three

00:20:52.049 --> 00:20:57.990
days and I didn't mind being
embarrassing myself by walking like an

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:04.169
idiot walking around and looking
confused so I pretty much just did that

00:21:04.169 --> 00:21:07.500
and I knew that I was there with the
owners and we were staying there in the

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:16.080
old place that was there and and I knew
they were worried healthy but on the

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:24.360
third day looking silly and wandering
around thinking I realised that a very

00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.950
unique thing was happening there with a
weather Trey's world bending towards the

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:33.600
ocean so the wind was coming from behind
and so a scheme really needed to put its

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:41.210
jacket up to the collar up to the wind
and protect itself in that way the idea

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:46.970
of a courtyard house was a pretty good
model because you could make a protected

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:53.559
place and so there was a few experiments
of can I do a courtyard house that

00:21:53.559 --> 00:21:58.510
doesn't have redundant space in long
corridors doesn't have the double-headed

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:02.330
blinkers because the courtyard houses
give me this

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:07.880
you know shuts off all of that can i
tape it off and just make it disappear

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:11.899
hollow out the ends you know maybe a
bathroom would work well in the end sure

00:22:11.899 --> 00:22:20.210
enough did work well so I understand
that it seems that this is a complete

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:26.750
thing that's been placed and then the
owners have had to somehow find a way of

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:33.529
living in this form but it didn't evolve
that way I mean sure enough as that

00:22:33.529 --> 00:22:39.020
shape evolved there was long bananas
washed up kind of sea cucumbers there

00:22:39.020 --> 00:22:51.440
was you know until it was practically it
started as a exercising passive solar

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:56.809
Shore and the owners don't use in
heating or any cool and that works by

00:22:56.809 --> 00:23:04.490
having a lot of thermal mass furthermore
inertia and well insulated and I think

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:09.710
the form probably does a little bit for
windchill these forms probably do a lot

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:13.940
to shoot the breeze over and not really
take the heat out of the building and

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.049
that was part of the looking at the
Croft house of hundreds you know

00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:24.770
Croft houses on the north of Scotland
and ground-hugging things so this

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:29.419
landscape is evolving in a certain way
with erosion the gel and geology

00:23:29.419 --> 00:23:34.520
fertility of the ground winds and rain
so what if this architecture was to look

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:41.299
at these natural systems and try and
work in with them and to have them

00:23:41.299 --> 00:23:47.990
generate the architecture so I super has
to me steps

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:55.660
away from convention and in a way it's
almost endemic it's evolved in a place

00:23:55.660 --> 00:24:02.480
those kind of qualities I think we all
innately really enjoy because if we go

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.170
traveling
it's those look at how these guys are

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:11.570
living here you know that kind of
uniqueness and it's not to say that

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:16.220
generic modernism isn't exciting - and
doesn't have a role to play but me

00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:25.370
personally interested in how it's
twisted and evolved and part of a system

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:30.580
of a place culturally and physically

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:40.850
look I think contemporary design is is
very respectful now towards tradition

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.110
and towards the past and nothing excites
me more than when I see a project come

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.000
across my desk of a beautiful old house
that has been very sympathetically

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.750
restored with a modern extension I like
the journey that that can take you on

00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:00.050
through the home and I actually do like
it very much when there are two distinct

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:04.910
halves to the house where the the old
hat the old half the traditional half

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:08.720
has its own distinct personality and
then you sort of cross the threshold

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.190
into the contemporary but it's done in a
seamless way and it's done in a

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:20.780
respectful way that really respects the
heritage of the original home we

00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:24.320
suffered the design of the scholar house
in 2009

00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:28.130
it's a terrace house which is located in
in Balmain and the inner-city fabric in

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:33.980
Sydney is pretty well intact and I think
it's important to remain tane the the

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:37.070
front facade
especially when they've formed out of a

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:40.230
continuation of a row terraces I think
that's very very important

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:44.070
and not ain't it not only to maintain
the the tourist hospice art but also the

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:49.590
form of the other more the main body of
the terrace house I think you know that

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:54.740
that's very very important because what
we were interested in is a counterpoint

00:25:54.740 --> 00:26:01.560
between in a traditional form the
traditional facade and how that

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.770
counterpoints or how that is juxtaposed
against aid we're not quite a

00:26:04.770 --> 00:26:09.360
contemporary interior what we decided to
do was to invert the terrace house

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:13.170
traditionally in the two-story
terrorists you know here you have the

00:26:13.170 --> 00:26:16.980
living rooms on the ground floor and the
bedrooms on the top floor and we

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:20.790
basically flipped that we put the living
rooms on the top floor many to take

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.690
advantage of the views towards
Parramatta River toward the front of the

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:29.640
house and also to take advantage of the
sculptural reforms you know sort of

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:35.550
sculptural skylights most terrace houses
you don't see the sky because you're

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:38.670
bounders had built up you know houses
built up along the boundary so that's

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:43.770
quite a rare experience so we wondered
we wanted to be able to see the sky that

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:47.490
was very important and our general
approach you know during the design

00:26:47.490 --> 00:26:51.090
process was to really look at the
housing section rather than the plan

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.120
because it's all about the light coming
down to the top is all about the

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.880
vertical circulation as the living rooms
from the top floor rather than the

00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.530
ground floor so as you interfere the
front door you enter into a three storey

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:06.000
high space you know poppy apply the
skylights and then you rise up the

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.330
flight of stairs and as you reach the
top of the stairs with the living room

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:15.420
ease your your adjacent to a lovely tree
in your mother the courtyard so and

00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.280
that's very sort of different from a
traditional terraced house experience

00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.880
you know the scar lie isn't just a
simple device which allows light to come

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.310
in
it's a volumetric device which are

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:30.340
beliefs and sculpts the space at the
same time

00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:34.899
and by placing a sheet of glass on the
outside the opening you eliminate the

00:27:34.899 --> 00:27:39.129
frame so the frame doesn't interrupt the
view between the the inside and the

00:27:39.129 --> 00:27:45.309
outside so in our case what we were able
to do by limiting it frame you get the

00:27:45.309 --> 00:27:51.129
the white roof forms juxtaposed against
the blue sky so the experience is it's

00:27:51.129 --> 00:27:55.269
quite surreal you can only achieve that
through the detailing by placing the

00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:58.989
painted glass on the outside of the
opening you know I'm most happy with the

00:27:58.989 --> 00:28:05.999
way the life end of the house and
secondly I'm very happy with the way we

00:28:05.999 --> 00:28:10.419
engage with the urban fabric and we
respected the additional terrace house

00:28:10.419 --> 00:28:15.369
for money and the facade by the same
time we've introduced continuous phases

00:28:15.369 --> 00:28:21.219
within the house so is that some
adjusted position which were most happy

00:28:21.219 --> 00:28:29.679
we have also
I was recently lucky enough to go to

00:28:29.679 --> 00:28:35.139
Richard Rogers house in Chelsea in
London and talking about super houses it

00:28:35.139 --> 00:28:39.129
was extraordinary absolutely
extraordinary and it's a great architect

00:28:39.129 --> 00:28:44.200
and this home represents everything that
he's ever done and you walk up to it and

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.789
it looks like a typical Georgian house
and then you open the door it's splashes

00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:56.019
of color and so behind it is this
enormous triple space white room super a

00:28:56.019 --> 00:29:03.820
per plant open planned but super livable
and I think that respect from nod to the

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:08.820
past that's what makes it bring it
because you don't know what to expect

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:14.469
he's a big name of international
architecture and he said bitties own

00:29:14.469 --> 00:29:23.379
home that isn't cozy in any way but yet
it is cozy because somehow his talent is

00:29:23.379 --> 00:29:29.379
to make cavernous spaces full of glass
and steel and white walls feel like you

00:29:29.379 --> 00:29:36.059
could happily live there and read a
paper and feel on top of the world

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:40.980
I'm gonna talk a little bit about
concrete because I'm obsessed with it

00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:46.980
there there is something about concrete
in terms of its transgression as a

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:51.000
natural material and as a man-made
material but it's a capacity to sculpt

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.809
and form its imperfection it's one of
those things that has a reach level of

00:29:57.809 --> 00:30:04.110
patina and there is something about that
tactility of materials I mean concrete

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:10.950
but also worn you know timber that grows
over time or mild steel that begins to

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.070
rust
it tells an authentic story it tells a

00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:20.309
story of you know of things our
activities evolving over time it's not

00:30:20.309 --> 00:30:26.309
looking to and begin to transparent it
tells you the truth about what it is

00:30:26.309 --> 00:30:31.830
even precast panels in that are you know
formed up in factories will all have

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:36.840
their own level of you know of patina
and history and narrative and story in a

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:42.470
steady much like the fingerprints of
humans

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:50.410
I guess the provocation of this project
for us was that the client have lived on

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:56.410
this site for many years I think 25
years we felt there was an opportunity

00:30:56.410 --> 00:31:01.480
to provide the client into doing a house
that was much more suited to the

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.080
collection of art that they had a
substantial collection of art we

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:08.740
challenged them or provoked them into
thinking about what we could do what we

00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.700
could achieve if we started again on
this site and as a little bonus the

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:18.250
house next door came up for sale and so
we suggested that it might be a nice

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:24.100
idea to purchase that and instead of a
going for the usual ridiculous idea of a

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:29.020
tennis court that we actually reach a
house across two sites so that was that

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:34.710
was the start of this project for us yes
I guess there are a couple of major

00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:38.470
conceptive driving forces and the site
itself is one of them because it's

00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:41.740
actually almost honor honor on a cliff
it's very steep site we knew we had to

00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:46.420
have something that would step down the
site but we wanted the building to

00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:50.170
really contribute to the surroundings
and anything it's in a context of a lot

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:53.920
of very large very nice houses but
they're all very nice as when you're

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.730
inside the house and all they do to the
street is create a blank wall and we've

00:31:57.730 --> 00:32:00.550
set out to really do something a lot
more sculptural that could really

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:07.090
contribute back to the street we wanted
to I guess create a sculpture that was

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:13.570
livable very important for our clients
that this was not an art gallery it was

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:19.510
a home so in a sense we wanted Pauline I
wanted to create the scholar in the

00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:24.270
landscape and then show the clients how
we can make

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:30.720
we looked at many different artists we
loved the goo she was one of them and

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:36.750
against Noguchi for us had sculpture
that was linked and connected and

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:45.630
created voids and for us just beauty so
you know looking at the Noguchi and we

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:49.350
started off with this original idea
about you know when you try and step

00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:54.690
something down it starts to create these
holes and volumes and that actually was

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:58.290
more about not so much even what we were
building but the spaces we were creating

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:02.790
we started to shift things around to get
things to functionally work and get the

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:05.610
towels and things to work and then
finally and it was really out of

00:33:05.610 --> 00:33:11.040
responding both to the brief the sun the
privacy or all those are the things that

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:14.430
make an actual house turn something from
a sculptor to a house responding to all

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:19.020
those elements is what ended up getting
us a sort of final formed twisted for

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:23.670
the Sun and twisted for the headland
view and functionally fitted all the

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:33.600
different pieces in it so yeah I made a
client happy but very important when we

00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.450
put the notion to them that the house
could actually also be a sculpture

00:33:36.450 --> 00:33:41.520
itself in the landscape and really
contribute that they were excited by

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.330
that idea I don't know how many clients
would be so that's true it's true credit

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:49.260
to them fantastic that they they took it
on they had the courage to do that then

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:55.380
I think people don't read this as as a
house necessarily they're looking beyond

00:33:55.380 --> 00:33:58.530
it and they're looking around it as a
sculpture but even when you come inside

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:03.960
the house and again Kali talks about the
obsession with you when you come into

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:07.620
this house you don't see with you and it
was we were very adamant that you

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.510
wouldn't just have that typical open the
door huh you so they actually I blocked

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:17.360
of you
and turning turning Carol now : that

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.040
walk Clinton's walk right I think it's
history so how could you do this we've

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.460
got this beautiful view and you walk
into this house and you put a wall in

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:32.330
the way but of course the viewers
revealed URL so just this tiny slice

00:34:32.330 --> 00:34:39.140
them that sends you long but it's not
the big well the the choice of concrete

00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:44.770
was fairly simple really because we
needed a material that you would read as

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:52.460
sculptural so roof and wall and ceiling
and and surfeit it all had to be the

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.060
same material now course concrete is
perfect for them because you form it up

00:34:56.060 --> 00:35:01.010
in those shapes there's a real strength
and solidity to it and yet there's a

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:06.200
delicacy around it as well so the way
the glass slides into the concrete even

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:12.200
the detailing of the balustrade is this
great contrast between the robust nature

00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:18.380
of the material and the delicacy of
certain elements and with with the out

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:22.930
because the art is spectacular

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:31.660
primarily cubist realism in his contrast
with this really robust building so I

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:37.530
think it is audacious to do a house like
this in this location in Sydney and then

00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:43.000
we were given an award a local council
award for this house for the

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.870
contribution to the built environment
now that is amazing because my second

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:54.520
said let's be honest when we bring our
first meetings with the client regarding

00:35:54.520 --> 00:36:02.080
our design we weren't particularly
positive about how this might be

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.930
received at council so we had to say to
our client look baby steps here because

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:13.630
we might fall over the first hurdle but
the house was embraced by the planners

00:36:13.630 --> 00:36:19.810
from day one and we had no problem with
approval and here it is an audacious

00:36:19.810 --> 00:36:31.870
house for this part of the world
official concrete is great because as I

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:36.250
get older I realize maintenance is
always an issue so you build a concrete

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:42.220
house and you choose not to paint it all
you got to do is hose it and I see I see

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:50.200
so much beauty in concrete and why is
that those great brutalist buildings

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:55.240
that I grew up with so you know schools
were brutalist the cinema was brutalist

00:36:55.240 --> 00:37:01.630
my university was brutalist and so it
there's a real nostalgic feel Paul for

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:05.620
me for Brutalism and then oh if I see it
in a domestic setting I don't have a

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:09.700
problem with it but I don't know I'm a
modernist so there's there's no way I'm

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:13.810
not gonna subscribe to the fact that you
can live in a concrete box with glass

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:19.260
windows and you know there's some soft
furnishings salts everything

00:37:22.339 --> 00:37:31.859
Linda's house was conceived to be part
of a very ancient landscape and the

00:37:31.859 --> 00:37:39.569
Victorian coastline is typify die
secondary and tertiary June systems that

00:37:39.569 --> 00:37:47.700
give a undulation and a soft roll to the
landscape and we wanted the house to be

00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:52.829
part of that not to reflect it but to be
part of that landscape and in fact go

00:37:52.829 --> 00:38:01.410
further and appear as if it was built
millions of years ago covered over and

00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:06.990
then eroded away and exposed like it had
been part of a Skeletor remain of an

00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:16.829
ancient marine creature the brief for
this house was quite an open idea there

00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:21.750
were some pragmatic things about the
number of bedrooms etc that they use it

00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:26.640
as a beach house but it's more than a
beach house for them the house is more

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:33.619
of a vehicle for them to use as a family
but also to use with extended family and

00:38:33.619 --> 00:38:41.130
friends so it's more of a sanctuary or a
haven for them to come down and have the

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:48.809
opportunity to be alone or with a large
group of people the the design of the

00:38:48.809 --> 00:38:53.910
house is based on to a degree a sense of
mystery so on arrival there's a blank

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:59.339
wall and a door in it which is a bit
like a small proscenium arch in a

00:38:59.339 --> 00:39:06.319
theatre and when you draw the curtains
or open the door it exposes you to a

00:39:06.319 --> 00:39:12.420
magnificent view so there is kind of an
excitement attached to that a quiet

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:17.609
excitement on the Victorian coastline
where the view is is usually where the

00:39:17.609 --> 00:39:23.400
weather comes from so we've provided
North facing courtyards that are

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.789
protected from the southerly weather
where the swimming pool is for example

00:39:26.789 --> 00:39:31.320
so there are all different places that
you go to around the house

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:38.190
depending on climate and also that
facilitates a sense of Zoning throughout

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:43.770
the house so everyone's got privacy so
it's effectively or like to boomerang

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:50.520
shapes with a little zipper of glass
between us that gives people aspect and

00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:55.440
view without others being able to look
look at them through the design of a

00:39:55.440 --> 00:40:00.090
house like this you simply can't see
from one end to the other there's

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:05.760
mystery that activates your engagement
with the house so the visceral quality

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:12.810
of the body in the building is part of
that mystery so that you can't

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:17.700
necessarily know what the plan of the
buildings like you actually have to be

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:23.910
active in seeking that out and moving
through the building because of the

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:30.210
curves within the building and the
timber beading we can disguise drawers

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:37.440
so you just see the shape of the wall in
a series of handles but you don't see a

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:43.140
wall with a frame with a door in it so
the sculpted form is highlighted by the

00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:50.870
use of materials I think there are
dramatic moments in this house and

00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:57.840
things like the stair to the upstairs
bedroom could be you know there could be

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:04.320
a bit of Gone with the Wind in that the
bathrooms are quite brightly colored

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:07.860
they were meant to be dual like there
was meant to be a touch of Hollywood

00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:13.590
maybe on the Victorian coastline I mean
I walked into the bathrooms and oh I

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:17.550
smile and I see them because there's
something there is something kind of

00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:22.880
luscious about them but the materiality
is quite simple

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:30.410
the scale of the building is based on a
range of activities and sometimes times

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:36.740
our client like just the two of them
might come down and so there's intimate

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:44.030
cave-like areas where they can retreat
to and feel like they're in an intimate

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:52.940
space and also their children have their
own private area so they can retire to

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:57.290
that and they can have their friends
down and go crazy in another part of the

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:02.420
house while other things are happening
elsewhere and then there's more space if

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.580
other families are down here so it's
designed so that if you are here alone

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:11.840
you don't feel like you're rattling
around the house there are spaces to go

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:20.990
that you always feel comfortable in the
materiality of the building does make

00:42:20.990 --> 00:42:26.720
some reference to bleach driftwood or or
old whale bones

00:42:26.720 --> 00:42:32.960
but also it's in a monochromatic palette
which is what our work is about every

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:39.260
time of day it looks slightly different
I think the house still looks quite

00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:45.340
fresh and there's a timelessness about
it which is embedded in our work we

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:52.400
we're not architects that respond to
style or decoration on a building the

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:56.510
building is what it is it's a sculptural
form and they're designed to look better

00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:04.790
as I get older I mean if we had to drill
down a super house just to three things

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:08.840
my one of my most important would still
be that the connection to site and

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.830
connection to nature because that just
brings something the other quality

00:43:12.830 --> 00:43:17.330
that's not always possible if you're in
an urban environment and then I would

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:23.540
say it was the the management of light
because in a way that can still draw in

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:29.420
the experience of nature even in in
somewhere that it is more urban and the

00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:35.300
third one I think is is that kind of
indefinable quality of poetry or

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:39.020
something that actually when you go into
a space gives you an uplifting feeling

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:43.099
because that was another aspect that was
very important these places should have

00:43:43.099 --> 00:43:49.550
a quality that is all inspiring and just
to capture something that makes you feel

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:54.260
different and I think if you if
architects succeed in doing that they've

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.760
really really done their job

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:11.290
and then on that concrete house miss
Eddie house I mean that's got yeah give

00:44:11.290 --> 00:44:18.190
me that now I don't care whether the
children hurt themselves I just think

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:21.270
it's just extraordinary

00:44:25.260 --> 00:44:35.579
give me time so every day beautiful
beautiful basil
