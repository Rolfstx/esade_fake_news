00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:16.120
 Dr. Fenwick ... You're a neuropsychiatrist. And you are an expert in near-death experiences 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.620
 and the phenomena accompanying the end of life. 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.320
 Before I ask you, what is a neuropsychiatrist? 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.240
 I'm a neuropsychiatrist. And that means I'm educated in neurology and psychiatry. 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:39.140
 And I've been doing it for many years, but it's the perfect position because you move between the brain and the mind. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.160
 So you see into both of these branches and you can understand them better than if you were just a psychiatrist or a neurologist. 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.340
 What was your daily job? 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:58.540
 My daily job was to take care of people with brain damage and the psychological problems that result from this damage. 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.880
 So I was struggling with epilepsy and had a large number of patients with seizures 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.100
 they had disorders of consciousness of various types 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.000
 so epilepsy could be used as a model of how the brain works and it was great 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.240
 but in my research they were very diverse. With an interest in sleep, 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.080
 with interest when the equipment for monitoring the brain structure came along 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.020
 But first I was interested in electrical activity in the brain. 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:39.580
 EEG and in fact one of the first articles I wrote was about George Harrison 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.920
 Remember George Harrison of the Beatles? 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.480
 He kindly stepped in all this and I did his EEG 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.340
 when he meditated because he was behind the Maharishi 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.080
 So he was one of the first EEG recordings in meditation I made. 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.200
 so that also then became one of my interests, ie meditation .. a 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.380
 near death unusual spiritual experiences that I studied 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.460
 and then I became interested in near-death experiences 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.160
 and that then led to an interest in dying and how we die. 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.420
 In a broad sense, what can we learn from these scans? 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.220
 So how neuropsychiatry can help us understand people. 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.360
 Actually, very well, because you can see both sides of the picture. You can understand what's going on in their brain 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:40.180
 you can understand what is going on in their minds, so you really have a very close relationship between these two things 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:48.980
 But, it also leads you directly to the fundamental question of all time and that is: What is consciousness? 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:55.860
 Is it all brain? Is it something out of the brain? William James (a well-known psychologist) many years ago at the turn of the century 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.300
 He said that consciousness is beyond the brain and the brain fills it, as many people have since 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:12.720
 And there are others, and the mainstream of modern science ignores this and says no, it's all brain function 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.900
 and my view is that it's very limited and I don't think it's true for a minute 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.960
 How you got to near death experiences. 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.480
 I thought near-death experiences were nonsense, complete nonsense. 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:33.520
 They only went to California and never crossed the Atlantic. I knew it and I said it. 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.880
 When was it? That was sometime between 1978 and 1980. 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.300
 Until someone showed up in my office who had an experience close to death. 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.640
 He had a cardiac catheter in one of our hospitals in London. 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.380
 The operation failed and he left his body during it, 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.900
 he watched his resuscitation and then had a classic near-death experience. 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.740
 So thanks to this example, I was able to study them. 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.500
 And I came to the conclusion that they really are happening and have a lot to teach us. 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.060
 So I changed my attitude from nonsense to very interesting. 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.840
 How did you study these phenomena? 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.100
 First, I took the individual cases that came to my hands 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.640
 and I looked at them in terms of what people had experienced. 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:39.420
 and I compiled several studies, some I was allowed to do and some not. 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.300
 For example, in one of the hospitals, I wanted to study people in an intensive care unit. 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.080
 and find out if they have near-death experiences during their stay 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.100
 and when I presented this to the hospital's ethics committee 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.120
 the man who ran the intensive care unit said: 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.820
 None of my patients will have such experiences, it's a waste of time. 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.680
 So I couldn't do this study. 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:11.520
 So I set out on a different path, studying the experiences that people had. 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.760
 And I've been very lucky since '87 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.140
 I made a TV documentary in this country 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.400
 and thanks to that we received 2 thousand letters 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:30.420
 letters, things to open, not email. So we got 2,000 of them. 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.400
 And that gave us a huge database 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.460
 So I took the best, most relevant ZBS 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.020
 and we sent out questionnaires to 500 of them 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.100
 and from that came a sample. And from that, I learned a bite of important things. 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:52.900
 First, the sample will never be repeated 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.760
 because 98% 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.120
 they didn't know about ZBS when they had ZBS. 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.000
 so it automatically eliminates suggestions and things like that. 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.540
 So it was very different. 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.780
 Another thing I learned was that when you look at what caused ZBS 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.780
 You will find that it was a very, very wide circuit 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.600
 from cardiac arrest 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.040
 after childbirth. 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.200
 diseases, and things much more different than this. 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:31.440
 and eventually you will come to people sitting in front of your (? far?) one evening 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.460
 and they have near-death experiences, they have all the symptoms 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.600
 and when they completed any rating scales, they were evaluated as 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.060
 near-death experiences. So I understood that they are common in our society. 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.200
 and the fact that they were only associated 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.460
 With things like cardiac arrest, I don't think it would work 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.380
 which Bruce Greyson and I did in America 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:04.200
 So we said, OK, we want to study near-death experiences 

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.240
 and then we also want to know the state of the brain 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:12.520
 And how can you know the condition of the brain of the woman giving birth? 

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.280
 You can't, it's too many variables. 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.580
 And during illness, it's also too diverse. 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.280
 So I took what I thought was most sensible when the brain didn't work 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.240
 So I took near-death experiences during cardiac arrest. 

00:07:32.540 --> 00:07:35.380
 So we spent a few years studying this. 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.520
 So it was a big sample, did you get the whole spectrum of near-death experiences? 

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.160
 I think it was almost the whole spectrum in our culture. 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:50.300
 it must be said that there are certain foundations that are culturally specific 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:54.560
 for example, light tunnels are seen much more 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.040
 in the western ZBS than in the eastern 

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.700
 and when you take hunter-gatherers, the experiences are quite different. 

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:09.100
 For example, there are beautiful simple near-death experiences 

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.760
 from the times of hunters-gatherers and so there is one example 

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.620
 One man had this near-death experience: 

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:22.720
 He got into his canoe, and rowed for 3 days 

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:28.720
 until he came to the island - it is his near-death experience - he did 

00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:37.440
 and he had an ideal place experience on this island 

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:41.860
 They tend to be near death experiences, so his was quite different 

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.260
 Let's not forget the Japanese 

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:50.080
 when they leave, they usually do not pass through a tunnel, but come to a dark river. 

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.200
 he has to go, he has to find a ferryman who will transport them, so such things 

00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.320
 So there are cultural differences that need to be recognized and accepted. 

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.820
 Does it depend on your worldview? In your background? 

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.660
 Yes, the reasons why there are cultural differences are very diverse. 

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:14.280
 It is definitely a view of the world, it is definitely a religious education 

00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:19.220
 and it is definitely influenced by the culture in which you live, all these things have an impact. 

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:23.160
 What do you think is the value of ZBS research? 

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:28.640
 I think it has two important values. 

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:35.640
 One that must be the pinnacle of consciousness research. 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:43.340
 And one of the things we find out is that powerful experiences change the people who live them 

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:49.080
 and people who have near - death experiences are changed by them and 

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:53.840
 this is an interesting fact to look at 

00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:01.100
 their phenomenology gives us some idea of ​​the structure and properties of consciousness 

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.200
 So from this point of view, they are extremely good. 

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.280
 And because they are connected 

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.680
 I must emphasize that it is only a connection, they are much more extensive than this, 

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:17.160
 with cardiac arrest and experiences associated with real death 

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.540
 They are a good model of how we die. 

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.620
 So for all these reasons, I think they are very important. 

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.540
 Do you think near-death experiences provide any evidence? 

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.580
 that consciousness can exist without the brain? 

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:40.560
 Is consciousness independent of the brain? This is a very broad question. . 

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:46.780
 Can consciousness exist without the brain? 

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.180
 We don't have a way to find out, do we? 

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.380
 It's a good question, I formulate it a little differently. 

00:10:57.380 --> 00:11:04.880
 I would say, mechanically correct: Is consciousness created by the brain? 

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:11.820
 for example, the gallbladder excretes bile, or the kidneys excrete urine 

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:15.200
 is a product of brain functions? 

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:18.720
 or is it actually a filter 

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.480
 there is a transcendent reality somewhere 

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.620
 which is filled with the brain? 

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:30.060
 So we get her reduced image 

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:35.840
 I think these are two questions. I know what my own answer is. 

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.780
 But this is not the usual answer. 

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.780
 And why is that so? 

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:46.660
 Why do I believe that consciousness exists outside the brain? 

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:52.120
 Rather than believe that it is excreted by the brain, such as bile. 

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:59.100
 The answer is, why would you think it's just a function of the brain? 

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:06.200
 And when you look at the arguments that are put forward there must be very high 

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:12.880
 correlation between brain damage and changes in the mind 

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:18.480
 and abilities and so on in a person with an injury 

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:24.400
 There must be a very high correlation, but that says nothing about causality 

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.480
 causality and correlation are quite different 

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:32.640
 and if you want really good authority for this statement 

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:36.020
 You can think of Penfield 

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:43.600
 Penfield was a very well known neurosurgeon from Canada 

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.660
 And Penfiled put electrodes in his brain, he was one of the first people to do so 

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:57.360
 and had a very good idea of ​​how the brain works and how it is connected 

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.560
 So he spent his whole life watching the brain. 

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:07.960
 Finally, he wrote a book about what he thought the mind was 

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:13.360
 and in the end he came to the conclusion that there was absolutely no doubt that neurons 

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:19.780
 they communicate with each other in very complex ways that we do not yet understand 

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.240
 But, the energy of the mind is different. 

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.640
 and so no matter how much you study neurons, in fact 

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:35.500
 You don't get the energy of the mind, so it's a different dimension literally. 

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.920
 this is the opinion of someone who has spent his whole life studying the brain 

00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:43.080
 but on the other hand, you have philosophers like Dan Dennetta 

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:48.680
 which says it's the whole brain. I sat next to Dan Dennet once at a conference 

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.100
 and I said unto him, Dane, thou believest not of this, do thou? 

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.140
 when we understand neurons, we understand consciousness 

00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:03.700
 He said: Absolutely. Once we understand the neurons, 

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:09.180
 so nothing else will be left. Maybe a tiny crumb like this and that's it. 

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.280
 It's just a brain, so we have two camps. 

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:19.840
 And every Tábor can provide evidence that it is right. 

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:25.580
 But of course I'm sitting somewhere in the middle. The brain is enormously important. 

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.860
 has great features 

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.700
 but you cannot explain consciousness with it 

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:36.680
 There is only one theory in the world about what consciousness is 

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:42.320
 And that is the theory of Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose 

00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:48.520
 and she says that the brain is in microtubules - these are the structures in the brain- 

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.260
 behaves like a quantum computer 

00:14:52.260 --> 00:15:00.360
 and that it is within the collapse of the wave function in these tubules 

00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:05.940
 where consciousness, undifferentiated and unconnected, arises 

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.120
 so imagine that huge matrix of the brain 

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.640
 and these small points of consciousness entering the brain 

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:20.660
 then, of course, consciousness is woven into the brain and into the circuits in the brain 

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:26.300
 and it is then built into self-awareness. And that's actually the only theory I know 

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.860
 which actually allows the emergence of consciousness in at least some way. 

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:33.680
 So it's an important theory. 

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:38.840
 You wrote a book on the art of dying and described several 

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:42.800
 near-death experiences. Can you tell us something about them? 

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:47.080
 I wrote a book called The Art of Dying. 

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:52.540
 and I wrote it because I asked a question 

00:15:52.780 --> 00:15:58.920
 which arose directly from research on near-death experiences 

00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:05.600
 Research says you're going down a tunnel - in our culture - 

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.180
 You meet a being of light, you go into this transcendent reality 

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:17.600
 where you meet dead relatives and spiritual beings, your past life may be projected 

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:23.040
 then you come to a limit that you know will die if you cross. 

00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:27.640
 so, it's a very compelling question to ask 

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:34.900
 Is this near-death model a model of what happens when you die? 

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:40.760
 Basically, we can't answer that, because how would you verify such a model? 

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:46.860
 What you will do is find out what the mental experiences of the dying are 

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:53.560
 In 2000, when I started this research, you could go to 

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:59.820
 PubMed, one of the major medical databases and ask questions like: 

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:06.180
 How many people published works on the topic of visions on the deathbed - about 5 at the time 

00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:11.080
 How about end-of-life connection experiences - maybe one or two 

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:17.940
 so as you can see you could become a world expert very quickly - just looked at 7 works and you knew all the literature 

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:22.840
 so I'm trying to say that basically nothing like it was here. 

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:29.840
 so we went to the ethics committee and asked: Can we please talk to the dying? 

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.460
 So we can get an idea of ​​what the dying process is? 

00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:39.080
 and it was back in 2000 and they quite rightly said 

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.520
 No, because you can disturb the dying. And why would they say that? 

00:17:43.620 --> 00:17:49.560
 They said it because no one had done it before and they didn't really know 

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:54.760
 so we had to change direction, we had to do caregiver research 

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.280
 When you go to a hospice - today it is less noticeable, but before it was very familiar 

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.720
 then you find that it is divided into groups 

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.080
 There are nurses who are in contact with patients. You see all the phenomena of dying 

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.380
 and doctors who don't see them and say they don't 

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:19.980
 So there is a really significant difference between the two. 

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:24.300
 and I have some really interesting stories about 

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.940
 this gap between medical and nursing staff, but today it is less. 

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.700
 Yes? Tell us. 

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:37.000
 I'll tell you why I did it and tell you stories later, because it will make more sense this way. 

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:45.880
 So, the ethics committee said we can ask caregivers, but we can't ask the dying. 

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.060
 so we did nursing research 

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.660
 we did 3 hospices in nursing homes in this country 

00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:57.580
 and we did 3 hospices in Rotterdam 

00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:04.180
 to make some cultural differences, it's not very different, but it's quite far apart. 

00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.060
 and we found the most fascinating things 

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.320
 it allowed us to put it together 

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.220
 Lots of different things to expect 

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:22.380
 The first thing that can happen to you is a hunch. 

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.700
 And that means you know you're going to die before you're diagnosed. 

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.260
 You'll find out in a dream ... maybe 

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.020
 or it suddenly comes to you that you're going to die ... soon 

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:40.380
 Are they patients or relatives? No, they are patients. 

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:47.920
 The Dalailama says that we all know 2 years before we die that we will die. 

00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.000
 so this information is given to us. When you look in his book as we know it, 

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:59.560
 he says two things, one of which I understand a bit and these are changes in behavior 

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:04.500
 the second is that our breathing will change, but I don't know what he means 

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.680
 but I see that an individual's behavior can change 

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.500
 you may feel like you are dying and then your behavior will change 

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.320
 but he says it's very common, in fact, for everyone. 

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:23.640
 We didn't find this, we found it wasn't common, but not so rare that we didn't catch it, 

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.880
 occasional cases of this 

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:33.040
 Another thing that will happen is that 

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.940
 A few weeks before you die, visitors come to their death beds. 

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.340
 And what is a deathbed visitor? 

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:48.360
 They are relatives who come to you and do it in a specific way 

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.400
 they can stand outside the room in which you are dying 

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.160
 or they can come into the room and this is quite common 

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:04.540
 of course you will talk to them and a lot of them will sit on the bed and talk to you 

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:09.720
 Because it's extremely reassuring when someone sits on your bed 

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:16.880
 I mean, if you've ever had an old child, you know that when you talk to them, you don't stand over them, but you sit on the bed and hold his hand and so on. 

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:21.380
 So the relatives are sitting on the bed. 

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:26.820
 And we took hundreds of apparitions on the deathbed and analyzed them in terms of content. 

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:28.940
 and we figured out that 

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:33.620
 The most common people who come first are relatives. 

00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:36.420
 mother and father are commonly seen 

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:39.320
 dead couples are quite common 

00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:44.000
 but we also found that brothers and sisters walk as well 

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.220
 people you don't know only occasionally 

00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.980
 animals 

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:58.680
 not much, I'm sorry, but your cat or dog probably won't come 

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.220
 so mostly they are closest relatives 

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:09.080
 and we also found in our sample 

00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.780
 that spiritual beings are seen 

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:17.160
 spiritual beings behave a little differently than relatives 

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:23.960
 They tend to wait outside the hospice, they are seen through the windows 

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.960
 or they may come to the door and some will enter 

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:32.300
 I must emphasize that the cultural element plays a major role here 

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:40.280
 Because an article published by the American BibleBelt 

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.920
 It shows that angels are seen very commonly. 

00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:49.360
 in our sample, only 3 percent of people saw an angel 

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:53.820
 so it's much less in our research, so I think it's a cultural part. 

00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:58.880
 So there are relatives and spiritual beings, are there any other phenomena around dying? 

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:04.880
 As you approach death, you will enter the next phase 

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.140
 and in fact this needs to change a bit now 

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:16.520
 what we finally found out was that you were going to another dimension, the spiritual world 

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:22.160
 then you go back again, it's like you're used to staying in the spirit world. 

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.160
 so you go there, then back again, then there again, then back again. 

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:30.640
 and it was very important for people who were dying 

00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.280
 and this is now changing 

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:41.980
 and I would like to talk to Monika Rentis' theory on this topic 

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.260
 because it is extremely important 

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:49.300
 Monica Rents is a theologian in Switzerland 

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:55.140
 and she had a lot of contact with the dying. 

00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:00.320
 and to date has published 3 studies, 

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:03.620
 about patients dying of cancer. 

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:11.100
 and one study was, I think, with 60 patients, another with 240 

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:15.860
 recently conducted a dual study of hospices 

00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:21.100
 And she found that what we said was right. 

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:26.640
 people really walk into this other reality. 

00:24:26.980 --> 00:24:31.820
 but now that we come to the very process of dying. 

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:35.060
 which is extremely interesting and important 

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:42.400
 and we all have to learn it, we should actually learn it in school 

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:48.600
 and I think it's like dying like this: 

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.000
 Visitors come on their deathbeds 

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.160
 then, at some point, you realize that you will die. 

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.760
 and it will hit you hard 

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:04.300
 There's no going back, boys, this isn't going to be good anymore, it's a dying process 

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:11.020
 and that will leave you in a very difficult position 

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.960
 because you've never encountered it, you've always had some control over something, not now 

00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.740
 so you have to start leaving everything, this is absolutely essential 

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:25.680
 you have to give up the fact that you will continue your life 

00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:30.200
 you have to give up your wife, you have to give up your cat, your dog 

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:36.400
 you have to give up your children, your family, your house, your work, you have to give up everything 

00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:40.560
 and if not, you will remain attached 

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:47.580
 and attachment is the hardest thing when you die 

00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:52.220
 if you can give up everything, you will have a very quiet departure 

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.300
 You go out of this before the transition phase, where you are chained 

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:01.580
 to the transition phase, which leads to the post-transition phase 

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:07.320
 and in the post-transition phase you have given up everything 

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:13.940
 You immerse yourself more and more in the spiritual dimension I described, it's just like that. 

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.700
 and in the end you lost your ego 

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:25.120
 you have lost the part of you that is different from you 

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.540
 and you will become what is called "nonjuel" 

00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:35.560
 it actually means that you have already connected with the universe 

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:42.920
 You have already lost all ties to your body and being human 

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:50.240
 and you have acquired this non-duality, which is a connection with the higher cosmos 

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:57.700
 So the idea is that you remain too attached to a lot 

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:02.320
 the things you have in this life when you go there. 

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:06.360
 You know, maybe you won't be able to see your mom again and say hello, probably not 

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:09.840
 but you will be able, you can see your mom, i don't know 

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:14.800
 but you really become part of the universe (space) 

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:21.060
 So the data shows us. The data shows that if you do not give up 

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.460
 all the things you are attached to 

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.500
 Then you will have a very difficult dying process 

00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:32.740
 you have these two processes, one is merging with the afterlife 

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.740
 the second that keeps you here limits 

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.500
 And what happens after dying is harder? 

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.960
 Then you experience what is called spiritual unrest. 

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:50.100
 It is not a pleasant condition because you have a lot of anxiety. 

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:56.080
 and you are pulled back all the time, pulled back, it's not pleasant. 

00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:00.360
 You should know that. So when you go to the hospice 

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.660
 you should be trained that you will have to give up everything. 

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.980
 So it takes you into the process of dying. 

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:15.300
 now before you die, i just want to add one more phenomenon 

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.140
 these are called temporary clairvoyance 

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.440
 temporary clairvoyance is when ... The Victorians called it 

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.540
 late awakening, basically 

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:36.200
 and the thing was, you suddenly sat in bed 

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.480
 you said hello to the people around you 

00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:44.520
 you don't actually say hello, but goodbye because you know you're dying 

00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:50.860
 and then you lie back and die, that's interesting in itself, but it's even more interesting 

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:55.580
 because people who are paralyzed and haven't moved for a whole year 

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:59.900
 in a long-term care home, they can sit down and do it. 

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:06.180
 so for those few moments, it seems that the nervous system is working properly again. 

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:12.500
 but even more interesting to me is that people who have Alzheimer's disease 

00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:20.560
 and lost their memory many years ago 

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:23.960
 they suddenly sit down, meet their friends 

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:28.620
 they say goodbye, sometimes meeting their dead relatives, lying back and dying 

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:31.660
 so that's a real question for science, 

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:38.040
 because how can you do these things when you consider the argument that the brain creates consciousness 

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:44.020
 because it is a process of re-healing - things like this, just before you die 

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.840
 it doesn't make sense 

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.780
 so, then you will die 

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:57.480
 Now the show is not over, maybe it is from your point of view, but not from the point of view of your relatives 

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.760
 because many people have 

00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.700
 close relationship 

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:11.260
 they will then, may make a visit 

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:19.480
 And this is important because as you approach death, you can actually 

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.080
 Postpone your death a bit, because at times, some visitors 

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:27.920
 at your deathbed they will say I will come again on Tuesday and you will die on Tuesday 

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:35.400
 but remember that we have two running versions, in one you have more control, you probably have a fix 

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:40.980
 so you can remember that you can negotiate with yours 

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.960
 relatives if you want to live a little longer 

00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:51.480
 but if you really die and have the urge to go after yours, say daughter 

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.340
 or son 

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.900
 who could not be with you, so then you can visit them 

00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.520
 and this visit is very specific 

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.920
 we have a lot of them and we analyzed them 

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:12.160
 and present at the time of death in 99% of cases within half an hour, but most directly at the time of death 

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:18.760
 and it depends on the mental state of the recipient of the visit 

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:25.680
 When you receive a visit when you are awake, then it will feel that way 

00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:28.760
 someone you know is dying 

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:32.340
 feeling they wanted to 

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.180
 help in a certain direction 

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.880
 or you feel that a catastrophe is happening, it's many feelings you have 

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:47.560
 but if you are sleeping, it is quite different, you have a dream with a story and here is one example 

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:55.240
 the woman woke up, I think she was actually in a dream 

00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:01.000
 and she saw her son standing at the end of his bed 

00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:04.060
 and her son was wet 

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.880
 and her son walked closer and closer to her 

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:14.960
 and as he approached he entered the light 

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:22.060
 and he transformed, left her a message, which many of them do, and said it was all right 

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.900
 please don't worry, I'm fine 

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:32.400
 and then it all faded. The interesting thing is that she was in Australia and he in England 

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:37.600
 and when she could, due to the time difference, she called 

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:44.100
 and found that he had drowned in England at the time 

00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:48.860
 and there was a component of what was happening that he wore wet clothes 

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:54.200
 and then its transformation and disappearance at the end. 

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:58.980
 so it's not an unusual story. Sometimes they just come 

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:03.500
 and pass the message, which is always fine, please do not worry 

00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:07.760
 and then they leave, so it's called coincidence on the deathbed 

00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:19.040
 in our ranks, 45% of the people who had them did not know that the person was dying 

00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:25.680
 so in more than half of the cases it is not possible to tempt the explanation to expectations 

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:29.240
 And I don't think he actually expects ... 

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:34.260
 the expectation of one's death is a generally good explanation. 

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:36.580
 So that's a vision on a deathbed. 

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.560
 There are other phenomena that occur at the time of death 

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.000
 and these are 

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.860
 light in the room 

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:52.340
 The light in the room is fascinating, it can be very strong and act like 

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.800
 True light, in other words, light can flood a room 

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.340
 and can radiate from the room 

00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.440
 Experienced by relatives? 

00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:02.120
 only relatives 

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.560
 into the hallway 

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:09.760
 and then people can catch him 

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:18.720
 and we had one case of a person aroused during the night by a shining light who mistakenly thought it was a forgotten light in the hallway 

00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:25.160
 and she saw the light coming from her aunt's room. Her aunt was dying. She went inside 

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:31.020
 and when you enter this light, it always has a spiritual effect, she reported it 

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.100
 and sat quietly with her aunt 

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:39.700
 and she slowly died. And as she died, the lights were lost. Extinguishing the light along with death is very common. 

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:45.940
 So another thing that can happen at the time of death, and when I say common 

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:51.880
 in our series, 45% percent of nurses reported 

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:58.380
 light in the dying rooms and in their conversations with relatives 

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:03.140
 but it's a little more complicated because I've talked to relatives 

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.000
 who were brother and sister 

00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:12.020
 and one of them saw it and the other didn't, so I think it would be an interaction between 

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.800
 between a person and what happens during dying. 

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.040
 So that's the light. Another thing is the shapes leaving the body. 

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:23.440
 again quite common. 

00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:27.880
 there are many stories about it and you 

00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.780
 describe, first of all some people describe some kind of fata morgana 

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:39.320
 he sees coming out is a bit like a change in the atmosphere 

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:46.600
 and the other thing is that it can look like rising smoke 

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:51.140
 or it may have a clear shape 

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:58.000
 and they are all variations on the subject and it's like Betta's book of the dead 

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:05.100
 It describes these last faces of the dead, it describes mirage, it describes smoke 

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:10.160
 and then they go to our sky and to the white sky 

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:15.700
 which is something a little different, but it's a state further in line 

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.440
 so the shapes leaving the body are quite common 

00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.740
 light from transformation, then 

00:36:24.180 --> 00:36:28.600
 stopping the clock, does the clock really stop? 

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:34.340
 Well, the answer is yes. How do we know? Because people say their watches stop. 

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:36.840
 at the time of death and show them. 

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:43.500
 But I was intrigued that okay, I understand it's a pendulum clock, you know the narrow high ones 

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.900
 stopped because you have such a normal mechanical feeling 

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:54.660
 but they also stop the modern clock, which is LED 

00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:58.460
 stop? And how do they do it? 

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.700
 Does the light turn off or how? 

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:05.200
 And we got one or two cases. 

00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:13.200
 and this one is nice, someone came to tell one man that his brother had died 

00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:17.340
 and when he entered his house 

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:23.180
 the man whose brother died told him it wasn't necessary 

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.720
 to tell me, I know 

00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:30.060
 and when he asked him as he knew, he said 

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:35.600
 look at the clock. And they all stopped at the time of his death 

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.120
 and his time of death flashed. That's the story. 

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:45.100
 But there are many such stories about stopping clocks and the like. 

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.900
 The clock still stops even in this modern age. 

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:57.120
 Other things are cats and other animals howling at the time of death, which is quite common. 

00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:02.100
 common enough for people to report it and birds 

00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:04.100
 fascinating 

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:10.120
 When you talk to people in hospices, they will tell you that birds appear very often 

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:18.300
 on the window sills of people who died. I wish people would do simple experiments, just one camera. 

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:22.520
 put it on the window of the man who is dying and compare it 

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:29.900
 with the window of someone who does not die, it is such a simple, so simple experiment, either it is true or it is not. 

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:37.920
 So birds are commonly seen. The village of Massachusetts was here 

00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:44.380
 where they described a man who was an admirer of owls 

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:49.780
 a white owl flew in and sat on a tree in the village 

00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:54.380
 well documented that there are no white owls here 

00:38:55.100 --> 00:39:02.340
 and the owl remained there until his burial, and flew away after his funeral. What does it mean? I don't know. 

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:04.280
 Has she been seen by others? 

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:06.440
 Seen by others, yes. 

00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.160
 so these are all things that happen. 

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.360
 Do you have any idea how often these things occur? 

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:22.780
 In our questionnaires, we always asked what the frequency was. 

00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:27.220
 You can do this in two ways, you can see how common it is in the sense 

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:31.880
 if a lot of our caregivers have seen it, it's probably much more common than not 

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:35.960
 so i can give you frequencies very easily 

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:43.560
 talking to caregivers, the frequency of death bed events was about 50% 

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.080
 but since we published these studies, other people have done it 

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:52.620
 and they did it in two ways 

00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:59.380
 they did it by looking at graphs, in other words judging graphs 

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:05.700
 so they watched how many times people said they saw 

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.920
 visitors on a deathbed and the like, no one saw any of it 

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:15.140
 and another way is to ask the dying if they are at a given stage or to ask 

00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:18.220
 nurses or relatives 

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:22.700
 and suddenly you get up to 80%, it's probably very common 

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.800
 but people just don't report it. And suddenly we know 

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:32.740
 That in the study of Monika Rensis 90% 

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.040
 90%, that's almost everyone 

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:41.780
 goes through this phase when he goes to an alternative reality and back 

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:49.860
 and he will have to give up everything and face non-duality, which is enormously important. 

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.920
 How can we achieve a good death? 

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:57.240
 I am now guided by all the experience I have 

00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.700
 works of Monika Rensis 

00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:06.480
 my work has shown that you will go into this alternative reality. 

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.620
 you will have your visitors on their deathbed and then you will slowly reach death 

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.140
 and many people will then really transgress. 

00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.060
 I have 2 stories for it 

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:25.280
 One is my great friend Thetis Blacker, who was a religious florist 

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:31.200
 and I had an agreement with Thetis that when he died 

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.900
 so she'll let me know, and if I die first, I'll let her know 

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:41.200
 so we can talk about the dying process, because we talked a lot about it 

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:45.460
 And she died before I did, because I'm still here and she wasn't. 

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:51.540
 And she described what it was like for her and said how 

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:55.580
 approaching death, it was only a week before death. 

00:41:56.060 --> 00:42:02.100
 She experienced a river full of love, golden love and light 

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.100
 which flowed through her room and through the hospice 

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:10.520
 And this type of phenomenon probably occurs quite often 

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:16.400
 but no one asks people about it and they also don't know how to include it in their understanding of the world. 

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.360
 but this type of things. 

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:22.900
 And another, which is an amazing book, he wrote a book about it 

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:29.600
 and this is Paul Robertson, the lead medics of the quartet 

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:35.040
 He and I knew each other very well and Paul had a near-death experience 

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.860
 and in his near-death experience 

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.660
 classifies the point of death 

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:49.100
 he says he has given up his body to join the cosmic consciousness 

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:55.560
 Joyfully, happily and willingly, as you can see he was disconnected and I think it is very good 

00:42:55.780 --> 00:43:01.840
 a description of the process of death that we now have, with joy, love and willingness 

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:08.880
 and when he returned, he was able to talk about his near-death experience and the way he had changed his life 

00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:12.660
 I had the same agreement with him 

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:20.500
 if I die before he does, he will come to be with me, but I was really lucky to be there the day before he died 

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:26.900
 and he was both inside and outside himself, but 

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.500
 unfortunately I couldn't stay long enough, but his wife was there the next day 

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:37.100
 and he slowly sank into unconsciousness 

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:44.500
 and he told his wife, tell Peter Fenwick it was exactly as we were talking 

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.140
 and then he died. 

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:49.760
 Interesting, I mean, you can't get much closer. 

00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:56.160
 So I think the picture we have of dying from people who have died 

00:43:56.560 --> 00:44:00.740
 he's basically pretty good, and I think you have to think about giving up everything 

00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:03.280
 and then become non-dual and connected. 

00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:09.260
 One of the interesting points of near-death experiences 

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.900
 that several of them become non-dual. What i mean? 

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.860
 This is in consciousness research 

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.380
 and it is one of the most interesting points of consciousness research 

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:28.140
 and that is that as you approach the process of awakening, in other words 

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.120
 to change the level of your consciousness to a wider consciousness 

00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:36.500
 You basically have one of two features 

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:42.300
 you lose your talking self, those little parts of your self that keep talking to yourself 

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:44.320
 It will leave. 

00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:46.940
 Next, you're still in the moment 

00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.860
 you are not in the past or in the future, it means nothing to you. 

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:57.060
 If you ask them what the world is, they will say it here and now, that's it. 

00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:00.340
 And what was he like? 

00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:06.800
 It is not there, there is no "what will come in the future", you are only in the moment 

00:45:07.300 --> 00:45:11.340
 Another thing is that you are incredibly happy 

00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:19.220
 And you also tend to be transcendent 

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:23.740
 your personality is not in the narrator's voice here 

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:29.800
 You have become non-dual and you connect with reality. 

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:35.160
 There's a man named Jeffrey Martin in the states 

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:39.220
 and he collected such 1,500 cases 

00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:46.600
 they are ordinary people who have done it, so we know that this state exists and we know how it exists 

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:52.120
 and connections with near-death experiences 

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:57.980
 it is here due to non-dual elements in near-death experiences. 

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.680
 and dying, the question is whether they are the same or not. 

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:06.520
 and whether people can become non-dual in near-death experiences 

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:10.760
 And the answer can be yes. And how do I know? 

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.320
 Because I talked to people who had a near-death experience, actually just two 

00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:21.820
 But I only needed two to describe the non-dual state 

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:28.340
 So there may be a change in your level of consciousness when you return from a near-death experience. 

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:34.220
 So the idea that near-death experiences could have something to do with dying 

00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:39.360
 and relatively narrowly in terms of consciousness and change of consciousness 

00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:43.260
 it starts to make sense in a very interesting way. 

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:50.300
 Do you think there is a connection between how we think and how we live our lives 

00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:55.080
 and between the way we experience death and what comes after it. 

00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.380
 It is the way of life that you lead 

00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:02.940
 will it affect the way you die? 

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:07.520
 Yes it will affect you, but you have to be very careful here 

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:13.400
 Because, we have a lot of people who say it's all material 

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:18.280
 I'll just go into the darkness and nothing. 

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.820
 And they say this in advance ... 

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:22.720
 In advance, it is their structure of faith. 

00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:31.080
 And what is quite clear is that as it approaches the process of death 

00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:40.200
 they all give up this idea and everyone starts to wonder what is happening to them. 

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:43.440
 They no longer say they don't believe in anything. 

00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:48.160
 The kind of thing they say, one woman who was absolutely sure 

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:55.460
 that after death there is nothing she still woke up from a coma and said, come on, move with it, I want to move on 

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.060
 and that was quite different from her position 

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:04.720
 so if you strongly believe in angels, you will probably see angels 

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:12.460
 this is what the southern part of North America sees according to the Biblebelt. 

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.600
 They showed it. 

00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:20.800
 If you have led a good life, it will be different 

00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:26.200
 from a bad life? I'll define it a bit more 

00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:31.920
 If a good life means you are not strongly focused on yourself 

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:36.320
 in other words, you think of other people and do such things 

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.900
 then when you reach this stage all give up 

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.780
 you can get rid of it much easier because you are not self-centered 

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.120
 the next thing is guilt 

00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:52.280
 because guilt is something that is very difficult for people to leave 

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:57.760
 all the things they have done for which they feel guilty are very difficult to give them up. 

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.300
 so when you think about 

00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:07.060
 someone who has committed a lot of crimes and feels guilty about it 

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:10.240
 then it will be very difficult for them to give up everything 

00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:14.900
 My colleagues ask me, what happens when you are a psychopath and you don't feel guilty? 

00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:21.660
 I don't know, I've never seen a psychopath die, but I guess it's very easy for them, I don't know if they can give up everything. 

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:28.620
 So, it will be related to the quality of your life, the quality of your life will be related to 

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:33.140
 with your ability to give up everything, it will depend on how self-centered you are 

00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:37.240
 the more self-centered you are, the harder it will be to give up everything. 

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.840
 Clichés that we can often find in movies and literature 

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:51.300
 that a good man has a good death, and a bad man has a bad death. Is this what you observed in your research? 

00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:58.340
 I described it as a claim about the death of normal people 

00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:05.560
 and the deaths of people who suffer from spiritual anxiety as they approach their deaths 

00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:10.100
 so if people have spiritual anxiety, they remain attached. 

00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:16.460
 And those who are free are not attached. So, based on this statement, you can say 

00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:25.460
 that if they are guilty or unable to leave their personality, or their possessions or whatever 

00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.120
 so such people will have a difficult death. 

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:32.440
 So it somehow corresponds to the literature, but not completely 

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:35.560
 It lacks the liner that you have to be able to give up everything. 

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:43.440
 So let's say you're a billionaire and you laugh at your friends and you say - now it's all yours 

00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:47.740
 Give it up and dive to death, it's fine, no problem 

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:53.280
 Many of my colleagues and many doctors say that these are just hallucinations, what can you say about that? 

00:50:55.460 --> 00:51:01.700
 So people claim that all these things we found in the dying are hallucinations. 

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:04.160
 That's terminology, isn't it? 

00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:09.640
 What is a hallucination? Hallucinations are an experience that only you and no one else has. 

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.800
 so there are a lot of hallucinations 

00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:17.220
 so the fact that they are hallucinations doesn't really say anything 

00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:26.240
 but when you look at the data, the relatives are in the same room 

00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.360
 often, not actually often, rarely sees 

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:35.320
 visitors on a deathbed, but they see there are quite a good number 

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:42.100
 children see them more than adults and sometimes even hospice nurses see them 

00:51:42.480 --> 00:51:46.460
 So based on that, these are not hallucinations in these cases 

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:49.880
 so why would you say that some are hallucinations and some are not 

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:52.440
 it makes no sense 

00:51:52.540 --> 00:51:58.760
 calling them hallucinations means that you want to get rid of the topic, now let's talk about something interesting ... 

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:05.460
 but they are not, it does not help 

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:11.620
 Yes, there are also so-called infernal near-death experiences, what can you say about them? 

00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:18.800
 So some people report hellish experiences, I have some difficulties with them 

00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:24.520
 because in the ones we took in our research 

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:33.480
 or in the letters people wrote, there was always a clear explanation of what a hellish experience it was 

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:38.160
 I'll give you an example. One man had a near-death experience 

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:44.120
 he suddenly realized that he had left his body and was in a hellish world 

00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:50.220
 and there were many demons trying to deceive him 

00:52:54.460 --> 00:53:01.840
 and tortured him, and he knew he was in a hellish world because he could feel the flames of hell burning him 

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:07.460
 and how he felt better because he was in the intensive care unit 

00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:12.060
 he realized that his infernal experience was in fact coming 

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:15.600
 from the heated mat on which he lay 

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:20.600
 and this led to a misinterpretation of the thermal sensor data 

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:24.740
 and demons, so it's pretty easy to figure out 

00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:30.200
 because he said it was the nurses who went there to give him injections and do things like that 

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:35.300
 so it was his interpretation, it was an illusory experience 

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.400
 he got very close to what is called intensive care psychosis 

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:47.280
 because it's paranoia when you think people are doing terrible things to you 

00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:55.060
 So it has a rational explanation, you don't have to assume hell 

00:53:55.720 --> 00:54:01.380
 But the question is, is there really any hell where people can go? 

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:09.040
 I have no near-death experience, no real experience where people would report that there was hell. 

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.880
 they just don't do it 

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:18.760
 in our sample of near-death experiences it was about 4%, it's probably maybe less 

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:26.060
 because let us remember that ours were questionnaires for sent letters 

00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:32.180
 and you probably won't go write a letter to someone who did a show about ZBS 

00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:37.560
 in which you will write that your ZBS was a punishment and you were pulled by demons, certainly not. 

00:54:37.940 --> 00:54:41.320
 So we probably have a basis in this regard. 

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.920
 but the ones we have in our sample 

00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:49.020
 I would not say that they were of the same type and order as 

00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:52.740
 near-death experiences. Other people think I'm wrong about this. 

00:54:53.020 --> 00:54:56.800
 So obviously you can interpret the data in both directions. 

00:54:56.940 --> 00:55:01.300
 So what did you learn from all this, is there a message for our culture? 

00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.660
 I think the experience I found out 

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:11.140
 about experiences close to death and dying, carry a very important message for our culture 

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.760
 I'm absolutely one with the Dalai Lama in the first part 

00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:18.480
 He says any culture 

00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:24.300
 which sweeps her dead under the rug and can't recognize them 

00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.800
 is a society that is greedy 

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.320
 because you collect things and you own them 

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:35.020
 you can be mad at people 

00:55:35.260 --> 00:55:38.640
 because it's okay to have enemies 

00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:43.040
 and you are very self-centered 

00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:46.000
 because you will live forever 

00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:51.900
 And when you look at our culture, it contains very strong symptoms of this 

00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:58.220
 So I think the way we medicalize death, sweep it away, don't talk about it 

00:55:58.360 --> 00:56:05.040
 produces exactly the company in which we deny our responsibility 

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:08.540
 look, every hundred years, we'll all be swept away just like that. 

00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:11.820
 and yet we're not talking about it, so that's point one 

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:17.300
 The next point is that we should start 

00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:24.480
 telling children what it's like to die that we will all eventually die and discuss it 

00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:31.960
 one of my grandchildren came down and found that the dog had gotten to the garden 

00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:36.020
 and bit off the head of two of his hamsters 

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:39.200
 at that moment he is confronted with death 

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:45.560
 These animals, which he adored to repair, have been destroyed and this raises questions 

00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:48.420
 Will they all go to hamster heaven? 

00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.880
 Or are we all just machines? 

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:58.860
 What does death mean? So you can see that very crucial questions await you relatively soon 

00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:05.200
 but if you go to a class full of children and ask how many of you have experienced someone's death? 

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:09.780
 Many of them have grandparents who have died, they know about it 

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:14.040
 so it should be in the school curriculum, we should teach them 

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:17.620
 that death is a normal part of life 

00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:26.380
 and you actually receive death when you receive birth. Death, birth and dying are all part of the same gear. 

00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.780
 and it will happen to us all 

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:33.360
 and there is nothing to fear or fear 

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:38.340
 What you should do is like going to the exam, you should prepare for it. 

00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:42.240
 and when you go to the final stage of death, you should prepare for it 

00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:46.080
 and then you can talk about the phenomena that occur and so on 

00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:51.520
 but it's very important that we stop sweeping under the rug 

00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:54.320
 And do you know why we sweep it under the rug? 

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:58.540
 Because we are not dying as before. 

00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:01.060
 If I were from a Victorian family, 

00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:07.240
 I would already have two or three siblings who died, very young. 

00:58:07.420 --> 00:58:09.440
 there were no antibiotics 

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:16.580
 Maintaining order and preventing infections was not a top priority 

00:58:16.780 --> 00:58:21.400
 so people died and children in particular, so death was ubiquitous 

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:25.020
 so the Victorians talked about her much more than we did 

00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:29.620
 Have you ever seen a horse go on a journey in our culture? 

00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.260
 What is followed? 

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:35.160
 Cars in the distance that drive slowly? 

00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:39.580
 Not everyone has their hands on the horn, so hurry, let's go, fast 

00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:41.780
 there is no respect 

00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:48.140
 Do you stand with your arms crossed and your head bowed as the horse passes? Of course not. 

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:53.400
 You are in charge of many other more important things because you do not respect death. 

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:56.520
 it's that simple and very important 

00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:00.980
 nothing weird about it, we'll all do it, so we should know. 

00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:02.280
 simple 

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:08.000
 Dr. Fenwick, thank you very much for your time and for your interesting suggestions 

00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:13.060
 and knowledge from your research, thank you very much. 

00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:15.960
 and thank you very much for your questions. 

00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:26.300
 you
