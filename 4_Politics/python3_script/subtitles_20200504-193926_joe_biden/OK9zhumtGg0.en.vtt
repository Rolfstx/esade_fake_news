00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.350
- Good morning, three of us
from the Pan AM Experience,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.780
Anthony and Talaat, Captan Talaat.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:07.630
We're on a road trip today

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.430
to a desert location in California.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:13.043
All shall be revealed soon, stay tuned.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.060
Oh, this is awesome.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.050
This is a great standing.

00:00:19.374 --> 00:00:21.610
- [Anthony] Qantas 74, oh my God.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.110
(wind rushes)

00:00:27.697 --> 00:00:29.404
- [Sam] Wish you'd cleaned
your window this morning.

00:00:29.404 --> 00:00:31.350
(laughs)

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.884
This is unbelievable.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:34.386
We're in the middle, yeah.

00:00:34.386 --> 00:00:36.446
Oh, Pan Am 74 there.

00:00:36.446 --> 00:00:37.604
The Comber 880.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:38.437
Look and the Qantas Jumbo.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:39.270
This is unbelievable.

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.754
Look at where we are,

00:00:40.754 --> 00:00:43.230
we're in the middle of
the aeroplane junkyard.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.938
(background chatter)

00:00:44.938 --> 00:00:46.638
Wish you'd clean your window, man.

00:00:48.388 --> 00:00:50.632
(digital beeps)

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:53.715
(country rock music)

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.045
- Hi, I'm Talaat Captan,

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:18.100
the owner and president of Air Hollywood.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.570
You here, I'm taking
you guys on the rides.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.407
You are at Mohave Airspace,

00:01:24.407 --> 00:01:27.560
entire desert is full of aeroplanes .

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.920
It's an amazing place.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.990
You get to see all the most
amazing aircraft in the world,

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.620
all retired here.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.370
- Incredible place, Mohave.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.287
Look at all these aeroplanes  here.

00:01:36.287 --> 00:01:40.120
Qantas 400, I probably flown
on lots of these aeroplanes .

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.958
This is the end of the
line for lots of 747.

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.220
And then, today, we're coming out,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.720
hopefully to check some
of the interior out.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.280
- We're about to go on this giant 74.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.110
Now, my favourite thing
about this aircraft

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.400
is it actually has a
completely intact interior,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.250
complete with the longitudinal
galley that Thai Airways had,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.600
and that amazing wall

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.563
and wallpaper only used by Thai Airways.

00:02:02.563 --> 00:02:04.210
I actually want to
bring it back home today

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.640
because I want to recreate
the Thai Airways experience

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.730
at Air Hollywood.

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.590
- [Sam] Be careful.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.810
In the middle, in the middle.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.393
In the middle, yeah.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.900
In the middle.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.733
- Welcome aboard.

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:19.049
Please join us at Thai Airways 747.

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.262
- I can't believe the Thai Airways

00:02:21.262 --> 00:02:24.957
continue to live in the
desert of California.

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:26.863
Look at this, unbelievable.

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.190
I actually remember myself

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.770
flew on this very special Thai 747,

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.130
sitting in the royal first class

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.700
and then everything is kept intact.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.000
The aeroplane had retired
and sold to the desert

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.960
but the seats came with it

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.950
and the seats are just
collecting dust right now.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.783
What a shame.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.920
- All right, so this is the
wallpaper I was referring to.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.050
You'll notice this kind of purple hue

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.670
of dark and light lavenders

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.560
and it has the entire Thai
landscape in the back,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.250
like the Grand Palace and
everything on the river.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.770
I love the fact that Thai Airways

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.230
actually thought about all this stuff

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.350
when they were designing the aircraft,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.730
that it reflects the
heritage of the country.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.880
Okay, so yeah, Sam, this
is the longitudinal galley

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.370
and this was really unique

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.990
to just a handful of airlines on the 400

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.670
but you might remember that the 747-SP

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.970
had this galley on every
single aircraft type

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.870
and I loved it.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.250
I loved it because on the
reverse of this galley,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.130
was always really unique
artwork for the airline

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.430
and Thai Airways included.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.764
Okay, so now we're actually on
the other side of the galley

00:03:26.764 --> 00:03:29.590
and so this is the wall
that I was referring to.

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.420
It always had amazing artwork on it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.640
and you can see here,
they put the Thai temples

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.360
and the colour scheme of
the airline on this wall

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.570
and this would have been
my favourite place to sit.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.190
Right, it was actually more private,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.047
you didn't have passengers
on the other side of you

00:03:43.047 --> 00:03:46.000
and you got to enjoy the
artwork for your entire flight.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.360
This is the traditional interior

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.240
from Thai Airways in the economy cabin.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:53.060
- What stuff is this hand
loose in the ceiling here?

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.730
- Okay, so this is
actually the PSU systems

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.680
and so all the oxygen masks
are actually still intact here.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.513
And this is actually

00:04:00.513 --> 00:04:02.150
a pretty valuable part
of the aeroplane still

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.860
and so, they've got these down

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.490
but people actually
want to buy these things

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:07.640
'cause they're still operable.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.840
Oh, Sam, look at this.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.850
It's almost like Royal Orchid Service

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:12.720
is right here on board today with us.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.713
- [Sam] She's still here with you.

00:04:13.713 --> 00:04:17.220
- Yes, in fact, I have this
uniform in my collection.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.410
So, you know, I think one of the things

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.180
I love about this aircraft

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.870
is the fact that this movie
screen is so old school.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.590
Like, think about, this
was really engineering

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.930
from the 70s and 80s on 747s,

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.480
where the crew would flip
the screen for the movie.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.140
Another reason why I love this 747.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.310
So, on the upper deck,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.970
Thai Airways did Royal Orchid
Executive Class, right,

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.970
the business class product.

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.402
And, oh, look at this,

00:04:41.402 --> 00:04:44.050
there's actually a purple
curtain sitting right here

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.830
from Thai Airways still.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.040
- [Sam] Are you going
to take home with this?

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.965
- Yeah, I'm absolutely
taking that with me.

00:04:48.965 --> 00:04:49.930
(laughs)

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.810
So, while most of the instrumentation
is obviously all gone,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.570
you can see there's still
four throttles here,

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.830
right, for four engines, right.

00:05:00.315 --> 00:05:02.245
Look one, two, three, four.

00:05:02.245 --> 00:05:05.830
(metallic clanking)

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.859
- [Unison] Full power.

00:05:06.859 --> 00:05:07.830
(laughs)

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.957
- Rotate in a moment.
- Rotate now.

00:05:09.957 --> 00:05:11.110
(metallic thumps)

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.932
- Not every airline did this.
- Oh my God.

00:05:12.932 --> 00:05:16.015
(country rock music)

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:34.700
- Sam, our second aeroplane for today

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.710
is going to be this X Qantas 747-400.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.100
No true aviation geek
would get on this aeroplane

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.730
via jet bridge or air stairs.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.010
We're going to walk up
the aviation geek way

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.910
and that is through the
nosewheel of the 747.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.410
Crawl through this little hole here

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.750
at the bottom of the aircraft

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.690
and then we're going to
reach literally right up

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.641
inside the first class cabin of the 74.

00:05:55.641 --> 00:05:57.970
(ladder clatters)

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.936
- Hopefully I don't get stuck in there.

00:05:59.936 --> 00:06:02.070
(ladder clatters)

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.930
I just made it the first stair

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.900
and now I'm in the E/E
bay, the avionics bay.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.170
Whoa, this is tight.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.280
Oh my God, I'm stuck here.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.668
Have you ever seen a man got stuck

00:06:13.668 --> 00:06:16.250
in between first class and the belly?

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:18.400
Whew, I made it.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.310
First time, av geek boarding a 747

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.360
from the nosewheel into first class cabin.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.343
What a difference.

00:06:25.343 --> 00:06:28.390
(country rock music)

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.223
Oh, look at the seats here.

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:31.520
They're good, I love this green colour,

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.474
Qantas colour seats, wow.

00:06:33.474 --> 00:06:36.557
(country rock music)

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.210
- So, Sam, have you ever
walked on the wing of a 747?

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:45.043
- [Sam] Oh, you're kidding me.

00:06:45.043 --> 00:06:46.980
- No, here we can.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.960
All the way to the end of
the wingtips of this 400.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.120
It's an amazing experience.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.470
- Show me.
- Come join me.

00:06:54.367 --> 00:06:55.350
(feet thump)

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.650
- I'm jumping out of the plane.

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.020
- [Talaat] Oh, my God.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.853
- Come.

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:01.820
(country rock music)
(laughs)

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.930
That's what I meant.

00:07:05.203 --> 00:07:07.003
This is so cool, standing on the edge.

00:07:07.003 --> 00:07:08.228
Look at this.

00:07:08.228 --> 00:07:09.843
Unbelievable, this is.

00:07:09.843 --> 00:07:11.080
This is the best spot, look at this.

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.580
Look at, they're nose to nose.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.840
Now I am at the wingtip of the 747-400.

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:17.737
How cool is this?

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:20.022
And you can jump around and bounce.

00:07:20.022 --> 00:07:21.720
- [Talaat] I'm feeling turbulence.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.559
- [Sam] Oh my God, this
is engine number four.

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:25.830
It's gone.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:29.247
Yeah, we're missing all the engines.

00:07:29.247 --> 00:07:32.330
(country rock music)

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:49.240
This is really right in
the middle of all the junk

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.010
and the thing they scrapped.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:52.050
Look at this, this looks like

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:54.240
some sort of pipes or landing gear

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.040
and all sort of things, engine
cowling, all metals scrapped.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.610
- This is a 747 engine, part of an engine.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.260
Come closer here and you can see.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.760
It's made out of titanium.

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.780
Titanium, and you see all this?

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:12.493
This is really very valuable materials

00:08:12.493 --> 00:08:14.050
and what do we do with it?

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.420
We make a fireplace out of it.

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.640
- You're actually doing good deeds.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.900
You turn all these aeroplane junk

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.130
into collectibles, into furnitures.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:23.470
- It's like we're reusing the aircraft

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.760
for a really good cause
and for good things.

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.990
For our art, for everything that we do.

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.080
It's really a lot of fun doing that.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:33.030
- It's incredible, there's
just hundreds of planes here.

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.760
There are heavy bodies, as well.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:38.030
DC-10, MD-11, 747.

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.337
I can spend here for months
here, just wandering around.

00:08:41.337 --> 00:08:42.570
Isn't that incredible?

00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:43.403
This is a shot.

00:08:43.403 --> 00:08:44.650
You want to take a photo here.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.652
You can see through to
the Lufthansa behind.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:48.485
(laughs)

00:08:48.485 --> 00:08:49.318
- This is convertible.

00:08:49.318 --> 00:08:51.970
- Convertible, yeah,
aeroplane convertible.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:52.930
Who's the owner of this is?

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.900
- So, look, Sam, this is
Spirit Aircraft number 133.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.930
- Wow, just had an incredible tour,

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.660
an hour around all the storage
aeroplanes , inside two 747s.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.820
It's really sad, though,

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.240
because you know this is end of the line.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.263
None of the plane will fly again.

00:09:10.854 --> 00:09:13.521
(digital beeps)

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:20.570
- So, this desert is probably
the most well-known boneyard

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.769
for aircraft of any of them, Victorville.

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:24.740
It's probably the most popular

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.730
because it is, in fact, the largest.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:29.090
I mean, just look in front of us here.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.424
There's probably 100
FedEx retired aircraft

00:09:32.424 --> 00:09:35.093
and that's just one little
section of this desert.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.320
- [Sam] Wow, there're just massive amount

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.683
of numbers of planes here.

00:09:40.578 --> 00:09:42.028
Incredible, incredible place.

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:43.893
There's United.

00:09:43.893 --> 00:09:46.513
- [Anthony] Man, look at
that China Airlines, damn.

00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:50.612
(country rock music)

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.380
- Too bad you weren't here, Sam,

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.140
when we were going to crush this plane.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.300
The next one to go is
that one right there.

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:09.030
- Man, that would be really sad, man.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.720
You know I've flown on
that aeroplane, VHOJN.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.670
I've flown it to South Africa
with first class inside.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.610
It'll be really sad.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:17.730
I don't think I can watch
that when you guys crush it.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:18.640
It's sad.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.910
- Yeah, it comes apart real fast.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.060
- Real fast, too.
- Oh yeah.

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.320
- [Sam] Oh my God.

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.070
- Yeah, I'll send you a video.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.986
- [Sam] Oh, I don't want it.

00:10:25.986 --> 00:10:26.819
(laughs)

00:10:26.819 --> 00:10:30.050
- These are excavators that
we use to demolish the planes.

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:32.600
- [Sam] This is the machine
that demolish planes.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.750
- [Guide] This is the littler
one, compared to the Hitachi.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:37.530
The Hitachi does more
of the stronger metal.

00:10:37.530 --> 00:10:39.550
- [Sam] How long it take
to bring a plane down

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.960
and reduce them into
that scrap metal pile?

00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.580
- 747 usually takes about a month.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.550
- A month?
- A month,

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:47.670
from start to finish.

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:51.240
Interior gutted and
then probably two weeks

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.771
to crush the whole thing
with the excavators.

00:10:53.771 --> 00:10:55.387
- [Sam] What about a
small plane like a 737?

00:10:55.387 --> 00:10:58.190
- Oh, that one usually
takes about three days.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.250
- [Sam] Three days you
can reduce into that pile?

00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:01.225
- Yeah.
- Wow.

00:11:01.225 --> 00:11:03.650
(metal clanks)

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.483
Look at this.

00:11:04.483 --> 00:11:08.501
All this metal coming off
the plane, apart here.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.190
Can you believe the pile just behind me?

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.550
All these metal scrap are
from a MD-11 and a 737,

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.450
but can you believe the whole
big MD-11 wide-body aeroplane

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:22.371
and a 73 reduce to this
pile of metal scraps?

00:11:22.371 --> 00:11:25.454
(country rock music)

00:11:27.607 --> 00:11:32.607
Man, it's unbelievable seeing
two 747 landing gear here.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.853
They're like, way taller than me.

00:11:34.853 --> 00:11:36.113
Huge.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.180
Wow, look at this.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.680
A plane's hanged, the
engine's been taken out

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:47.070
'cause the engine is
the more valuable part

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.760
and it's so quiet here.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.660
All you can hear sometime is the wind

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.680
making the door bangs around

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.520
and also lots of birds flying around.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.020
The birds love sitting
on top of the fuselage.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.030
It's so quiet.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:02.460
I'm walking along and it's
quite freaky here, right.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:04.389
It be scary at times.

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:06.690
(feet crunch in sand)

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.150
Like an aircraft cemetery.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:11.320
Well, out of hundreds
and hundreds of planes,

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.470
perhaps this one is the
one I'm most attached with

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:17.660
because I first flew
a 747 was with United.

00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.130
This is an ex-United 747.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:21.450
Let me go inside.

00:12:21.450 --> 00:12:23.930
Let's look at the old girl one more time.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:24.947
Let's go inside her.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.360
This is United Global First section,

00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:32.793
with the carpet I recognise.

00:12:34.617 --> 00:12:36.200
- [Male Voice] Are you trying to get up?

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.734
- Yep, but it's a bit tricker
than the last one I climb

00:12:38.734 --> 00:12:40.973
because it's a bit to the side.

00:12:40.973 --> 00:12:44.470
Whew, oh my God.

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.810
They still have the seats here.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.643
- [Talaat] Yeah.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.860
- I remember sitting here,
trans-Pacific, many times.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.220
Whew, incredible.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.840
This was the business class section.

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:58.980
All the seats were taken out.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:00.530
Anyone want to buy a lavatory?

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:02.220
This one's probably used a million times

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:03.980
and travelled probably
a couple million miles

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:05.680
across the Pacific on United.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:06.750
Anyone still want it?

00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:08.706
- [Talaat] You're right, oh
my God, the economy plus--

00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:10.147
- I love these seats though.
- the seats are still here.

00:13:10.147 --> 00:13:11.340
- [Sam] I love the padding,

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.084
the padding's excellent on these seats.

00:13:13.084 --> 00:13:14.990
- [Talaat] Yeah, these
are really great seats.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:16.933
- [Sam] Okay, I can barely see here.

00:13:16.933 --> 00:13:18.643
It's still wrapped pretty good.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:21.380
Look at these 747 beams.

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:22.580
- [Talaat] Look it up, look up, look up.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.230
- [Sam] Look it up, oh.

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:26.820
The ceiling, look at that.

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.800
It has all the hullage

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.485
but the ceiling was missing on this part.

00:13:30.485 --> 00:13:32.200
(plastic crinkles)

00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:34.504
- [Talaat] Look at that, this
is how we used to watch TV.

00:13:34.504 --> 00:13:35.623
We used to watch just one.

00:13:35.623 --> 00:13:37.230
- [Sam] Look at this, yeah.

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:38.440
This became a better one.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.710
This became a LED kind of screen.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.510
Actually, this has value, I guess.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.653
Anyone want a free LED screen, come here.

00:13:44.653 --> 00:13:46.400
It's so dark here.

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.530
Scary.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.763
This is at the back of the United 7--

00:13:49.763 --> 00:13:51.100
(imitates ghost)

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.693
Oh, there's ghosts.

00:13:52.693 --> 00:13:54.653
This is aeroplane cemetery,

00:13:54.653 --> 00:13:58.373
so this guy here is a ghost
living on the United 747.

00:13:59.668 --> 00:14:01.500
- [Anthony] Yeah, I'm afraid of birds.

00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.750
- [Sam] You can see the bird
drops, the bird feather.

00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.880
They probably had a fight here.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:06.810
Look at all this bird.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.090
- Original United Airlines
business class seats.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.340
- [Sam] Wow.

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:12.880
- That's really sad--
- Have you seen this?

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:16.900
Whoa, this is like,
unbelievable, all the bird drops.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.620
The birds love United
business class seats.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:20.453
- [Anthony] Apparently.

00:14:20.453 --> 00:14:21.680
- Sam, take a look inside

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.860
and see where the birds are coming from.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:25.830
- [Sam] Oh, they're
coming from the cockpit.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.963
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:31.520
The cockpit's wide
open, there's no window.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.370
They took the window

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:34.956
and windshield off the
cockpits of the 400.

00:14:34.956 --> 00:14:38.039
(country rock music)

00:14:45.928 --> 00:14:48.113
- [Talaat] Stop stealing stuff.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.880
- So many planes in the storage.

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.980
Looking good out here.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.263
Oh, it's unreal.

00:14:56.263 --> 00:14:59.160
Look at all the panels were hanging out.

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.110
Look at the lights here, three hotel.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.979
Look at the ceiling, all the wires.

00:15:03.979 --> 00:15:07.720
Very interesting, never had
an experience like this.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:09.420
- [Talaat] This is the middle class

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.660
that United had on their later,
the last 400 configuration.

00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:15.580
Right in the middle,
between seats 1A and 1K.

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.420
- Are you going to serve us?

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:17.253
Come on, we're waiting.

00:15:17.253 --> 00:15:18.170
Where's my mimosa?

00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.040
- Yeah, I'd like this to be a replication

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.283
of United Airlines Royal Pacific service.

00:15:22.283 --> 00:15:26.620
Let's say San Francisco/Tokyo, flight 800.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.090
- [Talaat] Fortunately these guys,

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:30.510
they're the only people on this plane.

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:33.810
This is really, really,
very, very, very funny

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:35.120
and there's a hole right here.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:37.102
So, this is the only way out.

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:39.935
(machinery beeps)

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:43.170
- We just saw those guys

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.805
took a lot of the seats out of this 777.

00:15:45.805 --> 00:15:48.450
See those blue colour
seats on the trailer?

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:51.339
Now, we're going to see
a 777-200 in storage.

00:15:51.339 --> 00:15:54.422
(country rock music)

00:15:56.851 --> 00:15:59.210
I just got inside a 777, the widest one.

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:01.559
This is actually ex-Russian, VIM airline,

00:16:01.559 --> 00:16:03.480
V-I-M, VIM Airline.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.830
You can see the avionic bay.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:06.420
Everything's pulled out here.

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:07.844
Old MT on the shelf.

00:16:07.844 --> 00:16:09.650
What kind of stuff you're
taking out of the plane?

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:11.000
- We're working on the chairs right now.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.740
- [Sam] Wow, chairs.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:13.770
All right, save me a pair.

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:14.603
I need one of them.

00:16:14.603 --> 00:16:16.205
- (laughs) You got it.

00:16:16.205 --> 00:16:19.288
(country rock music)

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.140
- So, I just found their flight
manuals here in the cupboard

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.330
and I'm looking at the
runway configuration

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.970
for going to Bologna, Italy.

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:40.803
(paper shuffles)

00:16:40.803 --> 00:16:41.636
Oh there, safety cards.
- Safety cards.

00:16:41.636 --> 00:16:43.270
- Oh, wow.
- Boeing 777-200.

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:44.690
- VIM Airlines.
- VIM Airlines.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.620
- I actually feel like

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.970
I'm in the cockpit flying the aircraft.

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:50.823
Oh, look, I think I just got
a call from the cabin staff.

00:16:50.823 --> 00:16:51.656
(laughs)

00:16:51.656 --> 00:16:53.500
Yes, hey, yeah, this is Anthony.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.563
Going to be a little
bit of turbulence here.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:59.468
- This guy's done too much
Pan Am Experience casting.

00:16:59.468 --> 00:17:01.530
He's really acting well.

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:02.363
Well, I'll tell you what,

00:17:02.363 --> 00:17:04.300
you probably recognise these seats.

00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:08.209
These were Scoot before
they gave it VIM Airline.

00:17:08.209 --> 00:17:10.600
This is originally Singapore Airlines,

00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:13.610
then they gave it to their
low-cast subsidiary, Scoot,

00:17:13.610 --> 00:17:15.260
then they have this 2-4-2.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.840
Ever wonder how wide a 777 cabin is?

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.960
There you go, you see how wide it is.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:21.570
10 abreast, no problem.

00:17:21.570 --> 00:17:24.648
So wide, it's unbelievable
when you strip off the seats.

00:17:24.648 --> 00:17:27.110
- Sam, may I offer you a beverage?

00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:30.020
- [Sam] Whoa, this beverage
been there for 10 years.

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.700
- I know, I love it 'cause I found a tray

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:35.760
and tray liners with the logo on it

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:37.850
and this fantastic container.

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:41.440
- [Sam] Yeah, wow, VIM
Airlines logo everywhere.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.918
That's a gold found,
you struck gold Anthony.

00:17:43.918 --> 00:17:44.751
- I know.

00:17:44.751 --> 00:17:46.120
So, you'll notice when you actually take

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.220
a sidewall panel off of an aeroplane,

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.550
it's just this aluminium
skin on the outside.

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:54.360
There's not a whole lot of
space between the passenger seat

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.660
and this actual exterior of the aircraft.

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.470
It's kind of scary when
you think about it.

00:17:58.470 --> 00:18:01.337
The VIM 777, I actually never
even seen the aeroplane.

00:18:01.337 --> 00:18:02.980
That's actually what it looked like

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:04.740
when it was in operation.

00:18:04.740 --> 00:18:06.230
- Yep, that's the VIM colour.

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.930
I have flown on VIM Airline.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:08.763
- What?

00:18:08.763 --> 00:18:10.480
- I didn't fly 777 though.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.530
You know what aeroplane I flew

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.680
on VIM airline?
- Which one?

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.640
- It's my very first Ilyushin 62.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.990
- Oh my God, you're right.
- Four engines.

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.413
- That's fantastic.
- Yeah.

00:18:18.413 --> 00:18:19.246
(laughs)

00:18:19.246 --> 00:18:20.470
- Russia, oh my God.
- How's that?

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:21.303
- [Anthony] Just when I think

00:18:21.303 --> 00:18:23.060
I can't be more jealous
of all your flying,

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:24.964
then you share things like that with me.

00:18:24.964 --> 00:18:27.982
(country rock music)

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:31.110
- [Sam] Now, these are the
tightest legroom ever seen.

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:33.530
There is no way even
getting in there probably.

00:18:33.530 --> 00:18:35.870
You can only do it horizontally, I think.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.130
- Okay, look, I got safety
cards, a VIM magazine,

00:18:39.130 --> 00:18:44.130
but the best, look, tray liners and tray.

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.973
Can you believe it?

00:18:44.973 --> 00:18:46.350
Look at this.

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:47.800
- Oh my.
- So excited.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.620
- Sam, I bought this aeroplane

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:51.990
and I bought it for my
studio, Air Hollywood,

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.340
and right now this entire aeroplane,

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.840
I promise you, next year
you're going to see a movie,

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.010
it's going to come out

00:18:58.010 --> 00:19:00.410
and it's going to see the
entire thing in the movie.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.830
And we'll show you this soon.

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:02.820
- Are you kidding me?

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:04.800
You bought a 777 just like that?

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.633
- Yeah, we did.

00:19:05.633 --> 00:19:06.466
We're going to take it apart.
- Wow.

00:19:06.466 --> 00:19:07.770
- We're going to take it apart

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:08.840
and then put it back together

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.990
and we're going to start filming.

00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:11.100
We're going to be filming soon.

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:12.070
- I'm so happy

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:15.170
because you bought a plane
from the aeroplane cemetery.

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:17.540
You saved one aeroplane out of here

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.660
and bring them alive for
many more people to enjoy.

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.193
That's a great deed.
- Thank you.

00:19:22.193 --> 00:19:23.830
- I think you're a high
roller, man. (laughs)

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:25.150
- Thank you, so much.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.010
- Right here.

00:19:26.010 --> 00:19:27.090
Get all these curtains,

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.600
and this is an entire aeroplane,

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.730
bringing 'em to Air Hollywood.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:30.650
We're going to use these

00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:33.320
for any other airline
replication that I want to do.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.418
They're fantastic.

00:19:34.418 --> 00:19:35.530
- [Sam] They look amazing.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:39.560
- Oh, my God, what do I have
to do to deal with this?

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.393
oh my God.

00:19:40.393 --> 00:19:42.200
- [Anthony] Please, get all of them.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.443
Every single one.
- oh my God.

00:19:43.443 --> 00:19:45.857
I think I'm going to put
you in here, that's it.

00:19:45.857 --> 00:19:49.134
- Hey, guys, let's go home kids.

00:19:49.134 --> 00:19:50.740
You need to get out.

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:51.573
- [Anthony] We're coming.

00:19:51.573 --> 00:19:54.100
- Whoa, this is a chair lift.

00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:56.220
Wow, this is a forklift.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.120
And this is the way to get
out of a 777 with no stairs,

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:01.560
there's their forklift.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.801
See you guys next time.

00:20:02.801 --> 00:20:05.884
