00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.850
This video is about my bushcraft cutting
board which can also be used as a small

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.570
table or stool all my videos are
interconnected and if you follow my

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.980
channel you might have seen spoilers
about my tar distillery and this end

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.340
grain cutting board with legs but in
this video I'll provide more details end

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.010
grain cutting boards not only look good
but they are also easy on knives a

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.610
typical end grain board is good from
small segments of wood which prevents it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.559
from cracking when it undergoes multiple
drying cycles however my bushcraft

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.460
cutting board will be used at my
campsite and I decided to make it look

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.579
massive and crude you don't even need
the table for it in fact you can use it

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.710
as a table through is a black aspen tree
that fell near my log cabin last winter

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.020
I liked the way the wood looked so I used it to make my shaving horse some of my

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:10.770
cabin's furniture and this very cutting
board even though this aspen fell last

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.560
winter and was no longer attached to its
roots it still grew some leaves this

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:26.070
means moisture was evaporating all this
time there was no rain during the last

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.090
month and the grass is all dry now all
these is actually good because the log

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:41.970
should be fairly dry I cut an excellent
10-inch (25 cm) thick segment out of it

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.860
from a bushcraft cutting board
however aesthetically it looked rather

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.549
bulky to preserve its massiveness and
heavy duty nature I cut a taper into the

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:01.049
board using a string as a guide I
tapered the edges quite radically yet

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.189
the remaining thickness of the material
was enough to drill out holes for the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:12.000
legs I use
a generator to power my side grinder for

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.849
running out the tapered portion of the
segment I decided to use crooked

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.040
branches to go along with the rugged
design each leg has to get tapered to

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.660
fit to the socket my shaving horse
wasn't ready at this point so I used a

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.690
regular chisel to carve them down it
wasn't an ideal tool and I could have

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.489
used a side grinder what I was saving on
gasoline from a generator to charge my

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:47.489
cameras' and drone's batteries I also
could have used my homemade draw knife

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:56.250
but again my shaving horse was not
complete yet the day before I started to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.180
make my tar distillery to produce tar
and rosin from oily pine roots I needed

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.280
rosin to glue the legs onto the aspen
segment to complete my cutting board

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.489
project please let me know if you have
an idea what can be done with tar and

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:23.670
rosin besides using them as an adhesive
and a water repellent okay I got enough

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.900
rosin and now we can start the gluing
process which is not different from

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:36.150
using any other glue once turpentine
evaporates from rosin it acts like a

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:47.880
strong adhesive and would hold the legs
in the sighted securely I made a mistake

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.579
in the process and one of the legs did
not pass my quality control of visual

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.540
appeal with great difficulty I managed
to pull it out thanks to Archimedes and

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:08.310
his invention of the lever
I replaced the leg with a less crooked

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:16.560
pine branch all that is left is to cut
the legs to size to make the structure

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.630
steady and functional
a blacksmith's rule of thumb for evil

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.070
making is applicable here when
establishing the height of the legs they

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.570
would make anvil to the height at which
your thumb hangs when you're standing

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.610
with your arms to your side I chose this
height for my cutting board because I

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:49.030
plan to slice food while standing or
sitting on a tall chair I'm using my

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.070
homemade frame saw to cut and shave down
the legs I like it so much that I have

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.480
been using it for just about every
project lately I guess I'll keep using

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:08.980
it till it gets boring I decided to make
the cutting board three legged because

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:15.130
no matter which terrain I put it on it
will always be steady after all it is a

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.810
bushcraft cutting board and it's not
easy finding a perfectly flat surface in

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:28.690
the outdoors to prevent staining and
absorption of moisture

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.860
I applied regular food grade oil onto
the cutting board surface

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:41.110
I should have applied it on its
underneath surface as well because

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:48.070
within one week it started to crack to
prevent further cracking I applied

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.410
leftover epoxy resin from my kayak
project onto the underneath surface of

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:00.730
the board now my cabin has a cutting
board that can also serve as a stool or

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:07.750
table all I have left to do is make a
permanent oven a bed a kitchen table and

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.880
chairs once these are completed I will
be able to visit and live in the log

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.570
cabin during the winter here is the
grace of nature's lines how do you like

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:23.999
the cutting board's curvy legs

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:28.919
if you liked this video perhaps you
could share it with your friends that

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:35.099
good people watch good videos this is

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:40.769
final note I only produce one or two
videos max a month and if you don't want
