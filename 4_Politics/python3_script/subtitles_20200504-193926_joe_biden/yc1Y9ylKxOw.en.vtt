BEAUTIFUL ED SULLIVAN THEATER
HERE IN MIDTOWN MANHATTAN.

00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:06.892
AND I CAN DO THAT BECAUSE  TODAY
MAY 1, THE FEDERAL STAY-AT-HOME

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.830 align:start position:0%
ORDER HAS BEEN LIFT LIFT
AND SINCE WE'RE GOVERNED BY THE

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:16.335 size:84% position:42%
THAT'S OLLY OLLY OXEN FREE.

00:02:16.368 --> 00:02:17.170
OF COURSE, I'M PLAYING IT SAFE
BY BEING A CARTOON, WHICH IS THE

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:20.106 align:start position:0%
ULTIMATE MASK.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:29.615 size:88% position:44%

YOU SOUND AMAZING.

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:44.764
I AM SO GLAD TO BE HERE, SINCE
LOCKDOWN I HAVE BEEN DREAMING

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:48.267 align:start position:0%
ABOUT DOING THE SHOW FROM THE ED
SULLIVAN.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.901 align:start position:0%
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.203 size:84% position:42%
MAYBE THIS IS JUST A DREAM.

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:58.511 align:start position:0%
HOLD ON, LET ME CHECK.

00:02:58.544 --> 00:02:59.212 align:start position:0%
NOPE.

00:02:59.245 --> 00:02:59.812 align:start position:0%
NOT WAKING UP.

00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
THIS MUST BE REAL LIFE.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.955 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Stephen: MOVING ON TO

00:03:13.158 --> 00:03:16.162 align:start position:0%
SOMETHING SLIGHTLY MORE
CARTOONISH, DONALD TRUMP.

00:03:16.195 --> 00:03:20.766
TRUMP'S POLL NUMBERS ARE GOING
DOWN THE TWEETING THRONE BECAUSE

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.803 size:88% position:44%
HE SO FRAGRANTLY SHANKED THE
RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS.

00:03:23.836 --> 00:03:26.038 align:start position:0%
FOR EXAMPLE, HIS SERIES OF
DISASTROUS PRESS CONFERENCES, IN

00:03:26.071 --> 00:03:32.912
WHICH HE SUGGESTED, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THAT PEOPLE SOMEHOW PUT

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:35.548 align:start position:0%
BLEACH IN THEIR BODES.

00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:39.452 align:start position:0%
OH, LET'S GIVE THAT A TRY,
OKAY, THAT'S A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

00:03:39.485 --> 00:03:40.519 align:start position:0%
LET'S FIX THAT.

00:03:40.552 --> 00:03:44.023 align:start position:0%
THERE YOU GO.

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:49.028 align:start position:0%
SO, TO CONTINUE HIS PERFECT
RECORD FOR NEVER TAKING

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:51.464 size:88% position:44%
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANYTHING,
TRUMP HAS STARTED A PUBLIC

00:03:51.497 --> 00:03:56.269 align:start position:0%
CAMPAIGN TO BLAME CHINA FOR THE
PANDEMIC.

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:58.504 align:start position:0%
<i> ( AS TRUMP )</i>
"I WANT TO SEE THE VIRUS'

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:01.274 size:88% position:44%
LONG-FORM BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

00:04:01.307 --> 00:04:03.576
I HAVE A FEELING IT'S FROM
CHINA, WHICH MANY ARE CALLING

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:06.712 align:start position:0%
'THE KENYA OF ASIA.'"
SPECIFICALLY, TRUMP HAS

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:10.116 size:81% position:41%
PRESSURED THE INTELLIGENCE
COMMUNITY FOR EVIDENCE TO

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.719 size:81% position:41%
SUPPORT AN UNSUBSTANTIATED
THEORY THAT A GOVERNMENT

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:15.354 size:84% position:42%
LABORATORY IN WUHAN WAS THE
ORIGIN OF THE CORONAVIRUS

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:18.090 align:start position:0%
OUTBREAK.

00:04:18.123 --> 00:04:22.194
I'VE SEEN THAT THEORY, TOO, FROM
MY SOURCE ON THE INTERNET, WHO

00:04:22.227 --> 00:04:23.763 align:start position:0%
ASSURES ME, "ERMAHGERD,
CERERNERVEHRUS CAME FROM A

00:04:23.796 --> 00:04:27.867 align:start position:0%
WUHERN LERB!"
BUT YESTERDAY, THE DIRECTOR OF

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.770 align:start position:0%
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE RELEASED A
STATEMENT SAYING, "THE

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:33.939 align:start position:0%
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY CONCURS
WITH THE WIDE SCIENTIFIC

00:04:33.972 --> 00:04:38.077 size:84% position:42%
CONSENSUS THAT THE COVID-19
VIRUS WAS NOT MANMADE OR

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.014 align:start position:0%
GENETICALLY MODIFIED."

00:04:42.047 --> 00:04:43.749
OH, "NOT GENETICALLY MODIFIED."

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
SO IT'S BETTER FOR YOU THAN
CORN?

00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:51.724 align:start position:0%
SCIENTIFIC CONSENSUS IS THAT
COVID 19 "BEGAN AS A BAT VIRUS."

00:04:51.757 --> 00:04:55.261
NO WORD YET ON HOW IT SPREAD TO
HUMANS, BUT SCIENTISTS THINK THE

00:04:55.294 --> 00:04:57.263 size:88% position:44%
LIKELY CULPRIT WAS THIS MAN.

00:04:57.296 --> 00:05:01.200 align:start position:0%

UPSIDE DOWN.

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:04.103 align:start position:0%
IT WAS PRETTY HOT."

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:09.175 size:75% position:38%
YESTERDAY, TRUMP SAID HE
BELIEVED THE WUHAN LAB

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.776 align:start position:0%
CONSPIRACY THEORY, AND THEN
REPORTERS PRESSED HIM ON WHY HE

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
BELIEVED THAT.

00:05:14.613 --> 00:05:18.551 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: MY QUESTION IS
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING AT THIS

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.052
POINT THAT GIVES YOU A HIGH
DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT THE

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:22.722 align:start position:0%
WUHAN INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGY WAS
THE SOURCE?

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:23.356 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES, I HAVE.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:24.323 align:start position:0%
YES, I HAVE.

00:05:24.356 --> 00:05:25.524 size:75% position:38%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YES, HE HAS.

00:05:25.557 --> 00:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
TRUMP LOOKED AT THE VIRUS UNDER
A MICROSCOPE AND SAW IT WAS

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:31.497 align:start position:0%
CLEARLY MADE IN CHINA.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:32.598 align:start position:0%
THE REPORTER PRESSED HIM
FURTHER.

00:05:32.631 --> 00:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHAT GIVES YOU A HIGH
DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT THIS

00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:37.203 size:78% position:39%
ORIGINATED FROM THE WUHAN
INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGY?

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:37.970 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.

00:05:38.004 --> 00:05:40.172 align:start position:0%
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO TELL YOU
THAT.

00:05:40.205 --> 00:05:42.341 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: (AS TRUMP)
"I COULD TELL YOU, BUT THEN I'D

00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:45.511 align:start position:0%
HAVE TO KILL YOU.

00:05:45.544 --> 00:05:49.448 align:start position:0%
PROBABLY WITH THE VIRUS I'M NOT
TAKING SERIOUSLY."

00:05:49.481 --> 00:05:50.549 align:start position:0%
AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "YOU'RE
NOT ALLOWED TO"?

00:05:50.582 --> 00:05:51.483 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE THE PRESIDENT.

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:54.320 align:start position:0%
ANYTHING YOU SAY IS INSTANTLY
DECLASSIFIED.

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.722 align:start position:0%
<i> ( AS TRUMP )</i>
"LOOK, I'D LOVE TO TELL YOU, BUT

00:05:56.755 --> 00:05:57.790 align:start position:0%
MY BOSS WOULD KILL ME.

00:05:57.823 --> 00:06:03.028 align:start position:0%
AGAIN, WITH THE VIRUS I'M NOT
TAKING SERIOUSLY."

00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:04.997
TRUMP MADE THESE COMMENTS AT AN
EVENT ABOUT PROTECTING SENIORS,

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.734 align:start position:0%
A GROUP HE'S NOT SURE HE
BELONGS TO.

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:12.405
&gt;&gt; THIS AFTERNOON, I'LL SIGN A
PROCLAMATION DECLARING THE MONTH

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:15.474 align:start position:0%
OF MAY TO BE "OLDER AMERICANS
MONTH."

00:06:15.507 --> 00:06:19.278 align:start position:0%
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M IN THAT
CATEGORY.

00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:19.779 align:start position:0%
I HAVE A FEELING I AM.

00:06:19.812 --> 00:06:21.847 align:start position:0%
BUT I FEEL GOOD.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.718 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen:  THE I'M PRETTY
SURE BEING CONFUSED ABOUT

00:06:25.751 --> 00:06:30.623 align:start position:0%
WHETHER YOU BELONG IN THE "OLDER
AMERICANS"

00:06:30.656 --> 00:06:32.291 align:start position:0%
CATEGORY MEANS YOU BELONG IN THE
"OLDER AMERICANS" CATEGORY.

00:06:32.324 --> 00:06:33.526 align:start position:0%
TRUMP ALSO WEIGHED IN ON THE
CHARACTER OF HIS OLD PAL GENERAL

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:36.962 align:start position:0%
MICHAEL FLYNN.

00:06:36.995 --> 00:06:37.763 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; I THINK HE IS A FINE MAN.

00:06:37.796 --> 00:06:39.632 align:start position:0%
I THINK HE HAS GOT A GREAT
FAMILY.

00:06:39.665 --> 00:06:43.836 align:start position:0%
HE LOVES HIS SON.

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:45.671
I WILL TELL YOU, HIS SON WAS
AROUND A LOT, AND HE LOVES HIS

00:06:45.704 --> 00:06:46.705 size:88% position:44%
SON, AS PEOPLE GENERALLY DO.

00:06:46.739 --> 00:06:49.241 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: (AS TRUMP)
"PEOPLE GENERALLY LOVE THEIR

00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:53.879 align:start position:0%
SONS BUT, OF COURSE, THERE IS AN
ERIC TO EVERY RULE."

00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:56.615 align:start position:0%
TRUMP DESPERATELY MISSES HIS
RALLIES.

00:06:56.648 --> 00:06:59.585
SO ON SUNDAY, HE'S PLANNING WHAT
HE HOPES IS THE NEXT BEST THING.

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:05.057
"A TWO-HOUR EVENT ON EMERGING
FROM THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.593
LIVE FROM THE LINCOLN MEMORIAL."

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:11.530
I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE
APPROPRIATE THAN STANDING IN

00:07:11.563 --> 00:07:14.967
FRONT OF LINCOLN MEMORY ALTHOUGH
SAYING, STATES CAN DO WHATEVER

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.401 align:start position:0%
THEY WANT.

00:07:15.434 --> 00:07:19.305 align:start position:0%
IT'S UP TO THEM.

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:25.544
THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING IT IN
FRONT OF A MAN FROZEN IN STONE,

00:07:25.577 --> 00:07:30.916 align:start position:0%
INDOORS, SITTING IN A CHAIR FOR
ALL ETERNITY."

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:37.490
WE HAVEN'T HEARD A LOT FROM THE
PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:41.694 align:start position:0%
AND NATIONAL TOOTH PRESERVE, JOE
BIDEN.

00:07:41.727 --> 00:07:44.630
HE HAS BEEN SILENT ABOUT THE
SEXUAL ASSAULT CHARGES MADE BY

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:49.134 align:start position:0%
TARA READE.

00:07:49.167 --> 00:07:54.173
HE TOLD WANT ASSOCIATED PRESS,
WHEN SHE WORKED FORED BY NEN

00:07:54.206 --> 00:07:56.675
1993, HE RUBBED HER SHOULDERS
AND NECK AND PLAYED WITH HER

00:07:56.708 --> 00:07:57.943 align:start position:0%
HAIR.

00:07:57.976 --> 00:08:02.848
NOW, THAT WOULD BE WRONG EVEN IF
HE WERE HER HAIRDRESSER, UNLESS

00:08:02.881 --> 00:08:06.218 align:start position:0%
HE WORKED AT SUPER UNCOMFORTABLE
CUT.

00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:13.425
BUT IN A RECENT PODCAST, READE
TOOK THE ALLEGATIONS FURTHER,

00:08:13.458 --> 00:08:15.995
