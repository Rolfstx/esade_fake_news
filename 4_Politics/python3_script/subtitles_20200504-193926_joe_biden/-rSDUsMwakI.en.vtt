00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:09.942

PROVE ME WRONG!

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:38.471

IF YOU CAN SWING IT.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:40.940
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:41.574
BECAUSE IT CAN FEED

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.209

00:05:44.277 --> 00:05:45.645
AND HE IS NOT NORMAL.

00:05:45.645 --> 00:05:47.447
HE IS ABNORMAL.

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:51.818
HE IS A HUMAN "WHAT IS WRONG

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:52.652
WITH THIS PICTURE?"

00:05:52.652 --> 00:05:53.786
HE STICKS OUT LIKE A SORE THUMB

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:54.420
AND FRANKLY HE EVEN LOOKS LIKE

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.555
A SORE THUMB.

00:05:55.555 --> 00:05:56.923
SO GIVING HIM A CHANCE

00:05:56.923 --> 00:05:58.057
IN THE SENSE OF NOT SPEAKING OUT

00:05:58.057 --> 00:05:59.292
IMMEDIATELY AGAINST POLICIES

00:05:59.292 --> 00:06:01.060
HE'S PROPOSED IS DANGEROUS.

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.195
BECAUSE SOME OF THEM

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:03.863
ARE ALARMING.

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:04.897
&gt;&gt; JUST SOME OF TRUMP'S

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:06.599
PROMISES: REPEAL AND REPLACE

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.168
OBAMACARE, BUILD A WALL ALONG

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:10.403
THE SOUTHERN BORDER WITH MEXICO

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.305
AND GET MEXICO TO PAY FOR

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:14.240
SAID WALL, DEPORT ALL

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.608
11 TO 12 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:17.143
IMMIGRANTS IN THIS COUNTRY,

00:06:17.143 --> 00:06:17.877
INCLUDING CHILDREN,

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.412
APPOINT A SPECIAL PROSECUTOR

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:20.413
TO INVESTIGATE

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:21.614
AND POTENTIALLY JAIL

00:06:21.614 --> 00:06:23.149
HILLARY CLINTON,

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:25.151
TEMPORARILY BAN MUSLIMS

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:26.419
AND IMMIGRANTS FROM TERROR-PRONE

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:27.553
NATIONS FROM COMING INTO

00:06:27.553 --> 00:06:29.655
THE UNITED STATES.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:31.891
&gt;&gt; John: OKAY, STOP.

00:06:31.891 --> 00:06:33.025
BECAUSE IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:33.693
READING THE TO-DO LIST

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:35.695
ON SATAN'S REFRIGERATOR,

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:36.763
WHICH, OF COURSE,

00:06:36.763 --> 00:06:37.930
SATAN NO LONGER NEEDS

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.033
NOW THAT HELL HAS FROZEN OVER.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:42.368
AND WHILE SOME ARE ARGUING

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:43.503
TRUMP MIGHT NOT HAVE MEANT

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:44.470
ALL THOSE THINGS,

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.138
THAT LEAVES US WITH

00:06:45.138 --> 00:06:46.873
TWO DEVASTATING OPTIONS:

00:06:46.873 --> 00:06:47.940
EITHER WE JUST ELECTED

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.142
A PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T MEAN

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:50.543
A SINGLE WORD HE SAID

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:53.212
OR WE ELECTED ONE WHO DID.

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:53.679
AND IT'S IMPOSSIBLE

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.047
TO KNOW WHICH ONE.

00:06:55.047 --> 00:06:55.715
EARLIER TONIGHT,

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:57.350
HE DID HIS FIRST MAJOR

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.351
POST-ELECTION INTERVIEW

00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:59.886
AND WAS ASKED ABOUT OBAMACARE

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:01.721
WHICH, REMEMBER, HE HAD LABELED

00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:03.456
A DISASTER.

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:04.891
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU REPLACE IT,

00:07:04.891 --> 00:07:06.526
ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE SURE

00:07:06.526 --> 00:07:08.628
THAT PEOPLE WITH PRE-CONDITIONS

00:07:08.628 --> 00:07:09.495
ARE STILL COVERED?

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:10.196
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:07:10.196 --> 00:07:11.330
BECAUSE IT HAPPENS TO BE

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.999
ONE OF THE STRONGEST ASSETS.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:13.566
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP IT?

00:07:13.566 --> 00:07:14.200
&gt;&gt; ALSO WITH THE CHILDREN

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.301
LIVING WITH THEIR PARENTS

00:07:15.301 --> 00:07:16.235
FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD,

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:17.303
WE'RE GOING TO...

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:18.137
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT?

00:07:18.137 --> 00:07:19.806
&gt;&gt; VERY MUCH TRY AND KEEP THAT.

00:07:19.806 --> 00:07:20.773
&gt;&gt; John: OKAY.

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:21.874
GET READY FOR A BARELY CHANGED

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:23.543
VERSION OF OBAMACARE CALLED

00:07:23.543 --> 00:07:25.678
"TRUMPCARE," WHICH SOUNDS LIKE

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:26.679
A HEALTH CARE PLAN WHERE

00:07:26.679 --> 00:07:27.814
DOCTORS FEEL YOUR BREASTS

00:07:27.814 --> 00:07:29.348
FOR LUMPS WHETHER YOU ASKED THEM

00:07:29.348 --> 00:07:32.518
TO OR NOT.

00:07:32.518 --> 00:07:34.220
BUT DON'T GET COMPLACENT

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:34.887
THAT HE'S GOING TO KEEP

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:36.789
THOSE ASPECTS OF OBAMACARE.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:37.590
HE MIGHT CHANGE HIS MIND

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:42.195
ON THAT AGAIN.

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:43.062
TRUMP IS LIKE A MAGIC 8 BALL.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:43.896
EVERY TIME YOU SHAKE HIM

00:07:43.896 --> 00:07:44.831
HE GIVES YOU A DIFFERENT ANSWER

00:07:44.831 --> 00:07:45.598
AND SOMETIMES THE ANSWER

00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:46.399
IS JUST "BIG LEAGUE"

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.700
OR "THAT'S SOME BODY

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.802
ON MY DAUGHTER, RIGHT?"

00:07:49.802 --> 00:07:50.670
SO WE HAVE TO TAKE ALL OF

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.839
TRUMP'S PROMISES SERIOUSLY.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.106
AND THE TRUTH IS,

00:07:54.106 --> 00:07:56.943
THEY WERE NOT UNIVERSALLY BAD.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:07:57.476
FOR INSTANCE,

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:58.678
HE RAN ON A PROMISE

00:07:58.678 --> 00:07:59.912
TO "DRAIN THE SWAMP,"

00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.147
CRACKING DOWN ON CORRUPTION

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:01.781
AND ENDING THE REIGN OF

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:03.583
WASHINGTON INSIDERS,

00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:04.617
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT.

00:08:04.617 --> 00:08:07.286
SO LET'S TRY AND BE POSITIVE.

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:08.287
WHAT ARE THE EARLY SIGNS

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:09.789
ON THAT?

00:08:09.789 --> 00:08:10.690
&gt;&gt; SOME OF THE POTENTIAL CABINET

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.226
MEMBERS BEING REPORTED BY CNN

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:14.627
THAT ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:15.795
RUDY GIULIANI, NEWT GINGRICH,

00:08:15.795 --> 00:08:21.968
CHRIS CHRISTIE, REINCE PRIEBUS.

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:22.668
&gt;&gt; John: RIGHT.

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:23.269
SO THAT'S

00:08:23.269 --> 00:08:23.970
THE LONG-TIME HEAD OF THE RNC,

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:25.104
A FORMER SPEAKER WHO ENTERED

00:08:25.104 --> 00:08:26.172
CONGRESS IN 1979,

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:27.573
A FORMER MAYOR TURNED

00:08:27.573 --> 00:08:29.609
PROFESSIONAL ASSHOLE,

00:08:29.609 --> 00:08:30.877
AND A MAN WHOSE NAME IS MORE

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:33.012
SYNONYMOUS WITH SCANDAL

00:08:33.012 --> 00:08:35.181
THAN SHONDA FUCKING RHIMES.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.716
THAT'S SO SWAMPY,

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:37.416
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO SWAP OUT

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:38.951
AIR FORCE ONE FOR ONE OF THOSE

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:40.386
SHALLOW-BOTTOM BOATS

00:08:40.386 --> 00:08:43.256
WITH A BIG FAN ON THE BACK.

00:08:43.256 --> 00:08:44.557
AND IT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:45.591
FOR TRUMP TO APPOINT PEOPLE

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.993
WITH SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:48.160
IN GOVERNMENT.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.161
UNTIL A FEW DAYS AGO,

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:49.862
THE HIGHEST OFFICE

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.130
HE'D EVER HELD WAS ON

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.565
THE 26TH FLOOR OF

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:53.199
A SHITTY BUILDING

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.234
ON FIFTH AVENUE.

00:08:55.234 --> 00:08:56.269
BUT SOME OF THE PEOPLE

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:58.604
HE'S BRINGING IN ARE HORRIFYING.

00:08:58.604 --> 00:08:59.305
HIS TRANSITION TEAM

00:08:59.305 --> 00:09:00.039
INCLUDES PEOPLE LIKE

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:01.374
KEN BLACKWELL,

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.842
WHO'S ARGUED THAT HOMOSEXUALITY

00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:04.677
IS A CHOICE, AND HE'S NAMED

00:09:04.677 --> 00:09:06.412
MYRON EBELL TO LEAD HIS EPA

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:08.014
TRANSITION TEAM, MAKING HIM

00:09:08.014 --> 00:09:10.149
A FRONTRUNNER FOR ADMINISTRATOR,

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:12.084
DESPITE THIS...

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:13.853
&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE CASE FOR GLOBAL

00:09:13.853 --> 00:09:15.621
WARMING I BELIEVE IS SILLY,

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:17.423
AND I BELIEVE THE VAST MAJORITY

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:19.492
OF SCIENTISTS THINK IT'S SILLY,

00:09:19.492 --> 00:09:20.760
AND THEREFORE I'M A LITTLE BIT

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.395
EMBARRASSED THAT I WASTE MY TIME

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:27.300
ON A SILLY ISSUE.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.035
&gt;&gt; John: OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,

00:09:29.035 --> 00:09:29.936
THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCIENTISTS

00:09:29.936 --> 00:09:30.569
BELIEVE HUMANS ARE CONTRIBUTING

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:30.970
TO CLIMATE CHANGE.

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.804
SECONDLY, THIS MAN DOES NOT HAVE

00:09:31.804 --> 00:09:33.072
A SCIENCE DEGREE.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.140
HE WOULDN'T EVEN BE QUALIFIED

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.374
TO HEAD THE AGENCY

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:38.678
OF BAKING SODA VOLCANOES.

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:41.314
SO HOW THE FUCK DID WE GET HERE?

00:09:41.314 --> 00:09:42.248
WELL, CLEARLY, THERE ARE MANY

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:43.082
POSSIBLE ANSWERS

00:09:43.082 --> 00:09:44.417
TO THAT QUESTION,

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:45.384
INCLUDING MISLEADING

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:47.386
FORECASTS THAT BRED COMPLACENCY,

00:09:47.386 --> 00:09:48.988
A FLAWED CANDIDATE WHO FAILED

00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:50.256
TO APPEAL TO WHITE RURAL

00:09:50.256 --> 00:09:52.058
AND WORKING-CLASS VOTERS,

00:09:52.058 --> 00:09:52.758
AND -- AND THIS IS

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:53.859
WORTH REPEATING --

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.695
DEEP RACISM AND/OR INDIFFERENCE

00:09:55.695 --> 00:09:56.729
TO IT.

00:09:56.729 --> 00:09:58.898
AND FOR THOSE, INCLUDING US,

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.599
WHO WERE SHOCKED BY TUESDAY,

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:01.968
WE'RE GOING TO BE EXAMINING

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:02.702
ALL OF THIS FOR YEARS.

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:03.970
BUT FOR TONIGHT, LET'S LOOK

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.305
AT ONE NARROW ELEMENT THAT

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:07.273
MAY HAVE HELPED BRING US HERE,

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:08.641
BECAUSE IT WILL BE IMPORTANT

00:10:08.641 --> 00:10:11.010
GOING FORWARD:

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:11.877
THAT IS OUR MEDIA.

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:12.812
SPECIFICALLY, HOW A SYSTEM

00:10:12.812 --> 00:10:13.679
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO CATCH

00:10:13.679 --> 00:10:15.715
A SERIAL LIAR FAILED.

00:10:15.715 --> 00:10:16.682
AND I'M NOT JUST REFERRING

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:18.284
TO MAINSTREAM TV NEWS,

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:19.118
ALTHOUGH SOME DID WAIT

00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.553
FAR TOO LONG TO TAKE TRUMP

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:22.321
SERIOUSLY, GIVING HIM BILLIONS

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.124
OF DOLLARS' WORTH OF FREE MEDIA.

00:10:25.124 --> 00:10:27.093
CNN SOMETIMES RAN HIS SPEECHES

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:29.462
ALMOST IN THEIR ENTIRETY,

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.663
AND THEIR PRESIDENT JEFF ZUCKER

00:10:30.663 --> 00:10:32.398
NOW ADMITS THAT MIGHT NOT HAVE

00:10:32.398 --> 00:10:34.200
BEEN A GOOD IDEA.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.634
&gt;&gt; I'D SAY THAT IF WE MADE

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:39.138
A MISTAKE LAST YEAR, IT'S THAT

00:10:39.138 --> 00:10:40.773
WE PROBABLY DID PUT ON TOO MANY

00:10:40.773 --> 00:10:44.777
OF HIS CAMPAIGN RALLIES IN THOSE

00:10:44.777 --> 00:10:49.982
EARLY MONTHS, UNEDITED

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:51.417
AND JUST LET THEM RUN.

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:52.451
AND I THINK, IN HINDSIGHT,

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:53.386
WE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE

00:10:53.386 --> 00:10:55.755
THAT AS MUCH.

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:56.555
&gt;&gt; John: YEAH.

00:10:56.555 --> 00:10:57.523
IT TURNS OUT HINDSIGHT,

00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:58.624
MUCH LIKE THE YEAR WE'RE ALL

00:10:58.624 --> 00:10:59.992
NOW DESPERATELY LOOKING FORWARD

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:04.497
TO, IS 20/20.

00:11:04.497 --> 00:11:06.465
AND THAT'S NOT TO SAY THERE

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:07.133
WASN'T SOME GREAT COVERAGE

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.234
OF TRUMP IN THIS ELECTION,

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:08.834
FROM OUTLETS LIKE

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:09.502
THE WASHINGTON POST

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:11.003
AND THE NEW YORK TIMES.

00:11:11.003 --> 00:11:12.905
EVEN CNN EVENTUALLY PIVOTED

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.607
AND BEGAN CORRECTING TRUMP IN

00:11:14.607 --> 00:11:16.042
LOWER-THIRD GRAPHICS, SUCH AS:

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.710
"TRUMP: I NEVER SAID JAPAN

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.411
SHOULD HAVE NUKES.

00:11:18.411 --> 00:11:20.279
PARENTHESIS, HE DID."

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.481
AND THAT'S GOOD JOURNALISM.

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:23.682
IF I GAVE A SPEECH SAYING

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:25.051
I'M THE SEXIEST MAN ALIVE,

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:25.985
IT WOULD BE FAIR TO TAG

00:11:25.985 --> 00:11:26.652
THAT WITH

00:11:26.652 --> 00:11:35.294
"PARENTHESIS, LOOK AT HIM."

00:11:35.294 --> 00:11:37.997
THAT'S A MEAN JOKE TO LAUGH AT.

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:38.898
THE PROBLEM IS, THE IMPACT

00:11:38.898 --> 00:11:39.698
OF CORRECTIONS LIKE THAT

00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:40.399
WHICH MIGHT HAVE SUNK

00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.100
A CANDIDATE IN ANOTHER ERA

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:41.934
WAS COMPROMISED.

00:11:41.934 --> 00:11:43.069
BECAUSE THERE IS NO LONGER

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:45.671
A CONSENSUS ON WHAT A FACT IS.

00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:47.239
TRUST IN MAINSTREAM MEDIA

00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:48.374
OUTLETS HAS BEEN FALLING,

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:49.041
AND PEOPLE CAN CHOOSE TO GET

00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:50.609
THEIR NEWS FROM ECHO CHAMBERS

00:11:50.609 --> 00:11:51.944
THAT VALIDATE THEIR VIEWS.

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:53.112
AND THERE'S NOTHING INHERENTLY

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:54.447
WRONG WITH MEDIA THAT HAS

00:11:54.447 --> 00:11:55.347
A VIEWPOINT.

00:11:55.347 --> 00:11:56.982
THIS SHOW HAS A VIEWPOINT.

00:11:56.982 --> 00:11:58.551
WE FACT-CHECK EVERYTHING WE SAY,

00:11:58.551 --> 00:11:59.785
BUT I DON'T PRETEND TO BE

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:00.453
NEUTRAL ON THINGS LIKE

00:12:00.453 --> 00:12:02.054
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM --

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:03.055
I'M FOR IT,

00:12:03.055 --> 00:12:03.923
COLDPLAY --

00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:05.891
I'M AGAINST IT,

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:07.293
OR DEWALT LADDERS --

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:08.127
THEY'RE A SEAMLESS BLEND

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:09.795
OF STYLE AND PERFORMANCE.

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:10.629
WALKING UP ONE IS LIKE ASCENDING

00:12:10.629 --> 00:12:13.032
TO HEAVEN ON A GOLDEN CLOUD.

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:14.667
I'M NOT BEING PAID TO SAY THAT.

00:12:14.667 --> 00:12:17.570
I'M JUST A FAN.

00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.405
BUT A HEALTHY MEDIA DIET

00:12:19.405 --> 00:12:21.173
HAS TO BE BROADER.

00:12:21.173 --> 00:12:21.640
UNFORTUNATELY, THE WAY

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.409
MANY OF US CONSUME NEWS NOW

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:25.444
IS MICRO-TARGETED.

00:12:25.444 --> 00:12:26.846
&gt;&gt; THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS,

00:12:26.846 --> 00:12:28.747
62%, SAY THEY GET THEIR NEWS

00:12:28.747 --> 00:12:29.448
FROM SOCIAL MEDIA,

00:12:29.448 --> 00:12:30.716
ACCORDING TO PEW RESEARCH.

00:12:30.716 --> 00:12:32.918
44% OF ALL ADULTS SAY THEY GET

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:35.287
NEWS SPECIFICALLY FROM FACEBOOK.

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:36.188
&gt;&gt; John: IT'S TRUE.

00:12:36.188 --> 00:12:37.456
NEWS IS NOW ONE OF THE THREE

00:12:37.456 --> 00:12:38.524
THINGS WE GET FROM SOCIAL MEDIA,

00:12:38.524 --> 00:12:40.226
THE OTHER TWO BEING OUR ENTIRE

00:12:40.226 --> 00:12:41.560
SENSE OF SELF-WORTH

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:45.030
AND PICTURES OF SHAVED ALPACAS.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:46.499
AND FAKE FACTS CIRCULATE

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:47.733
ON SOCIAL MEDIA

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:49.135
TO A FRIGHTENING EXTENT.

00:12:49.135 --> 00:12:50.269
YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS QUOTE

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:51.837
FROM DONALD TRUMP ONLINE

00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:53.472
ABOUT REPUBLICANS BEING DUMB.

00:12:53.472 --> 00:12:55.174
HE NEVER SAID THAT.

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:56.509
IT'S NOT TRUE.

00:12:56.509 --> 00:12:57.176
JUST AS IT'S NOT TRUE THAT

00:12:57.176 --> 00:13:00.212
THE POPE ENDORSED TRUMP.

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:01.147
OF COURSE HE DIDN'T.

00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:02.314
BUT THAT STORY WAS SHARED

00:13:02.314 --> 00:13:03.716
ALMOST A MILLION TIMES,

00:13:03.716 --> 00:13:04.750
WHICH IS ABSURD.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.252
EVERYONE KNOWS THE CANDIDATE

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:07.887
THE POPE ENDORSED

00:13:07.887 --> 00:13:09.388
WAS JOE EXOTIC.

00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:11.991
THEY HAVE VERY SIMILAR VIEWS

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:14.560
ON DEREGULATING TIGER PRESERVES.

00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.294
PLEASE SHARE THIS NEWS

00:13:15.294 --> 00:13:17.596
A MILLION TIMES.

00:13:17.596 --> 00:13:18.898
THERE'S NOW A WHOLE COTTAGE

00:13:18.898 --> 00:13:20.366
INDUSTRY SPECIALIZING IN

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.834
HYPER-PARTISAN, SOMETIMES

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:23.836
WILDLY DISTORTED CLICKBAIT.

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:25.137
BUZZFEED NEWS RESEARCHED

00:13:25.137 --> 00:13:27.072
SITES LIKE ADDICTING INFO

00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:28.941
ON THE LEFT AND FREEDOM DAILY

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:30.609
ON THE RIGHT, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.211
OVER A MILLION FOLLOWERS ON

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:33.212
FACEBOOK, PUTTING THEM

00:13:33.212 --> 00:13:34.246
IN THE SAME RANGE AS

00:13:34.246 --> 00:13:36.081
ANDERSON COOPER 360

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:37.983
AND FOUND THEM TO BE PUBLISHING

00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:39.585
MANY VIRAL ARTICLES CONTAINING

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:41.687
FLAT-OUT FALSEHOODS.

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:43.789
&gt;&gt; OVER TWO WEEKS, 38% OF NEWS

00:13:43.789 --> 00:13:45.191
ON SOME REPUBLICAN-LEANING

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:47.059
FACEBOOK PAGES WAS PARTLY

00:13:47.059 --> 00:13:48.894
OR COMPLETELY FALSE,

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:50.629
COMPARED TO 19% OF NEWS

00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:52.431
SHARED ON SOME DEMOCRAT-LEANING

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.166
FACEBOOK PAGES.

00:13:54.166 --> 00:13:55.267
&gt;&gt; John: AND BEFORE YOU SAY,

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:56.969
"REPUBLICANS ARE TWICE AS BAD,"

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:59.505
19% IS STILL TERRIBLE.

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.307
AND IT'S NOT NEWS THERE'S

00:14:01.307 --> 00:14:03.075
MISINFORMATION ON FACEBOOK.

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:04.410
JUST LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP

00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.979
STATUS "IT'S COMPLICATED,"

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:07.980
THE ACCURATE VERSION OF WHICH

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:09.048
WOULD BE,

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:10.182
"IN THREE WEEKS I'LL BE SINGLE,

00:14:10.182 --> 00:14:12.885
BUT I CAN'T ADMIT IT YET."

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:14.186
BUT THESE SITES CAN WARP

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:16.121
YOUR VIEWS PRETTY FAST.

00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.623
YOUR NEWS FEED MAY HAVE BEEN

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:18.357
FULL OF "THE TIMES"

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:19.491
AND "POST" STORIES ABOUT

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:21.093
DONALD TRUMP'S ACTUAL SCANDALS,

00:14:21.093 --> 00:14:22.761
BUT MANY AMERICANS LOGGED

00:14:22.761 --> 00:14:24.597
ONTO FACEBOOK EVERY DAY

00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:26.165
AND SAW SHIT LIKE THIS.

00:14:26.165 --> 00:14:28.200
AND THIS CESSPOOL OF NONSENSE

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.134
WOULD BE A PROBLEM ANYWAY

00:14:29.134 --> 00:14:30.169
WERE IT NOT FOR THE FACT

00:14:30.169 --> 00:14:31.604
THAT ONE OF THE PEOPLE

00:14:31.604 --> 00:14:33.339
IN THRALL TO IT IS

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:35.107
OUR FUTURE PRESIDENT.

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:36.508
BACK IN MARCH, HE CLAIMED THAT

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:37.409
A MAN WHO'D RUSHED THE STAGE

00:14:37.409 --> 00:14:38.544
AT ONE OF HIS RALLIES

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.412
HAD TIES TO ISIS, SOMETHING THAT

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:41.714
HAD CIRCULATED ONLINE

00:14:41.714 --> 00:14:43.649
AND HAD BEEN FOUND TO BE UNTRUE.

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:44.617
AND WHEN THAT WAS POINTED OUT

00:14:44.617 --> 00:14:47.386
TO HIM, THIS WAS HIS RESPONSE.

00:14:47.386 --> 00:14:48.587
&gt;&gt; THERE'S NO TIES TO ISIS

00:14:48.587 --> 00:14:49.855
FOR THIS MAN, NO LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:51.624
OFFICIAL, AND THIS VIDEO THAT

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:52.791
YOU LINK TO APPEARS TO BE

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:53.492
A HOAX.

00:14:53.492 --> 00:14:54.560
&gt;&gt; WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT IT?

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.494
ALL I KNOW IS WHAT'S ON

00:14:55.494 --> 00:14:59.898
THE INTERNET.

00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:01.667
&gt;&gt; John: OKAY,

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:02.968
BEING ON THE INTERNET

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:06.038
IS NOT A HIGH BAR FOR ACCURACY.

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:06.839
IF I EDITED WIKIPEDIA TO SAY

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:08.741
THAT DIANNE WIEST'S REAL NAME

00:15:08.741 --> 00:15:11.577
IS DIANNE FROSTED MINI-WIEST,

00:15:11.577 --> 00:15:12.845
OUR NEXT PRESIDENT WOULD BELIEVE

00:15:12.845 --> 00:15:14.947
THAT TO BE TRUE.

00:15:14.947 --> 00:15:15.881
IN FACT, DURING THE CAMPAIGN,

00:15:15.881 --> 00:15:17.149
TRUMP ROUTINELY USED HIS

00:15:17.149 --> 00:15:18.951
PLATFORM TO SHARE WILDLY

00:15:18.951 --> 00:15:20.519
INCORRECT INFORMATION.

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:22.054
AND EVEN FELLOW CONSERVATIVES

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:22.788
TRIED TO POINT OUT

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:26.025
HOW IRRESPONSIBLE THIS WAS.

00:15:26.025 --> 00:15:28.460
&gt;&gt; YOU TWEETED OUT THAT WHITES

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:29.895
KILLED BY BLACKS, THESE ARE

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:31.163
STATISTICS YOU PICKED UP FROM

00:15:31.163 --> 00:15:34.833
SOMEWHERE, AT A RATE OF 81%.

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:37.403
AND THAT'S TOTALLY WRONG.

00:15:37.403 --> 00:15:39.772
WHITES KILLED BY BLACKS IS 15%.

00:15:39.772 --> 00:15:42.474
&gt;&gt; HEY, BILL, AM I GONNA CHECK

00:15:42.474 --> 00:15:43.309
EVERY STATISTIC?

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:44.710
I GET MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:45.577
PEOPLE @RealDonaldTrump,

00:15:45.577 --> 00:15:46.145
BY THE WAY.

00:15:46.145 --> 00:15:46.745
&gt;&gt; YOU'VE GOT TO.

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:47.579
YOU'RE A PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDER.

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:48.180
YOU GOT TO CHECK IT.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:48.847
&gt;&gt; I HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE --

00:15:48.847 --> 00:15:49.448
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:51.016
FINE, BUT THIS CAME OUT OF

00:15:51.016 --> 00:15:56.955
RADIO SHOWS AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

00:15:56.955 --> 00:16:00.826
&gt;&gt; John: OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:01.627
"I GOT IT FROM RADIO"

00:16:01.627 --> 00:16:02.294
IS MAYBE THE WEIRDEST NONSENSE

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:02.928
EXPLANATION I'VE EVER HEARD,

00:16:02.928 --> 00:16:03.762
LIKE IF SOMEONE SAID,

00:16:03.762 --> 00:16:04.897
"THIS SANDWICH TASTES WEIRD"

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:05.998
AND YOU SAID, "BUT I FOUND IT

00:16:05.998 --> 00:16:08.600
IN A HOLE!

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.335
IF THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG

00:16:09.335 --> 00:16:11.036
WITH IT, THEN WHAT WAS IT DOING

00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:14.740
SITTING IN A HOLE?"

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.975
AND THAT'S THE EVIL GENIUS

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:18.444
AT WORK HERE.

00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:19.645
WEIRD CONSPIRACY BULLSHIT HAS

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:21.113
ALWAYS BEEN BUBBLING UNDER THE

00:16:21.113 --> 00:16:22.414
SURFACE, BUT TRUMP WAS THE FIRST

00:16:22.414 --> 00:16:24.249
MAJOR CANDIDATE TO HARNESS

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:26.485
AND FULLY LEGITIMIZE IT.

00:16:26.485 --> 00:16:27.586
IT'S OBVIOUS IN HINDSIGHT.

00:16:27.586 --> 00:16:29.421
HE CAME ALONG AND TOLD MILLIONS

00:16:29.421 --> 00:16:31.156
OF PEOPLE, "EVERY CRAZY EMAIL

00:16:31.156 --> 00:16:33.459
YOU'VE EVER FORWARDED WAS TRUE."

00:16:33.459 --> 00:16:35.260
AND THAT IS, AT LEAST IN PART,

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.362
WHY HE WILL BE

00:16:36.362 --> 00:16:37.930
OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:38.764
AND TO THEIR CREDIT,

00:16:38.764 --> 00:16:40.232
SOME REPUBLICAN LAWMAKERS WERE

00:16:40.232 --> 00:16:41.767
CALLING HIM OUT ON THIS DURING

00:16:41.767 --> 00:16:43.202
THE CAMPAIGN.

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.002
&gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT

00:16:44.002 --> 00:16:46.472
I REALLY THINK OF DONALD TRUMP.

00:16:46.472 --> 00:16:50.576
THIS MAN IS A PATHOLOGICAL LIAR.

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:51.944
HE DOESN'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:53.479
BETWEEN TRUTH AND LIES.

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:58.183
&gt;&gt; John: HE WAS RIGHT.

00:16:58.183 --> 00:17:00.552
HE WAS JUST RIGHT.

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:01.286
BUT BEFORE YOU THINK REPUBLICANS

00:17:01.286 --> 00:17:02.020
MIGHT STAND UP TO TRUMP,

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.788
I'LL REMIND YOU

00:17:02.788 --> 00:17:03.822
BY THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN,

00:17:03.822 --> 00:17:04.456
TED CRUZ, LIKE MANY OTHERS,

00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:05.391
NOT ONLY SAID HE'D VOTE FOR HIM,

00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:06.158
BUT WAS DOING THIS:

00:17:06.158 --> 00:17:07.526
&gt;&gt; HI, THIS IS TED CRUZ CALLING.

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:08.861
I WAS CALLING TO ENCOURAGE YOU

00:17:08.861 --> 00:17:09.428
TO COME OUT AND VOTE

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:12.931
ON ELECTION DAY.

00:17:12.931 --> 00:17:16.168
&gt;&gt; John: WOW,

00:17:16.168 --> 00:17:18.237
THAT IS HARD TO WATCH.

00:17:18.237 --> 00:17:18.871
"HI, THIS IS TED CRUZ, JUST

00:17:18.871 --> 00:17:19.605
CALLING TO REMIND YOU TO VOTE

00:17:19.605 --> 00:17:20.806
FOR A MAN WHO INSULTED MY WIFE

00:17:20.806 --> 00:17:21.640
AND SAID MY DAD HELPED KILL JFK.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.241
ANYWAY, LIFE HAS NO MEANING,

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:23.041
THANK YOU, AND I WANT TO DIE.

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:23.976
TAKE CARE NOW!

00:17:23.976 --> 00:17:31.016
GOD IS DEAD!"

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:33.085
GOOD-BYE NOW.

00:17:33.085 --> 00:17:33.485
GOOD-BYE.

00:17:33.485 --> 00:17:34.353
SO THERE IS VERY LITTLE

00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:35.554
HOLDING TRUMP BACK.

00:17:35.554 --> 00:17:36.288
AND REMEMBER IN JANUARY,

00:17:36.288 --> 00:17:36.822
HE WILL BE

00:17:36.822 --> 00:17:37.756
SWORN INTO OFFICE.

00:17:37.756 --> 00:17:38.724
AND THERE'S ANOTHER WAVE

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.225
OF NAUSEA.

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:41.660
IT HITS YOU IN SMALL WAYS

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.694
AND LARGE.

00:17:42.694 --> 00:17:44.029
FOR INSTANCE, HAD YOU CONSIDERED

00:17:44.029 --> 00:17:45.497
THE FACT PORTRAITS OF TRUMP ARE

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:48.033
GOING TO BE HANGING IN AIRPORTS?

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:49.334
OR THAT THE MAN WHO DISPARAGED

00:17:49.334 --> 00:17:50.769
A GOLD STAR FAMILY WILL NOW BE

00:17:50.769 --> 00:17:52.271
EXPECTED TO COMFORT THE FAMILIES

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:53.972
OF FALLEN SOLDIERS?

00:17:53.972 --> 00:17:55.040
AND MAYBE YOU'VE TRIED TO MAKE

00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.675
YOURSELF FEEL BETTER,

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:58.477
FANTASIZING THAT HE MIGHT GOOGLE

00:17:58.477 --> 00:17:59.378
"HOW MUCH DOES THE PRESIDENT

00:17:59.378 --> 00:18:00.779
GET PAID," GET DEPRESSED,

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:03.081
AND RESIGN.

00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:05.117
BUT THAT'S WHEN YOU REMEMBER

00:18:05.117 --> 00:18:06.485
MIKE FUCKING PENCE,

00:18:06.485 --> 00:18:08.287
WHO MIGHT BE EVEN WORSE.

00:18:08.287 --> 00:18:09.721
BECAUSE HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S FROM

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:11.657
THE 1950s, BUT HE THINKS LIKE

00:18:11.657 --> 00:18:15.928
HE'S FROM THE 1650s.

00:18:15.928 --> 00:18:16.662
"OH, WHAT'S THAT YOU SAY?

00:18:16.662 --> 00:18:17.296
HER PREGNANCY WAS TERMINATED

00:18:17.296 --> 00:18:19.798
BEFORE BIRTH?

00:18:19.798 --> 00:18:20.599
CLEARLY SHE IS A WITCH.

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:21.500
HOLD A FUNERAL FOR THE FETUS

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.669
AND THROW THE MOTHER IN A LAKE."

00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:25.037
AND I KNOW THIS IS ALL

00:18:25.037 --> 00:18:26.972
DEPRESSING, BUT IT DOES BRING US

00:18:26.972 --> 00:18:28.974
BACK TO THE IMPORTANT QUESTION:

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:30.576
"WHAT THE FUCK DO WE DO NOW?"

00:18:30.576 --> 00:18:31.677
AND FOR THE RECORD,

00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:33.045
THE ANSWER IS NOT

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:34.513
"MOVE TO CANADA."

00:18:34.513 --> 00:18:36.482
LITERALLY THE ONLY EXCUSE TO

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:37.816
EVER MIGRATE TO CANADA IS IF YOU

00:18:37.816 --> 00:18:39.451
WERE BORN THERE ORIGINALLY,

00:18:39.451 --> 00:18:40.486
IT'S SPRINGTIME,

00:18:40.486 --> 00:18:46.725
AND YOU ARE A GOOSE.

00:18:46.725 --> 00:18:46.992
THAT'S IT.

00:18:46.992 --> 00:18:49.161
THAT IS IT.

00:18:49.161 --> 00:18:50.062
NO, WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO STAY

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:50.696
HERE AND FIGHT.

00:18:50.696 --> 00:18:51.530
AND NOT JUST POLITICALLY

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:52.231
IN FOUR YEARS, WHEN HE'S UP FOR

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:53.866
RE-ELECTION, BUT CONSTANTLY,

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:55.300
MONITORING LEGISLATION

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:56.935
AS IT MOVES THROUGH CONGRESS,

00:18:56.935 --> 00:18:58.670
AND FUCKING VOTING WHEN

00:18:58.670 --> 00:18:59.738
YOUR LEGISLATORS COME UP

00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:01.406
FOR RE-ELECTION IN TWO YEARS.

00:19:01.406 --> 00:19:02.975
BUT THAT'S STILL BELOW

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:04.643
THE BAREST MINIMUM

00:19:04.643 --> 00:19:05.711
OF WHAT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED.

00:19:05.711 --> 00:19:06.378
BECAUSE FOR THE LAST

00:19:06.378 --> 00:19:07.513
EIGHT YEARS, WE'VE HAD

00:19:07.513 --> 00:19:09.047
A PRESIDENT WE COULD ASSUME

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:10.182
WOULD GENERALLY STAND UP

00:19:10.182 --> 00:19:12.117
FOR THE RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS.

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:14.887
BUT THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE NOW.

00:19:14.887 --> 00:19:15.654
SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:16.688
ACTIVELY STAND UP

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:17.789
FOR ONE ANOTHER.

00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:19.625
AND IT CAN'T BE SOUNDING OFF

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:21.159
ON THE INTERNET OR SHARING

00:19:21.159 --> 00:19:22.594
THINKPIECES OR VIDEOS LIKE THIS

00:19:22.594 --> 00:19:23.962
ONE THAT ECHO AROUND YOUR

00:19:23.962 --> 00:19:24.663
BUBBLE.

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:25.631
I'M TALKING ABOUT ACTUAL

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.432
SACRIFICE TO SUPPORT PEOPLE

00:19:27.432 --> 00:19:34.206
WHO ARE NOW UNDER THREAT.

00:19:34.206 --> 00:19:35.140
IF YOU CAN AFFORD THE TIME

00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.141
OR MONEY, SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:37.509
THAT ARE GOING TO NEED HELP

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:38.377
UNDER A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

00:19:38.377 --> 00:19:39.244
FOR INSTANCE, IF YOU'RE

00:19:39.244 --> 00:19:40.212
CONCERNED ABOUT WOMEN'S HEALTH,

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:41.446
DONATE TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD

00:19:41.446 --> 00:19:41.980
OR THE CENTER

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.682
FOR REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS.

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:45.117
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE MANMADE

00:19:45.117 --> 00:19:47.319
GLOBAL WARMING IS A SILLY ISSUE,

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:49.321
DONATE TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES

00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:50.322
DEFENSE COUNCIL.

00:19:50.322 --> 00:19:51.456
IF YOU DON'T THINK REFUGEES

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:52.257
ARE A TERRORIST ARMY

00:19:52.257 --> 00:19:53.525
IN DISGUISE,

00:19:53.525 --> 00:19:54.893
DONATE TO THE INTERNATIONAL

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:57.195
REFUGEE ASSISTANCE PROJECT.

00:19:57.195 --> 00:19:58.630
OH, AND GIVEN THESE GUYS'

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.499
TRACK RECORD, I'D ALSO RECOMMEND

00:20:00.499 --> 00:20:02.167
DONATIONS TO THE NAACP

00:20:02.167 --> 00:20:03.168
LEGAL DEFENSE FUND,

00:20:03.168 --> 00:20:04.436
THE TREVOR PROJECT

00:20:04.436 --> 00:20:05.671
FOR LGBTQ YOUTH,

00:20:05.671 --> 00:20:06.371
AND THE MEXICAN AMERICAN

00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:07.306
LEGAL DEFENSE

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:10.208
AND EDUCATIONAL FUND.

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:11.977
THAT LAST ONE WOULD BE PERFECT

00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:13.545
IF YOUR COMPASSION FOR LATINOS

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:16.348
GOES BEYOND, SAY, OCCASIONALLY

00:20:16.348 --> 00:20:19.251
EATING A FUCKING TACO BOWL.

00:20:19.251 --> 00:20:20.285
AND DO CHECK THE BOX

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:21.553
FOR RECURRING DONATIONS

00:20:21.553 --> 00:20:23.388
IF YOU CAN, BECAUSE THIS IS NOT

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:25.557
A SHORT-TERM PROBLEM.

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:29.294
ALSO, FOR A DASH OF FUN,

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:30.495
I'LL POINT OUT IF YOU HAVE

00:20:30.495 --> 00:20:32.097
RELATIVES WHO SUPPORTED TRUMP,

00:20:32.097 --> 00:20:33.198
YOU CAN GIVE MONEY

00:20:33.198 --> 00:20:36.134
IN THEIR NAME.

00:20:36.134 --> 00:20:38.236
SO CONSIDER YOUR HOLIDAY

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:39.304
SHOPPING THIS YEAR DONE.

00:20:39.304 --> 00:20:40.238
HAPPY HOLIDAYS, NANA.

00:20:40.238 --> 00:20:44.076
THE TREVOR PROJECT THANKS YOU.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:45.744
AND THERE'S ONE MORE GROUP

00:20:45.744 --> 00:20:47.746
I WOULD SINGLE OUT FOR HELP,

00:20:47.746 --> 00:20:48.780
AND THAT'S THE PRESS.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.215
BECAUSE, AS WE'VE SEEN, TRUMP IS

00:20:50.215 --> 00:20:51.216
A MASTERFUL DENIER OF BOTH

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:53.018
REALITY AND RESPONSIBILITY.

00:20:53.018 --> 00:20:54.252
HE IS A MAN WHO WOULD

00:20:54.252 --> 00:20:55.420
KICK YOU IN THE NUTS AND THEN

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.390
TELL YOU THAT YOUR PENIS DID IT.

00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:59.625
SO THE PRESS IS GOING TO FACE

00:20:59.625 --> 00:21:01.393
CHALLENGES NOT JUST BECAUSE

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:02.527
TRUMP'S CHIEF STRATEGIST IS

00:21:02.527 --> 00:21:04.529
STEVE BANNON OF BREITBART NEWS

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:06.231
BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF YET ANOTHER

00:21:06.231 --> 00:21:08.233
PROMISE TRUMP MADE.

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:11.303
&gt;&gt; IF I BECOME PRESIDENT

00:21:11.303 --> 00:21:12.537
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE PROBLEMS.

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:13.071
OH, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:13.538
SUCH PROBLEMS.

00:21:13.538 --> 00:21:14.673
I'M GOING TO OPEN UP

00:21:14.673 --> 00:21:16.141
OUR LIBEL LAWS SO WHEN THEY

00:21:16.141 --> 00:21:17.409
WRITE PURPOSELY NEGATIVE

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:19.745
AND HORRIBLE AND FALSE ARTICLES,

00:21:19.745 --> 00:21:21.480
WE CAN SUE THEM AND WIN LOTS

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:23.281
OF MONEY.

00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:24.149
WE'RE GOING TO OPEN UP

00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:26.952
THOSE LIBEL LAWS.

00:21:26.952 --> 00:21:30.522
&gt;&gt; John: OKAY, WELL, FIRST,

00:21:30.522 --> 00:21:34.326
THERE IS NO FEDERAL LIBEL LAWS.

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:37.095
FOR TRUMP TO OPEN UP.

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:37.863
AND AS MANY SUPPOSED RECIPIENTS

00:21:37.863 --> 00:21:38.563
OF TRUMP'S CHARITABLE GIFTS

00:21:38.563 --> 00:21:39.331
WILL TELL YOU, YOU CAN'T OPEN

00:21:39.331 --> 00:21:40.198
SOMETHING UP IF IT

00:21:40.198 --> 00:21:41.133
DOESN'T EXIST.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.367
BUT THAT ATTITUDE OF PUNISHING

00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:44.636
THE PRESS IS GENUINELY WORRISOME

00:21:44.636 --> 00:21:46.304
NOW THAT HE'S PRESIDENT.

00:21:46.304 --> 00:21:47.639
SO INSTEAD OF SHARING

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:48.940
PARTISAN MEMES YOU FOUND ON

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.976
Republigoofs.redneck

00:21:50.976 --> 00:21:52.944
AND Democrappy.cuck

00:21:52.944 --> 00:21:53.979
YOU NEED TO SUPPORT ACTUAL

00:21:53.979 --> 00:21:55.047
JOURNALISM BY BUYING

00:21:55.047 --> 00:21:56.081
A SUBSCRIPTION TO OUTLETS

00:21:56.081 --> 00:21:58.283
LIKE THE TIMES OR THE POST

00:21:58.283 --> 00:21:59.351
OR YOUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER.

00:21:59.351 --> 00:22:00.686
OR DONATING TO GROUPS LIKE

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:02.387
PROPUBLICA, A NONPROFIT WHICH

00:22:02.387 --> 00:22:03.588
DOES GREAT INVESTIGATIVE

00:22:03.588 --> 00:22:05.557
JOURNALISM.

00:22:05.557 --> 00:22:06.992
THE POINT IS, IF WE DON'T GET

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.593
ACTIVELY INVOLVED TO AT LEAST

00:22:08.593 --> 00:22:10.395
MITIGATE TRUMP'S DAMAGE,

00:22:10.395 --> 00:22:13.699
THINGS WILL NOT BE OKAY.

00:22:13.699 --> 00:22:15.067
AND YES, THE SUN WILL RISE

00:22:15.067 --> 00:22:17.369
EACH DAY, BUT THE CONTINUING

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:18.970
ROTATION OF THE EARTH SHOULD NOT

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:21.106
BE YOUR BASELINE EXPECTATION

00:22:21.106 --> 00:22:25.143
OF AMERICAN SOCIETY.

00:22:25.143 --> 00:22:25.977
AND I JUST NEED TO ASK YOU

00:22:25.977 --> 00:22:26.578
ONE MORE THING.

00:22:26.578 --> 00:22:27.679
IT'S GOING TO BE TOO EASY FOR

00:22:27.679 --> 00:22:28.313
THINGS TO START FEELING NORMAL,

00:22:28.313 --> 00:22:29.581
ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE SOMEONE

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:30.849
WHO IS NOT DIRECTLY IMPACTED

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:32.150
BY HIS ACTIONS.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.119
SO KEEP REMINDING YOURSELF

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:35.587
THIS IS NOT NORMAL.

AND STICK IT

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:38.857

TATTOO IT ON YOUR ASS.

00:22:43.962 --> 00:22:45.230

MISOGYNIST INTERNET TROLL

00:22:46.965 --> 00:22:47.566

IT'S FUCKED UP.

00:22:52.738 --> 00:22:54.606
AND THE ONLY THING THAT GIVES ME

00:22:54.606 --> 00:22:57.075
ONE DEGREE OF COMFORT IS THAT

00:22:57.075 --> 00:22:58.677
I THINK PART OF TRUMP MIGHT BE

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:00.712
REALIZING THAT NOW TOO.

00:23:00.712 --> 00:23:01.880
JUST LOOK AT HIS FACE

AFTER MEETING WITH PAUL RYAN

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:05.117
AND GETTING A GLIMPSE OF

00:23:05.117 --> 00:23:07.119
WHAT THE JOB ENTAILS.

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:08.787
HERE'S THE ACTUAL AUDIO

00:23:08.787 --> 00:23:11.757

IN THE STUDIO.

00:23:30.609 --> 00:23:31.743
BUT THAT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM

00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:33.879
APPROPRIATE.

00:23:33.879 --> 00:23:35.213
NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE ELECTION

00:23:35.213 --> 00:23:37.449
BUT BECAUSE 2016 HAS BEEN

00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:39.785
AN UNCOMMONLY SHITTY YEAR.

00:23:39.785 --> 00:23:41.119

ABOUT HOW AWFUL THIS YEAR

00:23:54.366 --> 00:23:55.167
HAS BEEN.

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.001
WE STARTED IT A LITTLE WHILE

00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:57.769
AGO, BUT IT NOW FEELS MORE

00:23:57.769 --> 00:23:59.104
PRESCIENT THAN EVER.

00:23:59.104 --> 00:24:01.439
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH THIS YEAR

00:24:01.439 --> 00:24:02.507
STILL HAS SEVEN WEEKS LEFT,

&gt;&gt; FOR THE EU, IT WAS A CRABBY

00:24:47.786 --> 00:24:49.321
YEAR.

00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:55.493
