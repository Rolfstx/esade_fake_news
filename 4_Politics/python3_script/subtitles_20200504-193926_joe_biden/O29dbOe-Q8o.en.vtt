00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:08.190 align:start position:0%
so I went looking for a couple of other
divided<00:45:06.460><c> families</c><00:45:06.970><c> also</c><00:45:07.240><c> in</c><00:45:07.570><c> England</c><00:45:07.960><c> and</c>

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
divided families also in England and
 

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:11.490 align:start position:0%
divided families also in England and
then<00:45:08.860><c> the</c><00:45:09.010><c> rule</c><00:45:09.250><c> was</c><00:45:09.640><c> that</c><00:45:09.940><c> other</c><00:45:10.720><c> characters</c>

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:11.500 align:start position:0%
then the rule was that other characters
 

00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.220 align:start position:0%
then the rule was that other characters
were<00:45:11.770><c> admitted</c><00:45:12.280><c> to</c><00:45:12.310><c> the</c><00:45:12.460><c> caste</c><00:45:12.850><c> if</c><00:45:13.540><c> they</c><00:45:14.170><c> were</c>

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:14.230 align:start position:0%
were admitted to the caste if they were
 

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
were admitted to the caste if they were
connected<00:45:15.190><c> to</c><00:45:15.580><c> one</c><00:45:15.850><c> of</c><00:45:15.880><c> these</c><00:45:16.180><c> three</c><00:45:16.690><c> divided</c>

00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:17.470 align:start position:0%
connected to one of these three divided
 

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:20.790 align:start position:0%
connected to one of these three divided
families<00:45:17.980><c> and</c><00:45:18.540><c> so</c><00:45:19.540><c> but</c><00:45:19.780><c> it's</c><00:45:19.930><c> it's</c><00:45:20.320><c> a</c><00:45:20.560><c> search</c>

00:45:20.790 --> 00:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
families and so but it's it's a search
 

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
families and so but it's it's a search
it<00:45:21.100><c> takes</c><00:45:21.400><c> it</c><00:45:21.760><c> takes</c><00:45:22.090><c> a</c><00:45:22.240><c> while</c><00:45:22.420><c> and</c><00:45:23.250><c> sometimes</c>

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:24.250 align:start position:0%
it takes it takes a while and sometimes
 

00:45:24.250 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
it takes it takes a while and sometimes
someone<00:45:24.820><c> a</c><00:45:25.530><c> person</c><00:45:26.530><c> or</c><00:45:26.710><c> an</c><00:45:26.950><c> event</c><00:45:27.660><c> obsesses</c><00:45:28.660><c> me</c>
