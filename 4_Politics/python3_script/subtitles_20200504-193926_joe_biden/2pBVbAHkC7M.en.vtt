ENRIQUE CABALLERO: In the
United States, it is estimated

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.806
that there's
about 100 million people

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.042
with diabetes and prediabetes--

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.145
100 million people
in the country

00:00:12.178 --> 00:00:14.047
affected by
a blood sugar problem.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.351
KELLY CLOSE: The economic impact
of diabetes is devastating.

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:21.487
We spent almost $350 billion

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.890
on diabetes in the
United States last year.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:27.460
NARRATOR: Diabetes--
a chronic disease

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:30.463
that's notoriously
difficult to control.

00:00:30.496 --> 00:00:33.466
It can maim and even kill.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:35.835
A generation ago,

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:40.406
less than three percent
of Americans had diabetes.

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:43.976
Today, it's almost ten percent.

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:45.578
It is now predicted

00:00:45.611 --> 00:00:49.849
that half of the U.S. population

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:54.787
will have either diabetes
or pre-diabetes

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.490
by the year 2025.

00:00:57.523 --> 00:01:00.493
Half!

00:01:00.526 --> 00:01:02.795
NARRATOR:
Living with diabetes today

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.697
is a story of new discoveries

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.634
about our food environments
and choices.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:12.138
As a seven-year-old coming
from a Third-World country

00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:14.006
and getting free candy,
I was, like,

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:16.709
"Yo, I'm so down
for America right now.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:18.077
Like, this is tight."

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.981
NARRATOR: It builds
on exciting new progress

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:24.951
in drugs and technologies

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:28.454
that have made the disease
more manageable.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.755
This device
is around the corner,

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:30.890
and that's really
what we're trying to do,

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:32.625
is get much better therapy
to people

00:01:32.658 --> 00:01:34.627
that requires much less
of their participation

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.195
and provides much better care.

00:01:36.228 --> 00:01:39.899
NARRATOR: And it reveals
the terrible struggles

00:01:39.932 --> 00:01:43.236
that so many with diabetes
still have,

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.638
day in and day out.

00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:48.307
So, they was looking at me,
like,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.077
"How are you even standing here
on your feet?

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.678
You're supposed to be
in a coma."

00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.849
CLOSE: So when we think
about the impact to the system--

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.519
way too many
emergency-room visits,

00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:02.021
way too many amputations--

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:06.492

a war on diabetes?

NARRATOR: Diabetes undercuts one
of the most basic functions

00:02:50.436 --> 00:02:51.704
of our bodies--

00:02:51.737 --> 00:02:55.641
our ability to break food down
into nutrients,

00:02:55.674 --> 00:03:00.313
including the sugar glucose
that provides energy.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.681
- Okay.

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:06.152
NARRATOR: The hormone that
manages sugar levels is insulin.

that you can't live without,
right?

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:19.265
Like a key that unlocks
the door to your cells

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:21.701
and allows the glucose
to enter your cells.

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:23.970
That keeps the level of sugar
in your blood in check

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:26.472
and your cells nourished.

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:28.507
NARRATOR:
This insulin-glucose cycle

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.711
is disrupted in diabetes.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.446
In type 1 diabetes,

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.182
the immune system
attacks and destroys

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:40.186
the part of the pancreas
that makes insulin.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.990
In type 2, the pancreas makes
too little insulin,

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:48.661
and the body resists
the insulin it has.

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:49.862

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:53.065
why that's dangerous.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:55.668
You know, you can't breathe,
you can't survive.

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:57.837
Um, you won't live very long

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.539
if you have blood sugar
that's too low.

00:04:00.572 --> 00:04:02.642
Blood sugar that's too high
is equally dangerous,

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.677

NURSE: All right.

some things with my body

that I've never experienced
in life before.

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:08.734
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm going to the bathroom

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:10.469
over 30 times a day.
- Mm-hmm.

00:06:10.502 --> 00:06:12.471
- And I'm just, like,
"Something's not right."

00:06:12.504 --> 00:06:14.073
- You're peeing?
- But... yes.

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:16.308
But I'm very energetic.

00:06:16.341 --> 00:06:18.077
I'm an on-the-go type of person,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.513
and I'm starting
to feel sluggish

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.782
all these different days.

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:23.983
And I felt myself
leaving my body.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:25.351
- I see.

00:06:25.384 --> 00:06:29.021
- One of my cousins
rushed me to the hospital,

00:06:29.054 --> 00:06:31.090
and they checked my levels,

00:06:31.123 --> 00:06:33.092
and they was looking at me,
like,

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:36.262
"How are you even standing here
on your feet?

00:06:36.295 --> 00:06:37.396
You're supposed to be
in a coma."

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:38.397
- Right.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.232
- I thought I was about to die.

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.902
So, they told me
that I had diabetes.

00:06:42.935 --> 00:06:45.404
And, at that moment,
my life changed.

00:06:45.437 --> 00:06:46.539
- Mm-hmm.

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:48.040
Can we look at your foot?
- Yeah.

00:06:48.073 --> 00:06:49.241
- Will that be all right?
- Mm-hmm.

00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:52.011
I got an infection
on the top of my toe.

00:06:52.044 --> 00:06:53.980
- Just out of nowhere?
- Yeah.

00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:56.682
(winces): Ooh.

00:06:56.715 --> 00:06:58.217
- Yeah, I can see that.

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:01.053
You got a, still have
a little shallow ulcer there.

00:07:01.086 --> 00:07:02.054
And then it started

00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:03.422
on this side here?
-Yup.

00:07:03.455 --> 00:07:05.791
- And, but they said
you might lose the toe?

00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:06.826
- Mm-hmm.

00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:08.527
SCHILLINGER:
People with diabetes,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.229
because they've got
a lot of sugar on their skin,

00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:11.831
the fungus loves
to hang out there--

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:14.133
it's moist, it's warm,
it's sweet--

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:17.603
and they grow foot fungus,
athlete's foot,

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:18.838
but in a person with diabetes,

00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:20.639
it can be the portal
to death, right?

00:07:20.672 --> 00:07:23.642
So, the athlete's foot begins
to burrow in the skin

00:07:23.675 --> 00:07:25.077
and create cracks in the skin,

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.012
and that's, like,
the perfect opportunity

00:07:27.045 --> 00:07:30.082
for more virulent bacteria,
dangerous bacteria,

00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:32.084
to enter into the skin

00:07:32.117 --> 00:07:37.656
and begin to infiltrate
the entirety of the foot.

00:07:37.689 --> 00:07:39.225
Okay, I think
you got to start...

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:41.160
I'm not your doctor here, right,
but I'm going to tell you,

00:07:41.193 --> 00:07:42.895
you don't want to put
any weight on it.

00:07:42.928 --> 00:07:44.163
- Yeah, I'm fighting it.

00:07:44.196 --> 00:07:46.232
- Who's your regular doctor?

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:48.133
- I don't have one.

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:49.969
Uh-huh.

00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:53.973
- Okay.

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.944
So, what I was going to suggest

00:07:58.977 --> 00:08:01.180
is that I could take over
as your doctor.

00:08:01.213 --> 00:08:02.181
- That would be great.
- All right.

00:08:02.214 --> 00:08:04.116
- (chuckles)

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:05.551
I appreciate it.

00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:07.987
- No, I want to hear that
you've not been on your foot

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.022
for three weeks is
what I want to hear next time.

00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:12.458
- The best doctor
deserves the best patient.

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.059
- Exactly.
- That's how it goes.

00:08:14.092 --> 00:08:16.395
- And I was going to say that.

00:08:16.428 --> 00:08:18.664
- See, great minds
even think alike, too.

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.132
- So, so we got,

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:04.315
Their bodies' ability to balance
blood sugars is impaired,

00:28:04.348 --> 00:28:06.684

to reset that balance every day

00:28:06.717 --> 00:28:09.887

to know what's going on
with their blood sugars

capillary glucose levels.

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:53.925

00:30:05.002 --> 00:30:07.171

is watching carbs.

00:30:28.425 --> 00:30:31.729
It's not just how much sugar
you eat, like candy.

00:30:31.762 --> 00:30:35.433
It's how much you eat that
your body turns into sugar,

00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:39.003
which is anything
that has carbohydrates.

00:30:39.036 --> 00:30:42.507
- Carbs in one cup of pineapple.

00:30:44.341 --> 00:30:47.812
SIRI: 22 grams of total
carbohydrate in one cup chunks.

00:30:47.845 --> 00:30:49.046
- Okay.

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:51.215
Carbs in bananas.

00:30:51.248 --> 00:30:53.251
GRUESER: One of the things
that we do

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:54.418
in our diabetes education

00:30:54.451 --> 00:30:59.123
is, we show patients
how to read food labels.

00:30:59.156 --> 00:31:01.826
So, one serving size
is half a cup,

00:31:01.859 --> 00:31:09.667
and there are four grams of
carbohydrates in half a cup.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.503
So, that's a good choice.
- Yeah.

00:31:12.536 --> 00:31:16.073
GRUESER: That gives them power
over what they're eating,

00:31:16.106 --> 00:31:17.575
when they can make the choice,

00:31:17.608 --> 00:31:20.444
"Do I put it in the cart or
do I put it back on the shelf?"

00:31:20.477 --> 00:31:23.381
Here's one of the best things
that you can eat.

00:31:23.414 --> 00:31:25.383
The plums.
- Okay, that's what I was...

00:31:25.416 --> 00:31:28.953
- Because one plum only has
eight grams of carbohydrates

00:31:28.986 --> 00:31:30.621
in the whole thing.

00:31:30.654 --> 00:31:34.492
CLOSE: If you're eating
bread or toast or cake

00:31:34.525 --> 00:31:37.862
or pie, or any candy
or anything with sugar,

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:39.563
that has a lot of carbs.

00:31:39.596 --> 00:31:43.401
If you're eating lettuce
or protein,

00:31:43.434 --> 00:31:45.002
that has no carbs.

00:31:45.035 --> 00:31:49.540
And then there is
a long, long list in between

00:31:49.573 --> 00:31:52.109
of how many carbs
different foods have.

00:31:52.142 --> 00:31:53.844
And the better
that you can keep track of it,

00:31:53.877 --> 00:31:55.380
the healthier that you'll be.

00:31:57.214 --> 00:31:59.317

If it says "sugar-free,"

00:32:52.603 --> 00:32:54.305
my patients pull that
off of the shelf,

00:32:54.338 --> 00:32:55.639

"I can have eight or 12
of these cookies

00:32:59.076 --> 00:33:01.045

00:33:01.078 --> 00:33:02.446
They're not sugar-free.

It's, it's not true.

00:33:03.714 --> 00:33:07.284

there are 21 grams
of carbohydrates.

the sugar alcohols.

in terms of the added sugars
that he was exposed to,

00:46:00.557 --> 00:46:02.692
that can overwhelm any system.

00:46:02.725 --> 00:46:07.631 line:0%
I think the image of a thin
person with type 2 diabetes

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:09.833 line:0%
is going to slowly become one

00:46:09.866 --> 00:46:12.502 line:0%
that we become more
and more used to.

00:46:12.535 --> 00:46:13.937
NURSE:
Okay, Mr. Lee,

00:46:13.970 --> 00:46:16.940
so we're going to go ahead
and check your sugar now.

00:46:16.973 --> 00:46:20.110
(people talking in background)

00:46:20.143 --> 00:46:22.813
NURSE:
So, Mr. Lee, that's 428.

00:46:22.846 --> 00:46:24.281
And you said you didn't
eat nothing, right?

00:46:24.314 --> 00:46:26.850
Get you a little bit of water.

00:46:26.883 --> 00:46:29.820
Doctor should be
with you shortly, okay?

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:31.988
SCHILLINGER:
All right,

00:46:32.021 --> 00:46:35.458
talk to me now
about how you've been doing.

00:46:35.491 --> 00:46:38.562
Because I saw you, what,
maybe, like, ten days ago?

00:46:38.595 --> 00:46:39.830
LEE:
I've been doing a lot better.

00:46:39.863 --> 00:46:40.864
SCHILLINGER: Oh, good.

00:46:40.897 --> 00:46:42.232
What does that mean,
"Doing better"?

00:46:42.265 --> 00:46:44.234
- I'm chilling at the house,
feet up, watching TV.

00:46:44.267 --> 00:46:47.037
- But you cannot put any weight

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:48.438
on the foot, okay?
- All right.

00:46:48.471 --> 00:46:51.942
- That's just like, like,
completely prohibited.

00:46:51.975 --> 00:46:56.179
Not for me, for you.
- Mm-hmm.

00:46:56.212 --> 00:46:57.747
- Okay, we're going to get
some scissors here.

00:46:57.780 --> 00:47:00.383
We'll, we'll do that.
- Yeah, this is

00:47:00.416 --> 00:47:02.219
my platinum wrapping right here.
- That's a good job, actually.

00:47:02.252 --> 00:47:04.554
You did that?
- Yep, all by myself.

00:47:04.587 --> 00:47:05.555
All right, man.

00:47:05.588 --> 00:47:07.791
He was hospitalized.

00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:08.992
They were actually going
to amputate,

00:47:09.025 --> 00:47:12.395
but he managed to avoid it.
- Good.

00:47:12.428 --> 00:47:14.097
SCHILLINGER: And now
the question is, you know,

00:47:14.130 --> 00:47:16.533
is, is this thing
going to close?

00:47:18.568 --> 00:47:19.603
The big reveal.

00:47:19.636 --> 00:47:20.837
Do you want to lie back,
or you're good?

00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:22.105
- I'll sit back.

00:47:22.138 --> 00:47:24.007
- You can be as comfortable
as you want to be.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:26.409
All right, let's...
this is the...

00:47:26.442 --> 00:47:28.745
This is the, the area
right here.

00:47:28.778 --> 00:47:31.715
You know,
this is looking damn good.

00:47:31.748 --> 00:47:33.483
- So you know I've been trying
to stay off of it, right?

00:47:33.516 --> 00:47:35.051
WOMAN: That's great,
that's the best treatment.

00:47:35.084 --> 00:47:36.486
SCHILLINGER:
This is looking, like,

00:47:36.519 --> 00:47:38.021
this was wide open.
WOMAN: Oh.

00:47:38.054 --> 00:47:40.090
The thing has closed up.
- Wow.

00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:42.225
- It's closed up.

00:47:42.258 --> 00:47:43.760
LEE: Is that right?
- You want to...

00:47:43.793 --> 00:47:46.763
I mean, I, like,
can you sit up here?

00:47:46.796 --> 00:47:47.864
This is all healed, look.

00:47:47.897 --> 00:47:49.232
Am I right?

00:47:49.265 --> 00:47:51.434
WOMAN: Yeah,
that looks beautiful.

00:47:51.467 --> 00:47:53.837
Yeah.
LEE: Whoa.

00:47:53.870 --> 00:47:55.205
WOMAN: That's fantastic.

00:47:55.238 --> 00:47:58.541
SCHILLINGER: Who needs the home
nursing when you got you?

00:47:58.574 --> 00:48:00.377
This is fantastic.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:03.447
All right,
this is really exciting.

00:48:05.648 --> 00:48:06.750
You were down, remember?

00:48:06.783 --> 00:48:08.985
You were down
in the second half,

00:48:09.018 --> 00:48:12.122
but you were coming back,
the fourth quarter.

00:48:12.155 --> 00:48:13.523
You're Aaron Rodgers, whatever,

00:48:13.556 --> 00:48:16.960
you are at the ten-yard line
with 13 seconds left to go.

00:48:16.993 --> 00:48:18.495
You got two plays.

00:48:18.528 --> 00:48:20.797
You're in the scenario,

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:23.233
and you can make
the right choice or not.

00:48:23.266 --> 00:48:24.768
And so you've been
making the right choice.

00:48:24.801 --> 00:48:26.569
Just make it even better.

00:48:26.602 --> 00:48:29.239

So, David, we need to check

check yourself beforehand?

ED: Where's the Dexcom?

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:33.249
TOBY: Do you have a sensor?
DAVID: In my pocket.

00:52:33.282 --> 00:52:36.619
David was an infant when he
developed type 1 diabetes.

00:52:36.652 --> 00:52:39.656
Daddy came to the rescue.
TOBY: Looks sad about it.

00:52:39.689 --> 00:52:41.157
- Daddy came and got you.

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:44.627
Hello, Baby David.
GIRL: Daddy.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.330
Do you want some?

00:52:47.363 --> 00:52:49.032
ED:
He was about 11 months old,

00:52:49.065 --> 00:52:54.537
and my wife, Toby, was, was a
young pediatrician at the time,

00:52:54.570 --> 00:52:59.509
and so she had a really keen eye
for problems in children.

00:52:59.542 --> 00:53:01.811
TOBY: One thing that had
happened, which was quite scary,

00:53:01.844 --> 00:53:04.180
is, I went to get him
out of the car seat,

00:53:04.213 --> 00:53:07.483 line:0%
and when I went to get him,
he was just kind of staring,

00:53:07.516 --> 00:53:10.386 line:0%
you know, vacant--
eyes open but vacant.

00:53:10.419 --> 00:53:12.989 line:0%
I mean, it's very alarming,
very unusual behavior.

00:53:13.022 --> 00:53:17.293
ED:
So she brought him in to clinic.

00:53:17.326 --> 00:53:18.728
His blood sugar was 800,

00:53:18.761 --> 00:53:21.397
which is eight times
the normal blood-sugar level.

00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:23.533 line:0%
She collected him,
put him in the car,

00:53:23.566 --> 00:53:25.068 line:0%
raced out the door,
and said, you know,

00:53:25.101 --> 00:53:27.003 line:0%
"David has diabetes, and our
lives have changed forever."

00:53:27.036 --> 00:53:30.640
TOBY: When your child
is diagnosed with diabetes

00:53:30.673 --> 00:53:33.209
as an infant,
you have to do everything.

00:53:33.242 --> 00:53:35.645
Diabetes care is 24/7.

00:53:35.678 --> 00:53:38.448
It does not take the night off.

00:53:39.949 --> 00:53:42.885
David is going to be
one year old in a few days.

00:53:42.918 --> 00:53:44.187
- (sneezes)

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:48.057
TOBY: And two days ago, he was
diagnosed with diabetes.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:51.561
ED: The task was upon us to
manage his blood-sugar levels.

00:53:51.594 --> 00:53:53.730
We really had two tools
at our disposal:

00:53:53.763 --> 00:53:57.834
We had insulin
and we had glucose.

00:53:57.867 --> 00:54:01.304
Sugar, basically--
carbohydrates,

00:54:01.337 --> 00:54:05.041
which is in foods
like fruit, juices...

00:54:05.074 --> 00:54:10.013
Foods that would raise
blood sugar, carbohydrates,

00:54:10.046 --> 00:54:13.149
we would use to keep his blood
sugar from going too low.

00:54:13.182 --> 00:54:16.352
And then insulin was delivered
to bring his blood sugar down.

00:54:16.385 --> 00:54:19.055
So these things are working
to oppose one another.

00:54:19.088 --> 00:54:21.090
And the reason
you need the carbohydrates

00:54:21.123 --> 00:54:24.027
is because you can very often
overdose insulin

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.395
just a little bit.

00:54:25.428 --> 00:54:28.131
But even a small amount
of insulin can be lethal.

00:54:28.164 --> 00:54:31.968
We were injecting him
with insulin with a needle

00:54:32.001 --> 00:54:33.903
probably seven times a day,

00:54:33.936 --> 00:54:36.806
and we were checking
his blood sugar 15 times a day.

00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:38.374
That's how we started.

In 1996, insulin cost $21.

"Why has the price

a key part

01:06:53.675 --> 01:06:57.346 line:0%
As the insulin manufacturers
explained to Congress,

01:06:57.379 --> 01:07:00.516 line:0%
they set the list prices
for insulin.

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:04.620 line:0%
But then pharmacy benefits
managers negotiate rebates

01:07:04.653 --> 01:07:08.390 line:0%
that are supposed
to lower consumer costs.

01:07:08.423 --> 01:07:10.826 line:0%
Despite the investment
that we make in rebates,

01:07:10.859 --> 01:07:13.896 line:0%
some patients, including those
with insurance,

01:07:13.929 --> 01:07:15.497 line:0%
end up paying list price
or close to it

01:07:15.530 --> 01:07:18.033 line:0%
at the pharmacy counter.

01:07:18.066 --> 01:07:21.203 line:0%
As a manufacturer,
Novo Nordisk has no control

01:07:21.236 --> 01:07:22.704 line:0%
over what insurance...

01:07:22.737 --> 01:07:25.340 line:0%
what insured patients pay
at the pharmacy counter.

01:07:25.373 --> 01:07:29.178 line:0%
So despite this ever-increasing
rebates that we pay,

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.914 line:0%
patients don't get the full
benefits of those rebates

01:07:31.947 --> 01:07:34.016 line:0%
at the pharmacy counter.

01:07:34.049 --> 01:07:35.884 line:0%
This needs to change.

01:07:35.917 --> 01:07:39.455 line:0%
Patients are rightfully angry
about rising out-of-pocket costs

01:07:39.488 --> 01:07:42.658 line:0%
for many medicines, and
we all have a responsibility

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:46.261 line:0%
to address a system that is
clearly failing too many people.

it's easy to point a finger

much bigger changes are needed.

have supported programs
to cap insulin costs.

available to everyone.

I'm flat, son, there I go.

01:12:39.087 --> 01:12:41.223
Monteil, at really
the prime of his life,

01:12:41.256 --> 01:12:44.359
at the age of 36, almost 37,

01:12:44.392 --> 01:12:47.829
he's facing a really
big challenge,

01:12:47.862 --> 01:12:49.631
which is,
is he going to lose his foot?

01:12:49.664 --> 01:12:51.299

Hey, buddy.
- How you doing, Doc?

01:12:55.303 --> 01:12:57.139
- Good to see you.
- You, too.

01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.109
Tell me about... the last time,

01:13:01.142 --> 01:13:02.577
we talked about
the insulin, right?

01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:04.646
- Yeah, I need,
I need more pens, too,

01:13:04.679 --> 01:13:07.549
and I think I just dropped
the two, last two I had

01:13:07.582 --> 01:13:09.284
in my Uber, when I jumped out.

01:13:09.317 --> 01:13:11.086 line:0%

they're not going to fill that.

01:13:13.555 --> 01:13:16.057 line:0%
'Cause that's expensive.
But we'll try.

01:13:16.090 --> 01:13:19.127
Just to be frank with you,
I love you,

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:22.798
but we're, we didn't make any
progress since the last visit.

01:13:22.831 --> 01:13:24.733
You didn't pick up
your cholesterol medicine.

01:13:24.766 --> 01:13:25.934
- Yeah, I know.

01:13:25.967 --> 01:13:27.335
- You didn't change
your insulin.

01:13:27.368 --> 01:13:29.404
I'm not, I'm not scolding you.
- I know.

01:13:29.437 --> 01:13:31.807
- What I'm doing is,
I'm just saying realities.

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:35.010
- I'm thinking about personally
just changing my diet.

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:38.347
I was about to fast for 30 days.
- Ooh.

01:13:40.448 --> 01:13:41.650
What do you mean by fasting?

01:13:41.683 --> 01:13:44.252
- I'm trying to just...
water and juice.

01:13:44.285 --> 01:13:47.889
- Okay, so that will kill you.

01:13:47.922 --> 01:13:49.858
That's off the table, okay,
that, this is...

01:13:49.891 --> 01:13:51.827
- That'll kill me?
- Yes, that will kill you.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:52.861
And I'm not joking.

01:13:52.894 --> 01:13:55.564
You have diabetes, okay?

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:57.632
You need to be on insulin.

01:13:57.665 --> 01:14:00.035
Your problem is
the kind of food you're eating.

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:01.269
- Yeah.
- But I think that's probably

01:14:01.302 --> 01:14:02.838
because of the income problem
you have, too.

01:14:02.871 --> 01:14:04.739
- Yeah, right.
- So what I would say is,

01:14:04.772 --> 01:14:07.275
let's get you some food
and some income.

01:14:07.308 --> 01:14:09.444
And then you can make
some better choices

01:14:09.477 --> 01:14:11.847
around things that will
actually make your body healthy.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.849
But I pray you don't fast.

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:16.451

careful adjustments

Don't go be on a superhero
in that regard.

I remember a lot of days, I was
just, like, ready to give up.

01:14:29.297 --> 01:14:30.499
And I was, like...
- I know you were.

01:14:30.532 --> 01:14:32.567
- I can't give up--
I had a talk with my son

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:34.769
that kind of tripped me out,
too, like.

01:14:34.802 --> 01:14:38.940
Just to let me know that it's
on his mind as well as mine.

When I see that he's concerned,

01:14:41.843 --> 01:14:45.881
it just make me
want to fight harder.

and look at the bigger picture

01:15:33.394 --> 01:15:36.331
that was causing
the type 2 diabetes epidemic--

the food insecurity--

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:42.571

just, I'm not the guy to be

It used to be that the only

Like, if you ever said, "I got
a kid with type 2 diabetes,"

We've discovered that type 2
diabetes in a young person

is more aggressive
than in an older person.

01:17:47.528 --> 01:17:50.899
What I mean by that is, you get
the complications of diabetes,

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.434
the consequences of it
a lot sooner

01:17:52.467 --> 01:17:54.102
