00:00:06.219 --> 00:00:08.830
Like a lot of kids born in the early 70s,

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.080
I had the good fortune
to be raised by hippies.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.110
One of my childhood heroes
was Stewart Brand.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.250
Stewart is not only
one of the originary hippies,

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.770
he's also one of the first
modern environmentalists

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.339
of the 1960s and 70s.

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.219
As a young boy,

00:00:24.219 --> 00:00:27.299
one of my favorite memories
is playing cooperative games

00:00:27.299 --> 00:00:30.640
that Stewart designed
as an antidote to the Vietnam War.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.360
I'm from a long line
of Christian pacifists

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.650
known as Mennonites,

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.710
and every August, we would go as kids

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.230
to remember the US government's
atomic bombing of Japan

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.850
by lighting candles

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.460
and sending them on boats
onto Bittersweet Park.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.670
As I graduated from high school,
throughout college,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.330
I brought many delegations
to Central America

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.350
to bring diplomacy, seek peace

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.750
and also to support
local farmer cooperatives

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.410
in Guatemala, Central America
and Nicaragua.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.860
And over time, as I've traveled
all around the world,

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.500
been through many small communities
on all the different continents,

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.239
I've come to appreciate
that the young people I interview,

00:01:11.239 --> 00:01:13.249
they don't want to be stuck
in the village,

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:16.719
they don't want to spend their whole lives
chopping wood and hauling wood,

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.680
they want to go to the city
for opportunity - most of them do -

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.190
for education, for work.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.000
And what I've realized

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.820
is that that process of urbanization,
of moving to the city,

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.690
is actually very positive for nature.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.159
It allows the natural
environment to come back.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.799
It allows for the Central African
mountain gorillas, for example,

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.780
an important endangered species,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.960
to have the habitat that they need
to survive and thrive.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.310
And of course, in that process,
you've got to go vertical.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.680
So even places like Hong Kong, you see,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.310
can spare their natural
environment around the city,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.509
but it requires a huge amount
of energy to go up.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:55.030
And so the big challenge of our time is,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.240
how do you get plentiful
reliable electricity and energy

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.240
without destroying the climate?

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.410
I started out as an anti-nuclear activist,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.340
and I quickly got involved
in advocating for renewable energy.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.009
So at the early part of this century,

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.010
I helped to start a labor union
and environmentalist alliance

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.460
called the Apollo Alliance,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.860
and we pushed for a big investment
in clean energy:

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.750
solar, wind, electric cars,

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.460
and the investment idea
was picked up by President Obama.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.190
And during his time in office,
he invested about 150 billion dollars

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.290
to make solar and wind and electric cars
much cheaper than they were.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.210
And that was having a lot of success,

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.430
but we were starting
to notice some challenges,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.080
some of them you're familiar with:

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.430
solar and wind generate electricity
about 10 to 30% of the time,

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.080
so we're dependent on the weather
for solar and wind.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.090
There were other problems
we were noticing.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.360
Sometimes, these sources of electricity
generate too much power,

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.520
and you hear a lot of hype
about batteries,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.760
but we actually don't have
sufficient storage,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.280
even in California,
where we have a lot of investment,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.890
a lot of Silicon Valley types

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.030
putting money into battery
storage technology.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.310
We were trying to figure out,
how do you manage all those renewables?

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.170
And while we were struggling
with this problem, around 2005,

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.800
Stewart Brand came out and he said
we should rethink nuclear power.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.879
And this was like a shock to the system.

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:18.559
I mean, for me and for all of my friends,

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.799
Stewart was one of the first
big advocates of solar energy anywhere.

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.510
In the late 60s and early 70s,
he advised the governor of California,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.790
but he said, "Look, we've been trying
to do solar for a long time" -

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.359
and at the time -

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.289
less than 0.5% of our electricity,
globally, comes from solar,

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:36.720
about 2% from wind

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.870
and the majority
comes from nuclear and hydro.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.330
And he said, "Look,
despite what you might think,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.110
according to the intergovernmental
panel on climate change,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.650
nuclear actually produces four times
less carbon emissions than solar does."

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.380
In fact, that's why they recommended
in their most recent report

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.970
that achieving deep cuts in emissions
is going to require more intensive use

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.340
of renewables, nuclear,
and carbon capture and storage.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.490
Let's take a closer look at Germany.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.440
Germany gets the majority
of its electricity, and of course,

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.200
all of its transportation fuels,
from fossil fuels.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.650
So just the electrical sector,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.030
last year Germany got 40%
of its electricity from coal,

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.379
it got 12% from natural gas,

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:22.290
13% from nuclear, 12% from wind
and about 6% from solar.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.230
So to go from 18% wind and solar to 100%,
you actually have to go beyond that.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.680
If you're replacing
all of the transportation sector

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.890
with electric cars,

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.120
you're looking at something
more like 150%.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.650
Germany's done a lot
to invest in renewables

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.530
and to innovate solar and wind,
but that's still a pretty steep climb.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.490
That's even before you get
to the question of storage.

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.400
So well, let's take a look
at what happened last year.

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.680
Last year, Germany installed
4% more solar panels,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.700
but it generated 3% less
electricity from solar.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.670
Even in meetings with energy experts,

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:59.090
I'll ask people if they can
make a guess as to why that is,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.720
and you'd be shocked at how
many energy experts have no idea.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.660
It just wasn't very sunny
last year in Germany.

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.230
(Laughter)

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.450
Well, that probably meant, though,
then, that it was windier, right?

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.239
Because if it's not as sunny,
maybe there's some more wind,

00:05:13.239 --> 00:05:15.490
and those two things can
balance each other out.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.580
In truth, Germany installed
11% more wind turbines in 2016,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.360
but it got 2% less electricity from wind.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.470
Same story, just not very windy last year.

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.106
So you might think,

00:05:28.106 --> 00:05:30.233
"We just have to do
a lot more solar and wind

00:05:30.233 --> 00:05:33.160
so that in years where
there's not a lot of sunlight and wind,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.870
that there's more electricity
from those energy sources."

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:38.710
So Germany's plan is to increase by 50%

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.819
the amount of electricity
it gets from solar.

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.070
That would take you from 40 gigawatts
to about 60 gigawatts in 2030.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.130
But if you have a year like 2016,

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.330
that means that
you'll still only be getting

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.320
around 9% of your total
electricity from solar,

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.400
and this is in, really, the biggest
solar country in the world.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.370
Germany is really the powerhouse
of renewable electricity.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.460
So the obvious response is,
"We'll just put it all in batteries."

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:06.250
We hear so much about batteries,

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.580
you would think that we just have
a huge amount of storage.

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.000
Our staff took a look
at the numbers in California,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.660
and what we discovered is that we have
23 minutes of electricity storage

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.250
for California's grid.

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.270
But to get that 23 minutes

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.270
requires using every battery
in every car and truck in the state,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.489
which as you can imagine,

00:06:27.489 --> 00:06:30.200
is not super practical
if you're trying to get somewhere.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.330
And Germany might be
a little bit different,

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.419
but not very different from that.

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:37.039
Most people are aware

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:39.380
that to make this transition
towards renewables,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.190
Germany has been spending
a lot more on electricity,

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.500
and you can see electricity prices
in Germany rose about 50%

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.050
over the last 10 years.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.979
Today, German electricity
is about 2 times more expensive

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:52.019
than electricity is in France.

00:06:52.019 --> 00:06:53.269
You might think, "Look

00:06:53.269 --> 00:06:56.050
it's a small price to pay
for dealing with climate change,"

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.600
and I would agree with that.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.620
Spending a little bit
more money on energy,

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.720
especially for those of us
in the rich world,

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.830
is a decent thing to do

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.509
to avert some of the catastrophic
possibilities of global warming.

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:07.909
But the interesting thing is

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:10.650
that when you look and when you
compare France and Germany

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:15.120
in terms of their electricity,
France gets 93% of their electricity

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.680
from clean energy sources,
mostly hydro and nuclear;

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.460
Germany gets just 46%, like about half.

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:25.459
And here's the real shocking thing:

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:29.299
German carbon emissions
have actually been going up since 2009.

00:07:29.299 --> 00:07:32.219
They have increased
over the last two years,

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:34.299
and they may increase this year as well.

00:07:34.299 --> 00:07:37.930
And German carbon emissions
have declined since the 1990s,

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.440
but most of that is just due to the fact
that after reunification,

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.160
Germany just took offline

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:46.699
all of those inefficient coal plants
in East Germany.

00:07:46.699 --> 00:07:49.569
Most of that reduction
is just due to that.

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:52.299
And let's take a look at last year.

00:07:52.299 --> 00:07:55.019
One of the things that really quickly
can reduce emissions

00:07:55.019 --> 00:07:56.869
is switching from coal to natural gas

00:07:56.869 --> 00:08:00.480
because natural gas is about
half of the carbon intensity of coal,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.880
and that would have resulted

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.240
in a pretty significant reduction
in German carbon emissions last year,

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:09.000
except for the fact that Germany
took offline nuclear,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
and when it did that,

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.040
it meant that the emissions
actually ended up going up again.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.890
Now, there's some questions
about what about the future?

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:21.050
So if we just do more solar and wind,
won't it kind of all work itself out?

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:24.630
One of the biggest challenges to this
has come from somebody here in Germany

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.339
who is not a pro-nuclear person at all,

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:30.810
he is an energy analyst
and economist named Leon Hirth,

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.349
and what he finds is that
that problem I described earlier,

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:36.169
where sometimes you have too much wind

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:38.169
at certain parts of the day
or of the year,

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:40.809
or too much solar
and it's not clear what to do with it,

00:08:40.809 --> 00:08:44.140
that that reduces the economic value
of wind and solar.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.550
So wind, actually,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:50.420
the value of it reduces 40% once it gets
to be 30% of your electricity,

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.310
and solar, it's even more dramatic,

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.090
it actually declines by half
when it gets to just 15%.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.850
So one of the things you hear, though,

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.740
is that we can do
a solar roof really fast.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.890
Solar is fast,

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.750
you just put it up in one day
and you've installed the thing;

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:09.800
whereas it takes 10 years or 5 years,
depending on where you are,

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.060
to build a nuclear plant.

00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:12.800
And so it makes sense you'd think,

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.150
if we do solar-wind,
you can just go a lot faster.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.560
But this was actually studied

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.030
in an important article
for the journal Science last year.

00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:24.170
One of the authors was James Hansen,
the famous climate scientist,

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:27.280
and what they found is that,
even when you combine solar and wind,

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.320
you just get a lot less clean electricity
than when you do nuclear.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.370
And that goes for Germany
as well as the United States.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:38.570
So what they did is
they just compared the ten years

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:41.490
of the most deployment
of those two technologies,

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:43.310
solar-wind versus nuclear.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.660
And it's a pretty stark comparison.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:51.700
I can imagine what you're thinking
because it's what I was sort of thinking,

00:09:51.700 --> 00:09:54.800
I was like, "Well this sounds like
I now have to really reconsider

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.950
my attitudes around nuclear power,
but then what about Chernobyl?

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:01.010
What about Fukushima?
What about all the nuclear waste?"

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.790
Those are really
reasonable questions to ask.

00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:05.900
And in fact, when I was
trying to ask them,

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.940
there were other people
that were starting to change their mind.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.090
One of the ones
who I was most impressed by

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:12.610
and was very influential

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.750
is a British newspaper columnist
named George Monbiot.

00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:19.930
George Monbiot wrote a column,
shortly after Fukushima,

00:10:19.930 --> 00:10:23.090
where he went through
the scientific research on radiation,

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:24.570
and what he wrote was:

00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:27.680
"The anti-nuclear movement
to which I once belonged

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.730
has misled the world about the impacts
of radiation on human health."

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:34.310
I write some pretty
harsh things sometimes,

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.450
but this was a pretty strong call

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.580
and he was talking
to a number of scientists

00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.570
that actually have studied
the big accidents.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:46.460
One of them is Jerry Thomas,
from Imperial College in London.

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.230
Jerry started something
called the Chernobyl tissue bank

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.700
out of her concern for the accident -

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:57.980
totally independent professor
of pathology at Imperial College -

00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:00.690
and I asked her, I said,

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.560
"I'd like to present this,
but I'm a not radiation scientist,

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:05.120
so can I just steal your slides?

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.600
I'll put your picture on them
if you let me do that."

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:10.320
The first thing she points out,

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.460
she says most ionizing radiation,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.730
that's the radiation
that is potentially harmful

00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:18.950
that comes from a nuclear accident,
most of it is natural.

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:21.150
And I was like,
"Well, that sounds alright.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:25.030
You know, I like natural foods,
natural radiation sounds good.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.070
The hot springs, you know."

00:11:27.070 --> 00:11:30.510
And she said, "No, actually
natural ionizing radiation

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:33.260
is just as harmful, potentially,
as artificial radiation."

00:11:33.260 --> 00:11:35.220
So that's kind of the first thing.

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.540
The striking thing about it

00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:40.310
is that the total amount
of ionizing radiation we're exposed to,

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.540
from not just Chernobyl and Fukushima

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.370
but also all of the atomic bomb testing
in the 60s and 70s,

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.300
totals just 0.3% of our exposures.

00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:53.510
Most of the radiation we're exposed to
is just from the earth,

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:57.070
or from the atmosphere,
or from the buildings around us.

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.400
Let's look at the big one.
This is Chernobyl.

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:03.820
This is the event that really
scared me about nuclear

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.740
and led me to be an anti-nuclear activist.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.350
The United Nations has done
these very large comprehensive studies.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:15.240
They have hundreds of scientists
around the world that do this research,

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:18.880
so the possibility of somebody
fudging the data

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.000
or maybe trying to cover something up
is pretty low in that environment,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.480
just because there's so many
different credible scientists

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.390
at different universities
around the world doing the research.

00:12:29.390 --> 00:12:33.050
So this is really - I think
it was a pivotal moment for me.

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:36.650
Chernobyl is the worst
nuclear accident we've ever had,

00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.620
and I think some people say
it's the worst we could ever have.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:41.800
I don't need to make
a statement that strong,

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.960
but they literally had a nuclear reactor
without a containment dome,

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.810
and it was on fire, it was just
raining radiation around everybody.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:54.580
It was really a terrible accident.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:56.860
And when they start counting bodies,

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:02.160
what they come up with is 28 deaths
from acute radiation syndrome,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.020
15 deaths over the last 25 years
from thyroid cancer,

00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:07.890
which as horrible as it sounds,

00:13:07.890 --> 00:13:11.320
it's actually the best cancer to get
because hardly anybody dies from it.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.470
It's really treatable,
you can take thyroxine,

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:16.260
which is a synthetic
substitute, get a surgery.

00:13:16.260 --> 00:13:18.020
In fact, most of the people that died

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:20.110
were people that were
in remote rural areas,

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.580
that couldn't get the medical
treatment they needed.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:27.960
And if you take the 16,000 people
that got thyroid cancer from Chernobyl,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.089
they estimate 160 of them
will die from thyroid cancer,

00:13:31.089 --> 00:13:35.310
and it's not like they're dying right now,
they'll die of it in old age,

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.070
and that's not to say that it's okay,

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.710
but it is to put it
in some kind of context.

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.940
There's no scientific evidence
of thyroid cancer

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.700
outside of those three main countries:
Belarus, Ukraine, Russia.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.270
No effect on fertility,
malformations, infant mortality,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.010
no conclusion or no data
for adverse pregnancy outcomes,

00:13:55.010 --> 00:13:58.770
no evidence for any genetic effects.

00:13:58.770 --> 00:14:01.730
And I think this last one
is the most striking thing:

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:05.440
there's no evidence
of any increase in cancer,

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:07.340
including in the cohort of people

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.240
who put the fire out
and cleaned up afterwards.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.560
And I saw some surprised by this finding,

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.700
and so I put the link
to the website on there.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.090
Don't take my word for it,

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:19.480
I think you should go read it

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.750
because just reading
about Chernobyl, for me,

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.250
was a big part of changing my mind
about nuclear power.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.430
What about Fukushima?

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.820
This was the second worst
nuclear disaster in history.

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.530
There was a much smaller
release of radiation than Chernobyl,

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:34.960
and so what we find

00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.010
is that there's no deaths
from radiation exposure from Fukushima,

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:40.850
which is kind of amazing.

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:44.420
1,500 people died
being pulled out of nursing homes,

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.390
being pulled out of hospitals.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.520
It was insane, it was a panic.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.930
The Japanese government
should not have done that,

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:55.880
it violated every standard
of how you deal with a disaster like that.

00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.620
You're supposed to shelter in place.

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.740
In fact, by pulling people
out of their homes

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.169
and moving them around outside
during that accident,

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:04.329
they actually exposed them
to more radiation.

00:15:04.329 --> 00:15:06.379
Of course you have
to put that in comparison

00:15:06.379 --> 00:15:08.239
to the other things that were going on,

00:15:08.239 --> 00:15:11.110
like 15 to 20 thousands people
dying instantly from drowning,

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:13.600
pinned under many
different technologies, by the way,

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.589
getting killed by that tsunami.

00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:18.999
Unlikely be any increase
in thyroid cancer,

00:15:18.999 --> 00:15:22.230
and the big problem, of course,
is just the stress and the fear

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.140
that you've been contaminated

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.129
when the evidence suggests
that that's not the case at all.

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:29.729
They did an interesting study.

00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:33.719
They brought a bunch of school kids
from Paris to Fukushima,

00:15:33.719 --> 00:15:35.250
and they wore dosimeters -

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.830
that's what we call
the old Geiger counters now.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:39.870
And what they find is that, those kids,

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:42.070
when they go through
the security systems,

00:15:42.070 --> 00:15:43.490
the radiation would spike.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.800
When they'd get on
the airplane to fly to Tokyo,

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.320
the radiation would spike.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:50.100
They'd go to the French Embassy,
the radiation would spike.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.330
Iwaki didn't get - Iwaki is a city -

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:57.299
it didn't get the plume,
the radioactive plume.

00:15:57.299 --> 00:16:00.539
Tomioka did, and it's still a tiny blip

00:16:00.539 --> 00:16:03.489
compared to just going through
the security system.

00:16:03.489 --> 00:16:06.309
So let's look at some of the basics
to put this in context.

00:16:06.309 --> 00:16:11.019
If you live in a big city
like London or Berlin or New York,

00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:14.850
you're gonna increase
your mortality risk by 2.8%,

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:16.609
just from air pollution alone.

00:16:16.609 --> 00:16:20.029
If you live with someone
who smokes cigarettes, 1.7%.

00:16:20.029 --> 00:16:22.670
But if you were somebody
that cleaned up Chernobyl,

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:26.740
got exposed to 250 millisieverts
of radiation, 1%.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.230
100 millisieverts, 0.4%.

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:33.340
It's just because there just
wasn't as much radiation as people think.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.750
The atomic bomb testing
in the sixties exposed people to just -

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.230
there's so many different
measurements for radiation.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.360
You can just see a lot more
radiation exposure

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.299
during the a-bomb test
than either Chernobyl or Fukushima.

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:46.729
I think the key thing here is,

00:16:46.729 --> 00:16:49.179
I'm from the state of Colorado
in the United States,

00:16:49.179 --> 00:16:50.829
we have an annual exposure,

00:16:50.829 --> 00:16:53.069
just because there's
so much granite around us,

00:16:53.069 --> 00:16:54.460
about 9 millisieverts a year.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.910
That's what you'd get
if you're the 6 million people

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:58.600
that live around Chernobyl today.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.560
And yet, of course, nobody knows this.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.150
Here's this really basic science,

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:04.770
it is right there on the website.

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:07.169
But when you go into a survey,
in most countries -

00:17:07.169 --> 00:17:08.880
this one was done in Russia -

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.810
only 8% of the population surveyed

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.609
accurately predicts
the death toll from Chernobyl,

00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:20.609
and 0% predicted accurately
the death toll from Fukushima.

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:23.390
Meanwhile, sitting right before us

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.769
is 7 million deaths a year
from air pollution,

00:17:25.769 --> 00:17:28.689
and the evidence
on particulate matter causing harm

00:17:28.689 --> 00:17:31.559
has only gotten stronger over the years.

00:17:31.559 --> 00:17:34.629
So that's why every major
medical journal that looks at this -

00:17:34.629 --> 00:17:36.939
this is from the British
Medical Journal Lancet -

00:17:36.939 --> 00:17:40.280
finds that nuclear power is already
the safest way to make electricity.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.790
And it leads to this really
uncomfortable conclusion,

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.650
one that the climate scientist
James Hansen came to recently,

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:50.500
which is that nuclear power
has actually saved 1.8 million lives.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.739
It's not something
that you hear very much about.

00:17:54.919 --> 00:17:56.759
So what about the waste?

00:17:56.759 --> 00:17:59.059
This is the waste
from a nuclear plant in the US.

00:17:59.059 --> 00:18:00.779
The thing about the nuclear waste is

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:02.969
it's the only waste
from electricity production

00:18:02.969 --> 00:18:04.599
that is safely contained anywhere.

00:18:04.599 --> 00:18:07.249
All of the other waste
goes into the environment,

00:18:07.249 --> 00:18:10.430
from coal, gas.

00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:14.180
And then here's sort of a equally
uncomfortable conclusion:

00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:17.699
solar panels, there's no plan
to recycle solar panels

00:18:17.699 --> 00:18:19.269
outside of the EU.

00:18:19.269 --> 00:18:23.229
Meaning that all of us in California -
it's just gonna join the waste stream.

00:18:23.229 --> 00:18:26.180
We calculated how much toxic waste -

00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:30.950
because the panels contain heavy metals,
and lead, and chromium, and cadmium -

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:34.159
how much toxic waste from solar is there?

00:18:34.159 --> 00:18:37.469
To get a sense of it, look at
how much more materials are required

00:18:37.469 --> 00:18:39.550
for each different energy source,

00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:42.170
and when you calculate
all the panels that it'll require

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:44.800
to produce the same amount
of electricity as nuclear,

00:18:44.810 --> 00:18:49.790
solar actually produces
300 times more waste than nuclear,

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:51.500
very little of it contained,

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:54.240
and all of it containing
toxic heavy metals.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.460
What about the weapons?

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.040
If I thought there was any chance

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.870
more nuclear power would
increase the chance of nuclear war,

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:00.750
I'd be against it.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.820
I've always been a pacifist. I still am.

00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:06.639
Diplomacy is almost always
the right solution.

00:19:06.639 --> 00:19:10.309
People say, "What about North Korea?"
Korea proves the point.

00:19:10.309 --> 00:19:13.839
In order to get nuclear power right now,
it's been this way for 50 years,

00:19:13.839 --> 00:19:16.799
you have to agree
not to get a weapon, that's the deal.

00:19:16.799 --> 00:19:20.139
South Korea wanted nuclear power,
they agreed not to get a weapon,

00:19:20.139 --> 00:19:21.550
they don't have a weapon.

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:25.210
North Korea wanted nuclear power,
I think they should have gotten it,

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:28.640
we didn't let them have it
for a variety of reasons,

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.810
they got a bomb.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:32.190
They now are testing missiles
that can hit Japan.

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.229
Soon they'll be able to hit California.

00:19:35.229 --> 00:19:37.529
So if nuclear energy
led to nuclear bombs,

00:19:37.529 --> 00:19:41.050
there's no evidence for it,
not only in Korea but nowhere.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.150
So, where does that leave us?

00:19:44.990 --> 00:19:48.290
I think it leaves us
with some uncomfortable ideas.

00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.780
If Germany hadn't closed
its nuclear plants,

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:55.880
its emissions would be
43% lower than it is today.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.990
And I think if you care
about climate change,

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.630
that's at least something
that you have to wrestle with,

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.590
especially in light
of some of these facts

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.260
about the harms and benefits
of different energy sources.

00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.350
And I'll end with a quote
from somebody else who changed his mind,

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.910
and somebody else who was
a huge childhood hero for me,

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:13.360
and that is Sting.

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.460
"If you're going to tackle global warming,

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.501
nuclear is the only way
you can create massive amounts of power."

00:20:18.501 --> 00:20:21.031
Thank you very much.
I appreciate you all listening.

00:20:21.031 --> 00:20:23.360
(Applause)
