00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:33.833
That's March 6th to March 12th,
or the single most

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.168
powerful word.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:37.670

a historically black liberal
arts college in Columbia,

South Carolina, for a

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:46.146
The President: Do you
always wear a tie,

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.914
or you just wore it today?

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:48.982
(laughter) Male Speaker:
I wear it all the time.

00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.450
The President: Okay, good.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.152
(laughter) Yeah, I like that.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:55.255
We've got to ensure not
just the absence of formal,

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:58.858
legal oppression, but the
presence of an active dynamic

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:01.127
opportunity, good jobs
that pay good wages,

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:04.764
a good start for every child,
healthcare for every family,

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:07.667
a higher education that prepares
you for the world without

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:11.671
crippling you with debt, a fair
and more just legal and criminal

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:12.672
justice system.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:13.673

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.851
lunchtime visit to the

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:27.487
one of the largest African
American churches in the state.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:30.523
Male Speaker: And I left my
phone in the car, oh my god.

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:33.793
Male Speaker: I tell you what,
I'll take some pictures,

00:01:33.793 --> 00:01:35.728
and I'll send them
to your phone.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:37.464
Narrator: On Saturday the First
Family traveled to Selma,

00:01:37.464 --> 00:01:40.400
Alabama to march the 50th
anniversary of the Selma to

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.369
Montgomery marches, a milestone
in the Civil Rights Movements.

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:47.740
President George W.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.443
Bush, and Mrs. Bush, the
President spoke to a crowd of

00:01:50.443 --> 00:01:53.346
more than 40,000 people in front
of the Edmund Pettus Bridge.

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:56.182
The President: Because the
single most powerful word in our

00:01:56.182 --> 00:02:03.690
democracy is the word 'we.' We
the people, we shall overcome.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.425
Yes, we can.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:07.327
That word is owned by no one.

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.496
It belongs to everyone.

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:13.800
We honor those who
walked so we could run.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.069
We must run so
our children soar.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.938
Narrator: Foot soldiers who
braved the march 50 years ago,

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:20.840
despite tear gas, clubs, and
violence -- The President: So

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.675
nice to see you.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:24.711
Narrator: -- joined hands with
the First Family to walk across

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:28.648
the bridge that day, a somber,
but celebratory reminder of how

00:02:28.648 --> 00:02:31.518
far we've come and the
courage it took to get here.

00:02:31.518 --> 00:02:35.054
The First Lady: One of the foot
soldiers was a woman who said

00:02:35.054 --> 00:02:38.391
she was 14 years old
when she marched.

00:02:38.391 --> 00:02:39.759
She was so scared.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:45.331
The woman who is 111, she made
her go through with the march,

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:48.968
because she said that if you
walk away now you'll let your

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:51.738
fears guide you and
rule you forever.

00:02:51.738 --> 00:02:54.073
And she went ahead with the
march, but on that day,

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:56.109
she got her head beaten in.

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.111
And for me, I thought
about that and thought,

00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.580
that would have been
Sasha on that day.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.316
Narrator: Then the First Family
toured the National Voting

00:03:03.316 --> 00:03:06.019
Rights Museum and Institute, and
the President sat down for an

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.021
interview with
CBS's Bill Plante.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.089
Plante's a journalist who
actually covered the marches

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.658
back in 1965.

00:03:11.658 --> 00:03:13.226
The President: I'd start reading
about -- Narrator: On Monday the

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.762
President introduced a new
initiative called Tech Higher,

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:18.932
a multi-sector effort to get
more Americans rapidly trained

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:20.934
for well-paying technology jobs.

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:23.603
Tech Higher builds on the
momentum of the past five years,

00:03:23.603 --> 00:03:26.272
when American businesses have
created more than 12 million

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:27.273
new jobs.

00:03:27.273 --> 00:03:29.442
Meanwhile, Dr. Biden and
Undersecretary of Education

00:03:29.442 --> 00:03:31.744
Dr. Ted Mitchell toured
community colleges in

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.012
Gainesville, Florida,
and Austin, Texas.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:36.482
Dr. Biden: Community colleges
have so much to offer you.

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:39.218
They offer mentors, they
offer writing centers,

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.787
they offer math labs.

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:43.990
(laughter) Narrator:
Back at the ranch,

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.826
the President welcomed European
Council President Donald Tusk to

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:49.662
the Oval Office to discuss
pressing foreign policy issues,

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:52.231
such as Ukraine and the
Transatlantic Trade and

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:54.834
Investment Partnership,
otherwise known as TTIP.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:57.270
On Tuesday, the President took
his student aid bill of rights

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.039
for a road test, presenting it
to a representative sample of

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:02.809
the very people he wrote it for,
10,000 students at Georgia Tech.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.979
The President: So if you agree
with the basic values that I

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.349
outlined, if you believe in a
student aid bill of rights that

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.784
will help more Americans
pay for a quality education,

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.786
then sign your name
to this declaration.

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:19.692
You can go to a website, because
you guys like tech stuff.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.427
(laughter) You go to

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.429
whitehouse.gov/collegeopportunit y.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.665
Narrator: On Wednesday morning
the aromatic White House kitchen

00:04:25.665 --> 00:04:28.968
was busy preparing for
Nowruz, the Persian new year,

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:31.704
celebrated by more than 300
million people across the Middle

00:04:31.704 --> 00:04:34.607
East, Central and Southwest
Asia, and Eastern Europe.

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:35.842
Maziar Farivar: So this
celebration is celebration of

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:37.243
spring coming up.

00:04:37.243 --> 00:04:40.780
We say good bye to the winter,
all the cold and sort of

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.183
darkness of winter, and welcome
in the brightness of spring.

00:04:44.183 --> 00:04:45.551
The First Lady: And
after a long winter,

00:04:45.551 --> 00:04:47.920
we can use a little
bit of all that, right?

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.223
(laughter) Finally thawing out.

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:51.424
You're ready.

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:55.962
(laughter) Payam Yousefi: I'm so
excited to be able to share a

00:04:55.962 --> 00:05:00.967
part of my heritage, my culture,
and I'm honored with the fact

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:03.302
that the White House is willing
to share this with a large

00:05:03.302 --> 00:05:05.171
crowd, and high
light it as well.

00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:13.146
It's just that I cannot express
how excited I am about this.

00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:15.014
Narrator: In the afternoon the
White House teamed up with Arne

00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:17.650
Duncan to discuss the student
aid bill of rights with college

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.153
newspapers over the phone,
and to their surprise,

00:05:20.153 --> 00:05:22.155
the President hopped on
the call to say hello,

00:05:22.155 --> 00:05:24.323
and to go through his proposal.

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:25.458
Jennifer Friedman:
Mr. President?

00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.559
The President: Hey, everybody.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.828
Yesterday I took new action to
make it easier for students to

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.264
pay for college, pay off their
loans through an executive

00:05:31.264 --> 00:05:34.167
action that streamlines and
improves the way the federal

00:05:34.167 --> 00:05:36.302
government interacts with
students when it comes to

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:40.807
student loans, helps students
cut through the bureaucracy,

00:05:40.807 --> 00:05:41.541
and get faster responses
about their loans.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.710
Narrator: At the end of the day
the President got to spend some

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.978
time with some of his
favorites, kid scientists,

00:05:45.978 --> 00:05:49.415
who are finalists in the 2015
Intel Science Talent Search.

00:05:49.415 --> 00:05:51.050
The President: I could not be
more impressed with

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:52.518
how you've done.

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:54.520
Narrator: So stay engaged
with us online and remember,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.522
you can find out more
information about any of these

00:05:56.522 --> 00:05:58.491
topics, or see complete
videos of these events at

00:06:01.194 --> 00:06:02.195
your West Wing Week.

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.430
The President: "How do you
make Obama's eyes light up?

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.432
Shine a flashlight in his ears."

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:09.068
(laughs) That's pretty good.

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:12.171
"Somebody send Obama some life
hacks on how to be a good

00:06:12.171 --> 00:06:13.673
president.

00:06:13.673 --> 00:06:14.774
Ha-ha.

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:16.843
Like I bet that would help.

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:19.045
LOL."

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:24.984
You know, the LOL is redundant
when you have the ha-ha.

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:28.321
"I'm all right with the
President wearing jeans.

00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:31.824
I'm not all right with the
President wearing those jeans."

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:33.726
Jimmy Kimmel: Can I
just say something?

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.728
The President: Yeah, Jimmy.

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.730
Jimmy Kimmel: I
think that's mean,

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.331
and I don't think there's
anything wrong with the jeans

00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:40.733
you wear.

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:43.503
The President: Jimmy, I
think they've got a point.

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:44.504
Have you been working out.

00:06:44.504 --> 00:06:49.140
(laughter)

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.540
The President: All right.

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:51.778
Female Speaker:
That was perfect.
