00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:05.200
Outside a hospital in
Guayaquil, Ecuador,

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.570
a family seals the
coffin of their father

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.720
with plastic wrap.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.940
Many people in Guayaquil
blame the government

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.342
for failing to slow the
spread of coronavirus,

00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:29.800
and to deal with the thousands
of bodies that have piled up

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.670
in the aftermath.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.370
Guayaquil has suffered
arguably the worst

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.220
Covid death toll
in Latin America.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.500
The thing is, Ecuador
had acted earlier

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.690
than its neighbors to
close borders and order

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.280
strict quarantine.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.990
So what went wrong?

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:57.170
From the start,
the one-two punch

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.900
of rapid contagion and
the ensuing death toll

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.730
caught local and
national officials off guard.

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:09.770
On Feb. 27,
doctors in Guayaquil

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.770
diagnosed the country’s
first Covid-19 patient,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.120
Bella Lamilla, a 71-year-old
retired teacher, otherwise

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.205
known as “Patient Zero.”

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.130
Dr. Esteban Ortiz-Prado
is a medical investigator

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.405
helping to advise the
government on the pandemic.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.040
It took 13 days to diagnose
Lamilla with coronavirus.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.210
And in that time, she infected
many other people, including

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.540
much of her family,
pictured here in 2019.

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.600
In all, three
family members died,

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.330
including Bella herself.

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.900
After she arrived
in Ecuador, Lamilla

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.050
stayed in the home of
her niece, Cassandra,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.028
in the town of Babahoyo.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.093
Bella Lamilla was certainly
not the only case.

00:02:47.093 --> 00:02:49.290
There were at least six
other flights from Madrid

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.848
to Guayaquil between
the time she arrived

00:02:51.848 --> 00:02:53.690
and when she was diagnosed.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.710
Other travelers later tested
positive for Covid-19.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.140
Those lost weeks led to an
out-of-control epidemic.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.777
Two and a half weeks after
Bella Lamilla’s diagnosis,

00:03:35.777 --> 00:03:37.800
the country was on lockdown.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.775
Two weeks after
that, Guayaquil

00:03:39.775 --> 00:03:41.870
was in the throes of the
most aggressive outbreak

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.986
in Latin America.

00:03:43.986 --> 00:03:47.340
“It is true that at the very
beginning, it was a disaster.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.599
We are learning by mistake,

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.140
by errors that we made.”

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.345
This is
Dr. Juan Carlos Zevallos.

00:03:53.345 --> 00:03:55.310
He was installed as
Ecuador’s health minister

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.380
in late March, after the
former minister resigned.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.680
He admits the
government should have

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.340
tested and tracked patients.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.260
But he also blames
residents for not

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.000
following stay-at-home orders
after Bella’s diagnosis.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.300
“Ecuador, as I said,
was prepared.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.210
I mean, did all the measures
in place and very early.

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:20.989
Unfortunately, the
people didn’t hear us.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.675
And they did not obey
those restrictions.”

00:04:24.675 --> 00:04:26.630
Like a lot of cities
in Latin America,

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:29.040
a large segment of
Guayaquil’s population

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.120
lives day to day,
working informal jobs.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.460
So to stay home
means not eating.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.610
It was a
perfect storm of factors

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.551
that left
Guayaquil’s hospitals

00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:40.492
and morgues overwhelmed.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.230
Now, the government of
Ecuador has another dilemma:

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.780
Just how to bury the
thousands of bodies

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.180
that have piled up in the
weeks after Lamilla’s death?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.340
Ecuador's official Covid
death toll is several hundred.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.810
But forensic police have
been working around the clock

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.810
to collect and account
for thousands more dead.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.460
And construction
is now underway

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:15.290
for various large
burial sites around the city.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.330
Container trucks like
this one transport

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.440
corpses to one new site on
the outskirts of Guayaquil,

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.723
in the neighborhood
of Pascuales.

00:05:26.723 --> 00:05:29.701
Local residents fearful of
contamination are outraged.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.710
Officials in charge
of handling the dead

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:44.740
have promised that
each body will have

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.890
a separate resting place.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.940
We attempted to film drone
footage of the new burial site.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.740
But Ecuadorean soldiers
ordered our team

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.870
to bring the drone down,
and temporarily confiscated

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.210
our footage.

00:05:57.914 --> 00:06:00.284
A human rights worker
documented the incident.

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.510
Since the first
coronavirus diagnosis,

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.150
distrust of the government’s
handling of this crisis

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.800
appears to have spread as
fast as the contagion itself.
