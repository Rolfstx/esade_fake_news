00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 align:start position:0%
been it's been really good I always this
 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.510 align:start position:0%
been it's been really good I always this
kind<00:03:14.230><c> of</c><00:03:14.380><c> thing</c><00:03:14.590><c> you</c><00:03:14.740><c> do</c><00:03:14.860><c> that</c><00:03:15.100><c> and</c><00:03:15.280><c> then</c><00:03:15.370><c> I</c><00:03:15.460><c> do</c>

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
kind of thing you do that and then I do
 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
kind of thing you do that and then I do
this<00:03:15.910><c> because</c><00:03:16.360><c> that's</c><00:03:16.570><c> more</c><00:03:16.900><c> natural</c><00:03:17.080><c> but</c><00:03:17.860><c> I</c>

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 align:start position:0%
this because that's more natural but I
 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.250 align:start position:0%
this because that's more natural but I
