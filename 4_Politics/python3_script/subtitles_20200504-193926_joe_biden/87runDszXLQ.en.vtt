00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.390
- So today is the often asked about

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.980
and highly anticipated
towing a fifth wheel video.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.740
- Yep, we're headed over
to an empty parking lot,

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.857
formerly Walmart, hopefully
we don't get kicked out.

00:00:12.857 --> 00:00:14.069
- That's right, fingers crossed.

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:17.819
(uplifting light rock music)

00:00:24.215 --> 00:00:27.298
(country rock music)

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.610
It's moving day.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.730
- Yep, not your typical moving day.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.563
- Nope.

00:00:33.563 --> 00:00:34.492
- We're moving about 200 yards.

00:00:34.492 --> 00:00:35.325
- Yeah.

00:00:35.325 --> 00:00:36.158
- To a new site.

00:00:36.158 --> 00:00:36.991
- Yep.

00:00:36.991 --> 00:00:39.620
We're at the halfway point
of our stay in North Carolina

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.350
and we have to move sites so we thought

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.730
what better time than now to film a video

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:45.563
all about towing.

00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:48.080
- Because when we were looking
at buying a fifth wheel

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.594
I looked for towing videos.

00:00:49.594 --> 00:00:51.910
They're really aren't
any and I wanted them

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.860
so maybe you do.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.693
- That's right.

00:00:53.693 --> 00:00:55.320
- Since we have to hitch
up and move anyway,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.422
we found an empty parking lot

00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:58.863
that we will hopefully
not be kicked out of.

00:00:58.863 --> 00:00:59.800
- Yeah.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:00.955
- We didn't exactly get permission.

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:01.788
- Yeah.

00:01:01.788 --> 00:01:02.793
- We didn't get permission
at all, we're just gonna go.

00:01:02.793 --> 00:01:04.770
- It's an empty Walmart parking lot

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.580
and there are often other RVs and big rigs

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.413
and stuff like that in there, so.

00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:12.010
- I think it'll be fine but
we're gonna go over there,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.710
set up some cones, show
you guys some backing up,

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.200
some cornering, and stuff like that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.545
with a large, large fifth wheel.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:19.930
- He's going to.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:20.763
- I'll do that for you.

00:01:20.763 --> 00:01:22.550
- I'm gonna just stand by and watch.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.260
- So before we go outside and
do the whole towing thing,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.800
pack this rig up and go

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.920
let's talk a little bit about weight.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.133
In the towing equation weight
is the deciding factor;

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.185
if you're being safe,
if you're overloaded.

00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:38.310
Full disclosure, I'm no
certified expert or anything

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.350
but I know a lot about
this 'cause I've studied it

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.410
so we could be safe and
I want to just make sure

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.010
you understand some of the
basics around making sure

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.467
you have the right truck for the right rig

00:01:49.467 --> 00:01:50.880
and the right job.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.713
- [Tara] Guard dog.

00:01:51.713 --> 00:01:52.640
- Hey, hush.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.980
Can't you tell we're filming?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.010
- [Tara] Guard dog.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.949
- [Chad] Haven't you
figured this out by now?

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:56.995
- [Tara] Quiet.

00:01:56.995 --> 00:01:58.240
Good job.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.690
- While I'm gonna go
over the basics of this,

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:02.930
it's up to you to
understand your own numbers

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.603
and get the right information.

00:02:04.603 --> 00:02:07.090
Number one rule in picking out a truck

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.014
is don't believe the dealer.

00:02:09.014 --> 00:02:12.730
They will most likely
not outright lie to you

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.460
but they won't dig into the
facts like you will, hopefully

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.610
or like I did.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.270
We had a Ram dealer that
said for sure that dually

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.730
will tow that 20,000 pound fifth wheel.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.550
Once I dug into the numbers
it would absolutely not,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:27.690
and I'll get to that part
as to why it wouldn't

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.350
when I start talking about this.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.320
So let's dig into some of these numbers.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.610
So one of the first numbers
you're gonna come across

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.940
is called GVWR or gross
vehicle weight rating.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.553
Both the truck and the
rig have their own GVWRs.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.740
So the truck has its gross
vehicle weight rating

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.610
and so does the rig.

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.760
The gross vehicle weight
rating on the truck

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.450
is very important

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.840
when you're talking about
towing a fifth wheel.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.990
If you'll notice the way that
a fifth wheel is designed

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.090
is it's not connected
down here on the bumper

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.560
but your pin usually comes
directly over your rear axle.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.980
I think that had something
to do with the name

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.220
of why it's called a fifth wheel.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.820
The truck is the fifth wheel
or somethin' like that.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.410
Doesn't matter, but the point
is in a typical fifth wheel

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.800
you're lookin' at about an 80/20

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.510
or 75/25 weight distribution.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.510
So as an example, our rig
weighs about 20K total

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.550
and that is our GVWR for the rig.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.550
Now 20 to 25% of that 20K is
gonna be sitting right here.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.560
So you're talking about 4,000
pounds sitting in our bed.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.190
Most single rear wheel trucks

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.040
do not have this kinda capacity.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.970
In fact, on our rig we're
lookin' at more like 25%.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.913
I think when we got weighed we
were lookin' at about 4,500,

00:03:53.913 --> 00:03:56.340
4,600 pounds was on our pin.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.194
That's because we've got a
generator and extra batteries,

00:03:59.194 --> 00:04:02.350
an inverter and a bunch
of stuff sitting up here

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.240
in the front bay.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.163
So the GVRW of the truck,
how do you know what that is?

00:04:06.163 --> 00:04:08.530
Well you can look at
the truck specs online,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.020
that's a good place to start,

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.020
but the final authority of
your GVRW is the door sticker.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.900
You wanna take a look at your door sticker

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.450
and that is the end all
be all final authority

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.980
of how much your truck is rated for cargo

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.920
and that is including the truck itself

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.940
and the engine and the
gas and everything in it,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.080
the everything,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.070
that's the total amount
your truck should weight.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.683
14,000 pounds is our truck's GVWR.

00:04:36.646 --> 00:04:40.143
Our rig's GVWR is 20K.

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.410
There's another number
that you'll wanna know

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.290
and that's the GCWR or the
gross combined weight rating

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.120
and that's again a number
that comes from the truck

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.580
and you won't find that
on your door sticker,

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.930
you'll have to look at that up

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.290
in your truck's information online

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.800
but the GCWR is everything.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.230
That is the rating

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:07.390
that your truck is
designed to pull complete.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.820
The GCWR for our rig is 36K.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.540
And we're gonna get into the truck's specs

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.720
when we go outside but
we've got an F350 dually

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.780
and that's what it's rated at

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.840
for gross combined weight rating.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.950
There's another number,

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:22.480
and I know this is a lot of numbers

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.310
but you kinda gotta get
your head around this

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.160
if you're gonna understand
what's goin' on here

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.890
and what you're rated to pull.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.300
It's called your tow rating.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.620
For us, that is 27.3K

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.180
and that's basically the maximum
trailer that you can pull.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.536
So you'll notice a lot of times
these numbers don't add up.

00:05:40.536 --> 00:05:41.653
A good example is

00:05:41.653 --> 00:05:44.540
if you look at the door
sticker inside your truck

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.560
you'll notice that you have
an axle rating for the front

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.290
and an axle rating for the rear

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:50.800
and if you add these two numbers up

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.330
they're greater than 14K.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.520
That's just so you can
have some wiggle room.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.684
You don't have to have your
14K perfectly balanced.

00:05:57.684 --> 00:06:00.690
14K is still the max number for that.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.410
So let's talk a little bit
about what you can tow.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.760
You wanna stay in this 14K.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.120
You're gonna hear also another
number called cargo capacity

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.216
or sometimes cargo carrying capacity

00:06:11.216 --> 00:06:14.687
and really all that is
is your truck's GVWR

00:06:14.687 --> 00:06:19.687
minus the truck itself,
passengers, cargo, your hitch,

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.795
your toolbox, everything
else you've got in there.

00:06:22.795 --> 00:06:25.360
When you go weigh your truck empty

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.537
and you get that number, let's just,

00:06:26.537 --> 00:06:27.920
I'm just gonna pick it out of the air here

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:30.320
and just say it weighs 9K.

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.320
9K would make our cargo capacity
5K, 14 minus nine is five

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.939
and that's really pretty
close to where we are here.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:40.360
That means I've got
the cargo capacity here

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.250
to take that 46,000 or so pounds
that's sitting on the pin.

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.570
So that's the real crux of the issue

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.269
and when you see online talk about

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:52.420
oh your truck is underrated
for the fifth wheel yada, yada.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.601
fifth wheels are a different
beast than a trailer

00:06:54.601 --> 00:06:57.240
and it's not all about
this tow rating number,

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.190
it's about the cargo capacity number.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.680
You wanna make sure that
everything inside here

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.290
stays under that GVWR.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.080
Another number that I
touched on briefly here

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.790
that I'm not gonna go really too far into

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.186
but you do kinda wanna be
aware of are your axle ratings.

00:07:14.186 --> 00:07:17.150
So in your truck sticker you're
gonna have an axle rating

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.520
for each of your axles and typically

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.860
you're gonna have an axle rating

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.530
on each of your axles for your rig.

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.804
For ours, each of these are 7K.

00:07:25.804 --> 00:07:29.807
So we've got a total of 21K
capacity on these axles.

00:07:29.807 --> 00:07:33.310
Dealing with the 80/20
rule when we're at 20K

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.310
and say we've got 40, that
leaves us 16K on 21K of axles

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:39.920
which is good.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.434
Got plenty of leeway there.

00:07:41.434 --> 00:07:43.410
Where you sometimes see issues

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:46.420
is if you don't have the 3rd axle

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.420
and your GVRW for your
rig is at like 16 five

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.341
and you've got about 12K
sitting on 14K of axles.

00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:56.230
It's cutting a little bit closer

00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.620
and that's where you
sometimes will see people

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:01.540
with these compressed springs
and issues with their axles

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.750
but triple axle rig usually
has plenty of leeway.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.360
Another term you'll
hear is payload capacity

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.100
and that's the same as
your cargo capacity.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.040
Those are the same numbers.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.410
It's how much payload you
can put in the vehicle.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.320
Now again we're strictly
talking about fifth wheels here.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.910
You'll have some similar numbers

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.300
when you're talking
about towing a trailer.

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.220
The difference is your cargo capacity

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.030
doesn't have to be as high

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:25.863
because generally more of your weight

00:08:25.863 --> 00:08:27.900
is sitting on your trailer axles

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.570
and you've got some weight
here called tongue weight

00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.720
or hitch weight on your bumper.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.170
And I'm not gonna go into that,

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:35.720
that's a whole nother ball game.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.980
So let's chat a little bit
about single rear wheel

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:41.450
versus dual rear wheel.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:43.230
This is a highly contentious topic.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.870
If you go online and
bring up I'm pulling this

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:48.620
with a single rear wheel or a dual,

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:53.180
that is a difficult thing
to say, dual rear wheel,

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.984
you're gonna get arguments on both sides.

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:56.740
Where I lie on this

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:59.220
is I don't think you
would ever, ever wanna tow

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.649
a 20K fiver with a single
rear wheel vehicle.

00:09:02.649 --> 00:09:04.480
So do your own homework.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.817
You are the one ultimately
responsible for your rig

00:09:07.817 --> 00:09:08.850
and your own safety.

00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:12.180
So if you choose to tow this big 20K fiver

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.100
on a single rear wheel
vehicle, hey ya know,

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.510
do what you're gonna do.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:18.216
Personally, we wouldn't do it.

00:09:18.216 --> 00:09:19.049
- [Tara] No.

00:09:19.049 --> 00:09:21.580
- Dual rear wheels, it's
a little bit more a pain

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.840
as a daily driver, I'll
completely admit that.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.180
It's a 22 foot truck and
the thing's super wide

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.810
but when you're towing with that thing

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.300
it's solid, it's stable.

00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.060
A lot of people ask online hey,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.433
do you feel when semis
pass you, does it buffet,

00:09:34.433 --> 00:09:35.650
does it move?

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:36.570
Not a bit.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.215
Those four wheels back
here feel nice and secure.

00:09:39.215 --> 00:09:40.291
- [Tara] I like safety.

00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:41.540
(chuckles)

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:44.160
- And no matter how you slice it

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.320
a dual rear wheel setup will
always have more capacity

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.510
and always be safer period.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.986
It's just, ya got four wheels
back there instead of two.

00:09:51.986 --> 00:09:53.874
So the last thing I wanna talk about

00:09:53.874 --> 00:09:55.710
as far as the towing capacity

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:58.479
was the issue that
almost could have bit us

00:09:58.479 --> 00:10:01.600
when we were getting
ready to buy our truck.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:04.180
First of all, we're not brand loyalists

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.565
or crazy about Ford
versus Ram or whatever.

00:10:06.565 --> 00:10:08.790
Know the specs of the truck

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:10.130
and that's where the issue came in.

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:13.120
We were test driving both Ram and Ford

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.670
'cause those were just
kinda the two we liked,

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.200
and we were driving a Ram dually.

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:19.150
Seemed pretty nice, we kinda liked it.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.810
We were still goin' back and forth.

00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:22.720
The salesman was all like oh yeah,

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:25.570
that'll tow 20K fifth wheel no problem.

00:10:25.570 --> 00:10:29.490
So I dig into the specs
and the problem was

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:31.890
the transmission, the axle ratio.

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:33.160
This little guy right here

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.610
that determines basically how
many rotations of the axle

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:38.170
to rotations of the wheel.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:41.630
It ends up being a number
to one, like 3.55 to one,

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.140
4.10 to one.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.330
So you'll hear things
like gear axle ratios

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:47.160
of three five five or four 10.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.070
They're talking about
that three dot five five

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.930
or four dot one oh to one.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:53.205
If you've ever peddled a 10 speed bike

00:10:53.205 --> 00:10:56.160
you know that as you
drop your gear ratio down

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.290
you peddle more and go a little slower

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.410
but you've got more power.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.560
That's the torque.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.647
That's what determines your
towing capacity down here.

00:11:03.647 --> 00:11:05.560
When you've got a higher gear ratio

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.013
you have a higher towing capacity.

00:11:07.013 --> 00:11:10.088
Conversely, you might get a
little bit less gas mileage

00:11:10.088 --> 00:11:11.492
but the bottom line is

00:11:11.492 --> 00:11:14.530
that truck did not have the axle ratio

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:18.387
and did not have the transmission
to tow this big of a rig.

00:11:18.387 --> 00:11:21.217
When I told the sales guy
he was like, oh really?

00:11:21.217 --> 00:11:23.640
I don't know if he knew
or not, he probably didn't

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.633
and there's the problem.

00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:27.330
Don't trust the salespeople
to do your homework

00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:30.130
and to be educated about
all of these things

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:31.220
'cause a lot of them aren't.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.370
It's a lot to take in.

00:11:32.370 --> 00:11:34.720
When we first started studying about this

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.590
to be able to do this safely, it's a bit.

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.900
It's a bit to take in
but do it, understand it,

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:44.983
get a good feel for that
you know this, these numbers

00:11:44.983 --> 00:11:46.900
and that you're safe.

00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:51.833
For us, these wheels and
all this math and stuff

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:52.970
means we're safe

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.690
but this is not just some
weekend camper for us,

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.700
this is our home and if either
one of these breaks down

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.785
or has a problem because of
something we miscalculated

00:12:02.785 --> 00:12:04.330
our house is out of commission

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.022
or we might not have a vehicle to drive.

00:12:06.022 --> 00:12:07.580
So it's very important

00:12:07.580 --> 00:12:09.499
to understand these numbers to be safe.

00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:11.490
So you can't really talk about towing

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.430
without also talking about tires.

00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:15.540
I'm not gonna go big into tires.

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:16.605
We do have a separate video.

00:12:16.605 --> 00:12:17.870
Spiderweb.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.030
We do have a separate
video on tire safety,

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:21.180
we'll like that up here,

00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:23.440
but one thing I wanted
to mention specifically

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.910
in regards to towing is when
you've got more than one axle

00:12:26.910 --> 00:12:28.080
and if you've got a fifth wheel

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.530
you've probably got at
least two, we have three.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.440
When you're pulling a
sharp turn in this thing

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.750
you're gonna be dragging
at least two of your axles.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.707
It's just physics ya know?

00:12:36.707 --> 00:12:38.820
Some of 'em have to drag.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.560
So that's another argument for going slow.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.570
It's easier on your
tires in every situation

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.087
but especially when turning.

00:12:46.087 --> 00:12:47.493
So let's chat just a little bit

00:12:47.493 --> 00:12:50.440
about what we've got going
on here with our hitch

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.110
and our pin box.

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:54.100
The hitch is the piece
that goes in the truck

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:56.040
and the pin box is the
thing that goes on the rig.

00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.176
We upgraded our stock pin box

00:12:58.176 --> 00:13:00.730
which is Lippert Components Flex Air.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:03.030
It's pretty cool because it's
got some built-in features

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:04.890
that help ease the ride

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.330
as far as the rig and truck interaction.

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.040
Got a nice big airbag here with a shock

00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.166
and also the rubber that came on,

00:13:13.166 --> 00:13:15.270
that was just like the
one on our stock unit.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:16.460
It's got a lot of features in there

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:18.880
to kind of help it buffering the shock

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.220
between the rig and the truck
and the truck and the rig

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.100
and you can see it when
we're going down the road.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:24.590
It's doin' some work back there.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.880
We really like it quite a bit.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:29.540
For our hitch we have
the Reese 27.5K or 28K,

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.285
I forget what it's called.

00:13:31.285 --> 00:13:33.130
It's rated at 27,500 pounds.

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.000
We got the Ford branded accessory

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.833
when we were first starting out

00:13:35.833 --> 00:13:37.980
and we really didn't
know much about hitches.

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.480
The reviews on it seemed to be good

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:42.640
so we had Ford put that in
after they did our bed liner

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:43.730
and it's been a great hitch.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:45.300
The key things I would look for

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.980
now that I've been doing this a while,

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.370
we would still use this hitch.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.573
Curt also makes great hitches, so does,

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.640
there's a bunch out there.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:54.020
The things I would look for in a hitch

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:55.330
are fully articulating.

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.210
You want it to be able to pivot like this

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:59.410
so as your rig changes
you don't want it stiff.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.152
I also like the fact that this
one has a nice big single jaw

00:14:02.152 --> 00:14:04.970
that comes across it versus
the two jaws like this.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.850
That was one of the things
that kinda stood out to me,

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:07.770
I like that.

00:14:07.770 --> 00:14:10.452
Also, part of our tow
package with our Ford

00:14:10.452 --> 00:14:12.120
was the puck system.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.090
It's already set up from the
factory with the four pucks

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:19.870
in the bed to basically mount very easily

00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:22.060
any puck-compatible system.

00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.240
Our truck also does
have, like we mentioned,

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.560
the full eight foot bed so there
was no need for any sliders

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.470
or anything like that.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.070
When we get out and do our towing

00:14:30.070 --> 00:14:30.903
we're gonna show you a little bit

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:33.520
about how to check the turning clearance.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.077
You wanna be able to
have your truck and rig,

00:14:37.077 --> 00:14:39.380
you want your truck to be
able to turn at 90 degrees

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:40.700
so you can make proper turns

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.650
and not worry about the cab of the truck

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:45.794
hitting this guy right here.

00:14:45.794 --> 00:14:48.320
The things we had to check
for when we first hitched up

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.410
for the very first time,
one was bed clearance.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.120
You wanna make sure the bottom of this

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.430
clears the bed by at least six inches.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.280
You also wanna make sure if
you've got a toolbox like we do

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.690
that it clears that as well.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:02.548
You also wanna make sure that
your rig is sitting level

00:15:02.548 --> 00:15:04.540
and the truck is sitting level.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.910
You don't wanna have the truck
being bogged down like this,

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:08.290
you don't want it jacked up too high

00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.030
and have your rig like this
and have the tail down.

00:15:10.030 --> 00:15:12.330
The whole setup should be level.

00:15:12.330 --> 00:15:13.660
Two places you can adjust that.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.970
One and the simplest is on the hitch.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.790
Most hitches can be adjusted up and down.

00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:20.150
I think ours has three or
four different placements,

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.463
so you adjust the hitch up and down.

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:25.560
You can also if you need
to adjust this up and down.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:27.130
So in talking about towing,

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:29.550
let's just discuss a
little bit about connecting

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:30.383
and hitching up.

00:15:30.383 --> 00:15:31.860
Obviously, the first thing

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:35.155
is getting that pin into that hitch

00:15:35.155 --> 00:15:37.750
and connecting that up and
making sure it's locked in.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.230
That's number one.

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:40.610
The other two things you have to connect

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.030
are the trailer connection,

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.840
which is your seven pin
connector that supplies power

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.760
to your running lights,
powers your blinkers,

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.121
your break lights, your reverse,
and all that good stuff.

00:15:49.121 --> 00:15:51.409
Also very importantly powers your brakes

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:53.200
and we'll talk a little bit about that

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.000
when we start doing our
towing piece of this.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.310
The third and final thing

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.040
is the emergency cutaway brake system.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:00.930
So on the other side over here

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:06.920
we've got this cable that
runs to a connector over there

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.920
and basically its sole purpose is

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.266
if that thing ever gets pulled out

00:16:10.266 --> 00:16:14.270
it supplies a full 12 volts
DC straight from your battery

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:16.492
to your brakes to put
the brakes on maximum.

00:16:16.492 --> 00:16:18.050
If this things breaks away

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:19.910
you don't want it just
runnin' away willy nilly

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:22.100
down the interstate you want it to stop.

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.220
I mentioned also a little
bit about the eight foot bed.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.150
If you have a six foot bed

00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:28.980
you might need what's
called a slider hitch.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.850
I'm not gonna go into all the
different kinds of hitches,

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:32.760
I'm just giving you a
general overview here

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.000
but you'll notice when we go
to do our turn radius test

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.260
this thing is right up against it.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.510
I mean, this part here
almost touches the cab.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.130
If I go to 92 or so degrees it'll hit.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.180
If you don't have the full eight foot bed

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.930
you can see where that would be a problem.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:48.530
What the slider hitch does

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:53.530
is as the truck turns with the
trailer it also slides back.

00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.460
So it gives you this motion here

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:56.783
to give you that extra clearance you need.

00:16:56.783 --> 00:16:58.050
It's a special kind of hitch

00:16:58.050 --> 00:16:59.530
that you do need for shorter beds.

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.330
You might also see something
about Anderson hitches.

00:17:02.330 --> 00:17:05.890
Those are very controversial
in the fifth wheel world.

00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.090
I'm not gonna go into 'em.

00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:10.010
I personally wouldn't trust
it for something this large.

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:12.990
Some people do, that's fine,
works great for ya, great.

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.460
It's not something we would wanna do.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:18.650
So when we talk about
preparedness for a trip or towing

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.360
one thing you should also be prepared for

00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.580
is the unexpected.

00:17:21.580 --> 00:17:24.800
Now these are some items that
we hope to never ever use

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.100
that I keep right here
underneath our bench seats

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.460
that I have just in case.

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:30.968
Number one, this guy right here.

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:33.100
Obviously it's a fire extinguisher.

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.200
Got one here, got one in
the basement in the rig,

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:38.660
and we also of course have the
ones that came with the rig

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.580
on the inside.

00:17:39.580 --> 00:17:42.480
I like to have extras just in case.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:43.870
These kinda go together here.

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.055
We've got some foldable triangles

00:17:46.055 --> 00:17:50.120
that we can put out on the
road and these are LED flares

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.350
so you don't have to worry
about actually ya know

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.440
sparking up a fire if
you're in a dry season

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.550
on the side of the road.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.230
You can put these out at night

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:59.260
and these out during the day or both

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.050
if you happen to break down

00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.110
and you wanna put these
out behind your vehicle

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.423
to warn other drivers.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:07.740
First aid kit 'cause just in case.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.750
Ya know, it's got a miscellaneous
bunch a stuff in here.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.430
I don't know what I would
need, I'm not a doctor

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.230
but at least we would have
a bunch of first aid stuff

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:16.340
if we ever needed it.

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:17.444
This guy right here.

00:18:17.444 --> 00:18:19.520
If you've ever tried to
break automotive glass

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.900
it's not easy.

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:23.770
This will do it quite easily.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.260
Tap, and it's shattered.

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.010
This is a nice little seatbelt cutter.

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:31.020
I keep this in the center
console again just in case.

00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:33.150
I hope I never need any of this stuff

00:18:33.150 --> 00:18:34.386
but it's there if we need it.

00:18:34.386 --> 00:18:37.700
A little side note here,
you'll notice the exhaust

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.087
for our truck comes out to the side.

00:18:40.087 --> 00:18:43.024
We've seen some issue online

00:18:43.024 --> 00:18:45.520
where people with these diesel trucks

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:47.070
that have super hot exhaust

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.510
that aren't really designed
with this kinda towing in mind

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.950
have the exhaust going
straight out the back.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:54.500
You wanna be really careful with that.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:57.800
That hot exhaust coming out
the back hitting your rig

00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.100
can cause a fire.

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.827
So if you're going to
be buying a fifth wheel

00:19:00.827 --> 00:19:02.140
and you're not sure about your truck,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.220
make sure your exhaust bends to the side

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.640
and not to the back.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:08.240
- Before we get to the
towing portion of this video

00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.284
we thought we would go over
some specs about our truck.

00:19:10.284 --> 00:19:12.710
- Yeah, we've gotten a lot of requests.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:14.560
People wanna know what
kind of truck we tow with,

00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.330
what's the engine, what are
the specs, what's the axle.

00:19:17.330 --> 00:19:19.029
So we wanna go over
all that stuff with you

00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:20.417
so the info's out there,

00:19:20.417 --> 00:19:22.018
I don't know what else to say about that.

00:19:22.018 --> 00:19:22.851
- That's brilliant.

00:19:22.851 --> 00:19:23.684
(chuckles)

00:19:23.684 --> 00:19:24.517
So articulate today.

00:19:24.517 --> 00:19:29.517
- We have a 2017 6.7 liter
turbo diesel Ford F350

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:32.877
which is freakin' awesome.

00:19:32.877 --> 00:19:33.710
- Turbo.

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:34.620
- Very fast, turbo.

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:37.208
It's very powerful, has
a lot of cool features

00:19:37.208 --> 00:19:39.450
that are specifically designed for towing.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.173
We'll go over some of
those inside the truck.

00:19:41.173 --> 00:19:46.049
We have the 3.55 to one gear ratio axle.

00:19:46.049 --> 00:19:48.065
- I don't know anything about gear ratios.

00:19:48.065 --> 00:19:52.170
- And we'll also go over a
couple of the 3rd party items

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.550
that we've added to the
truck and the suspension.

00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:56.820
What do you say we go inside the truck

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:57.834
and go over some of this stuff?

00:19:57.834 --> 00:19:59.001
- Let's do it.

00:20:01.497 --> 00:20:02.630
- Okay so what do you say

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:06.020
we go over some of this truck stuff?

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:07.272
- [Tara] I say okay!

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:09.570
- First off, let's just
get this out of the way.

00:20:09.570 --> 00:20:10.526
This is a Ford truck.

00:20:10.526 --> 00:20:14.430
If you like Rams, if you
like Chevy or whatever cool,

00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:15.338
I don't care.

00:20:15.338 --> 00:20:16.171
- [Tara] We don't care.

00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:18.300
- We're not these brand
loyalist crazy nuts

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.980
where ours is the best and yours sucks.

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.610
So, and that goes for our rig too.

00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.485
We love our Grand Design
but if you've got a Keystone

00:20:24.485 --> 00:20:27.150
or whatever and you love it, cool.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:27.983
- [Tara] Yeah.

00:20:27.983 --> 00:20:29.190
- Just get out there, get
out there in what you can.

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.170
We like our Grand
Design, we like our Ford.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:34.020
We did test drive some Rams in this.

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:34.880
So we were open,

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.013
we just ended up liking
this best in the end.

00:20:37.013 --> 00:20:38.550
- [Tara] This was just the
one that was best for us.

00:20:38.550 --> 00:20:39.383
- Right.

00:20:39.383 --> 00:20:40.960
So the first step is start it

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:42.050
'cause it's fricken' hot in here.

00:20:42.050 --> 00:20:43.050
- [Tara] Oh my gosh.

00:20:44.339 --> 00:20:46.423
(engine turns on)

00:20:46.423 --> 00:20:47.963
- So the trim that we have is the Lariat

00:20:47.963 --> 00:20:50.890
and I think that includes like leather

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:52.890
and things like that, which we like.

00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.723
- [Tara] Leather.

00:20:53.723 --> 00:20:57.020
- So, so let's go over
some of the features

00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.730
that we find are awesome with this truck.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.930
Number one are the mirrors

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:04.387
and you're gonna want these
for, or something like it

00:21:04.387 --> 00:21:07.670
for any type of towing vehicle.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.530
You wanna get the mirrors out far.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:10.380
- [Tara] Yeah, 'cause guess what?

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:12.120
You can't see behind you.

00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.013
- Right, so you gotta get mirrors

00:21:14.013 --> 00:21:16.780
that will extend out beyond
the sides of your rig

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:18.235
so you can see down the sides.

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:21.135
This cool little mirror extender.

00:21:21.135 --> 00:21:26.135
Push this button here, mirrors
go out and they come back in.

00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.824
We also have the ability to
fold them in automatically.

00:21:30.824 --> 00:21:31.887
- [Tara] Hey!

00:21:31.887 --> 00:21:32.837
- A little squeaky.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:39.410
Another great feature of this
vehicle is the engine brake.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.240
If you're familiar with diesel engines

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:43.160
they don't have any natural back pressure

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.690
so like if you're goin' down a hill

00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:46.470
and downshifting in a normal vehicle

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.460
that's not gonna slow you
down in a diesel vehicle.

00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:50.720
Part of what this vehicle
has combined with the turbo

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.810
is the ability to take that exhaust

00:21:52.810 --> 00:21:55.270
and route it back in and
provide some back pressure.

00:21:55.270 --> 00:21:57.910
So this vehicle has a
couple different modes

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.870
and it's all controlled
through a button right here.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.710
So you'll notice it's got just on mode

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.790
where it just supplies
regular back pressure

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:07.720
for just normal downhill and
it's also got an auto mode

00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.820
which is really cool
because what it will do

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:13.351
is you just tap the brake and
it'll try to hold your speed.

00:22:13.351 --> 00:22:16.621
It also works in conjunction
with the cruise control

00:22:16.621 --> 00:22:19.020
so if you're going uphill then downhill

00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:21.610
then uphill and downhill it'll
pretty much take care of it

00:22:21.610 --> 00:22:24.100
unless you're like at a
six or 7% grade or more.

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.541
So it's pretty cool.

00:22:25.541 --> 00:22:28.850
Another feature of this
vehicle that should be standard

00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.190
on anything you're towing

00:22:30.190 --> 00:22:34.020
anything of a substantial size
with is a brake controller.

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.922
So this has it built in
and it's right down here.

00:22:36.922 --> 00:22:39.330
So this is what we use
when we do our pull check,

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.163
if you saw that video.

00:22:40.163 --> 00:22:43.048
We squeeze this to get the brake engaged

00:22:43.048 --> 00:22:47.340
and then we can adjust
the gain of the brakes

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:50.400
and so what that does is it adjusts

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.440
how much voltage is supplied
to your trailer brakes

00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.240
in conjunction with your foot brake.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.350
And we're not gonna go into
how to get that adjusted,

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.740
that's a whole nother topic.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.470
You can find lots of those online

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:03.570
but you essentially want it so
that when you press the brake

00:23:03.570 --> 00:23:05.120
it also slows the trailer down

00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.590
but you don't want them
fighting each other.

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:08.820
You don't want the brakes
too strong pulling the truck

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.130
and you don't want the brakes too weak

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:11.103
where it's pushing the truck.

00:23:11.103 --> 00:23:12.260
This is not a video

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.800
about how to adjust the
gain on your trailer brakes.

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.460
I will put a couple of links
in the comments below though

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.202
to some resources that I find useful.

00:23:19.202 --> 00:23:21.620
Another feature that we find very useful

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.717
is the ultimate tow camera package.

00:23:23.717 --> 00:23:25.960
This thing has seven cameras on it.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.130
There's one on the bumper,
one on each mirror,

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:31.719
one up above the bed of the
truck, one on the tailgate.

00:23:31.719 --> 00:23:34.052
One, two, three, four, five.

00:23:35.466 --> 00:23:36.855
I don't know where the seven cameras are?

00:23:36.855 --> 00:23:39.659
(laughing)

00:23:39.659 --> 00:23:41.390
And they all work in conjunction

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.513
to give you this cool bird's eye view.

00:23:43.513 --> 00:23:46.140
So this is the view from the front bumper

00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.330
and this is the bird's eye view.

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.170
You can see very clearly
that we're not on the grass,

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.424
like we're not supposed to be here.

00:23:51.424 --> 00:23:52.487
(laughing)

00:23:52.487 --> 00:23:55.900
So you can see Lucille back
here, you can see the edges.

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.065
So this is really cool when
you're trying to park this beast

00:23:58.065 --> 00:24:02.020
in a Walmart or something or
ya know just as a daily driver.

00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.860
It's really nice to be able to see this.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:05.503
Now I can touch this button here

00:24:05.503 --> 00:24:07.270
and I can get some alternate views.

00:24:07.270 --> 00:24:09.120
There's the front view in full screen

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:12.130
and here's my rear view split.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:14.160
So you won't see this
until you're in reverse

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:16.520
but you can see I've
got my split screen here

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.460
with my top-down view
and my bumper view there.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.300
I can switch over and see
just the bumper view by itself

00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:26.290
with some warning signals
here on the top-down view.

00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.270
I can go in here and see
this nice little split view

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:30.530
from the sides.

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:34.960
You can also see inside
the bed of the truck.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.159
This is really cool sometimes

00:24:36.159 --> 00:24:38.350
when trying to line this thing up.

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.420
Mostly I just turn around
and look with my eyeballs

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.040
but this is still kinda cool.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:43.380
And then there's the trailer camera

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.660
looking down both sides of the rig there.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.436
It's kinda neat having
all those cameras now.

00:24:47.436 --> 00:24:50.880
Do we use them all like when
backing up and hitching?

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:51.713
Not really.

00:24:51.713 --> 00:24:54.400
I pretty much just turn around
and look out the back window

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.840
but I have used that and it's kinda neat

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:56.770
to be able to line things up.

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:57.603
It's really cool

00:24:57.603 --> 00:25:00.970
having that top-down bird's
eye view for parking.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.240
So some things that we've added

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.670
that did not come with the
truck that we find very useful.

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:08.000
One of them the jury's
still out on whether or not

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:08.833
we think it helps.

00:25:08.833 --> 00:25:12.310
It's the load lifter 7500 XL airbags.

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.632
- I don't really know that they help.

00:25:13.632 --> 00:25:14.720
(laughing)

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.850
I still feel like we have a rough ride.

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:19.050
- Yeah, the ride in here is a bit rough,

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.370
especially on some of those
roads in the northeast,

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:22.557
they just beat the hell outta ya.

00:25:22.557 --> 00:25:23.809
- [Tara] And you mean Indiana?

00:25:23.809 --> 00:25:25.383
- Indiana was horrible.

00:25:25.383 --> 00:25:26.870
The first thing we got

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:29.790
that I think helps mostly
in slower situations

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:32.290
and not towing is the sulastic shackles

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:33.200
and we'll show you those.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.860
Those basically help cushion the span

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:37.781
between the leaf springs and the frame,

00:25:37.781 --> 00:25:40.240
give it a little bit of
extra shock absorption.

00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:44.850
We also added the Airlift 7500 XL airbags

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.160
with remote control and that's
that little guy right here.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.390
Pops right off.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.500
I can adjust the pressure up and down.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.770
We keep it at five PSI when
not towing and bump it up.

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:56.310
You can hear it come on there.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.530
Bump it up to 45 when we're towing.

00:25:58.530 --> 00:26:00.060
The nice thing about
having this remote control

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.380
is we can play around with
the different pressures

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:03.370
and kinda see.

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:07.470
I found 45 PSI seems to have
the best balance and ride.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:11.160
Additionally, we have a
Furrion observation camera

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.650
and our rig and a lot of newer
fifth wheels and trailers

00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:18.200
come prewired and have a
mount built in ready to go

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.060
for the Furrion observation camera.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:23.060
One catch on wiring that up
is typically those are wired

00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:27.160
directly into a hot circuit
that will drain your battery

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.720
if you leave your camera
on and plugged in.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.250
We wired ours into the running lights

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:32.870
so that when I turn the
lights to the on mode

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:35.580
it supplies DC power through
the trailer connection

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.130
to the running lights and
to the observation camera.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.440
You wanna make sure you
get the observation camera

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.655
and not just the backup camera.

00:26:42.655 --> 00:26:45.650
The observation camera let's
you see while you're driving

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:47.910
and honestly that's
where we use it the most.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.130
When I'm wanting to change
lanes, I'm passing somebody,

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.200
or somebody's passing
me or I need to get over

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.850
I check my mirrors but I also
check the observation camera

00:26:54.850 --> 00:26:57.380
to make sure that the
car is indeed behind us

00:26:57.380 --> 00:26:58.940
and it does have some markers on there

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.747
to show you safe distances.

00:27:00.747 --> 00:27:04.280
A really good item to have
in this litigious society

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.186
in which we live is a dash cam.

00:27:07.186 --> 00:27:08.940
(musical chimes)

00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.930
This thing with a 64 gigabyte card

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.350
will record about five hours in a loop,

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:16.190
and it records both inside and outside

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:21.190
and with the addition of this
GPS mount it gets GPS data

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.690
so that inscribed on your
video is your location

00:27:24.690 --> 00:27:25.580
and your speed.

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:27.727
A very, very important item to have

00:27:27.727 --> 00:27:30.260
and I don't consider this
an option for us at least

00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.740
is a TPMS, tire pressure
monitoring system.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:35.107
- We just put together a video on our TPMS

00:27:35.107 --> 00:27:37.560
and tire safety so you can check that out

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.330
by clicking the link right here.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:40.840
We're not gonna go into a lot of detail

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:43.660
about how to program and
stuff like that with the TPMS.

00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.190
- A key item when setting
up camp, backing up,

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:47.810
anything to do with communicating

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.980
outside with your significant other

00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:52.704
working on the rig are
these guys right here.

00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:55.120
(beeps)

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.120
- These guys right here.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:56.953
- Boom.

00:27:58.052 --> 00:27:59.323
- What's your vector Victor?

00:27:59.323 --> 00:28:00.156
(beep)

00:28:00.156 --> 00:28:00.989
(chuckles)

00:28:00.989 --> 00:28:03.050
- So these things here are great.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.480
People use cellphones
or whatever, that's fine

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.300
but what if you don't
have cellphone coverage?

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.222
Get a good radio and
you'll just find it's nice

00:28:10.222 --> 00:28:13.322
to be able to pick this up
and say light check. (beep)

00:28:13.322 --> 00:28:15.139
- Check. (beep)

00:28:15.139 --> 00:28:16.219
(laughing)

00:28:16.219 --> 00:28:18.020
So we're gonna hitch up

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.250
and we're gonna head over to Walmart

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.397
or formerly known as Walmart.

00:28:21.397 --> 00:28:23.720
- The parking lot formerly
known as Walmart parking lot.

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:24.860
- That's right.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.360
(car engine and clicking)

00:28:29.585 --> 00:28:30.600
- So we're all hitched up

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.530
headed over to the abandoned parking lot.

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.000
- That's right, if you
are interested in seeing

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.220
the whole hitching up
process check out our video

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.320
complete camp breakdown and setup,

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.557
which we will link it up right up there.

00:28:42.557 --> 00:28:44.572
- It's really long but a lot of info.

00:28:44.572 --> 00:28:45.657
We have time codes so you
can skip through if you want.

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:47.460
- That's right, very long.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:50.820
So after what, 10 months
of towing the fifth wheel

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.350
you seem to be pretty good.

00:28:52.350 --> 00:28:53.980
- [Chad] I'm pretty
comfortable with it now.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.040
It was not always so easy.

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.533
- [Tara] Well you'd never
towed a fifth wheel before.

00:28:57.533 --> 00:28:58.366
- [Chad] Yeah.

00:28:58.366 --> 00:28:59.199
I'm never gonna say it's easy

00:28:59.199 --> 00:29:00.930
but I'm much more comfortable with it now.

00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:04.690
But yeah, we had never
towed anything like this.

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:07.607
(light rock music)

00:29:17.923 --> 00:29:19.070
- This is the parking lot

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:20.874
formerly known as the Walmart parking lot.

00:29:20.874 --> 00:29:21.707
(chuckles)

00:29:21.707 --> 00:29:23.242
- [Chad] Right, we got lots of room here.

00:29:23.242 --> 00:29:24.300
We're gonna set up some cones.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:26.350
We're gonna go through a
couple different maneuvers.

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.090
We'll go over those with ya in a minute.

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:31.183
- Yeah, and I'm gonna be on
the handy dandy walkie talkie

00:29:31.183 --> 00:29:34.320
so that I know what's goin'
on and what he's doing

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.150
and how I can help him in any way.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:39.260
- So let's talk a little
bit about a successful trip

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:40.410
from point A to point B.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:41.730
- It requires a lot of planning.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:42.790
- Yeah.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:43.623
- For us.

00:29:43.623 --> 00:29:44.456
- Yeah, we like to plan.

00:29:44.456 --> 00:29:46.020
We're not willy nilly hookup and go

00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:47.360
and figure it out on the way kinda people.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.920
We like to know exactly where we're going,

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.560
exactly how we're gonna get there.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.460
- If you watched our
breakdown and setup video

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.376
you know we have a lot of
checklists that we use.

00:29:54.376 --> 00:29:56.195
- Yeah, I mean look at this thing.

00:29:56.195 --> 00:29:59.320
We're towin' this ginormous
thing and when we get there

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.050
I wanna know what it looks
like, how we're gonna enter,

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:03.990
ya know I wanna know all
the stuff about our things.

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:05.320
So some of the tools that we use,

00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.120
and it's part of our checklist
also the night before,

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.510
is our trip planning.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:12.060
One of our favorite tools
for planning our stays

00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:14.860
and our where we're gonna
go is RV Trip Wizard.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:16.790
Really great tool, it
is subscription based

00:30:16.790 --> 00:30:17.910
but we do recommend that.

00:30:17.910 --> 00:30:20.440
Some of the things we look
for when we're planning it out

00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.669
is gas stops.

00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:23.400
RV Trip Wizard also will tell you

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.294
where you're gonna run out of gas,

00:30:25.294 --> 00:30:26.752
where you need to get gas in your trip.

00:30:26.752 --> 00:30:27.827
- And where you're gonna eat.

00:30:27.827 --> 00:30:29.400
- Yes, plan where you're gonna eat.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.580
And we go so far as to
use Google street view

00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.064
and Google Earth to take a
look at the part we're going to

00:30:36.064 --> 00:30:38.473
and figure out okay, how does it look?

00:30:38.473 --> 00:30:40.670
Does it look tight, are we
gonna be able to get in?

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:41.960
I'll even go down to street view

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:45.587
and go into the park if I
can, look at the entrance.

00:30:45.587 --> 00:30:46.420
And that also kinda helps you

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.090
because when you get there
you've already seen it.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.490
- We've actually not
reserved certain sites

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.690
because we looked at them on Google Earth.

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:54.575
We also, the day of

00:30:54.575 --> 00:30:58.430
use our GPS app on our
phone called CoPilot.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:31:01.740
- Yep, this thing let's
you put in your dimensions

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.420
and weight of your rig,

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.830
specifically the height
is the most scary part

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:07.210
and it will route you accordingly.

00:31:07.210 --> 00:31:10.260
It's based on trucker
data so routes truckers,

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:13.144
this thing's about as
tall at 13 feet six inches

00:31:13.144 --> 00:31:15.000
as a commercial truck

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.220
so we wanna make sure we
don't hit any low bridges.

00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.620
- Yeah, and I also have an app on my phone

00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:21.070
that's called Rest Stops.

00:31:21.070 --> 00:31:22.270
It's not that great of an app.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:25.320
It sometimes frustrates
me but when it does work,

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.440
ya know you can see the rest
stops that are closest to you

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.960
and ya know all that good stuff.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.793
'Cause rest stops are important
as well as fuel stops.

00:31:31.793 --> 00:31:32.940
- Yep.

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.080
- Something that is always
in the back of my mind

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:36.360
and I'm kind of paranoid about it

00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:37.193
is the weather.

00:31:37.193 --> 00:31:39.845
We have a little portable weather radio

00:31:39.845 --> 00:31:40.730
that we keep in the truck

00:31:40.730 --> 00:31:43.530
so if we are expecting some
bad weather we can use that

00:31:43.530 --> 00:31:44.740
which just kinda helps give me

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:46.070
a little bit more piece of mind.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:47.130
- Additionally, know a little bit

00:31:47.130 --> 00:31:48.760
about the overall weather systems

00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.957
because you don't wanna tow
this thing in high wind.

00:31:50.957 --> 00:31:54.390
I would say that around
20 mile per hour winds

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:55.280
is our cutoff.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.610
We haven't had to drive in high winds

00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:57.980
but this thing is really stable.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.860
People ask us a lot

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:00.740
about when trucks pass
us on the interstate,

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:02.071
does that wind buffet or knock you?

00:32:02.071 --> 00:32:02.904
No, not a bit.

00:32:02.904 --> 00:32:03.737
- No.

00:32:03.737 --> 00:32:04.570
- Not with this big dually.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:06.570
So if you watched our tire safety video

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.530
you know that we inspect our tires

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:11.400
and the linkages and all
the stuff under there

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.460
before our trip.

00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:14.950
We also, during our
trip, check everything.

00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:17.410
I mean, you're pulled over,
you're at a rest area,

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:19.866
walk around, look at your
tires, feel your tires,

00:32:19.866 --> 00:32:21.970
look at your shackles.

00:32:21.970 --> 00:32:23.490
Just kinda make sure
everything looks good.

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:24.450
Check your treads.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:25.640
Why not, you're stopped.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.930
You don't know what you might've run over

00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:28.223
in the last 100 miles.

00:32:28.223 --> 00:32:29.390
- You don't know what you don't know.

00:32:29.390 --> 00:32:31.581
And he'll also take a
look inside the garage

00:32:31.581 --> 00:32:32.840
and check on Lucille

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.373
and make sure that all those
things are nice and snug.

00:32:36.373 --> 00:32:37.373
- Yeah definitely.

00:32:37.373 --> 00:32:38.372
If you've got a toy hauler

00:32:38.372 --> 00:32:39.680
and you've got a big motorcycle
in the back like we do,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:42.040
any time we stop I will
just pop the door open,

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:43.340
hop in there, check the straps,

00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:45.708
make sure everything is
secure again 'cause why not?

00:32:45.708 --> 00:32:48.639
Additionally, while you're traveling

00:32:48.639 --> 00:32:51.750
don't get in a hurry at
any part of your journey.

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:54.550
Setting up, breaking down, the travel.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.130
Take your time and if
you're getting in a hurry

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:57.510
that's when mistakes are made.

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:58.643
- Don't have the need for speed.

00:32:58.643 --> 00:32:59.670
- That's right.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:00.736
No top gun.

00:33:00.736 --> 00:33:01.670
(chuckling)

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:06.160
Also, we never travel over
65 miles per hour ever.

00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:08.530
That's our top end even
when the speed limit's 70

00:33:08.530 --> 00:33:09.398
or sometimes 75.

00:33:09.398 --> 00:33:12.980
Additionally, if the speed limit
is say 60 we usually go 55.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:14.910
If it's 65 we go 60.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:15.820
We're always going a little bit slower

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.370
than the average traffic

00:33:17.370 --> 00:33:20.850
because we're pullin'
30,000 pounds down the road

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:23.580
and our stopping distance is
not the same as anybody else.

00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.850
- Yeah, and so what, it takes
a little longer to get there.

00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:28.060
At least we're being safe.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:31.615
- Yep, and honestly going 70, 75 versus 65

00:33:31.615 --> 00:33:33.451
it does not gain you that much.

00:33:33.451 --> 00:33:34.284
- Not that much.

00:33:34.284 --> 00:33:36.410
- Also, when you get near your area,

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:37.630
when you get off the interstate

00:33:37.630 --> 00:33:40.662
and you're on surface
streets go extra slow.

00:33:40.662 --> 00:33:42.360
I mean, if you're gonna hit something

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.300
or something's gonna happen,
going slow has two benefits.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.610
A, if that something does
happen it's gonna be less damage

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:49.806
because you're going slower

00:33:49.806 --> 00:33:51.585
and B, you've got more time to react.

00:33:51.585 --> 00:33:53.890
- Once you get to the RV park

00:33:53.890 --> 00:33:55.647
or whatever destination
where you're going,

00:33:55.647 --> 00:33:58.140
we always get out and we take a look

00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:00.840
at where we are supposed
to park this thing.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.635
- Yeah, ya know I see some
people come into sites

00:34:03.635 --> 00:34:05.880
and they just pull right in
and they wanna back right in,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.036
they gotta do it five times.

00:34:07.036 --> 00:34:10.700
Ya know, again, it goes
back to go slow, park it,

00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.000
get out, look around.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.511
GOAL, G-O-A-L get out and look.

00:34:14.511 --> 00:34:17.219
That term stuck with me from
a class we took at Lazy Days

00:34:17.219 --> 00:34:19.244
and quite honestly it's brilliant

00:34:19.244 --> 00:34:20.710
because if you're backing in,

00:34:20.710 --> 00:34:22.630
even if you're in the middle of backing in

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.040
and you're thinking okay,
I want a better picture

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:26.275
of what's going on here in my head,

00:34:26.275 --> 00:34:29.560
as the driver I will park
it, put the brake on,

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:30.700
and get out, walk around,

00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.154
and look and get a feel for the area.

00:34:32.154 --> 00:34:32.987
- And he will.

00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:34.364
He will get out several
times if he needs to

00:34:34.364 --> 00:34:36.817
and that's fine, I've come to expect it.

00:34:36.817 --> 00:34:39.188
I didn't quite expect it in the beginning.

00:34:39.188 --> 00:34:41.270
- Another tip when you're setting up,

00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:44.080
when you're trying to get
parked, if it's not goin' well,

00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:46.477
if you just can't quite
wiggle that thing in there.

00:34:46.477 --> 00:34:47.608
- It doesn't feel right.

00:34:47.608 --> 00:34:50.060
- Yeah it doesn't feel right,
don't be afraid to start over.

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:52.340
Pull out, drive around the
loop or whatever it is,

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:53.860
or just pull out and pull forward.

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:54.914
We've done that several times.

00:34:54.914 --> 00:34:55.913
- Yeah, no big deal.

00:34:55.913 --> 00:34:57.383
- Where I'm not quite
gettin' that angle right,

00:34:57.383 --> 00:34:58.390
I'm like ya know what?

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.619
I'm just gonna pull up and just try again.

00:34:59.619 --> 00:35:01.550
- So we're gonna do some maneuvers now.

00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:03.060
- Yep, we're gonna set up some cones

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.580
and we're gonna do some things.

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.795
- Hopefully we don't get asked to leave.

00:35:05.795 --> 00:35:06.930
- Yeah.

00:35:06.930 --> 00:35:08.580
One of the things we're
gonna show you first

00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:10.574
is checking your turning clearance.

00:35:10.574 --> 00:35:11.663
- What's your clearance, Clarence?

00:35:12.624 --> 00:35:13.457
(chuckles)

00:35:13.457 --> 00:35:15.640
- So we're gonna go over
making a right-hand turn.

00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.750
Of course, there's gonna be cones

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:18.950
but it'll give you a feel for
how wide you've gotta turn

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.007
in this big guy here.

00:35:20.007 --> 00:35:21.520
We're also gonna film

00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.430
what it's like pulling
into a pull-through site,

00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:24.610
which is super easy.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:25.767
- Easiest ones to get into.

00:35:25.767 --> 00:35:27.470
- Not much different than making a turn

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:29.040
other than you're trying
to get that left side

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.950
lined up perfectly when
you make that turn.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.690
And we're also going to
do two back-in scenarios,

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:35.843
one most common which is an angle back-in

00:35:35.843 --> 00:35:37.880
and then we're gonna do a 90 degree,

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.119
which are not fun.

00:35:39.119 --> 00:35:40.120
- No.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:40.953
- Because you'll see,
you've gotta get out wide.

00:35:40.953 --> 00:35:42.992
- Yeah, you might have to
run over giant tree stumps.

00:35:42.992 --> 00:35:46.040
- Yeah or medians like
your brother's driveway.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.130
- Yeah, there's a couple of
times we've had that scenario

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:49.950
so it's good for us to show you.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.289
- Yeah, so let's go do this.

00:35:51.289 --> 00:35:53.570
So this first thing we're gonna show you

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:54.857
is kind of two tips in one.

00:35:54.857 --> 00:35:56.165
One, we're gonna show you

00:35:56.165 --> 00:35:58.540
how to do a turning clearance check

00:35:58.540 --> 00:36:00.920
but in the process I'm
gonna do a maneuver,

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.620
I don't know I call it the wiggle.

00:36:03.668 --> 00:36:07.030
You basically forward back,
forward back, forward back,

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:08.510
forward back so--

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:09.820
- Did you just make that name up?

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.790
- I did.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:12.079
I did just make that up.

00:36:12.079 --> 00:36:12.912
(automobile engine)

00:36:12.912 --> 00:36:14.060
- Keep it down, we're filming.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:15.580
- Where you essentially wiggle the truck

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:18.770
back and forth like
this so that the pin box

00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:21.530
kinda stays in the place
and you can turn the truck.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:22.517
What you're really doin' there

00:36:22.517 --> 00:36:24.360
is if you think about a fifth wheel,

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.520
the way the mount is, the
truck is the turning point.

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.700
It's like the front
wheels for the trailer.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.080
So turning the entire truck

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:34.450
is like turning the front
wheels on a vehicle.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.670
That's the direction the rig will go.

00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:38.017
Watch, you'll see what I'm talking about.

00:36:38.017 --> 00:36:39.298
- All right, let's do it.

00:36:39.298 --> 00:36:40.131
- Let's do it.

00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:43.810
(light rock music)

00:36:43.810 --> 00:36:45.963
You'll see, hopefully with
the other camera down here,

00:36:45.963 --> 00:36:48.574
that I'm gonna try to
keep the line of the rig

00:36:48.574 --> 00:36:50.891
right where it is and
turn the truck that way.

00:36:50.891 --> 00:36:54.387
(musical chimes)

00:36:54.387 --> 00:36:56.150
It's just a sequence.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:58.089
A little bit forward,

00:36:58.089 --> 00:37:00.463
let's turn the wheel
the opposite direction,

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.553
move it back.

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:10.363
A little bit back.

00:37:15.563 --> 00:37:19.700
And you'll notice that
the rig is barely moving.

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:24.640
This is a good way to tow
and get a sharper angle

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.050
when you don't have a lot of space.

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:29.400
You just have to be
careful with the tire drag.

00:37:30.877 --> 00:37:33.622
Which is another reason to go slow.

00:37:33.622 --> 00:37:36.539
(light rock music)

00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.096
90 degrees.

00:37:48.096 --> 00:37:51.013
(light rock music)

00:37:51.942 --> 00:37:53.575
- How'd ya like that?

00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:55.842
- So as you can see the rig barely moved

00:37:55.842 --> 00:37:59.020
and I got the truck all
the way over to 90 degrees.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:00.427
So as part of this you can now see,

00:38:00.427 --> 00:38:04.180
and we'll get some closeup
shots, I can get the 90 degrees

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:07.770
and I'm not hitting the rig
on the bed of the truck.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:09.290
I've got clearance over the toolbox

00:38:09.290 --> 00:38:11.302
which wasn't the case
with our first toolbox.

00:38:11.302 --> 00:38:12.309
- Yeah.

00:38:12.309 --> 00:38:14.370
- Also a shoutout to Lazy Days.

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:16.973
During our delivery process and our PDI

00:38:16.973 --> 00:38:19.274
they came out and helped us do this

00:38:19.274 --> 00:38:21.451
and showed us how to do this

00:38:21.451 --> 00:38:24.020
to make sure that we were
good to go down the road.

00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:25.530
They weren't gonna let
us just hitch up and go.

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.030
So thank you Lazy Days.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:27.863
- [Tara] That was really cool.

00:38:27.863 --> 00:38:30.506
- Yeah, another thing that
this maneuver is good for

00:38:30.506 --> 00:38:35.340
is if you've really gotta
back into a tight, tight area.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:38.230
The big problem is when
you're turning a rig like this

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:39.770
you're pivoting on the axles.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:41.033
That has a couple of problems.

00:38:41.033 --> 00:38:43.460
One is you're gonna
always have trailer drag.

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.330
With two or three axles there's
always gonna be some tires

00:38:46.330 --> 00:38:49.380
that are dragging across and
some that are just rolling.

00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.110
So another reason to go very slow

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:52.570
is to take care of your tires.

00:38:52.570 --> 00:38:54.617
Also, you're gonna have
a lot more trailer swing

00:38:54.617 --> 00:38:57.110
and your truck and rig is
gonna swing out a lot more.

00:38:57.110 --> 00:39:00.380
So just because you can turn
it at a 90 degree sharp angle

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:01.543
doesn't mean it's easy.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:03.610
- You made it look easy.

00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:07.097
- Okay so now we're gonna
do an angle back-in.

00:39:07.097 --> 00:39:11.970
I would try to get over
close to it but not too close

00:39:11.970 --> 00:39:13.520
'cause I wanna be able to cut it in.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.810
If you can let me know

00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:18.713
when my back tires just
go past the last cones.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:24.160
I am going to get my rear wheels well past

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:25.010
where I want it to turn

00:39:25.010 --> 00:39:28.083
because you have to turn these
things and cut very early.

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.530
I think the wheels are past right?

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:33.683
- [Tara] Yeah, you just
past it, you were good.

00:39:33.683 --> 00:39:36.600
(light rock music)

00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:05.413
- [Tara] Really nice.

00:40:05.413 --> 00:40:08.330
(light rock music)

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:10.620
- Okay I'm gonna back up a little bit.

00:40:10.620 --> 00:40:12.831
I'm gonna make this right-hand turn.

00:40:12.831 --> 00:40:13.692
- [Tara] Okay.

00:40:13.692 --> 00:40:16.330
(musical chimes)

00:40:16.330 --> 00:40:18.630
All right, so this is how
I make a right-hand turn.

00:40:18.630 --> 00:40:20.050
I would come out wide.

00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:21.890
You sometimes have to straddle the line

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.995
and let everybody know in
that turn lane or left lane

00:40:24.995 --> 00:40:29.040
that you're going to be
using that lane, it's yours.

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:31.750
Don't be afraid to make people angry

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.243
who don't tow trailers
'cause they just don't know.

00:40:34.243 --> 00:40:37.010
So I can see now that I am coming up,

00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:38.494
my front wheels are just past

00:40:38.494 --> 00:40:42.550
and my back wheels are just
past, actually about now

00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:45.511
and I am only now going to start turning.

00:40:45.511 --> 00:40:48.428
(light rock music)

00:40:51.570 --> 00:40:55.892
And you'll see that
inside track will follow

00:40:55.892 --> 00:40:58.690
and I'll over correct
all the way into the turn

00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:06.726
and then boom, easy as that.

00:41:06.726 --> 00:41:09.309
(dog whimpers)

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:17.310
And now we're going to do a
standard pull-through site,

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:18.812
which are amazing

00:41:18.812 --> 00:41:20.674
because they're basically just
a left-hand turn typically.

00:41:20.674 --> 00:41:25.674
Just gonna pull up here and
just make a wide turn in.

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.920
Always go as far as
you can without hitting

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:34.063
whatever is gonna be in front.

00:41:34.063 --> 00:41:36.980
(light rock music)

00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:45.260
So now we are going to
do a 90 degree back-in,

00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:46.830
which is generally the most difficult.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:51.300
It's gonna require the highest
angle truck to trailer.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:52.133
You ready?

00:41:52.133 --> 00:41:53.644
- [Tara] Ready.

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:56.140
- All right, so we're gonna go past this.

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:58.320
I'm gonna have to cut
the trailer really hard

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.940
to get it in here.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:02.390
Let me know when I'm just
past the outside cones.

00:42:08.916 --> 00:42:10.105
- [Tara] Just past.

00:42:10.105 --> 00:42:11.780
- Thank you.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.603
So now I'm gonna have to kinda
do that walkover maneuver

00:42:13.603 --> 00:42:15.020
that I did before

00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:21.293
except I'm gonna have to
really severely cut it.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:29.360
And this is where bed
clearance and truck clearance

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.243
makes a big difference.

00:42:39.167 --> 00:42:40.870
Just kind of getting hard angle one way

00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:44.180
then I'll have to get the
hard angle the other way.

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:46.883
So I've got a good angle
now to be turning in there.

00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:51.540
Always check this side,

00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.553
make sure you're not
gonna run into anything.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:57.333
Now the trailer is getting
close to being on the angle.

00:42:59.105 --> 00:43:02.517
So I'm gonna start wiggling
this thing back to the right.

00:43:02.517 --> 00:43:05.600
(country rock music)

00:43:09.585 --> 00:43:11.579
- [Tara] Doing great babe.

00:43:11.579 --> 00:43:13.290
Come back, right there.

00:43:13.290 --> 00:43:16.373
(country rock music)

00:43:20.293 --> 00:43:22.480
Perfect, you go straight back.

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.957
- And obviously you can see the catch

00:43:25.957 --> 00:43:29.620
with a right-angle turn like this

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:32.670
is that the front of the rig and the truck

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:37.670
has to come really wide and
that is just unavoidable.

00:43:38.104 --> 00:43:38.937
- [Tara] Perfect.

00:43:38.937 --> 00:43:40.950
- That's it, we're in the 90 degree spot.

00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:45.358
Special thanks to our
supplemental camera operators.

00:43:45.358 --> 00:43:46.191
- Yes.

00:43:46.191 --> 00:43:47.863
- Aka my dad and my mom.

00:43:49.092 --> 00:43:50.810
- He's a pro.

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:51.968
- That's right.

00:43:51.968 --> 00:43:53.210
- When your mom says
you're a pro, you're a pro.

00:43:53.210 --> 00:43:54.043
It's how it works.

00:43:54.043 --> 00:43:55.103
- That's exactly right.

00:43:55.103 --> 00:43:56.300
(laughing)

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.650
So that's it in a nutshell.

00:43:59.140 --> 00:44:02.160
- Hopefully this didn't blow
up to a really huge video

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:03.730
but it's got a lot of good info in it.

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:04.940
We hope you liked it.

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:08.370
When we were researching
fifth wheels and how to tow

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:11.430
I couldn't find anything that
actually showed real towing.

00:44:11.430 --> 00:44:13.430
So we hope you liked that part.

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:17.880
- Right, and hopefully it
was helpful and helpful.

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.010
(laughs)

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:20.370
And hopefully it was helpful for you.

00:44:20.370 --> 00:44:23.420
- So just a quick summary
of kind of what we feel

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:27.140
are some important points in
towing this gigantic monster.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.083
Number one, go slow.

00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:29.916
- Yeah.

00:44:29.916 --> 00:44:32.530
- Both when you're setting
up, when you're hitching,

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:36.080
when you're backing in
especially, go slow.

00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.120
Get out and look.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.010
- Take your time.

00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:38.843
- Yeah, don't be in a hurry.

00:44:38.843 --> 00:44:42.490
When you get in a hurry at
any part of the whole process

00:44:42.490 --> 00:44:43.930
it breeds problems.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:46.040
- Walkie talkies are a really good idea

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.140
so that you can have your
partner in the back spotting

00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.650
and helping guide you.

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.650
- Planning your route the
night before is a huge help.

00:44:52.650 --> 00:44:53.790
You know what you're getting into.

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:55.390
You know what to look
for when you get there.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:57.982
You've already put your
eyeballs on the virtual target.

00:44:57.982 --> 00:44:59.511
- Virtual target.

00:44:59.511 --> 00:45:01.184
- Well you know, on Google it's virtual

00:45:01.184 --> 00:45:02.730
so you know when you
get to the real target

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:03.563
you're prepared for it.

00:45:03.563 --> 00:45:05.260
It's, I think that comes
from military training.

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:07.420
You train visually to everything

00:45:07.420 --> 00:45:09.513
that way when you see it in
real life you're ready for it.

00:45:09.513 --> 00:45:10.868
- It's good to have as much
knowledge ahead of time

00:45:10.868 --> 00:45:11.910
as possible.

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:12.890
- Absolutely.

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:15.960
So along with the planning of
course checklists always help.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.790
If you've ever seen our camp
breakdown and setup video

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:20.244
you know we're big on checklists.

00:45:20.244 --> 00:45:21.077
- Yeah.

00:45:21.077 --> 00:45:22.130
- You make sure you're
not gonna miss anything

00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:22.963
if you have a checklist.

00:45:22.963 --> 00:45:25.210
If you use it all the time, don't skip it,

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:26.330
it will save you for sure.

00:45:26.330 --> 00:45:28.527
- Right, and I think most importantly,

00:45:28.527 --> 00:45:32.311
maybe most importantly is
have the right tow vehicle.

00:45:32.311 --> 00:45:33.210
- This is true.

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:35.950
I mean, we're not gonna get
into the tow vehicle argument.

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.940
Hey, if you wanna see some fireworks

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.080
go post about a truck and
say is this enough truck

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:40.940
or the right truck?

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:42.768
You'll get a lot of responses.

00:45:42.768 --> 00:45:43.920
- Oh yeah.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.766
- Good and bad.

00:45:44.766 --> 00:45:45.773
- Yeah.

00:45:45.773 --> 00:45:47.420
- We wanna do what's best
for us and for our safety.

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:48.810
- Right, so this is how we do it.

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:50.040
We wanted to share it all with you

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.153
because we get that question every day.

00:45:51.153 --> 00:45:53.360
- And it was a big question we had.

00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:54.240
We didn't know.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.100
This is our first RV ever.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:58.380
It's definitely our first 44 foot

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.475
ginormous monstrosity of a rig ever.

00:46:00.475 --> 00:46:01.474
- Yeah.

00:46:01.474 --> 00:46:03.760
- And it does take some practice
to get used to pulling it.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.250
There's no substitute for practice.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.550
So we were lucky that we got
our delivery at Lazy Days

00:46:08.550 --> 00:46:09.640
and they had a delivery lot there

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:12.481
and they're like drive around
here and back in, back out,

00:46:12.481 --> 00:46:14.320
pull out, do what you need to do.

00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:16.290
Find a place to do that and
get comfortable maneuvering

00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.821
'cause it's different than a trailer

00:46:17.821 --> 00:46:20.000
and even if you're familiar
with a fifth wheel,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.720
a giant fifth wheel is
a whole nother story.

00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.799
- Yeah.

00:46:22.799 --> 00:46:23.930

motorcycle and take a ride.

00:47:01.010 --> 00:47:02.710
- We're outta here people, see ya.
