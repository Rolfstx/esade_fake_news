and so on it's one of the ways we do
that<00:15:37.620><c> yes</c><00:15:37.970><c> well</c><00:15:38.970><c> I</c><00:15:39.000><c> would</c><00:15:39.240><c> say</c><00:15:39.420><c> that</c><00:15:39.600><c> it's</c><00:15:39.720><c> the</c>

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
that yes well I would say that it's the
 

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.470 align:start position:0%
that yes well I would say that it's the

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:42.480 align:start position:0%

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.910 align:start position:0%
fundamental way so and I mean I think we
could<00:15:42.630><c> have</c><00:15:42.720><c> a</c><00:15:42.780><c> reasonable</c><00:15:42.990><c> discussion</c><00:15:43.560><c> about</c>

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
could have a reasonable discussion about
 

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:46.190 align:start position:0%
could have a reasonable discussion about

00:15:46.190 --> 00:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
that but because freedom of speech is so
