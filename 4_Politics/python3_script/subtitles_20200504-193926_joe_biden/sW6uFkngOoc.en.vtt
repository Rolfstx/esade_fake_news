00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.984
- [Antonnio] You look dumb as hell.

00:00:00.984 --> 00:00:01.817
- [Alfred] Okay.

00:00:01.817 --> 00:00:02.650
- [Antonnio] You look dumb as hell. - Okay

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.483
- And the reason why you
can't find this person

00:00:03.483 --> 00:00:04.992
is because I'm Adonis, bitch.

00:00:04.992 --> 00:00:06.260
(dramatic music)

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.480
- [Antonnio] Yes, I am Adonis.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.381
- [Alfred] Bitch--

00:00:09.381 --> 00:00:10.214
- (female gasping)

00:00:10.214 --> 00:00:11.047
(beep) Oh my word.

00:00:11.047 --> 00:00:13.255
Stop guys, no, no, no, no.

00:00:13.255 --> 00:00:14.539
(garage door opening)

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.360
- [Nev] What's this?

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.297
(dramatic music)

00:00:18.297 --> 00:00:19.290
Um, what?

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.040
(dramatic music)

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:26.117
- Hi.

00:00:26.117 --> 00:00:28.327
- Ew, what the (beep)?

00:00:28.327 --> 00:00:29.590
- Who is this?

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:30.650
- Hi, I'm Joey.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.720
How are you?

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.080
- Oh, your name is Joey?

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.913
- No, I'm Mikey.

00:00:33.913 --> 00:00:35.350
- Oh, your name is Mikey.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.560
- Yeah. -Hi

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.973
- Oh my god.

00:00:37.973 --> 00:00:38.980
(dramatic music)

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:39.813
So sad.

00:00:39.813 --> 00:00:40.646
- [Jane] Hi, Jane.

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:42.210
- Hi, nice to meet you.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.420
- [Nev] Wait, you know each other?

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.580
- We used to be best
friends back in the day.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.540
- So hold on a second.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.060
What's the, what was
the whole point of this?

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.237
- Well, I wanted to

00:00:49.237 --> 00:00:51.260
break his heart like I got mine broken.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.970
- Oh, yeah he had this like notion

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:54.190
out of nowhere that I slept with

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.210
his now ex-boyfriend.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.787
- Out of nowhere even
though I witnessed it

00:00:56.787 --> 00:00:58.880
you know, with my two eyes in person.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.470
- Your boyfriend was
trying to get with me.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.303
You're obsessed with me.

00:01:01.303 --> 00:01:02.320
You need to stop (sigh).

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.360
- First of all, put your hand
down, it's not that serious.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.919
- No, because I don't want
to (beep) look at you.

00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:06.949
- [Mikey] So don't look at me.

00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:07.801
- [Mike] What's under your (beep) makeup?

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.634
- Look the other way.

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:09.592
There's plenty of space in the world.

00:01:09.592 --> 00:01:11.370
- Because this is a reality
show, not a (beep) horror show.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.710
- I can't stand you.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.167
- I can't stand looking at you (laughing).

00:01:14.167 --> 00:01:15.000
Oh my god.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.833
- So don't.

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.220
- Oh my god.
- Jesus.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.220
Like, don't.

00:01:19.076 --> 00:01:20.034
- Oh my god.

00:01:20.034 --> 00:01:21.110
(suspenseful music)

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.540
- Okay, time out.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.660
- Yeah.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.740
- Mikey, you and Mike had been

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.010
pretty good friends and at some point

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.480
in your past, you had a boyfriend

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.810
and you're pretty sure that that boyfriend

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.330
slept or hooked up
- Um, I witnessed it

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.350
but he is going to deny it.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.000
So let him, whatever, that's--
- Did you make out with or--

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.833
- No, I never did.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:41.910
He wanted to get with me.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.900
- It doesn't matter.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.090
- I didn't want any part of it.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.150
He groped me and that was it.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.460
I had no part of it.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.620
Not wanting anything

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.630
to do with it
- [Mikey] Okay.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.718
- [Nev] All right so, so--
- And then what happened

00:01:49.718 --> 00:01:50.551
after that? You left? Or--

00:01:50.551 --> 00:01:51.720
- I didn't, I didn't leave the party.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.776
Of course not, but like--

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:54.609
- But it didn't, did it go any further?

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.404
- It didn't go any further with him, no.

00:01:56.404 --> 00:01:58.390
- But, how long ago was this
that something happened?

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.750
- It was like winter.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.470
- Is that when Joey started, winter?

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.360
When did Joey start?

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.193
- March.

00:02:03.193 --> 00:02:06.070
- So your relationship ended
because of what happened

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.903
at that party?

00:02:06.903 --> 00:02:07.736
- Uh, yeah.

00:02:07.736 --> 00:02:09.410
- And then you found him on Grinder

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.870
and broke his heart as a sort of revenge.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.833
- Yeah.

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:14.150
(dramatic sound)

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.280
- So, who's Joey?

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.450
Whose picture is that?

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.515
- Some random guy.

00:02:17.515 --> 00:02:19.870
- Yeah.
- That I found on Instagram.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.360
I don't even know him.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.660
- Okay.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.493
- I don't know.

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:24.670
I think it's just, it's a sad story.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.380
You went five months talking to me

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.810
and it got you nowhere.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.890
I'm still living my best
life ever in California.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.600
You're still here--
- Are you really though?

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.601
- I am.
- Is living your best life

00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:34.285
living off of sugar daddies?

00:02:34.285 --> 00:02:35.940
- I really don't think it's fair

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.500
for you to be judging him right now.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.610
You just...
- [Mike] Yeah, you kind of--

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.550
- Took five months of his life

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.383
- [Joey] Really? - And
kind of up ended it.

00:02:40.383 --> 00:02:42.920
- He took my relationship and ended it so,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.980
- Even if I did
- Like if you--

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.948
- get with your boyfriend,
it wouldn't matter

00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:47.050
because I would have done it much better

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.520
than you anyway.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.460
I'm going to beat you at
everything you ever do

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.293
for your entire life.

00:02:51.293 --> 00:02:54.910
You will always be
uglier, older, disgusting.

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.682
- Okay, you're like covered
in like Cheeto dust.

00:02:58.682 --> 00:02:59.515
- [Dallas] It better not be him

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:00.690
- Wait, where, how did you, where have you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.523
seen that guy before?

00:03:01.523 --> 00:03:03.240
- Just like living in an alley.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.890
- No, seriously?

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.463
- [Dallas] I swear it better
not be that (beep) guy.

00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:08.400
Don't come over here, dude.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.620
- It look like he's coming over here.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.453
He is walking

00:03:11.453 --> 00:03:14.060
back this direction
- (beep) my life, bro.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.793
I swear, y'all are (beep) kidding, bro.

00:03:16.793 --> 00:03:18.092
(dramatic music)

00:03:18.092 --> 00:03:18.925
- Hello.

00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:19.758
- [Tallulah] Hi.

00:03:19.758 --> 00:03:21.773
- Oh my gosh, bro.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.076
- [Nev] What's your name?

00:03:24.076 --> 00:03:24.909
- William.

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:25.892
- [Nev] William.
- [Tallulah] Hi.

00:03:25.892 --> 00:03:26.725
- Hi, Nev.
- [Dallas] Oh, (beep) bro.

00:03:26.725 --> 00:03:27.558
- This is Tallulah.

00:03:27.558 --> 00:03:28.391
- Hi, I'm Tallulah.

00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:29.224
- Nice to meet you.

00:03:29.224 --> 00:03:30.573
- Nice to meet you.
- [Dallas] Nah, bro.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.353
- So--

00:03:32.353 --> 00:03:34.112
- I (beep) knew it was some bull (beep)

00:03:34.112 --> 00:03:35.890
but this is beyond me bro
- [Nev] But hold on, wait

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:36.723
let's just get an explain--

00:03:36.723 --> 00:03:38.400
so what's going on?

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.190
- I saw him a few times
on like, around town

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.870
slut walk a few times and
some Amber Rose events.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.250
- [Nev] Okay, so do you,
you have some mutual

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.720
social circles
- Yeah, I've seen him

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.170
a few times and I was like, you know,

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.430
I thought he was a really hot guy

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.950
and he's posting all these photos

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.530
of his like ass on Instagram and Tumblr

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.980
and whatever and I was
with my friend, Safari

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.350
and we were on social media drunk

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.217
and she was like, "You
should totally DM him,"

00:04:04.217 --> 00:04:05.840
and I'm like, "Oh my god, I'm so nervous.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.730
I couldn't do such a thing,

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.240
like I don't think he's gay."

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.680
She's like, "Well just
look at how he's posting

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.070
his photos on Instagram.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.500
He's got an only fans page that he uses

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.796
to, you know, target the gay community."

00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:17.629
(dramatic music)

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:19.010
- [Nev] Wait a second, only fans.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.843
What's that?

00:04:19.843 --> 00:04:22.640
- Dallas is always posting his nudes, um

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.060
you can subscribe to his stuff.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.460
- [Nev] And people subscribe
and he'll post special content?

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.660
Do you have subscribers?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.769
- Yeah.

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:32.440
(dramatic music)

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.200
- And Safari said, "Like,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.655
why don't I just give him my number

00:04:35.655 --> 00:04:37.010
- That's stupid bro
- And then it's

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.880
really your number."

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.110
- Who was he texting with?

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.943
- Me.

00:04:39.943 --> 00:04:42.290
- [Nev] But then why
approach him as a woman?

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:45.450
- I feel like girls can
make a guy feel comfortable

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.190
like, let's say a threesome or foursome

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.550
you know, I could have
been that fourth person

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.700
in his threesome.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.363
- That's (beep) weird, bro.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:55.043
I'm sorry.

00:04:55.043 --> 00:04:57.660
- So, you asked about a threesome.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.880
He even said he would be down.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.840
Then you suggested the roommate, not you.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.310
- But he was okay with that.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.580
- Why not suggest yourself

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.170
and then say, "Okay
Safari, let's go meet him."

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:08.990
Like why not see if it
actually could happen?

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:10.080
- We were going to do that

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.750
and then "Catfish" came out of nowhere.

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.540
- Okay, so the plan was--

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.860
- [William] To eventually get to that

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:15.724
Because these guys are so...

00:05:15.724 --> 00:05:17.983
- (exasperated laugh) this is

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:19.660
beyond me, bro.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.820
- Most of his fans are gay.

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.870
- But that ain't got
nothing to do with my,

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:24.703
what I like.

00:05:24.703 --> 00:05:26.870
- It kind of feels like
you're trying to blame him

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.290
for the fact that you lied

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.800
and pretended to be something
- No, and it's not lying

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.140
I'm not pretending to be someone--

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.140
- You've been pretending to
be Safari for two months.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.780
- You a Catfish Catfish, bro.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:35.613
- [Williams] No... -This is some...

00:05:35.613 --> 00:05:36.446
- [Nev] Wait a second,

00:05:36.446 --> 00:05:37.332
- [William] No no no no no no no

00:05:37.332 --> 00:05:38.165
- [Nev] but surely... wait, but surely you

00:05:38.165 --> 00:05:38.998
(exasperated sigh)

00:05:38.998 --> 00:05:40.950
understand that it still feels like you...

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.140
don't think you did anything wrong.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.060
- I didn't do anything maliciously,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.820
I wasn't asking for money.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.080
- That's true.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.410
- So, if I wasn't doing
done of those things,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.450
I don't feel like in a sense of

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.700
I was doing any harm.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.950
We didn't mean for
someone to call "Catfish".

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.652
- Just ask me and be
like, "Bro, are you gay?

00:05:57.652 --> 00:05:58.580
Do you get down?"

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.443
And I would have been like, "No,"

00:05:59.443 --> 00:06:00.276
and it would have ended right there.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:01.109
(dramatic music)

00:06:01.109 --> 00:06:02.659
- [Nev] 'Kay, here goes nothin'

00:06:05.414 --> 00:06:08.997
(dramatic music continues)

00:06:14.521 --> 00:06:18.505
(knocking on door) (garage door opening)

00:06:18.505 --> 00:06:20.234
- [Justin] Nev, Nev!

00:06:20.234 --> 00:06:21.401
- [Nev] Uh-oh.

00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:25.231
- [Cherie] Oh, get me
the (beep) out of here.

00:06:25.231 --> 00:06:26.242
No.

00:06:26.242 --> 00:06:27.797
(dramatic music)

00:06:27.797 --> 00:06:29.610
No, that, nah, absolutely dead

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.090
Like I got to be Boo-Boo the fool.

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:32.630
Like, no.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.970
- You really fell for this?
- [Cherie] No.

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.803
- [Nev] Who is this?

00:06:34.803 --> 00:06:36.439
- No, an old friend of mine

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:37.272
- [Man in Garage] You forgot me right?

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.270
who doesn't know his place.

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:39.103
- You forgot me?

00:06:39.103 --> 00:06:39.936
- [Cherie] We ready to go?

00:06:39.936 --> 00:06:40.769
- [Nev] What's going on?

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:41.620
Who is this guy?

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.230
- Somebody I was literally
just old friends with.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:45.063
- [Nev] What happened?

00:06:45.063 --> 00:06:45.896
- [Cherie] Yeah.

00:06:45.896 --> 00:06:47.640
- She asked to borrow some money from me

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:49.190
and I haven't heard from her since.

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.530
- That is so childish.

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:51.600
- All right, so hold on a second.

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:52.700
What's your name?

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.600
- My name's Buddy.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.291
- [Nev] And you guys go back as friends.

00:06:56.291 --> 00:06:57.124
- [Buddy] Right

00:06:57.124 --> 00:06:57.957
- [Cherie] Only a little bit.

00:06:57.957 --> 00:06:58.790
About three or four years,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:59.623
but we're honestly not that close.

00:06:59.623 --> 00:07:00.610
- About five years, since 2012.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:02.680
- Okay, so you guys were friends.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.590
- Uh-huh, we used to hang out

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:05.423
and talk (beep) together
- And close enough

00:07:05.423 --> 00:07:07.910
that you lent her some
money here and there.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.390
- [Nev] About how much do
you think you lent her?

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.870
- A couple hundred dollars.

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.570
- First of all, I didn't
ask you for anything.

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.100
This man blew up my phone one day

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.170
and I didn't answer so
he went into my account

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.380
and paid my bill and
then told me I need to

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.160
pay him back because he
thought that my phone was off.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:23.387
Now I'm borrowing money from you?

00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:24.480
- You definitely asked, you needed help

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.907
- You didn't specifically say,

00:07:25.907 --> 00:07:27.290
"Can I borrow money?" He just--

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.110
- I didn't ask him to pay my bill.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.260
- It said it was off.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.790
- So wait, so what, what did you want?

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.200
- I wanted my money back.

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.700
That's all this was for.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.525
That's what started Avion.

00:07:36.525 --> 00:07:37.800
(dramatic music)

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.677
There was several days where she said,

00:07:39.677 --> 00:07:40.947
"I'll bring your money this day."

00:07:40.947 --> 00:07:41.987
"Oh, my check's funny."

00:07:41.987 --> 00:07:43.357
"I'll bring you money this day."

00:07:43.357 --> 00:07:44.577
"My commission check's short."

00:07:44.577 --> 00:07:45.870
"I'll bring you money this day,"

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:47.190
and it's been months

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.038
and I haven't heard a word from you

00:07:49.038 --> 00:07:50.082
- Because I'm not
- [Buddy] Because at

00:07:50.082 --> 00:07:50.915
- friends with you
- [Buddy] this point

00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:52.210
- anymore.
- [Buddy] you're saying it's

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.043
- Do you really think
- [Buddy] about being friends

00:07:53.043 --> 00:07:53.876
- that the money had something
- [Buddy] It's not about--

00:07:53.876 --> 00:07:54.709
- to do with it?
- [Buddy] It has everything

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:55.542
- You're a (beep) friend

00:07:55.542 --> 00:07:56.375
- [Buddy] to do with it
on my side when you said

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:57.208
- [Cherie] Like you're all
pressed for our friendship

00:07:57.208 --> 00:07:58.041
- on your word
- I don't care

00:07:58.041 --> 00:07:59.499
- [Buddy] When you say,
"I have $50 for you

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:00.332
- [Cherie] I don't care.

00:08:00.332 --> 00:08:01.349
- [Buddy] On Friday because I owe you

00:08:01.349 --> 00:08:02.182
- [Cherie] My word is is
that I don't (beep) with you

00:08:02.182 --> 00:08:03.015
- [Buddy] And then I don't hear from you

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:03.848
hear from you and you spent the money.

00:08:03.848 --> 00:08:04.681
You spent the lift money to go see

00:08:04.681 --> 00:08:07.640
this fake person, but you
couldn't put the money

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.070
in your friend's hand.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:10.130
- You know what I owe you?

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.980
A goodbye and a have a
nice mother (beep) day.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.896
(dramatic music)

00:08:13.896 --> 00:08:14.729
- Loyda.

00:08:14.729 --> 00:08:15.780
- Loyda, I'm Nev.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.613
- Juan.

00:08:16.613 --> 00:08:18.970
- Thank you for, uh, having us over.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.950
- Oh, you're welcome.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:21.760
- Your daughter's been
having a relationship

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.560
with Ramon for quite some time now.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.100
He wanted to come over here
and ask you guys some questions

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.820
just so we could try
to walk away from this

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.623
at least knowing sort
of, the whole picture.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.880
As far as you knew, your daughter was

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.590
in a relationship with Ramon.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:39.423
- Yes.

00:08:39.423 --> 00:08:41.840
- [Nev] Did you know that she was

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.973
pretending to be somebody else?

00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.348
- Yes.

00:08:46.348 --> 00:08:48.760
(dramatic music)

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.993
I was aware of the whole thing.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:53.570
- This is my sister and
I love her to death,

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:56.140
but Im'ma say it regardless,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.163
Loyda flat out lied to Ramon.

00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:01.960
- [Nev] This guy was sending gifts,

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.710
very generous gifts--

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:04.990
- [Mother] He wanted to
- [Juan] I just want to--

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.823
- [Nev] To a girl who he thought

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:07.037
- [Max] Sure, he wanted to

00:09:07.037 --> 00:09:07.870
- [Nev] Right...

00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:09.770
Didn't it bother you that there was a guy

00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:13.550
who was sending your
daughter lots of things

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:16.513
and he thought he was
sending it to somebody else?

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:20.260
- No, no, no, cut it right there.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.040
When he start sending
her expensive gift like,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:26.577
for example, the Wii,
Loyda mentioned to me,

00:09:26.577 --> 00:09:29.630
"Mommy, I think this is going too far."

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.820
She decide to tell him the truth

00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.830
and he stop her and told her, "I don't

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.238
want to hear it."

00:09:36.238 --> 00:09:38.370
(dramatic music)

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.430
- I didn't want to get
that face out of my head

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:42.169
and uh, everything, that name.

00:09:42.169 --> 00:09:44.850
(dramatic music)

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.340
Well, they looked at
your page, your real page

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:51.690
and found a picture of
a ring and a message

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.663
that looked like it was from me.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.663
- He sent her that ring.

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.393
- I never sent her a ring, at all.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.610
- When Loyda open the envelope,

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.090
it had your name on it.

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.360
You did send that to her, Ramon.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.460
- I never sent her a ring.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:12.170
- If he's saying he didn't send
it, sorry to tell you Ramon,

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:15.170
somebody pretend to be
him and he doesn't know.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.040
- Loyda, you want to explain
that to your mom for us?

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.600
- What?

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.360
- How that all happened.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.424
- What happened?

00:10:22.424 --> 00:10:23.279
- The ring.

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.112
- The ring?

00:10:24.112 --> 00:10:24.950
- Ramon gave you money.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.470
- It was birthday money.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.080
- You went online, you
bought yourself a ring,

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.790
you mailed it to yourself and
then in front of your mother,

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:35.820
you lied to her and told
her he had sent it to you.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:36.653
Am I wrong?

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:41.520
- Are you surprised though
that she sent the ring?

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.353
- Whatever.

00:10:42.353 --> 00:10:43.860
- No, not whatever.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.630
It's important, these
details are important.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:48.090
- No, whatever.
- You're not really hearing

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:49.050
everything.
- [Mother] Yes I am.

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.110
- No you're not.
- [Mother] Yes I am.

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:51.501
- [Max] Your daughter's a liar.

00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:52.450
- My daughter's a liar?

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:53.700
What about Ramon?

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.920
- Ramon has his own issues to deal with

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.850
- I can see that.
- [Nev] okay.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:10:59.460
And part of what I hope we can do today

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.880
is everybody admits their issues.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.010
I encourage you to take this opportunity

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.150
to take responsibility
for what you've done.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.900
Same to you, okay?

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:14.160
I'm just here to try and
encourage both of you

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.878
to be honest with yourselves.

00:11:15.878 --> 00:11:18.525
(dramatic music)

00:11:18.525 --> 00:11:20.220
- Why don't we, why
don't we come over here?

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.067
- That's Alexis? (sigh)

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:26.090
- So, Nicole... -mm hmm?

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:31.260
- this is Jesus, and you are the person

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.960
he's been talking to... Is that right?

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.040
- Mm hmm

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:34.873
- Okay...

00:11:34.873 --> 00:11:37.580
(dramatic music)

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:38.620
- So what's been going on here

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.650
because we got a whole story from Amanda.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:41.640
Clearly, you're not the

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.890
girl in the pictures right?
- No, Amanda made the profile

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:44.800
okay...
- Wait, Amanda made

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.020
the profile?
- Amanda made the profile

00:11:46.020 --> 00:11:48.074
years ago, she was doing this

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:49.460
and that, she used to be my best friend.

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.849
She's not anymore.

00:11:50.849 --> 00:11:52.510
- Hold on, so you're
saying that when Jesus

00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:54.320
started talking to Alexis, he was actually

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.575
talking to Amanda?

00:11:55.575 --> 00:11:57.050
- He was talking to her
and then I took over.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.430
- [Nev] How long have
you been the profile?

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.200
- Probably talking to
him a little over a year.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.410
- [Nev] So pretty much the whole time.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:04.293
- Yeah, yeah.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.930
- [Nev] And it was you
in the video chat, right?

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.010
- It was me.

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:11.162
- [Nev] Okay, so you are the Catfish.

00:12:11.162 --> 00:12:12.350
(dramatic music)

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.433
Who's the girl in the Alexis profile?

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.000
- That's my cousin,
those are her pictures.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.290
- Oh, you used pictures of your cousin.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.343
- Yes, that's quote unquote, Alexis.

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.280
- And she knew you were using her pictures

00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.340
or not?
- No, Amanda didn't tell

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.173
her nothing.

00:12:29.173 --> 00:12:30.210
Amanda befriended her like a friend,

00:12:30.210 --> 00:12:31.740
you know, "Hey, let's do this together."

00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.540
I said okay, you know I agreed to it.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.900
- [Nev] And what about this Nicole person?

00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:37.330
- [Nicole] That was my daughter, Nicky.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.010
- [Nev] You used pictures
of your daughter?

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:39.843
- Yeah.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.346
- Does your daughter know that
you're using her pictures?

00:12:44.346 --> 00:12:45.390
- No...

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.040
- [Nev] What about your
other daughter, Alissa

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:48.670
that you told Jesus about?

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.763
- Yeah, who's Alissa?

00:12:50.952 --> 00:12:52.553
- Alis... That's Amanda's daughter.

00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:54.900
- You said it was your daughter.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.830
- Yeah, but don't yell at me.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.812
That's Amanda's daughter.

00:12:58.812 --> 00:12:59.645
(dramatic music)

00:12:59.645 --> 00:13:00.478
- Oh right, Amanda.

00:13:00.478 --> 00:13:01.350
Said you guys got into a big fight

00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.910
because you sent pictures of her kids

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:03.920
to some guy in prison.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.664
- First of all, she's the one

00:13:05.664 --> 00:13:06.497
that gave me the pictures to send to him.

00:13:06.497 --> 00:13:08.120
Second of all, Amanda was--
- [Nev] So you did send

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.258
pictures of her daughter to
- [Nicole] To nobody

00:13:09.258 --> 00:13:10.960
- [Nev] somebody in prison
- [Nicole] in prison.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.673
She was in this the whole time.

00:13:12.673 --> 00:13:14.573
I don't know what she's talking about.

00:13:15.930 --> 00:13:18.353
- The bottom line is, Alexis is not real.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.210
You're talking for a year
plus to this young man

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.460
and the idea was to make a
fake profile to talk to guys

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:29.910
to see if you could get
them to give you money?

00:13:29.910 --> 00:13:30.743
- Yeah.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.000
Amanda's being a total bitch
and I hate her right now.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.210
- Enough about Amanda.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.580
You're the one here
who is telling that you

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:40.030
have been scamming lots of guys

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:41.510
pretending to be Alexis, then like

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:42.841
you're the Catfish.

00:13:42.841 --> 00:13:43.674
- I'm not innocent, I'm far from innocent,

00:13:43.674 --> 00:13:45.640
but don't make me look like
I'm a (beep) bad person.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.690
On (beep) national TV.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:49.230
Cause I can easily just get
up and walk away real quick

00:13:49.230 --> 00:13:50.080
and I won't care.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:53.400
- So you don't care about him at all?

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.100
- I care for him as a friend.

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.120
- You guys were saying, "I love you."

00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.010
- As a friend, you can't
tell a friend you love them?

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:00.760
- Oh, right, but you knew that he was more

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:02.430
in love than just like a friend.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:05.653
- Yeah, but it was just
like I wanted a friendship.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.910
- You have to care about him if you,

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:10.750
a year is a long time to talk to anybody--

00:14:10.750 --> 00:14:11.583
- Really?

00:14:11.583 --> 00:14:13.340
I have to when nobody
gives a (beep) about you,

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:15.120
you don't got to care about nobody.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.350
You don't know my life story.

00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.500
You don't know what I've been through.

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:19.240
I've been through a lot of (beep).

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.170
I've been in the foster care,

00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.003
I've been adopted
- [Jesus] I have too.

00:14:21.003 --> 00:14:23.440
- I've been in and out of
jail since I was 11 years old.

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.093
Okay, I've gone through a
lot of (beep), okay Jesus?

00:14:25.093 --> 00:14:26.340
I've been through a lot
- I have too.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.578
- I've had my ass dragged
from one end to the other

00:14:28.578 --> 00:14:29.870
okay, if you don't want to talk to me

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:30.920
at the end of the (beep) day,

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:32.150
oh well, so be it.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.200
I'm still gonna be me.

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:34.310
I'm still gonna move on.

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:35.690
I'm gonna do me and my kids

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.850
and that's the bottom (beep) line to it.

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:39.580
And if you believe Amanda,
then you're (beep) dumber

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:40.413
than I thought.-

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:41.620
- [Female Host] Oh my god.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.640
- But you lied.

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:44.640
- [Female Host] I honestly don't believe

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.252
anything that you're saying.

00:14:46.252 --> 00:14:48.891
(dramatic music)

00:14:48.891 --> 00:14:50.200
- I mean, what you did is not okay.

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:52.530
Take some (beep)
responsibility for yourself.

00:14:52.530 --> 00:14:55.210
You realize what you're
doing is really (beep) up.

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:56.680
- I'm done, I'm done with this situation.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.630
I'm done, I'm gonna walk away

00:14:57.630 --> 00:14:59.410
because I'm about to cuss
your ass out real quick.

00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.010
So I'm done with this, I
don't want to talk about it.

00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.470
Thank you.

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:03.750
Okay, I'm already done.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:07.047
- Just let her be, just let her be guys.

00:15:07.965 --> 00:15:08.798
- How you doing?

00:15:08.798 --> 00:15:09.820
- I'm doing all right.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:11.049
- [Nev] Good to see you

00:15:11.049 --> 00:15:12.130
- [Woman That Walked Up]
Kind of, feeling nervous.

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:13.143
Good to see you too.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.260
- So we're just waiting
trying to figure out

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:19.960
what the heck's going on here.

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:22.160
It's not you is it?

00:15:25.504 --> 00:15:26.810
- No... [Cami] So you're not Jordan?

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:27.643
- No, I'm not Jordan.
- [Cami] You're not

00:15:27.643 --> 00:15:29.128
Jordan?

00:15:29.128 --> 00:15:31.878
(dramatic music)

00:15:34.162 --> 00:15:36.320
- Well, it's two thirty.

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:37.750
- You ain't heard from him?

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.270
- No.

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:41.253
- You want to know why
you ain't heard from him?

00:15:44.841 --> 00:15:45.680
Because I'm Jordan.

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:46.710
(dramatic sound)

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:47.750
Stupid bitch.

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:48.583
- [Nev] What?

00:15:48.583 --> 00:15:49.416
- [Cece] Yeah.

00:15:50.410 --> 00:15:51.655
- [Angel] Are you serious?
- [Cece] Yeah.

00:15:51.655 --> 00:15:53.233
- [Nev] I don't understand.

00:15:53.233 --> 00:15:55.380
So you made the profile.

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.680
It's been you the whole time.

00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.513
- Yep

00:15:57.513 --> 00:15:59.342
- Why would you do this for this long?

00:15:59.342 --> 00:16:02.270
- It don't matter how
long I been doing it.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.567
You had it coming.

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:07.899
- What did she have coming?

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:09.870
- This girl been stealing
dudes from me for years.

00:16:09.870 --> 00:16:12.500
How does it feel because
it don't feel good, right?

00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:14.003
It don't feel good.

00:16:14.003 --> 00:16:15.830
- [Angel] What is, what is this?

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:18.420
- So, you created the profile
- [Cece] Yes I did.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.090
- To match with her because
you knew she was on Tinder.

00:16:21.090 --> 00:16:22.910
- I was eventually gonna tell her,

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.030
but she wanted to meet Jordan

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.863
so here I am.

00:16:24.863 --> 00:16:26.970
- [Nev] Who's, what are
these guys that you stole?

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:27.930
Is that true or--

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:30.007
- I don't know what she's talking about.

00:16:30.007 --> 00:16:30.840
- You don't?

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:31.673
Use your brain.

00:16:31.673 --> 00:16:32.506
You don't know?

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:36.370
You stole three dudes from me, Angel.

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:38.300
- I didn't steal anybody from you.

00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:40.740
- Roy, Troy and Chris.

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:41.573
- What?

00:16:41.573 --> 00:16:44.800
- I guess this would have
been like, years ago?

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.150
- Yes.

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.840
- There were some guys that
you started talking to,

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.800
relationships or these
were guys that you would--

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.790
- I wasn't in a relationship,

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.510
but we were talking and
then they start talking.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.462
These are the people that could
have been potential for me.

00:16:55.462 --> 00:16:58.940
Oh, oh, I'm drunk, I'm drunk,
I was sitting on his lap.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:01.090
That's (beep) you don't do.

00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:03.400
Once she was at a party.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.510
She magically appeared on his lap.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:07.050
It didn't feel good.

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:09.660
- I don't think it's
that unusual for someone

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:13.250
who's 18, 19 to sit on a guy's lap,

00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:14.543
like that stuff is... you're young

00:17:14.543 --> 00:17:16.610
- Well let's put it like this,
that's (beep) you don't do.

00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:17.530
- And that's not cool

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.680
and you're right
- That's (beep) I don't do.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:22.080
- But now the (beep)
you have done is like,

00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.510
pretend to be your best
friend's boyfriend--

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.360
- I can be dumb, she can be dumb too.

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.510
- Okay, first of all,
they tried to talk to me

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:30.936
- Okay, just like you said

00:17:30.936 --> 00:17:31.769
- [Angel] It's not like I tried to...

00:17:31.769 --> 00:17:34.035
- It's the girl code. You
don't do (beep) like that.

00:17:34.035 --> 00:17:35.662
- Can you just stop acting stupid?

00:17:35.662 --> 00:17:37.033
- How am I being stupid?

00:17:37.033 --> 00:17:39.353
- [Angel] Bitch you
better, oh my god (beep)

00:17:39.353 --> 00:17:40.186
- I swear,
- [Nev] Hold on, hold on

00:17:40.186 --> 00:17:41.080
- [Angel] I'm gonna
knock you the (beep) out

00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:41.913
- [Cece] Do it, do it!

00:17:41.913 --> 00:17:42.746
- if you don't get out of my face.

00:17:42.746 --> 00:17:43.579
- [Cece] Your not gonna do nothing,

00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:44.412
you a dumb ass (beep) for talking to

00:17:44.412 --> 00:17:45.245
- [Nev] All right, all right

00:17:45.245 --> 00:17:46.404
- some stupid ass dude on the internet

00:17:46.404 --> 00:17:47.237
- [Nev] Why don't we just--

00:17:47.237 --> 00:17:48.070
- [Angel] I'm gonna lay you out.

00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.903
- You gonna lay me out?

00:17:48.903 --> 00:17:49.736
I want you to go right ahead.

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:50.833
- All right all right.
- No one's laying anyone out.

00:17:50.833 --> 00:17:51.666
- I want you to

00:17:51.666 --> 00:17:52.879
do it right now.
- Stop you guys.

00:17:52.879 --> 00:17:53.712
- Laura, why don't you go over there

00:17:53.712 --> 00:17:54.758
with Angel
- I'm ready to go.

00:17:54.758 --> 00:17:55.767
- [Angel] This is stupid.
- I'm done talking to her.

00:17:55.767 --> 00:17:57.760
Who gonna take me home, Nev?

00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:58.950
- [Nev] We can, we can...
someone can take you home.

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:00.420
- [Cece] I'm ready to go.

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.970
I'm done with this (beep), man.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.379
- [Male] Hey Alfred.

00:18:04.379 --> 00:18:05.212
(dramatic music)

00:18:05.212 --> 00:18:06.045
- [Alfred] (beep) what the (beep)?

00:18:06.045 --> 00:18:06.878
- [Nev] Who is this?

00:18:06.878 --> 00:18:07.711
- It's Antonnio.

00:18:07.711 --> 00:18:08.544
- [Alfred] What are you doing here?

00:18:08.544 --> 00:18:09.630
- [Antonnio] I heard
"Catfish" was in town.

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:10.463
- [Alfred] What that got to do with you?

00:18:10.463 --> 00:18:11.296
- Why are they here?

00:18:11.296 --> 00:18:12.420
- Get in your car, go home.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.260
- So you really going to leave?

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:14.281
- Get in your car and go home.

00:18:14.281 --> 00:18:15.114
- Can I talk to you over there?

00:18:15.114 --> 00:18:15.947
- Why?

00:18:15.947 --> 00:18:16.780
- For five minute?

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.613
- For what?

00:18:17.613 --> 00:18:18.446
- So I can talk to you.

00:18:18.446 --> 00:18:19.279
I don't need everybody
else in my business.

00:18:19.279 --> 00:18:20.112
I don't need that.

00:18:20.112 --> 00:18:20.945
- [Cami] Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:18:20.945 --> 00:18:21.778
- [Antonnio] No, why are they here?

00:18:21.778 --> 00:18:23.170
- [Nev] It's all right, why
don't you go back inside

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.260
and I'll explain to Antonnio
what we're doing here.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.306
- You're Antonnio.

00:18:27.306 --> 00:18:28.389
- Yeah.

00:18:28.389 --> 00:18:29.293
- I'm Cami, nice to meet you.

00:18:29.293 --> 00:18:30.404
- [Alfred] This is what
I was telling y'all.

00:18:30.404 --> 00:18:31.237
It's like, you see what I'm saying?

00:18:31.237 --> 00:18:32.240
- [Nev] I understand.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.970
He's probably just jealous and upset.

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.180
- He's always (beep) jealous.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.970
That's what I'm talking about.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:41.760
- It is Alfred's business...

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.753
But...

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.033
we're just...

00:18:46.033 --> 00:18:47.080
we're here to help.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.190
- This is a perfect
opportunity to just say

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.088
you know what,
- I told y'all

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:51.050
- I don't need that.
- I told y'all.

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.420
- Yeah but, you don't need that anymore.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.703
- I told y'all.

00:18:53.703 --> 00:18:54.840
- It's not your responsibility.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.350
So why don't you go out there

00:18:56.350 --> 00:18:57.850
and let him know how you feel?

00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:03.050
- What do you have to say?

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:04.400
- Why are you bringing "Catfish" out here?

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.410
Am I not good enough for you?

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.480
Like, why you trying to meet somebody

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.660
that you don't even know?

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:10.570
- Look at this bull (beep)
that you pulling right now.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:13.522
You hear something from
Sanfra and you coming at me.

00:19:13.522 --> 00:19:15.007
- It's been five years.

00:19:15.007 --> 00:19:16.225
Five years is a long ass time for you to

00:19:16.225 --> 00:19:17.783
throw it away on somebody
you don't even know?

00:19:17.783 --> 00:19:18.987
- And it's all been you
it's been about you.

00:19:18.987 --> 00:19:20.238
- [Antonnio] But you don't
even know this person.

00:19:20.238 --> 00:19:21.071
- It doesn't matter.

00:19:21.071 --> 00:19:22.173
- It'd be different if
you knew this person,

00:19:22.173 --> 00:19:23.006
but you don't even know this person.

00:19:23.006 --> 00:19:24.060
- [Alfred] So that's my point
- So you're going to leave me

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:25.440
over somebody that you don't even know.

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.863
- You damn right I would.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.844
- That's stupid as hell.

00:19:29.844 --> 00:19:30.677
- and, what you going to do about it

00:19:30.677 --> 00:19:31.540
- That's crazy as (beep)

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.387
- You look dumb as hell.

00:19:32.387 --> 00:19:33.220
- [Alfred] And that's fine

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.370
- [Antonnio] You look dumb as hell.

00:19:34.370 --> 00:19:35.233
- [Alfred] Okay.

00:19:35.233 --> 00:19:36.066
- [Antonnio] You look dumb as hell.

00:19:36.066 --> 00:19:36.899
- [Alfred] Okay.

00:19:36.899 --> 00:19:37.732
- And the reason why you
can't find this person

00:19:37.732 --> 00:19:38.565
is because I'm Adonis, bitch.

00:19:38.565 --> 00:19:39.640
(dramatic music)

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.713
Yes, I am Adonis.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.713
- Bitch!

00:19:42.713 --> 00:19:43.546
(shriek)

00:19:43.546 --> 00:19:44.574
- [Cami] Oh my god.

00:19:44.574 --> 00:19:46.576
Stop guys, no, no, no, no, no.

00:19:46.576 --> 00:19:47.784
(dramatic music)

00:19:47.784 --> 00:19:50.920
(muffled speaking)

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:52.941
- Nev, please let me get up

00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:55.182
Nev let me get up,

00:19:55.182 --> 00:19:56.190
- [Cami] It's not worth it.

00:19:56.190 --> 00:19:57.047
- He better be lying, y'all.

00:19:57.047 --> 00:19:57.880
- [Cami] It's not worth it.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.713
- He better be lying.

00:19:58.713 --> 00:19:59.720
He better be lying.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.843
- [Nev] Hold on, hold
on, hold on one second.

00:20:01.843 --> 00:20:03.473
- He better be lying bro.

00:20:03.473 --> 00:20:04.321
(sad music)

00:20:04.321 --> 00:20:06.063
(sobbing)

00:20:06.063 --> 00:20:07.618
- Sit with me.
- I'm tired of him.

00:20:07.618 --> 00:20:09.628
- Take a seat, sit with me.
- I'm tired, Nev.

00:20:09.628 --> 00:20:10.938
Nev, I'm tired.

00:20:10.938 --> 00:20:14.191
- Let's take a second, all right.

00:20:14.191 --> 00:20:16.574
- (gasp) He better be lying, Nev.

00:20:16.574 --> 00:20:17.970
- We're not going to
get anywhere right now.

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:19.260
Everyone's upset.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.260
- Are you okay?

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:21.093
- Yeah, I'm okay.

00:20:21.093 --> 00:20:22.480
That (beep) is crazy.

00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.880
He's mad at me because
he's been cheatin' on me.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.713
This is just too much.

00:20:25.713 --> 00:20:27.120
I can't talk, I'm bout to go.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.273
I can't do this.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.739
- Please get home safely.

00:20:30.739 --> 00:20:31.572
- I am.

00:20:31.572 --> 00:20:34.570
(car door shuts)

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.289
- I just want to know, is he lying?

00:20:36.289 --> 00:20:38.140
- Do you want me to go ask him that?

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:38.973
- Please,

00:20:38.973 --> 00:20:39.806
- Can you just stay here for a minute?

00:20:39.806 --> 00:20:40.870
- Find out if he's lying, please.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:42.300
- All right, just wait for me one second,

00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:43.150
right here, okay?

00:20:44.252 --> 00:20:47.252
(suspenseful music)

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.730
- [Cami] He says he needs to leave.

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:52.730
- Did you talk to him at all?

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:55.590
- Yeah, I did, but he doesn't wanna...

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:57.490
- Hey, just really fast, is it true,

00:20:57.490 --> 00:20:59.250
you said at the very end,
right before you guys

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.800
started fighting that you are Adonis.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.650
- I am Adonis.

00:21:01.650 --> 00:21:02.510
- That's true?

00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.343
- That's true.

00:21:03.343 --> 00:21:04.197
- So you made the profile?

00:21:04.197 --> 00:21:05.030
- Yes.

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.033
- And it's been you talking
to him the whole time?

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:09.310
Why did you do that?

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:10.343
- I needed facts.

00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.550
- In terms of him like, cheating?

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.067
- So cheating on me, so
talking to other people

00:21:14.067 --> 00:21:15.953
behind my back, I needed facts.
