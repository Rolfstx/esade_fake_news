00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:03.671
Hi. I'm Gill at www.engvid.com,

00:00:03.696 --> 00:00:09.656
and today's lesson is
about accents in the U.K.

00:00:09.681 --> 00:00:14.096
So, U.K. accents
and also dialects.

00:00:14.121 --> 00:00:19.027
Okay, so what's the difference
between an accent and a dialect?

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.908
Right. Well, an accent, as you know, is to
do with pronunciation, how you pronounce the

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:36.070
word. Dialect is when you have a word that
only people in a certain area of the country

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:44.110
use; it's not a national word, it's a local
word that maybe people from other parts of

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:52.079
the country, they won't even know what it
means, so that's dialect. Okay. So, let's

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.608
just have a look through some of the
accents that we have in the U.K.

00:00:59.442 --> 00:01:09.850
The one that you're probably learning as you're
learning to pronounce English words is RP.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.920
"RP" stands for "Received Pronunciation". It's
a slightly strange term. "Received" where

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.035
do you receive it from? Well, maybe
you receive it from your teacher.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.537
This is how to say this word.

00:01:26.678 --> 00:01:34.759
It's a slightly strange expression, but RP,
it's usually referred to by the initials.

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.819
And it's the kind of accent you will hear
if you're watching BBC Television programs

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:53.293
or listening to BBC Radio. Not everybody
on the BBC speaks with an RP accent.

00:01:53.754 --> 00:01:59.730
The news readers tend to be
RP speakers, but not always.

00:02:01.537 --> 00:02:05.639
But the strange thing is
that in this country,

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:11.351
only a very small percentage of
people do speak with this accent.

00:02:14.179 --> 00:02:16.994
Apparently, just 3%,

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:25.900
but they tend to be people in positions of
power, authority, responsibility. They probably

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.497
earn a lot of money. They live in big houses. You
know the idea. So, people like the Prime Minster,

00:02:33.522 --> 00:02:41.004
at the moment David Cameron, he went to a
private school, he went to university,

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:48.397
Oxford, so people who have been to Oxford
and Cambridge Universities often speak in

00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:56.640
RP, even if they didn't speak in RP before
they went to Oxford or Cambridge, they often

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.780
change their accent while they are there because
of the big influence of their surroundings

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:16.459
and the people that they're meeting. So that's
RP. It's a very clear accent. So, it's probably

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.370
a good idea to either learn to speak English
with an RP accent, or you may be learning

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.634
with an American accent, a Canadian accent,
all of those accents are very clear. Okay.

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.519
And being clear is the
most important thing.

00:03:34.706 --> 00:03:45.730
Okay, so moving on. RP, as I should have said,
is mostly in the south of the country; London

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:57.288
and the south. So, also "Cockney" and "Estuary
English" are in the south. Okay. So, Cockney

00:03:57.313 --> 00:04:07.586
is the local London accent, and it tends to
spread further out to places like Kent, Essex,

00:04:07.611 --> 00:04:17.320
other places like that. Surrey. There's a newer
version of Cockney called "Estuary English".

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:25.600
If you think an estuary is connected to a
river, so the River Thames which flows across

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:34.710
the country, goes quite a long way west. So
anyone living along the estuary, near the

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.090
river can possibly have
this accent as well.

00:04:40.115 --> 00:04:48.780
So, just to give you some examples, then,
of the Cockney accent, there are different

00:04:48.805 --> 00:05:01.130
features. So, one example is the "th" sound,
as you know to make a "th" sound, some of

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:08.370
you may find it difficult anyway, "the", when
you put your tongue through your teeth, "the",

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:19.013
but a Cockney person may not use the "the",
they will use an "f" sound or a "v" sound

00:05:19.038 --> 00:05:29.606
instead, so the word "think", "I think", they
would say would say instead of: "think",

00:05:32.417 --> 00:05:39.315
they would say it like that: "fink", "fink", and
the top teeth are on the bottom lip, "think".

00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:45.994
And words like "with" that end
with the "th", instead of "with",

00:05:49.044 --> 00:05:52.810
it will be "wiv", "wiv",

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:03.510
"wiv". "Are you coming wiv me?" So that is one of
the things that happens with the Cockney accent.

00:06:03.677 --> 00:06:08.765
Words like "together"
would be "togever". Okay?

00:06:09.552 --> 00:06:15.620
The number "three", t-h-r-e-e
is often pronounced

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.459
"free":

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:24.840
"We have free people coming to dinner. Free
people." So, there can be confusion there,

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.978
because we have the word "free",

00:06:30.705 --> 00:06:37.990
which has a meaning in itself,
"free", but if you actually

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:46.516
mean "three", the number three, there can
be some confusion. So don't get confused by

00:06:46.541 --> 00:06:52.368
"free people". -"Oh, they're free? They're
free to come?" -"No, there are three of them.

00:06:52.532 --> 00:06:58.918
Three people who are
free to come." Ah, okay.

00:06:59.227 --> 00:07:09.440
Another example, another aspect of Cockney
is the glottal stop. Words like "computer"

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:16.514
with a "t" in it, the "t" is not pronounced.
So, some... A lot of Cockney speakers will

00:07:16.539 --> 00:07:23.226
say: "Compuer, compuer", I don't need to write
it, because you can hear I'm missing out the

00:07:23.251 --> 00:07:33.192
"t" and doing a glottal in my throat instead:
"compuer", "computer", "compuer". Okay? And

00:07:33.217 --> 00:07:38.251
the word "matter": "Does
it matter how I speak?",

00:07:38.276 --> 00:07:42.488
"Does it maer? Does
it maer how I speak?"

00:07:42.513 --> 00:07:52.040
So, that's for you to decide: Does it matter
or maer how you speak, how you pronounce?

00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:55.189
There's another
thing with Cockney.

00:07:55.793 --> 00:08:03.608
When there is an "l" sound in a
word, like in the word "milk",

00:08:03.633 --> 00:08:13.160
the word "milk", Cockney speakers tend
to make a "wa" sound where... Instead

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:18.973
of the "l". So, instead of: "A
glass of milk", they will say:

00:08:18.998 --> 00:08:23.234
"A glass of milwk, milwk",

00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:31.520
and they "wa", go like a "w". So...
And the "mail", m-a-i-l,

00:08:33.176 --> 00:08:35.400
when you have the
mail delivered,

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:42.607
they might say: "The mawl, maiwl, maiwl",
it's hard for me to say. "Maiwl", rather than

00:08:42.632 --> 00:08:50.770
"mail", the "l" you make with your tongue, and
the... The roof of your mouth just behind

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:58.333
your front top teeth: "mail, le, le".
"Mail" is the Cockney.

00:08:58.779 --> 00:09:02.738
And there's a place in
the west of the country,

00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:07.885
which I'm sure you've heard of...
Oh, I'll put it by this one.

00:09:09.516 --> 00:09:15.700
To the west of the West Country, the
country called Wales, and you've

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:21.429
probably heard of the Prince of
Wales, one of the royal family.

00:09:22.226 --> 00:09:24.080
This word, with a very

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:34.230
strong Cockney speaker, with a very strong
accent tends to pronounce it like: "Wows",

00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:43.107
not "Wales", but "Wows", which is like
saying "wow" with an "s" on the end.

00:09:43.177 --> 00:09:47.134
"Wows. We went to Wows
for our holiday."

00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:55.516
But it's actually "Wales". So
these are some examples of that.

00:09:55.703 --> 00:10:02.868
And one more aspect of
Cockney is the letter "h"...

00:10:05.153 --> 00:10:08.133
So if you have a
name like "Harry",

00:10:11.758 --> 00:10:24.165
"Harry" would be pronounced "Arry", and "have"
where you make the "h" sound "hu", "ave".

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:35.500
So, the Cockney speaker tends to miss off the
"h". Okay, so okay that's just a few examples

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:40.168
of how the Cockney
accent differs from RP.

00:10:40.193 --> 00:10:46.830
Okay, so now we have a little bit more space,
we'll move on a little bit further north.

00:10:46.948 --> 00:10:57.709
And the Midlands is an area of the country
about a hundred miles or more north of London,

00:10:57.734 --> 00:11:02.060
the Midlands, which is in
the middle of the country.

00:11:04.693 --> 00:11:08.000
Okay? And there's
the East Midlands

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:17.110
and the West Midlands. I happen to come from the
East Midlands. So my accent is now, because

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:24.370
I now live in London and I've lived in London
for a long time, my accent changed gradually

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:32.230
after I moved. But there is still a little
bit of a mixture in my accent. For example,

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:38.808
I still say words like
"bath" and "path",

00:11:42.336 --> 00:11:46.145
which is the same as the
American and Canadian

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:54.470
pronunciation. Lots of people say "bath" and
"path", but the RP pronunciation of these

00:11:54.470 --> 00:12:01.880
words is "baath" and "paath", so there are
a lot of these words where the "a" is not

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:09.475
the "a" sound, but the "aa" sound. So that is
one thing I have not changed in my accent;

00:12:10.264 --> 00:12:17.980
I still say "bath" and "path", because to
me it feels very strange psychologically to

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:25.415
talk about a "baath" or a "paath".
It's just a step too far for me.

00:12:25.514 --> 00:12:30.815
But other aspects of my
previous accent I have changed.

00:12:31.432 --> 00:12:35.612
For example, if you
have a cup of tea...

00:12:37.346 --> 00:12:46.440
A cup of tea, that's the RP pronunciation,
but where I come from in the Midlands, we

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:54.770
called it "a coop of tea". Okay? So, I'll
spell it like that, that's just a kind of

00:12:54.770 --> 00:13:03.014
phonetic spelling. Coop, coop of tea. So, it
feels very strange for me now to say "coop",

00:13:03.092 --> 00:13:06.577
because I have trained
myself to say "cup",

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.115
which feels more refined.
A nice cup of tea,

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:20.658
not a coop of tea. Okay? And
similarly, larger than a cup is a mug.

00:13:22.621 --> 00:13:31.823
That sort of thing is a mug, pronounced "mug",
but in the Midlands, they say "moog", a "moog".

00:13:32.448 --> 00:13:35.881
"Do you want it in
a coop or a moog?"

00:13:36.029 --> 00:13:44.265
Okay? That's how they would say it.
And the word "up", "up", "look up",

00:13:44.437 --> 00:13:51.617
they would say: "Look oop", so
that's another one. Similar.

00:13:51.913 --> 00:13:58.880
And in the Midlands also, and in other parts
of the country, sometimes people are very

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.355
friendly, and they
call people "love".

00:14:02.434 --> 00:14:04.670
"Hello, love, how
are you today?"

00:14:05.009 --> 00:14:13.842
They use it in the south, but of course in the
Midlands and the north, they say: "luv", okay?

00:14:14.764 --> 00:14:21.471
So, the word "love" as well used when you're speaking
to somebody in a friendly way: "Hello, love".

00:14:21.496 --> 00:14:33.089
"Love", "luv", they say "luv". Okay. Okay, so
that's just a few examples of the Midlands

00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:41.200
and the Northern as well. The further north
you go, you still get these, "bath", "paths",

00:14:41.225 --> 00:14:49.370
"cup", "mug", "love", "up", it's all very
similar, really. So from the Midlands upwards.

00:14:50.171 --> 00:14:57.149
Okay, moving on, there is the West Country,
which is over obviously to the west of England.

00:14:57.149 --> 00:15:03.635
Before you get to Wales, because Wales has
its own accent, which is different again.

00:15:03.768 --> 00:15:12.140
The West Country, I can't really imitate that
very well, but it... People sort of imagine

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:18.334
it as a very sort of farming
area, a kind of rural accent.

00:15:20.467 --> 00:15:25.830
And if... If you ever listen to a
radio program called "The Archers"

00:15:25.855 --> 00:15:31.750
on the radio BBC Radio 4,
they, some of the characters

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:38.820
in that program-it's a little drama
series-speak in this West Country accent.

00:15:39.045 --> 00:15:44.630
So, that's all I'm saying about West
Country, because I can't imitate it.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:52.690
So, moving on, apart from England, the country
that has given the language its name, "English",

00:15:53.049 --> 00:15:58.095
we have other countries.
Scotland in the far north,

00:15:58.705 --> 00:16:01.169
Wales in the far west,

00:16:01.505 --> 00:16:06.292
and then Irish, the other
island to the west,

00:16:06.317 --> 00:16:11.941
an island all on its own called
Ireland, which is confusing.

00:16:12.043 --> 00:16:26.443
"Ireland" is the name of the country, and
it is an island. And, of course, Britain,

00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:33.170
Scotland, and Wales is another island, because
it has the sea all around it. So, each of

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.610
these have their
own accent again.

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:43.209
So, with the Scottish accent, if a Scottish
person with their Scottish accent says:

00:16:43.234 --> 00:16:48.432
"I don't know", they
say: "Ah dinnae ken".

00:16:48.457 --> 00:17:01.668
Okay? So that means
"I don't know". So:

00:17:01.693 --> 00:17:08.894
"Ah dinnae ken" is the... My accent isn't very good,
but that... Those are the words that are used.

00:17:08.919 --> 00:17:19.612
"I don't know". Okay. And

00:17:19.803 --> 00:17:25.948
instead of saying "can't" or
"cannot", they say "cannae".

00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:35.950
"You cannae be serious.", "You can't be serious." I
think a tennis player used to say that, didn't he?

00:17:36.004 --> 00:17:41.595
If he was Scottish, he might have
said: "You cannae be serious, man."

00:17:41.946 --> 00:17:49.269
So, "cannae" instead of
"can't" or "cannot". Okay?

00:17:49.294 --> 00:17:54.091
So those are some examples of
Scottish accent and dialect.

00:17:54.138 --> 00:18:06.623
And Scottish people also, instead of saying:
"Yes", they say "Aye", so a-y-e means "yes".

00:18:06.726 --> 00:18:15.956
And they also, instead of saying: "Oh!", the
exclamation: "Oh! Oh!" They say: "Och! Och!"

00:18:15.981 --> 00:18:22.293
and they make this sound in the back of their
throat, which is like the German "ch" sound.

00:18:22.318 --> 00:18:33.350
So: "Och!" And they also have these large
expanses of water, like big lakes, which are

00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:43.700
called lochs, so "loch". So: "Och! I fell
in the loch!" And they also have a slightly

00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:51.783
different up and down in their voice as well.
"Och! I fell in the loch! Och! I'm wet through!"

00:18:51.853 --> 00:18:57.817
So they have a certain way of speaking. If
you've ever heard Sean Connery in a film,

00:18:57.842 --> 00:19:04.811
he changes his accent sometimes, but if you
hear Sean Connery, he's a Scottish actor,

00:19:04.836 --> 00:19:12.950
speaking in his Scottish accent, you will get
some idea of the Scottish sound. And also

00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:20.730
the younger actor, David Tennant, who also
uses different accents, but sometimes he uses

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:29.989
his native Scottish accent. Okay, right, so
that's some Scottish examples, and I just

00:19:29.989 --> 00:19:36.360
need to clear some space again to give
you just the last few examples. Okay.

00:19:36.985 --> 00:19:47.980
Okay, so just one more example for you. There are
various cities, which have their own distinct

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:55.037
accents. Okay? Places like Liverpool,
which is up in the northwest;

00:19:55.115 --> 00:19:58.908
Birmingham, which is
in the West Midlands;

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.485
Newcastle, which is
in the Northeast;

00:20:02.546 --> 00:20:06.193
and Glasgow up in Scotland.

00:20:06.264 --> 00:20:12.358
And I just would like to give you a few
examples from the Birmingham accent.

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:16.539
So, in Birmingham,

00:20:17.488 --> 00:20:21.569
if you say: "I'll,
I'll be there",

00:20:21.741 --> 00:20:25.315
they actually, they change the
vowel sound, and they say:

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:39.137
"Oil", so it's like "oil". If they say: "Fine"...
We say "fine", okay, but they say "foin",

00:20:39.162 --> 00:20:52.960
so like that. And the word for the cosmetics that you
put on your face, which we call "makeup", makeup,

00:20:55.296 --> 00:21:01.570
all one word. When you make up your face,
you're using makeup. They pronounce

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:13.742
it: "Mycoop, mycoop". Okay? So it's like "my",
"mycoop". "I'm going to buy some mycoop",

00:21:13.815 --> 00:21:17.135
instead of: "I'm going
to buy some makeup".

00:21:17.406 --> 00:21:20.455
Okay. So that's just a
few examples to show

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:25.070
how a particular accent can
change the vowel sound.

00:21:25.366 --> 00:21:33.840
Right, so having said all of this and given you
some examples, just to come back to London

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:42.419
briefly and any other big city, you get many,
many accents in a big city; you get the accents

00:21:42.419 --> 00:21:50.159
from the people who live in that country, the
national accents and the regional accents

00:21:50.159 --> 00:21:57.249
from different parts of the country, and you
also get all the international accents from

00:21:57.249 --> 00:22:04.399
people who have come from other countries.
Okay? So in any big city that you visit, you

00:22:04.399 --> 00:22:08.515
will hear many, many
different accents.

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.971
But there are three main things
that really matter with accent.

00:22:15.065 --> 00:22:20.181
It doesn't really matter so
much which accent you use,

00:22:20.206 --> 00:22:25.029
as long as you have
these three things:

00:22:25.029 --> 00:22:30.349
Clarity, that's if you
speak clearly. Okay?

00:22:30.505 --> 00:22:36.945
Pace or the speed, don't speak too
quickly and you can ask other

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:42.138
people to speak more slowly
for you to understand them.

00:22:42.282 --> 00:22:46.647
And volume, sometimes
people speak very quietly,

00:22:46.672 --> 00:22:51.931
and you need to ask them to
speak more loudly, to speak up.

00:22:52.032 --> 00:22:58.255
Those are the three main things. Whatever your
accent, don't worry too much about your accent,

00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.793
just try to be clear,

00:23:00.818 --> 00:23:03.130
don't speak too quickly,

00:23:03.291 --> 00:23:08.031
and speak with a good
volume; not too quietly.

00:23:08.056 --> 00:23:16.059
Don't be so shy about making mistakes that
you speak too quietly. Make it fairly loud.

00:23:16.716 --> 00:23:24.123
Okay, so I hope that little overview of
U.K. accents has been useful for you.

00:23:24.264 --> 00:23:32.029
And if you'd like to test your knowledge, we
have a quiz on the website, www.engvid.com.

00:23:32.123 --> 00:23:34.982
So if you'd like to go
there and do the quiz,

00:23:35.068 --> 00:23:40.438
and if you'd like to subscribe to my
channel on YouTube, that would be great.

00:23:40.524 --> 00:23:44.761
And so, thank you for watching
and hope to see you again soon.

00:23:44.817 --> 00:23:46.216
Okay, bye.
