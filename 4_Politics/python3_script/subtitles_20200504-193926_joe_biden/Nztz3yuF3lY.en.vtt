00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:02.969
It is truly an honor
to have you here on the show.

00:00:03.002 --> 00:00:05.405
And just so we're all
on the same page ahead of time,

00:00:05.438 --> 00:00:06.572
there are certain rules

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:09.208
when speaking
to a Supreme Court justice,

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:11.744
especially on TV,
and a few of those are, um...

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:16.149
I-I know that you cannot speak
about any cases,

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:18.217
uh, or any of your colleagues

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.286
or anything
that could negatively impact

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:22.555
the institution
that is the Supreme Court.

00:00:22.588 --> 00:00:23.890
-That is correct?
-That is correct.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.758
So, I just have a few...

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:28.494
-These-these ones.
-(laughter)

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:30.630
This.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.432
There's one.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.634
This one.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:35.835
These ones.

00:00:35.868 --> 00:00:36.969
Okay.

00:00:37.002 --> 00:00:39.172
No. These ones are...

00:00:39.205 --> 00:00:41.741
All right. Um...

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:43.042
No, welcome to the show.

00:00:43.075 --> 00:00:44.377
Let's begin with the book.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.812
-For... -I haven't left you
with much, right?

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.213
No, you have, you have.

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:48.648
'Cause I-I want to talk
about the book,

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:49.816
and then, you know,
after the break,

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:51.517
it would be great
to get into the court

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.985
and everything
you've experienced

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:54.153
while serving on it.

00:00:54.186 --> 00:00:56.489
-Um, a children's book...
-Yes.

00:00:56.522 --> 00:00:58.691
is not exactly
where you would expect

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:00.393
a Supreme Court justice to be.

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.528
You know, you'd expect it
to be a book about law

00:01:02.561 --> 00:01:04.797
or a book, you know, about
what's happening in the country

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.466
or life in legalese.

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:08.634
But a children's book
is what you wrote.

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:11.070
Just Ask!
Be Different, Be Brave, Be You.

00:01:11.103 --> 00:01:12.839
Why?

00:01:13.873 --> 00:01:16.109
I write law every single day.

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.145
-(laughs)
-And most of it...

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:22.582
and most of it is gonna go down
in the history books.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.184
And after much time passes,

00:01:25.217 --> 00:01:29.455
uh, some people may read
one or two of those decisions.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:33.726
But if I can affect the lives
of children,

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.529
if I can inspire them

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:40.566
to be bigger, better, braver

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:43.803
than they believe they can be,

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:47.106
then I've left a real legacy
of my judgment.

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:49.075
And so, for me,

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:52.411
when I write for children
or speak to them,

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:55.815
it's to create that lasting gift

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:59.352
that I hope will inspire them

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:03.222
to do something that
they haven't even dreamed about.

00:02:03.255 --> 00:02:06.092
-Wow.
-I'm a Supreme Court justice,

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.894
and I tell kids all the time,

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:11.097
I grew up
in a Bronx housing project.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.300
There were no lawyers
or, uh, judges

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.769
in the housing projects,

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:19.605
and I had no idea
what the Supreme Court was.

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:23.276
I didn't start to learn about it
probably till high school,

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.379
which is about when
I started to read newspapers

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:27.914
-like The New York Times.
-Right.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:29.916
Before that, in my home,

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:33.152
we had the Daily News,
the New York Post

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:36.556
and, um, the Spanish newspaper,

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:39.792
which my father brought home
every day, uh, from...

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.494
as he rode the train home.

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:45.665
But, for me,
that's what I want kids to do,

00:02:45.698 --> 00:02:48.100
to want to be more
than they can imagine.

00:02:48.133 --> 00:02:50.770
Who inspired you to be more
than you could imagine?

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.705
Because here you are
in a position,

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:55.408
highest court in the land,
inspiring the youth,

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.843
but someone had to inspire you.

00:02:57.876 --> 00:02:59.312
My mother.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:01.914
Born in greater poverty
than I...

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:04.850
ever existed
for me and my brother,

00:03:04.883 --> 00:03:07.787
uh, in a situation
in which her mother died

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.756
when she was nine
and her father abandoned her

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:13.426
and being raised

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.761
by her older brother
and older sister.

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:19.098
It was a tough, tough life
that she had,

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:23.469
and she did what millions of
other young Americans have done.

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:26.439
-She joined the army.
-Wow.

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:29.108
During World War II,
and she came over to the states,

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.210
and she ultimately met
my father,

00:03:31.243 --> 00:03:32.979
and my brother and I followed.

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:36.816
But my mom, in her 40s,
went back--

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.352
not went back-- went to college

00:03:39.385 --> 00:03:43.689
and, uh, got
her registered nursing license.

00:03:43.722 --> 00:03:45.925
That is amazing.
That is amazing.

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.961
-(applause)
-Wow.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.234
-So... -So, it's really hard,
with a mother like that,

00:03:55.267 --> 00:03:57.770
not to think
education's valuable.

00:03:57.803 --> 00:04:00.006
I can only imagine.
And in the book,

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:04.010
it really speaks to it
because you are talking to kids

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:05.911
from a very personal place.

00:04:05.944 --> 00:04:07.880
-Very.
-The book is called Just Ask!

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:10.283
And what I really... what
I really love about the book

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.617
is you have these stories

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:13.919
of a group of kids
who go into a garden,

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:16.055
and really it's a tale
about children

00:04:16.088 --> 00:04:18.024
who may be facing difficulties
in their lives.

00:04:18.057 --> 00:04:20.960
You know, you-you have
a little child who has ADHD.

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:23.129
You have another child
who has Tourette's.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:24.930
You have Sonia,
who has diabetes.

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:26.532
I-I wonder where that came from.

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:28.000
-(laughs)
-And, um...

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.269
and-and it's-it's a story
about the kids

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:32.204
having whatever they have
to deal with,

00:04:32.237 --> 00:04:34.874
but the one obstacle
you don't want them to face

00:04:34.907 --> 00:04:37.677
is people judging them because
of what they have to deal with.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.679
Judging them
because of their difference.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:42.481
Right. How did people judge you
because of your differences?

00:04:42.514 --> 00:04:44.650
Like, w-was there ever something
that happened to you

00:04:44.683 --> 00:04:46.185
where-where diabetes--

00:04:46.218 --> 00:04:48.254
-You know, it seems like
everyone just accepts that. -Oh.

00:04:48.287 --> 00:04:51.524
No. But I-- They don't.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:55.494
And the Just Ask! title was born

00:04:55.527 --> 00:04:57.763
over 30 years ago.

00:04:57.796 --> 00:04:59.498
When I was seven and a half,

00:04:59.531 --> 00:05:01.233
I was diagnosed with diabetes,

00:05:01.266 --> 00:05:05.571
and I started to give myself
injections of insulin every day.

00:05:05.604 --> 00:05:09.241
And, as was common back then--

00:05:09.274 --> 00:05:11.744
gratefully, less common today--

00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:14.547
you were-- I was embarrassed

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.415
-by my condition.
-Right.

00:05:16.448 --> 00:05:18.351
I thought it showed weakness.

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:20.953
I thought my friends
would make fun of it.

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:23.022
And so I hid it.

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:26.025
And as I grew older

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:28.260
and I took multiple shots
a day--

00:05:28.293 --> 00:05:31.397
'Cause, at first, it was only
one, and I did that at home.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.532
Over time, it grew to two shots

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:36.202
and still at home,
morning and afternoon.

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:37.870
But as I grew older,

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:40.339
multiple shots a day
were more common

00:05:40.372 --> 00:05:43.943
and more frequently
before I ate anything.

00:05:43.976 --> 00:05:47.947
I was in a restaurant in
New York in my thir-- early 30s,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.015
and I would order my meal

00:05:50.048 --> 00:05:53.285
and then go to the bathroom
to give myself my shot.

00:05:53.318 --> 00:05:56.155
This day,
I didn't go into the stall.

00:05:56.188 --> 00:05:57.890
I stayed in the public areas

00:05:57.923 --> 00:06:00.159
because it was
a two-stall bathroom,

00:06:00.192 --> 00:06:02.027
-and there was no one there.
-Mm-hmm.

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.330
As I was finishing,
a woman walked in.

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:07.933
She saw me doing what
I was doing and finishing up,

00:06:07.966 --> 00:06:09.802
putting my injection away.

00:06:09.835 --> 00:06:11.604
And I walked out.

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.939
I ate dinner, finished,

00:06:13.972 --> 00:06:15.341
walked by the woman

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:18.511
and I overheard her say
to her companion,

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.981
"She's a drug addict."

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:23.983
And I stopped.

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:29.188
And the first emotion I felt
was shame.

00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:31.791
I was mortified.

00:06:31.824 --> 00:06:33.926
And then...

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:36.162
I thought about it for a second.

00:06:36.195 --> 00:06:39.432
And I turned around and marched
back to the woman and said,

00:06:39.465 --> 00:06:40.766
"I'm not a drug addict.

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:42.635
"I'm a diabetic.

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:44.970
"And that shot you saw me take

00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:48.974
"is the medicine that saves
my life every day, insulin.

00:06:49.007 --> 00:06:52.711
"And if you don't understand

00:06:52.744 --> 00:06:56.782
"when someone's doing something
different than you expect,

00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:58.784
"just ask.

00:06:58.817 --> 00:07:01.854
Don't presume
the worst in people."

00:07:01.887 --> 00:07:04.123
-And I walked away.
-Wow.

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:07.126
-And...
-(applause)

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:09.128
Wow.

00:07:13.632 --> 00:07:17.736
But that didn't make me decide

00:07:17.769 --> 00:07:20.739
to disclose my diabetes
to others.

00:07:20.772 --> 00:07:22.274
Not yet.

00:07:22.307 --> 00:07:24.677
What happened a few years later

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:28.681
is I was at a party
that I threw at my home

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:33.085
with some of my best friends
that I have in the whole world,

00:07:33.118 --> 00:07:35.955
people who I know adore
and love me

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:40.493
and who take care of me
in every situation.

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:42.294
And, all of a sudden,

00:07:42.327 --> 00:07:45.564
I fell asleep on my bed.

00:07:45.597 --> 00:07:47.967
And they thought I was asleep.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.504
-I was really in a sugar low.
-Right.

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:54.340
I was semi-unconscious.

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:58.544
Thankfully,
someone had to, uh,

00:07:58.577 --> 00:08:00.212
shake me

00:08:00.245 --> 00:08:03.482
to ask me for the telephone
for a cab to go home.

00:08:03.515 --> 00:08:06.018
This is before Uber,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:07.686
(laughing)

00:08:07.719 --> 00:08:10.089
And Lyft
and all those other things.

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:11.957
At any rate, um,

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:14.560
I struggled with trying
to remember the number,

00:08:14.593 --> 00:08:16.362
-and I couldn't.
-Wow.

00:08:16.395 --> 00:08:19.832
But I then just sat on a stair
that was--

00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:24.169
I had-- My backyard had,
um, a set of small steps,

00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:25.571
and I sat down there.

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:27.106
Couldn't go much further.

00:08:27.139 --> 00:08:29.441
'Cause that's what
sugar lows do to you.

00:08:29.474 --> 00:08:33.045
And one of my friends walked
over with a piece of cake,

00:08:33.078 --> 00:08:37.216
and I grabbed it with my hand
and stuffed my face with it,

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:40.019
which was
an unconscious reaction

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.887
-that I needed the sugar
in the cake. -Because you knew

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.355
-you needed the sugar.
-Right.

00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:47.359
Well, my friends didn't know
what was happening,

00:08:47.392 --> 00:08:49.828
'cause I had never told them.

00:08:49.861 --> 00:08:55.034
And so I almost died in a room
full of people who love me.

00:08:55.067 --> 00:08:57.202
And I thought about it

00:08:57.235 --> 00:09:00.873
and had a conversation
with many of them afterwards

00:09:00.906 --> 00:09:03.342
about what happened, why.

00:09:03.375 --> 00:09:06.445
And I realized

00:09:06.478 --> 00:09:09.648
that I should not hide
my condition,

00:09:09.681 --> 00:09:13.152
not only because
it was dangerous for me,

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:17.289
but because if something
had happened to me,

00:09:17.322 --> 00:09:19.858
and my friends were there,

00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:22.528
they would never be able
to forgive themselves.

00:09:22.561 --> 00:09:24.830
Because they wouldn't have known
something about you

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:26.231
that could have saved your life.

00:09:26.264 --> 00:09:27.566
Exactly.

00:09:27.599 --> 00:09:30.169
And I think
it was a kindness to me

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:31.770
and one to my friends

00:09:31.803 --> 00:09:34.773
where I then chose to become
open about my condition.

00:09:34.806 --> 00:09:37.176
And Just Ask!

00:09:37.209 --> 00:09:40.012
is encouraging friends

00:09:40.045 --> 00:09:42.781
to look at the people
in your life

00:09:42.814 --> 00:09:46.352
who do things differently,
or are differently-abled...

00:09:46.385 --> 00:09:47.586
Right.

00:09:47.619 --> 00:09:49.622
...and talk to them about it.

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:54.093
Figure out and find out
how it affects them

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:56.895
and how you can help and when.

00:09:56.928 --> 00:09:59.465
'Cause I don't need help
all the time,

00:09:59.498 --> 00:10:01.533
but I do sometimes,

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:03.235
and people should know that.

00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:04.803
And you should know that

00:10:04.836 --> 00:10:07.573
-about the people
you love and care about. -Wow.

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:09.575
And so, for me,

00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:12.678
the Just Ask! is encouraging,

00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:15.681
not just the children like me

00:10:15.714 --> 00:10:17.750
-who are differently-abled...
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:19.852
...to speak
about their conditions,

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:23.422
to be brave about them
in the way they are every day.

00:10:23.455 --> 00:10:26.692
-Right.
-Think about how hard it is

00:10:26.725 --> 00:10:30.629
for a dyslexic child to read.

00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:33.565
Now, they can do it,

00:10:33.598 --> 00:10:37.403
and they do it every day
that they're in school,

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:40.272
-but it's a challenge for them.
-Right.

00:10:40.305 --> 00:10:43.909
And it's important
to understand that challenge.

00:10:43.942 --> 00:10:45.911
Or Julia,

00:10:45.944 --> 00:10:50.249
who bares the name of a special
little girl in my life,

00:10:50.282 --> 00:10:53.085
who has Tourette's syndrome.

00:10:53.118 --> 00:10:56.422
And it's actually one of
my favorite scenes is that one.

00:10:56.455 --> 00:10:58.424
If you look in the book,
you'll see.

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:00.392
Uh, one of the symptoms

00:11:00.425 --> 00:11:03.929
-of Tourette's is uncontrolled
body movements. -Right.

00:11:03.962 --> 00:11:05.931
Blinking is one of them,

00:11:05.964 --> 00:11:10.235
-but so are unexpected motions,
sometimes sounds. -Mm-hmm.

00:11:10.268 --> 00:11:13.906
And, um, Julia's blinking,

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:17.810
and the owl blinks back at her.

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:21.580
But Julia had an incident
when she was smaller.

00:11:21.613 --> 00:11:24.850
She was in a, uh, store,

00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:29.021
and her Tourette's went
into action,

00:11:29.054 --> 00:11:32.091
and she was moving
around uncontrollably.

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:34.126
And a woman looked at her
and said,

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:36.495
"Don't you have a mother
that can control you?"

00:11:36.528 --> 00:11:38.430
Wow.

00:11:38.463 --> 00:11:40.065
Thankfully, she does.

00:11:40.098 --> 00:11:42.101
She has a mother
who's a school teacher

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:44.169
and set that lady straight.

00:11:44.202 --> 00:11:46.839
-(laughter, applause)
-Uh... uh...

00:11:46.872 --> 00:11:49.875
Oh, I love it.

00:11:49.908 --> 00:11:51.543
But...

00:11:51.576 --> 00:11:52.911
Every-every single story

00:11:52.944 --> 00:11:55.247
in the book has that feeling
of overcoming.

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.350
I also love that you-you have
the book in Spanish, as well.

00:11:58.383 --> 00:12:00.219
Just Ask! es ¡Solo Pregunta!

00:12:00.252 --> 00:12:02.287
-if I've said that correctly.
-(applause and cheering)

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.023
And the book is available now,

00:12:05.056 --> 00:12:07.126
Just Ask!

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:09.194
I've-I've always wondered
what it is like

00:12:09.227 --> 00:12:11.697
to be on a Supreme Court,
and not just in terms

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.333
of the legal part of it,
but all of the pressures

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:16.301
that come with the job,
you know.

00:12:16.334 --> 00:12:19.571
Shaping the course of a country
and at the same time,

00:12:19.604 --> 00:12:21.874
trying to remove yourself
from the fray

00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:24.443
of what's defining what is
happening in that country.

00:12:24.476 --> 00:12:28.514
How removed are Supreme Court
justices from the everyday fray?

00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:31.049
Like, are you just, like,
Instagram only, no Twitter?

00:12:31.082 --> 00:12:33.051
-Is that what you do?
-(laughter)

00:12:33.084 --> 00:12:34.486
I don't do either.

00:12:34.519 --> 00:12:36.522
Um, some of my colleagues might.

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:38.490
I won't give them up, okay?

00:12:38.523 --> 00:12:40.659
-I'm gonna say Ruth Bader
Ginsburg. -Um, no, no, no, no.

00:12:40.692 --> 00:12:42.561
I'm saying Ruth Bader Ginsburg--
Twitter.

00:12:42.594 --> 00:12:45.130
That's what I'm going with.

00:12:45.163 --> 00:12:47.966
I think
that would be farfetched. Um...

00:12:47.999 --> 00:12:51.170
(laughter)

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:54.540
Every one of the nine justices

00:12:54.573 --> 00:12:59.378
were incredibly
devoted citizens,

00:12:59.411 --> 00:13:04.249
and they were very active
in our world

00:13:04.282 --> 00:13:06.552
before they became justices.

00:13:06.585 --> 00:13:09.054
Some of them were even
in the political arena.

00:13:09.087 --> 00:13:12.324
Some of them have worked
for the White House. Others...

00:13:12.357 --> 00:13:17.062
Everybody has, as one of my dear
judge friends once said to me,

00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:21.500
most judges are political,
either in the capital "P" sense

00:13:21.533 --> 00:13:23.368
or the small "P" sense.

00:13:23.401 --> 00:13:26.939
And the capital "P" is those
who have worked in politics.

00:13:26.972 --> 00:13:29.308
The small "P"
are people like me,

00:13:29.341 --> 00:13:32.244
who were involved
in nonprofit organization

00:13:32.277 --> 00:13:34.746
and other
government organization.

00:13:34.779 --> 00:13:37.850
So everyone is
an involved person.

00:13:37.883 --> 00:13:40.152
And I daresay
that every one of us

00:13:40.185 --> 00:13:42.154
is a little bit above the fray,

00:13:42.187 --> 00:13:44.990
-because we can't comment
about the fray. -Mm-hmm.

00:13:45.023 --> 00:13:47.960
But we certainly read about
what's happening in the world,

00:13:47.993 --> 00:13:50.429
and we stay tuned to the news.

00:13:50.462 --> 00:13:52.931
I'm not gonna say which channel.

00:13:52.964 --> 00:13:54.933
-Uh... but...
-(laughter)

00:13:54.966 --> 00:13:57.636
-She watches The Daily Show.
That, I mean... -(laughter)

00:13:57.669 --> 00:13:58.604
-that's what...
-(cheering, applause)

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:00.138
But no, no, no, no, no, don't...

00:14:00.171 --> 00:14:02.140
No, no, no. No, no,
you can't applaud, because then

00:14:02.173 --> 00:14:04.409
-it would be true. We know,
but... Sorry. -Exactly.

00:14:04.442 --> 00:14:06.678
No, let's carry on.
Please, forgive them, Justice.

00:14:06.711 --> 00:14:09.014
I know. We know.
But carry on.

00:14:09.047 --> 00:14:12.117
But the point is that, um,

00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:15.354
we're not monastic
in the sense of...

00:14:15.387 --> 00:14:17.823
not knowing what's happening
in the world.

00:14:17.856 --> 00:14:21.193
So how do you then...
you know, relate to each other?

00:14:21.226 --> 00:14:23.962
-Because one thing that...
-We don't talk about politics.

00:14:23.995 --> 00:14:26.431
That's interesting. That's
actually what I wanted to know,

00:14:26.464 --> 00:14:28.433
because you have...
you have nine people

00:14:28.466 --> 00:14:30.535
who have
different political leanings,

00:14:30.568 --> 00:14:33.805
who are all extremely skilled
when it comes to applying law,

00:14:33.838 --> 00:14:36.008
and oftentimes, you have
to argue against each other.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:38.010
So when you're having lunch
with each other,

00:14:38.043 --> 00:14:40.012
when you're just, you know,
in that down time,

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:42.014
what do you talk about?
No politics.

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:44.016
We stay away from religion
and politics,

00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:46.018
-Ah. -the two subjects
that most people who,

00:14:46.051 --> 00:14:48.320
if they don't want to fight,
should stay away from.

00:14:48.353 --> 00:14:50.489
-Ah.
-Um, and we do.

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:53.959
So, what do we talk about?

00:14:53.992 --> 00:14:56.662
What bad movie did we see
yesterday?

00:14:56.695 --> 00:14:58.497
(laughter)

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:00.699
-Sometimes what good movie.
-Okay.

00:15:00.732 --> 00:15:02.401
What books we're reading.

00:15:02.434 --> 00:15:05.103
And most of my colleagues--
myself included--

00:15:05.136 --> 00:15:06.772
love history books.

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:09.908
And so all of us
are generally reading something

00:15:09.941 --> 00:15:13.245
that we find fun and will
recommend to the others.

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:15.614
-Interesting.
-We talk about kids,

00:15:15.647 --> 00:15:18.550
lots of talks...
talk about grandchildren.

00:15:18.583 --> 00:15:21.386
Uh, sometimes about food.

00:15:21.419 --> 00:15:26.858
Um, any topic that any group
of friends would have

00:15:26.891 --> 00:15:29.261
that doesn't involve
a contentious issue,

00:15:29.294 --> 00:15:31.096
-we talk about.
-Okay. Okay.

00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:32.764
So you stay away from politics

00:15:32.797 --> 00:15:34.900
and, then, the final episode
of Game of Thrones.

00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:36.435
-That makes sense.
-(laughter)

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:38.870
The, um...
the-the-the court

00:15:38.903 --> 00:15:40.872
is constantly thrust
into the spotlight,

00:15:40.905 --> 00:15:42.674
especially in American news.

00:15:42.707 --> 00:15:45.644
Now, you know, apart from
presidents that come and go,

00:15:45.677 --> 00:15:48.013
apart from news stories
that come and go,

00:15:48.046 --> 00:15:51.049
what do you think is important
in and around, you know,

00:15:51.082 --> 00:15:53.785
a confirmation of a justice
or-or-or what do you think

00:15:53.818 --> 00:15:56.321
the most important qualities
of a judge have to be?

00:15:56.354 --> 00:15:58.757
Because it is, you know,
one of the highest positions

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.625
you can possess in the land.

00:16:00.658 --> 00:16:02.194
Uh...

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:04.529
I'm gonna answer that
differently.

00:16:04.562 --> 00:16:07.132
I'm going to answer a question
you haven't asked

00:16:07.165 --> 00:16:09.401
but I think
is much more important.

00:16:09.434 --> 00:16:13.105
What should you possess
as a citizen?

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:15.140
-Hmm.
-And I think that,

00:16:15.173 --> 00:16:17.175
in this roomful of people,

00:16:17.208 --> 00:16:21.279
if I ask every non-lawyer
in the room,

00:16:21.312 --> 00:16:23.782
and maybe some lawyers,

00:16:23.815 --> 00:16:26.752
how many Supreme Court decisions
have you read

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.987
from beginning to end,

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:32.057
no one will raise their hand.

00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:34.092
All the news people get

00:16:34.125 --> 00:16:36.728
is from the newspapers
or television.

00:16:36.761 --> 00:16:38.330
-The sound bite.
-Right.

00:16:38.363 --> 00:16:40.499
-You know, the headline.
-Yes.

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:42.467
This side won.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:45.404
This side lost.

00:16:45.437 --> 00:16:48.140
But nobody talks
about the reasoning.

00:16:48.173 --> 00:16:50.308
Very few people do.

00:16:50.341 --> 00:16:53.912
They'll quote a sentence here,
a sentence there.

00:16:53.945 --> 00:16:57.249
But I think if you're gonna be
an informed person,

00:16:57.282 --> 00:17:00.152
you should really read
the decisions.

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:02.387
Because that's
where both sides--

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.891
if there are two sides;
court agrees a lot,

00:17:05.924 --> 00:17:08.560
-so it's not that every case
is split. -Right.

00:17:08.593 --> 00:17:11.696
But those that are,
you should read both sides.

00:17:11.729 --> 00:17:13.799
To understand
which arguments were applied

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.767
-and why they were applied.
-Exactly.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.337
And I think you will think
more highly of the judges,

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:23.842
and I think you'll realize
something that most people...

00:17:23.875 --> 00:17:26.278
think... don't think of.

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:30.749
You like a decision, so you
agree with the side that won.

00:17:30.782 --> 00:17:33.318
If you don't,
you're gonna disagree with them.

00:17:33.351 --> 00:17:36.721
-Mm-hmm. -But unless you engage
with the arguments,

00:17:36.754 --> 00:17:40.092
you don't understand
how hard the questions are.

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:42.928
And the fact
that even when you win,

00:17:42.961 --> 00:17:45.163
sometimes it wasn't so clear...

00:17:45.196 --> 00:17:47.365
that you should have.

00:17:47.398 --> 00:17:50.669
And so I think it would make
people much more respectful

00:17:50.702 --> 00:17:54.606
of the court as an institution,
but of courts generally,

00:17:54.639 --> 00:17:57.142
if they took the time
to read those decisions

00:17:57.175 --> 00:17:59.578
that they feel affect them
so deeply.

00:17:59.611 --> 00:18:02.781
Oh, that's powerful,
but people won't read.

00:18:02.814 --> 00:18:04.316
Um...

00:18:04.349 --> 00:18:06.118
-So my counter would be...
-But...

00:18:06.151 --> 00:18:07.986
-My counter...
-You count on that.

00:18:08.019 --> 00:18:10.322
I-- Yes. No, I mean,
I... (stammering)

00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:12.390
You know, everyone would like
the idea of everyone reading,

00:18:12.423 --> 00:18:14.359
but my counter would be
what you just said.

00:18:14.392 --> 00:18:15.894
You said people get their news
from the TV

00:18:15.927 --> 00:18:17.562
-and the headlines
and the sound bites. -Mm-hmm.

00:18:17.595 --> 00:18:22.234
The Supreme Court is still only
in written and audio form,

00:18:22.267 --> 00:18:24.302
and I'm saying, like,
I could produce,

00:18:24.335 --> 00:18:26.838
like, a courtroom show,

00:18:26.871 --> 00:18:28.940
where, like,
you guys are on camera.

00:18:28.973 --> 00:18:30.275
'Cause I'm sure some people

00:18:30.308 --> 00:18:31.576
don't even recognize you
in the street,

00:18:31.609 --> 00:18:32.944
and you effect the country.

00:18:32.977 --> 00:18:34.379
You could be signing autographs.

00:18:34.412 --> 00:18:35.847
(laughter)

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.315
I'm not saying
I could make you famous.

00:18:37.348 --> 00:18:39.251
I'm just saying,
like, you know...

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.952
I'm saying we could, like,
do you think maybe

00:18:40.985 --> 00:18:43.021
the court should jump in
to the era of, like, TV,

00:18:43.054 --> 00:18:45.457
-and broadcast
what you're doing? -No.

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.459
(laughter)

00:18:47.492 --> 00:18:50.028
You walk into our courtrooms,

00:18:50.061 --> 00:18:53.598
and we're not made for TV.

00:18:53.631 --> 00:18:56.601
The lawyers have presented us
with briefs.

00:18:56.634 --> 00:18:58.570
Friends of the court,
called amici,

00:18:58.603 --> 00:19:00.405
a lot more briefs.

00:19:00.438 --> 00:19:02.841
The courts below have made
a decision.

00:19:02.874 --> 00:19:05.443
We start questioning lawyers.

00:19:05.476 --> 00:19:07.512
Most of the time, the audience
doesn't understand

00:19:07.545 --> 00:19:09.314
-what we're talking about,
-Mm-hmm.

00:19:09.347 --> 00:19:11.816
because we're asking
from knowledge.

00:19:11.849 --> 00:19:15.854
We're asking from the place
where we have a question

00:19:15.887 --> 00:19:19.224
after everybody's finished
explaining everything to us.

00:19:19.257 --> 00:19:23.595
And so, what we say can
sometimes just be challenging

00:19:23.628 --> 00:19:26.898
for the sake of eliciting
a response.

00:19:26.931 --> 00:19:29.534
Sometimes,
it can be genuine doubt

00:19:29.567 --> 00:19:32.971
about what the position
of a person might be.

00:19:33.004 --> 00:19:35.607
Sometimes we're talking
to each other,

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.743
and we're raising points
through the questions

00:19:38.776 --> 00:19:42.347
that we want our colleagues
to consider with us.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.082
Because we're thinking
about it,

00:19:44.115 --> 00:19:46.818
and we know
we're gonna bring it up

00:19:46.851 --> 00:19:49.487
at conference among ourselves,

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.556
so it's nice to get it out

00:19:51.589 --> 00:19:54.159
so that we can have some time
to think on it.

00:19:54.192 --> 00:19:57.495
So there's lots of reasons
for what we're doing,

00:19:57.528 --> 00:20:01.866
but none of them are ever
perfectly understood,

00:20:01.899 --> 00:20:06.371
often not, among the people
who are listening.

00:20:06.404 --> 00:20:10.508
And I think if our arguments
were televised,

00:20:10.541 --> 00:20:13.878
it might change the dynamic.

00:20:13.911 --> 00:20:17.048
You're gonna get some people
who will ask less questions.

00:20:17.081 --> 00:20:20.385
We already have one person
who's made that choice.

00:20:20.418 --> 00:20:23.888
If you want more,
I think it could happen.

00:20:23.921 --> 00:20:27.092
You would have
more studied questions,

00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:31.663
rather than those questions
which are less studied

00:20:31.696 --> 00:20:35.267
and more inquisitive,
and that we do ask

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.535
and seek answers to.

00:20:37.568 --> 00:20:40.472
And we're human beings.

00:20:40.505 --> 00:20:44.042
And the draw to play to TV

00:20:44.075 --> 00:20:47.012
effects every human being.

00:20:47.045 --> 00:20:50.649
And so I think you would change
our institution

00:20:50.682 --> 00:20:53.451
so dramatically, that it
would be for its worse,

00:20:53.484 --> 00:20:56.521
not for
the country's betterment.

00:20:56.554 --> 00:20:59.424
Every decision we make
is written.

00:20:59.457 --> 00:21:02.861
Fully explained,
fully defended,

00:21:02.894 --> 00:21:05.030
fully laid out.

00:21:05.063 --> 00:21:09.100
But you can't do that
and maintain a show.

00:21:09.133 --> 00:21:12.070
Now that you've said that,
I feel like no part

00:21:12.103 --> 00:21:15.040
of the U.S. government
should be on TV.

00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:18.643
Actually, that's what
some senator said to me,

00:21:18.676 --> 00:21:21.813
that the partisanship
in the Senate

00:21:21.846 --> 00:21:25.650
started to grow when cameras
went into the Senate room.

00:21:25.683 --> 00:21:28.119
Because you want to appeal,
and you want to win votes,

00:21:28.152 --> 00:21:29.754
and you want--
Yeah, it makes sense.

00:21:29.787 --> 00:21:32.757
I think the public has no idea
that those Senate rooms now

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.993
are completely empty.

00:21:35.026 --> 00:21:37.062
It's the chair of the Senate,

00:21:37.095 --> 00:21:40.231
it is the senator speaking,

00:21:40.264 --> 00:21:43.068
and some members of his staff.

00:21:43.101 --> 00:21:46.571
There is no one else in the room
but the camera,

00:21:46.604 --> 00:21:48.440
and they're speaking

00:21:48.473 --> 00:21:51.109
to the camera,
not to each other.

00:21:51.142 --> 00:21:54.346
And I know, because I was
interviewed by senators.

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:56.381
They're not back in
their offices listening

00:21:56.414 --> 00:21:59.017
to what's happening on TV.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:02.287
They're back in their office
conducting business.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.156
Maybe a staffer is watching.

00:22:05.189 --> 00:22:08.460
But many senators told me
that they felt

00:22:08.493 --> 00:22:11.429
that much of
the collegiality died

00:22:11.462 --> 00:22:15.667
when they stopped getting
together in that room

00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:18.737
and were forced to listen
to each other,

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:21.306
and were forced to sit next
to each other

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:23.341
and talk to each other.

00:22:23.374 --> 00:22:25.009
Now they barely see each other

00:22:25.042 --> 00:22:27.212
except running through
the hallways.

00:22:27.245 --> 00:22:30.315
So I think, hmm,
you said a joke,

00:22:30.348 --> 00:22:32.751
some might think
it might be a good idea

00:22:32.784 --> 00:22:34.419
-to return to those days.
-It's because I understand

00:22:34.452 --> 00:22:38.456
how difficult it can be
to be natural on TV.

00:22:38.489 --> 00:22:40.492
Justice Sonia Sotomayor,
everybody.
