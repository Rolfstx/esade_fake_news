00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.430
Thank you very much.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.810
Thank you.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.389
Thank you, President Powers, Provost Fenves,
Deans, members of the faculty, family and

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:21.250
friends and most importantly, the class of
2014.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.830
It is indeed an honor for me to be here tonight.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.630
It's been almost 37 years to the day that
I graduated from UT.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.140
I remember a lot of things about that day.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.050
I remember I had throbbing headache from a
party the night before.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:47.590
I remember I had a serious girlfriend, whom
I later married—that's important to remember,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.780
by the way—and I remember I was getting
commissioned in the Navy that day.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.150
But of all the things I remember, I don't
have a clue who the commencement speaker was,

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.690
and I certainly don't remember anything they
said.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.710
So, acknowledging that fact, if I can't make
this commencement speech memorable, I will

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.229
at least try to make it short.

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.979
The University's slogan is, "What starts here
changes the world."

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.200
I've got to admit, I kinda like it.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.939
"What starts here changes the world."

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.810
Tonight there are almost 8,000 students, there
are more than 8,000 students graduating from

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:23.810
UT.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.440
That great paragon of analytical rigor, Ask.Com,
says that the average American will meet 10,000

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.880
people in their lifetime.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.960
10,000 people.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.140
That's a lot of folks.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.170
But if every one of you changed the lives
of just 10 people, and each one of those people

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.869
changed the lives of another 10 people, and
another 10, then in five generations—125

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.590
years—the class of 2014 will have changed
the lives of 800 million people.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.979
800 million people.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.810
Think about it: over twice the population
of the United States.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.039
Go one more generation and you can change
the entire population of the world: eight

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.970
billion people.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.650
If you think it's hard to change the lives
of 10 people—change their lives forever—you're

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.650
wrong.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.390
I saw it happen every day in Iraq and Afghanistan.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.160
A young Army officer makes a decision to go
left instead of right down a road in Baghdad,

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.490
and the 10 soldiers with him are saved from
close-in ambush.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:35.610
In Kandahar province in Afghanistan, a non-commissioned
officer from the Female Engagement Team senses

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.330
something isn't right and directs the infantry
platoon away from a 500-pound IED, saving

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.940
the lives of a dozen soldiers.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.340
But, if you think about it, not only were
these soldiers saved by the decisions of one

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.630
person, but their children were saved.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.930
And their children's children.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.400
Generations were saved by one decision, by
one person.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.100
But changing the world can happen anywhere,
and anyone can do it.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.610
So, what starts here can indeed change the
world, but the question is: What will the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.150
world look like after you change it?

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.080
Well, I am confident that it will look much,
much better.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.910
But if you will humor this old sailor for
just a moment, I have a few suggestions that

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.300
may help you on your way to a better a world.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.380
And while these lessons were learned during
my time in the military, I can assure you

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.330
that it matters not whether you ever served
a day in uniform.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.111
It matters not your gender, your ethnic or
religious background, your orientation, or

00:03:33.111 --> 00:03:34.910
your social status.

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.180
Our struggles in this world are similar, and
the lessons to overcome those struggles and

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.810
to move forward—changing ourselves and changing
the world around us—will apply equally to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:45.810
all.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.650
I have been a Navy SEAL for 36 years.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.930
But it all began when I left UT for Basic
SEAL training in Coronado, California.

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:59.210
Basic SEAL training is six months of long,
torturous runs in the soft sand, midnight

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.140
swims in the cold water off San Diego, obstacles
courses, unending calisthenics, days without

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.250
sleep and always being cold, wet and miserable.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.540
It is six months of being constantly harassed
by professionally trained warriors who seek

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:22.150
to find the weak of mind and body and eliminate
them from ever becoming a Navy SEAL.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.970
But the training also seeks to find those
students who can lead in an environment of

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.780
constant stress, chaos, failure and hardships.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.220
To me, basic SEAL training was a lifetime
of challenges crammed into six months.

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.070
So, here are the 10 lesson's I learned from
basic SEAL training that hopefully will be

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.890
of value to you as you move forward in life.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.500
Every morning in SEAL training, my instructors,
who at the time were all Viet Nam veterans,

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.590
would show up in my barracks room, and the
first thing they would inspect was my bed.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.180
If you did it right, the corners would be
square, the covers pulled tight, the pillow

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.320
centered just under the headboard and the
extra blanket folded neatly at the foot of

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.320
the rack.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.710
It was a simple task, mundane at best.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.220
But every morning we were required to make
our bed to perfection.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.510
It seemed a little ridiculous at the time,
particularly in light of the fact that were

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.220
aspiring to be real warriors, tough battle-hardened
SEALs.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:27.430
But the wisdom of this simple act has been
proven to me many times over.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.900
If you make your bed every morning you will
have accomplished the first task of the day.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.790
It will give you a small sense of pride and
it will encourage you to do another task,

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.310
and another, and another.

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.230
And by the end of the day, that one task completed
will have turned into many tasks completed.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.620
Making your bed will also reinforce the fact
that the little things in life matter.

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.680
If you can't do the little things right, you
will never be able to do the big things right.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:02.100
And, if by chance you have a miserable day,
you will come home to a bed that is made—that

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:09.240
you made—and a made bed gives you encouragement
that tomorrow will be better.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.710
If you want to change the world, start off
by making your bed.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:19.740
During SEAL training the students...during
training the student are broken down into

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.900
boat crews.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.640
Each crew is seven students—three on each
side of a small rubber boat and one coxswain

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.920
to help guide the dingy.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.760
Every day your boat crew forms up on the beach
and is instructed to get through the surf

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.940
zone and paddle several miles down the coast.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.860
In the winter, the surf off San Diego can
get to be 8 to 10 feet high and it is exceedingly

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.500
difficult to paddle through the plunging surf
unless everyone digs in.

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.389
Every paddle must be synchronized to the stroke
count of the coxswain.

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:54.930
Everyone must exert equal effort or the boat
will turn against the wave and be unceremoniously

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.639
dumped back on the beach.

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:02.540
For the boat to make it to its destination,
everyone must paddle.

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.400
You can't change the world alone—you will
need some help.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:11.520
And to truly get from your starting point
to your destination takes friends, colleagues,

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.600
the good will of strangers and a strong coxswain
to guide you.

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.910
If you want to change the world, find someone
to help you paddle.

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.250
Over a few weeks of difficult training my
SEAL class, which started with 150 men, was

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.410
down to just 42.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.660
There were now six boat crews of seven men
each.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:38.130
I was in the boat with the tall guys, but
the best boat crew we had was made up of the

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:42.919
little guys—"the munchkin crew," we called
them—no one was over five-foot-five.

00:07:42.919 --> 00:07:48.580
The munchkin boat crew had one American Indian,
one African American, one Polish America,

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.960
one Greek American, one Italian American,
and two tough kids from the Midwest.

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:57.889
They out-paddled, out-ran and out-swam all
the other boat crews.

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:04.080
The big men in the other boat crews would
always make good-natured fun of the tiny little

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:09.990
flippers the munchkins put on their tiny little
feet prior to every swim.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.640
But somehow these little guys, from every
corner of the nation and the world, always

00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:19.250
had the last laugh, swimming faster than everyone
and reaching the shore long before the rest

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.090
of us.

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.590
SEAL training was a great equalizer.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:26.300
Nothing mattered but your will to succeed.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:30.770
Not your color, not your ethnic background,
not your education and not your social status.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:35.690
If you want to change the world, measure a
person by the size of their heart, not by

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.930
the size of their flippers.

00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:44.110
Several times a week, the instructors would
line up the class and do a uniform inspection.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.510
It was exceptionally thorough.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.010
Your hat had to be perfectly starched, your
uniform immaculately pressed and your belt

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.230
buckle shiny and void of any smudges.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:57.920
But it seemed that no matter how much effort
you put into starching your hat, or pressing

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:02.520
your uniform or polishing your belt buckle,
it just wasn't good enough.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:05.380
The instructors would fine something wrong.

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:11.310
For failing the uniform inspection, the student
had to run, fully clothed into the surf zone.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.080
Then, wet from head to toe, roll around on
the beach until every part of your body was

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.830
covered with sand.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:22.320
The effect was known as "sugar cookie."

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.070
You stayed in the uniform the rest of the
day—cold, wet and sandy.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:30.920
There were many a student who just couldn't
accept the fact that all their efforts were

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:31.920
in vain.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.440
That no matter how hard they tried to get
the uniform right, it was unappreciated.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.890
Those students didn't make it through training.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:42.950
Those students didn't understand the purpose
of the drill.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:44.900
You were never going to succeed.

00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:46.770
You were never going to have a perfect uniform.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.980
The instructors weren't going to allow it.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.050
Sometimes no matter how well you prepare or
how well you perform you still end up as a

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:56.680
sugar cookie.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.370
It's just the way life is sometimes.

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:05.740
If you want to change the world, get over
being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:10.240
Every day during training you were challenged
with multiple physical events—long runs,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:15.830
long swims, obstacle courses, hours of calisthenics—something
designed to test your mettle.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.290
Every event had standards, times you had to
meet.

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:23.960
If you failed to meet those times, those standards,
your name was posted on a list and at the

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:29.290
end of the day those on the list were invited
to a "circus."

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:33.830
A circus was two hours of additional calisthenics,
designed to wear you down, to break your spirit,

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.350
to force you to quit.

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.790
No one wanted a circus.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:41.210
A circus meant that for that day you didn't
measure up.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:45.110
A circus meant more fatigue, and more fatigue
meant that the following day would be more

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.040
difficult, and more circuses were likely.

00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:55.520
But at some time during SEAL training, everyone—everyone—made
the circus list.

00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:59.970
But an interesting thing happened to those
who were constantly on the list.

00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:08.130
Over time, those students—who did two hours
of extra calisthenics—got stronger and stronger.

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:11.740
The pain of the circuses built inner strength
and physical resiliency.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.410
Life is filled with circuses.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:16.960
You will fail.

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.260
You will likely fail often.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.020
It will be painful.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:21.630
It will be discouraging.

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.400
At times it will test you to your very core.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:30.350
But if you want to change the world, don't
be afraid of the circuses.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.490
At least twice a week, the trainees were required
to run the obstacle course.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:40.110
The obstacle course contained 25 obstacles,
including a 10-foot wall, a 30-foot cargo

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.540
net and a barbed wire crawl, to name a few.

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:45.740
But the most challenging obstacle was the
slide for life.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:51.550
It had a three-level, 30-foot tower at one
end and a one-level tower at the other.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.459
In between was a 200-foot-long rope.

00:11:54.459 --> 00:12:00.060
You had to climb the three tiered tower and,
once at the top, you grabbed the rope, swung

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:05.510
underneath the rope and pulled yourself, hand
over hand, until you got to the other end.

00:12:05.510 --> 00:12:10.470
The record for the obstacle course had stood
for years when my class began in 1977.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:12.620
The record seemed unbeatable.

00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:19.010
Until one day, a student decided to go down
the slide for life head first.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.620
Instead of swinging his body underneath the
rope and inching his way down, he bravely

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.140
mounted the TOP of the rope and thrust himself
forward.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:31.080
It was a dangerous move—seemingly foolish
and fraught with risk.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.040
Failure could mean injury and being dropped
from the course.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.710
Without hesitation the student slid down the
rope perilously fast.

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:41.520
Instead of several minutes, it only took him
half that time.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:45.990
And by the end of the course he had broken
the record.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:49.970
If you want to change the world, sometimes
you have to slide down the obstacles head

00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:52.529
first.

00:12:52.529 --> 00:12:56.200
During the land warfare phase of training,
the students are flown out to San Clemente

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.050
Island, which lies off the coast of San Diego.

00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:02.589
The waters off San Clemente are a breeding
ground for the great white sharks.

00:13:02.589 --> 00:13:07.209
To pass SEAL training there are a series of
long swims that must be completed.

00:13:07.209 --> 00:13:09.110
One is the night swim.

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:15.240
Before the swim the instructors joyfully brief
the students on all the species of sharks

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.300
that inhabit the waters off San Clemente.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:24.890
They assure you, however, that no student
has ever been eaten by a shark—at least

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.170
not that they can remember.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:34.390
But, you are also taught that if a shark begins
to circle your position, stand your ground.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:36.300
Do not swim away.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.620
Do not act afraid.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:43.420
And if the shark, hungry for a midnight snack,
darts towards you, then summons up all your

00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:48.360
strength and punch him in the snout, and he
will turn and swim away.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.000
There are a lot of sharks in the world.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.269
If you hope to complete the swim you will
have to deal with them.

00:13:56.269 --> 00:14:02.769
So, if you want to change the world, don't
back down from the sharks.

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:07.670
As Navy SEALs one of our jobs is to conduct
underwater attacks against enemy shipping.

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:11.300
We practiced this technique extensively during
training.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:14.680
The ship attack mission is where a pair of
SEAL divers is dropped off outside an enemy

00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:20.899
harbor and then swims well over two miles,
under water, using nothing but a depth gauge

00:14:20.899 --> 00:14:24.240
and a compass to get to the target.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:31.420
During the entire swim, even well below the
surface, there is some light that comes through.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:36.360
It is comforting to know that there is open
water above you.

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.940
But as you approach the ship, which is tied
to a pier, the light begins to fade.

00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.150
The steel structure of the ship blocks the
moonlight.

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:47.060
It blocks the surrounding street lamps.

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:50.220
It blocks all ambient light.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.899
To be successful in your mission, you have
to swim under the ship and find the keel:

00:14:53.899 --> 00:14:56.680
the centerline and the deepest part of the
ship.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.560
This is your objective.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:02.779
But the keel is also the darkest part of the
ship—where you cannot see your hand in front

00:15:02.779 --> 00:15:08.089
of your face, where the noise from the ship's
machinery is deafening and where it get to

00:15:08.089 --> 00:15:11.730
be easily disoriented and you can fail.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:18.010
Every SEAL knows that under the keel, at the
darkest moment of the mission, is the time

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:24.550
when you need to be calm, when you must be
calm, when you must be composed, when all

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:29.550
your tactical skills, your physical power
and all your inner strength must be brought

00:15:29.550 --> 00:15:31.459
to bear.

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:38.560
If you want to change the world, you must
be your very best in the darkest moments.

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.920
The ninth week of training is referred to
as "Hell Week."

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:48.209
It is six days of no sleep, constant physical
and mental harassment and one special day

00:15:48.209 --> 00:15:49.910
at the Mud Flats.

00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:54.589
The Mud Flats are area between San Diego and
Tijuana where the water runs off and creates

00:15:54.589 --> 00:16:00.250
the Tijuana slues, a swampy patch of terrain
where the mud will engulf you.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:04.620
It is on Wednesday of Hell Week that you paddle
down to the mud flats and spend the next 15

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:09.910
hours trying to survive the freezing cold,
the howling wind and the incessant pressure

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:12.650
to quit from the instructors.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:18.450
As the sun began to set that Wednesday evening,
my training class, having committed some "egregious

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:22.589
infraction of the rules," was ordered into
the mud.

00:16:22.589 --> 00:16:27.750
The mud consumed each man 'til there was nothing
visible but our heads.

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:32.920
The instructors told us we could leave the
mud if only five men would quit—only five

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.810
men, just five men and we could get out of
the oppressive cold.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:42.029
Looking around the mud flat it was apparent
that some students were about to give up.

00:16:42.029 --> 00:16:47.570
It was still over eight hours till the sun
came up, eight more hours of bone chilling

00:16:47.570 --> 00:16:48.570
cold.

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:53.870
The chattering teeth and shivering moans of
the trainees were so loud it was hard to hear

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:54.870
anything.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:59.490
And then, one voice began to echo through
the night.

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:02.410
One voice raised in song.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:08.049
The song was terribly out of tune but sung
with great enthusiasm.

00:17:08.049 --> 00:17:12.740
One voice became two, and two became three,
and before long everyone in the class was

00:17:12.740 --> 00:17:13.740
singing.

00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.370
The instructors threatened us with more time
in the mud if we kept up the singing, but

00:17:17.370 --> 00:17:19.289
the singing persisted.

00:17:19.289 --> 00:17:25.059
And somehow the mud seemed a little warmer,
and the wind a little tamer and the dawn not

00:17:25.059 --> 00:17:27.049
so far away.

00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:32.989
If I have learned anything in my time traveling
the world, it is the power of hope.

00:17:32.989 --> 00:17:40.049
The power of one person—Washington, Lincoln,
King, Mandela and even a young girl from Pakistan,

00:17:40.049 --> 00:17:44.619
Malala—one person can change the world by
giving people hope.

00:17:44.619 --> 00:17:50.100
So, if you want to change the world, start
singing when you're up to your neck in mud.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.730
Finally, in SEAL training there is a bell.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:18:01.200
A brass bell that hangs in the center of the
compound for all the students to see.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:04.750
All you have to do to quit is ring the bell.

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.980
Ring the bell and you no longer have to wake
up at 5 o'clock.

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.720
Ring the bell and you no longer have to be
in the freezing cold swims.

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.630
Ring the bell and you no longer have to do
the runs, the obstacle course, the PT, and

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:22.720
you no longer have to endure the hardships
of training.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.340
All you have to do is ring the bell to get
out.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:32.279
If you want to change the world don't ever,
ever ring the bell.

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:37.289
To the class of 2014, you are moments away
from graduating.

00:18:37.289 --> 00:18:40.239
Moments away from beginning your journey through
life.

00:18:40.239 --> 00:18:43.879
Moments away from starting to change the world
for the better.

00:18:43.879 --> 00:18:45.110
It will not be easy.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:50.179
But, YOU are the class of 2014—the class
that can affect the lives of 800 million people

00:18:50.179 --> 00:18:51.769
in the next century.

00:18:51.769 --> 00:18:54.360
Start each day with a task completed.

00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.879
Find someone to help you through life.

00:18:55.879 --> 00:18:57.080
Respect everyone.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:02.760
Know that life is not fair and that you will
fail often, but if take you take some risks,

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:06.929
step up when the times are toughest, face
down the bullies, lift up the downtrodden

00:19:06.929 --> 00:19:13.210
and never, ever give up—if you do these
things, the next generation and the generations

00:19:13.210 --> 00:19:18.070
that follow will live in a world far better
than the one we have today, and what started

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:23.279
here will indeed have changed the world—for
the better.

00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:24.570
Thank you very much.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:26.669
Hook 'em horns.
