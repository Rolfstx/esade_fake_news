00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.749
What's it like when one of your friends on death row is led away to be executed

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:29.749
Well, you spend you know years years and months and months and hours of every day with a person, you talk every day

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.319
"Hey, what are you doing?" And you know, "Let's eat something. Let's make something to eat"

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.329
And you know and he eventually comes by one day and like I got to go man and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.159
And you know when he leaves and turns his back and walks down them steps. He ain't coming back

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.180
They're gonna kill um

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.459
About an hour's drive south of Chicago in the state of Indiana is one of America's oldest and most notorious

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.130
maximum-security prisons

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.220
The majority of the 1900 inmates here are serving long sentences for unspeakable crimes

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.040
And when I came at you, I wasn't just gonna stick you an inch I was gonna run something all the way through you.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.860
Twelve are due to be executed on the orders of the state

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.160
For two weeks I was given privileged access to this dark and forbidding world.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.960
I do deserve to be executed bottom line. I ain't gonna candy-coat it. I deserve to be executed

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.439
Welcome to Indiana's state prison

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.940
[Door buzzes open]

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.240
My introduction to the prison was dramatic. The man who runs it: Superintendent Bill Wilson

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.760
Agreed to take me to death row

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.700
So this is actually the entrance?

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.320
This is the actual entrance then, and it's uh, 2 floors.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.020
We only have 12 men on on the row right now

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.719
You  have to sign yourself in?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.560
The superintendent comes to death row every week to check on how the inmates are coping

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.469
Superintendent these the pictures of people on death row, correct?

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.180
These are the twelve gentlemen that are on death row and shows their cell locations

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:53.329
So that staff never have to question where they're at. No staff members are allowed on the unit when the offenders are out

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.140
So the offenders actually will secure themselves in the cells

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.600
And then their cell doors will be closed or opened as they need to come in or out.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.540
Do you like any of these people?

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.920
like?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.890
Umm...

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.200
they're all they're all different in many ways and I...

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.460
Am respectful of who they are, what they are.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.680
Would I call them my friends?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.520
No but there are some characters here that have some personality characteristics that you would say are likable.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.040
He knows them all by name and they know him

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.960
McManus it always amazes me how clean that cell is. Keep it up.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:36.800
Got a lot of time in here.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.460
I know.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.460
Hello

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.540
Stayin' out of trouble?

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.040
Yeah

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.600
Alright

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.500
Wilkes, how's your eyes?

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.329
You've been over to medical at all?

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:48.829
Yeah.

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:49.329
Okay.

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.520
Oh Maura, how are you?

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.560
Just one second

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.560
How you been?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.642
Im alright you?

00:04:01.642 --> 00:04:03.140
I'm doin' alright.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.960
How you doin'?

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.820
Hi

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.640
Is tension high?

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.080
Not for me.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.940
Okay

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.820
Im good.

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.280
Alright.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.540
Ritchie.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.560
Wussup?

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.240
Alright

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.740
What's all this?

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.926
Mr. Ritchie's wife, i believe is from England.

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:19.280
Which part of England is she from.

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.380
St. Albans

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.600
Uh-huh in Hertfordshire?

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:23.260
Yup

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.520
Yeah, I met her about 4 years ago. Pen pal.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.560
And we hit it off instantly.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.320
and uh...

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.389
She came over visited couldn't get enough and married me

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.880
How often do you get a chance to see her?

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:39.140
Every weekend

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.820
Do you mind do you mind doing this? Oh, no. No, not at all. Yes.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.280
It is very very unconventional though because

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.300
the endgame in this relationship is one that you know, and she knows.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.790
well

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.960
Yeah, kind of cuz a lot of guys

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:04.360
Can get off death row. A lot of us are getting off death row. But cases like mine and like another gentleman back here

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.729
You know, but we didn't kill no women or kids

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:15.340
We were charged with shooting a cop a police officer and they just don't like guys like us no matter if you've got good

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.920
Issues in your case or not. Legal issues to let you all to let you off death row. It doesn't matter, you know what I mean?

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.640
She knows that and she married you.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:24.580
I know.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.060
I found something now, see.

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.670
I was a stupid kid at 19 and 20. I made very poor decisions. I would make decisions

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:40.969
I would do things without thinking about them and I didn't give a damn about the consequence at all

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.430
That kid to me now

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.580
32 years old that kids gone

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.760
I'm not saying I'm rehabilitated, you know.

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.740
You're not saying that?

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:52.120
No, I'm not.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:53.820
Why not?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.280
Because I'd be bullshitting you. I'm not gonna sit here and lie to you.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.080
I'm the kind of guy that does need to be in prison

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.440
Why are you the kind of guy who needs to be in prison?

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.680
Because only kind of guy if I get fired from a job and I can't find a job

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.769
I'll do it the legal way try to get a job and I can't find a job

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.480
And I can't pay my bills. I'll go get a gun and I'll pay my bills.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.199
And I won't think nothing about it; it won't bother me at all

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:22.040
you've described the person you are but

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.580
How do you see your life looking down the line? Where does it where does it go? Where does it end up?

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.960
Man...

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.100
Either in a box or doin' a life sentence in population

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.669
That's my choices right there. Doin' a life sentence or being in a box.

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.740
And I gotta watch my wife grow old through these bars.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:08.660
Out in the general population, convicts are allowed yard time: two hours recreation every day

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:16.290
Save for taking showers and meals, this is their only opportunity to mix and to make allies.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.680
Have you been here a long time?

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.750
27 years. How many? 27 years.

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:43.908
I was heading to the administrative segregation unit with lieutenant, Gillespie

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:49.278
The men here are among the prison's most dangerous

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:55.098
This is sergeant Fagan this is his unit

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:11.499
Many of the offender's here are gang members drug dealers and sexual predators

00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:16.869
Everything they do is monitored and carefully controlled

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.080
Could you tell me what this list of names is all about?

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:30.160
This, every cell house in Indiana state prison has one of these. The idea behind this is to make sure we know where everyone's at,

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.200
what they're doing, who they are

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:40.050
why they're here, etc. For example, if someone would accidentally take out 508 and

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.479
509 together and let's say they you know, 508 owes 509 money

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.219
so 509 is mad about it and they get put in the shower together and the doors locked,

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.440
and he has a weapon on him

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.080
508 could lose his life

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:00.390
Like that, you know just because someone made that mistake, so that's why it's important to really understand this board

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.960
Do you feel that you must be constantly vigilant?

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.380
These guys have nothing but time. Okay. We're going home

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.700
So we're thinking about going to dinner with the wife going to dinner with the mom whatever, you know

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:17.220
These guys have nothing but time; they're sitting here, you know, and these guys they're smart. They don't forget.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:21.120
So let's say you made um mad 2 weeks ago. You forgot all about it

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.880
They don't. So let's say you're sitting here minding your business doing something come up behind you and assault you

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.120
Yeah, you gotta be awake. You got to be on your toes.

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.019
The offenders in this unit are locked down for 23 hours a day.

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:48.939
And when they're allowed out for their 60-minute break, they're kept apart in individual steel cages.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:59.769
One of the men is 38 year old Ronald L. Sanford

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.680
By any measure, and in any prison community his is an exceptional story

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:25.260
When did you come here? To Indiana state prison?

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.520
Well I came here in 1989 at the age of 15 years old

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.860
I was actually convicted of the crime that I'm here for at the age of 13 years old.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.240
And what was the crime?

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:36.360
Double homicide

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:44.700
So I committed a double homicide at the age of 13 years old. At the age of 15 my case had ran it's course through the court

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.440
And I was sent here to this prison in 1989.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.500
Double homicide at the age of 13

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.070
13 yes sir

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.160
That's very very young

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:01.260
It's tragic to say the least and it is very young. Absolutely. It's uh, it's unheard of

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.579
Wow

00:11:05.579 --> 00:11:07.819
It's unspeakable to say the least

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:11.659
Even reflecting upon it almost 25 years later

00:11:12.209 --> 00:11:17.389
And all this had to be 25 years since that crime took place. It's still very vivid

00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:21.660
it's still very poignant and still resonates and it still has the same amount of

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.400
Tragic elements involved in it now as it did then and it will always be with me for the rest of my life always says

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:29.600
I always say it's like an Albatros around my neck

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.949
No matter where I go or what I do, for the rest of my life. It'll always be with me

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:40.429
What were the circumstances which led up to the incident which led you in prison at the age of 15?

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.599
me and a friend had basically planned to get money to go to a fair

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.810
and to do so we were gonna cut grass

00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:53.180
We went to a home basically and they said they didn't want their grass cut,

00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:59.119
and rather than continue on the vein and go to the next home, we decided to push into the home essentially and it ended in a double homicide.

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:05.400
It's that simple. And I'm complicit in that crime. I was sentenced to 170 years. One, seven 0

00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.269
You've got a sentence of a hundred and seventy years.

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:11.180
However, you cut that

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:15.640
You are not going to get out of here.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.940
I'm eligible for parole when I turn 100 years old

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:21.469
Have you ever thought about all the things that

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.570
You have missed that other 15 year-olds go through as part of their normal lives

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:33.649
Absolutely. I've never been to the prom. I've never driven a car. I've never had a driver's license. I'm never filed tax returns

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.149
I've never been on the airplane. I've never traveled abroad

00:12:40.379 --> 00:12:42.240
Should I continue

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.879
My life has been living in this prison and it seems as though I've been in this prison so long I've never been free

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:50.179
25 years in prison, you know, it's a long time

00:12:52.319 --> 00:12:55.486
Especially when you come in at the age of 15.

00:12:55.486 --> 00:12:57.949
Thank you so much for talking to me

00:12:57.949 --> 00:12:59.949
Thank you for taking the time. I appreciate you

00:13:06.010 --> 00:13:13.979
My first meeting with Sanford was a shock but there were more disturbing cases at Indiana's state prison

00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:49.700
One of the oddities of the American prison system is that an inmate can spend 20 years on death row

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.149
Exhausting the appeals process before he's executed

00:13:54.630 --> 00:14:01.259
In all that time convicts are confined to this cellblock and have little contact with the rest of the prison

00:14:02.769 --> 00:14:06.209
Paul McManus killed his wife and two young daughters

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.120
It's not bad, it's the first thing I noticed about your cell, that it's

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:15.380
Terribly clean very different from any of the others. Why is that?

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.620
I feel if I don't use it in a month, then I probably don't need it

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.009
Yeah, but it's it's it's more than that, isn't it? It's it's

00:14:23.769 --> 00:14:25.220
Particularly clean.

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:27.839
Well me personally I don't read or write

00:14:27.839 --> 00:14:32.369
So I have a lot of time on my hands so so I clean because I don't write letters. I don't read books

00:14:32.709 --> 00:14:36.239
There's only so much on TV. You can watch before the show repeats

00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:39.898
So it gives me a lot of time so I just take pride in cleaning my cell

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:46.060
Was your life before you came to prison very similar? Were you a very tidy person then?

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:49.760
Not so much. I worked a lot so I was always busy. So I like to stay busy. It keeps my mind

00:14:51.579 --> 00:14:56.339
It works both ways, I guess, you know, I keep busy in here, but I've pretty well done

00:14:56.339 --> 00:14:57.269
All I can do in here

00:14:57.269 --> 00:15:00.899
I might have to move to a different cell and do the same thing, but I've been here over a decade

00:15:01.029 --> 00:15:04.380
so I'm just now getting it where I like it.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:05.818
Does being on death row take

00:15:06.399 --> 00:15:08.250
a physical emotional toll on you.

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.989
Oh, it's definitely up and down

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.699
Definitely. Now I did weigh 250 pounds

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:23.189
Almost two years ago and now I weigh 166. I have pictures of them if you would like to see them

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.980
I got him right here in my pack

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.240
Yes

00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.560
And you see the difference.

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:31.920
So this is umm..

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:33.700
It's all me.

00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:35.460
So you lost a lot of weight.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.860
Right.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.040
You know, it's depression a little bit

00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:44.160
you know, and it's also just

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.579
Like I said it's a roller coaster; it's up and down

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:06.520
McManus sees more of Indiana State Prison than the other men on death row

00:16:07.889 --> 00:16:12.229
He's a diabetic and is allowed a daily visit to the prison hospital

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:20.178
The authorities must treat him although they will in all probability put him to death one day

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:33.720
Well here we are out of death row and into the sunlight, is this the only chance you get to

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.220
mix with the rest of the

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.169
General prison population. Yes, we don't have a lot of contact with them

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.440
so it is nice to be able to come out and see people that you've

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.650
Maybe been in locked up with that are not on the row no more

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:49.090
And every once in a while

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:52.019
You can you know have a little bit of contact with that person

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:53.841
Just for a brief second.

00:16:53.841 --> 00:16:57.380
Were you on any kind of medication like insulin before you came to prison

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.960
No I was not, absolutely none, zip

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:03.419
Now, you know I take quite a few pills

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.120
and the insulin shot

00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:09.420
It all comes down to the food

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:14.069
And also how you have your ups and downs where you gain weight and then stuff like that

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:16.060
So, I mean that does play a factor

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:30.420
Well, here's a nice thing about being a diabetic is that you do get to get out and

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:34.900
Come over to the hospital daily and then to be around regular people. It's nice.

00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.420
Yeah.

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:43.640
Alright.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.484
Alright, thank you

00:17:44.484 --> 00:17:45.140
See you later

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:06.919
The rest of the prison is distinctly different from the oppressive gloom of death row

00:18:12.379 --> 00:18:18.429
Lunch time in cellblock C prisoners have a chance to spend time in the open air

00:18:26.059 --> 00:18:32.678
They can also earn privileges some have jobs and can request a haircut twice a month

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.399
All the barbers are convicts

00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:45.609
Rick Parish is serving three life sentences

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:47.870
plus ten years

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:53.949
I must say walking into this place is one of the most extraordinary experiences I've had for a long time

00:18:53.950 --> 00:18:55.950
you wouldn't have thought that this was a

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.390
barbershop or in a maximum-security prison

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.869
Well, we we work hard to keep it unique

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:08.170
In here because we like the atmosphere. We like being able to come in here and relax

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:11.619
It's neutral territory for gangs for officers

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:14.770
I mean if you come to the barbershop and you're a gang member

00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:18.759
Would you start trouble with the guy that's standing here with a pair shears in his hand like this?

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.458
I know I wouldn't I suspect not to.

00:19:21.458 --> 00:19:24.310
That's why there's no trouble in here

00:19:24.310 --> 00:19:28.029
Theres still though this feeling of unreality about

00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:30.610
people with instruments like these

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:36.729
In a maximum-security prison, I've been here 37 years. We've never had an incident in barber shop

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:41.260
We've never had an incident with the shears. Never had a problem. You've been here since the 70s

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:44.040
That's a long time January 75.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.033
Long time.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:45.540
Yeah, yup

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:50.780
Well, you know if you do it a day at a time like most of us, do. You do a day at a time, day at a time

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.420
Sometimes an hour of time sometimes a minute at a time whatever it takes to get through

00:19:57.399 --> 00:20:00.508
Then you look up one day and 37 years went by

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:07.040
There ya go young man. You have a good day.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.490
Alright, thank you

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.000
Rick what are we looking at here?

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.920
A little history of the penitentiary in the barber shop.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.460
the shop was remodeled in August of 76 and that's the first picture

00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.720
taken in this shop

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.680
Is that you that you there?

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:24.380
yes, it is.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:25.780
So this is your wall.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.790
Yeah, I'm I'm all over the wall cuz it is my wall and this...

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:32.360
You're pumping iron here?

00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:33.240
Yeah, that was

00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:35.789
Probably 20 years ago

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:37.779
when I was

00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.240
Eating anything that didn't move and pumping iron at the same time.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.880
So this is

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.842
a catalogue of your life in pictures.

00:20:45.842 --> 00:20:48.260
Yeah. Cuz you can see the progress

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:53.900
from what I looked like in 76 up here, to where I'm at  right now

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.883
Here, that's the newest picture.

00:20:57.883 --> 00:21:01.740
What emotions do they invoke?

00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.460
Wishing I was out there doing it, right

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:09.209
wishing I could start all over again at

00:21:11.529 --> 00:21:14.819
29 30 years of age and not make the mistakes I made

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.129
But you get past after 37 years, you better be past all that

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:22.860
You know have your head screwed on?

00:21:23.649 --> 00:21:25.470
You know

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.240
Make the best of what you have.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.609
But the pictures are constant reminders

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:31.430
yeah, of what was

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.410
You know that's like, you know, all of us that got here were violent criminals to get here

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.700
What was your violent crime, Rick? I'm in here for kidnap/robbery.

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:41.720
I pulled a robbery

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:48.680
And the car I had wouldn't start. So I commandeered a vehicle and there was 3 people in it

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.009
All the pictures here you have it on

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:57.080
Mounted on cardboard. Yeah, it's on cardboard. So if I ever get out I can take it with me

00:21:58.170 --> 00:22:03.800
That's what it's for. I'll fold it up and take it with me as a reminder.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:06.650
You don't want to go back

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:56.370
I went back to the administrative segregation unit to see Ronald L. Sanford again.

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.180
His story haunted me. A killer when he'd barely entered his teens

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:08.540
Hello, how are you doing?

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:09.600
Hello, hi.

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.040
How are you doing?

00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:11.840
I'm alright myself.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:12.620
Good

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.700
How do you get accustomed to

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:25.700
life in this environment.

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.879
It takes some getting used to

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:32.789
It's tough. There's was a young man on a range, very young man. Maybe 19 20 years old. He's

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:38.879
Exhibiting psychosis. They took him to see  the psychologist because he's having trouble adapting

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.269
This is an abnormal environment for a human being certainly, you know

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:47.820
These are essentially cages and I think that we stay in 24 hour 23 hours a day come out for an hour a day

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:50.400
It's taxing.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.340
May I have a look in your cell?

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.320
Absolutely.

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.700
Have a look at some of the books?

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.380
Absolutely.You absolutely may, sir.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.080
Lieutenant, would you mind opening up?

00:23:59.080 --> 00:23:59.580
Sure

00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.340
I'd just like to have a look.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.060
Yes sir, you could you can take whatever down you want to take down

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.899
War against the weak. What was that about?

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:15.070
Eugenics

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:18.599
Eugenics. Yes, sir. America's attempt to make a master race, essentially

00:24:19.539 --> 00:24:22.320
And this one is the tree of life, whats that about?

00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:24.179
It's Kabbalah actually, it was more

00:24:25.659 --> 00:24:27.659
metaphysics essentially

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:33.659
Those those deep questions about man where it comes from where we're going and who we are essentially. Yes

00:24:33.659 --> 00:24:39.449
I see that you have in addition to your books. You have some of your own writing on the wall that says strength

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:42.479
Well-being and health.

00:24:43.119 --> 00:24:45.119
Yes, just something I try to focus on

00:24:45.219 --> 00:24:52.319
if there's anything I want to state my mind on, as I always say it's something progressive so being strong and having a

00:24:52.659 --> 00:24:57.691
Good disposition and being in good health or certain things are definitely more to uh, focus on.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.940
And you have written here

00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:03.140
No, no, man is your enemy. No, man is your friend...

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.580
every man is your teacher. [said in unisons]

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.180
Yes, sir.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.280
I'm also standing here and I think

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.860
these are the parameters of your

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.020
of your existence.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:14.429
Absolutely these four walls

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:17.440
It's a pretty isolating place.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.619
It really is if you see it as such.

00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:24.778
Its isolated only to the extent that you think it is, you know

00:25:24.779 --> 00:25:31.648
I mean those books allow for a great escape and to be able to leave the confines of the world, so

00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:38.280
But I'm only in here for a few minutes and I feel it as such. I feel the isolation.

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:42.060
everybody in this building feels the

00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:45.029
confinement that were suffering here.

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:50.059
You know, you put an animal in a cage for too great of a time, it goes crazy

00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:52.059
You know how much more so humans?

00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:17.289
This is what Sanford looked like when he came here at the tender age of 15

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:29.830
His murder of two elderly women in 1987 netted him the meager sum of $5

00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:38.240
On that vile act he must reflect for the rest of his life

00:27:04.359 --> 00:27:09.989
Prison life moves to the relentless and monotonous beat of an unchanging routine

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:26.530
Some inmates get the chance to relieve the tedium by working

00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:34.919
At the end of his shift Rick Perish the barber returns to what's called an honor cell

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:38.518
to which only the most trusted prisoners are assigned

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.420
And they're all two-man cells?

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.020
two man-cells

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.880
This is my cell here

00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.700
Rick, who opens the doors? Is that controlled...

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:56.740
By the computer. Up in the office area theres a computer controls all the doors controls our water

00:27:57.159 --> 00:27:58.940
May I? Come into your cell?

00:27:58.940 --> 00:27:59.969
Sure, please.

00:27:59.969 --> 00:28:01.000
Thank you.

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:05.100
And this is your cellmate? Hi Mike, I'm Trevor McDonald.

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.180
Nice to meet you, how you doin?

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:10.140
How long have you been sharing a cell with Rick, here?

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.300
Oh, about two and a half years. Isn't that about right Rick?

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:14.087
That's correct.

00:28:14.087 --> 00:28:15.660
So, but which is your side?

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.220
Oh, this is your side?

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:20.309
it strikes me too that there has to be a

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:23.009
rather clear division of what's

00:28:23.830 --> 00:28:27.300
Yours and what's Mike's.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.379
That's Mike's cabinet over there

00:28:28.379 --> 00:28:31.619
Yeah, and he has all his commissary and stuff in there

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:35.129
this is my cabinet here and I have my

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:39.629
Commissary and things in here but in general, were sharing space

00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:45.179
We have to try to give the other person their privacy if he's doing something and he's up walking around

00:28:45.179 --> 00:28:50.139
I try to stay over there and he does the same for me, you know, just you know

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:54.069
Try to take turns doing things because it is close quarters.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:58.277
So, this is an improvement from any other part of the prison.

00:28:58.277 --> 00:29:00.819
You've been you've been in regular cell house

00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.280
You've seen how they live over there

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:05.420
You've heard the noise?

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.400
You hear how quiet it is.

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.429
It stays quiet like this most times

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:15.459
And sure you have to put up with another human being but it's worth it. It's worth the sacrifice

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.510
Rick's honor cell does not insulate him from one stark reality

00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:25.150
Death row is within shouting distance

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.760
In the same block

00:29:29.769 --> 00:29:31.769
What is it like to live

00:29:32.049 --> 00:29:35.040
So close to death row.

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:37.978
Well, I just block it out. I don't pay any attention to it

00:29:38.079 --> 00:29:42.359
I'm a barber and I won't even go there and cut hair because I don't want to get to know any of um

00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.450
You know you lose enough friends

00:29:45.849 --> 00:29:47.999
through attrition in here as it is, about

00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:50.909
Them being on death row

00:29:51.179 --> 00:29:53.179
I don't even wanna get familiar with um.

00:29:54.309 --> 00:29:56.668
Why don't you want to get familiar with them?

00:29:57.669 --> 00:30:01.978
Because you get friendly with them you get to know them they get executed

00:30:02.049 --> 00:30:05.260
You know, you've lost another friend.

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.508
Does the mood change perceptibly?

00:30:07.299 --> 00:30:08.799
just

00:30:08.799 --> 00:30:11.429
before an execution in the days before an execution

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:15.868
Yeah, it gets even quieter, you know everybody knows

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:22.889
Last one I think was Wiggles. He stopped here powered down through there. "I'll see you fellas"

00:30:24.429 --> 00:30:25.780
He said that?

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.160
yeah, he hollered out.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.940
Everybody is usually awake

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:31.750
we used to

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:33.933
Midnight. We used to beat on the bars.

00:30:33.933 --> 00:30:36.059
And how many times has that happened?

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.480
Since you've been how many excecutions have there been since you've been here?

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.380
I've never kept track

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.200
Like I said, I try not to dwell on

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:48.269
Keeping track of them, there be too many as far as I'm concerned.

00:30:54.639 --> 00:30:58.289
Rick Parrish says he's never kept track of the number of executions

00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.210
Someone on death row obviously has

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:18.890
Every one of the 12 men on death row will one day be told the date and time of his execution

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:34.940
That common fate inspires unusual friendships

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:51.060
John Stevenson was a member of an organized criminal gang. He assassinated three people

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:57.060
Benjamin Ritchie who I've met before killed a police officer

00:31:58.140 --> 00:31:59.220
Hi, how you doing?

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.300
Pretty good man, you down alright?

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:01.300
Yeah, good to see you.

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:02.640
How you doin?

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:04.420
Good to see you. Good.

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.420
you two are in adjoining cells. How long have you been friends?

00:32:08.420 --> 00:32:13.400
About eleven years, since I got here on death row. He was already here when I got here

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:18.388
How did this friendship come about what what drew you to each other as friends?

00:32:19.929 --> 00:32:26.369
Well, just we got the same interests, I mean we play our music loud we play video games

00:32:26.369 --> 00:32:29.360
We work out play basketball eat together.

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.100
if shit goes down, we whoop a motherfuckers ass together

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.180
You know, that's how our friendship came about.

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.680
Does that mean you have a lot in common?

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.180
Yeah, well I thought we did

00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.580
You're not sure anymore.

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.020
No. No, I'm just I'm just kidding.

00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:46.280
I don't want you two friends to argue about that

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:46.960
Nah, were not going to argue

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:47.460
AW, hell nah.

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:52.019
I mean if anything we always argued, but we've never come to blows over nothing

00:32:52.019 --> 00:32:53.080
No, never.

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.619
Well be like " fuck you, fuck you" and then half hour later, "hey what we eating tonight?" You know, it's over. Yeah, don't matter don't mean nothing

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:01.830
I'm always right in the end, so

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:03.300
Get the fuck outta here

00:33:03.639 --> 00:33:07.220
He's the voice of reason you're the voice of anger from what you've said.

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:07.934
Absolutely yeah.

00:33:07.934 --> 00:33:08.559
Is that right?

00:33:08.559 --> 00:33:09.809
He keeps a leash on me. Yeah

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:17.429
Like I'd rather lash out at someone, like when I first met Bowen and he hated me because I was just a straight-up asshole

00:33:17.429 --> 00:33:23.939
I be in your face. Fuck you, you know come on in the shower and let's fight and I calmed way down since then

00:33:24.429 --> 00:33:30.028
Yeah, most of the police couldn't stand my ass and I got allowed around older cats and they calmed me down

00:33:30.909 --> 00:33:36.506
From your point of view. What's this friendship based on we heard from Richie what he thought about it.

00:33:36.506 --> 00:33:37.919
Trusting in each other

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.020
Basically that it, you know, trust

00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:46.900
like if shit goes down I got his back. He's got mine

00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:50.760
See that's why they moved us cuz he got into it with a dude up here

00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:55.829
in here and uh almost killed him the police had to come in and stop it and

00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.520
After they broke it up and everything

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:04.110
Administration got wind that I was gonna try to kill the dude because he cut my buddy with a knife

00:34:04.390 --> 00:34:09.300
And so they moved me and my buddy, Tex here to the back and moved dude up in the front by hisself

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:13.620
So nobody can get to the dude within the first two weeks of being on death row

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:16.859
I watched a man get murdered in front of me get stabbed there 42 times

00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:20.700
dispatched instantly and that was my

00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:23.080
Wake up to death row

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:27.779
Like if you come here you want to be a bully you want to take shit from people

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.870
This is what's gonna happen to you

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:33.450
Dude was just butchered

00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.159
Although you witnessed something so horrendous

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:43.400
You still sound pretty angry.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.319
But see here's the thing if you show any sign of weakness in here

00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:49.020
the Sharks will circle

00:34:49.419 --> 00:34:51.419
I won't be a victim

00:34:53.110 --> 00:34:54.930
I'll be one of the Sharks.

00:34:54.930 --> 00:34:58.149
I think the Sharks are gonna circle regardless

00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:49.300
The average sentence at Indiana State Prison is 52 years.

00:35:50.869 --> 00:35:53.529
In Britain that might seem like two life sentences

00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:58.809
But it's infinitely preferable to having an execution order hanging over your head

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.480
Hello

00:36:04.130 --> 00:36:10.059
Lieutenant Bowen has taken me to E block to meet one prisoner who has escaped the death penalty

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:15.049
Sup Harrison, how you doing

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.440
Pretty good

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:19.220
Trevor this is a offender Harrison. I've known

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:26.689
Offender Harris for probably around six years. I knew him here and also he was on death row before

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.799
How was it that you managed to move from death row?

00:36:32.280 --> 00:36:37.489
which is not a particularly pleasant environment, to this which is comparatively

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.700
Much more pleasant.

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.910
The court ordered me a new trial and they gave me years instead of the death penalty

00:36:45.999 --> 00:36:47.999
How did you get that new trial

00:36:48.249 --> 00:36:50.488
Judge that was in my trial was biased

00:36:51.219 --> 00:36:58.319
So they ordered a new trial and instead of taking the whole thing, I just went ahead and took the deal which was 150 years

00:36:59.499 --> 00:37:00.623
150 years?

00:37:00.623 --> 00:37:02.309
A long time isn't it?

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:07.079
That's a very very long time indeed. In other words. I'll die in here

00:37:08.499 --> 00:37:12.539
No way I can make out no way. I'm 62 now

00:37:13.269 --> 00:37:15.269
My out date is 66

00:37:15.759 --> 00:37:19.139
So there's just no way in the world. I can I can make it out

00:37:19.209 --> 00:37:23.789
there are people who might think that there's not a lot of difference between being on death row and

00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:26.859
having been given

00:37:26.859 --> 00:37:29.338
150 years at the age of 62

00:37:30.579 --> 00:37:34.288
It was like you said there's still hope there. There's no hope on death row

00:37:35.529 --> 00:37:37.529
Once they put you to death, that's it

00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:39.729
There's no more

00:37:39.729 --> 00:37:44.789
Wondering what's gonna happen. There's no more trying to work your way out of it. There's no more. There's nothing

00:37:45.579 --> 00:37:47.669
Still in a way a kind of death sentence

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.089
I is a death sentence

00:37:49.089 --> 00:37:53.968
but you've got a lot more freedom out here and you might as well take the freedom and

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.410
Live your life out here and having a job and being able to work

00:37:58.539 --> 00:38:03.899
And go to chow hall and go to the chapel and do that, then to sit up there and just wait to die

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:06.101
How long were you on death row?

00:38:06.101 --> 00:38:07.379
18 and a half years.

00:38:09.249 --> 00:38:14.789
What was it like to spend so long knowing that you faced execution

00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:18.750
Very very hard

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:19.860
very hard

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:25.789
It's hard to do it up on x-row sitting there waiting for your last meal, your last day

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.780
Not knowing when it's gonna come.

00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:30.180
Why were you on death row?

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.340
They said I killed three people

00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:35.900
That's what I was up there for.

00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:38.920
You would probably have been executed.

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.899
Executed yeah

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.260
Had a date been set for that?

00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:45.560
Yes, I had about two months. That was a pretty close run thing

00:38:47.260 --> 00:38:53.980
What was that moment like for you when you heard that you had avoided execution?

00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:57.260
It was a great moment. was a great moment.

00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:02.820
Even though I still got a lot of time to do like you said where theres life there's hope

00:39:19.830 --> 00:39:23.959
As he said James Harrison will not leave this prison alive

00:39:24.930 --> 00:39:29.480
But he knows he'll never be strapped to a gurney and given the lethal injection

00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.300
Just after midnight

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:39.409
Like most of the inmates, Harrison now enjoys the strange freedom

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:43.219
Of not knowing the date and time of his death

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:58.159
Before leaving the prison at the end of my first week I asked to see Benjamin Ritchie again

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:02.719
But this time face to face

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:11.980
In the year 2000 he shot and killed a policeman

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.329
At the time, Ritchie was on parole for burglary

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:34.889
With less of the bravado he showed in the company of his friend. I wanted to hear his view of his life and his crime

00:40:36.039 --> 00:40:38.489
talk me through the incident which

00:40:39.369 --> 00:40:41.680
Led you to be here.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.048
Well, my crime is

00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:47.660
shooting a police officer, and killing him

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.020
And, uh

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:50.780
It started off

00:40:50.789 --> 00:40:53.729
You know pretty harmless as a theft crime

00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:58.319
Me and my friends would ride around and carjack people and take their rims from their cars from them

00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:00.369
and

00:41:00.369 --> 00:41:03.058
My buddy's car was already full. So I

00:41:03.579 --> 00:41:07.229
Decided let's get a van or a truck and we fill it up with some rims and take it back

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:09.530
and we can go sell everything

00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:14.999
I got in a high-speed chase and wrecked into a house and jumped out and took off running

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:19.829
I was trying to get away, you know, but the cop was young and he was on my ass

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.100
and

00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:27.600
I thought maybe if I you know, take my gun out and fired a couple times

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.839
It'd scare him because you know, he's a Beachborough police officer. It's kind of a good neighborhood

00:41:33.839 --> 00:41:37.469
Like how many times has he been shot at, you know, you know if that bullet would have hit

00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:43.470
Just less than half of an inch lower he'd be alive today

00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:48.838
And I'd probably have a long lengthy prison sentence, but I wouldn't be on death row man

00:41:49.779 --> 00:41:51.989
How were you apprehended? How were you caught

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.839
well, I actually got away

00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:01.379
I made it back actually a few blocks away to some family's house and a girl I was seeing and got away

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:07.889
And I didn't know I killed him until I got back to the house and seen it on the news and that just destroyed me

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:12.960
I knew I hit him in the backyard, but I didn't know he was dead, right? I fell asleep

00:42:13.869 --> 00:42:17.249
Next thing I know I wake up. My buddy says they're outside.

00:42:18.039 --> 00:42:18.569
I wake up

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:24.119
And it was like in the movies you see a whole bunch of red dots for their guns going in and out the windows

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.909
And I was like, yeah, it's bad man. I told him go ahead and go out leave the house

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:35.730
And I didn't know what I was gonna do. I didn't have no gun. I couldn't fight no more. So I just gave up

00:42:36.250 --> 00:42:39.330
What went through your mind when the court

00:42:40.150 --> 00:42:42.150
Pronounced you guilty?

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:46.469
Well, I was trying to portray a tough guy in court

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:52.830
So when they gave me the depth sentence, I laughed at him and the prosecutor told everybody that's the voice of evil

00:42:53.650 --> 00:42:55.800
Which I I would agree at the time. Yeah

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:02.609
You know, I deserved the death penalty. I was young and didn't care about anybody at all, but myself

00:43:03.730 --> 00:43:08.490
Or anything. And uh, I deserve that I deserved that sentence at the time

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.780
and

00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.109
Yeah, I just pretty much laughed at him when they gave it to me

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:17.969
but then, you know when I was by myself it really sunk in like man you

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:22.979
You're more likely gonna be executed one day and it just hit me hard, you know

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:25.679
so I put my face in my pillow and you know, I mean

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:29.010
Cried a little bit

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.439
Was it inevitable that sooner or later

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.710
You would end up in a place like this?

00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:37.649
I always knew as a kid. I'd probably end up in prison

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.740
Yeah

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:49.609
It's weird because when I was a kid I was fascinated with prison movies. Every time we'd drive by a prison

00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:54.259
I would wonder what are those guys doing? What's it like in there? What are they up to? You know what I mean?

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:57.770
Why should I care? I'm a kid. Why should I care?

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:03.080
Cuz I just always knew I was gonna end up in there because I just had a problem with the rules with

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.080
authority and

00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:08.599
As you can see I'm here because of that

00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:11.510
Because you killed the police officer

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:19.159
You face execution. If it does come to that would you face that moment with deep regret with remorse or with

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.800
defiance?

00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:31.249
I would definitely regret it and definitely have remorse

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:37.099
But I'd also have a little defiance like why are you killing me?

00:44:37.099 --> 00:44:44.329
You said killings wrong, but yet you're premeditatedly strapping me to this table and you're gonna poison me to death. You're gonna kill me

00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:47.629
and that's what I would

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:50.420
You know

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:52.430
Resent
