00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.033
Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny:
May I begin by thanking the

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:07.967
people of Ireland for their
extraordinary warmth and dignity

00:00:07.967 --> 00:00:11.100
and generosity over
the last seven days.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.734
Thank you, people of Ireland.

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:18.600
(applause)

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.200
Now, if there's anyone out there
who still doubts that

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.834
Ireland is a place where all
things are possible,

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:32.166
who still wonders if the dream
of our ancestors is alive in our

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:38.433
time, who still questions our
capacity to restore ourselves,

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:42.166
to reinvent ourselves,
and to prosper, well,

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.600
today is your answer.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:51.367
(crowd cheering)

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:57.700
Because today, on this day, the
President of the United States,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.700
Barack Obama, and his
first lady, Michele Obama,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.433
come to visit!

00:01:03.433 --> 00:01:14.066
(crowd cheering)

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:45.867
♪♪

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:49.100
Welcome, Mr.
President, and Michele.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.567
We're sure that he
believes in Ireland.

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:54.734
(crowd cheering)

00:01:54.734 --> 00:02:02.367
To make that precious connection
with his Irish family,

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:08.300
his Irish roots, as thousands
before him have done, today,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.500
the 44th American
President comes home!

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.734
(crowd cheering)

00:02:19.734 --> 00:02:26.900
When Falmouth Kearney started
out on his long Atlantic

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.433
crossing, he might have
dreamed but hardly

00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:37.133
imagined that one day, his
great-great-great-grandson

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:40.000
would return as the President
of the United States.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
(crowd cheering)

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.300
That boy said good-bye
to a ravaged island.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.567
Millions had died
or were leaving,

00:02:57.567 --> 00:03:02.700
packing their hopes and their
dreams in beside the remnants of

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.667
a life, stepping on to
ships which, for some,

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:11.000
was like stepping into space.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.633
Every one of them and all
their people are our people on

00:03:16.633 --> 00:03:19.033
(inaudible)

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:22.000
Their past is our past.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.867
Their story is our story.

00:03:25.867 --> 00:03:31.633
So this evening, my call is
directly to those

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:35.033
40 million Irish Americans.

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:39.233
And whether you're listening
and watching in New York or

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:44.033
New Haven or in San
Diego or St. Louis,

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:49.400
whether you're Irish by blood
or by marriage or by desire,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.333
we, your Irish family
are right here!

00:03:53.333 --> 00:04:03.433
(crowd cheering)

00:04:03.433 --> 00:04:08.367
We, your family, your Irish
family, are right here,

00:04:08.367 --> 00:04:19.567
to welcome you, to follow
your President home!

00:04:19.567 --> 00:04:23.800
Last week -- last week, Queen
Elizabeth came to our

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.567
shores and bowed to our dead.

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:35.834
The Irish harp glittered above
the heart of the English Queen.

00:04:35.834 --> 00:04:40.367
With pride and happiness
and two words of Irish,

00:04:40.367 --> 00:04:43.834
we closed a circle
of our history --

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:46.000
(speaking Irish Gaelic)

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.600
(crowd cheering)

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.133
Today, with President Obama,
we draw another circle,

00:04:56.133 --> 00:05:03.300
one in which we tell the world
of our unique untouchable

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:09.467
wealth, wealth that cannot be
accumulated in banks or measured

00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:14.066
by the markets or traded on
the stock exchange because it

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:21.200
remains intact and alive,
deep inside of our people,

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.500
in the heart stomping beauty
of our country and in

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.166
the transforming
currency of the Irish heart,

00:05:29.166 --> 00:05:32.033
imagination, and sole.

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:36.333
It's like the spirit of Leinster
last Saturday in Cardiff.

00:05:36.333 --> 00:05:41.967
Never give up!

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.700
Never give up!

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.400
And never say die!

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.767
This is what we call our

00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:50.467
(speaking Irish Gaelic)

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:53.200
It has sustained
us over centuries.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.967
We pass it from mother to
daughter, from father to son,

00:05:57.967 --> 00:06:01.266
in our dreams and
in our imagining,

00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:06.800
in our love for our country
and in our pride of who we are,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.367
longing to what must be and
what will be a brighter

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:19.266
and more prosperous future.

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:24.767
The President and his first lady
are an extraordinary couple.

00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:25.934
President Obama --

00:06:25.934 --> 00:06:30.934
(crowd cheering)

00:06:30.934 --> 00:06:37.000
--is part of that proud past
and part of that proud future.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.266
(crowd chanting, Obama! Obama!)

00:06:40.266 --> 00:06:47.533
In 1963, the 45th President of
the United States

00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:49.066
stirred our hearts.

00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:55.100
In 1995, the 42nd President
lifted our country's spirits.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.033
But the 44th President
is different --

00:06:59.033 --> 00:07:01.033
(crowd cheering)

00:07:01.033 --> 00:07:03.233
-- because, ladies
and gentlemen,

00:07:03.233 --> 00:07:07.900
he doesn't just speak
about the American dream,

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.600
he is the American dream!

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:14.367
(crowd cheering)

00:07:14.367 --> 00:07:18.667
And that is the American
dream come home!

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:20.333
So, ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:22.433
(speaking Irish Gaelic)

00:07:22.433 --> 00:07:26.633
let your voices be heard around
the globe as I am honored to

00:07:26.633 --> 00:07:30.233
introduce the President
of the United States,

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:35.800
Barack Obama and his
first lady, Michele Obama.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.467
Let's hear it!

00:07:37.467 --> 00:07:57.400
(crowd cheering)

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.033
The President:
Thank you!

00:07:59.033 --> 00:08:04.300
(applause)

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.734
Hello, Dublin!

00:08:05.734 --> 00:08:08.767
(applause)

00:08:08.767 --> 00:08:10.567
Hello, Ireland!

00:08:10.567 --> 00:08:13.967
(applause)

00:08:13.967 --> 00:08:15.934
My name is Barack Obama --

00:08:15.934 --> 00:08:18.967
(applause)

00:08:18.967 --> 00:08:21.467
--of the Moneygall Obamas.

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:24.567
(applause)

00:08:24.567 --> 00:08:29.533
And I've come home to find
the apostrophe that we lost

00:08:29.533 --> 00:08:31.066
somewhere along the way.

00:08:31.066 --> 00:08:35.000
(laughter and applause)

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.800
Audience Member:
I've got it here!

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.967
The President:
Is that where it is?

00:08:41.967 --> 00:08:45.700
(laughter)

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:52.533
Some wise Irish man or woman
once said that broken Irish is

00:08:52.533 --> 00:08:54.934
better than clever English.

00:08:54.934 --> 00:08:57.433
(applause)

00:08:57.433 --> 00:09:05.767
So here goes: Tá áthas orm
bheith in Éirinn --I am happy to

00:09:05.767 --> 00:09:06.800
be in Ireland!

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.700
(applause)

00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:11.266
I'm happy to be with
so many á cairde.

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:20.867
(applause)

00:09:20.867 --> 00:09:25.633
I want to thank my extraordinary
hosts --first of all,

00:09:25.633 --> 00:09:26.834
Taoiseach Kenny --

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.500
(applause)

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.834
--his lovely wife, Fionnuala--

00:09:30.834 --> 00:09:33.166
(applause)

00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:36.533
--President McAleese and
her husband, Martin --

00:09:36.533 --> 00:09:37.266
(applause)

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:40.734
--for welcoming
me earlier today.

00:09:40.734 --> 00:09:47.967
Thank you, Lord Mayor Gerry
Breen and the Gardai for

00:09:47.967 --> 00:09:50.867
allowing me to crash
this celebration.

00:09:50.867 --> 00:09:55.400
(applause)

00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.700
Let me also express my
condolences on the recent

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:04.533
passing of former Taoiseach
Garrett Fitzgerald--

00:10:04.533 --> 00:10:15.133
(applause)

00:10:15.133 --> 00:10:18.800
--someone who believed in
the power of education,

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.367
someone who believed in the
potential of youth, most of all,

00:10:24.367 --> 00:10:28.967
someone who believed in the
potential of peace and who lived

00:10:28.967 --> 00:10:32.400
to see that peace realized.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:38.633
And most of all, thank you to
the citizens of Dublin and the

00:10:38.633 --> 00:10:44.300
people of Ireland for the warm
and generous hospitality you've

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.900
shown me and Michelle.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:50.467
(applause)

00:10:50.467 --> 00:10:53.500
It certainly feels
like 100,000 welcomes.

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.166
(applause)

00:10:55.166 --> 00:10:58.900
We feel very much at home.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.300
I feel even more at home
after that pint that I had.

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.900
(laughter)

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:07.700
Feel even warmer.

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.900
(laughter)

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:16.734
In return let me offer the
hearty greetings of tens of

00:11:16.734 --> 00:11:21.166
millions of Irish Americans
who proudly trace their

00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:23.767
heritage to this small island.

00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:26.767
(applause)

00:11:26.767 --> 00:11:31.166
They say hello.

00:11:31.166 --> 00:11:36.900
Now, I knew that I had some
roots across the Atlantic,

00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.400
but until recently I could not
unequivocally claim that I was

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.834
one of those Irish Americans.

00:11:44.834 --> 00:11:47.700
But now if you believe
the Corrigan Brothers,

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:50.266
there's no one
more Irish than me.

00:11:50.266 --> 00:11:56.633
(laughter and applause)

00:11:56.633 --> 00:12:00.266
So I want to thank the
genealogists who traced my

00:12:00.266 --> 00:12:01.433
family tree.

00:12:01.433 --> 00:12:02.266
Audience Member:
--right here!

00:12:02.266 --> 00:12:03.333
The President:
Right here?

00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:04.333
Thank you.

00:12:04.333 --> 00:12:06.400
(applause)

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.300
It turns out that people take
a lot of interest in you when

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.600
you're running for President.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.033
(laughter)

00:12:14.033 --> 00:12:16.834
They look into your past.

00:12:16.834 --> 00:12:18.900
They check out your
place of birth.

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.433
(laughter)

00:12:20.433 --> 00:12:24.166
Things like that.

00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:26.300
(laughter)

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:29.667
Now, I do wish somebody had
provided me all this evidence

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:33.967
earlier because it would have
come in handy back when

00:12:33.967 --> 00:12:39.100
I was first running in my
hometown of Chicago --

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:41.900
(applause)

00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:45.600
--because Chicago is the
Irish capital of the Midwest.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:48.100
(applause)

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.567
A city where it was once said
you could stand on 79th Street

00:12:52.567 --> 00:12:56.600
and hear the brogue of
every county in Ireland.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.834
(applause)

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:04.633
So naturally a politician
like me craved a slot in the

00:13:04.633 --> 00:13:07.667
St. Patrick's Day parade.

00:13:07.667 --> 00:13:10.400
The problem was not
many people knew me or could

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.900
even pronounce my name.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.800
I told them it
was a Gaelic name.

00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.900
They didn't believe me.

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.767
(laughter)

00:13:18.767 --> 00:13:22.734
So one year a few volunteers and
I did make it into the parade,

00:13:22.734 --> 00:13:27.233
but we were literally
the last marchers.

00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:30.333
After two hours,
finally it was our turn.

00:13:30.333 --> 00:13:35.000
And while we rode the route
and we smiled and we waved,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.767
the city workers
were right behind us

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:38.567
cleaning up the garbage.

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:40.834
(laughter)

00:13:40.834 --> 00:13:42.834
It was a little depressing.

00:13:42.834 --> 00:13:46.066
But I'll bet those parade
organizers are watching TV today

00:13:46.066 --> 00:13:47.700
and feeling kind of bad --

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:51.166
(applause)

00:13:51.166 --> 00:13:53.767
--because this is a pretty
good parade right here.

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:59.700
(applause)

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:00.700
Audience Member:
Go Bulls!

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.600
The President:
Go Bulls --I like that.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.600
(laughter)

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.000
We got some Bulls fans here.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.600
Now, of course, an American
doesn't really require Irish

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:20.767
blood to understand that
ours is a proud, enduring,

00:14:20.767 --> 00:14:27.300
centuries-old relationship; that
we are bound by history and

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:32.233
friendship and shared values.

00:14:32.233 --> 00:14:36.266
And that's why I've come here
today, as an American President,

00:14:36.266 --> 00:14:40.533
to reaffirm those
bonds of affection.

00:14:40.533 --> 00:14:48.000
(applause)

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.934
Earlier today Michelle and I
visited Moneygall where we saw

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:58.266
my ancestral home and
dropped by the local pub.

00:14:58.266 --> 00:14:59.433
(applause)

00:14:59.433 --> 00:15:03.600
And we received a very warm
welcome from all the people

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:08.133
there, including my long-lost
eighth cousin, Henry.

00:15:08.133 --> 00:15:12.100
(laughter)

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.000
Henry now is affectionately
known as Henry VIII.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.567
(laughter)

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:23.500
And it was remarkable to see
the small town where a young

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:28.500
shoemaker named
Falmouth Kearney,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.767
my great-great-great
grandfather,

00:15:30.767 --> 00:15:34.100
my grandfather's grandfather,
lived his early life.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:37.934
And I was the shown
the records from the parish

00:15:37.934 --> 00:15:41.133
recording his birth.

00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:45.000
And we saw the home
where he lived.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:52.400
And he left during the Great
Hunger, as so many Irish did,

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:56.700
to seek a new life
in the New World.

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:01.233
He traveled by ship to New York,
where he entered himself into

00:16:01.233 --> 00:16:04.533
the records as a laborer.

00:16:04.533 --> 00:16:09.500
He married an American
girl from Ohio.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.000
They settled in the Midwest.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.266
They started a family.

00:16:16.266 --> 00:16:22.900
It's a familiar story because
it's one lived and cherished by

00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.500
Americans of all backgrounds.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.967
It's integral to our
national identity.

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:32.367
It's who we are,
a nation of immigrants from

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:35.533
all around the world.

00:16:35.533 --> 00:16:41.700
But standing there in Moneygall,
I couldn't help but think how

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.533
heartbreaking it must have been
for that great-great-great

00:16:45.533 --> 00:16:48.166
grandfather of mine, and
so many others, to part.

00:16:48.166 --> 00:16:53.266
To watch Donegal coasts
and Dingle cliffs recede.

00:16:53.266 --> 00:16:56.266
To leave behind all they
knew in hopes that something

00:16:56.266 --> 00:17:01.467
better lay over the horizon.

00:17:01.467 --> 00:17:06.300
When people like Falmouth
boarded those ships,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:10.333
they often did so with no
family, no friends, no money,

00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:16.033
nothing to sustain their journey
but faith --faith in the

00:17:16.033 --> 00:17:21.967
Almighty; faith in
the idea of America;

00:17:21.967 --> 00:17:25.400
faith that it was a place
where you could be prosperous,

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:29.233
you could be free, you could
think and talk and worship as

00:17:29.233 --> 00:17:35.567
you pleased, a place where you
could make it if you tried.

00:17:35.567 --> 00:17:38.533
And as they worked
and struggled and sacrificed and

00:17:38.533 --> 00:17:42.300
sometimes experienced great
discrimination,

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.867
to build that better life
for the next generation,

00:17:46.867 --> 00:17:51.633
they passed on that faith to
their children and to their

00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:56.266
children's children --an
inheritance that their

00:17:56.266 --> 00:18:02.300
great-great-great grandchildren
like me still carry with them.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.333
We call it the America Dream.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:11.266
(applause)

00:18:11.266 --> 00:18:18.066
It's the dream that Falmouth
Kearney was attracted to

00:18:18.066 --> 00:18:20.367
when he went to America.

00:18:20.367 --> 00:18:23.333
It's the dream that drew
my own father to America from

00:18:23.333 --> 00:18:26.934
a small village in Africa.

00:18:26.934 --> 00:18:29.500
It's a dream that we've carried
forward --sometimes through

00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:33.834
stormy waters, sometimes at
great cost --for

00:18:33.834 --> 00:18:37.700
more than two centuries.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.800
And for my own sake, I'm
grateful they made those

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.967
journeys because if they hadn't
you'd be listening to

00:18:42.967 --> 00:18:44.700
somebody else speak right now.

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:47.367
(laughter)

00:18:47.367 --> 00:18:51.467
And for America's sake, we're
grateful so many others from

00:18:51.467 --> 00:18:55.200
this land took that
chance, as well.

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.000
After all, never has
a nation so small inspired

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.533
so much in another.

00:19:02.533 --> 00:19:12.800
(applause)

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:19.233
Irish signatures are on
our founding documents.

00:19:19.233 --> 00:19:24.967
Irish blood was spilled
on our battlefields.

00:19:24.967 --> 00:19:29.500
Irish sweat built
our great cities.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:34.166
Our spirit is eternally
refreshed by Irish story and

00:19:34.166 --> 00:19:41.166
Irish song; our public life
by the humor and heart and

00:19:41.166 --> 00:19:45.867
dedication of servants with
names like Kennedy and Reagan,

00:19:45.867 --> 00:19:50.333
O'Neill and Moynihan.

00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:53.333
So you could say there's
always been a little green

00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:55.200
behind the red, white and blue.

00:19:55.200 --> 00:20:03.500
(applause)

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.266
When the father of our
country, George Washington,

00:20:06.266 --> 00:20:11.166
needed an army, it was the
fierce fighting of your sons

00:20:11.166 --> 00:20:14.233
that caused the British
official to lament,

00:20:14.233 --> 00:20:17.867
"We have lost America
through the Irish."

00:20:17.867 --> 00:20:19.600
(applause)

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.834
And as George
Washington said himself,

00:20:22.834 --> 00:20:27.900
"When our friendless standards
were first unfurled,

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:33.400
who were the strangers who first
mustered around our staff?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.133
And when it reeled in the light,
who more brilliantly sustained

00:20:37.133 --> 00:20:42.867
it than Erin's generous sons?"

00:20:42.867 --> 00:20:48.233
When we strove to blot out the
stain of slavery and advance the

00:20:48.233 --> 00:20:51.867
rights of man, we found common
cause with your

00:20:51.867 --> 00:20:55.400
struggles against oppression.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:59.700
Frederick Douglass, an
escaped slave and our great

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:03.000
abolitionist, forged an unlikely
friendship right here in

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.667
Dublin with your great
liberator, Daniel O'Connell.

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:14.066
(applause)

00:21:14.066 --> 00:21:16.967
His time here, Frederick
Douglass said,

00:21:16.967 --> 00:21:21.367
defined him not as a
color but as a man.

00:21:21.367 --> 00:21:24.900
And it strengthened the
non-violent campaign he would

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:28.767
return home to wage.

00:21:28.767 --> 00:21:32.867
Recently, some of their
descendents met here in Dublin

00:21:32.867 --> 00:21:35.500
to commemorate and
continue that friendship

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:39.867
between Douglass and O'Connell.

00:21:39.867 --> 00:21:46.433
When Abraham Lincoln struggled
to preserve our young union,

00:21:46.433 --> 00:21:50.533
more than 100,000 Irish and
Irish Americans joined the

00:21:50.533 --> 00:21:55.667
cause, with units like the Irish
Brigade charging into battle

00:21:55.667 --> 00:21:58.800
green flags with gold
harp waving alongside our

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.300
star-spangled banner.

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:08.867
When depression gripped America,
Ireland sent tens of thousands

00:22:08.867 --> 00:22:14.734
of packages of shamrocks to
cheer up its countrymen, saying,

00:22:14.734 --> 00:22:17.133
"May the message of Erin
shamrocks bring

00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:20.967
joy to those away."

00:22:20.967 --> 00:22:27.000
And when an Iron Curtain fell
across this continent and our

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.533
way of life was challenged, it
was our first Irish President

00:22:33.533 --> 00:22:35.033
--our first Catholic
President, John F.

00:22:35.033 --> 00:22:38.734
Kennedy, who made us believe
50 years ago this week --

00:22:38.734 --> 00:22:39.266
(applause)

00:22:39.266 --> 00:22:43.133
--that mankind could do
something big and bold and

00:22:43.133 --> 00:22:46.900
ambitious as walk on the moon.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.133
He made us dream again.

00:22:49.133 --> 00:22:54.166
That is the story of
America and Ireland.

00:22:54.166 --> 00:23:02.066
That's the tale of our brawn
and our blood, side by side,

00:23:02.066 --> 00:23:07.000
in making and remaking a
nation, pulling it westward,

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
pulling it skyward,
moving it forward

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.166
again and again and again.

00:23:11.166 --> 00:23:17.233
And that is our
task again today.

00:23:17.233 --> 00:23:20.133
I think we all realize that both
of our nations have faced great

00:23:20.133 --> 00:23:25.834
trials in recent years,
including recessions so severe

00:23:25.834 --> 00:23:27.467
that many of
our people are still trying

00:23:27.467 --> 00:23:30.567
to fight their way out.

00:23:30.567 --> 00:23:33.166
And naturally our concern
turns to our families,

00:23:33.166 --> 00:23:35.667
our friends and our neighbors.

00:23:35.667 --> 00:23:39.567
And some in this enormous
audience are thinking about

00:23:39.567 --> 00:23:42.967
their own prospects
and their own futures.

00:23:42.967 --> 00:23:46.033
Those of us who are parents
wonder what it will mean for our

00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:53.300
children and young people like
so many who are here today.

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:56.633
Will you see
the same progress we've seen

00:23:56.633 --> 00:23:59.567
since we were your age?

00:23:59.567 --> 00:24:03.266
Will you inherit futures as big
and as bright as

00:24:03.266 --> 00:24:06.567
the ones that we inherited?

00:24:06.567 --> 00:24:14.033
Will your dreams remain
alive in our time?

00:24:14.033 --> 00:24:20.266
This nation has faced those
questions before: When

00:24:20.266 --> 00:24:24.367
your land couldn't
feed those who tilled it;

00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:26.667
when the boats leaving these
shores held some of your

00:24:26.667 --> 00:24:32.700
brightest minds; when brother
fought against brother.

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:38.300
Yours is a history frequently
marked by the greatest of trials

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.300
and the deepest of sorrow.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:47.000
But yours is also a history of
proud and defiant endurance.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.967
Of a nation that kept alive the
flame of knowledge in dark ages;

00:24:50.967 --> 00:24:54.900
that overcame occupation
and outlived fallow fields;

00:24:54.900 --> 00:25:01.100
that triumphed over its Troubles
-- of a resilient people who

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:04.133
beat all the odds.

00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:05.333
(applause)

00:25:05.333 --> 00:25:09.000
And, Ireland, as trying
as these times are,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.700
I know our future is still
as big and as bright as our

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.433
children expect it to be.

00:25:15.433 --> 00:25:20.567
(applause)

00:25:20.567 --> 00:25:26.433
I know that because I know it is
precisely in times like these --

00:25:26.433 --> 00:25:32.200
in times of great challenge, in
times of great change -- when we

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.467
remember who we truly are.

00:25:36.467 --> 00:25:40.033
We're people, the
Irish and Americans,

00:25:40.033 --> 00:25:43.567
who never stop imagining
a brighter future,

00:25:43.567 --> 00:25:46.467
even in bitter times.

00:25:46.467 --> 00:25:49.900
We're people who make that
future happen through hard work,

00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.700
and through sacrifice, through
investing in those things that

00:25:53.700 --> 00:26:00.133
matter most, like
family and community.

00:26:00.133 --> 00:26:04.467
We remember, in the words made
famous by one of your

00:26:04.467 --> 00:26:12.667
greatest poets that "in dreams
begins responsibility."

00:26:12.667 --> 00:26:16.333
This is a nation that met that
responsibility by choosing,

00:26:16.333 --> 00:26:22.100
like your ancestors did, to keep
alight the flame of knowledge

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.767
and invest in a world-class
education for your young people.

00:26:25.767 --> 00:26:29.367
And today, Ireland's youth, and
those who've come back to build

00:26:29.367 --> 00:26:32.600
a new Ireland, are now
among the best-educated,

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.600
most entrepreneurial
in the world.

00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.633
And I see those young
people here today.

00:26:36.633 --> 00:26:38.433
And I know that
Ireland will succeed.

00:26:38.433 --> 00:26:49.166
(applause)

00:26:49.166 --> 00:26:52.467
This is a nation that met its
responsibilities by choosing to

00:26:52.467 --> 00:26:57.500
apply the lessons of your own
past to assume a heavier

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.066
burden of responsibility
on the world stage.

00:27:01.066 --> 00:27:04.433
And today, a people who once
knew the pain of an empty

00:27:04.433 --> 00:27:10.667
stomach now feed those
who hunger abroad.

00:27:10.667 --> 00:27:15.533
Ireland is working hand in hand
with the United States to make

00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:18.934
sure that hungry mouths are fed
around the world--

00:27:18.934 --> 00:27:20.100
because we remember those times.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:26.600
We know what crippling
poverty can be like,

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:31.767
and we want to make sure
we're helping others.

00:27:31.767 --> 00:27:36.467
You're a people who modernized
and can now stand up

00:27:36.467 --> 00:27:41.266
for those who can't
yet stand up for themselves.

00:27:41.266 --> 00:27:44.767
And this is a nation that met
its responsibilities and

00:27:44.767 --> 00:27:49.734
inspired the entire world -- by
choosing to see past the scars

00:27:49.734 --> 00:27:53.667
of violence and mistrust to
forge a lasting

00:27:53.667 --> 00:27:57.100
peace on this island.

00:27:57.100 --> 00:28:03.967
When President Clinton said on
this very spot 15 years ago,

00:28:03.967 --> 00:28:08.734
waging peace is risky, I
think those who were involved

00:28:08.734 --> 00:28:10.433
understood the risks
they were taking.

00:28:10.433 --> 00:28:17.934
But you, the Irish
people, persevered.

00:28:17.934 --> 00:28:21.166
And you cast
your votes and you made your

00:28:21.166 --> 00:28:22.266
voices heard for that peace.

00:28:22.266 --> 00:28:23.967
(applause)

00:28:23.967 --> 00:28:27.800
And you responded heroically
when it was challenged.

00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.834
And you did it because, as
President McAleese has written,

00:28:31.834 --> 00:28:38.600
"For all the apparent
intractability of our problems,

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:44.166
the irrepressible human impulse
to love kept nagging and

00:28:44.166 --> 00:28:48.533
nudging us towards reconciliation."

00:28:48.533 --> 00:28:55.166
Whenever peace is challenged,
you will have to sustain

00:28:55.166 --> 00:28:57.367
that irrepressible impulse.

00:28:57.367 --> 00:29:01.233
And America will
stand by you --always.

00:29:01.233 --> 00:29:03.266
(applause)

00:29:03.266 --> 00:29:07.934
America will stand by you always
in your pursuit of peace.

00:29:07.934 --> 00:29:12.633
(applause)

00:29:12.633 --> 00:29:15.200
And, Ireland, you need to
understand that you've already

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:23.700
so surpassed the world's highest
hopes that what was notable

00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:27.867
about the Northern Ireland
elections two weeks ago was that

00:29:27.867 --> 00:29:33.667
they came and went
without much attention.

00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:35.533
It's not because the
world has forgotten.

00:29:35.533 --> 00:29:40.400
It's because this once unlikely
dream has become that most

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:44.433
extraordinary thing of
things: It has become real.

00:29:44.433 --> 00:29:47.700
A dream has turned
to reality because of the

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.000
work of this nation.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:59.200
(applause)

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:05.300
In dreams begin responsibility.

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:06.867
And embracing that
responsibility,

00:30:06.867 --> 00:30:11.266
working toward it, overcoming
the cynics and the naysayers and

00:30:11.266 --> 00:30:17.033
those who say "you can't"--
that's what makes dreams real.

00:30:17.033 --> 00:30:23.433
That's what Falmouth Kearney
did when he got on that boat,

00:30:23.433 --> 00:30:25.900
and that's what so many
generations of Irish men and

00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:31.333
women have done here in
this spectacular country.

00:30:31.333 --> 00:30:34.367
That is something we can point
to and show our children,

00:30:34.367 --> 00:30:37.500
Irish and American alike.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:39.500
That is something we can teach
them as they grow up

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:43.734
together in a new century,
side by side, as it has

00:30:43.734 --> 00:30:47.200
been since our beginnings.

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.266
This little country, that
inspires the biggest things--

00:30:52.266 --> 00:30:54.600
your best days
are still ahead.

00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.967
(applause)

00:30:56.967 --> 00:31:01.900
Our greatest triumphs--
in America and Ireland alike--

00:31:01.900 --> 00:31:04.900
are still to come.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:08.533
And, Ireland, if anyone
ever says otherwise,

00:31:08.533 --> 00:31:12.767
if anybody ever tells you that
your problems are too big,

00:31:12.767 --> 00:31:15.133
or your challenges
are too great,

00:31:15.133 --> 00:31:19.367
that we can't do something,
that we shouldn't even try--

00:31:19.367 --> 00:31:21.900
think about all that
we've done together.

00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:26.433
Remember that whatever
hardships the winter may bring,

00:31:26.433 --> 00:31:30.333
springtime is always
just around the corner.

00:31:30.333 --> 00:31:32.667
And if they keep on
arguing with you,

00:31:32.667 --> 00:31:39.000
just respond with a simple
creed: Is féidir linn.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.200
Yes, we can.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.967
Yes, we can.

00:31:42.967 --> 00:31:44.433
Is féidir linn.

00:31:44.433 --> 00:31:44.633
(applause)

00:31:44.633 --> 00:31:47.700
For all you've contributed to
the character of the United

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:53.266
States of America and the
spirit of the world, thank you.

00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:57.100
And may God bless the eternal
friendship between

00:31:57.100 --> 00:31:59.400
our two great nations.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.367
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:32:01.367 --> 00:32:03.033
Thank you, Dublin.

00:32:03.033 --> 00:32:05.033
Thank you, Ireland.
