00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.831
To me, God is cold.

00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:30.178
You could say that I think of
the cold as a noble force.

00:00:30.178 --> 00:00:31.950
It's just helping me.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.380
It's training me.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.000
It's bringing me back to the inner
nature the way it was meant to be.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.566
And there's a way I do not only endure,
the cold, I love the cold.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.499
&gt;&gt; We live in a world where there's
all kinds of false healers and

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:17.320
fake alternative medicine
programs you can sign up for.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.340
It's a rare moment in history when someone
comes along who can perform real miracles

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.680
with real evidence to back them up.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.240
Wim Hof has defied logic time and

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.270
time again, and
always under scientific scrutiny.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.760
He holds the world record for
being able to be submerged in ice for

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.208
almost two hours without his
core body temperature changing.

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:40.820
He's climbed Mount Everest in nothing but
a pair of shorts, and

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.020
run a marathon in the desert
without drinking any water.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.630
He's even proven in a laboratory setting

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.070
that he can withstand illnesses
using the power of his mind.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.140
But he's not a freak of nature.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.530
According to Wim,
anyone can do what he can do.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.350
They just have to learn his method,
the Wim Hof method.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.020
Using a combination of cold immersion,
breathing techniques and mental focus,

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.190
anyone can accomplish feats that were
previously thought to be impossible.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.830
&gt;&gt; The question is,
is everybody able to do what you do?

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.411
&gt;&gt; Yes, I am able to train people
in room temperature in just

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.534
a weeks time with a relatively
simple technique and

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.780
make people be able to
influence their immune system.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.513
&gt;&gt; We were skeptical, so Wim invited us
to take a crash course in his method and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.580
see just how easy it is
to become superhuman.

00:02:48.744 --> 00:02:50.966
We first met Wim on his
houseboat in Holland,

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:54.566
where he began to teach our whole
crew the basics of cold immersion.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.040
Growing up in the 21st century,

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.460
we're naturally skeptical of
everything we read on the internet.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.520
But to put Wim's method to the test,
we would have to suspend our disbelief.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.570
Because no true miracle can be
accomplished without some faith.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.660
In this case, the miracle would supposedly
involve the crew and I taking off

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:17.770
our clothes and climbing to the top of
the freezing cold Mount Sniezka in Poland.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.920
But before that, our training
began in the canals of Amsterdam.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.350
So, while I'm climbing the mountain,

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.310
if they haven't done the training,
then they'll be screwed, basically.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.735
- Yes, and the film too.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.560
&gt;&gt; We are going to start
with the breathing.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.080
You will see feeling is understanding.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.730
And later on we can dig in all
kinds of scientific literature and

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.790
readings and comparisons and
statistics and all that, we don't need.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.490
You are going to feel it, we are pioneers.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.780
Okay, just go on.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.840
No thinking, just feel.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.840
Your head is becoming light-headed.

00:04:03.985 --> 00:04:07.180
&gt;&gt; Wim was going to teach us
to endure the cold like him.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.475
But first we had to learn the basics.

00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:13.390
Wim told us to spend one minute
breathing in more air than we let out.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.910
Then he instructed us to take
one last breath and hold it.

00:04:17.679 --> 00:04:20.724
By using his technique,
we were able to hold our breath for

00:04:20.724 --> 00:04:22.040
much longer than usual.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.620
I didn't really know what was going on,
but

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.300
my body was doing things it had never done
before, and I was pretty freaked out.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.262
But also very curious as to
where this would take me.

00:04:34.262 --> 00:04:37.210
It was like I was going
through some second puberty,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.090
where instead of becoming an adult,
I was becoming a superhuman.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.620
&gt;&gt; First round, 2:17 for Matt.

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.660
Crazy, yeah?

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.250
- Whoa.
 It's something, yeah?

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.047
You still?

00:04:48.047 --> 00:04:49.947
I just stopped because I wanted to listen.

00:04:49.947 --> 00:04:51.220
But I was still good.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.980
- Good.

00:04:52.886 --> 00:04:55.490
&gt;&gt; My whole body was just
kind of like tingling.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:00.400
And then when you said to stop breathing,

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.218
it just didn't seem like I had
the need to breathe at all.

00:05:04.218 --> 00:05:05.925
It was really amazing.

00:05:05.925 --> 00:05:07.841
Who are you?

00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:09.001
Who are you?

00:05:11.846 --> 00:05:14.330
I mean, I can't argue with the results.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.530
You've done things that no
one's ever done before.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.120
But there have been hundreds of
people throughout history in

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.160
the past 4,000 years who have claimed
to be able to do all sorts of miracles

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.910
by controlling their body, using
the power of meditation and breathing.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:29.900
What makes you different?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.640
Is it that you're the first
one who can actually do it?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.280
&gt;&gt; Absolutely not the first
one who is able to do this.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.270
But I am the first one to
bring it to science and

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.270
to take away the speculation around it.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.760
&gt;&gt; What was your life like
before you became an iceman?

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:53.460
&gt;&gt; Actually, I was a father of four
kids and bringing them up alone.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.790
Because my wife accidented in 95.

00:05:59.756 --> 00:06:04.936
So that kind of adversity and sadness maybe motivated you to...

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.140
- Oh yes.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.750
Inspire yourself in the same way
a lot of people that do...

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.530
Yes, sadness is a deep trigger.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.170
Where I got peace was in
these breathing exercises.

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:18.370
Swimming outside in the cold.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.190
The cold is merciless,
but righteous as well.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:30.545
&gt;&gt; So, Wim's just told me to get into
my shorts, which can't be a good sign,

00:06:30.545 --> 00:06:33.281
because it means we're
gonna get into the water.

00:06:33.281 --> 00:06:35.068
Wim's already shirtless.

00:06:35.068 --> 00:06:36.647
&gt;&gt; Scared shirtless.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.520
Scared shirtless.

00:06:38.528 --> 00:06:39.828
Just chill out, man.

00:06:39.828 --> 00:06:40.768
&gt;&gt; All right, yeah!

00:06:43.742 --> 00:06:44.602
&gt;&gt; Oh, boy.

00:06:45.902 --> 00:06:47.620
&gt;&gt; Let nature go within you.

00:06:55.398 --> 00:06:56.738
Breathe, motherfucker!

00:06:57.489 --> 00:07:02.649
&gt;&gt; That is some cold Amsterdam
canal December water.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:12.348
Keep on, silently, witness, witness, witness.

00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:15.136
You're doing just fine.

00:07:15.136 --> 00:07:19.151
You're going the way I
know it naturally goes.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.740
I don't feel cold at all.

00:07:24.747 --> 00:07:26.387
I feel like if you keep relaxed and

00:07:26.387 --> 00:07:29.623
you stay in there you could do it
forever like this guy right here.

00:07:29.623 --> 00:07:31.411
Look at this madman.

00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:34.051
So now our producer has to go in as well

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.720
because she's gonna need to be there when we do this.

00:07:37.912 --> 00:07:39.125
So good luck, Casey.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.030
&gt;&gt; You can come in too.

00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:41.632
There you are.

00:07:41.632 --> 00:07:44.094
Hello, take it easy.

00:07:44.094 --> 00:07:47.159
You know people think I'm crazy.

00:07:47.159 --> 00:07:48.738
Maybe I am crazy.

00:07:48.738 --> 00:07:51.315
But not because of my
breathing techniques.

00:07:51.315 --> 00:07:53.474
Not because of my cold water swimming.

00:07:53.474 --> 00:07:59.514
Not because of my being
fearless in extreme challenges.

00:08:01.462 --> 00:08:07.243
The first time I went under the ice,
the water is as sharp as needles.

00:08:07.243 --> 00:08:12.243
I saw this as a big, huge, sharp diamond.

00:08:13.582 --> 00:08:19.758
At 35 meters I lost sight
because the retina, it froze.

00:08:19.758 --> 00:08:21.501
I couldn't see nothing.

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.938
I couldn't breathe, of course.

00:08:23.938 --> 00:08:29.208
And then my consciousness succumbed
to a lower consciousness.

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.623
This is survival.

00:08:31.623 --> 00:08:34.038
I do not fear death.

00:08:34.038 --> 00:08:36.570
I fear not to live fully.

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.230
If I live fully, I am not into death.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:40.630
I am living.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:43.635
&gt;&gt; It isn't all about breaking records.

00:08:43.635 --> 00:08:47.630
Wim's mission is to use
his body as a laboratory

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.920
to revolutionize our
understanding of physiology.

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:54.970
In 2011,
he was injected with a bacterial endotoxin

00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:58.900
in an experiment that challenged our
understanding of the nervous system.

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:03.842
In normal humans, the injection should
cause a strong immune response leading

00:09:03.842 --> 00:09:06.136
to fever, chills, and headaches.

00:09:06.136 --> 00:09:07.668
But not in Wim.

00:09:07.668 --> 00:09:12.453
It appeared that he was somehow able to
suppress his immune response by making

00:09:12.453 --> 00:09:14.368
his body secrete adrenaline,

00:09:14.368 --> 00:09:19.955
suggesting that his method can allow us
to influence our immune system at will.

00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:22.625
Scientists thought he might
just be a freak of nature.

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:24.605
So to further prove this theory,

00:09:24.605 --> 00:09:29.125
they performed this same experiment on
12 subjects Wim had trained in Poland.

00:09:29.125 --> 00:09:30.485
And the same thing happened.

00:09:31.625 --> 00:09:32.275
&gt;&gt; Normally,

00:09:32.275 --> 00:09:36.835
it's very difficult to increase your
adrenaline levels by your own will.

00:09:36.835 --> 00:09:40.030
Adrenaline is released by
the autonomic nervous system.

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:43.640
And autonomic means that you
cannot voluntarily influence it.

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:48.640
So if you walk outside and you are robbed
on the street, you will have a heart

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:53.600
rate of 160 and your blood pressure
will be sky high within seconds.

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.110
But if I ask you now to increase
your heart rate, you cannot do that.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.740
You cannot voluntarily modulate that.

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:04.020
And with the techniques of Wim Hof,
we showed that he was able to

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.720
increase his adrenaline levels
to very high concentrations,

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.580
even higher than people that go
bungee jumping for the first time.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:15.710
That was something that we didn't
think possible before that.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.440
&gt;&gt; If we learn to influence
our immune system at will,

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.490
we could potentially use that to treat
inflammatory disorders where the immune

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.930
system is overactive, including Crohn's
disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:30.840
But Wim didn't seem to think that there
were any limits to what his method

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.090
could accomplish, and
that made me skeptical.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:38.360
He was eager to show that he could help
anyone, including people with cancer.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.310
So he invited us to dinner
with his friend Rene Gude,

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:42.980
a famous philosopher of science,

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.280
who had taken up the Wim Hof method
after being given two months to live.

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.820
&gt;&gt; I don't think Wim is a wonder worker,
and I'm not taking him as a wonder worker.

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:52.638
- Miracle.

00:10:52.638 --> 00:10:53.730
&gt;&gt; A miracle worker.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:56.670
I want to forgo that people who have
cancer

00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:59.980
think that they're off their cancer next week.

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:04.380
That's not a fact, but
there are very good things happening.

00:11:04.380 --> 00:11:06.870
&gt;&gt; So this really is kind of
on the frontier of science.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.400
It's science that we are testing now.

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.530
It's science we don't yet
have a full explanation for, but

00:11:12.530 --> 00:11:14.460
we know that it has
results worth studying.

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:19.940
&gt;&gt; Yes, and
the real frontier of science is looking

00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.930
if this immune system is
an auto-immune system,

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:30.490
or that we can influence our
immune system in the hope for

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:34.040
that the immune deficiency
diseases decrease.

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:39.610
And the results are hopeful, but
hopeful, I use the word myself.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.110
&gt;&gt; Everything that Wim does is based
in science, but surely faith in Wim and

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:46.450
nature and
ourselves is also really crucial to

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.680
accomplishing the things that
Wim teaches people to do.

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:53.500
&gt;&gt; As soon as you put the exercise in the
center, and you see the difference between

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:58.069
religion and spirituality and science,
there is, in fact, just the explanation.

00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.370
Religion, spirituality and

00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:05.920
science are circling about something
that's definitely good for us.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.049
Train your body, man.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.580
As a human, what has this done for you?

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:17.630
&gt;&gt; I'm not easily convinced,
but I'm always looking for

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:21.450
something that gives me some
control in this fucking situation.

00:12:23.134 --> 00:12:28.490
You have a life expectancy of two months,
and then you're out of control.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:35.450
Maybe it's the same with
the autonomous immune system.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.350
I would like to be
autonomous myself a little.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:44.220
And when there is really something that
can be done and proves it's all right and

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.400
makes me feel better, it's...

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.020
- Very satisfying.

00:12:52.025 --> 00:12:53.605
It was very satisfying.

00:12:54.125 --> 00:12:56.145
It was very satisfying.

00:12:58.355 --> 00:13:03.091
Please, let nobody who see's this
program think that you're just getting

00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:07.325
into control and then drive onto
some mountain and conquer cancer.

00:13:07.325 --> 00:13:10.751
I don't like this speech of conquering
cancer and doing something.

00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:15.278
But when you get something to do and
to practice which you understand and

00:13:15.278 --> 00:13:18.158
which you can do and
which satisfies...

00:13:18.158 --> 00:13:21.570
Some feeling of control comes back and
I like that very much.

00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:27.835
&gt;&gt; Hypothetically, if research came back
and it turned out that actually your

00:13:27.835 --> 00:13:32.142
methods weren't working, there was
some kind of trick of adrenalin or

00:13:32.142 --> 00:13:36.262
some other factor that accounted for
all of the feats of endurance.

00:13:36.262 --> 00:13:37.423
What would that make you feel?

00:13:37.423 --> 00:13:38.131
&gt;&gt; I'm okay.

00:13:38.131 --> 00:13:42.940
You know,
I want it to be evidence-based in science.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:48.100
And I don't want to give any false
hope to any person in this world.

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:54.060
So, I'm into science, but
he is interested in a natural method

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.120
that needs only the commitment of a person

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.480
to make it work within just a day or
two days.

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.900
You will be able to go
deeper into the system and

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.850
learn to control the immune system,
cardiovascular system,

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.660
the hormonal system, the muscular system,
autonomic nervous system.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:19.620
All that,
I mean it's just learning to go back

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.520
into the inner power which we all have.

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:27.420
&gt;&gt; We traveled to Poland for the next step
in our training, which would hopefully end

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:31.049
with us climbing Mount Sniezka in our
shorts and not getting hypothermia.

00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:37.170
In Amsterdam, we had our first little
taste of training with the Iceman.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.995
But for us to really get into
what Wim calls cold hard nature,

00:14:40.995 --> 00:14:44.298
he's invited us here,
to Mount Sniezka in Poland.

00:14:44.298 --> 00:14:47.148
This is where he trains
all of his big groups,

00:14:47.148 --> 00:14:50.688
including the 12 scientific test subjects
that later proved they were able

00:14:50.688 --> 00:14:54.048
to suppress their immune
response in an endotoxin test.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:04.795
&gt;&gt; Control.

00:15:05.095 --> 00:15:08.915
No hocus pocus just the magic
of your [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:11.169
Make it work guys.

00:15:12.255 --> 00:15:15.590
Control into your brain.

00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:20.600
Nobody else's, no blah blahs,
just make it work.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.950
Deeply in, let me go.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.460
&gt;&gt; Faster.

00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:32.262
Okay, count down.

00:15:32.262 --> 00:15:37.700
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.420
five, four, three, two, one.

00:15:48.676 --> 00:15:50.638
Good.

00:16:10.596 --> 00:16:13.696
It's really bizarre to be in
a room with a bunch of people who

00:16:13.696 --> 00:16:15.503
are tripping out from breathing.

00:16:15.503 --> 00:16:19.504
You get these tingly sensations
throughout your hands and your body, so

00:16:19.504 --> 00:16:22.430
it feels like everything's vibrating.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:24.810
And then you get kind of
like a sense of euphoria.

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.080
And for me that was it.

00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:29.360
You cried.

00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.190
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Mine was so weird.

00:16:31.190 --> 00:16:32.760
All my hands were like this.

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.507
They just locked and
I could not move them.

00:16:34.507 --> 00:16:38.130
Then I just cried and cried and
cried, and I couldn't stop crying.

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:42.050
I wasn't thinking about anything sad,
it was just like, it came up.

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.220
&gt;&gt; It's hard to talk about it
without sounding really cliche, but

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:49.280
when I first did the breathing,
in the middle of it, I remember thinking,

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.550
I'm so happy, I just want to get up and
hug all of you people.

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:53.850
I love you, I love all of you.

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.010
And I guess that's how you
become a hippie, pretty much.

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.993
&gt;&gt; I was amazed to see some of
the reactions that people had here.

00:17:02.993 --> 00:17:08.370
What's happened when people have
this kind of big responses?

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:14.040
&gt;&gt; What we do, we are going deeply into
the physiology past, the condition,

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:19.780
and what appears, people begin to cry or
they release anger.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.870
Whatever is hidden deeper
than the conditioning,

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:27.510
these techniques make it
quite able to go really deep.

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:32.210
&gt;&gt; I guess it's kind of similar
when a psychologist gets someone to

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:35.190
relive past trauma and
come to terms with it.

00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:37.215
&gt;&gt; We do not need psychotherapy.

00:17:37.215 --> 00:17:40.660
Fuck off! Just let it breathe in.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:44.790
Just bring back the control
within yourself.

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:46.590
Connect back with the body.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:50.140
This time we are able to cleanse it all.

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:54.560
All of the people say, yeah, you cannot
steer life, and you cannot do this,

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:59.590
and yeah, it's part of life, and
it's destiny, and it's fate.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.090
Fuck fate, and fuck destiny and all that.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:07.700
No, this time we learn to control
our happiness, health and strength,

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.280
and that's not philosophical or sectarian.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.330
It's chemistry.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.520
&gt;&gt; Do you ever get any
really negative people

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:18.480
who never really succumb to the cause?

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.007
&gt;&gt; I have a very good example of that.

00:18:20.007 --> 00:18:23.595
Scott Carmen is
an investigative journalist.

00:18:23.595 --> 00:18:27.967
He came from America to this
place to cut through the crap and

00:18:27.967 --> 00:18:32.610
the charlatan business and
all that and that was me, you know?

00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:36.484
The charlatan and the crap,
and it took him two days, and

00:18:36.484 --> 00:18:40.540
when he converted into hey,
but this shit is good.

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:45.121
And he was standing with us
in shorts after two days.

00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:49.744
And now he wants to write a book and
bring it to America and everything.

00:19:02.545 --> 00:19:05.680
&gt;&gt; Make a big circle, big circle.

00:19:13.220 --> 00:19:17.400
It may look like a Pentecostal ceremony
at times, but if you hyperventilate for

00:19:17.405 --> 00:19:21.680
long enough, it's normal to experience
euphoria and muscle spasms and seizures.

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:25.670
It's more difficult to imagine how that
can make it easier

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:27.560
to stand out in the snow for an hour.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.804
Maybe, like in the immune response test,
it had to do with secreting adrenaline.

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.570
But whether it was some ancient secret of
human physiology or simply brute force

00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:43.420
endurance and mental focus, it seemed that
Wim's method was working on the group.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:50.398
My suspicion was that the secret was
the infectious charisma of Wim himself.

00:19:50.398 --> 00:19:54.440
And just being in his presence was
inspiring us to accomplish things we never

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.901
would've normally done.

00:20:04.688 --> 00:20:07.868
You're getting into some pretty
deep places with your mind, and

00:20:07.868 --> 00:20:12.428
although it sounds kinda out there,
when you experience it, I can't even...

00:20:13.661 --> 00:20:16.877
It's scary slash amazing at the same time.

00:20:16.877 --> 00:20:20.901
&gt;&gt; I don't know where, but
I was gone and I saw things.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:28.140
And I didn't even notice that I
was screaming and making noises.

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:29.890
It was really amazing.

00:20:29.890 --> 00:20:32.380
&gt;&gt; It's just something
we don't know we can do.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:37.230
In the east part of the world, it's in
the culture to teach people how to do it.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:40.260
In the western part of the world,
it's not a culture.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:45.196
&gt;&gt; Enlightenment is a form of happiness
and health, and it's not as deep and

00:20:45.196 --> 00:20:47.436
profound as people imagined it.

00:20:47.436 --> 00:20:50.306
&gt;&gt; I had a thing called Crohn's
disease about ten years ago.

00:20:50.306 --> 00:20:54.620
I've been to detox centers and
spent thousands and thousands of dollars

00:20:54.620 --> 00:20:57.760
on lots of different
health alternative improvement things.

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.080
A lot of them are quite new age and
just a load of old bull shit.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.985
At least Wim Hof has been working with
a lot of different types of scientists and

00:21:04.985 --> 00:21:08.190
advanced hospital research,
that's the beautiful thing.

00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:10.830
You've seen him on the Guinness Book
of Records where he is sitting in

00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:12.140
an ice cube for two hours.

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:17.280
&gt;&gt; So what's going on?

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:23.340
&gt;&gt; We are filling the torches with gas,

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:27.020
we are going to the waterfall later on,
like a fairy tale.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:31.480
&gt;&gt; Wim's method would never have
spread beyond himself if it wasn't for

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:36.590
his business savvy son, Enahm whose
turned the Iceman into a website,

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.720
an app and a global brand.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.635
I sent him some news when I was in Tanzania.

00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:47.656
Enahm, I've been looking around here,
but even in these

00:21:47.656 --> 00:21:53.715
far places where I'm getting,
I don't find an asshole as big as you.

00:21:53.715 --> 00:21:55.095
&gt;&gt; Yeah, as big as me, yeah.

00:21:55.095 --> 00:21:56.441
&gt;&gt; You are still the greatest.

00:21:56.441 --> 00:21:59.263
The greatest asshole.

00:21:59.263 --> 00:22:02.310
&gt;&gt; The Wim Hof method did
not exist four years ago.

00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:06.100
It was an Iceman doing a trick
which was only one person.

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.429
So, Iceman is a superhero.

00:22:07.429 --> 00:22:12.445
Nobody can be as the Iceman, because its
just one person, it's a superhero.

00:22:12.445 --> 00:22:16.821
Wim Hof is a person like everyone else,
and he already gained this fame

00:22:16.821 --> 00:22:21.409
to attract the attention to show the whole
world that everybody is able to do much more

00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:25.095
than thought of, so I thought that's a beautiful goal.

00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:27.243
To bring that back to the people.

00:22:27.243 --> 00:22:32.800
And yeah, I've started doing the platforms
and now here you guys are you know.

00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.530
I saw the things already from my
childhood, what he could do with people.

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:39.150
So I trusted it.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:43.340
&gt;&gt; How much of this came out of
the tragedy of your mother's death?

00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:44.920
&gt;&gt; Everything started there.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.120
Because my Mom was psychotic.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:53.090
They consented her with 11 personalities,
and she was never there for us.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.440
It was always my Dad being there for us.

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.270
They stuffed her up with pills
to get her outside of society.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.420
And she committed suicide.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:07.910
So that was the beginning of my Dad
exploring for, okay, what's the answer?

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.880
Where lies all these problems?

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.690
So he went challenging himself.

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:15.850
You know if you don't have an answer,
if they don't have an answer,

00:23:15.850 --> 00:23:18.410
you're going to find yourself an answer.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.670
I know where I came from, from a valley.

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:23.830
It's like a trauma.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:26.400
She jumped from eight floor.

00:23:26.774 --> 00:23:30.370
That's my grief, I loved her to death.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:35.610
But the world is huge,
it's not interested in natural effects so

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:37.140
much, it's the money.

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:43.150
It's very difficult to bring this to
their standards, but we are on it.

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:48.610
So science in time now will take it on and
we do our studies.

00:23:50.143 --> 00:23:55.360
&gt;&gt; Everyone's about to participate in
this kind of non-religious ritual.

00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.370
They hold the torch to represent
the fire within, then get in the water.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:03.006
Yeah, it might look a little bit
sectarian and I've said it before,

00:24:03.006 --> 00:24:06.641
I don't think this is a cult, but
the thing is Wim is so charismatic,

00:24:06.641 --> 00:24:10.240
if he gave me any poison to drink
I'd be the first person to drink it.

00:24:26.845 --> 00:24:27.785
&gt;&gt; Five.

00:24:29.258 --> 00:24:30.138
Four.

00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:32.900
Three.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.060
Two.

00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.600
There you go, one.

00:24:39.103 --> 00:24:43.760
There we go all in and let them go.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:48.070
I am going to tuck you in.

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:49.508
&gt;&gt; I love being tucked in.

00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.640
We're so cute.

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.870
The group had gone and Daisy and I werenleft with our own personal iceman trainer.

00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.660
In the lead up to climbing Mt.Snezka,

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.520
we were gonna need all the extra help we could get.

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:02.920
&gt;&gt; That was so weird.

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.155
That was at the trippiest it's been.

00:25:05.155 --> 00:25:09.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you get eventually,
these white hallucinations,

00:25:09.370 --> 00:25:11.720
but it might just be depriving
your brain of oxygen.

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:13.140
I don't know if that's good.

00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:16.100
Maybe.

00:25:18.170 --> 00:25:22.710
&gt;&gt; Here is the summit,
which we are going to get to tomorrow,

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:25.887
in snow and ice, and just in shorts.

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:30.540
This is what I did before, on Mt.Everest.

00:25:31.170 --> 00:25:33.441
I was up till here, in shorts.

00:25:33.441 --> 00:25:38.220
Coming from 5,200 to 5,800,

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:44.410
6,400, 6,700, 7,500, 700.

00:25:44.410 --> 00:25:46.250
Over here I was.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:48.190
&gt;&gt; He walked up Mt.Everest in his shorts.

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:49.920
What have you done with your life?

00:25:54.312 --> 00:25:58.747
We've just done the fun part of the Wim
Hof method which is when we get to do

00:25:58.747 --> 00:26:02.749
the breathing exercises and
make ourselves feel really giddy and

00:26:02.749 --> 00:26:05.751
now it's time for
the part that everyone hates.

00:26:05.751 --> 00:26:10.870
Which is stripping down to our shorts and
jumping in a freezing cold waterfall.

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:13.048
The waters running so
the water doesnt actually freeze but

00:26:13.048 --> 00:26:14.430
the temperature is below freezing.

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:18.582
That means this is pretty much
the coldest water I'll ever experience.

00:27:07.570 --> 00:27:10.152
So we've just come out of
the freezing cold water and

00:27:10.152 --> 00:27:11.800
I cannot tell you how cold it was.

00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:14.230
It was the coldest water
I've ever experienced.

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:16.430
I can't feel my toes at all.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:21.630
To each one of my toes, the toe next to it
feels like a foreign object in my shoe.

00:27:21.630 --> 00:27:22.970
Cuz I just can't feel them.

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:27.320
You just start to think fight or
flight mode.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.700
I need to get out of this water.

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:32.570
This is not where humans are meant to be.

00:27:35.828 --> 00:27:38.212
&gt;&gt; [FOREIGN]
- Yeah, of course.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.040
You know nothing about Poland!

00:28:03.195 --> 00:28:07.895
&gt;&gt; Obviously, you have your mission,
which is a noble one.

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:12.220
But I have to ask, is it not also
a bit about the bragging rights of

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.520
being able to say I climbed
Mount Everest in my shorts?

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:17.597
&gt;&gt; If I can use it, I use it all the time.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.800
Too many are records.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:27.080
Too many of them have given
no real peace within myself.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:35.540
My unrestfunless deeply within,
created by not me, but by destiny itself.

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:42.050
So, I gotta solve this, until its
at peace and, okay I will keep on.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:46.251
I think the king and the queens,
all these funny hats.

00:28:46.251 --> 00:28:51.660
The thing about that,
if you're healthy electromagnetically,

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:56.692
you are able to distinguish
an energy field around your head.

00:28:56.692 --> 00:28:58.602
- See you're doing that thing you always do,

00:28:58.602 --> 00:29:01.068
when I'm really into
what you're saying.

00:29:01.068 --> 00:29:03.412
It's filled with beautiful metaphors.

00:29:03.412 --> 00:29:05.505
I'm ready to accept you as my leader.

00:29:05.505 --> 00:29:09.650
And then you say something I
can't quite get my head around.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.830
What is an electromagnetic halo?

00:29:12.980 --> 00:29:16.240
Oh, that's just your nervous
system actually as electric signals.

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:18.278
Yeah, okay.

00:29:18.278 --> 00:29:22.073
I’m following you now…
- And if your brain  bit not fucked up

00:29:22.073 --> 00:29:26.563
then you got a nice electrical
field around your head.

00:29:26.563 --> 00:29:29.997
&gt;&gt; Do I have any kind of aura?

00:29:29.997 --> 00:29:31.419
&gt;&gt; Yes, you got.

00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:32.288
&gt;&gt; Really?
&gt;&gt; Yeah, yeah.

00:29:32.288 --> 00:29:33.400
What's it doing?

00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.240
&gt;&gt; What does it look like?

00:29:35.866 --> 00:29:37.466
&gt;&gt; Wait a minute.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:41.487
Its coming, its coming!

00:29:42.510 --> 00:29:44.692
&gt;&gt; No, no, fuck you!

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.140
Its already there man.

00:29:49.148 --> 00:29:53.128
You're the king,
she's the queen, and that's it!

00:29:55.101 --> 00:29:57.638
&gt;&gt; Well done, today.

00:29:57.638 --> 00:29:59.278
And tomorrow even better.

00:29:59.670 --> 00:30:00.836
Nature calls us.

00:30:00.836 --> 00:30:04.249
And Mother Nature says I
gotta tuck you in man.

00:30:29.613 --> 00:30:33.693
Because of a powerless situation of grief

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.520
and emotion and now I've got the power.

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:42.770
And now, I want to take away and
show scientifically that depression and

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:46.370
all the diseases, almost all the diseases,

00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:51.690
we are able to learn to prevent them
from developing inside the body.

00:30:51.690 --> 00:30:56.400
Because we are able to have
a connection direct inside,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.930
which goes far deeper than ever thought.

00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:05.450
Boom, I'm gonna show the world
that everybody is able instead

00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:10.540
of being powerless to have
power over his own system.

00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:20.010
&gt;&gt; We just stayed in that freezing
cold water for one minute.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:24.020
And the craziest part is I
feel warm on the inside.

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:28.630
It must be the adrenaline or
something, but I finally get it.

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.100
By standing in there and
letting the adrenaline rush over you,

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:37.194
you don't feel the cold.

00:31:37.194 --> 00:31:39.234
I could stand out here for a while.

00:31:40.546 --> 00:31:42.526
But I'm not going to because I might die.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:59.182
&gt;&gt; Right now,
we are right over here, 750 meters.

00:31:59.182 --> 00:32:03.242
We go up to 1400 meters, that's the Kopa.

00:32:03.242 --> 00:32:07.895
From the Kopa we'll go to the Sněžka,
and it's cold.

00:32:07.895 --> 00:32:11.755
And so all you have studied,
Matt, you are going to need it.

00:32:11.755 --> 00:32:14.875
And now just, don't think, but focus.

00:32:14.875 --> 00:32:20.368
Trust your body to be able to go with the
elements up there, and you will be able.

00:32:20.368 --> 00:32:24.493
And with that you are going to show for
yourself, hey man I can do this.

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:35.382
&gt;&gt; If you ever wanted a real test
of the Wim Hof Method, this is it.

00:32:35.382 --> 00:32:38.866
If you concentrate hard enough,
this snow looks like sand and

00:32:38.866 --> 00:32:41.230
you just feel like you're at the beach.

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.900
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:42.960
That's the mind.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.810
If your mind is on it, then you're quite
capable of dealing with the elements.

00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:50.951
Yeah, cause it is a bit nippy really.
- Yeah.

00:32:51.711 --> 00:32:52.450
Hey.

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:53.830
[FOREIGN]

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:15.480
There's a method to this. What I'm doing is breathing in more oxygen than I need

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.800
and then I'm breathing out without fully letting go.

00:33:17.802 --> 00:33:19.886
Doing that five times and

00:33:19.886 --> 00:33:25.445
on the final breath squeezing
the oxygen into your chest, neck and

00:33:25.445 --> 00:33:30.520
head, and that creates either real or
illusionary heat.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.430
And then you let go.

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.940
And that's how we get to
the top of the mountain.

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.345
Oh shit!

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.120
My crampons!

00:33:41.499 --> 00:33:43.542
Minor crampon emergency, it's fine.

00:33:50.032 --> 00:33:55.838
There a few theories as to why
Wim Hof can do what he can do.

00:33:55.838 --> 00:34:00.230
One is that he has a higher level
of brown adipose tissue, or

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:05.190
brown fat, in his body, which is
a heat generating tissue in the body.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:08.060
Studies have shown that people
who work outside in the cold

00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.510
have higher levels of brown fat.

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:13.490
So it's possible that he's able
to manipulate the level of

00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:17.450
brown fat in his body by exposure to
the cold, like we're doing right now.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:24.810
Another theory is that he's able to
secrete the hormone noradrenaline at will,

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:28.730
through breathing and
by jumping into cold water.

00:34:28.730 --> 00:34:33.940
Then that adrenaline allows him to
overcome coldness and illnesses.

00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:37.930
Another theory is that he uses
a form of meditation similar to

00:34:37.930 --> 00:34:42.620
the Tibetan Tummo meditation, which by
shutting off the activity of the mind,

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:45.600
your metabolism gets redirected
into generating heat.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:49.148
It's probably a combination
of all those three and

00:34:49.148 --> 00:34:53.447
some as of yet unexplained
physiological phenomena as well.

00:34:53.447 --> 00:34:56.083
But Wim takes it a step further.

00:34:56.083 --> 00:35:00.949
He says that using his method,
you can go deep into the body and

00:35:00.949 --> 00:35:06.670
actually control your own autonomic
nervous system and immune system.

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:12.840
I went through the scientific
scrutiny of research

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:17.290
and put me to the test and
they saw amazing things.

00:35:17.290 --> 00:35:22.300
But then they said you are the Ice Man,
you are just one test subject, and

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.420
I said, no, what I can do, anybody can do.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.440
&gt;&gt; You can just start
doing these techniques and

00:35:27.443 --> 00:35:31.412
you can modulate your
adrenaline levels by will.

00:35:31.412 --> 00:35:35.140
Stress are able to modulate
your immune response.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:39.500
There are many diseases that
are influenced by your immune system.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.280
And you can imagine that it would
be of interest if you could

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:45.915
modulate that immune response and
suppress it,

00:35:45.915 --> 00:35:50.650
that it might be of benefit for
patients with diseases like that.

00:35:50.650 --> 00:35:55.406
&gt;&gt; How did it feel when you finally got
recognition from the science world that

00:35:55.406 --> 00:35:56.700
your methods work?

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:58.082
&gt;&gt; I cried.

00:35:58.082 --> 00:35:59.371
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:35:59.371 --> 00:36:06.540
&gt;&gt; You know what happens when your wife
whom you love so dearly, she suicides?

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.699
You don't understand,
you just don't understand.

00:36:09.699 --> 00:36:11.410
You have no power anymore.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:16.905
And finally, because you have
been everywhere looking for

00:36:16.905 --> 00:36:22.016
how to silence the grief,
you finally get scientific recognition,

00:36:22.016 --> 00:36:24.500
that's the time when you break.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:26.834
That's the time when you can relieve.

00:36:26.834 --> 00:36:29.539
That's the time you can let go.

00:36:29.539 --> 00:36:30.859
It's when you cry.

00:36:39.122 --> 00:36:40.363
&gt;&gt; Look at the clouds.

00:36:45.901 --> 00:36:47.941
&gt;&gt; Wow, mother holy mama.

00:36:51.787 --> 00:36:53.127
It's nice, huh?

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:59.900
&gt;&gt; It's amazing what the body can do when
you actually force it to go to its limits.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.550
&gt;&gt; Yes, to its natural ability.

00:37:07.245 --> 00:37:11.725
&gt;&gt; We 'vecrossed the border from Poland
into the Czech Republic, and now we're

00:37:11.725 --> 00:37:16.685
just about to summit the tallest mountain
in the Czech Republic in our shorts.

00:37:19.584 --> 00:37:21.407
Hello there.

00:37:21.407 --> 00:37:22.787
All the way.

00:37:22.787 --> 00:37:23.740
Good.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.356
&gt;&gt; How are you feeling?

00:37:25.356 --> 00:37:26.256
&gt;&gt; I'm feeling good.

00:37:26.867 --> 00:37:28.083
Once again, back home.

00:37:35.199 --> 00:37:37.365
&gt;&gt; One of the reasons it's been so
difficult for

00:37:37.365 --> 00:37:40.386
Wim to get his method accepted
by a scientific establishment,

00:37:40.386 --> 00:37:44.410
is that it's inimical to our society's
view of the body and medicine.

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:47.180
Wim's figured out a way to
influence the immune system

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.900
without the use of pharmaceuticals.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:53.340
And that could have big ramifications for
people with inflammatory disorders.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:56.850
Whether it can be used to cure actual
diseases remains to be proven.

00:37:56.850 --> 00:37:58.920
This is the frontier of science, so

00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:01.690
it might be many years before we
fully understand the implications.

00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.450
We came into this with a heavy dose of
skepticism, but within a few days we were

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:10.910
able to comfortably climb a freezing
cold mountain in nothing bur our shorts.

00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:14.510
Wim gives people a chance to take back
