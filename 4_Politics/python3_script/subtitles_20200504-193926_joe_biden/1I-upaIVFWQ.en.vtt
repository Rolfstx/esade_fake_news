00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.460
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that brings us to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks. That's syndicated columnist

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.259
Mark Shields and New York Times columnist
David Brooks.

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.329
Hello to both of you.

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:15.019
David, let's start with these allegations
against the former vice president and his

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.630
response to them today.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.460
What do you make of all this?

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.880
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I think we should keep
an open mind.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.000
On the one hand, she made them contemporaneously.
She told people at the time that this had

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.340
happened, and so that has some persuasive
evidence to it.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.449
On the other hand, she said that she told
three members of the Biden staff, including

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:41.050
Ted Kaufman, his chief of staff, and they
do not remember any such conversation, and

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.370
they are convinced that, if they had such
a conversation, it would be seared into their

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.570
memory.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.760
And then I guess the second point on the Biden
side is that Biden is -- has many flaws. I

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.640
have covered him for many years. Cruelty is
not one of them. Dehumanization is not one

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.640
of them.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.799
And so I think, for a lot of his colleagues
and a lot of people who've just known him,

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.960
it seems uncharacteristic.

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.800
But that's not to say we should close the
book on it. We should see if there is this

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.520
complaint. We should see if there are other
victims. I guess Ms. Reade is going to speak

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.190
over the weekend. And so I think it's important
to hear out these allegations, but not take

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.750
them as prima facie truth.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.820
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, what do you make of this?
I mean, Biden acknowledges that he has said

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.790
in the past that women are to be believed.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.270
MARK SHIELDS: He has, Judy. And that is very
much the position of the Democratic Party,

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.290
and certainly was in the Kavanaugh hearings
of the Supreme Court last fall.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.260
I would say this. First of all, it was categorical.
It wasn't to the best of my recollection kind

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:50.980
of answer by Joe Biden. It was a categorical,
unequivocal denial that this ever happened.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.400
And there was no attempt to trash the accuser
or anything of the sort. He -- I thought he

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.470
confronted it well. He had to. He didn't have
any option in it.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.310
I would add this, Judy. Washington is a pretty
small town. And on Capitol Hill, where we

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.980
have spent a lot of time over the past 45
years, you get -- the word circulates pretty

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:22.630
quickly about who is Senator Grabby and who's
Congressman Leering or Lustful, that women

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.950
reporters or women staff members ought not
to be in the same elevator with or stay away

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.990
from.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.980
I have never and I don't know anyone else
who's heard about Joe Biden in those terms.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.090
That is not -- that is characteristically
not Joe Biden. And he was somebody who went

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.700
home every night on the train to Wilmington.
I mean, he wasn't a nightlife guy. He wasn't

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.550
an on-the-town fellow.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.890
I mean, so it does sound -- on its face, it's
a hard sell.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.480
But I agree with David that we listen to the
-- Ms. Reade and what she has to say in her

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.480
interviews.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.760
And I really think, at some point, Joe Biden
will have to deputize some group to look at

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:12.280
the pages in the Delaware -- University of
Delaware zone, to see if there's references

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.280
to it.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.290
I just think that's -- whether it's historic
-- Karen Tumulty suggested it today in her

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.069
Washington Post column. And I think it made
a lot of sense.

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.830
JUDY WOODRUFF: You do think that those records
will have to be opened up.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.040
David, and in terms of what voters weigh,
do they -- I mean, given the multiple allegations

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.710
against President Trump, how are voters to
make sense of this?

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:42.000
DAVID BROOKS: Well, the fact that Trump made
a statement about this at all and attacked

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.920
Joe Biden is like the -- wins the hutzpah
of the year award.

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.060
But I don't think it's going to be up to voters.
I think this is up to Democrats and Democratic

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.200
delegates. They're going to have to decide
if this is true and if they can nominate this

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200
person.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.800
And so far, as Nancy Pelosi says, they're
feeling very comfortable with it. And all

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.500
the -- Stacey Abrams and Kirsten Gillibrand,
and all the -- a lot of -- Kamala Harris,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.830
they're sticking by Joe so far.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.709
And so I think it's really up to the delegates
more than it'll be up to the voters.

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.629
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, you agree?

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.519
MARK SHIELDS: I do, Judy.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:22.560
I think it will be -- if there's a confrontation,
it will be in the Democratic Party. I mean,

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.570
that will be it. But I think that Joe Biden
comes into it with considerable credibility.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.060
And that's it.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.270
But I do think he has to be totally forthcoming
on this. I really do.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.030
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's turn to the pandemic.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:45.410
The "NewsHour" spent a lot of time tonight
and last night and before that looking, David,

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:51.360
at the effect this has had on people's livelihoods.
We know some states are opening up, but, in

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.870
other states, it's not fast enough for people.
We're seeing these protests in California,

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:02.120
in Michigan yesterday, where people carried
guns actually into the state Senate chamber.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.830
The president has somehow encouraged some
of them. He's called today -- in a tweet,

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.280
he called some of them good people.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:15.490
How are governors to handle this under the
circumstances?

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:23.010
DAVID BROOKS: Well, this is -- from what I
can tell, radical fringe elements. They completely

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.470
do not represent the country.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.070
The country is relatively united. We're used
to a divided country. And America is still

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:34.010
divided about Donald Trump. America is not
divided about much else; 89 percent of Republicans

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.100
and 89 percent of Democrats like the federal
aid packages; 70 percent think that we're

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.480
going to need another -- aid packages.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.370
Something like 85 percent of Americans think
-- are supporting the social distancing. So,

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.860
America is united here. And the governors
just need to do what they need to do for the

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.830
economy, but listening to fringe elements
who storm them with guns and Confederate Flags

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.770
doesn't strike me as a very sensible thing
to do.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:05.520
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, how are governors to
walk this line at this time, when people really

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.530
are hurting, and many of them sincerely think
their states are wrong to extend these -- these

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:12.620
shutdown orders?

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.490
MARK SHIELDS: No, you're right, Judy.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:24.270
But just point to a recent national survey
of 22,000 people in all 50 states, and by

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:33.100
-- overwhelmingly, Americans support and back
the handling of the coronavirus by their governor;

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:39.590
66 percent of Americans say that their governor
is doing a -- they approve of the work their

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.720
governor is doing.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:46.419
Only 44 percent of Americans approve of the
job the president is doing in handling the

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:52.460
coronavirus. So, I think that the governors
have enormous credibility.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:00.050
In the state of Michigan, I think that Governor
Whitmer was at 63 percent approval, and Donald

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.530
Trump was at 36 percent approval. So, I think
the president makes a serious mistake, and

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:11.610
he should have learned from Charlottesville,
when he starts endorsing as good people folks

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:21.310
who are carrying "Heil Whitmer" signs and
swastikas and brandishing assault weapons

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.860
in the state capitol, with kerchiefs over
their face.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:33.810
I mean, to me, that is -- that is a fringe
group. And I think you're risking, if you're

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:44.010
Donald Trump, not only some personal or public
hurt and pain, but also responsibility for

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:45.010
same.

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:46.010
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.610
David, as we think about helping the folks
who are on the front lines, who are -- who

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:56.479
are putting their -- frankly, their lives,
their health at risk, it's coming -- it's

00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:59.169
becoming the next big debate in the Congress.

00:07:59.169 --> 00:08:04.020
And that's over help for state and local governments.
That includes first responders. It includes

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:10.050
some EMS workers and others. Democrats are
saying, this is crucial. Republicans, like

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:14.120
Leader Mitch McConnell in the Senate, are
saying, look, some of these states have not

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.199
spent their money wisely. Why should we bail
them out?

00:08:18.199 --> 00:08:22.850
Where -- where are you on this debate at this
stage?

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.251
DAVID BROOKS: We're going to need to do more.
I think 70 percent of Americans think so.

00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:32.051
I certainly think so, something on the order
of $400 million even just in the small business

00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:34.539
loans.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:38.750
And so I think it's not stupid to take a pause
for a week or two. I don't think we know -- I

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.800
want to make sure we spend it well. We have
gotten a lot of money out the door, and maybe

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.020
some in wasteful ways, but I think we have
gotten it out the door, which is the important

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.020
thing.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.330
But pausing to see what's working and what's
not working seems to be the better part of

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:55.860
wisdom here. I'm focusing especially on young
people. A lot of people next fall, a lot of

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.330
young adults will be without school and without
jobs.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:03.430
And this strikes me as the perfect moment
to do an emergency national service program

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:08.520
to employ a lot of young people, maybe to
help with the effects of the pandemics, the

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.120
track and trace. But these are the kind of
screaming needs that are out there in the

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.580
country right now.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.810
And I think it's time right now to do something.
But figuring out exactly what can wait a week

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.970
or two, but I do think definitely more will
be needed.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:27.880
JUDY WOODRUFF: And more federal money, Mark,
whether it's for national service, as David

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:33.459
is describing, or more aid for these -- for
these state governments, local governments

00:09:33.459 --> 00:09:36.190
that are really pinched right now.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.280
MARK SHIELDS: They're very pinched, Judy.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.680
Mitch McConnell talks about the blue state
bailout. If we want to be blunt about it,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:50.980
the giver and the getter states, the states
that get money from Washington, Mitch McConnell's

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:57.240
Kentucky is right at the top, $146 billion
over the past four years, by the Rockefeller

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.240
Institute.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.899
At the same time, those blue states, those
terrible blue states, like New York, sent

00:10:03.899 --> 00:10:09.940
$116 billion more to Washington than they
have ever gotten back. Massachusetts has sent

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:16.830
$47 billion more. So has Connecticut, 71 -- I'm
sorry -- New Jersey, $71 billion, Connecticut.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:22.100
All the blue states spend more money. If Mitch
McConnell wants us to be every man and person

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.540
for himself, then let's let those states keep
their money. They'd be in perfect shape if

00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.630
New York had an extra $116 billion.

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:37.680
When we have an earthquake in this country,
when we have a tidal wave or a hurricane,

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:41.420
we aid the states. We come together. And that's
what's happened.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:46.160
I mean, the states bear an enormous burden
in our public services in this state -- in

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.490
our country, in our system. And they have
got to -- the Congress has to step up and

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:52.959
provide the money for them.

00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:58.769
This is a Republican Senate, let it be noted,
that put a $135 billion tax cut in, in the

00:10:58.769 --> 00:11:03.860
bailout bill to help small businesses and
families for the top 1 percent. In order to

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:08.050
qualify for it, you had to at least make $10,000
a week.

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:14.980
Now, if that's somehow OK, but not helping
schools and health systems and first responders,

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.500
I don't see the value.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:19.690
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will find out more
next week.

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.560
The Senate is coming back into session. The
House is not, on the advice of, I guess, the

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.920
House -- the congressional physician. But
the Senate is coming back, and maybe we will

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.250
learn a little more.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.029
Mark Shields, David Brooks, thank you both.
Please stay safe.

00:11:32.029 --> 00:11:33.340
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.
