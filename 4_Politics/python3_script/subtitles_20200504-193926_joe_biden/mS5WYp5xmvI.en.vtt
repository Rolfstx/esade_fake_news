00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.170
- It happens to me all the time

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:04.170
and it happened just this week.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.430
A young person I'd never
met introduced himself to me

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.270
and said that when he saw our guest today,

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.260
on an earlier episode of this program,

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.243
he felt he was seeing a
man who knew how to think.

00:00:16.243 --> 00:00:20.028
Dr. Thomas Sowell on
Uncommon Knowledge now.

00:00:20.028 --> 00:00:22.861
(classical music)

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.910
Welcome to Uncommon Knowledge.

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.650
I'm Peter Robinson.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.180
Thomas Sowell has studied
and taught economics,

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.160
intellectual history, and
social policy in institutions

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.883
that include Cornell,
Brandeis, UCLA, and Amherst.

00:00:42.883 --> 00:00:45.160
Now a senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.915
Dr. Sowell has published
more than a dozen books,

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.230
including the classic
a conflict of visions.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.900
Coming soon, a revised edition
of his most recent volume,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.067
Discrimination and Disparities.

00:00:57.067 --> 00:00:58.840
Tom Sowell, welcome.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.026
- Thank you.

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:03.990
- You grew up in Harlem,
dropped out of high school

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.190
to join the Marine Corps
during the Korean War,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.702
received an undergraduate
degree from Harvard,

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:11.856
a masters from Columbia,

00:01:11.856 --> 00:01:15.228
and your doctorate from
the University of Chicago.

00:01:15.228 --> 00:01:18.530
All of which pales by
comparison with the fact

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.909
that you once tried out
for the Brooklyn Dodgers.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.860
(laughing)

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.550
But during this period from Harlem

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.210
to the University of Chicago,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.150
throughout your 20s you've said,

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.670
you spent most of the decade
of your 20s as a Marxist.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.060
- Yes.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.893
- Why?

00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:36.730
What was it...

00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:39.800
what was the attraction?

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.398
- Well I guess I first was...

00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:44.300
very puzzled.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.670
See there's one little
correction I would make.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.670
At age 16 I was a dropout,
high school dropout,

00:01:51.872 --> 00:01:56.872
and I went to work full time
as a Western Union messenger.

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:02.120
- Delivering telegrams.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.953
- Delivering telegrams.

00:02:02.953 --> 00:02:04.680
- We better say that because
there will be a generation

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.550
that won't know what Western
Union was, but go ahead.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.700
- Yeah that's true too.

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.870
And so I were I worked
in the area of Manhattan

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.090
called Chelsea district,

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.920
which is around 23rd Street, ninth Avenue,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.350
and at the end of the day

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.680
I had several ways of getting back home.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.510
The easiest and fastest
way was with a subway,

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.890
which was a nickel in those days.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.618
When I was feeling flushed I
might go for a bus for a dime

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.250
and then when I was
really getting reckless

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.790
I would take the fifth Avenue bus,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.760
which was the elite of
the buses for 15 cents.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.500
So I would walk over the fifth avenue,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.981
take that bus, and it would take me up

00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:48.890
through all the glamorous
parts of fifth avenue,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.769
past the Empire State Building,

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.133
past the great stores
and things of that sort.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:58.393
And then on 57th Street it would turn

00:02:58.393 --> 00:03:02.020
and this is just a the elite part of town.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.820
- Sure, right there what park starts.

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.577
- Yes and then...

00:03:05.577 --> 00:03:07.370
park starts at 59th.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.203
- Oh, sorry.

00:03:08.203 --> 00:03:10.190
- 57th that would turn over,

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.871
again, the same kind of
scene, pass Carnegie Hall.

00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:17.550
Columbus Circle, there was
no Trump Tower at that time,

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.238
and on up to about 72nd Street

00:03:20.238 --> 00:03:24.630
and out to Riverside Drive
which is another elite area.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.050
So four miles after that
you'd have all these

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.820
wonderful luxury apartment
buildings and so on.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.607
And finally around 129th, 30th street,

00:03:34.607 --> 00:03:38.310
it would go on a long viaduct

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.040
and then he would do a right turn

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.580
back into the occupied area

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.393
and there you'd see the tenements.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.120
And I would wonder why is this?

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.913
I mean, why this huge disparity?

00:03:50.913 --> 00:03:53.682
And there was nobody else,

00:03:53.682 --> 00:03:56.830
there was no other other
explanation around.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.720
There was nothing there
other than Marxism.

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.870
I stumbled across, I had not read Marx,

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.870
but I bought a secondhand
pair, set of Encyclopedias.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.560
Small set for some ridiculously low price

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.970
and there they met I looked up Karl Marx,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.540
I'd heard the name and
the stuff that he said

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.883
seemed to make sense.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.283
And later on I would get
more and more into it.

00:04:27.553 --> 00:04:31.110
And the argument was that
the rich had gotten rich

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.270
by taking from the poor.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.910
And well that was one explanation,
but what is interesting,

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.730
there was no other
explanation out there really.

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:42.650
And that's true largely in our
colleges/universities today.

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.910
- But so by the time you
went to Harvard undergrad,

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.913
well so wait, you drop
out at the age of 16,

00:04:48.913 --> 00:04:52.570
and you start reading
Marx in your late teens.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.550
- I start reading Marx, yes, at age 19.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.050
- Age 19 and then you're
in the Marine Corps

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:03.428
for a couple years, what
was it, two, three years?

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:04.261
- Two years.

00:05:04.261 --> 00:05:08.210
It was actually one year,
11 months, and five days,

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.501
but who's counting.

00:05:09.501 --> 00:05:10.987
(laughing)

00:05:10.987 --> 00:05:13.830
- So by the time you went to Harvard

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.820
you had already become
intellectually engaged with Marxism.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:18.653
- Yes.

00:05:18.653 --> 00:05:21.450
- And remained, and Harvard
didn't talk you out of it

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.730
and the study of economics at Harvard

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:24.900
didn't talk you out of it,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.680
nor did getting a master's at Columbia,

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.120
nor did getting a doctorate at Chicago

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.820
dissuade you from Marxism.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.450
And you studied with Milton
Friedman of all people,

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.617
how could you have sat in
Milton Friedman's classroom

00:05:36.617 --> 00:05:38.300
and remained a Marxist?

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.883
- Some people are just stubborn.

00:05:39.883 --> 00:05:41.780
(laughs)

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.141
But what really changed me

00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:46.506
was not the University of Chicago,

00:05:46.506 --> 00:05:51.045
it was my first job working
in a professional capacity

00:05:51.045 --> 00:05:52.120
for the government.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.670
I was a summer intern.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.350
- This is after Chicago or?

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.020
- No, no, while I was
still a graduate student.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.420
- Got it.

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:00.300
- And so during the summer vacation

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.040
I worked in the US Department of Labor

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.891
and I began to realize,
a number of things,

00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.640
that the government is not
simply the personification

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.200
of the general will
like Rousseau or others.

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.490
The government is an institution,

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.322
the government institutions

00:06:17.322 --> 00:06:20.220
have their own institutional interests.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.360
One involved in minimum wage law.

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.320
I was a big supporter of that,

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.210
but I also knew that there was
an argument that minimum wage

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.894
laws simply price low
wage workers out of a job

00:06:30.894 --> 00:06:34.557
and my first assignment
dealt with minimum wages

00:06:34.557 --> 00:06:38.210
in Puerto Rico and as I
looked at the numbers,

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.410
I would see as they would
jack up the minimum wage,

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:43.680
number of jobs would go down and so forth,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.290
but there were two explanations.

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:46.850
One was that of the economists

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.660
that you priced the people out of a job

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.070
and the other was that were hurricanes

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.830
that come through Puerto Rico, you see,

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:59.080
during the sugar harvesting and therefore,

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.660
and I was studying the sugar industry,

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:03.080
and therefore it destroyed
a lot of the crop,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:05.310
therefore you wouldn't
hire as many workers.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.700
Now in Chicago I'd been taught that

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.560
if there are two different theories,

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.860
there should be some empirical
evidence in principle

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.840
that could distinguish what
would happen under one theory

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.610
from what would happen under the other.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.640
And so I wrestled with that
for the most of the summer

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.860
and one morning I came
in and I said, I got it.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:25.840
We need a data on the amount of sugarcane

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.440
standing in the fields
before the hurricane struck

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.310
and as I waited for the congratulations

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.090
I could see stricken looks
around me in the room,

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.513
like this guy has stumbled on something

00:07:35.513 --> 00:07:37.606
that will ruin us all.

00:07:37.606 --> 00:07:40.550
(laughing)

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.380
And they said well, we
don't have those data.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.720
I said, oh, I'll bet the
Department of Agriculture has it.

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:48.071
He said, well, but that
doesn't mean we have it.

00:07:48.071 --> 00:07:51.830
You'd have to have a request
go off the chain of command

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:53.390
to the Secretary of Labor.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.130
He would then confer it with
the Secretary of Agriculture.

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:58.030
It would come down the chain of command

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:59.880
and the Department of Agriculture,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.880
whoever has those numbers and so on.

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.830
I said, good, well they say
a journey of a thousand miles

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:06.380
begins with a single step

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.570
so I will now submit my request
to the Secretary of Labor,

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:10.820
which I did.

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.959
And I am still patiently
awaiting this reply.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:15.383
(laughs)

00:08:15.383 --> 00:08:17.540
- And the institutional
fear of the number was what?

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:19.890
- Oh, the US Department of Labor

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:21.690
administers the minimum wage law

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:26.550
and the money and the
careers of perhaps a third

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.850
or some other significant percentage

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.520
of the Labor Department's other sources

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.770
come from administering
the minimum wage law.

00:08:34.727 --> 00:08:36.850
One of the real forces of all this is

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:40.280
that the law itself,
section 4D I still remember,

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:43.590
requires a Labor Department to
study the employment effects

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.834
of minimum wages and those
studies are absolutely a farce.

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:49.962
In fact some years after I left,

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:54.554
I did an article saying why
those studies were a farce

00:08:54.554 --> 00:08:56.270
and when I came back later on

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:57.900
to the Labor Department
to do some research,

00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:00.420
one of the older librarians
who remembered me

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.710
turn to the younger
librarian and she said,

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:04.420
this is the man who wrote that article

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:06.621
that has everybody up in arms.

00:09:06.621 --> 00:09:08.310
(laughs)

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:13.110
- So you began to be dissuaded of Marxism.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.900
- And of government in general

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:18.420
because the government is not out there

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:21.343
at the personification
of the national interest.

00:09:21.343 --> 00:09:23.100
They have their own interests

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.600
and the Labor Department's was clearly

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.600
an interest in keeping the minimum wage,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.250
because that's their jobs
and careers and power.

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:33.720
- In your, which brings us if I may,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.830
to one of my favorite
books, your 2000 book,

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:37.640
this is a beat-up old copy.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.028
This book A Conflict of Visions.

00:09:40.028 --> 00:09:40.861
- Yes.

00:09:40.861 --> 00:09:43.140
- Which you published in 2007
and you layout, I'm sorry.

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.010
- 1987.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.460
- I beg your pardon, 1987?

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:47.370
- Reprinted in 2007.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.650
- Well beat up is this book,
it turns out this is a reprint.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.981
Sorry, 1987.

00:09:52.981 --> 00:09:57.350
And you lay out two competing
ways of looking at economics

00:09:57.350 --> 00:10:00.120
and policy, really two competing
ways of looking at life

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.450
that go back at least 200 years.

00:10:02.450 --> 00:10:06.111
The constrained vision and
the unconstrained vision.

00:10:06.111 --> 00:10:07.670
The constrained vision,

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:09.360
I'm quoting from A Conflict of Visions

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.650
sees the evils of the world
as deriving from the limited

00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:17.790
and unhappy choices available
given the inherent moral

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.910
and intellectual
limitations of human beings.

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:22.290
Close quote.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:27.279
So the constrained vision
understands itself as constrained

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:29.858
by the limitations of reality itself.

00:10:29.858 --> 00:10:30.948
- Yes.

00:10:30.948 --> 00:10:31.930
- That's correct?

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:32.763
- Yes.

00:10:33.655 --> 00:10:36.500
In other words, they cannot
proceed as so many do

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.480
that good things happen automatically,

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:41.009
but bad things are somebody's fault.

00:10:41.009 --> 00:10:44.290
- Got it, got it, and
then to continue here,

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.890
the constrained vision,

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:48.569
again quoting from A Conflict Of Visions,

00:10:48.569 --> 00:10:52.900
for the amelioration improvement
of the human condition,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.160
the constrained vision relies on

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.760
certain social processes
such as moral traditions,

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.800
the marketplace, or families.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.420
Not government.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.403
So explain that.

00:11:05.756 --> 00:11:10.064
Why do we rely on on processes rather than

00:11:10.064 --> 00:11:13.620
the will of the people instituting changes

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.794
to improve our condition?

00:11:15.794 --> 00:11:18.636
- Well it doesn't ignore government.

00:11:18.636 --> 00:11:22.570
Even for the market the work
you have to have a government,

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:26.100
as Europe discovered when
the Roman Empire collapsed

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.943
and the economy has collapsed also.

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:34.760
But I guess one of the reasons would be

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.580
with the government you have
surrogate decision makers

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.960
and they cannot possibly know as much

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.870
as the individuals
whose personal decisions

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.350
have been preempted.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.390
- I see, I see, all right.

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:48.830
Which brings us to the
unconstrained vision.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.953
When again, I'm quoting you,

00:11:50.953 --> 00:11:53.735
when Rousseau said that man is born free

00:11:53.735 --> 00:11:54.568
but everywhere in chains,

00:11:55.992 --> 00:11:58.740
he expressed the essence of
the unconstrained vision,

00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.210
in which the fundamental
problem is not nature

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.850
or man but institutions.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:05.590
Would you explain that one?

00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.490
- Well he has the notion that, again,

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.180
that good things happen naturally

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:13.270
and if they're bad things it's because

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.220
institutions including civilization itself

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.780
have have made these bad things happen.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:23.410
And I think that that's
really the implicit assumption

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:26.672
behind a lot of things that
are said on the left today.

00:12:26.672 --> 00:12:30.560
And why in my most recent
book I go to a lot of trouble

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.700
to show that in nature there is nothing

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.710
resembling equal opportunity.

00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.810
That wherever you look around the country,

00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:42.180
around the world, you find people

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.090
who live up in the mountains
poor and backwards,

00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.351
even in the richest countries.

00:12:47.351 --> 00:12:49.860
Including the United States.

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.890
I believe the poorest
country in the United States,

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.190
county rather, was in
a mountain community,

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:59.343
which was almost 100% white.

00:13:00.210 --> 00:13:03.920
- Somewhere in Appalachia,
West Virginia, Southern Ohio.

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:08.521
- Yes and men in that
county had a life expectancy

00:13:08.521 --> 00:13:13.521
10 years less than men
in a county in Virginia.

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:20.464
- And the unconstrained
vision says let's fix that.

00:13:20.464 --> 00:13:23.070
Surely we can pass a law
that would improve that

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.614
and the constrained vision
says well now wait a moment,

00:13:25.614 --> 00:13:29.990
if people who live in
isolated pockets in mountains

00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:33.210
are poor and backwards
all around the world

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.860
and we see this pattern over
and over and over again,

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:38.750
maybe there's something very
deeply rooted in reality

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.920
about that that's hard for us to get at.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.753
Correct?

00:13:42.753 --> 00:13:43.586
- Yes.

00:13:43.586 --> 00:13:44.419
- All right.

00:13:44.419 --> 00:13:47.143
So in the book of A Conflict of Visions,

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:51.760
you're very dispassionate
and very analytical

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.420
and you lay out the unconstrained vision

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.790
and you lay out the constrained vision

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.284
and you don't really come out blazing

00:14:00.284 --> 00:14:02.575
in favor of one or the other.

00:14:02.575 --> 00:14:05.630
- That is not a book meant to commit to

00:14:05.630 --> 00:14:09.140
show one vision is better than the other.

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.380
It's there to show you what what they are

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:15.750
and what you're assuming if you
go one direction or another.

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:17.780
It's to encourage people to understand

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:20.670
the implicit assumptions behind all this

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.210
without which you're just loose ends.

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.522
- All right.

00:14:25.522 --> 00:14:29.610
So pondering all this I noticed something,

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:33.000
a column that you wrote,
this is a couple years ago,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.490
in which you rebutted Nicholas
Kristof of the New York Times

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.890
and Kristof had ascribed the gaps

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:42.680
between African-Americans
and whites in America,

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.840
gaps in wealth, gaps in
educational achievement,

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.990
the usual gaps and this is
a quotation from Kristof,

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.330
to the lingering effects
of slavery, close quote.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:52.681
- Oh yeah.

00:14:52.681 --> 00:14:55.150
- And here's Tom Sowell, quote,

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.011
if we wanted to be serious about evidence,

00:14:59.011 --> 00:15:02.250
we might compare where
blacks stood a hundred years

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:04.870
after the end of slavery
with where they stood

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.520
after 30 years of the
liberal welfare state.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.310
In other words, we could
compare hard evidence

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.490
on the legacy of slavery
with hard evidence

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.710
on the legacy of liberals.

00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:16.630
Close quote.

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:18.940
And so there it is, life is hard.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:22.670
You use the word hard,
you use the words serious,

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:24.670
you use evidence.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:27.260
Tom Sowell is a man of
the constrained vision

00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:28.760
through and through and through, correct?

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:29.740
- Yes.

00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:30.573
- No, no...

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.513
- Yes.

00:15:32.513 --> 00:15:35.740
Part of a vanishing breed I might add.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:40.740
- So when you were a
Marxist, explain that,

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.546
because the Marxism...

00:15:42.546 --> 00:15:43.702
- Well but no, no.

00:15:43.702 --> 00:15:45.178
- So that's complicated.

00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:46.011
- Even when I was a Marxist,

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:48.700
I had the same intellectual standards

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.760
and that's what eventually
led me away from it.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:52.620
- Oh, I see.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.040
- In other words I hadn't
done all the research,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.070
I hadn't gone around the world--

00:15:57.070 --> 00:15:58.280
- Looking for evidence.

00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.350
- Yes, yes.

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:01.110
- Okay so...

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.910
- And so socialism is a great idea.

00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:05.810
That does not mean it's a great reality.

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:09.460
One of the things that disturbs
me tremendously is about

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:13.100
this enthusiasm for Bernie
Sanders and socialism

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.723
at a time when people are
literally starving in Venezuela,

00:16:16.723 --> 00:16:19.117
an oil-rich country.

00:16:19.117 --> 00:16:23.530
And you know they're
breaking into grocery stores

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:25.750
to try to get food and they're fleeing

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:27.100
to neighboring countries,

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.310
most of which are not all
that prosperous themselves,

00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.280
but at least you don't
starve to death in them.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.974
And none of that makes
a bit of difference.

00:16:35.974 --> 00:16:38.030
I don't think most of these
people who are out there

00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:39.550
cheering for Bernie Sanders

00:16:39.550 --> 00:16:42.060
have given a thought to Venezuela.

00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:43.010
- To the evidence.

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:43.843
- That's right.

00:16:45.873 --> 00:16:50.150
- Which brings us to
something that you refer to

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:53.400
in a number of columns
as the retrogression.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.560
The experience of
African-Americans in this country.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.240
Economic progress, I'm quoting you.

00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:01.930
Despite the grand myth that
black economic progress

00:17:01.930 --> 00:17:04.200
began or accelerated
with the passage of the

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.315
Civil Rights laws and the
'War on Poverty' programs

00:17:07.315 --> 00:17:10.370
of the 1960's, the fact
is that the poverty rate

00:17:10.370 --> 00:17:15.370
among blacks fell from 87%
in 1940 to 47% in 1960,

00:17:15.985 --> 00:17:19.260
but over the next 20 years
the poverty rate among blacks

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.610
fell another 18% points.

00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:25.685
This was just the continuation
of a previous economic trend,

00:17:25.685 --> 00:17:28.940
but at a slower rate of progress.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.850
It was not some grand deliverance.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:34.505
Close quote.

00:17:34.505 --> 00:17:39.505
That is so counter to what
we are taught in school,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.625
what appears on the editorial
pages of newspapers.

00:17:43.625 --> 00:17:44.880
(laughs)

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:46.730
I feel as though I want to ask you,

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.979
you really want to stick
with that assertion.

00:17:49.979 --> 00:17:54.070
- I have more evidence
in my most recent book,

00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:56.070
Discrimination and Disparities,

00:17:56.070 --> 00:17:57.920
I point out that this really is a pattern

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.847
not peculiar to blacks or
even to the United States,

00:18:00.847 --> 00:18:03.130
but you can see the same thing in England.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.730
You can see it in any
number of other countries,

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.310
that the poor we're much
worse off economically.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:11.970
Let's say on the first
day after the 20th century

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.620
and yet the in terms of their own behavior

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:19.564
they were far more decent societies.

00:18:19.564 --> 00:18:24.564
And afterwards, after this welfare state,

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.620
they're supposed to make them better off,

00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:28.870
and better human beings.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:31.400
That's when the crime rates skyrocketed

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.053
on both sides of the Atlantic.

00:18:33.902 --> 00:18:36.478
The British were famous for being

00:18:36.478 --> 00:18:41.478
perhaps the most polite,
considerate society in the world

00:18:42.486 --> 00:18:44.084
prior to that.

00:18:44.084 --> 00:18:48.760
After that, you get things
like the 2011 riots over there.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:50.780
Went through London Manchester

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:55.780
where they anticipated
Ferguson and Baltimore

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.290
by a few years.

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:04.430
And the same things, the
burning down of buildings,

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.800
the throwing of gasoline bombs at police,

00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:09.680
the whole schmear and none of those people

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.030
were descendants of slaves.

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.777
- So poor people were doing things,

00:19:15.777 --> 00:19:18.160
the lesson of the 20th
century is something like

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.300
poor people, including in this
country African-Americans,

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.600
we're improving their lot

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.920
and leading fundamentally decent lives

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.018
until the government decided to help them?

00:19:27.018 --> 00:19:28.700
- Yes.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.400
- That's a fair statement.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.361
- They're better off economically

00:19:33.361 --> 00:19:35.710
because of what's been given,

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:39.141
but of course when you
have the crime rate,

00:19:39.141 --> 00:19:43.030
I mean I got I got the first
inkling of this some years back

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:46.627
when I was a at some school
in Harlem doing some research

00:19:46.627 --> 00:19:50.560
and I looked out the window
and I mentioned in passing

00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.690
that when I was a little kid

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.860
I used to walk my dog in that park

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.681
and looks of horror came
over the students faces.

00:19:57.681 --> 00:20:01.820
Nobody in his right
mind would have a child

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.106
going to that park walking a dog or not.

00:20:05.106 --> 00:20:07.260
The principal was warning these students

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.010
not to cross this park,

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:11.780
which is about a block a half wide.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.842
Even in groups of six.

00:20:13.842 --> 00:20:17.970
And when I tell them about
how in these hot summer nights

00:20:17.970 --> 00:20:20.370
I would sleep out on the
fire escapes in Harlem,

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:23.760
they looked at me like
I was a man from Mars.

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:26.230
People were are doing
that all over New York.

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.370
They were doing it in
Philadelphia, Washington,

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:29.900
wherever I've known people.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.420
That was a common thing.

00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.690
We didn't have the money
for air conditioning.

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.090
You slept out and on a fire
escape or in the parks.

00:20:37.090 --> 00:20:38.620
Where Walter grew up in a--

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.530
- Walter Williams.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:43.040
- Walter Williams grew
up in a housing project

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.220
in Philadelphia.

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.130
He was saying on the hot summer
nights the people would be,

00:20:47.130 --> 00:20:49.290
in this project we had little balconies,

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:50.690
they'd sleep out on the balconies

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.380
and the ones on the first
floor who didn't have balconies

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.610
would sleep out in the yard.

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:58.120
And that there were old
men who you could see sit

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:00.940
on a hot summer night sitting outdoors

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:04.987
into the wee hours playing
cards or checkers or whatever.

00:21:04.987 --> 00:21:07.066
it was a different world.

00:21:07.066 --> 00:21:09.000
- It was a safe world.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.810
- Infinitely safer.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.140
- Now what about family structure?

00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.490
Tom again, I'm quoting you.

00:21:14.363 --> 00:21:15.490
Most black children were being raised in

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.910
two-parent families in 1960.

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.900
30 years after the liberal welfare state,

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:21.210
the great majority of black children

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:23.633
were being raised by single parents.

00:21:23.633 --> 00:21:25.670
What's the, how does that,

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:30.239
by the way we should note
that Patrick Moynihan

00:21:30.239 --> 00:21:34.070
publishes the Moynihan report in 1965

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:37.800
and he's alarmed because
the illegitimacy rate

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.060
among black families is 25% then.

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:44.613
Now among whites it's over a third,

00:21:44.613 --> 00:21:47.500
Hispanics it's over half
and among African-Americans

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.030
it's over 70%.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.600
What's going on there?

00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:52.070
- Well this is again, this too,

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.595
you find the same thing in Britain,

00:21:54.595 --> 00:21:56.410
you find it in France and Norway,

00:21:56.410 --> 00:21:58.060
you find it in the Western world.

00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.080
In fact--

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.730
- Their dissolution of
the family structure.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:05.000
- Oh yeah, there are a
number of Western nations

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.764
where 40% of the children are
raised with only one parent.

00:22:09.764 --> 00:22:14.764
At the extremes, I
compared Asian countries.

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.670
At the extremes Iceland, it's
two out of three children

00:22:19.670 --> 00:22:22.610
are born are raised in single-parent home.

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:25.610
In South Korea is one out of 66.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:26.443
- Wow.

00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:30.728
Wow and so that's the welfare state?

00:22:30.728 --> 00:22:32.060
- [Tom] Yes.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.061
- It is.

00:22:33.061 --> 00:22:36.161
- You're creating a situation where the...

00:22:36.161 --> 00:22:41.161
first of all, well you're
creating a situation

00:22:41.199 --> 00:22:43.759
where if the man stays there,

00:22:43.759 --> 00:22:46.942
the government will not
give the woman welfare

00:22:46.942 --> 00:22:50.120
and if he leaves he it will.

00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:51.469
And so they're paying,

00:22:51.469 --> 00:22:54.100
when you pay people not to get married,

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:55.880
more people don't get married.

00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.043
- Right, right.

00:22:57.996 --> 00:22:59.810
Okay so what would have happened

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.200
if Lyndon Johnson instead
of becoming a liberal

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:09.040
had remained a crusty tough
skeptical Texas conservative,

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.380
which is certainly the
way he started his career.

00:23:11.380 --> 00:23:15.198
If Lyndon Johnson had embraced
the constrained vision

00:23:15.198 --> 00:23:18.480
instead of instituting the war on poverty

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.210
and the Great Society and so forth,

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:21.990
what would the country look like today?

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.823
- A lot better.

00:23:22.823 --> 00:23:25.530
You would not have the same
rates of crime and so on

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:28.150
because you see, you
can't have a welfare state

00:23:28.150 --> 00:23:29.740
in a democratic country

00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:32.690
unless you first have
a welfare state vision

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:36.010
and when you buy all the
assumptions of that vision,

00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.830
then you're buying a lot of trouble.

00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:40.100
One of the episodes I think epitomized,

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.200
it was in France in this case,

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:44.930
that there were knife
attacks by various people

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.480
from North Africa against Chinese people

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.756
in some suburb of Paris.

00:23:49.756 --> 00:23:53.980
And one of the things
that the attacker said,

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.160
you know, why are you
attacking the Chinese?

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.630
And it wasn't because anything
the Chinese had done to them.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.190
He said they have nice
clothes and big cars,

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:03.383
that's not fair.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.188
I mean that's you know,

00:24:06.188 --> 00:24:09.549
egalitarianism as a
philosophy is one thing

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:12.094
but the actual consequences of it

00:24:12.094 --> 00:24:16.732
mean things like resenting
other people's good fortune.

00:24:16.732 --> 00:24:20.910
- All right so one response to the gap,

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:24.330
again I return to this gap
between African Americans

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:26.200
and other Americans.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.730
Affirmative action.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.403
Which brings us back to
your alma mater, Harvard.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.240
According--

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.220
- I'll never live it down.

00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.560
- You'll never live it down, yes.

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.630
You once told me that
the principle benefit

00:24:37.630 --> 00:24:39.270
of a Harvard degree was never again

00:24:39.270 --> 00:24:42.063
having to be impressed by
anybody who had a Harvard degree.

00:24:42.063 --> 00:24:42.896
(laughing)

00:24:42.896 --> 00:24:43.729
- Absolutely.

00:24:43.729 --> 00:24:46.070
- These are figures that were published

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:48.290
in the Harvard Crimson,
the student newspaper.

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.040
In the Harvard class of 2019,

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:52.500
these are the kids will
be graduating next June,

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:56.750
the average SAT score for
black students was 2149.

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.120
By the way these are all good scores,

00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:02.180
but for black students
2149, white students 2218,

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.433
Asian students 2300.

00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.010
Well now that must be reasonable

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:11.750
because it's taking place at
Harvard, the seat of reason.

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.330
- Well that wasn't
quite how I described it

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.180
when I was there.

00:25:16.259 --> 00:25:18.600
- Affirmative action.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.630
Is that...

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:21.888
we ought not to be doing this?

00:25:21.888 --> 00:25:25.830
- There are various laws and policies

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:27.940
that benefit in one group
at the expense of another

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.100
ut I think affirmative
action has the distinction

00:25:31.100 --> 00:25:33.720
of being one that it harms everybody

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.860
though in different ways.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.860
And so there's a lot of evidence
that there are black kids

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:44.660
who have all the qualifications
to be successors in college,

00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:46.440
who nevertheless are failures

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.290
because they are systematically
mismatched with institutions

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.060
whose standards they don't meet.

00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.130
Even though they may
meet the standards of 80

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:57.120
or 90% of the colleges in America.

00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.610
I remember I was first aware of this

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:00.650
when I was teaching at Cornell

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.030
and I found a half the
black students at Cornell

00:26:03.030 --> 00:26:05.360
were on some kind of academic probation.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.450
And so I went over to the
administration building

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.840
to look up the SATs of these students.

00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.270
The average black student
at Cornell at that time

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:14.343
scored at the 75th percentile.

00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.610
- Which is pretty darn good.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:20.842
- Yes and so that means
that in most colleges

00:26:20.842 --> 00:26:22.340
in this country they would have no trouble

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:24.820
and many of them would
be on the Dean's List.

00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:27.670
But at Cornell, the average
a liberal arts student

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:30.890
at that time was in the 99th percentile

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:34.266
and when you're teaching
students like that,

00:26:34.266 --> 00:26:38.763
you teach at a pace that
most people of any race

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:40.965
cannot keep up with.

00:26:40.965 --> 00:26:43.500
It was always complained
that I was assigning

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:46.100
all kinds of reading but heck,

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:48.594
I'm teaching kids who are in the top 1%,

00:26:48.594 --> 00:26:52.151
they can keep up with the
reading that I'm assigning.

00:26:52.151 --> 00:26:54.990
- So Cornell was taking
very talented black kids

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.530
and spending four years teaching
them to feel inadequate.

00:26:57.530 --> 00:27:00.033
- Yes and succeeding at that.

00:27:01.561 --> 00:27:03.440
- A couple quotations.

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.610
These are both from the
last affirmative action case

00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:06.800
to reach the Supreme Court,

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.383
last big affirmative action
case to reach the Supreme Court.

00:27:09.383 --> 00:27:12.270
2003 Grutter versus Bollinger.

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:13.540
Here's the majority opinion,

00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:15.700
which was written by
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor,

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.670
quote: "The court expects
that 25 years from now

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:24.830
the use of racial preferences
will no longer be necessary."

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:27.980
This upholding the use of
in a decision, 5-4 decision,

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:30.230
upholding the use of racial preferences.

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:31.460
Now, that's quotation one.

00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:33.660
Here's quotation two, Justice Thomas.

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.340
Justice Clarence Thomas in a dissent.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.627
Quote: "I believe that blacks can achieve

00:27:39.627 --> 00:27:42.217
"in every avenue of American life

00:27:42.217 --> 00:27:45.487
"without the meddling of
university administrators.

00:27:45.487 --> 00:27:47.447
"The Court holds that
racial discrimination

00:27:47.447 --> 00:27:50.617
"and admissions should be
given another 25 years.

00:27:50.617 --> 00:27:53.307
"While I agree that in
25 years these practices

00:27:53.307 --> 00:27:56.589
"will be illegal, they are illegal now."

00:27:56.589 --> 00:27:58.430
(laughing)

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:59.960
Close quote.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.810
So here's...

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.270
what do you do with the argument

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.610
that Justice O'Connor writing
that majority opinion,

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:10.590
there's something of the
constrained vision there.

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:13.270
Look we have these, all
universities across the country

00:28:13.270 --> 00:28:15.857
are using these racial preferences

00:28:15.857 --> 00:28:18.177
as the basis of admission.

00:28:18.177 --> 00:28:20.810
The best we can hope to do is tell them

00:28:20.810 --> 00:28:22.170
they ought not to be doing it.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.030
That they should be
developing other standards

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:26.320
and give them a clock.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:27.470
(laughing)

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.335
Is that a reasonable thing to do?

00:28:29.335 --> 00:28:32.370
- No, but it's a universal thing to do.

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:35.154
I wrote a book about affirmative action,

00:28:35.154 --> 00:28:37.930
it was called Affirmative
Action Around The World

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.370
and I made a couple of international trips

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.290
at the expensive of Hoover Institution

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:44.900
around the world to check
out affirmative action.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:47.190
This is one of the most common arguments.

00:28:47.190 --> 00:28:50.260
It is absolutely fallacious
time and time again.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.460
The argument like so much
in the unconstrained vision,

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:57.260
it assumes that we have a
power that we do not have,

00:28:57.260 --> 00:28:59.832
cannot have, and never have had.

00:28:59.832 --> 00:29:02.657
In England there was a man named Scarm

00:29:02.657 --> 00:29:05.700
and it was saying for the
now we must do this in order.

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.744
And in many countries
these programs was set up

00:29:09.744 --> 00:29:12.070
with an actual cutoff date,

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:15.210
so it was set up in
Malaysia with a cut-off date

00:29:15.210 --> 00:29:19.953
I think of around 1990 and in Pakistan

00:29:19.953 --> 00:29:22.610
it was supposed to go for 10 years.

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:27.610
None of those cut off
dates has meant a thing.

00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.890
These programs not only
continue, they increase.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:32.170
They spread.

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:35.328
So the idea that you
can control the future

00:29:35.328 --> 00:29:38.770
because of these wonderful sounding words.

00:29:38.770 --> 00:29:41.330
I can't think of a country in the world

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.590
where that's ever happened.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.210
In the case of Pakistan,

00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:48.486
they did have an actual cutoff date

00:29:48.486 --> 00:29:51.510
and because people in
the East Pakistan were,

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:53.610
for whatever historical reason,

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.910
way behind the people in West Pakistan,

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:59.350
and so there's these preferences
with East Pakistanis.

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:01.410
Now before time for this thing to expire.

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.833
The East Pakistanis succeed from Pakistan

00:30:04.833 --> 00:30:07.830
and form of a new nation to Bangladesh.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.190
And the preferences continued right on

00:30:10.190 --> 00:30:12.860
because there were other
groups had been added to it

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:14.990
and so once you get the constituency,

00:30:14.990 --> 00:30:17.396
you can't say no to them.

00:30:17.396 --> 00:30:22.396
It is an argument that
has never worked out

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:24.750
anywhere that I've been able to check.

00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:25.583
- All right.

00:30:25.583 --> 00:30:28.340
So Tom Sowell says no
to the welfare state,

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.385
no to affirmative action.

00:30:30.385 --> 00:30:32.440
What is to be done?

00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.880
And now you were kind
enough to share with me

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:37.900
the galleys of your forthcoming edition of

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:39.960
Discrimination and Disparities.

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.340
Let me give you a few quotations from

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.340
some of the new chapter in that book.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:49.287
Quote, "The poverty rate
among black married couples

00:30:49.287 --> 00:30:53.397
"has been less than 10%
every year since 1994.

00:30:53.397 --> 00:30:56.587
"As far back as 1969, young black males

00:30:56.587 --> 00:30:58.937
"whose homes included
newspapers, magazines,

00:30:58.937 --> 00:31:01.357
"and library cards had similar incomes

00:31:01.357 --> 00:31:03.687
"to those of their white counterparts.

00:31:03.687 --> 00:31:06.577
"Academic outcomes show
a pattern of disparities

00:31:06.577 --> 00:31:08.855
"similar to the pattern of disparities

00:31:08.855 --> 00:31:13.067
"in the amount of time
devoted to school work.

00:31:13.067 --> 00:31:18.067
"Apparently lifestyle
choices have consequences."

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.750
Close quote.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:22.454
So this is the constrained
vision once again.

00:31:22.454 --> 00:31:26.860
Welfare state that's government,
we don't rely on that.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:30.360
Affirmative action, government,
we don't rely on that.

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.437
We rely on hard work.

00:31:32.437 --> 00:31:35.782
We rely on the institution of marriage.

00:31:35.782 --> 00:31:38.260
That's correct?

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.647
- Yes, in other words these things

00:31:39.647 --> 00:31:42.150
and I don't think it's
the marriage as such,

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:44.400
the library cards as such.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:47.530
It's that there are lifestyle
choices that have been made

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:49.870
and the comparison I made was between,

00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:52.522
if you look at the
poverty rate among blacks,

00:31:52.522 --> 00:31:56.461
it was a 22% and among whites was 11%,

00:31:56.461 --> 00:31:59.863
but among black married
couples it was 7.5%.

00:31:59.863 --> 00:32:03.160
So not only do better
than blacks as a whole,

00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:05.110
they do better than whites as a whole,

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:08.110
and so it's lifestyle choices.

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.060
Similarly with the
results and some of these

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:13.460
more successful charter schools

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:16.550
that you have these kids not only meeting

00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:19.350
but exceeding the national standards

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:23.530
in places like Harlem
and in the South Bronx.

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:27.410
And these are not kids who
are skimming the cream.

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:29.479
They're kids chosen by lottery.

00:32:29.479 --> 00:32:32.020
They don't even test them for ability.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.180
They don't even look at
their academic records.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.690
They take it into the schools

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:37.700
and they and they have hard work

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.660
and they make it clear at the outset

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.390
and they don't tolerate a
lot of nonsensical behavior

00:32:42.390 --> 00:32:45.440
and these kids are doing incredibly.

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.000
- So Tom, here...

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.440
Again, I think back to the Moynihan,

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.140
well no I think the
Moynihan report in '65,

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.820
and he was very alarmed
by the illegitimacy rate

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.740
of 25% among African-Americans.

00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:01.830
By the way in fairness
to the late Moynihan,

00:33:01.830 --> 00:33:04.240
we should point out, one
reason he was alarmed by this

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.620
was his own father had
walked out on the family

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:07.620
when he was 10 years old.

00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:11.210
He experienced what it
meant to be two kids

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:12.270
to have one parent.

00:33:12.270 --> 00:33:15.370
Okay and now it's all
gotten dramatically worse

00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:18.542
for whites and Hispanics
and blacks, for everybody.

00:33:18.542 --> 00:33:21.440
And then I think back beyond that

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:24.030
to your experience of Harlem.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:27.532
You drop out of high school and do what?

00:33:27.532 --> 00:33:29.490
Go on welfare?

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.150
Start cashing, no.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:34.460
You went to work and you
spent some of that money

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.253
to buy some inexpensive Encyclopedias.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.868
And Harlem was so...

00:33:40.868 --> 00:33:45.868
but I feel this counsel, it's
almost a counsel of despair

00:33:46.148 --> 00:33:50.270
in that world just seems
so utterly vanished.

00:33:50.270 --> 00:33:51.620
- No question.

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.420
- So your argument is if we can stand up

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:58.940
to the welfare state, we can
somehow get back to that world,

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.949
a family family structure
will reassert itself?

00:34:01.949 --> 00:34:06.330
- That that's gonna be
reconquering the same ground,

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:09.854
which is very tough to
do but it can be done.

00:34:09.854 --> 00:34:14.854
I was so lucky at the time I
had no clue about all this.

00:34:15.085 --> 00:34:17.140
I left home in 1948,

00:34:19.026 --> 00:34:24.026
many decades later I learned
that the unemployment rate

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:30.280
among black teenagers in 1948
16, 17 year olds was 9.4%.

00:34:33.684 --> 00:34:37.560
Among whites the same age it was 10.2%.

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.680
So both blacks and white
teenagers had only a fraction

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.490
of the unemployment that they have today.

00:34:44.490 --> 00:34:45.610
- You were expected to work,

00:34:45.610 --> 00:34:47.580
you were expected to be able to get a job.

00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:50.193
- And more importantly the
jobs were there for you.

00:34:51.075 --> 00:34:55.119
And this is because of a fluke really.

00:34:55.119 --> 00:34:58.120
The minimum wage law in the United States,

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.290
Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938

00:35:01.450 --> 00:35:04.730
was passed with specified rates of pay

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:06.730
that you're supposed to get.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:11.480
Almost immediately inflation
took off during the 1940s,

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.840
so by 1948 those numbers were
in the law were meaningless.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.900
- Oh I see.

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.060
- In other words when I started out

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:20.940
as a Western Union messenger,

00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:23.830
the minimum wage was 40 cents an hour.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:27.100
I started out at the
bottom at 65 cents an hour.

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.790
So it was the same as if
there was no minimum wage

00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:31.757
and this is what happened, you had this,

00:35:31.757 --> 00:35:33.700
and I was so lucky, I of course,

00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:35.690
had no clue about any of this.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:39.645
Now a black kid 20 years
later comes in there.

00:35:39.645 --> 00:35:42.750
People have become compassionate.

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:44.750
They've raised the minimum wage.

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.508
So he can't get a job.

00:35:46.508 --> 00:35:50.440
And I don't think it does
any community any good

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.346
to have a whole lot of teenage males

00:35:53.346 --> 00:35:57.043
hanging around on the streets
with no job and nothing to do.

00:35:57.043 --> 00:35:59.090
- Right.

00:35:59.090 --> 00:35:59.930
Tom so...

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:03.420
another thought here.

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:08.180
You're describing a world,
Harlem the urban world, gone.

00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:10.760
But you made visits when you were young,

00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:13.110
you knew the south as well, didn't you?

00:36:13.110 --> 00:36:15.130
You went back to the
south when you were young

00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:16.410
from time to time?

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.140
I said back to the south
because as I recall

00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:19.050
you were born in the south.

00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.530
- Yeah, I went to New York.

00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:25.010
Yeah, well I think this was
courtesy of the Marine Corps,

00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:28.700
which happened to locate the
boot camp in South Carolina

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:31.040
and had Camp Lejeune in North Carolina.

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.860
- So what I'm getting at is
you were of the generation

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.357
that saw Jim Crow with your own eyes.

00:36:36.357 --> 00:36:38.070
- Oh, no question, no question.

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:39.140
- Okay.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:42.500
So well here's, let me
read you a quotation.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.800
This is from a article
that got a lot of attention

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:48.000
in the Atlantic a couple years ago called

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.166
The Case For Reparations
by Ta-Nahesi Coates.

00:36:52.166 --> 00:36:55.867
Quote, "White supremacy
is a force so fundamental

00:36:55.867 --> 00:36:58.687
"to America that it is
difficult to imagine

00:36:58.687 --> 00:37:00.127
"the country without it.

00:37:00.127 --> 00:37:02.787
"Reparations is the price we must pay

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:05.340
"to see ourselves squarely."

00:37:05.340 --> 00:37:06.720
Close quote.

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.900
And Tom Sowell who actually
saw Jim Crow with his own eyes

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:11.970
and experienced it responds how?

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:16.970
- It would be nice to know
his evidence of what he said,

00:37:17.334 --> 00:37:19.543
just to be old-fashioned about it.

00:37:21.825 --> 00:37:24.347
No, it was a rotten system,

00:37:24.347 --> 00:37:28.747
but I don't know how we get
from that to reparations.

00:37:28.747 --> 00:37:31.898
I mean what we see in the United States

00:37:31.898 --> 00:37:36.356
in terms of the bad things,
you see all around the world.

00:37:36.356 --> 00:37:39.060
If you were to give
reparations to everyone

00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:41.770
whose ancestors had been slaves,

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.270
I suspect that you would
have to give reparations

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.770
to more than a half the entire
population of the globe.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.810
Slavery was not confined
to one set of races.

00:37:51.810 --> 00:37:54.470
I suspect that most of the
people who either were slaves

00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:56.560
or slave owners around the world

00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:58.010
were neither white nor black.

00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.480
I mean this was this was a universal curse

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.810
of the human species.

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:04.800
- Africa, the Middle East, Asia,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.367
slavery took place everywhere.

00:38:06.367 --> 00:38:11.367
- And continued elsewhere
long after it was abolished

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:13.350
in the Western countries.

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:18.350
- Let me try is sticking
with Ta-Nahesi Coates.

00:38:18.636 --> 00:38:22.670
Shelby Steele talks about white guilt.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:25.100
And in Ta-Nahesi Coates you get

00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:27.030
almost the counterpart of that,

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:31.870
a kind of African-American
claim against the white guilt

00:38:31.870 --> 00:38:33.500
and this seems...

00:38:35.210 --> 00:38:36.740
beginning with the abolitionist,

00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.500
even beginning before the Civil War,

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:43.077
you seem every generation
there's some expression

00:38:43.077 --> 00:38:47.940
that racism and slavery
as Shelby calls it,

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.666
correctly of course, the
sin of slavery is so deeply

00:38:51.666 --> 00:38:52.810
and it's something we still live with,

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.370
how do we expiate it?

00:38:54.370 --> 00:38:55.730
How do we get past it?

00:38:55.730 --> 00:38:57.810
Is there something we can do

00:38:57.810 --> 00:39:00.380
to relieve ourselves of this legacy?

00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.490
- Oh, I'd like you to repeat

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:04.320
If you were a slave owner,

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.390
I don't see any reason why
you should feel differently.

00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:10.690
On the other hand, I
can't get over the idea of

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.113
A apologizing for what B did.

00:39:13.113 --> 00:39:16.830
Even when their contemporaries much less

00:39:16.830 --> 00:39:20.183
when one is dead and the others alive.

00:39:21.263 --> 00:39:24.410
I mean Scalia I remember
was saying you know,

00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:27.936
that I owe no man anything

00:39:27.936 --> 00:39:30.670
because people who look like me

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.820
did something to people
that look like him.

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:36.205
- Okay, so just get past it.

00:39:36.205 --> 00:39:37.380
Get to work.

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.213
- Yeah.

00:39:38.213 --> 00:39:39.046
- All right.

00:39:39.046 --> 00:39:41.340
Tom Sowell's view is get an education,

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.690
stay married, and do your job.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:44.523
Roughly.

00:39:44.523 --> 00:39:45.356
- Yeah.

00:39:45.356 --> 00:39:46.189
- All right.

00:39:46.189 --> 00:39:47.022
- Charles Murray.

00:39:47.022 --> 00:39:48.780
You used to write a column every so often

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.220
called Random Thoughts
on the Passing Scene.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:54.360
So I'm giving you little snippets
here of the Passing Scene

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.760
in our final questions.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:58.720
Charles Murray in his
1984 book Losing Ground,

00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:02.690
and Charles Murray writes
about discussions and academia

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:05.610
and government about the
effort to close the gap again

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:07.170
between African-Americans and whites.

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:08.003
Quote.

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:12.487
1984, quote, "White's
had created the problem,

00:40:12.487 --> 00:40:14.497
"it was up to White's to fix it,

00:40:14.497 --> 00:40:17.327
"and there was very little in the dialogue

00:40:17.327 --> 00:40:18.980
"that treated blacks
as responsible actors."

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.190
Close quote.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:21.410
Has that changed?

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:22.600
- No, it has not.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.433
- All right.

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:27.156
On we go.

00:40:27.156 --> 00:40:28.390
(laughing)

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:31.940
Your friend, your longtime
friend Walter Williams,

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:33.197
now we come to current politics.

00:40:33.197 --> 00:40:36.257
"The bottom line is that
president Donald Trump

00:40:36.257 --> 00:40:38.337
"does not have the personal character

00:40:38.337 --> 00:40:41.259
"that we would want our
children to imitate,

00:40:41.259 --> 00:40:43.977
"but save his misguided
international trade policies

00:40:43.977 --> 00:40:47.520
"has turned out to be a good president."

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.353
Tom?

00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.690
- I think his policies have by
and large have been policies

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:54.440
that were far better than that

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.533
of previous Democratic or
Republican administrations.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:00.230
I go by the consequences.

00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:01.697
- Okay.

00:41:01.697 --> 00:41:04.000
- I mean he hasn't produced
the right rhetoric,

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:08.050
but the fact is that unemployment
among low-income people,

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:12.540
black, Hispanic included, is at a level

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:15.553
that is far lower than
it's been in decades.

00:41:19.502 --> 00:41:23.891
The economy is booming in a
way that no one had predicted.

00:41:23.891 --> 00:41:28.600
People like Paul Krugman was
saying that when Trump gets in

00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:29.980
the economy is gonna tank.

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.556
No, the economy to hit new highs.

00:41:33.556 --> 00:41:36.270
But there there are so many people

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:38.640
among the intelligentsia especially

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.046
who are absolutely immune to facts.

00:41:41.046 --> 00:41:44.375
It's as if they took their
anti fact shots every year

00:41:44.375 --> 00:41:48.370
and the facts will just not affect them.

00:41:48.370 --> 00:41:50.041
- So this brings us back.

00:41:50.041 --> 00:41:52.630
I can understand, I mean I really can,

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:54.160
my understanding is limited which is why

00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.550
I'm going to put this in
the form of a question.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:58.560
I can understand the never Trumpers

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.420
who don't bother me with economic boom

00:42:01.420 --> 00:42:03.500
because this man is on
my television screen

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.650
every single night and I can't stand him.

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:07.390
I can understand, I can see that impulse.

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.697
I can understand what they feel.

00:42:09.697 --> 00:42:10.940
- This second consecutive
president United States

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:14.330
that I automatically turn off
when I'm watching television.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:15.163
- All right.

00:42:15.163 --> 00:42:16.300
Keep the remote right to next you.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.133
- Oh yeah.

00:42:17.133 --> 00:42:18.640
- Okay, who was the first?

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.473
- Obama.

00:42:19.473 --> 00:42:20.550
- Got it.

00:42:20.550 --> 00:42:22.470
You're totally bipartisan in that regard.

00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:23.910
- Oh, always.

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:24.853
No other way.

00:42:26.528 --> 00:42:27.361
But the great,

00:42:27.361 --> 00:42:29.190
the larger point that
you've been making here,

00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:32.090
the Great Society, the war on poverty,

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:36.544
this is now six decades of experience

00:42:36.544 --> 00:42:40.750
and we have, as you have
said, the gap hasn't closed,

00:42:40.750 --> 00:42:43.420
we've got dissolution
of the family structure,

00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:44.630
rising crime rates.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:46.470
That I don't understand.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:50.274
How can it be that the people...

00:42:50.274 --> 00:42:52.410
now I don't know how to remain bipartisan,

00:42:52.410 --> 00:42:55.255
but Democrats, liberals, the progressives,

00:42:55.255 --> 00:42:57.361
just are not...

00:42:57.361 --> 00:42:59.310
the evidence is in.

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:00.650
This has not worked.

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.430
Like after more than half a century

00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:05.936
there's still a refusal
to look at the evidence.

00:43:05.936 --> 00:43:10.250
- Yes and has even a tendency
to falsify the evidence.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.633
- And how come?

00:43:11.633 --> 00:43:16.185
- I think people become
attached to a vision

00:43:16.185 --> 00:43:20.140
and that really walks the way they see...

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:24.140
human beings have any enormous
capacity to rationalize.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:25.190
- All right.

00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:27.460
Again, notes on the Passing Scene.

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.110
An article from the New York Times

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:30.770
just a couple of days ago, quote,

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:33.146
now this is the longest quotation,

00:43:33.146 --> 00:43:34.570
but it's important to
lay out the facts here.

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:36.840
Over the last decade the
charter school movement

00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.040
gained significant foothold in New York,

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:40.830
the movement hoped to
set a national example.

00:43:40.830 --> 00:43:43.110
If charter schools could
make it in a deep blue state

00:43:43.110 --> 00:43:45.160
like New York that could make it anywhere.

00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:49.240
Over a 100,000 students in
the city's charter schools

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.150
are doing well on state tests

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.770
and tens of thousands are waiting lists.

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:57.230
But the election, the
election of this November,

00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:01.349
suggested that the golden era
of charter schools is over.

00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:03.100
The insurgent Democrats,

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:05.030
Democrats did well across New York

00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:06.820
but especially in the state Senate,

00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:10.500
have repeatedly expressed
hostility to the movement.

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.710
Close quote.

00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:14.513
And Thomas Sowell responds
to that set of facts how?

00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:19.720
- That really is one of the moral outrages

00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:24.170
that for many kids who were
cut from a very poor background

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:27.250
and who parents may not
have had much education,

00:44:27.250 --> 00:44:30.341
a decent education is the
one thing they have to have

00:44:30.341 --> 00:44:32.730
to have a better life.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:36.502
And these schools have been
absolutely spectacular.

00:44:36.502 --> 00:44:37.450
- The charter schools.

00:44:37.450 --> 00:44:38.720
- The charter schools.

00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:41.363
The successful ones, now
there are few that weren't.

00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:47.847
But for example a few
years ago on a statewide,

00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:50.598
New York statewide math test,

00:44:50.598 --> 00:44:55.320
there was an elementary
school grade four I believe

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.972
in Harlem whose students
passed those tests

00:44:58.972 --> 00:45:02.430
at a higher rate than
any fourth grade kids

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:04.779
anywhere in the state of New York.

00:45:04.779 --> 00:45:07.530
I mean we're talking
Scarsdale, Briarcliff,

00:45:07.530 --> 00:45:08.663
places like that.

00:45:09.963 --> 00:45:13.453
The Success Academy schools as a whole,

00:45:16.490 --> 00:45:19.570
their students pass both the math

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:21.780
and the English statewide tests

00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.400
at a higher rate than any school system,

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:29.197
School District in the
entire state of New York.

00:45:29.197 --> 00:45:34.156
The vast majority of the kids
in the Success Academy schools

00:45:34.156 --> 00:45:37.052
are either black or Hispanic.

00:45:37.052 --> 00:45:41.499
If you look at the five
highest-scoring district,

00:45:41.499 --> 00:45:44.492
school districts in the state in terms of

00:45:44.492 --> 00:45:47.310
the percentage of
students who pass the math

00:45:47.310 --> 00:45:52.310
or the English tests,
their average family income

00:45:53.131 --> 00:45:58.083
ranges from four times that of the kids

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.328
in the success Academy Schools

00:46:03.328 --> 00:46:08.328
to more than nine times the
family income of the kids

00:46:08.415 --> 00:46:11.340
in the Success Academy schools.

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:14.524
And yet the mayor of New
York is doing his darndest

00:46:14.524 --> 00:46:19.524
to put a stop to the expansion
of schools in general

00:46:19.930 --> 00:46:24.620
but his special ire is aimed
at the Success Academy schools.

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:26.130
And this is happening
all over the country.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.600
- Because they make the
teachers unions look bad

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.390
that run the public schools?

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:32.100
What's the political motivation?

00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:34.734
Why would Mayor De Blasio have it out

00:46:34.734 --> 00:46:36.450
for the charter schools
such a Success Academy?

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:38.750
- Well the teachers union
are the major reason

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:42.350
and we're talking about
the money they contribute,

00:46:42.350 --> 00:46:44.150
the number of votes they contribute,

00:46:45.008 --> 00:46:49.210
and the schools and
what's happening again,

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.660
not just in New York but
other parts of the country,

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.410
including California,

00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:56.946
is that they have all kind of chicanery

00:46:56.946 --> 00:46:59.400
to prevent this charter
schools from expanding.

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:02.070
That's why you have tens of
thousands on the waiting list.

00:47:02.070 --> 00:47:04.780
It's not that the charter
school is not willing to expand,

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:07.874
but every conceivable
obstacle is put in their way

00:47:07.874 --> 00:47:11.540
because if you let that
go at the natural pace,

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.801
it would be very hard for the
public schools to compete.

00:47:14.801 --> 00:47:17.530
And one of the things
they're doing is imposing

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:21.509
the same kinds of restrictions
on the on the charter schools

00:47:21.509 --> 00:47:24.270
that made this public school so bad.

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:26.800
For example of restrictions
on being able to get rid of

00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:29.024
kids who are running amok in this

00:47:29.024 --> 00:47:31.955
and ruining the education
of everybody else

00:47:31.955 --> 00:47:34.898
and the charter schools
don't tolerate that.

00:47:34.898 --> 00:47:36.900
The things that are tolerated

00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:39.313
in the public schools are unbelievable.

00:47:39.313 --> 00:47:41.950
- So when I asked you a moment ago

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:46.320
how do we bring back the
the standards of the Harlem

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.810
in which you grew up, the answer is

00:47:47.810 --> 00:47:50.610
that's a hard thing to do but we do know

00:47:50.610 --> 00:47:51.920
how to do one thing.

00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.460
We do know how to establish schools

00:47:55.460 --> 00:47:57.380
where the kids in present-day
Harlem have a shot,

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.660
have a chance of getting a good education.

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:01.960
- Yeah, you don't have
to bring back the past,

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:06.160
even if you could, because
we have it in the present.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:07.500
We have this happening.

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.650
- And so we know how to do that

00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:11.410
and the Democratic
establishment in New York

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:12.600
wants to shut it down.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.730
- Yes.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:16.910
- And the Republican
establishment stands mute.

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:17.743
- Stands mute.

00:48:20.017 --> 00:48:23.213
You know I love talking to you
but I really don't know why.

00:48:23.213 --> 00:48:24.454
(laughing)

00:48:24.454 --> 00:48:25.287
It's all discouraging.

00:48:25.287 --> 00:48:29.660
Tom you mentioned a moment
ago the way young Americans

00:48:31.388 --> 00:48:34.730
flocked to Bernie Sanders,
Gallup poll this summer.

00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:37.460
The proportion of Americans aged 18 to 29

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.060
that holds a favorable
view of capitalism 45%.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:45.740
The proportion that holds a
favorable view of socialism 51%.

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.960
Now I would like you to
take a look at a brief video

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:53.268
of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez
who at the age of 29,

00:48:53.268 --> 00:48:56.490
calling herself a Democratic Socialist,

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:59.550
has just been elected to
the House of Representatives

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:02.490
from New York and although
she's not seated yet

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:05.350
in the new Congress,
she went to Washington

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:08.752
and one of her first acts was
to participate in a sit-in

00:49:08.752 --> 00:49:13.752
in the offices of House
Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi.

00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.270
That is to say the
leader of her own party.

00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:18.773
So here's a brief video.

00:49:19.667 --> 00:49:22.247
- I just want to let you
all know how proud I am

00:49:22.247 --> 00:49:25.976
of each and every single one of you

00:49:25.976 --> 00:49:28.556
for putting yourselves and your bodies

00:49:28.556 --> 00:49:31.550
and everything on the line

00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:34.270
to make sure that you save our planet,

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:36.505
our generation, and our future.

00:49:36.505 --> 00:49:39.003
It's so incredibly important.

00:49:39.003 --> 00:49:44.003
We have to get to 100% renewable energy.

00:49:44.065 --> 00:49:46.842
There is no other option.

00:49:46.842 --> 00:49:48.407
- Tom?

00:49:48.407 --> 00:49:49.240
(laughing)

00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:51.680
To her supporters, to us
supporters of Bernie Sanders,

00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:54.149
to young Americans, what would you say?

00:49:54.149 --> 00:49:57.000
- I would say get some facts first,

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.160
know what you're talking about

00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.610
before you start spouting
out this kind of stuff.

00:50:01.530 --> 00:50:04.422
One of the things I do in a
new new book is I suggest that

00:50:04.422 --> 00:50:09.130
there's a certain opinion about
what happened in the 1920s

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:11.351
where the taxes were cut,

00:50:11.351 --> 00:50:15.400
the highest tax rate was
cut down from 73% to 24%

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:18.280
and the argument was oh,
this is tax cuts for the rich

00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.310
and I have suggested that students

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:24.000
and that the secretary
of the Treasury did this

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.677
in support of us trickle-down
theory and so forth.

00:50:26.677 --> 00:50:28.403
And I suggested to the students,

00:50:29.333 --> 00:50:30.870
would be a wonderful project to go read

00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:33.330
what the secretary of the
Treasury actually said.

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:36.230
- Andrew Mellon in the
1920s about these tax cuts.

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.500
- And then go on the Internet

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:42.790
and get the Internal Revenue official data

00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:45.562
on who paid how much taxes in the 1920s

00:50:45.562 --> 00:50:47.767
and it turns out if you
do that you find that

00:50:47.767 --> 00:50:50.230
Andrew Mellon said the exact opposite

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:54.310
of what is attributed to him in textbooks

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:58.780
that have been sold
widely for decades on end

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:02.456
through successive editions.

00:51:02.456 --> 00:51:05.095
And what you'll find is that

00:51:05.095 --> 00:51:10.095
when the tax rate was a 73%,
the people who are making

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.470
over a hundred thousand dollars a year,

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:16.875
and that's maybe a couple
of million in today's money,

00:51:16.875 --> 00:51:19.690
paid 30% of the taxes

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:22.270
and after the so-called
tax cuts for the rich

00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:25.391
they pay 65% of all the taxes.

00:51:25.391 --> 00:51:28.700
And the people with incomes under $5,000,

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:31.579
which is also was a nice
income in those days,

00:51:31.579 --> 00:51:36.579
we're paying 15% when
the tax rate was was cut

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:41.216
but before the tax cut
and after it was cut,

00:51:41.216 --> 00:51:45.608
they paid just under a
quarter of 1% of all the taxes

00:51:45.608 --> 00:51:49.200
and so there's all kinds of indignation

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.830
in these scholarly books,

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:53.978
we're not talking about
just political propaganda.

00:51:53.978 --> 00:51:57.018
How this is a bonanza
for the rich and so on

00:51:57.018 --> 00:51:59.810
and people would ordinary income

00:51:59.810 --> 00:52:02.163
paid practically nothing in
income tax after the tax cuts

00:52:02.163 --> 00:52:07.163
and the share of millionaires
was I think 4% before that

00:52:08.839 --> 00:52:12.740
and and it was 19% afterwards.

00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.818
But the facts simply do not matter.

00:52:15.818 --> 00:52:18.910
They say these words,
they say trickle down,

00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:21.209
and it's like saying abracadabra

00:52:21.209 --> 00:52:24.360
and all the miraculous
things follow from that.

00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:26.900
- Tom Sowell author of
a forthcoming edition

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.530
of Discrimination and Disparities.

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:31.920
Would you close by
reading a brief quotation

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.520
from your 1987 book, one of my favorites,

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.810
A Conflict of Visions.

00:52:36.810 --> 00:52:41.241
- Logic of course is not
the only test of a theory.

00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:43.818
Empirical evidence is crucial

00:52:43.818 --> 00:52:47.963
and yet social visions have
shown a remarkable ability

00:52:47.963 --> 00:52:52.761
to evade, suppress, or explain
away discordant evidence.

00:52:52.761 --> 00:52:57.144
Historic invasions of evidence
are a warning, not a model.

00:52:57.144 --> 00:53:00.600
Dedication to a cause
may legitimately entail

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.280
sacrifices of personal interests

00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:06.793
but not sacrifices of mind or conscience.

00:53:06.793 --> 00:53:09.650
- Dr. Thomas Sowell thank you.

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:10.910
- Thank you.

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:13.730
- For Uncommon Knowledge
