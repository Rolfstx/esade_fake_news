Chris Hedges: But all of the attendant problems
that come with societal decay, the opioid

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.660
crisis is rampant.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.530
Hate groups, I spend hate groups are a product
of a decayed society, and I spend time with

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.700
these groups.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:27.380
The Proud Boys, Knights of the Alt-Right,
The 3 Percenters as well as the Antifa and

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.650
the Black Bloc which I have been very critical
of.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:39.829
And I think that kind of pornography of violence,
that kind of violence as a form of catharsis

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.940
is common to both the left and the right.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.600
The radical left I'd say.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:01:05.600
[music]

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.510
Habiba Nosheen: I was saying to the organizers
there is really no way I could have declined

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.000
this request to be here because my very first
job when I was 14, was working for the Toronto

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.750
Public Library for $6.85 an hour.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.160
So we're very honoured to have Chris Hedges
here I don't think he needs an introduction

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.960
because I'm also told by the organizer that
this when the tickets went up for 500 people,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.470
it sold out within four hours.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.800
So you probably know, who he is but in case
you don't he's a Pulitzer prize winning journalist

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.090
who was a foreign correspondent for fifteen
years for the New York Times where he also

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.740
served as the Middle East bureau chief for
the paper.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.700
He previously worked overseas for the Dallas
Morning News, the Christian Science Monitor

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.430
and NPR, he writes a weekly column for the
online magazine, Truthdig and is the host

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.590
of the Emmy award winning RT America show
on contact.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.100
HN: Hedges holds a Master of Divinity from
Harvard University, he has taught at University,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.450
Princeton University, Columbia University,
NYU and the University of "Toronto He currently

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.360
teaches courses in the New Jersey prison system.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:25.840
He's the author of a number of best selling
books, including his latest book which is

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.410
America: The Farewell Tour.

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.420
Please welcome Chris.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.690
[applause]

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.640
HN: So Chris to many the United States is
a global power with a firm hold on the world.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.310
But in the book you say short of a sudden
and widespread popular revolt, the death spiral

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.350
appears unstoppable meaning the United States
as we know it will no longer exist within

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.590
a decade or at most two.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.350
That's quite a statement.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.600
What makes you say that?

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:06.560
CH: Because it's pegged to the end of the
dollar as the world's reserve currency.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.730
That at that point the Empire becomes unsustainable.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.720
And the economy goes into free fall.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.599
And we can see what happened in the 1950s
when the pound sterling after the debacle

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.410
of the Suez crisis was dropped as the world's
currency.

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.459
We are following all the familiar trajectories
of dying empires.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.599
We're just ticking everything off the list
including that final, what historians called

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:45.011
micro-militarism when you carry out in this
case, the 17 years of warfare in the Middle

00:03:45.011 --> 00:03:55.489
East, these feudal self destructive conflicts,
which is very difficult to extract yourself

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:56.730
from.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:06.200
So, yeah, on all levels, the America, as we
know it is terminal when all of this will

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.300
happen I mean of course we're barrelling towards
another financial crisis which even establishment

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.590
organs like the New York Times, which had
an editorial the other day on the removal

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.880
of the Trump administration of the very tepid
regulations imposed by Dodd-Frank.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.800
Even that we read Paul Krugman and I read
Paul Krugman, I read the story of The Times

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.000
every day and there are columns that he sounds
like me, I mean, it's people are very worried

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.970
and then we haven't even dealt with the issue
of climate change.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:45.620
HN: The Dodd-Frank regulations that went into
place post the financial crisis, the implementation

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:52.590
of that has been slow to say the least, how
does that factor into your prediction that...

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:57.960
CH: Well, we the mishandled the 2008 global
financial collapse.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.190
HN: How so?

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:06.810
CH: We bailed out the banks, to anywhere between
four to seven trillion dollars we manufactured

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.220
money what Marx calls "fictitious capital".

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.750
We not only lend that money at virtually zero
percent interest, and there were several banks

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.650
in Europe that it was actually negative.

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:24.770
They would pay you to take money, and...

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.970
We re-inflated the speculative economy.

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.380
None of this money went towards infrastructure.

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.030
I mean China's reaction after 2008 was the
opposite, none of it went to infrastructure

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.870
projects, none of it bailed out the pension
funds, the municipal funds, all of which drops

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.300
sometimes by 40%, not to mention all those
people at IRAs.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.380
So the victims were left with nothing, the
victimizers were bailed out.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:03.680
And that mechanism of re-inflating the market
through 0% interest means that there's no

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.590
plan B. That the next time around, they don't
know what they're gonna do.

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.880
And then we have watched this massive tax
cut, which over the next 10 years will bleed

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:21.150
an estimated $1.5 trillion out of revenue
from the US budget.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.000
CH: And what have they done with the money?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.650
They bought back their own stock to inflate
the value of the stock, which is why you have

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.050
an overheated stock market, because that feeds
the compensation.

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:39.570
The compensation packages of CEOs and senior
management is tied to the value of the stock.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:47.729
So, it all looks pretty grim, financially,
and Dodd-Frank, we just saw the other day

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:54.729
that they essentially removed controls for
most banks.

00:06:54.729 --> 00:07:00.479
This was a very recent development, which
has left most of the financial market now

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:01.680
completely unregulated.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:11.490
So it's extremely dangerous and when we get
hit this time, I don't know how they're gonna

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:14.800
be able to respond in a kind of...

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.440
I don't know how they're gonna be able to
re-inflate the market.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:27.540
They can try and turn around, and manufacture
money again, but then you're flirting with

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.540
hyperinflation.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.850
HN: So in your estimation, what would a world
post United States as a super power look like

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:34.850
then?

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:37.259
CH: Probably a multi-polar world.

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:38.289
HN: Explain.

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:46.930
CH: So you have certain spheres of influence,
China for instance.

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.980
Maybe in the Middle East, Turkey would like
to play that role.

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:54.229
That's why they're messing around in Syria.

00:07:54.229 --> 00:07:56.360
HN: I'm surprised to hear you say Turkey.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:57.990
CH: Well, in the Middle East.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:04.819
I mean ErdoÄŸan clearly has visions of recreating
the Ottoman reach, whether he can or not,

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:05.819
I don't know.

00:08:05.819 --> 00:08:11.419
And if Turkey, of course, has got its own
financial crisis at the moment.

00:08:11.419 --> 00:08:14.410
But, yeah, I suspect a multi-polar world.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:20.780
There are some questions and that is what
will be the power of international finance?

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:27.120
Which has been able to essentially seize control
of economies quite effectively.

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:33.060
You see it in India, for instance, countries
like India, Pakistan, where people don't have

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:38.310
control because of the IMF and the World Bank,
and Goldman Sachs.

00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:41.900
Greece is the most egregious example of this.

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:50.760
These states can't control their own economies
and so they revert to these politics of national

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.100
identity.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:59.660
That economic decline is interpreted, Reagan
and Thatcher started this, is an assault against

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:04.790
our national identity, against our values
and that's where you get the Islamophobia,

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:10.800
the anti-immigrant stance, the rise of these
right-wing proto-fascist, and countries like

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.240
Hungary or the United States.

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:22.610
CH: It's built out of that economic paralysis
and political paralysis, because any time

00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:30.250
a cabal seizes power, whether it's monarchical
communist fascist or in our case, corporate.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.790
The system seizes up.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:37.300
It no longer is able to implement what is
fundamental to a democracy, as Karl Popper

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:38.350
points out.

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.740
And that's incremental or piecemeal reform.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:49.370
You can't staunch the assault whether it's
through austerity, stagnant wages, or in essence,

00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:50.930
declining wages.

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:56.870
And we go back to that, the borrowing at 0%
interest.

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:58.960
The money has to be repaid.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:07.230
And so the international financiers imposed
punishing forms of debt peonage on the population,

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:09.970
in order to pay back the money.

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:21.160
And so that's where you get in the United
States, this student loan crisis at $1.4 trillion.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:25.290
And even if you declare bankruptcy, you're
still responsible for...

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.800
I mean It's a really pernicious system.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:30.450
HN: Because you can't actually, even personal
bankruptcy...

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:31.450
You might still...

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.140
It might be the same in Canada, actually,
where student loans don't count, again, to

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:36.140
bankruptcy.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:39.860
CH: Right we do everything you shouldn't do
and then 10 years later you copy us.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.440
I have never figured that out.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.850
Our healthcare system, so cost...

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.540
We have the most expensive healthcare system
and the least efficient in the industrialized

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.410
world, but we're spending, I think, 18% of
GDP...

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.980
It's staggering the amount of money.

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.430
So even if you have insurance.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.779
A million people a year in the United States
go bankrupt because they can't pay health

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:09.700
insurance, pay health costs, and they have
insurance.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.070
CH: Credit cards are another one.

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:15.500
So, as soon as you're late on your credit
card, you're suddenly paying 28% interest.

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:22.360
So there's all these mechanisms by which they
gouge the citizenry.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.899
All these hidden costs.

00:11:24.899 --> 00:11:25.899
All the private...

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:30.370
I opened the book in Scranton, as you know,
where the city is just selling off municipal

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.370
assets.

00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:40.180
The sewer system, the utilities, to get money
because they're trying to stave off insolvency

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:42.860
or bankruptcy, and that's a short-term.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.560
What happens when they don't have any assets
to sell?

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:53.610
And then, once they've sold the assets, rates
including the parking authority, double, triple.

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:58.620
And I think the per capita income in Scranton
is $45,000 a year or something, so...

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.240
And there are no mechanisms left.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:06.170
There are no impediments either internal or
external to halt this pillage.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:15.950
So we're headed for a crisis: Political, economic
crisis of immense magnitude of which Trump

00:12:15.950 --> 00:12:18.970
is the symptom of the decayed system.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:20.930
He is not the disease.

00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:27.170
HN: I take it from parts of the book where
you mention some dates that this book began

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.620
before the election.

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.550
CH: It did, it began on ice...

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:33.720
It took the end 2 years ago and I submitted...

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.160
I actually have the title, America: The Farewell
Tour, and all of the editors at Simon &amp; Schuster

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:48.140
thought I was, once again, being very hyperbolic
and then Trump got elected, so I wrote my

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.940
chapter, as you know, on the Gambling 'cause
I write about...

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:57.430
HN: So did the election change at all what
was ultimately in the book or what...

00:12:57.430 --> 00:13:02.480
CH: No, no because the election confirmed
everything that was in the book.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.500
Because the book was about the pathologies
of a diseased culture and how in a decayed

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:16.290
or a diseased culture, these perverted forms
of behavior express themselves, which are

00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:17.850
hardly unique to the United States.

00:13:17.850 --> 00:13:19.519
And I studied classics.

00:13:19.519 --> 00:13:31.090
I know what the late Roman Empire looked like,
which is a lot like the United States.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:32.090
And Trump...

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.090
When I wrote my chapter on Gambling...

00:13:33.090 --> 00:13:37.370
So I write about what sociologists called,
Diseases of Despair.

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:45.870
So that's heroin, drug addiction, gambling,
suicide, sexual sadism.

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:51.660
HN: But didn't those things always exist in
the States?

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:55.760
CH: Yes, but I think most people have no idea
how pervasive.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.240
I mean, just the opioid crisis alone is gambling.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.330
The figures are in the book but it's kind
of staggering.

00:14:02.330 --> 00:14:06.440
Which by the way, gamblers have the highest
rate of suicide of any addict.

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:13.230
And the way the gambling industry has proliferated
because with the fall of revenue for states,

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.310
because of a decline in taxation, everybody's
building casinos right and left as a form

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:20.010
of economic development.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.899
And I covered the war in the former Yugoslavia,
and I'd watch the Yugoslavs try that and it

00:14:23.899 --> 00:14:28.329
didn't work out real well.

00:14:28.329 --> 00:14:31.050
So, Trump...

00:14:31.050 --> 00:14:34.950
When I write the Gambling chapter, I wrote
it out of the Trump Taj Mahal before he even

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:35.950
announced.

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:36.950
I didn't...

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:42.430
I just thought he was this bizarre, corrupt
con artist, who kind of would be good for

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:47.420
the book and by the time I finished, he was
president.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:53.410
HN: You also write that under every measurement
from the financial growth and infrastructure

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:59.550
investment to advanced technology, including
supercomputers, space weaponry and cyber warfare,

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:03.320
we are being rapidly overtaken by the Chinese.

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:08.440
Is there anything you think that's unique
to America, that America does it well, the

00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.880
Chinese would not be able to overtake America
in?

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.350
CH: Yeah, weapons.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:18.630
We make the best weapons in the world and
we are the largest arms exporter in the world.

00:15:18.630 --> 00:15:26.340
And we are hauling ourselves out from the
inside by funding this unaudited, uncontrollable,

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:33.300
phenomenally bloated Military budget, just
like the late Roman Empire, which had a million

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:39.860
members of the Roman legion which was trying
to sustain.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:46.930
So we're rapidly kind of becoming like a third
world country with nukes.

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:47.950
[laughter]

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:50.800
CH: Because the disparity.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.140
I mean, you know it from having been in Pakistan,
but you see it in a developing world, and

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.440
I certainly saw it when I lived in Latin America,
for example.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:04.600
Where when I lived in Lima, I lived in a section
of of Lima called Miraflores that looked like

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.110
Miami except for the walls were a little higher
and they had concertina wire on them.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:12.930
But you could walk 10 blocks and go to the
Pueblos jÃ³venes, where people were living

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:16.820
in open sewers without electricity or running...

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.350
And that's what America is becoming.

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:23.550
These pockets of immense wealth, concentrated
wealth.

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.560
Because I traveled all over the country for
this book, I saw it.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:31.649
I mean, the whole city is just wrecked, decayed
wastelands.

00:16:31.649 --> 00:16:33.170
Cleveland, Detroit.

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:38.580
I was in Anderson where GM used to have plants
then Clinton passes NAFTA.

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:45.450
By 2006, all those plants have literally been
bulldozed to just big, gigantic, open weed

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:47.220
filled lots.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.889
They've moved to Monterrey, Mexico.

00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:54.290
They're paying Mexican workers $3 an hour
with no benefits, no job security, no pensions,

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.290
nothing.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:59.510
CH: All of these union UAW jobs, all these
UAW jobs are gone.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:05.439
People who have made $25-$30 an hour, could
sustain a family on a single income.

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:11.019
Own their own house, had a pension, had medical
benefits, sent their kids [17:10] ____ across

00:17:11.019 --> 00:17:12.019
America.

00:17:12.019 --> 00:17:17.220
And Anderson looks like every other de-industrialized
pocket of the United States.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:23.139
Not only with everything shutting down, on
churches for sale, all that kind of stuff.

00:17:23.139 --> 00:17:30.029
But all of the attendant problems that come
with societal decay, the opioid crisis is

00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:31.700
rampant.

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:32.700
Hate groups.

00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:37.720
I spent hate groups are a product of a decayed
society.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.740
And I spent time with these groups.

00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:48.870
The Proud Boys, Knights of the Alt-Right,
The 3 Percenters, as well as Antifa and the

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.690
Black bloc, which I have been very critical
of.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:18:00.859
And I think that kind of pornography of violence,
that kind of violence as a form of catharsis

00:18:00.859 --> 00:18:05.559
is common to both the left and the right,
the radical left, I'd say.

00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:06.909
HN: And you don't...

00:18:06.909 --> 00:18:12.350
As you said, you've been critical of Antifa
which is a left wing extremist movement that

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:17.480
violently opposes groups that are considered
as fascists including democratic and centre

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.480
right.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.289
And you don't think that movement can lead
to real change.

00:18:22.289 --> 00:18:25.129
CH: No, I think it's a gift to the security
in Serbia.

00:18:25.129 --> 00:18:27.440
First of all, I think half of them are cops.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.440
But...

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.179
HN: You think what?

00:18:30.179 --> 00:18:33.019
CH: Half of them are cops.

00:18:33.019 --> 00:18:34.019
[applause]

00:18:34.019 --> 00:18:37.529
CH: You read any counterinsurgency, I mean
read Lenin.

00:18:37.529 --> 00:18:46.899
Even though his own brother, was involved
in the assassination of Alexander II and hanged,

00:18:46.899 --> 00:18:54.419
Lenin recognized that that anarchist violence
was very detrimental to the revolution.

00:18:54.419 --> 00:18:55.679
Why?

00:18:55.679 --> 00:19:02.869
Because any revolution, and that's really
what I'm calling for, I'm calling for the

00:19:02.869 --> 00:19:10.200
overthrow of corporate power and I don't believe
that that's going to come through the calcified

00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:17.989
mechanisms and institutions that once made
reform and democracy possible, including of

00:19:17.989 --> 00:19:26.100
course the Congress and the courts which have
stripped us of our constitutional rights by

00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:29.789
judicial fiat, in essence.

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:36.639
CH: It needs broad-based popular support and
the theorists of revolution, Crane Brinton,

00:19:36.639 --> 00:19:43.929
Jeffrey Davies and others have all argued,
I think correctly, that no revolution succeeds

00:19:43.929 --> 00:19:50.720
unless a significant percentage of the internal
mechanism of control defects.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.850
So for instance, in the Russian Revolution,
the pivotal point was when there were bread

00:19:54.850 --> 00:20:00.419
riots in Petrograd, they sent in the Cossacks
and they wouldn't crush the rioters.

00:20:00.419 --> 00:20:01.529
In fact, they joined them.

00:20:01.529 --> 00:20:10.721
The Tzars are directing the troops, they rush
them back and he has to abdicate before he

00:20:10.721 --> 00:20:14.710
even gets back to the city in a railway carriage.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:19.220
CH: You saw the same in...

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:21.539
I covered the revolutions in Eastern Europe.

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:26.669
So you saw the same thing in East Germany,
where Erich Honecker who had been the communist

00:20:26.669 --> 00:20:33.190
dictator for 19 years, sends in elite paratroop
vision to Leipzig where these protests, the

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:40.559
epicentre of these protests and when the paratroopers
get there, the local communist party officials

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:43.700
refused to deploy them in the streets.

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.070
Honecker's out within a week.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:52.499
CH: As soon as the Shah flees and the head
of the Armed Forces in Iran announces that

00:20:52.499 --> 00:20:54.580
the military will no longer...

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:59.860
The Iranian military, which I think, was the
fourth largest in the world, the Shah wasted

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.960
a lot of money on American weaponry.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:07.419
And they said, when they would no longer defend
the regime, they would not defend the regime,

00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:08.710
it was finished.

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:16.429
So what the counterrevolutionary forces seek
to do is demonized the movement and make people

00:21:16.429 --> 00:21:19.100
fearful of it.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:24.570
And the Black Bloc and Antifa provide that
to them.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:29.059
I've dealt with them, I dealt with them a
lot in Occupy.

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:32.710
And they protested me, especially on the West
Coast, where I'm about to go.

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.080
So, to the point where they will call in threats.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:42.200
I spoke in LA and I arrived and they'd hired
these three bodyguards because of it.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.970
But outside the hall, they'll walk up and
down dressed in black, with their face with

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:50.259
signs that say, "FU Chris Hedges", every sign
saying the same thing.

00:21:50.259 --> 00:21:52.710
HN: They did speak to you for your book though.

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:53.710
CH: Hmm?

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:55.229
HN: Members did speak to you, for your book.

00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:56.229
CH: Yeah.

00:21:56.229 --> 00:21:57.229
Not much.

00:21:57.229 --> 00:21:58.229
HN: Okay.

00:21:58.229 --> 00:22:01.380
CH: And a lot of those interviews were done
by my research assistant.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.380
CH: Ah.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.380
Okay.

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.620
HN: Yeah, they don't like me, they don't like
me too much.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:18.129
But I think they're immature, I think they're
juvenile, I think that it is about them being

00:22:18.129 --> 00:22:26.380
able to carry out property destruction, primarily,
it's property destruction.

00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:34.570
But we're never gonna confront this system
of corporate totalitarianism through property

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:35.809
destruction or violence.

00:22:35.809 --> 00:22:37.549
And I was overseas.

00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:43.619
I've seen the US military at work, including...

00:22:43.619 --> 00:22:50.419
We have 60,000 members of the special forces
alone, which are called "Death Squads".

00:22:50.419 --> 00:22:52.710
We just can't match them, at that we...

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:53.960
I'm not a pacifist.

00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:56.109
I was in Sarajevo during the war.

00:22:56.109 --> 00:23:00.849
We were surrounded by the Serbs, literally,
with a kind of trench system for three and

00:23:00.849 --> 00:23:04.470
a half years, it was like World War I, the
zone.

00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:08.450
Every once in a while some Muslim commander
would get this bright idea, that they were

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:13.210
gonna retake a few hundred yards of land and
there'd be start burst up in the middle of

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:14.210
the night.

00:23:14.210 --> 00:23:20.549
CH: You'd the rattle of machine guns and the
next day, 200 Muslim kids were dead, left

00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:26.669
scrambling through a blasted section of ground
that was meaningless.

00:23:26.669 --> 00:23:32.369
We knew that if the Serbs broke through those
trenches, a third of the city would be slaughtered

00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:37.129
and the rest would be driven into refugee
and displacement camps.

00:23:37.129 --> 00:23:44.250
Not to mention the torture, rape, which was
endemic by the Serbs.

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:49.399
So nobody sat around, we were being hit with
2,000 shells a day.

00:23:49.399 --> 00:23:54.389
Nobody sat around in those basements arguing
about pacifism, but it didn't save them from

00:23:54.389 --> 00:23:55.799
the poison of violence.

00:23:55.799 --> 00:24:00.279
CH: So there are moments when people seek
your annihilation.

00:24:00.279 --> 00:24:09.570
Actively as was the case in Sarajevo or in
the case of Iraq or Afghanistan, or Gaza where

00:24:09.570 --> 00:24:15.779
you have a foreign occupation, where that
foreign occupier speaks exclusively in a language

00:24:15.779 --> 00:24:17.510
of force.

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:23.379
So I used to work in Algeria, and when I would
get to the airport, I would say "Welcome to

00:24:23.379 --> 00:24:24.379
Algeria.

00:24:24.379 --> 00:24:26.179
Land of a million martyrs.

00:24:26.179 --> 00:24:32.440
They were able to bleed like the Northern
Amazonian way that the French were not.

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:37.469
But that's not the situation we're in revolutions
are different entities, and that's what we're

00:24:37.469 --> 00:24:49.180
trying to pull off and so it means that we
have to be strategic and disciplined, we have

00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:55.570
to speak with the moral force that this corrupt
system can no longer employ.

00:24:55.570 --> 00:25:04.109
One of the reasons that you have seen the
further isolation of critics of imperialism

00:25:04.109 --> 00:25:09.549
and in particular the ideology of neo-liberalism
and David Harvey, if anybody really wants

00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:12.379
to read a good book on neo-liberalism get
David Harvey's book.

00:25:12.379 --> 00:25:14.019
It kinda lays it out.

00:25:14.019 --> 00:25:15.489
I mean, like Marx, he understood it.

00:25:15.489 --> 00:25:17.229
Was I just utterly utopian.

00:25:17.229 --> 00:25:26.090
CH: John Ralston Saul, Voltaire's "Bastards" also or he
wrote a book later, "The Collapse of Globalism"

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:33.049
but it was just an ideology to
justify greed, it was utterly utopian it never

00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:34.559
made sense.

00:25:34.559 --> 00:25:40.369
And so we now have a situation certainly within
the United States, and I would argue, probably

00:25:40.369 --> 00:25:44.010
most of Europe where people aren't buying
that ideology anymore, well it doesn't matter

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:48.619
where they come from, in the political spectrum,
this is what saw the insurgency of Sanders

00:25:48.619 --> 00:25:51.580
and the insurgency of Trump.

00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:58.139
And so what you've seen is critics of capitalism,
and imperialism, such as myself, have already

00:25:58.139 --> 00:26:04.099
been pushed to the margins of the internet
locked out of public broadcasting even Chomsky,

00:26:04.099 --> 00:26:13.840
[26:05] ____ but what they're doing now is
using Google algorithms to further cut us

00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:15.049
off from the public.

00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:18.340
So for instance, I write for Robert Sheers
great website Truthdig.

00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:23.710
CH: But if you know Bob Sheer that former
writer at rampages he's one, the great icons

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:29.019
of American journalism and Google and Facebook
and Twitter...

00:26:29.019 --> 00:26:30.080
In the name of fake news.

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:36.389
Of course, and we had this shadowy group called
Prop or not propaganda or not enlisting all

00:26:36.389 --> 00:26:44.029
the major left-wing sites: CounterPunch, antiwar.com,
alternet, world socialist website, eyesight,

00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:51.869
Truthdig as being purveyors of fake news and
for and part of the Kremlin and a Washington

00:26:51.869 --> 00:26:53.609
Post played it up.

00:26:53.609 --> 00:26:59.230
And so anyway, that gave the excuse for these
algorithms, and what they do is they have

00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:03.990
something called impressions where if you
went into Google and typed imperialism and

00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.999
I had written before the impressions were
cut an article on Imperialism it would come

00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:09.830
up with other articles.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:12.880
Now, those algorithms locked me out.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:19.510
CH: So we've seen a graph in the last 12 months,
in Truthdig with over 700,000 referrals from

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:25.820
impressions dropping to over 200,000, all
of the left wing sites have been decimated,

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:32.349
Alternet's lost 63%, CounterPunch, Black Agenda
Report, and that coupled with the abolition

00:27:32.349 --> 00:27:35.159
of net neutrality, or an effective weapon.

00:27:35.159 --> 00:27:43.279
And I think that's because the ideology has
lost credibility and is bankrupt, these marginalized

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:47.809
predicts suddenly become much more dangerous.

00:27:47.809 --> 00:27:55.690
And again, you go back to all of the indicators
of a system that is in the death throes and

00:27:55.690 --> 00:28:03.370
that loss of credibility, is key and so coupled
with it has seen, certainly within the United

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:10.590
States, horrific forms of state violence,
state intrusion militarized police 3.3 Americans,

00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:17.440
almost all unarmed, are shot and killed every
day in the streets of American cities.

00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:18.869
Mass incarceration.

00:28:18.869 --> 00:28:28.739
We have created in marginal communities, as
you know I would call them militarized zones

00:28:28.739 --> 00:28:31.279
of terror.

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:36.529
That's not too strong a word, I mean if you're
a mother with a young African-American son

00:28:36.529 --> 00:28:41.190
and it's dark, you don't know if they're ever
coming home and it's 'cause of the cops.

00:28:41.190 --> 00:28:49.519
HN: But aren't the grievances that the groups
like Antifa, have aren't they valid?

00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:58.590
CH: Well, I share some of them on the left
of course, but this could be a whole evening

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:03.029
on anarchism, I mean the anarchist support
pornography, which I don't.

00:29:03.029 --> 00:29:06.370
They support prostitution, which I don't,
they believe.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:10.480
And I think this particularly affects the
vulnerable and in particularly protect women

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.480
that...

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:19.399
For instance, if you're raped, you shouldn't
go to the police, because you're a snitch

00:29:19.399 --> 00:29:27.190
and I'm not opposed to policing when it's
carried out for public safety, I am opposed

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:34.009
to policing when it's carried out to shoot
people and oppress people of color.

00:29:34.009 --> 00:29:41.299
HN: So, what police force in the world would
you say is getting it right?

00:29:41.299 --> 00:29:46.369
CH: I would say police should not carry weapons.

00:29:46.369 --> 00:29:50.599
It's a better way to say it.

00:29:50.599 --> 00:29:54.409
HN: And there are police forces in the world
that don't...

00:29:54.409 --> 00:30:00.049
CH: Well I mean, the old Bobby didn't carry
a weapon.

00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:01.899
But I mean this gets into the whole...

00:30:01.899 --> 00:30:03.839
What was the British police force?

00:30:03.839 --> 00:30:11.940
Well, it was based on Peel's formation of
a home guard in Ireland to stop and then exported

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.089
to Britain to break and I mean policing...

00:30:15.089 --> 00:30:21.379
Police forces were created in the Peel model
to suppress radicals.

00:30:21.379 --> 00:30:26.789
That's what they did in Ireland and that's
what they did in Britain.

00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:32.909
But you create the veneer of creating a police
force around criminality, which it almost

00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:35.169
never is.

00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:44.450
And the United States followed that Peel model
because we had the bloodiest labor wars in

00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:46.559
the industrialized world.

00:30:46.559 --> 00:30:49.749
Hundreds of American workers were murdered
by gun thugs.

00:30:49.749 --> 00:30:57.850
Pinkerton's, Baldwin Felts' company goons
and local police forces, because they were

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:03.220
local identified with the workers, so they
had to create state police forces and private

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.220
militias.

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:11.090
CH: That's the Pennsylvania State Police,
which were brutal especially in the old coal

00:31:11.090 --> 00:31:15.549
fields, and tough in Pennsylvania.

00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:20.470
They used to call them the Pennsylvania Cossacks.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:24.019
So that gets into a whole other issue of why
do we have police?

00:31:24.019 --> 00:31:29.279
Well, it's not why we're told we have police.

00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:36.839
But nevertheless, having lived in a former
Yugoslavia, where all hierarchical systems

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:44.440
of authority had been destroyed or having
worked in places like the Congo where it was...

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:52.249
Whoever had the the biggest trunk load of
AK47s took over, I have a healthy respect

00:31:52.249 --> 00:31:55.279
for order.

00:31:55.279 --> 00:31:59.129
The problem is, who manages that order and
what is their intent?

00:31:59.129 --> 00:32:05.769
HN: So I wanna go back to corporate America,
which as we know, you're very critical of.

00:32:05.769 --> 00:32:10.729
But having lived in the US, one thing I would
say, and even here, one thing I'm struck by

00:32:10.729 --> 00:32:15.019
is the level of innovation that comes out
of America and you could say, and people do

00:32:15.019 --> 00:32:22.279
say that partly it's to do with the fact that
money is a huge motivator when there's the

00:32:22.279 --> 00:32:24.639
potential to make millions of dollars.

00:32:24.639 --> 00:32:30.349
People do invent things that do end up doing
good for society.

00:32:30.349 --> 00:32:36.659
One example I can think of is I am a mother
of a child with special needs.

00:32:36.659 --> 00:32:41.549
The machinery that helps her eat, that helps
her walk, all invented in the United States.

00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:49.899
So is there a concern that if we take money
as a motivator away from people that it affects

00:32:49.899 --> 00:32:53.580
innovation that ultimately helps people as
well?

00:32:53.580 --> 00:33:00.799
CH: No, I mean the problem is that those particularly
let's talk about Silicon Valley.

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:07.849
So those innovators themselves make a lot
of money, but what they do is they...

00:33:07.849 --> 00:33:16.359
Then all of that technology is built in sweatshops
in china or Bangladesh, where workers live

00:33:16.359 --> 00:33:23.330
under Dickensian conditions that replicate
the hell of industrial England in the late

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:25.779
19th century.

00:33:25.779 --> 00:33:32.409
And we know from China, you have whole cities
that are making Apple...

00:33:32.409 --> 00:33:39.480
Everybody is out there over 100,000 people,
but they're secret, the security apparatus

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.419
is such that you can't get in there, you can't
film it.

00:33:42.419 --> 00:33:46.250
They live in these horrific dormitories.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:52.009
There's constant wage theft, and so if they
don't meet their production quotas they're

00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:53.009
not paid.

00:33:53.009 --> 00:33:57.169
HN: All that, all that totally true I don't
think there's.

00:33:57.169 --> 00:34:05.549
CH: These people who are innovators should
not be given a free pass to be predators.

00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:06.549
That's the point.

00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:10.659
And that's the problem.

00:34:10.659 --> 00:34:12.419
[applause]

00:34:12.419 --> 00:34:18.849
HN: You also write it in your book, "When
a government watches you 24 hours a day, you

00:34:18.849 --> 00:34:21.069
cannot use the word 'liberty'.

00:34:21.069 --> 00:34:25.629
This is the relationship between a master
and a slave."

00:34:25.629 --> 00:34:31.659
In your view, are there any successful ways
that citizens can resist this constant surveillance?

00:34:31.659 --> 00:34:37.960
Because I know if you're worried about the
NSA listening to your call, you still have

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.869
to get through your day and make your calls.

00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:43.730
So the tendency is to say, "Okay, well, they're
watching me, anyways.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:44.859
There's nothing I can do."

00:34:44.859 --> 00:34:45.859
CH: It's worse than that.

00:34:45.859 --> 00:34:50.179
I mean Facebook, I don't know why anyone's
on Facebook, I'm not.

00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:55.192
I mean, we have handed all of our information...

00:34:55.192 --> 00:35:01.010
It's called the Black Box industry, it's now
a multi-billion dollar industry, so they have

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.960
everything on us.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:08.450
Our health records, our employment records...

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:15.390
And the danger of that, as Hannah Arendt points
out in Origins Of Totalitarianism, is that

00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:21.269
when a government has wholesale surveillance
of an entire population it's not because they're

00:35:21.269 --> 00:35:23.170
looking for crime.

00:35:23.170 --> 00:35:25.810
It's because they have information...

00:35:25.810 --> 00:35:32.160
And we saw that, especially under Stalinism
where they pull up your file, and they will

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:38.480
find something for which they will criminalize
you for.

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:46.450
And you can be sure that in a moment, of societal
break down, our corporate masters will use

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.450
it.

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:53.220
And we also remember that in the United States,
70% of all government intelligence is contracted

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:57.950
out to corporations like Booz Allen Hamilton.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:01.541
And you can be sure they're not just spying
on us for the US government.

00:36:01.541 --> 00:36:04.859
HN: But what do you see do as a solution?

00:36:04.859 --> 00:36:06.170
Not be on Facebook?

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:12.220
CH: Well, I mean there are other issues with
Facebook, you can read Empire of Illusion

00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.220
about that.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:19.769
I mean it's, Facebook is about that whole,
you know, me the life movie.

00:36:19.769 --> 00:36:21.430
It's about presentation.

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:26.640
It's not about truth.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:39.680
Yeah, and it kind of sucks you into this black
hole of narcissism and trivia, and it's a

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:42.339
giant waste of time.

00:36:42.339 --> 00:36:48.309
And it hands to the owners of Facebook all
of your personal data, all of your friends

00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:49.770
personal data that they sell.

00:36:49.770 --> 00:36:51.050
That's the business model.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:56.799
You know and this kind of thing about people
being surprised at Cambridge analytic kind

00:36:56.799 --> 00:36:57.799
of...

00:36:57.799 --> 00:37:02.220
No, no, that's their business model, that's
why they have Facebook, that's why their stock

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.220
is worth so much.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:14.790
Well it's declined but I mean, so it's very
hard to escape from the electronic tentacles.

00:37:14.790 --> 00:37:16.799
But when we are, I'll give an example.

00:37:16.799 --> 00:37:24.290
So I was in Zuccotti Park during the Occupy
Movement quite a bit and after the Mayor of

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:29.850
Bloomberg attempted to seize the park and
failed, it was clear to the activist that

00:37:29.850 --> 00:37:31.310
they would come again.

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:36.070
But this time they would come without any
warning, probably as they did in the middle

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:37.490
of the night.

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:47.670
CH: And so the direct action committee wanted
to prepare some kind of surprise for the NYPD.

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:52.980
So they all came down to my house in Princeton
slept all over my floor.

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:56.480
And everybody sat at the dining room table.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:00.230
All electronic devices were, this was before
Snowden.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:02.430
All, they were very prescient.

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:05.089
All electronic devices were put in the car.

00:38:05.089 --> 00:38:07.900
Phones, computers, everything in the car in
the driveway.

00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:08.900
Nobody spoke.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:12.290
Everybody wrote on pieces of paper and handed
them back and forth and then we burned them

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:14.359
in the fireplace.

00:38:14.359 --> 00:38:15.359
[laughter]

00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:23.859
CH: And when the NYPD came, they stormed the
park and it was pretty brutal.

00:38:23.859 --> 00:38:28.430
And they got to the kitchen area in the center
of the park, and they found 20 activists chained

00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:31.880
to the kitchen and they didn't have chain
cutters.

00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:36.640
And that was a big, it was like, you don't
know everything.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:40.380
It was puric and yet kind of cool.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:41.380
[laughter]

00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:48.269
CH: So I think we have to be aware of how,
and I think one of the things that's been

00:38:48.269 --> 00:38:54.500
so, was so disturbing after Barack Obama in
a nationally coordinated effort shut down

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.339
all occupy encampments in America.

00:38:58.339 --> 00:39:03.099
Was that because these people had communicated
through electronic devices, they knew who

00:39:03.099 --> 00:39:05.530
the key figures were.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:08.289
And in the months following, I can speak,
I'm sure it was national.

00:39:08.289 --> 00:39:12.970
But I know from New York, there were, and
it didn't get much reporting, but they were

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:17.970
bursting into lofts where people were squatting
and stealing all their computer equipment.

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:21.910
They were taking, I mean it's not a surprise.

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.580
They got the right people.

00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:28.730
They were taking them and fabricating felony
convictions against them.

00:39:28.730 --> 00:39:30.760
Then forcing them to plea out.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:41.829
So, for instance, one activist was charged
with holding a pair of scissors, and carrying

00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:46.170
out what was called an attempted assault,
a deadly assault against a police officer.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:49.000
Now they filmed Zuccotti 24 hours a day.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.400
CH: But of course they didn't film that assault
because it didn't exist.

00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:59.579
And it was his word against the cops.

00:39:59.579 --> 00:40:02.990
And he had to plea out on a five year felony
conviction.

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:07.340
Which means, that if they pick him up for
anything else he goes to prison for seven

00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.340
years.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:13.769
And that was a very effective technique to
neuter the best activist.

00:40:13.769 --> 00:40:14.769
There's a very...

00:40:14.769 --> 00:40:17.000
It's very dark what's happening.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.990
It's subterranean because all of the resistance
is subterranean.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:30.630
If you watch the 24 hour burlesque show on
CNN, you won't see it.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:39.269
You'll see a porn star and her lawyer who
now wants to run for president and Omarosa

00:40:39.269 --> 00:40:41.790
who has about as much credibility as Donald
Trump.

00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:44.630
That's, and they love it.

00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:46.009
They make money on it.

00:40:46.009 --> 00:40:48.789
It's entertainment, has zero to do with news.

00:40:48.789 --> 00:40:58.839
Meanwhile these very serious movements are
taking place within the country.

00:40:58.839 --> 00:41:03.380
And I would also add, there's very profound
suffering.

00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.859
By at least half the population or more.

00:41:06.859 --> 00:41:11.529
CH: And they're rendered utterly invisible
and I think that's why the credibility and

00:41:11.529 --> 00:41:17.170
I think rightly so of the press and most people
when they speak of the press now speak of

00:41:17.170 --> 00:41:18.560
the electronic media.

00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.420
The commercial electronic media is so low.

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:29.250
I don't know what it is, 9% or, I mean it's
stats really, I think it might be below 10%.

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:35.390
Because the pain and the dislocation and the
injustices that have been carried out are

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.859
ignored by the elite.

00:41:37.859 --> 00:41:43.170
And they've all become, like courtiers in
Louis Catores and Versailles.

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:49.430
You know commenting on which mistress he took
into the bedchamber.

00:41:49.430 --> 00:42:00.220
While the real world, what's happening outside
their version of the forbidden city is completely

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:04.250
unreported and more dangerously unknown.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:09.150
So when the Republican establishment wants
to destroy Trump during the primaries remember

00:42:09.150 --> 00:42:11.890
who they trotted out to destroy him?

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:15.019
The big gun: Mitt Romney.

00:42:15.019 --> 00:42:17.230
Wow, Trump's finished there you know.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:23.720
HN: You know, you talk about the need to create
alliances and listen to people unlike ourselves.

00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:27.619
And you are critical of people who write off
Trump supporters.

00:42:27.619 --> 00:42:33.740
You say in the book: "The left often dismisses
Trump supporters as irredeemable racists and

00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:35.990
bigots, ignoring their betrayal and suffering."

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:42.430
Yet, in the same chapter, you also called
president Trump an imbecile and a narcissist.

00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:45.089
Do you see any contradictions in that message?

00:42:45.089 --> 00:42:46.089
CH: No.

00:42:46.089 --> 00:42:47.660
No, because Trump has power.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.000
They don't.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.759
I went to divinity school and that whole issue
of forgiveness.

00:42:54.759 --> 00:42:59.599
And although I did have a great theology professor
who once told me: "Only God forgives."

00:42:59.599 --> 00:43:07.269
HN: But if the goal is to create alliances
with people and he has people who...

00:43:07.269 --> 00:43:09.450
CH: But we're talking about power.

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:13.369
When people are carrying out...

00:43:13.369 --> 00:43:15.200
Let's call it for what it is.

00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.510
Khan called it "radical evil".

00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.700
When people carry out...

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:23.390
When people are empowered to the extent that
they are destroying and crushing human lives,

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:27.579
ripping children from their mother's arms.

00:43:27.579 --> 00:43:33.900
And then putting these children in warehouses
where they are drugged and abused.

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:41.309
When they are carrying out militarized drone
attacks, terrorizing citizens across the Middle

00:43:41.309 --> 00:43:44.319
East, including, of course, in Pakistan.

00:43:44.319 --> 00:43:51.840
When they are unleashing militarized police
to gun down citizens in the street.

00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:59.910
When they are forcing families whose sons
or daughters are ill into bankruptcy to save

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.230
their children.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:07.519
Then we have every right to call them out
for who they are.

00:44:07.519 --> 00:44:10.700
[applause]

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:21.079
CH: And I look at the Trump supporters ultimately
as victims.

00:44:21.079 --> 00:44:24.220
I don't defend their racism, their Islamophobia,
their homophobia...

00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:26.349
All of that.

00:44:26.349 --> 00:44:28.420
Of course, their misogyny.

00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:30.089
But they are victims.

00:44:30.089 --> 00:44:33.540
And I learned that lesson when I wrote my
book on the Christian Right.

00:44:33.540 --> 00:44:34.859
HN: Victims of what?

00:44:34.859 --> 00:44:41.349
CH: They are victims of a system that has
cast them aside, crushed their dreams and

00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:43.510
their hopes.

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:48.359
Told them that they are worthless and have
nothing to contribute.

00:44:48.359 --> 00:44:56.769
They have reacted the way victims often react
in a society by demonizing the vulnerable.

00:44:56.769 --> 00:45:04.099
Let's be clear you have systems of indoctrination
that spew this garbage out over the airwaves

00:45:04.099 --> 00:45:14.069
and critics of the power elites, such as myself,
have been effectively shut out.

00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:16.359
So they're being bombarded by Fox News.

00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:21.339
I mean talk about fake news.

00:45:21.339 --> 00:45:24.970
This whole debate on the Russiagate...

00:45:24.970 --> 00:45:29.069
I'm thinking: No, if you want to go after
the foreign government that has most interfered

00:45:29.069 --> 00:45:33.480
in American elections that's Israel.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:35.590
[applause]

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:41.930
CH: If you want to go after fake news, we've
got it on cable channels and on the radio.

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:42.930
Sean Hannity?

00:45:42.930 --> 00:45:44.349
I mean this is not sane.

00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:46.160
I mean this guy.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.339
And they have huge corporate sponsors.

00:45:48.339 --> 00:45:50.130
They make tons of money.

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:58.000
So you have a powerful system of indoctrination
coupled with people who have bought this,

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.599
as we spoke about earlier, this belief that
what's happened to them is an assault against

00:46:02.599 --> 00:46:04.970
their national identity.

00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:09.470
It's been taken away from them by Muslims,
by...

00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:10.990
I mean it's of course absurd.

00:46:10.990 --> 00:46:12.759
Undocumented workers.

00:46:12.759 --> 00:46:15.650
Women, African Americans...

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:17.710
You know, the list.

00:46:17.710 --> 00:46:20.799
And in degenerate societies...

00:46:20.799 --> 00:46:23.450
This is what I saw in Yugoslavia.

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:24.549
We can watch it in India.

00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:28.720
I mean how far is Modi from this?

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:29.720
That's what happens.

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:38.800
CH: The power elite seek to divert this legitimate
rage towards the weak.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:45.440
And so these people have been betrayed.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:55.240
The way that they're reacting is indefensible
and ultimately self-destructive.

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:59.029
But that is what happens in diseased and decayed
society.

00:46:59.029 --> 00:47:02.920
I was in Montgomery, Alabama with a great
civil rights attorney, Bryan Stevenson, and

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.450
we were walking through the city.

00:47:04.450 --> 00:47:08.720
And Bryan was showing me all the Confederate
monuments in the city.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:14.470
And then he said: "You know, most of these
have been put up in the last 10 years."

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:18.779
And I said: "That is the exactly what happened
with the breakdown of Yugoslavia."

00:47:18.779 --> 00:47:24.829
All these Yugoslavs suddenly became Serb nationalists
or Croat nationalists.

00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:27.420
CH: I remember being...

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:29.930
I was with the 5th core after the NATO bombing.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:35.410
We were moving with the doctramentous fifth
core on Banja Luka and I was on the front

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:39.279
lines and I was with a battalion of "shahids".

00:47:39.279 --> 00:47:41.319
So they all had green headbands.

00:47:41.319 --> 00:47:46.400
First of all, all these Muslims and Bosniaks
could drink you, me and anyone else in this

00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:47.550
room out of the table.

00:47:47.550 --> 00:47:49.519
They hadn't ever been in a mosque.

00:47:49.519 --> 00:47:51.980
It was kind of like the Christian Right.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:55.270
They knew a few kind of catchwords and cliches.

00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:57.140
So I'm with this battalion of...

00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:03.700
You know, who are being demonize of course
by the West, and they find out that I'd spent

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.240
seven years in Middle East and I spoke Arabic.

00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:09.180
And then they all wanted to know if I'd read
the Koran.

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:13.650
And I was the only one of 900 people [laughter]
who had actually read the Koran.

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:21.140
HN: So I'm told we're gonna take some questions
but I did wanna but give you a chance to answer

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:25.869
one criticism people have of your work, which
is that your message is too bleak.

00:48:25.869 --> 00:48:26.869
It's too hopeless.

00:48:26.869 --> 00:48:27.869
[laughter]

00:48:27.869 --> 00:48:28.869
CH: But my answer is...

00:48:28.869 --> 00:48:34.230
HN: What do you say to those people?

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:37.405
CH: Right, I didn't make it up.

00:48:37.405 --> 00:48:38.405
[applause]

00:48:38.405 --> 00:48:42.329
CH: I mean I read climate change reports,
and it's pretty bleak and pretty frightening

00:48:42.329 --> 00:48:48.039
and we don't have much time left and we'd
better realize how bleak it is and we better

00:48:48.039 --> 00:48:52.339
rise up and get rid of these people or they
are going to extinguish the human race.

00:48:52.339 --> 00:48:53.339
[applause]

00:48:53.339 --> 00:48:53.340
