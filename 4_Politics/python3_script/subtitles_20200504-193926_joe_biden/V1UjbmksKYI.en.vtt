00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 align:start position:0%
we catch off it it's also non flammable
 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.250 align:start position:0%
we catch off it it's also non flammable
you<00:04:52.350><c> know</c><00:04:52.440><c> it's</c><00:04:52.620><c> not</c><00:04:52.800><c> burning</c><00:04:53.370><c> a</c><00:04:53.580><c> bushfire</c>

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 align:start position:0%
you know it's not burning a bushfire

you know it's not burning a bushfire
absolutely<00:04:55.260><c> so</c><00:04:55.410><c> this</c><00:04:55.560><c> gravel</c><00:04:56.010><c> is</c><00:04:56.100><c> actually</c>

absolutely so this gravel is actually
 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.140 align:start position:0%
absolutely so this gravel is actually
acting<00:04:56.640><c> like</c><00:04:56.729><c> a</c>

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 align:start position:0%

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
so how does the rainwater collection
 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.340 align:start position:0%
so how does the rainwater collection
here<00:04:58.710><c> work</c><00:04:59.000><c> yeah</c><00:05:00.000><c> you</c><00:05:00.060><c> can</c><00:05:00.390><c> see</c><00:05:00.630><c> at</c><00:05:00.930><c> the</c><00:05:01.110><c> back</c>

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.350 align:start position:0%

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:03.620 align:start position:0%
here work yeah you can see at the back
that's<00:05:01.770><c> sort</c><00:05:02.070><c> of</c><00:05:02.100><c> like</c><00:05:02.160><c> a</c><00:05:02.280><c> box</c><00:05:02.640><c> where</c><00:05:03.000><c> all</c><00:05:03.360><c> the</c>

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
water that falls on that roof there's a
 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.000 align:start position:0%

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 align:start position:0%
rubber sheet to waterproof the roof so
 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
rubber sheet to waterproof the roof so

after the water passes through the

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 align:start position:0%
gravel it hits the rubber sheet and all
 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.550 align:start position:0%
gravel it hits the rubber sheet and all
drains<00:05:11.970><c> to</c><00:05:12.180><c> a</c><00:05:12.210><c> box</c><00:05:12.540><c> and</c><00:05:12.840><c> from</c><00:05:12.900><c> that</c><00:05:13.080><c> box</c><00:05:13.350><c> it</c>

drains to a box and from that box it
 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.310 align:start position:0%
drains to a box and from that box it
gets<00:05:13.710><c> split</c><00:05:13.950><c> out</c><00:05:14.190><c> to</c><00:05:14.430><c> bury</c><00:05:15.150><c> tanks</c><00:05:15.690><c> means</c><00:05:16.200><c> they</c>

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
things another thing I really love about
 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.330 align:start position:0%
things another thing I really love about
is<00:05:42.870><c> the</c><00:05:43.050><c> symmetry</c><00:05:43.380><c> of</c><00:05:43.770><c> it</c><00:05:43.890><c> like</c><00:05:44.070><c> when</c><00:05:44.220><c> you're</c>

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 align:start position:0%
is the symmetry of it like when you're
 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.980 align:start position:0%
is the symmetry of it like when you're
looking<00:05:44.580><c> from</c><00:05:44.790><c> the</c><00:05:44.910><c> front</c><00:05:45.150><c> of</c><00:05:45.210><c> it</c><00:05:45.360><c> there's</c>

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 align:start position:0%
looking from the front of it there's
 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.470 align:start position:0%
looking from the front of it there's
this<00:05:46.140><c> beautiful</c><00:05:46.380><c> symmetry</c><00:05:46.980><c> to</c><00:05:47.310><c> it</c><00:05:47.460><c> I'm</c><00:05:47.970><c> not</c>

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
this beautiful symmetry to it I'm not
 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
this beautiful symmetry to it I'm not
sure<00:05:48.720><c> but</c><00:05:49.020><c> I</c><00:05:49.050><c> suspect</c><00:05:49.590><c> one</c><00:05:49.950><c> of</c><00:05:50.070><c> the</c><00:05:50.570><c> intangible</c>

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 align:start position:0%
sure but I suspect one of the intangible
 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.420 align:start position:0%
sure but I suspect one of the intangible
things<00:05:51.930><c> that</c><00:05:52.320><c> makes</c><00:05:52.740><c> people</c><00:05:53.100><c> love</c><00:05:53.250><c> the</c>

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:53.430 align:start position:0%
things that makes people love the
 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:56.060 align:start position:0%
things that makes people love the
Earthship<00:05:53.820><c> is</c><00:05:54.030><c> those</c><00:05:54.540><c> curves</c><00:05:54.870><c> like</c><00:05:55.410><c> it's</c><00:05:55.830><c> so</c>

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 align:start position:0%
Earthship is those curves like it's so
 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.640 align:start position:0%
Earthship is those curves like it's so
different<00:05:56.310><c> to</c><00:05:56.520><c> the</c><00:05:56.730><c> usual</c><00:05:57.120><c> sort</c><00:05:57.450><c> of</c><00:05:57.650><c> boxy</c>

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 align:start position:0%
different to the usual sort of boxy
 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.860 align:start position:0%
different to the usual sort of boxy
shapes<00:05:59.040><c> that</c><00:05:59.400><c> we're</c><00:05:59.760><c> all</c><00:05:59.910><c> familiar</c><00:06:00.090><c> with</c><00:06:00.510><c> so</c>

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 align:start position:0%
shapes that we're all familiar with so
 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.260 align:start position:0%
shapes that we're all familiar with so
yeah<00:06:01.860><c> I</c><00:06:01.890><c> think</c><00:06:02.160><c> the</c><00:06:02.370><c> curves</c><00:06:02.580><c> are</c><00:06:02.790><c> what</c><00:06:02.910><c> do</c><00:06:03.120><c> it</c>

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the curves are what do it
 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.330 align:start position:0%
yeah I think the curves are what do it
for<00:06:03.510><c> people</c><00:06:03.680><c> should</c><00:06:04.680><c> we</c><00:06:04.740><c> go</c><00:06:04.860><c> and</c><00:06:05.010><c> see</c><00:06:05.130><c> if</c><00:06:05.220><c> those</c>

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
for people should we go and see if those
 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
for people should we go and see if those
curves<00:06:05.640><c> are</c><00:06:05.820><c> continued</c><00:06:06.180><c> on</c><00:06:06.330><c> the</c><00:06:06.420><c> inside</c><00:06:06.720><c> let's</c>

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 align:start position:0%
curves are continued on the inside let's
 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:14.600 align:start position:0%
curves are continued on the inside let's
do<00:06:07.260><c> that</c><00:06:07.410><c> all</c><00:06:07.560><c> right</c><00:06:07.800><c> let's</c><00:06:08.070><c> take</c><00:06:08.190><c> a</c><00:06:08.250><c> look</c><00:06:13.610><c> come</c>

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 align:start position:0%
do that all right let's take a look come
 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.150 align:start position:0%
do that all right let's take a look come
on<00:06:14.670><c> in</c><00:06:14.820><c> Bryce</c><00:06:15.030><c> thank</c><00:06:15.510><c> you</c>

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
on in Bryce thank you
 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.760 align:start position:0%
on in Bryce thank you
this<00:06:17.160><c> is</c><00:06:17.370><c> the</c><00:06:17.610><c> entry</c><00:06:18.210><c> room</c><00:06:18.390><c> and</c><00:06:18.630><c> it's</c><00:06:19.320><c> also</c><00:06:19.590><c> a</c>

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 align:start position:0%
this is the entry room and it's also a
 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
this is the entry room and it's also a
little<00:06:19.920><c> utility</c><00:06:20.220><c> room</c><00:06:20.820><c> so</c><00:06:21.500><c> in</c><00:06:22.500><c> here</c><00:06:22.800><c> you've</c>

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 align:start position:0%
little utility room so in here you've
 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
little utility room so in here you've
got<00:06:23.250><c> a</c><00:06:23.460><c> battery</c><00:06:23.940><c> bank</c><00:06:24.150><c> about</c><00:06:24.630><c> 14</c><00:06:25.140><c> kilowatt</c>

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:26.010 align:start position:0%
got a battery bank about 14 kilowatt
 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.060 align:start position:0%
got a battery bank about 14 kilowatt
hours<00:06:26.400><c> of</c><00:06:26.430><c> batteries</c><00:06:27.090><c> so</c><00:06:27.450><c> I</c><00:06:27.870><c> think</c><00:06:28.590><c> something</c>

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.070 align:start position:0%
hours of batteries so I think something
 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.890 align:start position:0%
hours of batteries so I think something
like<00:06:29.190><c> the</c><00:06:29.340><c> tesla</c><00:06:29.730><c> powerwall</c><00:06:29.910><c> was</c><00:06:30.390><c> about</c><00:06:30.630><c> 10</c>

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 align:start position:0%
like the tesla powerwall was about 10
 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
like the tesla powerwall was about 10
kilowatt<00:06:31.320><c> hours</c><00:06:31.680><c> so</c><00:06:32.160><c> a</c><00:06:32.490><c> little</c><00:06:32.790><c> bit</c><00:06:32.880><c> bigger</c>

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:33.090 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours so a little bit bigger
 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.420 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours so a little bit bigger
yeah<00:06:33.510><c> and</c><00:06:33.690><c> that's</c><00:06:33.780><c> the</c><00:06:33.930><c> old-school</c><00:06:34.410><c> wet</c><00:06:34.980><c> acid</c>

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's the old-school wet acid
 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.550 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's the old-school wet acid
battery<00:06:36.120><c> type</c><00:06:36.330><c> technology</c><00:06:36.960><c> but</c><00:06:37.260><c> it's</c><00:06:37.410><c> all</c>

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
battery type technology but it's all
 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.530 align:start position:0%
battery type technology but it's all

also<00:07:36.600><c> another</c><00:07:37.380><c> amazing</c><00:07:37.710><c> part</c><00:07:38.160><c> of</c><00:07:38.280><c> this</c><00:07:38.490><c> is</c>

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:38.790 align:start position:0%
also another amazing part of this is
 

00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:41.930 align:start position:0%
also another amazing part of this is
that<00:07:39.450><c> it</c><00:07:39.660><c> is</c><00:07:40.110><c> a</c><00:07:40.350><c> wastewater</c><00:07:41.010><c> treatment</c><00:07:41.280><c> system</c>

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:41.940 align:start position:0%
that it is a wastewater treatment system
 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:44.840 align:start position:0%
that it is a wastewater treatment system
so<00:07:42.810><c> the</c><00:07:43.260><c> idea</c><00:07:43.650><c> is</c><00:07:43.860><c> that</c><00:07:44.130><c> whenever</c><00:07:44.400><c> you</c><00:07:44.580><c> have</c><00:07:44.670><c> a</c>

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
because that's the question a lot of
 

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.850 align:start position:0%
because that's the question a lot of

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:21.860 align:start position:0%
people ask and the answer is not really
 

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.380 align:start position:0%

so<00:10:22.860><c> typically</c><00:10:23.490><c> what</c><00:10:23.700><c> will</c><00:10:23.790><c> happen</c><00:10:24.120><c> is</c><00:10:24.210><c> it</c><00:10:24.360><c> can</c>

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:24.390 align:start position:0%
so typically what will happen is it can
 

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
so typically what will happen is it can

00:12:00.359 --> 00:12:00.369 align:start position:0%

00:12:12.809 --> 00:12:12.819 align:start position:0%
into so as the air passes through them
 

00:12:12.819 --> 00:12:15.359 align:start position:0%

it<00:12:13.689><c> changes</c><00:12:14.259><c> temperature</c><00:12:14.799><c> to</c><00:12:14.919><c> that</c><00:12:15.069><c> stable</c>

00:12:15.359 --> 00:12:15.369 align:start position:0%
it changes temperature to that stable

also got the air speed it's really
 

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:43.799 align:start position:0%
also got the air speed it's really

important that the air moves through
 

00:12:43.809 --> 00:12:46.349 align:start position:0%
important that the air moves through
slowly<00:12:44.459><c> if</c><00:12:45.459><c> it</c><00:12:45.639><c> comes</c><00:12:45.939><c> through</c><00:12:45.999><c> too</c><00:12:46.329><c> quickly</c>

00:12:46.349 --> 00:12:46.359 align:start position:0%
slowly if it comes through too quickly
 

00:12:46.359 --> 00:12:47.969 align:start position:0%
slowly if it comes through too quickly
it<00:12:46.989><c> doesn't</c><00:12:47.139><c> have</c><00:12:47.349><c> time</c><00:12:47.559><c> to</c><00:12:47.619><c> change</c>

00:12:47.969 --> 00:12:47.979 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have time to change
 

00:12:47.979 --> 00:12:50.129 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have time to change
temperature<00:12:48.399><c> and</c><00:12:48.819><c> so</c><00:12:49.359><c> what</c><00:12:49.509><c> I'm</c><00:12:49.629><c> finding</c><00:12:49.959><c> with</c>

00:12:50.129 --> 00:12:50.139 align:start position:0%
temperature and so what I'm finding with
 

00:12:50.139 --> 00:12:52.559 align:start position:0%
temperature and so what I'm finding with
this<00:12:50.469><c> it</c><00:12:50.799><c> can</c><00:12:50.859><c> be</c><00:12:51.069><c> 40</c><00:12:51.429><c> degrees</c><00:12:51.489><c> outside</c><00:12:51.999><c> and</c>

00:12:52.559 --> 00:12:52.569 align:start position:0%
this it can be 40 degrees outside and
 

00:12:52.569 --> 00:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
this it can be 40 degrees outside and
the<00:12:52.839><c> air</c><00:12:52.959><c> coming</c><00:12:53.259><c> through</c><00:12:53.379><c> here</c><00:12:53.769><c> is</c><00:12:53.859><c> 20</c>

00:12:54.239 --> 00:12:54.249 align:start position:0%
the air coming through here is 20
 

00:12:54.249 --> 00:12:56.819 align:start position:0%
the air coming through here is 20
degrees<00:12:54.639><c> so</c><00:12:55.419><c> it's</c><00:12:55.779><c> much</c><00:12:56.169><c> much</c><00:12:56.439><c> better</c><00:12:56.679><c> than</c>

00:12:56.819 --> 00:12:56.829 align:start position:0%
degrees so it's much much better than
 

00:12:56.829 --> 00:12:58.529 align:start position:0%
degrees so it's much much better than
opening<00:12:57.309><c> up</c><00:12:57.429><c> a</c><00:12:57.549><c> window</c><00:12:57.699><c> or</c><00:12:58.089><c> something</c><00:12:58.269><c> like</c>

00:12:58.529 --> 00:12:58.539 align:start position:0%
opening up a window or something like
 

00:12:58.539 --> 00:13:01.469 align:start position:0%
opening up a window or something like
that<00:12:58.599><c> and</c><00:12:59.169><c> in</c><00:12:59.619><c> the</c><00:12:59.709><c> winter</c><00:13:00.069><c> it</c><00:13:00.339><c> warms</c><00:13:01.299><c> the</c><00:13:01.449><c> air</c>

00:13:01.469 --> 00:13:01.479 align:start position:0%
that and in the winter it warms the air
 

00:13:01.479 --> 00:13:04.019 align:start position:0%
that and in the winter it warms the air
up<00:13:01.919><c> so</c><00:13:02.919><c> it</c><00:13:02.979><c> really</c><00:13:03.159><c> is</c><00:13:03.339><c> just</c><00:13:03.369><c> like</c><00:13:03.579><c> having</c><00:13:03.849><c> a</c>

00:13:04.019 --> 00:13:04.029 align:start position:0%
