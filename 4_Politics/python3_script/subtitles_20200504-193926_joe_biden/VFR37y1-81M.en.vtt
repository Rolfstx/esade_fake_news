00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.230
- [Ryan] This week on Buzzfeed Unsolved

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.060
we investigate the
Cleveland Torso Murderer,

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.750
one of the most gruesome
serial killers of all time.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.860
- That's a, that's a hell
of an accomplishment.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.610
- He's not the most definitively,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.930
but I will say he's one of the most.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.890
He's in the upper echelon for sure.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.570
It's not a shiny badge of
honor on anyone's part.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.530
- You sound like you're impressed.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.040
- I'm not impressed, the things he did

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.559
were pretty, for lack of a better term,

00:00:19.559 --> 00:00:20.980
gross
- Wonderful?

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.900
- Gross.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.220
- Okay, whatever you say.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.470
Between 1934 and 1938 in Cleveland Ohio,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.540
near Kingsbury Run, 13 people,

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.410
comprised of six women and seven men

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.508
were killed by a serial killer.

00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:39.062
Of those 13 only three were identified.

00:00:39.062 --> 00:00:43.360
And almost all of them were
vagrants or sex workers.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.000
All of the victims were decapitated,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.880
and in some cases the
head was never found.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.720
- He just killed anybody.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.650
You also will see, he
killed all ages as well,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:56.100
like this guy just didn't give a shit.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.830
- He's just death.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.470
- The killer often dismembered
the body through the torso.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.550
And in no instance was a
body found fully intact.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.010
These gruesome tendencies
earned the killer the name the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.010
Cleveland Torso Killer or the
Mad Butcher of Kingsbury Run.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.830
Here's a little background
on Kingsbury Run.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.219
In the 1930's, Cleveland's Kingsbury Run

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:21.509
was a bleak, dangerous place,

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.030
where many poor lived
in terrible conditions.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.980
Sometimes called, a quote,
hobo jungle, end quote.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.720
Just east of Kingsbury
Run was a sketchy area

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.110
called the Roaring Third,
known for it's bars,

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.320
gambling dens, and brothels.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.370
- [Shane] I'm into
that, I like that place.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.203
- [Ryan] The Roaring Third?

00:01:40.203 --> 00:01:41.036
- [Shane] Yeah!

00:01:41.036 --> 00:01:41.869
- [Ryan] Is that a
place you would frequent

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:42.702
back in the day?
- [Shane] I'd be there!

00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:43.535
- [Ryan] You'd be dead.

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:44.368
- [Shane] It's got...

00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:45.720
- [Ryan] He'd see you,
he'd see those long limbs,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.290
and he'd say oh man I got some
big ornaments to make here.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.260
- Bars, gambling dens, and brothels.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.093
- Yeah.

00:01:52.093 --> 00:01:55.380
- Now, currently, now a
days, I said this before,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.940
but we have a lot of
entertainment at our disposal.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.695
I got YouTube, I've got my Playstation,

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:02.610
and pretty much that's it.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.220
But back then, not a lot
to amuse yourself with

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.690
so I would for sure,
every night of the week,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.920
be down at a bar, a
gambling den, or a brothel.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.070
- So this is part of the recurring theme

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.520
that you've had throughout the show,

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.104
where if there weren't
modern devices you'd be,

00:02:17.104 --> 00:02:18.910
- An insane psychopath.
- I'd be a monster.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.743
Yes.

00:02:19.743 --> 00:02:21.800
- [Ryan] With the stage set, let's jump

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.750
into the timeline of the killings.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.029
On September 5th, 1934, the first victim,

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.160
an unidentified woman in her 30's,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.800
was found on the shores of Lake Eerie.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.510
All that was found was part of her torso,

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.430
thighs, and other body parts.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.830
But no head.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.450
Her skin was leathery and red
from a chemical preservative.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.121
On September 23rd,
1935, the second victim,

00:02:46.121 --> 00:02:49.231
a 28 year old man named Edward Andrassy,

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:53.105
was found near Kingsbury Run,
at the base of Jackass Hill.

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:54.120
- [Shane] (giggle)

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.190
- [Ryan] That's actually
what that's named.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.416
I know that was gonna
elicit some kind of giggle.

00:02:57.416 --> 00:02:58.270
- [Shane] Sucks.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.490
- [Ryan] So just get it,

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.323
- [Shane] It sucks.

00:03:00.323 --> 00:03:01.213
- [Ryan] just get it out of the way.

00:03:01.213 --> 00:03:02.360
- [Shane] It sucks to die like that.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.600
- [Ryan] At the base of Jackass Hill?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.444
- [Shane] Yeah, where'd they find him?

00:03:05.444 --> 00:03:08.130
Oh the base of Jackass
Hill, that's not fun.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.655
- [Ryan] I'm sure they omitted
that out of the eulogy.

00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:13.480
- [Shane] Why even call
it, I guess there were

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.969
burros there at some point or a donkey?

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:18.901
- [Ryan] Andrassy was a hospital orderly

00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:21.609
and a regular around the Roaring Third.

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.680
The body was drained of
blood, naked, and emasculated.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.666
With rope burns on the wrists.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:32.280
On that same day, the third
victim was found nearby.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.800
An unidentified 40 year old male,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.920
and was also decapitated and emasculated.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.130
The body also had the
same chemical preservative

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.800
from the first killing.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.330
On January 26th, 1936, the fourth victim

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.300
a woman named Florence Polillo,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.020
was found wrapped up in newspaper
inside half bushel baskets

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.430
by the Hart Manufacturing building.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.010
Polillo was a sex worker,
barmaid, and waitress,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.070
who lived in the Roaring Third.

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.100
He's getting bolder with the
places he's dumping bodies.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.259
The first one was a
lake, the second one was

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:08.520
on the side of the hill, the third one

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.400
was nearby to the hill, and now this one,

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.340
in front of an actual workplace.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.173
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:04:13.173 --> 00:04:15.077
- [Ryan] In, you know,
a metropolitan area.

00:04:15.077 --> 00:04:19.193
On June 5th, 1936, the
head of the fifth victim,

00:04:19.193 --> 00:04:21.770
an unidentified man, was found

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.297
wrapped in trousers in Kingsbury Run,

00:04:24.297 --> 00:04:27.470
the rest of the body
was found the next day

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.530
in an even more audacious location.

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.890
In front of the Nickel Plate
Railroad Police Building.

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.580
So once again, he's escalating.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.090
- Yeah.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.440
One of the saddest parts to me is that,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.795
so many of these bodies were unidentified.

00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:43.870
- Yeah.

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.700
- Because it's just, I'm always

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.700
of the opinion that once I'm dead,

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.410
you can do anything you want with my body.

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.040
Throw it out in the street
and let the dogs eat it.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.550
But I at least want people
to look my body and go,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.723
yeah that's Shane, that was Shane,

00:04:56.723 --> 00:04:58.930
who is being eaten right now.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.560
- That's Shane in that
basset hound's mouth.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.170
- Give him a send off, whatever,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.940
say your kind words about him.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.290
- That'd be a happy dog,
that's a big ass bone.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.303
On July 22nd, 1936, the sixth victim,

00:05:11.303 --> 00:05:14.210
an unidentified 40 year old man,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.090
was found in the woods near Clinton Road.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.748
The man had been dead for two months.

00:05:19.748 --> 00:05:23.350
One noteworthy observation
was the blood on the ground,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:26.100
suggesting he had been killed on-site,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.270
and not dumped there, as
indicated by the other body sites.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.660
- [Shane] So this is
someone who's just out

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.540
walking around who gets, gets got.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:36.110
- [Ryan] Well, the thing
that is interesting

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.900
to me about this, is because
all of the other ones

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.110
have been dismembered in a way
that was medically efficient.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.080
Most likely done after death.

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.919
This is one that seems to be
done in the heat of the moment.

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.660
Which either means to me,
this is not the same guy,

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.160
or since it obviously is the same guy,

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.100
he's getting antsy, he's losing his grip,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.126
he doesn't care anymore and
he's starting to do things

00:05:58.126 --> 00:06:00.720
that aren't as premeditated.

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.820
On September 10th 1936,
the seventh victim,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.180
an unidentified man, was
found near the train tracks

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.980
in Kingsbury Run, he had
been killed by decapitation.

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.930
In a manner that the coroner
noticed was confident,

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.318
in one stroke, which
implied that the killer

00:06:17.318 --> 00:06:21.380
was both brazen and
educated in human anatomy.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.770
- [Shane] This is gross, but I think

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.460
it's hard to cut off a head.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.210
- [Ryan] It apparently is kinda hard.

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.043
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:06:28.043 --> 00:06:28.876
- [Ryan] And there was one case,

00:06:28.876 --> 00:06:30.620
where someone had, it took them,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.000
I forget which royal it
was, it was a British royal.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.833
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:06:33.833 --> 00:06:35.490
- [Ryan] It took five strokes.

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.690
Also, another thing,
you are slightly alive.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.140
I was reading this one
recorded case of a guy,

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.730
who watched someones head get
cut off by the guillotine.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.060
He said the head rolled around,

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.350
and he saw the guys eyes,

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.183
- He blinked?

00:06:48.183 --> 00:06:49.660
- He blinked, and he saw recognition

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.890
in the eyes when he said his name.

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:53.280
- Wasn't there an old tale of someone who

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.640
for science, told the
person getting executed

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.155
to blink as long as they could?

00:06:57.155 --> 00:06:59.110
- Oh see that's kinda cool.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.960
- Yeah that's pretty cool.

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.530
- But if you were a piece
of shit your whole life,

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.500
and you're getting executed
because you're an awful person,

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.333
the lease you could do,

00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:05.821
- You could do this thing for science.

00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:06.654
- One solid on the way out.

00:07:06.654 --> 00:07:08.530
- For science man, give
us a little something.

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.260
- It'd be better to not
blink, but if they were like,

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.730
would you give us a,

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:13.563
- A wink?

00:07:13.563 --> 00:07:14.640
(laughs)

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.760
- Cause your vocal cords are gone, right,

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.593
so but you could wink.

00:07:16.593 --> 00:07:18.210
- I mean I guess it depends, if they,

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.430
I would ask them to chop it
just below the vocal cords,

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:23.060
so I could roll over and be like,

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.418
♪ Hello my baby, hello ♪

00:07:24.418 --> 00:07:25.251
(laughs)

00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:27.690
- [Ryan] At this point
many local papers reported

00:07:27.690 --> 00:07:30.160
the murder spree on a near daily basis,

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:33.435
and yet, there were no suspects or clues.

00:07:33.435 --> 00:07:37.142
As expected, this put a
considerable amount of heat

00:07:37.142 --> 00:07:39.250
on the investigating authorities.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:42.030
Detectives Peter Merylo
and Martin Zelewski

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.423
interviewed over 1,500
people on their own.

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:48.190
Here's even a picture of Detective Merylo

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.610
undercover as a vagrant.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.988
- [Shane] That is the most
cartoonish hobo I've ever seen.

00:07:53.988 --> 00:07:54.821
- [Ryan] Is the most (laughs)

00:07:54.821 --> 00:07:56.720
- [Shane] He looked like he
watched Bugs Bunny cartoons,

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.690
in which Bugs Bunny was on the railroad.

00:07:59.690 --> 00:08:01.380
And was like, yup, that'll do.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.740
- [Ryan] You think he
has like a couple PB J's

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.573
in that little bag there?

00:08:03.573 --> 00:08:04.406
- [Shane] Probably.

00:08:04.406 --> 00:08:06.360
- Maybe this is like accurate to the time.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.210
- I don't think it was.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:09.650
- So you think that he was just like,

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:11.340
I bet you this is what vagrants look like,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.978
and he went out there and he was like

00:08:12.978 --> 00:08:15.360
jesus christ I don't
look anything like them.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.302
- Probably.

00:08:16.302 --> 00:08:20.882
Probably actual people who
looked like real human beings

00:08:20.882 --> 00:08:23.610
and then this guy walking
up like he walked off

00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.810
the Warner Brothers set.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.760
- [Ryan] Jumping back into the timeline,

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.760
on February 23rd, 1937,
parts of the eighth victim,

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.170
an unidentified woman in her 20's,

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:38.120
were found on the shore
east of Brahtenahl.

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:41.910
On June 5th, 1937, the ninth victim,

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:44.620
determined to be a
woman name Rose Wallace,

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.210
was found under the
Lorain-Carnegie Bridge.

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.670
Her remains were merely a
skull and a bag of bones.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:55.530
On July 6th, 1937, the tenth victim,

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.520
an unidentified man in
his mid to late 30's,

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.550
was found in the Cuyahoga River.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:04.460
His heart was ripped out and
the abdominal area was gutted.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.160
The proximity of the killings
are starting to shrink here.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:08.630
- [Shane] He got to enjoy
fourth of July though,

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.610
which is my favorite holiday.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.810
- [Ryan] I guess he did.

00:09:13.176 --> 00:09:15.770
- [Shane] I think that's
fun, it's a good holiday.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.519
- Yeah I suppose if I
had to choose between

00:09:17.519 --> 00:09:19.830
getting murdered July 3rd or July 6th,

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:21.120
I'd choose July 6th.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:22.970
- Always a silver lining,
that's what I'm saying.

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.290
- With a belly full of hot dogs and brew.

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.123
- Yeah.

00:09:26.123 --> 00:09:28.590
- [Ryan] In April/May of 1938,

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:31.730
parts of the eleventh
victim, an unidentified woman

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.740
was found in the Cuyahoga River.

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.820
Interestingly, this was the first time

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:38.210
that a victim had drugs in their system.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.730
This left authorities to
wonder whether the drugs

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:44.337
were recreational or used
to keep her from moving.

00:09:44.337 --> 00:09:46.760
Maybe this contributes to why the stokes

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.710
were so confident, and so absolute.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:49.660
- [Shane] Cause they weren't moving?

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.897
- [Ryan] Because they weren't moving.

00:09:50.897 --> 00:09:51.730
- [Shane] Hmmm.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:52.720
- [Ryan] And the only reason I posit this,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.530
is because drugs may be involved in

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.620
one of the case's main suspects, later.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.914
- Okay.

00:09:57.914 --> 00:10:01.280
Pretty horrifying to imagine
that you were drugged

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.550
and you can only just move your eyes.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:04.383
Have you ever had that?

00:10:04.383 --> 00:10:05.216
Is that in a movie?

00:10:05.216 --> 00:10:06.302
- That's in Wolf Creek.

00:10:06.302 --> 00:10:07.135
- Yeah.

00:10:07.135 --> 00:10:09.550
- A serial killer cuts
someone's spinal cord,

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.960
so they can't move, so
they're forced to just watch

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.060
what's happening to their friend.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.040
- But their eyes can move.

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.000
- But their eyes can move.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.833
- That's horrifying.

00:10:15.833 --> 00:10:16.950
- It is pretty scary.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.640
As all of these gruesome
murders were ongoing,

00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.280
Mayor Harold Burton,
increasingly pressured

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.040
Safety Director Eliot
Ness to make headway.

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.490
You may know Eliot Ness
as the famed G Man,

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:30.960
who led his illustrious
group of untouchables

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.109
to bust Al Capone's breweries.

00:10:33.109 --> 00:10:35.660
Other credits to Ness's glowing resume

00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:38.750
included defeating the Mayfield Road mob,

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.570
crooked police, and labor racketeers.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:45.860
Contributing to his status
as a law enforcement legend.

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.270
As City Safety Director,
Ness was involved with both

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.436
the fire and police departments,

00:10:51.436 --> 00:10:53.941
and given his decorated track record,

00:10:53.941 --> 00:10:57.713
Ness was at serious risk
of tainting his reputation

00:10:57.713 --> 00:11:01.260
should he not make
headway on the torso case.

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:05.830
With that in mind, let's
discuss the last two killings.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.827
On August 16th, 1938, the
twelfth and thirteenth victims

00:11:10.827 --> 00:11:13.750
both unidentified were found in perhaps

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:16.340
the most reckless location of all.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:20.260
The bodies were found
within view of Eliot Ness's

00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:25.150
office window, a taunt that
obviously resonated with Ness.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.030
- [Shane] Oh wow, that's bold.

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.980
- This fucking guy.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:30.510
You're gonna coast out, and you're gonna

00:11:30.510 --> 00:11:31.870
coast into retirement, right, you know?

00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:32.703
- Yeah.

00:11:32.703 --> 00:11:35.382
- Everything's great, and at the last leg,

00:11:35.382 --> 00:11:37.500
this piece of shit comes in,

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:38.333
- Yeah.

00:11:38.333 --> 00:11:39.710
- and just starts messing with you.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:42.440
Commits some of the most
grisly murders of all time.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.273
- Yeah.

00:11:43.273 --> 00:11:44.470
- In your playground.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:47.808
And then, he puts it and
rubs your nose in it.

00:11:47.808 --> 00:11:48.641
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:51.910
- [Ryan] Two days later
on August 18th, 1938,

00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:56.910
at 12:40 AM, Director Ness,
and a squadron of 35 detectives

00:11:57.010 --> 00:12:01.110
and police officers raided
Kingsbury Run's hobo jungle.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.632
They rounded up 63 men, and scoured

00:12:03.632 --> 00:12:06.870
the shacks for an sign of the killer.

00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:09.925
Most noteworthy, in a move
that has been criticized,

00:12:09.925 --> 00:12:13.540
Ness then ordered the
shacks to be burnt down,

00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:16.290
the people displaced were then charged

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:19.170
with being homeless, which
they plead guilty for.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:22.620
Ness's involvement in this
episode of the investigation

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.830
has been referred to
as cruel and draconian.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.796
- [Shane] Okay.

00:12:27.796 --> 00:12:31.714
- [Ryan] This, it, I mean,
he pretty much just said

00:12:31.714 --> 00:12:34.570
I can't find what's going
on in this part of town.

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:35.891
Let's burn it all down.

00:12:35.891 --> 00:12:39.030
- [Shane] It's literally
like a scorched earth.

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:40.870
- [Ryan] He literally went scorched earth.

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:41.703
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:12:41.703 --> 00:12:43.270
- [Ryan] According to James Badal,

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.130
the preeminent expert on this case,

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:49.020
Ness's raid was intended
to protect the transients

00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:51.410
in a bizarre and backwards way.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:55.580
Ness wanted to eliminate the
pool of potential victims,

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.300
thinking that the killer
targeted transients.

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.540
Which, to be fair, was true.

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:03.050
He also wanted the
transients' fingerprints,

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.420
in the event that they were later killed.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.497
- It feels like maybe
the fingerprint excuse,

00:13:07.497 --> 00:13:10.043
is exactly that, it's just an excuse.

00:13:10.043 --> 00:13:14.520
When people are like
hey, why you terrorizing

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.970
an entire population of people,

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.746
and setting their homes on fire?

00:13:18.746 --> 00:13:21.620
Suddenly he needed to come
up with a reason for that.

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:22.900
- He's coming to his senses.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.000
- Yeah, and going, uh, fingerprints?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.630
Like it seems like he's just
kind of back pedaling there.

00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:31.960
- He was just like, fingerprints.

00:13:32.952 --> 00:13:34.510
- Fingerprints.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.370
- I need fingerprints, that's...

00:13:37.370 --> 00:13:38.203
- Sure.

00:13:38.203 --> 00:13:41.690
- [Ryan] Either way, the
killings did stop after the raid.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.360
Whether or not the raid had anything

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.850
to do with that is debatable.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.040
Certainly, Ness's shiny
reputation was damaged

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.170
by this action, and it also
brought the investigators

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:54.850
no closer to identifying the killer.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.821
That being said, the case
is considered by some

00:13:57.821 --> 00:14:01.960
to be unofficially
solved, and furthermore,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.590
the solution was reached
partly by Ness himself.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:09.160
With that, let's get into the suspects.

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:13.570
The first suspect was 52
brick layer Frank Dolezal.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:17.830
In July of 1939, Dolezal was
arrested by county sheriff,

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.790
Martin O'Donnell, for the murder of

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:22.570
Florence Polillo, the fourth victim.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:26.430
Dolezal had actually lived
with Polillo for a time.

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.480
Furthermore, Dolezal also knew victims

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.837
Edward Andrassy and Rose Wallace.

00:14:31.837 --> 00:14:35.470
Following his arrest,
Frank Dolezal confessed,

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:37.450
to murdering Florence Polillo.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:40.429
However, he later said he had been beaten

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:43.507
and recanted his confession, in fact,

00:14:43.507 --> 00:14:46.840
Dolezal had suffered six broken ribs

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.130
while in the custody of the sheriff.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:52.010
Further casting doubt upon the confession.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.080
The confession appeared to be coached,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.730
as it was a mix of prepackaged details

00:14:56.730 --> 00:14:58.740
and incomprehensible ramblings.

00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:00.970
According to case expert James Badal,

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.157
the lead detective on the case
later said in his memoirs,

00:15:04.157 --> 00:15:06.870
"This is the first time
that I've ever known

00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:09.692
"anyone to confess to a crime
that didn't know the details

00:15:09.692 --> 00:15:11.820
"of the crime to which he was confessing."

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:15.200
- [Shane] They beat the
shit out of him probably.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.033
- [Ryan] A hundred percent.

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:16.866
- [Shane] Yes.

00:15:16.866 --> 00:15:17.850
- [Ryan] And it's very very sad.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:18.683
- [Shane] Yes.

00:15:18.683 --> 00:15:21.846
Him knowing numerous people
in the camp doesn't seem,

00:15:21.846 --> 00:15:25.920
I mean, he knew, so a lot
were a lot of these people

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.102
people who lived in that neighborhood,

00:15:28.102 --> 00:15:28.935
- [Ryan] Yes.

00:15:28.935 --> 00:15:29.930
- [Shane] Or in the shantytown kinda?

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:31.660
- [Ryan] I think what happened is,

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.290
they saw he lived with one of the victims.

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:34.123
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:15:34.123 --> 00:15:34.956
- Then they found out he knew

00:15:34.956 --> 00:15:36.920
the other two victims who were identified,

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.680
and they thought,
everyone's on us right now,

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.510
lotta pressure from the mayor,

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.330
the public is starting to get pissed off.

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.130
I think it's time to do the deed.

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:51.670
Nonetheless, Dolezal remained
incarcerated for the crime.

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.580
Which makes the event that
followed all the more suspicious.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:16:00.580
One month later, in August
1939, Dolezal committed suicide

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:03.860
in his jail cell before going to trial.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:06.590
Hanging himself on a hook that was

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.440
five feet and seven
inches from the ground.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.400
The problem with that is, Frank Dolezal,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.110
was five feet and eight inches tall.

00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:18.100
Logically, how could a
person hang themselves

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.250
from an object that they were taller than?

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.840
It seems like it may be
logistically impossible

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:25.224
for him to hang himself
from it, he'd have to...

00:16:25.224 --> 00:16:28.440
- [Shane] You can, I don't
know, I think that's possible.

00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:31.321
- It's suspicious to me, given
the things that preceded it.

00:16:31.321 --> 00:16:33.102
They coached his confession out of him,

00:16:33.102 --> 00:16:34.460
maybe they're starting...
- oh I see what you're saying,

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:36.240
you're saying the police maybe had,

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.670
oh that didn't occur to me
that the police would...

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:43.060
- What I'm saying is,
they seem very very set

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.210
on this particular guy.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.043
- Yeah.

00:16:45.043 --> 00:16:47.011
- They beaten him, they've
gotten a confession out of him,

00:16:47.011 --> 00:16:49.830
they start to think this is
going to go to trial soon.

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:51.930
- Oh, okay, I did not put that together.

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.500
- [Ryan] In addition
James Badal interviewed

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:58.220
forensic science experts that
looked at Dolezal's autopsy.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.720
The experts concluded that
he didn't end his own life

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.680
the way people were told he did.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.360
Though, the experts don't explicitly say

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.370
he was murdered while imprisoned.

00:17:08.370 --> 00:17:11.200
Either way, virtually no one believes

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.310
Frank Dolezal was the killer.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.500
A marker, purchased by
James Badal and his team,

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:19.840
was laid on Dolezal's
grave in August 2010,

00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.440
with Dolezal's family
members in attendance,

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:24.930
that reads "Rest Now"

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:29.070
Thus vindicating Dolezal posthumously.

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:31.030
In these Unsolved episodes it's not often

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.530
that we get nice sentiment.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.511
And this,

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.634
- [Shane] Let's hang on to this
one, let's really savor it.

00:17:35.634 --> 00:17:38.140
- [Ryan] This is, actually very lovely.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.140
- [Shane] Rest now, that's nice.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:39.973
- [Ryan] That's nice.

00:17:39.973 --> 00:17:42.750
The second and final suspect
we will discuss today,

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:45.850
is Dr Francis E Sweeney.

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:48.840
In the 1970's Sweeney was discovered to be

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:52.600
Safety Director Eliot
Ness's secret suspect.

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:55.250
Sweeney is also thought
to have been the killer,

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:57.740
according to case expert James Badal,

00:17:57.740 --> 00:18:02.740
who as of 2014, had spent 18
years researching the killings.

00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:06.290
Dr Francis E Sweeney fit the profile.

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:09.780
He was a doctor, and would've
had the necessary skill

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:13.070
and anatomical knowledge
to perform the killings.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:16.350
Sweeney had also been
probate court multiple times.

00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:19.350
And his wife noted his
problems with alcoholism.

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:21.300
His abuse of her and their two sons,

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.610
his days long disappearances,

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.530
and his neglect of his practice.

00:18:26.530 --> 00:18:28.460
Shortly after the final murder,

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:31.490
Sweeney checked himself
into a mental institution,

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.360
after which the killings stopped.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:38.600
In 1956, Sweeney was
diagnosed as schizophrenic.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:43.520
In May 1938, Eliot Ness
secretly apprehended Sweeney,

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.340
taking him to the old Cleveland Hotel.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:49.589
Ness kept Sweeney there
for about 10 to 14 days,

00:18:49.589 --> 00:18:53.368
as it took Sweeney three
days to even sober up.

00:18:53.368 --> 00:18:56.240
- Just Ness brewing coffee the whole time.

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.578
Slapping him in the face,

00:18:57.578 --> 00:18:59.630
- Mug of water in his face.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.180
- Tickling his feet with
some feathers, I don't know.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.577
- [Ryan] Miranda Rights
were not in place yet.

00:19:04.577 --> 00:19:07.144
Though, this process was still in conflict

00:19:07.144 --> 00:19:10.340
with the rules of civil
liberties of the time.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.620
The inventor of the modern
polygraph, Leonard Keeler,

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.420
administered a lie
detector test to Sweeney.

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.890
Which he failed, twice.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.410
Keeler told Ness,"That's your man.

00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:25.010
"I might as well throw
my machine out the window

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:26.840
"if I say anything different."

00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.980
- This makes me wonder if he in his mind

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:32.879
thought he was sort of a
vigilante justice type.

00:19:32.879 --> 00:19:35.860
You know, cause Bruce Wayne
was a very successful,

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:36.910
very powerful man.

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:38.880
- Are you comparing the
torso killer to Batman?

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.740
- I'm not.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.550
- It sounds like you're comparing
the torso killer to Batman

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:44.140
- I'm just saying I think
maybe the torso killer

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.180
thought that he,

00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.310
- Is Batman.

00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:47.143
- Was the Batman type.

00:19:47.143 --> 00:19:49.728
Except Batman never
cut anybody's head off,

00:19:49.728 --> 00:19:51.080
that would really ruin it.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.310
- Yeah Batman didn't kill people,

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:54.260
he just, knocked them out a little bit.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.710
He's not Batman.

00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:59.840
Ness had to proceed
carefully, because Sweeney,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.000
was a cousin of congressman
Martin L Sweeney.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.640
I wonder if this affiliation,
along with the detention,

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.760
violating civil liberties,
contributed to Ness

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.650
keeping the lie detector test a secret.

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:15.470
Regardless, despite this revelation,

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:17.494
Francis Sweeney was released,

00:20:17.494 --> 00:20:20.020
and less than three months later,

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.056
the final two torso victims were placed

00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:24.710
within view of Ness's window.

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:26.970
Seemingly to mock him.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:30.650
Ness would continue to get
mocked well after the killings.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.730
In the 50's Ness received
taunting note cards

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.210
from someone claiming
to be Francis Sweeney.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.155
And since Sweeney was a secret suspect,

00:20:38.155 --> 00:20:41.460
I would imagine it's
likely that the sender

00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.629
was indeed Sweeney.

00:20:42.629 --> 00:20:44.320
- [Shane] What do the note cards say?

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.070
- [Ryan] They pretty much say nonsense.

00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:48.702
- [Shane] Do they implicate
that he is the killer

00:20:48.702 --> 00:20:50.880
or is it him essentially just...

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:52.240
- [Ryan] It's him
thumbing his nose at him,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.190
knowing that even if these note cards

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:55.280
were taken to court,

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:57.114
- [Shane] they wouldn't mean anything.

00:20:57.114 --> 00:20:59.072
- [Ryan] They wouldn't mean anything,

00:20:59.072 --> 00:21:00.530
which is, even more infuriating.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:01.363
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:21:01.363 --> 00:21:03.123
- [Ryan] Unfortunately,
despite feeling he had solved

00:21:03.123 --> 00:21:06.030
the case, Ness didn't have
enough to take Sweeney to trial.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:09.560
Though, the case against
Sweeney doesn't end there.

00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:13.786
In 1938, a vagrant named
Emile Fronek told authorities

00:21:13.786 --> 00:21:17.660
that in 1934, a doctor tried to drug him.

00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:20.320
He remembered the office
was somewhere around

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.250
East 50th and East 55th
on Broadway Street.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.690
Unfortunately when authorities
drove Fronek up Broadway,

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.740
he couldn't find anything
that appeared to be

00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.060
a medical office, and from there,

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.750
his story was dismissed as irrelevant.

00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:37.357
However, more than 70 years later,

00:21:37.357 --> 00:21:41.730
case expert James Badal,
discovered that Francis Sweeney

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:44.720
practiced medicine out of
a modest looking building,

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.692
at the corner of Broadway
and Purshing Avenue.

00:21:47.692 --> 00:21:51.140
This building closely matches where Fronek

00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:52.816
remembered getting drugged.

00:21:52.816 --> 00:21:56.032
It's in this building that
Badal believed Sweeney

00:21:56.032 --> 00:21:59.516
could've drugged Fronek
as well as other victims.

00:21:59.516 --> 00:22:03.240
Though, the torso killer
murders would've resulted

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.422
in a large amount of blood evidence.

00:22:05.422 --> 00:22:08.910
So, how could Sweeney have
carried out those murders

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:12.206
in these offices, without
eventually being caught?

00:22:12.206 --> 00:22:15.870
- Spread out tarps, and just whoosh.

00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:19.140
- Cause I imagine it would be
pretty hard to explain this.

00:22:20.191 --> 00:22:21.740
I know this looks bad.

00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:22.981
- He's got a head cold.

00:22:22.981 --> 00:22:23.860
(laughs)

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.270
- [Ryan] The answer may
lie with David Cowles,

00:22:26.270 --> 00:22:28.820
the leader of the Scientific
Identification Bureau,

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:30.450
who was interviewed by the Cleveland

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.520
Police Historical Society in 1983.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.660
Cowles suggests that Sweeney may have had

00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:37.470
an agreement with an undertaker.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:40.610
That he could practice surgery
on the unclaimed bodies

00:22:40.610 --> 00:22:42.750
in the undertakers funeral home.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.350
If this is true, a funeral
home would function nicely

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:49.150
as a way to dispose of blood evidence.

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.580
This arrangement, however,
does seem to be possible,

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.868
as directly next door to Sweeney's office

00:22:54.868 --> 00:22:58.311
was a funeral home, in
fact, the funeral home

00:22:58.311 --> 00:23:01.970
had a concrete ramp located
behind the building,

00:23:01.970 --> 00:23:05.150
that conveniently led to
the undertaking facilities.

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:08.120
Both Sweeney's medical
office, and the funeral home

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.750
are a short car ride away
from where the September 1935

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:15.780
victims were found, which was
not far from the Roaring Third

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.800
In Badal's opinion, Sweeney
could've visited bars

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.070
near the center of town,
to lure people back

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:25.070
to his office with promises
of alcohol or drugs.

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.950
- He just made an agreement with them say,

00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.110
yeah you can work on our dead bodies,

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:30.710
but then he'd bring in some of his own.

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:31.650
- I think that's what it was.

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:32.483
- I see okay.

00:23:32.483 --> 00:23:35.820
- He snuck in some, you
know, some of his own in.

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.340
- Some of his own sinful collections.

00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.030
- He was getting some of
his own critics picks.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:40.863
- Yeah.

00:23:40.863 --> 00:23:41.850
- [Ryan] Badal, with the help of the

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.640
great nephew of one of
Francis Sweeney's colleagues,

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.830
was able to use photos and diagrams

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:50.208
to compare the torso killer
and Sweeney's movements.

00:23:50.208 --> 00:23:54.160
Badal calls the results, "Creepy as hell."

00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.090
All this information
allowed Badal to conclude

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.541
that Sweeney was indeed the killer,

00:24:00.541 --> 00:24:02.621
though Badal cautions,

00:24:02.621 --> 00:24:06.980
"I think I put together a
pretty good circumstantial case,

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:08.838
"I realize you couldn't take it to court,

00:24:08.838 --> 00:24:12.510
"and Ness realized back then,
he couldn't take it to court."

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.690
- [Shane] It's crazy that all he had to do

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.270
was follow the rules and
it's quite likely he may have

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:20.860
gathered some legitimate
evidence on the guy,

00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.693
or at least...

00:24:21.693 --> 00:24:24.570
- [Ryan] The thing is, all he had was,

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:25.830
Sweeney fit the profile, right.

00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:26.910
- [Shane] Yes.

00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:29.410
- [Ryan] But that isn't grounds
to getting a search warrant

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:30.930
for someone or bringing someone in.

00:24:30.930 --> 00:24:31.763
- [Shane] No.

00:24:31.763 --> 00:24:32.850
- I don't know what the rules are,

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:35.240
of maybe when you're allowed
to arrest somebody, or

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.473
even submit them to something
like a lie detector test,

00:24:37.473 --> 00:24:38.306
- Yeah.

00:24:38.306 --> 00:24:39.730
- I imagine it wasn't enough for

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.110
him to do it when he did it.

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:42.271
- Yeah.

00:24:42.271 --> 00:24:43.104
- Or ever.

00:24:43.104 --> 00:24:44.520
Sweeney would have to slip, publicly.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:48.058
There are however some criticisms
of the Sweeney explanation

00:24:48.058 --> 00:24:50.910
police and crime reporter Doris O'Donnell,

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.210
believes that somebody at the funeral home

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.750
would have noticed something
weird was going on.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.590
Yet, O'Donnell may be
biased, since her uncle

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:02.480
was the sheriff who arrested
the controversial suspect,

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:05.290
Frank Dolezal in 1939.

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.910
I think it's like one of those things

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.190
where you wouldn't even dare to dream

00:25:08.190 --> 00:25:10.170
that someone would use this
as a place to kill people.

00:25:10.170 --> 00:25:11.003
- [Shane] Right.

00:25:11.003 --> 00:25:12.340
- [Ryan] Cause you're
around death all the time,

00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:14.340
all you see is dead bodies,
what makes you think

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:15.760
they're gonna be like
oh, I wonder if someone's

00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.676
using this to uh kill people.

00:25:17.676 --> 00:25:22.050
Also even Badal acknowledges
that the medical office setup

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:25.050
could have only been utilized
for the initial murders,

00:25:25.050 --> 00:25:27.780
before colleagues could become suspicious.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.820
He doesn't know where the
murders that followed occurred.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.550
Others including lead
Detective, Peter Merylo,

00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:36.490
believe the torso murders were
committed by the same person

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:39.400
that committed murders in
New Castle, Pennsylvania.

00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.217
Detective Merylo felt that
Sweeney was too overweight

00:25:42.217 --> 00:25:44.540
to make the rail trip back and forth

00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:47.060
between New Castle and Cleveland.

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.670
Which consequently led
to Merylo's discounting

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.690
of Sweeney as a suspect.

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:55.800
But, to be fair, Merylo had
also been kept in the dark

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.062
about Sweeney's secret
interrogation and lie detector test.

00:25:59.062 --> 00:26:03.560
I for one, will go on record
by saying, I do think it's him.

00:26:04.501 --> 00:26:06.863
- I will also go out on that limb.

00:26:06.863 --> 00:26:08.610
Great work Ryan!

00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:09.710
- That's the best I could give.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:12.450
- Yeah, so well, I guess I
shouldn't say great work Ryan,

00:26:12.450 --> 00:26:13.500
cause you didn't solve...

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.210
- I didn't do anything, James Badal did.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:16.070
- Yeah.

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.580
- [Ryan] Regardless,
Francis Sweeney remains,

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.730
for the most part, the
most popular suspect.

00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.480
In the case of Eliot Ness and James Badal,

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.830
they believe that he
is not just a suspect,

00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:28.698
but in fact the killer.

00:26:28.698 --> 00:26:33.698
However, we may never be able
to definitively prove that.

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:38.320
And for now, the case
remains officially unsolved.
