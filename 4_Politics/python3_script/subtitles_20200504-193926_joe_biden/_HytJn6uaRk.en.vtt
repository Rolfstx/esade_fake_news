00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Islam Mamdouh Auditor: Riyad Almubarak 

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:14.005
 Well, I am four years old. 

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.050
 In the early sixties of the twentieth century 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.380
 And I look at the globe 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.780
 And I can see clearly 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.532
 Africa and South America are proportional. 

00:00:23.532 --> 00:00:26.299
 As if they were a two-piece puzzle game, 

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:28.099
 Or a broken cake 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.509
 Obviously, they were close 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.169
 one day 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:34.584
 Of course I was not the first to notice it. 

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:36.451
 Map makers and others 

00:00:36.451 --> 00:00:38.499
 They still notice him for hundreds of years. 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.519
 But if you had made my observations 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:44.750
 On the table of geologists in the early sixties of the twentieth century 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.910
 They would tell me it was just a coincidence. 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.257
 Where it was scientifically impossible at the time 

00:00:50.257 --> 00:00:54.030
 That something physical the size of a continent 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.650
 He can move on the ground 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.554
 This was crazy at the time 

00:00:59.554 --> 00:01:03.081
 But if we jumped to the end of the sixties 

00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:06.711
 Hardworking scientists on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean 

00:01:06.711 --> 00:01:08.890
 And researchers in the depths of the trench in the middle 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.370
 They found evidence 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.590
 And they developed their understanding 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.660
 On the possibility of moving the material of the continent lighter 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.090
 On the heavier material beneath it, 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.850
 The science of rock formation 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.320
 It is currently the key to our understanding of our world. 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.060
 So this shows how science is changing 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.539
 Sometimes during a person's childhood 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.596
 And another, over decades and years, slowly and remarkably. 

00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:38.740
 And now by jumping to about ten years past 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.361
 Then I had the internet 

00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:44.060
 Where I can answer any urgent question on me with a quick search 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.789
 I look at a website with scientific content. 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.279
 But it is on the sidelines of science. 

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:56.170
 It raises doubts about some common sciences 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.136
 Now, I will not tell you now what exactly the site is; 

00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:01.339
 Because it is in the area between science and superstition 

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:03.198
 Where respected scholars do not go. 

00:02:03.198 --> 00:02:05.330
 But we will discuss that later. 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.150
 Trust me. 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.541
 But the question that this site posed to my mind was: 

00:02:12.541 --> 00:02:16.480
 Can the earth rotate? 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.517
 So that a circular ground pass arises 

00:02:20.517 --> 00:02:21.815
 On the floor below? 

00:02:21.815 --> 00:02:25.049
 Meaning: If I took a rubber band and surrounded the ground, 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.901
 Can my satellite rotate and remain the whole time above the strip? 

00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:33.770
 This is not an easy thing to explain. 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.060
 But I'm searching on the Internet, 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.760
 I can not find any answer. 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.940
 And I go to my friend who is a genius missile scientist, 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.610
 And I ask him, 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.273
 He thinks for a moment and says: 

00:02:43.273 --> 00:02:45.410
 "Sure! It revolves around the equator!" 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.510
 Yes, this is a correct answer. 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.881
 If I walk on the equator while the Earth rotates. 

00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:51.848
 It doesn't matter how fast anyone goes 

00:02:51.848 --> 00:02:53.529
 I will remain just above the equator. 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:56.194
 But I want to put my rubber band on different angles 

00:02:56.194 --> 00:02:57.860
 I need to do that. 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.781
 And here he can not answer me, 

00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:02.010
 I can not find a clear answer on the Internet. 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.350
 How amazing is this? 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.080
 Well, I will give you an example 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.940
 It will help you understand why it is a difficult problem 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.200
 We all know that - we are the inhabitants of the space age - 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.760
 The International Space Station "NASA Mission Control" 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.000
 We walk a path over and over again 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.192
 As if we surrounded a ball with a thread. 

00:03:23.192 --> 00:03:25.429
 The International Space Station orbits the Earth every 90 minutes, 

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:26.950
 The Earth revolves around itself every 24 hours 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.070
 This pattern is formed 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.870
 OK 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.202
 What do I have to learn to find out? 

00:03:37.202 --> 00:03:39.280
 Well, we have to go a little deeper 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.187
 No mathematics; I promise you. 

00:03:41.187 --> 00:03:44.730
 But there are three key information you need to know about Earth orbits 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.390
 That will tell you about the ground lane you make below 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.990
 The first thing is your height 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.452
 ISS (International Space Station) orbits approximately 400 km above Earth. 

00:03:55.452 --> 00:03:57.880
 For anthropomorphic, this is like a quarter of an inch. 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.250
 7 millimeters above the holographic. 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.168
 The second thing is the inclination of the orbit on the equator. 

00:04:01.168 --> 00:04:04.538
 The International Space Station is tilted 51 degrees, 

00:04:04.538 --> 00:04:06.930
 This means that it covers most of the Earth's surface 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.814
 The more it revolves around it 

00:04:09.814 --> 00:04:13.120
 The third thing: is the shape of the percept. 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.870
 Now, the shape can consist of any round shape 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.126
 Like the ISS (International Space Station). 

00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:20.012
 To a very sharp ellipse 

00:04:20.012 --> 00:04:21.206
 Long and tight 

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:24.339
 But the important information about the ellipse is that the center of the Earth 

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:27.890
 It has to be at one of the ellipse's foci 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.869
 And here is where mathematics becomes deceptive, okay? 

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:32.396
 Thanks to Johannes Kepler in the early seventeenth century. 

00:04:32.396 --> 00:04:37.150
 We can precisely calculate your speed and position on that ellipse 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.520
 For any given shape. 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.290
 OK. Now we have known all of it. 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.563
 Height, inclination, ellipse shape and speed 

00:04:44.563 --> 00:04:45.493
 My mind is spinning 

00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:48.221
 How can I find an answer? 

00:04:48.221 --> 00:04:49.880
 And if there is no answer 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.690
 How will I prove it to myself too 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.059
 To accept the idea that my question is fruitless. 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.949
 OK 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.620
 So I called a friend of mine 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.780
 He is a genius astronaut and mathematician. 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.510
 He points to 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.921
 There are a limited number of types of orbits around Earth 

00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:08.610
 So I start to see these types. 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.843
 Two of them surprised me 

00:05:10.843 --> 00:05:12.506
 Because of their great importance 

00:05:12.506 --> 00:05:17.360
 The first of them is the fixed orbit, right? 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.280
 Fixed orbit: It is a circular orbit, 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.753
 And his inclination that appears here 

00:05:22.753 --> 00:05:26.209
 Very far from the ground. 

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:29.941
 The most important thing is that its height makes it to orbit the Earth. 

00:05:29.941 --> 00:05:32.420
 At the same time as the Earthâ€™s rotation. 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.192
 This means that you will be all the time above the same area on Earth 

00:05:35.192 --> 00:05:37.260
 This makes it easy 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.680
 On a satellite TV broadcast 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.160
 So that it comes to your home and indicates it in a whiff in the sky 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:44.702
 Because the satellite is always there. 

00:05:44.702 --> 00:05:47.292
 Even at night when the moon and stars move regularly 

00:05:47.292 --> 00:05:49.290
 The satellite is right there 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.070
 But now the strange thing is 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:53.690
 The satellite has a ground pass and is not a rubber belt at all. 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.110
 It is one point. 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.902
 So in a way, this is the opposite of what I'm looking for; True? 

00:05:58.902 --> 00:06:02.670
 The second orbit, which looked very interesting, is called "Molina". 

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.108
 Molania is a Russian word meaning lightning. 

00:06:05.108 --> 00:06:08.388
 The Soviet Union launched it in the early space age. 

00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:10.217
 The orbit of Moulinia is heavily inclined 

00:06:10.217 --> 00:06:12.250
 And very elongated 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.151
 And temporary 

00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:16.367
 So it spins around the Earth completely in half a day. 

00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:18.837
 This is what gives it a wonderful U shape. 

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:19.990
 U-shape 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.390
 That revolves around the Earth. 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.160
 The Molina satellite is roaming high above one side of the world 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.430
 To move North America 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.640
 He may take pictures or listen to the radio. 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.110
 Then he spins around the earth 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:30.185
 And back out, 

00:06:30.185 --> 00:06:32.100
 It spins again 

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.351
 But half a day has passed 

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.480
 So it is now above the other side of the planet, 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:39.040
 He can carry what he has learned on the other side. 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:41.519
 So these two orbits inspired me. 

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:43.269
 What if you are in orbit 

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:46.470
 It took exactly two days to orbit the Earth 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.315
 Clear? So I will start from a random point above the ground. 

00:06:50.315 --> 00:06:54.113
 A day later I will be on the other side. 

00:06:54.113 --> 00:06:57.000
 And after a day, the Earth will have completed a full cycle 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.140
 So I would also be on a side of the ground opposite the side from which I started 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.480
 After another day, I will return to where I started to orbit. 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.188
 The earth would have revolved again; Here I am back above the same point 

00:07:06.188 --> 00:07:07.598
 This sounds promising, doesn't it? 

00:07:07.598 --> 00:07:09.348
 He dominated this research. 

00:07:09.348 --> 00:07:13.200
 I'm on the phone with my friend the astronomer and mathematician, 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.803
 As if to say something like: 

00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:16.930
 "Well, a crazy question. Good luck with his answer!" 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.034
 "I will tell you something, there is a great website called 'STK' 

00:07:21.034 --> 00:07:22.930
 You have to check it out 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.025
 Because it will show you any orbit you want. 

00:07:25.025 --> 00:07:29.058
 Well .. I go to STK and do my basic calculations. 

00:07:29.058 --> 00:07:31.505
 I put my numbers and press the button 

00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:32.960
 And here he is before my eyes. 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.270
 Single lane ... Earth circular orbit. 

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.510
 It fascinated me that he was already there. 

00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:40.950
 Now I am thinking: 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.070
 "It is impossible for me to be the first to notice this. 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.020
 I am not a rocket scientist. " 

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.490
 So I call another friend 

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:51.395
 He works as a designer for Earth orbits in large space companies 

00:07:51.395 --> 00:07:53.528
 He seems a little skeptical, 

00:07:53.528 --> 00:07:56.180
 But it runs its own STK version. 

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.600
 He calls my numbers and enters them. 

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:01.230
 A hoop! He finds the same results! 

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:04.320
 And he says, "You know? I've never seen that before." 

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.897
 You should write that. 

00:08:05.897 --> 00:08:07.440
 Share it in a space magazine. 

00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.454
 well, that is good. 

00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:11.262
 Well, then it's a new thing. True? 

00:08:11.262 --> 00:08:13.122
 And new things must be called 

00:08:13.122 --> 00:08:14.808
 So I think about the most important characteristic of it 

00:08:14.808 --> 00:08:16.130
 It is over two days. 

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.210
 So I would call it "two-day course" 

00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.355
 Or "2do" as a shortcut. 

00:08:19.355 --> 00:08:21.656
 To match the rest of the three-letter abbreviations 

00:08:21.656 --> 00:08:23.386
 That space scientists love to use. 

00:08:23.386 --> 00:08:24.142
 (Laughter) 

00:08:24.142 --> 00:08:28.780
 Now that I've got a name for it, I want to go back to my original question. 

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.830
 But for a mind like my mind, or maybe your kindness, 

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:34.130
 Thinking: "What about the three-day course?" 

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.860
 Or throughout the four days? What will the ground lanes look like? 

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:39.290
 Yes, they all exist. It's exciting that I had to research. 

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:41.930
 So I go back to my original research. 

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:44.840
 I tilt the orbit slightly 

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.350
 31 degrees above a certain point on the Earth's surface. 

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.897
 I find that it has a set of interesting and distinctive characteristics. 

00:08:52.897 --> 00:08:56.219
 1- The orbit remains outside of Van Allen's belts. 

00:08:56.219 --> 00:09:00.178
 The radiation belts outside here around the Earth. 

00:09:00.178 --> 00:09:02.445
 If you are an astronaut, You do not want to roam there. 

00:09:02.445 --> 00:09:04.866
 You can fly through it 

00:09:04.866 --> 00:09:07.500
 If you were an electronics scientist, You wouldn't want to be there either 

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.149
 But this orbit is far from all that. 

00:09:10.149 --> 00:09:11.480
 The second feature: 

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:14.480
 It is also far from Earth's magnetic field. 

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.439
 So the magnetic field is inside you. 

00:09:17.439 --> 00:09:19.399
 Third property: 

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:20.859
 It is always in the sun! 

00:09:20.859 --> 00:09:24.930
 It is an orbit that never cuts the Earthâ€™s shadow, but orbits away from it. 

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:27.320
 Even during the northern sunset 

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.409
 The maximum inclination of the northern part of the globe. 

00:09:31.409 --> 00:09:33.440
 So what do we do with an orbit like this? 

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.179
 Well since we are always in the sun. 

00:09:35.179 --> 00:09:37.230
 How about creating a very powerful satellite. 

00:09:37.230 --> 00:09:39.359
 Where we can collect solar energy. 

00:09:39.359 --> 00:09:43.190
 And we broadcast it to a group of locations on the ground to provide them with energy. 

00:09:43.190 --> 00:09:45.910
 We charge them every two days while we repeat the cycle. 

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:48.629
 Or maybe we put a whole bunch of mirrors dancing around. 

00:09:48.629 --> 00:09:50.100
 We can then light it up 

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.358
 Dark places need more lighting. 

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:54.589
 And there may be other uses. 

00:09:54.589 --> 00:09:55.424
 OK 

00:09:55.424 --> 00:09:58.730
 But what about that site from which it all began? 

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:00.130
 That shallow site 

00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:02.591
 Who does not risk visiting esteemed scholars? 

00:10:02.591 --> 00:10:05.207
 Well, it was like this: 

00:10:05.207 --> 00:10:06.970
 Note a researcher named Jim Allison 

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.959
 That a large number of archaeological sites in the world 

00:10:10.959 --> 00:10:14.279
 Some of the oldest and most obscure installations 

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:17.230
 All line up on one circle around the Earth. 

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:20.410
 On a straight line. 

00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:22.730
 When you place a two-day orbit just above this line 

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.660
 It will not be completely round, 

00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:27.609
 It's a bit like a potato chip 

00:10:27.609 --> 00:10:29.890
 But it is also close to the shape of the line. 

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:32.120
 Let's travel on a two-day satellite 

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.275
 We tour all those archeological sites. 

00:10:34.275 --> 00:10:37.049
 We start from the most famous stone site 

00:10:37.049 --> 00:10:38.390
 The Great Pyramids 

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:44.161
 With its mysterious rooms and secret tunnels, and of course the Sphinx 

00:10:44.161 --> 00:10:47.200
 Soon after, we pass over the Sahara 

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.310
 We cross over the Atlantic Ocean, 

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:51.240
 We cross over the Amazon basin, 

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.796
 And we reach for Machu Picchu 

00:10:52.796 --> 00:10:56.380
 With its mysterious stone structures and the city of Ollantaytambo 

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.670
 And all other archaeological sites around Cuzco 

00:10:59.670 --> 00:11:02.649
 Then we fly over the Nazca Lines 

00:11:02.649 --> 00:11:05.689
 With her mysterious drawings engraved on the land of the desert 

00:11:05.689 --> 00:11:07.669
 Of course we are at an altitude of 60,000 km, 

00:11:07.669 --> 00:11:09.389
 So if we want to see these shapes 

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:12.649
 We must have a good telescope. 

00:11:12.649 --> 00:11:14.809
 We move forward across the Pacific Ocean 

00:11:14.809 --> 00:11:18.119
 With a distance of 4000 km from its inception we will be over the island of Easter 

00:11:18.119 --> 00:11:20.719
 With her huge heads and Moai statues. 

00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:24.371
 In fact, they are whole statues buried on the ground 

00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:26.259
 We continue to fly over the Pacific Ocean. 

00:11:26.259 --> 00:11:28.110
 So we go back to the equator. 

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.209
 We fly over Cambodia 

00:11:30.209 --> 00:11:34.470
 And Priya Vaihere temples and Angkor Wat monuments. 

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:39.459
 We continue to fly over Asia from India to Pakistan 

00:11:39.459 --> 00:11:41.269
 To Mohenjo Daro - the hill of the dead. 

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:44.400
 One of the oldest places of Western civilization, 

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.513
 With texts that have not been deciphered yet. 

00:11:46.513 --> 00:11:48.927
 Because it is old and very far from us. 

00:11:48.927 --> 00:11:51.097
 We continue to fly over the Middle East, 

00:11:51.097 --> 00:11:56.349
 And the city of Persepolis Percy and the huge buildings in Ur - Iraq - 

00:11:56.349 --> 00:11:59.051
 Then we continue to fly over the city of Petra. 

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:03.110
 With its impressive stone structures carved into the walls. 

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.849
 Then we return to the Great Pyramids. 

00:12:05.849 --> 00:12:09.329
 From where we started. 

00:12:09.329 --> 00:12:12.259
 So it is clear that not all archaeological sites are on the circle. 

00:12:12.259 --> 00:12:13.879
 Stonehenge, the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, 

00:12:13.879 --> 00:12:17.346
 And all kinds of sites in China, Africa and Asia 

00:12:17.346 --> 00:12:18.849
 And Central America 

00:12:18.849 --> 00:12:21.394
 But the sites are on the circuit 

00:12:21.394 --> 00:12:23.760
 It shares many things. 

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:24.770
 First: 

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:28.629
 It has some of the largest human-made stone work. 

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:33.799
 The huge molds that we cannot logically move today. 

00:12:33.799 --> 00:12:35.249
 Second: 

00:12:35.249 --> 00:12:38.964
 The shape of the stone work is finely cut. 

00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:44.370
 They fit together, so there is no room between them for a hair. 

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.489
 Then look at the Easter Island in the Pacific Ocean. 

00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:48.910
 Large Moai statues attract attention 

00:12:48.910 --> 00:12:50.119
 There are hundreds of them. 

00:12:50.119 --> 00:12:51.939
 But there are also walls, 

00:12:51.939 --> 00:12:53.840
 Walls appear to be one of the oldest structures 

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.233
 Man-made on the island of the Resurrection. 

00:12:56.233 --> 00:12:59.759
 The walls were built of basalt - a very hard stone - 

00:12:59.899 --> 00:13:02.409
 The structural shape of the walls is similar in Machu Picchu. 

00:13:02.519 --> 00:13:05.691
 4,000 km into the Pacific Ocean, 

00:13:05.781 --> 00:13:08.179
 It is also built of basalt. 

00:13:08.799 --> 00:13:12.789
 Then there are those prominent knobs and mysterious holes 

00:13:13.019 --> 00:13:15.849
 Many of them are in the pyramids and other Egyptian sites. 

00:13:16.029 --> 00:13:18.130
 Many of them are found throughout South America. 

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.703
 Why did you make these handles? How was it made? 

00:13:19.703 --> 00:13:21.669
 And why did they put that effort into it? 

00:13:21.669 --> 00:13:22.950
 we do not know 

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.510
 The holes look like mashed potatoes 

00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:28.890
 One of them came with two rulers and punctured him 

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:30.013
 we do not know 

00:13:31.113 --> 00:13:34.700
 There are delicate stone works 

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:36.140
 These are completely smooth surfaces! 

00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:38.630
 As if it took a mechanic's workshop 

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.240
 It was polished with diamonds. 

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:42.640
 We cannot know how this was done 

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.915
 With bronze or iron equipment. 

00:13:46.695 --> 00:13:49.348
 Well, you want to know what's the weirdest? 

00:13:49.348 --> 00:13:54.230
 There are cultures around the world that mention "flying man" and fishman " 

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.380
 Such as Asia and South America. 

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:02.000
 And they have something else: a handbag 

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.480
 Bag of the Gods 

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.420
 (Laughter) 

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:08.690
 Why? How do? Throughout the world. 

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.320
 The bag of deities was also found in India and Indonesia. 

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.661
 And recently in GÃ¶bkli Tiba in Turkey, 

00:14:15.661 --> 00:14:18.871
 Which has been buried for at least 10,000 years 

00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:21.962
 This means that the handbag was present at least at this time 

00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:24.967
 It is not something that humans invented recently. 

00:14:24.967 --> 00:14:30.360
 I am not here to prove the presence of old astronauts or aliens 

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.680
 To me this does not answer anything. 

00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:36.310
 But it only hides it behind myths. 

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.730
 But I want to know the truth 

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:39.080
 Where did all this come from? 

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:41.175
 Who created it? 

00:14:41.175 --> 00:14:42.930
 I do not want any distant answers 

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.790
 Of the ancients who did all of that. 

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:46.200
 But I want to know more about them. 

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.490
 I want to know how they made it and when they made it? 

00:14:48.490 --> 00:14:50.620
 And I want to confess to them brilliantly 

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.210
 So what do we do? 

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.336
 Well, we come out with our science toolkit 

00:14:55.530 --> 00:14:57.410
 First thing: What is our theory? 

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.780
 Scientists who looked at it 

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:08.150
 Ask our traditional story about ancient human history. 

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:11.880
 Where you start from a long era of hunters 

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.480
 To stability and dependence on agriculture, 

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.450
 And most recently, living in independent cities 

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.704
 Scientists thought 

00:15:18.704 --> 00:15:21.494
 - There is strong evidence for this - 

00:15:21.494 --> 00:15:26.047
 That, 13,000 years ago, there was a more sophisticated human civilization 

00:15:26.047 --> 00:15:28.380
 It is difficult for us to know how it developed 

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.873
 But we know that they were able to build with stones what we cannot now. 

00:15:31.873 --> 00:15:33.870
 Then what happened? 

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.180
 Suddenly a disaster occurred 

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.188
 A terrible thing happened 

00:15:38.188 --> 00:15:41.689
 The ocean rose, the heat decreased, and the inhabitants wiped out. 

00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:43.229
 The cities deserted 

00:15:43.499 --> 00:15:44.923
 And over time 

00:15:44.923 --> 00:15:46.498
 Civil recovered 

00:15:46.498 --> 00:15:48.629
 And we entered into a style similar to the era of fishermen 

00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:52.167
 Then we entered the pattern of agriculture and independent cities. 

00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:53.979
 So it's a story. True? 

00:15:53.979 --> 00:15:55.999
 Is it a good story? Maybe yes and maybe no. 

00:15:55.999 --> 00:15:58.380
 But what does science tell us? 

00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.480
 Well, first: 

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:04.589
 We have information that ocean surfaces were less than 100 meters 15,000 years ago 

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:06.900
 100 meters means 330 feet 

00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.528
 This means that the coasts and ancient islands 

00:16:09.528 --> 00:16:12.318
 It is now completely submerged. 

00:16:12.318 --> 00:16:17.240
 Second: Greenland ice block samples and the mid-Atlantic sediments 

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.599
 Reveal a sudden drop in temperature 

00:16:20.599 --> 00:16:22.605
 It lasted about a thousand years 

00:16:22.605 --> 00:16:24.059
 around the world 

00:16:24.059 --> 00:16:28.389
 Third: Male DNA analysis included evidence 

00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:33.719
 On a sudden decline in male DNA types around the world 

00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:37.160
 I repeat about 13,000 years ago. 

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.114
 He was not here or there, but was in the whole world. 

00:16:40.114 --> 00:16:43.220
 Many men have not inherited their DNA for the following generations. 

00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.510
 Say that 

00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.339
 Then we started to recover again 

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:51.919
 So, what happened and all this happened? 

00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:54.709
 We have evidence that something hit North America 

00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:56.479
 - guilty or a meteorite - 

00:16:56.479 --> 00:17:00.269
 And leaving distinct molecules during the hemisphere 

00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:02.019
 The cause of burning a lot of things 

00:17:02.019 --> 00:17:04.009
 Where it was noticeable the presence of soot and ash particles 

00:17:04.009 --> 00:17:06.579
 She is there too. 

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:08.859
 We have seen half a million impact nozzles. 

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:12.830
 Starting from New Jersey to Alabama 

00:17:12.830 --> 00:17:17.059
 As if an impulsive cosmic shot hit our planet 

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:19.709
 So we have a lot of hard work ahead 

00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:21.960
 We need more 

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.159
 We need more information and more evidence 

00:17:24.159 --> 00:17:27.749
 We need to think of science fictional ideas 

00:17:27.749 --> 00:17:30.190
 And set it to become a scientific fact 

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:34.610
 We need to remember what we did when we invented the plane 

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:36.619
 We are now flying better than any bird. 

00:17:36.619 --> 00:17:37.460
 Or the submarine 

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.400
 We can dive better than any fish. 

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:45.490
 Or now, the missiles that fly in space and return to land 

00:17:45.490 --> 00:17:46.710
 It is reused. 

00:17:46.710 --> 00:17:50.040
 Which no animal can do! 

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:51.450
 Check out this map. 

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:54.960
 Pale blue shows the rocks of the continent 

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:59.260
 Most of that area was land 15,000 years ago. 

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.660
 What could be there? 

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.900
 We need to make some drones 

00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.130
 Enjoy some technology 

00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:08.190
 Which we will send to dive under the ocean 

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:12.140
 In search of archaeological sites, roads, and monuments deep in the sea. 

00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:15.540
 Which we ignored for thousands of years. 

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.224
 Or what about those big rocks 

00:18:17.224 --> 00:18:20.870
 Which has been lying side by side for an unknown time 

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:23.200
 Is there a technology that we can develop? 

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:24.690
 Can we tell her age over there? 

00:18:24.690 --> 00:18:27.290
 Are you penetrated by cosmic rays? 

00:18:27.290 --> 00:18:29.516
 To create tags that we can read 

00:18:29.516 --> 00:18:34.580
 And her account to tell us exactly about her age? 

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:35.630
 What about surfaces? 

00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:39.415
 When we create a surface on a stone, what changes? 

00:18:39.415 --> 00:18:42.990
 Does a stone pierce something in the air? 

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:45.366
 Will something come out of the stone over time? 

00:18:45.366 --> 00:18:47.230
 A specific percentage that we can calculate 

00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:51.040
 And discover the timing of all these wonderful artifacts 

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.280
 Or a group of large stones in Egypt. 

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:55.860
 A million stones piled up 

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:58.200
 What influence the ground beneath them? 

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.390
 Do they prevent anything from the sun? 

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:03.379
 Can we compare the buried part of the pyramids? 

00:19:03.379 --> 00:19:05.770
 And between the part that is still visible all this time. 

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:10.270
 Because the Egyptian murals do not tell us when the pyramids were built 

00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:12.360
 We have to find out for ourselves! 

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:15.470
 Sometimes I feel like I'm still that four-year-old. 

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.900
 Look at the ground. 

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.153
 Trying to figure out how their parts fit together. 

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:25.380
 One of my heroes: Carl Siegen 

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:31.310
 It reminds us that supernatural allegations require supernatural evidence. 

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.296
 And I'd love to add to that 

00:19:33.296 --> 00:19:36.550
 Supernatural evidence requires supernatural research. 

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:38.330
 and I'm sure 

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.583
 If we use our knowledge and unique human mental potential 

00:19:41.583 --> 00:19:42.940
 And we worked hard 

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.580
 We spent the money to get answers 

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.045
 We will know a lot about what we are 

00:19:48.045 --> 00:19:49.458
 Where did we come from. 

00:19:49.458 --> 00:19:52.178
 And where can we go? 

00:19:52.178 --> 00:19:54.420
 And I think we can build the best possible future 

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:57.970
 If we know what happened in our past. 

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.400
 So let's do it! 

00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:00.975
 Thank you. 

00:20:00.975 --> 00:20:02.021
 (clap)
