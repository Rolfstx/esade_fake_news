00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.750
JUDY WOODRUFF: As officials around the country
are considering how to reopen their communities,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.540
there's great concern and debate brewing over
how long shutdowns should last and whether

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.790
reopening too soon could be dangerous.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.220
Donald McNeil reported extensively on these
questions for The New York Times in a piece

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.800
that explored how society could be profoundly
affected and disrupted for the next two years.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.820
He's been covering epidemics for close to
two decades for The Times, and he joins me

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.820
now.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.170
Donald McNeil, thank you so much for joining
us.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.929
You do open your piece quoting scientists
as saying, this could last for sometime.

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:41.339
Why? What do they base that on?

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.800
DONALD MCNEIL JR., The New York Times: Well,
you know, basically, they say that the notion

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.890
that we're all going to be out of this in
two or three months, and that football stadiums

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.480
are going to be open in the fall and we will
be all out together, is a fantasy, that, right

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.819
now, somewhere north of 300 million Americans
are still uninfected and vulnerable to the

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:01.890
virus.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.190
If we all go out again, things will look good
for two or three weeks, and then suddenly

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.820
the infections will begin to tick up, and
then the emergency rooms will fill, and we

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.790
will be back on our way towards two million
dead, which we were when the lockdown started.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.990
So that can't happen. And we won't really
get out of this until we have either a vaccine

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.730
or a prophylactic pill that will let us out.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:26.620
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the vaccine.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.940
We are told, what is it, Dr. Fauci says a
year, a year-and-a-half. What do the scientists

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.650
you talk to say about that, why it takes so
long?

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.100
DONALD MCNEIL JR.: Well, they say, look, a
year or 18 months is really optimistic.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.100
The record for making a vaccine in this country
is the mumps vaccine, which was made in back

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.690
the '50s, and it took four years. We -- now,
things have set up in modern times. We actually

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.660
have vaccine can -- that part has sped up.
You can make a vaccine candidate very quickly.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.620
You can't speed up the immune system. You
still have to do the tests in people.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.930
And coronaviruses have problems. They have
a tendency to create a thing call antibody-dependent

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.260
enhancement when other vaccines have been
made, which means the vaccine can actually

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.840
make you more likely to get the disease, rather
than less, which would be a disaster.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.551
So you have to test carefully against that.
And then there's the production problem. Most

00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:25.060
vaccines are made in batches of five to 10
million doses, because we have about four

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.900
million babies born in this country every
year. But if we need a vaccine that every

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.019
American has to take, that's either 300 million
or 600 million doses, if you need two shots.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.450
So that's a whole different order of magnitude
in vaccine production and getting the factories

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:39.459
working to do that.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.909
JUDY WOODRUFF: A huge, almost an unimaginable
amount.

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:48.920
What about treatment? You mentioned medicines.
What about treatment for the coronavirus?

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.609
Could that make a difference in how people
respond?

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.900
DONALD MCNEIL JR.: It can.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.689
And we're in the clinical trials now. And
those are going to take probably at least

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.459
a couple more months, depending on how many
people get enrolled in the trials and how

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.370
they go.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.269
Most of the medicines we know something about
tend to help people who are already hospitalized

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.261
and in trouble, rather than being something
that you could pop and take as a pill, like

00:03:12.261 --> 00:03:15.409
you can the PrEP for HIV.

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.499
So we're not -- I mean, there's been information
from the White House that the hydroxychloroquine

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:27.639
will work as a preventative. Nobody really
thinks that. It might help people who are

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.499
likely to crash, because it's an immune system
suppressant, but it's not an antiviral.

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:37.120
And most of the antivirals we know about are
-- they're not Lazarus drugs. They don't save

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.290
you. We're not seeing anything like that,
the way antibiotics used to make people come

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.700
back from near death.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.209
So, it may be a long time before we have a
pill that's prophylactic. And then, again,

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.409
we have to make 300 million doses per day,
make it as ubiquitous as aspirin. So that

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.939
will take a while too.

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.599
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about testing, Donald
McNeil. There's so much discussion about that

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:06.010
now, about how there's just not the capacity
for testing that is needed.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.689
But how much does that matter to getting -- getting
us even close to back to normal?

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:13.849
DONALD MCNEIL JR.: It matters enormously.

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.430
I mean, when Dr. Fauci says something like
the virus will tell us, what he means is,

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.150
we have to get a stable platform of the same
number of tests being done all across the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.789
country every day. And then you -- and they
have to be rapid too. You can't have it three,

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.789
four days, go out to state labs.

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:34.699
And then you want it -- you watch that level
of testing to see how many positives and negatives

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.479
you get once you have got a base. And different
people have different estimates as to how

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.379
many tests we need.

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:45.940
I mean, I heard one estimate 750,000 per day.
I heard another estimate from Harvard that

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.060
came out today that they think five to 10
million per day, per day, in order to understand

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.099
across the country where the virus is rising
or falling, so that you would know, hey, we

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.300
have got a hot spot here, we're going to have
to go into something more like a lockdown

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.650
in order to get those people out of the path
of the virus.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.780
So, you're going to need a lot of tests in
order able to be spot that.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:11.090
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, when people say, well,
once we begin to say we're part of the way

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.331
to normal, how much worry is there that we're
going to see a resurgence of this?

00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:19.539
This is not a virus that's just going to go
away, is it?

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:20.780
DONALD MCNEIL JR.: No.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:26.430
And nobody really believes the virus is going
to fade in the summer either. It's spreading

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.960
in India. It's spreading in Brazil. It's spreading
in the Philippines. It's spreading very aptly

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.669
in hot weather countries.

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.979
And that's typical with viruses, that if they
have victims they have never seen before,

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:40.960
the temperature doesn't really make a big
difference.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.790
The worry is that, as we're in lockdown, we
may be the hammer and the dance. The hammer

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.639
has come down, and now we sort of dance out
of lockdown for a little while, but then realize,

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.860
uh-oh, we're getting infections, and that
will mean deaths rise again, so we go back

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.629
into lockdown. And then wait a little while,
it'll drop.

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.060
And on the epidemiological models, it looks
like a row of shark's teeth, where you see

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.479
deaths rising, and then deaths following,
and then deaths rising and deaths falling.

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:07.740
And that could go on until we have a vaccine,
which might be take two or three years.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.300
So a lot of things might happen. Some people
might deliberately decide to infect themselves

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.180
to get out, young, healthy people. That will
be a very risky thing to do.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.590
But people may just get really, really fed
up of being in lockdown, while the rest of

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:27.539
the world is out having fun and taking their
jobs. So there will be a lot of psychological

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.259
changes in this country over the next couple
of years.

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:37.640
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do we ever get back to
a pre-COVID normal, if we can remember what

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.640
that was like?

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.789
DONALD MCNEIL JR.: Hopefully. Hopefully, there
will be a vaccine, ultimately. And that will

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:47.379
-- once we're all protected, we're back to
the where we are with flu shots and measles

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:49.710
shots and everything else. Life will go back
on again.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.849
And maybe life will become better. This will
have -- this is like going through a war.

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:59.389
And in the postwar periods after World War
I and World War II, people's attitude towards

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.910
lives changed. They wanted the League of Nations.
They wanted the United Nations. They -- income

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:05.010
equality changed.

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.660
Life was, for people who lived through that
generation, often, they recognized it was

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.479
more precious. It was like living through
the Blitz. People began to know what was important

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:14.479
in life and what wasn't.

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:18.370
But that's sort of how I stay hopeful through
all this. But we're not there yet. And we

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.849
got to go through some pain before then.

00:07:19.849 --> 00:07:25.800
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that's something we can
at least hang on to, even as we -- as we realize

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.169
the reality of this.

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:29.439
Donald McNeil with "The New York Times," thank
you so much.

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:30.860
DONALD MCNEIL JR.: Thank you for inviting
me.
