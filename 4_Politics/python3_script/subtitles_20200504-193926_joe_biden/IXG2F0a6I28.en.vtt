00:22:23.799 --> 00:22:23.809 align:start position:0%
asked was why can't a big bank just do
 

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:26.980 align:start position:0%
asked was why can't a big bank just do
this<00:22:24.019><c> and</c><00:22:24.490><c> I</c><00:22:25.490><c> never</c><00:22:26.269><c> really</c><00:22:26.600><c> had</c><00:22:26.629><c> a</c><00:22:26.749><c> good</c>

00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:26.990 align:start position:0%
this and I never really had a good
 

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:31.539 align:start position:0%
this and I never really had a good

00:22:31.539 --> 00:22:31.549 align:start position:0%
answer to it I I now think the answer is
 

00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:34.330 align:start position:0%
answer to it I I now think the answer is

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:46.850 align:start position:0%
number one is Islamic sharia law and if
 

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.340 align:start position:0%
number one is Islamic sharia law and if
you're<00:25:47.000><c> a</c><00:25:47.060><c> woman</c><00:25:47.330><c> you'll</c><00:25:47.570><c> be</c><00:25:47.720><c> wearing</c><00:25:47.960><c> a</c><00:25:48.020><c> burqa</c>

00:25:48.340 --> 00:25:48.350 align:start position:0%
you're a woman you'll be wearing a burqa
 

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
you're a woman you'll be wearing a burqa
so<00:25:48.889><c> that's</c><00:25:49.039><c> a</c><00:25:49.100><c> very</c><00:25:49.130><c> different</c><00:25:49.340><c> picture</c><00:25:50.059><c> of</c>
