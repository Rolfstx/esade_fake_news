00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.270
When you do business,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.019
don't worry about competition.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:15.690
There's nowhere in this

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.979
world where there's no competition.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:18.749
You have to get used to it.

00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:22.310
You cannot

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.640
stop globalization.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.779
The world is getting so small.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.670
If you cannot stop it,

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.499
improve it.

00:00:29.505 --> 00:00:32.050
Forget about the

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.100
competition today.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.670
It's like a 10,000

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.460
meters running.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.100
For the first 200 meters,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.860
don't think that guy is the
competitor;

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.394
keep on running.

00:00:42.262 --> 00:00:43.479
3000 meters later,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:44.229
you will know is a competitor.

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:49.725
He's

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.679
got that quality that I think unites

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.589
so many people who are ultimately
successful.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:07.229
He is relentless.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.794
The internet is opportunity for
small business.

00:01:09.132 --> 00:01:10.869
He's sort of like the

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.329
pied piper of the Internet in China.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.189
Don't miss this chance.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.619
First he attracted employees.

00:01:16.172 --> 00:01:16.999
How are you doing?

00:01:17.046 --> 00:01:17.096
How are you?

00:01:18.628 --> 00:01:20.740
And then he attracted millions of
businesses

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.189
to build their business on the
platforms.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.480
40 countries this year.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:25.629
A hundred and seventy hours.

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:26.999
Forty... like forty

00:01:28.305 --> 00:01:29.610
six.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.740
We know that we have to be

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.290
humble, we have to serve our
customers.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.389
Jack Ma has done a phenomenal job

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.640
to create a business that is

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.150
second to none in the world.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.850
He is the largest retailer.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.989
Investors may not like us;

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.539
if customers like

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.660
us, we have the future.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.070
I heard they call him crazy Jack Ma.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.980
I think it takes a little bit of

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.220
craziness or madness

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.729
to achieve anything.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.450
I was born in a very normal

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.070
family and poor family.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.750
Six people share $7

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.010
a month.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.650
We can only eat to one chicken a
year.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.400
Was terrible.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.460
Nixon visited my city.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:12.890
1972,

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.239
China USA sign the- Mao

00:02:15.497 --> 00:02:17.110
Zedong and Nixon signed the
agreement.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:18.910
So China become open door.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.299
My city Hangzhou was one of the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.270
first cities that opened

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.730
to the west.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:25.859
We got a lot of American tourists to
visit

00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:27.240
my city.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.520
What he would do is he would
befriend

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.139
foreign visitors who came to
Hangzhou

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:33.670
to walk around the West Lake there.

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.540
And I learned English

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.700
by being a free guide for

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.450
tour guide.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.379
No more than the language,

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:42.359
Jack was learning about the

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.930
culture.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.510
The things I learned from books from
China

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.470
are so different from the things I
learn from the

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.260
American visitors.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.950
So I started to think differently.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.440
You know in China, for so many
decades,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.939
the kind of personal ambition

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.810
that he exemplifies was suppressed.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.310
When Deng Xiaping came along

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.650
and sort of took the top off of
things

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.750
and said, "It's OK to have your

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.789
private ambition to make something

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.150
of yourself, it won't get you in
political

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.719
trouble," this was a kind of an
invitation

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.120
from people like Jack Ma.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.920
His goal was always

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.960
to create something

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.100
that would change China.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.636
When I tried to be a Policeman -
reject.

00:03:23.778 --> 00:03:25.220
When I tried to be a KFC

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.590
person - reject.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.560
I want to be a hotel waiter -
rejected.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.440
So I get used to it.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.610
As entrepreneur,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.840
one of the qualities I have is that

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.329
when I'm rejected by people,

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.440
I get used to that.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.389
The road to wherever we all

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.370
end up is not always

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:41.360
perfect.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.219
It's paved with lots of difficulty

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.840
and challenge

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.860
and failure and

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.100
you have to summon up some sort of
strength

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.200
within you to believe in yourself.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.930
Jack Ma grew up in relatively modest
means

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.760
and then he became a teacher.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.729
And by all accounts that's

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.529
sort of where he expected to be for
quite

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.949
some time.

00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:02.749
Then I came to America in 1995.

00:04:03.575 --> 00:04:05.450
First a trip to the States.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.089
And first time in my

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.410
life I touched to keep all the
computers.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.409
And he started searching things on

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.690
the Internet. When he searched
China,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.730
nothing came up in the search
results.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.110
So he said to himself,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.520
"If I can

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.700
put Chinese companies on the
Internet

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.779
and allow them to connect

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.119
with business people in the U.S.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.440
and other countries,

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.509
I could create possibly a really
powerful

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.500
business."

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.590
I called myself at that time like

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.399
a blind man riding on

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.130
the back of blind tigers.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.539
Without knowing anything about
technology

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.870
or computers, we started our the
first

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.330
company.

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.280
He's gone against all convention.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.020
He says that

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.660
he doesn't know anything about
technology.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.220
It's hard to believe.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.629
When he started his first company,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.280
called China pages,

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.950
he would go knocking on the doors

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.760
of government officials.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.459
They would really just turn him away
saying

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.469
that what he was doing

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.700
wasn't appropriate.

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.050
He should just go back to

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.920
maybe teaching English.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.729
This was opening day for something
called

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.639
Windows 95 that has something

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.609
to do with computers.

00:05:11.235 --> 00:05:13.010
With Deng now gone,

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.169
China's future will be shaped by a

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.939
great power struggle.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.439
Well, 1997 proved to be a watershed

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.630
year for Asia, the year when the
Asian

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:22.399
economic miracle became a

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.209
thing of the past.

00:05:23.495 --> 00:05:25.580
There seems to be no stopping the
speeding

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.679
tech train; technology stocks keep
climbing

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.360
into record territory.

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.549
2000 and when the internet

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:32.779
was starting to boom in China,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.899
a friend told me that there was

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.739
a company trying to go global from

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.390
an apartment in Hangzhou.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:39.740
Eighteen years ago,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.330
in my apartment,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.739
I told the 18 founders

00:05:43.505 --> 00:05:45.259
that one day

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.670
we would build up a site.

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.040
This site would be the top 10 sites

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.780
of the world.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.290
Very few people believed

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:55.920
that we would make it happen.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.399
Jack's greatest strength is bringing
together

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.770
ordinary people to do

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.359
these incredible things that they
never

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:03.770
thought was possible.

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:05.210
Most of my colleagues

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.799
and 18 founders they were my
students,

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.300
my friends.

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.310
None of them were very successful.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.690
Among the 18 people,

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:14.030
there were only three people who

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.130
know something about computers.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.960
Being first in China

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.520
was a key. You've got to remember
there was not

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.249
great infrastructure for

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.729
even the telephone.

00:06:23.105 --> 00:06:24.660
When Alibhai we got started

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.910
and when I joined the company,

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.410
trying to sell businesses in China

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.470
the Internet was like trying to sell

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.000
magic beans to someone.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.620
I mean they couldn't see it,

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.850
they couldn't touch it,

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.829
and here was this guy - this kind

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.870
of interesting looking English
teacher -

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:40.519
coming door to door to try

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.289
and tell people they should spend

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.370
their money,

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.110
several thousands of dollars,

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.969
to put their company on this thing
called

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.359
the Internet.

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:49.840
What it really was was a

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.290
opportunity for

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.690
corporations really

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.849
in other parts of the world to try

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.670
to source manufacturing

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:00.619
in China via the

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.760
web.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:02.809
In the past eighteen years when

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.520
I do Internet in China,

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.230
we got a criticism every day.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.850
You know something where you believe
it,

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:09.260
a lot of people criticize it.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.000
But if you really believe,

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:11.930
continue to do it.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:12.830
Improve it.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.040
We were rejected by more than 30

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.040
venture capitalists

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.020
but we are very optimistic.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.000
We believe in the future.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.920
We believe in Internet.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.409
And we believe that if

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.030
we do not succeed,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.320
somebody will.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.299
The big investment came when
Masayoshi

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.609
Son of Softbank met

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:32.570
with Jack.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.699
And the story is that Masayoshi

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.859
Son was in Beijing meeting

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.989
with a number of

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.909
Internet entrepreneurs who presented
very

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.610
detailed business plans,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.989
but Jack got Jack Ma got up

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.370
with no presentation

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.559
and just a story - a vision of

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.339
what he wanted to do,

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:51.630
what he wanted to Alibaba to become
-

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.539
and the Masayoshi Son got so

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:55.429
excited about it that he

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:57.529
pledged to invest as much as

00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.900
40 million dollars in the company.

00:08:00.290 --> 00:08:01.429
And Jack turned it down

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:03.050
and said you know what,

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.910
we only need 20 million at this
time.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.089
Masa obviously gave capital to Jack

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:11.770
Ma that he desperately needed.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:13.600
And also

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.569
made the single greatest investment
one can

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.410
argue, ever.

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.160
Period.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.440
Jack Ma's played a very

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.779
key role in sort of the development

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:24.580
of the Internet in China

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.470
but not as we originally imagined

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.369
the Internet would develop.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.109
He has used it as a vector

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.340
for commerce.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:32.450
So it started with some roadshows

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.810
with just maybe 100 people,

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:36.010
then 200,

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.794
then thousands

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.830
and more - thousands more -

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.779
where finally Jack turned this into

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.880
a mass movement across

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.009
China where he educated small

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:47.049
businesses about why they

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:48.310
needed to use the Internet.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.589
And he really created a revolution
by

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.479
educating his customers one person

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:53.260
at a time.

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.030
This is such a big monster.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:57.879
It is something that never happened
in the

00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:58.840
history before.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.420
So we think we are

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.440
changing China.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.200
We're helping China to the second

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:05.650
level.

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.539
He understood what technology

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.729
could do for the Chinese people

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:12.610
in terms of affording them access

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.480
to the worlds of

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.570
product.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.629
And he's done it.

00:09:17.175 --> 00:09:18.879
Alibaba went from this sort

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.619
of optimistic expansion

00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:23.660
phase to to this somewhat depressing

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.729
phase of cutting back

00:09:24.895 --> 00:09:26.669
and I think for just a moment in

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.179
time he even wondered if the company

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.280
would survive.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:46.200
The ecosystem of Africa,

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:48.099
the lives is not designed by

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:48.620
lion,

00:09:49.415 --> 00:09:50.260
tiger

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:50.950
and elephants.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.880
Life is designed by the minor

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.010
insects.

00:09:54.785 --> 00:09:55.920
For us,

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:56.970
consumers,

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.630
small business are the key.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.509
If we can serve these consumers

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.700
and small businesses well,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.440
big companies will get involved.

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:06.230
They will start to see it coming.

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.580
So if you keep good sides

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.740
of shrimps,

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:10.669
all the sharks will come.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.540
Big fish will come.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:15.309
When we

00:10:15.955 --> 00:10:17.639
started Alibaba B2B, we are helping
small

00:10:18.030 --> 00:10:19.920
business selling things

00:10:20.070 --> 00:10:21.000
across the board.

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:21.764
So we think: "Which

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.930
country has the best technologies

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.730
on the Internet?" We say USA.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.719
So we decided to

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.640
build up a huge office

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.840
in San Francisco.

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.850
But what happened was it

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.670
created a disaster inside the
company.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.679
We had a division where half the
team

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.810
was in the US, half the team was in
China

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.850
and there was a lot of friction
between the management.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.740
So we did know something wrong we
say

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:48.990
we have to shut down the office.

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:50.579
And it was at a time in 2000

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.049
when the Internet bust had hit

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.150
us really hard

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:56.219
and we were laying off staff around
the

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.360
world.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.289
A lot of analysts think the Internet
bubble

00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.099
is ready to burst

00:10:59.490 --> 00:11:01.140
and by this time next year

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.869
a huge number of those dot coms

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.880
might be dot gone.

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.840
And Alibaba went from this sort of

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.390
optimistic expansion phase

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.279
to this somewhat depressing phase

00:11:11.730 --> 00:11:12.630
of cutting back.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:14.669
That was the only time I ever saw
him doubt

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.619
himself is when he was laying off

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.539
people and I think for just a moment
in time

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:21.090
he even wondered if the company
would survive.

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.220
And from that moment on he realized

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.559
that being a CEO is different

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.210
from being an English teacher.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:29.489
Being a CEO means making the tough

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.450
decisions

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.659
and sometimes cutting back in

00:11:32.965 --> 00:11:34.380
order to allow the company to
survive.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:35.649
So from that moment on,

00:11:36.015 --> 00:11:37.619
I never saw Jack doubt himself

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.270
again.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.070
I watched a wonderful movie

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.590
called Forrest Gump.

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.899
I was touched. He said: "Life's

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:46.979
like a box of chocolates,

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:48.780
you know what you get.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.130
He really does love Forrest Gump.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:52.220
But if you keep on getting,

00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:53.249
you will get a good chocolate.

00:11:53.515 --> 00:11:55.020
He just sees it,

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.159
in some way,

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.730
as a corollary for

00:11:58.740 --> 00:11:59.399
the American dream

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.529
and all the things

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:03.490
you can potentially do in life.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:05.879
And I find that Forrest Gump made a
fortune

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:08.300
by catch shrimps not

00:12:08.390 --> 00:12:09.330
catch whales.

00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:11.730
So helping small business

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:13.800
will make me like a Forrest Gump.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.900
Forrest Gump just to keep on
running.

00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:16.589
Be simple,

00:12:17.145 --> 00:12:18.330
serve the people.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.189
He can try to compare himself to
Forrest

00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.660
Gump, he can't ever be Forrest Gump;

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:24.449
he is right out there,

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.530
right in front,

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:27.329
doing everything that

00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:29.430
he thinks will be

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.800
in a pioneering spirit.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:33.479
He is a pioneer much more than

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:35.280
Forrest Gump was.

00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:36.869
He has always had the courage to
live

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.460
with his decisions

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.320
and to move on

00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:41.819
and to reinvent

00:12:42.855 --> 00:12:44.489
and I think that

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:46.319
is the very definition

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:47.669
today of bravery.

00:12:48.105 --> 00:12:48.929
In the early days,

00:12:49.155 --> 00:12:51.180
a lot of people were trying to tell
him to

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:52.379
change the way he talked,

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:54.709
to change the way he acted - it
wasn't

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.370
CEO-like enough.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:58.090
We should not,

00:12:58.560 --> 00:12:59.939
you know, throw out the baby because

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:01.469
the baby is crying too much.

00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:03.689
And I watched him that just

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:04.860
by being himself

00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:05.970
and being authentic

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.830
and speaking with his own voice

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:10.190
was something that people found
refreshing

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.210
and it was something that was easy
for us

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:14.430
to get behind.

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.039
President Bush is continuing his
Asian

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.960
tour.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:18.899
The death toll has risen

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.240
and the mystery pneumonia like
illness

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:21.869
gripping much of Asia.

00:13:22.755 --> 00:13:24.690
China made history this morning,

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:26.669
launching its first astronaut into

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:27.300
orbit.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.019
I first learned about Taobao

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:35.100
when it was still just a secret

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:35.760
project.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.370
The ALibaba that we all know today

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.540
began as

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.699
Taobao which is the marketplace

00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:43.800
by which people in China

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.900
could sell things to other people.

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:47.010
Jack Ma,

00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:49.230
he pulled some of the key employees
from

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.570
all Alibaba into his office

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:52.950
and he said: "Listen,

00:13:53.250 --> 00:13:55.610
you're going to have to go back to
the original

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.790
Alibaba apartment.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.160
You're going to have to work in
seclusion.

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.690
You can't tell your friends,

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:01.860
you can't tell your family.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.080
You can't even tell the other
Alibaba

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.280
employees about this."

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:07.199
So when we see something is

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.210
coming, you have to prepare now.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.089
He realized that eBay,

00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:12.299
sooner or later as it grew

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:13.230
in China,

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:15.029
would start coming after Alibaba's

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.200
customers.

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:17.699
Very interested in China right now,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.650
it could be one of our biggest
markets.

00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.930
My belief is you have to repair

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.000
the roof while it is still sunshine.

00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.890
Above started free

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.889
and I think by announcing we're
going to be

00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:31.110
free for three years put a lot of
pressure

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:31.970
on eBay.

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:33.840
Point blank he said,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:35.730
they're not going to succeed;

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:36.720
I'm going to get them.

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.009
And eBay's reaction put out a

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.569
press release saying 'free

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:42.250
is not a business model'

00:14:42.490 --> 00:14:43.390
but in fact

00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.789
we knew that because

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.040
we were getting so many people on

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.659
tp Taobao because we were free

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.409
in the early days,

00:14:51.325 --> 00:14:53.050
ultimately we could make money.

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:55.050
I always believe one thing.

00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:56.904
You lose only

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:58.540
when you give up.

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:59.710
And in the end,

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:01.570
as a surprise to

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:02.140
eBay,

00:15:02.570 --> 00:15:03.609
Jack decided to do a deal

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:04.660
with Yahoo.

00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.699
Yahoo agreed to purchase Alibaba's
shares

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.860
for $1 billion in cash

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.049
which not only makes Yahoo the
largest strategic

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:12.820
investor in Alibaba

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.259
but also helps it grow its

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.670
brand in China.

00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:17.289
Jack's motivation for partnering

00:15:17.770 --> 00:15:19.630
with Yahoo was really,

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.819
we can add that to the rest of

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.780
our businesses and become a sort of
an

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.610
eBay plus a

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.489
Google plus Yahoo all

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:28.600
combined together.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.339
One of the reasons many many
multinational

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.770
companies that go to China.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.380
They want to compete with local
companies

00:15:35.890 --> 00:15:37.780
instead of making customerse happy.

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:40.210
Jack Ma did a sort of a

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:43.270
minor miracle in beating eBay.

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:45.459
Another story out on eBay today

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.789
it's down 0.2 percent,

00:15:47.265 --> 00:15:49.120
eBay talking about cutting off,

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.100
at some point in time in the future,

00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:53.810
it's Chinese it's Chinese website.

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.970
eBay couldn't win there.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:56.890
They just don't know what the hell
they were doing.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.080
When I'm going to succeed at
something,

00:15:59.330 --> 00:15:59.689
I feel excited;

00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.210
I feel honored. Wow,

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:01.959
why I have the chance.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.609
We saw that there is a huge
opportunity

00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:05.919
in China because in China the
banking

00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.019
is so inefficient we realized

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.540
if we could create a payment system,

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.639
it could grow to much more than a
payment

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.280
system - it could become a financial
institution.

00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:16.989
And this opened of course a huge

00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.969
door because it enabled

00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:21.129
him to- there was no way to pay

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:22.420
for things online.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.399
People didn't yet have credit cards
so

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.380
with AliPay you added a

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.540
very important room on his house.

00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.480
And that was the room of how do we

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:31.690
get payments made.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.269
Being creative in business is a

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:35.709
whole other kind of creativity

00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:38.500
but creativity nonetheless.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.569
To be able envision different
business

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:42.549
models, to be able to envision

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.500
how life can change.

00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.780
This was a true revolution in China

00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.000
both in consumerism

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.710
and in the Chinese economy.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.910
This is huge.

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:54.960
The number of products on fun

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:56.610
Alibaba is

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.840
gigantic. I don't know the number

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:00.310
but it's phenomenal.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:02.980
I don't think I could ever
appreciate

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:04.929
the pressures that Jack Ma is under

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.059
to be a hard-charging

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:09.640
entrepreneur at the same time

00:17:09.849 --> 00:17:11.199
as he's a part of a

00:17:11.875 --> 00:17:13.539
communist system in some

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:14.020
way.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:16.470
That takes people away.

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:19.159
Leaders of businesses can disappear.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.620
I believe the three things

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.330
should not touch.

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:36.770
Power,

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.030
money,

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.630
the glory.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.070
If you keep the power

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:44.214
in your office,

00:17:44.682 --> 00:17:45.460
you're in trouble.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.519
If you keep the money in

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:49.980
your own pocket you will be trouble.

00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:52.209
If you put the glory on your head,

00:17:52.765 --> 00:17:53.318
you'll be in trouble.

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:54.910
So when you have the money,

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:56.910
spend the money supporting more
people.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.790
When you have power, empower in

00:17:59.060 --> 00:17:59.550
the others.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:00.199
With the glory,

00:18:00.735 --> 00:18:02.020
let the others have that hat.

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:06.690
Joe it's quite a mob here.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.340
There are more than 130 press
organizations

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.561
waiting here to see Jack Ma.

00:18:11.076 --> 00:18:12.480
You felt like it was

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.209
The Oscars.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.886
I was oohing

00:18:15.063 --> 00:18:16.870
and ahing because you have to admire
that kind of thing.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:20.440
The IPO of Alibaba was the single
largest

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:22.490
and biggest day

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:22.800
that I can remember.

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:30.250
It didn't disappoint.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.599
It went up enormously at the time.

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:33.709
This is the beginning of

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.240
Alibaba.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.330
It gave it a market value larger
than that of

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.730
Wal-Mart on day one.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.699
Ma himself has become China's
richest man

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.980
just by the founding of Alibaba.

00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:43.669
Today he is expected to be worth
north

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.519
of twenty two billion dollars.

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:47.890
This was a very big deal for China

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:48.670
not just for Alibaba.

00:18:49.930 --> 00:18:51.610
Today what we've got is not the
money.

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:53.740
What we've got is the trust

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.210
from the people.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:18:58.910
You go to the headquarters,

00:18:58.930 --> 00:18:59.860
it's very interesting.

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:01.240
It's all young people.

00:19:01.250 --> 00:19:03.009
I didn't see- I don't think I saw
anybody in the

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:04.760
headquarters over 30.

00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.889
When we hire a lot of people,

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:06.990
I never see their diploma,

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.430
I just see whether they are
optimistic,

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:10.659
whether they want to learn new
things,

00:19:10.810 --> 00:19:11.709
if they want to change things,

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:12.910
if they want to work in teamwork.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:16.090
Those people were below
30-years-old.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.210
They are the internet generation.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:21.760
They are the generation going to
change

00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.360
the future.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.239
We think data is

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.049
going to be so important

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.240
to human life in the future.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:30.519
So now we just that we are

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:31.659
the first to runner.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.859
Compared to tomorrow,

00:19:33.475 --> 00:19:34.780
our data is nothing.

00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:37.450
Jack Ma day-to-day is not running
Alibaba.

00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:38.049
He is the visionary,

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.999
he is the strategic

00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.790
thinker about the big picture.

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.110
Next 30 years,

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.900
the technology is going to challenge

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.060
a lot of job opportunities.

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:51.489
People are already unhappy because a
lot of machine

00:19:51.940 --> 00:19:52.929
learning, artificial intelligence,

00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:54.480
is killing a lot of the job.

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:55.609
People start to worry.

00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:57.490
So I think the good thing is that

00:19:57.940 --> 00:19:59.740
technology is improving

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:00.670
people's lives.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:03.210
Jack Ma is someone who always dreams

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:05.500
big. I mean really big.

00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:07.430
A lot of us have dreams

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.460
but Jack's dreams almost seem

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.900
unrealistic, they're so big.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.810
Machine is good knowledge

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.130
but human beings are good at wisdom.

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:16.959
You have to stay relevant

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:18.820
but at the same time

00:20:19.270 --> 00:20:20.860
you also have to be a risk taker

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.289
and have to shake things

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:24.400
up a little bit.

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.790
Well Alibaba what to do next 10-30

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:28.540
years is to enable

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.940
the innovation of traditional
business,

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:32.590
transform the world,

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.930
transform all the traditional

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:35.970
retailer,

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:37.180
manufacturer,

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:38.680
financial sectors.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.209
He's created one of the largest
financial services

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:42.670
companies in the country on the back
of,

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:45.010
in a sense, Alibaba.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:46.629
We are enabling small

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.819
businesses and young people to

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.259
be able to reach financial

00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:51.490
support.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.620
They're the first private company

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:56.740
to become bank-approved

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:58.540
by the Chinese government.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:20:59.770
I think it's monstrous.

00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.330
I think it's very important

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.610
but I would think that it's also

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.010
probably nerve wracking.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:10.030
It's great to be Goliath

00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:12.400
if you're in a open society

00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:13.750
and a free economy.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.779
It can be very problematic to be a
Goliath

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:19.149
when the other Goliath

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:21.370
is the Chinese Communist Party.

00:21:21.730 --> 00:21:23.350
I don't think I could ever
appreciate

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:25.510
the pressures that Jack was under

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:27.189
to be a hard-charging

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.319
entrepreneur at the same time

00:21:29.965 --> 00:21:31.600
as he's part of

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:33.460
a communist system,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.240
in some way,

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.039
that takes people away,

00:21:36.805 --> 00:21:38.260
leaders of businesses,

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:39.240
and disappears them.

00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.270
It takes a lot of- a

00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:43.179
lot of fancy footwork to keep

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.070
on the right side of that.

00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:47.880
So sometimes when I look at these

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.230
business people doing things,

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:51.640
I say: "Wow.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.680
I'm not I don't do things like
that."

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.539
He realized that although

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:57.669
the Chinese government didn't like

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.709
the Internet for political content

00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:01.839
or for the ability for people to
criticize

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.029
the government, what they did

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:06.280
like about the Internet was that

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.329
it could help create jobs

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.670
and help grow the economy.

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.400
Every day more than 200

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.000
million people are shopping

00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:15.699
through a mobile phone on

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:16.420
our site.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.009
You're seeing people in the middle
of China

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.380
with their smartphone pressed a few
buttons

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:22.389
and they can buy lobster from Maine

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:25.000
or cherries from Washington.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:27.790
I would argue the growth of the
mobile phone

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.129
was probably the single most
important thing

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.350
that has helped Alibaba

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.700
become a giant it is.

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:35.379
We have more than 10-20

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.629
million small businesses using

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:38.680
our platform

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:40.449
and 60 percent of them,

00:22:40.695 --> 00:22:42.550
this business never exist

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:43.060
before Alibaba.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.230
And

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.419
he is so enthusiastic about what
he's

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:51.159
doing and what he's doing is pretty

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:52.030
simple.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.300
It takes a genius to think of the
simple.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.820
One of the secret sauce for Alibaba

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:00.420
is that we have more than 48

00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:02.519
per cent of

00:23:02.700 --> 00:23:03.849
the people in the company -

00:23:04.515 --> 00:23:05.760
they are women.

00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:08.190
He's supporting women in an era

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:08.590
where,

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.700
you know there's still residue

00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:13.020
of disrespect for women.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.519
And I think for him to be able to
bring that

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:17.440
to China is extraordinary.

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.540
I do everything to make sure

00:23:19.570 --> 00:23:21.129
that I'm- my customer

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:22.810
happy, employee happy,

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:23.830
the society is good.

00:23:23.940 --> 00:23:24.520
It's healthy.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.979
Social responsibility is the

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.580
key.

00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:31.460
For somebody who is sort of

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.060
preposterously unlikely to

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:35.470
have become what he's become,

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:36.849
he's more

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:39.450
or less stayed who is.

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.280
He is someone who

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.479
wants to do good not only

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:45.040
in business but in the world.

00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:46.990
He has the power to inspire other
people.

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:50.019
He has the ability to understand
what he

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.469
doesn't understand,

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:53.139
but knows that he can find

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.879
people who can and will for

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:55.420
him.

00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:57.150
I think he saw

00:23:58.570 --> 00:23:59.920
the possibilities

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.574
of a new way of not

00:24:02.762 --> 00:24:03.940
only doing business,

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:04.900
but of life.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:07.889
He's focused on these bigger issues

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:09.989
and where are the company's going in

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:11.990
the broad sort of arc

00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:13.040
of history.

00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:15.780
If you were to ask Jack Ma what's
his greatest accomplishment,

00:24:16.410 --> 00:24:17.670
it would not be,

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:20.220
you know, becoming the richest man
in China

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.839
or building a company worth

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.340
hundreds of billions of dollars.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.169
I think he might measure his own

00:24:25.410 --> 00:24:27.089
success by the impact

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.039
that he's created on China

00:24:29.895 --> 00:24:31.880
rather than impact

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:32.729
he's created on just himself

00:24:33.270 --> 00:24:33.900
and his own team.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:35.370
It's always

00:24:36.510 --> 00:24:38.359
scary looking far away.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.310
Oh my God, that's a difficult place.

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:41.850
Go there.

00:24:42.370 --> 00:24:42.620
Test.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.660
Jump into it.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.300
You never learn to swim until you're
in

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:47.670
the water.
