00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:02.969
-Hello, everyone, and welcome
to the attic again.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:04.937
We just got back from
a week-long hiatus.

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:07.440
Although let's be honest, "back"
isn't quite the right word,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.675
because I didn't go anywhere.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:10.309
I just sat here
with the lights off,

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.245
quietly performing
"Closer Looks" to myself

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:14.080
about how every time I kill
a wasp in the attic,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.315
three more appear
to avenge their kin.

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.451
I got so bored,
I started parting my hair

00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:19.785
on the other side.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.220
And sure, sure,

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.355
I also did some drinking alone,
which is depressing.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:25.158
I mean, it's always depressing.

00:00:25.158 --> 00:00:27.727
But a year ago, I was drinking
with Rihanna,

00:00:27.727 --> 00:00:29.895
so this is a precipitous
drop-off.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.332
And look, I know this is
a long shot, but, Rihanna,

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:35.568
if you're on Zoom,
my meeting I.D. is 917-112-15

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.571
and the password is "Work work
work work work work from home."

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:40.940
Anyway, let's just get into it
without a segue.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.976
The president suggested
the coronavirus could be cured

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:46.112
with disinfectants,
then said he was joking,

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:48.214
then threatened to stop doing
press briefings altogether,

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:50.149
which of course we know
he can't do

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.453
because he loves cameras
more than wasps love my attic.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:54.821
There's the segue.
For more on this,

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.222
it's time for
"A Closer Look."

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.825
♪♪

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.562
I got to be honest, when we went
on hiatus a week ago,

00:01:02.562 --> 00:01:04.363
I did not expect that
when we came back

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:06.232
I'd be talking about
the president suggesting

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.468
you could use disinfectants
and powerful lights

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:10.603
to cure coronavirus,
but then again that's on me.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.371
I mean, I should have
expected it.

00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:14.941
We should all know by now
Trump will be more outlandish

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.710
with each passing week
because that's his nature.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.646
It's like the frog
and the scorpion fable.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:23.049
I won't go through the whole
thing, but at the end,

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.551
the scorpion stings the frog,
and as they sink

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:27.953
to their deaths, the frog says,
"Why would you sting me?"

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:29.421
And the scorpion responds,

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:30.990
[As Trump] "Some people
are saying scorpion venom

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.758
is an effective treatment
for the coronavirus.

00:01:32.758 --> 00:01:35.561
I'm not a doctor, but I have --
you know, I have heard that,

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:36.930
and what do you have to lose?

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.532
Blub, blub,
this is Obama's fault."

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:41.067
That was a scorpion drowning.

00:01:41.067 --> 00:01:42.802
We have to expect this nonsense.

00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:44.170
Looking back,
I should have known

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.738
I'd be doing my show
from the attic

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.173
before this was all over.

00:01:47.173 --> 00:01:49.508
When Trump won in 2016,
I should have called up

00:01:49.508 --> 00:01:51.043
the wardrobe department
and said,

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:53.346
"Hey, could I get a few more
shirts to put in my attic

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:55.347
in case I ever have to do
the show up there?"

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:56.649
And they would have said,
"How many?"

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.284
And I would have said,
"Five.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.553
I mean, I can't imagine it will
be for more than a week."

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:02.054
And then they would have said,
"Okay,

00:02:02.054 --> 00:02:04.156
but if it's more than a week,
you'll have to rotate shirts,"

00:02:04.156 --> 00:02:08.661
And I'd say, "Guys, it's not
gonna be more than a week."

00:02:08.661 --> 00:02:12.164
Long story short, this shirt
has now been on camera

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:14.300
more than any
recurring character

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.536
I ever did on "SNL."

00:02:16.536 --> 00:02:18.905
So, congratulations, shirt.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:21.541
Anyway, after the president said
that psychotic thing

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:23.409
in a White House briefing
last week,

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.612
he cycled through his usual
series of obviously BS excuses,

00:02:26.612 --> 00:02:28.948
starting with the classic,
"I was just joking,"

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:31.784
because if there's one thing
people want from leadership

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:33.786
during a pandemic,
it's sarcasm,

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:36.121
and that was me
using sarcasm.

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:38.857
-I was asking a question
sarcastically to reporters

00:02:38.857 --> 00:02:40.759
like you, just to see
what would happen.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:44.397
But I was asking a sarcastic --
and a very sarcastic question

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:47.166
to the reporters in the room

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:49.836
about disinfectant
on the inside.

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.170 line:0%
Okay.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.039 line:0%
-But you were asking your
medical experts to look into it.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.173 line:0%
-No. No, no, no.

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:55.375 line:0%
-Were you being sarcastic
with them?

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.176
-To look into whether or not sun

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:59.411
and disinfectant on the hands,

00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:02.114
but whether or not sun
can help us.

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:04.717
-You have two renowned
scientists working with you.

00:03:04.717 --> 00:03:07.820
Why are you pitching ideas
like a 6th-century Druid?

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.758
"Maybe the sun can help us.
Have we thought about sun?"

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:14.160
More often than not,
Trump's ideas for solutions

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.596
are things that have always
been there

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:19.132
and require no work or effort
from him.

00:03:19.132 --> 00:03:22.001
He's like a kid who forgot
it was show-and-tell.

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:24.404
"While I appreciate everything
my classmates

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:26.705
have brought in today, I would
like you to direct your eyes

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:29.842
out the window to an item
I brought

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:32.545
which is 100 times the
size of Earth."

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:34.047
"Did you forget, Tyler?

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.447
Did you forget it was
show-and-tell day?"

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:37.517
"I did. I did forget.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:41.620
"Also, my diorama
is just my mouth."

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.490
And you were not talking
to reporters.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.092
You turned to your
medical advisers,

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:48.561
directly addressed them,

00:03:48.561 --> 00:03:50.129
and asked them
to look into it.

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.298
-And then I see the disinfectant

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:55.802
where it knocks it out
in a minute, one minute,

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:58.637
and is there a way we can do
something like that,

00:03:58.637 --> 00:04:01.807
uh, by injection inside or --

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:04.577
or almost a cleaning?

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:05.844
Because you see it
gets in the lungs

00:04:05.844 --> 00:04:07.846
and it does a tremendous
number on the lungs,

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:09.482
so it would be interesting
to check that,

00:04:09.482 --> 00:04:12.251
so that you're going to have to
use medical doctors with.

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:14.987
But it sounds -- it sounds
interesting to me.

00:04:14.987 --> 00:04:17.589
I would like you to speak
to the medical doctors

00:04:17.589 --> 00:04:20.993
to see if there's any way
that you can apply

00:04:20.993 --> 00:04:26.498
light and heat to cure,
you know?

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:28.600
If you could. And maybe
you can, maybe you can't.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.470
Again, I say maybe you can,
maybe you can't.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.938
I'm not a doctor.
But I'm like a person

00:04:32.938 --> 00:04:34.673
that has a good, you know what.

00:04:34.673 --> 00:04:36.175
-But, sir, you're
the president.

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:38.244
-Deborah, have you ever
heard of that...

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:42.315
the heat and the light
relative to certain viruses,

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.283
yes, but relative to
this virus?

00:04:44.283 --> 00:04:46.452
-Just look at
Dr. Birx's face

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:48.421
while he's asking her
these insane questions.

00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:51.657
If this keeps up, she's gonna
start wearing five more scarves.

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:53.259
And look, we just need to be
prepared.

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:54.660
This is going to keep happening.

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.061
Trump is a powerful dumb guy,

00:04:56.061 --> 00:04:57.863
and he is friends with
other powerful dumb guys,

00:04:57.863 --> 00:04:59.398
and they like to
call each other up

00:04:59.398 --> 00:05:01.066
and pitch their dumb ideas
to each other.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:03.735
The whole thing is like a
lifelong episode of "Shark Tank"

00:05:03.735 --> 00:05:05.971
where no one has a good idea
and everyone wins.

00:05:05.971 --> 00:05:07.773
"They're called sock gloves."

00:05:07.773 --> 00:05:09.141
"Yeah, I'm in.
I'm in.

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:11.643
Yeah, we're all --
we're all in."

00:05:11.643 --> 00:05:13.779
At his next press conference,
Trump's gonna tell people

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.682
they can replenish their energy
by eating one battery a day.

00:05:16.682 --> 00:05:19.085
"Some people need double-A.
Some people need triple-A.

00:05:19.085 --> 00:05:22.654
The other day, someone on the
street told me I'm a giant D."

00:05:22.654 --> 00:05:25.157
Look, this matters,
sadly, because Trump is,

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:26.625
you know, he's the president,

00:05:26.625 --> 00:05:28.394
and unfortunately,
people listen to him,

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:30.529
as Maryland's Republican
governor Larry Hogan

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:31.997
explained on Sunday.

00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:34.967
-We had hundreds of calls come
into our emergency hotline

00:05:34.967 --> 00:05:39.205
at our health department,
asking if it was right

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:42.674
to ingest Clorox
or, you know,

00:05:42.674 --> 00:05:44.409
alcohol cleaning products,

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.679
whether that was going to help
them fight the virus.

00:05:46.679 --> 00:05:48.714
So we had to put out that
warning to make sure

00:05:48.714 --> 00:05:51.116
that people were not doing
something like that

00:05:51.116 --> 00:05:53.786
which would kill people,
actually, to do it.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.254
-Jesus.

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.423
Clorox is gonna have to add
a new warning to their labels.

00:05:57.423 --> 00:06:00.760
"Keep away from children and the
President of the United States."

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.363
I mean, this idiot gets on TV
and pitches harebrained ideas

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.030
that are liable
to get people killed

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.199
because he thinks he's
a medical genius, and dude,

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.968
you're not Jonas Salk.

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:10.669
You're Jonas Sulk.

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.106
Remember, he began
this whole outbreak

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:14.907
by repeatedly ignoring
dire warnings

00:06:14.907 --> 00:06:16.241
from public health officials

00:06:16.241 --> 00:06:19.678
and claiming it would
go away like a miracle.

00:06:19.678 --> 00:06:21.681
Now, over 50,000 Americans
are dead

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:23.449
and at least 26 million
are out of work,

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.217
and the president
is still insisting

00:06:25.217 --> 00:06:27.386
there will be
a miraculous ending.

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:28.721
Over the weekend he tweeted,

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:30.756
"I never said that the
coronavirus is a 'Hoax,'

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:33.392
I said that the Democrats
and the way they lied about it

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:34.727
are a Hoax.

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:37.396
Also, it did start with
'one person from China,'

00:06:37.396 --> 00:06:40.365
and then grew,
and will be a 'Miracle' end!"

00:06:40.365 --> 00:06:42.668
No, it's not a miracle end

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:44.804
if in the process people die
or lose their jobs.

00:06:44.804 --> 00:06:47.072
They wouldn't have called it
"The Miracle on Ice"

00:06:47.072 --> 00:06:48.774
if the entire American
hockey team had drowned

00:06:48.774 --> 00:06:50.209
in Lake Placid.

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:52.445
Also, this will end,
not because of a miracle,

00:06:52.445 --> 00:06:54.914
but thanks to the hard work
of medical professionals

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.615
as well as the collective
efforts we're making

00:06:56.615 --> 00:06:58.384
as a society
to slow the spread.

00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:00.652
You know, hard work
and sacrifice.

00:07:00.652 --> 00:07:02.855
But Trump can't recognize
either of those.

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:04.657
Trump is the kind of guy
who if you slaved all day

00:07:04.657 --> 00:07:06.959
in the kitchen to make him
a four-course meal

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:09.194
would finish it and say,
"What's your secret?

00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:10.596
Is it miracles?

00:07:10.596 --> 00:07:12.698
I feel like I tasted miracles
in here."

00:07:12.698 --> 00:07:14.534
This stuff is hurting him
politically.

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:16.302
When the coronavirus
outbreak first began,

00:07:16.302 --> 00:07:18.103
and Trump was getting
free unlimited airtime

00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:20.572
on all the news networks,
his poll numbers

00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:23.075
actually went up
despite his dismal response,

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:25.411
which makes sense because
that's how Trump got popular

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:26.779
in the first place.

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:28.981
He was always on TV,
first "The Apprentice,"

00:07:28.981 --> 00:07:30.749
then "Celebrity Apprentice,"

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:32.651
then his years as
a racist blowhard

00:07:32.651 --> 00:07:34.419
who was always on cable news.

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:37.423
I'm pretty sure he even popped
up in those Liberty Mutual ads.

00:07:37.423 --> 00:07:39.324
Remember, he was the guy
who said insurance

00:07:39.324 --> 00:07:41.326
is a waste of money because
nothing bad ever happens,

00:07:41.326 --> 00:07:43.028
and when it does
you just wait for miracles.

00:07:43.028 --> 00:07:45.063
And then of course there was
his presidential run,

00:07:45.063 --> 00:07:47.066
where cable networks
breathlessly awaited

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:50.002
his speeches by training their
cameras on his empty podium.

00:07:50.002 --> 00:07:51.236
Remember that?

00:07:51.236 --> 00:07:52.771
When the Democratic
candidate for president

00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:56.008
had to compete for the media's
attention with furniture?

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:57.743
Trump loses this year,
who are the Republicans

00:07:57.743 --> 00:07:59.678
gonna run in 2024?

00:07:59.678 --> 00:08:01.781
A racist beanbag chair
that brags about how many women

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:03.182
have sat on him?

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:05.350
"Folks, I've seen more asses
than you'd believe."

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.387
Now, pollsters suspected Trump's
initial rise in the polls

00:08:08.387 --> 00:08:11.290
was what they call a "rally
around the flag effect,"

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:13.592
in which Americans show
their support for the president

00:08:13.592 --> 00:08:14.860
in a time of crisis.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.428
And sure enough,
Trump's poll numbers

00:08:16.428 --> 00:08:18.497
have already begun to
fall again.

00:08:18.497 --> 00:08:21.767
"Trump's approval rating is down
significantly from 49% in March,

00:08:21.767 --> 00:08:25.337
while his disapproval rating
is up 9% from 45%.

00:08:25.337 --> 00:08:27.339
Trump had the shortest rally
around the flag event

00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:29.208
in modern
presidential history."

00:08:29.208 --> 00:08:31.476
Which is surprising for a guy
who knows a thing or two

00:08:31.476 --> 00:08:33.212
about rallying around the flag.

00:08:33.212 --> 00:08:35.748
I mean, my God, these two look
like they just met in person

00:08:35.748 --> 00:08:37.550
for the first time
on "Love is Blind,"

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:40.219
and you can tell immediately
from the flag's reaction

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:42.021
she is not into it.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:44.823
This is a classic
Jessica-Mark situation.

00:08:44.823 --> 00:08:47.660
And yes, I did watch all of
"Love is Blind" in two days.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.595
And I have said it before,
but when this is all over

00:08:49.595 --> 00:08:52.064
and we all have a lot
less on our plates,

00:08:52.064 --> 00:08:55.401
we need to talk about Jessica.

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:56.902
Anyway, the point is this --

00:08:56.902 --> 00:08:59.038
it can be maddening
in a crisis like this

00:08:59.038 --> 00:09:00.839
to see Trump up at that podium
every day

00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:04.209
yelling at reporters and telling
people, you know, to huff Lysol,

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:06.812
or Mitch McConnell doling out
tax breaks to big corporations

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.914
while decrying so-called
blue state bailouts.

00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:11.583
Or small groups of unhinged
right wing protesters

00:09:11.583 --> 00:09:13.586
screaming at nurses funded by
conservative groups

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:15.086
and cheered on by Fox News.

00:09:15.086 --> 00:09:17.389
But just remember that these
people have always been

00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:19.891
and continue to be
massively unpopular.

00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:21.494
Just take the protesters.

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:23.829
Polls show Americans
overwhelmingly support

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:26.598
the social distancing measures
used to fight coronavirus.

00:09:26.598 --> 00:09:28.868
You just don't see them on TV,

00:09:28.868 --> 00:09:30.703
because they're in their houses.

00:09:30.703 --> 00:09:34.039
And nobody can see your signs
when you're in your houses.

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:35.674
So Trump's numbers are already
falling again

00:09:35.674 --> 00:09:37.810
even as other world leaders
facing similar crises

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:40.646
have won praise
for their responses.

00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:43.149
Just take New Zealand's
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern,

00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:45.650
whose handling has won more than
80% approval,

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:47.119
well above any leader

00:09:47.119 --> 00:09:49.054
in the Group of Seven
wealthy democracies.

00:09:49.054 --> 00:09:50.623
80%?

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:52.691
The only way Donald Trump could
ever get an 80% approval rating

00:09:52.691 --> 00:09:54.159
is from himself.

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:55.861
Like over the weekend
when he tweeted,

00:09:55.861 --> 00:09:58.163
"Remember, the Cure can't be
worse than the problem itself.

00:09:58.163 --> 00:10:00.799
Be careful, be safe,
use common sense!"

00:10:00.799 --> 00:10:03.235
And then one of his other
personalities replied

00:10:03.235 --> 00:10:05.570
to that tweet and said,
"So true!"

00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:08.173
He's just fully talking
to himself now.

00:10:08.173 --> 00:10:11.043
Please, Fauci, Birx,
just give him an unplugged mic,

00:10:11.043 --> 00:10:12.411
sit him down
in front of a mirror,

00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:13.946
and he'll be perfectly happy.

00:10:13.946 --> 00:10:16.449
"This guy, this guy giving this
speech is making a lot of sense.

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:18.049
I hope he's not being sarcastic.

00:10:18.049 --> 00:10:19.718
I like what he's saying."

00:10:19.718 --> 00:10:22.020
In fact, if he sits on the lawn
and holds the mirror

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.623
under his chin, he could even
cure himself with some...

00:10:24.623 --> 00:10:26.525
-Light and heat.

00:10:26.525 --> 00:10:29.428
-So New Zealand has effectively
contained the outbreak.

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:31.763
In fact, experts believe
New Zealand could succeed

00:10:31.763 --> 00:10:33.231
in eliminating COVID-19.

00:10:33.231 --> 00:10:34.900
So how is New Zealand doing it?

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.635
Obviously there are giant
differences

00:10:36.635 --> 00:10:38.104
between their country and ours.

00:10:38.104 --> 00:10:40.606
But for one thing, their
prime minister is a sane,

00:10:40.606 --> 00:10:42.507
normal person, which is nice.

00:10:42.507 --> 00:10:45.377
Instead of self-aggrandizing
mini rallies where she theorizes

00:10:45.377 --> 00:10:47.680
about blasting powerful lights
into your eyes like we're all

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.681
experimental patients
in "A Clockwork Orange,"

00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:51.751
she holds both
formal press conferences

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:54.953
and also more informal
Facebook Live chats

00:10:54.953 --> 00:10:57.022
where she updates residents
on the country's

00:10:57.022 --> 00:10:58.624
strict lockdown measures.

00:10:58.624 --> 00:11:01.026
-And I thought that I would
jump online very quickly

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:03.695
and just give another summary.

00:11:03.695 --> 00:11:07.766
Perhaps a shorter one than the
one that we did at 1:00 today,

00:11:07.766 --> 00:11:11.971
announcing what the rest
of the alert level framework

00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:13.238
looks like.

00:11:13.238 --> 00:11:14.840
You'll be pleased to know

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.975
that we do consider
both the Tooth Fairy

00:11:16.975 --> 00:11:20.179
and the Easter Bunny to be
essential workers.

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.314
But as you can imagine
at this time,

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:24.282
of course they're
going to be potentially

00:11:24.282 --> 00:11:27.085
quite busy at home
with their family as well

00:11:27.085 --> 00:11:28.487
and their own bunnies.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:30.956
And so I say to the children
of New Zealand,

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:34.093
if the Easter Bunny doesn't
make it to your household,

00:11:34.093 --> 00:11:37.296
then we have to understand
that it's a bit difficult

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:39.965
at the moment for the
Bunny to perhaps get everywhere.

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:42.567
-I mean, can you imagine
Donald Trump addressing

00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:44.536
the nation's children
on the status of Tooth Fairy

00:11:44.536 --> 00:11:45.971
or the Easter Bunny?

00:11:45.971 --> 00:11:47.873
For one thing, every time they
appear in public together,

00:11:47.873 --> 00:11:50.676
Trump rambles so much
even the Easter Bunny looks like

00:11:50.676 --> 00:11:52.878
he wants to mainline Clorox
into his veins.

00:11:52.878 --> 00:11:55.414
Or maybe, I don't know,
he already did.

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:58.150
"You ready for the White House
Easter egg roll?"

00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:03.289
"Yeah, just, um --- just get me
a glass of bleach first."

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:05.791
Obviously the geographic
realities of life in New Zealand

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.359
are very different,
but there are still lessons

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:09.094
we can learn from how
they and other countries

00:12:09.094 --> 00:12:11.730
have successful dealt
with this crisis

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.633
and begun to slowly reopen
their economies in a safe way.

00:12:14.633 --> 00:12:16.835
And some states are trying
to learn lessons

00:12:16.835 --> 00:12:18.236
from other countries.

00:12:18.236 --> 00:12:20.706
Like Germany, which has begun
opening some businesses,

00:12:20.706 --> 00:12:23.241
like book shops
and auto dealerships.

00:12:23.241 --> 00:12:26.811
Germany is employing a technique
known as contact tracing,

00:12:26.811 --> 00:12:28.914
which we desperately need here.

00:12:28.914 --> 00:12:31.383
And New Jersey's health
commissioner said this weekend

00:12:31.383 --> 00:12:33.952
that she has spoken with
Germany's health minister

00:12:33.952 --> 00:12:37.055
about the steps they'd taken
to implement that program

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:38.423
and reopen the economy.

00:12:38.423 --> 00:12:41.861
-He emphasized the importance
of robust testing

00:12:41.861 --> 00:12:44.696
to help to quickly
identify new cases

00:12:44.696 --> 00:12:46.532
as well as their contacts

00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:49.667
so they can be isolated
immediately.

00:12:49.667 --> 00:12:53.638
They are being very aggressive
in their contact tracing,

00:12:53.638 --> 00:12:55.708
using a team of 5 officers

00:12:55.708 --> 00:12:59.711
for every 20,000 members
of the community

00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:03.215
to trace people who
have come into recent contact

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:06.384
with every confirmed case.

00:13:06.384 --> 00:13:09.321
Their experience
can inform our efforts

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:10.655
as we look ahead

00:13:10.655 --> 00:13:13.091
to ease some of our
social distancing restrictions

00:13:13.091 --> 00:13:16.962
in the state and increase
our testing capacity.

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:18.964
-First of all, that is
valuable information.

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:21.599
And it's crazy that individual
states have to get it themselves

00:13:21.599 --> 00:13:23.903
instead of, you know,
the federal government.

00:13:23.903 --> 00:13:26.505
Second, I think the best thing
about that to me

00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:29.074
is imagining describing
what New Jersey is like

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.576
to a German.

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:32.244
[ German accent ]
"So you identify yourself

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:33.846
not by the town you live in,

00:13:33.846 --> 00:13:36.081
but by the exit you're from?

00:13:36.081 --> 00:13:38.249
And this man,
you call him The Boss

00:13:38.249 --> 00:13:41.119
even though he is not yet
your direct supervisor?

00:13:41.119 --> 00:13:43.355
And is it not difficult
to travel

00:13:43.355 --> 00:13:45.657
when your highways are jammed
with broken heroes

00:13:45.657 --> 00:13:47.860
on a last-chance power drive?"

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.128
And yet not only are we failing
to adopt those techniques

00:13:50.128 --> 00:13:52.931
nationwide, Trump's sycophants
are actually mocking the idea

00:13:52.931 --> 00:13:54.399
of contact tracing.

00:13:54.399 --> 00:13:57.002
Last week the president's
chinless gargoyle Rudy Giuliani

00:13:57.002 --> 00:13:59.271
went on Fox host
Laura Ingraham's show,

00:13:59.271 --> 00:14:01.507
where the two laughed about
how ridiculous it was

00:14:01.507 --> 00:14:05.043
for New York City to implement
contact tracing for coronavirus.

00:14:05.043 --> 00:14:07.412
-Michael Bloomberg is going to
handle the tracing,

00:14:07.412 --> 00:14:09.648
army of tracers in New York,
we learned today from Cuomo.

00:14:09.648 --> 00:14:11.082
-Well, that's totally
ridiculous.

00:14:11.082 --> 00:14:13.151
-Yeah, I know, army of tracers.

00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:15.420
-Then we should trace
everybody for cancer.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:16.922
-Yeah, army of tracers.

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:20.058
-We should trace everybody
for cancer and heart disease,

00:14:20.058 --> 00:14:23.195
and uh, and obesity and --

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:28.100
I mean, a lot of things kill you
more than COVID-19.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.334
-Well --
-So we should be traced

00:14:29.334 --> 00:14:30.969
for all those things.

00:14:30.969 --> 00:14:33.471
-Yeah, man, I hate when someone
sneezes on me

00:14:33.471 --> 00:14:35.307
and I catch heart disease.

00:14:35.307 --> 00:14:37.042
You know what else
we should trace? Brain worms.

00:14:37.042 --> 00:14:39.644
Because I'm pretty sure you guys
are spreading them around.

00:14:39.644 --> 00:14:41.280
And by the way,
just a tip, Rudy,

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:42.714
no one's going to think
you're smart

00:14:42.714 --> 00:14:44.283
just because you
started wearing glasses.

00:14:44.283 --> 00:14:47.485
All it does is make you look
like Dr. Bunsen Honeydew

00:14:47.485 --> 00:14:49.020
went on a meth bender.

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:50.856
Adding glasses isn't going to
suddenly make you look

00:14:50.856 --> 00:14:52.257
like a gentleman of letters.

00:14:52.257 --> 00:14:53.592
"Well, well, well.

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:56.862
Who's that
scholarly kumquat?

00:14:56.862 --> 00:15:00.132
We could easily be learning
important lessons

00:15:00.132 --> 00:15:01.900
from other countries
and implementing techniques

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.103
like mass testing,
like contact tracing

00:15:05.103 --> 00:15:08.106
on a nationwide basis
to safely and slowly reopen

00:15:08.106 --> 00:15:09.340
parts of our country.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:10.509
Instead, the president

00:15:10.509 --> 00:15:12.311
is musing about using
disinfectants

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:14.679
and powerful lights
to clean out the lungs

00:15:14.679 --> 00:15:16.915
and having conversations
with himself on Twitter.

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:18.350
I got to be honest,
at this point

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.319
I think something might be
wrong with his...

00:15:20.319 --> 00:15:23.021
-You know what.
-This has been "A Closer Look."

00:15:23.021 --> 00:15:26.225
♪♪

00:15:26.225 --> 00:15:29.294
We've been talking about
City Harvest on our show,

00:15:29.294 --> 00:15:30.863
and they've asked us
to thank you

00:15:30.863 --> 00:15:33.531
for your generous donations,
so let's keep going.

00:15:33.531 --> 00:15:35.433
With unemployment skyrocketing,

00:15:35.433 --> 00:15:37.168
they're keeping
their trucks full

00:15:37.168 --> 00:15:38.970
to feed the growing number
of New Yorkers

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:41.573
who are turning to them
to put food on their tables.
