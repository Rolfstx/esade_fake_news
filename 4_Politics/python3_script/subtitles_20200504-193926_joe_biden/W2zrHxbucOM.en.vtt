00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.476
- Thank you, and it's great to be here.

00:00:03.476 --> 00:00:07.579
I was saying earlier
that Rick happens to be

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:09.504
in the city of Hyderabad.

00:00:09.504 --> 00:00:13.671
Which is the first city in which
I preached my first sermon.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.992
I was 19 years old at that time.

00:00:16.992 --> 00:00:18.744
It was a youth preacher contest

00:00:18.744 --> 00:00:23.182
and so it happens he's in my
homeland, I'm in his homeland,

00:00:23.182 --> 00:00:26.696
and I was mentioning also that it's

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:28.908
because I got first choice,

00:00:28.908 --> 00:00:31.520
and I'll explain that to
you, what I mean by that.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.040
You know, the story is told of an Indian

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.424
who is on a flight and
happened to be sitting

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:38.360
next to Albert Einstein,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.852
and so Einstein said Tamil,
this is a long flight.

00:00:41.852 --> 00:00:44.161
Let's play a game as we are flying.

00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:47.104
He said to the Indian
young man next to him,

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:50.372
I'll ask you a question
and if you can't answer it

00:00:50.372 --> 00:00:51.993
you pay me $50.

00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:54.860
The guy said, this is
ridiculous, you're Einstein.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.845
He said, no, no, no.

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:58.023
Then you ask me a question
and if I can't answer it

00:00:58.023 --> 00:00:59.523
I'll pay you $500.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.464
So it's a 10 to one ratio.

00:01:02.464 --> 00:01:04.428
So the Indian figured
out he could probably ask

00:01:04.428 --> 00:01:07.520
at least one question that
Einstein couldn't answer

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.868
so the game began.

00:01:08.868 --> 00:01:11.538
So he said to Albert
Einstein, you go first.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:15.705
So Einstein says to him, how
far is the moon from the Earth?

00:01:16.968 --> 00:01:18.499
And the Indian said, you know what

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:20.720
we're a land of engineers and scientists,

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.548
I should know the answer to that,

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:26.508
but I can't give you the exact
answer, so here's $50 to you.

00:01:26.508 --> 00:01:29.072
So Einstein said, now it's your turn.

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:30.664
So the Indian said to Einstein,

00:01:30.664 --> 00:01:32.420
what goes up the mountain with three legs,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.639
and comes down with four legs?

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:36.800
And Einstein start to scratch his head,

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.209
do all the algorithms
that he could think of,

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:41.372
and finally he said, you know what,

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:44.489
I don't know the answer,
here's $500 for you.

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:45.980
So he looked at the Indian and said,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.292
before I ask you my next
question, what is the answer?

00:01:49.292 --> 00:01:51.272
What does go up the
mountain with three legs

00:01:51.272 --> 00:01:52.908
and come down with four legs?

00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:56.508
And the Indian went in his
pocket and he gave him $50.

00:01:56.508 --> 00:01:58.758
(laughing)

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:05.224
And so Rick, whatever you do,

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:07.825
don't get into a Q and A time in India,

00:02:07.825 --> 00:02:10.046
because you may come back with your wallet

00:02:10.046 --> 00:02:12.640
a little lighter than when you left.

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.010
It's one of those countries where they can

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.190
wear you out with
exhaustion with question,

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.856
after question, after question.

00:02:19.856 --> 00:02:21.570
We're a questioning culture.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.198
Years ago I was flying
in from Thailand, Bangkok

00:02:25.198 --> 00:02:29.426
to New York, New Jersey, and
it's an exhausting flight.

00:02:29.426 --> 00:02:32.561
Those long long 14 hour stretches.

00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:34.327
You're just one out.

00:02:34.327 --> 00:02:37.615
So I got off the plane and
was heading to the gate

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.385
where I was to catch my
connecting flight to Atlanta,

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:43.205
and as I went to the
gate, I saw a lady sitting

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:44.038
in the corner.

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:46.395
I looked at the marque
and the marque showed

00:02:46.395 --> 00:02:49.607
a different city to what
I was heading to, Atlanta.

00:02:49.607 --> 00:02:52.335
So I said, "Mam, is this going to Atlanta,

00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:54.903
"or is this going to where
the marque says it is?"

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:56.655
She said, "Oh it is going to Atlanta."

00:02:56.655 --> 00:02:58.040
I said, "That's good."

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.751
So I went over to get a cup of coffee,

00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:01.924
and I heard the patter of feet behind me,

00:03:01.924 --> 00:03:03.563
and a tap on the shoulder.

00:03:03.563 --> 00:03:06.870
She said, "Excuse me,
are you Ravi Zacharias?"

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.815
I said, "Yeah, I'm Ravi Zacharias."

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:13.775
She said, "That is amazing,
absolutely amazing.

00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:17.183
"I didn't know you had questions as well."

00:03:17.183 --> 00:03:19.433
(laughing)

00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:24.724
You know I can't even
make up such a story.

00:03:24.724 --> 00:03:27.155
I thought to myself, do they really think

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:28.956
you don't have questions?

00:03:28.956 --> 00:03:32.151
From the time you tottle
around you have question,

00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:34.343
after question, after question.

00:03:34.343 --> 00:03:37.162
I have four grandchildren,
the oldest is five.

00:03:37.162 --> 00:03:41.199
I am amazed at the questions
he actually does ask.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.383
One day we're sitting around the table

00:03:43.383 --> 00:03:45.667
and he was just staring
at me and then he says,

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:49.167
"Papa, what is the meaning of sophomoric?"

00:03:51.535 --> 00:03:55.135
Boy's five, well he was
actually much younger than that,

00:03:55.135 --> 00:03:58.611
and I sounded sophomoric
trying to give him a definition

00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:01.116
of what sophomoric is all about,

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:05.515
and they get deeper, and deeper,
and deeper into questions.

00:04:05.515 --> 00:04:08.932
The amazing thing in our time is not just

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:13.979
that we ask questions,
but we have no answers

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:17.669
for even the most basic questions of life.

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:19.800
All of our definitions have gone.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.150
We no longer know how to define

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.091
the most basic issues of life.

00:04:25.091 --> 00:04:27.295
I'll ask an average university student,

00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:29.795
what does it mean to be human?

00:04:31.587 --> 00:04:35.201
Chances are you will get a
dramatically different answer

00:04:35.201 --> 00:04:37.603
depending on which school you're at

00:04:37.603 --> 00:04:39.731
or which student is
answering the question.

00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:42.087
The story is told of these two Aussie's

00:04:42.087 --> 00:04:43.961
who had just gotten off a boat

00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:47.771
and had wanted to go out to
one of the pubs in London,

00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:50.007
and they went into that
pub, drank themselves with

00:04:50.007 --> 00:04:53.275
liquid refreshment into the
early hours of the morning,

00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:56.740
and as they came out into
the dense London fog,

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.778
they're wobbling on their feet,

00:04:58.778 --> 00:05:00.987
and they see a man coming
in, unknown to them,

00:05:00.987 --> 00:05:04.047
he's a highly decorated
English naval officer,

00:05:04.047 --> 00:05:06.174
and so one of them looks at him and says,

00:05:06.174 --> 00:05:10.255
"Saya mate, can you tell us where we are?"

00:05:10.255 --> 00:05:12.343
And the officer, rather offended,

00:05:12.343 --> 00:05:15.670
pointed at his metals and said,
"Do you men know who I am?"

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.815
At which point one
Aussie said to the other,

00:05:17.815 --> 00:05:19.627
"We are really in trouble now.

00:05:19.627 --> 00:05:23.203
"We don't know where we are
and he doesn't know who he is."

00:05:23.203 --> 00:05:25.453
(laughing)

00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:32.006
It's a fact, we really
don't know who we are.

00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:34.151
I just finished writing
a book, coauthored it

00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:36.307
with my colleague Vince Vitally.

00:05:36.307 --> 00:05:40.311
My chapters are dealing with
humanism, and relativism,

00:05:40.311 --> 00:05:43.667
and all these other isms that
Evee Hill would have said

00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:45.107
should be wasims.

00:05:45.107 --> 00:05:48.723
We're dealing with those
isms and I just went across

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:53.087
the huge amount of literature
in humanistic philosophies,

00:05:53.087 --> 00:05:57.254
and I marveled at how the
very definitions have changed.

00:05:58.351 --> 00:06:00.991
You go back across time
from the Renaissance

00:06:00.991 --> 00:06:03.317
right now to the post modern definition

00:06:03.317 --> 00:06:05.119
of what it means to be human,

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:08.447
and you will see how they've
gone down that vortex.

00:06:08.447 --> 00:06:11.839
They've been sucked into
the absence of definitions.

00:06:11.839 --> 00:06:16.167
In fact about the biggest insult
you pay an average humanist

00:06:16.167 --> 00:06:20.349
is to ask him or her to
really define what humanism

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:21.811
is all about.

00:06:21.811 --> 00:06:26.447
We struggle with these
definitions for one simple reason.

00:06:26.447 --> 00:06:30.423
When we were in the
earliest days of the dawn

00:06:30.423 --> 00:06:34.771
of the created order, there
was only one restriction.

00:06:34.771 --> 00:06:37.171
Only one restriction.

00:06:37.171 --> 00:06:40.903
With all the possibilities,
one restriction.

00:06:40.903 --> 00:06:45.070
Not to eat of the tree of the
knowledge of good and evil.

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:47.249
What does that mean?

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:48.582
Do not play God.

00:06:51.287 --> 00:06:52.537
Don't play God.

00:06:53.911 --> 00:06:58.907
Don't be the self referencing
point of all absolutes

00:06:58.907 --> 00:07:03.499
and all definitions, and the
temptation was pretty to fold

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:04.622
wasn't it?

00:07:04.622 --> 00:07:06.903
God said to them, in
the day that you choose

00:07:06.903 --> 00:07:10.078
to play this role, you will die.

00:07:10.078 --> 00:07:12.856
You will actually demean yourself.

00:07:12.856 --> 00:07:17.023
You will self destruct, but
the tempest said no, no, no.

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:21.538
In the day you do this,
you will be as God,

00:07:21.538 --> 00:07:23.716
knowing good and evil.

00:07:23.716 --> 00:07:28.112
Meaning, you become the
definer of absolutes.

00:07:28.112 --> 00:07:32.520
Take a look at our world today
and see what has happened

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.132
in the defining of absolutes.

00:07:35.132 --> 00:07:38.880
We are living in America,
possibly on the hinge

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.534
on some of the darkest
days we've ever seen.

00:07:41.534 --> 00:07:45.524
Suddenly the most unpredictable
days we've ever seen.

00:07:45.524 --> 00:07:49.244
All over the world that I
go, I'm asked the question,

00:07:49.244 --> 00:07:51.812
what is happening in the United States?

00:07:51.812 --> 00:07:54.524
I was in Moscow, Russia in June,

00:07:54.524 --> 00:07:57.118
and a business man asked
me out for breakfast

00:07:57.118 --> 00:08:00.317
and at the end of the breakfast
he got up and said this.

00:08:00.317 --> 00:08:04.473
"I always had hope that
the future of the world

00:08:04.473 --> 00:08:07.097
"would hang on the wisdom and the ability

00:08:07.097 --> 00:08:08.862
"of the American people."

00:08:08.862 --> 00:08:11.070
He said, "That was my only hope."

00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:13.233
He said, "I no longer have that hope."

00:08:13.233 --> 00:08:14.657
And here's what he said.

00:08:14.657 --> 00:08:18.074
"They don't think rightly there anymore."

00:08:19.377 --> 00:08:20.905
This is a Russian man telling me.

00:08:20.905 --> 00:08:22.249
So what has happened?

00:08:22.249 --> 00:08:26.929
How do we in this pluralistic
culture do apologetics?

00:08:26.929 --> 00:08:29.158
What is apologetics?

00:08:29.158 --> 00:08:32.417
Apologetics is that
discipline which comes from

00:08:32.417 --> 00:08:34.609
the Greek word apologia.

00:08:34.609 --> 00:08:37.421
Which literally means to give an answer.

00:08:37.421 --> 00:08:40.465
To give an answer to
the questions of people,

00:08:40.465 --> 00:08:43.421
but it has that twin responsibility

00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:47.705
of making truth claims
clear and giving answers

00:08:47.705 --> 00:08:50.081
to the questions that people ask.

00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:52.061
The apostle Peter says,

00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:56.037
"But to set apart Christ
in your heart as lord,

00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:58.825
"and always be prepared to give an answer

00:08:58.825 --> 00:09:02.697
"to anyone who asks of you
the reason for the hope

00:09:02.697 --> 00:09:04.989
"that is within you, and to do that

00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:06.969
"with gentleness and respect."

00:09:06.969 --> 00:09:10.016
I cannot think of a more
beautiful definition

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:14.198
of what apologetics is, and
this came from a fisherman

00:09:14.198 --> 00:09:18.302
who had also seen that
extraordinary disclosure

00:09:18.302 --> 00:09:21.122
in the transfiguration of the lord Jesus.

00:09:21.122 --> 00:09:25.289
Such a spectacular event,
vouchsafed to only a hand few.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:29.746
So spectacular was it
that he said to his lord,

00:09:29.746 --> 00:09:31.441
Let's stay right here.

00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:33.616
I don't wanna go down there again.

00:09:33.616 --> 00:09:37.158
But the lord told him that
they had work to be done,

00:09:37.158 --> 00:09:41.155
and took them back into
the mainstream of people.

00:09:41.155 --> 00:09:45.474
You and I would love to be
in that cloistered existence

00:09:45.474 --> 00:09:47.980
of a spectacular revelation,

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.740
but this is our time in history.

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:54.845
Regardless how bleak it may
seem, how dark it may seem.

00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:58.104
My colleague and I were talking
about this earlier today,

00:09:58.104 --> 00:09:59.648
and I made the comment to him.

00:09:59.648 --> 00:10:02.740
I said, "You know, this
is the most open time

00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:05.393
"that I have ever sensed, but it is also

00:10:05.393 --> 00:10:09.144
"the most difficult time
at which to give clear

00:10:09.144 --> 00:10:11.380
"and convincing answers."

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:16.257
The struggles we have began
about 40 to 50 years ago,

00:10:16.257 --> 00:10:19.033
and a Canadian writer said this.

00:10:19.033 --> 00:10:22.420
"In the 1950s, kids lost their innocence.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.460
"They were liberated from their parents

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:27.684
"be whelping jobs, cars,
and lyrics, and music

00:10:27.684 --> 00:10:31.060
"that gave rise to a new
term. the generation gap.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.376
"In the 1960s, kids lost their authority.

00:10:34.376 --> 00:10:37.720
"it was the decade of
protest, church, state,

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.196
"and parents were all called into question

00:10:40.196 --> 00:10:41.453
"and found wanting.

00:10:41.453 --> 00:10:45.220
"their authority was rejected,
yet nothing ever replaced it.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.160
"In the 1970s, kids lost their love.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.434
"it was the decade of Mesum,
dominated by hyphenated words

00:10:52.434 --> 00:10:53.844
"beginning with self.

00:10:53.844 --> 00:10:56.768
"Self-image, self-esteem, self-assertion.

00:10:56.768 --> 00:10:59.184
"It made for a very lonely world.

00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:02.045
"Kids learned everything
there was to know about sex.

00:11:02.045 --> 00:11:04.884
"Forgot everything there
was to know about true love,

00:11:04.884 --> 00:11:06.744
"and few had the verve to tell them

00:11:06.744 --> 00:11:09.024
"that there was indeed a difference.

00:11:09.024 --> 00:11:11.500
"In the 1980s kids lost their hope.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:14.287
"Stripped of innocence,
authority, and love,

00:11:14.287 --> 00:11:17.124
"and plagued by the horror
of a nuclear nightmare.

00:11:17.124 --> 00:11:20.184
"Large and growing
numbers of this generation

00:11:20.184 --> 00:11:22.764
"have stopped believing in the future."

00:11:22.764 --> 00:11:24.608
I put this as a post script.

00:11:24.608 --> 00:11:28.676
In the 1990s, kids have
lost their power to reason.

00:11:28.676 --> 00:11:31.556
Lost in a world of cyberspace,

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:34.224
they have now personalized objects

00:11:34.224 --> 00:11:37.375
and totally subjectivized reality,

00:11:37.375 --> 00:11:40.958
and they are now
imprisoned in a deep world

00:11:42.744 --> 00:11:44.744
of their own loneliness.

00:11:45.744 --> 00:11:49.911
Having personalized objects,
and subjectivized reality,

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:53.588
they look deep inside of them.

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:55.921
They really have no answers.

00:11:57.068 --> 00:12:01.235
They only sense that sense
of isolation or alienation.

00:12:02.844 --> 00:12:05.244
Earlier in the year I had
the privilege of speaking

00:12:05.244 --> 00:12:06.880
at the passion conference.

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:11.047
About 40,000 young people
listening live to that session,

00:12:12.008 --> 00:12:16.268
and after just a number
of powerful speakers

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:19.196
the two most important issues for which

00:12:19.196 --> 00:12:21.324
they came forward for counseling.

00:12:21.324 --> 00:12:23.036
These are university students.

00:12:23.036 --> 00:12:25.507
If nobody had told you, you'd never guess.

00:12:25.507 --> 00:12:27.896
Number one problem plaguing the young

00:12:27.896 --> 00:12:32.576
that came forward for
counseling was on pornography.

00:12:32.576 --> 00:12:35.168
Number two was in suicide.

00:12:35.168 --> 00:12:37.774
The first demeaned the other.

00:12:37.774 --> 00:12:41.336
They ultimately demeaned themselves,

00:12:41.336 --> 00:12:45.008
and as I hear their voices
and hear their struggle,

00:12:45.008 --> 00:12:48.624
we are living in a world
of billions of people

00:12:48.624 --> 00:12:52.660
with each on in their
solitary world of struggle

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:53.904
and questions.

00:12:53.904 --> 00:12:56.980
You and I believe, if you're
a follower of Jesus Christ,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:13:00.400
that in Jesus alone we have the answers

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.976
that are correspondingly
true to every question raised

00:13:04.976 --> 00:13:08.498
and coherent when all of the
answers are given together.

00:13:08.498 --> 00:13:10.556
Correspondence and coherence.

00:13:10.556 --> 00:13:14.108
The two tests for truth,
and in the person of Christ

00:13:14.108 --> 00:13:18.039
we find those answers to
the four deepest questions

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:19.962
that bridge the head to the heart.

00:13:19.962 --> 00:13:21.536
What are those questions?

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:23.665
The question of origin,
the question of meaning,

00:13:23.665 --> 00:13:26.096
the question of morality,
and the question of destiny.

00:13:26.096 --> 00:13:28.164
That forms your world view.

00:13:28.164 --> 00:13:31.360
Origin, meaning, morality, and destiny,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.280
and if you put it all together,

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.684
you walk on the two feet
of truth and relevance.

00:13:36.684 --> 00:13:40.584
What is true in the answers you hold to,

00:13:40.584 --> 00:13:44.440
and what is relevant in the
way those answers are given?

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.080
And so when Rick so graciously spoke to me

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:50.276
about coming and speaking at
this Ahmanson Lecture Series

00:13:50.276 --> 00:13:53.695
on apologetics, and to
bring to you this message.

00:13:53.695 --> 00:13:55.580
I've selected as my title,

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.773
doing apologetics in the 21st century.

00:13:58.773 --> 00:14:01.816
Doing apologetics in the 21st century.

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:04.216
Which means how do we give answers

00:14:04.216 --> 00:14:08.670
and what are the real struggles
that people are facing

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:09.960
in their lives.

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.778
I bring to you, there are
many ideas I can go through

00:14:13.778 --> 00:14:15.111
in the first part of it.

00:14:15.111 --> 00:14:17.406
I'll just break it down to three.

00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:21.606
Number one is the popularization
of the death of God,

00:14:21.606 --> 00:14:26.498
and the strident willingness
to live with its ramifications.

00:14:26.498 --> 00:14:28.946
The popularization of the death of God

00:14:28.946 --> 00:14:33.488
and the stridency of willing
to live with its ramifications.

00:14:33.488 --> 00:14:34.766
What do I mean by that?

00:14:34.766 --> 00:14:36.506
Let me unpack that for you.

00:14:36.506 --> 00:14:39.410
The German philosopher Fredrick Nietzsche

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:41.238
who's father was a pastor

00:14:41.238 --> 00:14:44.223
and both of his grandfathers
were in the ministry.

00:14:44.223 --> 00:14:48.830
He's the one who really
popularized the phrase God is dead.

00:14:48.830 --> 00:14:53.495
He was a brilliant seminal
thinker, creative thinker,

00:14:53.495 --> 00:14:57.078
but he came to the
philosophical conclusion

00:14:57.078 --> 00:15:00.410
that God had philosophically bled to death

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:04.070
under the knives of the
scrutinizing thinker.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:05.958
He used that metaphor.

00:15:05.958 --> 00:15:10.174
Who will wipe this blood from
the knife that has bled him?

00:15:10.174 --> 00:15:12.738
Who will wipe away the horizon?

00:15:12.738 --> 00:15:16.086
Who will give us the power
to wipe away the horizon?

00:15:16.086 --> 00:15:20.690
"Will lanterns have to be lit
in the morning hours" he said.

00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:23.838
Is there any up or down left?

00:15:23.838 --> 00:15:27.378
How do we not strain
through an infinite nothing?

00:15:27.378 --> 00:15:30.295
You see the questions he's raising?

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:34.278
Is there any up or down left?

00:15:34.278 --> 00:15:36.710
Take a look at the political scene today

00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:38.611
and ask yourself the question.

00:15:38.611 --> 00:15:43.277
How often we hear of the
two poles of right and left.

00:15:43.277 --> 00:15:46.444
You never hear of the up and the down.

00:15:49.146 --> 00:15:51.766
And yet that's precisely
what's Solomon said

00:15:51.766 --> 00:15:53.099
3,000 years ago.

00:15:54.066 --> 00:15:58.936
Everything is a chasing
after the wind under the sun.

00:15:58.936 --> 00:16:00.889
What he really meant was if you don't get

00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:02.886
a transcendent perspective,

00:16:02.886 --> 00:16:06.050
if you don't have that vertical
dimension to your life,

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:09.315
at the end of it you'll
find it was all a chasing

00:16:09.315 --> 00:16:10.578
after the wind.

00:16:10.578 --> 00:16:14.406
Everything became
meaningless under the sun

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:17.659
locked in the three school years in time,

00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:21.170
but now we have the
stridency of willing to live

00:16:21.170 --> 00:16:23.298
with these ramifications.

00:16:23.298 --> 00:16:25.833
Take a look at the writings of our ethesis

00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:27.606
in our universities,

00:16:27.606 --> 00:16:31.626
and see what it is that we are
really willing to live with

00:16:31.626 --> 00:16:33.078
in our time.

00:16:33.078 --> 00:16:35.175
I just wanna give you two illustrations.

00:16:35.175 --> 00:16:36.646
You see Nietzsche said this.

00:16:36.646 --> 00:16:39.546
He said, "Because God has
died in the 19th century,

00:16:39.546 --> 00:16:41.974
"two things will happen
in the 20th century."

00:16:41.974 --> 00:16:43.398
He was right on both of them.

00:16:43.398 --> 00:16:45.654
He said number one,
the 20th century become

00:16:45.654 --> 00:16:47.558
the bloodiest century in history,

00:16:47.558 --> 00:16:50.154
and number two, universal
madness will break out.

00:16:50.154 --> 00:16:51.096
He was right.

00:16:51.096 --> 00:16:54.010
In the 20th century in
warfare we killed more people

00:16:54.010 --> 00:16:57.098
than the previous 19
centuries put together.

00:16:57.098 --> 00:17:00.578
See, violence has become absolute.

00:17:00.578 --> 00:17:04.520
It is the absolute solution
to everything we do now.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.230
He took the first step himself

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:10.211
in the last 13 years of
his life he spend insane.

00:17:10.211 --> 00:17:13.026
Swinging between moments of clarity

00:17:13.026 --> 00:17:15.338
and the moment of total obscurity.

00:17:15.338 --> 00:17:17.862
You know, I am a world traveler

00:17:17.862 --> 00:17:20.779
by God's divine courtesy and grace.

00:17:22.354 --> 00:17:24.830
I never ever dreamed that
this would be my life

00:17:24.830 --> 00:17:27.066
when I got into the itinerant call.

00:17:27.066 --> 00:17:30.758
I was speaking to my
summer friends last week

00:17:30.758 --> 00:17:32.509
and in Colorado Springs and I said,

00:17:32.509 --> 00:17:36.149
As this year is coming
to an end, just 2016,

00:17:36.149 --> 00:17:39.473
I have been to 26 countries and 76 cities

00:17:39.473 --> 00:17:42.713
just in the last 10 or 11 months.

00:17:42.713 --> 00:17:46.659
It's my life, and one of
the things I really morn,

00:17:46.659 --> 00:17:50.305
I really morn, I don't make it up.

00:17:50.305 --> 00:17:52.869
I lie in bed sometimes
and I think about it.

00:17:52.869 --> 00:17:55.369
What we've done to this world.

00:17:56.365 --> 00:17:59.270
One of my favorite countries
in the world was Syria.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:01.313
I've been there many many times.

00:18:01.313 --> 00:18:05.721
The oldest inhabited cities
in the world, Damascus.

00:18:05.721 --> 00:18:08.815
It was of the wall of
Damascus that Saul of Tarsus

00:18:08.815 --> 00:18:10.569
was put into a basket and lowered.

00:18:10.569 --> 00:18:13.176
Nobody knew that right
then he was gonna write

00:18:13.176 --> 00:18:15.505
one third of the new testament

00:18:15.505 --> 00:18:18.876
on that Damascus road, that
tremendous transformation

00:18:18.876 --> 00:18:22.758
that took place in the
house of Ananias out there.

00:18:22.758 --> 00:18:25.760
About five, six years ago I was Damascus,

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.268
and every time I arrived,
the chief of intelligence

00:18:28.268 --> 00:18:29.992
would always have me go to the office

00:18:29.992 --> 00:18:32.588
and to be flanked by the military brass,

00:18:32.588 --> 00:18:34.792
and they put me on the
other side of the table.

00:18:34.792 --> 00:18:37.088
They put some baklavas
and coffee in front of you

00:18:37.088 --> 00:18:39.052
and none of it you feel
like eating or drinking

00:18:39.052 --> 00:18:41.407
because of the hostile looks,

00:18:41.407 --> 00:18:43.312
and then he looked at me he said,

00:18:43.312 --> 00:18:45.395
"Mr. Zacharias, you know,

00:18:46.688 --> 00:18:49.865
"you're always welcome in our
country, thank you for coming,

00:18:49.865 --> 00:18:52.953
"but don't get involved in
the politics of this land."

00:18:52.953 --> 00:18:56.080
I said, "You have my
word sir, I never will."

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.820
I said, "But I have a question for you,

00:18:57.820 --> 00:18:59.812
"I know you well enough now.

00:18:59.812 --> 00:19:04.523
"Tell me, what is the future
of this part of the world?"

00:19:04.523 --> 00:19:07.524
This was before ISIS, we
knew of anything of ISIS,

00:19:07.524 --> 00:19:09.743
or at least certainly I
didn't know anything of ISIS

00:19:09.743 --> 00:19:10.792
at that time.

00:19:10.792 --> 00:19:13.028
He looked at me and he said,
"You really wanna know?"

00:19:13.028 --> 00:19:14.048
I said, "Yes."

00:19:14.048 --> 00:19:16.565
He said, "If nothing changes
in the next five years,

00:19:16.565 --> 00:19:19.732
"the whole place is going to blow up."

00:19:20.992 --> 00:19:24.211
I wonder if he knew he was talking about

00:19:24.211 --> 00:19:29.028
the deaths of 200 to
300,000 of their own people?

00:19:29.028 --> 00:19:32.780
He himself was assassinated
in the early days,

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.500
and I think of that beautiful city

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.656
that has held forth
for thousands of years,

00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:40.573
and we've destroyed it.

00:19:42.856 --> 00:19:45.326
We destroyed it, we wiped it out.

00:19:45.326 --> 00:19:48.326
You see, if violence is absolutized,

00:19:49.293 --> 00:19:51.710
we only find ways of hurting.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.476
We find very few ways of solving problems,

00:19:56.476 --> 00:19:59.277
and now we enter into this 21st century

00:19:59.277 --> 00:20:03.584
and the heavens knows what
really waits us for the future.

00:20:03.584 --> 00:20:07.108
A stridency of willing to
live with its ramification,

00:20:07.108 --> 00:20:10.814
but just think of our own culture here.

00:20:10.814 --> 00:20:13.800
One of the fundamental mistakes
we make in America today

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:17.467
is that we actually
think the truth matters.

00:20:18.403 --> 00:20:21.240
We think people really
worry about the truth.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:23.504
I wish that were true.

00:20:23.504 --> 00:20:27.147
If you listen to the media
and all the distortions,

00:20:27.147 --> 00:20:29.939
and all that goes on, you say to yourself,

00:20:29.939 --> 00:20:32.744
do you really want the
people to know the truth,

00:20:32.744 --> 00:20:35.716
or have you got an ideology
that you want people

00:20:35.716 --> 00:20:37.285
to latch onto?

00:20:37.285 --> 00:20:40.993
These are very difficult
time to be a student

00:20:40.993 --> 00:20:45.788
in a western university
where relativism is absolute,

00:20:45.788 --> 00:20:49.356
and where theism is
debunked, and the vertical

00:20:49.356 --> 00:20:53.496
is really mocked out of
any reasonable discussion.

00:20:53.496 --> 00:20:57.380
I haunt the university
students, university venues.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.436
I go there year after year after year.

00:20:59.436 --> 00:21:01.148
The audience is packed.

00:21:01.148 --> 00:21:02.886
There's a good side to it.

00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:05.976
I'm paining for you right
now the darkest side to it.

00:21:05.976 --> 00:21:07.838
I'll get to the positive side.

00:21:07.838 --> 00:21:10.656
So number one is the stridency of willing

00:21:10.656 --> 00:21:13.012
to life with the ramifications of atheism.

00:21:13.012 --> 00:21:17.348
Secondly, it is the gathering
storm of religious pluralism

00:21:17.348 --> 00:21:20.032
that has disoriented western culture.

00:21:20.032 --> 00:21:23.196
It's the gathering storm
of religious pluralism

00:21:23.196 --> 00:21:26.900
that has disoriented western culture.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.348
Ask yourself this question.

00:21:29.348 --> 00:21:31.817
Why are there millions in the world

00:21:31.817 --> 00:21:35.984
who will give anything in
order to make this their home?

00:21:38.253 --> 00:21:41.806
I was only 20 when the
opportunity came to me

00:21:41.806 --> 00:21:42.902
to move to Canada.

00:21:42.902 --> 00:21:44.850
My older brother was 22.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.202
My father gave us $400 each.

00:21:47.202 --> 00:21:49.094
That's all the government
of India would allow

00:21:49.094 --> 00:21:50.512
with foreign exchange,

00:21:50.512 --> 00:21:52.354
and he said, "Go and make your home there.

00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:54.202
"Settle down there and if all goes well,

00:21:54.202 --> 00:21:55.790
"we'll all come and join you."

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:59.182
We had to sit for an hour in
front of the Canadian officer

00:21:59.182 --> 00:22:00.508
interviewing us.

00:22:00.508 --> 00:22:02.130
Asking us all the tough questions.

00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:05.115
We were moving to Toronto,
Canada at that time,

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:06.513
and he looked at us and he said,

00:22:06.513 --> 00:22:10.549
"Why do you boys want to move to Canad?"

00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:14.357
And I was trying (mumbles)
philosophical in this.

00:22:14.357 --> 00:22:17.401
I thought, what answer
is gonna work out here?

00:22:17.401 --> 00:22:19.517
Today you're not even
allowed to ask this question,

00:22:19.517 --> 00:22:21.857
but that time, they could
ask those questions,

00:22:21.857 --> 00:22:23.853
and my brother was two
years older than me,

00:22:23.853 --> 00:22:26.013
stunned me when he looked
at him and he said,

00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:28.757
"Because we think in English."

00:22:28.757 --> 00:22:31.007
(laughing)

00:22:32.603 --> 00:22:35.972
I said, where did this come from?

00:22:35.972 --> 00:22:38.057
You know what my brother was saying?

00:22:38.057 --> 00:22:40.337
The value structure that you represent

00:22:40.337 --> 00:22:43.517
is the value structure
to which I wanna go.

00:22:43.517 --> 00:22:44.837
That's really what he was saying.

00:22:44.837 --> 00:22:46.729
You know, the guy looked
at both of us and said,

00:22:46.729 --> 00:22:50.521
no one has ever answered this
question for me this way.

00:22:50.521 --> 00:22:53.039
We were looking for an ethos

00:22:53.039 --> 00:22:57.206
where you gained places by
virtue of your performance

00:22:58.188 --> 00:23:01.020
and ability, not by
virtue of paying somebody

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.376
under the table and getting
it in, in the process.

00:23:03.376 --> 00:23:06.181
Which is what were so
accustomed to and so used to.

00:23:06.181 --> 00:23:09.570
Gertrude Himmelfarb who
is professor and meridus

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:12.451
at Columbia University,
and author of so many books

00:23:12.451 --> 00:23:13.789
on history and culture.

00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:17.101
One of her latest to
scroll, Roads to Modernity.

00:23:17.101 --> 00:23:20.490
She makes an incredible
statement in that book,

00:23:20.490 --> 00:23:22.921
and coming from her as a philosopher,

00:23:22.921 --> 00:23:23.754
it shocked me what she said.

00:23:23.754 --> 00:23:27.921
She said, he difference between
the renascence in Europe

00:23:29.537 --> 00:23:32.657
and in the United States
and the United Kingdom

00:23:32.657 --> 00:23:33.601
on the one side.

00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:38.217
England on the one side, Europe
on the other, is one word.

00:23:38.217 --> 00:23:40.451
She said, "For the French philosophs

00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:43.933
"and for the Europeans, rationalism,

00:23:43.933 --> 00:23:48.406
"reason was the substructure
on which everything was built."

00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:50.073
Rationalism, reason.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.062
She said, "For the
English and the Americans,

00:23:54.062 --> 00:23:57.886
"it was not reasoning,
it was moral reasoning

00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:01.183
"that gave them the impetus
to build their cultures."

00:24:01.183 --> 00:24:02.504
Imagine that.

00:24:02.504 --> 00:24:06.603
One word, not reason
alone, moral reasoning,

00:24:06.603 --> 00:24:10.007
the up and the down, and she
has a whole chapter dedicated

00:24:10.007 --> 00:24:11.257
to John Wesley.

00:24:12.555 --> 00:24:15.867
She said it was the powerful
preaching of Wesley,

00:24:15.867 --> 00:24:18.507
and Whitfield, these
men who really brought

00:24:18.507 --> 00:24:20.515
the gospel to these countries.

00:24:20.515 --> 00:24:25.180
Who gave the people here
that ethos of up and down.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.847
Not just right and left.

00:24:26.847 --> 00:24:30.103
Some time ago I was in Paris having dinner

00:24:30.103 --> 00:24:34.125
with some of the top level
people in the country.

00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:37.010
One of them was the head
of the business school.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:39.556
Probably the most prestigious
business school in Europe.

00:24:39.556 --> 00:24:41.238
My wife was sitting next to me.

00:24:41.238 --> 00:24:43.474
It was a Chinese gentlemen and his wife.

00:24:43.474 --> 00:24:45.634
Who's our dear friend, very powerful man

00:24:45.634 --> 00:24:47.886
who hosted this dinner
because he wanted me

00:24:47.886 --> 00:24:49.594
to talk to these folks,

00:24:49.594 --> 00:24:51.423
and the head of the business school said,

00:24:51.423 --> 00:24:52.637
"So you deal in ethics?"

00:24:52.637 --> 00:24:53.631
I said, "Yes."

00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:57.798
He said, "We don't teach
ethics in our business school.

00:24:58.809 --> 00:25:00.559
"It's not a subject."

00:25:01.869 --> 00:25:04.073
About half an hour later,
half way through the dinner

00:25:04.073 --> 00:25:06.049
he said, "You know we had
three of our graduates

00:25:06.049 --> 00:25:08.716
"running for the past election?"

00:25:10.374 --> 00:25:11.679
I said, "How did they do?"

00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:13.286
He said, "Well not very well.

00:25:13.286 --> 00:25:16.570
"One was a womanizer, the
other was an alcoholic,

00:25:16.570 --> 00:25:20.350
"and the third was very corrupt,
so they didn't go further."

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.118
My wife leaned over, leave it to my wife

00:25:22.118 --> 00:25:24.624
to whisper when you
have to be very careful.

00:25:24.624 --> 00:25:28.364
She said, "Maybe they need to
start teaching ethics there."

00:25:28.364 --> 00:25:30.815
(laughing)

00:25:30.815 --> 00:25:34.957
But he was talking as a French
man did philosophically.

00:25:34.957 --> 00:25:39.234
They do not have moral
reasoning of the underpinnings

00:25:39.234 --> 00:25:40.630
in the European world.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:44.635
If you take all of the isms
from marksims to existentialism,

00:25:44.635 --> 00:25:46.014
and postmodernism.

00:25:46.014 --> 00:25:48.848
All of these isms have come from Europe

00:25:48.848 --> 00:25:50.953
because of the bottom of their world view

00:25:50.953 --> 00:25:53.502
is reasoning rationalism.

00:25:53.502 --> 00:25:56.189
At the bottom of the world
view that built this country

00:25:56.189 --> 00:25:57.837
is moral reasoning.

00:25:57.837 --> 00:25:59.621
It's a world of a difference,

00:25:59.621 --> 00:26:02.610
and all of a sudden the
world views came across.

00:26:02.610 --> 00:26:04.661
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and all of them

00:26:04.661 --> 00:26:06.717
came with their transcendental meditation

00:26:06.717 --> 00:26:10.661
which wasn't very transcendental,
but they talked about it,

00:26:10.661 --> 00:26:12.613
and so what were we doing sitting in front

00:26:12.613 --> 00:26:16.174
of some teacher staring
inwards and thinking

00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:19.333
we would find the answers to life?

00:26:19.333 --> 00:26:22.317
When he passes away, his
whole empire collapsed

00:26:22.317 --> 00:26:24.057
and most of them are in a courtroom now

00:26:24.057 --> 00:26:26.369
finding out who owns all the returns.

00:26:26.369 --> 00:26:28.658
Evidently the transcendental meditation

00:26:28.658 --> 00:26:32.741
did not help them meditate on
the right things for too long.

00:26:32.741 --> 00:26:35.457
'Cause you never got to
the heart of the problem.

00:26:35.457 --> 00:26:38.995
The religious pluralism
that has come in our time.

00:26:38.995 --> 00:26:42.853
Thirdly and importantly,
how we have learned now

00:26:42.853 --> 00:26:45.701
the power to inform through the visual.

00:26:45.701 --> 00:26:50.397
We lean by the eye gate rather
than by the the thought gate.

00:26:50.397 --> 00:26:53.729
William Blake put it in
these words about the eyes.

00:26:53.729 --> 00:26:55.153
Listen carefully please.

00:26:55.153 --> 00:26:58.142
This life's dim windows of the soul

00:26:58.142 --> 00:27:01.541
distorts the heavens from pole to pole,

00:27:01.541 --> 00:27:03.957
and godes you to believe a lie

00:27:03.957 --> 00:27:06.493
when you see with and not through the eye.

00:27:06.493 --> 00:27:09.553
This life's dim windows of the soul

00:27:09.553 --> 00:27:11.729
distorts the heavens from pole to pole,

00:27:11.729 --> 00:27:13.573
and godes you to believe a lie

00:27:13.573 --> 00:27:16.093
when you see with and not through the eye.

00:27:16.093 --> 00:27:20.113
Blake was so right, we are
intended to see through the eye

00:27:20.113 --> 00:27:21.761
with the conscious.

00:27:21.761 --> 00:27:25.761
Now we see with the eye
devoid of all conscious.

00:27:27.853 --> 00:27:29.773
Life's dim windows of the soul.

00:27:29.773 --> 00:27:31.573
Distorts the heavens from pole to pole,

00:27:31.573 --> 00:27:33.269
and godes you to believe you a lie

00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:35.261
when you see with and not through the eye.

00:27:35.261 --> 00:27:39.428
Think of the thousands of
hours in which our young

00:27:40.721 --> 00:27:42.888
are learning with the eye.

00:27:46.229 --> 00:27:47.669
Not through the eye.

00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:51.370
There is no conscious to
superintend over them.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:55.017
You take complex stories
and they are given to us

00:27:55.017 --> 00:27:58.227
in 30 seconds or 45 seconds sum bites,

00:27:58.227 --> 00:28:00.793
and supposedly we are getting the news.

00:28:00.793 --> 00:28:04.481
We are really getting
more views than the news.

00:28:04.481 --> 00:28:06.357
The world has changed folks.

00:28:06.357 --> 00:28:08.548
It has changed dramatically.

00:28:08.548 --> 00:28:10.841
Yesterday I was talking to a woman

00:28:10.841 --> 00:28:13.361
who for the first time
we had made contact.

00:28:13.361 --> 00:28:16.633
She's quire high placed in
the world of technology,

00:28:16.633 --> 00:28:20.233
and she said, "Ravi, that
instrument that we hold

00:28:20.233 --> 00:28:24.629
"in our hand every morning,
every noon, and ever night."

00:28:24.629 --> 00:28:27.253
She's part of a high tech world right now

00:28:27.253 --> 00:28:29.866
working with some of the
best cinematographers

00:28:29.866 --> 00:28:31.153
in this country.

00:28:31.153 --> 00:28:36.055
She said, "That little instrument
is controlling our lives

00:28:36.055 --> 00:28:38.917
"to a degree, that
someday we will look back

00:28:38.917 --> 00:28:41.685
"and wonder how we ever did not see

00:28:41.685 --> 00:28:44.518
"what we were doing to ourselves."

00:28:46.421 --> 00:28:50.068
You wake up in the morning,
and this is the first thing.

00:28:50.068 --> 00:28:53.038
You go to bed at night,
this is the last thing,

00:28:53.038 --> 00:28:57.281
and the invasion of the
imagination when you are young

00:28:57.281 --> 00:28:59.097
is a huge assault.

00:28:59.097 --> 00:29:02.169
My daughter Naomi,
she's a wee little girl.

00:29:02.169 --> 00:29:04.837
She works in our ministry for the rescue

00:29:04.837 --> 00:29:08.257
of women in prostitution
and children with aids.

00:29:08.257 --> 00:29:10.813
She goes to the streets of Holland

00:29:10.813 --> 00:29:14.292
and the streets of South
Africa and in Mumbai.

00:29:14.292 --> 00:29:17.533
She will go in with a Bible in her purse

00:29:17.533 --> 00:29:20.574
and as she walks, and
they know who she is now,

00:29:20.574 --> 00:29:24.057
and they'll turn that light
on for about 10, 15 minutes

00:29:24.057 --> 00:29:26.953
to listen to her, and she will tell you,

00:29:26.953 --> 00:29:30.818
dad, when I see these
beautiful young girls

00:29:30.818 --> 00:29:32.755
who've been marred and scarred

00:29:32.755 --> 00:29:34.946
in the sex trafficking industry,

00:29:34.946 --> 00:29:37.073
and now with a heavy dose of makeup

00:29:37.073 --> 00:29:40.198
to cover all of their
heartache and their pain.

00:29:40.198 --> 00:29:43.753
She said, "I walk out of there
and I just weep and think,

00:29:43.753 --> 00:29:47.920
"are we really going to let
thousands in this deluge

00:29:48.989 --> 00:29:50.730
"wipe themselves out?"

00:29:50.730 --> 00:29:55.033
And she said it all starts
with the image and the pictures

00:29:55.033 --> 00:29:57.865
and for the men who come as customers,

00:29:57.865 --> 00:30:01.633
the average length of an unclad woman

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.821
that is able to hold their attention

00:30:03.821 --> 00:30:06.071
is no more than one minute,

00:30:08.189 --> 00:30:10.573
and then the picture has to change,

00:30:10.573 --> 00:30:12.417
and then the picture has to change.

00:30:12.417 --> 00:30:16.180
She said those are the
customers, this is the product.

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.761
She walks in the streets of Mumbai,

00:30:18.761 --> 00:30:21.989
and if you've seen the
movie Slumdog Millionaire,

00:30:21.989 --> 00:30:24.690
you will see exactly the very street

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.733
where my daughter Naomi
has been so involved.

00:30:27.733 --> 00:30:31.666
It's a world that's tough,
a world where you've got

00:30:31.666 --> 00:30:34.421
all of the absolutes altered.

00:30:34.421 --> 00:30:36.450
The popularization of the death of God.

00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:38.817
Gathering storm of religious pluralism

00:30:38.817 --> 00:30:41.051
and the power to inform
through the visual.

00:30:41.051 --> 00:30:44.068
How do we respond, how do we deal with it?

00:30:44.068 --> 00:30:46.480
I wanna give you full thoughts.

00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:47.833
The question is this.

00:30:47.833 --> 00:30:51.073
How do you reach a generation
that listens with its eyes

00:30:51.073 --> 00:30:53.653
and thinks with its feelings?

00:30:53.653 --> 00:30:56.713
How do you reach a generation
that listens with its eyes

00:30:56.713 --> 00:30:58.841
and thinks with its feelings?

00:30:58.841 --> 00:31:00.869
I give you four propositions.

00:31:00.869 --> 00:31:05.036
Number one, make sure you
understand what it means

00:31:06.313 --> 00:31:09.813
to set apart Christ in your heart as lord.

00:31:10.649 --> 00:31:13.557
The lordship of Christ over your will,

00:31:13.557 --> 00:31:16.361
over your imagination, over your life.

00:31:16.361 --> 00:31:20.173
The older I get, you know
I talked about speaking

00:31:20.173 --> 00:31:24.006
in Hyderabad where Rick
is, in 1965, I was 19.

00:31:25.557 --> 00:31:29.637
At the age of 17 I was lying
in a hospital room in Delhi.

00:31:29.637 --> 00:31:32.037
I had never opened a Bible in my life.

00:31:32.037 --> 00:31:34.753
My parents used to go
to take me to church,

00:31:34.753 --> 00:31:36.582
and the only thing I did was memorize

00:31:36.582 --> 00:31:38.741
half of the prayer book
because then I knew

00:31:38.741 --> 00:31:42.684
how many minutes were left
before the service was over.

00:31:42.684 --> 00:31:44.413
As soon as the vicar would say,

00:31:44.413 --> 00:31:46.733
let us now therefore draw nearby faith,

00:31:46.733 --> 00:31:49.065
I knew we had seven minutes to go.

00:31:49.065 --> 00:31:51.224
(laughing)

00:31:51.224 --> 00:31:53.789
I couldn't have cared less.

00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:55.845
I was reading those beautiful prayers

00:31:55.845 --> 00:32:00.216
and I thought, what on
Earth does all of this mean?

00:32:00.216 --> 00:32:03.493
Age 17, when I lost purpose in living,

00:32:03.493 --> 00:32:04.933
I was in a hospital room.

00:32:04.933 --> 00:32:09.373
I had tried to poison myself
and my body was dehydrated.

00:32:09.373 --> 00:32:11.429
I'd failed in the
attempt but I was hanging

00:32:11.429 --> 00:32:12.973
between life and death.

00:32:12.973 --> 00:32:14.921
A man walked into my room.

00:32:14.921 --> 00:32:17.637
You know, if this had been
two, two and a half years ago

00:32:17.637 --> 00:32:19.600
and I was speaking,
he's be in the audience.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.041
He passed away a couple of hears ago.

00:32:21.041 --> 00:32:22.573
He used to live in Los Angeles.

00:32:22.573 --> 00:32:23.997
He's an Indian man.

00:32:23.997 --> 00:32:28.557
He walked into my hospital
room, and I just looked at him,

00:32:28.557 --> 00:32:31.693
and he said to my mother,
"I wanna read the bible

00:32:31.693 --> 00:32:32.561
"to your son."

00:32:32.561 --> 00:32:34.467
She said, "Whoever let you in here?

00:32:34.467 --> 00:32:35.904
"My son's dying."

00:32:35.904 --> 00:32:37.894
He said, "Madam, this
is what your son needs

00:32:37.894 --> 00:32:39.103
"more than anything else."

00:32:39.103 --> 00:32:42.930
She said, "You cannot be here,
he is in intensive care."

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.774
He said, "I'm here
because I'm a minister."

00:32:44.774 --> 00:32:46.666
She said, "You cannot be here."

00:32:46.666 --> 00:32:50.474
He said, "Will you do me a
favor, and you read it to him?"

00:32:50.474 --> 00:32:52.786
She said, "Okay give it to me."

00:32:52.786 --> 00:32:54.946
My mothers English was not that good,

00:32:54.946 --> 00:32:56.864
and he his this King James Gideon's

00:32:56.864 --> 00:32:59.218
new testament in his hand,

00:32:59.218 --> 00:33:02.637
and he gives it to her, and
turns it to John chapter 14,

00:33:02.637 --> 00:33:05.566
and in her heavy accented
way she's reading,

00:33:05.566 --> 00:33:08.517
and I'm listening to this because I knew

00:33:08.517 --> 00:33:11.370
my life was totally a mess.

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:13.303
Then she comes to verse 19.

00:33:13.303 --> 00:33:17.386
Jesus said "Because I
live, you also shall live."

00:33:19.259 --> 00:33:20.531
Nobody explained it to me.

00:33:20.531 --> 00:33:23.554
I told my mother to stop there,

00:33:23.554 --> 00:33:28.018
and I said, "Jesus, if you
are the author of life,

00:33:28.018 --> 00:33:30.706
"and you wanna help me how to live,

00:33:30.706 --> 00:33:34.329
"I will trust you, but
I want you to change

00:33:34.329 --> 00:33:36.534
"what I want to do.

00:33:36.534 --> 00:33:38.225
"I don't want to live.

00:33:38.225 --> 00:33:40.614
"If you will change what I want to do,

00:33:40.614 --> 00:33:44.587
"I will leave no stone unturned
in my pursuit of truth."

00:33:44.587 --> 00:33:46.066
I was 17 years old.

00:33:46.066 --> 00:33:49.342
Five days later I walked
out of that hospital room

00:33:49.342 --> 00:33:51.342
so thoroughly converted.

00:33:52.382 --> 00:33:55.411
Setting apart Christ in my heart as lord.

00:33:55.411 --> 00:33:57.303
I go to India about three times a year.

00:33:57.303 --> 00:34:01.038
In fact, two weeks from now
I'll be in Delhi speaking there.

00:34:01.038 --> 00:34:03.621
I always take a taxi all alone,

00:34:04.698 --> 00:34:06.193
and I go to the Belington hospital.

00:34:06.193 --> 00:34:08.053
It's called a different name now,

00:34:08.053 --> 00:34:11.549
and I park outside there and
I just look at that building

00:34:11.549 --> 00:34:15.632
and I say to myself, I
never dreamed 50 years ago

00:34:17.805 --> 00:34:19.977
what God had in store for me,

00:34:19.977 --> 00:34:24.509
and the drivers have no
clue what is going on,

00:34:24.509 --> 00:34:27.045
and one of them he was a
turban guy, a Sikh guy,

00:34:27.045 --> 00:34:29.205
and he looked at me and he said,
(speaking foreign language)

00:34:29.205 --> 00:34:31.813
"What is happening sir?"

00:34:31.813 --> 00:34:36.687
I said, (speaking foreign
language) "This is my story."

00:34:36.687 --> 00:34:38.886
and I tell him what happened.

00:34:38.886 --> 00:34:41.549
When that Sikh got me back to the hotel

00:34:41.549 --> 00:34:44.625
where I was staying, he folded his hands,

00:34:44.625 --> 00:34:48.493
and refused to take any money from me.

00:34:48.493 --> 00:34:51.365
He said, "I've never
heard a story like this,

00:34:51.365 --> 00:34:53.369
"and I just want to thank you

00:34:53.369 --> 00:34:55.857
"for not forgetting your roots."

00:34:55.857 --> 00:34:58.317
I told him it is not just my roots,

00:34:58.317 --> 00:35:01.965
it is a story of my conversion
through Jesus Christ

00:35:01.965 --> 00:35:05.009
who is now my lord and my savior.

00:35:05.009 --> 00:35:07.259
(applause)

00:35:11.833 --> 00:35:14.276
Set apart Christ in your heart as lord.

00:35:14.276 --> 00:35:15.417
What does that mean?

00:35:15.417 --> 00:35:16.693
It means two things.

00:35:16.693 --> 00:35:18.885
You know the two greatest commandments.

00:35:18.885 --> 00:35:21.225
That's what it means.

00:35:21.225 --> 00:35:23.129
To love the lord, your
God, with all your heart,

00:35:23.129 --> 00:35:25.605
and all your mind, and all your
soul, and all your strength,

00:35:25.605 --> 00:35:27.717
and to love your neighbor as yourself,

00:35:27.717 --> 00:35:30.944
but that followed a
fascinating conversation.

00:35:30.944 --> 00:35:33.867
A person tried to trip
Jesus up and said to him,

00:35:33.867 --> 00:35:36.749
is it alright to pay taxes to Cesar?

00:35:36.749 --> 00:35:39.551
It's one question I so
desperately with Jesus

00:35:39.551 --> 00:35:41.565
had answered differently.

00:35:41.565 --> 00:35:43.453
(laughing)

00:35:43.453 --> 00:35:45.252
April 15th would be a wonderful day

00:35:45.252 --> 00:35:49.430
to be godly and rebellious
at the same time.

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:51.149
Jesus said to him, "Do you have a coin?"

00:35:51.149 --> 00:35:52.077
He said, "Yes."

00:35:52.077 --> 00:35:53.637
he said, "Who's image do you see on this?"

00:35:53.637 --> 00:35:54.629
He said, "Cesar."

00:35:54.629 --> 00:35:56.847
He said, "Give it to Cesar
that which belongs to Cesar,

00:35:56.847 --> 00:35:58.633
"and give to God that
which belongs to God."

00:35:58.633 --> 00:36:02.985
A good question that will
always have a followup question.

00:36:02.985 --> 00:36:06.553
And he should have said,
what belongs to God?

00:36:06.553 --> 00:36:11.247
And Jesus would have said,
who's image is on you?

00:36:11.247 --> 00:36:12.825
Who's image is on you?

00:36:12.825 --> 00:36:15.297
Do you know the Judea Christian world view

00:36:15.297 --> 00:36:18.266
is the only world view that will give you

00:36:18.266 --> 00:36:21.297
that extraordinary credential.

00:36:21.297 --> 00:36:25.065
I have no right to take a
man with a sword in my hand

00:36:25.065 --> 00:36:27.765
and chop his head off
because I'm violating

00:36:27.765 --> 00:36:29.182
the image of God.

00:36:32.789 --> 00:36:37.125
I am fully attacking and
assaulting the amago de,

00:36:37.125 --> 00:36:38.697
the image of God,

00:36:38.697 --> 00:36:42.209
and that vertical gives me
the basis for the horizontal.

00:36:42.209 --> 00:36:44.517
No other world view gives you this.

00:36:44.517 --> 00:36:46.886
They either exalt you to deify you

00:36:46.886 --> 00:36:49.408
or cast you down into the
other end of the abyss

00:36:49.408 --> 00:36:52.005
to make nothing of you.

00:36:52.005 --> 00:36:55.469
The image of God, and then
when he goes on to say

00:36:55.469 --> 00:36:57.405
to love the lord, your
God with all your heart,

00:36:57.405 --> 00:36:59.055
and all your soul, and all you mind,

00:36:59.055 --> 00:37:00.705
and to love your neighbor as yourself.

00:37:00.705 --> 00:37:04.287
No matter how much we
disagree with others,

00:37:04.287 --> 00:37:08.454
we are taught by Christ to
love them, to love them,

00:37:11.308 --> 00:37:13.663
and you ask any Muslim,

00:37:13.663 --> 00:37:17.205
chances are nine out of
10 when you say to them,

00:37:17.205 --> 00:37:19.980
how did you come to know Jesus Christ.

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:23.037
A vast majority of them will
give you one of two ways.

00:37:23.037 --> 00:37:25.370
Number one, through a dream.

00:37:27.405 --> 00:37:29.457
Jesus revealed himself
to me through a dream,

00:37:29.457 --> 00:37:30.973
or number two they'll say,

00:37:30.973 --> 00:37:34.077
I watched the love of
God in another Christian

00:37:34.077 --> 00:37:37.317
and said that's what I really don't have.

00:37:37.317 --> 00:37:38.847
Those are one of two ways,

00:37:38.847 --> 00:37:41.069
and I've talked to scores of them.

00:37:41.069 --> 00:37:44.096
There are worlds views astride today

00:37:44.096 --> 00:37:47.757
that we may not find
comfortable within our zones,

00:37:47.757 --> 00:37:52.005
but I'm communed by God to
love my fellow human being

00:37:52.005 --> 00:37:54.853
no matter how much I disagree with them.

00:37:54.853 --> 00:37:58.213
I cannot be disagreeable with patience,

00:37:58.213 --> 00:38:01.855
if my lord himself looked
at those assaulting him

00:38:01.855 --> 00:38:03.265
and said, father forgive them

00:38:03.265 --> 00:38:04.857
because they don't know
what they're doing,

00:38:04.857 --> 00:38:07.061
how much more it is your call and my call

00:38:07.061 --> 00:38:10.105
to love my fellow human
being even in the face

00:38:10.105 --> 00:38:12.013
of all such hostility?

00:38:12.013 --> 00:38:15.210
It's a culture where
violence is absolutized

00:38:15.210 --> 00:38:17.395
and hate has become common.

00:38:17.395 --> 00:38:20.277
Neither is an option for us.

00:38:20.277 --> 00:38:22.527
(applause)

00:38:25.285 --> 00:38:27.401
We love our fellow human being with

00:38:27.401 --> 00:38:30.117
the love of Jesus Christ, alright.

00:38:30.117 --> 00:38:32.561
So we set apart Christ
in our heart as lord.

00:38:32.561 --> 00:38:35.621
Secondly, it is very
critical we understand

00:38:35.621 --> 00:38:38.577
that our apologetic will
not merely have to be heard,

00:38:38.577 --> 00:38:40.677
it'll have to be seen.

00:38:40.677 --> 00:38:42.862
Our apologetic was not merely to be heard,

00:38:42.862 --> 00:38:44.277
it has to be seen.

00:38:44.277 --> 00:38:46.497
It has to be visible to people.

00:38:46.497 --> 00:38:48.401
They are listening with their eyes,

00:38:48.401 --> 00:38:50.349
they are watching with their eyes.

00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:54.669
You know, years ago my wife
and I were visiting Honolulu

00:38:54.669 --> 00:38:57.761
and I said to her, "I'd really
love to go to the island

00:38:57.761 --> 00:38:58.857
"of Moloka'i."

00:38:58.857 --> 00:39:00.559
It's the worlds tallest sea cliffs,

00:39:00.559 --> 00:39:02.375
but I wanted to go there for a reason.

00:39:02.375 --> 00:39:04.926
I'd read the biography
of Damien Da Veuster,

00:39:04.926 --> 00:39:08.331
the Belgium missionary
who had gone to Moloka'i

00:39:08.331 --> 00:39:10.551
to walk with the people in Moloka'i,

00:39:10.551 --> 00:39:13.999
the Hawaiians that were sent
away there because of leprosy.

00:39:13.999 --> 00:39:15.845
His brother was commissioned to go,

00:39:15.845 --> 00:39:18.258
but his brother had suddenly passed away,

00:39:18.258 --> 00:39:20.767
and so Damien decided he was going to go

00:39:20.767 --> 00:39:22.098
to take his brothers place.

00:39:22.098 --> 00:39:23.451
He really didn't wanna do it,

00:39:23.451 --> 00:39:25.191
but he loved his brother
and felt that commission

00:39:25.191 --> 00:39:26.391
had to be fulfilled.

00:39:26.391 --> 00:39:27.224
So he came.

00:39:27.224 --> 00:39:30.171
He loved the people, the
touched them, he embraced them,

00:39:30.171 --> 00:39:33.531
built chapel for them,
helped find a cure for them,

00:39:33.531 --> 00:39:35.344
spend all of his life there.

00:39:35.344 --> 00:39:38.615
One morning he was pouring
a kettle of boiling water

00:39:38.615 --> 00:39:40.815
into a cup and the water
swirled out of there

00:39:40.815 --> 00:39:42.919
and fell onto his bare foot.

00:39:42.919 --> 00:39:47.031
It took him a moment to
realize he couldn't feel it.

00:39:47.031 --> 00:39:49.791
He was horrified as to
what that intimated.

00:39:49.791 --> 00:39:51.557
He took some more boiling water,

00:39:51.557 --> 00:39:55.011
put it gently onto the other
foot, and he couldn't feel it.

00:39:55.011 --> 00:39:56.839
He knew what had happened.

00:39:56.839 --> 00:40:00.195
That morning he began his
sermon in a different line.

00:40:00.195 --> 00:40:03.092
He always began by saying,
my fellow believers.

00:40:03.092 --> 00:40:07.259
That morning he began by
saying, my fellow lepers.

00:40:08.390 --> 00:40:10.355
He'd contracted leprosy.

00:40:10.355 --> 00:40:12.787
So as my wife and I
were being shown around

00:40:12.787 --> 00:40:14.957
with this story, I came to his grave,

00:40:14.957 --> 00:40:17.451
and I said to the man showing me around,

00:40:17.451 --> 00:40:19.535
"Damien is buried here."

00:40:19.535 --> 00:40:22.204
He said, "No sir, he was,
but the body was exhumed

00:40:22.204 --> 00:40:23.991
"and the Belgium government asked for him

00:40:23.991 --> 00:40:25.431
"to be brought back."

00:40:25.431 --> 00:40:26.839
I said, "Oh wow."

00:40:26.839 --> 00:40:28.147
He said, "Yup."

00:40:28.147 --> 00:40:30.739
He was a hero, but the people in Moloka'i,

00:40:30.739 --> 00:40:34.519
the people with leprosy, and
he taught them to realize

00:40:34.519 --> 00:40:37.533
they were not lepers, they
were people with leprosy.

00:40:37.533 --> 00:40:40.217
Even though he referred
to himself as a leper,

00:40:40.217 --> 00:40:43.431
he was referring to it
purposely as an outcast.

00:40:43.431 --> 00:40:46.832
He said you're not a leper,
you're a person with leprosy.

00:40:46.832 --> 00:40:49.735
Always give them the dignity
of their person hood,

00:40:49.735 --> 00:40:52.270
and so when they wanted the body back,

00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:53.861
the people there gathered together

00:40:53.861 --> 00:40:55.494
and wrote to the Belgium government,

00:40:55.494 --> 00:40:59.306
please, he loved us, this was his home.

00:40:59.306 --> 00:41:02.906
Don't take his body back
from here, but they insisted.

00:41:02.906 --> 00:41:04.794
So they finally said alright.

00:41:04.794 --> 00:41:09.222
Will you cut off that right
hand and bury it here?

00:41:09.222 --> 00:41:11.722
It's the hand that touched us.

00:41:14.468 --> 00:41:18.550
And today in Moloka'i, in
that grave is not his body,

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:22.550
it's the hand that reached
out and touched them.

00:41:23.426 --> 00:41:25.570
Some time ago when I was being interviewed

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:28.004
by India's leading newspaper, the Hindu,

00:41:28.004 --> 00:41:31.831
they were really quizzing me
on why I come there and speak,

00:41:31.831 --> 00:41:36.209
and then they found out the
charitable work we do there

00:41:36.209 --> 00:41:39.724
through my daughters work,
Wellspring International,

00:41:39.724 --> 00:41:42.496
and she looked at me and
said, you're doing this?

00:41:42.496 --> 00:41:44.916
I said, yeah we're home for the destitute.

00:41:44.916 --> 00:41:47.060
We work with prostitutes in the streets.

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:50.149
We've got children with aids
that we work, and burn victims.

00:41:50.149 --> 00:41:52.084
Went through all of that.

00:41:52.084 --> 00:41:55.137
She looked at me and said to me,

00:41:55.137 --> 00:41:58.002
"I will ever be grateful
for what you're doing

00:41:58.002 --> 00:42:00.130
"for your mother land and your home land."

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:01.918
The next day when she wrote the article,

00:42:01.918 --> 00:42:04.527
there was not one negative
word of criticism.

00:42:04.527 --> 00:42:07.268
It was just a series of appreciations

00:42:07.268 --> 00:42:09.802
of what was being done for the needy.

00:42:09.802 --> 00:42:12.969
You see, even the hostile are disarmed

00:42:14.754 --> 00:42:18.754
when they can see, and when
they can feel your touch.

00:42:18.754 --> 00:42:21.616
To you young people
especially I say to you,

00:42:21.616 --> 00:42:24.394
find some time in your college days,

00:42:24.394 --> 00:42:27.646
in your school days to go and
touch other peoples lives.

00:42:27.646 --> 00:42:31.022
It will be the most memorable
and the most wonderful thing

00:42:31.022 --> 00:42:35.413
you're ever doing, and do it
in the name of Jesus Christ.

00:42:35.413 --> 00:42:37.355
I'll give you a quick illustration.

00:42:37.355 --> 00:42:39.875
Time's running out but they
gave me a little more time

00:42:39.875 --> 00:42:40.958
that I could.

00:42:42.019 --> 00:42:45.614
In India, the washer
doesn't run, it walks.

00:42:45.614 --> 00:42:47.091
(laughing)

00:42:47.091 --> 00:42:48.841
But out here it runs.

00:42:50.408 --> 00:42:54.476
There's a guy in Delhi pushing himself.

00:42:54.476 --> 00:42:59.132
Only one leg bandaged up with
all horrible marks on it.

00:42:59.132 --> 00:43:00.648
I don't know what lay beneath it,

00:43:00.648 --> 00:43:03.079
but it was a horrible looking thing,

00:43:03.079 --> 00:43:05.359
and he had two stubs for arms.

00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:06.727
He was pulling himself.

00:43:06.727 --> 00:43:08.484
He did have one hand gnarled up,

00:43:08.484 --> 00:43:10.447
and I wanted to give him something,

00:43:10.447 --> 00:43:13.191
but I knew if I started
that I'd be crowded out.

00:43:13.191 --> 00:43:15.018
So I just followed him from a distance

00:43:15.018 --> 00:43:16.729
till there was not much of a crowd

00:43:16.729 --> 00:43:19.519
and as soon as I got close I said, bisob.

00:43:19.519 --> 00:43:22.234
(mumbles) means brother sir.

00:43:22.234 --> 00:43:23.763
I said, (speaking foreign language)

00:43:23.763 --> 00:43:25.203
can you wait for a moment?

00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:27.123
So I walked over to him and a knelt down

00:43:27.123 --> 00:43:29.163
on my haunches and I said to him,

00:43:29.163 --> 00:43:31.578
I want to give you this in
the name of Jesus Christ

00:43:31.578 --> 00:43:33.093
who loves you.

00:43:33.093 --> 00:43:34.655
It was 100 rupees.

00:43:34.655 --> 00:43:35.931
It was a lot for him.

00:43:35.931 --> 00:43:37.348
It's about $1.50.

00:43:38.479 --> 00:43:41.419
I opened up his hand and
I put the 100 rupee note,

00:43:41.419 --> 00:43:43.639
and he just looked at it like that,

00:43:43.639 --> 00:43:46.431
and his hand began to quiver,

00:43:46.431 --> 00:43:49.264
and he said sob ge, respected sir.

00:43:50.823 --> 00:43:53.788
(speaking foreign language)

00:43:53.788 --> 00:43:56.187
May God richly bless you.

00:43:56.187 --> 00:44:00.354
It's the greatest benediction
I have ever received.

00:44:01.515 --> 00:44:04.320
Bless people, let them see it.

00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:06.675
It's an apologetic, not
merely heard but seen.

00:44:06.675 --> 00:44:10.902
Secondly, not merely argued
but also felt in conviction.

00:44:10.902 --> 00:44:13.379
Not merely argued but also
felt in in conviction.

00:44:13.379 --> 00:44:15.899
Here I say, pray for wisdom.

00:44:15.899 --> 00:44:17.295
Please pray for wisdom.

00:44:17.295 --> 00:44:20.175
How to disarm an antagonist.

00:44:20.175 --> 00:44:22.887
(mumbles) I have 46 other apologists

00:44:22.887 --> 00:44:25.559
working with me on our
team and 15 countries.

00:44:25.559 --> 00:44:28.827
I keep talking to them, be humble in heart

00:44:28.827 --> 00:44:30.378
and be wise in wise in response.

00:44:30.378 --> 00:44:32.280
Humble in heart, wise in response.

00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:35.197
So you're not answering a question,

00:44:36.323 --> 00:44:38.297
you're answering a questioner.

00:44:38.297 --> 00:44:39.695
You're not answering a question,

00:44:39.695 --> 00:44:42.294
you're answering a questioner,

00:44:42.294 --> 00:44:45.093
and it reminded me of the
time I was in the middle east.

00:44:45.093 --> 00:44:47.692
Quick story and final thought,

00:44:47.692 --> 00:44:51.215
and we were talking to one of
the four founders of Hamas,

00:44:51.215 --> 00:44:53.255
muscle bound guy.

00:44:53.255 --> 00:44:55.295
The archbishop of
Canterbury took five of us.

00:44:55.295 --> 00:44:58.131
We're meeting with Israeli
leaders and Palestinian leaders

00:44:58.131 --> 00:44:59.751
and boy this guy was hostile.

00:44:59.751 --> 00:45:01.191
He spent years in prison.

00:45:01.191 --> 00:45:02.571
You could barely get a word in,

00:45:02.571 --> 00:45:04.190
he was so argumentative.

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:06.351
His room was full of tobacco smoke,

00:45:06.351 --> 00:45:08.602
and after about several hours,

00:45:08.602 --> 00:45:10.740
the archbishop said to the five of us,

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:12.768
would each one of you men
like to ask one question?

00:45:12.768 --> 00:45:14.296
So I asked mine.

00:45:14.296 --> 00:45:15.508
I won't tell you the question,

00:45:15.508 --> 00:45:16.858
this was a private conversation,

00:45:16.858 --> 00:45:20.456
but I can tell you this,
I didn't like his answer,

00:45:20.456 --> 00:45:21.781
and so I looked at him and I said,

00:45:21.781 --> 00:45:24.840
"Sir, I really don't like your answer.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.596
"I have to be honest with you."

00:45:26.596 --> 00:45:28.276
I said, "Can I tell you something?

00:45:28.276 --> 00:45:30.132
"Not far from where you and I are sitting,

00:45:30.132 --> 00:45:32.744
"5,000 years ago a man
by the name of Abraham

00:45:32.744 --> 00:45:34.904
"took his son up the hill
and was gonna offer him

00:45:34.904 --> 00:45:36.136
"as a sacrifice."

00:45:36.136 --> 00:45:37.500
I said, "You remember the story?"

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:38.333
He said yes.

00:45:38.333 --> 00:45:40.121
I said, "Please let's
not debate which son,

00:45:40.121 --> 00:45:42.436
"let's just agree he
took his son up that hill

00:45:42.436 --> 00:45:44.340
"to offer him as a sacrifice."

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.839
He said, "That's right."

00:45:45.839 --> 00:45:47.744
I said, "As the ax about to come down,

00:45:47.744 --> 00:45:49.659
"God stops it, remember that?"

00:45:49.659 --> 00:45:50.604
He said, "Yes."

00:45:50.604 --> 00:45:52.398
I said, "What did God say?

00:45:52.398 --> 00:45:53.529
He didn't know.

00:45:53.529 --> 00:45:56.348
I said, "God said stop,
I myself will provide."

00:45:56.348 --> 00:45:58.104
He said, "That's right."

00:45:58.104 --> 00:46:00.040
Stop, I myself will provide.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.916
I said, "Very close to
where you and I are sitting

00:46:01.916 --> 00:46:03.664
"in Rumula is another hill.

00:46:03.664 --> 00:46:06.804
"2,000 years ago God took
his own son up that hill,

00:46:06.804 --> 00:46:09.804
"and this time the ax did not stop."

00:46:11.395 --> 00:46:13.145
He just stared at me.

00:46:14.124 --> 00:46:17.737
I said, "Shaykh, until
you and I receive the son

00:46:17.737 --> 00:46:20.408
"God has provide, we'll
be offering our own sons

00:46:20.408 --> 00:46:22.448
"and daughters on the
battle fields of this world

00:46:22.448 --> 00:46:26.615
"for position, and power,
and land, and prestige."

00:46:28.387 --> 00:46:30.984
I myself got shocked that I said that.

00:46:30.984 --> 00:46:32.544
(laughing)

00:46:32.544 --> 00:46:34.012
I've never thought of it before.

00:46:34.012 --> 00:46:35.845
Leave alone saying it.

00:46:37.221 --> 00:46:38.424
And so the archbishop says,

00:46:38.424 --> 00:46:40.972
well you know I guess it's time to go now.

00:46:40.972 --> 00:46:42.728
(laughing)

00:46:42.728 --> 00:46:44.225
So we left.

00:46:44.225 --> 00:46:46.900
I thought boy I have blown this big time,

00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:48.984
and as I was walking I
felt this arm around me,

00:46:48.984 --> 00:46:50.200
and it was the archbishop.

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:52.317
He leaned over and said,
"Ravi that was of God"

00:46:52.317 --> 00:46:54.468
I said, "I sure hope so."

00:46:54.468 --> 00:46:56.320
I don't know what I said.

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:58.344
So we went down the steps,

00:46:58.344 --> 00:46:59.961
and the archbishop is the guest of honor.

00:46:59.961 --> 00:47:01.132
They were ushering him in.

00:47:01.132 --> 00:47:02.304
So the five of us are going.

00:47:02.304 --> 00:47:03.876
I'm still in a daze whether in the body

00:47:03.876 --> 00:47:05.871
or out of the body, I couldn't tell,

00:47:05.871 --> 00:47:08.064
and I hear somebody running behind me

00:47:08.064 --> 00:47:09.880
and he comes and twirls me around.

00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:11.241
It's the Shaykh.

00:47:11.241 --> 00:47:14.064
I said that's it I'm gonna
be buried here in (mumbles)

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:18.485
it's over, this guy can
have me for dinner tonight,

00:47:18.485 --> 00:47:21.751
and then he looked at me and
stared me eye ball to eye ball

00:47:21.751 --> 00:47:24.228
holding onto my shoulders,

00:47:24.228 --> 00:47:26.732
and then he patted me on
both sides of the face.

00:47:26.732 --> 00:47:28.470
He said, "Mr. Zacharias."

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:30.053
I said, "Yes, sir?"

00:47:31.772 --> 00:47:34.189
He said, "You are a good man.

00:47:36.468 --> 00:47:38.051
"You're a good man.

00:47:39.332 --> 00:47:42.108
I hope I will see you again someday."

00:47:42.108 --> 00:47:45.335
And he gave a big solid bear hug,

00:47:45.335 --> 00:47:47.280
and as he pulled himself away

00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.228
I looked at his eyes and
he's wiping the tears off.

00:47:52.228 --> 00:47:55.957
I don't know what happened following.

00:47:55.957 --> 00:47:58.136
I've never been back
to be able to see him.

00:47:58.136 --> 00:48:00.845
I'm watched carefully when I go there,

00:48:00.845 --> 00:48:04.095
but a word in season can bring to fruit

00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:08.243
that which only God can
nurture and nourish,

00:48:08.243 --> 00:48:11.668
and I say to you, ask God for wisdom.

00:48:11.668 --> 00:48:13.409
We're not picking a fight,

00:48:13.409 --> 00:48:16.560
we're looking for answers
that'll break through the course

00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.960
resistance and do it in love.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.377
Set apart Christ.

00:48:21.768 --> 00:48:23.911
It's not merely heard but seen.

00:48:23.911 --> 00:48:26.148
Not merely argued but also felt,

00:48:26.148 --> 00:48:29.032
and lastly we cannot only rescue the ends

00:48:29.032 --> 00:48:31.053
of bringing them to Christ.

00:48:31.053 --> 00:48:35.136
We must rescue the means
of the very word of God.

00:48:36.217 --> 00:48:38.518
Let me tell you something.

00:48:38.518 --> 00:48:42.855
What is it the gospel gives
that no other world view gives?

00:48:42.855 --> 00:48:45.193
Think about this question.

00:48:45.193 --> 00:48:48.526
It gives you an awful lot, an awful lot.

00:48:50.336 --> 00:48:52.860
In fact, I preached a message last week

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:55.288
that the very questions the seculars ask

00:48:55.288 --> 00:48:57.672
are only legitimate questions of the Bible

00:48:57.672 --> 00:48:59.440
is the only answer for it.

00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.068
Forget the answers they give.

00:49:01.068 --> 00:49:03.412
I'm talking about the
questions they raise.

00:49:03.412 --> 00:49:07.176
They're only legitimized by
the Judea-Christian world view,

00:49:07.176 --> 00:49:11.016
and what is the one thing
the Bible gives to you and me

00:49:11.016 --> 00:49:12.456
that none else does?

00:49:12.456 --> 00:49:14.316
The Getha hints at it.

00:49:14.316 --> 00:49:16.839
The Muslims are repelled by it,

00:49:16.839 --> 00:49:20.071
but there is no one
else that provides this,

00:49:20.071 --> 00:49:24.154
and the Muslim Shaykh in
Damascus, Shaykh Hussein

00:49:26.065 --> 00:49:28.826
was the leading Shiite
cleric which whom I had

00:49:28.826 --> 00:49:30.625
a three R public dialogue.

00:49:30.625 --> 00:49:32.984
Ended the dialogue with these words.

00:49:32.984 --> 00:49:37.365
He said, "Professor, I want
to say something to you.

00:49:37.365 --> 00:49:41.913
"It's time for us in Islam
to stop asking the question

00:49:41.913 --> 00:49:45.080
"if Jesus died, and start asking why."

00:49:46.979 --> 00:49:49.637
I said, "May I quote you
on that Shaykh Hussein?"

00:49:49.637 --> 00:49:51.304
He said, "Yes, why?"

00:49:52.636 --> 00:49:56.386
Some years ago I was in
San Juan, Puerto Rico

00:49:59.079 --> 00:50:01.447
and I was preaching at
a large church there,

00:50:01.447 --> 00:50:04.264
and the pastor was a man by
the name of Carmela Teranova.

00:50:04.264 --> 00:50:07.687
Great preacher, and I was in his office

00:50:07.687 --> 00:50:09.623
getting ready to go into the platform

00:50:09.623 --> 00:50:12.143
and I saw a big painting in his office.

00:50:12.143 --> 00:50:16.074
It was a sweet little girl
sitting on the lap of our lord

00:50:16.074 --> 00:50:19.282
holding his hand and looking at it,

00:50:19.282 --> 00:50:23.449
and the words in Spanish said,
what happened to your hands?

00:50:28.834 --> 00:50:31.167
What happened to your hands?

00:50:36.544 --> 00:50:40.179
You know what happened to his hands?

00:50:40.179 --> 00:50:43.679
It what was here that wounded those hands,

00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:47.287
and that's why the hymn writer says,

00:50:47.287 --> 00:50:51.175
what language shall I borrow
to thank your dearest friend

00:50:51.175 --> 00:50:54.547
for this thy dying sorrow,
thy pity without end,

00:50:54.547 --> 00:50:58.479
oh make me thine forever
and should I fainting be,

00:50:58.479 --> 00:51:02.562
lord let me never never
outlive my love for thee.

00:51:03.727 --> 00:51:07.073
I sometimes think about
the cross and shut my eyes

00:51:07.073 --> 00:51:09.187
and try to see the cruel nails,

00:51:09.187 --> 00:51:12.547
the crown of thorns, and
Jesus crucified for me,

00:51:12.547 --> 00:51:14.647
but even could I see him die,

00:51:14.647 --> 00:51:17.782
I would much see a little
part of that great love,

00:51:17.782 --> 00:51:21.865
which like a fire is always
burning in his heart.

00:51:24.937 --> 00:51:26.935
What happened to his hands?

00:51:26.935 --> 00:51:30.518
Is the answer to a
world that's so wounded,

00:51:31.719 --> 00:51:34.703
and you ultimately reach
a wounded civilization

00:51:34.703 --> 00:51:37.375
through a wounded savior.

00:51:37.375 --> 00:51:40.327
Why are the universities packed

00:51:40.327 --> 00:51:43.719
when we are doing open forums
and with his eyes closed.

00:51:43.719 --> 00:51:45.469
They have no answers.

00:51:46.855 --> 00:51:50.083
Whether you go to Harvard,
or Princeton, or Yale,

00:51:50.083 --> 00:51:54.187
or STF Kentucky, or
Michigan or Michigan State.

00:51:54.187 --> 00:51:59.123
Wherever we go, it's an overflow
crowd of young students.

00:51:59.123 --> 00:52:03.290
You know STF Kentucky we had
7,000 on a Wednesday night,

00:52:05.139 --> 00:52:06.639
and they lined up.

00:52:07.703 --> 00:52:11.870
The gospel is beautiful
and it's beautifully true,

00:52:12.863 --> 00:52:16.780
and is the only answer
to our relativistic cart

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:21.683
where he pulls in the
absoluteness of his love,

00:52:21.683 --> 00:52:23.587
and changes the hungers.

00:52:23.587 --> 00:52:25.974
It's the only hope for the world.

00:52:25.974 --> 00:52:29.483
That's what Conrad Adanar
said to Billy Graham

00:52:29.483 --> 00:52:31.207
after the second world war.

00:52:31.207 --> 00:52:35.483
Mr. Graham, outside of the
resurrection of Jesus Christ,

00:52:35.483 --> 00:52:39.175
I know of no other hope for mankind.

00:52:39.175 --> 00:52:42.667
We have that message,
let the world see it.

00:52:42.667 --> 00:52:45.263
Life for him, serve him.

00:52:45.263 --> 00:52:47.063
It's a beautiful message.

00:52:47.063 --> 00:52:49.447
If you're not walking
in lockstep with him,

00:52:49.447 --> 00:52:52.507
let this be the evening of repentance

00:52:52.507 --> 00:52:54.607
in turning your heart around.

00:52:54.607 --> 00:52:58.927
If you do know him, let your
light so shine before people

00:52:58.927 --> 00:53:02.695
that they will see your good
works, and glorify your father

00:53:02.695 --> 00:53:03.819
who is in heaven.

00:53:03.819 --> 00:53:05.903
It's been my real honor,

00:53:05.903 --> 00:53:07.583
and even through Rick is not here,

00:53:07.583 --> 00:53:09.787
I'll convey to him my
thanks for the privilege

00:53:09.787 --> 00:53:11.663
of being here at Saddleback.

00:53:11.663 --> 00:53:14.380
You folks have touched the world,

00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:17.139
and may your greatest years
still be ahead of you.

00:53:17.139 --> 00:53:18.967
May I close in prayer?

00:53:18.967 --> 00:53:21.217
(applause)

00:53:23.079 --> 00:53:27.487
Thank you, God bless you,
thank you so much, thank you.

00:53:27.487 --> 00:53:29.183
(applause)

00:53:29.183 --> 00:53:30.350
God bless you.

00:53:31.627 --> 00:53:34.223
Thank you so much, thank you.

00:53:34.223 --> 00:53:36.775
Thank you, God bless you.

00:53:36.775 --> 00:53:38.259
Thank you so much&gt;

00:53:38.259 --> 00:53:39.842
Please let me pray.

00:53:41.783 --> 00:53:42.998
Let me close in prayer.

00:53:42.998 --> 00:53:46.073
Thank you so much for your kind response.

00:53:46.073 --> 00:53:50.240
Eternal father strong to save,
we need you more than ever.

00:53:53.455 --> 00:53:56.230
We are a desperate people.

00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:59.813
Lord Jesus, apart from
you we have no hope.

00:54:01.341 --> 00:54:04.899
I pray for every man, woman,
and young person here.

00:54:04.899 --> 00:54:07.316
Tonight, today, this weekend.

00:54:10.226 --> 00:54:13.871
I pray that hearts will be touched,

00:54:13.871 --> 00:54:16.283
lives will be transformed.

00:54:16.283 --> 00:54:19.615
You have given your servant a unique honor

00:54:19.615 --> 00:54:22.032
of standing on this platform.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:27.223
I don't deserve it lord, I really don't,

00:54:28.239 --> 00:54:31.906
but you in your grace
pour mercy upon mercy.

00:54:32.783 --> 00:54:35.275
Thank you for Rick and his team.

00:54:35.275 --> 00:54:39.310
How you have used them,
and I earnestly pray

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:42.854
their greatest decades
and years will be ahead.

00:54:42.854 --> 00:54:45.029
Lord we pray for our nation.

00:54:45.029 --> 00:54:47.279
We go to the poles shortly.

00:54:49.081 --> 00:54:52.634
Sovereign lord who changes
the hearts of kings,

00:54:52.634 --> 00:54:53.717
do your work.

00:54:56.249 --> 00:55:00.339
May this nation never
lose sight of its roots

00:55:00.339 --> 00:55:03.756
and ever walk towards that glorious call.

00:55:06.777 --> 00:55:10.944
For you have endowed us with
some beautiful privileges

00:55:12.102 --> 00:55:13.769
of life and liberty,

00:55:15.627 --> 00:55:19.544
and to pursue the joys
that you alone can give.

00:55:20.985 --> 00:55:24.938
This land of the free,
may we ever be that,

00:55:24.938 --> 00:55:27.893
and use our freedom to honor you.

00:55:27.893 --> 00:55:31.506
What greater return can
we give you for that gift?

00:55:31.506 --> 00:55:34.281
Let your benediction rest upon Saddleback

00:55:34.281 --> 00:55:36.368
and its work all over the world.

00:55:36.368 --> 00:55:37.451
Be with Rick.

00:55:38.744 --> 00:55:41.145
Grant him safety and anointing,

00:55:41.145 --> 00:55:45.566
and all that work alongside
him with his servants heart.

00:55:45.566 --> 00:55:49.733
We come before you tonight with
hearts filled with gratitude

00:55:51.209 --> 00:55:55.005
for enabling us to live
at a time such as this.

00:55:55.005 --> 00:55:57.677
In the name of our lord, and our redeemer,

00:55:57.677 --> 00:55:59.260
Jesus Christ, amen.

00:56:00.578 --> 00:56:01.797
God bless you.

00:56:01.797 --> 00:56:04.047
(applause)
