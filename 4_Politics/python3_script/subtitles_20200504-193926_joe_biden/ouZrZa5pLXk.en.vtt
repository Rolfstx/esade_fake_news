[ADHD Explained: A 28-Minute Primer]

00:00:03.262 --> 00:00:06.562
[Understood for learning &amp; attention issues]

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:09.477
What we know as ADHD,

00:00:09.477 --> 00:00:10.477
[Thomas E. Brown, Ph.D. — Associate Director,]

00:00:10.477 --> 00:00:11.477
[Yale Clinic for Attention and Related Disorders]

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:12.808
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder—or

00:00:12.808 --> 00:00:15.781
some people still call it "ADD," attention-deficit disorder—

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:18.266
has been recognized by some doctors

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:23.710
since way back in 1902. But from 1902 until 1980,

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.545
it was all about little boys who couldn't sit still,

00:00:27.545 --> 00:00:29.750
couldn't shut up, and were driving everybody nuts.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.841
It was just behavior problems.

00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:33.454
The name of the disorder was changed

00:00:33.454 --> 00:00:36.252
a number of times. There were different formulations.

00:00:36.252 --> 00:00:38.841
But it was all about behavior problems.

00:00:38.841 --> 00:00:43.113
Since 1980, which is when they first changed the name

00:00:43.113 --> 00:00:46.109
of the disorder to include the words "attention deficit,"

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.615
we've realized that this is not so much

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:52.479
a behavior problem but far more a problem

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:54.407
with the brain's management system—

00:00:54.407 --> 00:00:56.439
its executive functions.

00:00:57.066 --> 00:00:59.852
And we also learned that there are many people

00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:01.300
who have ADHD who've never had

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.183
any significant behavior problems.

00:01:04.183 --> 00:01:06.052
And that even for those who have,

00:01:06.052 --> 00:01:08.688
that's usually the least of it. It's the attention problems

00:01:08.688 --> 00:01:10.719
that tend to make more trouble for people,

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:13.168
particularly as they get a little bit older

00:01:13.168 --> 00:01:14.352
and more is expected of them

00:01:14.352 --> 00:01:16.546
for being able to manage themselves.

00:01:17.127 --> 00:01:19.066
One thing that's important to be clear about

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.747
from the very beginning is that ADHD has nothing to do

00:01:22.747 --> 00:01:25.859
with how smart a person is. There's some people

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:28.482
who have this who are like super, super, super smart.

00:01:28.482 --> 00:01:31.291
Others, high average, middle average, low average, slow.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:33.984
I treat people for this who are like university professors

00:01:33.984 --> 00:01:36.387
and doctors and lawyers and big shots in business.

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:38.443
A lot of people who are regular folks.

00:01:38.443 --> 00:01:40.312
Some people have trouble doing the basics.

00:01:40.312 --> 00:01:42.483
You could be anything along the IQ spectrum

00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:44.875
and still have ADHD. It has nothing to do

00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:48.602
with how smart you are. The other thing to know

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:52.468
is that this is a problem—a set of problems—

00:01:52.468 --> 00:01:55.835
that include a wide range of characteristics,

00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:59.144
and what I'd like to do today is to describe for you

00:01:59.144 --> 00:02:02.115
some of the characteristics of what we call ADHD,

00:02:02.115 --> 00:02:06.376
give some examples of them, and then talk a little bit

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:08.154
about what we know about what's involved

00:02:08.154 --> 00:02:12.402
in the brain in the course of ADHD.

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:17.383
One thing that's important is that people—

00:02:17.383 --> 00:02:19.635
one of the main things that people with ADHD

00:02:19.635 --> 00:02:22.178
complain about is trouble staying tuned.

00:02:22.178 --> 00:02:25.313
That when they're listening or reading or working

00:02:25.313 --> 00:02:28.448
on something, they get part of it,

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.002
but then it sort of drifts off, and then they're back,

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:33.811
and then they drift off, and it drifts off again,

00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:35.124
and then they're back.

00:02:35.124 --> 00:02:37.249
They have difficulty staying tuned.

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:39.222
It's similar, in a way, to the problem you have

00:02:39.222 --> 00:02:40.538
with a cell phone where you're in an area

00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:42.152
where you don't have good reception. You can get

00:02:42.152 --> 00:02:44.984
part of it, and then the message keeps fading in and out.

00:02:44.984 --> 00:02:47.899
The other thing is that they often have a problem

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:50.535
with being distracted. Like anybody else,

00:02:50.535 --> 00:02:52.743
they see and hear things that are going on around them.

00:02:52.743 --> 00:02:54.230
They have thoughts going through their head.

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.203
But most people, if they have something they've got

00:02:56.203 --> 00:02:58.779
to focus on, can push that stuff out of the way and focus

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.366
on what they've got to do. People with ADHD—

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:04.059
it's real hard for them to do that. They'll be sitting

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.387
in the classroom trying to listen to what's going on,

00:03:06.387 --> 00:03:09.047
or perhaps they'll be in a meeting or sitting down

00:03:09.047 --> 00:03:11.101
trying to read something or write something,

00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:12.637
and somebody drops a pencil, and they have to sort of

00:03:12.637 --> 00:03:14.840
check and see, where did the pencil go?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.291
Then they'll be back on task again

00:03:16.291 --> 00:03:18.105
for a couple of minutes. Then they're thinking

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:20.519
about some TV show they saw the night before.

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.657
And then they're back on task again for a minute,

00:03:22.657 --> 00:03:24.188
so they're thinking about some conversation they had

00:03:24.188 --> 00:03:26.844
with somebody two hours ago. And then they're back

00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:29.689
on task again for a few minutes, and then they're looking

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:32.139
out the window like anybody else will from time to time,

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:33.851
but they're likely to sit and watch the squirrel go up

00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:35.802
the tree a little longer than somebody else

00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:37.892
and be checking out the traffic and the cloud formation,

00:03:37.892 --> 00:03:39.157
the guy who's mowing the lawn.

00:03:39.157 --> 00:03:41.329
Then they're back on task again for a few minutes,

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.174
and they'll be thinking about what they're going to do

00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:44.324
when this is over and how soon is this thing

00:03:44.324 --> 00:03:47.216
going to be over anyhow. I've got things I've got to do.

00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:48.364
And what am I going to have for supper tonight?

00:03:48.364 --> 00:03:49.700
And I wonder what's on TV tonight?

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.860
All these things are coming in all at one time,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.426
and it's almost like you're trying to watch TV

00:03:53.426 --> 00:03:55.411
and you've got four different stations all coming in

00:03:55.411 --> 00:03:58.383
at the same time on one channel, and it gets kind of hard

00:03:58.383 --> 00:04:00.903
to separate the signal from the noise.

00:04:00.903 --> 00:04:03.794
But the thing that's puzzling about this,

00:04:03.794 --> 00:04:08.206
that really makes it very difficult for people to understand,

00:04:08.206 --> 00:04:11.015
is for people who have ADHD, it's like that

00:04:11.015 --> 00:04:14.207
almost all the time, but not always.

00:04:14.207 --> 00:04:16.983
Everybody I've ever seen who has ADD—

00:04:16.983 --> 00:04:20.256
and that's a lot of people—has a few things they can do

00:04:20.256 --> 00:04:21.932
where they have no trouble paying attention,

00:04:21.932 --> 00:04:23.985
no trouble focusing.

00:04:23.985 --> 00:04:27.119
Let me give you an example. Sixteen-year-old boy

00:04:27.119 --> 00:04:30.534
I saw—he was the goaltender for his school's

00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:33.170
ice hockey team.  And it just happened

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.480
that the day his parents brought him in to see me

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.046
was the day after his team had just won

00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:39.857
the state championship in ice hockey, so they're bragging

00:04:39.857 --> 00:04:41.748
a little bit at the beginning about how great he was

00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:43.653
in the tournament the day before. And apparently he was

00:04:43.653 --> 00:04:45.883
a very good goalie. They said when he was in there

00:04:45.883 --> 00:04:47.119
playing hockey, he missed nothing. He knew

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:49.255
where the puck was every second of a fast game.

00:04:49.255 --> 00:04:51.461
Totally on top of it. The kind of goalie every team wants.

00:04:51.461 --> 00:04:54.295
Smart kid. Tested way high up in the superior range.

00:04:54.295 --> 00:04:55.839
Wanted to get good grades. Was hoping to go

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:58.010
to medical school. But he was always in trouble

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.181
with his teachers. And what they'd say to him is,

00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:02.409
you know, once in a while you'll say something

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:03.978
that shows how smart you are.

00:05:03.978 --> 00:05:05.671
We'll be talking about something. You'll come in

00:05:05.671 --> 00:05:07.472
with some comment that's really very perceptive,

00:05:07.472 --> 00:05:10.003
and it's quite impressive. But most of the time,

00:05:10.003 --> 00:05:11.489
you're out to lunch. You're looking out the window.

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:12.673
You're staring at the ceiling. You look like

00:05:12.673 --> 00:05:14.485
you're half-asleep half the time. You don't even know

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:16.493
what page we're on. And the question they kept asking

00:05:16.493 --> 00:05:19.006
him was, "If you can pay attention so well

00:05:19.006 --> 00:05:21.478
"when you're playing hockey, how come you can't pay

00:05:21.478 --> 00:05:23.313
attention when you're sitting in class?"

00:05:23.313 --> 00:05:25.902
Here's another example. A lot of times parents will bring

00:05:25.902 --> 00:05:27.389
in kids for me to see, and they say, "You know,

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:28.797
"the teacher says this kid can't pay attention

00:05:28.797 --> 00:05:30.944
"for more than five minutes. We know that's not true.

00:05:30.944 --> 00:05:32.593
"We have watched her play video games.

00:05:32.593 --> 00:05:34.161
"And she can sit and play those video games

00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:36.804
"for three hours at a time and not move.

00:05:36.804 --> 00:05:39.033
"And the teacher said she's easily distracted.

00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:40.904
"That's nonsense. When she's playing those games,

00:05:40.904 --> 00:05:42.714
"she's locked on that screen like a laser,

00:05:42.714 --> 00:05:44.247
"and the only way you're going to get her attention

00:05:44.247 --> 00:05:46.626
is to jump in her face or turn off the TV."

00:05:46.626 --> 00:05:47.776
So again, it's like, you can do it here.

00:05:47.776 --> 00:05:50.667
Why can't you do it there? Now, it's not always sports

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:52.544
or video games. There's some people with ADD—

00:05:52.544 --> 00:05:53.880
they're not good at that stuff. They might be into art,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.447
and they're sketching and drawing and really getting

00:05:55.447 --> 00:05:57.456
into it. Somebody else, when they were little,

00:05:57.456 --> 00:06:00.080
they're creating engineering marvels with LEGO blocks.

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.600
And then when they're older, they're taking car engines

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.853
apart and putting them back together

00:06:02.853 --> 00:06:05.443
or designing computer networks. But everybody

00:06:05.443 --> 00:06:08.067
I've ever seen who has ADHD has a few things

00:06:08.067 --> 00:06:10.529
they can do where they have no trouble paying attention,

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:12.773
even though on almost everything else, they've got

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:15.547
a lot of trouble paying attention. And if you ask them

00:06:15.547 --> 00:06:17.030
about it, you say, "What's with this? How come

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.375
"you can do it here and you can't do it here, here,

00:06:19.375 --> 00:06:22.381
and here?" Usually what they'll say is, "It's easy.

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:25.111
"If it's something I'm interested in, I can pay attention.

00:06:25.111 --> 00:06:29.085
If not, I can't." And most people hear that and they say,

00:06:29.085 --> 00:06:31.450
"Yeah, right. Congratulations. That's true for anybody.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.342
"Anybody's going to pay attention better for something

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:35.177
they're interested in than for something they're not."

00:06:35.177 --> 00:06:37.289
Which is true. But here's the difference.

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:40.482
People who don't have ADHD—if they've got something

00:06:40.482 --> 00:06:42.607
they've got to do and they know they've got to do it

00:06:42.607 --> 00:06:44.952
and it's important, they can usually make themselves

00:06:44.952 --> 00:06:46.659
pay attention, even if it's pretty boring,

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:48.911
just because they know they have to do it.

00:06:48.911 --> 00:06:51.523
People with ADD—it is incredibly difficult for them

00:06:51.523 --> 00:06:53.729
to be able to make themselves pay attention

00:06:53.729 --> 00:06:56.876
unless the task  is something that's really interesting

00:06:56.876 --> 00:06:58.486
to them, not because somebody told them

00:06:58.486 --> 00:07:00.727
it ought to be interesting, but just because it is interesting

00:07:00.727 --> 00:07:04.271
to them for whatever reasons. Or if they feel like

00:07:04.271 --> 00:07:06.063
they have a gun to their head and something

00:07:06.063 --> 00:07:08.479
very unpleasant is going to be happening very fast

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.893
if they don't take care of this right here, right now.

00:07:10.893 --> 00:07:13.552
Under those two conditions, no problem.

00:07:13.552 --> 00:07:16.176
They can focus very well. Anything else,

00:07:16.176 --> 00:07:18.881
it's really difficult for them to focus.

00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:22.329
But the problem is, this is not something

00:07:22.329 --> 00:07:26.253
that's under voluntary control. It makes it look

00:07:26.253 --> 00:07:30.328
like it's a problem with willpower. "If you can do it here,

00:07:30.328 --> 00:07:32.650
why can't you do it here, here and here?"

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.750
But it's not a problem with willpower. It's a problem

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.141
with the way the brain is wired. All the characteristics

00:07:39.141 --> 00:07:41.752
of ADHD, which I'm going to be describing here,

00:07:41.752 --> 00:07:44.800
are things everybody has trouble with sometimes.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:48.289
It's just people with ADD have a lot more trouble with it.

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:51.852
So in that sense, ADHD is not an all-or-nothing deal

00:07:51.852 --> 00:07:53.640
like pregnancy, with, either you are pregnant

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.313
or you're not pregnant. There's nothing in between.

00:07:55.313 --> 00:07:58.000
It's more like depression, where everybody

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.085
gets bummed out once in a while. But just because

00:08:00.085 --> 00:08:02.557
somebody's unhappy for a couple of days doesn't mean

00:08:02.557 --> 00:08:04.172
we're going to diagnose them as clinically depressed.

00:08:04.172 --> 00:08:07.142
It's only when those depressive symptoms are persistent

00:08:07.142 --> 00:08:09.117
and pervasive and making a lot of trouble for them,

00:08:09.117 --> 00:08:10.829
we say, "Yep, that's a depression.

00:08:10.829 --> 00:08:12.271
We ought to do something about it."

00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:16.345
So all the characteristics of ADHD are problems

00:08:16.345 --> 00:08:19.585
everybody has sometimes. It's just, with people

00:08:19.585 --> 00:08:22.069
who have ADD, they just have a lot more difficulty with it

00:08:22.069 --> 00:08:23.961
more of the time. And the problem is,

00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:27.178
it is not under voluntary control.

00:08:27.178 --> 00:08:30.405
It's not something you can do with willpower.

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:33.221
But let me tell you about some of the other things

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.612
which we see with people with ADHD.

00:08:36.612 --> 00:08:39.096
One is they often have trouble getting organized

00:08:39.096 --> 00:08:42.880
and getting started on things. For many, it's difficulty

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.225
organizing their stuff—their backpack, their desks,

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:49.072
their notebooks, their filing system, their living space—

00:08:49.072 --> 00:08:51.139
bigger mess than most other people most of the time,

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:53.310
unless somebody else is helping them take care of it.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.980
Other people have no trouble at all with their stuff.

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.186
They have a lot of trouble with their time and their work.

00:08:58.186 --> 00:09:00.705
And what they'll tell you is, "If I have a bunch of stuff to do

00:09:00.705 --> 00:09:03.435
"at one time, it's really hard for me to look at it and say,

00:09:03.435 --> 00:09:05.171
"'OK, that should be first. That should be second.

00:09:05.171 --> 00:09:07.847
That should be third.'" But even when they get

00:09:07.847 --> 00:09:10.100
their priorities straight, which often doesn't happen,

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.398
they tend to have a lot of difficulty getting started.

00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:15.406
Another piece of it that you'll often hear about

00:09:15.406 --> 00:09:17.197
from people with ADHD is, they'll say they have

00:09:17.197 --> 00:09:19.287
a lot of difficulty in regulating their sleep

00:09:19.287 --> 00:09:21.759
and their alertness and being able to keep up the effort

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:25.611
to finish things in a reasonable time. Many complain

00:09:25.611 --> 00:09:27.677
that they have trouble getting to sleep,

00:09:27.677 --> 00:09:29.569
and what they'll tell you is, "I often stay up a lot later

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:32.646
"than I really want to or should because I've found

00:09:32.646 --> 00:09:35.375
"if I try to go to bed before I'm really, really exhausted,

00:09:35.375 --> 00:09:37.929
"I just can't shut my head off. I just keep thinking of stuff.

00:09:37.929 --> 00:09:40.763
"And so I stay up late reading, watching TV,

00:09:40.763 --> 00:09:43.097
"surfing the net, or whatever until I'm just exhausted.

00:09:43.097 --> 00:09:46.180
"Then I fall asleep fine. But the problem then is I tend

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.467
"to sleep like a dead person, and I have a hard time

00:09:48.467 --> 00:09:51.160
"resurrecting myself in the morning. And if I don't have

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.877
"somebody around to help me get myself out of bed

00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:56.024
"in the morning, I'm very likely to be late to whatever it is

00:09:56.024 --> 00:09:57.568
"I'm supposed to do or possibly sleep through

00:09:57.568 --> 00:09:59.333
"the whole thing. I just keep hitting the snooze button

00:09:59.333 --> 00:10:01.643
or just turn the clock off altogether."

00:10:02.932 --> 00:10:05.939
During the day they're usually all right as long as they're

00:10:05.939 --> 00:10:08.063
on their feet moving around or talking a lot.

00:10:08.063 --> 00:10:10.537
But if they have to sit still for very long to listen

00:10:10.537 --> 00:10:13.115
or to read or do paperwork, the eyelids start getting

00:10:13.115 --> 00:10:17.967
kind of heavy. Another thing that often happens

00:10:17.967 --> 00:10:20.208
as a problem with people with ADHD

00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:22.461
is they have trouble staying with a task,

00:10:22.461 --> 00:10:24.307
that they may start it reasonably well,

00:10:24.307 --> 00:10:26.141
but they have a hard time then keeping up

00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:28.417
the effort to finish it in a reasonable time.

00:10:29.102 --> 00:10:31.551
I had a track star from the university, a runner,

00:10:31.551 --> 00:10:33.223
who came into my office one day, and he said,

00:10:33.223 --> 00:10:36.010
"My mind's a great sprinter,

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.261
but it's a lousy distance runner."

00:10:38.261 --> 00:10:40.003
He said, "If the task I have to do is something

00:10:40.003 --> 00:10:41.941
"you can do in one quick chunk, you just go all out for it

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:44.779
"and then you're done with it, I'm fine. But if it's

00:10:44.779 --> 00:10:46.639
"something where you can't do it in one quick chunk,

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.984
"it's a longer-term project, if you have to chip—

00:10:48.984 --> 00:10:51.156
"keep chipping away at it day after day, that I have

00:10:51.156 --> 00:10:53.384
"more trouble with. And my approach to that

00:10:53.384 --> 00:10:55.856
"is either hurry up, slapdash, get the thing done,

00:10:55.856 --> 00:10:58.039
"or, why don't we just set this aside and wait

00:10:58.039 --> 00:11:00.153
until it becomes a little more of an emergency?"

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.409
Everybody has trouble with deadlines sometimes.

00:11:04.409 --> 00:11:07.079
People with ADD, it's almost like they can't get started

00:11:07.079 --> 00:11:09.865
until it's becoming an emergency.

00:11:09.865 --> 00:11:12.292
Another thing that often persons with ADHD have trouble

00:11:12.292 --> 00:11:15.856
with is writing. I'm not talking about penmanship, now.

00:11:15.856 --> 00:11:18.886
I'm talking about taking ideas and putting them

00:11:18.886 --> 00:11:22.636
into sentences and paragraphs. Because what people

00:11:22.636 --> 00:11:25.910
say is, often, "I've got a lot of ideas for what I should write

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.212
"for this essay I'm supposed to write

00:11:28.212 --> 00:11:31.297
"or for this term paper, but it just takes me half of forever

00:11:31.297 --> 00:11:33.782
"to be able to get the sentences and paragraphs

00:11:33.782 --> 00:11:38.287
"put together so they make sense. I'm either changing it

00:11:38.287 --> 00:11:40.979
or it's just disorganized." They have difficulty

00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:43.093
organizing their thoughts and being able to get the words

00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:45.101
out in a reasonable way.

00:11:45.101 --> 00:11:47.470
Another piece of this—it's not part

00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.383
of the official diagnostic criteria for ADHD,

00:11:50.383 --> 00:11:52.961
but it's certainly something that a lot of people with ADHD

00:11:52.961 --> 00:11:55.376
are concerned about and complain about—

00:11:55.376 --> 00:11:57.675
is that many times they have difficulty managing

00:11:57.675 --> 00:12:00.173
their emotions. But I need to give you a few examples,

00:12:00.173 --> 00:12:02.079
because it's not the same for everybody.

00:12:02.079 --> 00:12:04.446
Salesman I saw one time came in and he said,

00:12:04.446 --> 00:12:07.174
"You know, I was in the diner yesterday late afternoon

00:12:07.174 --> 00:12:08.929
"having a lunch. I'm in a pretty good mood, sitting there

00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:10.739
"eating my sandwich. The guy in the booth behind me

00:12:10.739 --> 00:12:12.690
"gets his sandwich. He's chewing too loud.

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:15.383
He's going chomp, chomp, chomp." He said,

00:12:15.383 --> 00:12:16.800
"There was something about that noise

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.870
"that was driving me nuts. It was as though

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.515
"a computer virus had gotten into my head

00:12:20.515 --> 00:12:21.990
"and just gobbled up all the space,

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:23.789
"and that's all I could think about, was that noise.

00:12:23.789 --> 00:12:25.925
"I'm sitting there with my fists clenched, seriously thinking

00:12:25.925 --> 00:12:27.818
"about getting up and smacking this guy in the mouth

00:12:27.818 --> 00:12:29.685
because he was chewing so obnoxiously loud."

00:12:29.685 --> 00:12:31.531
He said, "I didn't do it. I didn't want to get arrested.

00:12:31.531 --> 00:12:33.435
"But if I'd been at home, I would have been yelling

00:12:33.435 --> 00:12:34.887
at somebody or I would have walked out of the room."

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:35.353
He said, "Then it was strange,

00:12:35.353 --> 00:12:37.361
"because after a few minutes, he's still making

00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:39.615
the same noise, but then it didn't bother me anymore."

00:12:39.615 --> 00:12:41.577
He said, "Stuff like that happens to me a lot

00:12:41.577 --> 00:12:44.155
"where there'll be some little frustration, the kind of thing

00:12:44.155 --> 00:12:46.105
"that most people on a scale of frustration would say—

00:12:46.105 --> 00:12:48.451
"that goes from zero to 10—would say, that's a zero

00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:52.259
or a one, maybe a two at the most. For me," he said,

00:12:52.259 --> 00:12:54.320
"it can be like a seven or an eight or nine."

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.806
He said, "Sometimes I make a big fuss about it.

00:12:55.806 --> 00:12:57.536
"A lot of times I don't say anything. But I feel this surge

00:12:57.536 --> 00:12:59.464
"of anger where I feel like punching somebody

00:12:59.464 --> 00:13:02.552
or breaking something. And then usually it's over with."

00:13:02.919 --> 00:13:05.089
But he said, "It's not always that way."

00:13:05.089 --> 00:13:08.142
He said, "Day before that, I'm in the office. I'm walking

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:10.186
"down the hall. A friend of mine who works

00:13:10.186 --> 00:13:11.788
"in the other department's coming around the corner.

00:13:11.788 --> 00:13:13.089
"He's walking toward me reading some papers

00:13:13.089 --> 00:13:15.179
"as he's walking. And I hadn't seen him for a long time.

00:13:15.179 --> 00:13:17.083
"So as we approached each other, I stopped and said,

00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:18.348
"'Hey, what's up? How you doing?' I figured we'd stop

00:13:18.348 --> 00:13:20.055
"and chat for a minute. And he looks up, says hi,

00:13:20.055 --> 00:13:21.889
puts his head down, keeps right on walking."

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:23.526
He said, "Now most people would blow that off

00:13:23.526 --> 00:13:24.838
"in a minute and figure he was in a hurry.

00:13:24.838 --> 00:13:26.289
He's got to get to a meeting or something. We'll talk later."

00:13:26.289 --> 00:13:29.076
He said, "Not me. Happened at lunchtime. I got nothing

00:13:29.076 --> 00:13:31.687
"done for the rest of the day. I spent all afternoon

00:13:31.687 --> 00:13:34.125
"thinking to myself, 'Did I do something to annoy him?'

00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:36.680
"Or maybe I did something to offend somebody

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.515
"in his department and they're all angry with me.

00:13:38.515 --> 00:13:40.221
"Or maybe I'm just the kind of person that nobody likes,

00:13:40.221 --> 00:13:41.092
"and nobody would tell me about it.

00:13:41.092 --> 00:13:43.286
But I couldn't get it out of my head."

00:13:43.286 --> 00:13:45.481
Other people, it's not like that.

00:13:45.481 --> 00:13:47.547
They get an idea in their head of something they want

00:13:47.547 --> 00:13:48.917
to do or something they want to get

00:13:48.917 --> 00:13:51.425
or something they want to buy, and all of a sudden

00:13:51.425 --> 00:13:54.513
that wish takes on such strong urgency that the feeling is,

00:13:54.513 --> 00:13:58.124
I've got to have it now. And it almost doesn't matter

00:13:58.124 --> 00:14:00.671
how expensive it is or how inconvenient it's going to be

00:14:00.671 --> 00:14:02.890
for them or for somebody else, or whether they're using

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:05.062
time and money now for this that they know they need

00:14:05.062 --> 00:14:06.851
for something else tomorrow that's more important.

00:14:06.851 --> 00:14:08.541
There's just this relentless push, and they will keep that

00:14:08.541 --> 00:14:11.314
up until either they get it or they hit a brick wall.

00:14:11.314 --> 00:14:13.067
But even if they get it, they're not that happy,

00:14:13.067 --> 00:14:14.740
because usually by then they're off on something else

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:18.026
they want. Other people, it's not like that,

00:14:18.026 --> 00:14:21.578
but they worry a lot. Like one woman talked about

00:14:21.578 --> 00:14:23.383
how she was driving down the expressway.

00:14:23.383 --> 00:14:25.599
She's in the left lane. She said, "I'm in the left lane.

00:14:25.599 --> 00:14:27.887
"I've got the Jersey barrier to my left, an 18-wheeler truck

00:14:27.887 --> 00:14:30.731
"on my right. We're cruising about 65 miles an hour,

00:14:30.731 --> 00:14:32.785
"and this truck starts to pull over a little bit.

00:14:32.785 --> 00:14:34.744
"He didn't get in my lane, but it got me thinking about

00:14:34.744 --> 00:14:37.344
"how big his truck was and how small my car was.

00:14:37.344 --> 00:14:38.789
"And pretty soon I'm thinking to myself,

00:14:38.789 --> 00:14:41.599
"what would happen if he didn't see me and he pulled

00:14:41.599 --> 00:14:44.083
"over and squished me against the Jersey barrier?

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:46.000
"And soon I'm not just thinking about it. I'm running

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.519
"a very vivid movie in my head, imagining exactly what

00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:50.028
"it would look like if that truck came over

00:14:50.028 --> 00:14:52.420
"and smashed into my car, crumpled the car,

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.184
"sharp pieces of metal were sticking into me,

00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:55.972
"I'm bleeding to death, the car's getting dragged

00:14:55.972 --> 00:14:58.364
"along the Jersey barrier, the truck jackknifes,

00:14:58.364 --> 00:15:00.616
"cars and trucks behind us are hitting us repeatedly,

00:15:00.616 --> 00:15:02.834
"there's this massive traffic jam, takes a long time

00:15:02.834 --> 00:15:05.608
"to get the rescue squad out to cut me out of the car.

00:15:05.608 --> 00:15:07.141
"By that time, I've bled to death. They have to call

00:15:07.141 --> 00:15:08.569
"my family and tell them I'm dead. And all this

00:15:08.569 --> 00:15:10.763
"while I'm trying to drive the car 65 miles an hour

00:15:10.763 --> 00:15:13.224
down the road." She said, "Stuff like that happens to me

00:15:13.224 --> 00:15:17.187
"all the time. There'll be some little thing, and I think,

00:15:17.187 --> 00:15:19.335
"what would happen if this happened?

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:20.619
"And everything's going all right, and I'm thinking,

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:22.112
"what would happen if this happened or what

00:15:22.112 --> 00:15:23.356
"would happen if that happened? And pretty soon

00:15:23.356 --> 00:15:25.550
I'm not just thinking about it. I'm into it."

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.296
Now, it's not like anybody with ADD has all this stuff.

00:15:28.296 --> 00:15:30.967
But many will have one or some combination

00:15:30.967 --> 00:15:32.894
of a couple of them. But what they have in common

00:15:32.894 --> 00:15:35.726
is that computer virus in the head thing, that the emotion,

00:15:35.726 --> 00:15:37.474
whether it's the hurt feelings or the being annoyed

00:15:37.474 --> 00:15:41.097
about something or, "I've got to have it now,"

00:15:41.097 --> 00:15:42.966
or, "What would happen if?"—comes and just sort of

00:15:42.966 --> 00:15:44.388
gobbles up all the space in their head,

00:15:44.388 --> 00:15:46.686
and it's very difficult for them to put it in perspective,

00:15:46.686 --> 00:15:48.956
to put it to the back of their mind and get on

00:15:48.956 --> 00:15:50.721
with what they've got to do.

00:15:50.721 --> 00:15:53.855
Another thing that's very important for people with ADHD

00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:58.417
is their working memory. If you ask folks who have ADHD,

00:15:58.417 --> 00:16:00.416
"How's your memory?" Often they'll say,

00:16:00.416 --> 00:16:02.784
"I've got the best memory in my family. I can remember

00:16:02.784 --> 00:16:04.432
stuff nobody else can remember." And they give you

00:16:04.432 --> 00:16:07.301
some example about some movie they saw 10 years ago.

00:16:07.301 --> 00:16:09.715
And they can tell you every detail of the entire storyline

00:16:09.715 --> 00:16:11.213
of the movie they saw once 10 years ago

00:16:11.213 --> 00:16:12.606
and haven't seen it since.

00:16:12.606 --> 00:16:14.383
Or somebody else will say, "Yeah, I went

00:16:14.383 --> 00:16:16.405
"to the Super Bowl five years ago. I can still describe

00:16:16.405 --> 00:16:19.038
for you almost every play they ran during that game."

00:16:19.038 --> 00:16:22.846
Or somebody else will say, "I've got 450 songs

00:16:22.846 --> 00:16:25.098
"in my head, all the music, all the lyrics,

00:16:25.098 --> 00:16:28.372
all the verses that were popular back in the '70s."

00:16:28.372 --> 00:16:29.962
But even though they might be very good

00:16:29.962 --> 00:16:31.524
about remembering some things like that

00:16:31.524 --> 00:16:33.858
from a long time ago, if you ask them about something

00:16:33.858 --> 00:16:35.425
that happened just a couple of minutes ago

00:16:35.425 --> 00:16:37.677
or yesterday, often they can't tell you.

00:16:37.677 --> 00:16:40.336
The problem with memory with ADHD is not

00:16:40.336 --> 00:16:42.345
with long-term storage memory.

00:16:42.345 --> 00:16:44.551
It's with short-term working memory.

00:16:44.551 --> 00:16:48.301
It's what you depend on when you go into the other room

00:16:48.301 --> 00:16:49.845
to get something and you're standing there scratching

00:16:49.845 --> 00:16:50.913
your head wondering what in the world

00:16:50.913 --> 00:16:52.759
you came in here for.

00:16:52.759 --> 00:16:54.605
Or you're working on a project. You go downstairs

00:16:54.605 --> 00:16:56.335
to get something you need for the project, see something

00:16:56.335 --> 00:16:58.424
else that's interesting or something else that needs doing.

00:16:58.424 --> 00:17:00.596
Soon you're up to your elbows in project number two,

00:17:00.596 --> 00:17:02.244
having totally forgotten you were in the middle

00:17:02.244 --> 00:17:03.475
of project number one upstairs

00:17:03.475 --> 00:17:05.367
and it was kind of important to get it done.

00:17:05.367 --> 00:17:07.189
Students complain—they'll be in class. Teacher asks

00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:08.470
the question. They'll raise their hand. They've got

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:10.289
a good answer for it. Teacher calls on somebody

00:17:10.289 --> 00:17:12.345
else first. You have to wait while this other kid

00:17:12.345 --> 00:17:14.075
says her shtick. Then the teacher comes back and says,

00:17:14.075 --> 00:17:15.182
"Yeah, what were you going to say?" It's like

00:17:15.182 --> 00:17:17.180
totally clueless. Not only have I forgotten what

00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.468
I was going to say, but what was the question again?

00:17:19.468 --> 00:17:22.718
Or they'll read something and understand it perfectly well

00:17:22.718 --> 00:17:25.132
at the moment that they read it. They read

00:17:25.132 --> 00:17:27.850
a few more pages, stop for a second, and realize

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:29.683
their eyes have gone over every word and they haven't

00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:31.905
got the foggiest idea of what they just read.

00:17:31.905 --> 00:17:35.071
Or—this really bothers them—they'll study for a test

00:17:35.071 --> 00:17:37.938
the night before the test. They'll go over it and, quiz them,

00:17:37.938 --> 00:17:39.911
they've got it. They go into class the next day

00:17:39.911 --> 00:17:41.653
thinking they're going to get a good grade on this,

00:17:41.653 --> 00:17:43.070
and all of a sudden the big chunk of what they knew

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:45.020
the night before has evaporated. Can't pull it out

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.228
of their head when they need it.

00:17:46.228 --> 00:17:47.993
But then a few hours, a few days later,

00:17:47.993 --> 00:17:50.105
something jogs their memory and it's all back again.

00:17:50.105 --> 00:17:52.544
It's not that they didn't have it. It's they couldn't retrieve it

00:17:52.544 --> 00:17:54.854
when they needed it. Or you're getting ready

00:17:54.854 --> 00:17:56.381
to go someplace. You think of five things you need

00:17:56.381 --> 00:17:58.087
to take with you. Half an hour later, you're walking

00:17:58.087 --> 00:17:59.480
out the door. You got one of them. Can't remember

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:01.302
the other four to save your life. It's where you have to hold

00:18:01.302 --> 00:18:03.717
one thing in your mind while you're doing something else.

00:18:03.717 --> 00:18:05.784
That's the kind of memory problem that people

00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:07.896
with ADHD complain about.

00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:13.713
Another part of this is managing action. You know,

00:18:13.713 --> 00:18:15.605
it's certainly true that there are some people who,

00:18:15.605 --> 00:18:18.775
even as adults, are very restless and antsy.

00:18:18.775 --> 00:18:20.366
It's like they always have to have some part of them

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:23.652
in motion. And there are some who are very quick

00:18:23.652 --> 00:18:26.602
to jump into things, even as adults. And certainly

00:18:26.602 --> 00:18:28.354
there are many kids who have this sort of thing.

00:18:28.354 --> 00:18:31.571
But the fact is, many people with ADHD have difficulty

00:18:31.571 --> 00:18:34.484
slowing down when they need to slow down

00:18:34.484 --> 00:18:36.842
and speeding up when they need to speed up.

00:18:36.842 --> 00:18:39.533
Often they have difficulty in monitoring their actions.

00:18:39.533 --> 00:18:42.589
They'll sometimes speak out of turn and not take

00:18:42.589 --> 00:18:44.496
into account what the effects are going to be

00:18:44.496 --> 00:18:46.280
of talking out and saying what they're saying.

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.032
Or they'll jump into something without thinking about,

00:18:48.032 --> 00:18:50.054
"What's going to happen if I do this?"

00:18:50.054 --> 00:18:53.305
But all these things I'm talking about—the problems

00:18:53.305 --> 00:18:56.288
with memory, the problems with difficulty

00:18:56.288 --> 00:18:59.179
in controlling actions, the problems with regulating

00:18:59.179 --> 00:19:01.664
emotions, the problems with regulating alertness

00:19:01.664 --> 00:19:04.032
and sleep, the problems with being able to focus

00:19:04.032 --> 00:19:06.446
and shift focus when you need to—all these things

00:19:06.446 --> 00:19:11.021
constitute the range of difficulties that people with ADHD

00:19:11.021 --> 00:19:13.692
complain about. And remember, all of these are things

00:19:13.692 --> 00:19:16.397
everybody has trouble with sometimes.

00:19:16.397 --> 00:19:18.487
It's just that people with ADD have a lot more trouble

00:19:18.487 --> 00:19:21.400
with them. So the question is not,

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:24.362
does it ever happen, but how much does it happen?

00:19:24.362 --> 00:19:27.856
How much does it interfere with the person's being able

00:19:27.856 --> 00:19:30.909
to do the things they have to do in their daily life?

00:19:32.186 --> 00:19:35.135
Now, how does it happen? Why is it that some people

00:19:35.135 --> 00:19:38.224
have this—so much more difficulty with these things

00:19:38.224 --> 00:19:42.179
than other people do? The evidence shows that it seems

00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:45.766
to be mostly inherited. Out of every four people

00:19:45.766 --> 00:19:48.365
diagnosed with ADHD, one of them has a mom or dad

00:19:48.365 --> 00:19:50.502
who's got it, whether they know it or not.

00:19:50.502 --> 00:19:52.767
They never used to diagnose this very well.

00:19:52.767 --> 00:19:54.915
Even today, it gets missed a lot. The other three,

00:19:54.915 --> 00:19:56.285
if they don't have a parent who has it,

00:19:56.285 --> 00:19:58.760
usually they have a grandparent or an uncle or an aunt

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.419
or a cousin or a brother or sister. One of their relatives

00:20:01.419 --> 00:20:04.843
will have it. Although often, it's not recognized.

00:20:04.843 --> 00:20:08.441
There are some people who have this where you can see

00:20:08.441 --> 00:20:11.564
it from early childhood. There are some others

00:20:11.564 --> 00:20:13.967
where you don't see it much in the early years

00:20:13.967 --> 00:20:16.243
of their schooling, but then when they begin to move

00:20:16.243 --> 00:20:18.912
into middle school and they don't have that one teacher

00:20:18.912 --> 00:20:21.001
who can help to keep things organized for them,

00:20:21.001 --> 00:20:22.870
now all of a sudden they've got to keep track

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:25.063
of what's going on in several different classes

00:20:25.063 --> 00:20:27.642
and homework for different courses and moving around

00:20:27.642 --> 00:20:29.336
from one class to another.

00:20:29.336 --> 00:20:31.775
They have a lot more difficulty managing it.

00:20:31.775 --> 00:20:35.060
There's some whose parents are so effective in building

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.254
a scaffolding around them that you don't even see

00:20:37.254 --> 00:20:39.553
the problem until they get up into high school

00:20:39.553 --> 00:20:41.097
where their parents are not that much aware

00:20:41.097 --> 00:20:42.710
of what they need to do, or they may move out

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:45.752
of the house and move off to college or get involved

00:20:45.752 --> 00:20:48.911
in some work where the parents can't help them,

00:20:48.911 --> 00:20:51.477
and you begin to see then that they have a lot of trouble

00:20:51.477 --> 00:20:54.460
organizing themselves and doing what they need to do.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:56.793
So we don't always see this in early childhood.

00:20:56.793 --> 00:20:59.834
Sometimes it doesn't really appear until adolescence

00:20:59.834 --> 00:21:04.015
or early adulthood. But the fact is that those

00:21:04.015 --> 00:21:06.639
are usually the hardest times, I would say probably

00:21:06.639 --> 00:21:10.723
for most, middle school, high school,

00:21:10.723 --> 00:21:14.894
first couple of years of college or going out

00:21:14.894 --> 00:21:17.042
in to the work world. Those are the times

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:20.117
when most people with ADHD have the most difficulty

00:21:20.117 --> 00:21:22.695
with it. Because those are the times when you have

00:21:22.695 --> 00:21:26.365
the widest range of tasks you have to do with the least

00:21:26.365 --> 00:21:28.373
opportunity to escape from the ones

00:21:28.373 --> 00:21:32.239
you're not that good at. If you're lucky, as you move on,

00:21:32.239 --> 00:21:34.932
you can focus more on the things you're good at

00:21:34.932 --> 00:21:36.872
and let somebody else do the other stuff

00:21:36.872 --> 00:21:38.683
that you're not that good at.

00:21:38.683 --> 00:21:41.353
And some people function quite well that way.

00:21:41.353 --> 00:21:45.463
But the fact is, these are problems that can cause

00:21:45.463 --> 00:21:48.667
a lot of difficulty, not just in school, but in the way

00:21:48.667 --> 00:21:50.757
people get along with other members of their family,

00:21:50.757 --> 00:21:52.950
the way people manage their social relationships

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.994
and the way they manage their jobs.

00:21:54.994 --> 00:21:59.197
And what we need to do is to be able to design a way

00:21:59.197 --> 00:22:01.913
of helping them to work with their strengths

00:22:01.913 --> 00:22:04.166
and working around their difficulties.

00:22:04.166 --> 00:22:07.440
But I think in order to be able to really appreciate this

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.843
fully, it's important to understand what's going on

00:22:09.843 --> 00:22:13.223
in the brain that underlies these difficulties,

00:22:13.223 --> 00:22:14.917
which I've just been describing.

00:22:14.917 --> 00:22:19.492
The brain is about two and a half pounds. About that big.

00:22:19.492 --> 00:22:22.765
In there, you've got 100 billion neurons.

00:22:22.765 --> 00:22:25.146
Those are the cells  that make up most of the brain tissue.

00:22:25.146 --> 00:22:27.769
It's hard for most people to imagine a number as big

00:22:27.769 --> 00:22:30.277
as 100 billion, but here's a way you can do it.

00:22:30.277 --> 00:22:33.346
Think about pixels on a TV screen.

00:22:33.346 --> 00:22:37.618
Imagine a 17-inch TV screen or monitor screen

00:22:37.618 --> 00:22:39.894
for your computer. On that screen,

00:22:39.894 --> 00:22:44.781
you'd have about 200,000 pixels. Now imagine

00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:48.067
if we then went to the Freedom Tower in New York.

00:22:48.067 --> 00:22:51.771
It's almost 100 floors high.

00:22:51.771 --> 00:22:54.461
And take 17-inch monitor screens and set them

00:22:54.461 --> 00:22:57.119
side by side, bottom to top, all the way up one side,

00:22:57.119 --> 00:22:59.371
all the way around, so this entire building

00:22:59.371 --> 00:23:01.729
is totally covered with 17-inch TV sets,

00:23:01.729 --> 00:23:04.237
and turn them all on, and add up all those pixels

00:23:04.237 --> 00:23:07.568
on all those screens in that entire, huge building.

00:23:07.568 --> 00:23:09.589
You would then have enough pixels,

00:23:09.589 --> 00:23:12.399
if you added them all together, to show

00:23:12.399 --> 00:23:15.893
how many neurons one person has in their brain.

00:23:15.893 --> 00:23:20.350
Now, these neurons—they're very, very tiny.

00:23:20.350 --> 00:23:22.602
You have to look at them under a microscope.

00:23:22.602 --> 00:23:25.064
But they come in different sizes and shapes,

00:23:25.064 --> 00:23:27.165
but they all work on a branches-and-twigs system,

00:23:27.165 --> 00:23:30.963
something like this. And if you isolate any one of them,

00:23:32.413 --> 00:23:36.163
you'd find that there are over 1,000 places

00:23:36.163 --> 00:23:38.776
where it's connecting and interacting with the ones

00:23:38.776 --> 00:23:42.273
around it. But the thing that's amazing about it is,

00:23:42.273 --> 00:23:45.073
the whole system works on low-voltage

00:23:45.073 --> 00:23:47.603
electrical impulses, and it is not wired

00:23:47.603 --> 00:23:51.574
together for anybody. That's true for those with ADHD.

00:23:51.574 --> 00:23:53.825
It's true for every one of the rest of us.

00:23:53.825 --> 00:23:56.287
They are not directly connected. Let me show you

00:23:56.287 --> 00:23:58.981
what it looks like. If you can imagine

00:23:58.981 --> 00:24:02.809
these tiny, tiny connections that are so small you need

00:24:02.809 --> 00:24:06.315
a microscope to see them. Look like a couple

00:24:06.315 --> 00:24:08.880
of mushroom heads butted up against each other.

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.232
And then there's a space between them

00:24:11.232 --> 00:24:13.764
which is thinner than a piece of tissue paper.

00:24:13.764 --> 00:24:15.516
So when there's something that's coming in

00:24:15.516 --> 00:24:19.476
from the brain, electrical impulses traveling along here,

00:24:19.476 --> 00:24:22.529
it has to jump this gap like a spark plug.

00:24:22.529 --> 00:24:25.490
And there are little receptor buttons on the other side

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:28.463
here that it has to connect with. And if it comes in

00:24:28.463 --> 00:24:31.307
strong enough … ccckkkoo. It goes on

00:24:31.307 --> 00:24:34.616
to the next connection and moves on from there

00:24:34.616 --> 00:24:39.062
to wherever it needs to go. If it doesn't, it just fizzles here.

00:24:39.062 --> 00:24:42.150
But the other thing we have here is there are

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:44.704
little bubbles on the side. This is where

00:24:44.704 --> 00:24:47.700
they're coming from. This is where the chemicals

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:49.256
are manufactured. The brain makes

00:24:49.256 --> 00:24:52.228
50 different chemicals to help carry messages

00:24:52.228 --> 00:24:56.080
back and forth. And there are two of them that control

00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.855
most of the things that I've been describing in ADHD.

00:24:58.855 --> 00:25:01.629
So what's happening when that electrical impulse

00:25:01.629 --> 00:25:05.868
comes is it releases microdots of that chemical.

00:25:05.868 --> 00:25:10.059
That's what crosses the gap and hits these receptors.

00:25:10.059 --> 00:25:12.764
It works like a spark plug. And then if it hits

00:25:12.764 --> 00:25:16.272
the right threshold, it moves on. And then on this side,

00:25:16.272 --> 00:25:18.941
there's some little cells that work

00:25:18.941 --> 00:25:22.473
like little vacuum cleaners that go scha-week

00:25:22.473 --> 00:25:26.036
and suck back the chemicals and reload the system.

00:25:26.036 --> 00:25:28.742
Otherwise, it would be just locked open all the time.

00:25:28.742 --> 00:25:32.131
We think what happens with people who have ADHD

00:25:32.131 --> 00:25:34.697
is their brains make these chemicals the same way

00:25:34.697 --> 00:25:38.087
everybody else's brain does. But they simply

00:25:38.087 --> 00:25:41.257
do not release and reload them effectively.

00:25:41.257 --> 00:25:43.590
And the other thing we know is that for eight

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:46.469
out of 10 people who have ADHD, if you give them

00:25:46.469 --> 00:25:49.058
the right amount of the right medicine, the system

00:25:49.058 --> 00:25:52.866
can work better. For some, it's huge how much it helps.

00:25:52.866 --> 00:25:55.491
For others, it's substantial, but it's not huge.

00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:58.555
For others, it helps a little but not that much.

00:25:58.555 --> 00:26:00.703
And two out of 10 it doesn't work at all.

00:26:00.703 --> 00:26:05.138
But the fact is, though this is indeed a chemical problem,

00:26:05.138 --> 00:26:10.456
the medicines we have for ADHD cure nothing.

00:26:10.456 --> 00:26:13.067
It's not like you have a strep throat, you take an antibiotic,

00:26:13.067 --> 00:26:14.844
and it knocks out the infection. It's more like

00:26:14.844 --> 00:26:17.991
my eyeglasses. I have a problem with my eyes.

00:26:17.991 --> 00:26:22.204
I can't see well. If it I'm looking at typewriter-size print,

00:26:22.204 --> 00:26:24.260
it just looks blurry to me. If I put these on,

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.408
I can read it as well as anybody can. Take them off,

00:26:26.408 --> 00:26:28.823
I'm right back where I started. The glasses do not fix

00:26:28.823 --> 00:26:31.968
my eyes. They just help me see when I've got them on.

00:26:31.968 --> 00:26:34.338
And the same thing is true of the medicines

00:26:34.338 --> 00:26:36.449
we use for treating ADHD.

00:26:36.449 --> 00:26:40.084
But it's also important to recognize that medication

00:26:40.084 --> 00:26:43.334
is just one aspect of the treatment that's important

00:26:43.334 --> 00:26:47.643
for somebody with ADHD. And there are many ways

00:26:47.643 --> 00:26:50.509
in which we help people with ADHD by helping them

00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:55.178
to learn skills, by helping them to use some technology

00:26:55.178 --> 00:26:58.823
and strategies to be able to deal with whatever

00:26:58.823 --> 00:27:01.876
they have to deal with in school or on the job

00:27:01.876 --> 00:27:04.453
or in their family and social relationships.

00:27:04.453 --> 00:27:08.924
And it's most effective to be able to first of all

00:27:08.924 --> 00:27:12.058
have a very good evaluation, to understand exactly

00:27:12.058 --> 00:27:16.667
which problems with ADHD this particular person has

00:27:16.667 --> 00:27:21.590
and then to have the team of—if it's a child—

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.110
the child and the parent, and the doctor, in consultation

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:27.750
with the educators and teachers that are working

00:27:27.775 --> 00:27:30.333
with them—to try to assess what are the strengths

00:27:30.333 --> 00:27:33.618
of this child. That's our beginning point.

00:27:33.618 --> 00:27:38.123
What are the difficulties? And what plan can we put

00:27:38.123 --> 00:27:41.594
together which will allow us to be able to build on

00:27:41.594 --> 00:27:46.006
those strengths and help the child or the adult learn

00:27:46.006 --> 00:27:48.154
about ways of dealing more effectively

00:27:48.154 --> 00:27:50.859
with their difficulties so that they can succeed

00:27:50.859 --> 00:27:53.691
and reach their full potential.
