00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.860
Do you know, we've made something like 180 / 190 episodes of Grand Designs

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.879
I lost count, but one thing I do know is that this year we are 20 years old

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.970
So, how are we going to celebrate? Well, I'm going to share with the nation, with you

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:26.699
something which has remained until now a

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.279
relative secret

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.289
My favorite projects

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200
Hello and welcome to Grand Designs

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.700
The foundations of Grand Designs the series were dug and delayed two decades ago, presented by a keen

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.570
excitable young man. In this series, we'll be looking at very different projects built by a wide range of people

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.499
Looking each week at one house, from start to finish

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.970
The compelling power of that simple storytelling idea hasn't changed over the years, unlike its visibly aging presenter

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.380
So the reason I am still here and that I have a job is thanks to the infinite variety of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.340
buildings that there are out there to film, and great stories too. Having from filming villas

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.250
built beautifully from fiber reinforced concrete to, to

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:53.989
vaulting spaces entirely constructed from cross laminated timber, to mud huts stuck together with

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.510
straw and dog lick

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.520
From this great collection of vintage projects

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.709
I've distilled dams and flavors and mixed this heady Grand Designs cocktail for you

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.320
Get ready for some extraordinary stories retold now and then by our hero builders

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.699
So many people say to us "Oh it's yours, the house with the and the"

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.030
And it's not the one that failed that yes

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.920
We've been in the house now for a year and a half and

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.580
We pinch ourselves nearly every day

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.720
The house is imperfect as we are and that's pretty imperfect, so that's okay

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.940
We've had a tourist who said I have cycled all the way from Latvia. Can I come and look around the house? It's like okay

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:48.500
I've been following these grand designers for 20 years, and it's from over a

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.579
Mind-boggling a hundred and eighty episodes that I managed to choose five or so personal most loved projects

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:06.769
So the first on my simmered down reduced list of projects is a great favorite of mine

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.999
It's a project which I know very well partly cuz have been here so often

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.719
Probably the most visited of all the projects we've ever filmed

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.638
And I love it because it starts with the philosophy, a view of building

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.388
Based on craftsmanship, taking the materials out of the ground from the forests around you and building a house

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.909
predominantly with just those

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.579
I'd say that approach also means projects would take time, in this case

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.720
years

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.720
actually decades

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.138
First on my list is Mrs. Tiggy-winkles mansion

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.060
Otherwise known as Ed and Rowena's hand-built home on the hill

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.060
It's very flattering that kevin puts us in his top five, top five

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.830
He does

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:14.109
visit some fantastic buildings, and said to feel that we're one of those five top buildings for him is really flattering. It's lovely

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.150
Yeah, it's great

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.929
It was 12 years ago when I first met Ed and Rowena and their four children

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.649
I didn't know it at the time but this was going to be the beginning of an enduring friendship

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.709
So Ed, what are you gonna build on this site ?

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.880
A gorgeous house, of course

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:47.300
Ed's ambition was to craft by hand, a truly sustainable home with at its heart a great vaulted hall

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.940
The finest sculptural space I've ever witnessed being made

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.860
It would have been a real disaster if it had been crap

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.260
I soon realized that Ed's approach was unlike any other

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.430
organic

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.110
reflective

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.110
painfully slow

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.950
Well, I was like to think it's like an artistic installation I suppose it just and is grown in that way

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.609
the excitement of actually creating something

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.939
Sculptural and exciting and fun as well was really enjoyable

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.740
It's all very visual. Yeah, it's all very visual but and although experiential

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.080
Ed's been chiseling this crafted glory into being for over a decade

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.360
His children have grown up in a culture of designing, making, and making do

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.840
The benefits to a growing family are huge

00:05:52.580 --> 00:06:00.000
If you want shelter you can just create shelter you don't have to go and just buy it you can make it yourself

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:06.120
I think it's, and they just think that's normal. You know, that's and I think that's really good for them

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.180
I have loved returning over the years and across the seasons

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.520
Very good to see you. I see you dressed up

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.100
Falling in with their way of life

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.349
Seeing the children grow up

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:31.648
Marveling at Ed's latest inventions

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.360
Learning what homespun architecture is

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:44.400
And Ed is still building. Right now, it's a home for his mother. Is there a deadline attached to that? there is

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.960
there is. It's like a serious one

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.340
It's the first deadline you must have had in years

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:05.300
And the best thing about this everlasting project

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.200
Is the hospitality and welcome

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:17.240
You've been going since 2007, so almost as long as the series

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.640
projects come and they go they tend to stop and you move on or you do another one, but this one is

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.780
continues to grow

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:30.520
It's a way of life. This is where it has to evolve and adapt and accommodate change.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:31.320
Yeah

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.400
Like granny

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.420
This living breathing

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.649
Ecological self-build is a long essay or maybe a love letter to the beauty and nobility

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.560
of the well-made thing to invention

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:50.669
And to the joy that can be found in the everyday

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:57.359
And as it's grown, so it's changed to serve the needs of three generations now and again

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.560
This will be the sort of the main living area

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.820
This is great for once. I'm watching Ed under pressure

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.900
Do I have a bit of a divide between little bit of separation there?

00:08:10.539 --> 00:08:12.539
Where's my ever halt?

00:08:15.069 --> 00:08:18.689
This is why I keep coming back, to see things like this

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.089
To see the children come back, to see them grown up, and in this case Ed's mom

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:32.720
moving in. Clearly, she's committed to living this lifestyle. and that's a marker the success of the place

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:36.260
Amazing

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:43.520
This is one of my favorite grand desires. A wonderful place to be

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.080
I'd like to sum up

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:56.080
But I'm not going to because of course nothing is finished. And in any case, I'm coming back

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:09.340
The tranquillity here is of course in stark contrast to the trauma that many self builders endure

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.380
That didn't go well

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.580
I didn't enjoy the process very much

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.860
But that's okay, not everything have to make you happy

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.820
We've all been told to get off the site it could blow at any minute

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:37.580
I now feel like F the house, like really i'm so sorry

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:40.840
Been here 18 months now

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.380
I really wants to move in

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:47.140
That was probably one of the days where I thought, I've had enough of it

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.689
I thought i really like to wash my hair before being filmed

00:10:01.329 --> 00:10:03.310
You want to calm down

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.310
Easy for you to say

00:10:06.579 --> 00:10:07.779
Grand Designs

00:10:07.779 --> 00:10:11.398
Promotes the idea that self build is difficult

00:10:11.589 --> 00:10:16.919
It involves enormous commitment, a remarkable amount of time and energy

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:20.430
And i need to make an apology for them, because

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.320
Without effort there is no real reward. Without pain, there is no gain

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.240
Without sacrifice there can be no great triumph

00:10:34.629 --> 00:10:36.629
Oh my word

00:10:36.629 --> 00:10:37.140
Ooh

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.580
Oh gosh

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:40.640
Ooh

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:45.540
Bang that is beautiful

00:10:48.009 --> 00:10:50.099
After 20 years, I still gasp

00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:58.438
Great architecture continues to arouse us strong, a visceral reaction. Oh heavens. This is good. Aha, yes.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.280
Ooh my goodness

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:01.640
Ooh.

00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:02.620
Woah

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:07.620
Just, so smooth and beautiful

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.500
Nice building, sorry

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:13.920
Sorry

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:24.500
Of all the ground designs projects that i've filmed, there's one that still

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.909
amazes. The story of money and manpower

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:34.500
A building which took only nine months to complete but which cost millions?

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.760
And it really stands out

00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:39.709
Good grief

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.689
So, what makes a grand design huh? a building rising out of the ground, people

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.660
architects builders blood sweat tears

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.140
Mud

00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.220
Bank, ruins, potholes, ruins of it

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.720
Passion, naivety. We are house building virgins, and God help us

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.480
running out of money

00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.520
sacking the architects

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.880
Baby, and caravan

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:19.820
What is it with babies. I follow a project halfway through

00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.280
A baby arrives

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:24.290
Nothing to do with me

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:25.649
Umm

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:31.060
I can't imagine anyone even having time to have sex. Yeah. It's too exhausting

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:39.880
But in the end if we're lucky, truly inspirational extraordinary architecture

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:51.300
Well, I've teased you long enough. Here's another favorite a big sticky out project that marks the hundredth episode of Grand Designs

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.120
Here we go

00:12:54.240 --> 00:13:02.800
A gargantuan salvage project that cost enough to make your nose bleed. The monumental Kennington water tower

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:15.220
Seven years ago, it was a ruined Victorian Gothic landmark an unstable one of that almost beyond hope

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:18.720
This is something else this building, isn't it?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:25.960
How many people do you know that lives in a water tower in zone one? Good, maybe good reason for that a

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:32.109
A sane person, if they'd seen this building would have run because it was up for sale for six months

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.650
and why didn't anyone buy it because

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:39.429
Nobody was as loopy as me and thinking it was gonna be easy would only cost two million pounds and even the architect thought nobody

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:40.880
Would do it

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.189
It was a filthy, but valiant struggle to save the tower

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:52.179
The important conservation thing is you know that it's been secured for the next 150 years

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:56.470
so that really matters to you that sense of legacy almost doing something which actually makes

00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:59.520
Makes a contribution and adds value to future generation. Yes

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:10.380
Conserving the old and building the brand spanking new turned out to be obscenely expensive

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:16.320
When you're really spending money it's about 35,000 a week at the moment

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.309
It's just become a nightmare because there's all the huge bills are now coming in and

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:27.349
I'm trying to get all my all the credit cards and the limits increased so we can finish the job

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:39.239
Crazy but in just nine months they proved doubters of which I was one, wrong

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:43.260
This was a truly jaw-dropping home

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:52.049
Ka-ching. It's a six-man bath and a shower. Well it's nice for the local rugby club realm won't you?

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:59.440
At the end of the project us in debts of nearly everybody I knew, in a hundreds and millions

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:07.720
It may have come at great cost but it's no modern-day folly it's one of the most dynamic

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:11.800
Intelligent restoration projects. I've had the pleasure to follow

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:26.280
What is actually an unchanged building it so it is as pristine as, umm

00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:32.180
When I saw it last. Seven years. Seven years ago. It's looking great as I say until you've changed both of you

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.809
Yes good or bad. No. No. No just a little bit more astute a bit more Hairy

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:47.910
I love this project for its heroism because Graham and Leigh dared to risk all and save a brooding monster

00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.419
Tame it and transform it into a shining example

00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:56.500
I like it cos, it's meaty

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.309
Because it's not just about exciting contemporary new build

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:06.810
It's also a proper project about conservation and it marries the two and it turned out you did it all in what?

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:13.410
Nine months, huh? Yeah, you know and it cost a fortune and that that of itself. I've never said how much it cost

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:18.210
No, like we could all guess. it's interesting why people are so interested what it cost doesn't matter what it cost

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:20.309
It's here and I got and I got through it

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:21.960
You were cute, right?

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:28.199
I mean, so I'm interested in the value of it socially here the value of it to you guys to the surrounding neighborhood

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:30.899
Yeah, all of that stuff matters and you saved a building in the process

00:16:34.450 --> 00:16:41.549
There is a lot of press about this house and about us I thought the interest would maybe die after about a week and

00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:44.520
It hasn't and it still going on

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.610
There on TV on the first and the Saturday morning, I think first proper weekend

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:57.539
Walked in to the kitchen here in it wasn't it wasn't a complete love actually moment in my underpants Ruggles

00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:00.809
I was in some, you know messy bridge on the type of things, you know

00:17:00.810 --> 00:17:05.220
And that lifted these blinds and there must have been 50 people outside all starting to take photos of me

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:10.110
And I thought I'd have enjoyed it. But I would have I look if I looked fabulous, but I didn't

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:14.780
And it didn't stop for weeks and weeks and weeks

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.980
Good dude how many floors

00:17:26.689 --> 00:17:28.689
Oh what a reward

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:31.840
Wow

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:39.040
This doesn't disappoint does it, ey? No. A few new arrivals on the horizon well very much

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:46.749
So 360 degrees actually so differents when we built it what's popped up and what's gone and what's coming and this was of course

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:50.290
We're sitting in what was the water tank? It was originally full of water

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:56.739
And when we first came here, it was a grim black dark space for the pigeon crap

00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:03.980
Good grief. Kevin don't get stuck because i'm not sure I'll get you out

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.580
It's vast. it sort of seems three or four times as big as the rooms downstairs

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:20.860
Oh my god, this will make the most fantastic room look at the roof, this is amazing

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.889
I'd never been in this room until we climbed up this huge tube, which was here and I was

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:31.060
Amazed at the size of it and thinking how we ever gonna convert this into a room

00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:36.819
It's just it's still amazing it's not everybody's cup of tea

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:43.030
No, but it's still so unique and so unusual and I'm just so lucky. We've been living here for so long

00:18:43.030 --> 00:18:46.420
So happy yeah, long may that continued.

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:49.930
you did think on the first when he met us the first time our a

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:53.710
Relationship wouldn't last there's gonna be all sorts of problems, but we got through it still here

00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:59.780
I don't remember saying any such thing. I've watched the episode a few times. I haven't

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.180
Over the past 20 years

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:15.879
The projects we filmed involving old buildings that get restored or repaired or we used. Some of the most entertaining

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:23.890
Rich in complexity full of intrigue and it has to be said there are the projects that usually Harbor

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:26.259
the nastiest surprises

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.940
I'd always might the idea to convert a church

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:45.780
But how much do you pay for this? Uh, four hundred thousand pounds. For this? Yes

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:06.410
It's easy to say isn't it that in order to build a grand design you need deep pockets and a big budget that it's the

00:20:06.410 --> 00:20:08.779
preserve of the moneyed middle classes

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:15.060
Except that it's not about how big a budget is, it's about how big your vision is

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:24.200
That's what makes a grand design, and next on my list is a man who embodies that who against pain and adversity

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.840
carved for himself a modest wonderful home

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:37.660
I think a good home should reflect somebody's personality and I think it should tell a little bit of a story of

00:20:38.289 --> 00:20:42.539
You know that person's life and that's certainly how my home means

00:20:47.889 --> 00:20:50.369
Wow, oh my lord

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:54.330
Welcome to the rock house

00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:59.279
Reactions from all my friends and my family when I showed it to that. I think the general

00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:02.309
Feeling was that I'd probably lost my mind

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.159
But I think it's because people couldn't see what I could see

00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:13.049
Despite having been diagnosed with MS

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:19.949
Angelou said about turning these long abandoned cave dwellings in the forests of Worcestershire into a home.

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:31.319
I think I was probably you know a little bit naive and I think that that in some situations is a good thing

00:21:32.889 --> 00:21:36.989
It was an epic tale of man against rock

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:41.260
I definitely physically suffered in the process. Yes

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.260
Had a terrible ringing in my ears for six, eight months afterwards

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:53.100
My right elbow had some kind of nerve damage and I couldn't even put my elbow on the dinner table

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:55.420
Not the way you meant to do that anyway

00:21:57.300 --> 00:22:03.120
I dont know how he does it because each of those pieces weigh at least 10 kilos

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:10.700
Yeah, i'll try it. Right, your turn then Kevin. Okay

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:16.240
I mean Kevin definitely got stuck in

00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:24.080
We did a sterling job when I was most impressed that he tidied up after himself as well

00:22:29.540 --> 00:22:32.140
He toiled in atrocious conditions

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:37.789
So I was keen to see these efforts rewarded and they were. He achieved

00:22:38.399 --> 00:22:40.399
'Cave Man Chic'

00:22:42.690 --> 00:22:44.690
Hello

00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:51.350
Oh you. it's delightful, Fred Flinstone would be very happy here

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:58.200
This is the nicest room isn't it, just beautiful

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:02.500
Angelo took the most unpromising hole in a rock and

00:23:03.179 --> 00:23:07.219
Transformed it through force of character into a noble dwelling

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:14.679
I think secretly I like to think Kevin was you know, behind me from the beginning

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.900
I think he saw he saw what I saw maybe

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.180
one of you

00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:31.989
What I found so life-affirming about Angelo's story is that although he was very mindful of his

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:35.260
diagnosis he was determined not to be

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.909
Defined by it

00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:39.909
And you know over the years

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:45.400
There have been many examples of projects where the process of building but also the finished

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:52.539
House that the architecture itself has demonstrated a profound ability to improve people's lives

00:23:55.909 --> 00:24:01.029
John White, A forces veteran built a home that gave back his independence

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:05.720
This is something stunning has come out of something pretty horrific

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:14.000
And the parents of children with some life-threatening allergies built a pioneering healthy home

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:22.200
That's actually grotesque. People come around and asked to see our filters, which is weird

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:28.820
But more importantly the children are doing so well, thank you for asking

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:40.280
One of my favorite grand designs that deserves special mention is a project in brighton built twenty years ago by ten

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:44.680
households who were waiting for council homes. It was astonishing

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.320
They don't want to build just houses. They want to build a community

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.540
They became the hedghog housing Co-op

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:59.780
I'm standing now on frame two of my house. This is my house. This is a grand moment

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:05.059
Debbie's has gone up this one and then next come tomorrow and honors and then Paul and Jenny's

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:08.479
That's the last frame to go up top of the world. Fantastic

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:15.170
They used the architect Walter Siegel's construction system to learn skills

00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:22.729
Empower themselves and help build each other's homes. In so doing creating the magic social glue

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:24.730
That is the foundation of community

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:30.059
How many of the households that moved in are still in those same houses? All of them

00:25:30.059 --> 00:25:34.408
Yeah? Seriously, it would be utterly crazy to leave here

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.289
I was hoping to follow many more projects like this

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:47.339
Turns out that wasn't the case at all. turns out actually they're very rare. They're quite precious things. It's a shame because

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:52.289
I found it inspirational and I think we could be doing more of that kind of thing

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.960
It demonstrates it to me

00:25:56.169 --> 00:26:03.209
The great architecture and the process of making place can be something that really does change people's lives

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.100
Nice mahogany boudoir

00:26:14.769 --> 00:26:19.979
You know, we have a great tradition in this country of eccentricity which for 20 years

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:24.539
It's been my pleasure to mine. I've met some really great oddballs

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:28.200
Building some really quirky homes

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.940
What earth possessed you to sell your beautiful house and want to live in that figure

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:43.099
Are there any other lifeboat stations that have been turned into houses I sincerely hope not

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.959
The plan has always been no windows at all

00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:53.240
We're gonna build a house that can actually flow so an amphibious house

00:26:55.020 --> 00:27:02.580
Eccentricities quite a strong word. So I personally don't consider myself eccentric, nor a bit eccentric

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:08.380
What's, Where's he from? He's from South Africa

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:13.459
He's Willy is like sort of plumb-line it so is his dead center of that panel at the back

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:16.220
Spot on

00:27:18.059 --> 00:27:24.559
It's the Scooby Doo door. The white sofa Brigade can go and stuff it as far as I'm concerned

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:31.440
I suppose the opposite to eccentric is normal, and I'd hate to be called normal

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:45.440
You said that the building shouldn't have any horribleness about it and I have yet to discover the lumps

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:46.180
Good.

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.190
And you know

00:27:50.190 --> 00:27:56.220
My favorite projects are not just my favorite pieces of architecture. They also involved my favorite people

00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:01.980
They're the projects that leave a lasting impression. They are in a way,

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.400
my most favorite adventures

00:28:06.419 --> 00:28:11.819
I had no doubt in putting one creative coupled adventure on my list of favorites

00:28:13.179 --> 00:28:17.608
When I think about it, I'm amazed that we live here and then I'm amazed

00:28:17.609 --> 00:28:21.869
It's our home and then I'm constantly reminded of that when people come and visit or you know

00:28:21.869 --> 00:28:27.119
You buy something on the internet and a delivery person turns up and they go. What is this place? Do you live here?

00:28:27.119 --> 00:28:29.119
And you kind of go. Yeah, I do

00:28:30.549 --> 00:28:35.398
I first met Ben and Freddie both renowned artists 10 years ago

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:41.309
These mad collectors of ephemera, souls their cramped London home to take on a vast

00:28:41.739 --> 00:28:44.909
16th century barn in the Essex countryside

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:51.389
Its scale was really intimidating and their approach nothing short of harebrained

00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:57.929
It's not a house in the traditional sense of having an upstairs. No downstairs. We're predominantly gonna live in it at ground level

00:28:58.809 --> 00:29:00.669
So it's to be a bit more like living in a Cathedral

00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:07.589
We definitely didn't want to build a four bedroom family house inside a barn. Yeah, no trees in pots. No hanging baskets

00:29:07.710 --> 00:29:10.799
No, no, but definitely not home in terms of a notification

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.440
Not interested in that

00:29:16.309 --> 00:29:23.109
Everything about this project was overwhelming. It's the size of seven three-bedroom houses

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:27.760
And what they wanted to preserve at the barn bordered on

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:34.329
What happens to this air duct? Does that stays? That stays. For the chain the chain?

00:29:35.059 --> 00:29:39.069
And a bit of stream. Well, how does that stay? Yeah

00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:48.720
I had one problem with this project. You cannot make a big open space like this cozy

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.620
I don't want a cozy home

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:57.160
I don't want to live like most other people live. I don't want just that kind of life

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.420
I don't want that kind of building. I want something other. Why?

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:04.660
Because I'm putting difficult and demanding of the world and myself and life

00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:13.990
This mammoth job proved intellectually, physically, my special croquette technique

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.000
And financially exhausting

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:28.260
Everything is not just double, it's exponentially more expensive

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:35.800
We held on earth but there was no choice it's not even if we didn't want to hold on earth

00:30:35.809 --> 00:30:39.909
There was no choice about it. It's like it's like you have to come out the other end

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:48.800
Two and a half years and eight hundred and fifty grand later they had fused the ancient with the

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.500
Idiosyncratically modern into a home. I thought full of autobiography

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:05.980
Whoa, wait, look at this for a place. This is not as I would have imagined it. This is very cozy

00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:09.580
It is, yeah

00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:22.880
I loved this project because Ben and Freddie true to their word could have lightly preserved a beautiful 16th century barn

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:31.260
It's just an amazing building. I mean it was an amazing building before we converted it. And so and it's still an amazing building

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.350
I

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:42.870
Admired the ingenious roof lights made from expanded steel mesh and clear of critic panels to bring filtered light into the barn

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.650
beautiful

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:52.259
They meticulously took apart and reassembled two giant concrete grain silos to form bedrooms for themselves and their daughter

00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:57.240
Is like they have a medieval castle staircase at the bell tower

00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.280
And they made spaces for themselves to work in and

00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:06.209
spaces to exhibit their extraordinary collections. Weird objects do finish a room

00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.260
Weird objects make a home cozy

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:12.480
hmm

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.520
Kevin is impressively professional

00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:20.550
I mean there were things about our lifestyle is not that the clutter think you wasn't that keen on but

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.019
By clutter Ben means our collections. Yes, not me a clutter. No

00:32:26.170 --> 00:32:32.759
objects that we've collected off he wasn't that keen on fact they gave him the women where I think

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:42.570
How do people react to it. Well people they tend to either really love it really really hated really really yes

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:48.680
It functions as a home for us because we're a family of three

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:54.040
Idiosyncratic people. I don't think it's right for everyone, but we didn't build it for everyone. We only built it for us

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:55.960
So that's okay, isn't it?

00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:05.200
In 20 years, there's been no better illustration of what happens when the creatives are allowed to run wild

00:33:07.300 --> 00:33:13.600
If you're blessed with such talents no project is too daunting no space too vast

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:22.339
It's very liveable, I mean there are weird things but it's there it's warm and the rain doesn't come in. Yeah

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.859
And there are lots of toilets there, that's great and you can see out

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:36.199
You may think it's too quirky, but it's a favorite of mine and I like their collections

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:40.400
Anyway, everyone will have their own memorable project.

00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:48.740
I love the one where he was a joiner. So that was his craft, but he built this beautiful kind of hexagonal shaped house

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:54.199
With this marvelous kind of twisted staircase built around his oak tree

00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.500
That looked fabulous

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:02.719
There was the one with the vast brick arch

00:34:04.049 --> 00:34:06.049
really rather lovely

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:09.709
the world's largest single spanning timber vaulted arts

00:34:11.070 --> 00:34:13.070
The world's last Guinness Book of Records. Oh

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:23.419
The one that I really loved was the guy who lived in the woodland and managed the woodlands

00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:27.229
The integrity of that that project was just something else

00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:37.109
The one build that I really remember is a very elderly couple who put up a huff house. Oh, yeah

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:42.360
Amazing to see how that was built and put together and that was I think absolutely fascinating

00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:50.320
Because for me one of the most exciting days of my life, I never believed they would do that much in one day

00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:59.320
It's really staggering when you think 16 years later people still remember that program

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:04.320
Lovely to bits. Do you tingle?

00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:12.080
I always tingle. It's perfect. Perfect for us

00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:17.420
So it's the end of part three

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:23.979
But after the break the reveal of one last house, we all love the reveal because that's that

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:25.320
That's the moment of triumph, isn't it?

00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:30.840
That's the moment of how far they got, did they finish it and won over that they put in their properties.

00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:37.600
It's the feel-good extravagance or isn't it is the finale where we think. Wow, you know, it's amazing

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.560
It's like oh my gosh, it looks like that. Isn't that amazing?

00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.980
I didn't think was going to look like that and of course then you realize what bad taste people have

00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:00.460
Early morning mist hangs in the valley

00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:07.440
Dewdrops shimmer on a cobweb, the Sun bursts through leafy trees

00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.440
The teasing glimpse of a finished house

00:36:15.070 --> 00:36:17.070
Obscured by the foreground

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:20.070
Then another

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:27.700
Who's this? a man with just the hint of a receding hairline

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:35.440
Wearing a well-chosen scarf approaches stops. Oh my word. Looks up

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:37.840
Wow

00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:42.059
Music shifts up the gears, the camera swoops and soars

00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:48.340
Glass glimpse, and

00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:56.040
The fruits of months and years of toil are finally revealed

00:36:57.770 --> 00:37:01.479
Oh this is another world ain't she

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:10.449
The more observant among you will have realized there is still time to visit one more of my top homes

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:17.230
So I've come all the way to rural Northern Ireland to share with you a

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:21.939
fabulous building I have to say it's probably

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:25.930
My favorite you bet if I had a favorite

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:28.570
It might be this one

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:37.680
Oh

00:37:41.210 --> 00:37:43.210
This is great

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:51.760
Into the fairy Kingdom has landed quite gently something from Battlestar Galactica

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.840
It's magic this place if anything I think

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:11.079
It was nearly six years ago that I first met the farmer and architect Patrick Bradley, is this it that's it

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.720
This is magic

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:20.439
This beautiful spot on his family farm was to be the location of an award-winning piece of architecture

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:27.039
The dream was to build a house by the river. That is a big thing for Patrick chef containers

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:32.230
As everybody keeps telling me it's impossible

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:37.360
Itself build easy know

00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:41.349
If it's easy you're cheating. I was lucky

00:38:41.350 --> 00:38:47.140
You know, we got the land took a gamble and then cuz me being an architect as well. Just I'd be putting more excitement

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:53.589
Patrick's ambition was just to build a home his mother Anne wanted much more for her son

00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.890
I am desperate for him to get a gorgeous Joe

00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:01.300
It's an appeal it's an appeal

00:39:03.870 --> 00:39:07.109
I thought this was a disaster in the making

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.920
20 legs

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:12.460
Well

00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:15.119
Never Lauria staff commentary yard before

00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:20.309
With the potential to ruin the most idyllic spot on the family farm

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:24.360
They're not very pretty either. Just other than that pretty

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:29.519
Patrick faced a desperate uphill struggle as we say to win over his doubters

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:35.609
Anybody who lives here is gonna look at that and thinks themselves. Oh, well, they put the porch cabins up

00:39:35.610 --> 00:39:37.610
When are they gonna build the prison?

00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:41.850
It really needed to be up cycling at its most inventive

00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:50.340
Turning 10 grands worth of ugly metal shipping containers

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:56.700
Into an architectural delight

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:06.090
Everybody thought it was completely completely. Haha. You know what?

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:10.110
It's actually part of the charm, you know, because I always knew what the Virgin was going to be

00:40:15.089 --> 00:40:20.719
This is just wow, this is just brilliant this is this is my boy

00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.329
You know, this is so good

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:33.349
It was built in under ten months and for just a hundred and thirty three thousand Patek made a home that can make hearts saw

00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:44.129
With not a single whiff of grotty shipping container it gets top marks from me almost faultless

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.009
Today five years on I'm back

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:06.049
Statue of a dog at the front transfix Burmese lovely to burn. It's great to have you back

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:16.459
After the program aired Patrick was inundated with hundreds of requests from all over the world to design container homes

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.190
How many container houses if you desert?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.180
Zero apart from mine

00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:29.690
The biggest negative container houses people can't get a fondle because there's no companies

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:36.409
I'd both fondle because they don't see it as the national construction. The mortgage companies interesting and Australia's appointment

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.410
I mean, you know the whole point about Miss

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:43.279
Extraordinary project is to demonstrate its sustainability its versatility. It's affordable

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:48.529
there's so many advantages to using these things, you know Scot ranching and there's absolutely gut-wrenching but

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:52.310
That's the banks for you

00:41:54.570 --> 00:42:00.019
However Patrick continues to pioneer the use of this versatile building system

00:42:00.810 --> 00:42:02.810
So this is your new

00:42:03.089 --> 00:42:04.500
absolute unity

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.250
container clearly 45 and you've even managed to

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:11.569
Bolt it down at weather to get a big overhang at the other y'all love the cantilever

00:42:13.109 --> 00:42:15.409
Love it love the cladding - in goes

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:19.279
It's great because again, it's surrounded by gorse bushes

00:42:23.849 --> 00:42:28.879
- how are you? Good? Thanks. Are you yeah. Yeah. How many are you in the practice? Then? There's the three of us, okay

00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.910
Nice. Yeah, what's brilliant? Sure. Imagine coming here every day to work. I'd sure look at the view either way

00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:37.010
We just just imagined us to come

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:47.659
This is the gist of Elms, it's a great thing to be pushed out into the landscape and

00:42:50.849 --> 00:42:57.349
Patricks succeeded in building lightly and beautifully on the planet, but there was one thing on a

00:42:58.079 --> 00:43:01.669
Personal level that his mum was desperate to see him achieved

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:07.219
We had a conversation however at five six seven years ago and you said to me

00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:12.589
If it you didn't say to me you turned to camera and you

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:15.980
You made an appeal. Oh heavens

00:43:16.859 --> 00:43:21.318
It worked. They didn't it right wall has come Victoria. We shouldn't later

00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:31.369
The most amazing thing either appearing in ground the same was definitely meeting Victoria death mother

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.920
Victoria's changed his life Kevin

00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:36.140
And for the better

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:41.809
She is perfect. You know, I don't think anything can be better right now. You don't think we could be happy right now, man

00:43:42.569 --> 00:43:44.569
Is missing part of the ejector

00:43:48.719 --> 00:43:50.719
That's just good

00:43:54.809 --> 00:43:57.018
You mean been together what for three years? Yeah and

00:43:57.749 --> 00:44:03.948
Get married next year. No. Yes, wonderful Oh, congratulations. Thanks very much. Thanks very much

00:44:05.369 --> 00:44:07.968
Absolutely tough for you. You invite me to the wedding, of course you

00:44:10.589 --> 00:44:13.968
Know camera you have to say yes, not the best mind. You can be the page boy

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:23.900
Did you ever see the program we made about Patrick in this house, of course I watched the program

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.740
I even know where I was or sitting on a pink sofa with my friend in London

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:30.979
and we boys turned each other and something it was like

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.590
That's your future husband. You joke, I'm not joking ever. Well. Did you fall in love with the house or with him?

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:46.939
This project is so close to my heart

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:52.640
Inventive low-energy and low impact and it's not just a beautiful house

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:58.939
Its architecture that actually enhances the beauty of its setting

00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:06.679
It's been wonderful to revisit some of my favorite buildings from over the last 20 years

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:11.630
And this has been perhaps the most touching story to finish with

00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:14.480
so thank you for

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.140
Indulging me well, that would be weird wouldn't it if you agreed with all of my choices?

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:23.930
Because I know you have opinions

00:45:24.930 --> 00:45:30.560
but one thing is absolutely for sure and that is that self build in Britain is now a

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:34.130
National movement more people are doing it than ever before

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.060
Which means?

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:37.380
we need

00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:43.579
Our exemplars we need our pioneers and our eccentrics to continue building. So I

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:45.810
salute the

00:45:45.810 --> 00:45:47.070
experimentalists

00:45:47.070 --> 00:45:49.070
long may they flourish and

00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:51.710
Long may we continue to film?

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.760
What a wild reducible place to glue the house I

00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:11.870
Think we all need to abandon this position and get downstairs

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.450
We're gonna overspend by hundred thousand pounds. Oh, yes

00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.509
I wasn't expected to be that bad. I hope

00:46:22.810 --> 00:46:27.449
All of this can at any moment be swept away by the forces of nature

00:46:29.619 --> 00:46:35.969
So brand new grand design starts next Wednesday at 9:00 also new Phil and Kirstie and a property unicorn

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:39.720
They've been told to find they can handle next Wednesday at 8:00

00:46:40.030 --> 00:46:46.919
But coming up daunting for some but not for a lady who is beaten cancer and can still sing a hymn whilst choosing her date

00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:49.349
naked attraction
