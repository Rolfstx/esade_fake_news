00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:03.670
-President Trump made up
another weird thing

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.572
about a foreign country while
attacking a retired Admiral

00:00:06.572 --> 00:00:08.674
for not getting
Osama bin Laden sooner.

00:00:08.674 --> 00:00:11.210
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.082
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:19.185
Whether you believe Donald Trump
colluded with Russia or not,

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:23.289
whether you consider him a
threat to democracy or not,

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:29.696
one thing I think everyone can
agree on is that he is weird.

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:32.465
He is a weird man.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.202
Just a flag-hugging,
umbrella-ditching,

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:40.272
can't do a normal handshake
kind of weirdo.

00:00:40.272 --> 00:00:42.375
And one of the weird little
things about

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.144
Donald Trump's presidency is
that every few months or so

00:00:45.144 --> 00:00:47.580
he concocts a bizarre lie
about another country,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.149
and then everyone in that
country has to figure out

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.384
what the hell
he's talking about.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:54.653
Remember when he did it to
Sweden last year?

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:58.357
-You look at what's happening
last night in Sweden.

00:00:58.357 --> 00:01:01.961
Sweden, who would believe this?
Sweden.

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:04.764
-Now, those words about Sweden
sparked a quick backlash

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:07.300
with officials in that country
who wanted to know

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.969
what he was talking about
because there was no attack

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.437
in Sweden the previous night.

00:01:11.437 --> 00:01:14.106
-This was front-page news here
on Monday,

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:18.011
it's also been the subject of a
significant amount of ridicule

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:21.680
online and people you talk to
here making jokes, you know.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.183
What was Donald Trump
referring to last night

00:01:24.183 --> 00:01:26.352
when he spoke on Saturday,
jokes like,

00:01:26.352 --> 00:01:29.088
"Hey, did someone take
all our Swedish meatballs?"

00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.857
-Okay, but please don't
joke about it

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:34.961
because then Trump will think
you're serious

00:01:34.961 --> 00:01:36.996
and start repeating that, too.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:39.432
-Immigrants are
sneaking into Sweden

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.834
and stealing their meatballs,
folks.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:46.605
And it's very upsetting to their
celebrity chefs.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:49.142
He called me last night.

00:01:49.142 --> 00:01:52.945
He called me on the phone last
night and he said,

00:01:52.945 --> 00:01:56.516
and these are his exact words,
he said to me,

00:01:56.516 --> 00:01:58.751
"Schmorgity, borgity,
borgity, borg."

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:05.692
And you know, it's so true.
I said it's so true.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.292
Seriously, you know it's bad
when even the Swedes

00:02:07.292 --> 00:02:08.694
are mocking us.

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:12.799
This would be like Ikea changing
their instructions to this.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.200
[ Laughter ]

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.402
Then Trump did it again
in September

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:19.672
when he went to the U.N.
and said something about Germany

00:02:19.672 --> 00:02:21.774
that was
so detached from reality,

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:25.077
even the German delegation
couldn't help but laugh at him.

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:30.950
-Germany will become totally
dependent on Russian energy

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.487
if it does not immediately
change course.

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:41.293
Here in the Western hemisphere
we are committed to maintaining

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:45.197
our independence
from the encroachment

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:48.134
of expansionist foreign powers.

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.702
[ Laughter ]

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.238
-Not only
are these dudes laughing,

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.207
but look at this lady's face.

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:56.376
[ Laughter ]

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:59.478
She doesn't know what the hell
he's talking about

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:02.682
and she's from a country where
this is a real word.

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.485
[ Laughter ]

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:09.321
And then there's one of Trump's
weirdest recurring lines,

00:03:09.321 --> 00:03:11.557
that he has a friend
in Paris

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:15.094
who keeps telling him that Paris
is no longer Paris.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.263
-I have a friend, every year he
goes to Paris.

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:18.731
I haven't seen him in awhile.

00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:20.433
Paris, oh, the city of lights.

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:23.469
He's told me for years,
Paris, Paris.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.238
I see him, like, a month ago.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.673
"How was Paris this summer?"

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:28.908
"I don't go to Paris,
are you kidding me?"

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:32.110
I have a friend used to go to
Paris, loved Paris.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.780
I said to him recently,
"How was Paris this summer?"

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.383
"He said we don't go to Paris."

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:39.285
He said,
"Paris is no longer Paris."

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.086
Which is obviously true.

00:03:41.086 --> 00:03:46.058
I have a friend, he's a very,
very substantial guy.

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:48.761
He loves the city of lights.
He loves Paris.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:52.030
And I said, Jim,
let me ask you a question.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.499
"How is Paris doing?"

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.968
"Paris?
I don't go there anymore.

00:03:55.968 --> 00:03:58.337
Paris is no longer Paris."

00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:02.341
-I feel like what happened here,
is Trump went to Paris,

00:04:02.341 --> 00:04:05.945
met a mime, and misinterpreted
what he was saying.

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:11.083
My friend Jim told me immigrants
are climbing,

00:04:11.083 --> 00:04:15.254
they're climbing into Paris --
They're trying to pull.

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:18.291
The police are trying to pull
them out, but they can't,

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:20.926
and that's why, you know,
they need, you know.

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:23.029
They need a wall.

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:29.002
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:33.672
I'd rather talk to a mime than
an American who calls it Pa-ris.

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:37.609
He's telling me Pa-ris, Pa-ris.

00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:39.378
So if you're keeping track,
Trump he made up

00:04:39.378 --> 00:04:40.579
a fake terror attack in Sweden,

00:04:40.579 --> 00:04:42.348
claimed Germany
was captive to Russia,

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:44.116
and said Paris
just doesn't exist anymore.

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.652
And Trump did it again over
the weekend when he traveled to

00:04:46.652 --> 00:04:48.955
California to survey damage
from the wildfires there.

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:50.656
He made a very strange claim

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:53.559
about how they prevent
forest fires in Finland.

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:56.796
Watch as your deeply weird
President stands awkwardly

00:04:56.796 --> 00:04:59.798
to the current incumbent
governors of California

00:04:59.798 --> 00:05:04.403
and rambles, incoherently, like
he just overdosed on SUDAFED.

00:05:04.403 --> 00:05:08.107
-I'm committing to make sure
that we get all of this

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.008
cleaned out and protected,

00:05:10.008 --> 00:05:13.145
Gotta take care of the floors,
the floors of the forest.

00:05:13.145 --> 00:05:15.214
It's very important.

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:18.984
You look at other countries
where they do it differently,

00:05:18.984 --> 00:05:21.387
and it's
a whole different story.

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:23.989
I was with the president of
Finland and he said,

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:26.759
"We have a much different --
we're a forest nation."

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:28.594
He called it a forest nation.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:31.164
And they spend
a lot of time on raking

00:05:31.164 --> 00:05:35.034
and cleaning and doing things
and they don't have any problem.

00:05:35.034 --> 00:05:38.871
And what it is,
it's a very small problem.

00:05:38.871 --> 00:05:42.007
I know everybody's
looking at that to that end.

00:05:42.007 --> 00:05:46.512
And it's going to work out.
It's going to work out well.

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:51.183
-Look at everyone else trying
not to look at him.

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:53.952
They all look like parents at
the grocery store

00:05:53.952 --> 00:05:56.923
Whose toddler just said,
"Daddy, that lady is fat."

00:05:56.923 --> 00:06:06.098 line:85%
[ Laughter ]

00:05:56.923 --> 00:06:06.098
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:06:06.098 --> 00:06:09.268
If you didn't know
Trump was president,

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:13.439
you'd think he was a weirdo who
just walked up to them

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.775
from his trailer in the woods.

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:17.743
He's going to be
covered in leaves

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:19.745
and holding
a giant walking stick.

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:24.416
You got to rake the floors!

00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:26.152
You got to rake the floors
of the forest!

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:30.322
[ Laughter ]

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:36.462
That's what my friend,
Nutty the squirrel, told me,

00:06:36.462 --> 00:06:39.432
isn't that right, Nutty?

00:06:39.432 --> 00:06:40.833
Can we go back to
this real quick.

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.234
-You got to take care of the
floors.

00:06:42.234 --> 00:06:44.403
You know,
the floors of the forest.

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:47.773
-Why does he call it
the floor of the forest?

00:06:47.773 --> 00:06:49.342
It's the ground.

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:50.776
[ Laughter ]

00:06:50.776 --> 00:06:55.915
Does he also call the sky the
ceiling of the Earth?

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.116
The more he talks,
the clearer it is

00:06:58.116 --> 00:06:59.852
that he has never been outside.

00:06:59.852 --> 00:07:01.287
[ Laughter ]

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:07.393
These wildfires, the floor is
filthy, now we got to mop it up.

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:12.664
We'll also be replacing these
wood columns with steel beams.

00:07:12.664 --> 00:07:17.636
And as you can see,
the roof is gone.

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:20.806 line:85%
And of course, once again --

00:07:17.636 --> 00:07:20.806
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:24.877
Once again it happened with
Sweden, Germany, and Paris,

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:28.014
the president of Finland
had to come out

00:07:28.014 --> 00:07:32.218
and publicly clarify that he did
not, in fact, tell Trump

00:07:32.218 --> 00:07:36.255
that people in his country rake
the floors of the forest.

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:39.258
-The President of Finland says
he did discuss

00:07:39.258 --> 00:07:42.328
the California wildfires
with President Trump,

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:46.064
but he doesn't quite recall
the conversation the same way.

00:07:46.064 --> 00:07:48.600
He said they did talk about
California's wildfires,

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.304
and some of the ways that
Finland maintains the forest,

00:07:51.304 --> 00:07:55.374
but raking did not come up.

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:56.909
-Keeps happening.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:59.044
Trump makes up something insane
about another country

00:07:59.044 --> 00:08:00.779
and then the president
of that country

00:08:00.779 --> 00:08:02.547
has to come out and say
it's not true.

00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:05.117
We're like a week away
from the president of Romania

00:08:05.117 --> 00:08:06.952
calling a press conference
to say,

00:08:06.952 --> 00:08:10.989
"I did not tell President Trump
that vampires are real."

00:08:10.989 --> 00:08:15.794 line:85%
And again...

00:08:10.989 --> 00:08:15.794
[ Applause ]

00:08:15.794 --> 00:08:19.331
And again, just as
the Germans laughed at us,

00:08:19.331 --> 00:08:21.934
and the Swedes made fun of us,
the Finnish people are now

00:08:21.934 --> 00:08:24.003
mocking Trump's comments on
social media,

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:25.303
like this woman who tweeted

00:08:25.303 --> 00:08:28.140
"Just an ordinary day
in the Finnish forest."

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.244
with a picture of herself
vacuuming the ground outside.

00:08:32.244 --> 00:08:35.348
You mean that? That's pretty
good. That's very good.

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:38.851
Can we see real quick the German
reaction to that?

00:08:38.851 --> 00:08:41.020
There you go. They like it.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.322
Trump has to concoct fantastical
lies like this

00:08:43.322 --> 00:08:45.591
because they reinforce his
diluted world view

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:47.726
and they're easier to swallow
than reality,

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:50.763
and in this case the reality is
that man-made climate change

00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:52.898
is making these fires more
frequent and extreme,

00:08:52.898 --> 00:08:54.967
but Trump would rather make up
an insane fantasy

00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:57.036
about firefighters
raking forest floors

00:08:57.036 --> 00:08:59.171
than admit that
climate change is having

00:08:59.171 --> 00:09:00.740
deadly real-world consequences.

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.142
Just watch this exchange
from an interview "Fox News"

00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:04.310
aired over the weekend.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:06.445
-I was watching the firemen
the other day.

00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:08.113
And they were raking areas.

00:09:08.113 --> 00:09:11.317
They were raking areas where the
fire was, right over there.

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:14.186
And they're raking trees, little
trees, like this, --

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:18.524
not trees, little bushes, that
you could see are totally dry.

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:22.093
Weeds. And they're raking them.
They're on fire.

00:09:22.093 --> 00:09:26.364
That should have been all raked
out and cleaned out.

00:09:26.364 --> 00:09:28.433
-What about the argument it's
climate change?

00:09:28.433 --> 00:09:29.868
That it's drier,
it's hotter,

00:09:29.868 --> 00:09:31.537
and that that's contributing
to it?

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:33.372
-maybe it contributes a little
bit.

00:09:33.372 --> 00:09:35.341
The big problem we have is
management.

00:09:35.341 --> 00:09:38.010
You need forest management.
It has to be.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.312
I'm not saying that
in a negative way,

00:09:40.312 --> 00:09:41.814
I'm just saying the facts.

00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:43.449
And I've really learned a lot.

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:45.317
-No, you haven't.

00:09:45.317 --> 00:09:49.855
Though in fairness,
if you don't know anything

00:09:49.855 --> 00:09:54.727
and then you learn one thing,
it seems like a lot.

00:09:54.727 --> 00:10:01.033 line:85%
[ Laughter ]

00:09:54.727 --> 00:10:01.033
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:10:01.033 --> 00:10:02.801
The president
is a conspiracy theorist

00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:04.837
who makes up cartoonish lies
about everything

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.138
from wildfires to immigration.

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:08.106
And when you call him out, he
attacks you.

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:10.042
Just take retired Admiral
William McRaven,

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:12.678
a Navy SEAL who oversaw the raid
that killed Osama bin Laden.

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:15.014
McRaven has criticized Trump's
attacks on the press

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:17.015
and in return,
Trump decided to insult him.

00:10:17.015 --> 00:10:21.219
-Bill McRaven, retired Admiral,
Navy SEAL, 37 years,

00:10:21.219 --> 00:10:22.955
former head of
U.S. Special Operations.

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:25.424
-Hillary Clinton fan.
-Special operations --

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:27.159
-Excuse me,
Hillary Clinton fan.

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.928
-Who led the operations,
commanded the operations

00:10:29.928 --> 00:10:33.032
that took down Saddam Hussein
and killed Osama bin Laden

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:34.733
says that
your sentiment is

00:10:34.733 --> 00:10:37.502
the greatest threat to democracy
in his lifetime.

00:10:37.502 --> 00:10:43.175
-He's a Hillary Clinton backer
and an Obama backer.

00:10:43.175 --> 00:10:45.510
And, frankly --
-He's a Navy SEAL.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.380
-Wouldn't it have been nice
if we got

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.314
Osama bin Laden a lot
sooner than that.

00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:52.751
-You're attacking him for not
getting Osama bin Laden sooner?

00:10:52.751 --> 00:10:55.887
Oh, because I totally
could see you charging in there

00:10:55.887 --> 00:10:58.090
in your hat
and your wind breaker,

00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:00.059
swinging a rake
like it's a sword.

00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:07.032
Where are you? Osama? Osama!

00:11:07.032 --> 00:11:10.870
I'm gonna --
I'm gonna rake your floors.

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:14.105
[ Laughter ]

00:11:14.105 --> 00:11:16.475
Trump then went on
to claim that it was obvious

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:18.477
to everyone
where bin Laden was hiding,

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:22.114
and also found a way
to work in a very strange dig

00:11:22.114 --> 00:11:23.516
at bin Laden's compound.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:25.684
-Think of this,
living in Pakistan,

00:11:25.684 --> 00:11:28.019
beautifully in Pakistan
in what I guess

00:11:28.019 --> 00:11:31.523
they considered a nice mansion,
I don't know, I've seen nicer.

00:11:31.523 --> 00:11:32.824
Mm.

00:11:32.824 --> 00:11:34.993
You can make
this idiot a president

00:11:34.993 --> 00:11:37.762
And everything still
comes back to real estate.

00:11:37.762 --> 00:11:40.099
It's in a little neighborhood in
the middle of Pakistan,

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:41.901
I call it Mid-Pac.

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:43.568
[ Laughter ]

00:11:43.568 --> 00:11:45.137
The Mid-Packing district.

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:54.580
[ Laughter ]

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.715
Only Donald Trump.

00:11:56.715 --> 00:11:59.484
Only Donald Trump can make
himself feel better

00:11:59.484 --> 00:12:02.687
by implying he has a nicer house
than Osama bin Laden.

00:12:02.687 --> 00:12:04.990
Bin laden's already one of the
most hated evil people

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.759
in the history
of human civilization.

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:11.397
You're not, like, burning him by
saying he has a crappy house.

00:12:11.397 --> 00:12:12.864
Who's Trump gonna go after next?

00:12:12.864 --> 00:12:14.533
You know,
people make fun of my hair,

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:16.335
but it's much nicer
than the Unabomber's.

00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:20.372
[ Laughter ]

00:12:20.372 --> 00:12:22.808
We have a president who concocts
outlandish lies

00:12:22.808 --> 00:12:25.310
and spreads conspiracy theories
and attacks anyone

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:27.246
who calls him out,
and all the while

00:12:27.246 --> 00:12:29.081
the rest of the world
laughs at us,

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.849
from Finland to Germany to --

00:12:30.849 --> 00:12:32.851
-Sweden!

00:12:32.851 --> 00:12:34.820
-This has been "A Closer Look."

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.757
[ Cheers and applause ]
