00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:09.580
Capitalism is unstable, capitalism is unequal, and capitalism is fundamentally undemocratic.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.680
I want people to make their own choices about how they live their lives, the professions they lead,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.660
where they want to work, and what they do. And capitalism offers that potential.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.680
Slavery it did it with masters and slaves, feudalism did it with lords and serfs,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.980
capitalism does it with employers and employees.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.780
Capitalism, private property, is necessary although not sufficient to a free and open society.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:52.540
Please come up to the stage debaters two young men in the prime of their lives, Richard Wolff, who will be

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:59.480
who will be defending the proposition socialism is preferable to capitalism as an economic system

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.540
that promotes freedom equality and prosperity.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.840
Gene Epstein will be taking the negative on that. Each candidate, the way this will work

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.860
is that each debater will have 17 and a half minutes, and that last thirty seconds

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.040
when it comes you'll understand why it's there, but each of them will have 17 minutes and 30 seconds

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.880
to lay out an initial case. They'll do five minutes each of rebuttal.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.980
I'm gonna beat them up a little bit with a moderators prerogative on some questions,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.740
then we're gonna open it up to 30 minutes or more of audience Q&amp;A.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.400
Five minutes each of closing statements—seven and a half and again those 30 seconds,

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.440
you know this is where the world changes in those 30 seconds,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.460
and then we will take another vote, and we'll see who is the big winner.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.280
Gene could you please—and if you haven't voted yet, you've got about five seconds to go.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.740
Please make a vote. Either vote for the proposition, against it, or undecided.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.620
You need to vote now in order to vote later. And without further ado let's have Richard Wolff come up

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.520
and explain to us why socialism is preferable to capitalism

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.400
as an economic system that promotes freedom, equality, and prosperity.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.480
Richard Wolff you have the stage.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.980
Thank you all for coming I assume that socialism is the reason

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:40.280
that you came either for it or against
it and I hope that the things I have to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:49.370
say will make some sense of it for you I
did want to comment on the notion that

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.700
Reason magazine is free and that the
understanding Marxism book costs money

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.299
and I want to urge you not to invert
from the price what the values of these

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:08.599
things are that would be a mistake it
would be confusing the price with the

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.920
value and for those of you that know
something about socialist theory that's

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.730
something you want to avoid okay

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.650
socialism preferable to capitalism my
basic argument is that's a very low bar

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:33.579
that's not asking much and I want to
make that case as strongly as I know how

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:38.900
but I have a problem in the very
beginning as I always do traveling

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.739
around this country talking about this
and that is we are like bears in this

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.880
country coming out of a hibernation
about seventy years of it since 1945

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.590
when everything changed from in a
society in which socialists communists

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:04.690
Marxists occupied all the normal
positions in society as teachers and

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.260
workers and bureaucrats and unionists
when we had a new deal that celebrated

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.359
many of the objectives socialists have
always supported it is across the United

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.940
States had a big picture over the war
the clerk's office where you bought

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:31.039
stamps and there was Uncle Sam with his
hat arm and arm with Uncle Joe which

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:34.450
stood for Joseph Stalin

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:42.370
after that there was not so surprisingly
a terrible reaction the business

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:50.410
community and the right-wing in America
was horrified that for the 1930s we had

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.990
had a program of raising taxes on
corporations and the rich in order to

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.970
fund the creation for the first time in
American history of Social Security

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.889
unemployment compensation the first
minimum wage and a public employment

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:12.400
project that hired fifteen million
people the rich had to pay and the mass

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.819
of the Americans got the benefits this
was so horrific it freaked out the

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:24.130
forerunners of the Koch brothers and
then an alliance with the Soviet Union

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.919
finished off whoever wasn't freaked out
already

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:37.030
and so in 1945 everything had to be
undone New Deal coalition for those of

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.780
you who remember your history socialists
communists the CIO unions representing

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.280
tens of millions of American workers
they're the ones that made all that

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.380
happen they are the ones that made
Roosevelt do all those things and they

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:59.169
had to be defeated and they were the way
you break up a coalition is you find the

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.759
weakest link or what you can make out to
be the weakest link and suddenly

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:09.969
communists and socialists who had been
the militants making the 1930s the

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.680
greatest unionization period in American
history they never had anything like it

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:20.979
before we've never had anything like it
since communists had to be transformed

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.780
and likewise socialists from the great
allies in the war from the great

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.500
Vanguard of social programs in the 30s
they became agents of a foreign power

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:39.099
likely to be interested in strangling
your cat and they had to be driven out

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:44.110
of a unions at nineteen forty-seven
taft-hartley driven out of their

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.830
teaching jobs driven out of the
consciousness

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:53.200
of the American people who were
terrorized about being interested in

00:06:53.200 --> 00:07:01.000
those things as they have mostly been in
the last 40 50 60 70 years a personal

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.710
note when I went to college as a young
person I was interested in learning

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.980
about Marxism and I asked my teachers in
the university what course can I take to

00:07:11.980 --> 00:07:16.780
learn about Marxism half my teachers
explained to me there isn't any nobody

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.220
here knows anything about it the other
half said oh we know about it but we're

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.770
way too scared we're not going to teach
you anything about it in my

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:32.680
undergraduate and my graduate years and
I majored in economics I'm an economics

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:43.930
professor here's a fact no one ever in
any economics course assigned me one

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:50.500
word of Karl Marx is that because he had
nothing to teach us don't be silly

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:59.110
they were just afraid 75 years of fear
there's nothing smart and nothing

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:05.440
excusable in any of that oh and let me
mention since it might be of some

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.670
interest to you
the three schools I attended were

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:16.000
Harvard Stanford and Yale and if they
don't have the courage what can you

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.590
expect from Eastern Kentucky so I have a
problem to talk to you about socialism

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:28.360
because unless you are a very unusual
American and there are some or a

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.830
foreigner because the situation is
different abroad you don't know much

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:40.000
about socialism or what you do know is
75 years out of date because it's

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.820
changed a lot as I'm going to point out
to you as I go through the argument ok

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.000
let's do it
socialists disagree they always have

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.350
from the beginning
socialism is a product of capitalism it

00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:02.140
always was there was no socialism before
capitalism came into being

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:07.150
why because capitalism in the French and
American revolutions made a big fat

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:12.190
promise when it asked people to leave
the feudalism that existed before and

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:17.380
shift over to capitalism it made the
promise as in the French Revolution that

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:22.620
capitalism would bring with it liberty
equality fraternity and let's add

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:32.290
democracy and prosperity socialism is
the movement that recognizes that what

00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:40.450
capitalism promised liberty equality
fraternity and democracy wasn't

00:09:40.450 --> 00:09:48.100
delivered and never was and the
socialism is a movement which if it has

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.320
anything in common among its different
tendencies is a notion that we can do

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:58.630
better than capitalism it's a yearning
to do better it's the kind of yearning

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:05.200
slaves had to go beyond slavery or serfs
to go beyond feudalism employees and the

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:10.060
people who empathize with them figure we
can go better and do better than

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:16.780
capitalism that's what socialism is
beyond that socialists agree about three

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:23.320
four floors failures of capitalism and
again briefly to go through them but

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:31.890
they're three capitalism is unstable
capitalism is unequal and capitalism is

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:39.850
fundamentally undemocratic let me
briefly explain unstable every 47 years

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:45.430
in every capitalist country on average
there's an economic downturn not due to

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:49.990
nature and not due to war just built
into the system it's called the business

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:55.840
cycle because it always comes back
millions of people lose work businesses

00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.000
go out of business a crazy crash you
know what it's like if you pick up the

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.080
financial press you know we're waiting
for the next one to hit this year or

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.210
next mr. Trump's biggest worry about
being reelected is that it'll happen too

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:19.660
soon he worries as we all do
it's an unstable system that's crazy

00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:25.990
to live in a Sun stable system if you
live with a roommate as unstable as

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:34.300
capitalism you would have moved out long
ago what an amazing thing to accept a

00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:39.280
system that every four to seven years
threatens millions of people with

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:45.760
unemployment lost income interrupted
vacation interrupted education lost

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.830
mortgage you name it then let's do the
next one

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:57.940
inequality Oxfam in England keeps track
of these things and the latest number

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:03.250
from them summarizes it all the 80 or 90
richest people in the United States

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:09.070
together excuse me in the world have
more wealth than the bottom half of the

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:16.440
population three and a half billion
people that's the achievement of

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:23.220
capitalism that kind of distribution if
you took away half the wealth of those

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:29.050
eighty to a hundred people guess what
they'd still be the richest people in

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:33.580
the world only you'd now have a vast
amount of money to deal with the

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:38.470
sickness the lack of education the
absence of water the insufficiency of

00:12:38.470 --> 00:12:47.920
food of the vast majority of people what
an achievement such inequality and now

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.200
finally the lack of democracy the part
of it you probably know and thought

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.950
about is the buying of our political
process on display every day everywhere

00:12:59.950 --> 00:13:06.250
you all see it you all know it but
here's a part of the lack of democracy

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:13.630
you might not have thought about long
ago we got rid of kings queens we

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:17.770
decided we didn't need somebody sitting
at the top of society telling us all

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.780
what to do so that we would all be or
let's call it subjects that's what they

00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:28.780
called us so we got rid of the kings and
queens and we said no you know we can we

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:33.580
run this in a different way this
political system we can all get together

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:39.400
we can periodically vote and take steps
and collectively make the decisions that

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:45.580
used to be in the hands of the kings and
the queens how interesting

00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:52.000
we democratized at least a little the
politics and what we didn't do was to

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.450
democratize the economics so what do we
have inside each enterprise a little

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:07.630
king an owner a manager a Board of
Directors a king in his Court who run

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:11.410
everything will make all the key
decisions what to produce how to produce

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:15.790
where to produce and what to do with the
profits everybody in the enterprise

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:23.440
helps to produce if it's too difficult
for you to hear me out then it's a sign

00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.870
that I'm getting to you thanks we're
good

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:34.270
please keep going please please hear a
professor wolf please respect professor

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:36.510
wolf

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:43.570
we don't have democracy in our
workplaces we never did the commitment

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:49.630
to democracy is verbal in this society
limited to that voting activity where we

00:14:49.630 --> 00:14:57.090
live but not where we work and as adults
that's where we spend most of our time

00:14:57.090 --> 00:15:04.060
going to work being at work and
recuperating from work in the workplace

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:11.530
no democracy at all we do what we're
told what we produce belongs to somebody

00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:17.320
else and we have no say over what they
do with it how this is organized what

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:24.160
the technology is and socialists
therefore have said my god we can do

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.930
better than capitalism and that's what
they want and that's what they agree on

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:34.480
but here's where the disagreements how
do you go about it what do you do and we

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.220
have a benefit socialists do today we
have some experiments that were made in

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:45.430
the 20th century Russia China Cuba
and so on and we learned from those

00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:52.090
experiments what works and what doesn't
what should be pursued and what should

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:57.490
be set aside and so the new socialism
and if you're not aware of it that has

00:15:57.490 --> 00:16:01.210
to go back to what I said at the
beginning you haven't been keeping up

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:08.080
which is hard to do in a society which
makes socialism a taboo what has

00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.640
happened to socialism is a refocusing of
itself it's not interested so much in

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:19.240
the state doing things that achieved
rapid rates of economic growth true

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.010
enough but it also left too much power
in the hands of too few people and that

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:29.230
has to be addressed and dealt with which
socialists have been doing and the new

00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:35.830
focus a new focus of socialism is to do
something at the workplace that was

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:39.600
never done
to go beyond capitalism in the

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:46.270
organization of the workplace to
democratize the workplace to make where

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:52.450
we spend most of our adult lives at work
a place where democracy reigns where all

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:57.340
the people who work in an enterprise
participate in making the decisions of

00:16:57.340 --> 00:17:01.450
what to produce how to produce where to
produce and what to do with the profits

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:06.970
because if they all together made those
decisions we wouldn't give some people a

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:11.620
hundred and fifty billion dollars and
other people have to borrow money to get

00:17:11.620 --> 00:17:17.050
their kid through college we wouldn't
have the inequality we certainly

00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:22.500
wouldn't allow the irrationality of
every four to seven year instability

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:27.310
everybody together would choose a
technology that isn't dangerous to the

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:33.850
health of all of us at the workplace we
could go beyond the capitalism but we

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:39.940
have to have the courage to do what was
not yet done not in Roosevelt's New Deal

00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:46.780
and not in Russia or China either the
transformation at the base of society

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:52.870
into a Democrat eyes workplace that's
the new direction of socialism

00:17:52.870 --> 00:17:59.240
that's where socialism will be in
21st century that we are now entering

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:06.410
it's a new and a different socialism it
has learned from its own earlier

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:14.220
experiences and experiments two little
footnotes capitalism did not emerge out

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:22.650
of feudalism all finished in one swell
foop did it if you know the history

00:18:22.650 --> 00:18:25.950
you'll know that capitalism started in
this town in that town in that village

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:29.360
in that area often it didn't last more
than a few weeks or a few months

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:33.300
sometimes a few years and then it was
crushed by feudalism and they had to

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:38.600
figure out how to survive and they had
to get together it took centuries

00:18:39.050 --> 00:18:44.370
socialism isn't born all at once either
it makes its early experiments it had

00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:48.600
won in the Paris Commune in 1870 and
then it had some other experiments in

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:54.270
the 20th century that I've mentioned and
just like with capitalism you learn from

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:58.950
your experiments how to make it better
next time how to correct the mistakes

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:05.090
you made in the project that has
animated socialists from the beginning

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:13.230
we can do better than capitalism and
there is no reason that the human

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:19.040
progress that took us beyond ancient
villages and tribes and slavery and

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:26.520
feudalism should imagine itself to have
stopped at this point every other system

00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:34.230
was born evolved and died capitalism we
know was born and evolved I'll leave it

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:41.750
to your inference as to what it is doing
now thank you

00:19:46.149 --> 00:19:54.429
right thank you Richard Wolffe follow
him follow him on Twitter at at Richard

00:19:54.429 --> 00:20:00.879
D wolf with two EPs and now taking the
opposite side is Jean Epstein follow him

00:20:00.879 --> 00:20:06.539
at Gina at Jean Soho for him
Jean Upstate what is he

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:15.740
by the way there are seats up front for
people who are in the back and I want to

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:19.520
apologize to professor Wolff for that
outburst that was very brewed we don't

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.559
run the Scylla forum that way and and
thank you for professor Wolff for being

00:20:24.559 --> 00:20:29.950
gracious about that well let me start it
is a pleasure to share a stage with

00:20:29.950 --> 00:20:38.000
Richard Wolff who I consider my alter
ego in a parallel universe we both came

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.510
of age as socialists in my case from age
1 since my mother was a card-carrying

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:49.429
member of the Communist Party and I have
our FBI file to prove it

00:20:49.429 --> 00:20:54.650
you could always tell who the FBI agents
were in the party because they were the

00:20:54.650 --> 00:21:01.070
only ones who paid their dues on time
Richard Richard paid his dues by getting

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:07.250
an economics PhD at Yale followed by a
career advocating socialism I paid my

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.710
dues by evolving into a different kind
of radical a bleeding-heart

00:21:11.710 --> 00:21:17.919
freedom-loving advocate of capitalism I
believe that even the deeply flawed

00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:23.540
capitalism we have now heavily distorted
by a government interference on behalf

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:30.140
of the powerful is preferable by far to
Richard's socialism in promoting freedom

00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:36.410
prosperity and equality
Richard bears a very heavy burden of

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:40.190
proof because his socialism has never
existed

00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:46.730
he repudiates my mother's Soviet Union
my mother's favorite Cuba he has indeed

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:51.650
called these systems state capitalist
I'm glad he's learned from their

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:56.900
mistakes since their mistakes has in
fact of course cost the blood of tens of

00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:02.660
millions of innocent people he wants the
economy as he explains in his book

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:09.200
democracy at work a cure for capitalism
he wants the economy reorganized around

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.750
workers self-directed enterprises in
which employees owned and democratically

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:20.240
run companies and keep the broadly
defined profits or surplus that normally

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:27.020
go to the employers I fully support
what Richard calls employees becoming

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:34.160
their own employers so long as people
freely choose that arrangement Richard

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:39.140
thinks such firms are a substitute for
capitalism but there are actually just

00:22:39.140 --> 00:22:45.260
another option that capitalism offers
nothing about the system of practicing

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:50.900
of protecting property rights of firms
in a free market dictates how these

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:56.810
firms must be structured Richard himself
has written about the quote varying

00:22:56.810 --> 00:23:02.270
kinds and degrees of democracy in the
workplace which already exist based on

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:08.690
these cases he observes quote workplace
democracy responds to deep needs and

00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:13.310
desires
unquote but these deep needs and desires

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:19.070
seem to run only skin-deep Richard has
written that in today's worker owned

00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:24.680
enterprises quote it might be legally
possible for worker owners to transform

00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:29.060
the enterprise so that they become not
only owners but also collectively

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:34.310
directors
however he concedes that has very rarely

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:41.150
happened well no doubt it very rarely
happens because workers very rarely want

00:23:41.150 --> 00:23:46.460
it to happen but the move to workers
self-directed enterprises can happen in

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.290
the capitalist system if workers do want
it to happen start with the fact that

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.950
the bottom half of the population
accounts for one third of all consumer

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:59.300
spending the bottom four fifths for
nearly two-thirds give adding up to

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:04.100
trillions of dollars per year on the
investment side there's over a trillion

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:10.880
dollars in labor union pension funds
domestically and an estimated forty 40

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:15.830
trillion a worldwide held by living in
pension funds all this financial

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:21.230
firepower could be marshaled to make
workers self-directed enterprises the

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:28.070
dominant mode of production and it would
be true to the 1960s view that radical

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:31.310
change
must be implemented by the same people

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:37.190
who seek to be the embodiment of that
radical change but being willing

00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:42.889
of workers to follow the Marxist
playbook is as old as Marxism itself

00:24:42.889 --> 00:24:48.369
around 1980 democratic socialists like
Michael Harrington and Tom Hayden

00:24:48.369 --> 00:24:53.869
advocated a bottom-up socialism similar
to Richards but they acknowledged that

00:24:53.869 --> 00:24:58.249
without the coercive power of government
worker owned enterprises quote are

00:24:58.249 --> 00:25:05.149
almost impossible to get off the ground
as two of them wrote Richard might argue

00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:09.669
that it's okay to use government power
to try to jumpstart workers

00:25:09.669 --> 00:25:15.859
self-directed firms since government
often rigs the game anyway but a Marxist

00:25:15.859 --> 00:25:21.679
like Richard should be deeply troubled
by the old contradiction of radical

00:25:21.679 --> 00:25:26.479
change from below being being
implemented by the force of government

00:25:26.479 --> 00:25:32.419
from above and beyond that he would use
government to socialize finance and the

00:25:32.419 --> 00:25:37.989
allocation of labor that's why he and I
are taking opposite sides in this debate

00:25:37.989 --> 00:25:43.090
he advocates a full-blown form of
socialism that will put freedom

00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:50.359
prosperity and equality under siege just
like the old socialism's did but let's

00:25:50.359 --> 00:25:54.739
go all the way with Richard and assume
that a socialist political party wins at

00:25:54.739 --> 00:25:59.269
the ballot box with two-thirds of the
electorate voting for its candidates

00:25:59.269 --> 00:26:04.700
since two-thirds is normally interpreted
in politics as a mandate the government

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:11.450
makes Richards socialism a reality but
voting for a radical idea in a voting

00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:18.049
booth is very different from a full and
active commitment to that idea so let's

00:26:18.049 --> 00:26:23.960
not assume that the 2/3 have anticipated
the real consequences of what they voted

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:30.080
for Richard writes that apart from doing
our assigned jobs workers would each be

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:35.119
quote democratically and collectively
given fully equal participation in

00:26:35.119 --> 00:26:39.710
decision-making over their own
enterprise and over the broad economy

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:47.570
unquote he adds somewhat ominously quote
no one could work without engaging in

00:26:47.570 --> 00:26:51.240
both roles
there will be a need for financing under

00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.350
Richard socialism both to create new
worker owned companies and to provide

00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:00.590
funds for enterprises that want to
expand they quote obvious alternative

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:06.770
writes Richard to the existing sources
of finance is quote socialized banking

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:12.450
consisting of quote workers self workers
self-directed enterprises where workers

00:27:12.450 --> 00:27:17.880
and communities affected by bank
policies together direct and operate

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:23.730
banks so Richard would shut down the
nearly fifty billion raised annually

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:27.420
through crowdfunding and the several
hundred billion raised through various

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:32.370
forms of venture capital and Finance is
not the only function he would relegate

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:38.790
to the power of politics he also
proposes a quote specialized agency that

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:44.520
would quote always know from constant
monitoring monitoring which existing

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.020
enterprises need more laborers which
have registered the wish to commence new

00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:53.490
production all the relevant skill and
experience requirements and where

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:58.830
effective laborers and enterprises are
located unquote he adds that the

00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:04.740
agencies reports would be submitted to
all workers to aid them in making their

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:09.510
decisions notice that he's talking about
knowledge of the relevant skill and

00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:15.270
experience of 160 million workers in the
US across hundreds of thousands of firms

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:20.370
that's information the specialized
agency will quote always know from

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:24.720
constant monitoring from my work
experience I can tell Richard that those

00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:29.220
constant monitors who keep coming around
will be the butt of jokes and the

00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.210
information they come away with will be
superficial when it isn't totally

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:38.550
misleading so in Richards world will be
recorded to our assigned jobs attend

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:43.170
meetings about company matters and vote
on the outcomes will also have to pour

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:47.430
over the reports of the labor allocation
financial agencies and then discuss

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:51.630
their recommendations with many others
and vote on those outcomes

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:56.730
I submit that only in a dystopian
nightmare can most of us imagine

00:28:56.730 --> 00:29:00.970
ourselves spending our waking hours in
this way is

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:06.100
since the vote of any of us any one of
us can hardly determine the outcome

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:12.850
anyway Richard approvingly uses the
1960s term participatory democracy in

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:16.539
which we each get to participate
actively in democratic decision-making

00:29:16.539 --> 00:29:22.750
in a 1970 book called after the
revolution sociologist Robert Dowell

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:27.789
explained the arithmetic --all
unworkability of this idea if each

00:29:27.789 --> 00:29:32.530
attendee at a meeting were given just
ten minutes to address the issue of

00:29:32.530 --> 00:29:37.929
being voted on it would take ten hours
to move on to the next issue provided

00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:44.500
there were only 60 people at the meeting
but let's take this leap and assume the

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.940
participatory democracy would be
functional many firms seeking to expand

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.419
their operations will have to borrow
funds from their democratically run

00:29:52.419 --> 00:29:57.220
financial agencies while also applying
to the democratically run run labor

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:01.809
allocation agency for more workers and
these democratically run agencies will

00:30:01.809 --> 00:30:07.480
be ruled by the vote of the majority but
to pick up on an objection raised by

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.940
Atlantic magazine journalist Conor
freeters Dorf we might ask how easy will

00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:17.980
it be to get the democratically run
finance and labor allocation agencies to

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:23.020
support the expansion plans of firms
that produce muslim prayer rugs and

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:29.020
quran's and the building of new mosques
freeters Dorf goes on to ask would you

00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:33.970
prefer a socialist society in which
birth control is available if and only

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:39.700
if a majority of workers exercising
their democratic control a sense or

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.840
would you prefer a society in which
private businesses can produce birth

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:50.320
control in part because individuals
possess economic rights as producers and

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:55.690
consumers the preferences of a majority
of people around them be damned

00:30:55.690 --> 00:31:01.720
unquote freedom self question applies to
the related issue of freedom of speech

00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:07.960
and press would you prefer a socialist
society in which dissenting journalism

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:14.270
is available if and only if a majority
of workers exercising their democratic

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:19.970
agrees or would you prefer a society in
which private enterprises can produce

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:25.160
dissenting journalism the preferences of
a majority of people around them be

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:31.640
damned so at best our freedoms would be
circumscribed by the tyranny of the

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.410
majority but we don't have to press this
decisive objection

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:40.760
since the overwhelming likelihood is
that elected representatives and their

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:45.200
appointees will have most of the real
power there won't be enough hours in the

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:49.910
day for us to even be aware of the
thousands of decisions being made each

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.929
day on our behalf
special interests will form around these

00:31:53.929 --> 00:31:58.580
centres of power and as Friedrich I act
accurately predicted about conventional

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:04.130
socialism the worst will get on top
because power-hungry people are mainly

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:10.910
the ones who end up on top our most
beloved living ex President Barack Obama

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:16.340
was called by the New York Times
journalist James risen quote the

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:20.480
greatest enemy of press freedom in a
generation

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:26.360
unquote as left-wing journalist Glenn
Greenwald has pointed out Obama used the

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:32.630
archaic 1917 Espionage Act to prosecute
more journalists including James risen

00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:39.650
than all previous presidents combined so
freedom of speech and press is a fragile

00:32:39.650 --> 00:32:45.800
thing constantly being Assent assaulted
on all sides and especially by

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:51.190
government if you magnify the reach and
power of government under Richards plan

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:58.130
politicians in power can stifle dissent
by stealthily denying funds and labor to

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:02.920
enterprises that put out information
that government doesn't want published

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:07.510
now take the issue of prosperity take
the force that brings prosperity

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:12.940
innovation or what economist Joseph
Schumpeter called creative destruction

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:17.900
Richard thinks that as long as people
can be offered another job they'll agree

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.650
to giving up their current job to allow
creative destruction to happen

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:27.690
but since people naturally resist change
efforts at major or even minor change

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:32.670
would likely be thwarted by special
interests reluctant reluctant to give up

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:37.980
their established positions
imagine the response if Steve Jobs

00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:43.110
sought funding for a smartphone that
would also replace a flashlight a watch

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:49.700
a camera a compass a calculator a
recorder CD player and GPS navigator

00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:55.410
threatening the industries that turn out
those products the pattern of

00:33:55.410 --> 00:34:00.059
obstruction will be emboldened by the
malla by the knowledge that most new

00:34:00.059 --> 00:34:04.460
ideas fail and few succeed in a big way
anyway

00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:08.639
policies toward imports could make
Donald Trump look like a free trader

00:34:08.639 --> 00:34:12.810
Wednesday when consumers voted with
their dollars to buy Japanese cars

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:16.980
because the cars were better made and
lasted longer there was a market in

00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:21.270
place that made it hard to stop the
imports but in a politicized environment

00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:25.620
the threatened industries would find it
easy to prevent the foreigners from

00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:30.389
selling us the cars the planners will
have a perfect excuse for rejecting any

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:35.970
project or proposals they don't like the
economic reality of scarcity by

00:34:35.970 --> 00:34:40.470
yesterday I mean the fact that what
everybody wants always adds up to more

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:44.159
than there is so they can reject
proposals they don't like on the

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:49.919
reasonable grounds that the resources
are simply not available so freedom and

00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:55.350
prosperity would both be under siege in
Richards system of socialism on

00:34:55.350 --> 00:35:01.110
inequality as Noam Chomsky has pointed
out you can find income equality in a

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:05.070
prison where power is quite unequal and
political power

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:11.550
will be more unequal than even under a
flawed system of capitalism the floor

00:35:11.550 --> 00:35:16.140
system we have is preferable by far to
what Richard proposes in terms of

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:21.090
freedom prosperity and equality because
we have so many avenues of private

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:27.150
funding dis dissident publications like
the intercept Jacobin magazine Reason

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:33.000
magazine books like by Richard Wolff and
a debate series like the solo forum can

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.710
persist because we have private funding
and reasonably functionally consumer in

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:42.780
capital markets innovation that brings
prosperity can persist and even flourish

00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:47.310
and on income inequality the turned
toward capitalism in countries like

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:52.800
China and India has lifted hundreds of
millions out of grinding poverty and is

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:58.260
therefore meant a narrowing of income
inequality globally but I began by

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:05.520
saying this is a flawed system riddled
with with crony capitalism Richard

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:11.370
mentioned the instability of the US
economy indeed it is unstable

00:36:11.370 --> 00:36:17.010
I read Richards analysis and as far as I
can understand he believes that the

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:21.750
Great Recession was triggered by the
fact that the consumer was tapped out

00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:25.890
the consumers could no longer afford
what they were buying well if he looks

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:31.350
at the data he'll find that just before
the recession happened consumer spending

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:38.070
continued to rise that was in the fourth
quarter of 2007 what he ignores what he

00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:43.770
ignores was the crony capitalist policy
of government through the Federal

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:52.170
Reserve that brought that awful event so
I I'm Jean Epstein and I'm here to

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:58.800
recruit you yes we have yes we had a
flaw at capitalism but in order to make

00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:03.750
it a better capitalism we have to do a
lot of radical things including

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:10.440
including reining in the power of the
Federal Reserve that does indeed cause a

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:16.020
bank banking cart cartel and brings
instability in this economy maybe we can

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:21.800
talk more about those things later on
thank you very much

00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:27.600
all right

00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:34.670
Thank You Jean I've seen the debate is
joined now we're going to have five

00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:37.880
minutes of rebuttal
each gentleman I'll suggest that you say

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:43.520
seated and use hand microphones you want
to go to the podium okay we can we

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:49.280
cannot keep these guys down so we won't
try Richard you have your option I just

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.359
want to remind people of a couple things
one is remember that the proposition the

00:37:53.359 --> 00:37:58.970
resolution under debate is socialism is
preferable to capitalism as an economic

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:04.130
system that promotes freedom equality
and prosperity follow Richard Wolff at

00:38:04.130 --> 00:38:10.819
Richard d Wolfe with two F's follow Jean
Epstein Jean sohe form follow me at Nick

00:38:10.819 --> 00:38:17.559
Gillespie follow the sohe form at the so
a forum follow Reason magazine at reason

00:38:17.559 --> 00:38:27.680
Richard Wolff please you have five
minutes to rebut

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:34.740
listening to gene makes me realize that
a book that you write is a little bit

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:39.390
like a child that you have you think
it's yours and then you watch as it

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:43.560
becomes its own thing and is understood
by other people in ways you never

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:49.710
imagined I cannot recognize 3/4 of what
he said it sounded to me like quotes of

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:55.770
somebody I didn't even want to meet I'm
not proposing a kind of socialism I

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:59.579
don't believe in looking into the future
and telling you what the society ought

00:38:59.579 --> 00:39:02.550
to be
people who tell you the future are

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:06.660
usually found in carnivals you pay them
a little bit of money they tell you who

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.440
you'll be sleeping with in two weeks and
you giggle if you actually take

00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:17.130
seriously what they've proposed you need
help I'm not proposing what a socialism

00:39:17.130 --> 00:39:21.210
would look like
number one I'm talking about how you get

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:28.349
beyond what we have because like in all
societies you are either satisfied with

00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:34.740
the way things are or you're looking for
how to make them better if there's a

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:40.020
genius in the United States it's been
that we've been willing in many areas to

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:46.650
do better but there's a taboo when it
comes to economics represented by what

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:51.150
gene said that you really shouldn't look
at that because it's only going to get

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:56.670
worse those nasty politicians will do
all the terrible things that should make

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:02.849
you stay with what you have oh yes
tinker with the Federal Reserve or here

00:40:02.849 --> 00:40:07.710
but don't change the fundamentals where
did that come from

00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:12.329
where did the economic system get a pass
we debate about family life we debate

00:40:12.329 --> 00:40:17.010
education we debate our transportation
system but debate the fundamental

00:40:17.010 --> 00:40:21.119
structure of capitalism which is not
about markets and not about the

00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:25.319
government but how you organize the
production and distribution of the goods

00:40:25.319 --> 00:40:30.359
and services without which you cannot
live slavery did it with masters and

00:40:30.359 --> 00:40:36.089
slaves feudalism did it with lords and
serfs capitalism does it with employers

00:40:36.089 --> 00:40:40.560
and employees
and the whole purpose of my book and the

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.940
work that we do and the New Directions
of socialism is to question and

00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:50.300
transform that no more group of
employers telling us all what to do and

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:56.570
employees living in that undemocratic
workplace and the whole notion of

00:40:56.570 --> 00:41:01.050
controlling the government so it doesn't
oppress you in all the ways that Jean

00:41:01.050 --> 00:41:07.620
likes to enumerate is to create a social
force at the base of society that could

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:15.510
possibly prevent that and making the
mass of people in the workplace have the

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:20.640
final say and power over what that
workplace does means you don't have a

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:24.780
small group of people in a government
cutting a deal with a small group of

00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:30.050
people called employers at the expense
of a large group of people called

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:37.170
employees that's the transformation at
the base of society that will mark the

00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:43.920
21st century's socialism so that all the
old arguments against the social isms of

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.300
the passed arguments predicated on
what's wrong with the government and the

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:53.790
overwhelming power of the government
they're not relevant anymore because the

00:41:53.790 --> 00:42:00.470
thrust of socialism is at the base of
society not at the level of government

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:05.790
there's a reason Karl Marx wrote no
books about the state and endlessly

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:11.550
studied the production and distribution
of goods and services because that's the

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:18.630
core of the economy he wanted to take us
beyond and that's the problem we have we

00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:25.260
have let that go as if there's something
necessary or holy or sacrosanct about

00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:31.470
that way of organizing production so we
all take it for granted we shouldn't we

00:42:31.470 --> 00:42:36.930
never should have the impulse to
democracy ought to have been applied in

00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:42.090
the workplace and as for the arguments
gee you wouldn't want to go to all those

00:42:42.090 --> 00:42:45.360
meetings those were the arguments of the
Kings

00:42:45.360 --> 00:42:49.560
we don't need democracy the mass of
people haven't the time or the interest

00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:55.230
or the intellect or the educate
or the training or the come on we ought

00:42:55.230 --> 00:43:01.890
to recognize those kinds of arguments
against change for what they are they're

00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:08.270
fearful so we're going to stay with what
we have the capitalism that we have

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:16.740
producing the very humorous takes on mr.
Trump or mr. Johnson in England as the

00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:22.260
expressions of a system spinning out of
control in part because we don't face

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:27.270
that the basic organization of
production has been given a free pass

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:36.720
and is what's holding us back thank you
thank you Richard gene please you've got

00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:41.960
five minutes

00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:46.140
well Richard wrote a book called
democracy at work a cure for capitalism

00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:53.340
it was published seven years ago I read
it quite recently Richard probably

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:58.850
hasn't read it very recently
that's where at least commendably

00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:04.710
commendably he's written a whole book a
book by the way that Karl Marx never did

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:11.940
write about the socialism that he wants
and I quoted copiously from that book in

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:18.720
my initial talk if Richard is now going
to say oh well you know that book it's a

00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:25.080
chun-yan forget that book just you know
try to recognize that socialism is

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:30.000
preferable to some of the crap that goes
on now then we'd have to say Richard

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.430
we've been hearing that for over a
century

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:37.800
you know from socialists then we had the
Soviet Union this Stalin and we had in

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:42.869
mouth we had we've had a lot of mess
from your socialism you got to be a

00:44:42.869 --> 00:44:48.390
little bit more specific before we get
the least bit interested in something

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:53.490
that has been so disastrous for
humankind so I want to get Richard back

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:58.200
on the straight and narrow and take him
seriously that he's proposing something

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.940
with a nuts and bolts definition workers
self-directed into

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:08.819
and the embarrassing thing for Richard
as it was for Marxist right back to the

00:45:08.819 --> 00:45:13.260
time of Marx is that they're selling
something that workers don't seem to

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:19.380
want we we had socialism in Israel we
had 5% of the other the other country

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:23.579
who really was socialist I trust that
Richard would agree that the kibbutzim

00:45:23.579 --> 00:45:27.930
of Israel were five percent of them live
really worst socialist in a true sense

00:45:27.930 --> 00:45:31.980
the bottom up cents and that's what I'm
proposing now of course what also

00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:36.750
happened to Israel as Richard probably
knows as you probably know is that those

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:41.010
kid would seem just fell apart they
don't exist anymore people lose interest

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:46.559
in it but again what we are saying we
libertarians are saying go for it

00:45:46.559 --> 00:45:51.720
workers self-directed enterprises you do
have coops Richard Richard in another

00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.980
mood say hey look you've got coops it
speaks to to were to needs and desires

00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:01.319
and indeed maybe it does then go for it
but then let's build it from the ground

00:46:01.319 --> 00:46:07.980
up just like I'm proposing and then we
have a system of capitalism do I want to

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.569
keep the flawed system of capitalism the
system that fights that the political

00:46:12.569 --> 00:46:17.160
system that protects the powerful no
capitalism is a system of profit and

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:21.180
loss profits encourage risk-taking
losses encourage proves that prudence

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:26.339
that's the system now we abrogate that
for the counter crony capitalist system

00:46:26.339 --> 00:46:29.839
that's what brought about the housing
bubble that caused the Great Recession

00:46:29.839 --> 00:46:36.180
the week I'm quoting Noam Chomsky a guy
I also like by the way even though he's

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:41.910
a socialist we we to to a to great
extent we privatize profits and we

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:46.470
socialized losses that's what the
Federal Reserve does that's what it's

00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:52.589
all about do I want to sit back and like
in a system by God no we have a crony

00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:58.559
capitalist system by the way that shafts
people of limited means most of all that

00:46:58.559 --> 00:47:04.289
defends the rich and powerful and there
have been victories against it we we

00:47:04.289 --> 00:47:10.319
used to have an airline cartel prepped
protected by the Civil Aeronautics Board

00:47:10.319 --> 00:47:15.539
then somebody noticed that where the CA
B didn't dominate a flight between LA

00:47:15.539 --> 00:47:19.200
and San Francisco
in the same state cost half what it cost

00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:24.300
to fly from Washington to Boston or
Washington DC rather to Boston same

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:29.010
distance twice as expensive because of
government so then they abolished the CA

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:34.110
via the CA B and they and and there was
competition in the airlines and that was

00:47:34.110 --> 00:47:39.510
a huge victory for middle-income people
so victories can be one of Richard I

00:47:39.510 --> 00:47:45.210
want to recruit you to change this
system of capitalism if you'll excuse

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:50.220
the expression that my socialist uncle
Abe used to use as a but I use it as a

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:55.470
contraction for crony capitalism we need
more capital some yet not less we need

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:58.860
to change things
Richard could join us or he could focus

00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:05.370
on building his workers self-directed
enterprises from the ground up building

00:48:05.370 --> 00:48:09.330
on top of the co-op movement the
employee ownership movement which by the

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:14.280
way already gets tax breaks that I don't
necessarily object to that already gets

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:19.260
those breaks go for it turn everybody
onto worker self-directed enterprises

00:48:19.260 --> 00:48:24.080
and they're perfectly compatible it's
just like being in business for yourself

00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:30.360
that's all it is it's a great idea
it hasn't really caught on but maybe it

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:35.300
has potential I welcome it thanks very
much

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:43.330
right
Thank You Jean Epson and Richard Wolffe

00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:49.510
we're now ready to do the audience Q&amp;A
we have a couple of microphones set up

00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:56.560
please walk up to them I am going to be
I realize that each of you probably on

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:01.330
some level view the other as a Nazi I am
going to be which is wrong on both

00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:07.570
counts but I'm gonna be a Nazi I'm gonna
ask you to state a question we don't

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:11.590
want to hear a lot of speeches we want
to hear questions direct them to either

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:18.940
or both people debaters so let's go and
we're gonna start right now go first

00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:25.870
question hello my name is I'm from
Germany native German and it took me 35

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:31.390
years and winning the green card Audrey
for learning what libertarianism is I

00:49:31.390 --> 00:49:33.880
studied social science and okay thank

00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:37.120
you
what's it I would like to know from mr.

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:43.950
wolf why he thinks that it was not
possible for me to learn about

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:49.960
libertarianism and to many of the
majority even though I studied social

00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.660
science and taught it for several years
at high school

00:49:52.660 --> 00:50:00.100
yeah I'm not 38 years old and it took me
moving here but you learn it obviously

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:06.730
before you you learned about Marxism
before you even left high school because

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:12.820
if you if you know about the term when
you start studying I would say it was

00:50:12.820 --> 00:50:20.410
much easier for you to find out about
the other side than me okay that studied

00:50:20.410 --> 00:50:25.540
social science and thank you hearted
okay thank you Richard please use a

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:33.850
microphone hold one up and I I guess the
it should be on could you can you hear

00:50:33.850 --> 00:50:40.060
me yes okay so the question was
basically all in BS on the idea that you

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:48.100
couldn't learn about Marxism and the
question was that I really could or that

00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:51.360
you want to know why

00:50:52.870 --> 00:50:59.240
okay so he took a long time he said you
took a very short time libertarianism is

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:04.100
harder to learn about that Marxism and I
never indicated the number of years it

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:12.290
took me to learn Marxism okay Richard
can I uh can I uh I'm sorry it took you

00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:18.410
a long time if that helps do you do you
feel like there is not a free flow of

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:25.610
information in in contemporary America I
think that it blows my mind that you

00:51:25.610 --> 00:51:33.110
could even say that okay all right
thanks okay let me explain economics

00:51:33.110 --> 00:51:35.990
departments which is what I know around
the United States is where you might

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:41.840
learn Marxian economics you have to go
first of all the vast majority of

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:45.500
economics departments in the United
States have no person in them who knows

00:51:45.500 --> 00:51:51.350
of or teaches a course in Marxian
economics number one they don't have

00:51:51.350 --> 00:51:55.280
them at all
number two the vast majority subscribe

00:51:55.280 --> 00:52:00.380
to a basic kind of mainstream economics
that's called neoclassical economics

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:05.840
which is the dominant tradition there is
a small dissenting group that are called

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:09.470
Keynesian economics because of something
that happened in the Great Depression

00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:14.450
and the new development of a critical
perspective that has nothing to do with

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:19.310
socialism the there's tremendous fights
between the neoclassical who are the

00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:23.570
majority and the Keynesian who are
minority one of the very few things the

00:52:23.570 --> 00:52:29.180
two groups can get together on is
excluding Marxists that's the way the

00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:34.280
American economic system works and since
it's the economic economics departments

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:38.900
of our universities that train the
politicians who deal with economics the

00:52:38.900 --> 00:52:44.090
journalists who do economics and and the
people in the top of reaches of business

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:51.260
you have a solid kind of mask if you
like of uniformity in which the kinds of

00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:56.930
things that a Marxist economist talks
about or bizarre for them not because of

00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:01.490
their complexity or their newness but
because they have no experience

00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:05.120
whatsoever
in dealing with these things and that

00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:11.300
has been true for the entirety of my
experience in the American academic

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:16.970
environment where I've been a professor
all my life it is a it is a systematic

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:23.510
exclusion of the kinds of ideas that I
represent that makes students to this

00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:29.360
day not encounter it or if they have a
lot of fortitude to have little study

00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:34.850
groups on the side at their own expense
to learn this kind of material because

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:41.210
this country remains afraid of dealing
with that kind of thinking and that kind

00:53:41.210 --> 00:53:46.010
of tradition even though the literature
for it is massive okay thank you Richard

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:50.420
and and wait Jean I'm sorry hold on can
i Richard can I ask does it complicate

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:56.180
that scenario at all that we have at
least one major candidate for president

00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:02.600
Bernie Sanders who identifies as
socialist and has a large turnout I mean

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:07.100
the idea that socialism is somehow
suppressed seems like a reach to be

00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:14.690
quite honest Bernie Sanders is the first
candidate in 75 years not to disown that

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:21.410
title as part of the requirement not to
commit political suicide and you want me

00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:28.250
in the first time in 2016 that he dared
do it breaking that blue I'm supposed to

00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:34.160
pretend that the one person so far done
it in 75 years undoes what I just said

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:41.180
you got to be kidding okay and Richard I
look forward to the first time a major

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:46.960
party candidate actually explicitly as
libertarian Jean do you have a comment I

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:57.380
agree with Richard yes yes it's on yeah
I agree with Richard that that there's a

00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:04.430
lot of mind rot in in in the academic
departments on economics most of them

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:08.360
most of these economists basically want
to run the world they want to pretend

00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:11.530
that economics is a branch of
mathematics

00:55:11.530 --> 00:55:16.390
it's it's a waste of time for the most
part in the age of the Internet

00:55:16.390 --> 00:55:21.250
don't let school get in the way of your
education there's no excuse not to

00:55:21.250 --> 00:55:26.080
inform yourself about a whole range of
things including Austrian economics with

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:30.580
which I identify or Marxist economics
with which Richard identifies the

00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:34.270
Internet offers just an incredible
amount lectures from Richard Wolff

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:38.890
himself on the Internet
I appear regularly on part of the

00:55:38.890 --> 00:55:44.260
problem Dave Smith's show so you want to
catch that to learn economics the the

00:55:44.260 --> 00:55:48.190
intelligent way that whatever you really
learn you teach yourself anyway don't

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:51.610
write school get in the way thank you
and there's it might uh it might be

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:55.810
interesting we're gonna go to the next
question to think there's by my count I

00:55:55.810 --> 00:55:59.500
think there's two Marxist economics
departments in the country there's one

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:04.030
at Notre Dame and one at UMass Amherst
there's about two Austrian programs of

00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:08.680
now maybe three so we're as Dave Smith
pointed out we're all losers in this

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:13.330
room we have that in common
we're in the same club okay question let

00:56:13.330 --> 00:56:19.150
me just briefly correct it there was at
Notre Dame a department that program was

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:22.870
destroyed about eight or nine years ago
and doesn't exist

00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:28.960
and the program at University of
Massachusetts where I taught has ejected

00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.040
most of the Marxist that were there
there were half a dozen and so it is now

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:37.720
really better described as a Keynesian
or left-wing Keynesian program thank you

00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.380
there is no Marxist department in the
United States there are only scattered

00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:44.710
old one you're in there get those
workers building up from the ground

00:56:44.710 --> 00:56:50.740
let's go ok question sir no preamble no
we don't care where you're from for all

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:55.870
strangers here it's the French Foreign
Legion just ask the question this

00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:59.980
question is for Richard in there 100%
capitalist society laissez-faire

00:56:59.980 --> 00:57:04.030
capitalist arty burners there's no
federal reserve you would be well within

00:57:04.030 --> 00:57:07.600
your rights to be a socialist all you
need to do is band together with other

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:12.130
socialists and form your own community
whereas if I want to be a capitalist in

00:57:12.130 --> 00:57:16.420
a social society I would be forbidden
from doing so why why do you want to

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:20.470
force everyone to be a socialist why not
let the capitalist be capitalist let the

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:23.380
socialist be socialist everyone's
happening thank you

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:33.009
which first of all in whatever socialist
societies you're referring to and the

00:57:33.009 --> 00:57:36.640
major one in the world today is the
People's Republic of China that uses

00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.970
that name
they are busily encouraging people to

00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:44.769
form and develop capitalist enterprises
so the premise of your question is is

00:57:44.769 --> 00:57:49.750
wrong number one number two I never said
and would not argue that in a society

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:54.579
that is in transition as I believe
capitalism is there are all kinds of

00:57:54.579 --> 00:57:57.940
spaces for them to be enterprises
organized in the old traditional

00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:03.069
capitalist way and enterprises organized
as worker cooperatives in the new

00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:09.039
direction I would expect that kind of
coexistence to continue to be filled

00:58:09.039 --> 00:58:13.269
with tensions and difficulties much as
capitalist enterprises began in

00:58:13.269 --> 00:58:18.009
feudalism and existed in a tense
relationship until the transition

00:58:18.009 --> 00:58:22.990
happened further so my presumption is
there will be coexisting different

00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:30.880
structures in whatever name you give to
these societies in transition look in in

00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:35.650
line with the Jones question again under
capitalism property rights of firms are

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:40.509
protected so if there's a worker co-op
owned democratically by the workers and

00:58:40.509 --> 00:58:45.039
they're all directing it their property
rights will be protected if it catches

00:58:45.039 --> 00:58:49.599
on and the entire economy is worker
coops I say that's great that sounds

00:58:49.599 --> 00:58:53.799
terrific I'll run your own enterprise
some of the other things richard

00:58:53.799 --> 00:58:57.700
proposes which would be the iron fist to
the state having to do with finance that

00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:03.099
I object to however it was an article in
the National Review well under William F

00:59:03.099 --> 00:59:08.349
Buckley the right-winger welcoming
worker ownership I know that article

00:59:08.349 --> 00:59:13.930
well because I wrote it and so again
we're not arguing about that what

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:18.339
Richard doesn't really want to do I know
for example he likes jeremy corbyn's

00:59:18.339 --> 00:59:24.009
idea another kind of top-down plan where
you can sneaked up this kind of thing

00:59:24.009 --> 00:59:28.269
through the back door go for it there
are co-ops they'll already exist so in

00:59:28.269 --> 00:59:31.329
line with whether gentlemen said we
already have what you're talking about

00:59:31.329 --> 00:59:36.150
we have worker coops we have a huge
blend and if it tilts toward more worker

00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:43.289
ship wonderful okay next question please
sir hi my question is for Richard as

00:59:43.289 --> 00:59:47.910
well one of the core tenants of
libertarianism and capitalism or true

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:52.170
capitalism is the non-aggression
principle so my question for you is do

00:59:52.170 --> 00:59:55.140
you think that socialism intrinsically
violates the non-aggression principle

00:59:55.140 --> 01:00:00.119
and if so how can you explain how
committing aggression leads to greater

01:00:00.119 --> 01:00:10.619
freedom and equality do you want to do a
quick description of the definition of

01:00:10.619 --> 01:00:16.020
the non-aggression okay all right you
want me to yeah sure

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:19.559
so the non-aggression principle is the
principle that you're essentially

01:00:19.559 --> 01:00:23.460
allowed to do whatever you want as long
as you do not commit violent you do not

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:37.140
initiate violence against another person
okay I believe Jean Richard okay oh gosh

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:44.569
me too answering please thank you Nick
this is Jean Epstein of one-man show

01:00:45.710 --> 01:00:51.390
look what's Richards answer Richards
answer is well you know you're free to

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:55.770
starve you know under capitalism you
know if you don't work you don't get a

01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:57.599
job you're gonna starve you know I mean
that's

01:00:57.599 --> 01:01:01.859
so that's aggression you know so what
again you know forgive me but you know

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:05.309
you're coming out at Richard left from
left field because he's gonna say that

01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:09.299
that clearly the capital system commits
aggression because you're gonna starve

01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:13.230
unless you get a job and and then of
course we have a lot of answers to that

01:01:13.230 --> 01:01:18.059
somehow rather well the starvation tends
to happen in socialist countries not in

01:01:18.059 --> 01:01:21.119
this country but I think I got Richard
fired up he's gonna answer you now

01:01:21.119 --> 01:01:30.029
you're famous stop I just jumped yes
the this remarkable tendency in a

01:01:30.029 --> 01:01:38.339
frightened society to assign starvation
or deaths I it's the only place in

01:01:38.339 --> 01:01:42.870
American culture we're counting dead
people seems to be

01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:48.360
way to make an argument Jean mentioned
it before now it's starving people

01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:54.330
before he mentioned the disasters of
socialism where millions died what an

01:01:54.330 --> 01:02:01.430
interesting argument we're going to
count millions dead well what is it that

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:07.320
capitalism's history shows us the worst
two wars in human history world war 1 &amp;

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:13.520
2 these were products of competition
among capitalist economies weren't they

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:20.690
400 years of colonialism destroying
two-thirds of the world were products of

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:26.990
capitalist accumulation and competition
what kind of jerk what what kind of

01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:33.030
money finish what kind of mentality
picks a few examples of admittedly

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:39.000
horrible things that deserve to be
criticized but a comparison of death

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:43.950
counts the first book I ever wrote and
published Yale University Press was

01:02:43.950 --> 01:02:48.540
called the economics of colonialism it
studied what Britain did in Kenya

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:53.130
Britain arrived in Kenya in night in
1895 and set up the East Africa

01:02:53.130 --> 01:02:59.010
Protectorate and 30 years later 1931 the
Depression hit I studied what happened

01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:03.180
in Kenya at that time when the British
arrived they did a census 4 million

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:09.720
people in 1930 they did another census
two and a half million people British

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:17.340
colonialism killed millions of people in
one small country multiply that if you

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:22.560
want to do the death count analysis
which I find bizarre you're in very

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:28.890
shaky ground attacking socialism on the
basis of capitalism and the same kind of

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:36.060
cherry-picking of your examples came
with Gene and kibbutzim in in Israel to

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:40.590
work a co-op sometimes fail of course
they do do capitalist enterprises

01:03:40.590 --> 01:03:46.050
sometimes fail you bet they do all the
time this what is this strange remote

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:51.510
kind of choosing your example let me
give you a counter example in 1956 a

01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:54.630
group of workers we
a Catholic priests in the north of Spain

01:03:54.630 --> 01:04:00.420
in a little town called Mondragon made a
worker co-op the priest led them six

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:06.270
workers 1956 today something called the
Mondragon cooperative corporation has

01:04:06.270 --> 01:04:11.010
over a hundred thousand workers
it's the biggest worker co-op on the

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:17.339
planet it is a great success at the
seventh largest corporation in Spain it

01:04:17.339 --> 01:04:22.410
is a successful worker co-op
two American corporations pay the

01:04:22.410 --> 01:04:26.910
Mondragon Corporation to have their
scientists working alongside the

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:31.260
scientists in this worker co-op and the
name of the two American corporations is

01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:36.869
General Motors and Microsoft they
understand what those worker coops can

01:04:36.869 --> 01:04:42.660
do even if people here have to pick an
example where it didn't work out it's as

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:51.420
if I said well capitalism just look at
the Ford Edsel make two quick comments

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:59.069
to be discounted again again I like what
Richard just said again go for it I only

01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:02.010
mentioned the kibbutz scene because
obviously the kibbutzim were a

01:05:02.010 --> 01:05:04.770
well-known socialist phenomenon it
didn't work out

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:08.609
Mondragon did I was a part I was very
interested in the worker ownership

01:05:08.609 --> 01:05:12.510
movement in the 1980s ironically by the
way when I was senior economist in the

01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:15.660
New York Stock Exchange I was going to
all the meetings we were hearing they

01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:20.609
loved Mondragon all the time in the
1980s thirty years have passed and we

01:05:20.609 --> 01:05:26.039
don't have a mondo con in the US so I
encouraged Richard to go for it

01:05:26.039 --> 01:05:31.410
build it capitalism will love it why not
so again I'm not trying to discourage

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:36.299
Richard about going for it I'm just
saying that he has the means to do it

01:05:36.299 --> 01:05:41.190
he can start that revolution right away
within the context of capitalism with

01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:46.770
respect to the body-count point the only
point that's being made in this case and

01:05:46.770 --> 01:05:50.970
again I honestly apologize to Richard
for backing him in the core in a sense

01:05:50.970 --> 01:05:56.099
that he seems to be now defending the
state capitalism the objective he wrote

01:05:56.099 --> 01:05:59.970
a whole book collaborated in a whole
book in which he condemned the Soviet

01:05:59.970 --> 01:06:03.020
Union as state capitalist so he doesn't
really want

01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:07.280
Fenne those old line social and social
isms but the difference in terms of body

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:13.250
count is that this was what governments
did to their own citizens

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:18.080
these famines because they couldn't run
the agriculture right the the worst

01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:24.800
getting on top lunatics sociopaths like
Joe Stalin and Mao Zedong and Pol Pot

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:30.020
taking over and murdering their own
people either through the sin of

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:34.580
commission or omission that's the
difference oh god of course the body

01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:39.050
count with respect to war two million
people you know killed in Iraq and

01:06:39.050 --> 01:06:43.370
Vietnam yeah of course our body can't
with respect to wars abroad horrible

01:06:43.370 --> 01:06:47.540
Richard and I completely agree about
that we're talking about the body count

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:52.910
of governments against their own people
under socialism ok that's the bad record

01:06:52.910 --> 01:06:58.850
we're talking about question sir and by
the way if if there are in fact any

01:06:58.850 --> 01:07:02.450
women in the room it would be nice to
hear from you ok

01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:08.480
scoot up to the front of line sir you've
got you've got a man bond that's close

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:14.540
enough we're transitioning here yeah I
do identify as male and I suspect I will

01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:18.260
continue to do so I hope that doesn't
discipline

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:21.140
thank you very much to both of you this
has been very thought-provoking I have

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:26.990
two short questions primarily Nick what
this is Sophie's Choice time pick one of

01:07:26.990 --> 01:07:30.560
those questions because the other one is
not gonna make it is economic growth

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:35.750
ever undesirable ie does it ever lead to
increase suffering either domestically

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:39.380
or abroad and what are we gonna do with
AI when it happens in about 20 or 30

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:44.350
years and nobody has jobs very good very
good sir okay either of you Richard

01:07:44.350 --> 01:07:50.240
absolutely we do not prioritize or we
ought not if that's your question to

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:55.970
prioritize economic growth as if it's a
uni-dimensional plus it can be as we

01:07:55.970 --> 01:08:00.680
learned from ecological sensitivities
built up over the last thirty years that

01:08:00.680 --> 01:08:05.660
it can be a very dangerous and negative
phenomena but in a society that allows

01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:11.240
the decision of what to produce and what
to invest in to be done on the basis of

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:15.119
a private profit calculation you are
hardly in a position

01:08:15.119 --> 01:08:20.880
to bring in all of those other issues
that have to be dealt with I remember in

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:26.159
my education I was taught of bizarre
language which gives it away that there

01:08:26.159 --> 01:08:32.250
are we should remember our teachers told
us externalities what a wonderful term

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:35.279
something that isn't central to what
we're dealing with

01:08:35.279 --> 01:08:40.350
it's an externality only slowly to
discover that the externality can be

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:46.409
more negative than what's internal is
positive capitalism sanctifies the

01:08:46.409 --> 01:08:53.520
profit motive that socialism alternative
has always said profit is one among a

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:58.469
whole range of objectives and no
decisions should be made based on any

01:08:58.469 --> 01:09:07.739
one when all the others are equally
important to the quality of life I guess

01:09:07.739 --> 01:09:11.460
then I won't answer the question about
artificial intelligence since that was

01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:25.109
the second question be again obviously
to me well it was we'll talk later sir

01:09:25.109 --> 01:09:30.000
okay it'd be fun to talk about AI but
with it look with respect to economic

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.940
growth again I first of all know this
obviously I am an individual I'm a

01:09:35.940 --> 01:09:38.850
libertarian I don't believe there's
anything the least bit sacred about

01:09:38.850 --> 01:09:43.290
economic growth if people do if people
are basically by the way if we all

01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:48.630
decided that would prefer to work 20
hours a week then that labor leisure

01:09:48.630 --> 01:09:52.529
choice would begin to prevail
capitalists would only get us to work

01:09:52.529 --> 01:09:56.310
for them we'd be willing to only work
part-time and we'd say well it will work

01:09:56.310 --> 01:10:00.750
for a little bit less so that it's
advantageous to deploy to employ two of

01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:05.010
us for 20 hours a week rather than one
person for 40 so then we would have a

01:10:05.010 --> 01:10:12.030
diminution of resources we would have a
shrinkage of the economy wonderful why

01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:16.469
not if people only want to work 20 hours
a week then we don't have we can compete

01:10:16.469 --> 01:10:20.429
we can compete I'd perhaps and want to
explain to Richard because the simple

01:10:20.429 --> 01:10:26.070
math is that if if full-time workers get
to $20 an hour then then we'll just work

01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:29.320
for $18
part-time look at two of us for less so

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:36.460
therefore we can opt for living less we
make those choices all the time I you

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:40.030
know what what's a what's a Jewish
lawyer kiddo couldn't get into Medical

01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:42.130
School
well I'm Jewish I didn't become a lawyer

01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:46.840
or a doctor I chose to be a sloppy-ass
journalist I dropped that so therefore

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:50.440
we make those choices all the time it's
an individual choice there is nothing

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:55.450
sacred about economic growth with
respect to diseconomy externalities we

01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:59.740
are individuals we have individual
freedom you can't throw garbage on your

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:04.780
neighbor's lawn however my right to move
my fist stops at your chin and if a

01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:09.490
capitalist is polluting your backyard
and causing that harm you should sue

01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:14.280
them so therefore we do need a tort
system in order to protect against any

01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:19.660
individual a choice anything that a firm
does or indeed that an individual to us

01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:24.940
in order to make sure that they don't
harm us in the in the process of

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:30.160
pursuing their own goals that's the best
view answer okay thank you Richard quick

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:35.320
quick rebuttal robot I really find it
extraordinary this sort of commentary if

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:41.380
we would like to work only shorter hours
the history of capitalism is the history

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:45.580
of the struggle of the mass of working
people to reduce the length of the

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:48.460
working-day
from the 16 hours it was in early

01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:55.960
capitalism in england to 14 to 12 to 10
to 8 it's been a struggle at every point

01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:02.020
capital is driving people children as
well as adults to work incredible hours

01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:07.210
workers having to mobilize and fight
this is not a matter of the libertarian

01:12:07.210 --> 01:12:11.950
notion let's just choose that's not the
way the world worked it hasn't worked

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:16.600
that way in the past and it doesn't work
now that's a system that imposed those

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:21.940
struggles and all the suffering that
went into it until people said no more

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:25.780
we won't work that many hours we won't
let you have our children when they're

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:31.030
six that's the history of capitalism and
we're not even counting all the injuries

01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:37.120
and all the deaths in that game of
counting human suffering from a system I

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:41.919
suggested Richard read a book
by Stanley a leprechaun which is a whole

01:12:41.919 --> 01:12:47.139
history of the labor markets of the of
the capitalist markets and it's got a

01:12:47.139 --> 01:12:52.599
lot of good facts in it now I believe
that one of the things that that Richard

01:12:52.599 --> 01:12:57.579
should try to answer is and how was
there a whole lot of progress why was

01:12:57.579 --> 01:13:04.539
there so much immense progress by
Labor's from them from 1870 to 1925 or

01:13:04.539 --> 01:13:10.239
indeed he says that wages were rising
for decades and the unions are

01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:15.820
statistically were negligible government
was under when that wasn't honest no I

01:13:15.820 --> 01:13:22.090
want to win with one fact there was a 49
hour work week capitalists have 49 hour

01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:27.760
work week as of the 1920s as labor as
labor got shows the work week fell the

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.510
work week fell because in order to get
workers to work for you to bid for

01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:35.260
workers their labor law at leisure
choice was such that they wanted there

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:39.219
is a Marxist myth that there is an
inequality no equality between

01:13:39.219 --> 01:13:42.039
bargaining between laborers and workers
well

01:13:42.039 --> 01:13:46.269
that's relied by about a hundred years
of history okay for unions became the

01:13:46.269 --> 01:13:49.769
least bit of a presence in this economy
thank you okay

01:13:49.769 --> 01:13:57.159
ma'am please question we're currently in
an opioid crisis and the World Health

01:13:57.159 --> 01:14:02.079
Organization ranks our health care
system 37th in the world do you think

01:14:02.079 --> 01:14:08.849
it's still possible for our current
system to fix this and how would you

01:14:08.849 --> 01:14:14.739
using socialism fix us okay Richard I
guess take the first whack at that

01:14:14.739 --> 01:14:21.039
picture one of the charming features of
the capitalist system has been the

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:26.679
endless effort on the part of virtually
all capitalists to try to get more than

01:14:26.679 --> 01:14:30.579
the normal surplus out of their workers
the difference between the value added

01:14:30.579 --> 01:14:35.619
by a worker and what the employer pays
the worker that normal surplus if you

01:14:35.619 --> 01:14:39.999
like they've always tried to do better
by controlling the market or what we

01:14:39.999 --> 01:14:44.800
used to call monopolization becoming
strong enough to jack the price even

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.959
higher to make more profits and one of
the ways you do that is to control a

01:14:49.959 --> 01:14:54.579
market in this country one
the most successful examples is the

01:14:54.579 --> 01:14:59.739
medical industrial complex for
industries that work together the

01:14:59.739 --> 01:15:05.559
insurers the drug companies the doctors
and the hospitals and the producers of

01:15:05.559 --> 01:15:09.789
medical devices are with it the drugs
they've gotten together and they've

01:15:09.789 --> 01:15:14.920
produced this situation a where we pay
more for medical care than any other

01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:19.539
advanced industrial country and the
quality of our healthcare is at best

01:15:19.539 --> 01:15:25.539
mediocre as the young woman pointed out
in our ranking number 37 the solution to

01:15:25.539 --> 01:15:30.039
the problem in our medical care is not
another law another special federal

01:15:30.039 --> 01:15:36.550
program another stop it is a problem in
which you have taken something as

01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:41.380
important as human health
a subjected it to the capitalist profit

01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:46.840
motive and be allowed that monopoly to
function to coordinate its behavior and

01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:56.860
to rip this society off from A to Z and
laugh all the way to the bank first of

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:02.619
all we this the solo form in a few
months is going to have a debate so

01:16:02.619 --> 01:16:06.940
forum debate on the opioid crisis I
invite Richard to come free ticket for

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:11.979
you Richard and a free ticket for the
young lady who asked question to that

01:16:11.979 --> 01:16:16.840
debate
basically Richard and I agree about 90%

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:22.119
of the way about the medical care system
it's a crony capitalist system it has to

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:27.940
be unraveled you say your your solution
though is not to make it fully

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:32.409
socialized but rather to put more market
forces in yeah through workers self

01:16:32.409 --> 01:16:36.849
directed enterprises if indeed that's
the way they want to construct it

01:16:36.849 --> 01:16:41.650
because I'm all for those WS des which
is by the way what Richard calls okay

01:16:41.650 --> 01:16:47.079
very quickly Richard 10 seconds yeah one
one theoretical confusion when I talk

01:16:47.079 --> 01:16:51.340
about mark capitalism I'm talking about
arranging production with employers and

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:55.329
employees as different people in an
endless struggle I'm not talking about

01:16:55.329 --> 01:17:00.369
markets the confusion between a
capitalist organization and a market is

01:17:00.369 --> 01:17:05.229
something we ought to get beyond slavery
had markets remember we bought and sold

01:17:05.229 --> 01:17:08.860
slaves
feudalism had markets the market isn't

01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:13.750
what's unique about us capitalism is
what's unique and that has to do with

01:17:13.750 --> 01:17:18.460
the organization of production which is
why that's what we go after and that's

01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:23.800
the focus of socialism not some dead old
stale debate about whether the

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:28.150
government should have more or less
influence on the market that's a

01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:34.920
different subject okay we have a couple
of minutes left I want to enforce

01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:40.270
brutally quick question quick answers
let's get to through two or three more

01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:44.230
of these things sir go ahead Richard can
you be more specific about what you're

01:17:44.230 --> 01:17:47.739
advocating and can you equivocally say
that your vision of socialism will or

01:17:47.739 --> 01:17:50.910
will not be mandated by the state

01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:57.910
absolutely socialism always understood
whatever its moments whatever its

01:17:57.910 --> 01:18:02.920
aberrations if you really want to
understand where that the notion of the

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:07.780
state being powerful came in a brief
summary of the history in the 19th

01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:13.360
century socialism basically was born it
was the shadow of capitalism it's

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:18.730
capitalism self criticism whenever
there's capitalism it produces socialism

01:18:18.730 --> 01:18:23.350
the notion that you're going to get out
of capitalism by somehow eliminating

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:28.450
socialism reminds me of what Mark Twain
said when he read his obituary in the

01:18:28.450 --> 01:18:31.930
newspaper the reports of my death are
greatly exaggerated

01:18:31.930 --> 01:18:36.840
he wrote the reports of the death of
socialism are absurd because capitalism

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:44.770
reproduces it so here's my idea we don't
need the state because the whole role is

01:18:44.770 --> 01:18:51.100
to transform the base of society but
just like ever every other emerging

01:18:51.100 --> 01:18:56.800
system like capitalism and feudalism the
state it was thought can help the

01:18:56.800 --> 01:19:01.780
process so the focus of socialists
became capture the state either with

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:06.580
parliamentary or revolution and then use
it to make the transformation what

01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:11.350
happened in the Soviet Union
understandably and in China too was you

01:19:11.350 --> 01:19:14.320
focused on grabbing the state you
managed it

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:19.620
you took the state but then that next
step that got delayed and posts

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:25.110
onde and therein lies the problem whose
solution is to transform the base of

01:19:25.110 --> 01:19:30.110
society which is why there is the focus
on the workers becoming their own bosses

01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:35.400
in the workplace okay thank you quick
let's do one maybe two more questions

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:38.550
sir hi this is a question for mr.
Epstein

01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:43.470
I was just wondering on our federal
domestic tax is the only major way to

01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:49.500
fund federal spending repeat the
questions on our federal domestic tax is

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:54.840
the only major way to fund federal
spending our federal domestic tax is the

01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:00.600
only way to tax a way to fund well well
empirically no I mean a lot of federal

01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:05.580
spending is comes from printing money
from the Federal Reserve and obviously a

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:10.560
lot of federal spending comes from
borrowing money okay we have time for

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:16.770
one final question we got a couple of
kibitzers over here okay ask a quick

01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:22.740
question no you're not paying for this
microphone okay no I don't well you know

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:28.500
Reagan Reagan take a hike here to ask a
question now yeah please thank you my

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:33.510
question is if we're talking about
economics how can we have a debate about

01:20:33.510 --> 01:20:38.880
which system is better and I've been
listening and I new gentlemen once the

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:43.320
word computers and how that impacts on
everything I felt like I was listening

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:48.690
to a debate about the mechanical age and
I was the bait really was which

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:53.610
platitudes are better socialist
platitudes or capitalist platitudes

01:20:53.610 --> 01:20:59.220
could you discuss and incorporate a
little bit about how the computers and

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:04.050
the electronic age work on the feelings
that you have about socialism and the

01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:08.070
feelings that you have about capitalism
okay let's and that thank you very much

01:21:08.070 --> 01:21:13.680
sir and we're going to boot into the
computer age right before we go to the

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:18.120
rebuttal we are done with questions so
thank you all for standing up you may

01:21:18.120 --> 01:21:20.910
now sit down
Richard why don't you begin with that

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:24.780
right this is not the answer you
probably want but you're gonna get it

01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:27.680
anyway
you know that's one of the like both

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:34.460
capitalism and social what one of one of
the remarkable things in this debate

01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:39.770
between capitalism and socialism is the
easy way folks who are rendered

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:47.210
uncomfortable by it find another way a
tangential argument to focus on as if

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:53.990
they can somehow thereby escape these
basic system questions you can't every

01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:58.850
major technological change has led to
people doing something which if I were

01:21:58.850 --> 01:22:03.740
mean-spirited I would call a platitude
it's everything is going to be changed

01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:07.670
by the jet engine everything is gonna be
changed by electricity everything is

01:22:07.670 --> 01:22:11.030
gonna be changed by temas tree
everything's gonna be you've finished

01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:17.720
the technological determinism it used to
be called each new invention is going to

01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:23.690
radically try no it doesn't it changes
things for sure but it doesn't alter the

01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:28.280
basic systemic questions that we're
talking about they're not platitudes

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:33.710
they're not evasions the focus on the
new technology as if it is magically

01:22:33.710 --> 01:22:39.860
going to lift us out of these problems
it's a mirage it has been that through

01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:45.830
the last 200 years of technical
breakthroughs and AI and computers don't

01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:52.130
change that story thank you may I
comment that fat I don't know if there's

01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:58.130
a syllable of what Richard said that I
do not fully agree with us now

01:22:58.130 --> 01:23:05.000
in fact indeed look we've had a computer
age for three decades we have ATMs we

01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.640
have automatic tellers once are infinite
and as Richard is indeed is absolutely

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.320
correct in saying the way we run our
economy is the way we run our economy

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:20.630
Richard and I we agree we have no
debating you know what we're going to

01:23:20.630 --> 01:23:27.380
let we're gonna stop this phase this was
the audience Q&amp;A we now have the people

01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:32.660
the two debaters Richard Wolffe and Jean
Epstein going into their final

01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:36.830
statements they each have seven and a
half minutes and again remember that the

01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:41.900
proposition the
resolution before us is socialism is

01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:46.430
preferable to capitalism as an economic
system that promotes freedom equality

01:23:46.430 --> 01:23:51.290
and prosperity Richard Wolffe you have
seven and a half minutes to seal the

01:23:51.290 --> 01:24:07.450
deal the first sign that socialism is on
its way is that we're having this debate

01:24:07.450 --> 01:24:13.120
that we have Bernie Sanders running and
he has the name socialist and he doesn't

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:19.730
give it up he doesn't turn away
Elizabeth Warren who has very similar

01:24:19.730 --> 01:24:24.110
programs she still feels the need to
reassure everybody

01:24:24.110 --> 01:24:34.490
she likes capitalism Bernie doesn't the
reality is up until six years ago my

01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:39.770
presence on American media scene was so
tiny none of you whatever have heard of

01:24:39.770 --> 01:24:45.020
me I've done more public speaking at the
invitation of American audiences in the

01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:53.240
last four years that I did in the
previous 50 yeah the public awareness is

01:24:53.240 --> 01:25:01.870
to the right because of the last years
of neoliberalism and the orange clown I

01:25:01.870 --> 01:25:08.770
understand that but beneath that is a
shift to the left in the United States

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:15.350
nothing illustrates it in my mind any
better than the remarkable number of

01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:21.700
times Jean Epstein told you how he
agreed with me

01:25:26.550 --> 01:25:29.610
I don't run away from the label
socialist and I don't want to away from

01:25:29.610 --> 01:25:34.140
the label Marxist either
I'm proud of what I've learned from

01:25:34.140 --> 01:25:39.150
those traditions but I'm also very clear
and I really hope I've gotten that

01:25:39.150 --> 01:25:44.780
across that the way the question for
this evening was posed is a problem

01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:53.090
there is no singular socialism there
never was socialism is a large complex

01:25:53.090 --> 01:25:58.980
tradition of multiple different notions
that are often at great odds with one

01:25:58.980 --> 01:26:02.240
another
and have had long and bitter disputes

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:08.490
what in the world do you mean by
socialism is it that social democracy of

01:26:08.490 --> 01:26:13.980
Scandinavia and German and Western
European countries is it a socialism

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:20.310
that China or Russia or Cuba talk about
is it the focus on transforming

01:26:20.310 --> 01:26:26.430
workplaces into worker coops instead of
undemocratic hierarchical workplace

01:26:26.430 --> 01:26:33.630
kingdoms what do you mean when you talk
about socialism the very idea of using

01:26:33.630 --> 01:26:40.080
the singular reflects what I tried to
say at the beginning we have to

01:26:40.080 --> 01:26:47.460
understand we are emerging from a 75
year period in which we didn't learn

01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:54.180
about it think about it or discuss it or
if we did it was in dismissive cursory

01:26:54.180 --> 01:27:00.930
manner that didn't teach Miko anything
it's always been an awkward moment when

01:27:00.930 --> 01:27:05.610
American tourists go to Europe and
discover that in every single European

01:27:05.610 --> 01:27:12.750
country socialist parties are big
important political institutions I won't

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:17.700
embarrass you by asking you how many of
you know that the government in Portugal

01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:23.490
today is a coalition of the Portuguese
Socialist Party the Portuguese Communist

01:27:23.490 --> 01:27:28.050
Party and the Portuguese Green Party and
that they've been the government for

01:27:28.050 --> 01:27:36.870
quite a few years now I won't embarrass
you the last thing I would say is

01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:39.659
because of this peculiar fetish
Americans

01:27:39.659 --> 01:27:43.889
about the government as either being
something that's gonna save us all which

01:27:43.889 --> 01:27:50.010
is crazy or which is gonna crush us all
which is equally crazy governments do

01:27:50.010 --> 01:27:54.060
what they do in large part because of
the pressure from those who have the

01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:59.639
position to shape them one of the
problems with the liberal in the old

01:27:59.639 --> 01:28:04.980
British sense or the libertarian if you
like is that the argument always starts

01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:09.960
with the government as if it were a deus
ex machina that just has some qualities

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:15.150
of things it does without asking the
obvious question why does the government

01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:20.969
do this or that or the next thing we're
supposed to believe it's built into the

01:28:20.969 --> 01:28:28.199
genes of the government that it does
certain things the government does what

01:28:28.199 --> 01:28:31.290
the press
pressure of the society and the way it's

01:28:31.290 --> 01:28:37.620
organized make it do every bit as much
as what the government does influences

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:45.239
the rest of this society let me conclude
by correcting Jean about Jeremy Corbyn

01:28:45.239 --> 01:28:50.610
because he's the future in terms of what
we're talking about the British Labour

01:28:50.610 --> 01:28:55.340
Party the second party in England by the
way a party most of whose members

01:28:55.340 --> 01:29:00.540
identify as socialists in the British
Labour Party there's a commitment

01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:06.750
they've made and the commitment goes
like this when we're elected one of the

01:29:06.750 --> 01:29:12.540
first laws we'll pass is the following
any company organised in Great Britain

01:29:12.540 --> 01:29:18.239
can continue the way it is as a
capitalist enterprise but if it comes to

01:29:18.239 --> 01:29:24.810
the following decision either shut down
or to move out of Great Britain or to

01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:30.080
sell itself to another company or to go
public with a with an IPO issuing shares

01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:37.730
before it can do that it must give its
own workers the right of first refusal

01:29:37.730 --> 01:29:45.350
that's the law that the workers can buy
the company and convert it into a

01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:51.150
democratically run worker cooperative
and when everyone says well where in the

01:29:51.150 --> 01:29:56.940
world will the
workers get the money to do that mr.

01:29:56.940 --> 01:30:06.219
McDonald the closest advisor mr. Corbyn
has smiles and says the government will

01:30:06.219 --> 01:30:13.770
lend it to them why because for the
British people to have freedom of choice

01:30:13.770 --> 01:30:19.510
between a capitalist undemocratic
enterprise on the one hand and a worker

01:30:19.510 --> 01:30:24.940
co-op democratic enterprise on the other
they have to have some experience of

01:30:24.940 --> 01:30:29.710
what they're like both to buy from and
to work in and the only way they can

01:30:29.710 --> 01:30:34.960
have that experience so they can choose
freely between them or what mix they

01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.139
want of them is if there's a sector that
they can buy from and work at so we as

01:30:41.139 --> 01:30:45.790
the leaders of Britain have to create
the sector so that the free choice of

01:30:45.790 --> 01:30:52.110
our people between systems can finally
happen that's the role of the government

01:30:52.110 --> 01:30:58.780
expanding free choice rather than being
represented is imposing something in

01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:04.389
that fearful imagery that we all have as
if the government is like those nasty

01:31:04.389 --> 01:31:09.489
people at the post office who make us
wait before they sell us the stamps

01:31:09.489 --> 01:31:21.280
thank you

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:28.840
well I agree with Richard that he and I
agree with a about a great deal and I

01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:32.620
think that's wonderful
why do we agree about a great deal

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:39.700
because we're both radicals and radical
people do see a lot of evil in our

01:31:39.700 --> 01:31:45.640
current society even though I think
Richard basically wants to march in the

01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:50.650
wrong direction
and tonight I've been a little bit

01:31:50.650 --> 01:31:56.820
troubled that he often times abandons
his own book written seven years ago and

01:31:56.820 --> 01:32:02.650
occasionally lapses into defending the
old-style socialism's and into falling

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:06.550
back into the mode of saying you know
well social does a lot of things let's

01:32:06.550 --> 01:32:13.840
just do it and again ignoring the fact
that we need to focus focus I guess

01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:16.930
again
on the old socialism's well take a

01:32:16.930 --> 01:32:22.150
controlled experiment Society who the
world in history gives us very few East

01:32:22.150 --> 01:32:28.200
Germany versus West Germany West Germany
mainly capitalist East Germany socialist

01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:33.730
impoverished in East Germany under the
font foot of the oven of the stassi's in

01:32:33.730 --> 01:32:38.410
West Germany capitalist much more
affluent much more comfortable in the

01:32:38.410 --> 01:32:43.870
democratic society North Korea versus
South Korea I need an elaborate on the

01:32:43.870 --> 01:32:51.460
differences there Taiwan and Hong Kong
versus most of China until China began

01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:57.490
to go capitalist so we have the record
staring us in the face of the awful

01:32:57.490 --> 01:33:03.300
failures of these societies so we want
to say goodbye to all that they were

01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:08.950
disastrous then we have the social
democracies of Europe maybe that's a

01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:12.100
waste of time to talk about because they
are for most for the most part

01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:17.680
capitalist anyway but then we side-scan
the Scandinavian countries even though

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:22.180
Norway is there is a country of 5
million people sitting on a huge oil

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:26.830
well basically selling oil to the rest
of the world and by the way apparently

01:33:26.830 --> 01:33:30.770
worsening global warming and the
but we wanted to offend Norway in

01:33:30.770 --> 01:33:37.940
Denmark well let's not cherry pick let's
look at the whole range of of economies

01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:42.680
and the experience in Europe and let's
include Portugal Spain Italy Greece

01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:47.210
where it's gone
very badly the average is very very

01:33:47.210 --> 01:33:50.660
unimpressive
they used to talk about euro slicker

01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:56.120
sclerosis very troubled economies by and
large so we want to say goodbye to all

01:33:56.120 --> 01:34:01.880
that so now again I want to take Richard
literally and talk about his workers

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:06.980
self-directed enterprises well I imagine
when you hear him saying employees

01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:11.390
becoming their own bosses well you know
there are millions of people who are

01:34:11.390 --> 01:34:17.810
their own bosses I know I didn't make
that up Richard didn't make that up form

01:34:17.810 --> 01:34:21.980
a co-op a family-run business all of
those things are possible under

01:34:21.980 --> 01:34:27.770
socialism and the problem that Richard
faces is that by enlarge it hasn't

01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:31.430
caught on
maybe it has hope so now Richard is

01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:37.040
resorting to cheering on out of
desperation out of unfortunately not

01:34:37.040 --> 01:34:41.090
taking seriously the fact that you want
to work there are people by the way who

01:34:41.090 --> 01:34:45.560
still are fostering a worker democracy
oh god I know I met a lot of those

01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:49.370
people they want to start these firms
they want to run it that way they think

01:34:49.370 --> 01:34:54.290
it's better people are happier doing it
wonderful let's do it so now he's now

01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:58.940
Richard is championing the plan of
Jeremy Corbyn where where where the

01:34:58.940 --> 01:35:03.739
government is going to start lending
money on advantageous terms to companies

01:35:03.739 --> 01:35:08.000
that want to go that wanna go workers
self-directed enterprise how

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.290
advantageous is that going to be Jeremy
Corbyn a very ambitious politician who

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:18.080
by the way is on record as admiring a
lot of hard fisted a strong men like you

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:22.040
go shabbos in his and a successor
nicolas maduro he might just start

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:25.460
giving it away capitalists
might start selling these firms to

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:30.440
people again Richard is looking for the
top-down solution to a bottom-up

01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:35.810
revolution and I implore him to abandon
all that and go to capitalist route with

01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:41.190
his plans now then finally I tried to
take seriously what he wrote

01:35:41.190 --> 01:35:45.900
book he wants to socialize finance he
wants to put it on under a political

01:35:45.900 --> 01:35:51.360
thumb he wants to he wants to socialize
labor allocation he wants to tighten the

01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:58.190
the government's control over those two
sources of enterprise expansion so that

01:35:58.190 --> 01:36:03.600
dissident publications would suffer but
innovation would suffer all of those

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:09.090
things would set us back in terms of
prosperity and freedom and and again I

01:36:09.090 --> 01:36:13.770
guess you know I mentioned equality I
might ask you the old you know 1020

01:36:13.770 --> 01:36:19.680
question would you prefer a society in
which the top 1% gets 20% richer and the

01:36:19.680 --> 01:36:24.780
other 99% the rest of us get 10% richer
or would you prefer that's more

01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:30.449
inequality or would you prefer a society
in which the top 20% get poorer and the

01:36:30.449 --> 01:36:36.540
bottom I know suits me yeah yeah the top
20% get poor and the 99% get 10% poorer

01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:41.790
we all get poorer but then since the top
1% is getting 20% poor that narrows

01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:47.250
equality well we want actually because
extremes touch and Richard and I believe

01:36:47.250 --> 01:36:52.170
in individual rights I want people to
make their own choices about how they

01:36:52.170 --> 01:36:56.219
live their lives the professions they
lead where they want to work and what

01:36:56.219 --> 01:37:02.219
they do and capitalism offers that
potential but it can indeed evolve we do

01:37:02.219 --> 01:37:06.900
need to free up the housing markets that
which are under the thumb of the crony

01:37:06.900 --> 01:37:11.130
capitalist we do indeed and that is
hurting poor people preventing them from

01:37:11.130 --> 01:37:15.600
moving into high wage cities like New
York and Los and Los Angeles and San

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:20.250
Francisco we need to free up the guild
systems that make it hard for poor

01:37:20.250 --> 01:37:25.110
people to get other kinds of jobs the
licensing system that protects people

01:37:25.110 --> 01:37:28.680
that that prevents poor people from
moving into better jobs there are a

01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:34.830
whole lot of radical things we need to
do to change our economy but we need to

01:37:34.830 --> 01:37:41.070
keep keep the fundamental freedoms under
capitalism capitalism private property

01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:47.310
is necessary although not sufficient to
a free and open society it's not

01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:52.050
sufficient because government can always
come in and jail you the day after you

01:37:52.050 --> 01:37:54.970
publish something you don't like just
like Obama

01:37:54.970 --> 01:38:00.700
tried but but it's necessary it's
necessary because if you give somebody

01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:05.980
like Obama some political leader control
over your property over the means of

01:38:05.980 --> 01:38:11.320
production then you make it hard even to
function in the first place you make it

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:15.100
hard for Richard to sell those books you
make it hard for the sole form to

01:38:15.100 --> 01:38:21.040
operate you make it hard for Jacobin
magazine to operate and that's why you

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:27.610
have to vote against Richards resolution
but Richard does 7 out workers self

01:38:27.610 --> 01:38:32.800
directed enterprises capitalist and
offers it to you Richard I say go for it

01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:43.909
thanks very much
