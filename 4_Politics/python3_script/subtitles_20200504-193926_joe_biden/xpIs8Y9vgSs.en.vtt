00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.820
The coronavirus has devastated
the airline industry.

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.880
U.S. air travel has dropped 95 %
compared to last year, and the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.040
number of flights scheduled globally
is down by 63 %.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.870
The insides of airports are empty,
but outside is another story.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.490
While some airlines have started
transporting cargo on passenger

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.020
planes, more than two-thirds of
the world's commercial aircraft are

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.770
grounded. It's somewhere between 14
and 15,000 aircraft that are

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.610
parked, or almost 60
% of the fleet.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.040
Never before in history have airlines had
to ground so many planes so

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.530
quickly. Customers have come to us
and said, look, we're parking

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.100
literally hundreds of
aircraft per day.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.200
And logistically, it's
very, very complex.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.760
This is a particular difficult time
and we've created a particular

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.630
app that literally allows them to
virtually park the aircraft with no

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.800
demand for flights. Delta and
United reported their first quarterly

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.510
losses in more than five years.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.800
American Airlines told CNBC its revenue is
down 90 % from a year ago.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.780
Parking hundreds of aircraft is
also adding to their losses.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.100
These planes can't just sit idle.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.100
They need routine maintenance and
a place to be stored.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.070
And when you suddenly have thousands of
planes with nowhere to go, it

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.700
becomes a logistical nightmare.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.720
Before the coronavirus hit, airplanes were
where they were meant to be

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.770
in the air. At certain times of the
year, there could be as many as

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.410
20,000 planes in flight at the
same time around the world.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.630
At the end of 2019, the global
air fleet was nearly 24,000 and now

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.760
more than 16,000 of those massive
machines need a place to park.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.240
And that number can continue to go
up as airlines cut their networks.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.500
Aircraft storage facilities have been around
for decades, but never in

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.550
history has the aviation industry had to
park so many planes at once.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.640
Airlines are having to get creative
about finding space for planes.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.150
A recent flyover of a
storage facility in Victorville, California,

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.810
shows planes fit together like
puzzle pieces on unused runways.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.430
Victorville is well known as one
of the world's biggest airplane

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.210
boneyards, a storage location for out
of service or old planes.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.210
It was already storing Southwest's fleet
of Boeing 737 max eight, but

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.660
it's now storing hundreds of other aircraft
due to the lack of demand

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.270
and air travel. Victorville, along
with boneyards in Roswell, New

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.180
Mexico, and Tucson, Arizona, are
currently the top three locations

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.450
for parked aircraft. They've collectively
stored 800 so far.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.030
Routine parking happens from
time to time.

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.040
Very, very small
volumes of aircraft.

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.570
But this is completely unprecedented,
so widespread that aircraft are

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.380
being parked at airports, all over
major airports now have many

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.140
parked aircraft on the ground and they're
gonna be there for a while?

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.370
As you can see here, American
Airlines is using Tulsa International

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.690
Airport as a parking lot
for many of its jets.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.200
There's currently over 50
grounded airplanes here.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.270
Nothing this big has ever
landed in the Alice.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.660
More than a dozen planes are now
sitting in a storage facility at the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.780
Outback Airport.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.380
Aircraft range in size.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.800
For scale, a standard football
field is 160 ft.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.710
wide. A narrow body jet like Boeing
737 has a wingspan of 117 ft.

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.810
But wide body airliners
can be twice that.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.980
The world's largest plane, Airbus's A380,
has a wingspan of 261 ft.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.030
Even aircraft manufacturer Airbus is
being asked to help out.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.300
Customers have come to us and
said, look, we're talking literally

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:06.370
hundreds of aircraft per day and we
have a huge amount of maintenance

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.020
work to do with that. And
we've created that particular app.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.180
And that's an app that helps our
customers to work out exactly how

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.320
much maintenance is needed and
even logistically where the aircraft

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.440
are. And that enables them to very
quickly optimize how to block the

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.530
aircraft, which park them and also to
prepare them when they come out

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.170
of service when this is through.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.250
Airbus, along with Boeing, dominate
the commercial aircraft industry

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.120
and together make up 91%
of the market share.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.960
Airbus has over 11,000
planes in operation.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.020
Skywise is a digital platform
the manufacturer offers its customers

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.610
to keep up the
health of an aircraft.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.520
It collects data from systems
and sensors to help predict

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.060
maintenance, as well as help
with logistics of daily operations.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.000
Airbus has added a new feature
to help airlines find parking.

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.080
Parking an airplane isn't as easy
as just finding a spot.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.950
Factors like how long the plane will
be out of service and what type

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.310
of maintenance needs to be done, play
a role in finding a location.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.610
A decision is made as to
whether it's basically storage or whether

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.740
it's actual parking.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.920
Now, parking is typically
relatively short term.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.840
It's a bit like putting something
in the fridge compared to longer

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.370
term storage, which would be where
you put it in the freezer.

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.730
So certain pieces of maintenance must be
done before you can pick up

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.270
an aircraft, even if it's just
for a couple of days.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.840
These aircraft cost hundreds of
millions of dollars and maintaining

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.440
them is not cheap. Even when parked,
they need to run the engines,

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.220
cycle fluids and move the tires,
among many other checklist items.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.150
This is why some airlines are flying
with just a few passengers aboard

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.340
just to keep them running.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.140
When airlines know the plane is going
to sit for months at a time,

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.410
they're sent to the desert because
the dry climate helps prevent

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.950
corrosion. If it sits on the ground
for one or two months and has

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.580
been operated that whole time, it
requires a lot more maintenance to

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.020
bring it back in the service than,
let's say, if it has been started

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.350
up every 10 days or so.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:11.340
I was just speaking with the
head of maintenance for significant U.S.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.060
airline. And what this person told me
is that right now they have

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.340
need for X number of aircraft,
but they're actually keeping 2X.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.780
In other words, twice as many active
and they're rotating them in and

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.380
out. So that way for those other
aircraft, they won't have to worry

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:32.940
about the more extensive maintenance
bringing them back in the

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:37.520
service. At the moment, w e have about
80% of the fleet in the park

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.630
ing mode. Eithad Airways, for example,
returned over 100 planes to

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.510
its main base in Abu Dhabi, where
it sealed up engines and sensors to

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:48.350
prevent things like sand from
getting into critical areas.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.320
They're a very intricate,
complex piece of machinery.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.350
It's not a lot parking a car.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.950
The outlook for coronavirus
is still unclear.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.680
Boeing told its shareholders that air
travel could take two to three

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.090
years to return to normal.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.020
Airlines have had to consolidate fleets
to cut back on costs.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:16.370
International travel has been hurt the
most and with good reason.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.860
And it's very difficult now
to travel between countries.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.480
This means that long haul aircraft,
which are generally what we call

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.570
twin aisles, or wide bodies are
going to suffer more than single

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.120
aisles like the 737 and 320.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.540
The A380, the big double decker
that Airbus launched a little bit

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:38.860
over a decade ago, every one
of those is on the ground.

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:40.920
A hundred percent of the
A380s are grounded today.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.030
The larger it is and the older
it is, the more it suffers.

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.120
So when you're down gauge, you're
going to go to the smaller

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.520
aircraft, the most
economical aircraft.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.440
Airlines before co ronavirus
were doing great.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.120
They had the highest employment levels
in the United States, at least

00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:59.880
in 17 years.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.360
They were hiring like crazy,
Pilots, flight attendants, expecting

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.450
this big rush in
travel to continue.

00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:09.960
And we've seen it over the
last decade, the decade of profitability.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.990
And now they're going to be
posting the first losses in years.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.540
Airlines have seen
incredible losses.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:18.380
And analysts don't expect that
to stop anytime soon.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.700
Like many businesses, large and small,
they're in survival mode and

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.470
looking for ways to conserve cash.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:28.880
Lack of demand could lead to
canceling or deferring future orders

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.950
from manufacturers.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.910
Airbus and Boeing have already
cut back on production.

00:08:33.010 --> 00:08:35.300
And both companies are
planning to slash jobs.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.440
As for the thousands of aircraft
parked around the world, retirement

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.360
could come much
earlier than expected.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:47.450
The thing to understand is that
before this crisis hit, airlines

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.360
couldn't get these planes fast enough
with one of their biggest

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.270
complaints was that
aircraft were delayed.

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:55.700
So the market for
aircraft was very high.

00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.170
Airbus and Boeing, which dominate
aircraft production, have been sold

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.800
out of some of their best sellers
through pretty much the middle of

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.350
the decade. So it was even
hard to get a slot.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:07.570
And we're going to see
that kind of reverse.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.010
And you'll see some cancellations.

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.480
You'll see deferrals. We'll see that
market sort of loosen up.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:17.300
But some airlines, because fuel is such
a big cost, they do want the

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:20.120
more fuel efficient
aircraft going forward.

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:24.220
But the timing of when they get
those planes, that's going to change.

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.670
It will all depend on
when demand comes back.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.680
6,000 of these are
15 years or older.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.690
4000 of these are 20 years or more.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.170
And so they're already
approaching retirement age.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:41.250
And we're in a situation now
where we have thousands of excess

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:45.560
aircraft. So if you're an airline
and you're deciding what aircraft

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.830
you're going to keep around, you
don't want to spend millions of

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:53.400
dollars on maintenance to keep your
older aircraft around for them to

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.550
fly into next year.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.670
So the impact here is dramatic.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.850
There is no timeline for when the
world will return back to normal.

00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:06.030
So for now, much of these aircraft
will sit waiting for the return to

00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:07.650
normalcy like the rest of us.
