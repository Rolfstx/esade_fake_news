00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.709
 Imagine the train that takes you from Washington, DC to Dallas, Texas in nine hours... or Paris, 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.831
 9 hours from France to Athens, Greece... or Adelaide in South Australia to Perth in the west 

00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:21.869
 Nine hours in Australia. 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.200
 These train journeys actually take 44 hours, 44 hours and 41 hours respectively 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.550
 The idea of ​​any of these trips by train seems almost absurd for nine hours. 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.510
 But in China, this is reality. 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.090
 In September 2018, the country opened a brand new high-speed railway line 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.030
 Train from Hong Kong to Beijing. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.270
 This is roughly the same distance from DC to Dallas, Paris to Athens, or Adelaide to Perth and 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.809
 However, these trains took only 8 hours and 56 minutes. 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.110
 What makes this even more impressive is ten years ago, in 2008, when 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.129
 The Beijing Olympic Games formed China's high-speed rail network. 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.330
 We have to zoom in because the degree of the network is a 19 mile long maglev train 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.700
 Train from Shanghai Airport to suburbs Shanghai and traditional high-speed railway 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.340
 From Beijing to the coastal city of Tianjin. 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.970
 Ten years later, the network has expanded into this. 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.770
 China’s high-speed circuit is eight times higher than France, ten times that of Japan, and twenty 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.260
 There is as much time as in the United Kingdom, and five hundred times as much as in the United States. 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.250
 In fact, China has as many high-speed rails as the rest of the world combined. 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.460
 The amount of progress they have made is shocking and they have achieved success in such a short period of time. 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.410
 Traditional high-speed railways exist in small, popular countries with large populations 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.660
 Germany, France and Japan 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.450
 China is neither of these things. 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.630
 This country is huge, the same size as the United States, and it is not rich. 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.810
 Although no longer poor, China is the ultimate middle-income country. 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.180
 It is as rich as Mexico and Thailand, or Brazil 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.380
 In fact, despite being related to the country’s fastest railway in the world, China is 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.380
 It is also any high-speed railway in the world's poorest country. 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.770
 Despite the size of this country, China’s huge population makes it very dense 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.030
 In the eastern half. 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.970
 This means that China does have big cities that are close together in reasonable places 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.420
 Take the train instead of the plane. 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.730
 For example, the travel distance from Guangzhou to Changsha is 350 miles, one hour or two hours by plane 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.580
 20 minutes by train. 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.630
 Consider the time it takes to check in, through security, and absolute boarding 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.840
 It makes sense to take a train while traveling, these two cities did not even consider 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.720
 That high-speed train flies cheaper than that one. 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.700
 High-speed rail makes sense even in China. On longer routes, it won’t be anywhere else. 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700
 country. 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.490
 For example, Beijing and Shanghai are 650 miles apart. 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.210
 Usually this is too much for high-speed railways. 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.180
 For example, Paris and Barcelona are 500 miles apart-closer than Beijing and Shanghai-but 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.090
 There are only two high-speed trains per day compared to two cities, with about 20 flights. 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.520
 Between Beijing and Shanghai, on the other hand, there are about 50 flights running every day. 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.540
 To train 41. 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.710
 Considering that the train carries more people, therefore, each train has a maximum of 1,200 trains 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.010
 The main transportation between these two cities. 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.710
 There are some differences between these two routes. 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:19.821
 First, take the train to Beijing and Shanghai. Even so, Paris-Barcelona has 4 hours and 28 minutes 

00:03:19.821 --> 00:03:23.880
 The distance is shorter and it takes longer 6 hours and 25 minutes. 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.760
 However, another factor is competition. 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.810
 Europe has an efficient air transport network often dominated by low-cost airlines 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.190
 Far cheaper than trains. 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.040
 You can find flights between Paris and Barcelona for just $12 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.640
 The cheapest airline ticket price for Beijing-Shanghai flights is $74. 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.860
 Air travel within China is also far from efficient. 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.220
 China Southern Airlines, China Eastern Airlines and China International Airlines China's three major airlines arrive 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.520
 The average on time is 67%, 66% and 63% respectively. 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.730
 An important reason for this is that there is not enough space in the sky. 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.740
 Most of China’s airspace is controlled by military airspace, meaning only these 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.990
 Narrow flight corridors, accounting for 30% of the airspace where civilian aircraft can fly 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:11.370
 There are a large number of aircraft, and there is not much space to fly. Aircraft are often delayed by air traffic. 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.360
 Controlled waiting for airspace to clear which resulted in bad on-time ratings 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.769
 The country's airline. 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.530
 Although Beijing-Shanghai flights only require two hours of potential delay, and 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.710
 All other factors that make air travel slower help to make trains a popular method 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.310
 Transport on this longer route. 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.130
 However, other train routes in China are not so well understood. 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.570
 For example, in 2014, a new high-speed train opened between Lanzhou and Urumqi. 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.330
 The relatively small scale of these two cities in China. 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:44.330
 They all have a population of 3.5 million and they are just small towns. 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.820
 They are also not close-about 1,000 miles apart. 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.600
 So the project can be compared from Denver to the construction of high-speed trains 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.650
 Seattle-Their moderately sized cities are far apart, and there is no big deal between the two. 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.190
 Some people will use it, but it is not economically meaningful to do so. 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.620
 In China, Lanzhou and Urumqi are not small cities, but it’s really no big deal 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.230
 Between, at that distance, there is no feeling of not flying. 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:14.970
 Lanzhou-Urumqi high-speed train requires 11 hours compared with 2.5 hours of flight 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.280
 The construction cost of the production line is $2 billion, which means that if every seat is like this 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.880
 Tickets filled with trains still cost $400 one way only to earn back 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.530
 The construction cost is 30 years. 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.890
 In fact, the ticket price is about $80 and the train is far from the full meaning of this railway line 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.710
 Just frantically away from profitability. 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.770
 According to reports, these trains do not even need to pay for electricity 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.510
 For lines, not to mention construction and other operating costs. 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.820
 So why does the Chinese government sink like this? Spend money on things that have no future 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.740
 Really make money? 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:50.950
 Okay, politics. 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.040
 Urumqi is the capital of Xinjiang. 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.630
 Although 92% of China’s population is the Han population, Xinjiang is mainly Uyghur 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:04.210
 China’s ethnic minority groups have always had quite a strong separatist 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.080
 The Uyghur movement from China often becomes violent. 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.010
 However, Beijing’s central government wants the same in Xinjiang 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.919
 Integration with other countries and regions of the country has tried various methods to force this 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:20.479
 Including the relocation of Han Chinese into the area and the imprisonment of so-called Uighurs 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:22.010
 "Re-education camp." 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.100
 High-speed trains are the most recent strategy to bring Xinjiang closer to Beijing 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.979
 This is no secret. 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.620
 The central government is completely in a leading position that this line is to promote, 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.790
 They call it "national unity". 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:37.460
 This is not even the first time they have used this railway political strategy. 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.320
 This area of ​​Tibet is better known than Xinjiang because of its independence movement, the last time 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.900
 There are no railways in China and the population is scarce and the terrain is rugged. 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.580
 The central government still hopes to establish it, but to bring it closer to other parts 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.080
 This country, so they did. 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.889
 The train now goes directly from Beijing to Lhasa, Tibet at the highest altitude of 47 hours 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:06:59.919
 Railway lines in the world. 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:05.900
 The altitude of these trains is 16,640 feet is too high, passengers have to use 

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.570
 Direct oxygen supply. 

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.100
 Even the train to Hong Kong is the goal of further integration of the central government 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.750
 Hong Kong, which is a special autonomous administrative region, has entered mainland China. 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.639
 The high-speed train that must go to Hong Kong is indeed more meaningful than the train 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.650
 There are many Hong Kong people in Xinjiang Province who are not as enthusiastic about welcoming new services as they are 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:27.759
 Treat them as violations of self-government and protect them by the Hong Kong Basic Law. 

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.400
 The most controversial part is not so. In fact, there is a train but that train 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:35.260
 Hong Kong’s station includes an area that is now actually part of mainland China 

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:39.449
 Because people pass the border control before boarding the train in Hong Kong. 

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:43.820
 Just like any country, with high speed, what China's efficient railway network is doing 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.240
 Unite the country and achieve its goals even if it comes together it is stronger 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.509
 People who want to separate. 

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:53.509
 Regardless of their motives, it is clear that China is building a high-speed rail network 

00:07:53.509 --> 00:07:55.830
 More efficient than any other country. 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.039
 For comparison, this is California's plan to arrive from San Francisco. High-speed railway line 

00:08:00.039 --> 00:08:01.330
 Los Angeles area. 

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:06.729
 It is currently in a very early stage of construction and is expected to open in 2029. 

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:09.630
 Of course, this means time to take California’s high-speed rail 

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.260
 The network from this to this is the same as China's high-speed rail time 

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.800
 The network goes from this to this. However, the main thing to look at is the cost. 

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.320
 This California network is expected to cost $77 billion and 520 miles long 

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.190
 Each mile will cost $148 million to build. 

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:31.860
 On the other hand, China is building their network at a cost of only $30 million each 

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:32.860
 mile. 

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:36.300
 Of course, China and China have lower labor costs and their network spans more rural areas 

00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:40.579
 Land acquisition costs are lower, but what makes more sense is that they have been converted into buildings 

00:08:40.579 --> 00:08:44.720
 High-speed railways have almost become assembly lines and they can even be mass-produced 

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.820
 The most expensive elements, such as viaducts and tunnels. 

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.329
 In real Chinese fashion, they have the scale to make high speed and cheap. 

00:08:52.329 --> 00:08:55.779
 The huge difference between China and many people in the Western world, especially the country 

00:08:55.779 --> 00:09:00.380
 Like the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom, that’s the high-speed rail 

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.490
 The government's top priority. 

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:07.170
 Unsurprisingly, given their government structure, in many ways, China has social benefits, 

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.129
 At least through the central definition of government, profitability before development 

00:09:11.129 --> 00:09:12.509
 Their high-speed rail network. 

00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:17.439
 The high-speed railway line is not so advantageous, but other transportation like an airplane but 

00:09:17.439 --> 00:09:21.759
 They are undoubtedly better for all countries so you must consider social welfare 

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:23.860
 When considering their overall profitability. 

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.260
 Suitable for high-speed rail routes from San Francisco to Los Angeles, for example, a study found 

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:33.300
 Social benefits from low-carbon emissions, increase worker efficiency and reduce casualties 

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.399
 There are fewer and fewer people coming from the road about $440 million per year. 

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:42.470
 It turns out that this is almost the exact amount the state must subsidize 

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:44.220
 Its break-even line. 

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:48.730
 The China Railway Corporation, a state-owned enterprise, is actually marginal, 

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.440
 Although it does have huge debts and is assisted by government subsidies. 

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.380
 However, the benefits to the Chinese people are great. 

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.019
 High-speed rail allows those who can’t to live in the most expensive cities 

00:09:59.019 --> 00:10:03.589
 Like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, it is easy to commute from cheaper suburbs by high speed 

00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:04.589
 rail. 

00:10:04.589 --> 00:10:09.319
 Due to the high-speed railway, 75 million people can now commute to get off work 

00:10:09.319 --> 00:10:10.319
 Within an hour. 

00:10:10.319 --> 00:10:15.470
 It is developing some of the largest cities already in existence. When it comes to cities, 

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:16.879
 Size is power. 

00:10:16.879 --> 00:10:20.529
 These lines connect the largest line cities in the east to some of the most profitable railways 

00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:24.839
 The lines of the world, they are living in China, working easier, but the problem 

00:10:24.839 --> 00:10:29.239
 Yes, when we look back decades, whether high-speed trains to small cities will 

00:10:29.239 --> 00:10:30.239
 Makes sense. 

00:10:30.239 --> 00:10:34.569
 Out of the desire to maintain a straight line between large cities, smaller stops 

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:38.220
 Cities are often in the countryside dozens of miles away from the city core. 

00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.649
 For example, the high-speed station in Hengyang is a small city with only one million 

00:10:42.649 --> 00:10:45.769
 45 minutes east of the city center. 

00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:50.310
 Hopefully, new developments will appear around the site but this network structure, 

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:54.639
 Even if it saves time on the train, wasting time before and after will reduce efficiency 

00:10:54.639 --> 00:10:56.300
 High-speed railway. 

00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.339
 Overall, China is really the first country to conduct long-distance, high-speed tests
