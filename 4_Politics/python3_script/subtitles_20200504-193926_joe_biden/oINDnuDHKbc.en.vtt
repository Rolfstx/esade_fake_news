00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
(applause)

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:06.467
Ms. Mabuse: 
You guys are an amazing crowd.

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:10.967
Good afternoon, and welcome to
the University of Johannesburg's

00:00:10.967 --> 00:00:12.266
Soweto campus.

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:16.066
My name is Nkepile Mabuse and
I will be the moderator

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:17.700
this afternoon.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.700
I really do hope that the strong
significance and symbolism of

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.867
what is happening here in Soweto
today does not escape you.

00:00:28.867 --> 00:00:33.333
There really are no two
occasions in recent time that

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:38.367
have had a more profound impact
on the African people than when

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:43.433
Nelson Mandela walked out of
prison a free man in 1990,

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:49.133
and of course, the election
of Barack Obama in 2008.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:52.867
Now, these two men are
politicians and their legacies

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:55.600
will be judged by history.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.166
But there's absolutely no doubt
that these two developments

00:01:00.166 --> 00:01:05.767
in history have had a profound
impact on the African continent.

00:01:05.767 --> 00:01:08.734
They have brought
hope in Africa,

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:14.133
and also began the process of
restoring pride and dignity

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.200
in the African people.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.867
Now, as I speak to you
and as you all know,

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:22.533
President Nelson Mandela
is lying in hospital,

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.100
critically ill.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.300
The euphoria that engulfed this
continent when President Obama

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:37.767
was elected is fading, but in
this room -- look around you --

00:01:37.767 --> 00:01:41.367
is Africa's brand new hope.

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:45.567
These young people are doing
amazing things

00:01:45.567 --> 00:01:47.967
in their communities.

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:51.467
They have already been
identified as leaders,

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:55.700
and leaders who are committed
to serving others

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.767
and not themselves.

00:01:57.767 --> 00:02:05.166
Exactly 37 years ago this month,
young school children here in

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:10.700
Soweto braved Apartheid
bullets, fighting for freedom.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.633
It's no coincidence that a new
generation of young people

00:02:15.633 --> 00:02:17.900
is here today.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.967
And like the '76 generation,
they refuse to conform,

00:02:22.967 --> 00:02:26.333
but are inspired to
transform their world.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:30.400
When President Obama launched
the Young African Leaders

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.834
Initiative in 2010, he described
them as the Africa

00:02:34.834 --> 00:02:36.767
that is overlooked.

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:42.600
Well, at this moment the
world can see and hear you.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.600
President Obama will come here,
address you and then engage you.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.166
We will take a question here in
South Africa before we cross

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:56.400
to Kenya, Uganda and
then Lagos, Nigeria.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.367
When the President selects
you, please, be proud.

00:03:01.367 --> 00:03:08.600
Introduce yourselves and ask a
short, sharp, smart question.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.367
(laughter)

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:15.600
As a fellow African,
I really want to thank you from

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.900
the bottom of my heart for
keeping hope alive in Africa.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.000
Please join me in welcoming
onstage the 44th President

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.900
of the United States of
America, Barack Obama.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:04:23.900
(applause)

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.000
The President:
Hello, everybody!

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.667
(applause)

00:04:30.667 --> 00:04:32.667
Yebo Mzansi!

00:04:32.667 --> 00:04:37.500
(applause)

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.233
Oh, it is wonderful
to be back in South Africa.

00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:42.033
Everybody have a seat,
everybody have a seat.

00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:45.533
Relax.

00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:46.700
Yes, I'm excited, too.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.000
(applause)

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.633
It is wonderful
to be here with all these

00:04:55.633 --> 00:05:00.767
extraordinary young people --
young people from across this

00:05:00.767 --> 00:05:05.200
magnificent country, but also
from all across the continent.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.367
And I want to give special
thanks and special welcome

00:05:08.367 --> 00:05:13.533
to those who are watching from
Nigeria and Uganda and Kenya,

00:05:13.533 --> 00:05:17.700
a country obviously
very close to my heart.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.300
When I travel around the world,
this is one of my favorite

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.867
things to do -- meeting and
talking with young men

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:27.767
and women like you.

00:05:27.767 --> 00:05:32.734
And our format today, this town
hall is a longstanding tradition

00:05:32.734 --> 00:05:37.834
in America, and I get
asked all sorts of things.

00:05:37.834 --> 00:05:40.567
I remember one event, a person
asked a question that's often

00:05:40.567 --> 00:05:44.433
on a lot of people's minds when
I show up: Where's Michelle?

00:05:44.433 --> 00:05:47.500
(laughter)

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.367
Sometimes
people ask me,

00:05:49.367 --> 00:05:53.100
you seem to have gotten so
old since you were elected --

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.367
(laughter)

00:05:54.367 --> 00:05:56.133
-- what happened?

00:05:56.133 --> 00:06:00.967
(laughs) So this format can
be a little humbling,

00:06:00.967 --> 00:06:06.700
but it energizes me because it
gives me a chance to hear from

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.367
you directly what you're
thinking, what you care about,

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:12.400
what your vision is.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.000
And I'm making this trip to
Africa because I believe this

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.333
is a region on the move.

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:21.900
Even as this continent faces
great challenges -- and they are

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.767
great, and we can't paper over
them or pretend that those

00:06:25.767 --> 00:06:30.400
challenges don't exist -- even
as too many Africans still

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.800
endure tremendous hardship and
great injustice, there is,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:41.867
as the song says -- a "new
Africa" -- more prosperous,

00:06:41.867 --> 00:06:47.967
more confident, taking its
place on the world stage.

00:06:47.967 --> 00:06:52.700
And one of the reasons is
because of your generation.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.867
And it's fitting that we've
gathered here, in Jo'burg,

00:06:55.867 --> 00:07:00.133
in Soweto, because here we
learned that history

00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:03.333
is in our hands.

00:07:03.333 --> 00:07:06.033
Not far from here,
in Orlando West,

00:07:06.033 --> 00:07:09.734
two young men came of age who
would transform this nation and

00:07:09.734 --> 00:07:16.667
inspire the world -- Nelson
Mandela and Desmond Tutu.

00:07:16.667 --> 00:07:20.266
And President Mandela once said
that during all those years

00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:24.734
in that cell, it was his home
here in Soweto -- that small

00:07:24.734 --> 00:07:29.834
red-brick house -- that was what
he called the "center point

00:07:29.834 --> 00:07:33.834
of my world."

00:07:33.834 --> 00:07:36.133
And obviously he's
on our minds today,

00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:39.367
and we join the people of the
world in sending our prayers to

00:07:39.367 --> 00:07:45.433
Madiba and his family because
he still inspires us all.

00:07:45.433 --> 00:07:48.367
Now, not far from here,
on a June morning,

00:07:48.367 --> 00:07:53.133
young students gathered in
peaceful protest for the right

00:07:53.133 --> 00:07:55.000
to be taught in
their own language,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.834
for the right to be
treated like human beings.

00:07:59.834 --> 00:08:01.600
And after all the
police bullets,

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:05.834
after the smoke cleared, the
world was shocked by that image

00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:10.066
-- protesters holding
the body of a young boy,

00:08:10.066 --> 00:08:12.967
Hector Pieterson.

00:08:12.967 --> 00:08:15.734
And what a powerful tribute
it is to Hector's sacrifice,

00:08:15.734 --> 00:08:19.166
and to all who struggled, that
we can gather here today

00:08:19.166 --> 00:08:22.600
in a free South Africa at a
university that serves

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.467
all South Africans.

00:08:26.467 --> 00:08:29.767
And I know the story of Soweto
inspires you in your lives,

00:08:29.767 --> 00:08:33.900
but keep in mind it
inspired me, too.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:38.266
The uprising here helped open my
mind to a broader world and to

00:08:38.266 --> 00:08:42.133
our responsibilities to choose
between fairness and injustice,

00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:45.767
between right and wrong.

00:08:45.767 --> 00:08:48.700
And as a Senator, during my
first visit to South Africa,

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:51.567
I was able to go to Hector
Pieterson's memorial and pay

00:08:51.567 --> 00:08:56.567
tribute to an African
boy who moved the world.

00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:59.667
And humbled by the sacrifices of
all who have gone before us

00:08:59.667 --> 00:09:03.066
so that we can stand here
as free men and women,

00:09:03.066 --> 00:09:06.233
I am honored to return to Soweto
now as President of the

00:09:06.233 --> 00:09:07.600
United States of America.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:17.934
(applause)

00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:19.500
Now, tomorrow I'll
be down in Cape Town at the

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.100
University of Cape Town, and
I'll speak about the future that

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.900
we can build together --
Africans and Americans.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.800
And that's where Robert Kennedy
delivered his eloquent address

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.233
to another generation
of young people.

00:09:32.233 --> 00:09:34.133
The challenges of
our world, he said,

00:09:34.133 --> 00:09:39.367
demand "the qualities of
youth; not a time in life,

00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:43.033
but a state of mind,
a temper of the will,

00:09:43.033 --> 00:09:48.300
a quality of the imagination,
a predominance of courage over

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:52.367
timidity, of the appetite for
adventure over

00:09:52.367 --> 00:09:54.367
the love of ease."

00:09:54.367 --> 00:09:58.033
That's what young people are.

00:09:58.033 --> 00:10:02.667
That's the spirit of
youth, and it's still true.

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:05.000
That's why three years ago, I
launched a new effort to make

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.066
sure we're tapping those
qualities of youth --

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:13.266
the imagination, the
courage, the "yes, we can"

00:10:13.266 --> 00:10:18.066
attitude of
young Africans like you.

00:10:18.066 --> 00:10:20.033
It's our Young African
Leaders Initiative,

00:10:20.033 --> 00:10:23.867
and I kicked it off by welcoming
young men and women from across

00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:27.633
Africa to the White House, and
we had a town hall similar

00:10:27.633 --> 00:10:28.500
to this one.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:31.400
I think some of you
were there, in fact.

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.633
And since then, we've helped
empower young people across this

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:37.734
continent with new skills and
entrepreneurship and leadership,

00:10:37.734 --> 00:10:39.867
and new partnerships in
education and health

00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:42.000
and technology.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.900
Michelle came here to Soweto
for a forum with some inspiring

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.900
young women, and she's here
today in Jozi meeting with

00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.133
students who -- (laughter)
-- did I say that wrong?

00:10:54.133 --> 00:10:59.967
(applause)

00:10:59.967 --> 00:11:01.500
-- meeting with students who, like you,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.900
are going to determine the
future of your countries.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:09.834
So today, I'm proud to announce
a significant expansion

00:11:09.834 --> 00:11:10.900
of this initiative.

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.166
We're launching a new program
that's going to give thousands

00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:16.633
of promising young Africans like
you the opportunity to come

00:11:16.633 --> 00:11:19.800
to the United States and develop
your skills at some of our best

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.200
colleges and universities.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:30.800
(applause)

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.600
It's called the
Washington Fellowship for Young

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:36.033
African Leaders, and I hope
all of you apply because we're

00:11:36.033 --> 00:11:39.533
joining with our top schools
-- public and private.

00:11:39.533 --> 00:11:43.200
We'll focus on civic leadership
and public administration and

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.133
business and entrepreneurship,
the skills you need to serve

00:11:47.133 --> 00:11:49.266
your communities and start
and grow businesses

00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:52.367
and run effective ministries.

00:11:52.367 --> 00:11:54.200
And you'll interact with
Americans from all walks of

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.266
life, because our citizens --
especially our young people --

00:11:58.266 --> 00:12:01.467
can learn from you, too.

00:12:01.467 --> 00:12:04.934
You'll meet with leaders in
business and nonprofits

00:12:04.934 --> 00:12:08.533
and government, including me.

00:12:08.533 --> 00:12:11.166
And I look forward to welcoming
you at a summit that I'll host

00:12:11.166 --> 00:12:14.467
in Washington, because I want to
hear directly from you -- your

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:18.800
hopes, your dreams, what
we can achieve together.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.667
And your time in America
will be just the beginning.

00:12:21.667 --> 00:12:24.967
When you come back home, new
grants will help you turn your

00:12:24.967 --> 00:12:28.233
ideas into new businesses
and new non-profits.

00:12:28.233 --> 00:12:30.700
And we're going to partner with
American companies here

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.867
in Africa to provide internships
and mentoring and job

00:12:33.867 --> 00:12:36.367
opportunities to help you grow
into the next generation

00:12:36.367 --> 00:12:39.000
of business leaders.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.200
We're going to partner with
your governments and regional

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:45.400
organizations here in Africa and
foundations and civil society to

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.700
amplify your voices as you stand
up for democracy and equality.

00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:53.467
And with the connections you
make as a Washington Fellow,

00:12:53.467 --> 00:12:55.333
you'll have something else
for the rest of your life,

00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:58.967
and that is a network of
Africans and Americans ready

00:12:58.967 --> 00:13:04.300
to collaborate on the future
that you want to build.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:08.767
So this won't be the most
expensive program that we have,

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:10.533
but I actually believe this is
going to end up being one

00:13:10.533 --> 00:13:13.066
of the most important.

00:13:13.066 --> 00:13:15.433
And it's important
to me personally,

00:13:15.433 --> 00:13:19.467
because it's a great way for me
to show my faith and confidence

00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:23.200
in all of you.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.133
I believe in you, and I intend
to make this a lasting part of

00:13:26.133 --> 00:13:29.100
our engagement with Africa
beyond my presidency,

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.433
for years to come.

00:13:31.433 --> 00:13:36.567
We want to empower entrepreneurs
like Fred Swaniker.

00:13:36.567 --> 00:13:37.667
Where's Fred?

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:38.700
He's from Ghana.

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:39.633
(applause)

00:13:39.633 --> 00:13:40.600
Where is he?

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.900
(applause)

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.166
There he is.

00:13:45.166 --> 00:13:48.166
(applause)

00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:51.900
So Fred has got a
fan club over here.

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:55.567
(laughter and applause)

00:13:55.567 --> 00:13:58.533
Fred helped to start a biotech company, and now uses his

00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:00.900
expertise to help other young Africans develop their

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:03.533
leadership skills so that they can come back and put

00:14:03.533 --> 00:14:06.633
those skills to use serving their communities, starting

00:14:06.633 --> 00:14:08.500
businesses, creating jobs.

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.033
So thank you, Fred, for the
great work that you're doing.

00:14:10.033 --> 00:14:16.400
(applause)

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:19.633
We want to empower
citizens like Khadija Patel.

00:14:19.633 --> 00:14:21.467
Where's Khadija?

00:14:21.467 --> 00:14:22.800
Khadija?

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.166
(applause)

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.166
So Khadija is a
fearless journalist here

00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:30.166
in South Africa.

00:14:30.166 --> 00:14:33.400
She's reported on
Sudan, and Mali,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.400
and the Democratic
Republic of Congo.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.900
(applause)

00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:40.367
She's exposed
the roots of conflict,

00:14:40.367 --> 00:14:43.467
she's challenged leaders as a
voice for peace and justice.

00:14:43.467 --> 00:14:45.367
So we're very proud of the
work that you do, Khadija.

00:14:45.367 --> 00:14:46.533
Thank you.

00:14:46.533 --> 00:14:51.567
(applause)

00:14:51.567 --> 00:14:54.233
We want to empower
advocates like Jacob Jabari.

00:14:54.233 --> 00:14:55.600
Where's Jacob?

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.700
Right here.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:02.533
(applause)

00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:05.000
So here
in South Africa,

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.033
Jacob decided he was not going
to hide the fact that he was HIV

00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:11.367
positive; he embraced it,
he became a counselor.

00:15:11.367 --> 00:15:14.433
He helps guide others, because
he says the key to saving lives

00:15:14.433 --> 00:15:17.500
and slowing the spread of
AIDS is an honest approach,

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:18.533
and that takes great courage.

00:15:18.533 --> 00:15:19.667
Thank you, Jacob.

00:15:19.667 --> 00:15:28.500
(applause)

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:33.800
And we want to empower women like Lebo Bogapane.

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.000
Lebo?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.667
(applause)

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:45.100
Growing up, Lebo
endured domestic abuse

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.900
and violence, which led to
homelessness and hunger.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:51.400
Over many years, she didn't
simply rebuild her own life,

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.800
she built a crisis center here
in South Africa that's helped

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.734
thousands of women and
children escape abuse as well.

00:15:59.734 --> 00:16:00.934
What a great legacy.

00:16:00.934 --> 00:16:02.133
Thank you, Lebo.

00:16:02.133 --> 00:16:08.834
(applause)

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:12.633
So building
the future that you seek,

00:16:12.633 --> 00:16:14.700
realizing the vision
that you have,

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:18.734
not just for your own countries
but for the world --

00:16:18.734 --> 00:16:22.934
it will not be easy.

00:16:22.934 --> 00:16:24.633
It will not be easy.

00:16:24.633 --> 00:16:28.333
But as you go forward, I want
you to think of the man who's

00:16:28.333 --> 00:16:29.900
in our prayers today.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:36.467
Think about 27 years in prison.

00:16:36.467 --> 00:16:39.166
Think about the hardships and
the struggles and being away

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:42.500
from family and friends.

00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.266
Reflecting on his
years in prison,

00:16:44.266 --> 00:16:47.266
Nelson Mandela wrote that there
were dark moments that tested

00:16:47.266 --> 00:16:52.567
his faith in humanity,
but he refused to give up.

00:16:52.567 --> 00:16:55.934
And he said, "I am
fundamentally an optimist.

00:16:55.934 --> 00:17:00.633
Whether that comes from nature
or nurture, I cannot say.

00:17:00.633 --> 00:17:03.934
Part of being optimistic is
keeping one's head pointed

00:17:03.934 --> 00:17:09.600
towards the sun, one's
feet moving forward."

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.300
So in your lives, there will
be time to test your faith.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:18.100
But no matter how old you grow,
I say to all of you today,

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.133
don't lose those qualities of
youth -- your imagination,

00:17:22.133 --> 00:17:25.800
your optimism, your idealism.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.734
Because the future of this
continent is in your hands,

00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:31.133
and if you keep your head
pointed towards the sun and you

00:17:31.133 --> 00:17:37.367
keep your feet moving forward, I
promise you will have no better

00:17:37.367 --> 00:17:40.967
friend and partner than the
United States of America.

00:17:40.967 --> 00:17:42.333
Thank you
very much, everybody.

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:43.100
Thank you.

00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:54.266
(applause)

00:17:54.266 --> 00:17:57.333
So now I get to do what
I really want to do,

00:17:57.333 --> 00:17:59.533
which is to hear from you.

00:17:59.533 --> 00:18:02.333
So why don't we open
it up for questions.

00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:06.400
And I understand that we've got
somebody from South Africa

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.367
here perhaps.

00:18:07.367 --> 00:18:11.033
Ms. Mabuse: 
Yes, the plan is
to get somebody here in Soweto

00:18:11.033 --> 00:18:14.967
before we move across to
other parts of the continent.

00:18:14.967 --> 00:18:16.266
The President: 
Okay.

00:18:16.266 --> 00:18:18.533
Ms. Mabuse: 
The choice is yours, Mr. President.

00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:20.266
The President: 
Well, this
is a good-looking group.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:25.800
Let me -- (laughter) -- I'm
going to call on this young lady

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.100
right here.

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.033
Introduce yourself.

00:18:30.033 --> 00:18:31.734
Audience Member: 
Good afternoon,
President Obama.

00:18:31.734 --> 00:18:33.133
My name is Melissa (ph).

00:18:33.133 --> 00:18:35.400
I'm an attorney, and I'm
passionate about telecoms

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:36.934
in Africa.

00:18:36.934 --> 00:18:41.600
My question is: The African
Growth and Opportunities Act,

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:46.033
the term expires in 2015, and I
understand there's a bill which

00:18:46.033 --> 00:18:49.934
provides for an
extension to 2019.

00:18:49.934 --> 00:18:52.233
Do you think this
bill will be passed?

00:18:52.233 --> 00:18:57.000
And if it isn't passed, what do
you think the impact will be on

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.767
small states in Africa
that are benefiting,

00:18:59.767 --> 00:19:02.066
such as Lesotho and Togo?

00:19:02.066 --> 00:19:03.166
The President: 
Well, it's a great question.

00:19:03.166 --> 00:19:04.166
(applause)

00:19:04.166 --> 00:19:08.467
By the way, what
kind of law are you practicing?

00:19:08.467 --> 00:19:12.166
Audience Member: 
Oh, right now I actually do
cross-border African work.

00:19:12.166 --> 00:19:12.633
The President: 
Excellent.

00:19:12.633 --> 00:19:13.967
Audience Member: 
Yes, (inaudible) work.

00:19:13.967 --> 00:19:16.800
The President: 
Fantastic.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.533
Well, for those of you who
are not as familiar with it,

00:19:21.533 --> 00:19:25.533
the program we call AGOA is
basically a trade arrangement

00:19:25.533 --> 00:19:31.567
that allows probably 95 percent
of goods from Africa to come

00:19:31.567 --> 00:19:37.400
into the United States
without tariffs, duty-free.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:44.667
And, as a consequence, it
obviously gives African exports

00:19:44.667 --> 00:19:46.333
a greater advantage.

00:19:46.333 --> 00:19:51.233
And the whole idea
is that historically,

00:19:51.233 --> 00:19:55.066
if you look at the relationship
between Africa and the rest of

00:19:55.066 --> 00:20:00.700
the global market, dating
back to colonial days,

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:04.800
the idea was somehow that raw
materials get sent somewhere

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.934
else, they got produced
somewhere or refined somewhere

00:20:07.934 --> 00:20:11.266
else; sometimes they're sold
back to Africa, but the jobs,

00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:15.900
the value, the profits
are all someplace else.

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:26.967
And we graduated from those
colonial times to the idea of

00:20:26.967 --> 00:20:30.700
aid, which continues to
be critically important.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.900
There are parts of Africa
that -- where, right now,

00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.367
people just need food, or right
now people just need medicine,

00:20:38.367 --> 00:20:42.767
and it is the obligation of
wealthier nations to help

00:20:42.767 --> 00:20:47.734
deliver that food
or that medicine.

00:20:47.734 --> 00:20:53.100
But everywhere I go in Africa,
what's very clear is people want

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:58.633
to break out of a
dependency trap.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:03.734
The idea is not that Africa
somehow should be the ward

00:21:03.734 --> 00:21:06.967
of some other country.

00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:12.700
What we need is an Africa that
is building, manufacturing,

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:18.767
creating value, inventing, and
then sending those products

00:21:18.767 --> 00:21:22.767
around the world and receiving
products in return in fair

00:21:22.767 --> 00:21:24.734
terms of trade.

00:21:24.734 --> 00:21:29.033
And if we do that, then there's
no reason why

00:21:29.033 --> 00:21:31.734
Africa cannot succeed.

00:21:31.734 --> 00:21:38.300
So part of what I'm trying to
highlight during this trip is

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:43.400
the enormous opportunities for
an Africa that is intimately

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.834
integrated into
the world market.

00:21:48.834 --> 00:21:53.467
I want small and medium-sized
businesses and entrepreneurs and

00:21:53.467 --> 00:21:58.467
startups here in Africa to see
their potential not just in the

00:21:58.467 --> 00:22:02.934
local market, but to be able
to sell goods and service all

00:22:02.934 --> 00:22:06.767
around the world and to bring
those profits back to Africa

00:22:06.767 --> 00:22:10.266
and reinvest in Africa
and hire Africans.

00:22:10.266 --> 00:22:15.100
And so as part of that, we want
to make sure that

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:17.734
the United States is a critical
trading partner.

00:22:17.734 --> 00:22:19.867
And, by the way, we're not
doing it out of charity.

00:22:19.867 --> 00:22:23.800
We're doing it because
if Africa is doing well,

00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:27.700
then now we've got a market of
people who want to buy more

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:35.533
iPads and -- (laughter) --
Boeing airplanes and all the

00:22:35.533 --> 00:22:38.767
good stuff that we sell, right?

00:22:38.767 --> 00:22:42.300
And Africa, by the way,
is the youngest continent,

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.900
which means that demographically
this is going to be a larger

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:49.700
and larger share of
the world market.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:51.667
So specifically,
in terms of AGOA,

00:22:51.667 --> 00:23:01.467
you're right -- the current
AGOA structure expires in 2015.

00:23:01.467 --> 00:23:05.066
It is my hope that
we get it renewed.

00:23:05.066 --> 00:23:07.300
Now, what I mentioned to
President Zuma today,

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.867
and I said this at
a press conference,

00:23:09.867 --> 00:23:15.333
is that we will have to engage
in some negotiations to find

00:23:15.333 --> 00:23:19.066
ways to both improve what
we're currently doing,

00:23:19.066 --> 00:23:23.500
but also to reflect on the fact
that South Africa is becoming

00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:29.066
more and more
successful, and that U.S.

00:23:29.066 --> 00:23:32.834
businesses -- in order for me to
get it through Congress in the

00:23:32.834 --> 00:23:35.567
United States, U.S. businesses have to feel as if they're

00:23:35.567 --> 00:23:40.467
getting a level playing field relative to, for example,

00:23:40.467 --> 00:23:42.934
some of the European companies who are able to operate here --

00:23:42.934 --> 00:23:46.166
because there's a free trade agreement between Europe

00:23:46.166 --> 00:23:49.400
and the United States.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.934
But I'm confident that
with good negotiations,

00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:56.800
that we should be
able to get it done.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.600
The broader point I
want to make, though,

00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:04.333
is that the future is going to
be in creating value here in

00:24:04.333 --> 00:24:13.734
Africa and making sure then that
Southeast Asia and China and

00:24:13.734 --> 00:24:18.066
Turkey, and all these other
places around the world that

00:24:18.066 --> 00:24:21.233
everybody is starting to see
the benefits of

00:24:21.233 --> 00:24:22.700
global trade patterns.

00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:26.467
And Africa cannot just be a
source of raw materials

00:24:26.467 --> 00:24:27.800
for somebody else.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:33.400
It has to be a source of the
kinds of products and services

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:36.700
and imagination that is going
to be the future

00:24:36.700 --> 00:24:39.633
of the 21st century.

00:24:39.633 --> 00:24:40.800
Thank you.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:46.600
(applause)

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:52.333
Ms. Mabuse: 
We have a young person in Kenya who has a question for you.

00:24:52.333 --> 00:24:54.600
Kenya, you ready?

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:59.100
There we go.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:00.867
Kenya Moderator: 
Thank you, South Africa.

00:25:00.867 --> 00:25:04.367
You are watching us, broadcasted
to you live from Nairobi here

00:25:04.367 --> 00:25:06.166
in Kenya's capital.

00:25:06.166 --> 00:25:10.400
And indeed I'm joined by eight
young Kenyans who have come in

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.266
from five different counties
within the country,

00:25:12.266 --> 00:25:13.300
quite excited.

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:15.734
I think I speak for all of them
when I say that indeed it's an

00:25:15.734 --> 00:25:18.934
honor to be able to engage
with you, Mr. President,

00:25:18.934 --> 00:25:21.300
while directly
during this program.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:24.567
And I'll just get right to it
and give an opportunity for one

00:25:24.567 --> 00:25:28.633
of the Kenyans who is with
me here to be able to ask a

00:25:28.633 --> 00:25:30.767
question to you, Mr. President.

00:25:30.767 --> 00:25:32.333
Margaret (ph), you
have the floor now.

00:25:32.333 --> 00:25:33.800
Audience Member: 
Thank you, Katherine (ph).

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.367
Jambo, Barack Obama, President.

00:25:36.367 --> 00:25:38.967
We are honored to be with you
live today this afternoon

00:25:38.967 --> 00:25:40.533
from Nairobi, Kenya.

00:25:40.533 --> 00:25:43.500
Our question to you really is,
given the recent shift of trade

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.200
ties of Kenya to the East, how
does this impact on American

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.867
foreign policy towards Kenya?

00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:52.300
And does the ICC indictment of
our President and his

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:54.333
deputy prevent the U.S.

00:25:54.333 --> 00:25:58.500
from engaging with Kenya both
politically and economically?

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.767
In addition, Mr. President, many
Kenyan youth would like to know

00:26:01.767 --> 00:26:05.800
what are your thoughts and
plans on youth empowerment that

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.133
involve structure of
governance to Kenya?

00:26:09.133 --> 00:26:10.000
Thank you.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:10.867
Kenya Moderator:
Now, Mr. President,

00:26:10.867 --> 00:26:12.967
as you prepare to
respond to that question,

00:26:12.967 --> 00:26:15.867
I'm sure you're alive to the
fact that there has been a lot

00:26:15.867 --> 00:26:18.767
of speculation in the Kenyan
media and also in the social

00:26:18.767 --> 00:26:21.767
media for your reasons for not
visiting Kenya on your second

00:26:21.767 --> 00:26:23.033
tour of Africa.

00:26:23.033 --> 00:26:25.867
Maybe if you recall in an
interview that you did have with

00:26:25.867 --> 00:26:29.934
this channel that is way
back on the 1st of June 2010,

00:26:29.934 --> 00:26:33.600
you did a promise that during
your tenure as President of the

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.800
United States of America,
you will be touring Kenya.

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.066
Well, will you still
keep your word on that?

00:26:39.066 --> 00:26:46.900
(laughter and applause)

00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:49.500
The President: 
Well, Asante Sana.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.734
It's wonderful to
see all of you.

00:26:52.734 --> 00:26:56.567
(laughter)

00:26:56.567 --> 00:27:00.767
First of all, let me
just say that I'm going to be

00:27:00.767 --> 00:27:02.800
President for another
three and a half years.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.233
(laughter and applause)

00:27:05.233 --> 00:27:10.967
One of the things that you learn as President is not only do

00:27:10.967 --> 00:27:15.133
people want you to fulfill your promises, but they want you to

00:27:15.133 --> 00:27:17.300
fulfill your promises yesterday.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.400
(laughter)

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:22.867
And part of the
reason that I wasn't able to

00:27:22.867 --> 00:27:31.800
visit Kenya this time is I've
been to Kenya multiple times and

00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:37.533
there hadn't been a sustained
visit by me in West Africa;

00:27:37.533 --> 00:27:41.266
and then South Africa, given
the importance of the work that

00:27:41.266 --> 00:27:44.667
we're doing together; Tanzania
is a country

00:27:44.667 --> 00:27:46.633
I hadn't visited before.

00:27:46.633 --> 00:27:49.800
So I was trying to spread the
wealth a little bit in terms

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:52.233
of my visit.

00:27:52.233 --> 00:27:54.567
But what's also
true, I won't deny,

00:27:54.567 --> 00:27:58.533
is that Kenya just
had an election.

00:27:58.533 --> 00:28:03.734
I was very proud to see the
restraint in which

00:28:03.734 --> 00:28:05.000
the election was held.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.066
We did not see a repeat of the
violence that we saw

00:28:07.066 --> 00:28:09.400
in the last election.

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:14.567
But with a new administration
that's also having to manage

00:28:14.567 --> 00:28:19.533
some of the international
issues around the ICC,

00:28:19.533 --> 00:28:23.433
I did not think it was the
optimal time for me to visit.

00:28:23.433 --> 00:28:26.033
But as I said, I'm going to --
I've got three and a half years.

00:28:26.033 --> 00:28:33.533
So if in three years and seven
months I'm not in Kenya,

00:28:33.533 --> 00:28:37.133
then you can fault me for not
following through on my promise.

00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:38.233
(laughter)

00:28:43.233 --> 00:28:47.567
You raise the issue
of whether our attitudes towards

00:28:47.567 --> 00:28:53.033
Kenya changed because of Kenya's
orientation towards trade

00:28:53.033 --> 00:28:55.333
and commerce with the East.

00:28:55.333 --> 00:28:58.100
And this was asked of me before
-- it's a general question that

00:28:58.100 --> 00:29:01.367
I get during this visit;
people saying, well,

00:29:01.367 --> 00:29:06.567
China is here a lot, and is this
what's motivating America to

00:29:06.567 --> 00:29:10.233
want to be more involved.

00:29:10.233 --> 00:29:11.433
And I want to make two points.

00:29:11.433 --> 00:29:17.900
First of all, our commitment to
Africa is based on our belief

00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:20.667
in Africa's promise
and Africa's future,

00:29:20.667 --> 00:29:24.567
and we want to be
part of that future.

00:29:24.567 --> 00:29:32.734
Second of all, I think everybody
should be involved in Africa.

00:29:32.734 --> 00:29:34.367
(applause)

00:29:34.367 --> 00:29:36.834
I want China and I
want India and I want Brazil,

00:29:36.834 --> 00:29:40.233
and I want Singapore
-- everybody,

00:29:40.233 --> 00:29:46.166
come on down -- (laughter)
-- to Africa because 6 of the

00:29:46.166 --> 00:29:49.400
10-fastest growing economies
in the world are right

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:53.000
here in Africa.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.233
You are seeing a
shift inside of Africa in which

00:29:58.233 --> 00:30:02.533
a commitment to democracy and
transparency is beginning

00:30:02.533 --> 00:30:05.633
to take hold.

00:30:05.633 --> 00:30:11.934
I just visited Senegal, where
President Sall has embarked

00:30:11.934 --> 00:30:13.867
on a reform agenda,
including, by the way,

00:30:13.867 --> 00:30:18.533
shortening his term from
seven years to five years,

00:30:18.533 --> 00:30:23.500
and a belief that, for example,
members who join the government

00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:27.600
need to disclose their assets
-- just basic measures that can

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.767
help to root out corruption.

00:30:29.767 --> 00:30:33.166
And so when you start
seeing these changes,

00:30:33.166 --> 00:30:35.734
everybody should be excited
about wanting to do business

00:30:35.734 --> 00:30:39.967
here in Africa and doing
business with Kenya.

00:30:39.967 --> 00:30:41.734
Now, what I said during a press
conference today I want to

00:30:41.734 --> 00:30:46.867
repeat, which is I want to make
sure that as countries come

00:30:46.867 --> 00:30:53.233
to Africa, that it's
benefiting Africans.

00:30:53.233 --> 00:30:56.800
So if somebody is building
a road here in Africa,

00:30:56.800 --> 00:31:01.533
make sure they're
hiring some Africans.

00:31:01.533 --> 00:31:06.266
(applause)

00:31:06.266 --> 00:31:10.800
If there's going to
be manufacturing taking place of

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.266
raw materials, locate some of
those plants here in Africa.

00:31:16.266 --> 00:31:22.567
And so I do want to make sure
that whoever you're dealing with

00:31:22.567 --> 00:31:25.367
-- and as you enter into
government and business --

00:31:25.367 --> 00:31:27.166
whoever you're dealing with,
making sure you're getting a

00:31:27.166 --> 00:31:32.166
good deal that's benefiting the
people here and can help to spur

00:31:32.166 --> 00:31:35.000
on broad-based development.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.533
And, hopefully, that's the kind
of relationship that you'll

00:31:37.533 --> 00:31:40.266
be able to develop with the
United States of America.

00:31:40.266 --> 00:31:41.700
And that's the kind of
relationship I want Kenya

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.767
to have with every
country on Earth.

00:31:45.767 --> 00:31:50.900
We're in a global economy
with a global supply chain,

00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:53.133
and I don't want Africa to
continually just be at the

00:31:53.133 --> 00:31:55.467
bottom of the supply chain.

00:31:55.467 --> 00:31:59.266
You produce the raw
materials, sold cheap,

00:31:59.266 --> 00:32:02.300
and then all the way up the
chain somebody else is making

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:08.800
the money and creating
the jobs and the value.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.700
So part of what your
generation's challenge will be

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:19.700
is making sure that, first of
all, you have a transparent,

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:29.266
accountable, non-corrupt, open
government -- because economic

00:32:29.266 --> 00:32:33.700
development is not going to
happen in the absence of that

00:32:33.700 --> 00:32:35.066
kind of certainty.

00:32:35.066 --> 00:32:37.133
That's what businesses want.

00:32:37.133 --> 00:32:40.367
They don't want to have to pay
a bribe just to get phone lines

00:32:40.367 --> 00:32:43.000
installed in their business.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.200
They don't want to have to hire
somebody's cousin just

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.200
to open a business.

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.400
And we have to be
honest about it.

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.467
In a lot of countries,
that's still the case,

00:32:52.467 --> 00:32:57.367
and that discourages investment.

00:32:57.367 --> 00:33:00.233
And then as you move
into positions of power,

00:33:00.233 --> 00:33:03.133
I want to make sure that you're
negotiating a good deal with

00:33:03.133 --> 00:33:04.000
these other countries.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.800
Now, it's got to be realistic.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.633
It's got to be based on what
assets do you bring to bear.

00:33:10.633 --> 00:33:14.100
And initially, at least in some
countries and in some regions in

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:21.500
parts of Africa, you're
looking at a certain type of

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:28.500
manufacturing or a certain type
of industry that may not be very

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.867
capital-intensive, for example,
because there may not be as much

00:33:31.867 --> 00:33:35.133
capital initially to invest.

00:33:35.133 --> 00:33:39.400
So it may start at a smaller
scale but continually upgrading

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:42.734
and improving the prospects for
Africa I think will require that

00:33:42.734 --> 00:33:46.200
kind of tough,
hardheaded negotiations.

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.633
But I want every
country to be here.

00:33:48.633 --> 00:33:51.867
Last point on Kenya -- I already
made this for all countries --

00:33:51.867 --> 00:33:54.667
yes, I want young people to
be involved in holding their

00:33:54.667 --> 00:33:56.734
governments accountable.

00:33:56.734 --> 00:34:06.200
Now, there is a lot of variety
here in Africa in terms of

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.900
quality of governance.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.633
And I don't want to reinforce
for the American press that are

00:34:12.633 --> 00:34:20.600
here this attitude that Africa
is just one big piece of land

00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.934
on the map.

00:34:21.934 --> 00:34:29.166
(applause)

00:34:29.166 --> 00:34:31.133
There's
a lot of variation.

00:34:31.133 --> 00:34:34.433
Some countries are doing
great work when it comes to

00:34:34.433 --> 00:34:39.400
accountability and democracy,
and an act of civil society,

00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:45.767
and a free press, and
freedom of assembly.

00:34:45.767 --> 00:34:48.567
And some countries
are not doing as well.

00:34:48.567 --> 00:34:52.166
But what's exciting right now is
you're starting to see more

00:34:52.166 --> 00:34:58.500
and more a norm, a standard,
take hold in Africa.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.700
And young people,
I think especially,

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.667
have high expectations about
how government should function,

00:35:04.667 --> 00:35:06.900
and it should function
for the public good,

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:11.600
not for the benefit
of just a few.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.367
And people should be
able to speak their mind,

00:35:13.367 --> 00:35:15.100
and they should be able to
organize without

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.934
fear of retribution.

00:35:17.934 --> 00:35:23.133
And they should be able to
cast a ballot without problem.

00:35:23.133 --> 00:35:26.467
And South Africa, I think,
has been a great model.

00:35:26.467 --> 00:35:28.767
This is one of the greatest
legacies of Nelson Mandela --

00:35:28.767 --> 00:35:35.200
is to show that through a
commitment to the constitution

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:42.934
and rule of law, and equal
treatment for all people,

00:35:42.934 --> 00:35:50.033
that a country can prosper
despite a tragic history.

00:35:50.033 --> 00:35:52.800
And the same should
be true in Kenya,

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:56.867
which is why I was heartened
that the process of the last

00:35:56.867 --> 00:36:02.567
election at least did
not result in chaos.

00:36:02.567 --> 00:36:04.100
And that should be
true for every country.

00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:06.967
And President Zuma said
something important today at the

00:36:06.967 --> 00:36:09.800
press conference, and I'm going
to see what we can do

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:10.967
to work with them.

00:36:10.967 --> 00:36:15.900
The African Union I think is
trying to create sort of a peer

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:21.100
review system so that it's not
just the United States coming in

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.133
and lecturing some African
country that's not observing

00:36:25.133 --> 00:36:28.000
democracy; it's fellow
Africans who are saying,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.166
what are you doing?

00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:33.900
Why are you suppressing
your people?

00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.934
Why are you throwing
political dissidents in jail?

00:36:37.934 --> 00:36:43.467
Why are you blocking people's
ability to organize new

00:36:43.467 --> 00:36:45.567
political parties?

00:36:45.567 --> 00:36:51.900
And when peers are
organizing in that fashion,

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:56.100
then slowly standards get raised
and new norms are established,

00:36:56.100 --> 00:36:59.166
and all of you can be at
the forefront of that.

00:36:59.166 --> 00:37:00.734
Thank you, Kenya.

00:37:00.734 --> 00:37:08.266
(applause)

00:37:08.266 --> 00:37:12.500
Ms. Mabuse: 
We are going to stay in East Africa and take a question from

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:14.133
Kampala, Uganda.

00:37:14.133 --> 00:37:16.834
The President: 
Fantastic.

00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.433
Uganda Moderator: 
Hello from Kampala in Uganda,

00:37:21.433 --> 00:37:23.633
"the pearl of Africa,"
as we are known.

00:37:23.633 --> 00:37:27.934
I am Nancy Kacungira, a news
presenter with NTV Uganda.

00:37:27.934 --> 00:37:31.300
And Uganda is a very youthful
nation -- more than half of our

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:34.533
population is actually
under the age of 15.

00:37:34.533 --> 00:37:37.567
I'm here today with a group
of vibrant and dynamic

00:37:37.567 --> 00:37:38.633
young people.

00:37:38.633 --> 00:37:43.667
And as you can see, they are
very excited to be addressing

00:37:43.667 --> 00:37:47.233
President Obama today and
asking him a question.

00:37:47.233 --> 00:37:49.767
Now, I've had the chance to
interact with the young people

00:37:49.767 --> 00:37:51.900
here today, and they're all
great young leaders

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:53.333
in their own right.

00:37:53.333 --> 00:37:55.133
And they all have different
backgrounds and different

00:37:55.133 --> 00:37:58.233
experiences, but I've found that
one of the things they do have

00:37:58.233 --> 00:38:00.934
in common is their passion --
their passion for a better

00:38:00.934 --> 00:38:03.600
Uganda and for a better Africa.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.834
Mr. President, one of them is
now going to ask you a question

00:38:06.834 --> 00:38:09.400
on behalf of the
rest of the group.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:11.867
Audience Member: 
Hello, Mr. President.

00:38:11.867 --> 00:38:13.333
It's an honor.

00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:14.667
My name is Eirene Ikomon (ph).

00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:18.133
My question comes on behalf of
everyone seated here with me.

00:38:18.133 --> 00:38:20.934
Unfortunately, it's
also regarding trade.

00:38:20.934 --> 00:38:23.033
Mr. President, as
young Ugandan leaders,

00:38:23.033 --> 00:38:25.834
we are looking to the world for
equal business partners

00:38:25.834 --> 00:38:28.900
and commitments, and
not necessarily aid.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.567
We are not looking for donors.

00:38:30.567 --> 00:38:33.133
And yet, Mr. President, the
policy you have just described

00:38:33.133 --> 00:38:37.000
right now seems to emphasize
help coming in from the U.S.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.600
but emphasizing offering jobs
and employment within the

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.333
countries that they come into.

00:38:42.333 --> 00:38:45.100
As young leaders, Mr. President,
we want to do the businesses at

00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:48.400
home and be the ones
to own our own markets.

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:51.467
So how do you, Mr. President,
plan on assisting us in

00:38:51.467 --> 00:38:55.066
reaffirming the U.S. policy to achieve this vision?

00:38:55.066 --> 00:39:00.734
(applause)

00:39:00.734 --> 00:39:03.400
The President:
Well, with respect to U.S. policy, I think you

00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.867
mischaracterize it, because our policy is to see success

00:39:07.867 --> 00:39:09.333
here in Africa.

00:39:09.333 --> 00:39:12.433
Now, there's no doubt that U.S. businesses also want to

00:39:12.433 --> 00:39:17.300
sell into Africa, because as President of the United States,

00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.433
I want to create some
jobs in Africa as well.

00:39:20.433 --> 00:39:25.200
But my attitude is that the more
successful African entrepreneurs

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:28.934
are, then the more they're going
to be purchasing and interested

00:39:28.934 --> 00:39:32.333
in purchasing U.S. goods.

00:39:32.333 --> 00:39:35.433
And, conversely, when the
economy in the United States is

00:39:35.433 --> 00:39:38.400
doing strong, then we're going
to buy more from Africa,

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.066
and everybody's standards
of living can rise.

00:39:41.066 --> 00:39:44.033
But as you heard me say earlier,
I completely agree with you that

00:39:44.033 --> 00:39:52.200
we want more investment and
value creation here in Africa.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.367
Now, one thing we
haven't spoken about,

00:39:54.367 --> 00:39:59.000
which I think is critical,
is intra-African trade.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.333
All too often, it's easier to
export, say, tea and coffee,

00:40:05.333 --> 00:40:11.400
from East Africa or flowers from
East Africa to Europe than

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:18.166
it is to export it someplace
else in Africa.

00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:22.934
And part of that is the
legacy of colonialism,

00:40:22.934 --> 00:40:28.533
an orientation out of Africa
rather than internal to Africa.

00:40:28.533 --> 00:40:32.900
Part of it is a lack of basic
infrastructure -- so port

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:39.233
facilities, trains, rail, roads.

00:40:39.233 --> 00:40:41.533
So one of the things that we're
going to be very interested in

00:40:41.533 --> 00:40:46.233
is working with the African
Union as well as various

00:40:46.233 --> 00:40:52.066
regional organizations to find
ways that we can start linking

00:40:52.066 --> 00:40:59.400
up markets inside of Africa,
because particularly for new

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:05.700
businesses -- if you're starting
a business here in South Africa,

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:10.734
then the best chance you have
initially for export might

00:41:10.734 --> 00:41:17.033
be closer to home, one of the
surrounding countries.

00:41:17.033 --> 00:41:19.900
If Uganda -- if you have a
business that you want to get

00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:27.200
started, and initially you've
gotten your product popular

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:30.900
inside of Uganda, the next step
before you think about selling

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:33.400
to the United States, you
might say to yourself,

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:36.000
let me start selling
some in Kenya,

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.800
or let me start selling
in Tanzania, or Rwanda.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.967
And so part of what we have to
do is to find additional ways in

00:41:44.967 --> 00:41:51.233
which Africans can also
trade with each other.

00:41:51.233 --> 00:41:56.600
The last point I will make --
because it's related to trade

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:02.834
and capacity-building -- I just
came, as I said, from Senegal.

00:42:02.834 --> 00:42:06.066
And one of the things that we
were featuring was our Feed the

00:42:06.066 --> 00:42:11.133
Future program and a Food
Security Alliance that we're

00:42:11.133 --> 00:42:12.800
creating here in Africa.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.100
And we've already gotten
nine countries to join,

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:18.200
and Senegal just determined that
it was going to join as well.

00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:24.333
But we've already helped 7
million small farmers in Africa

00:42:24.333 --> 00:42:30.400
to pool their resources,
access lower credit,

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:35.934
link themselves together as one
producer group so that they can

00:42:35.934 --> 00:42:39.433
market and sell
more effectively.

00:42:39.433 --> 00:42:45.867
And we've seen those farmers
increase their yields and their

00:42:45.867 --> 00:42:52.066
sales by 10, 20, 30, in some
cases, 50 or 100 percent.

00:42:52.066 --> 00:42:56.266
I met with a young woman farmer
who had started off with one

00:42:56.266 --> 00:43:01.066
hectare, now has 16.

00:43:01.066 --> 00:43:06.667
She has been able to achieve
enough growth that she has now

00:43:06.667 --> 00:43:08.200
bought a tractor.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:11.033
She's hired eight people.

00:43:11.033 --> 00:43:16.166
Now, that's not what we
ordinarily think of as business

00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:19.300
or entrepreneurship, but if
you think about the number of

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:25.100
Africans who are involved in
agriculture and giving them the

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.967
tools where suddenly they're
getting better prices for their

00:43:28.967 --> 00:43:33.166
crops, they've got
access to a marketplace,

00:43:33.166 --> 00:43:38.100
they now are getting enough
credit to be able to mechanize

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:41.533
their operations, and now
suddenly they're able to hire

00:43:41.533 --> 00:43:46.867
some people in their
surrounding villages,

00:43:46.867 --> 00:43:51.100
you've just suddenly seen
a small business grow.

00:43:51.100 --> 00:43:53.200
And the next step may be then
they start doing some

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:54.967
small food processing.

00:43:54.967 --> 00:43:58.667
And next thing you know, now
they're suddenly supplying these

00:43:58.667 --> 00:44:01.967
processed foods to a school.

00:44:01.967 --> 00:44:04.667
And next thing you know, they're
supplying those processed foods

00:44:04.667 --> 00:44:07.133
to the whole country.

00:44:07.133 --> 00:44:09.900
And so not every business
is going to be an Internet

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.000
business, an app --
(laughter) -- I mean,

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
I know that's what young people
are all about -- I'm just going

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.367
to create an app, I'm
the next Facebook.

00:44:19.367 --> 00:44:21.967
That's great, and I hope
some of you do that,

00:44:21.967 --> 00:44:25.066
but when we think of development
of Africa as a whole,

00:44:25.066 --> 00:44:27.900
especially if we're thinking
about broad-based development,

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.200
then part of what we have to
recognize is that a huge number

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:33.934
of people inside of Africa
are still in the agricultural

00:44:33.934 --> 00:44:37.066
sector, and the work that we're
doing is trying to create

00:44:37.066 --> 00:44:41.600
capacity for those small farmers
who are essentially small

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.467
entrepreneurs to be successful
-- because if they've got more

00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:50.900
money in their pockets, now they
can afford to buy your app.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:54.333
So thank you very much
for the question, Uganda.

00:44:54.333 --> 00:44:55.734
Appreciate it.

00:44:55.734 --> 00:45:00.133
(applause)

00:45:00.133 --> 00:45:01.133
Ms. Mabuse:
Mr. President,

00:45:01.133 --> 00:45:02.967
we're moving over
to West Africa now,

00:45:02.967 --> 00:45:07.467
and we're going to take a
question from Lagos, Nigeria.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.934
Nigeria Moderator:
Well, welcome, Mr. President, to Lagos, Nigeria, home

00:45:17.934 --> 00:45:22.066
to perhaps Africa's biggest youth population.

00:45:22.066 --> 00:45:25.533
I'm Maupe Ogun for
Channels Television here.

00:45:25.533 --> 00:45:29.667
And here with me in the studio
are a selection of some of

00:45:29.667 --> 00:45:32.934
Nigeria's brightest and
best, and I must tell you,

00:45:32.934 --> 00:45:34.500
Mr. President,
they're mostly women,

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.433
so you better be
careful around them.

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:37.600
(laughter)

00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:39.767
And they say they're
on the march and they have

00:45:39.767 --> 00:45:41.300
their question ready.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.700
Over now to Aisha (ph).

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.500
Audience Member: 
Good afternoon, Mr. President.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:48.767
My name is Aisha Myna (ph), and
I represent seven

00:45:48.767 --> 00:45:50.367
other people here.

00:45:50.367 --> 00:45:55.100
In acknowledging our challenges
and our responsibility as the

00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:58.400
young leaders of Nigeria to
accept our challenges and make

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:01.433
the difference, we would like to
thank you for your support

00:46:01.433 --> 00:46:04.767
to Nigeria and Africa as a whole.

00:46:04.767 --> 00:46:08.100
The largest resource in
Nigeria is our human capital,

00:46:08.100 --> 00:46:12.233
and we would like to ask
a two-pronged question.

00:46:12.233 --> 00:46:16.567
The first is, how can the United
States deepen its investment in

00:46:16.567 --> 00:46:21.467
deploying technology that will
develop our vast human capital

00:46:21.467 --> 00:46:24.600
as well as the
education of her youth?

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.400
My second question --
it's two-pronged, sorry,

00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:32.200
Mr. President -- considering how
long the war on terror has been

00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:36.800
on for, would you say that we're
winning the war on terror,

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:41.000
seeing that there are new
terrorist groups developing

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.300
in Africa, one of
which is in Nigeria?

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.033
Thank you.

00:46:46.033 --> 00:46:47.166
The President: 
Well, those are both great questions.

00:46:47.166 --> 00:46:47.934
Thank you.

00:46:47.934 --> 00:46:51.800
(applause)

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.333
And before
I answer the question,

00:46:54.333 --> 00:46:58.900
I just want to be clear: I am
surrounded by opinionated women

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:03.467
in my house all day long --
(laughter) -- so I've got good

00:47:03.467 --> 00:47:09.266
practice dealing
with strong women.

00:47:09.266 --> 00:47:12.333
You guys haven't met Michelle,
but you've probably seen

00:47:12.333 --> 00:47:13.100
her on TV.

00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:14.133
She's not shy.

00:47:14.133 --> 00:47:15.633
(laughter)

00:47:15.633 --> 00:47:17.633
And Malia and Sasha,
they're just taking right

00:47:17.633 --> 00:47:20.233
up after her.

00:47:20.233 --> 00:47:26.700
So every night at
dinner I'm surrounded.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:30.200
In terms of human
capital and young people,

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:33.233
I think there is no doubt that
the most important investment

00:47:33.233 --> 00:47:36.333
any country can make -- not
just an African country -- any

00:47:36.333 --> 00:47:40.867
country can make is educating
its youth and providing them the

00:47:40.867 --> 00:47:45.967
skills they need to compete in
a highly technological advanced

00:47:45.967 --> 00:47:49.233
world economy -- countries that
do not do that well

00:47:49.233 --> 00:47:52.133
will not succeed.

00:47:52.133 --> 00:47:56.100
Countries that excel at training
their young people are going to

00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.600
succeed, because these days
businesses can go anywhere.

00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:05.300
And one of the key criteria
for any business is,

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:08.200
where can I find
outstanding workers?

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:13.767
Where can I find outstanding
people to manage a plant or

00:48:13.767 --> 00:48:16.333
manage my sales force?

00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:24.133
And if you have countries with
high illiteracy rates or limited

00:48:24.133 --> 00:48:26.266
skills, you're going
to have problems.

00:48:26.266 --> 00:48:30.100
And I want to be clear that
this is a problem in the United

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.100
States, not just a
problem in Africa.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:35.233
One of the main things that I'm
spending a lot of time on

00:48:35.233 --> 00:48:41.300
is trying to push Congress to
improve our early childhood

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:46.367
education, because it turns
out that children are most

00:48:46.367 --> 00:48:49.834
susceptible to learning between
the ages of zero and three.

00:48:49.834 --> 00:48:55.066
And so working with parents,
particularly mothers,

00:48:55.066 --> 00:48:59.633
around reading to their
children, proper nutrition,

00:48:59.633 --> 00:49:02.667
stimulating activities.

00:49:02.667 --> 00:49:05.200
Then, when they get to school,
making sure that our schools are

00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:09.400
prepared and redesigned for
today -- because a lot of the

00:49:09.400 --> 00:49:13.333
schools in the United States
were first created during the

00:49:13.333 --> 00:49:18.033
agricultural era and aren't
always appropriate for

00:49:18.033 --> 00:49:20.266
what's required today.

00:49:20.266 --> 00:49:23.800
And then on into what we
call community colleges,

00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.934
which are two-year colleges
or four-year colleges

00:49:26.934 --> 00:49:29.333
and universities.

00:49:29.333 --> 00:49:33.000
Somebody should have told my
helicopter to quiet down while

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:33.967
I'm talking.

00:49:33.967 --> 00:49:37.633
(laughter)

00:49:37.633 --> 00:49:40.000
So across the
board, we're having to rethink

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.700
education and
workforce training.

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.967
And one of the things that we
want to do is to partner with

00:49:45.967 --> 00:49:51.767
a country like Nigeria and
identify ways that we can

00:49:51.767 --> 00:49:55.600
provide direct value added --
whether it's in helping to train

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.967
teachers, helping to incorporate
technologies into

00:49:59.967 --> 00:50:03.367
the education process.

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:07.467
So, for example, one of the
things that you hear across the

00:50:07.467 --> 00:50:12.700
continent is, because a lot of
Africans still live in rural

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:18.266
areas, it may be difficult for
them to access education

00:50:18.266 --> 00:50:22.433
and schooling once they get
beyond a certain level.

00:50:22.433 --> 00:50:25.100
Well, are there ways in which
we can pipe in, essentially,

00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:28.667
a university into
a rural community?

00:50:28.667 --> 00:50:33.800
And suddenly, you've got
the lecturer right there,

00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:37.033
without the same costs or
obligation for a young person

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:44.500
to take on when they go to travel far away from home

00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.500
in order to study.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:49.000
And so I think that there are
some excellent ideas that

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.767
sometimes we're doing
country by country,

00:50:51.767 --> 00:50:53.867
depending on the country.

00:50:53.867 --> 00:50:57.000
But this is an area where I
would love to get more input

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.233
from young people in terms of
what they think would work.

00:51:01.233 --> 00:51:05.633
And so part of the Young African
Leaders Initiative may be

00:51:05.633 --> 00:51:11.033
to elicit additional ideas from
those -- particularly those who

00:51:11.033 --> 00:51:14.000
may be working in education and
have a sense of what are the

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:19.834
barriers right now for young
people in order to succeed.

00:51:19.834 --> 00:51:29.967
Now, with respect to the
so-called war on terror,

00:51:29.967 --> 00:51:34.700
there's no doubt that we've made
some progress in dealing with

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:37.467
some extremist groups
-- for example,

00:51:37.467 --> 00:51:42.900
core al Qaeda and bin Laden,
that was based in the FATA area

00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:46.066
between Pakistan and Afghanistan
-- that they have

00:51:46.066 --> 00:51:52.433
been greatly diminished.

00:51:52.433 --> 00:51:55.500
But what is also true
is that in some ways,

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.867
the problem has metastasized.

00:51:57.867 --> 00:52:01.166
You have more regional
terrorist organizations,

00:52:01.166 --> 00:52:07.233
like a Boko Haram in Nigeria,
espousing an extremist ideology,

00:52:07.233 --> 00:52:13.066
showing no regard
for human life.

00:52:13.066 --> 00:52:16.934
And although they may not have
the same transnational capacity

00:52:16.934 --> 00:52:20.000
that some of the earlier
organizations did,

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.433
they're doing great harm in
Africa and in the Middle East

00:52:24.433 --> 00:52:26.600
and in South Asia.

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:31.433
People always talk about the
terrorist threat to the United

00:52:31.433 --> 00:52:34.500
States or the West, but the
truth of the matter is,

00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.667
is that the number of people who
are killed by terrorist attacks

00:52:37.667 --> 00:52:40.300
in African countries,
or in Muslim countries,

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:45.734
or in South Asia, far outstrips
any deaths that are experienced

00:52:45.734 --> 00:52:48.767
by westerners.

00:52:48.767 --> 00:52:51.967
It's typically people right
there where these organizations

00:52:51.967 --> 00:52:55.266
are based that are most
likely to be killed.

00:52:55.266 --> 00:52:58.133
When the Kenya Embassy
bombing happened,

00:52:58.133 --> 00:53:01.033
the overwhelming majority of
people who were killed were

00:53:01.033 --> 00:53:06.266
Kenyans, not Americans.

00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:08.066
And so this is not
just a problem for us.

00:53:08.066 --> 00:53:11.000
This is a problem for everybody.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:20.734
Now, the question is, how
do we address this problem?

00:53:20.734 --> 00:53:27.133
It is my strong belief that
terrorism is more likely to

00:53:27.133 --> 00:53:32.900
emerge and take root where
countries are not delivering for

00:53:32.900 --> 00:53:40.867
their people and where there
are sources of conflict and

00:53:40.867 --> 00:53:44.567
underlying frustrations that
have not been

00:53:44.567 --> 00:53:46.266
adequately dealt with.

00:53:46.266 --> 00:53:48.100
The danger we have
right now, for example,

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:52.100
in a place like Somalia is that
it's been two generations,

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:55.667
maybe three since there was a
functioning government

00:53:55.667 --> 00:53:58.400
inside of Somalia.

00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:02.800
Now, we've started to see
actually some progress,

00:54:02.800 --> 00:54:08.166
in part because of intervention
by African nations in Somalia

00:54:08.166 --> 00:54:13.066
to clear the space, to create
the space for governance.

00:54:13.066 --> 00:54:16.533
But you look at what's happening
in Mali, for example, right now.

00:54:16.533 --> 00:54:19.734
Part of the problem is, is
that you had a weak central

00:54:19.734 --> 00:54:24.166
government and democratic
institutions that weren't

00:54:24.166 --> 00:54:31.300
reaching out as far into the
country as were necessary,

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.100
and we've got to build
those institutions.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.433
A lot of what we talked about
in terms of responsiveness and

00:54:35.433 --> 00:54:41.233
governance and democracy, those
things become defense

00:54:41.233 --> 00:54:45.133
mechanisms against terrorism.

00:54:45.133 --> 00:54:47.834
They're the most important
defense against terrorism.

00:54:47.834 --> 00:54:54.367
So I don't start with the
attitude of a military solution

00:54:54.367 --> 00:54:55.934
to these problems.

00:54:55.934 --> 00:54:57.934
I think the more that we're
giving people opportunity,

00:54:57.934 --> 00:55:00.433
the more that we're
giving people education,

00:55:00.433 --> 00:55:03.300
the more that we're helping
resolve conflicts through

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:07.333
regular democratic processes,
the less likely they are

00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:09.700
to take root.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:13.567
Now, having said that, there are
some extremist groups that will

00:55:13.567 --> 00:55:18.800
not compromise or work
through a democratic process,

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.533
and we have to also be
realistic about that.

00:55:21.533 --> 00:55:26.600
And what we want to do is
partner with African countries

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:28.033
to figure out how we can help.

00:55:28.033 --> 00:55:35.500
But I promise, this notion
somehow that we want to somehow

00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:42.300
expand our military reach --
I was elected to end a war.

00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:43.834
I've ended one.

00:55:43.834 --> 00:55:47.800
I'm now in the process
of ending another one.

00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:56.567
Every few weeks, I go and visit
soldiers who are your age,

00:55:56.567 --> 00:56:05.133
who have had their legs blown
off in Afghanistan, or worse.

00:56:05.133 --> 00:56:10.967
Every week, I'm writing letters
to the families

00:56:10.967 --> 00:56:15.633
of fallen soldiers.

00:56:15.633 --> 00:56:19.834
Sometimes I go to Arlington
National Cemetery,

00:56:19.834 --> 00:56:26.633
where our heroes are buried, and
I hug those families and I feel

00:56:26.633 --> 00:56:29.333
their sobs on my shoulder.

00:56:29.333 --> 00:56:36.767
This idea somehow that we want
to get more involved militarily

00:56:36.767 --> 00:56:39.200
around the world
is simply not true.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:45.000
First of all, it costs a lot of
money, and the United States,

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.367
just like every country
around the world,

00:56:46.367 --> 00:56:51.367
has to think about its budget.

00:56:51.367 --> 00:56:55.400
And where we intervene
oftentimes it's not very

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:59.667
effective because unless you've
got a local population that is

00:56:59.667 --> 00:57:04.066
standing up against terrorism,
we end up being viewed as

00:57:04.066 --> 00:57:06.567
interlopers and intruders.

00:57:06.567 --> 00:57:08.834
So with -- in the
Africa context,

00:57:08.834 --> 00:57:13.967
what we want to do is to
build African capacity.

00:57:13.967 --> 00:57:18.433
We want the African Union and
other regional organizations

00:57:18.433 --> 00:57:21.867
to build up the capacity
to send in peacekeepers,

00:57:21.867 --> 00:57:28.333
to be able to nip terrorist
cells that may be forming before

00:57:28.333 --> 00:57:31.700
they start and gain strength.

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:35.500
And we can provide advice and
training and in some cases

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:41.667
equipment, but we would love
nothing more than for Africa,

00:57:41.667 --> 00:57:46.633
collectively, to say no to
extremism, say no to terrorism,

00:57:46.633 --> 00:57:51.400
to say no to sectarianism --
which in the case of Boko Haram,

00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:55.367
for example, is an example
of essentially a religious

00:57:55.367 --> 00:58:00.767
rationale for this kind of
violence -- and the United

00:58:00.767 --> 00:58:04.533
States to be able to step back
and worry about selling

00:58:04.533 --> 00:58:06.367
iPads and planes.

00:58:06.367 --> 00:58:08.500
That's what we would like to do.

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:15.133
But what we won't do is just
stand by if our embassy is being

00:58:15.133 --> 00:58:22.100
attacked or our people are
in vulnerable situations.

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:27.233
And we expect countries to work
with us to try to deal with some

00:58:27.233 --> 00:58:29.033
of these threats.

00:58:29.033 --> 00:58:33.166
And this is a global issue; it's
not just one related

00:58:33.166 --> 00:58:35.066
to the United States.

00:58:35.066 --> 00:58:36.867
Okay.

00:58:36.867 --> 00:58:38.033
All right.

00:58:38.033 --> 00:58:45.834
(applause)

00:58:45.834 --> 00:58:51.500
Ms. Mabuse: 
We have time to take one last question from Soweto.

00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:53.333
The President:
If it's a really short question, I'll give a short answer

00:58:53.333 --> 00:58:54.900
and we'll get two in.

00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:59.934
(laughter)

00:58:59.934 --> 00:59:04.333
Gentleman right here, yes, go ahead.

00:59:04.333 --> 00:59:08.000
Everybody has got -- you've
got to describe why you're

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.266
all wearing orange.

00:59:09.266 --> 00:59:10.600
(laughter)

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:10.934
Audience Member: 
Okay.

00:59:10.934 --> 00:59:12.500
Firstly, my name is
Han Dinkelman (ph).

00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:15.100
I'm nervous.

00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:17.600
(laughter and applause)

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.533
I'm a student at UJ.

00:59:19.533 --> 00:59:22.166
I'm an honor student;
also studied education.

00:59:22.166 --> 00:59:24.367
You said education
people should stand up.

00:59:24.367 --> 00:59:25.433
(laughter)

00:59:25.433 --> 00:59:30.667
My education is -- oh, my question is we've got a lot

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:33.300
of barriers in this country, and one of those barriers is the

00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:38.400
amount of students in our classes versus a single person.

00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:42.233
And what I find difficult is,
how does that one person stand

00:59:42.233 --> 00:59:45.233
up and control, in some cases
-- we've just come back from

00:59:45.233 --> 00:59:49.700
training -- some cases 90
to 100 kids in one class?

00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:53.200
It's difficult enough
to carry 40 in my class.

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:56.300
How do you carry those 90 -- I
find it very difficult --

00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.467
and try to make an impact
in their lives?

00:59:58.467 --> 00:59:59.133
The President: 
Good.

00:59:59.133 --> 01:00:00.300
I think that's a great question.

01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.700
First of all, I think it's
wonderful that you're

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:04.834
going into education.

01:00:04.834 --> 01:00:06.000
Very proud of you.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.734
(applause)

01:00:10.734 --> 01:00:17.834
No job more important
than educating our young people.

01:00:17.834 --> 01:00:20.867
This is a challenge that we have
in the United States as well,

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:23.834
and that is the
issue of class size.

01:00:23.834 --> 01:00:27.633
Now, our problem typically is
that our class sizes are around

01:00:27.633 --> 01:00:34.100
35 or 33, and we'd like to see
if we can get it down

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.333
in the twenties.

01:00:36.333 --> 01:00:39.667
If you're talking about 90 --
(laughter) -- that's a whole

01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:40.800
other level.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.200
Now, we're -- I'm assuming
we're talking about primary and

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.734
secondary education, we're not
talking about universities,

01:00:45.734 --> 01:00:49.133
because by the time you get to
university it's -- you better be

01:00:49.133 --> 01:00:50.567
focused on your studies.

01:00:50.567 --> 01:00:54.767
It's not the job of the teacher
to make you do your work and pay

01:00:54.767 --> 01:00:57.000
attention, because
you're now an adult.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
But when it comes
to young people,

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.433
studies do show that
particularly for poorer

01:01:03.433 --> 01:01:08.500
children, the more one-on-one
attention that they can get from

01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.867
their teachers, the more
personalized instruction they

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:14.800
can get, the better
they're going to do.

01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:21.533
So the first response is, if you
can budget -- if a government

01:01:21.533 --> 01:01:26.266
can budget smaller class
sizes, that's better.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:28.734
But not every country is going
to have the resources

01:01:28.734 --> 01:01:30.133
to do that.

01:01:30.133 --> 01:01:34.166
And one of the things that we're
starting to see in the United

01:01:34.166 --> 01:01:39.567
States is, how can you
effectively use, for example,

01:01:39.567 --> 01:01:43.033
teacher's assistants in a class,
who may not be fully certified

01:01:43.033 --> 01:01:47.567
teachers but can
break up, let's say,

01:01:47.567 --> 01:01:50.400
a class of 90 into
smaller groups.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.800
This is also where technology
can also potentially make

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:57.500
a difference, because it's
conceivable that if you've got

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:02.667
some sort of technology -- a
couple of laptops -- that you

01:02:02.667 --> 01:02:08.900
can leverage one teacher
into multiple instruction.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.900
The question you raise, though,
makes me want to suggest to my

01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:17.600
team when we leave here that we
start taking some of the best

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.633
practices and some of the things
that we're learning in the

01:02:19.633 --> 01:02:23.066
United States and seeing if
there may be some application we

01:02:23.066 --> 01:02:26.400
can -- might be able to start
some pilot programs here in

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.934
South Africa to see if we
can make an impact there.

01:02:29.934 --> 01:02:30.967
(applause)

01:02:30.967 --> 01:02:31.734
Good.

01:02:31.734 --> 01:02:32.533
All right.

01:02:32.533 --> 01:02:33.200
Last question?

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:34.767
One more.

01:02:34.767 --> 01:02:35.700
All right.

01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.467
All these folks have been
so patient in the back,

01:02:38.467 --> 01:02:40.533
I don't want them
to feel neglected.

01:02:40.533 --> 01:02:46.266
So the -- this
gentleman right here,

01:02:46.266 --> 01:02:47.300
because he seems very eager.

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:47.834
Right here.

01:02:47.834 --> 01:02:49.834
Yes, yes, you right there.

01:02:49.834 --> 01:02:52.700
(laughter)

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.433
Go ahead.

01:02:53.433 --> 01:02:57.100
The -- but you guys can -- feel
free to stand together if you

01:02:57.100 --> 01:02:59.233
want, but -- (laughter) -- I'm
only going to take a question

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:00.166
from one of you.

01:03:00.166 --> 01:03:00.800
(laughter)

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:01.533
What's your name?

01:03:01.533 --> 01:03:04.100
Audience Member: 
My name is Sydney Mukumu (ph).

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.066
I'm from Limpopo.

01:03:05.066 --> 01:03:08.567
(applause)

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:09.066
Thank you.

01:03:09.066 --> 01:03:11.500
President Obama,
I met you in 2006.

01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:14.333
I was working for the embassy.

01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:14.934
The President: 
Excellent.

01:03:14.934 --> 01:03:15.800
Audience Member: 
Yes.

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:23.233
I'm very much worried about some
of United States international

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:28.767
-- I mean foreign policy,
especially on the environment.

01:03:28.767 --> 01:03:34.133
President Obama, today I want
you to tell these young leaders

01:03:34.133 --> 01:03:38.033
about the foreign policy
of the United States

01:03:38.033 --> 01:03:39.834
on the environment.

01:03:39.834 --> 01:03:40.400
The President: 
On the environment?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:44.100
Audience Member: 
Yes, because South Africa
is facing the same problem.

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:49.400
Whatever is happening in
America, it's affecting us.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:52.066
Please tell these -- this is
your children -- tell us today

01:03:52.066 --> 01:03:53.233
-- (laughter) --

01:03:53.233 --> 01:03:53.867
The President: 
Yes.

01:03:53.867 --> 01:03:56.467
Audience Member: 
-- just like people who
are protesting outside,

01:03:56.467 --> 01:04:00.200
there are people who are crying, and now you must address

01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.033
them here --

01:04:01.033 --> 01:04:01.800
The President:
Okay, let's go.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.266
Audience Member: 
-- and tell them
outside what is happening.

01:04:04.266 --> 01:04:06.600
Make it clear, and then when you
go back you will have

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.300
a safe trip.

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:08.400
Thank you very much, President.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.166
(applause)

01:04:09.166 --> 01:04:09.500
The President: 
I'm ready.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.467
I'm ready.

01:04:10.467 --> 01:04:11.166
I'm ready.

01:04:11.166 --> 01:04:13.033
I'm ready.

01:04:13.033 --> 01:04:18.333
(laughter)

01:04:18.333 --> 01:04:25.567
I'll see if
I can make it clear.

01:04:25.567 --> 01:04:34.266
U.S. environmental policy is something that I

01:04:34.266 --> 01:04:35.467
care deeply about.

01:04:35.467 --> 01:04:36.834
As some of you know,
I grew up in Hawaii,

01:04:36.834 --> 01:04:38.734
one of the most beautiful
places on Earth.

01:04:38.734 --> 01:04:44.967
And as a child, I was just
taught to treasure what the

01:04:44.967 --> 01:04:48.367
Earth gives us and to make sure
that we leave it for

01:04:48.367 --> 01:04:50.266
the next generation.

01:04:50.266 --> 01:04:53.734
And obviously in a
country like South Africa,

01:04:53.734 --> 01:04:58.500
with incredible beauty
and natural resources,

01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:03.200
that same mentality about
conserving the Earth and

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.867
nurturing it to pass on to
future generations, I think,

01:05:06.867 --> 01:05:12.000
applies here just as much as
it does in the United States.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:15.467
The biggest challenge we have
environmentally -- and it is an

01:05:15.467 --> 01:05:19.633
international challenge that we
cannot solve alone --

01:05:19.633 --> 01:05:21.967
is the issue of climate change.

01:05:21.967 --> 01:05:27.734
There are other issues:
dirty water, dirty air.

01:05:27.734 --> 01:05:32.300
But the truth is, is that we've
made enormous progress over the

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:35.133
last several years, over the
last several decades

01:05:35.133 --> 01:05:36.567
in the United States.

01:05:36.567 --> 01:05:38.834
And if you come to
the United States,

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:41.367
environmental quality
is pretty good.

01:05:41.367 --> 01:05:48.367
And internationally, we've
promoted policies around how

01:05:48.367 --> 01:05:53.467
mercury is released
into the environment,

01:05:53.467 --> 01:05:56.600
and how other poisons are
released in the environment,

01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:59.767
and how businesses have to be
held to international standards

01:05:59.767 --> 01:06:02.800
in terms of worker safety.

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.000
Those are areas where the
United States have been

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:05.967
at the forefront.

01:06:05.967 --> 01:06:07.700
We've been at the
front of the line,

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:10.333
not the back of the line when
it comes to those issues.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:16.233
But the existential challenge
that we face has to do with

01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:18.467
a warming planet.

01:06:18.467 --> 01:06:20.700
And your generation is the one
that's going to be

01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:24.000
the most severely affected.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Now, the United States and
other highly industrialized,

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:33.800
developed countries
over the last 50,

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.834
100 years have been pumping
up carbon emissions

01:06:37.834 --> 01:06:40.000
into the atmosphere.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:44.133
And slowly, this has been
building up and it is warming

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:49.900
the planet, and we may be
reaching a tipping point

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:55.533
in which if we do not
solve this problem soon,

01:06:55.533 --> 01:06:58.033
it will spin out of control and
change weather patterns in ways

01:06:58.033 --> 01:07:01.934
that we can't anticipate,
with drought, floods,

01:07:01.934 --> 01:07:06.834
much more severe
natural disasters.

01:07:06.834 --> 01:07:09.400
And unfortunately, in those
situations it's often poorer

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:13.600
countries that are affected the
most by these changing

01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:16.100
climate patterns.

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:21.066
So I just gave a speech this
past week on what the United

01:07:21.066 --> 01:07:23.967
States is going to do on our
next phase of reducing

01:07:23.967 --> 01:07:25.266
our carbon emissions.

01:07:25.266 --> 01:07:27.200
The United States actually
reduced our carbon emissions

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:33.367
more than any other country
since I came into office.

01:07:33.367 --> 01:07:34.233
I just want to make that point.

01:07:34.233 --> 01:07:37.467
(applause)

01:07:37.467 --> 01:07:39.200
We doubled
fuel-efficiency

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:40.433
standards on cars.

01:07:40.433 --> 01:07:44.400
We're investing in clean
energy like solar and wind.

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:47.667
And we actually want to
share that technology,

01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:51.567
because we think that all
countries need to benefit.

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:54.600
And part of the opportunity
for Africa is to see if we can

01:07:54.600 --> 01:08:03.033
leapfrog some of the polluting
practices of America or Europe,

01:08:03.033 --> 01:08:07.467
and go straight to the clean
energy strategies that will

01:08:07.467 --> 01:08:13.033
allow you to advance
economic growth,

01:08:13.033 --> 01:08:16.066
but not corrupt the planet.

01:08:16.066 --> 01:08:20.367
So we've made progress,
but we haven't done enough.

01:08:20.367 --> 01:08:23.967
And what I did was to say I
challenge the United States.

01:08:23.967 --> 01:08:26.166
I said we've got to do more.

01:08:26.166 --> 01:08:27.934
We're going to start regulating
our power plants

01:08:27.934 --> 01:08:29.667
more efficiently.

01:08:29.667 --> 01:08:33.967
We're going to make sure that we
redouble our efforts to reduce

01:08:33.967 --> 01:08:37.567
our carbon emissions, and we're
setting a goal to meet the

01:08:37.567 --> 01:08:42.100
agreements that we had both in
Copenhagen and in Durban for

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:46.633
advanced countries that
have a big carbon footprint.

01:08:46.633 --> 01:08:50.433
But let me make one last point:
The United States cannot

01:08:50.433 --> 01:08:53.934
do it by itself.

01:08:53.934 --> 01:09:01.233
And the biggest emitter of
carbon right now is China.

01:09:01.233 --> 01:09:05.767
They still have a much lower
carbon footprint per person than

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:11.033
the United States, but because
they have so many people,

01:09:11.033 --> 01:09:12.800
it's going up rapidly.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.467
And Chinese leaders
understand this.

01:09:16.467 --> 01:09:18.166
The same thing that's sending
all the carbon into the

01:09:18.166 --> 01:09:23.333
atmosphere is also making it
difficult to breathe in Beijing.

01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:24.900
So they recognize they've got to
come up with

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:26.834
a new development model.

01:09:26.834 --> 01:09:29.233
India is going to have to come
up with new development

01:09:29.233 --> 01:09:32.066
models -- Africa.

01:09:32.066 --> 01:09:37.834
We're going to all have to work
together to find ways in which

01:09:37.834 --> 01:09:43.200
collectively, we reduce carbon
but we make sure that there's

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.934
some differentiation so that
countries that are very wealthy

01:09:48.934 --> 01:09:53.867
are expected to do more, and
countries that are still

01:09:53.867 --> 01:09:58.533
developing, obviously they
shouldn't be resigned to poverty

01:09:58.533 --> 01:10:04.266
simply because the West and
Europe and America

01:10:04.266 --> 01:10:06.633
got there first.

01:10:06.633 --> 01:10:07.567
That wouldn't be fair.

01:10:07.567 --> 01:10:11.066
But everybody is going
to have to do something.

01:10:11.066 --> 01:10:12.600
Everybody is going to have to
make some

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:15.166
important choices here.

01:10:15.166 --> 01:10:18.567
And I expect that it's going to
be your generation that helps

01:10:18.567 --> 01:10:21.500
lead this, because if we don't,
it's going to be your generation

01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:25.033
that suffers the most.

01:10:25.033 --> 01:10:27.700
Ultimately, if you think about
all the youth that everybody has

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:30.967
mentioned here in Africa, if
everybody is raising living

01:10:30.967 --> 01:10:33.367
standards to the point where
everybody has got a car

01:10:33.367 --> 01:10:35.166
and everybody has got
air conditioning,

01:10:35.166 --> 01:10:38.467
and everybody has got
a big house, well,

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:42.133
the planet will boil over --
unless we find new ways of

01:10:42.133 --> 01:10:43.300
producing energy.

01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:47.834
And tomorrow, or the next
day, when I visit Tanzania,

01:10:47.834 --> 01:10:50.300
I'm actually going to be going
to a power plant to focus on the

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.734
need for electrification,
but the need to do it

01:10:52.734 --> 01:10:56.533
in an environmentally sound way.

01:10:56.533 --> 01:10:59.500
So let me just close by saying
this has been

01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:03.800
an unbelievable conversation.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:06.233
I had a lot of faith in all
of you before I came here;

01:11:06.233 --> 01:11:09.166
now I have even
more faith in you.

01:11:09.166 --> 01:11:10.834
You guys are all going
to do great things.

01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:15.967
I'll be retired by
the time you do them,

01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:18.600
and so I'll just sit back and
watch -- (laughter) -- and I'll

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.200
be proud of you.

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.767
But what I promise you is that
the United States government and

01:11:24.767 --> 01:11:29.600
the American people are going to
want to be your partner for the

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.066
duration of your careers.

01:11:31.066 --> 01:11:33.734
And I hope all of you, again,
apply for

01:11:33.734 --> 01:11:38.133
the Young African Leaders Initiative.

01:11:38.133 --> 01:11:43.000
We want to hear from you about
how we can work even more

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.066
effectively with
this great continent,

01:11:45.066 --> 01:11:48.300
because we see a
bright future ahead.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.467
I hope you've enjoyed it.

01:11:49.467 --> 01:11:50.066
Thank you, everybody.

01:11:50.066 --> 01:11:51.967
God bless you.

01:11:51.967 --> 01:11:53.066
Thank you.

01:11:53.066 --> 01:11:56.300
(applause)
