00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.200
- Did I do anything fun
while I was on vacation?

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.070
Actually I did.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.053
So I went back home to South Africa.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.160
Went to check up on...

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.993
Yeah it was just fun.

00:00:07.993 --> 00:00:10.453
I went to check on my
like, the foundation,

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.563
went to catch up with my people,

00:00:14.563 --> 00:00:16.810
and it's funny, 'cause
every time I go home

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.820
people always shout at
me about going home,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:19.870
which is a weird thing.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.240
So like, I'll get home
and then at the border,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.580
like literally at customs,
the woman was like,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.903
she's like, Trevor, when
are you coming home?

00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:28.380
(audience laughs)

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.850
And I was like, I'm home.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.001
She's like, no, but when
are you coming home?

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:33.180
(audience laughs)

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.280
And I was like, but I'm here right now.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.380
You're holding my passport.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.563
She's like, no that doesn't count, Trevor.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.633
That doesn't count, Trevor.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:41.810
We miss you.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.520
Then I'm like, but it's
not like you saw me,

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.353
like it's not like I was just

00:00:44.353 --> 00:00:45.650
running around in the streets everyday.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.080
It's like, no Trevor, come home.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.140
I'm like, I'm home!

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.540
(audience laughs)

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.580
But then what was crazy and amazing,

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.150
was so I was in Cape Town.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.020
And then a friend of
mine called me and said,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.980
yo Trevor, what are you doing?

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.620
And I said I'm waiting,

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.970
I'm gonna go to an event later today.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:04.620
And he's like, oh, 'cause the
President wants to meet you.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.120
So I was like the president of what?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.420
(audience laughs)

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.720
No because I just didn't
assume that the President,

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.970
like I was like, could be like

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.140
the president of this company,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.680
the president of like,
the Students Association,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.700
I don't know.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:16.870
So I'm like, which president?

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.110
And he's like the
President of the country.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.422
And I was like, what did I do?

00:01:21.422 --> 00:01:23.220
(audience laughs)

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.750
He's like no, he just wants to like,

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.137
he wants you to come and say hi.

00:01:26.137 --> 00:01:28.021
So he wants you to come to like,

00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:31.390
to the Presidential, you know,
the Presidential homestead

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.690
in Cape Town, just come and say hi.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.500
I was like, okay.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.791
And so then I was with my friends.

00:01:36.791 --> 00:01:39.760
And I was like, guys we
gotta go do this thing.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.770
And my friends are like,
alright let's roll.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.603
And then they rolled with me.

00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:42.436
But I didn't tell 'em what it was.

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:43.350
And I didn't realize in the moment

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.570
that I didn't tell 'em what it was.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.770
So like my friend's like wearing a hoodie,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.427
my other friend's wearing
like a free T-shirt.

00:01:47.427 --> 00:01:48.875
(audience laughs)

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:52.270
And I'm wearing a suit 'cause
I'm going to another event.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.070
And then we get there,
and then they're like,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.000
are we here to pickup...

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.366
And then I say to the
person at the counter,

00:01:56.366 --> 00:01:57.799
I'm like, oh we're here
to see the President.

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.334
And then my friend's like,
dude I'm wearing a hoodie!

00:02:00.334 --> 00:02:03.804
(audience laughs)

00:02:03.804 --> 00:02:05.440
And I was like, oh I'm sorry.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.593
I'm sorry, I forgot to tell
you where we were going.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.870
And so then we went in.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:13.960
And then we met the President
and he was just very cool.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.793
It was just like, you know...

00:02:14.793 --> 00:02:16.290
And then my friend was
like, he apologized.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.980
He was like, I'm so sorry Mr. President.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.500
I did not know I was
meeting a President today.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.520
That's why I'm dressed like this.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.360
And then the President was cool.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.950
He's like, no, I didn't
know I was meeting you guys.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.055
That's why I'm dressed like this.

00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:27.060
(audience laughs)

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.893
And it was cool.

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:29.900
He was nice about it.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.580
And then just out of nowhere
the President was like,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.040
Trevor, he's like, what are you doing now?

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.310
He's like come with me to Parliament.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.143
I wanna introduce you.

00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:38.330
So he like takes me, you
know, to our Congress,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:39.163
like to Parliament.

00:02:39.163 --> 00:02:40.335
And he's just like, just come with me.

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:42.140
And so he's like, walk with me.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.193
And now you're like on the
Presidential power walk.

00:02:44.193 --> 00:02:45.450
(audience laughs)

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.970
And I'm like just, what
do you do on this walk?

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:47.803
And he's like, you just act

00:02:47.803 --> 00:02:49.080
like you're thinking of serious things.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.019
I'm like.

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:50.852
(audience laughs)

00:02:50.852 --> 00:02:52.900
And so I'm walking next
to him the whole time

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.910
and I'm just like, yes, nuclear war,

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.235
immigration, unemployment.

00:02:58.235 --> 00:02:59.930
And so we walked together.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.040
And then we get to Parliament
and then when we got there

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.840
he introduced, and it was one
of the most surreal moments.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.330
'Cause it's one of those things
that you take for granted

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.460
because it happens gradually in life.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.880
But I genuinely just had to breathe.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.613
Like a few days after I
was gonna be like, yo.

00:03:12.613 --> 00:03:15.800
You were in Parliament and
the President of your country

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.350
was like, hey, give a round
of applause to Trevor Noah,

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.268
he's giving back to the
country and we love him,

00:03:20.268 --> 00:03:21.990
and literally in that
moment, I was sitting there

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.019
and I like, Goddamn, where
is my history teacher now?

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.046
(audience laughs)

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:29.353
What?

00:03:29.353 --> 00:03:31.056
What, what?

00:03:31.056 --> 00:03:34.723
(upbeat instrumental music)
