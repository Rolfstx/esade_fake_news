enacting immigration reform;
and reducing our deficit in

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:19.600
a balanced way.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.867
That's February 1st to February
7th or "What's Up, Camera Man?"

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:26.266
The President:
These reforms would reduce
our government's bill --

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.333
(noise from cameraman's mic)

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:32.033
(laughter)

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:33.066
What's up, cameraman?

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.633
(laughter)

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:35.700
The President:
Come on, guys!

of Technology and Innovation.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.834
The President:
Thanks to the sacrifices they've
made, the chances they've taken,

00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:52.233
the gallons of coffee
they've consumed --

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:53.367
(laughter)

00:00:53.367 --> 00:00:55.000
-- we now have batteries
that power everything from

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.033
cell phones to electric cars.

00:00:57.033 --> 00:00:59.066
We're learning to grow
organs in the lab.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:02.066
And better understand what's
happening in our deepest oceans.

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.200
Narrator:
On Superbowl Sunday, the
President sat down with "CBS

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.166
News" to discuss a range of
issues currently facing our

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.934
nation, including combat roles
for America's servicewomen.

00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:15.967
The President:
I meet extraordinary women in
uniform who can do everything

00:01:15.967 --> 00:01:17.800
that a man can and more.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.800
One of my military aides
is about five feet tall,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.667
probably weighs about
a hundred pounds,

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:28.867
you put a 50-pound pack on her
and she can do things that you

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:31.100
or me would keel over doing.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.066
Narrator:
On Monday, the President
traveled to the seat of winter,

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.900
Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he
met with men and women who are

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.867
on the frontlines of fighting to
prevent and reduce gun violence

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:42.867
in our communities, including
local police officers,

00:01:42.867 --> 00:01:45.700
community leaders and advocates
for those who have been touched

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.433
personally by gun violence.

00:01:47.433 --> 00:01:48.667
The President:
Now is the time for action.

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:51.166
That we're not going to
wait until the next Newtown,

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.200
or the next Aurora.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.834
We're not going to wait until
after we lose more innocent

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:58.233
Americans on street corners
all across the country.

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:01.433
Not going to wait until
somebody else's father

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:04.433
or son are murdered.

00:02:04.433 --> 00:02:07.266
Narrator:
On Tuesday, the President hosted
a meeting with rogressive

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:10.867
and labor leaders to discuss the
ways in which immigration reform

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:13.266
would strengthen the economy
in communities all across

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.266
the country.

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.600
The President then took the
podium at the White House

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.400
briefing room to address looming
automatic budget cuts that will

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.767
cost jobs and slow
down our recovery,

00:02:21.767 --> 00:02:23.000
also known as "the sequester."

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.900
The President:
Let's keep on chipping away
at this problem together as

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.100
Democrats and Republicans
to give our workers and our

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.367
businesses the support that
they need to thrive in the

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:34.200
weeks and months ahead.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.333
Narrator:
Later, the President dialed
up the head coach of the

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:36.900
Baltimore Ravens.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.667
The President:
I just want to say
congratulations.

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:41.500
I know it was a bumpy season
up and down and for you guys

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.734
to just stay steady the
way you did is really,

00:02:44.734 --> 00:02:46.467
is really a great feat.

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:48.567
Narrator:
The President then returned
to the Roosevelt Room,

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:51.367
this time for a meeting with
business leaders to discuss ways

00:02:51.367 --> 00:02:54.100
in which immigration reform
would benefit their businesses

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.700
by ensuring that all employees
and employers are playing by the

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.233
same set of rules.

00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:01.333
West Wing Week caught up with
Cody Keenan in the Speech

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:04.100

00:03:07.567 --> 00:03:10.800

So we are one week and five
hours from the first State

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.834
of the Union Address of the
President's second term.

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:16.734
Last night we sent him the first
draft and just met with him for

00:03:16.734 --> 00:03:17.734
about an hour.

00:03:17.734 --> 00:03:20.200
And he likes it, which
is a big relief for us.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.400
The State of the Union
process began last November

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.934
after his reelection.

00:03:23.934 --> 00:03:29.934
These are huge binders put
together by policy staff

00:03:29.934 --> 00:03:31.667

Behind the Camera:
You mean Laura Dean?

00:03:34.266 --> 00:03:35.233
Behind the Camera:

On Wednesday, the President
announced Sally Jewell as his

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:43.667

Department of Interior.

00:03:43.667 --> 00:03:45.800
And at the same time
congratulated outgoing

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.600

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.433
(applause)

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:50.133
The President:
Even as Sally spent the
majority of her career

00:03:50.133 --> 00:03:53.867
outside of Washington, where
I might add the majority of

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.266
our Interior is located --

00:03:55.266 --> 00:03:56.433
(laughter)

00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:59.333
-- she is an expert on the
energy and climate issues that

00:03:59.333 --> 00:04:01.033
are going to shape our future.

00:04:01.033 --> 00:04:04.033
She has shown that a company
with more than $1 billion in

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:07.133
sales can do the right
thing for our planet.

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:10.100
Narrator:
On Thursday, the President,
the Vice President and the

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.000

Annual Prayer Breakfast,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.433
an event that has been held on
the first Thursday of February

00:04:15.433 --> 00:04:18.033
every year since 1953.

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:20.233
The President:
In the midst of
all these debates,

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:26.133
we must keep that same humility
that Dr. King and Lincoln and

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:30.867
Washington and all our great
leaders understood is at the

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:33.433
core of true leadership.

00:04:33.433 --> 00:04:36.400
And our task as citizens is
to spend our days with open

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.233
hearts and open minds.

00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:42.567

members of his Cabinet to talk

And thanks again for checking

00:04:56.166 --> 00:04:58.834
The President:
I want to congratulate these
extraordinary Americans once

00:04:58.834 --> 00:05:01.667
again for all their
accomplishments.

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:07.333
I want to wish our military
aides the best of luck as they

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:09.367
attempt to read the citations --

00:05:09.367 --> 00:05:10.800
(laughter)

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:17.266
-- because I can assure you
they practiced hard on this

00:05:17.266 --> 00:05:19.233
all week long.

00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:20.667
You good? You feel good?

00:05:20.667 --> 00:05:22.533
(laughter)

00:05:22.533 --> 00:05:23.133
All right.

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:24.734
There are a lot of syllables
in some of these things.

00:05:24.734 --> 00:05:26.367
(laughter)

00:05:26.367 --> 00:05:27.133
All right.

00:05:27.133 --> 00:05:29.233
And I won't know the
difference; but they will!

00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:31.200
(laughter)

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.500
The President:
All right,
congratulations everybody.

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.200
Come on.

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.433
(applause)
