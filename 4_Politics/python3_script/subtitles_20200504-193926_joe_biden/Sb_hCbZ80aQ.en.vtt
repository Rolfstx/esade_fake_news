How you doing?

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.228 align:start size:91% position:9%

- Not good? What happened?

00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:31.164 align:start size:56% position:44%
I'm here.
Long night, Conan.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.465 align:start position:0%
Okay. Nothing's gonna
make you feel better

00:00:32.498 --> 00:00:34.167 align:start position:0%
than a good workout.
Here's my thought,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.470 align:start position:0%
nothing gets the endorphins
going like wrestling

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:40.106 align:start position:0%
with large naked men.

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:41.307 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Okay. That's...
- You wanna hear what we're

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.475 align:start size:88% position:13%
- gonna do today?
- What are we gonna do?

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:43.743 align:start position:0%
We're gonna
sumo wrestle.

00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:46.780

( yelling in

00:00:55.354 --> 00:00:57.156
It was interesting
because I was watching

00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:00.393 align:start position:0%
male pornography
when a pop-up ad came up

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:02.728
for male sumo wrestling
and I thought,

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.264 align:start size:97% position:3%
- "That's what I see
  when I look in the mirror."
- ( laughs )

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:06.632 align:start position:0%
So...

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:08.201 align:start size:69% position:31%
You're a damaged soul.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:09.368
It's not my fault.

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.636 align:start position:0%
Grew up in
a rough neighborhood.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:11.704 align:start size:22% position:78%
Enough.

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:14.740 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Conan, enough.
- (laughs)

00:01:14.773 --> 00:01:16.576 align:start size:41% position:59%
How does your
wife do it?

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.611
How does she do it?

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:21.214 align:start position:0%
Well, I'll be honest,
she never seems quite happy.

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:23.483
- Oh, my God.
- ( laughs ) 

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.751 align:start size:34% position:66%
Oh, my God.

00:01:25.784 --> 00:01:28.654 align:start position:0%
So listen,
sumo wrestlers burn

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:30.556
up to 30,000 calories
a day.

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:31.624 align:start size:78% position:22%
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:33.226 align:start position:0%
So here's what
we got to do,

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.661 align:start size:94% position:6%
- we got to carbo load if--
- We got to what?

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:37.730 align:start position:0%
There's a new school
of thought, very new.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:38.798
It says,
before you exercise

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:42.135
you have to get
as many fats,

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:44.704
and as much sugar
into you as possible.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.639 align:start position:0%
This is what I always do
when I walk into a restaurant.

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.141 align:start position:0%
Watch this.

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:50.543
Hey, folks, everyone
settle down, yeah.

00:01:50.576 --> 00:01:51.711
Some pretty
big celebrities

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:53.212
just walked
into the room.

00:01:53.245 --> 00:01:54.714
Let's not get crazy,
all right?

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.383 align:start position:0%
This happens every day,
just settle down.

00:01:57.416 --> 00:01:59.852
I do that every time
I walk into a joint.

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:01.454 align:start size:31% position:69%
( laughs )

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:03.456 align:start size:56% position:44%
Waitress:
Good morning.
Can I get you guys

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:04.824
some coffee maybe?

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:06.292 align:start size:47% position:53%
Yeah, actually
let me get a...

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:07.393 align:start size:41% position:59%
black coffee.

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:08.861 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Okay.
- Do want a coffee?

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:10.496 align:start size:53% position:47%
Yeah.
Do you have beer?

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.265
- I do, yes.
- Wait, what?

00:02:12.298 --> 00:02:13.599 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Do you have Sam Adams?
- I sure do.

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:15.935 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Give me a Sam Adams.
- No, no. Stop. No

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:17.436 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I want a Sam Adams.
  I want to carbo load.
- I'll go ahead

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.338 align:start size:88% position:13%
- and get that for him.
- I order for me,

00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:20.806
- he orders for him.
- it's a good starter
  for the morning.

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.808 align:start position:0%
- I'll get a Sam Adams.
- And you're old enough, right?

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:25.611 align:start position:0%
- I love you. ( growls )
- I'll be right back. ( laughs )

00:02:25.644 --> 00:02:27.613
Women love it
when you... ( growls )

00:02:27.646 --> 00:02:29.348 align:start size:19% position:81%
Conan.

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:30.683
All right, that's it.

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:32.185
Do you want
some of this?

00:02:32.218 --> 00:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
This is free.
You can have as many of these

00:02:33.953 --> 00:02:36.589 align:start size:94% position:6%
- as you want.
- Hey, Conan, don't do that.

00:02:36.622 --> 00:02:37.957 size:78% position:39%
I take these when I go...

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.660
- All right, all right.
- ...to a restaurant.

00:02:40.693 --> 00:02:43.362 align:start size:97% position:3%
- All right.
- We don't need the Sam Adams.

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:44.964 align:start size:94% position:6%
- There you go.
- Sam Adams is a good beer.

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:47.366 align:start position:0%
Would you guys
like to order?

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:48.868 align:start position:0%

- scrambled egg whites, okay.

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:52.972 align:start size:44% position:56%
Turkey bacon,

- the whole wheat toast.
- Would you like that

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:55.675 align:start position:0%
with butter?

00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:57.443
- No. Ugh.
- No butter?

00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:58.711 align:start size:91% position:9%
- No butter.
- Eat healthy all the way.

00:02:58.744 --> 00:02:59.879 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah. Healthy all the way.
- Okay.

- What about you?

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:02.949 align:start size:72% position:28%
All right, I would like
two Belgian waffles

- Okay.

00:03:05.684 --> 00:03:06.719 align:start size:41% position:59%
I would also
like sausage.

I would also like
to have pancakes.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:10.690
How many do you want?

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:12.325 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I want like nine pancakes.
- Nine of them.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:13.626 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Stop.
- Okay. I would also like--

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.228
Excuse me,

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:17.330 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Okay. Stop.
- Did I interrupt your order?

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:18.998 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Okay?
- Okay, perfect.

00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.500
