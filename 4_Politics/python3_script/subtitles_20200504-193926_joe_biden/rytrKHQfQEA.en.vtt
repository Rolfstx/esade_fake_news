00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370 position:98%
ROBERT COSTA: President Trump and governors confront economic turmoil and the former VP

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.750
faces tough questions.

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.980 position:98%
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: (From video.) I think we did a spectacular job.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.710 position:97%
COSTA: The White House on the defensive amid economic, health, and political challenges,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.710 position:67%
and with fresh attacks on longtime targets.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.080 position:97%
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: (From video.) China is a very sophisticated country and they

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.350
could have contained it.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.610 position:97%
They were either unable to or they chose not to, and the world has suffered greatly.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.280 position:83%
COSTA: In some states, protesters pressure governors.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.320 position:97%
MICHIGAN GOVERNOR GRETCHEN WHITMER (D): (From video.) Everyone's entitled to their

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.250 position:98%
opinion, but I am not going to make decisions about our public health based on political games.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.420 position:98%
COSTA: And the 2020 campaign takes a turn as former Vice President Joe Biden denies a

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.490 position:67%
former aide's allegation of sexual assault.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.880 position:98%
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: (From video.) I assure you it did not happen, period.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.720
COSTA: Next.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:07.780 position:97%
ANNOUNCER: This is Washington Week. Once again, from Washington, moderator Robert Costa.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.760
COSTA: Good evening.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.120 position:98%
As President Trump settles in tonight for a weekend at Camp David, he's facing not only a

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.750 position:98%
pandemic but a pressure cooker out in the country, a nation on edge: 64,000 dead,

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.710 position:97%
economic desperation, political tensions, and fiscal uncertainty as Congress considers

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.790 position:97%
its next step. All those issues are now front and center, with governors in both

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.620 position:89%
parties grappling with how and when to reopen businesses.

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.830 position:97%
And the president, he hovers over everything, lashing out at his critics and receiving

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.630 position:98%
new updates this week from advisors about the political cost of the crisis.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.260 position:98%
Joining me are four reporters covering these stories: Yamiche Alcindor, White House

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.940 position:98%
correspondent for the PBS NewsHour; Weijia Jiang, White House correspondent for CBS News;

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.030 position:97%
Susan Page, Washington bureau chief for USA Today; and Philip Rucker, White House bureau

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.030 position:98%
chief for The Washington Post. Let's begin tonight with the president and the states.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.920 position:97%
One revealing snapshot is Michigan, where Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer has faced

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.100 position:98%
intense protests for extending her emergency declaration to May 28th. Some protesters

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.340 position:97%
this week even carried weapons. President Trump tweeted on Friday that Whitmer should,

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.140 position:97%
quote, "give a little" and put out the fire, and added these are, quote, "good people,

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.770 position:97%
but they are angry." But it's not just the president versus Democrats.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.390 position:97%
In Maryland, Republican Governor Larry Hogan told me in a Washington Post Live interview

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.540 position:98%
on Thursday that he fears the federal government could try to seize the 500,000

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.910 position:97%
coronavirus tests his state secured last week from South Korea, and he treated them like

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.410 position:64%
treasure when they landed at BWI Airport.

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.310 position:98%
MARYLAND GOVERNOR LAWRENCE HOGAN (R): (From video.) It was like Fort Knox to us because

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.980 position:91%
it's going to save the lives of thousands of our citizens.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.970 position:97%
COSTA: (From video.) The National Guard protecting tests; is the National Guard in

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.530 position:59%
Maryland still protecting those tests?

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.110 position:97%
MARYLAND GOVERNOR LAWRENCE HOGAN (R): (From video.) They are. The National Guard

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.690 position:97%
and the state police are both guarding these tests at a(n) undisclosed location.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.150 position:98%
COSTA: So amid the scattered reopening plans and the protests and the alarm about

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.010 position:97%
testing, federal health officials have warned governors to not go too far, too fast.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.940 position:98%
NIAID DIRECTOR ANTHONY FAUCI: (From video.) They know their states.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.400 position:97%
The mayors know their cities. So you want to give them a little wiggle room,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.950 position:91%
but my recommendation is, you know, don't wiggle too much.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.020 position:88%
COSTA: Weijia, welcome to Washington Week. And Dr. Fauci

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.190 position:86%
just said "don't wiggle too much" talking to governors.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.770 position:98%
When you're covering the governors out there in the states, what kind of challenges are

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:41.850 position:97%
they facing when it comes to testing as all of these states try to reopen?

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.360 position:98%
WEIJIA JIANG: You know, governors for so long have essentially been begging the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.150 position:97%
administration to help them get supplies so they can complete these tests.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.880 position:98%
You know, President Trump likes to talk a lot about the testing capacity across the

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.330 position:98%
nation, and that's one thing - that is, the potential to test Americans - but governors

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.210 position:97%
say they need the goods to do it. And despite the president and the administration

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:10.080 position:98%
insisting that they are helping, we're just not seeing that play out on the ground.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.510 position:98%
In fact, just this week President Trump rolled out a national testing blueprint in an

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.640 position:97%
effort under mounting pressure to show that he is taking leadership, but when you really

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.250 position:97%
look at this blueprint, Bob, it just shows a list of suggestions for the states.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.270 position:98%
So the big question still remains why he is not using his full power to procure these

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:40.110 position:98%
pieces of equipment that are so critical for testing. And I think it's not just the

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.710 position:97%
states, but you know, just today we're talking about the Capitol physician saying he

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.860 position:98%
doesn't have enough tests for lawmakers returning on Monday, and I think that's a

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.880 position:97%
really telling story of where we are with testing and how sorely we are still lacking.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.510 position:98%
COSTA: And, Phil, you hear it from every governor. Governor Hogan, Governor Pritzker,

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.560 position:94%
they say they may have tests, but they don't have the swabs.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.000 position:98%
So help me understand the president's confrontation with Governor Whitmer, with other

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.510 position:98%
governors. What behind the scenes is driving that strategy and those attacks?

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.760 position:97%
PHILIP RUCKER: Well, a big part of it, Bob, is simple: politics. We're in a campaign

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.860 position:98%
year, of course. The president's going to be standing for reelection in November, a

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.630 position:97%
short time away, and he's trying to shirk responsibility, shirk blame for any of the

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.250 position:97%
failings in the United States response to the coronavirus pandemic. Central, as Weijia

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:36.650 position:98%
just pointed out, is the testing failures, the struggle to get mass testing around this

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:40.790 position:98%
country. The governors don't have the swabs that they need, they don't have the trained

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.580 position:98%
technicians that they need to run those fancy new Abbott machines, and they're not able

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.460 position:97%
to perform tests at the capacity in order to feel safe reopening their states. They want

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.410 position:97%
help from Washington and they're not getting it because the White House, the president

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.830 position:97%
have determined that this should be a states issue. They don't want to have responsibility

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.740 position:97%
for a national testing strategy; they want to have the states execute it on their own.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.680 position:94%
COSTA: Yamiche, are we seeing a red state/blue state divide?

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.430 position:97%
You look at some of these states like Texas and Georgia with Republican governors moving

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.590 position:97%
swiftly to reopen, Democratic governors like Governor Whitmer facing protests.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:23.190 position:97%
YAMICHE ALCINDOR: We are. We're seeing what is really the consequences of a more

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.950 position:97%
polarized America as a whole, and now we're seeing these different policies play out state

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:33.490 position:97%
by state. I should note that what Weijia and Phil are talking about tonight are really the

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:38.030 position:98%
beginnings of how this crisis began, which is that the - from the - from the very

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:43.580 position:98%
beginning we saw state and local leaders, governors begging for some sort of real federal

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:48.380 position:97%
policy on testing, real federal policy on how to handle this coronavirus outbreak, and

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.840 position:97%
they have continued to say that. They continue to say that they want more guidance

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.630 position:97%
from the White House, that they want more help from the White House.

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.370 position:98%
So the idea that you can reopen the government without having a large testing strategy,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.390 position:98%
governors say, is just something that can't happen, and that includes some Republican

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:08.910 position:97%
governors like Larry Hogan, who se saw literally smuggle in tests from South Korea

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:13.510 position:98%
because he said that he needed to get that equipment for his state.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:17.850 position:98%
So what you're seeing is really the fruits of not only, as I said, a polarized America,

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:21.480 position:97%
but also an America where states are having to fend for themselves because the White

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.640 position:97%
House has said that they don't want to be part of this national testing strategy because

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.060 position:98%
they say it's a local issue. Of course, we have to, I think, continue to talk about

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.080 position:97%
the fact that the president said more than a month ago now that anyone who wants a

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:37.220 position:98%
test could get a test, and that wasn't true then and it's not true now.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.820 position:97%
COSTA: Susan, Phil Rucker brought up the idea of politics driving the president behind

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:45.960 position:98%
the scenes at the White House. USA Today's out with a new poll this week.

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.160 position:98%
What does it show about what could be driving and shaping the president's thinking?

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:57.200 position:97%
SUSAN PAGE: You know, we see the president not doing well with his response to the

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.960 position:75%
coronavirus. We see approval for him going down.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:05.630 position:97%
In our poll he now trails Joe Biden by 10 percentage points nationwide in a head to head

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.720 position:97%
and we find a big appetite for a more activist federal government.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.830 position:98%
A majority of Americans - and that includes both Republicans and independents and

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:17.650 position:97%
Democrats - think the federal government ought to be doing more.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.000 position:98%
I mean, I think when Americans look at what Larry Hogan said in Maryland, he's protecting

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.830 position:98%
those tests using the National Guard - he's protecting them from federal seizure.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:30.110 position:98%
He's trying to protect his state interest because he feels the federal government might

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:35.430 position:97%
work against those interests, part of the result, I think, of the president not taking

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:39.940 position:98%
more forceful national action when it comes to taking care of the supply chain on these

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:44.840 position:97%
things or taking more control over when states close and open back up.

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.310 position:84%
That's something he has definitely left to the states.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.900 position:98%
COSTA: Phil, what are we hearing about this new target of China on the president's radar?

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:58.550 position:97%
Because he keeps attacking them publicly, but is he actually going to take action against China?

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:04.170 position:98%
RUCKER: Well, Bob, he has threatened to take action. The president has said he is considering

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:09.290 position:97%
it, and sort of vaguely said that he would, that he thinks China should be punished.

00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:14.740 position:98%
He has found ways - and really over many weeks now - to point the finger at China, to

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:20.190 position:98%
blame the Chinese for allowing this virus to escape its borders, for allowing it to

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:24.880 position:97%
spread first, of course, to Europe, but then here to the United States. But it's

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:29.410 position:98%
unclear what action that will be exactly. The one thing driving the president

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:34.300 position:98%
is he wants to appear tough on China. He sees this as a central campaign issue.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:39.140 position:97%
He is trying to draw a contrast with Vice President Biden, who of course was part of the

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:44.960 position:98%
Obama administration and the so-called "pivot to Asia" several years ago, and so Trump is

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.890 position:97%
trying to use this coronavirus pandemic as a way to posture his administration vis-a-vis

00:09:50.890 --> 00:09:55.300 position:97%
China in a way that would help him in the fall campaign. But it's unclear what

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:59.480 position:97%
specific actions he would take. He has not spelled that out in detail.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.390 position:98%
COSTA: And Weijia, what are your impressions as a White House reporter?

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:05.410 position:97%
You saw Kayleigh McEnany, the new press secretary, at the lectern today.

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:08.880 position:98%
You see President Trump doing less of these two-hour daily briefings.

00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:12.610 position:97%
What's going on with the new chief of staff, Mark Meadows - the new press secretary?

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:16.360 position:98%
Is there a shift in their whole approach to their management of this?

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:21.760 position:98%
JIANG: Well, I think they had to make a change after they saw how the president was

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.410 position:97%
performing when he was sort of, you know, at the podium and spit-balling in many ways,

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:34.230 position:98%
free-falling in other ways with these really long, extended briefings that he was using

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:40.310 position:97%
also as a platform to replace those campaign rallies that he was no longer having.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:45.640 position:98%
And I think the team saw - overall - it was not helping him, and they had to change

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.320 position:97%
something. Over the weekend the president said it was not worth it for him to have

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:54.750 position:97%
the briefings. Of course that's not true because, at his core, he is the

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:59.350 position:98%
communicator- and messenger-in-chief. And he is not going to relinquish that power.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:04.340 position:97%
So what we saw this week was him doing the same thing: taking questions from the press

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:08.270 position:97%
but doing it in a different setting, so it was in a much more formal setting, and he was

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.400 position:67%
less combatative (sic), which was apparent.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:16.270 position:97%
As far as his press secretary, I think it's a big shift from her predecessor because she

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.200 position:98%
was at the podium today and, you know, I don't think we should give her too much credit

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:25.550 position:98%
for doing her job, but certainly it is a stark difference from the previous press

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:29.320 position:97%
secretary, Stephanie Grisham, who didn't have a single press briefing.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.050 position:98%
So I think Kayleigh McEnany - you know, she was out there, we knew that this was going to

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:40.810 position:97%
be the strategy to get in front of any bad messaging and try to transition that to something

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:45.300 position:98%
positive for the president which we certainly saw her at least attempt to do today.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.900 position:98%
COSTA: And Yamiche, you're in that briefing room, but I was struck by one of your

00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:53.170 position:97%
reports this week on NewsHour about reporting on the country, which is really where it

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:56.840 position:98%
really matters and where people are feeling this economic pain.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:01.080 position:98%
And you see the economic numbers in state after state so troubling.

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.630 position:97%
What have you learned this week about how the summer looks for many Americans with the

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:09.970 position:97%
rising unemployment rate, with jobs not coming back in many sectors?

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:14.920 position:98%
ALCINDOR: People frankly are scared, Bob. They're scared for their futures. They're

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.210 position:97%
scared for their families. They're scared whether or not they're going to be able to

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:22.920 position:97%
survive and thrive in a financial and an emotional way when it comes to this outbreak.

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.140 position:98%
What you are seeing is jobless numbers that we just have never seen before, and the

00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:31.350 position:98%
president is saying that he is hopeful that in the third or fourth quarter this year that

00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:35.560 position:97%
things will get back to being positive. But what we know is that Americans are

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:39.670 position:98%
going to keep some of the behaviors that they have kept and learned throughout this

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:45.170 position:98%
outbreak. When will we see big, long lines at restaurants again? That might not come back

00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:50.720 position:98%
and bounce back in the same way even if mayors and governors continue to open up their economies.

00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:53.890 position:97%
So I think what we're going to see is there are going to be a lot of essential workers -

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.680 position:98%
and when I say essential workers I'm thinking of people that are also grocery store

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.850 position:97%
people, that are people that are serving food - that those people who are essential to

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.680 position:98%
our society and the functioning of our society, that those people might be the most out

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.120 position:97%
of luck. So I think that there are just a lot of people who are really afraid.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.220 position:97%
I want to also add what Weijia was just talking about when it comes to the press

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.910 position:95%
secretary because there was just such a big difference today.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:18.520 position:98%
The big, overall difference that I saw was that, while the messaging is the same when you

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.210 position:98%
look at Kayleigh McEnany, what you get from her is, I think, a less harsh - she was

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:27.390 position:98%
pushing back on reporters, but in a way that seemed a little bit slicker, and I think -

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:30.970 position:98%
as soon as she walked out I thought, this is someone who President Trump will likely like

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:35.240 position:97%
because she is someone who has already cut her teeth on network TV - auditioning for the

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.810 position:97%
job almost - in defending the president even before she met him.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:42.660 position:97%
COSTA: Susan, you are writing a book on Speaker Pelosi - I can't wait to read it - and

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.800 position:98%
she said this week she wants a trillion dollars in this next round of legislation to help

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.600 position:98%
states, to address many of the concerns that Yamiche just brought up that she's hearing

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:55.990 position:97%
from people out in the country. How realistic is it that Congress is going to come together?

00:13:55.990 --> 00:14:00.460 position:97%
Because we know Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell - he wants liability protection

00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.750 position:98%
for businesses as part of this package if he's going to give any money to states.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:10.760 position:97%
PAGE: Well, the Congress has approved an extraordinary amount of spending already, and

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.650 position:97%
in a pretty quick fashion, and in a reasonably bipartisan way.

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.120 position:98%
But I think that's going to be tougher with this next bill that they are working on

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:22.590 position:98%
because Democrats are going to insist on funding for state and local governments;

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:26.210 position:80%
Republicans have been less enthusiastic about that.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:30.390 position:98%
Mitch McConnell, who is a conservative Republican with some history of worrying about

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:34.340 position:97%
debts and deficits - some of those concerns may have come a little bit more to the fore.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.220 position:97%
Republicans want to look at liability protection for employers and others.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:43.690 position:97%
So it seems to me it's going to be perhaps a longer process than we've seen.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:49.810 position:98%
But we do see a big appetite for government spending by people who feel they are just

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:56.170 position:97%
under water, under fire, under siege, and are really looking to the government to help

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:01.550 position:97%
them out. And that has been a philosophy - that's been a sense of the country that

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:06.430 position:98%
has propelled the Congress to make some of these extraordinary expenditures so far.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:09.990 position:97%
COSTA: Phil, to wrap up this discussion about the White House, I want to start - go back

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:14.660 position:98%
to where we started: the raw politics driving so much of this. And the Post and

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.220 position:98%
others have reported this week the president had a private exchange with Brad Parscale,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:23.590 position:97%
his campaign manager - pretty tense based on the reporting. What have you heard?

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:28.480 position:97%
RUCKER: That's right, Bob. The president, on Wednesday, was confronted by Brad

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.480 position:97%
Parscale, his campaign manager, as well as Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.090 position:98%
Republican National Committee, who brought him a fresh batch of internal polling.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:41.620 position:97%
And it actually showed Trump losing to Joe Biden. It not only showed him losing to

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:45.800 position:97%
Biden, but showed that these press briefings that he has been doing every day were

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:49.720 position:98%
really taking a toll on his political standing and were damaging.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:54.230 position:98%
And the president erupted at his aides. He said that he didn't believe the numbers.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:59.310 position:97%
He said that he can't possibly be losing to Biden, that he thinks people like his briefings.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:05.140 position:98%
And it was a tense exchange, and an acrimonious back and forth with Parscale that

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.160 position:98%
extended for two days to the point where the president threatened to sue his campaign

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.450 position:97%
manager, although it's not clear if he was being serious about that.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.640 position:97%
They've since patched it up, and this is reporting, by the way, from our colleague and

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:23.690 position:98%
friend Josh Dawsey. But it's a sign of how much the political standing,

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:28.700 position:97%
credibility, fortunes of this president hang in the balance because of the pandemic.

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.040 position:98%
COSTA: Let's stick with the political talk for a few minutes and flip to the Democratic

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.830 position:97%
side of the 2020 race. On Friday, former Vice President Joe Biden addressed an

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:41.720 position:97%
allegation of sexual assault by Tara Reade, a former aide in his Senate office. Here

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:47.200 position:97%
is part of the interview on MSNBC's Morning Joe with the presumptive Democratic nominee.

00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:49.830 position:97%
MIKA BRZEZINSKI: (From video.) Would you please go on the record with the American

00:16:49.830 --> 00:16:53.130 position:69%
people? Did you sexually assault Tara Reade?

00:16:53.130 --> 00:16:56.180 position:98%
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: (From video.) No, it is not true.

00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:01.610 position:97%
I'm saying unequivocally it never, never happened, and it didn't. It never happened.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:05.350 position:97%
COSTA: Mr. Biden then called on the National Archives to release any documents

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:08.960 position:98%
related to Reade's allegation. When pressed about his papers at the University of

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.810 position:97%
Delaware, Biden asserted that his personnel files are, quote, "not there." He also

00:17:12.810 --> 00:17:16.440 position:78%
declined to discuss Reade's decision to speak out.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.150 position:98%
MIKA BRZEZINSKI: (From video.) You have said in the past that if a woman goes under the

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:24.270 position:97%
lights and talks about something like this, we have to consider that the essence of this

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:30.300 position:97%
is real. Is the essence of what she is saying is real? Why do you think she is doing this?

00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:33.450 position:98%
FORMER VICE PRESIDENT JOSEPH BIDEN: (From video.) I'm not going to question her motive.

00:17:33.450 --> 00:17:37.040 position:98%
I'm not going to get into that at all. I don't know why she is saying this.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:42.160 position:97%
I don't know why, after 27 years, all of a sudden this gets raised. I don't understand it.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.980 position:97%
But I'm not going to go in and question her motive. I'm not going to attack her. She has

00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:52.790 position:98%
a right to say whatever she wants to say, but I have a right to say, look at the facts.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:57.750 position:98%
COSTA: Susan, as a political reporter who has covered VP Biden,

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:01.400 position:94%
what did you learn from this interview, and this whole week?

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:06.700 position:98%
PAGE: Yeah, you know, I think that the Biden camp decided they had to do something.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:11.550 position:97%
He hadn't had to respond to this question himself in a television interview yet.

00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:15.950 position:98%
I think they thought this was necessary but not sufficient, that he had to do this.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:19.800 position:97%
But this story is not over. He is going to have more questions about it.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:25.920 position:98%
You know, it's a hard - we found him being totally unequivocal in his denial that

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:30.430 position:98%
anything happened, but he was - but he seemed flummoxed when he was asked about the

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:34.150 position:98%
University of Delaware archives. That sort of surprised me he didn't have an answer

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:38.700 position:97%
readier for that. And he also struggled, I think, to reconcile what he said during

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.720 position:83%
the Brett Kavanaugh hearings with his attitude today.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.440 position:91%
That is something he is going to have to talk about again.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.390 position:97%
COSTA: Just before the broadcast, the vice president issued a statement calling on the

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:53.340 position:97%
Secretary of the Senate to ask for a search to be done on any Senate records, but he's

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.640 position:91%
still holding tight on his University of Delaware records.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.370 position:97%
Weijia, is that going to become a campaign issue, the Delaware papers?

00:19:00.370 --> 00:19:04.440 position:97%
JIANG: Well, I think it's already become an issue because the Trump campaign and

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:10.730 position:98%
surrogates are demanding, you know, as much transparency as possible when it comes to

00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:15.640 position:98%
Tara Reade and the vice president - to the former vice president.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:21.550 position:98%
But I think, you know, President Trump himself has a very complicated relationship with

00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:26.900 position:97%
allegations of sexual misconduct. We already know that because of his personal

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:32.240 position:98%
experience of being accused by more than a dozen women. But what shocked me, frankly,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:38.740 position:98%
was when he talked about it last night because he said that these accusations against

00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:46.390 position:98%
Mr. Biden could possibly be false. And so, you know, he talked about how he was

00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:51.150 position:98%
falsely accused. He himself brought up Brett Kavanaugh and how he was mistreated.

00:19:51.150 --> 00:19:56.190 position:97%
And just today President Trump said if, you know, I were talking to Joe Biden, I would

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:02.040 position:97%
say go out and fight these claims. It's almost as if they're in the same club of -

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.800 position:98%
you know, as being accused, and that's going to come back and haunt the president

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:12.960 position:98%
because every time his campaign tries to make it an issue, you know, they can - the

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.010 position:97%
Democrats can point to the president's words to defend Vice President Biden.

00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:20.950 position:73%
COSTA: Yamiche, I see you want to jump in here?

00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:25.790 position:97%
ALCINDOR: Yeah, I think the interesting position that President Trump finds himself in

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.720 position:98%
is that he can't really go that hard at Joe Biden for this because we know that more than

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.850 position:97%
two dozen women have accused President Trump of some form of sexual assault.

00:20:33.850 --> 00:20:37.820 position:97%
Now, Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, today said that this is all four

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:42.860 position:97%
years old and that people - that that was already decided when people decided to elect

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.160 position:98%
President Trump, but that's - she was wrong on the facts there. This is not four years old.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:52.240 position:97%
Just last year we had E. Jean Carroll come out, and just this year she was trying to

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:58.560 position:97%
seek the president's DNA in January 2020 for a lawsuit related to the sexual assault

00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.820 position:98%
allegations that she's making against the president. So I think this is going to be a tough spot.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.450 position:97%
The president, obviously, has surrogates that want to attack Joe Biden using this Tara

00:21:06.450 --> 00:21:11.100 position:98%
Reade allegations, and Joe Biden, as Susan said, is going to have to continue to answer

00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:16.010 position:98%
these questions because there is going to continue to be more and new reporting about who

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:20.710 position:97%
was in the office, what kind of atmosphere that was, these pictures of Joe Biden hugging

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:24.800 position:97%
women and touching women in ways that some said made them feel uncomfortable, others who

00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:28.410 position:97%
said that they thought it was just him being friendly. Those pictures are going to

00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:31.520 position:97%
continue to circulate. So I think Joe Biden has a long road ahead of him when it

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.640 position:98%
comes to this, but again, President Trump, it's not going to be - I think hit

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:38.580 position:97%
him as hard as he might want to or as hard as the campaign wants to.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.240 position:97%
COSTA: Phil, speaking of that long road ahead Yamiche just mentioned, you and I, we've

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.310 position:97%
been on the campaign trail many years together talking to top Democrats.

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:51.010 position:98%
They're an important constituency for the former vice president - Speaker Pelosi, top

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:54.620 position:98%
strategists, party officials. How are they responding, perhaps even

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:59.010 position:89%
privately to you today, as they watch all of this unfold?

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:04.110 position:98%
RUCKER: Well, Bob, it's clearly not a story that any top Democrat would want to be in

00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:09.160 position:98%
the news right now or want to be talking about. That said, they have arrayed behind

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:14.500 position:98%
Vice President Biden. He has had the support of Speaker Pelosi and of other prominent

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:19.390 position:97%
women and men in the - in the Democratic Party in the past couple of days.

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:26.710 position:98%
There did seem to be a private sort of groundswell of urging that Biden get out there and

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:32.300 position:97%
rip this Band-Aid off and talk about it. He, for days and days, was avoiding media

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:36.530 position:97%
interviews and wasn't putting himself out there where he could be questioned about

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:41.680 position:97%
these allegations in detail the way he was this morning by Mika Brzezinski on Morning Joe.

00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.950 position:97%
And so I suspect we're going to see, you know, a lot of top Democrats rally around the

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:50.940 position:97%
vice president and take him at his word, and also point to his record.

00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.510 position:98%
He was in the Senate for many, many years, and in addition to that eight years as the

00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:59.320 position:98%
vice president, and he has a governing record on things that he has done to support

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.180 position:97%
women, the Violence Against Women Act, and we hear his supporters mention that again and

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.020 position:98%
again, and I imagine that's going to be part of the strategy going forward.

00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:11.960 position:98%
COSTA: Susan, just in the final minute here, as much as the vice president's supporters

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.640 position:97%
believe he can carry on and that he's going to be able to move on his campaign from this

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.400 position:98%
difficult issue, an allegation of sexual assault, this is a #MeToo moment in America, not

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:27.200 position:97%
just in American politics. How does that change the campaign in the coming weeks and months?

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:31.040 position:75%
PAGE: You know, I think it's - here's one irony.

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:35.020 position:98%
Donald Trump helped create this landscape that is creating all these problems for Joe

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:41.460 position:98%
Biden - the #MeToo movement, the opposition to his Access Hollywood tape, and some of his

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:47.010 position:97%
behavior in the past. And fairly or not, these accusations hurt Joe Biden more

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:51.880 position:98%
than they hurt Donald Trump because Joe Biden's brand is that he's empathetic

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.590 position:81%
and he's ethical and he's a nice guy in a way that -

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.650 position:59%
COSTA: We have to wrap up soon, Susan.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:00.500 position:91%
PAGE: - that is not really Donald Trump's political brand.

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:03.460 position:98%
COSTA: We could talk all night, but that's all the time we have for the moment.

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:08.050 position:97%
