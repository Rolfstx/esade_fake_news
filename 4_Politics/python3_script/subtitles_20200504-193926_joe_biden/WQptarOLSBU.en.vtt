00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.550
I wish there was just more compassion. No, we don't want to make something difficult. We just want to be acknowledged

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.518
My daughter was a victim and she's being punished

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.269
Hi, my name is Marissa Gold

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.289
I am a parent

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.308
I have two girls, ten and thirteen and I'm also a parenting expert with my own parenting company 'Intuit Parenting'.

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.000
My name is David Epstein and I'm a pediatric intensive care physician.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.370
I'm Gary Shlifer. I'm an internal medicine physician

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:48.700
I'm Bob Sears. I'm a pediatrician. I guess my greatest passion is just to help encourage a full complete informed consent for vaccinations.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I'm also Marissa.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.129
By trade am a designer. I am also an activist and a mother

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:02.070
I'm Melissa Floyd and I would consider myself an informed consent advocate

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.860
I just want to make sure this conversation can be open for people and continue to inform people and to listen to everyone to understand

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.170
Why we each come to our opinion on this

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.739
The first statement is: I am vaccinated

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.589
So I actually wasn't fully vaccinated interestingly I grew up with two parents that were into alternative medicine

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:36.170
So I was not vaccinated as a child, but as I got older I vaccinated myself. Marisa: Well, I was

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.149
Vaccinated as a child

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.499
But my last vaccine was about 15 years ago when I returned to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.850
college and I had a severe reaction and that I

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:46.970
became

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.079
arthritic in my hands. Went to many many doctors and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.339
Nobody knew what was going on and why it was happening and just shocked like it doesn't make sense

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.240
You're too young to have arthritis and it wasn't until having kids and sort of digging into my own research for them

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.149
That a lot of answers started coming up and I think it's unfortunate that a lot of it is overlooked

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.399
For me and I'll continue to get vaccinated

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:11.540
regardless of

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.950
The risks because I've seen too many things on the other side

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.060
I've seen kids, you know come into the ICU and die from being, uh, getting the flu

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.629
I've always felt like the the risks are far outweighed by the benefits of getting the protection

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:30.669
Not getting vaccinated endangers other people

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.510
I Will acknowledge, of course as a pediatrician I know vaccines work. I know they give you protection

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.370
They vary greatly in what that protection is. It's not like 100% magical shield over you completely but I do acknowledge

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:57.209
there are some vaccines like the measles vaccine and the chickenpox vaccine, that honestly if you don't get those vaccines

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.460
Yeah, you do risk catching the disease and passing it to others. It's such a complicated topic

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.600
Vaccines and you're starting to get micro with each individual vaccine

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.320
and definitely the question was

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.650
Talking about the big picture and I think yeah

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.769
If you get micro, probably some of these vaccines I think when you're giving kids medication you have to get micro about it

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.889
I don't think it's doing your kids any service to

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.240
just say X things are all made the same and they're all safe and healthy good for you that everybody's

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.400
Benefiting from it because that's false it's not true

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.080
Well, we study them before we release them to the public we study them so we do know they're safe

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.370
That's the thing is we know. Safe-ish.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.489
You know being an intensive us I see the worst of the worst and so seeing

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.680
The other side of kids who don't get vaccinated. I saw a kid walking in with meningococcemia

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.880
Which I haven't seen in decades. He had all four limbs cut off

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.439
They had to be amputated because it was all dead tissue. You forget how bad things were

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.990
before we had vaccines

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.589
I didn't step forward for that because I don't like the assumption that

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.130
If a child is unvaccinated somehow they are of risk to everyone and also knowing that

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.670
Vaccinated individuals can also be caring and spreading diseases

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.929
I think it's very polarizing to separate the two as if if you're vaccinated. You're totally fine. You're not risking

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:25.350
Anybody anything unvaccinated children don't just have diseases hanging out in their bodies waiting to unload at any moment

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.119
Anybody could be spreading diseases, especially things like polio and pertussis that are not completely covered by the vaccine.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.700
I'd do anything to keep my child safe

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.039
I agree I don't have kids but when I think about it, you know

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.719
The idea with vaccines is you're protecting all of us you're protecting the group, you know

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.670
There's this idea of herd immunity. And so I think that's why it's really important to talk about because

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.940
This is an issue. That doesn't just affect you

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.400
It affects everyone around you because there's people that aren't vaccinated that are sick or have immune issues

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.689
Or they're too young to get a vaccine and they count on her immunity

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.999
I think most people too like I started out

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.670
Vaccinating my daughter because I believed all the same things that you said

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.370
it wasn't until she had a reaction and several reactions that I actually had to look at it differently where I

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:27.659
I realized by continuing vaccinating for her that actually would hurt her and yet everyone wants me to do it for the population

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.230
As if I'm supposed to continue to sacrifice my child for everyone else

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.710
well

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:38.189
I mean there are medical exemptions for for vaccines and if your child has a reaction and then there's some there's concern

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.840
I think that's valid but I think a larger population is using other

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.330
Justifications to not get the vaccines, you know a number of families who look into vaccines

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.359
they will decide to opt out of vaccines because they feel they are just not willing to

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.809
Risk the side effects, but the side effects are the side effects are like one in a million one in two million

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.109
whereas the side effects from the diseases when I see all these

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.929
outbreaks and things like I'm gonna choose vaccines every time and that's I think right there is the disservice to this conversation because

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:15.629
It is a risk benefit analysis. And what's unfortunate is how downplayed those risks are

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:19.980
I only started investigating vaccines because I ended up with a kid with an autoimmune disorder

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:26.240
So, what does that mean and instead of finding answers? I found more questions. The one in a million is not a real number

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:29.520
And so you're more that that is put out

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.259
Is it so people think that no, well not when you're talking about the different kind of reactions

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:41.068
I think the number you're referring to is anaphylactic shock that anaphylactic shock is of course extremely rare

00:06:41.068 --> 00:06:45.920
Whereas you when you look at seizures from the MMR vaccine are one in 3,000

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:52.280
But again this creates fear in parents. Well we worry what we worry that you get those on your side kind of downplay those

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:59.380
so my daughter had seizures. Seizures for most people are considered kind of a big deal, you know when it happens to you that that

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:06.959
Downplayed element of well, that's not anaphylactic shock. It's just a seizure. It is just a seizure but seizures can be dangerous

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.550
I don't think it's an idea of downplay

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.639
I think it comes back to what we were saying with the risk benefit analysis

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.728
and I think the data is very clear that the

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.870
Benefits of giving vaccines by far outweigh the risks so I don't think it's a question of downplaying the risks. They're there

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:30.149
but we also know that children were dying and now they're not and yes, there's side effects, but they're not as bad as

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:33.419
what we had before vaccines

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.889
I don't always trust my doctor's opinion

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:52.549
Anytime anyone whether it's a teacher a friend something I read online my mom, you know my doctor anytime anyone tells me

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.879
Oh, you should do this

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:58.579
especially if it has to do with their health I'm going to do research and it's I would be

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:03.919
Careful about saying it's that I don't trust my doctor, but that has that trust has been developed over time

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:09.620
And so I would say in the early years when my children were very young when they would say this is what we recommend

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.879
Yes, of course

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:16.309
there were times where I got a second opinion or did the research on my own and asked the questions and I think that as

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:17.189
parents

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:18.529
We have to do that

00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:26.419
well, it's hard to trust someone who sees your child for 10 minutes twice a year in the end parents know their children best and

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.079
That little office visit where your pediatrician looks at your child

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:34.669
He does not know your child the way you know your child, so it's really hard for whatever recommendation

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.879
He's making to be really based and individualized for your kid

00:08:37.890 --> 00:08:44.419
So if you were to come to your doctor and say hey, my child's acting differently after this this well visit appointment

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:45.320
Something's wrong

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.049
You want them to trust that you have an established

00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:51.859
Relationship and listen to you and hear you and understand that as a mother

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:57.049
Just because you don't have the dr in front of your name. It doesn't make your opinion somehow less valuable

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:04.550
yeah, I mean I think like anyone doctors are fallible and they don't know everything and I think it's very important like you're

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.160
Mentioning to have a really strong

00:09:07.589 --> 00:09:10.789
Doctor-patient relationship. I think that's really hard in today's

00:09:11.339 --> 00:09:15.589
ten-minute appointment age, you know makes it really difficult but like as a young doctor

00:09:15.589 --> 00:09:18.319
I think there's a lot of distrust when it comes to physician

00:09:18.839 --> 00:09:22.819
Recommendations it sucks because you know you spend decades

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:30.079
training and learning and your heart is in this place where you want to like be of service to people and then

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.860
You're not trusted but you know to answer the question

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:41.149
You shouldn't just blindly trust anyone's opinion your doctor or anyone. Ironically the doctors are the ones that-  Well,

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:44.690
I trust my physicians

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:50.239
My daughter has epilepsy and in March she was also

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.959
diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis

00:09:54.390 --> 00:10:01.169
I went to the rheumatologist and the rheumatologist said we're gonna put her on methotrexate and I looked at her I'm like  methotrexate

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.710
That's a chemotherapy

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:07.199
Kimber therapeutic agent that you know kids with cancer again and she's like, yes

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:12.330
But we use it in a low dose and it doesn't cause harmful side effects. You have to trust me.

00:10:13.090 --> 00:10:15.090
I said okay and

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.380
I trusted her

00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:22.499
And I am so glad that I did before all this happened. She was a competitive gymnast and

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.319
She used to walk up and down the stairs. Like she was 90 years old. She couldn't hold a pencil in her hand now

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:33.929
she's back on the bars and back on the on the beam doing things which my wife and I

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:41.610
Never thought that she would do again. So yes, do I trust my physicians? Yes. Do I question them?

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.689
Yes, I will say look can we do this for her? Can we do this instead?

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.860
And yes, you know

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.650
I, I can appreciate what you guys have said as

00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:54.780
far as people hearing you and I think that's the biggest problem in medicine is that

00:10:55.510 --> 00:11:00.299
Time is short clinicians aren't listening and I think that as as a pediatrician

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:01.530
You know

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:02.920
one of the most important jobs

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:08.909
That we have is to listen to parents and I think that if any pediatrician isn't doing that, they're not doing their job

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:19.690
 

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.680
I don't like it I don't I want us to be able to talk I want us to be able to have

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:30.319
Relevant and educated conversations and I think at the core of this

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:32.310
conversation is

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.299
What is at the core of humanity and being a parent?

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:40.550
Which is that we all want to do right by our children and we want to lead happy healthy and productive lives

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.160
Yeah, I have no

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:50.060
doubts in my mind of how I've come to my decision making on the subject which has been

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:55.069
Tedious and thorough to say the least I did not expect to go down this path in my life

00:11:55.230 --> 00:12:00.529
But I have people who won't be friends with me who I've had death threats on social media

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:05.899
I might not even be able to send my kids to school depending on how legislation changes because of the way I

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:12.110
think it just it's insane to me how hostile this has become and it's not doing a service to

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.730
Research and science moving forward and just the overall dialogues we have in our culture

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:23.060
whatever the subject what I think is lacking in this debate or conversation is really

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:28.999
Compassion from the pro vac side or pro mandate side. I'll say the people who

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:34.339
Refuse to acknowledge that vaccine reactions are happening or that the things that happened to my daughter were

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:39.230
Connected because maybe it was just a coincidence and I just needed something to pin it on you are socially isolated

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:41.330
You can be isolated by your family

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:44.120
isolated by the medical community

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.550
isolated by society as a whole because they assume you're

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:53.359
Unintelligent uneducated and irrational. I wish there was just more compassion that no

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.569
We don't want to make something difficult. We just want to be acknowledged

00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:02.270
My daughter was a victim and she's being punished what I signed up for this it was a little bit of trepidation

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:06.680
Coming into this because you do hear things in the media

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.730
You know about the people who are anti vaccine and the way they respond to physicians and it is a little bit scary

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.150
you know as

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:21.350
Physicians we care about people there is compassion on on the medical community side

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:23.719
We wouldn't do this if we if we didn't care

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.070
but again, you know

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:30.230
I do have compassion for the families that have gone through issues with you know, with vaccines and

00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:35.429
I have a great deal compassion for the families that had children die from preventable diseases

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:40.229
There shouldn't be any hostility. There should be discussion. I mean we can always question things
