00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:17.869
China's rise as a modern nation has been
nothing short of remarkable the

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.710
country's leaders often and proudly tell
the world that in just a few decades

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.240
they've lifted more than 600 million
people out of poverty but China's

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.780
economy is Sloane
cracks in the system are starting to

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.500
appear and it's the Chinese people who
are facing the pain some economists warn

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.120
the country's building boom never
delivered real prosperity that

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.620
government spending has been poorly
managed even downright reckless wet your

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.080
finger and stick it in the wind and find
a useless project in China

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:04.670
the unchecked spending has left behind
ghost towns anger and uncertainty

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.260
I'm Steve Chow in this episode of 101
needs to investigate if this is the end

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:23.360
of China's economic miracle in
northeastern China a grand new city has

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:32.240
risen out of farmlands this ition Phu
locally known as new foo schwimmer it's

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.960
entirely deserted a ghost town of epic
proportions 22 square kilometers of

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.400
emptiness

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.050
with the economy faltering construction
ground to a halt last year leaving empty

00:01:50.050 --> 00:02:01.560
strip malls and newly paved roads
leading to nowhere since agony ha ha

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.759
we meet maangchi June a taxi driver who
agrees to show us around

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:17.580
take a lawyer's office no not at all let
me go in

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.690
shit June grew up in Altru Shrek the
original city a few kilometers away

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.260
he believes the government has
squandered taxpayers dollars and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.260
squandered their future his future

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.230
officials spent hundreds of millions of
dollars building the new zone selling

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.450
the place is a way for residents to
enjoy a modern lifestyle she drinks as

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:55.940
people aren't buying the sales pitch how
absolutely bizarre

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:06.590
say - is it anyway - a genielle my life
little buddy got hurt

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.630
let our little hi

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.860
for 30 years she joined worked at the
city's aluminum mill nearby but in 2014

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:25.040
as China's economy slowed he was laid on
rather than massive building projects

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.019
he believes money should have been spent
on helping retrain workers instead he's

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.819
had to fend for himself from making $50
a day at the factory

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:43.030
she joined now averages less than 10
Yallah showing you lots of what I'm not

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.030
reminded to tarf
you can own it are two local da from a

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.239
yarn alize yeah your thoughts on its
ugly head made with Hannah she's missing

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.540
her today
whatever

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:04.840
we visit one of the city's development
officers its reception like the rest of

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.200
the town is deserted inside we find a
model of what new foosh limb was

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.610
supposed to look like it's a grand
vision of office towers and stylish

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:21.480
residential living

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:36.460
the centerpiece of town is called the
circle of life a 60-story structure made

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:43.180
from three thousand tons of steel it
costs sixteen million dollars to build

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.180
that was meant to attract tourists but
they like the residents are yet to

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:56.500
materialize even more troubling is that
hundreds of deserted cities like this

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.240
can be found across China

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.920
there's an eerie feeling walking through
these abandoned buildings it's like time

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:19.460
has come to a standstill according to
the government China has more than 2

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.810
billion square meters of empty
residential space that's enough to house

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:28.970
more than a hundred million people these
empty shelves have in many ways become

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:36.290
symbols of a wild spending spree that
some say has gone on far too long get in

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:42.350
the car drive on any highway get off on
any exit and ask the first person you

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:47.540
run into where is the development zone
and you will be directed to a KERS and

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.900
acres of empty high-rises economists and
stephenson young spent 20 years in China

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.280
and witnessed the boom years but now
fears the country's economy could

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.490
collapse China has huge debt problem if
the problem is that it's just relied on

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.340
the same methods for a really long
period of time of spend spend spend and

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.760
she says that with all the bad
investments the country's debt is

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:23.360
mounting at an alarming pace in 2005
China owed 164 percent of its GDP today

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.169
it's almost double
this mountain of death is piling up

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:32.970
faster and the economy is growing if
China had been willing to give up that

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.909
hyper growth then it might have avoided
the potential for a serious crash and

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:48.060
the serious debt crisis but it didn't
and it won't it's not just the ghost

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:53.009
cities that point to overspending this
office building in the shape of an

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:57.990
ancient coin cost half a billion dollars
showing there's no limit to the fanciful

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.539
dreams turned into concrete reality

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:08.060
elsewhere a replica of Dubai's palm
island development meant to be a

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.740
retirement home for seniors the
construction here too has ground to a

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:20.780
halt then there's this water park the
30,000 square metre playground cost more

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.580
than 300 million dollars to build and
was scheduled to open in the summer of

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:35.539
2015 it was supposed to provide the
world's best aquatic experience the

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:40.669
sheer amount of waste here is shocking
it's taking considerable time and money

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:45.949
to mix the concrete to forge the steel
to make the bricks even to design the

00:07:45.949 --> 00:07:51.969
architecture of these buildings and
instead it's all been left to ruin

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.629
Stevenson Young says the building
projects we've seen are just the tip of

00:07:56.629 --> 00:08:01.069
the iceberg
it's a craziness on a level that you

00:08:01.069 --> 00:08:06.979
haven't seen elsewhere in the world and
you you have to think that that's going

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:11.810
to create a crisis of a level that
hasn't been seen elsewhere while

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:16.460
officials aren't keen to talk about
failure such projects are too big and

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:22.159
too numerous to ignore government
economic advisors ouchy jr. Nixon

00:08:22.159 --> 00:08:28.639
China has a problem yo Ashiya Kavita
certain local governments and parties

00:08:28.639 --> 00:08:34.849
might not have planned well an apartment
once they go bankrupt it's going to be

00:08:34.849 --> 00:08:40.550
really difficult to pay back the loans
Omaha I'm afraid we will need to take

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:47.990
further steps in order to solve this
debt issue ng ensuring a stable economy

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:53.420
is seen as crucial to the survival of
China's Communist Party its leaders have

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.339
long held an unspoken social contract
with the people leave the governing to

00:08:58.339 --> 00:09:04.610
us and we will make you rich but at this
year's annual Party Congress even the

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:10.399
leaders had to admit to making monetary
missteps erosion suna sheesh our

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:15.020
government indeed interfere in some
unnecessary things they have held back

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:20.790
economic
50 but still officials deny the notion

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:27.930
the nation is in financial trouble only
John watching gee we are fully confident

00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:33.510
of China's long-term economic growth as
long as we continue to reform and open

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:40.290
up China's economy will not suffer a
heart lending endo to prevent that hard

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:46.020
landing China is taking a controversial
gamble despite the looming debt problems

00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:51.270
it's encouraging citizens to take on
even more debt loot by more real estate

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:58.920
and clear the oversupply the question is
can they afford - traditionally Chinese

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.150
were good savers but increasingly
families are accumulating debt at a

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:08.940
frightening rate from 2007 to 2013
household debt rose by more than three

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:16.550
hundred and thirty percent that's the
highest rise anywhere in the world

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:24.220
in yet another newly built town it's
certainly business as usual we find

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:31.840
developers hard at work trying to sell
their projects hey take one hey are you

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:39.640
knightmon hey daikon we've heard that
some developers and agents are so eager

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.270
to sell they're offering ways to obtain
fraudulent mortgages

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:54.740
and yeah we meet a man who says he's
been selling real estate for two years

00:10:54.740 --> 00:11:02.500
Jamia does have a fun fun funky junky
old as you know non-college og Hopp

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:07.819
using hidden cameras our producer and I
pose as a couple interested in buying a

00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:14.029
home buying property in China used to be
one of the safest investments but the

00:11:14.029 --> 00:11:19.370
bubble has since burst in many of these
small cities that's not the story our

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:29.990
agent is telling us he says the price
has already risen tenfold

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:37.759
okay but he claims new buyers like us
can still make a hefty profit and he can

00:11:37.759 --> 00:11:45.470
easily help us get a mortgage so my god
what what do not for me cool long down

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:50.269
to when we tell him we don't have any
income earnings to show the bank's he

00:11:50.269 --> 00:11:54.130
suggests we fake a letter of employment

00:11:54.790 --> 00:12:04.000
guys always handing over the other
changing done yeah no actual thing

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.560
together while the holiday are you sold
about you are bilingual nor

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:17.890
so without the only dummy not murder
what he's suggesting is a crime then he

00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:22.570
goes further okay Bob Finnell I got to
the side of a mine well periodic losses

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:25.930
were bad Shenandoah
so these are our moons attendant

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:31.770
indefinite falsifying sale certificates
is also illegal

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:38.020
the realtor claims this is common
practice the possible result

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:43.900
the kind of debt that caused America's
subprime disaster now could be happening

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:50.830
all over again here in China home buyers
here are often told house prices will

00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:56.500
continue to rise and they can sell at a
profit instead many of these new

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.270
properties are virtually worthless

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.490
most people remain in denial it's really
kind of a fascinating thing to watch how

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:11.980
you can move all over this country and
for a long time people had really a kind

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:18.730
of um it's kind of like an a mass
delusion another sign that people are in

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:24.210
serious debt is a proliferation of loan
sharks

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:56.860
the men admit they charge back-breaking
interests for their loans belong to

00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.930

joy upon parking or we going for the
yeah

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.210
it's China's leaders that are
encouraging his people to take on debt

00:14:19.210 --> 00:14:26.410
and for some it's leading to these kinds
of shady loans and bad mortgages we find

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:37.930
an excuse to leave one of those worried
about paying back her mortgage is the

00:14:37.930 --> 00:14:42.360

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.670
what he plows

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:20.310
June Shaw and her workers aren't the
only ones struggling to survive the

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.200
collapse of industry and the loss of
jobs is fueling anxiety and anger across

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.400
the country
just weeks ago in China's southwest

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:35.460
these miners went on strike far from
sharing in the promised prosperity they

00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:41.490
find themselves struggling to survive
so will many single visitor need you to

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:46.140
watch see don't push out on the moonlit
sit up walrus with his hand is younger

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:53.090
area hopefully she don't forget your
woman album good DJ today the UN action

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:59.530
the strike here was quickly shut down
and most of the leaders have been

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:04.380
arrested threatened with losing their
jobs many of the miners return to work

00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:09.460
but during shift change we managed to
talk with one protest organizer who

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:15.070
avoided jail that's all on him incognito
saw your clothes on her woman trench on

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:21.640
the general what am I wrong sure Bing
has spent his life in the mines but it's

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:27.550
a life that's getting tougher with less
work and less pain what finally made

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.150
them walk off the job was learning the
company had cheated them out of their

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:35.710
