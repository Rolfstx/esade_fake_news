Hello friends in this video I will show
you how to heat up a camping tent with a

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.580
Finnish-style log stove also known as a
Finnish log torch there are several

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.210
methods to heating up a camping tent
without a portable metal stove you can

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.910
set up a long log gap fire outside the
tent just close enough so that the heat

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.910
would radiate through the tent wall also
you can heat up a large rock and bring

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.250
it inside the tent you can easily find a
large rock in the root ball of a falling

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.040
tree even in a snowy forest but this
video will demonstrate how to heat up a

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.719
camping tent using a stream of warm air
from a metal pipe running through a

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.160
Finnish log torch I have already tried
this method using traditional campfire

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.410
but was not happy with the results this
time I'm using a Finnish torch with a

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.290
curved pipe as a modification to the
prior method I should say upfront that I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.670
was pleasantly surprised how well the
tent heating method worked this time

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.450
first of all we will need a metal pipe
for our experiment

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.840
I used the curved steel pipe from the
headrest of a vintage metal bed the

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.970
headrest was rusty so it took me some
time and effort to disassemble it into

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:36.810
parts and clean them both outside and
inside okay now we have all we need to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.899
conduct the tent heating experiment in
the snowy forest a pipe thermometer and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.619
wood

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.280
I stashed a few dry segments of a
fallen fir tree last summer so we could

00:01:53.280 --> 00:02:00.450
save time on cutting it now I left the
wood segments wedged and suspended in

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.210
the original log so they could stay dry

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.670
now we need to make a Finnish log torch
the log torch unlike the Finnish log

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.110
candle keeps all the fire inside the
wood segment it burns

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.650
slower and more economically to maximize
the economy and duration of heating are

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.590
the two characteristics I want to
achieve in this project there are many

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.370
ways you can make a log torch but I'll
use the easiest one it is about 10

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.480
degrees Fahrenheit -12 Celsius
outside and all the moisture in the wood

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:48.240
freezes so it becomes fairly easy to
chop wet wood as the frozen moisture

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.000
swells the log from inside however my
log segments are dry because they were

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.709
kept suspended above the ground so it
isn't that easy to chop them without a

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:11.100
wedge to make a log torch tent heater
you need to chop a segment of wood into three or four large pieces and
remove the cool portion of each piece

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:16.850
just enough so that you could loosely
feed the pipe inside the formed channel

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.890
because I was chopping wood for two log
torches (for two experiments) I got warm

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.910
real quick my trusted Billinas #9
Finnish axe rose to the challenge I think

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.860
it is one of the best multi-purpose axes
out there I even used it to build my log

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:43.230
cabin at Ladoga Lake traditionally you
would reinforce a Finnish log torch with

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.480
viza a rope made from fir branch I will
leave a link to my video about how to

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.269
make such bushcraft rope below this time
however I will use my homemade clamper

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.970
and steel wire as it is a lot faster
time is valuable in the northern winter

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.700
forest
because the day is short and I need to

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:08.970
assemble two log torches and my tent
before dark the reason I need two log

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.430
torches is because I need to test two
metal pipe shapes a single-bent pipe and

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:24.120
a u-shaped pipe we will try a u-shaped
steel pipe experiment first obviously we

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.530
would have to insert the U-shaped pipe
into the torch's triangular opening

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:36.960
before clamping the torch assembly once
I added legs to this log torch it became

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.590
heavier but it is still fairly mobile I
can easily pick it up by its legs and

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.170
carry it to the tent in order to heat up
a tent,

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:55.050
well, we need a tent)))  this means it is
time to set up my tried and tested tent

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:02.310
model UP5 it is a spacious camping tent
for five people almost a small studio

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.270
apartment with no pesky neighbors and a
great location however it won't be easy

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:14.250
to heat up such a large space which
makes the experiment even more

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.700
interesting and trustworthy my double
wall russian-made tent has an

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:28.590
umbrella-like frame that allows you to
set it up quickly now it is time to fire

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:35.430
up our log torch as I said earlier I
nailed three legs to each log torch for

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:44.790
better air flow and stability next I
cleared a small spot from snow so that

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:51.180
the log torch wouldn't fall on the tent
once the snow melts under it I didn't

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:55.980
have a shovel so I just stomped and
pushed the snow aside with my legs I was

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.540
glad I had my custom tailored gaiters on
they prevented snow from getting into my

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:04.980
shoes and getting my feet wet I will
leave a link to the gaiter template below

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:12.120
in case you're interested as you can see
I nailed the legs with their longer

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:17.390
portions at the bottom and
checked the torch assembly with my weight

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.950
however I decided to install the torch
upside down to use its longer leg as a

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:29.370
pipe support this way the metal pipe
will be suspended in the air and it will

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:36.450
not press on snow under the torch or the
torch's inner burning part I made a V-cut

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:42.360
on the tip of a former leg and now the
heating pipe is well secured you can

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:49.050
also use two nails to secure it if you
don't have a sword to make a V-cut the

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:54.480
easiest way to start our log torch is
to plug the central hole at the bottom

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:01.680
with a piece of bark then stuff it with
dry branches and wood chips it only

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:09.150
takes one match to start the fire then I
didn't do a great job chopping and

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:13.620
reassembling the log segment into a
torch with no radial gaps

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:18.960
this means the fire will eat up the
torch faster through those gaps which is

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:25.050
why I put some snow in them to prolong
the torch's life once the log torch

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:30.510
reaches its cruising temperature you
won't see any flames outside the torch's

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:35.760
walls inside will slowly burn which in
turn will heat the fresh air inside the

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:43.290
pipe that is flowing up to the tent note
the fresh air gets into the pipe below

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:50.210
the level of the log torch preventing
any carbon monoxide from mixing into it

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:56.670
it is freezing outside and the long
aluminum pipe cools off quickly if the

00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.680
first pipe segment is too hot to touch
the second segment that is closer to the

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:08.370
tent is noticeably cooler to improve the
torch's efficiency I decided to move it

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:13.350
closer to the tent and this is where I
made a mistake I didn't push the legs

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:18.440
all the way to the ground and I faced
the consequences later

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:27.560
my tent has two entrances so I could use
one door to run the heating pipe through

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:34.190
and use the other one for all other
needs note I'm not forcing the airflow

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:39.050
in any way yet the airflow is
significant I'm using a small feather to

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:46.130
demonstrate it admittedly my tent is
large and it will take at least an hour

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:51.649
to heat the top through such a small
diameter pipe without supercharging this

00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:56.329
is why it's still freezing inside the
tent but I make it to wait to see if

00:08:56.329 --> 00:09:01.130
this tent heating method works so I
decided to take a short nap in my cozy

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:13.339
sleeping bag I was napping for at least
an hour and a half before I got out of

00:09:13.339 --> 00:09:18.440
the sleeping bag to measure the air
temperature the air got really warm

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:23.630
inside the tent even though I forgot to
close a small chimney hatch which means

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:30.620
it would have been even warmer inside
once I put my shoes on and looked

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.140
outside I saw that the log torch fell on
its side because I forgot to push its

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:41.420
legs all the way to the ground the log
torch melted snow and evenly which

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:48.199
caused it to topple I'm glad I didn't
put the torch too close to the tent as it

00:09:48.199 --> 00:09:52.209
would have burned a hole in the wall

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.499
even though the toppled log torch could
have still worked longer I couldn't wait

00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:05.739
to test a single-bend-pipe design of
this method so I prepared and fired up

00:10:05.739 --> 00:10:13.089
my second torch to save time I used the
same legs with nails but this time I used

00:10:13.089 --> 00:10:17.859
my clamper to reinforce the log torch
over the legs as well which pulled the

00:10:17.859 --> 00:10:21.999
log pieces together even tighter
resulting in smaller gaps between them

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:27.819
thus resulted in longer burning time
also thanks to the additional metal wire

00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:32.980
clamps the torch ended up being extra
strong I got a little carried away

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:38.350
jumping on it to demonstrate its
durability ))) I think I might adopt this

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.730
simple idea of just clamping parts
together with steel wire to make

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:48.429
primitive log furniture for my cabin I
hammered two nailes at the bottom opening

00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:54.549
to prevent small branches from falling
through it it was easier and faster to

00:10:54.549 --> 00:10:59.919
start the fire without a U-shaped pipe
sticking from the opening another

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:05.399
advantage is you can easily move a
burning torch from one place to another

00:11:05.399 --> 00:11:11.589
something you couldn't really do with a
burning campfire this is why I decided I

00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:16.959
like the single-bent pipe method better
because the U-shaped pipe cannot be

00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:28.389
removed from the burning torch if needed
it is 10 degrees Fahrenheit -11 Celsius now the efficiency of such a log
heater depends greatly on the

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:32.769
temperature gradient in other words the
greater the temperature difference

00:11:32.769 --> 00:11:39.519
inside and outside the tent the better
the air flow will be I reached 57

00:11:39.519 --> 00:11:45.129
degrees +14 Celsius inside and that
is considering I didn't call the second

00:11:45.129 --> 00:11:51.189
door fully so there is a 47 degrees
Fahrenheit 25 degrees Celsius

00:11:51.189 --> 00:11:56.019
temperature gradient to be honest I
didn't expect such an impressive result

00:11:56.019 --> 00:12:00.669
I would dare to suggest you can reach
tropical temperature values in a small

00:12:00.669 --> 00:12:05.289
tent the temperature of the air coming
out from the pipe is definitely higher

00:12:05.289 --> 00:12:10.269
than 140 degrees Fahrenheit
degree +60 Celsius unfortunately my

00:12:10.269 --> 00:12:14.050
thermometer scale maxes out at 140 Fahrenheit

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:21.279
+60 degrees Celsius here are a few words
about the methods safety firstly there

00:12:21.279 --> 00:12:25.810
is no fire inside the tent secondly
there is a constant fresh air flow

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:31.180
coming into the tent you are totally
protected against carbon monoxide

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:36.160
poisoning because the pipe gets the
fresh cold air below the level of the

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:42.519
burning log torch also a log stove can
be used for cooking food even while it's

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:47.740
heating up your tent I personally like
the single-bent pipe modification of the

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:53.290
method better you can put the pipe in or
take it out at any time which makes it

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:58.149
easier to start the fire to cook certain
dishes or to carry a burning log torch

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:02.380
to another location
however the U-shaped pipe scheme gets

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:06.430
the fresh air from the side and if a
small burning ember falls through the

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:11.740
torch you won't smell any smoke inside
the tent from my experience even if that

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:19.329
happens you can barely smell any smoke
inside the tent so my conclusion is this

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:24.250
it was an interesting experience and
successful experiment it is labor

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:28.839
consuming but safe and effective
besides carrying three short metal pipes

00:13:28.839 --> 00:13:34.029
is a lot easier than carrying a portable
metal stove while traveling in the snowy

00:13:34.029 --> 00:13:38.230
wilderness
I think this method can be further

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:42.310
improved if you have any thoughts how
you can make it even more efficient

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:49.120
please write it below I would love to
hear your suggestions lastly if you

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:53.290
extinguish a locked torch a little
before it is fully burned you can get

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:58.449
yourself an unusual piece of primitive
furniture I haven't quite figured out

00:13:58.449 --> 00:14:04.949
how I could use it let me know if you have
any idea what can be done with it

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:13.230
the log torch idea has a lot of other
practical applications for example I

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.570
recently published a video about an
original bushcraft dish that I called a

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:22.800
vertical shish kebab
it is a skewered spiral potato with a

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.850
hot dog inside
I have grilled the dish on the campfire

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:32.010
many times and always found it delicious
however the vertical cooking method has

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:36.839
its advantages firstly you don't have to
rotate the skewer yet the dish

00:14:36.839 --> 00:14:42.330
cooks quicker and more evenly secondly
skewered dishes cooked in the vertical

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:47.580
stove taste better than kebabs cooked
on traditional grills regular kebabs

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.800
drip fat on the coals causing it to
taste and smells slightly burned while

00:14:52.800 --> 00:15:04.020
kebab dishes cooked in vertical stoves
do not drip fat on fire but rather self -basting which enhances their own taste
when I cooked my skewered spiraled

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:09.839
potato dish the seasoning fat ran down
the potato as it cooked basting it with

00:15:09.839 --> 00:15:16.970
meaty taste I don't think I can go back
to traditional horizontal grilling a

00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:22.830
more detailed instruction on how to make
a vertical stove and prepare food in it

00:15:22.830 --> 00:15:27.959
