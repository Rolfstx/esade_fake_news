00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:16.449
I JUST HAD THE WEIRDEST DREAM.

00:00:16.482 --> 00:00:17.884 align:start position:0%
I WAS FULLY CLOTHED.

FOLKS, IF YOU WATCH THE SHOW
EVERY NIGHT-- AND I HOPE YOU

00:00:26.058 --> 00:00:29.128
DO-- YOU KNOW THAT LAST NIGHT,
MY GUEST WAS NEW YORK SENATOR

00:00:29.161 --> 00:00:32.365
CHUCK SCHUMER, SEEN HERE TRYING
TO REMEMBER THE LAST PLACE HE

00:00:32.398 --> 00:00:33.499 align:start position:0%
SAW HIS GLASSES.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.002 align:start position:0%
WELL, YOU KNOW WHO ELSE WATCHED
HIM ON "THE LATE SHOW?"

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:37.170 align:start position:0%
DONALD TRUMP.

00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:41.741 align:start position:0%
TODAY, HE TALKED ABOUT IT ON THE
RADIO SHOW OF CONSERVATIVE

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:46.179
COMMENTATOR AND LIVING CAN OF
PROTEIN POWDER, DAN BONGINO.

00:00:46.212 --> 00:00:56.222
AND-- SPOILER-- THE PRESIDENT
WASN'T IMPRESSED WITH SCHUMER.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:01:06.566
AND-- SPOILER-- THE PRESIDENT
WASN'T IMPRESSED WITH SCHUMER.

&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, MY GOD!

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:12.038 align:start position:0%
DONALD TRUMP WATCHED MY
INTERVIEW!

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:16.008
MR. PRESIDENT, I KNOW YOU MAY
NOT HAVE LIKED SENATOR SCHUMER,

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:17.777 align:start position:0%
BUT YOU SHOULD CHECK OUT MY
MONOLOGUE.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.946 align:start position:0%
I SAY YOUR NAME A LOT.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.681 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE KIND OF THE STAR-- IN
THAT, YOU'RE SLOWLY EXPANDING TO

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.850 align:start position:0%
DESTROY ALL OF US.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:27.220 align:start position:0%
WHO AM I KIDDING?

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:35.661 align:start position:0%
HE WASN'T THRILLED WITH ME,
EITHER.

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:43.736 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: MR. PRESIDENT, I
HAVE SOME TERRIBLE NEWS.

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.104
AND IT'S NOT THAT JOHNNY'S DEAD.

00:01:45.137 --> 00:01:48.207 align:start position:0%
IT'S THAT HE THOUGHT YOU WERE A
JOKE, TOO.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.709 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY ABOUT GENNIFER
FLOWERS.

00:01:49.742 --> 00:01:53.312 align:start position:0%
SHE GOT FIRED.

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:57.216 align:start position:0%
BUT SHE GOT A NEW JOB TODAY AS A
DONALD TRUMP BACKUP MISTRESS.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.420 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HELLO!

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:04.824 align:start position:0%
ALSO, I'LL TELL YOU HOW I MAKE
MONEY.

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:08.294 size:88% position:44%
I DON'T BANKRUPT MY CASINOS.

00:02:08.327 --> 00:02:09.695
NOW, OF COURSE, I'M IN THE MEAT
IN A TWITTER FIGHT SANDWICH,

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:15.201 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE TRUMP ALSO TWEETED
ABOUT IT AND SCHUMER RESPONDED:

00:02:15.234 --> 00:02:16.769 align:start position:0%
"I'M GLAD TO SEE PRESIDENT TRUMP
IS WATCHING STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:02:16.802 --> 00:02:19.972
MAYBE HE'LL LEARN SOMETHING."

00:02:20.005 --> 00:02:21.774 align:start position:0%
I DO HAVE A LOT TO TEACH THE
PRESIDENT.

00:02:21.807 --> 00:02:24.143 align:start position:0%
FOR EXAMPLE, I ALSO RAN FOR
PRESIDENT.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:27.046 align:start position:0%
BUT UNLIKE TRUMP, I KNEW IT WAS
A JOKE.
