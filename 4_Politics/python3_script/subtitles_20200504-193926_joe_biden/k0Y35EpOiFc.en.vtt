00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.527
- When I answered the
phone, they were like,

00:00:01.527 --> 00:00:05.100
"You applied for the job,"
and I'm like, "I did, I did."

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.160
Well, let's see where this goes,

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.537
but I didn't know nothing
about policing, nothing,

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:10.608
except when I got
arrested when I was eight.

00:00:10.608 --> 00:00:13.025
(soft music)

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.620
- Hey, I'm Dave Rubin,
and just a quick reminder

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.740
to subscribe to the
channel and click the bell

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.420
so that you actually see our videos,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.360
a pretty novel idea, I know.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.260
All right, more importantly,
joining me today

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.100
is a former Arizona police
officer and now the co-founder

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.650
of the Blexit movement, Brandon Tatum.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.870
Welcome to the Rubin Report.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.860
- Hey, thanks for having me,
and I'm excited to be here.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.747
- I'm glad to have you here.

00:00:34.747 --> 00:00:37.320
You do realize that your
shirt is gonna trigger

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.870
an awful lotta people on the Internet.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.536
- Well, I'm hoping so, I'm hoping so.

00:00:41.536 --> 00:00:42.920
(Dave laughs)
I mean, I don't see why.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.100
We live in America, people
should love the flag,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.340
they should love the
concept of America first.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.490
So if they're triggered,
that's their fault.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.870
- You must feel very
comfortable in my studio.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.230
I've got a flag over there.
- Oh, yeah.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.600
Big American flag over
there, Constitution,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.565
Declaration of Independence,
so we're off to a good start.

00:00:57.565 --> 00:00:58.658
- Cool, hope so.

00:00:58.658 --> 00:00:59.491
- All right, there's a lot of stuff

00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:00.324
I want to talk to you about,

00:01:00.324 --> 00:01:01.930
and I've wanted to have
you in here for a while.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.680
So first off, for people that know

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.730
absolutely nothing about you,

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.410
I don't know anything about
your childhood upbringing,

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:10.560
family life, that kind of stuff,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.850
before we get into law enforcement

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.860
and Blexit and the rest of it.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.910
- Okay, well, I grew up
in Fort Worth, Texas.

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.480
I'm a Texas boy, a Cowboy fan
by default, I like to say.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.210
I mean, they're doing good
this year, so I like 'em.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.184
- [Dave] Yeah, legally you
have to be a Cowboy fan, yeah.

00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:24.017
- Yeah, I have to be.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:26.690
My dad is a Cowboy fan, he
used to work at the stadium,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.000
so I'm, I guess, thrusted
into the atmosphere

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.893
of Cowboy nation, but I grew
up in Fort Worth, Texas.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.050
My parents were split my whole life,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.293
all that I can remember,

00:01:39.418 --> 00:01:40.913
and it was slightly an adversity, right?

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:43.720
Because we had my dad,
his dad wasn't around,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.040
my mom, her dad wasn't around.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.710
My grandmother uniquely
enough had my mother

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.410
at 12 years old.
- Wow.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.320
- She was raped and she had my mom at 12.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.090
So that was kind of the foundational idea

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.000
of kinda how me and my brother was raised.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.320
Both really parents were
really good parents.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.230
My dad is a firefighter,
he's actually a chief.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.453
So I grew up in a very diverse background,

00:02:06.377 --> 00:02:08.550
'cause we had a lot of my
mom's side of the family

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.650
what I would say was
poor, uneducated, poor.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.370
High school graduation
was like going to college

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.570
on my mom's side of the family.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.410
A few of my family members
are doing life in prison.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.350
So I come from a diverse
type of a atmosphere.

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.750
You have the good, the bad.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.550
My dad did a wonderful job raising us.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.870
We lived with both my mom and dad.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.690
Went to different schools,
private schools, public schools,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.680
but my high school was Dunbar High School,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.750
Paul Laurence Dunbar High School,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.500
named after the famous black
poet Paul Laurence Dunbar.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.340
It was violent, man, it was violent.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.350
People pulling guns on each
other in the parking lot,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.950
fights, I mean, people
come off the streets

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.410
fighting in the school.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.000
But what it did do, it
presented a atmosphere

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.980
where we can excel in athletics.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.000
Like I said, let me go
back to when I was eight,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.860
because that was one of the
pivotal points in my life.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.360
At eight years old, I got
arrested for smoking marijuana.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.827
- At eight years old.
- In a vacant house.

00:03:02.827 --> 00:03:05.530
And eight is when I
stopped smoking marijuana.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.010
When I was seven, we
used to smoke marijuana

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.610
with my cousins.
- Geeze.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.573
- When I say marijuana for people

00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:11.990
that know about smoking weed,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.300
we weren't smoking joints,
we were smoking blunts.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.480
My older cousins would go buy weed,

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.610
and then we'll come
together and we'll smoke it.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.690
My parents had no idea what we were doing,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.230
until we got busted that
time when I was eight

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.759
and my brother was 10.
- Geeze.

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:27.490
I mean, I can't even imagine

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.760
the mind of an
eight-year-old smoking weed.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.310
- My son is nine, he just turned nine,

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.520
and I couldn't imagine him picking up weed

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.260
and smoking it like we were.
- Geeze.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.890
- We were also-
- Wait, so you busted.

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:38.723
What happened?

00:03:38.723 --> 00:03:41.010
- Well, we got busted in a vacant house.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.710
I mean, they came in like a SWAT team.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:46.220
They pulled guns on us and everything.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.660
They put us in a squad car, we
went to the detention center,

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.410
and we initially thought
that they were gonna call

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.000
my cousins' parents, because
their parents really...

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.833
They didn't care much, man.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:55.200
We weren't gonna get in trouble.

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.280
We were never gonna tell my
dad, it was gonna go away.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.960
But for some reason, they
called Mr. Tatum there,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.020
and my dad is a strong man,

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.853
and he came in there like
he was ready to fight.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.121
He came in there, "I'm gonna
kill 'em, I'm gonna kill 'em."

00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:12.667
I was telling my brother, I was like,

00:04:12.667 --> 00:04:14.241
"I hope they leave us in here, man,

00:04:14.241 --> 00:04:16.360
"because we're about to get
the whooping of a lifetime."

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.100
But the thing that I love that my dad did,

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.340
and it really changed my life,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.140
is that we didn't get a
whooping, he didn't whoop us.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.267
He sat me down, on the ride
home he sat me down and said,

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.727
"Look, Brandon, if you
don't act with integrity

00:04:30.727 --> 00:04:31.867
"and you don't change your ways,

00:04:31.867 --> 00:04:33.590
"you will never play in the NBA."

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.950
'Cause at the time I wanted
to be like Michael Jordan.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.890
I mean, that hurt me more
than any whooping could,

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.520
and it kinda set me on
a path of feeling like,

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.270
you know, I need to do better man.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.020
I love my cousins, but we can't
hang out with them no more

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.010
and get intro trouble that'll end up

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.920
causing me to lose my future.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.140
- More importantly than anything else,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.470
how are your basketball skills now?

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.680
- Oh, trash, I'm trash at
basketball, I hate to say it.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.590
I know stereotypically
I'm supposed to be good.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.710
- Oh, so this was the eight-year-old dream

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:59.895
of being Michael Jordan, right?

00:04:59.895 --> 00:05:00.989
- This is the eight-year-old dream.

00:05:00.989 --> 00:05:02.900
The dream died when I
couldn't dribble with my left

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.173
and I couldn't shoot from the
three-point, that dream died.

00:05:06.394 --> 00:05:07.280
- All right, well, I was actually

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.740
gonna do some of this stuff later,

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.030
but so this obviously
relates to the black family,

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.170
and every time anyone talks about this,

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.720
if you're white let's say,
well, they're gonna immediately

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.510
say you're racist for
even bringing this up,

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:22.280
and yet I hear this
sort of story so often,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.740
that what is happening to the black family

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.200
or what has happened in say
the last couple of decades

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.513
is sort of the root of the problem here.

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:33.900
Do you think that's fair to say?

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.640
- 100%.
- And how did your dad,

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:37.570
how did your dad not succumb to that?

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.130
- Well, 100% I think it's
the root of the problems.

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.340
When you're a young man, you
growing up with no direction.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:44.990
Where do you go, who do you look to?

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.230
You gotta look to people
that are influential males

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.440
in the community and
they didn't have a dad.

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.620
So you have kind of a matriculation

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.150
of this fatherless home issue going on

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:56.760
and people trying to be fathers

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.970
without having examples
of what a real father is,

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:00.880
so now you're going to gang
members and other dudes,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.450
like our cousins, and we didn't have to

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.150
'cause we had a strong
dad, which helped us,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.170
but you still wanna be
like your big cousins,

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.490
'cause they're cool and it's kinda trendy

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:10.323
what they're doing,

00:06:10.323 --> 00:06:13.000
and it leads young men
down the wrong path.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.910
But unfortunately, and I
guess fortunately for me,

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:17.310
my father was a strong man,

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.890
and I think that him not
having his dad around

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:23.850
really made him feel like,
"I need to do better."

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.500
And my dad obviously had
a little bit of training

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.170
being a father because
he had to help take care

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.290
of his younger brothers.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.510
And so my dad probably
always had that in him,

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.900
but him being a strong man,
him standing on principles,

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.000
really saved us, I'm not gonna lie.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.400
My mom is great, my mom was
way more lenient than my dad.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.760
My mom was the cool mom,

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.440
you know what I mean?
- Right. (chuckles)

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:45.710
- And I hate to say it, we
kinda took advantage of that.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.830
Me and my brother didn't have
as much respect for my mom

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.210
as we did my father.

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:52.510
He was strict, no cussing in the house.

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.790
Back in the day we had no cell phones,

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.540
he'd pick the phone up while
you're talking to somebody

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.540
on the phone and be like,
"It's time to go to bed,"

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.440
and hang the phone up on you.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.570
So it was really beneficial,
and if I didn't have my dad,

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.570
I would not be here today.

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.520
- Why do you think it's so
hard to talk about that?

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:10.180
So for example, my parents
have been married 44 years now

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.210
with ups and downs, and good
and bad, and all that stuff,

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.620
but they still live in the
house that I grew up in,

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.340
and I know that the roots of that

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.100
give you some stability in life.

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.320
It doesn't make you perfect.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.060
You're still gonna make
mistakes and all those things,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.380
but it gives you some sense
of a consistency in the world.

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.730
It's so obviously something
that we should all want

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:32.150
or aspire, not to say you
can't if you don't have that,

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.040
you're gonna be awful
or something like that.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.490
But why do you think it's
so hard to talk about this?

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.190
- Because when you start to dis,

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:42.530
or people take it as a dis to
the fabric of who they are,

00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:46.780
the cultural identity, people
get offended by it, right?

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.850
It's hard for humans, for people,

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.660
to take responsibility
for their own action.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.960
It's very difficult, so
people like to divert.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.380
In the black community,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.800
culture is what's really
destroying us, right?

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.070
I mean, it's culturally
acceptable more now

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:04.650
than it was, I don't know,
in the '40s, '50s, '60s,

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.950
for you to be in a single-parent home.

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.200
Back in the day, that's unheard of.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.680
Back in the day, having a family structure

00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.890
was all we depended on
as black people to build.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.770
We understood the value of it.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.680
- It wasn't until I think
late '60s or early '70s,

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.810
I think early '70s when that flipped.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:26.810
- It began to flip, and now
it's cool to be on your own

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:29.800
and do your thing as a young man.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.273
Listen to the music that
most of us listen to.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.420
Banging a few girls here and
there, it make you a man,

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.880
you cool, you popular.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.890
You don't have to stay
around with a woman.

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.960
You can hit it, have a kid outta wedlock.

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.440
Most of the dudes that's rapping,

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:47.380
most of the potential leaders,
are doing the same thing.

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.440
So I think we've been set
off on the wrong path,

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.410
and when you're confronted
with those issues,

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.207
instead of internalizing and say,

00:08:55.207 --> 00:08:57.820
"Look, this is our fault, we
need to get back to this."

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:59.460
Why are we not marrying these women

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.530
that we're having kids with?

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.300
Why are women not having
the expectation to date

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:07.530
and to be with a man who's
stable, who can provide for them?

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.860
Not somebody that can provide
for them for one night,

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.833
not somebody that can provide
flashiness, but stability.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:18.530
Also in the culture, stability
is almost viewed upon

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:20.010
like you're acting white.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:23.130
When I was growing up and
you would do well in school,

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.357
people would say, "Well,
you're trying to be

00:09:24.357 --> 00:09:26.040
"like the white man."

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.070
If you wanna have your
pants like it's supposed to,

00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.017
tuck your shirt in and say,
"I'm gonna marry women,

00:09:31.017 --> 00:09:32.800
"I'm not gonna disrespect women,"

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.760
I'm telling you, I don't know how it is

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.170
in every high school around the world

00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:39.400
in the black community,
but I know how mine was,

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.320
and you were getting shunned.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.540
I remember we had some
guys who were virgins

00:09:44.540 --> 00:09:48.580
in high school and in college,
I mean, you'd get bullied.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:50.980
There's something wrong with
you if you're not having sex.

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.550
That's cultural, man, and I
feel like if that changed,

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.090
we may be able to return back to saying

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.560
let's value our women,
let's value relationships.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:01.060
- It's so interesting the
way the media uses cultural

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.010
sort of against everybody.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.760
Do you see just in the
last couple of days,

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.260
there was this piece in Vox

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:09.760
about how Andrew Yang should
stop using toxic terms

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.800
like math and that people
should become doctors,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.080
because those are associated
with the Asian community,

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.380
except those are the things
we should all aspire for

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:19.960
and they're trying to make them toxic.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:23.030
And that's the reverse of
what you're laying out there.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:27.600
- Yeah, exactly, and that's
what my goal is in life,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.810
is to give young brothers
a different perspective.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.970
Now don't get me wrong, I
used to be sagging my pants,

00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:34.430
I had gold teeth in my mouth,

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.410
I got young savage
tattooed across my stomach,

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.130
I got my hood tattooed on my forearms,

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.579
so I understand what it's
like to be involved in that.

00:10:41.579 --> 00:10:42.412
I understand what it's like

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:44.160
to wanna be a part of that culture,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.270
but I also understand
what it's like to change.

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.370
It took me finding God
to really take that step

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:51.820
and change in a different direction,

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:55.110
and I realized, man, this
is the way things should be.

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.660
We shouldn't be ashamed to be like this.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:58.210
- When was your spiritual awakening?

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.590
- In 2008, I'll never
forget it, I was in college.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.830
I had fun in college my
first couple of years,

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:06.930
but I had a terrible attitude.

00:11:06.930 --> 00:11:08.970
We couldn't sit across from each other

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:11.810
because we would have probably never met.

00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:15.153
Any time I felt offended by
somebody, I'm ready to fight,

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.510
which was the detriment of
my college career in football

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.400
because the coaches yell at
me and now I wanna fight 'em.

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.490
I didn't know how to
handle my emotions well,

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.150
and I didn't care.

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:27.569
Cursed every word outta my mouth,

00:11:27.569 --> 00:11:29.753
and a lotta things I
really didn't care about

00:11:29.753 --> 00:11:31.640
that I care about now.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:35.130
Race was very different
to me before I got saved.

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:37.630
I saw black and white very clearly.

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:39.160
I took Africana studies in college,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.240
and there was a period of time

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.360
where I hated white people, I did.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.270
I felt so offended by what
they did to my ancestors,

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:47.780
from the things they taught us in college.

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:48.613
- Oh yeah, so I was gonna ask you,

00:11:48.613 --> 00:11:50.850
so do you think that was the
intention of the classes,

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:54.086
because this goes across
all the social sciences now.

00:11:54.086 --> 00:11:54.919
- You know, I'm not sure back then.

00:11:54.919 --> 00:11:56.640
I didn't feel what I feel today.

00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.790
Back when I went to the classes,

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.800
I felt like that they were just teaching,

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.230
and of course there's gonna
be a level of bias, right?

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.500
If this is your perspective,
you have the freedom

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:06.400
to teach kinda in the direction you want.

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:11.400
I didn't see them
over-propagandizing certain things.

00:12:11.423 --> 00:12:13.160
When I go to colleges and speak now,

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.940
it is clear that they're
trying to intentionally

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.710
brainwash people into
believing a certain thing.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.463
I had a young guy reach out to me,

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.190
the books that were
required was a book saying,

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:26.960
it was like anti-white man,

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.210
why the black man is being oppressed.

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:31.460
I mean, I didn't have
those books growing up,

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:33.640
or at least being in college.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.367
- Go get a job after you've learned that.

00:12:35.367 --> 00:12:37.070
What do you do, what is the purpose of it?

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.950
- How can you exist in an environment

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:40.070
where you hate white people,

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.270
but you're only 13% of the population?

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:43.980
How can you exist in that environment?

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.650
You're gonna find yourself

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.070
hating almost everybody you're around.

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:51.180
You're gonna find
yourself screwing yourself

00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:53.230
outta opportunities,
because if you're looking

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:55.170
at your boss as the enemy,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.620
are you gonna perform well in your job?

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:00.610
Are you gonna be more
willing to try new things

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.400
or go up in the ranks?

00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.610
Are you gonna have I guess the spirit

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:08.450
for you to visualize
success when all you think

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:11.400
is that you're being
oppressed by the white man?

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.050
So some of that was in me growing up.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:16.930
I grew up in an all-black community.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:18.740
I never dated a white girl.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.260
It was shunned in my community.

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.308
Growing up, you date a white woman,

00:13:22.308 --> 00:13:25.270
you're gonna get bullied, you a sellout.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.930
So I had none of that exposure.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:29.920
Never was really around
white people consistently,

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.960
mostly around black people.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:33.020
Everything in my life was Afro-centric.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.350
I got to college and
my eyes were opened up

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:39.070
to a certain degree because
now everybody's white,

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:40.920
and it's like 35 of us.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.510
You know, it was a little more than that,

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.670
but probably about a couple a hundred,

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.600
but most of us were athletes.

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.710
And so I began to see white people

00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.100
aren't as evil as I thought they were.

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.330
- So they weren't hunting
you down on campus.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.580
- They weren't hunting us down.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:58.427
You could go eat with white
people and nobody would be...

00:13:58.427 --> 00:13:59.260
There would be no controversy.
- So you could.

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:00.670
You were eating with white people.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:01.930
- Eating with white people.
- Incredible.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.268
- It's probably enough.

00:14:03.268 --> 00:14:04.600
(Dave laughing)

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.870
But growing up, you
thought there was gonna be

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.640
a lotta animosity, like, oh,
they mad, 'cause we in college.

00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:12.120
You know, I'm telling
you, this is a real thing

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.422
when you're like--

00:14:13.422 --> 00:14:14.255
- What was that like though really?

00:14:14.255 --> 00:14:15.840
Like it sounds silly,
eating with white people,

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.160
no one's hunting you
down, but that transition,

00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:20.030
as you were starting to realize it,

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:23.820
to break the old mold of
thinking, how hard is that?

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.400
For me, man, I'm a very stubborn person,

00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:27.810
but I'm a logical person.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.120
If I can see a logical
example of truth and reality,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.690
then it's easy to convert me.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:34.550
If you can't show me that,

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:36.300
I'll be stubborn to the day I die.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.520
But it was really eye-opening for me, man,

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.510
because I perceived that people

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:41.800
were gonna treat me differently,

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.230
I perceived that people
were gonna be shocked

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.750
at black folks going to
college and we're successful.

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:47.670
And it wasn't at all,
white people didn't care.

00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:49.550
You know what I'm saying?

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:51.190
And then I started to meet white friends,

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:54.270
and I'm like, man, everybody's
essentially the same.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.970
There's like two people in this world,

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.390
real people and fake people.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:14:58.990
They come in different colors.

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:00.630
And that began to change in me,

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:02.580
and then like I said, when I got saved,

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:05.850
it's like God imparted in my heart

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:07.510
that we're all the same, man.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:10.250
- So what was that
spiritual wake-up moment?

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:12.100
- Well, it was a lead up to it, right?

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.640
I mean, football wasn't going well for me.

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:16.270
I had been going to church growing up.

00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.110
We were in church, but
church wasn't in us, right?

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.900
We got to church and we
leave, we listen to rap music

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:23.110
and doing all that kind of other stuff,

00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:24.810
we didn't pray, we didn't read the Bible,

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:28.700
so that's kind of lukewarm
Christian upbringing.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:31.290
And when I got to college,
things weren't going well.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:33.630
Then I went, I said,
man, let me try God out.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:35.830
I was really gonna rule God out.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:37.590
I said let me see if this is real, man,

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.910
because I'm at a point in my life

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.630
where it's kind of a turning point.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.030
I wanna figure out who I am,
football is not going well,

00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:46.900
I thought it was gonna
be my life moving forward

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.170
and it's not happening,
and I'm in a position

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.470
where I don't know where to go.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.960
Let me rule this God thing out,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.410
and then I can go from there.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:56.870
I was having visions and stuff of God,

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.850
Jesus visited me in one of
my dreams, like in a vision.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:01.410
And I went to a church,

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:04.340
I got invited to Emmanuel
Grace Apostolic Church.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:05.330
I'll never forget that church.

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.150
And it just turned my life around.

00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:09.360
One day I went up to the front,

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.290
I had a friend with me and she
was crying at the altar call.

00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:16.013
She's crying and she wanted to find God,

00:16:16.901 --> 00:16:18.140
and in my mind, I'm like
I'm gonna take her up there

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:18.973
'cause she's too scared.

00:16:18.973 --> 00:16:21.420
Let me take her to get her
someone to pray for her,

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.780
'cause they pray for you at the front.

00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.270
And when I went up there, I
ended up getting prayed for.

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:28.370
And then I found myself getting baptized,

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.260
and God really just changed
me, man, completely.

00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:33.840
I'm talking about it
was a complete change.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.110
I went from cursing every day to never...

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.310
Well, I ain't saying never cursing again,

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:39.860
but a period of time I
never said a curse word.

00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:41.630
Now sometimes people make me mad,

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:44.400
I may not say it on the TV,
but sometimes I do curse.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.170
But I didn't curse,

00:16:46.170 --> 00:16:48.730
I stopped listening to
rap music completely,

00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:51.750
and my perspective of life
just completely changed.

00:16:51.750 --> 00:16:53.510
I saw everybody the same.

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.990
It was no more black and
white, this racist stuff.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:58.591
It was like, you know
what, God created us all.

00:16:58.591 --> 00:17:00.995
We're all brothers and sisters in God,

00:17:00.995 --> 00:17:02.830
and we just have different
melanin in our skin.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:03.900
- This is kind of a sidebar,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.300
but do you think people can have a shift,

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:08.770
like such a fundamental
shift like that, without God?

00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:11.007
Do you think there's a
way that some people can

00:17:11.007 --> 00:17:13.680
and some people maybe are more wired

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.460
to need belief or something like that?

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.710
- Well, I think that
people can have a level,

00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:21.760
a shift to a certain level, right?

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:25.460
I think God is the ultimate
shift, because I think it's more

00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:30.090
than just what the human I
guess nature can do to change.

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:32.330
The things that changed in me

00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:34.630
were supernatural, in my opinion.

00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.020
I can't explain it, I can't explain how,

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.910
I can't explain why it happened.

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.340
I just know that the
experience I had at church

00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:43.833
and how my mind completely changed.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.090
It was like instantaneous.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.420
When I got baptized and
I went down in the water

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.437
and I came up, I remember
telling my friend,

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:53.907
"I just feel lighter, I don't
know what happened to me.

00:17:53.907 --> 00:17:55.457
"Something has happened to me."

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.820
I didn't read through the Bible,

00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:00.237
so I didn't understand the
significance of all of it,

00:18:00.237 --> 00:18:02.250
but I understand that I needed to do it,

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.820
I understood a parcel of it,

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.300
but I didn't understand
the significance of it

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:09.137
until I read the Bible and I said,

00:18:09.137 --> 00:18:11.030
"That's what happened to me."

00:18:11.030 --> 00:18:15.420
Now I see, and now I understand
that the power of God

00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.570
can really change you to a level

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:21.410
that you couldn't get to
on your own, in my opinion,

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:26.150
like a endurance sustainable
level, if that makes any sense.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:28.774
It's like more of an endurance to it,

00:18:28.774 --> 00:18:31.794
to the end of time you can
really tap into something

00:18:31.794 --> 00:18:33.020
that's just supernatural.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.153
And I see it being so
when you read the Bible.

00:18:37.584 --> 00:18:39.330
You read through thousands of years

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:42.740
of hundreds of people having interactions

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:44.230
that never met each other.

00:18:44.230 --> 00:18:46.700
Very similar situations,
they never met each other,

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.720
they lived in different
dispensations of time,

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.060
different parts of different countries,

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:53.630
and they had the same
experience that I had in 2008.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.250
And it just made me feel like
there's something to this.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.160
There's something to it.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.000
- So you have this awakening,

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.460
and then you get outta college.

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.910
Did you immediately go
into law enforcement?

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:05.280
- No, no, no, 2008, I
had a few more years.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.340
I graduated in 2009, I
left football in 2010,

00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.810
so I graduated early,
so then my life changed.

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:14.950
My career changed, I was a
good guy on the football team,

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:18.230
I was a leader, things
began to transition for me.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:20.850
I started getting heavily
into church, things like that.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:23.320
I would witness on
campus, all of the above.

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.800
So with that mentality, that new mindset,

00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:28.720
more of a tempered behavior,

00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.500
I was taking the gold
teeth out of my mouth,

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.110
all of the above.

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:35.493
I get to the end of my college career,

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.130
NFL draft, I didn't get drafted.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:41.960
It was heartbreaking, I
mean, I was devastated.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.309
And there were some reasons behind that.

00:19:43.309 --> 00:19:44.740
I mean, it'll take me
all day to explain it,

00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.280
but my career didn't go
the way I wanted it to.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.300
- What percentage were you
looking at that morning?

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.250
Were you 90% I'm gonna get drafted?

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.540
- I was 100% I was gonna get drafted

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.430
because my agent had talked
to the Oakland Raiders

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:56.847
at the time and they said to my agent,

00:19:56.847 --> 00:19:59.027
"We're gonna draft him in
the sixth or seventh round.

00:19:59.027 --> 00:20:01.740
"He's gonna be the only
safety that we draft."

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.320
Because of my athletic ability,
I didn't play much at all

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.640
at Arizona, but I was
All-American in high school.

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.790
I was one of the top
players in the nation.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.800
I was what you'd consider a freak athlete.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:14.470
And so because of that athleticism,

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.400
even though I didn't play at all,

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.840
the Oakland Raiders still was
thinking about drafting me.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:20.050
They told him they were gonna draft me,

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:22.240
we had a draft party,
it was on my birthday.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.073
- [Dave] (groans) Oh, man.

00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:25.494
- I mean, I'd been praying about this,

00:20:25.494 --> 00:20:28.450
and I said God is gonna make it happen.

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:31.037
And draft day came, he called me, he said,

00:20:31.037 --> 00:20:32.347
"Hey, they're making some changes,

00:20:32.347 --> 00:20:33.620
"I don't know what they're doing."

00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:34.910
They didn't draft me.

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.090
Come to find out they didn't draft me

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.220
because the college coach

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.200
that they went and talked
to right before the draft,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.420
he bad-mouthed me and
talked really bad about me,

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.200
and so my agent told me that
that's why I they passed on me.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.320
They didn't wanna take a chance with me,

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.760
given the circumstances.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:49.453
So I was hurt, man, I was devastated.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:51.613
But I met a guy.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.510
He was a tremendous
mentor to me, tremendous.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:58.430
The guy, very successful, millionaire.

00:20:58.430 --> 00:21:00.860
I'll give you his first name was John.

00:21:00.860 --> 00:21:02.250
I don't know if he's comfortable

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:03.190
with me giving his full name,

00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:07.690
but this guy was a
entrepreneur CEO of a major...

00:21:09.668 --> 00:21:11.240
It was like a worldwide
company that he owned,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:13.370
had his own private jet,
all of these things.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:16.530
And his daughter played volleyball
with me and my son's mom.

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:17.730
I think I can say to go back,

00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:20.420
me and her and end up having
a child at some point.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:23.520
But his daughter played with my son's mom,

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.150
and that's how he met me.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:27.930
And so he mentored me through the process,

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.180
and he told me something that was pivotal,

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.610
just like my dad telling
me that in the car.

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:35.540
He told me, he said,
"Brandon, you pursue football

00:21:36.407 --> 00:21:38.827
"as much as you can with
everything you have,

00:21:38.827 --> 00:21:41.267
"and at the moment in which
it's not yielding any results,

00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:43.820
"you need to put an X on
the calendar and move on."

00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:47.140
And I tried it out for another year,

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.580
I said, man, this is not doing anything.

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:49.890
I put a X on the calendar

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.120
while I was applying for
the police department.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.533
So let me go back, because
there's some things missing here.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:02.090
During my college career,
I met a young lady

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.390
and we had a kid together.

00:22:04.650 --> 00:22:07.160
We weren't married, so we
had a kid outta wedlock,

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.040
which was a whole story in and of itself,

00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.460
because I was in the
church, I was in the choir,

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.300
and I had to sit out the choir.

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.860
It was a lot of things
that happened in the church

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:16.800
because of this.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.290
I think it's important to say.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:24.830
So we had a kid and we were having a son,

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.950
me and her was on two
different pages, right?

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.380
I was into the church, we made a mistake,

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.480
but I didn't believe in abortion.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.333
She on the other hand was pro-abortion.

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:39.400
And I remember we had a
conversation about it.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.240
She told me, "Look, I just
wanna see how far along I am,"

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.070
and that was our communication.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.940
I went to Planned Parenthood with her.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:48.810
At the time, I didn't know
what Planned Parenthood was.

00:22:48.810 --> 00:22:51.290
I thought it was a little
clinic for women, whatever.

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.530
Now I know it's a little bit
of different perspective,

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:55.600
but at the time I didn't know.

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:59.790
I went with her to see
how far along she was.

00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:01.967
At the front door of
the facility, she said,

00:23:01.967 --> 00:23:04.360
"I want you to know I'm
having an abortion."

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.610
And I was hurt, man, I was hurt.

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.230
People don't think that men matter

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.580
in these women choice
situations, but they do.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.450
That's my child.

00:23:12.450 --> 00:23:14.106
- So she was gonna do it regardless--

00:23:14.106 --> 00:23:14.939
- She was gonna do it,
she didn't even tell me.

00:23:14.939 --> 00:23:16.000
- Regardless of what they were gonna say

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.510
related to timing or whatever.

00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:19.410
- Right, she didn't tell me nothing.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:21.030
She had already orchestrated the thing,

00:23:21.030 --> 00:23:23.320
but she waited till the
front door to tell me.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.200
I sat in the lobby and I prayed,

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.777
and I said, "God, please
don't let her do this.

00:23:28.777 --> 00:23:31.107
"Please, this is my son.

00:23:31.107 --> 00:23:35.047
"I know we made a
mistake with fornication,

00:23:35.047 --> 00:23:37.197
"but I don't believe
in making two mistakes.

00:23:37.197 --> 00:23:38.900
"I don't believe in this."

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:42.330
And I prayed in there for
I don't know how long.

00:23:42.330 --> 00:23:44.020
I leave, I get back in the car.

00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.390
Maybe like an hour and a half later,

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:47.920
she comes outta there crying profusely,

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.490
and I thought she did it.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:51.677
And I said, I was hurt, but I said

00:23:51.677 --> 00:23:53.800
she just went through a difficult thing,

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.150
I'll try to support her emotionally.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:23:58.300
She came to the car and
she cried and she cried,

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:00.120
and she goes, "I couldn't do it."

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:01.840
- Wow.
- "I couldn't do it."

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.549
I gotta give her kudos 'cause
my son is nine years old now

00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:06.190
(Dave chuckles)

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.257
So that situation happened,

00:24:08.257 --> 00:24:11.420
and I thought it was pertinent
to kinda bring it up.

00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.460
So fast forward to the
end of my college career,

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:16.420
the football thing, she was pregnant,

00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:18.740
and she was getting ready to have our son

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.200
or she was close to having
our son at the time.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.810
Then I have to make a decision,

00:24:22.810 --> 00:24:24.080
put the X on the calendar for football,

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.913
and go to something else

00:24:24.913 --> 00:24:26.610
'cause I need something more sustainable.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:28.380
I apply for everything
in the city of Tucson,

00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:31.740
I had a degree, I got hundreds of no's.

00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:35.060
One day they called me, and
it was after an argument

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.420
that me and her had obviously,

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.540
so we had just argued briefly on the phone

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:40.130
about the engagement ring
or something like that,

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:42.240
nothing major, and I tell this story

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.890
because it's always funny
to me how this happened.

00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:47.070
We had a little argument the night before,

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.110
wake up the next morning,

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:50.400
and I get a phone call from
the Tucson Police Department.

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.480
And initially I thought she
had called me the police on me,

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:53.400
like she was mad at me.

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.787
I'm like, "Why would she
call the police on me

00:24:55.787 --> 00:24:56.937
"on a basic argument like this.

00:24:56.937 --> 00:24:58.400
"She want me to go to jail?"

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.307
But when I answered the
phone, they were like,

00:25:00.307 --> 00:25:03.307
"You applied for the job,"
and I'm like, "I did, I did."

00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:05.085
Well, let's see where this goes,

00:25:05.085 --> 00:25:07.337
but I didn't know nothing
about policing, nothing,

00:25:07.337 --> 00:25:09.520
except when I got
arrested when I was eight

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.790
and the agenda that you feel
growing up in a black community

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.110
feeling like the cops are
always out to get you.

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:18.410
And I did a ride-along,
man, and it changed my life.

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:20.550
Officer Sun Pang changed my
life during that ride-along,

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:22.250
and that kinda set my career up.

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.350
- So you become a police officer.

00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:26.651
This is sort of a 180, as you just said,

00:25:26.651 --> 00:25:28.623
from where you started.

00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:33.210
What was the most eye-opening
thing about being an officer?

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:35.810
- It was the idea that I
had no idea what police did,

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:37.580
and I thought I did, right?

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.830
Watching "Cops," listening
to people online,

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.590
I realized that people that
have never put on a badge

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.570
and actually served as a police officer,

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.380
they have very limited
understanding of policing, period.

00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:52.550
I mean, limited to like
10% of an understanding,

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:53.680
even less than that.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.920
If you know somebody that's a police,

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.260
you may have a little
more, but I had no idea.

00:25:58.260 --> 00:25:59.830
Completely a different world,

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:03.150
it's completely a different
job than people know about it,

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.890
emotionally, legally, the training.

00:26:07.890 --> 00:26:10.503
I mean, all of that is
completely different,

00:26:11.715 --> 00:26:14.260
and I got a taste of that,
even after all the training,

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.980
my first arrest was where I was like

00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.180
this is is real, man, this is real.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.800
I really have the power to
take somebody's freedom away,

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.690
and this is not a role player,

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:25.980
what we call them in the academy

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.960
where somebody's faking to be a criminal.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.140
This is a real person with
real emotions, a real life,

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:32.840
and they can really kill you, too.

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.800
That was a pivotal point and
an eye-opening point for me.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:38.633
- What was it like?

00:26:38.633 --> 00:26:40.820
Did you ever go back to the old community

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:42.920
and the guys that were giving you the weed

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.430
as an eight-year-old,
saw you in your uniform?

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.100
- No, growing up in Fort Worth,

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.630
I became a police officer in Tucson.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:49.807
- Right, you weren't, right.

00:26:49.807 --> 00:26:51.730
- But there was remnants of that, right?

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.840
You had a black community in Tucson

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.790
and you arrested people
that looked like people

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:57.623
that you grew up with,

00:26:57.623 --> 00:26:58.740
act like people you grew up with,

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.850
like my cousins and grandma.

00:27:00.850 --> 00:27:05.140
And so dealing with that kinda
give you little flashbacks

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:09.530
of what went on, and I got
to see it from both sides.

00:27:09.530 --> 00:27:11.053
All of that horrible stuff
I thought they did to us

00:27:11.053 --> 00:27:12.670
when we were in a vacant house,

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:14.450
how they treated us and all that stuff,

00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:17.090
I realized that them officers were right.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:18.360
They did what they was supposed to do,

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.930
getting a call of that nature,
not knowing who to expect,

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.210
knowing that we die on a day-to-day basis,

00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:24.833
from calls simply like that.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:31.390
That really, you know, really
opened my understanding to it.

00:27:31.910 --> 00:27:35.470
- What about racism within
the police department, right?

00:27:35.470 --> 00:27:38.040
If you listen to half the media,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.100
police departments are all racist,

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.740
they're looking for racist
ways to incarcerate people.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:45.170
- Yeah, it's the biggest load of crap

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.750
I ever heard in my life,
the biggest load of crap.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:50.900
Police, if people understood
what policing was,

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.300
you would understand that it's rare

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:55.340
for a police officer to
be actually a racist.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.010
Now are there racist people
in a police department?

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:00.380
Yes, there's racist
pastors, I mean, come on,

00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.870
we all know, we all know
that every walk of life,

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:04.280
there's some idiot out there

00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.780
that's still lingering
to hateful rhetoric.

00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:07.810
- But doesn't it drive you crazy

00:28:07.810 --> 00:28:09.590
that you have to qualify
it always with that?

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:10.900
It drives me crazy all the time.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:13.200
Yes, there are homophobes,
there are racists,

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.340
there are bad, mean people.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:17.470
We cannot exterminate all of them.

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:19.640
Thanos could do it,
but basically we can't.

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.473
- Yeah, (laughs) we can't,

00:28:20.473 --> 00:28:21.620
but some people need to know that,

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:22.990
because watching the media every day,

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.100
if you're not a informed person,

00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.280
you're not a person that's a leader

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:27.930
and you can lead with your own thoughts,

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.500
you're a follower, you'll
fall into that stuff.

00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.610
But it's very difficult to be a racist

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:35.470
on a police department, and
one of the biggest reasons why

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:38.210
is because you can't pick who you serve.

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.760
And the least racist people in my opinion

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:41.820
are the white police officers

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.460
that work in the black community,

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.360
because you put your life on the line

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.580
every day for black folks.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.470
You are willing to die for black folks.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:54.070
You have to visually see
and feel the pain and hurt

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:56.760
in the community when brothers
are getting shot every day.

00:28:56.760 --> 00:28:58.410
People don't realize
that police are the ones

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:00.740
gotta put those young
brothers in body bags.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.120
Yeah, I don't care who you are,

00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:05.363
when you see a young man
with his brains hanging out

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:10.160
clinging for life, maybe
even pleading for his life,

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.630
gurgling in blood, the age of your son,

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.800
the age of your nephew, cousin,

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.420
somebody that looks like
your mom, your grandmother,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.550
a young baby that's been
shot through the head

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:23.100
from a drive-by, I don't
care what race you are,

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:24.860
man, it messes with you.

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:28.040
And for people to think
that these white officers

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:30.550
are these cruel evil people

00:29:30.550 --> 00:29:33.320
that don't have any sense of emotions

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.203
or attachment to human life, these people,

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.720
the people that are pushing this rhetoric

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:40.180
are evil and liars.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.400
You put these young people
in body bags every day.

00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:46.080
You go to their mom, grandmother,

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.920
and you look that lady in the face,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.830
trying to hold back your own tears,

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.110
because you can only
imagine losing your son.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:54.100
Some of these women have
lost all of their children

00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.350
to gang violence, and you
gotta look her in the eye

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.660
and you gotta be strong
for her and everybody else,

00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:02.220
and say, "I'm sorry, but
he's never coming back."

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:06.920
And that's what people
don't understand happens.

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:11.100
And I also believe that
it's racist, in my opinion,

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.140
to make the projection that white officers

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.340
are targeting black
people in the community.

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:21.090
One of the main reasons is
that you would have to assume

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:22.890
that all black people are bad.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.340
Think about this for a minute.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.620
If officers are afraid of black people,

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:28.713
that means that all of
them are doing something

00:30:28.713 --> 00:30:30.690
that will lead officers
to be afraid of them.

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.020
That's not true!

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.560
It's only a few dummies that
are destroying the community.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.040
What about our grandma
now who'd been robbed,

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.110
they call the police for help.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.030
Some woman had been raped,
they call the police for help.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:44.670
Officers are seeing another
side of black people

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:46.470
that they don't wanna tell you about,

00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:49.170
but they project it so
people can be divided,

00:30:49.170 --> 00:30:50.790
and I think that's the biggest thing

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:52.390
that bothers me about it.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:54.550
- So since you were
probably uniquely positioned

00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:57.300
in Arizona as an officer to go
to some of these communities

00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.230
and talk to some of these people,

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:00.750
do you think you were able to wake up

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:03.440
some young kids that were up to no good

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.700
in a way that maybe a white officer

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.980
just wouldn't have been able to,

00:31:06.980 --> 00:31:08.845
as well intentioned as he might be?

00:31:08.845 --> 00:31:12.070
- Yeah, I think young people
and black people in general.

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:14.728
I was considered the black
person whisperer, right?

00:31:14.728 --> 00:31:15.561
(Dave laughing)

00:31:15.561 --> 00:31:17.450
I'm serious, we would go on calls

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:18.617
and black people would be like,

00:31:18.617 --> 00:31:21.067
"Oh, man, eff that, you know
what, I don't wanna talk.

00:31:21.067 --> 00:31:22.637
"Man, I want a black officer.

00:31:22.637 --> 00:31:25.320
"Man, come on, brother, you
know, tell them that I..."

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.330
They go to jail just like they
would with the white officer,

00:31:28.330 --> 00:31:30.380
but somehow they feel compassion

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.230
because they felt they
can identify with me.

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.150
And a lotta times they would listen to me

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:37.387
articulate to them, "Brother,
it ain't what you think it is.

00:31:37.387 --> 00:31:39.837
"They didn't pull you
over 'cause you black.

00:31:39.837 --> 00:31:42.857
"You think they care about
the color of your skin?

00:31:42.857 --> 00:31:44.347
"You got pulled over
'cause you had a suspended

00:31:44.347 --> 00:31:47.107
"driver's license or a
suspended registration.

00:31:47.107 --> 00:31:49.587
"Stop jumping to that conclusion

00:31:49.587 --> 00:31:51.447
"because you are creating a scenario

00:31:51.447 --> 00:31:54.717
"of frustration and conflict
that doesn't need to be had.

00:31:54.717 --> 00:31:57.337
"A officer just comes over
to you doing a routine,

00:31:57.337 --> 00:32:00.467
"what we'd call a routine
traffic stop, and now you hype."

00:32:00.467 --> 00:32:02.010
"Oh, you pulled me over 'cause I'm black."

00:32:02.010 --> 00:32:04.380
This is what that means to
an officer when you say that,

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.450
is that I'm a racist, right?

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:08.360
And I don't have any integrity at all,

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.580
and I didn't waste it all these years,

00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:12.840
develop and building
what I've established,

00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:14.890
and you're telling me that
I'm willing to throw that away

00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:16.618
and I have no integrity, I
don't care about my family,

00:32:16.618 --> 00:32:17.740
I don't care about my pension or nothing,

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.150
because I wanna racially profile you

00:32:20.150 --> 00:32:22.310
as if I'm that shallow-minded.

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:23.392
Well, you'd better believe

00:32:23.392 --> 00:32:24.290
you're probably about to get a ticket.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:26.520
And I think people don't understand

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.880
that they start the
conversation off very wrong

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.713
when they do that.

00:32:30.713 --> 00:32:32.120
A lotta officers let it go,

00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.930
but some officers that
you catch on camera,

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.290
sometimes they don't take it lightly.

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:36.960
- Did you also get the
reverse of that though,

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.410
where you'd go into these communities

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.727
and then they'd see you and be like,

00:32:39.727 --> 00:32:42.595
"Well, this guy's the sellout,
why would we talk to him?"

00:32:42.595 --> 00:32:43.640
- Yeah, sometimes it would happen.

00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:44.473
More often than not,

00:32:44.473 --> 00:32:46.460
they felt that they
could identify with me.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.280
One reason why I think God
kinda put an anointing on me

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.320
that allowed me to reach people uniquely,

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:56.520
black, white, or whatever,
the fact that I didn't curse

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.320
on the job helped me
reach people uniquely,

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.810
'cause when the stuff is hitting the fan,

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.550
the only person that sounds
as if he has integrity,

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:05.600
not just integrity, but
sounds like he's calm

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:09.260
just because I'm not yelling curse words,

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.530
people attract to me.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.040
I felt like God gave me a
gift to communicate as well,

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.980
so I was able to communicate with people,

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.160
and talk people outta
suicide and all kinda stuff.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.410
- What'd you make of just sorta

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:22.550
how the media treats all of the shootings,

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:24.270
and that certain shootings,

00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:28.100
if it's a white cop and a black suspect,

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.670
then we treat it a certain way,

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:31.560
if it's a black cop and a white one,

00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.880
we treat it differently.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.250
A lotta times the same people

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:35.850
who are outraged over it one way,

00:33:35.850 --> 00:33:37.210
then the next day it
happens the other way,

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.400
then they ignore the story,

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.750
the way everyone's playing
this really twisted game

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.860
with policing right now.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.470
- There's money in black
people's emotions, right?

00:33:45.470 --> 00:33:47.820
We're probably the most emotional people,

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:51.163
or group of people if you
want a group, in the country.

00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:55.270
Twice as many white people
have been shot this year

00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:57.480
unarmed than black people in America.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.860
Almost every year the case
is that more white people

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.700
get shot unarmed than black people,

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.540
and white people are not gonna be doing

00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:05.890
what black people are doing, right?

00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:07.720
I don't see white people protesting.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.660
I remember in New Mexico, they
had a shooting in New Mexico,

00:34:09.660 --> 00:34:10.930
the officer shot the guy in the back,

00:34:10.930 --> 00:34:12.970
he was mentally ill, shot him in the back.

00:34:12.970 --> 00:34:14.700
I thought it was ridiculous
for him to shoot the guy

00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:17.710
with the rifle in the back from
such a distance, killed him.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:18.580
It was a bad shooting.

00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.690
I think the officer got fired,
they all got in trouble.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.820
White people aren't out here protesting.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.590
Black people for some reason,

00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:27.170
I don't know if it's the legacy of slavery

00:34:27.170 --> 00:34:28.560
that got us in the mentality

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.340
of feeling like we have to defend

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.410
and be mob-like on certain occasions,

00:34:32.410 --> 00:34:36.350
but we are going to protest,
right, wrong, or indifferent.

00:34:36.350 --> 00:34:38.130
The man can pull a gun
and shoot an officer

00:34:38.130 --> 00:34:39.830
and he gets shot back, we will protest.

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:41.690
I've seen it with my own eyes.

00:34:41.690 --> 00:34:43.840
The media understands that,

00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.620
so they don't care nothing about nobody.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:47.830
It's about if it bleeds, it leads, right?

00:34:47.830 --> 00:34:49.640
They know the black people
are gonna act the fool,

00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:52.040
so they're gonna cover it,
they're gonna showcase it,

00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.890
they're gonna act like
there's this outrageous rate

00:34:54.890 --> 00:34:56.350
of white officers killing black people,

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:58.850
which is not even true at all.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:00.450
White officers, or you say white officers,

00:35:00.450 --> 00:35:02.110
officers in general, you
know places in Philly,

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:03.770
it's 50/50, black and white,

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:06.800
but officers kill more white people,

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.800
twice as many white
people, as black people

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.840
in shootings where people are armed.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:14.350
They kill more people
unarmed white than black.

00:35:14.350 --> 00:35:16.210
And here's the thing that
people always bring up.

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:17.960
Well, there's more white people.

00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.190
Police officers don't deal

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:21.050
with every single person
in the population.

00:35:21.050 --> 00:35:23.530
They deal with the criminal
element of the population.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:27.565
If you look at African
Americans in America,

00:35:27.565 --> 00:35:30.020
we make up 12%, 13% of the population,

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.050
yet we commit over half of
the murders in this country,

00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:33.920
over half of the violent
crimes in this country.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.570
So the bulk of criminal activity
is coming from a small...

00:35:37.570 --> 00:35:38.900
Let me clarify that.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:41.370
13% of the population is
a way overblown number.

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:44.110
It's more like 6% or 7% of the population

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:47.830
because when you take out older
people, young people, women,

00:35:47.830 --> 00:35:50.040
it's mostly young men between
the age of, I don't know,

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:52.490
16 and 35 are doing the
bulk of these crimes.

00:35:52.490 --> 00:35:56.060
So let's 6% is committing
over half of the murders

00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:57.700
and violent crimes in this country.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:35:58.740
When you look at it like that,

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:03.740
police have an overwhelmingly
higher presence

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:06.610
in the black community dealing
with the criminal element,

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.570
yet they shoot more white people

00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:09.900
than they shoot black people.

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.150
If you look at the
proportionality of numbers,

00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:15.500
it's actually a less
likely chance per capita

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:17.480
that you'll get shot as a black man

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.420
as opposed to white people in America.

00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.810
And that to me rules out the idea

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:23.500
of the racist policing in America.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:25.440
- Do you think it's possible
that we're gonna also,

00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:26.370
and maybe we're there already,

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:30.500
gonna have a crisis in
policing where good people,

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.150
forget their skin color,

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:33.820
which I would prefer to do all the time,

00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.770
but good people who are policeman

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:38.410
won't want to work in black communities

00:36:38.410 --> 00:36:39.810
because they know it will ultimately

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:41.310
be an unwinnable situation.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:44.220
You'll either have them
turning on the black officer,

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:45.800
like you, and you're the
sellout and all that,

00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.377
and the white ones will just be like,

00:36:47.377 --> 00:36:48.837
"Well, forget this,
there's no win in this.

00:36:48.837 --> 00:36:51.057
"I could be a great officer for 30 years,

00:36:51.057 --> 00:36:52.882
"but one weird thing happens

00:36:52.882 --> 00:36:54.747
"that gets twisted one way or another

00:36:54.747 --> 00:36:57.120
"or edited or whatever,
and my career is over."

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.730
So then you're gonna get, I
don't even know how you call it,

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.810
like a lower class of qualified
people that are gonna work

00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:04.260
in the communities that need it the most.

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.680
- Right, and then people are not gonna,

00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:08.330
they're not gonna be
proactive in policing.

00:37:08.330 --> 00:37:09.310
We've already seen that happen.

00:37:09.310 --> 00:37:11.170
I mean, if people are now thinking

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:12.650
that we're gonna get to that point,

00:37:12.650 --> 00:37:13.950
you're way behind.
- It's where we're at.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.590
- We're there, we were
there from Ferguson.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:17.470
People don't realize it.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:19.710
The crime rate in these
areas are skyrocketing.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:22.710
Officers, proactive
policing is going down.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:24.910
Listen, police are responsive, right?

00:37:24.910 --> 00:37:27.080
They respond to crimes, right?

00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:28.660
If me and you got into an altercation

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:29.890
and I pulled a gun and I shot you,

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:31.260
they're not there before I shoot you,

00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:33.200
they come after the fact.

00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:36.590
But the greatness of policing,
if it's done properly,

00:37:36.590 --> 00:37:38.050
is proactive policing.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:40.130
Therefore, they've already
had contact with me,

00:37:40.130 --> 00:37:41.740
understood that I'm a danger,

00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:43.570
I've probably gotten arrested
for crimes I've done before,

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.230
before I shoot you.

00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:47.010
That is the way you police.

00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.710
But the reason, I mean,
what they're doing today

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:52.830
is they're killing the spirit
of officers being proactive,

00:37:52.830 --> 00:37:55.530
because you go and you see
a guy doing a hand-to-hand,

00:37:55.530 --> 00:37:58.197
people without the experience
in law enforcement will say,

00:37:58.197 --> 00:37:59.090
"Oh, it's just a hand-to-hand."

00:37:59.090 --> 00:38:00.870
No, the hand-to-hand has
killed so many people

00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:03.000
in the community with drugs and crime

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.750
and all this other stuff, we see that.

00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:06.130
We arrest the man hand-to-hand,

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.350
we get into a scuffle with him,

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.220
now police brutality, we get fired.

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.016
An officer sees hand-to-hand and say,

00:38:11.016 --> 00:38:14.150
"I'm not gonna care more
than the community does."

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:19.150
Because it takes a lot,
man, for you to risk life,

00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:21.250
life and death every day,
putting your family through that,

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:24.160
and at the end of the day,
you wanna get your pension.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.470
And you lose your pension over
something you did correctly,

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.750
over something that you
were justified in doing,

00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.850
but because the community became
outraged, you lose it all.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:33.880
We saw it in Baltimore.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.500
All you gotta do is look at the stats.

00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:37.260
Baltimore, huge reduction,

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:38.580
huge reduction in applicants.

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.630
California, huge reduction in applicants.

00:38:41.691 --> 00:38:44.450
And we've seen this on the
Tucson Police Department,

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:47.690
and they won't tell the public
because the chief is a crap,

00:38:47.690 --> 00:38:50.940
but we had to dumb down the scores

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.590
because we didn't have
enough qualified people

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:53.473
to join the police department.

00:38:53.473 --> 00:38:56.280
When I was there, you had
to make a 75 or above,

00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.010
and this is a test that
you can't study for.

00:38:58.010 --> 00:39:01.340
You gotta come out the gate
having a basic understanding.

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:04.320
Now I think they put it down to like 40%.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.220
Officers on the department are like...

00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:08.240
And I'm gonna tell you this,

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.850
any department you can look at the stats,

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:11.470
Tucson is a big example,

00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:13.720
when they did this a while ago,

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:16.150
you see officers getting
fired all the time,

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:19.423
officers doing bad stuff, they're
skipping over backgrounds.

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:24.270
It is making policing in
America more dangerous

00:39:24.270 --> 00:39:27.690
by the rhetoric that they're
spewing, which is false.

00:39:27.690 --> 00:39:29.440
These are lies that they're telling you.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.650
Michael Brown, they still talk about

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.330
hands up, don't shoot, lie.

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:35.580
Eric Garner, I will fight to the death

00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:38.673
about the justification of use
of force against Eric Garner.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:41.970
Tamir Rice, all of these
shooting and all of these things,

00:39:41.970 --> 00:39:43.000
if you're a police officer,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:47.520
you understand that these
are justified uses of force.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.530
People conflate the two.

00:39:49.530 --> 00:39:51.850
Justified killings is what they call it,

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:52.940
or killing somebody,

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.240
versus the justification of use of force.

00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.800
There's a big difference.

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:59.100
They weren't trying to kill Eric Garner.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:02.190
The dude was fat,
overweight, heart condition.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:04.100
You use any force against him,

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:05.790
he's gonna go into cardiac arrest.

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:07.590
He's like a ticking time bomb.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:10.530
They weren't trying to kill Tamir Rice,

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:13.030
the young kid that they
had to pull the gun on him.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.670
He got put in a bad position,
he used forced against him.

00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:19.860
Unfortunately, that one
shot caused his death.

00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.930
So people begin to conflate the two,

00:40:21.930 --> 00:40:23.330
we can never address the real issue

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.970
because we're not talking
about real problems.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:26.390
- Right, and the interesting thing is,

00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:28.270
of course you're not
defending the incidences

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:30.750
when there genuinely are bad guys,

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:32.170
but what people always forget about

00:40:32.170 --> 00:40:35.860
is that constant threat
that you guys are under,

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.870
you just don't know what's
gonna happen on a knife's edge,

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.230
whether that guy has a
gun or the other thing.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.720
So sometimes you have to be what would

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.800
I guess appear to be visually more careful

00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:47.790
than maybe the average
person would want you to be.

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:49.060
- Well, this is what they
teach you in the academy,

00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.150
and I know this is not popular,

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:52.300
people will probably be
mad at me for saying this,

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:53.410
we get taught in the academy,

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:54.670
and when they said this to me,

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:56.460
I thought it was the most
extreme thing in the world,

00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:58.150
and I'm like, "Oh, they're going too far."

00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:59.910
What they teach you in
the academy is that you,

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.240
and not everywhere, in my academy,

00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.800
you have to be prepared to kill

00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:05.790
every single person you interact with.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:07.530
You have to be prepared emotionally

00:41:07.530 --> 00:41:10.110
to kill every person
that you interact with,

00:41:10.110 --> 00:41:12.590
because if you're not, you're gonna die.

00:41:12.590 --> 00:41:13.610
You're gonna get killed,

00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.500
and you're gonna get all
your other buddies killed.

00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.890
So you have to be able to have the mindset

00:41:17.890 --> 00:41:20.180
that at any moment this
person can turn on me,

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:22.250
whether or not they're a kid,

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:24.300
whether or not they're a elderly woman,

00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:25.950
because we've seen the
spectrum of officers

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:28.120
getting killed by all kinds of people.

00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.830
You have to be prepared for that,

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:32.920
and people don't
understand our perspective.

00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.870
This is not a video game.

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:36.610
You don't get to hit the reset button.

00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:39.420
When you die, you die for
real and you're gone forever.

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.230
And the unique part of what we see

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:43.300
is that we see people die every day.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.830
We see the last breath.

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:46.650
We see a person pleading for their life.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:48.147
And in the officer's mind, it's like,

00:41:48.147 --> 00:41:50.057
"I don't wanna look like that when I die.

00:41:50.057 --> 00:41:52.927
"I don't want my family
to see me like this guy.

00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:54.747
"I don't wanna be in my last breath

00:41:54.747 --> 00:41:57.857
"not being able to talk
to my son on the phone.

00:41:57.857 --> 00:42:00.527
"You need to do the
right thing or I'm gonna,

00:42:00.527 --> 00:42:03.410
"if it's me or you, I'm gonna win."

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:06.553
People pose threats all the time, right?

00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:08.760
Just think about how many,

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.150
I pulled my gun when I was a officer,

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.263
I don't know, four or five times a week.

00:42:13.870 --> 00:42:15.020
People have guns,

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:17.970
I didn't escape death I
don't know how many times.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:19.960
People don't see that side.

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.500
Every officer has their own
perspective about life, right?

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:27.090
We may go to the same call,
you may have been shot before,

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:28.900
I've never been shot so
I'm grinning behind there,

00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.220
I'm driving in there, no caution.

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.180
That other officer may have
a reflection in the mind of,

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:37.031
"Man, last time I got
shot 'cause I did this.

00:42:37.031 --> 00:42:38.997
"Last time I got shot, I seen
the guy pull it from here,

00:42:38.997 --> 00:42:40.560
"but I didn't react fast enough."

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:45.010
They get to the call, here
he go, pulling, now he shot.

00:42:45.010 --> 00:42:46.887
You get what I'm saying?
- Mm-hmm.

00:42:48.054 --> 00:42:50.770
- The moral of the story is
that we do go through a lot,

00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:52.450
and if people understood,
they would be able

00:42:52.450 --> 00:42:54.800
to see these shootings
in a much clearer light.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.260
- All right, so let's shift
this a little bit to politics,

00:42:57.260 --> 00:42:59.013
which will get us to Blexit.

00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:02.310
So most of the cities, and
you mentioned Ferguson,

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:03.220
you mentioned Baltimore,

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:06.300
the cities where there are
the most shootings, Chicago,

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:08.830
we can go through the
list of these cities,

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:10.570
people don't seem to want to accept this,

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:12.980
or at least mainstream media
doesn't wanna accept this,

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.370
that these are Democrat-run cities.

00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:17.200
But I thought Democrats liked black people

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:19.063
more than you mean Republicans.

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:21.173
What's the problem here?

00:43:21.173 --> 00:43:22.290
Something's not adding up.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:23.880
- 'Cause it's not true.
- I can't believe it.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:27.770
- It's like if the standard
is two plus two is four,

00:43:27.770 --> 00:43:30.690
and you see an equation that
said two plus two is three,

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.481
it's something wrong there.

00:43:32.481 --> 00:43:34.130
(laughing)

00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:37.400
It's politically expedient
for them to evade the issue.

00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:38.233
And you say, what,

00:43:38.233 --> 00:43:39.620
the virtue of having a D behind your name?

00:43:39.620 --> 00:43:41.390
No, it's not, it's the policies.

00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:43.880
Think about this, who's anti-police?

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:45.960
Democrats, and what are they doing?

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.410
They're causing police not to act.

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:49.440
They're causing police to
be the enemy of the people.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.340
People aren't snitching,

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:51.450
they're not cooperating with police,

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:53.230
now crimes aren't being solved.

00:43:53.230 --> 00:43:55.620
Those things have issues.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.860
They want you to be on food stamps.

00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.510
They don't want you to be independent.

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.410
They don't want you to go
out and get on your own.

00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:02.490
They don't want jobs to
come to your community.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:03.323
They don't want that.

00:44:03.323 --> 00:44:05.890
They need you to need them
so they can win votes.

00:44:05.890 --> 00:44:06.723
- When you say they,

00:44:06.723 --> 00:44:08.540
are you talking about the--
- Democrat elite.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:10.120
- You're talking about
the political class.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.570
- Political class.
- 'Cause I believe even for,

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.590
I mean, you know enough
about my political evolution,

00:44:13.590 --> 00:44:16.150
for as frustrated as I am
with the lefties these days,

00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:18.540
most of them I think are just misguided.

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:19.910
I don't think they're bad people.

00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:21.110
I don't think they're really trying

00:44:21.110 --> 00:44:23.560
to screw over black people
or something like that.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:26.830
The elite do it and their
easy bumper sticker answer

00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:28.890
is give more money to
this community for this.

00:44:28.890 --> 00:44:29.770
It sounds good.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.850
Get the police out, police are killing.

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:33.620
It all sounds kinda right,

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.470
but I don't think the average
person actually believes that,

00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:38.700
but it's breaking through
that layer of craziness.

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:40.800
- It's not the people.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:42.150
You could even look at this

00:44:43.116 --> 00:44:45.760
in a spiritual sense of a pastor, right?

00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:48.770
The people, the lay members,
are receiving information

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.770
from the pastor in hopes that
he's acting in good faith

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.870
to project the gospel, right?

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:56.250
He said he got a degree, you believe him,

00:44:56.250 --> 00:44:57.820
you're learning from him.

00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:01.320
People in the Democratic Party,
the people, the lay members,

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:03.230
they are listening to these politicians,

00:45:03.230 --> 00:45:05.320
hoping that they're telling you
the truth about immigration.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.926
- He said Republicans are all
racists, so it must be right.

00:45:07.926 --> 00:45:08.759
(laughing)

00:45:08.759 --> 00:45:11.530
- So you're hoping that
they're telling you the truth,

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:14.310
but they're lying to you, and
it's the people at the top.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.380
It's most of these Democratic people

00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.640
that are running for Congress,

00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.640
not even every Democratic
person in the House,

00:45:19.640 --> 00:45:22.160
there's some people that are
like, they're more reasonable.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:26.250
But the party line idea,
the party line politics,

00:45:26.250 --> 00:45:29.500
is what's destroying people,
and it's almost like this.

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:34.500
Look, I equate slavery and
then the freedom of slaves

00:45:35.570 --> 00:45:37.260
to the Democratic Party today,

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.160
and this is how I compared it to.

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:41.610
When slaves were on a plantation,
they knew it was wrong,

00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:44.740
whatever the case may be, the
slaves didn't wanna be there.

00:45:44.740 --> 00:45:47.967
But when they got free, what
did the slave master tell them?

00:45:47.967 --> 00:45:50.067
"Oh, wait, wait, wait,
how are you gonna survive

00:45:50.067 --> 00:45:51.597
"out there on your own?

00:45:51.597 --> 00:45:52.717
"Who's gonna take care of you?

00:45:52.717 --> 00:45:54.237
"You gotta have food, we can feed you,

00:45:54.237 --> 00:45:55.947
"we'll take care of you,
make sure your safe.

00:45:55.947 --> 00:45:58.060
"Stay here in slavery."

00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:01.310
And a lotta slaves did,
they felt comfortable.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:02.860
They didn't wanna go out on their own

00:46:02.860 --> 00:46:06.610
and risk the big bad world,
because entrepreneurs, be free.

00:46:06.610 --> 00:46:10.050
The Democratic Party's almost
the same similar concept

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:12.400
because black folks need to be free.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.980
We need to understand that
we can be entrepreneurs,

00:46:14.980 --> 00:46:17.650
we can be flight attendants,
we can do it all.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:21.020
They don't want you to go into
this big bad world and fail.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.310
Failure is only a pathway to success.

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:26.590
If you never fail, you
will never be successful.

00:46:26.590 --> 00:46:28.210
But they don't want you
to get off the plantation.

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.950
They want you to stay
so they can coddle you,

00:46:29.950 --> 00:46:32.853
and then, what, our
communities become desolate,

00:46:33.725 --> 00:46:35.170
no real spirit of the community,

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:37.970
and then leave.
- And dependent on them,

00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:38.860
them being the government.

00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.350
You know, it's interesting,
'cause everything you just said

00:46:40.350 --> 00:46:44.840
is basically what Kanye said
about the mentality of slavery,

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:45.673
and then what happened?

00:46:45.673 --> 00:46:46.690
Well, mainstream media said

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:49.490
he should be in a mental
institution, remember that?

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:51.810
- They have to, these
people are working together.

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:52.980
I don't know if it's
people buying the same,

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.040
paying money or what,

00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.190
they're working together
to push an agenda.

00:46:57.375 --> 00:46:58.530
I mean, all these things that are run

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:01.372
by some of these Democratic
elites, they have to.

00:47:01.372 --> 00:47:06.372
You can't ruin their I
guess reign over the people.

00:47:07.570 --> 00:47:08.530
There's a difference between,

00:47:08.530 --> 00:47:10.060
and I'm not saying
every Republican, right?

00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:12.150
I'm more a Trump Republican, right?

00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:13.567
I don't like some of the
people in the Republican Party

00:47:13.567 --> 00:47:14.860
and I think they haven't done much

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.300
for the black community anyway.

00:47:16.300 --> 00:47:19.340
Their outreach has been poor to me.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.700
I never seen none of them.

00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:21.820
I never even knew they existed

00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.940
until I decided to look on the other side.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:26.613
But when you look at it for what it is,

00:47:27.509 --> 00:47:32.509
the people in the Democratic
Party, their focus is on power.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:36.750
More so in the conservative movement

00:47:36.750 --> 00:47:38.230
or in the Republican Party,

00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:40.530
their focus is the people more so often.

00:47:40.530 --> 00:47:43.130
We want you to be free,
less government, whatever.

00:47:43.130 --> 00:47:46.270
The Democrats want power
by any means necessary.

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:48.760
They will support border wall,

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:52.110
they will support strong
immigration reform,

00:47:52.110 --> 00:47:55.140
then when it's not advantageous for votes,

00:47:55.140 --> 00:47:58.700
they will switch it in
the same conversation

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.440
they're having with you and
act like it never happened.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.160
As a person who's new to politics,
just seeing Chuck Schumer

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.950
and all of them once just advocate.

00:48:07.950 --> 00:48:10.440
Barack Obama deported the most people

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:13.440
in United States history
outta any president.

00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.490
And then they turn and they cry on TV,

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:18.310
and they make up this stuff.

00:48:18.310 --> 00:48:20.460
They tell you if you
come to a port of entry,

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.970
you're gonna be separated from
your family, which is a lie.

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:25.190
If you come to a port of
entry and you seek asylum,

00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:27.400
you go through a process
for them to verify

00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:30.020
your asylum-seeking request.

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.610
If you get busted over here

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.630
or you're trying to
sneak through the border,

00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:35.830
that's when you get separated

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:37.830
'cause now you're going
through a criminal proceeding.

00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:40.600
They know that, but
they will never tell you

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.540
because they need the
votes, they need power.

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:45.180
Why haven't any of these candidates

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.180
been pandering as much to black folks?

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:50.227
Think about this, they're
speaking in Spanish.

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:51.383
(Dave laughing)

00:48:51.383 --> 00:48:52.470
They on there talking about

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.490
they gonna get every
illegal free healthcare.

00:48:54.490 --> 00:48:55.860
They wanna get housing.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:58.890
Why are they not saying,
"We're gonna fix Chicago--"

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:00.643
- I think I know where
you're going with this.

00:49:00.643 --> 00:49:01.476
- "We're gonna fix the school system,"

00:49:01.476 --> 00:49:04.320
because we are being replaced.

00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:05.770
We're 13% of the population.

00:49:05.770 --> 00:49:07.420
How much do our vote really count?

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:10.575
Now the Hispanic community
or even the illegals

00:49:10.575 --> 00:49:11.770
that are coming in by the millions,

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:13.757
I don't know, in about 10 years,

00:49:13.757 --> 00:49:15.540
they're gonna never need
another black person again

00:49:15.540 --> 00:49:17.830
to vote because our vote won't count.

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:18.663
- But not only that,

00:49:18.663 --> 00:49:21.760
but if you get 90 some odd
percent of a group's vote,

00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:22.860
then you don't have to give them anything.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:23.693
If you know you're...

00:49:23.693 --> 00:49:25.227
And that is the brilliance
of Trump saying,

00:49:25.227 --> 00:49:27.100
"Well, what do you have to lose?"

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.494
'Cause all right, we're giving this group

00:49:29.494 --> 00:49:31.882
I think it's 94% or something
like the year before.

00:49:31.882 --> 00:49:32.930
- In some areas, it's 100%.

00:49:32.930 --> 00:49:34.620
It's mostly on the 90 percentile.

00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:37.360
- Yeah, it's like well, then,
don't worry about those guys,

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.740
we got 'em taken care of already.

00:49:38.740 --> 00:49:39.573
(snaps fingers)

00:49:39.573 --> 00:49:40.540
We got that box checked.

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.650
- And what I preach often

00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:44.300
is it's not about the
Republican or Democratic Party.

00:49:45.310 --> 00:49:48.060
It's about leaving people who
ain't doing nothing for you.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.280
And in many of these
cases in the inner city,

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.980
you've been voting for them 40 years.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.527
You're still complaining,
you still ain't got nothing,

00:49:53.527 --> 00:49:55.540
you're still blaming people.

00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:57.560
Don't blame the Republican white man

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.130
because the Republicans
ain't even in your community.

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:00.561
They ain't talking to you,

00:50:00.561 --> 00:50:01.500
they're not doing nothing for you.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.410
Blame the people who are
there in your community

00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:05.230
perpetuating these things.

00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:07.600
Stop voting for them.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.990
I'm not telling you run to the...

00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:10.170
Do your research.

00:50:10.170 --> 00:50:11.870
But one thing you do know,

00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:12.860
you may not know what the Republicans are

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.460
because you never gave them a chance.

00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:17.700
What you do know is the
Democrats haven't done nothing.

00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:18.890
And you're talking about a person

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:20.110
who my whole family's Democrat.

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:22.940
I grew up feeling like I was a Democrat.

00:50:22.940 --> 00:50:25.710
And dude, when the truth bomb hits you,

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:27.000
it's like a ton of bricks.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.335
- It's a little weird, right?
- It is.

00:50:29.335 --> 00:50:32.090
So we obviously, we swim in
some of the same pools here,

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:33.730
so the first time we
met was about a year ago

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:36.010
at a Turning Point, you
spoke right before me.

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.870
And it was one of the few
times that I was like, oh, man,

00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:41.230
because you have incredible energy

00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:42.587
and the music you went up to

00:50:42.587 --> 00:50:43.970
and you were just like
knocking it out of the park,

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.260
and then obviously I'm
a little more low key,

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.562
so I was like, god, I don't
know if I can follow that.

00:50:48.562 --> 00:50:49.500
But it all worked out.

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.000
But we go to a lot of the
same events and things.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.410
And I find these people that
are usually Trump supporters,

00:50:56.410 --> 00:51:00.225
but certainly people on
the right, they don't care.

00:51:00.225 --> 00:51:02.730
People can't, when I talk about it,

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:04.160
they almost can't accept it.

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.010
They don't care about race.

00:51:06.010 --> 00:51:09.250
They don't care about sexuality.

00:51:09.250 --> 00:51:10.510
They don't care about gender.

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:12.470
They don't care about any of these issues.

00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:15.660
They're really just saying,
"Let me live," that's it.

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:19.790
But it is hard realizing
that these people aren't bad.

00:51:19.790 --> 00:51:21.700
I even, still now years later,

00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:24.507
I go to some functions or
something, and I'll be like,

00:51:24.507 --> 00:51:27.224
"I can't believe these
aren't the bad guys."

00:51:27.224 --> 00:51:28.110
But they're not.

00:51:28.110 --> 00:51:29.410
- This is how I was raised.

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:32.270
Republicans are racist white
people, that's how it was.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:35.350
And now I'm like, Republicans
are like the nicest people

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:37.480
that you know, and I'm not
just saying Republicans,

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.590
I'm saying people that are more

00:51:38.590 --> 00:51:40.040
on the conservative spectrum.

00:51:41.285 --> 00:51:42.937
There's obviously Libertarian in it,

00:51:42.937 --> 00:51:45.720
and it's flexible on that
part, already far right.

00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:46.970
But I feel like that people

00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:50.210
that are around the
conservative side and viewpoint

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:52.980
are the most generous people I've met,

00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.890
are the most realistic people.

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:57.347
They say, "Well, let's
go by the Constitution.

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:59.670
"Let's go by what's fair."

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:01.950
The other side seems to be more emotional.

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:05.150
It's not about what's
fair, it's what I feel.

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.254
If one person have a alt,

00:52:07.254 --> 00:52:10.070
let's just say transgender for example,

00:52:10.070 --> 00:52:11.620
if a transgender person, one person,

00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:14.350
I'm not saying that we
shouldn't acknowledge

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:16.890
a person's feelings 'cause God's mission

00:52:16.890 --> 00:52:19.477
is to love everybody, but one person says,

00:52:19.477 --> 00:52:21.930
"You know what, I need bathroom,"

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:23.847
they are willing to say,

00:52:23.847 --> 00:52:27.770
"Everybody's rights have
to be restructured."

00:52:27.770 --> 00:52:30.520
Everybody's feelings are
thrown outta the loop

00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.120
because one person has a request

00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:34.480
that could infringe on everybody else,

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.580
but we don't care because
that person deserves

00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:38.610
to have this thing.
- And not only that,

00:52:38.610 --> 00:52:39.940
we're gonna cut federal funding

00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:41.820
from states that don't
behave a certain way

00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.660
relative to whatever the
flavor of the day is.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.807
- We're gonna punish
you for, I don't know,

00:52:44.807 --> 00:52:47.100
.000 some percent of the population.

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:48.240
I don't feel like that's right.

00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.577
Conservatives will say, "Well, let's see,

00:52:50.577 --> 00:52:53.547
"if the person feel like they
want a separate bathroom,

00:52:53.547 --> 00:52:56.837
"how can we remedy this
and everybody be happy?

00:52:56.837 --> 00:52:59.407
"Maybe they can identify a certain way

00:52:59.407 --> 00:53:03.130
"and then use something that
they look like, or maybe not."

00:53:03.130 --> 00:53:03.963
- Well, that's the irony.

00:53:03.963 --> 00:53:06.120
Trans people have been
using bathrooms for decades.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.675
- I never in my life,

00:53:07.675 --> 00:53:08.508
(laughing)

00:53:08.508 --> 00:53:09.341
and I guarantee you trans people

00:53:09.341 --> 00:53:10.646
have come into the restroom.
- Of course.

00:53:10.646 --> 00:53:11.479
(laughing)

00:53:11.479 --> 00:53:12.410
- Because they look like...

00:53:12.410 --> 00:53:15.580
I've seen trans people,
men that turn into girls.

00:53:15.580 --> 00:53:17.310
They got beards and everything.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:19.420
I'm not checking your crotch area, man.

00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:21.920
You come in here, you look like a dude.

00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:24.280
Some dudes that are biological dudes,

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.810
they look great in our clothes,

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:27.710
they may wear long hair or whatever.

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:29.810
But who cares, dude?
- Nobody cares.

00:53:29.810 --> 00:53:31.820
- Just don't be in my stall.

00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:33.200
Don't be looking at my stuff

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.630
and we ain't got no problem.

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:36.090
And I don't think people do that.

00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:38.790
I guarantee you that trans women,

00:53:38.790 --> 00:53:40.570
I think that's men to women,

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:43.240
they've been going into the
women's restroom forever

00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:46.047
and some of them have a
conscious awareness to say,

00:53:46.047 --> 00:53:48.763
"I actually present, I look like a woman

00:53:48.763 --> 00:53:50.190
"and people don't even know."

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:51.750
They go right in the restroom
and you feel comfortable.

00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:55.230
What would be weird to me
is if you look like a woman,

00:53:55.230 --> 00:53:56.577
you got breasts, everything,

00:53:56.577 --> 00:53:58.440
and you go in the men's restroom,

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.750
I think that would be more awkward and odd

00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:01.583
than if you went in the one

00:54:01.583 --> 00:54:03.572
that you actually match
the description of.

00:54:03.572 --> 00:54:04.540
- And they just wanna flip everything.

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:07.009
A couple of months ago, I was in Sonoma,

00:54:07.009 --> 00:54:09.310
I was at a winery, and they
didn't have male and female,

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:10.940
they only had an all gender restroom.

00:54:10.940 --> 00:54:14.130
So even where you wash your
hands is the same area.

00:54:14.130 --> 00:54:15.440
And this woman came out of the stall,

00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:17.180
and it was just obvious to me

00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:19.210
that she had just gone number two.

00:54:19.210 --> 00:54:21.210
And we're like looking at each other,

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:23.972
and it was like something felt wrong.

00:54:23.972 --> 00:54:24.805
You know what I mean?

00:54:24.805 --> 00:54:25.638
(laughing)

00:54:25.638 --> 00:54:26.471
It was just like why do we have to be

00:54:26.471 --> 00:54:28.710
standing here together right now.

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:31.060
Okay, so let's get this to Blexit,

00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.652
'cause if we go down that path--

00:54:32.652 --> 00:54:33.698
- Yeah, it'll be a whole show.

00:54:33.698 --> 00:54:34.531
- It'll be a whole other thing.

00:54:34.531 --> 00:54:37.620
So I mentioned to you
right before we started,

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.740
when I had Candace Owens on originally,

00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:41.790
this is now like two plus years ago

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:45.520
when she was just a YouTuber
with 100,000 subscribers.

00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:46.980
Her name was Red Pill Black.

00:54:46.980 --> 00:54:48.430
I didn't even know her name was Candace

00:54:48.430 --> 00:54:50.050
when we first booked her.

00:54:50.050 --> 00:54:51.720
I said to my guys, "We
gotta find out her name.

00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.790
"I don't even know what her name is."

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:54.790
Anyway, I had her in for an hour

00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:57.680
and I just knew in that hour

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.267
that this girl was going to blow up,

00:55:00.267 --> 00:55:02.850
and I'm proud to say that she sat in here

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:04.540
and had a part of that.

00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:06.783
We were just at her wedding
a couple of weeks ago.

00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:10.270
You co-founded the
Blexit movement with her.

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:12.960
The idea of that, the basic idea being

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.100
that black people don't
have to be Democrats.

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:17.390
- True.
- And Candace always says

00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:19.470
that it's the least...

00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:21.307
She always says, "People
think I'm so controversial,

00:55:21.307 --> 00:55:25.727
"but it's the least controversial
thing that you can say

00:55:25.727 --> 00:55:27.487
"because you shouldn't
have to vote for a party

00:55:27.487 --> 00:55:30.010
"just 'cause of your skin
color, and yet here we are."

00:55:30.010 --> 00:55:33.280
- Right, party line is ridiculous.

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.007
You vote based on the
values of your community

00:55:35.007 --> 00:55:36.573
and what you wanna see changed.

00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:40.460
The premise of Blexit,
and I think that people

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.310
get too caught up in
the name, Blexit, right?

00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:45.170
I know that the name, it means a lot,

00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:47.040
obviously, because the
movement is named after...

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.910
But the thing is freedom.

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:50.370
When I see Blexit, I see freedom.

00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:51.203
When some people see Blexit,

00:55:51.203 --> 00:55:52.650
they see, "Oh, you hate the Democrats."

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:54.890
It has really not much to do
with the Democratic Party,

00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:57.980
it's more of being free,
having a free mind.

00:55:57.980 --> 00:56:00.280
There's something else out there.

00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.557
For the longest, we feel
like it's only one thing

00:56:02.557 --> 00:56:05.910
that we could utilize or access.

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:07.630
We just want people to know,

00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:08.810
let me show you the history

00:56:08.810 --> 00:56:11.740
of what we've been doing all this time

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.020
and it's gotten us nowhere.

00:56:13.020 --> 00:56:15.590
Here is another perspective.

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:17.180
Think about this for a minute.

00:56:17.180 --> 00:56:19.520
I believe most black
people are conservative.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:21.460
Most black people are
conservative, believe it or not.

00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:22.723
Even black criminals are conservative.

00:56:22.723 --> 00:56:25.810
All you gotta do is think
about it for a few seconds.

00:56:25.810 --> 00:56:28.630
If you were to sell drugs,
say the drug dealers,

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:31.140
I have some in my family,
cannot confirm or deny it,

00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:32.363
they still doing it.

00:56:32.363 --> 00:56:33.587
(Dave laughing)

00:56:33.587 --> 00:56:35.940
But you have drug dealers selling weed,

00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:38.380
name a drug dealer that want
government intervention.

00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:39.740
Name a drug dealer that wanna pay taxes

00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:40.573
on their drugs.

00:56:40.573 --> 00:56:42.190
- Most drug dealers are Libertarian.

00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.565
- Name a drug dealer that's like,

00:56:43.565 --> 00:56:45.757
"Hey, man, you wasn't hustling all week

00:56:45.757 --> 00:56:47.047
"and putting your life on the line,

00:56:47.047 --> 00:56:48.517
"maybe you were sick that day.

00:56:48.517 --> 00:56:50.210
"Let me give all my drug money

00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:52.250
and split it with you 'cause it's fair."

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:53.083
(laughing)

00:56:53.083 --> 00:56:54.120
It's never gonna happen.

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.820
Name a drug dealer that don't have a gun,

00:56:55.820 --> 00:56:58.950
that don't want their
right to bear arms, per se,

00:56:58.950 --> 00:57:00.280
to protect themselves.

00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.720
And I know it's a weird analogy,

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:04.510
but I think that it resonates
because in the community

00:57:04.510 --> 00:57:07.320
those things are not just
the criminal element of it,

00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:08.930
but the conservative ideas.

00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:10.640
- Right, so give me a wider example

00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:13.201
than just the black people
as the criminal there.

00:57:13.201 --> 00:57:14.034
(laughing)

00:57:14.034 --> 00:57:16.420
Let's widen that a little bit, right?

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:18.749
Do you mean on social issues also?

00:57:18.749 --> 00:57:19.930
- Think about this, the
most religious people

00:57:19.930 --> 00:57:22.050
I think per capita is black folks.

00:57:22.050 --> 00:57:23.540
We go to church every Sunday.

00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:25.960
We shout in charismatic churches.

00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.570
We'll throw a Scripture
at you in a minute.

00:57:27.570 --> 00:57:30.800
We are the most conservative
culturally, in my opinion,

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.710
at least growing up we were that way.

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:35.250
My dad didn't let you make excuses.

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:36.210
What do you mean, you want somebody

00:57:36.210 --> 00:57:37.100
to hand something to you?

00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:38.600
You better work for what you got.

00:57:38.600 --> 00:57:40.770
My dad started at 18 years
old at the fire department,

00:57:40.770 --> 00:57:42.010
and now he's the chief.

00:57:42.010 --> 00:57:43.320
My dad didn't put up with that.

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:44.670
It was unacceptable.

00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:45.780
You don't wanna be a coward.

00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:46.960
You're a strong man.

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:50.210
These are the things that
grandfathers used to say, too.

00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:51.410
And a lotta people in the black community

00:57:51.410 --> 00:57:52.740
still have remnants of that.

00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:54.220
Grandma is strong.

00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:56.187
Grandma used to say,
"It's either hell or jail,

00:57:56.187 --> 00:57:58.960
"if you wanna act like that and
sell drugs and be that way."

00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:01.800
Black people adhere to that idea,

00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:06.800
the structure of self-entrepreneurship,
being an individual.

00:58:07.290 --> 00:58:09.510
Think about music, think about culture.

00:58:09.510 --> 00:58:11.370
Black people dominate culture

00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:15.090
because we've created a unique
idea on our own in many ways.

00:58:15.090 --> 00:58:17.250
That is more of the conservative ideal.

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:19.070
We don't wanna be followers.

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:20.820
We don't want people
telling us what to do.

00:58:20.820 --> 00:58:23.680
We've always pushed the
envelope as a community.

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:26.490
That's to me more of a conservative idea.

00:58:26.490 --> 00:58:27.620
Look at the entrepreneurs

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.870
going from drug dealing
to being billionaires,

00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:33.410
Jay-Z and all these other
people who took advantage

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:35.650
of saying you can turn your life around

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:36.740
and you can be an entrepreneur

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.030
and you can make it as
high as you want to.

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:40.060
Oprah Winfrey, you can keep naming 'em.

00:58:40.060 --> 00:58:42.170
I'll tell you one that people
really don't talk about

00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:43.620
is Madame C.J. Walker,

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.150
who's the first female millionaire

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:48.530
outta any race in the early 1900s.

00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:50.640
Millionaire, they got pictures of her

00:58:50.640 --> 00:58:53.490
with white people driving her
around in the early 1900s.

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:57.640
So we have always understood
the entrepreneur spirit,

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:01.700
and for some reason, we
believe that the Democrats

00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:03.270
are that side instead of the Republicans,

00:59:03.270 --> 00:59:05.090
and we've been confused, in my opinion.

00:59:05.090 --> 00:59:09.203
So back to Blexit, if we only understood,

00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:11.290
I think we would change.

00:59:11.290 --> 00:59:12.740
We've seen people change a lot.

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:14.866
- Do you feel it breaking?
- I do.

00:59:14.866 --> 00:59:15.699
- 'Cause the other thing I said to you

00:59:15.699 --> 00:59:16.532
right before we started

00:59:16.532 --> 00:59:18.270
was the day that all the Democrats

00:59:18.270 --> 00:59:20.340
started talking about reparations,

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:23.220
I called Candace and I said,
"This is 'cause of you."

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:28.220
She caused such a freaking
split where it needed to happen,

00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:30.567
that suddenly the Democrats were like,

00:59:30.567 --> 00:59:32.255
"All right, guys, we're
starting to lose you.

00:59:32.255 --> 00:59:33.088
"How 'bout some cash?

00:59:33.088 --> 00:59:35.350
"Stay with us, here's cold hard cash."

00:59:35.350 --> 00:59:36.520
And what's the number?

00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:37.353
That's the other thing.

00:59:37.353 --> 00:59:38.470
It's like there's never gonna be a number

00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:40.320
that's enough, right?

00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:42.220
- Yeah, it's because
reparation in and of itself

00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:43.950
is the stupidest idea ever,

00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:45.210
because how you gonna pay it?

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:46.200
We pay taxes still.

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.500
What, they gonna not let us pay taxes?

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:48.740
I'm gonna pay for my own reparations

00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.290
if I were to get it.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:52.810
Think about this, how much
money are they gonna give you?

00:59:52.810 --> 00:59:53.800
- Well, they'll tell you

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.371
that they're gonna take
it from billionaires.

00:59:55.371 --> 00:59:56.620
- Yeah, and give you how much though?

00:59:56.620 --> 00:59:58.150
$1,000 ain't gonna do nothing.

00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:59.687
People will blow that in a weekend.

00:59:59.687 --> 01:00:01.980
$10,000 is nothing, 20, 30,000,

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:05.630
generational change,
$100,000 may not be enough.

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:06.940
And then if you don't know anything,

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.190
if you're not educated
and don't know anything

01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:10.040
about finances, that
$100,000 is gonna last you,

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.970
what, I don't know, four months?

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:14.510
I've had a friend, I
think he got $2 million

01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:17.680
from a settlement, blew it all,
have nothing to show for it.

01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:20.350
- Damn, that's money.
- Just giving somebody money

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:22.490
is not gonna help them at all.

01:00:22.490 --> 01:00:24.084
But that's another story.

01:00:24.084 --> 01:00:25.010
- But also it never would be enough,

01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:26.560
not just the literal amount,

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.080
but okay, let's say you gave

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:32.200
every black person $50,000,
just make up a number.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.300
Well, now you're two
generations past that, right?

01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.820
And if the left just keeps
going off the deep end,

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:37.837
their grandchildren will go,

01:00:37.837 --> 01:00:40.997
"Wait, you sold us out for 50 grand?

01:00:40.997 --> 01:00:43.032
"That was nothing."
- True.

01:00:43.032 --> 01:00:45.330
- It's almost the reverse

01:00:45.330 --> 01:00:47.550
of the way human
psychology actually works.

01:00:47.550 --> 01:00:49.610
- Right, and then you
know, everybody knows,

01:00:49.610 --> 01:00:50.540
when you give a person something,

01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:51.480
when you just hand somebody something,

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:53.070
they don't appreciate it as much.

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:54.110
What kind of growth potential...

01:00:54.110 --> 01:00:55.170
Give me a better education.

01:00:55.170 --> 01:00:56.610
I don't need reparations and money.

01:00:56.610 --> 01:00:57.640
Fix these doggone schools

01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.000
with the money we've already given you.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.503
I mean, it seems like common sense to me.

01:01:04.254 --> 01:01:05.490
- Do you think going into 2020,

01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:06.790
and you're obviously a Trump guy,

01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:07.723
do you think there's gonna be

01:01:07.723 --> 01:01:10.480
just a seriously massive
shift in the black vote?

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.050
- I think it's gonna be a
shift in the black vote.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:15.040
I'm not sure how much
the turnout is gonna be,

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:15.873
if that makes sense.

01:01:15.873 --> 01:01:18.260
I think a lot of people are
leaving the Democratic Party.

01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.450
I think that's the biggest threat to them,

01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:23.463
is that people may not be
on Trump train yet, right?

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:28.640
Trump is like on a SWAT
team where you have the ram.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:30.580
The first person bang through the doors,

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:32.490
shards going everywhere, it's chaos,

01:01:32.490 --> 01:01:34.100
you're throwing flash bangs in there,

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:35.420
everything is confusing,

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:37.720
and then the people that
come in are smooth after him.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.370
Trump is causing a lot of the ruckus.

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:44.680
I believe that you may see
more of it after Trump.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.100
The residual effect of what he has done,

01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:49.670
you'll have more people
actually going to vote

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:52.350
because it is still a scary
moment for black folks

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:54.010
to even say they support Trump.

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:56.297
People like me, what
are you gonna do to me?

01:01:56.297 --> 01:01:59.328
I wear Trump stuff all the
time, what are they gonna do?

01:01:59.328 --> 01:02:00.540
They're not gonna fight me,

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.080
that's not gonna work out well for 'em.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.870
So they don't say stuff
to people like myself,

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:06.450
but if you live in a family or whatever,

01:02:06.450 --> 01:02:07.630
it's very difficult.

01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:09.710
But what I will say is that when I first

01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:11.710
started doing things, about
the same time Candace did,

01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:14.453
me and her met when
she was Red Pill Black.

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:20.660
It was like 90/10 maybe black
folks racially on my page,

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.190
maybe probably even less than that.

01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:24.410
Now it's like 60/40.

01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:25.860
There are so many black
people in my inbox,

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.747
just flooding my inbox,
saying, "Dude, you woke me up.

01:02:28.747 --> 01:02:32.030
"I can't say nothing, my
mama and them would kill me."

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:33.410
Last year, a young black
leader said something,

01:02:33.410 --> 01:02:35.270
I had to call a kid's parent on the phone

01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:36.420
'cause she didn't want her son to go

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.270
'cause it was a conservative thing.

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:40.470
I said, "Ma'am, give that
boy a chance, let him go."

01:02:40.470 --> 01:02:42.300
And she ended up letting
him go to the event.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:45.017
But when he got home, they criticized him.

01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:49.310
I helped him get prepared to
have a speech with this dad.

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:50.710
His dad wanted to have
a sit-down with him,

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:52.680
like you know, how to be a man.

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:55.200
His dad wanted him to sit
down and talk about Trump.

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:56.410
It was just the weirdest thing ever,

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:59.540
but I helped him prepare for
it, but it's very difficult.

01:02:59.540 --> 01:03:01.340
But if you look at any of the polls,

01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:05.020
I'm not a real poll guy 'cause
they say Hillary winning,

01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.130
and I knew she was gonna
lose, and she lost.

01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:09.320
But you can have somewhat of an indication

01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.230
of what people are thinking,

01:03:11.230 --> 01:03:13.310
on the side of saying they're about 20%,

01:03:13.310 --> 01:03:15.480
I don't know, Fox did one around 20%,

01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.500
NAACP did one that people
never talk about around 20%,

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.960
and I think Rasmussen around 30%.

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.940
- What about that moment
during the State of the Union

01:03:25.940 --> 01:03:28.490
when Trump talked about
all-time low black unemployment

01:03:28.490 --> 01:03:30.023
and they showed the picture--

01:03:30.023 --> 01:03:30.856
- The Black Caucus.

01:03:30.856 --> 01:03:33.083
- Of the Congressional Black
Caucus and nobody applauded.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.410
- I don't know how other people felt,

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:38.900
but to me, it really almost
made tears come outta my eyes.

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:39.980
- Yeah, it was disgusting.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:43.793
- It's like, why do we
hate each other so much?

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:48.880
Why do they hate the progression
of black people so much?

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:52.270
You hate your own people so
much, that's how I see it.

01:03:52.270 --> 01:03:54.010
- Well, they wouldn't
need a Caucus much longer.

01:03:54.010 --> 01:03:56.220
You know, Chris Rock, cops
need a certain amount of crime,

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:58.020
which I know is probably
a little touchy for you,

01:03:58.020 --> 01:03:59.250
but every group--
- But it's true.

01:03:59.250 --> 01:04:01.940
- Every group needs a little
something to stay in business,

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.120
and they know that they're
gonna go out of business

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.130
if actually we stop worrying
about what race people are.

01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:09.430
- Right, NAACP, all these
other organizations,

01:04:11.169 --> 01:04:13.400
Al Sharpton, all of them
are gonna be unemployed.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.046
- Yeah, what a pleasure that would be.

01:04:15.046 --> 01:04:17.865
They're gonna be probably
eating outta the trashcan.

01:04:17.865 --> 01:04:20.823
But they need to do these
things, but it hurts people.

01:04:22.418 --> 01:04:24.700
It hurts them, and it helps
people that's on my side,

01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:27.037
because all I can do is
point to them and say,

01:04:27.037 --> 01:04:30.927
"If anything, whether you
disagree, like 'em or not,

01:04:30.927 --> 01:04:33.630
"when you say that black people

01:04:34.608 --> 01:04:39.608
"are having the expression
of historic low unemployment,

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:41.990
"at least do this."
(Dave laughing)

01:04:41.990 --> 01:04:43.636
At least be like...

01:04:43.636 --> 01:04:45.906
- Right, can we get a
snap maybe, something?

01:04:45.906 --> 01:04:48.640
- You sitting there on your hands when...

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:52.540
Listen, they are not a
representation of our ancestors.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:56.000
Martin Luther King would be
rolling in his grave so fast,

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.560
he'd be catching on fire,
he'd be rolling so hard.

01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:02.730
These people are evilness
to our community.

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:04.080
They are dead.

01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.670
It's almost like in the
Bible, the Pharisees

01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:10.380
and all the people who were
the leaders and rulers,

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.670
and they were just doing
all this phony stuff

01:05:12.670 --> 01:05:14.120
and they didn't care
about the people anymore,

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:17.319
and it was all about them
and all their religious,

01:05:17.319 --> 01:05:19.200
all this stuff that don't mean anything.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.320
This is exactly what the black folks

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.430
in these high positions are doing.

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:26.960
How dare you help the black
community when we didn't do it?

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:27.793
You know what I'm saying?

01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:30.000
How dare you show us up?

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.700
It's not about you,

01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:33.580
it's about the young people
that need opportunity.

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.550
So that was a sickening moment
for me, man, but I'm hoping,

01:05:37.550 --> 01:05:39.820
and it's like the house of
cards somebody showed me.

01:05:39.820 --> 01:05:41.970
Everybody have their moment
when their card falling

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:43.110
and it all go down.

01:05:43.110 --> 01:05:45.950
My moment was when Barack
Obama was trashing the police,

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:46.783
the card fell.

01:05:46.783 --> 01:05:48.500
The people's moment is watching

01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:49.780
that Congressional Black Caucus

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.200
sit on their hands and be like...

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:53.270
Y'all really don't care.

01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:54.600
This is a game to y'all.

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.810
Card fell, people are switching.

01:05:56.810 --> 01:05:58.570
- All right, then as a Trump guy,

01:05:58.570 --> 01:06:00.740
I got one more for you to
sorta wrap this all together.

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.670
So for all the people that hear you,

01:06:02.670 --> 01:06:05.460
that hear so much, your
message is so consistent

01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:06.570
with so many things that I talk about,

01:06:06.570 --> 01:06:10.070
about identity politics,
frustrated with the Democrats,

01:06:10.070 --> 01:06:12.460
what's going on with the
Progressives, all of that,

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.327
but there's still a
certain amount of people,

01:06:14.327 --> 01:06:17.250
and I think it's a large
amount of people actually,

01:06:17.250 --> 01:06:19.130
they see all of it and they go

01:06:19.130 --> 01:06:21.230
there's still an aversion to Trump,

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:23.003
to whatever it is that Trump is.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:28.740
Is there anything you think
Trump could do to change that?

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:31.070
- I mean, he's facing a
double-edged sword, right?

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:32.880
If he's not controversial,

01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.840
if he's not standing up for himself,

01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:36.880
they're not gonna cover him properly

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.500
and everybody gonna think he's a monster.

01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.380
He has to go on Twitter
and be controversial,

01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:43.120
he has to draw attention to
himself to a certain degree,

01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.570
which some people don't like.

01:06:44.570 --> 01:06:48.010
But people have to understand
how significant Trump is

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:50.470
in this entire big picture, right?

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:52.600
I don't like everything he does.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.400
I love Trump, man, I'm a Trumpster,

01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:55.870
I don't like everything he does.

01:06:55.870 --> 01:06:57.360
Sometimes I wish he
wouldn't get into fights

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.210
with certain people.

01:06:58.210 --> 01:06:59.690
Some people say it's necessary.

01:06:59.690 --> 01:07:01.830
Sometimes I'm like, come on, man.

01:07:01.830 --> 01:07:04.030
Sometimes when he do some
speeches of whatever,

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:05.540
I wish it was more crisp.

01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:08.400
I wish he was more
charismatic in certain cases.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.950
But I see the bigger picture.

01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:14.420
I'm looking at the Supreme Court justices.

01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.780
I'm looking at policies.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:17.410
I'm looking at him setting a standard

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:19.230
for supporting law
enforcement in this country.

01:07:19.230 --> 01:07:21.840
I'm seeing him set
standards that I'm saying,

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:24.660
okay, I'm okay with you not being perfect,

01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:27.490
but you are opening up so many
more opportunities and doors

01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:28.730
that the next person that come in

01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:30.020
may be a little more polished,

01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.850
but you have saved America in the process.

01:07:32.850 --> 01:07:34.920
I don't expect people
to feel like this man,

01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.060
and nobody does this anyway,

01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.720
they just wanna an excuse
to be mad at Trump,

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.900
the man is not a pastor,
he's not my spiritual leader,

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.120
so I'm not looking to him for morality.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:45.070
Get the doggone job done.

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:47.050
Obama had it all, right?

01:07:47.050 --> 01:07:49.340
Shooting basketball, he was charismatic,

01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.010
he could say and sound
sweet talking people.

01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:51.880
- [Dave] Terrible baller, though.

01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:53.167
- Yeah, he probably sucked at balling

01:07:53.167 --> 01:07:54.796
and probably golf, too.

01:07:54.796 --> 01:07:55.629
(Dave laughing)

01:07:55.629 --> 01:07:58.680
But he was this cool
dude that could talk good

01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.850
and he sound polished and he was hip,

01:08:00.850 --> 01:08:03.120
and the rappers come to the White House.

01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.800
But what did you do based
on what we elected you?

01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:08.830
Nothing, you almost ruined
our country, in my opinion,

01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:11.230
almost set us up for complete failure.

01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:14.070
I don't care what you do
in your personal life.

01:08:14.070 --> 01:08:15.970
What does the job description say?

01:08:15.970 --> 01:08:17.840
Get that done first and then we worry

01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:19.260
about everything else second.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:21.020
I understand people are
gonna be adverse to it,

01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:24.050
and that's why I said
earlier when we were talking

01:08:24.050 --> 01:08:25.570
that Trump is the battering ram

01:08:25.570 --> 01:08:27.780
that's setting up this crescendo effect,

01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:30.990
that once he's gone and another person

01:08:30.990 --> 01:08:34.610
with the mannerisms and the
behaviors of America first

01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:37.780
that can articulate it in
more of a compassionate way,

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:42.540
or more of a personable way, that person,

01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:45.990
all of the seeds that Trump planted,

01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:48.825
the person is gonna water
'em and they're gonna sprout.

01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:51.880
So I understand this is
kind of the way he has to be

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:54.233
to just get the job done.

01:08:54.233 --> 01:08:55.066
- It's been a pleasure, man.

01:08:55.066 --> 01:08:56.190
I'm so glad we finally did this,

01:08:56.190 --> 01:08:58.620
and I have a feeling we will
be out on the road together

01:08:58.620 --> 01:08:59.580
at some point.
- We will be.

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:00.817
So thanks for coming in.
- Thanks for having me.

01:09:00.817 --> 01:09:02.100
- And for more on Brandon,
