00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.828
- Today on Buzzfeed
Unsolved we're covering

00:00:01.828 --> 00:00:03.469
the mysterious deaths of Tupac Shakur

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.389
and Biggie Smalls, starting with Tupac.

00:00:05.389 --> 00:00:07.029
Right now we're on our way to Las Vegas

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.829
and eventually Los Angeles to cover

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:10.649
some of the spots where
this all went down.

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:12.409
As always, I'm Ryan, that's Brent,

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:14.089
and we brought along our friend Daysha

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:15.908
because it felt wrong to
cover Biggie and Tupac

00:00:15.908 --> 00:00:17.528
without bringing a true superfan.

00:00:17.528 --> 00:00:19.969
I'm more of a Tupac fan,
but you know, Biggie's cool.

00:00:19.969 --> 00:00:21.329
- Irrelevant.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.069
- You're irrelevant.

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:24.988
- Anyway, let's get into it.

00:00:24.988 --> 00:00:27.610
- On September 7th 1996 at the MGM

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.926
Grand Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada,

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:32.946
Tupac Shakur attended a
Mike Tyson boxing match.

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:35.627
After the match, Tupac
left with Suge Knight,

00:00:35.627 --> 00:00:38.027
who at the time was
C.E.O. of the west coast

00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:40.226
record label Death Row Records,

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:42.427
the label that Tupac was signed to.

00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:45.286
However, on their way out,
Tupac and his bodyguards

00:00:45.286 --> 00:00:47.487
got into a fight with Orlando Anderson

00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:49.386
in the lobby of the MGM Casino.

00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:50.707
- [Brent] In the lobby?

00:00:50.707 --> 00:00:52.107
- [Ryan] In the lobby of the MGM.

00:00:52.107 --> 00:00:53.981
Orlando Anderson was a member of the

00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:56.141
Compton-based Southside Crips gang.

00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:58.241
After the brawl, Suge
Knight and Tupac left

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:00.221
in Knight's car with Tupac's entourage

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:02.101
following in cars behind them.

00:01:02.101 --> 00:01:04.061
While stopped at a traffic
light at the intersection

00:01:04.061 --> 00:01:06.421
of Flamingo and Koval, a white Cadillac

00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:08.621
pulled up on the passenger
side of Knight's car

00:01:08.621 --> 00:01:11.560
and shot out of the window,
hitting Tupac four times

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.580
and grazing Knight in the
head with a bullet fragment.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.425
In 2014, 18 years after the shooting,

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:20.365
Chris Carroll, a now retired
Las Vegas Police Department

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:22.885
sergeant came forward to say
he was first at the scene.

00:01:31.664 --> 00:01:34.114
- According to Carroll,
when he opened the car door,

00:01:34.114 --> 00:01:36.184
Tupac fell out of the
car covered in blood,

00:01:36.184 --> 00:01:38.504
and Carroll asked, quote, "Who shot you?"

00:01:38.504 --> 00:01:41.164
and states that Tupac
took a breath to respond

00:01:41.164 --> 00:01:43.144
and said, quote, "Fuck you"

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:45.084
before slipping into unconsciousness,

00:01:45.084 --> 00:01:47.124
making those Tupac's last words.

00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:50.264
- [Daysha] Since we're
right here, there's no way.

00:01:50.264 --> 00:01:52.674
- [Brent] What time is it right now?

00:01:52.674 --> 00:01:54.186
- 11:56.

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:57.026
- [Ryan] Look how many
cars right now at 11:56.

00:01:57.026 --> 00:01:59.406
On a Friday that's not nearly
as busy as a Tyson fight.

00:01:59.406 --> 00:02:01.566
- There's no way, if I
heard those gunshots,

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.465
it would just be like, hmm.

00:02:03.465 --> 00:02:04.525
- [Ryan] You'd look where it was, right?

00:02:04.525 --> 00:02:05.505
- Yeah.

00:02:05.505 --> 00:02:07.349
- [Ryan] Tupac was taken to the university

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:09.188
medical center and placed on life support

00:02:09.188 --> 00:02:10.828
in a medically induced coma.

00:02:10.828 --> 00:02:14.268
And on September 13th 1996,
six days after the shooting,

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:17.588
Tupac died due to his
injuries at the age of 25.

00:02:17.588 --> 00:02:19.008
- [Brent] Whoa, 25?

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:20.388
I didn't realize he died so young.

00:02:20.388 --> 00:02:21.747
- [Daysha] Both of 'em died super young.

00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:23.548
- [Ryan] Yeah, he died at
25, Biggie Smalls died at 24.

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:25.268
- [Daysha] I think that's what
was so heartbreaking about it

00:02:25.268 --> 00:02:28.308
is that they were these two
young black males on the rise,

00:02:28.308 --> 00:02:30.267
and they just got snatched up.

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:32.808
- This is where it happened,
this is where he died.

00:02:32.808 --> 00:02:35.568
One strange fact is that
the Las Vegas police

00:02:35.568 --> 00:02:38.028
never arrested anyone in
connection with the murder.

00:02:38.028 --> 00:02:40.508
They also failed to follow
up with Yaki Kadafi,

00:02:40.508 --> 00:02:42.628
a member of Tupac's
entourage who was there

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:45.108
that evening who claimed he
could identify the assailant.

00:02:45.108 --> 00:02:47.888
However, Kadafi was
unfortunately murdered two months

00:02:47.888 --> 00:02:51.308
later on November 10th 1996
before he could be interviewed.

00:02:51.308 --> 00:02:52.428
- [Brent] Wow.

00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:54.428
- [Ryan] A Las Vegas homicide
detective who oversaw the case

00:02:54.428 --> 00:02:56.647
claimed it got "the same treatment

00:02:56.647 --> 00:02:58.408
"as any other homicide here."

00:03:06.128 --> 00:03:08.287
- [Ryan] All right, let's get
to some of the main theories.

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:10.848
The first theory is from
former LA Times journalist

00:03:10.848 --> 00:03:13.528
Chuck Phillips, who believes
that Orlando Anderson,

00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:15.408
the Crips gang, and none other than

00:03:15.408 --> 00:03:17.528
Biggie Smalls are
responsible for the murder.

00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:20.267
Chuck Phillips and the LA
Times investigated the murder

00:03:20.267 --> 00:03:22.187
over the course of a year and came up with

00:03:22.187 --> 00:03:24.707
the following conclusions
based on anonymous sources.

00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:27.607
Conclusion one, members
of the Southside Crips

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:29.747
were involved in the
shooting as retaliation

00:03:29.747 --> 00:03:32.307
for Tupac's beating of Orlando Anderson.

00:03:32.307 --> 00:03:35.927
Conclusion two, Orlando
Anderson was the shooter.

00:03:35.927 --> 00:03:39.167
Conclusion three, Biggie
Smalls paid $1 million

00:03:39.167 --> 00:03:41.727
for the murder of Tupac
and supplied the gun.

00:03:52.487 --> 00:03:54.787
Speaking of Biggie, let's
go over his potential

00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:56.828
motive for wanting Tupac dead.

00:03:56.828 --> 00:03:59.508
Biggie's year-long feud with
Tupac was well known and

00:03:59.508 --> 00:04:02.592
at the forefront of the east
coast, west coast rap rivalry

00:04:02.592 --> 00:04:05.517
including a reported verbal
altercation and diss tracks.

00:04:05.517 --> 00:04:08.636
In one track titled Hit
'Em Up, Tupac claimed

00:04:08.636 --> 00:04:11.116
he had slept with Biggie's
wife, Faith Evans.

00:04:11.116 --> 00:04:12.496
- How does that one go?

00:04:12.496 --> 00:04:14.296
Is that ♫Hit 'em up, hit 'em up ♫

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:15.756
or is that a different one?

00:04:15.756 --> 00:04:17.236
(Daysha laughing)

00:04:17.236 --> 00:04:18.126
I'm actually curious.

00:04:18.126 --> 00:04:19.685
- I think you should
just never do that again.

00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:20.674
- No no no.

00:04:20.674 --> 00:04:22.435
- [Ryan] Strangely, according to Phillips,

00:04:22.435 --> 00:04:23.954
neither Biggie nor anyone connected

00:04:23.954 --> 00:04:25.635
to Biggie was questioned by the police.

00:04:25.635 --> 00:04:28.434
As for Orlando Anderson,
the believed shooter,

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:30.814
he was shot to death in May 1998.

00:04:30.814 --> 00:04:33.034
Up until his death, Anderson denied

00:04:33.034 --> 00:04:35.894
responsibility for Tupac's
death and was never charged.

00:04:35.894 --> 00:04:38.274
The second theory is from former LAPD

00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:40.354
detective Russell Poole, who believes

00:04:40.354 --> 00:04:42.494
that Suge Knight set up the murder.

00:04:42.494 --> 00:04:44.994
Despite Suge Knight also
being hit in the shooting,

00:04:44.994 --> 00:04:47.514
detective Poole believed
Suge Knight had motives.

00:04:47.514 --> 00:04:50.714
Motive one, Suge Knight
apparently owed Tupac

00:04:50.714 --> 00:04:53.574
a lot of money, by some
accounts $3 million,

00:04:53.574 --> 00:04:56.354
a theory corroborated by
the fact that Afeni Shakur,

00:04:56.354 --> 00:04:59.894
Tupac's mother, sued Death
Row and Knight in 1997

00:04:59.894 --> 00:05:01.855
for mishandling funds and taking

00:05:01.855 --> 00:05:03.850
millions of dollars away from Tupac.

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.271
Motive two, Tupac intended to leave

00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:08.631
Death Row Records, Suge Knight's label.

00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:11.271
Tupac had recently fired
his lawyer David Kenner,

00:05:11.271 --> 00:05:13.521
who, in addition to being
Suge Knight's lawyer,

00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:16.343
also wrote up Tupac's agreement
with Death Row Records.

00:05:16.343 --> 00:05:18.722
And sure enough, a week after the firing,

00:05:18.722 --> 00:05:21.421
Suge Knight invited Tupac
to the fateful boxing match.

00:05:21.421 --> 00:05:23.062
Here's some other things that

00:05:23.062 --> 00:05:24.581
don't look good for Suge Knight.

00:05:24.581 --> 00:05:26.781
Shortly after their
brawl in the MGM lobby,

00:05:26.781 --> 00:05:28.361
Knight stopped to make a phone call

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:30.202
while everyone else was fleeing the scene.

00:05:30.202 --> 00:05:32.481
Knight also insisted
that Tupac ride with him

00:05:32.481 --> 00:05:34.441
in his car after the boxing match.

00:05:48.571 --> 00:05:51.081
- [Ryan] Orlando Anderson,
the man who Tupac fought with

00:05:51.081 --> 00:05:53.907
in MGM also contradicted
his initial testimony,

00:05:53.907 --> 00:05:56.540
at first saying Knight
was part of the MGM brawl,

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.940
but then later saying that
Knight was trying to break up

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.580
the fight, stating, "I seen
him pulling people off of me."

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:05.559
Many people believe this turnaround

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.659
happened because of a payoff by Knight.

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.019
Detective Poole also claims
the bullet wound Knight says

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:12.619
he received that night was
never verified by the hospital,

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:15.019
the police, or any other witnesses.

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:24.919
This contradicts the 2014
report from former Las Vegas

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:27.459
police sergeant Chris
Carroll, who stated that

00:06:27.459 --> 00:06:30.581
Knight's head was "gushing
blood" and that he had

00:06:30.581 --> 00:06:32.861
"clearly been hit in the head."

00:06:32.861 --> 00:06:35.921
Carroll also mentioned that
Knight showed legitimate concern

00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:38.891
and that "it wasn't acting."

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.640
"This is not the guy who had
him killed, it's ridiculous."

00:07:19.548 --> 00:07:21.908
- [Ryan] The third theory
is from LAPD detective

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:24.047
Greg Kading, who believes that Sean Combs,

00:07:24.047 --> 00:07:27.888
a.k.a. P. Diddy or Puff Daddy
and C.E.O. of the east coast

00:07:27.888 --> 00:07:31.448
record label Bad Boy Records
orchestrated Tupac's death.

00:07:31.448 --> 00:07:34.568
Detective Kading got a Crips
gang member named Keith Davis

00:07:34.568 --> 00:07:38.108
to confess on tape that P.
Diddy paid him $1 million

00:07:38.108 --> 00:07:41.088
to carry out the murder
of Tupac and Suge Knight.

00:07:41.088 --> 00:07:43.568
Keith Davis confessed
that Orlando Anderson,

00:07:43.568 --> 00:07:46.288
who was Davis' nephew, was the
one who pulled the trigger,

00:07:46.288 --> 00:07:48.608
and Davis also admits to being in the car

00:07:48.608 --> 00:07:51.008
when he recounts the
night that Tupac was shot.

00:07:58.488 --> 00:08:01.027
Keith Davis claims the
motive behind P. Diddy's hit

00:08:01.027 --> 00:08:03.428
was due to fear that Suge
Knight would strike first,

00:08:03.428 --> 00:08:06.148
and that Tupac was only
included in the hit because

00:08:06.148 --> 00:08:09.028
P. Diddy was pissed off about
Tupac's song Hit 'Em Up.

00:08:09.028 --> 00:08:11.468
Furthermore, before Tupac was killed,

00:08:11.468 --> 00:08:14.988
he was shot multiple times
on November 30th 1994

00:08:14.988 --> 00:08:17.368
at Quad Recording
Studios in New York City.

00:08:17.368 --> 00:08:19.948
Tupac repeatedly stated
that he suspected people

00:08:19.948 --> 00:08:22.248
associated with P. Diddy
were the perpetrators,

00:08:22.248 --> 00:08:25.168
a suspicion corroborated
by a 2011 confession

00:08:25.168 --> 00:08:27.708
from Dexter Isaac, who
claimed he was hired

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:30.548
by a P. Diddy associate
to rob Tupac that night.

00:08:30.548 --> 00:08:32.248
However, P. Diddy has denied

00:08:32.248 --> 00:08:34.198
involvement in the murder, stating,

00:08:38.168 --> 00:08:40.648
And for what it's worth,
Keith Davis was reportedly

00:08:40.648 --> 00:08:42.988
looking at 25 years to
life due to unrelated

00:08:42.988 --> 00:08:45.368
activities if he didn't
reveal his secrets.

00:08:56.688 --> 00:08:59.198
- [Ryan] The next theory is
that the Jewish Defense League,

00:09:12.757 --> 00:09:15.077
The next theory is that
the Jewish Defense League,

00:09:15.077 --> 00:09:17.657
and extremist pro-Israel
group, killed Tupac.

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:20.937
The FBI had files of alleged
death threats on Tupac

00:09:20.937 --> 00:09:23.537
from the Jewish Defense League,
which has been classified

00:09:23.537 --> 00:09:25.677
as a terrorist group by the FBI.

00:09:25.677 --> 00:09:27.958
Other than that, there's
really not much to see here.

00:09:34.817 --> 00:09:37.218
The last theory I'm gonna
go over is pretty silly.

00:09:44.457 --> 00:09:46.338
Some believe that Tupac is in fact

00:09:46.338 --> 00:09:48.177
still alive and faked his own death.

00:09:48.177 --> 00:09:51.137
In 2015, some news outlets
reported that a man

00:09:51.137 --> 00:09:54.079
named David Myers claimed he
helped Tupac fake his death

00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:56.929
and that Suge Knight, among
others, helped as well.

00:09:56.929 --> 00:09:59.608
However, this story seems
to have originated from

00:09:59.608 --> 00:10:02.628
a fake news site, so take it
with an enormous grain of salt.

00:10:02.628 --> 00:10:04.871
Some believe Tupac is
alive and well in Cuba.

00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:18.568
It seems clear to me why it's unsolved.

00:10:18.568 --> 00:10:20.868
There's a lot of holes,
there's a lot of eyewitness

00:10:20.868 --> 00:10:22.588
and a lot of people who aren't talking.

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:24.389
- [Daysha] Who would have enough power

00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:27.049
to get all of these people
to not say anything?

00:10:27.049 --> 00:10:28.648
- [Ryan] Who killed Tupac?

00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:29.748
That'll do it for today.

00:10:29.748 --> 00:10:30.868
We're gonna stay the night in Vegas,

00:10:30.868 --> 00:10:32.328
and we'll pick it back up
tomorrow when we're gonna

00:10:32.328 --> 00:10:34.248
drive to Los Angeles and discuss
the death of Biggie Smalls.

00:10:34.248 --> 00:10:35.988
So, see you then.

00:10:35.988 --> 00:10:37.328
- Cheers.

00:10:38.648 --> 00:10:43.228
(dissonant music)

00:10:43.228 --> 00:10:44.788
- I've lost $14.

00:10:44.788 --> 00:10:46.208
- I won three bucks!

00:10:46.208 --> 00:10:47.728
- Fuck.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.169
Fuck!
