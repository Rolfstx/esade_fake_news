Airlines can make a lot of money by flying

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.110
to the right places. British Airways, for
example, long-ago cemented themselves as the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.680
leader on the London Heathrow to New York
JFK route and flying between these two airports

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.420
now earns them over $1 billion per year. That’s
more than any airline makes on any other route

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.349
in the world. Conversely, though, airlines
can lose a lot of money by flying to the wrong

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.180
places. American Airlines, for example, recently
cancelled their Chicago to Beijing flight

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.590
as it was loosing them tens of millions of
dollars per year. Now, the fact that this

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.500
route failed might be puzzling considering
it flew between the world’s fiftieth and

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.510
the world seventh largest city. Even more,
they were flying the 787-8 Dreamliner—the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.240
smallest plane they could on this route. Nonetheless,
it was truly a financial disaster. The airline

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:00.230
said that, in terms of annual revenue, the
route was $80 million away from their target.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.280
The truth is that deciding where to fly is
a lot more complicated than pairing up the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.410
largest cities. It’s an art that people
spend their whole lives mastering and the

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.690
difference between an airline that’s good
at route planning and one that’s bad at

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.870
it can be the difference between a profitable
airline and a defunct one.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.020
In 2015, the big three airlines in the US—American,
Delta, and United—launched 101 new routes.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.420
These included everything from United’s
new 30-minute regional flight between Chicago

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.940
and Kalamazoo to Delta’s new transpacific
service between Los Angeles and Shanghai.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.550
Some of these 101 survived, some did not.
Of the routes that Delta launched in 2015,

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.220
about 70% still fly today. There were some
big, noticeable cancellations from their 2015-launched

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.920
routes including Orlando to Sao Paolo, New
York to Manchester, and Philadelphia to London.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.430
Meanwhile, American Airlines did a little
better with 76% of their 2015 routes surviving

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.530
today. Still, they clearly had some expensive
failures with routes like Dallas to Quito,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.110
Miami to Frankfurt, and New York to Birmingham.
United Airlines, though, has a noticeably

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.759
higher 85% of those 2015 routes still flying
today. The only four routes from 2015 that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.390
didn’t work out were Houston to Peoria,
Newark to Newcastle, Dulles to Moline, and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.780
Denver to San Jose. Now, it’s worth noting
that the survival of routes is not the one,

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.140
definitive measure of how good airlines are
at route planning. Different companies might

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.930
have different risk tolerances, they might
wait out a route longer, there are a lot of

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.400
other factors involved, but there is other
evidence that United is good at route planning.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.400
There are a number of destinations that United
is the sole American airline to operate to.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.200
Just looking at long-haul destinations, that
includes Melbourne, Tahiti, Taipei, Chengdu,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.950
Delhi, Mumbai, Naples, Porto, and Stockholm.
In some of these cases, there might be just

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.630
enough traffic to support one US airline flying
there and United got there first. In addition,

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.900
there are plenty of routes that United flies
without non-stop competition like Denver to

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.530
Tokyo, Houston to Rio de Janeiro, DC to Zurich,
and Chicago to Edinburgh. Many of these potentially

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.040
riskier routes have survived for years so
they’re clearly good at route planning.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.540
They’re clearly good at finding the opportunities
both big and small.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.840
According to United, the two major factors
they look at when deciding where to fly are,

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.250
“how many people want to go there, and how
much are they willing to pay?” These questions

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.709
are easy to ask but extremely difficult to
answer—that’s why it’s people’s whole

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.430
jobs. For figuring how many people want to
go to a place, the airline itself has a decent

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.180
amount of data. The majority of new United
routes are to destinations already served

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.470
by another one of their hubs. For example,
one of the routes that United added in 2015

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.640
was from Denver to Southwest Oregon Regional
Airport which was already served by its San

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.300
Francisco hub. Given that, United already
had data on how many people flew there from

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.350
Denver via San Francisco and would therefore
take a non-stop flight. United also flies

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.960
to a number of places non-stop from Denver
that it doesn’t from San Francisco such

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:03.489
as Albuquerque, Sioux Falls, and Wichita that
would now have a one-stop option to Southwest

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.940
Oregon Regional Airport rather than a two
stop. For brand new destinations, though,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.110
especially long-haul ones, United doesn’t
have its own passenger figures so they have

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.549
to figure out how many people want to go there
through other means. One of the great assets

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:20.829
that travel booking sites like Expedia, Google
Flights, and Skyscanner have is that they

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.710
know where people want to fly. They know which
city-pairs people search for flights between

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.340
and many sell this incredibly valuable data
to market research companies and airlines.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.599
Skyscanner, for example, knows that 190,000
people a year search for a flight between

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:39.630
Birmingham and Hong Kong, 420,000 people a
year search for a flight between Delhi and

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:43.770
Auckland, 1.1 million people a year search
for a flight between Bangkok and Barcelona,

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.740
and 1.4 million people a year search for a
flight between London and Kochi. These all

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.360
represent big opportunities that airlines
have yet to act on. People are still making

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.080
these trips but having to connect. Creating
a non-stop flight on any of these routes would

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.439
capture a decent amount of the traffic.
The reason some of these popular routes do

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:05.910
not have non-stop service, though, comes down
to that second factor—how much people are

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.819
willing to pay. People usually pay a premium
to fly on non-stop flights, but there’s

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:16.259
a maximum to how much extra people will pay
for the convenience. In October 2017, United

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:20.809
launched a new nonstop route from Los Angeles
to Singapore to much fanfare. This would be

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:24.919
the airline’s longest ever route, the only
non-stop connection between the two cities,

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:30.740
and they expected it to do great. The problem,
though, was the competition. Currently, roundtrip

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.889
connecting flights between Los Angeles and
Singapore are on sale for as little as $444.

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.379
At the time that United was flying this route,
they were supposedly even less. United just

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:45.449
couldn’t come close to the prices that others
were offering and, exactly a year after this

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:49.969
route was launched, it was cancelled. It wasn’t
a complete failure—they ended up just adding

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:54.939
a second frequency to Singapore from San Francisco—but
it is an example of a route that looked great

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:59.399
on paper but didn’t work out in reality.
It was a similar reason that likely led to

00:05:59.399 --> 00:06:03.639
the cancellation of the American flight from
Chicago to Beijing mentioned at the beginning.

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.839
It was just too tough to compete against the
low fares of Asian airlines and, as a result,

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:13.050
American’s planes were crossing the Pacific
empty. In all, airlines need to figure out

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.919
what people will pay for a route to figure
out if it’s profitable and also if it’s

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:21.330
going to be the most profitable route they
can add. Part of the reason why American and

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.650
Delta might not have added a nonstop flight
to Singapore is because they can make more

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.800
money using the same plane elsewhere. United
essentially has now used up four of its planes

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.740
to fly its two daily flights to Singapore.
They’re charging a minimum of about $800

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.969
to fly roundtrip on this 16-hour flight whereas,
from the east coast, United is also charging

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:46.430
about $800 to fly roundtrip on their 6-hour
flight from DC to London. Airlines need to

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.889
consider whether, out of a whole world of
options, they’re picking the best one when

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:54.610
adding a route.
Beyond these two main factors, there are others

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.740
involved in whether or not a route will work
financially. For example, while a certain

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.869
route might work for one airline, the exact
same route might not work for another. From

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:08.599
Australia, there are three routes to mainland
China operated by Australian airlines—Qantas

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:13.839
from Sydney to Beijing and Shanghai and Jetstar
from Melbourne to Zhengzhou. Meanwhile, from

00:07:13.839 --> 00:07:20.250
mainland China, there are 43 routes to Australia
operated by Chinese airlines. This extreme

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.839
imbalance exists because people tend to prefer
to fly on airlines from their home country

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:29.639
especially in cases like this where the language
is different. There are far more Chinese traveling

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:34.569
to Australia than Australians traveling to
China so, therefore, there are far more Chinese

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:39.300
airlines flying to Australia than vice versa.
Of course there are other factors involved

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:43.569
such as, given the lower cost of living in
China, Chinese airlines have lower labor costs

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:47.270
and are therefore able to offer lower fares,
but when an airline is figuring out whether

00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:51.990
a route will work, the nationality and directionality
of travelers does matter.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:57.129
Sometimes, though, a route is launched that
just doesn’t make financial since—at least

00:07:57.129 --> 00:08:02.840
independently. Sometimes airlines launch routes
primarily to slow the advance of a competitor.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.189
For example, on September 6th, 2017, Wow Air,
the Icelandic budget airline, announced that

00:08:08.189 --> 00:08:13.289
it would start flying from Reykjavik to Dallas.
Less than a week later, Icelandair, the other

00:08:13.289 --> 00:08:18.270
major Icelandic airline, announced that they
too would start flying from Reykjavik to Dallas.

00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:22.429
About a month after that, American Airlines
announced that they would also start flying

00:08:22.429 --> 00:08:28.669
to Reykjavik from Dallas. Now, Dallas is very
much a fortress hub for American Airlines.

00:08:28.669 --> 00:08:33.080
That is, they control a huge percentage of
the market share there and they want it to

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.099
stay that way. They didn’t want their customers
to start flying on Wow or Icelandair to Iceland

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:43.080
or, more importantly, beyond to Europe. While
Iceland has seen a significant increase in

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:47.260
tourism traffic over the past decade, there
are a few signs signaling that this route

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:51.560
addition might have been more for competitive
purposes than because it was the best financial

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:56.310
choice independently. The first is the suspicious
timing, announcing quite soon after the two

00:08:56.310 --> 00:09:00.490
other airlines did, and the other is that
it really doesn’t make sense for American’s

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:05.460
one and only Iceland flight to leave from
Dallas. This requires all connecting travelers

00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.440
from the east half of the country to backtrack
to Dallas if they want to fly on American

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.940
to Iceland. The airline has, in recent years,
concentrated most of their transatlantic flights

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:19.000
going to leisure-oriented destinations, such
as Iceland, to their Philadelphia hub but,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:24.190
in this case, it was clearly most likely more
about stopping Wow and Icelandair. In this,

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:29.310
American was successful. Both of its competitors
have since stopped flying to Dallas. While

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:33.310
this and other similar routes might not make
money themselves, overall they’re the right

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:37.580
decision for the company since they can force
a competitor out of the market and, in this

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:41.900
case, passengers that might have connected
on Wow or Icelandair from Dallas to Europe

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.640
would now take American’s transatlantic
flights.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:49.270
So, once all of that analysis happens, once
an airline decides that it’s a good idea

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:53.620
to launch a route, it still doesn’t mean
that an airline can go ahead and start flying.

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.120
Obviously, they need a spare plane. That can
either come from another route cancellation

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.880
or through a new aircraft delivery. For example,
United’s new route from San Francisco to

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:10.240
Tahiti, with relatively low demand, required
its smallest long-haul plane—the 787-8 Dreamliner.

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.810
One of those only became available when a
new 787-9 was delivered from Boeing that replaced

00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:20.160
an older 787-8 on the busier San Francisco
to Munich route. Airlines also need gate space

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:25.460
and, at some busy airports, a landing slot.
For many international routes, airlines also

00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:30.590
need government approval to begin a new flight.
There’s plenty more uninteresting bureaucracy

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:35.030
but then, sometime, usually years after an
airline first examines whether a route will

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.690
make sense, the first plane will take off
between those two airports. No matter how

00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:44.310
much work is put into analyzing whether a
route will work, reality always has unforeseen

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:49.531
variables. The true test of whether a route
will work is actually flying the route. Once

00:10:49.531 --> 00:10:54.450
that happens, airlines will evaluate its performance.
If it’s making enough money, it will keep

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:59.140
flying. If it’s not, it usually will not.
This is all part o f airlines’ continuous

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.910
cycle of planning, launching, and evaluating
routes in order to find the few that can actually

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:07.850
turn a profit in this notoriously financially
difficult industry.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:12.900
If you’re watching this video, there are
two things that you almost certainly like—documentaries

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:18.440
and aviation. Therefore, I would imagine you
would like this documentary on Curiosity Stream

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:22.800
about the whole process that it takes to make
an Airbus a380 wing. It’s a fascinating

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:26.780
look at all the work that goes into producing
what is perhaps the most important element

00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:32.160
of that plane. This is one of over 2,400 documentaries
that you can watch on CuriosityStream which

00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.610
is compatible with iOS, Android, Xbox One,
Chromecast, AppleTV, and plenty more platforms.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:42.740
It’s also quite reasonably priced at only
