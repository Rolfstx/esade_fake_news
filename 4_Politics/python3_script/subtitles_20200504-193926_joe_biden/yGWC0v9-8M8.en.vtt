00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:19.659
This project began as an idea proposed by my then 21 year old son who over dinner one winter night said

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.809
You know dad we should build a small cabin on the lake this summer

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.279
It'd be a great place for guests to stay during hunting season, so they don't have to sleep in the barn

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.219
I knew this would be a rather large undertaking

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.029
Likely much more than a casual few weekends over the summer

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.649
But I threw caution and aged wisdom to the side and agreed to give it a go

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.908
Running electricity to the site would be very costly and challenging

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.999
The issue is the site's over a mile from the nearest road

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:51.699
The cabin would have to be off the grid which added a whole new dimension to the challenge of building the cabin

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.009
But once built it offered yet another challenge of living without electricity from the grid

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:04.839
Such begins this journey and it generally starts with an idea and culminates with a finished project

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.800
In order to begin you need a building site my case was about a mile off the road the only

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.380
Access to it was on a small little two-track

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.220
All my materials would have to come in and out on an ATV in a small trailer that gets pulled behind it

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.090
Next come your plans

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.350
my recommendation is that you put your measurements down on papers so that you have something to follow and most your

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.540
Calculations are done in advance

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.269
After that, I suggest that you actually cut out

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.099
Little cutouts of the parameters of your cabin put it down on paper as shown

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.429
So that you can get a relative feel for where your windows will go where your stove will go where your bunk in bed will

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.749
Go this will give you a good feel for how spacious and how everything fits

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.429
This shown here is not my actual finished plan that gives an idea of what it looked like as I went through this process

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.839
Next come your layout where you'll install your support posts that are going to support the entire structure. I

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.170
marked them out on the ground and then used a

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.580
PTO drive a tractor to drill these holes

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.159
Where I'm situated in northern, Michigan, we need about 48 inches below ground

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.890
So my holes had to be dug

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.849
Using my pulse driller that had to be finished using a hand

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.650
post hole digger

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.799
that was quite a bit of work, but once it was done he ended up with

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.839
everything exactly the way it was he didn't have to worry about frosty being in the winner's I

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.069
Should mention all the wood on this project was cut with a thirty-five hundred watt gasoline-powered

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.569
generator and

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.659
Most of the nailing was done with past load framing nailer, which I highly recommend

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.420
investment well-made

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.169
Here you might wonder why the posts in the front are so much called than the others

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.670
the reason is is those are actually gonna support the roof off of my front porch the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:24.419
Other just support the floor on the structure of the cabin itself, but the longer posts are for the porch

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.700
The only significant mishap we had in the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.819
Construction of the cabin was the jackknife of an ATV with a heavy trailer behind it going down a rather steep hill

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.569
This is what it looks like. Fortunately. No one was hurt and no equipment was seriously damaged in the process

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.839
Here you'll see the insulation of the floor you'll notice we use two different types of materials you might ask why

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.010
sometimes

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.289
Compromise is an easy way to settle disputes between those that are helping you on a project

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:31.079
Messiest part of the job for sure was crawling underneath the structure to install plywood to keep the insulation from falling through the floor

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.960
Thank You Craig for doing this

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.909
Time for the walls to go up

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.069
Now the sheeting goes on

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:21.309
Now time for the Rich Beem to go on

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.979
And now the roof choice

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.730
You may notice in several of the photos there's a scaffold inside the cabin this made a lot of the work inside a lot easier

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.140
You may want to rent one or borrow one from a friend if you know somebody that has one

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.249
Now the purlins go on the roof joists

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.040
One morning on the job site

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.379
We found that a local beaver decided to make dinner out of one of the lakes from one of our ladders

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.480
Next we'll cut holes in the sheeting for our windows

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:54.450
If there's one thing I've learned from this project is sometimes things take a very long time to do

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.440
Patience is a virtue and be sure to make time to just lay back. Look at the sky and soak it all up

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.870
I couldn't wait for the roofs to finally go on

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:15.450
a

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:22.969
Part of this project. I disliked the most was boxing out the soffits, but I was able to struggle through it and get it done

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.780
You start to feel like things are really coming together when your windows and doors are installed

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.120
And you start to put on your front porch

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:42.299
Autumn is a good time to start the insulation work on the inside of the cabin

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:51.960
Thank You Craig for putting in the stairs here you'll see the floor joists are installed for the loft

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.390
Heating the cabin comes from a box wood stove

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.869
It's placed on top of cinder blocks as shown

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.239
And the ductwork has run through the wall and then off the outside of the cabin

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:35.810
Okay, so now a word about solar I use 2 100 watt solar panels which charge a deep-cycle solar battery

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:40.700
Via charge controller the solar panels can be acquired via multiple online sources

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.450
And the battery I obtained I purchased from Amazon

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:51.529
Make sure that you use a solar charger to prevent overcharging at the battery the entire system cost me right around

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:59.420
900 dollars and that does not include the costs that I pay for my 12 volt fixtures, which I purchased on eBay

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.940
Most of my lighting is very low amperage LED lights similar to this

00:10:05.459 --> 00:10:07.459
And I used a switch panel

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:13.640
Which I purchased from eBay to control the lights so they could be turned on and off individually

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.290
It's been 2 years running now, and I've used the cabin for as much as a week at a time

00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.690
And I've never dropped my battery

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.300
storage below 70%

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.700
you can even include a

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:31.760
Ceiling fan like I have used here, which is 12 volt and also runs on very low amperage

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.760
The key is to use low amperage fixtures

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:42.950
You can even buy these 12-volt strip lights which are very efficient and very low cost. They cost about five dollars a piece

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:50.010
After all the insulation is done then you can start putting on the sheeting on your walls

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.920
And finish up your electric

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:58.979
One of the things that I did as well as I use these twelve volt chargers that you can plug a cigarette lighter

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.619
into as well as USB ports, I

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:08.400
Strategically put these around the cabin where the bunks are gonna be so that people can charge their cell phones etc at night

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.700
I put concrete board and lading behind the wood stove and then stoned it in using river rock

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.870
To prevent a fire protected barrier between the wood stove in the wall

00:11:42.499 --> 00:11:49.069
I use tongue-and-groove laminate flooring for the loft and then mixed it up and used a slightly different brand

00:11:49.499 --> 00:11:51.499
for the main cabin area

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:12.229
Here you'll see I use steel roofing as wainscoting on the walls at the end of the cabinet's near the wood stove

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:19.790
This adds a nice warm feeling and reflects some of that heat. It also keeps it cool makes it feel cool during the summer months

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.309
Next comes the painting the exterior boards

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.689
I used a three coat system a primer followed by two top coats

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:36.290
It gives it a very nice warm look to it product. I use is from sickens called C tall

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.929
A nice rainy day is a good day to build some bunk frames

00:12:45.930 --> 00:12:53.820
And these I just assembled together using dimensional lumber and a power planer the power planer gives it a nice distressed look

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:41.029
May have noticed there's a black strip between the moisture barrier and the siding that black strip is kind of a woven

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.189
plastic mesh that helps the

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:50.480
Siding breathe and prevent moisture build-up behind it whether or not it'll actually work is yet to be seen

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.089
And I will probably never know in my lifetime

00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:46.609
Here's a good look at my solar battery as you can see I built it underneath my kitchen cabinet

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.560
These light fixtures on either side of the door are just regular 120 volt fixtures and

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:08.540
Inside of them. I put a 12-volt light bulb that fits into the same socket. You can obtain that on eBay as well

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.800
You
