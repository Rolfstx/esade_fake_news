so<00:24:23.470><c> I</c><00:24:23.500><c> think</c><00:24:23.680><c> that's</c><00:24:23.980><c> one</c><00:24:24.220><c> that's</c><00:24:24.520><c> one</c><00:24:24.850><c> factor</c>

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:25.390 align:start position:0%
so I think that's one that's one factor
 

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.270 align:start position:0%
so I think that's one that's one factor
here<00:24:25.690><c> so</c><00:24:25.810><c> there's</c><00:24:26.110><c> something</c><00:24:26.260><c> historical</c><00:24:27.130><c> and</c>
