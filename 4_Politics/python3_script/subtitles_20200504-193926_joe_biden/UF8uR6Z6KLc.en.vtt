 This program comes to you from Stanford University, please visit us on the site above 

00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:21.053
 clap 

00:00:21.053 --> 00:00:22.084
 Thank you 

00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:26.081
 (Steve Jobs - CEO of Apple and Pixar) 

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:32.012
 I am honored to meet you today, to start you at one of the oldest universities in the world 

00:00:32.012 --> 00:00:35.054
 acclaim 

00:00:36.004 --> 00:00:45.057
 In fact, I have never graduated from college and this is the closest thing I have ever had as a university graduate. 

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:47.096
 [Laughter] 

00:00:48.014 --> 00:00:54.026
 Today, I want to tell you three stories from my life. This is nothing big just three stories. 

00:00:55.061 --> 00:00:59.003
 The first story is about connecting points. 

00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:08.019
 She withdrew from the University of Reed after the first six months, then remained on the decline for about eighteen months or so, before I actually resigned. 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.083
 The question why pulled out? 

00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:13.094
 It all started before I was born 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.027
 My biological mom was a young single graduate, and she decided to put me up for adoption. 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.088
 I felt strongly that I had to be adopted by college graduates, 

00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:30.066
 So everything was intended for me to be adopted at birth by my lawyer and his wife. 

00:01:31.073 --> 00:01:36.054
 However, the moment I leave and at the last minute, the couple decided that they wanted a girl. 

00:01:37.082 --> 00:01:42.034
 Until my parents, who were waiting, got a call in the middle of the night asking: 

00:01:43.018 --> 00:01:49.020
 "We've got an unexpected baby, do you want it?" They said: "Of course." 

00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:58.024
 My biological mom later discovered that my adoptive mother had never graduated from any university and my father had never graduated from high school. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.077
 At the time, she refused to sign the latest adoption papers. 

00:02:03.027 --> 00:02:11.067
 After a few months, I gave in, when my adoptive parents made a pledge to go to university. This was the beginning of my life. 

00:02:13.064 --> 00:02:21.045
 After seventeen years, I really went to university. But naively I chose an expensive university like Stanford University, 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.058
 All my working-class parents' savings were spent on my college education. 

00:02:27.055 --> 00:02:30.017
 Six months later, I can no longer see the benefit of this. 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.074
 I had no idea what I wanted to do in my life nor how the university would help me find out. 

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:40.085
 And here I had spent all my parents' savings that they had collected all their lives. 

00:02:42.047 --> 00:02:46.079
 So I decided to withdraw and I was confident that everything would be good. 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.024
 It was pretty scary at the same time, but looking back, it was one of my best choices. 

00:02:52.093 --> 00:02:53.099
 [Laughter] 

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:59.007
 The moment I pulled out I could stop taking classes that didn't interest me, 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.050
 And to start falling on those that interest me the most. 

00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:13.082
 Not all were romantic. I did not have a bedroom, I slept on the floor in friends ’rooms, and I exchanged Coca-Cola bottles for 5 cents to buy food in them. 

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:21.031
 I was able to walk seven miles across the city every Sunday night to get one good meal at Harry Krishna Temple. 

00:03:21.094 --> 00:03:23.020
 I love that 

00:03:23.067 --> 00:03:29.072
 Many of the things I stumbled by following my intuition and curiosity later revealed to me that they were worthless 

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:31.035
 An example is: 

00:03:32.075 --> 00:03:37.080
 Red University at the time exhibited the city's best educational handwriting 

00:03:38.025 --> 00:03:44.063
 Everywhere on campus and every poster, and in every staircase, it was beautiful handwriting. 

00:03:45.016 --> 00:03:52.048
 Because I pulled out and didn't take the regular classes, I decided to join the line learning classes. 

00:03:52.087 --> 00:03:59.028
 I learned about thin letters and without thin letters, and about the difference in the distance between the different letters, 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.035
 And solutions to what makes great printing great. 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:11.002
 She was beautiful, historical, artistic, accurate in a way that science could not capture, and found her charming. 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.023
 None of this had even had hope of being applied in my working life. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.097
 But after ten years when we were designing the first Makitosh computer, it all came back to me. 

00:04:23.022 --> 00:04:28.061
 And we designed everything with Mac OS. The first computer was a beautiful typography. 

00:04:29.007 --> 00:04:32.036
 If I hadn't taken back one course at the university, 

00:04:32.048 --> 00:04:36.054
 Mac wouldn't have multiple lines and relative spacing for fonts. 

00:04:37.016 --> 00:04:42.023
 And because Windows has copied the fonts from Mac, it is possible that there is neither a personal computer nor a PC. 

00:04:42.046 --> 00:04:49.038
 [Laughing and applause] 

00:04:49.057 --> 00:04:53.088
 If I hadn't withdrawn, I wouldn't have entered the class learning the line, 

00:04:54.006 --> 00:04:56.086
 Personal computers did not have these beautiful fonts that you work on. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.019
 Of course it was impossible to connect the points I was looking forward to when I was in college. 

00:05:02.057 --> 00:05:06.034
 But it was very, very clear looking back after ten years. 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:12.010
 Again, you cannot tie the points by looking forward: only when you look back you can connect them. 

00:05:12.049 --> 00:05:16.023
 So you have to trust that the points will somehow relate to your future. 

00:05:16.058 --> 00:05:21.013
 You have to trust something - your courage, your destiny, the consequence of life, whatever it is. 

00:05:21.052 --> 00:05:27.051
 Because believing that the points will be connected to the path of your life will give you confidence to follow your heart, 

00:05:27.073 --> 00:05:32.011
 Even when it drives you out of the well-known road, which would make the difference. 

00:05:37.097 --> 00:05:42.025
 My second story is about love and loss. 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.053
 I was lucky - I found the thing I loved to do early in life. 

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:51.015
 Wooz and I started with Apple in the garage of Alday when I was twenty years old. 

00:05:51.061 --> 00:05:59.030
 We worked hard, and within ten years, Apple had grown from just two who worked in a garage to a company estimated at two billion dollars with a number of employees exceeding four thousand employees. 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.077
 We were just unveiling our best - Macintosh - a year ago, and it just turned thirty. 

00:06:05.093 --> 00:06:07.016
 Then I was fired. 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.011
 How do you get fired from a company you built? 

00:06:12.034 --> 00:06:18.003
 Well, when Apple was getting older I hired someone I thought was talented to run the company with me, 

00:06:18.025 --> 00:06:20.062
 For a year or so, things were going well 

00:06:20.083 --> 00:06:25.009
 But then our vision for the future began to divide, and ultimately we failed. 

00:06:25.025 --> 00:06:28.022
 When we failed, the board members stood in his side. 

00:06:28.044 --> 00:06:32.035
 And this is when I was thirty, I was expelled. And in a very open way. 

00:06:32.082 --> 00:06:37.044
 The center of my life as an adult was not gone, and it was destroyed. 

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:40.005
 I really didn't know what to do in the coming months 

00:06:40.072 --> 00:06:46.099
 I felt like I had let down the previous generation of business - that I dropped the stick while it was being passed to me. 

00:06:47.058 --> 00:06:53.023
 I met David Packard and Bob Noice and tried to apologize for my severe failure. 

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:57.066
 I was publicly unsuccessful, and I even thought of running away from the place. 

00:06:57.097 --> 00:07:03.028
 But slowly something appeared to me - I still love what I do. 

00:07:03.097 --> 00:07:10.065
 The turn of events at Apple has never changed, I have been rejected, but I still love what I do. 

00:07:11.064 --> 00:07:13.030
 So I decided to start over. 

00:07:14.034 --> 00:07:20.044
 I did not see her at the time, but it became clear to me that my expulsion from Apple was the best thing that could happen to me. 

00:07:20.068 --> 00:07:27.012
 The weight of my success has been replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, and less sure of everything. 

00:07:27.082 --> 00:07:30.044
 It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. 

00:07:31.014 --> 00:07:35.048
 Over the next five years, I started with a company I named Next, and another one named Pixar. 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.063
 I fell in love with the most amazing woman to be my wife later. 

00:07:38.093 --> 00:07:47.052
 Pixar's direction was to create the first computer animation movie, game story, and is now the most successful animation studio of the year. 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.044
 [Applause and rejoicing] 

00:07:49.044 --> 00:07:54.058
 In a noticeable turn of events, Apple bought Next, and so I returned to Apple, 

00:07:54.076 --> 00:07:58.084
 The technology we developed at Next is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance. 

00:07:59.026 --> 00:08:02.050
 Lauren is my wife and I have a wonderful family together 

00:08:03.031 --> 00:08:07.013
 I am very sure that none of these things would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. 

00:08:07.057 --> 00:08:11.014
 It was awful to taste the medicine, but I think the patient needs it. 

00:08:11.094 --> 00:08:15.074
 Sometimes life beats us on the head with a brick. 

00:08:15.097 --> 00:08:21.031
 do not lose hope . I am convinced that the thing that kept me going was my love for what I do. 

00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:26.098
 You have to find what you love. This is true for work as it is for those you love. 

00:08:27.063 --> 00:08:34.042
 Your work will fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is a great job. 

00:08:34.068 --> 00:08:38.040
 The only way to do a great job is to love what you do. 

00:08:38.073 --> 00:08:42.065
 If you haven't found it yet, keep looking and don't calm down. 

00:08:43.006 --> 00:08:46.050
 As with all matters of the heart, you will know when you find the right job. 

00:08:46.069 --> 00:08:51.057
 And like any special relationship, you will get the best and the best over time. 

00:08:51.077 --> 00:08:54.028
 So keep looking and don't live. 

00:08:57.046 --> 00:09:04.045
 [ clap ] 

00:09:04.073 --> 00:09:07.061
 My third story is about death. 

00:09:08.073 --> 00:09:12.006
 When I was seventeen years old, I read a quote that contains something like this: 

00:09:12.053 --> 00:09:17.071
 "If you lived every day as if it were the last day of your life, there will come a day when you will be right." 

00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:19.075
 [Laughter] 

00:09:20.035 --> 00:09:27.056
 This had a huge impact on myself, and since that time, over the past thirty-three years, I look in the mirror every morning and ask myself: 

00:09:27.086 --> 00:09:33.021
 "If today had been the last day of my life - would I have done what I intend to do on this day?" 

00:09:33.047 --> 00:09:38.098
 Whatever my answer was 'no' for several days, at the time I knew I needed to change something. 

00:09:40.005 --> 00:09:46.064
 Remember the fact that I was going to die soon was the most confronted tool to help me make the big decisions in my life 

00:09:47.025 --> 00:09:54.020
 Because almost everything - great hopes, pride, fear of pilgrimage and failure 

00:09:54.032 --> 00:09:59.067
 These things just hide in the face of death, leaving only what is really important. 

00:09:59.094 --> 00:10:07.027
 Reminding yourself that you are going to die is the best way to avoid falling into the trap of thinking that you have something to lose. 

00:10:07.046 --> 00:10:12.038
 You are really naked. There is no reason why you should not follow your heart. 

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:16.065
 About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. 

00:10:17.055 --> 00:10:22.053
 I had a medical survey at 7:30 in the morning, which clearly showed my tumor in the pancreas. 

00:10:22.074 --> 00:10:25.003
 I wouldn’t know what the pancreas really is then. 

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:34.065
 The team of doctors told me that my illness is incurable and that I have 3 to 6 months to live. 

00:10:34.092 --> 00:10:42.065
 My doctor’s advice was to go home and arrange my affairs, and it was the doctor’s code to tell me to prepare for death. 

00:10:42.094 --> 00:10:50.065
 This means that I try and tell my children everything I thought I had ten years to tell them what I wanted to say to them in just a few months. 

00:10:51.014 --> 00:10:56.048
 And to prepare everything for my family so that my departure is easy for them. 

00:10:56.088 --> 00:10:58.064
 This means that I bid everyone farewell. 

00:11:00.051 --> 00:11:02.093
 I lived with this medical diagnosis all day. 

00:11:03.038 --> 00:11:10.031
 Later in the evening I went to take a sample of this tumor for analysis, by inserting a speculum from my mouth and through my throat to my stomach and behind my intestine, 

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:14.006
 And through a needle that penetrated the pancreas to take cells from the tumor, 

00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:22.052
 I was drugged, but my wife, who was present, told me that when the doctors looked at these cells extracted from me under the telescope, they started crying with joy. 

00:11:22.072 --> 00:11:27.071
 Because the tumor was a very rare type of treatment with surgical intervention. 

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:31.083
 I had the surgery and removed the tumor and I'm fine now. 

00:11:32.005 --> 00:11:39.069
 [clap] 

00:11:40.014 --> 00:11:45.062
 This was my first encounter with death, and I hope it will remain so for many decades to come. 

00:11:45.095 --> 00:11:53.053
 Being alive from this experience, I can now say this advice about the reality of experience - rather than a metaphorical analogy or idea that you are trying to imagine: 

00:11:54.079 --> 00:12:00.085
 Nobody wants to die. Even those who want to go to heaven do not want to die to go there. 

00:12:01.032 --> 00:12:07.007
 Nevertheless, death is the end that we all share. And no one can escape from it. 

00:12:07.035 --> 00:12:14.012
 And so how should it be, because death is the best invention of life. 

00:12:14.031 --> 00:12:18.021
 It is a life change factor. It erases the old to give way to the new. 

00:12:19.003 --> 00:12:27.012
 Currently the new one is you, but someday not far from today, you will gradually become the old one and be erased. 

00:12:27.046 --> 00:12:30.069
 Sorry for being a dramatic, sad, but appointed truth. 

00:12:31.077 --> 00:12:36.071
 Your time is limited, so do not waste your life in someone else's life. 

00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:41.078
 Do not be trapped in belief - living according to what other people's minds have found. 

00:12:42.041 --> 00:12:46.012
 Do not let the noise of other people's opinions rise above your inner voice. 

00:12:46.033 --> 00:12:50.025
 Most importantly, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. 

00:12:50.076 --> 00:12:54.051
 They somehow honestly know what they want to be 

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:57.053
 And everything else is secondary. 

00:12:59.027 --> 00:13:08.054
 [clap] 

00:13:08.077 --> 00:13:17.033
 When I was young, there was an amazing book called "The Whole Earth Catalog" that was a book parent for my generation of young adults. 

00:13:17.048 --> 00:13:24.076
 It was authored by Stuart Brand in a place not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it back to life with his poetic touches. 

00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:33.054
 This was in the late 1960s, before personal computers and desktop publishing, and it was all made using typewriters, scissors, and instant Polaroid cameras. 

00:13:33.076 --> 00:13:44.003
 It was like providing Google’s services through paper, 35 years before Google came to us, it was an ideal book, full of technical tools and great ideas. 

00:13:44.055 --> 00:13:47.091
 Stewart and his companions developed several versions of the "The Whole Earth Catalog" 

00:13:48.027 --> 00:13:52.017
 After taking his time and it's time for the last version, they worked hard to design the last issue 

00:13:52.058 --> 00:13:56.034
 It was in the mid 1970's - when I was your age. 

00:13:57.065 --> 00:14:07.029
 And in the last cover of the last issue was a picture that showed a beautiful agricultural road in the morning, the kind you would have to carry your bag and stop the cars on the way to take you to it if you were the adventurous type. 

00:14:07.091 --> 00:14:15.078
 With this spectacular scene, a sentence came under the picture saying: "Stay hungry - stay foolish." To be the whole farewell of them to their readers. 

00:14:16.027 --> 00:14:22.007
 Stay hungry. Be a fool. I always wish this thing to myself. 

00:14:22.075 --> 00:14:27.076
 Now, as you graduate to start again, I hope so for you too. 

00:14:28.001 --> 00:14:30.060
 Stay hungry. Keep a fool. 

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.038
 Thank you all . 

00:14:32.059 --> 00:14:49.010
