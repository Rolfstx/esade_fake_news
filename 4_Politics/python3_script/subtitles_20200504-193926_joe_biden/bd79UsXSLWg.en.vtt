00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.580
I can't believe I even have to do this

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:05.580
but it's increasingly unclear to me

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.200
that Donald Trump can comfortably read the written English language.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.348
I mean like English written on pages.

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.038
I genuinely think after reviewing a bunch of videos and comments and evidence yesterday

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.380
that Donald Trump may barely be able to read.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.180
Let's start with some journalists who have interviewed Donald Trump

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.560
who have come to the conclusion that certainly Donald Trump doesn't read.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.780
We'll start there.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.700
There was one point when I asked him how he was preparing to possibly be president,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.380
and are you reading the great presidential biographies, for example?

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.480
And he paused for an unusually long time.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.579
His voice became almost tender,

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.960
and he said, you know, I've never read a biography

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.620
but I've always wanted to.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.220
You ask him as he's--because he's leaving the interview and going to bed,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.980
what are you reading?

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.400
And what does he say?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.920
He kind of had that look.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.900
Oh, yeah, you got me.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.460
And then he tried to answer,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.040
and he said he's reading this--this book by--

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.940
that Ed Klein wrote, a hatchet job on Hillary Clinton,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.300
which I'm sure he's not reading.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.420
Then there was a book about Nixon

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.940
which he couldn't remember exactly.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.320
Right, so Trump has said many times on the campaign trail that one of the main reasons

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.080
he'd be a good president was because of the stuff that he wrote about his life in "Art of the Deal,"

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.200
but of course we know he didn't actually write it,

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.680
and one of the most notable things to come from an interview

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.800
with the guy who actually wrote "Art of the Deal," Tony Schwartz,

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.720
is that he realized that not only did Trump have essentially no attention span whatsoever,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.320
which connects to his concerning level of TV watching that we've heard about over the last week or so,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:46.020
but also that he would be shocked to learn that Trump had read a single book cover-to-cover

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.440
in his entire adult life.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.990
Again, this is a quote from an interview with Tony Schwartz where he said

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.100
that's why he so prefers TV as his first news source--

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.340
information comes in easily digestible sound bites.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.000
I seriously doubt that Trump has ever read a book straight through in his adult life.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.019
He also said that during the entire 18 months that he was writing the book with Trump and observing Trump,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.710
he never once even saw a book on Donald Trump's desk or anywhere in his office or in his apartment.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.920
So fine, Donald Trump doesn't read, but can he read is really the question.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.220
Let's now put this together

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.860
with that report from last week from axios.com

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.700
about the total disarray that the Trump administration is in,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.300
and one of the main disturbing aspects

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.880
of the early days of the Trump administration

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.140
according to insiders at the Trump White House

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.020
is that Donald Trump seems fixated,

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.680
fixated on watching TV

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.220
and cannot focus on nor read any of the reports or briefings or white papers or anything.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.520
His advisers have even said he doesn't even really surf the web or use a computer.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.340
He'll scroll through Twitter on his phone

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.440
and dictate tweets to people in the other room.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.790
That's yet another layer to this thing, that Donald Trump may not only have trouble reading

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.780
but also have trouble writing, as we've talked about before.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.280
And trump has even tweeted about this himself.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.180
I dictate my tweet to my executive assistant

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.340
and she posts them.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.940
"Time is money."

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.920
Source, "The Art of the Deal."

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.160
Of course the phrase "time is money"

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.560
didn't even come from "The Art of the Deal," and again,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.849
this further continues to call into question both Donald Trump's reading and writing skills.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.920
His advisers have now also said Trump avoids reading any report or briefing

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.400
that he finds to be too lengthy,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.340
and he will often just glance at the first page

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.160
without even making it evident whether he understands what's on the page.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.240
It continues.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.360
Listen to this strange conversation

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.760
that Mark Fisher had with Donald Trump.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.350
So I pressed a little harder and I said, well,

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.840
How are you preparing? How will you make decisions as president?

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.260
And he said, well, I'm not gonna be reading any big reports or anything like that.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.680
And he told me the story of how a guy from Wall Street came to him,

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.260
wanted him to make a deal in China

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.918
and said there was an innovative kind of financing that he wanted Trump to consider,

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.100
and so Trump said, well, I don't know anything about.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.060
And the guy said, no problem. We've done some research.

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.740
I have a report. I'll send it to you today.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.760
And Trump said, don't send me any blanking reports, and--

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.360
and said, 'cause I won't read them.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.060
And here is Trump telling Chuck Todd that he gets his foreign policy advice from TV.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.220
Odd place for a presidential candidate to be getting foreign policy advice.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.560
Who do you talk to for military advice right now?

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.780
Well, I watch your shows. I mean, I really see a lot of great--

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.040
you know, when you watch your show and all of the other shows,

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.690
and you have the generals and you have certain people...

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:55.169
So that's circumstantial. Trump doesn't read.

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:59.180
But is he avoiding reading because he doesn't like it or because he has trouble reading?

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.480
And here is where it all explodes.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.680
I recently saw this interview I'm about to play for you

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.780
on "The Opie with Jim Norton" radio show

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.620
with "Saturday Night Live's" Pete Davidson,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.640
and Pete Davidson described that when Trump was guest hosting "Saturday Night Live,"

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.040
he genuinely seemed unable to read the script.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.520
Take a look at this.

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:25.080
Okay, so he's like--he doesn't really know how to read.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.020
For real?

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.400
Yeah, so during like the table read,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.400
he, like--

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.980
before, like, we were gonna read each--

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.480
before he had to read each line,

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.000
and he's the host so he's in everything.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.960
Yeah.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.400
He would go, uh, I'm not gonna say this.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.200
I think I'm gonna say it the way I want to say it. Is that okay?

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.560
Is that okay, Lorne? Is that--everything--

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:46.360
And everybody's like, what?

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.200
And then this is--my favorite part is,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.060
there was a sketch that we wrote where he's at Disneyland with his daughter,

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.300
and the line is,

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.960
All right, let's get out of here. Turkey legs?

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:59.840
Like, let's go get turkey legs?

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840
Sure.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.880
And he doesn't know how to read, so he went,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:06.320
All right. Let's get out of here, Turkey Legs.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.100
He called his daughter Turkey Legs.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.060
And then he looked up. Like, he doesn't get it.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.240
Like, he thinks if everybody's laughing with him

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.949
but we're all laughing at him.

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:21.880
So this would explain why it's such a disaster every time Trump tries to use a teleprompter.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.598
Not because he's unfamiliar with prompters

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:27.029
but because he's not a very good reader.

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:31.080
Let's take a look at just one of these awkward teleprompter debacles.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.240
Everything that is broken today

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.660
can be fixed and every failure can be turned

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:43.960
into a truly great success.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.540
Just look at the way I just

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.640
melded into the teleprompter.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.739
Yeah, so now here's where it gets completely nuts.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.449
I took a look at some specific portions of a deposition that Trump gave in June of last year,

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.640
and there is some really really clear attempts here to avoid having to read out loud.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.320
His lawyer clearly doesn't want Trump to do any reading out loud.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.040
And is the first clip where Trump says, I don't read leases. Let's start with that.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.020
Did you review the lease at all before you signed it?

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.580
No.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.060
How many leases like this have you reviewed in your career?

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.500
Signed or reviewed?

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.020
Reviewed.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.050
Not too many.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.020
I signed hundreds...

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.340
Right, so he's never really reviewed a lease,

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.460
and then he's asked to read a portion and his lawyer really doesn't like it.

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.360
Yeah?

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.960
You did not review this section of the lease.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.360
- What does that say?
- Monetary damages.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.260
This is in the remedies section.

00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.020
I did not. No.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.320
Okay.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.420
Would you be able to read this section and tell us what your understanding of it is?

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:50.320
Objection.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.640
Mr.. Trump isn't a lawyer.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:55.950
I mean, do you want me to read it?

00:07:58.169 --> 00:07:59.699
It's a lot of--it's long--

00:07:59.699 --> 00:08:00.900
It is long.

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.538
- It's very long.
- It is long.

00:08:02.539 --> 00:08:05.920
Yeah, so then it looks like maybe Trump is actually going to read,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.160
his lawyer seeming increasingly nervous,

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.799
and it gets really weird.

00:08:10.349 --> 00:08:12.979
I would--I would like you to read

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:16.339
just the monetary damages section

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.180
starting at the number one in the middle of the page, just there,

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.100
the rest of that,

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.700
and to the end of that.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.500
It continues on the next page.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.960
And tell me what you think,

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.740
reading that, you as the landlord are entitled to get

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:34.720
from the tenant in the event of a tenant breach

00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.440
in the way of damages.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.898
I don't have my glasses.

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:42.360
I am at a disadvantage--because I didn't bring my glasses.

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.180
This is such small writing.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.570
All right, well--

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.380
If the witness can't actually 
physically read the language--

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.520
I mean, it's very small writing.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.260
I can--I can make it out.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.540
Do you want me to try?

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:55.500
Well, I'm...

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.540
We can have--you know what we can do?

00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.060
We can have a bigger copy made of these pages.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.880
- And we'll come back to it.
- Let me try--let me just do it.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:06.320
All right, I have to place on the record a hearty objection.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:10.760
Hmm.

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.740
Awkward.

00:09:13.749 --> 00:09:15.749
Very awkward.

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.900
Insanely awkward.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:21.460
So long pause,

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.350
looking at the page, looking confused.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.080
He doesn't have his glasses with him.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.140
Have we ever seen Trump wearing glasses when signing executive orders?

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.550
Have we ever seen Trump wearing glasses

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.600
at those countless rallies where he goes up onstage with polling data to read to people?

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:35.280
No. Here's an example.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.920
Again, never any glasses.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.180
All right, so South Carolina just came out,

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:47.129
and that's 32 for Trump, 18 for second, 11 for third, great.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.169
Florida leading by a lot, 31, 19, 13, and then all down in the dumps.

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:56.840
So again, he's able to read numbers off of a page.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.249
Didn't seem to have a problem there without his glasses.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:02.130
We've never seen him wear glasses, but all of a sudden at the deposition,

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:03.150
he doesn't have his glasses.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.540
And then his lawyer objects again as you heard.

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.109
Lastly Trump stares at it for a while and then again instead of reading it,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:12.900
He sort of weirdly paraphrases

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:14.360
what he thinks it says.

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:21.780
Yeah, it's the all damages that the landlord may sustain including all legal fees and everything else involved.

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:24.640
Looks like everything and the kitchen sink to me.

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.240
Then you have number two.

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:42.720
Yeah?

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:45.870
Go on.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:52.747
It's the value of the positive difference with the aggregate amount of the base rent

00:10:52.747 --> 00:10:54.230
and the additional rent.

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:59.520
The guy can barely read, Pat. I am convinced he can barely read.

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.920
And even on an inauguration day--I didn't think much of this--

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.480
Trump seemed confused about which orders

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.480
he was signing and where to sign, but it's all part of this.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.280
He kept having to be told what he was signing, and now it all comes together.

00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.040
The guy barely can comprehend what's on pieces of paper.

00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:16.560
We have to sign that.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.360
I know that.

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:24.720
Where would you like me to sign this?

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.640
You just sign under--

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.020
Just underneath.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.700
Anyplace you want.

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.230
As long as it's signed.

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:33.480
So we may have a Trump--a president--

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.120
we may have a president in Trump here who isn't speaking at a fourth-grade level

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.120
because it's some genius way to appeal to people.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:42.560
It's because he's reading at a fourth-grade level,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.000
and that's the highest level he's able to speak at.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:49.280
I mean, I'm not sure if we have enough here to make a conclusion on his raw reading ability.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.980
- No.
- But the lack of intellectual curiosity

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.960
is what bothers me, because you can get books on tape,

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.059
you can have advisers come in and tell you what the policy proposals are.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:00.460
There's ways around this.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.760
There are ways around it, but this is all incredibly disturbing,

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.200
and I'm curious to see what the audience thinks about it.
