♪♪

00:00:16.483 --> 00:00:19.853
-Forget the politics,
we have a national crisis.

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.223
We are at war.
There is no politics.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:25.993
-So our news cycle is changing,

00:00:25.993 --> 00:00:28.762
if not daily,
then hourly or by the minute.

00:00:28.762 --> 00:00:32.833
And there's so much
information out there today,

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:36.103
and it's difficult to navigate
the waters of the news.

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:38.772
-Over 2,980 deaths.

00:00:38.772 --> 00:00:41.275
-It was another rough day
for the financial markets.

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:43.543
-They're going to do
a 30-day extension.

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:45.812
-Over 4,700 deaths...

00:00:45.812 --> 00:00:48.582
-...which means
another month of this.

00:00:48.582 --> 00:00:50.350
-So one of the things
I want to do is

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.487
talk to some of the biggest
thinkers in the world and say,

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:55.856
"Hey, what are these problems,

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:58.558
and what are
the unforeseen consequences

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:00.894
of what's happening
in real time?"

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:04.231
-We have entered into
this next phase

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.732
that has required me,

00:01:05.732 --> 00:01:08.502
under
the circumstances,

00:01:08.502 --> 00:01:11.772
to advance
a proclamation

00:01:11.772 --> 00:01:13.740
of a state of emergency

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.175
in the state of California.

00:01:15.175 --> 00:01:17.678
-Now, one of the biggest
questions is,

00:01:17.678 --> 00:01:19.646
all of these emergency measures,

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:21.581
all of the data collection
to sort of say,

00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:23.417
"Well, what's happening
with the pandemic?"

00:01:23.417 --> 00:01:25.152
have knock-on effects.

00:01:25.152 --> 00:01:26.787
And I think one of
the greatest thinkers

00:01:26.787 --> 00:01:29.056
around civil liberties

00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.291
and these unforeseen
consequences

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.592
is Edward Snowden.

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:35.095
-This is the truth.
This is what's happening.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:37.597
You should decide whether
we need to be doing this.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.032
-So today we're going to
talk to him

00:01:39.032 --> 00:01:42.502
about his thoughts
on the COVID virus

00:01:42.502 --> 00:01:47.307
as well as, what does that mean
for our civil liberties?

00:01:51.011 --> 00:01:52.813
Edward Snowden,
thanks for being here today.

00:01:52.813 --> 00:01:54.348
-It's a pleasure to be with you.

00:01:54.348 --> 00:01:56.616
-Let's just jump into it.

00:01:56.616 --> 00:01:59.086
-Why does it seem like
we're so ill-prepared?

00:01:59.086 --> 00:02:05.258
We're acting like COVID-19
is a never-seen-before virus

00:02:05.258 --> 00:02:07.127
and that this is
just out of nowhere,

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:08.662
surprise, surprise.

00:02:08.662 --> 00:02:11.231
You know, we had SARS,
we had MERS.

00:02:11.231 --> 00:02:14.601
We've had these types
of things before,

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:17.137
and in fact, we knew

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:21.308
that we were going
to be having more of them,

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.377
yet we were not set up,

00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:24.745
or it seems like

00:02:24.745 --> 00:02:26.947
we were completely taken aback

00:02:26.947 --> 00:02:30.183
that this is happening now

00:02:30.183 --> 00:02:33.420
and is having, you know,
such a profound effect,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.424
when, if you talk to any
epidemiologist or virologist,

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:39.092
they knew that
this was going to happen.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:41.294
-There is nothing more
foreseeable

00:02:41.294 --> 00:02:44.931
as a public health crisis
for, you know, again,

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:48.235
a world where we are just
living on top of each other

00:02:48.235 --> 00:02:52.205
in crowded and polluted cities

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:54.141
than a pandemic.

00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.276
And yeah, every academic,
every researcher

00:02:56.276 --> 00:02:59.446
who's looked at this
knew this was coming.

00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.214
And in fact,
even intelligence agencies,

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:03.884
I can tell you firsthand because
I used to read the reports,

00:03:03.884 --> 00:03:06.186
had been planning
for pandemics.

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:09.289
And yet when we needed it,
the system has now failed us,

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:11.525
and it has failed us
comprehensively.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:16.096
And the thing that I find
grotesque about this situation

00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:18.131
is that now the people
who are being asked

00:03:18.131 --> 00:03:19.900
to sacrifice the most
are the people

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.735
who are in the most
precarious positions,

00:03:21.735 --> 00:03:23.737
who have the least to give.

00:03:23.737 --> 00:03:26.139
We're constantly being told

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.909
we're the richest country
in the world.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.511
But when people start
losing their jobs,

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:35.315
when rents become
difficult to pay

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:39.886
because there's no work for
any waitress in any restaurant

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:44.057
in New York right now,
where are our resources?

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.093
When our hospitals say
they need ventilators,

00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:47.928
you know, where is
all this great technology

00:03:47.928 --> 00:03:51.064
that's being used to surveil
everybody, you know,

00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:54.701
down to the tiniest toenail
when we need it to create things

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.837
that actually save lives?

00:03:56.837 --> 00:04:00.307
-In South Korea,
which has been successful

00:04:00.307 --> 00:04:03.577
in at least flattening
their curve,

00:04:03.577 --> 00:04:06.847
the government's been
sending text messages

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:09.850
to people who have come
into contact with people

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.185
that they know have COVID-19,

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:14.988
which means they know
who has COVID-19,

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:16.523
they know who they're meeting,

00:04:16.523 --> 00:04:18.758
they know their
text message numbers.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.827
They know how to get in touch
with them.

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:23.997
-The Korea Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention uses data

00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.566
provided by local
telecommunications companies.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:30.137
-Taiwan is doing
a "mobile fence," so-called,

00:04:30.137 --> 00:04:32.072
where, if they know
you're infected,

00:04:32.072 --> 00:04:33.907
they're going to put
a mobile fence around you,

00:04:33.907 --> 00:04:35.575
and if you leave,
you're going to get in trouble.

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:37.611
If you leave your --
It's basically the --

00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:40.580
your mobile phone
is your new ankle bracelet.

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.717
You know, we look
at what China did,

00:04:43.717 --> 00:04:47.187
including welding
certain doors shut,

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:50.223
and we seem to be
sort of knee-jerk, ad hoc,

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:52.325
and we're, you know,
culturally we can't do this,

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:55.162
yet are our numbers
are through the roof.

00:04:55.162 --> 00:04:58.765
So are autocratic regimes better

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:01.935
at dealing with things like this
than democratic ones?

00:05:01.935 --> 00:05:04.437
-I don't think so. I mean,
there are arguments being made

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:08.208
that China can do things
that the United States can't.

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:10.777
Now, that doesn't mean

00:05:10.777 --> 00:05:14.514
that what these autocratic
countries are doing

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:17.350
is actually more effective.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.954
There are really only two things
that we know to be true.

00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:24.758
One is that no one knows
the true number of infected

00:05:24.758 --> 00:05:28.495
because we can only
in the absolute best case

00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:29.763
know the confirmed cases

00:05:29.763 --> 00:05:32.432
of people
that we've actually tested.

00:05:32.432 --> 00:05:35.302
And once you start to layer in
this autocratic,

00:05:35.302 --> 00:05:37.838
or I would argue,
more authoritarian type

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:40.473
of policy structure,

00:05:40.473 --> 00:05:45.812
what you end up seeing
is that instead of policy

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:48.882
being guided
by science and facts,

00:05:48.882 --> 00:05:52.786
you begin to see things
like information releases

00:05:52.786 --> 00:05:55.388
becoming political decisions.

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:57.624
Now, this is not new.

00:05:57.624 --> 00:06:03.029
In fact, the Spanish flu
around 1918

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.565
did not actually originate
in Spain.

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:07.968
It was actually spreading
in World War I

00:06:07.968 --> 00:06:09.769
through the trenches,

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:12.072
where everybody
was in terrible conditions.

00:06:12.072 --> 00:06:15.275
But the militaries of the day
had imposed restrictions

00:06:15.275 --> 00:06:17.877
on what the press could report

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:19.579
that could impact
the war effort.

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:22.215
And so Spain,
being a neutral country,

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.917
was publishing

00:06:23.917 --> 00:06:26.419
what they were actually
seeing in their country.

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.823
And so we just presumed,
because they were the only ones

00:06:29.823 --> 00:06:32.659
that were telling the truth,
that it came from them.

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.629
Now we're a little further ahead
than that today.

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:41.101
But that doesn't erase the fact
that people in power

00:06:41.101 --> 00:06:44.170
who see that there is
a political advantage

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.673
to disguising
or concealing or massaging

00:06:46.673 --> 00:06:51.144
or denying numbers
may choose to lie about it.

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:54.014
It's happened before and it's
almost certainly happening now.

00:06:54.014 --> 00:06:56.016
-If you're looking
at countries like China,

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:58.184
which seems to have flattened,

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:01.388
how much can we trust that
those numbers are actually true?

00:07:01.388 --> 00:07:02.756
-I don't think we can.

00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:05.258
Particularly, we see
the Chinese government recently

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.927
working to expel
Western journalists

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.397
at precisely this moment

00:07:10.397 --> 00:07:12.532
where we need credible
independent reporting

00:07:12.532 --> 00:07:14.634
from this kind of region.

00:07:14.634 --> 00:07:17.203
And then there's all of these
rumors and initial reports

00:07:17.203 --> 00:07:20.073
that say things like, you know,
the number of urns shipments

00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:22.242
for burials have
gone way up,

00:07:22.242 --> 00:07:25.679
way beyond what you would expect
from the official numbers.

00:07:25.679 --> 00:07:28.615
And the fact that we cannot
get independent verification

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:32.185
of the facts gives us reason
to doubt the official story.

00:07:32.185 --> 00:07:36.623
And the reality
that we need to accept,

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:39.426
which is
an uncomfortable reality,

00:07:39.426 --> 00:07:43.563
is that even in places
that are not autocratic regimes,

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:44.898
they're going to have
a second wave.

00:07:44.898 --> 00:07:46.299
They're going to have
a third wave.

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.368
They're going to have
a fourth wave based on all of

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:52.305
the best medical analysis
that we have available today.

00:07:52.305 --> 00:07:54.708
I think -- I was reading

00:07:54.708 --> 00:07:57.010
a paper this morning
that was from,

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.013
I think, that the Chan School
of Public Health

00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:02.649
at -- I think it was
Harvard University

00:08:02.649 --> 00:08:04.884
that said pumping the brakes

00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:06.720
is going to have to be
the new strategy.

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.222
-Which means we're at
the beginning of, as you say,

00:08:09.222 --> 00:08:12.492
you know, second, third,
fourth waves of this coming.

00:08:12.492 --> 00:08:18.298
And so all of these measures
are going to get more severe.

00:08:18.298 --> 00:08:22.602
And what then happens
to civil liberties,

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:25.638
to privacy rights, to democracy?

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:28.341
I mean, what are the knock-on
effects that you can see?

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:30.877
-I mean, this is really
the central question

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:33.313
of this moment in history.

00:08:33.313 --> 00:08:38.151
What we see is everyone
is fearful and hopeless

00:08:38.151 --> 00:08:41.654
and so worried about today

00:08:41.654 --> 00:08:43.089
that we have
really stopped thinking

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:45.592
about what tomorrow
will look like

00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:48.528
as a result of the decisions
that we take today.

00:08:48.528 --> 00:08:52.298
We've seen in countries
like Taiwan and South Korea

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:54.968
and spreading also
into more Western countries,

00:08:54.968 --> 00:08:56.469
and of course,
in the United States,

00:08:56.469 --> 00:08:58.171
where it has begun as well,

00:08:58.171 --> 00:09:01.408
the tracking and monitoring
of the movements

00:09:01.408 --> 00:09:03.643
of the whole
of the human population

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:06.713
through the movements
of our phones.

00:09:06.713 --> 00:09:08.782
And it is, I think,

00:09:08.782 --> 00:09:11.251
something that should
raise cause for concern,

00:09:11.251 --> 00:09:13.186
because when we talk
about the applications,

these kind of text messages

There is, of course,
a natural presumed benefit here.

And yet, this level
of contact tracing,

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.780
this method of contact tracing
does not really work

00:10:37.604 --> 00:10:39.806
that should make everyone
just look at their phone

00:10:39.806 --> 00:10:42.542
and, you know,
sort of raise an eyebrow.

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:45.245
There are a number of ways that
you can track the location

00:10:45.245 --> 00:10:47.380
of someone through their phone.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.049
There are these cell phone
towers themselves,

00:10:50.049 --> 00:10:53.186
but there's also
the wireless network

00:10:53.186 --> 00:10:54.787
that you're connected to.

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:57.423
And then what other wireless
networks around you

00:10:57.423 --> 00:10:59.025
that you're not connected to --

00:10:59.025 --> 00:11:02.061
this you can think of as
what wireless networks

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:04.163
your phone can hear.

00:11:04.163 --> 00:11:07.934
And so these wireless network
identifiers are then collected

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:10.470
and they're mapped out
against GPS,

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.407
and then they know
if you can see mom's Wi-fi

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:17.810
and neighbor Ted's Wi-fi
and the library Wi-fi

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.180
all at the same time,

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.615
you have to be within range
of these things.

00:11:22.615 --> 00:11:25.118
It becomes a proxy for location.

00:11:25.118 --> 00:11:27.854
Now that we know
all of our phones

00:11:27.854 --> 00:11:30.657
can and are being tracked
at all times

00:11:30.657 --> 00:11:33.026
just by being turned on --

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.695
The phone companies have it
at a bare minimum.

00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:36.996
Facebook probably has it.

00:11:36.996 --> 00:11:39.999
Google probably has it.
Apple probably has it.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.602
And many, many other companies
you've never even heard of

00:11:42.602 --> 00:11:44.737
that run ad networks.

00:11:44.737 --> 00:11:46.973
What this really means

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:51.611
in a France or a United States

00:11:51.611 --> 00:11:53.179
is they go, "Well, look,

00:11:53.179 --> 00:11:55.415
we're aware of privacy concerns,
so what we're going to do

00:11:55.415 --> 00:11:58.918
is we're going to depersonalize
this information,

00:11:58.918 --> 00:12:01.154
we're going to 'anonymize' it,

00:12:01.154 --> 00:12:02.589
and we're not going to
look at individuals.

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:06.459
We're going to look at the flows
of movement of these phones.

00:12:06.459 --> 00:12:08.261
Right? We're not looking
at one phone.

00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:11.297
We're looking at the aggregate
movements of phones."

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:14.167
The problem is, if you're not
tracking one infection

00:12:14.167 --> 00:12:15.535
or 100 infections,

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:18.838
but you're tracking
100,000 infections,

00:12:18.838 --> 00:12:20.840
contact-tracing quickly
becomes useless.

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:25.678
And more, the precision
of location information

00:12:25.678 --> 00:12:29.816
is either so rough

00:12:29.816 --> 00:12:32.385
that it is largely useless,
which is the case

00:12:32.385 --> 00:12:34.153
if we're talking about
the cellphone networks,

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:35.855
the cellphone towers
you're near,

00:12:35.855 --> 00:12:40.526
to very, very precise
location information,

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:42.128
in which case this information

00:12:42.128 --> 00:12:44.797
when you're applying it
at scale,

00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:48.534
cannot be anonymized
in a meaningful way.

00:12:48.534 --> 00:12:50.103
And then there's
this big question of,

00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.639
well, where does all
that information go?

00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:54.007
How is it controlled?

00:12:54.007 --> 00:12:57.010
Who's it being used --
It's information about me.

00:12:57.010 --> 00:12:58.778
I should have
some influence over it.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.214
I should have control over it.

00:13:01.214 --> 00:13:02.915
But unfortunately,
in the United States,

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:04.917
to a large degree, you don't.

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:09.555
There is no basic privacy law
in the United States.

00:13:09.555 --> 00:13:11.157
We need to be able
to make sure

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:14.594
that the brakes
that are being pumped

00:13:14.594 --> 00:13:18.431
are on the pandemic

00:13:18.431 --> 00:13:20.333
rather than on our society.

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:23.436
-You know, it seems
that this is

00:13:23.436 --> 00:13:28.641
maybe the greatest question
of the modern era

00:13:28.641 --> 00:13:31.177
around civil liberties,

00:13:31.177 --> 00:13:35.148
around the right to privacy.

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:38.918
Yet no one's asking
this question.

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:42.822
We really don't hear
a lot about it.

00:13:42.822 --> 00:13:47.627
And so now this is
probably the largest societal

00:13:47.627 --> 00:13:52.031
zeitgeist change to,
"Yes, have the information

00:13:52.031 --> 00:13:53.900
because we have
to stop this thing."

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.069
You know, we're declaring,
you know,

00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:58.738
various states of emergencies
here and there.

00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:01.074
But these have sweeping powers.

00:14:01.074 --> 00:14:05.411
So we're sitting here in America
quarantined and saying,

00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:08.715
"Okay, what does this mean
going forward?"

00:14:08.715 --> 00:14:11.017
-When I think
about the future,

00:14:11.017 --> 00:14:15.922
when any of us look
at where this is heading,

00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:18.191
we need to think about
where we've been,

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:21.194
and sadly, these kind
of emergency powers

00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:23.396
that are born out of crises

00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.465
have a perfect history
of abuse.

00:14:25.465 --> 00:14:26.733
I mean, down the board,

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:28.468
whenever you look
at these things,

00:14:28.468 --> 00:14:31.571
the funniest part about it
in a dark way

00:14:31.571 --> 00:14:33.606
is that the emergency
never ends.

00:14:33.606 --> 00:14:35.007
It becomes normalized.

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:37.443
When you talk about
mass surveillance,

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:40.646
the Bush-era warrantless
wiretapping program,

00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:44.517
only part of it was shut down,
and it's rolled over

00:14:44.517 --> 00:14:46.185
and it's rolled over
and it's rolled over.

00:14:46.185 --> 00:14:47.687
And we've performed things
at the edges,

00:14:47.687 --> 00:14:50.957
but the basic practices
of what was supposed to be

00:14:50.957 --> 00:14:52.291
a stopgap emergency,

00:14:52.291 --> 00:14:55.194
which was in response
to another stopgap emergency,

00:14:55.194 --> 00:14:57.396
was which was, of course,
the legacy of 9/11

00:14:57.396 --> 00:14:58.865
and the Patriot Act.

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:03.870
And we are still today
engaged in the same wars

00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:06.139
that we declared
nearly 20 years ago

00:15:06.139 --> 00:15:09.142
that we have not managed
to escape.

00:15:09.142 --> 00:15:11.778
You know, we had,
as a result of 9/11,

00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:14.046
the rise
of the nuclear Iran

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:16.883
because their counterbalance
in Iraq was ruined.

00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:22.522
We saw authoritarianism begin to
creep across Western societies,

00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:26.759
places we wouldn't expect,
like Hungary and Poland.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:30.129
As authoritarianism spreads,

00:15:30.129 --> 00:15:34.333
as emergency laws
proliferate,

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:39.005
as we sacrifice our rights,

00:15:39.005 --> 00:15:42.508
we also sacrifice
our capability

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:47.246
to arrest this slide into a less
liberal and less free world.

00:15:47.246 --> 00:15:50.950
Do you truly believe that when
the first wave, the second wave,

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.186
the 16th wave
of the coronavirus

00:15:53.186 --> 00:15:55.621
is a long-forgotten memory,

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.957
that these capabilities
will not be kept,

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.359
that these data sets
will not be kept?

00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:02.929
Will those capabilities
begin to be applied

00:16:02.929 --> 00:16:04.530
to small-time criminality?

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.033
Will they begin to be applied
to political analysis?

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:09.001
Will they begin to be applied

00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:11.437
for doing things
like performing a census?

00:16:11.437 --> 00:16:14.273
Will they be used
for political polling?

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:16.042
No matter how it is being used,

00:16:16.042 --> 00:16:22.148
what is being built is
the architecture of oppression.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:25.451
And you might trust
who is dealing with it,

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:26.919
you might trust
who runs it.

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.155
You might go, "You know, I don't
care about Mark Zuckerberg."

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:31.924
But someone else will have
this data eventually.

00:16:31.924 --> 00:16:34.894
Some other country
will have this data eventually.

00:16:34.894 --> 00:16:36.996
In your country,
a different president

00:16:36.996 --> 00:16:38.831
will have control
of this data eventually,

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:43.069
and someone will abuse it.

00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:46.138
Now, could China use it for
something interesting to them?

00:16:46.138 --> 00:16:49.108
Yes. And what happens
when they abuse it?

00:16:49.108 --> 00:16:51.444
And I believe they already have.

00:16:51.444 --> 00:16:53.479
You know, they're they're
running internment camps

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:54.981
in China.

00:16:54.981 --> 00:16:58.217
And these practices,
when they don't get pushback,

00:16:58.217 --> 00:17:00.319
when they don't get
condemnation,

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:01.821
when they don't face sanction,

00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:05.358
this will become normalized
and it will spread.

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.460

we'll face them
throughout Europe.

00:18:31.911 --> 00:18:35.081
our hospitals, if we think about
how we can work

00:18:35.081 --> 00:18:37.583
together internationally
to overcome this,

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:41.087
as our weeds peak in different
places at different times,

00:18:41.087 --> 00:18:45.424
we cooperate,
we can start to get this space

00:18:45.424 --> 00:18:48.995
to think not about
addressing the symptom

00:18:48.995 --> 00:18:51.397
of our overcrowded
and unequal world,

00:18:51.397 --> 00:18:56.302
which is this virus that has
spread across borders instantly.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:57.870
When you look at
what's happened,

00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:59.805
when we have
this health crisis,

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.975
and it very quickly morphed
into an economic crisis

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:07.480
and then very quickly
became a financial crisis,

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.949
you see all the governments
of the world leap into action.

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:11.984
And it's interesting that you
see the majority of this money

00:19:11.984 --> 00:19:15.421
go not to the public,
not to hospitals,

00:19:15.421 --> 00:19:16.922
but to businesses,

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:20.993
loans to the groups
and corporations

00:19:20.993 --> 00:19:23.062
that actually created
the systemic problems

00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:29.001
that were exacerbated
by this sudden sharp decline.

00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:33.072
But we need to remember
that this virus will pass,

00:19:33.072 --> 00:19:37.943
but the decisions that we make
today in this atmosphere

00:19:37.943 --> 00:19:40.312
will last.

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:41.747
We will have to live with them

00:19:41.747 --> 00:19:43.349
and our children will have
to live with them.

00:19:43.349 --> 00:19:45.451
All of our posterity will.

00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:49.388
It's not just about America.
It's not just about your city.

00:19:49.388 --> 00:19:51.924
It's about everywhere.

00:19:51.924 --> 00:19:55.361
Because these systems,
if we do not change them,

00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:59.265
they're going to make decisions
for us on an automated basis

00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:01.333
to determine who gets a job,

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.936
who gets a home,
and who does not.

00:20:07.673 --> 00:20:14.213
♪♪

00:20:14.213 --> 00:20:16.182
-So we seem to be heading

00:20:16.182 --> 00:20:18.617
into this uncharted territory.

00:20:18.617 --> 00:20:21.587
And I wanted to ask you,
you know, step back,

00:20:21.587 --> 00:20:23.189
take some time.

00:20:23.189 --> 00:20:24.557
What should we be
thinking about?

00:20:24.557 --> 00:20:27.526
What should we be
concentrating on?

00:20:27.526 --> 00:20:31.764
-One of the things
that strikes me is

00:20:31.764 --> 00:20:33.666
this sensation that this is,

00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:35.301
you know,
a bolt out of the blue,

00:20:35.301 --> 00:20:37.703
it couldn't have been prevented,
it couldn't have been resisted,

00:20:37.703 --> 00:20:41.807
it couldn't have been imagined
that this would come to pass,

00:20:41.807 --> 00:20:43.943
this global pandemic.

00:20:43.943 --> 00:20:46.278
When you think about
the average American,

00:20:46.278 --> 00:20:48.347
you know,
they go to work every day.

00:20:48.347 --> 00:20:51.817
They spend ten hours
at the office, in the car,

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:55.087
away from their family,
away from their home.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:58.991
And by the end of the day,
they've got no space to think.

00:20:58.991 --> 00:21:02.161
And now all of us collectively
at the same time

00:21:02.161 --> 00:21:06.899
has been forced into a global
sabbatical all around the world,

00:21:06.899 --> 00:21:11.570
which is an extraordinarily
rare event in history.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.807
We are at one of
the only moments

00:21:14.807 --> 00:21:20.112
that will be in our lifetimes
where the system is so stressed

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:22.848
and so overextended
and the leadership

00:21:22.848 --> 00:21:26.619
so clearly out of its league
that we have the ability

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:29.288
to make not reformative changes,

00:21:29.288 --> 00:21:30.890
but revolutionary changes,

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.792
that we can actually change
the functioning of society,

00:21:33.792 --> 00:21:36.495
that we can actually change
the structure of the system

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:38.464
that controls
and influences our lives --

00:21:38.464 --> 00:21:39.899
the way that we are
being monitored,

00:21:39.899 --> 00:21:41.433
the way that we're being
tracked.

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:45.337
Because these systems,
if we do not change them,

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:47.640
will not simply be used
to monitor our health.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:51.677
They're going to make decisions
for us on an automated basis

00:21:51.677 --> 00:21:55.080
to determine who gets a job,
who goes to school,

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.149
who gets a loan,
who gets a home,

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:59.018
and who does not.

00:21:59.018 --> 00:22:01.353
And we today are being asked

00:22:01.353 --> 00:22:04.156
in a moment
of extraordinary fear,

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:07.326
"What do we want
these systems to look like?"

00:22:07.326 --> 00:22:09.662
And if we don't make
that decision ourselves,

00:22:09.662 --> 00:22:12.631
it will be made for us.

00:22:12.631 --> 00:22:15.434
-Edward Snowden,
thank you for your time today.

00:22:15.434 --> 00:22:18.070
-Thanks so much, Shane.
