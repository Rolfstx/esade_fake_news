00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.640
Before Prime launched in 2005 one-day
shipping was an exorbitant luxury.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.360
Now it's the standard shipping speed
for Amazon's 100 million Prime

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.200
members. Earlier this year Amazon doubled
the speed of Prime shipping from

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.070
two days to one.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.610
And the faster speed is now available
on more than 10 million products.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.410
Prime one-day is basically going to A)
keep up with the brick and mortar

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.420
guys and B) enhance Prime.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.100
Amazon has changed
the game completely.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.530
So what they excel at is getting an
object from a creator to a consumer as

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.390
flawlessly as they can and
as quickly as they can.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.110
So Amazon is changing people's
expectations and they're perpetually

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.480
improving those expectations.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.210
But behind every Amazon box there are lots
of people hustling and a lot of

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.220
money spent to get it to
you in just one day.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.890
Here's what happens when you buy
a Prime eligible item on Amazon.com.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.550
Amazon spends tens of billions
on shipping every year.

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.450
In just the last quarter of
2018, Amazon's shipping costs jumped

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.000
23%, reaching a record $9 billion.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.890
So why is it worth it?

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:12.630
Well customers come to expect consistent
fast delivery of anything on earth

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.350
from Amazon.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.450
And our job is to
continue to make that happen.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.130
And Amazon set aside $800 million just
in the second quarter of 2019 to

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.810
start making one-day
shipping the norm.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.620
Most of that investment is
going towards the infrastructure and

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.240
transportation costs associated with speeding
up delivery to the millions

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.750
of Prime customers who are about to
begin to experience one-day as the new

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.140
normal.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.020
The difference with e-commerce is
the costs never end.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.530
The pick, pack and ship happens every
time a unit is sent out.

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.790
To better control this process and its
large cost, Amazon is cutting down

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.560
its reliance on UPS and the U.S.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.920
Postal Service and is investing heavily
in its own logistics network.

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.640
It now handles the shipping
for 26% of online orders.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.220
Amazon now has at least 50
airplanes, 300 semi-trucks, 20,000 delivery

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.490
vans and it operates ocean
freight services between the U.S.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.000
and China.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.770
Amazon is looking to do it all.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.570
That shouldn't be much of a surprise.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.870
The only thing that matters to Amazon
is making sure the customer is happy

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.960
and is paying for Prime
every year or every month.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.130
What that means is sometimes you can rely
on partners but you want to make

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.070
sure that you have it in your
pocket if that's not the case.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.460
Other big retailers are also spending a
lot to keep up with the fast

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.530
shipping expectations Amazon
has created.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.270
Walmart is rolling out free next-day shipping
with orders of 35 dollars or

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.980
more starting today.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.220
And target offers free two-day shipping
on orders over 35 dollars.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.810
And during Amazon's big Prime Day sales
event July 15th and 16th, eBay

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.530
plans to hold a crash sale
offering 80% off big ticket items.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.660
Amazon's 25 years old.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.100
The reality is that's a really short time
to be around to have become the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.830
number one player.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.040
So can anyone compete? Sure

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.060
people can compete.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.750
Can they sustainably compete
is the harder question.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.040
I don't think we've seen it yet.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.410
The journey a package takes to your
door starts before you even place the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.790
order. Most items on Amazon are sold
directly to you by a third party.

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.410
In Jeff Bezos' letter to shareholders
in April 2019, he said third-party

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.840
sales have grown from 3% of total
merchandise sales in 1999 to 58% in

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.490
2018. Amazon charges those sellers a
fee to list items on Amazon.com

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.340
starting around 15% of
the item's selling price.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.590
Amazon also sells things directly.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.340
In some cases Amazon buys inventory from
a third party and then sells it

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.030
to consumers.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.230
Other items are Amazon's own brands
such as Amazon Basics, Amazon

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.490
Essentials, fashion lines like Lark &amp; Ro
and Alexa devices like the Echo.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.080
All items sold directly by Amazon
are already sitting in an Amazon

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.030
warehouse waiting to be
ordered and shipped.

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.470
Most third-party items fulfilled by Amazon
are also already waiting at an

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.100
Amazon warehouse, while others are sent directly
from the seller or to an

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.440
Amazon warehouse once you hit
that place order button.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.190
Amazon does not disclose the
details of its inventory strategy.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.420
Figuring out where a product sits before
you buy it is a phenomenal

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:14.560
mystery. It's something that every
reseller would love to know.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.650
And figuring out the code that is
Amazon has been part of that hard

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:18.190
process.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:24.080
After an item is ordered and ready
at one of Amazon's 175 fulfillment

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.650
centers around the globe, it's picked, packaged
and shipped by some of its

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.780
250,000 warehouse workers often with help
from one of its 100,000 robots.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.410
It's essentially an amusement
park for a box.

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.740
There's conveyor belts that go
around, there are slides.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.150
It looks like a lot of fun.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.840
But the question is: how much is
automated versus how much his manual

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.370
labor? And that suite, blending that, figuring
out how to have the least

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.050
human touch points while ensuring the
best quality control is that

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.370
perpetual conversation.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.080
We visited a fulfillment center outside
Seattle where 2,000 workers prepare

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.780
packages on a couple million
square feet of floor space.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.530
Workers here showed us the process of
getting an item from the shelves to

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.330
a box.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.680
We scan the item and make sure that
that item is what matches what's in our

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.840
hand that's on the screen and then
we stow it into a bin.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:21.140
And then there's cameras here that take
pictures of where our hands go

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.170
of where we place the item.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:28.310
I am a picker so I pick product that
will end up going down to the packing

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.730
department and then they pack it out
and send it to our customers.

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:33.980
I need to put it into a box.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.790
It actually tells me what
type of box it is.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.140
Tape. Put the item in there.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.330
Scan it through. Drop
it down the line.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.040
Amazon says it's 100,000 robots inside
the fulfillment centers help make

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.510
this whole process more efficient.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.150
In 2012 Amazon bought robotics company
Kiva for $775 million and started

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.760
using robots in its fulfillment
centers a couple years later.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.780
Now there's driving robots that move
inventory around, robotic arms that

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.380
lift boxes and pallets and even a
new robot that can package items in

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.730
custom-sized boxes.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.650
If it wasn't for them then I'd have to
walk and I'd much rather be up here

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.160
in my own little world picking
then walking up and down.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.310
So I love the robots.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.650
As technology continues to change
how fulfillment centers function, Amazon

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.580
just announced it will spend $700 million
to retrain a third of its U.S.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.300
workforce by 2025 to move
them to more advanced jobs.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.610
After an order leaves the fulfillment center
it has to get across the

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.310
country or world to another
warehouse in your region.

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:44.910
Some boxes are sent via one of
the shipping giants, but Amazon is cutting

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.020
costs by sending packages in at least
300 of its own semi-trucks and now

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.430
dozens of its own planes.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:53.250
We've been building out an air network
for a number of years now.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.330
That coupled with our partners networks, we're in
a place we have a lot of

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:01.260
incremental capacity to be able to
advance packages for customers much

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.210
faster than we were two
or three years ago.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.550
Amazon broke ground on a new 1.5

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.040
billion dollar air hub in
Northern Kentucky in May.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.390
It has capacity for 100 planes.

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:14.670
One of the great things about customers
all over the world: they are

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:16.140
divinely discontent.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.420
You give them the
best service you can.

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:19.410
They love it.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.420
But they always want
a little bit more.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.320
We're going to move Prime from two-day to
one-day and this hub is a big

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.850
part of that.

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.540
After an item arrives near your city
it waits in another warehouse like

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.720
this one for a delivery person to pick it
up and take it that last mile to

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.170
your door.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:37.520
We've been building for over 20
years to support this network that's

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.070
eventually just constantly getting faster and
we knew would begin to

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:42.480
migrate to a one-day service.

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:46.890
The big difference for us is all
about how we get product from our

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.140
fulfillment center to
that last-mile location.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.590
Last-mile is the most expensive
part of the delivery process.

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.710
Until an item arrives at a warehouse near
your home, it can be shipped in

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:59.070
bulk. But then each package needs to
be hand delivered to a different

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:01.740
address, which takes a lot of
people and a lot of time.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.150
Amazon pays to outsource much of
last-mile delivery to carriers like UPS

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.660
and USPS, which charge a fee,
and those fees just went up.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.350
In January the post office increased
its last-mile shipping rate by nine

00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:15.480
to 12% depending on package size.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.140
The more Amazon can keep last-mile
delivery in-house, the more it can

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.250
control these costs.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.880
To do that Amazon uses small
business partners, some delivering out of

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.320
20,000 Amazon vans.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.050
And in 2015 it launched Amazon Flex.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:35.070
I've been driving for Amazon Flex roughly since
2016 on and off, I'd say at

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:36.810
least two solid years.

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:39.720
Amazon Flex is available
in about 50 U.S.

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.530
cities. Anyone over 21 with a
driver's license, auto insurance and at

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.270
least a mid-size sedan can sign up.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.110
After clearing a basic background check,
drivers in areas with open spots

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:51.120
can start picking up
and delivering packages.

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:54.900
Drivers use the Flex app to sign up
for a block, which ranges from three

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.680
to six hours.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.560
Then they head to a warehouse where
they find out how many boxes they've

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.180
been assigned to deliver
in that timeframe.

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.470
Amazon advertises that drivers make $18
to $25 an hour and they're

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:08.310
responsible for their own vehicle costs
like gas, tolls and maintenance.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:11.790
Amazon wouldn't disclose how many drivers
have signed up or what

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:15.000
percentage of its last-mile deliveries are
made by Flex drivers compared

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.050
to its shipping partners.

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.500
But it did tell us their
last mile delivery programs are expanding.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:23.460
We've built out these small businesses,
the delivery service providers, and

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.790
we have Flex which is
our on-demand crowdsourced delivery piece.

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:31.380
So we need all of that to meet the
various types of delivery we do in each

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:34.860
of our geographies and I think you're
going to see expansion on all fronts

00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:35.070
there.

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:39.420
Amazon has one unusual approach to
increase its number of small business

00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.890
partners helping with last-mile.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:44.700
Amazon says it will contribute as
much as 10,000 thousand dollars if

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.880
full-time employees want to leave the
company and start their own package

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.990
delivery services.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.790
Early response is great.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.600
It allows us to complement the capacity
that we have with our great

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.320
carrier partners.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:00.090
It's great for some of our employees who
don't want to do the same thing

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.670
that they've been doing in the warehouse
for five or 10 years. They

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:06.390
want to learn some new skills
and over 16,000 employees have already

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:07.050
taking us up on this.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.220
Amazon is also looking at several
high-tech solutions to streamline last

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:11.970
mile delivery.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.960
In June, Amazon announced its new
autonomous delivery drone will be

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:19.830
operating within months and it has a
one year FAA permit to test them.

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:24.600
We're building fully electric drones that can
fly up to 15 miles and

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.380
deliver packages under five pounds to
customers in under 30 minutes.

00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:32.550
Amazon also has patents out for a
giant flying warehouse and drones that

00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:34.980
can react to flailing
hands and screaming voices.

00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:38.550
And it's even testing a sidewalk
robot called Scout to bring packages

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:41.910
right to your door.

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.760
All these steps are an incredible
challenge to pull off. In

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.760
recent years, Amazon has faced an
onslaught of negative press about

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.980
working conditions at every
step of the process.

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:52.650
We spoke to several
workers about their concerns.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.160
The working conditions at Amazon
are dangerous and that's systemic.

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:00.750
I've worked in five different buildings
in three different states from

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.810
coast to coast and
it's the same everywhere.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.780
It might not be outright exploitation but
it is almost like a disposable

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.710
workforce.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:16.080
It's been so pervasive that many of the
pilots, in fact most of the pilots

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:19.620
at our airlines are
actively seeking employment elsewhere.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:23.640
Last year Amazon raised the minimum wage
to fifteen dollars for all its

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.260
350,000 U.S.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.930
employees, more than double the
federal minimum wage of $7.25.

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:32.670
In his annual letter to shareholders,
owner Jeff Bezos challenged other

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.560
top retail companies to match this.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.770
And Amazon offers generous benefits.

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.310
I needed my medical insurance.

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:45.850
That's what's essentially kept
me at Amazon.

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:49.900
But some workers, most who asked
to remain anonymous, told us Amazon

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.840
expects them to keep up
a fast, often unreasonable pace.

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:57.730
They say that they care
about their employees and quality.

00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.920
But no, it's really
just about numbers.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:04.060
You have to make not only a certain
rate but you can't accrue more than 30

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.580
minutes of time-off-task per day
otherwise you get written up.

00:12:06.790 --> 00:12:09.520
Usually most buildings are at
least a million square feet.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.290
You could be walking three to five
minutes each way to go to bathroom.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.230
So if you went to the bathroom twice
you could easily use up that 30

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:21.610
minutes. So a lot of people
don't go to the bathroom.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:24.280
CNBC was connected to Fuller through
the Retail, Wholesale and Department

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:24.910
Store Union.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.440
Although he's not a union member.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.010
We asked Amazon about the
working conditions in fulfillment centers.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:33.520
We have world class facilities, we
have restrooms all over this place.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.200
We have break rooms. We

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.800
have TVs.

00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:38.650
Anybody who is watching, don't
take my word for it.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:41.290
Please come take a tour
and see for yourself.

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.180
I'll put us up
against anybody any day.

00:12:43.570 --> 00:12:47.260
Do you feel like the pace that workers
are asked to work out is reasonable?

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.730
Well our, the way we look at
productivity rates, just like anyone, we have

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:55.750
expectations. In every job, my job
has expectations, your job has the

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:59.440
expectations. The way we set the rates
and the processes are based on

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:04.510
actual performance and the overwhelming majority
of employees are able to

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.770
meet those expectations.

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:09.940
Warehouse workers told us their productivity
is closely tracked based on

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:11.350
how often they scan a package.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.340
Workers told us they can get written
up if they don't meet certain metrics.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.330
Amazon also has patents for a
GPS-enabled wristband that could track

00:13:19.330 --> 00:13:20.920
workers' movements and breaks.

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:25.780
I think too often people look at
that technology and sort of debate, is

00:13:25.780 --> 00:13:29.440
this Big Brother tracking an employee
or something to that effect?

00:13:29.490 --> 00:13:33.130
And you know really almost all the
time you look at these wearables or

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:36.460
other types of things like that,
they're usually some form of safety

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:37.030
device.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.600
Workers can lose their jobs if
they don't work fast enough.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.350
At one warehouse in Baltimore, The
Verge reported that Amazon terminated

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:49.270
300 full-time associates in a one-year
period between 2017 and 2018 for

00:13:49.270 --> 00:13:52.840
inefficiency. Amazon said in a statement
that "the number of employee

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.780
terminations have decreased over the last
two years at our Baltimore

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:57.790
facility as well as
across North America."

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:57.800
Amazon workers are under attack. What do
we do? Stand up, fight back.

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:06.490
There have been several protests in the
last few years around the world

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.070
where Amazon workers have
demanded better working conditions.

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:12.670
In orientation they
talked about safety.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:14.800
That was the number one thing.

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:20.770
Safety. And you get
there and that's forgotten.

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:26.680
In the UK, ambulances were called to
Amazon warehouses 600 times from 2015

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:27.520
to 2018.

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:30.730
In April, the National Council
for Occupational Safety and Health

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.810
identified Amazon as one of a
"dirty dozen" companies, citing six deaths

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.840
in seven months and
13 deaths since 2013.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.070
But Amazon says that last year alone
it spent $55 million in safety

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.700
improvements at fulfillment centers and its
employees got a million hours

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:46.570
of safety training.

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.760
As Amazon increases the shipping speed,
can they also increase conditions

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.600
to be more fair, equitable and
sustainable as far as safety goes?

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.940
Well I'm incredibly proud of the safety
record of our sites and the focus

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.320
of our leadership team on safety.

00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:06.880
Any incident is one too many and
anytime something happens, our teams come

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.880
together and figure out what happened and get
to the root cause and try to

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.950
eliminate anything from occurring
again in the future.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:16.350
Amazon Air is another area where growth
in the program has led to

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:20.370
challenges. Amazon-branded planes are flown
by contract pilots from Atlas

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.990
Air, ABX and Southern Air.

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:24.840
These airlines negotiate contracts
with the pilots.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:28.470
And five of these pilots told
us working conditions have deteriorated

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:30.600
since their airlines started
flying for Amazon.

00:15:31.350 --> 00:15:35.220
As a result of Amazon being such a
large company, they have the ability to

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:40.080
put a very strong pressure on our
companies and have them drive down our

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.510
pay and working conditions as pilots.

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:45.540
Dan Wells heads up the
union that represents these pilots.

00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.520
They protested outside Amazon's annual
shareholder meeting in May.

00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:54.090
They also spoke out in April against
poor working conditions and low pay

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.440
near the new Amazon air hub.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.280
We have a hard time
maintaining enough qualified pilots.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:04.440
There's a tremendous amount of turnover
at these carriers which in net

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.250
reduces experience and creates a lot of
stress on things, a lot of

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:13.050
frustration, which certainly distracts people
from their duties as pilots.

00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:16.950
In February, an Amazon Air plane
operated by Atlas Air crashed near

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:19.020
Houston, killing all
three pilots aboard.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.530
The cause of the crash is
under investigation with initial National

00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:25.770
Transportation Safety Board findings showing
the pilots may have lost

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.820
control of the plane.

00:16:27.510 --> 00:16:30.450
In interviews with Business Insider
weeks before, several Amazon Air

00:16:30.450 --> 00:16:32.640
pilots said they thought
an accident was inevitable.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.360
They cited low wages that made
it difficult to attract experienced pilots,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.840
training they considered shoddy,
fatigue and poor morale.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:44.370
Pilots that are working for
Amazon's contractors are overwrought with

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.730
schedules and scheduling changes
and constant training.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:52.920
All of those things have added to
greatly increasing the risk in the cargo

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:54.570
system that we fly in.

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:58.980
In a statement Amazon said, "All
of our airline delivery providers must

00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.340
comply with the Amazon Supplier Code
of Conduct and Federal Aviation

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:03.870
Administration regulations.

00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:07.740
We take seriously any allegation that
a delivery provider is not meeting

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.710
those requirements and expectations
and review accordingly."

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:16.630
Workers bringing packages that last mile to
your door also told us safety

00:17:16.630 --> 00:17:17.320
is a concern.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.310
One reason: Amazon doesn't provide Flex
drivers with any branded clothing

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:22.180
to identify them.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:28.300
I'm pulling up to this house and I get
to the front door and you know this

00:17:28.300 --> 00:17:30.580
guy just comes running out like,
"Hey what are you doing?"

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.660
and he's talking so fast and I
was thinking you know I'm in Connecticut.

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.690
You know I'm a Puerto Rican guy in
a white guy's yard and like, you know,

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:40.240
what if he just comes out and
shoots me in the face without asking

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.740
questions? You know that was my fear.

00:17:42.490 --> 00:17:45.640
After another delivery where he says
a customer let his German Shepherd

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:49.540
charge at him, Jonathan paid 45 dollars out
of his own pocket for a custom

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.530
sweater on Etsy.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.400
I think Amazon the least they could do
is give us something that would make

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.910
it a little bit safer and make
us more visible when we're out there

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.460
delivering.

00:17:57.790 --> 00:18:01.480
I've gotten a lot of mean glares
from people because they're like, "Who is

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.380
this guy? He's just in

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:04.960
front of my driveway or he's
parked in front of my house.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.910
He's just wearing a yellow vest."

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.350
You don't even have to
wear that vest. It's

00:18:08.350 --> 00:18:13.720
just, I do it because at
least I look less suspicious.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:16.840
In a statement Amazon said, "They are
welcome to wear the safety vests that

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.510
we have available for them in the
delivery stations while they're on their

00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:22.630
route which can help
customers identify Flex participants.".

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.350
And some drivers told us the way
the Flex app works encourages distracted

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:30.160
driving because it requires drivers to
manually tap refresh to secure

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.030
their next assignment.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:36.550
If you want to get blocks then you
have to be tapping on that refresh

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:39.440
button in the app
pretty much constantly.

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.160
But how do you do
that while you're delivering?

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:44.890
So it encourages people to
do it while they're driving.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:49.500
In a statement Amazon says, "Safety is our
top priority and we are proud of

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:50.610
our safe driving record.

00:18:50.850 --> 00:18:54.180
We regularly communicate a variety of
safety topics including loading and

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.770
driving practices with drivers.

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.520
Amazon Flex participants can also sign up
for delivery blocks up to a week

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:01.290
in advance through the
Amazon Flex app."

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:06.750
Amazon is working to ease the burden
on its delivery drivers and save money

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.980
with high-tech solutions like those drones
and Scout sidewalk robots, and

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.230
its fulfillment centers are
becoming more automated, too.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:18.270
Our focus on automation has really been
begin in automation in the places

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:20.760
that can be most
beneficial to the workforce.

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:26.280
Remove the most tedious task, remove
the heaviest lifting task, whether

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.210
that be lifting large containers or
bringing the inventory to the

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:32.640
associate so they don't have to
walk through Earth's most massive

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.710
selection in order to find
the thing they're looking for.

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:40.080
But for now Amazon still relies on people
to bring us our packages in just

00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.190
one day. And with expectations for
rapid delivery only growing, Amazon

00:19:44.190 --> 00:19:47.040
will need to continue innovating
to make shipping even faster.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.150
We will see shipping
speeds increase every day.

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.040
The announcement that Amazon is going
to one-day is ironic because in

00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:58.500
certain regions we have it
in an hour already.

00:19:59.190 --> 00:20:00.420
That's not going to stop.

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:04.260
And what's absolutely critical is any
company that sticks their head in

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.830
the sand even if it's Amazon.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:08.100
We'll see the competition
pass them by.

00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:10.250
That's the one guarantee
we have in retail.
