&gt;&gt; JERRY FALWELL: David, I looked around just
now, and I noticed more and more often, I'm

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.100
the oldest guy on the stage.
That never happened before, so I'm getting

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.250
up there.
But we're so thrilled to have our guest here

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.400
today.
You know the events of 2016 were so riveting

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.970
that it was hard to pull yourself away from
cable news during that election year.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.260
It was just like nobody could have made up
what happened in a novel.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.620
It was so incredible, all the different events.
But it was so nice, after all the serious

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:43.610
talking hits finished for Jesse Watters to
come on and give us some comic relief.

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.930
He exposed how many low-information voters
there are out there, but he did it in a respectful

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.300
way, in a comical way.
And I was just so impressed by Him, when we

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.070
ran into him, Becki and I, at one of the presidential
debates, we invited him to come to Liberty,

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.530
and he graciously accepted.
But he has his own show now on Saturday night

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.740
at 8 o'clock: Watter's World.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:19.370
He's been— I thought IPTV never worked.
So, somebody must be watching it. Is that

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:27.230
true by the way?
All right, somebody's going to be in trouble.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.670
But he's also done the segment Watter's World
on Bill O'Reilly.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.680
He started out as a production assistant,
and he worked his way up at Fox.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.119
He's got two twin daughters, and I didn't
catch your wife's name—Noelle.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.549
But he's happily married, and he was on Air
Force One last week interviewing the president.

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.579
We are very honored and privileged to have
Jesse Watters at Liberty University today.

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:58.609
Please give him a welcome.&nbsp;

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:14.310
&gt;&gt; JESSE WATERS: How you guys doing?
I'm Watters, and this is my world.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:23.160
Thank you! ‘So, last time I was in front
of all these college students, I was doing

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.489
some interviews for Watter's World, and I
said to one guy, "What year did America declare

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:37.010
our independence?"
And the guy looks at me, and he says, "The

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.900
1980s!"
So, I didn't know that Reagan beat the Soviets

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.250
and the British.
It's news to me.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.610
But that guy was in front of the marijuana
dispensary, so we're just going to let that

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.090
slide.
I was going to wear my collar up today, but

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.190
I hear wearing your collar up in Lynchburg
means a little something different, didn't

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:06.709
want to give the wrong impression.
Last time I had my collar up, I had a pink

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:15.510
popped collar, and Dennis Miller said I looked
like gay Dracula—not that there's anything

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:21.700
wrong with that.
But I grew up in the 80s, and my parents were

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.110
hardcore hippies.
My parents were tear gassed protesting the

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.519
Vietnam War.
So, they would send me to these outdoor wilderness

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.680
camps, and all I wanted to do was hang out
at the pool, so I rebelled.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.180
And I was in college, and I said, you know
what, I want to make a little money.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.730
Because that's what all my friends were doing.
They were going to Wall Street and making

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.950
some cash.
So, I tried that, and it turns out you have

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.680
to have a basic grasp of arithmetic to handle
millions of dollars of other peoples' money.&nbsp;

00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:01.620
So, I was quickly fired from my job, and then
got a new job working for the Pataki re-election

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.580
campaign, governor of New York.
And we were running a candidate, Dora Irizarry.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.050
She was the attorney general candidate, and
we were running her against Elliot Spitzer.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.970
Remember Elliot Spitzer?
Well, he crushed us by about 30 points.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.760
We were in charge, my group, of doing opposition
research, and I guess we missed the fact that

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.130
Elliot Spitzer was sleeping with prostitutes
up and down the East Coast.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.610
Could have been useful information.
So, he won, and then we all know what happened

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.250
to Elliot.
But at that point, I was out of a job.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:46.040
So, I came to Fox News Channel, and I started
working 2 pm to midnight Tuesdays through

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.000
Sundays, no health insurance, free-lance.
I was in the basement, and I sat next to a

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.240
girl named Candy.
She dotted her ‘i’s with a heart.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.010
And then there was an opening on "The Factor."
And I said, “Man, I've got to get this job.”

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:08.440
So, I went up, and I interviewed with O'Reilly.
And I went up to Bill's radio studio, and

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:12.510
I sat down.
And he looks at me, dead silence.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:21.390
And he says, Watters, what's your father do?
Told him what my dad did, and more dead silence.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:27.070
And I said, "Bill, I really liked your new
book. It was a great read."

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.610
And he perks up, and he goes, "You seem like
a smart kid. You start Monday."

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:39.430
So, Bill hired me, but then he almost fired
me.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.210
We have a pitch meeting every week where we
get in a circle and pitch stories we think

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.660
would be good for "The Factor," and Bill's
up there just crushing people.

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.350
“That's not going to get a rating! “
“What are you, an idiot?”

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.010
And I get up, and I pitch.
And Bill cuts me off and says, "Interns don't

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.380
pitch! Next?"
And the producer says, Bill, you just hired

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.780
this guy.
This is Jesse. He's your new production assistant.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.990
And he says, "All right, Watters, what have
you got? Go."

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.950
And I pitch, and I bomb.
And that afternoon, my producer brings me

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:17.240
up to his office, and he says, Jesse, unfortunately,
Bill does not think you're articulate enough

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.590
to do the show.
You have one week to turn it around, or you're

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:27.670
fired.
So, I panic, and I worked so hard the next

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:35.160
week looking for good stories, trying to deliver
my pitches well, and eventually I got the

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.260
hang of it.
And I'm at the next pitch meeting, and I said,

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:44.190
“Bill, there's this judge down in Alabama,
and he just gave a very soft sentence to this

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.600
sex offender who molested a young child.”
And Bill says, “All right Watters, you're

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.750
going to go down to Alabama, and you're going
to confront the judge.”

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:59.710
And I said, “Where is Alabama?”
I've been to Disney World.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.040
Yeah, Disney!

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:10.520
So, the next day, I'm staked out at 6 am in
front of this court house in rural Alabama.

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.060
Judge gets out, gets in the car.
We trail the judge through these backroads

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.930
of Alabama.
I hop out of the car with them like, “Judge

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:26.550
Bush, Judge Bush, how could you do this?”
And the guy says, “I'm not Judge Bush.”

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:31.620
And I said, “But, Judge Bush—“
He goes, “I'm not Judge Bush; I'm a state

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.050
trooper. But I'm going to tell Judge Busch
you're looking for him.”

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:41.140
So, the first time I ambushed, I ambushed
the wrong guy.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:45.830
Word got back that the judge knew I was in
town.

00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:49.710
He said, “I'll read a statement to you on
camera in my chamber.”

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.960
So, I call back to New York. And I didn't
tell Bill I booted the ambush, but I said,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.530
“Bill, he's going to talk to me. What should
I do?”

00:07:56.530 --> 00:08:01.770
And Bill says, “When he comes out in his
robe, yell at him!”

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:06.560
And I'm 23; I'm a nice guy, but I'm terrified
of O'Reilly.

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:12.210
So, judge comes out in his robe in his chamber.
Starts reading a statement, and I'm in the

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:16.830
back, and I interrupted him.
"Judge, don't you have anything to say to

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.670
the victim's family?
How do you live with yourself?

00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:23.390
Don't you believe in justice?"
And the judge gets frazzled.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.700
He scatters back to the chambers, and we bring
the tape back to New York.

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:31.740
And we roll it, and Bill's happy.
But he brings me back up to his office, and

00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:38.019
he says, "Watters, good job down there in
Alabama. One thing though, your voice is too

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:45.350
high-pitched for television.
You need a speech coach. Me? I never had that

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.350
problem."

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:51.100
So, that was Bill's advice to me.&nbsp;

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:54.839
And I don't know if you guys remember this.
A few weeks later there was a very, very heinous

00:08:54.839 --> 00:09:00.300
case down in Florida.
A young girl, Jessica Lunsford, six-year-old

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:08.160
child was kidnapped, repeatedly raped in a
trailer for four days while other people were

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:14.540
in the trailer, and then buried alive by a
thrice-convicted sex offender.

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:21.990
So, Bill was livid, and he wanted me to go
down and confront the slugs.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:27.389
Bill had nick-named the three other people
in the trailer “the slugs” for not ratting

00:09:27.389 --> 00:09:32.790
this guy out to the cops.
And these people were disgusting people.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:35.089
They were crack fiends—really horrific individuals.

00:09:35.089 --> 00:09:41.370
So, I go down to Homosassa, Florida.
I'm 25, don't know what I'm doing.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:47.029
60 dollars for the hotel room, mosquito netting
over the bed, and I said, Bill, how do I catch

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:49.660
up with these people?
Where do I go?

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:54.490
These are off the grid people.
Bill goes, go to the local watering whole.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:10:01.480
Talk to the locals, get the drop on the slugs.
So, I go to Colonel Frogs, this bar down in

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.879
Homosassa, and I'm knocking back two-dollar
beers with the locals, trying to get the drop

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:08.370
on the slugs.
And they tell me where the trailer park is.&nbsp;

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:11.029
I roll up on the trailer park.
And this guy pulls down the window.

00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:13.240
He goes, “They're over this way, over on
that trailer.”

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:20.279
But they have two vicious dogs.
I'm a little afraid of dogs. Sorry.

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:26.980
So, I go to the 7-Eleven, and I buy some snausages,
you know, some little Scooby Snacks to throw

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.840
the dogs off.
So, we roll up on the trailer park, and these

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:34.130
vicious dogs start charging me.
And they're barking, and they're carrying

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:35.170
on.
And I grab the snausage.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.600
I throw the snausage down, and the dogs run
for the snausage, and they're distracted.

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:46.600
And I keep rolling up to the trailer.
And we see this hideous woman, Dorothy Dixon,

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.640
and she's scrambling around the trailer.
And I confront her on camera, you know.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.720
How could you do this? Why didn't you give
these people up to the cops?

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.170
This girl could've been alive right now.
And we got great footage.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.629
And I call back to New York, and I said, Bill,
we got it. Bill goes,

00:11:01.629 --> 00:11:08.499
"Alright, Watters. Drive three hours North
to Tampa. You're going to be on the show tonight."

00:11:08.499 --> 00:11:11.279
And I'm still a little hung over from knocking
back drinks with the locals.

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:15.860
I didn't have anything to wear either.
So, I drive three hours North to Tampa.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.670
Go to a Walmart—first time and last time
I've ever been in a Walmart.

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:28.800
I mean, come on. I'm from New York.
And I buy a blazer and a tie at Walmart, and

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.379
expensed it, obviously, and then go on the
air that night.

00:11:33.379 --> 00:11:35.899
And I did well enough, so Bill kept on putting
me on.

00:11:35.899 --> 00:11:40.490
And we used to run rough shod over these judges
for giving soft sentences to sex offenders.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:46.939
We had a lot of laws change across the country.
Jessica's Law, which I'm very proud of, mandatory,

00:11:46.939 --> 00:11:59.670
minimum 25-year sentence for first time rape
of a child under 13.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:02.529
Forty-five states passed that. Very proud
of that.&nbsp;

00:12:02.529 --> 00:12:07.649
And so, after I had&nbsp;kind of gotten a little
more seasoned, Bill came up with the idea

00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:12.080
for Watter's World.
And the concept was, he goes, “Watters,

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:18.730
we're going to have you go out on the streets
and find out how much young people know.”

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:27.360
It turns out, not so much. And he named the
segment after the biggest box-office bomb

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.829
of all time, ‘Water World.”
The guy's got a great sense of humor.

00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:41.230
So, we started hitting the streets, and these
are some actual answers of Watter's World

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:47.610
questions.
Are you guys ready?

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:53.779
Who was the first president of the United
States?

00:12:53.779 --> 00:13:10.279
George Bush.
Or, who won the Civil War?

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:20.339
France.
Or one of my favorites, who did America fight

00:13:20.339 --> 00:13:29.649
in the Vietnam War?
Not a trick question.

00:13:29.649 --> 00:13:36.957
South Korea.
I could go on and on, you want me to do some

00:13:36.957 --> 00:13:42.720
more?
I like this one.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:50.589
What body of water is on the East coast of
the United States?

00:13:50.589 --> 00:14:04.639
The Red Sea.
He was in LA, so—

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:11.899
Or one of my other favorites: what do you
think about Ebola?

00:14:11.899 --> 00:14:22.300
It's nice.
It's funny, but it's also sad, because people

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:25.680
are oblivious.
I'm not saying they're stupid; they're just

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:32.360
not paying attention.
And this was basically the electorate a couple

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:38.149
years ago.
So, this was the status quo, and we were facing

00:14:38.149 --> 00:14:40.459
an election.
And who was running?

00:14:40.459 --> 00:14:47.120
Who were the big shots?
It was going to be Hillary Clinton vs. Jeb

00:14:47.120 --> 00:15:02.209
Bush—the two most boring people in the world.
And these politicians can bamboozle and hoodwink

00:15:02.209 --> 00:15:05.009
oblivious individuals, and that's what's been
happening.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:09.360
That's why we're 20 trillion in debt.
That's why we have no weapons of mass destruction.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:15.250
That's why Obamacare is a disaster, because
people get fooled, because no one votes, and

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:29.160
no one cares.
But then, down came the escalator Donald Trump.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.809
I mean I was looking at Melania the whole
time;

00:15:30.809 --> 00:15:38.199
I didn't even see Donald.
I'm not coveting her; I'm just saying—

00:15:38.199 --> 00:15:46.649
So, he comes down, and he gives this speech,
and he says the thing about the Mexican rapists,

00:15:46.649 --> 00:15:51.929
and all heck breaks loose.
And the media's just glomming on to that.

00:15:51.929 --> 00:15:56.990
Meanwhile, if you look at the news, there's
an illegal alien rape epidemic right now that

00:15:56.990 --> 00:16:00.529
the media’s burying.
But anyway, they're latched onto that, but

00:16:00.529 --> 00:16:02.820
they don't realize there's a new sheriff in
town.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:11.000
So, the next big event is the Iowa State Fair.
Now, for those of you guys who don't know

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.360
what that's all about, that's where they have
deep fried butter, right?

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.439
I've never been—
You kiss a pig, something like that.

00:16:19.439 --> 00:16:24.350
I don't even know.
I'm from Philly.

00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:32.319
Hey, all right!
So, this is where politicians pretend to be

00:16:32.319 --> 00:16:38.810
real people, and press the flesh, and try
to win votes. But what does Donald Trump do?

00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:46.529
In his $3,000 suit, lands his helicopter right
in the middle of the state fair, takes a bite

00:16:46.529 --> 00:16:54.810
of pork chop on a stick, and then starts giving
little kids a ride around on the helicopter.

00:16:54.810 --> 00:17:00.390
Totally owns the state fair, and the media's
missing this, because they're underestimating

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:01.879
him.
And they're not realizing he's starting to

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:05.700
resonate with regular people.
And the media's saying, you know, this guy's

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.540
not serious.
He's not going to run.

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.310
Remember, they said he wasn't going to win
the primaries and he wasn't going to win the

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.721
general.
And then after he won the general, he was

00:17:13.721 --> 00:17:19.160
going to resign and let Pence go.
And they've been doing this the whole time.

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.590
And then we have the San Bernardino shooting.
And what happened there was the guy never

00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:29.840
should have been let in the country.
We all know there was a huge, huge gap in

00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:33.841
screening there.
And Obama comes out, the president, and he

00:17:33.841 --> 00:17:40.760
says Islam has nothing to do with this, and
we need gun control.

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:45.480
And Donald Trump comes out and says Islam
has everything to do with this, and if the

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:52.560
good guys had guns, these guys would've gotten
taken out.

00:17:52.560 --> 00:18:03.010
So, at that point, Trump really elevates himself
to the same level as President Obama.

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:06.790
And he's right in the national conversation,
right on the same level, really showing leadership

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:09.120
qualities at this point.

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:15.090
And we're rolling into the first debate. Do
you guys remember what happened at the first

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:23.080
debate? A lot of energy. Fox News debate.
Megan Kelly comes up, and she's teed up.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.760
She's ready to go with this question.
You know, Donald, with the women, blah, blah,

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:33.090
blah. You're so mean. You said this and that—“Only
Rosie O'Donnell.”

00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:46.210
And he wins the night on that alone, a homerun.
But that begins a year-long drama with Megan

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:50.260
Kelly and Fox News.
So, there's a lot of behind the scenes negotiations

00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:56.120
going on, and the chairman gets involved,
and it's a mess, because Donald, you know,

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.580
defends his honor, takes everything personally.
I understand that.

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.030
And he drops out of the next debate, does
his own thing for charity.

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:10.390
Ends up coming in second in Iowa, and who
beats him?

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:16.940
Ted Cruz.
But, Ted Cruz then becomes "lying Ted."

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.770
So, you all remember what happened at these
debates.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:29.260
"Little Marco," "lying Ted," I mean Trump
is a branding expert, and he's going middle

00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:34.650
school on these cats and knocking them down
one by one, just ridiculing them.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:44.660
"Low energy Jeb"—my favorite one was that
he called Mitt Romney “poor.”

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:50.260
The guy's worth a quarter billion dollars;
he's “poor,” and apparently, he walks

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:55.650
like a penguin.
So, Trump's just slaying these guys, and no

00:19:55.650 --> 00:20:02.680
one's ever seen anything like this before.
And it's fun, but he's winning and ends up

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:06.250
winning the primary, and we're rolling into
the summer.

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.820
And the campaign's a skeleton campaign.
The guy's got nothing going on back behind

00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:14.400
the scenes, so he's got to start boosting
things up.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:19.000
Then what happens?
Hillary Clinton.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.210
Comey comes out, FBI director, and everyone's
like this.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.420
“He's going to indict her. He's going to
indict her; here we go.”

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:30.270
Saying she doesn't even know what this means,
and she's confused by her Blackberry, and

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:35.870
it's a joke.
So, he comes up and says we're not going to

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:40.490
indict her.
And if any of us had done anything close to

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:45.990
what she did, we would have been indicted.
So, that becomes now the narrative of this

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.750
system is rigged.
And in a way, it helps Trump, because he's

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.210
now running against a rigged system.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:21:00.300
So, we're moving now into the RNC, and the
first night of the RNC, what happens?

00:21:00.300 --> 00:21:05.090
Melania plagiarizes the speech.
Poor Melania.

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:12.360
Must have been a tough night at Trump Tower.
And, you know, the press is just joking around

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:17.130
about all these knuckle heads, these B-list
celebrities like Scott Baio and the Duck Dynasty

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.930
guys, and they're kind of missing the energy
and enthusiasm at the convention.

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:26.640
I was in Cleveland.
There was a lot of love at that convention.

00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:31.690
And the press just missed that, so Trump comes
up at the end and gives this killer speech.

00:21:31.690 --> 00:21:34.480
America first.
Make America great again.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.580
Build a wall.
Drain the swamp.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:43.330
He starts hitting all the right notes, and
complete grand slam.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:48.320
And then the DNC comes along, and on the first
night, I think, Debbie Wasserman Schultz,

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:52.770
the chairwoman of the DNC gets canned, because
she got caught rigging the primary against

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:56.750
poor Bernie.
So, Bernie's troops are out in the streets

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.420
with the dreadlocks, and the weed, and they're
angry.

00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.800
You know, it's a mess, and there's a huge
civil war going on in the Democratic Party

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:09.520
that the press is not reporting on.
But I see it, because I'm in the streets.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.040
And Geraldo gets bottles of water poured on
him, and it's a mess.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:20.170
So, Hillary comes out, and is totally overshadowed
by every other speaker, because she's low-energy,

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:24.280
and she slept walked through the entire race,
as we know.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:28.490
But what does Trump do instead?
He gets into an argument with a gold star

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:34.300
family after that convention, and his poll
numbers plummet.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:39.240
So now he's really hitting the skids, and
he's got to start turning things around.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:43.630
So, what does he do?
Fires everybody—you're fired—and brings

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:49.460
in a new team of fresh faces.
Bannon, Kellyanne, you know, real soldiers,

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:55.290
great, talented people.
And Trump begins to read from a teleprompter.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:23:00.190
Now, we used to make fun of President Obama
for the teleprompter, but we love Trump on

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:04.841
the teleprompter, now.
He's stopping riffing. He's not going off

00:23:04.841 --> 00:23:08.410
on tangents.
He's not telling people to punch people in

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:14.990
the audience, and that's a good thing, because
now he's supposed to be, quote, presidential.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:17.910
And in August he turns this thing around.
You see the poll numbers come up, because

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:26.850
he starts hitting these solid themes of keep
America safe, one term limit for the guys

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:31.100
on Washington.&nbsp;

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:36.310
And then Hillary starts coughing a lot.
Remember poor Hillary?

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:40.570
And she starts taking lots of days off.
I don't know what she was doing.

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:46.330
And then we remember— this is on camera—Hillary
faints.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:55.190
Are you clapping?
Wow. I mean I'd faint too if I was married

00:23:55.190 --> 00:24:04.520
to Bill, obviously.
So, she goes down, and people are worried

00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.420
about Hillary.
And the poll numbers start coming back up,

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:13.730
and it's the first debate in Hofstra.
So, we're at the first debate, and Trump's

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.580
bragging about how he's not studying, and
we're like, okay.

00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:21.420
Let's see how he does.
And the guy leaves a ton of meat on the bone,

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:28.170
really could have hammered her, didn't.
And he did okay, but at the end, he gets into

00:24:28.170 --> 00:24:32.920
another fight with some beauty queen from
Venezuela or God knows where.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:38.380
And the numbers start going down again, so
we're getting a little nervous again.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:45.320
So, what happens next? Billy Bush happens
next.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:50.120
Locker room talk, and he gives kind of an
apology.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:56.660
But in traditional Trump style, doubles down,
and what does he do at the second debate?

00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:04.170
He brings every single Bill Clinton mistress
and alleged sexual assault victim to the debate

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:14.280
and holds a press conference and hour beforehand.
You know, putting Paula Jones in eyesight

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:18.070
of Bill. I mean Melania's already there, so
Bill's distracted.&nbsp;

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:29.410
So, everyone's freaking out, and Trump comes
up and actually pretty graciously and effectively

00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:39.100
puts the locker room talk to rest, and then
comes out and just annihilates Hillary, completely

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:45.360
destroys her in a very, very substantive,
fact-based way.

00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:53.780
And at one point he said if I was president,
you'd be in jail, and the house comes down.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:26:00.730
We had the "lock her up" chants coming, so
now, a strange thing happens.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:04.610
The numbers don’t improve, and I'm looking
at the polls and I'm thinking, why?

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:09.560
Because this guy just obliterated this poor
woman, and he should be at least tied, and

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:14.630
he's still down 10 to 15.
Something is not right.

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:21.110
And then a series of things come out.
About a week or two before you have WikiLeaks,

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:24.770
and it turns out the Clinton foundation's
full of corruption.

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.950
Hillary has a public position and a private
position.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:33.610
Everybody hates Chelsea.
They're worried about bimbo eruptions, and

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:37.460
no one's really reporting it except Fox news.&nbsp;

00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.610
And then another series of things begins to
happen.

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:46.960
Obama premiums all the sudden come up.
James O'Keefe releases these hidden camera

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.430
videos.
It shows Democrats bragging about how they

00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:55.670
commit voter fraud.
Democrats are admitting that they were sending

00:26:55.670 --> 00:27:03.030
in thugs to start fights at Trump rallies.
And the whole thing's starting to come unglued.

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:07.790
Then Comey comes out, does his thing, reopens
the criminal investigation because of our

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:14.520
friend Anthony Wiener.
Poor Huma.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.580
And you think he should be tied, but he's
still not.

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:22.600
He's down now about five points.
And everyone thinks it's going to be landslide

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:27.240
city.
Hillary's got fireworks ready to go, you know,

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:29.910
champagne’s on ice.
And we have this third debate.

00:27:29.910 --> 00:27:32.750
The third debate was kind of boring even though
it was a Fox news debate.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:36.340
Don't tell Chris Wallace I said that.
But the only thing to come out of that debate

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.680
was that when they asked Trump if he was going
to abide by the results of the election; he

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.850
said, “maybe.”
I'll check it out, see what's happening.

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:48.080
You know, because maybe there could have been
fraud, or it's close.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:54.810
And people said this guy's going to be a dagger
through the heart of the constitution.

00:27:54.810 --> 00:27:58.570
There's going to be a crisis.
And what happened?

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:02.380
It turned out Hillary was the one that didn't
accept the results of the election.

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:09.190
So, they vote, and the day before, Trump's
going to Michigan, and he's going to Wisconsin.

00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:12.940
You're thinking, what's this guy doing?
Why's he going to these places?

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:18.300
Well I guess he knew something we didn't know.
That blue wall came down.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:27.860
And on election night, Trump wins, and Donald
Trump is the next president of the United

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:34.010
States.&nbsp;
But Hillary doesn't even concede, and so what

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.640
does the left do?
They start rioting.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:41.820
They start burning things.
They did the exact same thing that they had

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:47.330
accused the right that they were supposed
to be doing if Trump had lost.

00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:53.880
So completely embarrassed themselves, and
then we hear about the Russians did it.

00:28:53.880 --> 00:29:02.140
Russia hacked the election.
Now the only hacking that effected the election

00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:09.080
was Hillary's cough, because I haven't seen
any evidence of any Russian hacking.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.870
Let me know if you guys find anything.
I don't know.

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.990
But that seems to be where this is going.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:19.430
So, Trump's president. He's got the Trump
Tower transition deal going.

00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:24.940
You know, Kanye comes by and smooth.
And then he starts appointing people.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:29.900
You have a few mini-scandals.
He hits a homerun at the inauguration.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.060
I went to the ball.
It was a lot of fun.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:36.530
And then he gets this stem-winder at the State
of the Union.

00:29:36.530 --> 00:29:40.940
He's super-presidential.
Then he goes down; then he goes up.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:47.550
So, I need to interview this guy.
So, we lock in this interview in Nashville,

00:29:47.550 --> 00:29:52.120
and it's right before—what's up?
It's right before the speech, and we're in

00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.560
this little room.
And Trump comes in.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.840
Jesse, shakes my hand and yanks me right in
there.

00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:02.600
And I'm like this—power move city.
He says, does anybody have any hairspray.

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.680
Someone gives him hairspray.
Sits down across from me—“Jesse, see the

00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:14.910
crowd out there? Not even letting them in.
20,000, 50,000, 130,000 people lined up.”

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:23.940
“Mr. President, a lot of people out there.”
And, you know, he's still bragging about beating

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:26.300
Hillary.
And he says, “See my poll numbers? Best

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:30.720
they've ever been.”
And, you know, we sit down, do the interview.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.360
And I say, “Mr. President, do you mind if
I hitch a ride back on Air Force One? My flight

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.550
was cancelled.”

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:45.780
“Yeah, Jesse, hop on board.”
So, I climb into Air Force One, and I order

00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.610
some chicken over risotto.
And I hadn't even interviewed him yet, and

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:53.830
I just asked for a water.
My camera man orders a Corona.

00:30:53.830 --> 00:31:00.600
I'm like, my man, we haven't even turned the
cameras on, all right.&nbsp;

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:07.650
So, we come back there. We do a quick thing,
and then he tells me to turn the cameras off.

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:12.970
And I'm busting his chops, and I say, "Mr.
President, why are we listening to NSYNC on

00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:21.050
Air Force One?"
And he goes, "Oh, NSYNC? Love those guys.

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:27.200
Lance Bass is a stud. He's a good friend of
mine."

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:32.560
And I said, "Lance Bass?"
He said, "Yeah, I was at this party the other

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.360
day.
There was this Jets player from New York,

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.430
big physique, and there was this really beautiful
woman with him.

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:42.770
And Lance Bass walks by like this, and the
beautiful woman leaves the Jets player and

00:31:42.770 --> 00:31:55.070
goes after chasing Lance.
Lance Bass pulls a lot of chicks."

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:58.140
And I said, "Mr. President, Lance Bass is
gay."

00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:06.830
And he said, “He is?”
He goes, “All right Watters, I'm going to

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:09.050
talk to the failing New York Times right now.
I'll be right back.”

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:16.280
So, the guy's doing fine.
Everything is going to be okay, but the lesson

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:21.890
I'd like to just to just share with you guys
is I started from the bottom, rose to where

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:27.400
I was because of hard work.
And the press has completely underestimated

00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:33.800
Trump at every turn, and you can't listen
to the fake news media.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:39.390
The only media you guys need to listen to
is Fox News.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:33:35.050
Thank you guys very much.
