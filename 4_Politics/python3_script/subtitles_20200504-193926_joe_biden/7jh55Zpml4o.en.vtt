00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.090
JUDY WOODRUFF: Coronavirus infections and
deaths are ripping through the Navajo Nation,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.290
located on three different states.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.610
With an already vulnerable population, coordinating
care and information is not easy.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.680
As the "NewsHour"'s Stephanie Sy reports,
the community has taken on the challenge of

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:19.570
caring for their own people.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.460
STEPHANIE SY: In Navajo country, COVID-19
found its grip at a religious revival event

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.650
in early March in the upper western reaches
of the reservation.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.980
JONATHAN NEZ, President, Navajo Nation: We
have clan families that come all over the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:39.620
Navajo Nation to participate in this event.
And, boy, it just took off like wildfire after

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.620
that.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.850
STEPHANIE SY: After the so-called super spreader
event in Chilchinbito, President Jonathan

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.570
Nez put increasingly strict orders for social
distancing in place, including weekend curfews.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.710
BECKY BIZAHALONI, Granddaughter: I haven't
even, personally myself, been able to hug

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.579
my grandma. Stand at the door, drop off all
the stuff on the porch, and I just wave at

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.579
her. That's it.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.140
STEPHANIE SY: At least 52 people who live
on Navajo Nation have died from COVID-19,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.280
including one of 18-year old welder Trevor
Tacheene's relatives.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.070
TREVOR TACHEENE, Navajo Nation: One person
on the other side of my family has got it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.140
and has passed.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.250
I'm very concerned about it, because I have
family members that are young and are susceptible

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.060
to it. And it's scaring my mother and my father
every time we go out.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.450
STEPHANIE SY: Getting the message out about
social distancing on the reservation was initially

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.650
difficult. Nez broadcasts updates daily on
Facebook, but many households lack quality

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.630
Internet access.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.340
It's also not practical for many on the reservation
to follow stay-at-home orders. Sprawling across

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.159
three states with a population of more than
173,000, wide swathes of the Navajo Nation

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.710
are energy, food, and health care deserts,
and actual desert, with limited water.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.960
DR. JEROME ADAMS, Surgeon General of the United
States: We tell them to wash their hands,

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.500
but a study showed 30 percent of the homes
on Navajo Nation don't have running water.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.210
JONATHAN NEZ: You know, we're a vulnerable
population.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.110
STEPHANIE SY: One in five Native Americans
has diabetes. And there's a high prevalence

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.550
of obesity, both underlying conditions that
can make COVID-19 particularly dangerous.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.810
Even the younger people on Navajo Nation have
worse health outcomes.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.080
DR. DIANA HU, Pediatrician, Navajo Nation:
We are seeing some patients that are not over

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.910
60 that are coming in with severe COVID illness,
because -- and they almost all have comorbid

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:31.910
conditions.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.250
STEPHANIE SY: Dr. Diana Hu has been working
at the Tuba City Regional Health Care Center

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.720
for more than 30 years. The pediatric ward,
where she normally works, has been turned

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.510
into a respiratory clinic, as has much of
the hospital, since COVID-19 struck.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.810
DR. DIANA HU: It was actually almost like
a tsunami when this first started in the middle

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.550
of March, where we had, you know, nine or
10 people getting sick and a day that had

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.110
to be flown out for tertiary care.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.000
We get maybe one or two a day, and it's real
obvious when they're sick, unfortunately.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.020
STEPHANIE SY: Many Native American hospitals
are not equipped for multiple severe ventilator

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.590
cases. For now, patients are airlifted to
facilities in Phoenix and Flagstaff.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.000
But Dr. Hu and her colleagues are bracing
for an overwhelming surge.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.450
DR. DIANA HU: If you know any nurses that
want to come work up here, we'd love to have

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:18.450
them.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.540
STEPHANIE SY: This week, the University of
California-San Francisco, sent 14 nurses and

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:28.900
seven physicians to Navajo Nation to help.
The most pressing shortage has been personnel.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.590
And this thing has not peaked on the Navajo
Nation.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.400
DR. DIANA HU: We're not sure. If you look
at our statistics, which are per capita, it's

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.400
outrageous.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.170
The biggest issue I think that we have with
the federal government structure, the coordination

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:49.410
is pitting tiny places like us against states,
against other hospitals. And the coordination

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.310
is being left up to the states, which is very
difficult when you have something like the

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.310
Navajo Nation.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.690
STEPHANIE SY: Navajo Nation has one of the
highest rates in the country of COVID-19 on

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.130
a per capita basis, behind only New York and
New Jersey.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.840
In Arizona, about 20 percent of deaths from
COVID-19 have been Native Americans, when

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.090
they make up only 5 percent of the state's
population. The CARES Act granted $8 billion

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.390
to stabilize tribal communities, but the more
than 500 sovereign tribes had collectively

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.360
asked for closer to $20 billion.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.810
The Navajo have been the worst affected, but
other tribes are facing the same threat. In

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.540
New Mexico, multiple Native Pueblo communities
are seeing infection rates of coronavirus

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.950
higher than big cities.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.390
And the Red Lake community in Minnesota declared
medical martial law several weeks ago, containing

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.520
their spread to one person.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.760
Back on Navajo lands, President Nez described
the frustrating process of accessing federal

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.760
funds.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.750
JONATHAN NEZ: It's taken too long. Here in
Indian country, we're always -- it seems to

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.310
me we're always at the bottom of the list
when it comes to federal resources.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.760
STEPHANIE SY: The health disparities laid
bare by COVID-19 have reverberated across

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.070
the Navajo Nation since the time of European
colonization.

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.550
In 2009, the H1N1 flu was four times as deadly
in Native peoples as it was in the general

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.710
population. During the Spanish Flu pandemic
of 1918, a similar story.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.860
DR. DIANA HU: We can't change history. We
should just hopefully learn from it.

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.280
STEPHANIE SY: In recent days, vital resources
have been delivered, rapid test kits that

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.430
President Nez says can give results in less
than an hour.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.370
The National Guard has brought in supplies,
initially from its own stockpile of masks

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:45.990
and other protective gear. And people are
stepping up to fill the needs of their neighbors,

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.660
Navajo sewing masks for front-line workers.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:54.651
JENNIFER JAMES, Navajo Designer: I delivered
some to Kayenta Health Center, and they have

00:05:54.651 --> 00:05:56.130
been wanting more masks.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:59.810
STEPHANIE SY: Navajo delivering supplies to
the most isolated residents.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.800
SHANDIIN HERRERA, Community Organizer, Navajo
Nation: We definitely see the need to make

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.810
food and supplies like toilet paper and soap
available during this time.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.800
KIM SMITH, Community Organizer, Navajo Nation:
We came across an elder who lives alone, and

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.270
he has no food. So we packed extra, so that
we're able to give, in case we run into this

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.270
type of situation.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:23.630
STEPHANIE SY: And Navajo coming together in
shared struggle.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:29.550
JONATHAN NEZ: We're encouraging our elders
to share their stories, the stories of our

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.889
culture, our tradition, and our language,
so that our young people don't remember this

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:37.710
time as a scary moment.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:44.980
This is, in a way, what we have been praying
for, to reunite families, to reunite couples,

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.960
to hand down our language, our culture, tradition
to the next generation.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.270
STEPHANIE SY: It may be an optimistic way
of looking at a pandemic, but it's the stories

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.290
the Navajo tell that have helped them endure.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.170
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Stephanie Sy in
Phoenix.
