00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.360
This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org,
The War and Peace Report.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.360
I’m Amy Goodman.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.560
A shocking new report finds at least a third
of the Himalayan ice cap will melt by the

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:19.370
end of the century due to climate change,
even if the world’s most ambitious environmental

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.750
reforms are implemented.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.790
The report released Monday by The Hindu Kush
Himalaya Assessment is the culmination of

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.980
half a decade’s work by over 200 scientists,
with an additional 125 experts peer reviewing

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.120
their work.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.050
It warns rising temperatures in the Himalayas
could lead to mass population displacements,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.390
as well as catastrophic food and water insecurity.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.079
The glaciers are a vital water source for
the 250 million people who live in the Hindu

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.739
Kush Himalaya range, which spans from Afghanistan
to Burma.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.149
The region is home to the most ice in the
world, after Antarctica and the Arctic.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.350
And over a billion-and-a-half people depend
on the rivers that flow from the Himalayan

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:04.350
peaks.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.610
We turn now to the world-renowned environmental
leader and ecologist, who was born in Doon

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.860
Valley in the Himalayan foothills, Dr. Vandana
Shiva.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.320
She’s an Indian scholar and physicist, as
well as a food sovereignty and seed freedom

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.320
advocate.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.880
Dr. Shiva is also an alternative globalization
author who’s written more than 20 books.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.200
Her latest, Oneness vs. the 1% and Who Really
Feeds the World?

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.640
She founded Navdanya, “nine seeds,” a
movement promoting diversity and use of native

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
seeds.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.350
In 1993, Dr. Shiva was recipient of the Alternative
Nobel Peace Prize, the Right Livelihood Award.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.030
Vandana Shiva, welcome back to Democracy Now!

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.100
VANDANA SHIVA: My joy to be with you again,
Amy.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.780
AMY GOODMAN: It’s great to have you with
us.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.250
The title of this book, Oneness vs. the 1%,
explain.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.330
VANDANA SHIVA: Well, oneness is the recognition
that, A, we are part of one planet, and we

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.990
are one humanity.

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.310
And unless we live with that consciousness
and shape every moment of our production and

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.940
consumption with that consciousness, we are
going to destroy ourselves, which we are.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.400
The melting of the glaciers is one of the
very severe indicators.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.260
The 1 percent, of course, is the symbol of
the concentration of wealth under the rules

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.760
of the neoliberal economies, that are basically,
on the one hand, turning every natural resource

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.950
into a war zone.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:36.010
Even the Venezuelan issue is really a war
over oil.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.800
But war over seeds, that’s my life’s work,
to keep seeds free, because they literally

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.160
are a war over control of seeds, by a poison
cartel of three—Monsanto and Bayer, Syngenta

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.190
and ChemChina, Dow and DuPont—all of them
with their roots in Hitler’s Germany and

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.260
finding chemicals to kill people.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.410
No wonder they’re still killing people.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.970
No wonder they’re killing our butterflies
and our bees and our pollinators.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.849
And every indicator is showing we are not
just in a severe climate catastrophe; we are

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.870
in the sixth mass extinction.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.900
And both the species extinction and the climate
catastrophe are two sides of the same coin.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.140
AMY GOODMAN: Let’s start with Monsanto.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:20.349
Last month, India’s Supreme Court ruled
that Monsanto’s patent for Bt cotton seeds

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:21.349
is valid.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:27.599
You’ve questioned if a seed is an invention
and can be patented.

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.110
Talk about what Bt cotton is and why this
matters.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.209
VANDANA SHIVA: Amy, I was in the Supreme Court.

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.280
I’m an intervener in that case.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.090
And Monsanto does not have a patent on Bt
cotton.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.240
And the Supreme Court did not give it a patent
on Bt cotton.

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.400
The only way it could have done it is by striking
down India’s law, Article 3(J) of our patent

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.400
law.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.870
And I had a role with our Parliament: to shape
the amendments after the WTO trips forced

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.640
us to amend our laws.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:00.030
3(J) says plants, animals and seeds are not
human inventions, therefore they’re not

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.989
patentable, because a patent is only granted
for that which is invented.

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.760
So, what is the Bt cotton?

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.310
There are only two kinds of GMO seeds that
account for most genetically engineered crops

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.860
around the world.

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.079
One is a family of crops called Bt crops,
like Bt cotton—

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.910
AMY GOODMAN: What does “Bt” stand for?

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.600
VANDANA SHIVA: Bacillus thuringiensis, a soil
organism which produces an endotoxin, which

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.219
becomes a poison only in the gut of the caterpillar
family.

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:34.690
But in the plant, it’s a readymade toxin,
with a very broad spectrum of harm.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.940
And it’s supposed to be a pesticide-producing
plant.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.139
In fact, in the United States, it was approved
as a pesticide.

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.979
As a pesticide-producing plant, every cell
of the plant is releasing a toxin at very

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:49.979
high levels.

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.680
It’s supposed to control the bollworm pest.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:57.210
The bollworm has become resistant, which is
in the nature of evolution.

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.059
Life evolves to overcome threats.

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:06.570
And the Bt does not—Bt cotton seed does
not have a patent, for the simple reason our

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.719
laws don’t allow it.

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:15.770
Monsanto was illegally collecting royalties
via Indian seed companies, because they couldn’t

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.330
do what they did in this country, which is
sign licensing agreements directly with the

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.330
farmers.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.289
In India, they signed the licensing agreements
with the companies—with a lie that they

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:27.960
had a patent.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.840
They signed on the U.S. patent, but India
is a sovereign country, and patent laws are

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.659
sovereign laws.

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.789
When they wanted to extract more royalties
and the price of seed jumped 80,000 percent,

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.849
this is the main reason why the suicide belt
of India, where now 310,000 Indian farmers

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:49.659
have committed suicide, it overlaps largely
with the cotton belt.

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:53.909
And 99 percent of the cotton seed is controlled
by Monsanto.

00:05:53.909 --> 00:06:00.130
We have an anti-trust case in the Indian Competition
Commission saying 99 percent seed is a prima

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.319
facie monopoly.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:06.369
Eighty thousand percent jump in seed, and
it doesn’t work to control the pests.

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:07.520
Farmers got into debt.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.680
That’s the driver for farmer suicide.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.449
When the Indian companies said, “We can’t
keep paying.

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:15.449
Our farmers are dying.

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:22.610
We can’t extract more royalties,” Monsanto
sued them, using patent law, infringement.

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.229
That’s when I was involved.

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:29.830
I was called to intervene in the High Court,
and then I intervened in the Supreme Court.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:33.969
The attempt of Monsanto was to knock down
India’s law.

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:35.800
They failed.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.680
Its control over media, that’s why it’s
so important to have Democracy Now!, Amy,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.189
because the media is so totally in the hands
of the poison cartel.

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:46.919
They lied about what happened in the Supreme
Court that day.

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:47.919
AMY GOODMAN: What happened?

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:48.919
VANDANA SHIVA: They lost.

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:51.530
No, the Supreme Court said, “You go back
to trial.

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.900
It’s between two of you.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.419
It’s not an issue of us knocking down the
law.”

00:06:56.419 --> 00:07:06.689
They wanted to declare the genetically engineered
Bt as a chemical for which they wanted a product

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:11.930
patent, which means wherever it would have
existed, no matter where, it would have been

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.930
their property.

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.240
And the existence of Bt in the seed would
have been an infringement of their patent.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.020
They totally lost with their agenda.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.909
And the only way Monsanto has functioned anywhere
in the world, whether it be Brazil or Argentina

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:28.999
or their attempt in India, is illegally.

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:34.629
They are not just trying to shape law when
they don’t get their way.

00:07:34.629 --> 00:07:39.740
They changed the WTO system by saying, “We
are the patient, diagnostician and physician,

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:40.749
all in one.

00:07:40.749 --> 00:07:43.759
We have to prevent farmers from saving seeds.”

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:44.759
That’s what shaped my life.

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:48.580
That’s why for 31 years I’ve been saving
seeds and started Navdanya.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:54.099
And I want to give to you, Amy, our love for
the seed, because when the suicides in the

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:59.710
cotton belt started—’til then I was saving
crop seeds, food crop seeds—I went down

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:02.550
and said, “I’m going to start a cotton
seed bank.”

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:03.689
Took a long time.

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:05.989
We retrieved native cottons.

00:08:05.989 --> 00:08:07.550
We multiplied it.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:09.479
Farmers grow organic cotton.

00:08:09.479 --> 00:08:14.020
In the villages where the farmers are growing
organic cotton, Bt cotton has come down 60

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.020
percent.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:16.370
And then we work with the Gandhi Ashram.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:22.839
It’s 150 years of Gandhi’s birth anniversary,
and nonviolence was his dedication.

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:30.589
This is a nonviolent scarf, handspun, handwoven,
handprinted, with indigo, which was also at

00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:31.589
one time—

00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:32.589
AMY GOODMAN: Indigo.

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:33.589
VANDANA SHIVA: Indigo.

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:34.589
AMY GOODMAN: The dye.

00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:35.589
VANDANA SHIVA: Dye.

00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:37.390
You know, we used to have slave conditions
for growing indigo, and Gandhi led the first

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:41.300
satyagraha, the noncooperation, said, “We
would rather die than grow indigo.”

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.450
And that’s what triggered so much of the
freedom movement.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:47.920
That’s with love to you for democracy, for
all life on Earth.

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:48.920
That’s democracy.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.699
AMY GOODMAN: And this is being made by?

00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:52.160
VANDANA SHIVA: By women.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.660
AMY GOODMAN: In?

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.149
VANDANA SHIVA: In central India.

00:08:56.149 --> 00:08:58.190
The central India is called Vidarbha.

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:05.490
It is the place where Gandhi moved to create
his final ashram, to create a totally democratic

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:06.490
society.

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.430
And for him, democracy began with economic
democracy.

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:11.360
You’ve got to produce what you need.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.490
That’s why he pulled at the spinning wheel.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:16.089
And for me, the seed is today’s spinning
wheel.

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:17.670
AMY GOODMAN: Talk about Bayer.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:23.800
VANDANA SHIVA: Well, Bayer, everyone thinks
they began starting with aspirin.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.519
They began, for Hitler’s Germany, making
Zyklon B, the gas that was used to kill millions

00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:30.930
in the concentration camps.

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:33.170
They were part of IG Farben.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:37.259
IG Farben was the cartel that was tried at
Nuremberg.

00:09:37.259 --> 00:09:39.149
One of Bayer’s inventions is heroin.

00:09:39.149 --> 00:09:40.230
AMY GOODMAN: Heroin.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.310
VANDANA SHIVA: Heroin.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:44.620
And it was called “heroin” because it
made you feel like a hero.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:50.931
I think one future program you could do, Amy,
is how the devastation of our societies, how

00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:56.800
the destruction of the economy of Mexico has
created the drug trade; how the devastation

00:09:56.800 --> 00:10:03.139
of rural America, as well as the unemployment
in the industrial belt, has created the opioid

00:10:03.139 --> 00:10:08.670
crisis; how Punjab, the land of the Green
Revolution, 75 percent youth are now drug

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.670
addicts.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.269
So, Bayer bought out Monsanto.

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:17.220
Bayer bought—so, Monsanto today is Bayer.

00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:19.079
And it’s a German company.

00:10:19.079 --> 00:10:20.129
But these are global companies.

00:10:20.129 --> 00:10:21.129
They have no home.

00:10:21.129 --> 00:10:22.740
They have no loyalty.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.810
They are accountable to no citizens.

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:29.589
All of them work through tax havens.

00:10:29.589 --> 00:10:36.279
You know, if you know—I think it’s—which
is the place in America that’s a tax haven,

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:38.350
where all of the companies are registered?

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.350
Delaware.

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.350
Delaware.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:41.350
All of—including Monsanto.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:47.430
So, Monsanto was bought out by Bayer for the
simple reason that they wanted to erase the

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:51.490
name of Monsanto, which has become such a
dirty name.

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:56.649
But when I did this book, Oneness vs. the
1%, I wanted to really figure out, you know,

00:10:56.649 --> 00:10:58.990
what are the stocks, what are the ownerships.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:11:05.629
That’s when I realized that the majority
stocks in all the corporations that rule our

00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:13.740
world are owned by the investment funds, which
is where the billionaires stock their money.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:20.610
The biggest, BlackRock, the second biggest,
Vanguard, they were nothing 'til the 2008

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.680
Wall Street disaster.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:26.870
Last year, BlackRock was $6 trillion—$6
trillion.

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:34.319
They lost 30 percent with one case, of Monsanto's
Roundup Ready causing cancer.

00:11:34.319 --> 00:11:38.310
It’s a Californian case of Dewayne Johnson.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:39.439
And the jurors ruled that—

00:11:39.439 --> 00:11:41.449
AMY GOODMAN: Roundup Ready is the pesticide.

00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:45.899
VANDANA SHIVA: Roundup is the herbicide that
kills everything, but it has been known by

00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:49.430
the World Health Organization to be a carcinogen.

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.790
Monsanto attacked the World Health Organization,
like they attacked me, like they attack anybody

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:56.430
who speaks the truth and tells good science.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.379
But a Californian jury has ruled.

00:11:59.379 --> 00:12:03.410
And the day the ruling came, Bayer lost 35
percent.

00:12:03.410 --> 00:12:07.100
So, when people feel, “Oh, these guys are
too powerful,” I say, “They’re just

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.100
three.

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.740
We are 300 million species.

00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.070
We are 7 billion people.

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:12.600
We are more.”

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:18.899
And secondly, they are a bubble, that has
exploded with fictions of financial multiplication,

00:12:18.899 --> 00:12:20.870
with rent collections.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.459
Basically, Monsanto and Bayer are nothing
but rent collectors.

00:12:24.459 --> 00:12:29.089
They are the lifelords of today, like feudalism
had the landlords.

00:12:29.089 --> 00:12:30.089
They do no work.

00:12:30.089 --> 00:12:31.089
They do nothing.

00:12:31.089 --> 00:12:32.870
They don’t breed seed.

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.410
They make poison, and then collect rents.

00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:39.279
I think we need a better world in terms of
how we grow our food.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:44.660
AMY GOODMAN: So, chapter two of your book,
“The Money Machine of the 1%,” there you’re

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:48.839
talking about these hedge funds, these large
corporations.

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:55.089
VANDANA SHIVA: I’m talking about the large
corporations, but I’m also talking about

00:12:55.089 --> 00:13:01.529
the mechanisms of the neoliberal economy,
which puts in place ways to make the money

00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:06.089
machine keep growing, at the cost of life
of the people and the planet.

00:13:06.089 --> 00:13:12.741
So, it’s not an accident that we are in
an ecological catastrophe, where IPCC, the

00:13:12.741 --> 00:13:19.860
climate body, as well as the biodiversity
convention panel are saying that we have 10

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.600
years to change.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:27.639
The money machine—I name it the “money
machine” to talk about the new ways in which

00:13:27.639 --> 00:13:31.439
money is being created and accumulated.

00:13:31.439 --> 00:13:33.470
Intellectual property rights and patents is
central.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:36.370
It’s a rent-collecting system.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.810
Not paying taxes is a second.

00:13:38.810 --> 00:13:44.579
Look at Amazon, wanting to come to New York.

00:13:44.579 --> 00:13:45.800
It destroyed India’s systems.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.720
It’s destroyed India’s taxation systems
for its own facility.

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720
And now—

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.720
AMY GOODMAN: How?

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.720
How?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.660
VANDANA SHIVA: Well, they got the government
to create one uniform tax and to all be paid

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.649
on digital, on computers.

00:13:57.649 --> 00:14:02.740
A little corner store in a little town cannot
do it.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.350
They get wiped out overnight.

00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:14.209
And meantime, the reason Bezos became richer
than Bill Gates is because of India.

00:14:14.209 --> 00:14:16.000
And he’s acknowledged it.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.610
AMY GOODMAN: Explain that further.

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:20.199
VANDANA SHIVA: Well, by changing the taxation
systems.

00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:21.810
AMY GOODMAN: How did he change it?

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.949
VANDANA SHIVA: By putting influence on the
government of India, because just like there’s

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:29.259
a federal structure in America, and your taxation
system in Massachusetts is different from

00:14:29.259 --> 00:14:34.411
the taxation system of Oregon, Oregon is different
from the taxation system in New York, they

00:14:34.411 --> 00:14:36.240
made it one uniform GST.

00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.980
Before that, Bill Gates—and I have a story
in there, how Bill Gates and the other IT

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:44.540
industry worked to get cash banned.

00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:46.709
They called it the “war on cash.”

00:14:46.709 --> 00:14:49.779
Now, 90 percent of India’s economy is cash.

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:53.769
Overnight, everyone lost their lifetime savings.

00:14:53.769 --> 00:14:55.350
Everyone was made poor.

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:57.550
Everyone was made vulnerable.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.240
Demonetization is what it was called, and
the GST.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:04.629
These are the two things that are being debated
in our national election lead-up right now.

00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:09.620
Bezos is now working with our dear Bill Gates.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:15.529
They want a 0 percent duty—0 percent duty—on
e-commerce.

00:15:15.529 --> 00:15:18.499
Does it mean that when they ship things, they
don’t ship goods?

00:15:18.499 --> 00:15:23.300
No, they ship goods, but with zero taxation.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.060
The person on the ground in a real local economy
will be paying a tax.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.339
As it is, they have become more expensive.

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:34.380
The real economy has been made artificially
more expensive because of the cheating by

00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:35.380
the money machine.

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.519
AMY GOODMAN: How did Bill Gates come to exert
such power?

00:15:38.519 --> 00:15:44.779
VANDANA SHIVA: Well, as is known and is in
the book, Bill Gates did not invent anything.

00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:50.149
The BASIC program was made by some mathematics
professors in a college.

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:55.579
The Office operating system was by a software
engineer, and he bought it for $50,000.

00:15:55.579 --> 00:16:01.440
He’s built an empire by creating patents
on software.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.740
And the first WTO meeting in Singapore gave
him tax concessions, which is why all the

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.920
IT industry moved to India.

00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:16.089
The fact that Silicon Valley became India
Silicon Valley is because they could save

00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:23.629
$40 billion annually by paying lower wages
for the same work.

00:16:23.629 --> 00:16:27.670
It was an outsourcing of software, all for
Bill Gates.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:34.389
With his accumulation of money and making
any communication system illegal, like the

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:39.770
communication system through real currency
and forcing digital payments, he’s the one

00:16:39.770 --> 00:16:45.089
who gains, because all the software for all
the digital economy, he collects rents and

00:16:45.089 --> 00:16:46.749
royalties on that.

00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:50.410
And then he started to put some of his money
into philanthropy.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:51.410
And everyone thinks, “Wow!

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:52.850
He’s such a generous man.

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:54.420
He gives so much.”

00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:57.070
But I’ve done an analysis in the book.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:00.079
Every place he gives to is his former future
markets.

00:17:00.079 --> 00:17:01.769
I’ll give you a simple example.

00:17:01.769 --> 00:17:08.050
So, the first generation of GMOs, the Bt cotton,
the Roundup Ready soy and Roundup Ready corn,

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:10.640
have started to breed superpests and superweeds.

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:17.459
So now they’re trying to get new GMOs based
on gene editing and gene drives.

00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:25.250
In gene editing, not only is Gates financing
the research, he has created a company for

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:26.250
the patents.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.740
It’s called Editas.

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:32.679
So, he will collect rents when gene editing
is pushed through.

00:17:32.679 --> 00:17:38.429
And worse, in the United States, half the
farmlands are overtaken by superweeds.

00:17:38.429 --> 00:17:41.159
The most important one is Palmer amaranth.

00:17:41.159 --> 00:17:42.409
Amaranth is a sacred crop for us.

00:17:42.409 --> 00:17:43.630
We eat it.

00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:50.770
Now, the U.S. Defense system DARPA and Bill
Gates have joined hands for a new technology

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:54.029
called gene drives to push species to extinction.

00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:56.399
And they want to drive the amaranth to extinction.

00:17:56.399 --> 00:18:00.880
And there’s a footnote in that report saying,
“Oh, yeah, there will be a food insecurity

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.960
impact on India.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:02.960
They eat amaranth.”

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:06.409
No, there will be a food security impact on
the world.

00:18:06.409 --> 00:18:11.350
There is an—this is an acceleration of the
race to extinction.

00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:12.480
It is immoral.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.580
It should be made illegal.

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:19.360
AMY GOODMAN: A recent report by Oxfam India
reveals billionaire fortunes in India increased

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.460
by 35 percent last year as the poorest remained
in debt.

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:27.750
Globally, Oxfam found that billionaires’
wealth increased by 12 percent in the past

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:33.080
year, with the 26 richest people owning the
same amount of money as the world’s poorest

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.490
half, the world’s poorest 50 percent.

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:39.140
Economic inequality hits women and girls the
hardest.

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:44.630
This is Oxfam Executive Director Winnie Byanyima
speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:45.630
last month.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:52.120
WINNIE BYANYIMA: So, last year alone, we saw
billionaire wealth increase by $2.5 billion

00:18:52.120 --> 00:19:00.169
every day, while the wealth of the bottom
half of humanity, 3.8 billion, was dropping

00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:02.320
by $500 million a day.

00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:09.539
… I’m here in Davos to call on governments
to wake up and take up their responsibility

00:19:09.539 --> 00:19:15.919
and tax fairly, tax wealth and put money in
the public services that people need.

00:19:15.919 --> 00:19:18.040
AMY GOODMAN: That’s Oxfam’s executive
director.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.040
Vandana Shiva?

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:23.250
VANDANA SHIVA: Yeah, Winnie’s a dear friend,
and I released the German version of their

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:24.799
report two years ago.

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:31.210
And they’re the ones who followed up the
Occupy movement’s 1 percent naming.

00:19:31.210 --> 00:19:36.919
And they constantly release annually, at the
celebration of party of the 1 percent—right

00:19:36.919 --> 00:19:42.520
now it’s a collapsing party—the Davos
meeting, where they show.

00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:52.490
Now, can you imagine, every day, $2 billion
added to the wealth of the thieves, the stealers,

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.340
the casino players?

00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.429
And not only are they accumulating more wealth,
they’re converting the real lives of people

00:20:00.429 --> 00:20:01.650
into their wealth.

00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:06.340
My work is on seeds, to prevent seeds from
becoming the wealth of these giants.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:11.559
And Bill Gates has a very big role in pushing
GMOs in Africa, through the Alliance for the

00:20:11.559 --> 00:20:16.511
Green Revolution in Africa, pushing patents
on seeds, against the laws, the sovereign

00:20:16.511 --> 00:20:19.880
laws that countries like India have created.

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.960
But they are privatizing water.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:29.130
He is part of geoengineering the extremely
false solution to the climate crisis, the

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.770
melting of glaciers.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:36.390
And I remember in 2009 we did a study on the
third pole, on the Himalayan ecosystems, the

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:37.890
impact on climate change.

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:41.919
And all the pressure was put by the polluters
to say, “Deny that the glaciers are melting.

00:20:41.919 --> 00:20:42.919
Deny.”

00:20:42.919 --> 00:20:49.240
Our government flipped overnight to say, “They’re
not melting; actually, they’re increasing.”

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.390
So these new reports are extremely important.

00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:56.279
And the Himalaya, Himalayan snows don’t
just support the people in the Himalaya; they

00:20:56.279 --> 00:21:01.120
support half of humanity, because all the
rivers for the most densely populated part

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.700
of the world emerge from the Himalaya.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:06.149
And the consequences of this are huge.

00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:10.559
But the most important thing is, those women
in Ladakh, with whom I work, the Women’s

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:18.500
Alliance, they don’t use one drop of oil
or one ounce of gas.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.240
They are totally in a renewable energy economy.

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.240
And they’re being punished.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:27.090
That’s why climate justice is such an important
part of avoiding climate catastrophe.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.590
AMY GOODMAN: So, how does it feel to come
to the United States?

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:34.570
Because what you’re saying, the denial of
the effects of climate change is very Trumpian.

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:40.620
VANDANA SHIVA: Well, sadly, in that case,
it was President Obama, because he flew into

00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:46.049
Singapore to tell the governments, “Stop
pushing for legally binding emissions.”

00:21:46.049 --> 00:21:52.769
He flew into Copenhagen after having received
the Nobel Peace Prize, and called the five

00:21:52.769 --> 00:22:00.110
worst polluters—India, China included now—and
said, “Let’s get rid of the legally binding

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:01.110
convention.”

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.880
And that’s why Paris is merely an agreement.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.179
It’s not the legally binding U.N. Framework
Convention with emissions that were legally

00:22:09.179 --> 00:22:10.630
binding.

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:15.730
And it was in the middle of the negotiations
he announced, “We’ve come to an agreement.”

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:20.850
And that’s when Evo Morales, the president
of Bolivia, got up and said, “We were here

00:22:20.850 --> 00:22:22.830
to fight for the rights of Mother Earth.

00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:26.370
We weren’t here for the rights of polluters.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.100
And all of us are negotiating inside the hall.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.890
Five people get together and say, ’We’ve
come to an agreement to destroy the Earth.’”

00:22:32.890 --> 00:22:37.320
That’s why he worked on the rights of Mother
Earth and called many of us to become the

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:42.530
drafting team for the draft declaration, Universal
Draft Declaration on the Rights of Mother

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:45.000
Earth, which is available for people.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.059
And the work on the movement for the rights
of nature has grown out of that, out of the

00:22:50.059 --> 00:22:51.059
failure of Copenhagen.

00:22:51.059 --> 00:22:53.909
AMY GOODMAN: So you’re talking about 10
years ago, in 2009.

00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:55.500
VANDANA SHIVA: Ten years ago, yes.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:59.360
AMY GOODMAN: When President Obama flew into
Copenhagen at the U.N. climate summit.

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.790
VANDANA SHIVA: Which is the tragedy these
days, that the 1 percent money machine has

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:10.080
become so powerful that it actually controls
the political machine in a very big way.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.890
And we know the elections of the U.S. was
Facebook handing over to Cambridge Analytica

00:23:14.890 --> 00:23:20.279
the “technology” angle, and you got the
first artificial intelligence president based

00:23:20.279 --> 00:23:25.850
on algorithms of hate—hate for women, hate
for blacks, hate for Muslims, hate for migrants.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:30.510
Now, you can’t run democracy on the hate
machine.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:36.890
And you can’t run democracy by the hate
machine being fueled through the divide-and-rule

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:42.700
policy of the 1 percent to destroy our oneness,
our solidarity, our recognition that we are

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:48.980
one humanity and can be strong when we fight
for the rights of the planet and for our basic

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.500
rights to food and water and livelihoods and
justice and democracy.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:58.770
AMY GOODMAN: You are famous for describing
corporate control, challenging corporate control,

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:03.730
but then also coming up with alternative systems,
what you call food democracy.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:04.730
Explain.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:05.730
VANDANA SHIVA: Yeah.

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:10.889
So, we’ve just done a book on biodiversity,
agroecology and regenerative organic agriculture,

00:24:10.889 --> 00:24:17.630
which is 31 years of our practice and research,
because I can’t see thinking separate from

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:18.980
action.

00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:25.540
We find we can feed two times India’s population—two
times India’s population—by conserving

00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:30.330
biodiversity, providing more nutrition per
acre, the more biodiverse the system, and

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:33.409
organic systems produce more nutrition.

00:24:33.409 --> 00:24:39.380
Farmers earn 10 times more by not spending
precious money on chemicals and big machines.

00:24:39.380 --> 00:24:44.450
And the Monsantos and the Bayers of the world
are imagining an agriculture without farmers,

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:49.490
farming without farmers, farming with drones,
farming with spyware in the tractors, farming

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.750
with robots, farming with artificial intelligence.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:56.320
They’re talking about digital agriculture
where you don’t need people.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:01.610
But that means no one to care for the land,
because agriculture means care for the land.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:06.039
We need the Green New Deal, which is such
an amazing discussion in this country.

00:25:06.039 --> 00:25:12.120
And the Green New Deal has to be to put more
people on the land, just like during the Dust

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.280
Bowl in the Depression.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:16.580
Hands healed the Dust Bowl.

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:19.399
We need hands to heal the planet.

00:25:19.399 --> 00:25:23.889
We have solutions to climate change, because
it’s only through taking the excess carbon

00:25:23.889 --> 00:25:29.860
and the excess nitrogen out of the air, can
we heal the broken nitrogen cycle and the

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:31.269
carbon cycle.

00:25:31.269 --> 00:25:34.200
Ecological farming, biodiverse-intensive farming
does that.

00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:42.040
And we only need to add 2 percent, and 10
years we can solve the climate crisis.

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.570
With 0.5 percent organic matter, we can get
rid of the drought.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:49.270
AMY GOODMAN: Explain exactly what you mean,
to the nonfarmer audience.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:55.530
VANDANA SHIVA: So, the basic problem of climate
change is that the planetary boundaries have

00:25:55.530 --> 00:25:56.530
been ruptured.

00:25:56.530 --> 00:26:04.159
There’s a limit of cycling of carbon, of
nitrogen and other minerals and elements.

00:26:04.159 --> 00:26:11.110
By taking fossil fuels out from underground
and burning them at a very high speed, 600

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:15.370
million years of nature’s work—20 million
years being burned every year—we are putting

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.279
too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,
which is why we have climate change.

00:26:19.279 --> 00:26:24.130
We use some of this fossil fuel to then make
nitrogen fertilizers, which emits a nitrous

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.820
oxide, which is 300 times more deadly for
the climate.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:33.929
You get rid of chemicals, you get rid of fossil
fuels, and you start doing organic, all that

00:26:33.929 --> 00:26:38.840
excess carbon can be pulled back by the plants
and put back in the soil, which is why I wrote

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.250
the book Soil Not Oil.

00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:46.890
When you put nitrogen-fixing plants, the pulses—you
know, everyone’s now talking of plant-based

00:26:46.890 --> 00:26:48.830
diets, proteins from plants.

00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:52.840
We did it in India forever with our lovely
dal, our pulses.

00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.720
They fix nitrogen nonviolently.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.860
You don’t have to blast fossil fuels at
high temperature to fix atmospheric nitrogen.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:04.529
The plants have the intelligence to do it,
peacefully, and give us good protein, the

00:27:04.529 --> 00:27:08.789
same way, while fixing the broken nitrogen
cycle, which if you look at the planetary

00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:14.530
boundaries graph, the nitrogen cycle is and
the biodiversity system is the most abused.

00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:19.760
And in every one of these problems, whether
it’s hunger or the chronic disease epidemic

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:24.389
or climate change or species—you know, the
pollinators on our farm are six times more

00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:26.409
than the pollinators on the forest.

00:27:26.409 --> 00:27:34.049
And now, every year, we offer a 1-month course
on the practice of biodiversity, agroecology

00:27:34.049 --> 00:27:36.029
and organic food systems.

00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:41.440
Everywhere, the world is being healed, with
a lot of solidarity, a lot of oneness, between

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:46.400
ourselves and the web of life, and a reclaiming
of that, our intelligence.

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.990
Intelligence will never be artificial.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:49.950
Real intelligence is what makes us live.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:51.880
Life is intelligence.

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.880
Intelligence is democracy.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.950
AMY GOODMAN: Vandana Shiva is an Indian scholar,
environmental activist, food sovereignty and

00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:04.039
seed freedom advocate, and alternative globalization
leader and author.

00:28:04.039 --> 00:28:12.340
She’s written more than 20 books—her latest,
Oneness vs. the 1% and Who Really Feeds the

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:13.340
World?

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.340
This is Democracy Now!

00:28:14.340 --> 00:28:15.340
I’m Amy Goodman.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:16.309
Thanks for joining us.
