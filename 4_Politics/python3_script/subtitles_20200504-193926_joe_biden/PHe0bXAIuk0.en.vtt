00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.110
 

00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.159
How the economic machine works, in 30 minutes.

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:06.680
The economy works like a simple machine.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.390
But many people don't understand it

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.490
— or they don't agree on how it works

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.150
— and this has led to a lot of needless economic suffering.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.249
I feel a deep sense of responsibility

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:22.049
to share my simple but practical economic template.

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:25.320
Though it's unconventional,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.150
it has helped me to anticipate 
and sidestep the global financial crisis,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.460
and has worked well for me for over 30 years.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.260
Let's begin.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.520
Though the economy might seem complex, 
it works in a simple, mechanical way.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.930
It's made up of a few simple parts and a lot of simple transactions

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.260
that are repeated over and over again a zillion times.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.460
These transactions are above all else driven by human nature,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.800
and they create 3 main forces that drive the economy.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.120
Number 1: Productivity growth

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.650
Number 2: The Short term debt cycle

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.400
and Number 3: The Long term debt cycle

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.770
We'll look at these three forces
and how laying them on top of each other

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.530
creates a good template for tracking economic movements

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.590
and figuring out what's happening now.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.830
Let's start with the simplest part of the economy:

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.860
Transactions.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.840
An economy is simply the sum 
of the transactions that make it up

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.570
and a transaction is a very simple thing.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.360
You make transactions all the time.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.760
Every time you buy something 
you create a transaction.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.240
Each transaction consists of a buyer

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.150
exchanging money or credit

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.550
with a seller for goods, 
services or financial assets.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.150
Credit spends just like money,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.280
so adding together the money spent 
and the amount of credit spent,

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.160
you can know the total spending.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.560
The total amount of spending 
drives the economy.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.590
If you divide the amount spent

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.990
by the quantity sold,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.290
you get the price.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.380
And that's it.  That's a transaction.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.110
It is the building block 
of the economic machine.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.019
All cycles and all forces 
in an economy are driven by transactions.

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.469
So, if we can 
understand transactions,

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.569
we can understand 
the whole economy.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.510
A market consists of all the buyers

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.510
and all the sellers

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.910
making transactions for the same thing.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.540
For example, 
there is a wheat market,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.840
a car market,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.640
a stock market

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.550
and markets 
for millions of things.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.470
An economy consists 
of all of the transactions

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:34.670
in all of its markets.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.550
If you add up 
the total spending

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.450
and the total 
quantity sold

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.430
in all of the markets,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.030
you have everything 
you need to know

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.630
to understand the economy.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.960
It's just that simple.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.430
People, businesses, banks and governments

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.730
all engage in transactions 
the way I just described:

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.530
exchanging money and credit 
for goods, services and financial assets.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.500
The biggest buyer and seller 
is the government,

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.040
which consists of two important parts:

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.690
a Central Government 
that collects taxes and spends money...

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.669
...and a Central Bank,

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.269
which is different from other buyers 
and sellers because it

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.989
controls the amount of money 
and credit in the economy.

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.650
It does this by influencing 
interest rates

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.020
and printing new money.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.620
For these reasons, 
as we'll see,

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.200
the Central Bank is an 
important player in the flow

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:28.700
of Credit.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.629
I want you to 
pay attention to credit.

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.659
Credit is the most 
important part of the economy,

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:36.539
and probably the least understood.

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:40.319
It is the most important part 
because it is the biggest

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.100
and most volatile part.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.100
Just like buyers and sellers 
go to the market to make transactions,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.969
so do lenders and borrowers.

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.569
Lenders usually want to 
make their money into more money

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.260
and borrowers usually want to 
buy something they can't afford,

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.059
like a house or car

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:02.319
or they want to invest in 
something like starting a business.

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:04.599
Credit can help both lenders

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:07.799
and borrowers get what they want.

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.560
Borrowers promise to 
repay the amount they borrow,

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:12.719
called the principal,

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:15.419
plus an additional amount, called interest.

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:17.560
When interest rates are high,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.560
there is less borrowing 
because it's expensive.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.540
When interest rates are low,

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.040
borrowing increases 
because it's cheaper.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.930
When borrowers promise to repay

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.959
and lenders believe them,

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:31.059
credit is created.

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:35.170
Any two people can agree 
to create credit out of thin air!

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.210
That seems simple enough 
but credit is tricky

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.499
because it has different names.

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:43.599
As soon as credit is created,

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.029
it immediately turns into debt.

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.670
Debt is both an asset to the lender,

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.770
and a liability to the borrower.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.540
In the future,

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.240
when the borrower repays the loan, 
plus interest,

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.549
the asset and liability disappear

00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:00.949
and the transaction is settled.

00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:04.629
So, why is credit so important?

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:07.619
Because when a borrower receives credit,

00:05:07.619 --> 00:05:09.719
he is able to increase his spending.

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:13.349
And remember, 
spending drives the economy.

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.699
This is because one person's spending

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:17.099
is another person's income.

00:05:17.499 --> 00:05:22.189
Think about it, 
every dollar you spend, someone else earns.

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.279
and every dollar you earn, 
someone else has spent.

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:29.149
So when you spend more, 
someone else earns more.

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:32.649
When someone's income rises

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:34.649
it makes lenders more willing 
to lend him money

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:37.629
because now he's 
more worthy of credit.

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.929
A creditworthy borrower 
has two things:

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:43.519
the ability to repay and collateral.

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:48.319
Having a lot of income in relation to his debt gives him the ability to repay.

00:05:49.079 --> 00:05:55.749
In the event that he can't repay, he has valuable assets to use as collateral that can be sold.

00:05:55.749 --> 00:06:00.340
This makes lenders feel comfortable lending him money.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.960
So increased income allows increased borrowing

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.680
which allows increased spending.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.920
And since one person's spending is another person's income,

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.360
this leads to more increased borrowing and so on.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.350
This self-reinforcing pattern leads to economic growth

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.640
and is why we have Cycles.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.620
In a transaction, you have to give something in order to get something

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.830
and how much you get depends on how much
you produce

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.430
over time we learned

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.680
and that accumulated knowledge raises
are living standards

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.930
we call this productivity growth

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.430
those who were invented and hard-working raise

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.540
their productivity and their living
standards faster

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.950
than those who are complacent and lazy,

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:49.710
but that isn't necessarily true over the short run.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:54.340
Productivity matters most in the long run, but credit matters most in the short run.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.370
This is because productivity growth doesn't fluctuate much,

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:01.480
so it's not a big driver of economic swings.

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.750
Debt is — because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.050
and it forces us to consume less than we produce when we pay it back.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.770
Debt swings occur in two big cycles.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:20.830
One takes about 5 to 8 years and the other takes about 75 to 100 years.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.160
While most people feel the swings, they typically don't see them as cycles

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.490
because they see them too up close -- day by day, week by week.

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.950
In this chapter we are going to step back and look at these three big forces

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.000
and how they interact to make up our experiences.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.340
As mentioned, swings around the line are not due to how much innovation or hard work there is,

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.240
they're primarily due to how much credit there is.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.070
Let's for a second imagine an economy without credit.

00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:53.810
In this economy, the only way I can increase my spending

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:55.480
is to increase my income,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.080
which requires me to be more productive and do more work.

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:03.020
Increased productivity is the only way for growth.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.250
Since my spending is another person's income,

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:10.430
the economy grows every time I or anyone else is more productive.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:13.530
If we follow the transactions and play this out,

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:16.910
we see a progression like the productivity growth line.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:20.780
But because we borrow, we have cycles.

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.900
This isn't due to any laws or regulation,

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.660
it's due to human nature and the way that credit works.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.270
Think of borrowing as simply a way of pulling spending forward.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:37.479
In order to buy something you can't afford, you need to spend more than you make.

00:08:37.479 --> 00:08:41.460
To do this, you essentially need to borrow from your future self.

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:44.610
In doing so you create a time in the future

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:48.690
that you need to spend less than you make in order to pay it back.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.950
It very quickly resembles a cycle.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.400
Basically, anytime you borrow you create a cycle.?

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.950
This is as true for an individual as it is for the economy.

00:08:59.950 --> 00:09:01.850
This is why understanding credit is so important

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:04.590
because it sets into motion

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.790
a mechanical, predictable series of events that will happen in the future.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.570
This makes credit different from money.

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:14.580
Money is what you settle transactions with.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.120
When you buy a beer from a bartender with cash,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.800
the transaction is settled immediately.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.630
But when you buy a beer with credit,

00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:24.730
it's like starting a bar tab.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:27.530
You're saying you promise to pay in the future.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:32.070
Together you and the bartender create an asset and a liability.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.250
You just created credit.  Out of thin air.

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:38.900
It's not until you pay the bar tab later

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.250
that the asset and liability disappear,

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:42.550
the debt goes away

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:44.090
and the transaction is settled.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:50.250
The reality is that most of what people call money is actually credit.

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:55.510
The total amount of credit in the United States is about $50 trillion

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:59.680
and the total amount of money is only about $3 trillion.

00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.040
Remember, in an economy without credit:

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.200
the only way to increase your spending is to produce more.

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.280
But in an economy with credit,

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:10.780
you can also increase your spending by borrowing.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.120
As a result, an economy with credit has more spending

00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:18.090
and allows incomes to rise faster than productivity over the short run,

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:19.890
but not over the long run.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:21.360
Now, don't get me wrong,

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.660
credit isn't necessarily something bad that just causes cycles.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:30.900
It's bad when it finances over-consumption that can't be paid back.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.490
However, it's good when it efficiently allocates resources

00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:37.690
and produces income so you can pay back the debt.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.980
For example, if you borrow money to buy a big TV,

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:43.879
it doesn't generate income 
for you to pay back the debt.

00:10:44.079 --> 00:10:47.880
But, if you borrow money 
to buy a tractor —

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.560
and that tractor let's you harvest 
more crops and earn more money

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.090
— then, you can pay back your debt

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.490
and improve your living standards.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:57.600
In an economy with credit,

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.600
we can follow the transactions

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.300
and see how credit creates growth.

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.680
Let me give you an example:

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:08.190
Suppose you earn $100,000 a year and have no debt.

00:11:08.390 --> 00:11:11.540
You are creditworthy enough to borrow $10,000 dollars

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.040
- say on a credit card

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:15.250
- so you can spend $110,000 dollars

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:18.250
even though you only earn $100,000 dollars.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.460
Since your spending is another person's income,

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.460
someone is earning $110,000 dollars.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:27.670
The person earning $110,000 dollars

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:31.429
with no debt can borrow $11,000 dollars,

00:11:31.429 --> 00:11:34.070
so he can spend $121,000 dollars

00:11:34.070 --> 00:11:38.170
even though he has only earned $110,000 dollars.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.640
His spending is another person's income

00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.430
and by following the transactions

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:45.430
we can begin to see how this process

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:47.430
works in a self-reinforcing pattern.

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:51.600
But remember, borrowing creates cycles

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.809
and if the cycle goes up, it eventually needs to come down.

00:11:56.009 --> 00:11:59.710
This leads us into the Short Term Debt Cycle.

00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:04.380
As economic activity increases, we see an expansion

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.840
- the first phase of the short term debt cycle.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.720
Spending continues to increase and prices start to rise.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.230
This happens because the increase in spending is fueled by credit

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:17.450
- which can be created instantly out of thin air.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:22.680
When the amount of spending and incomes grow faster than the production of goods:

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:23.880
prices rise.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:28.000
When prices rise, we call this inflation.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.500
The Central Bank doesn't want too much inflation

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.010
because it causes problems.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.250
Seeing prices rise, it raises interest rates.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.959
With higher interest rates, fewer people can afford to borrow money.

00:12:42.959 --> 00:12:45.600
And the cost of existing debts rises.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.100
Think about this as the monthly payments 
on your credit card going up.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:54.459
Because people borrow less and have higher debt repayments,

00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:58.720
they have less money leftover to spend, so spending slows

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:02.779
...and since one person's spending is another person's income,

00:13:02.779 --> 00:13:06.589
incomes drop...and so on and so forth.

00:13:06.589 --> 00:13:10.800
When people spend less, prices go down.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.689
We call this deflation.

00:13:12.689 --> 00:13:17.460
Economic activity decreases and we have a recession.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:20.060
If the recession becomes too severe

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.440
and inflation is no longer a problem,

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.060
the central bank will lower interest rates to cause everything to pick up again.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.650
With low interest rates,

00:13:29.650 --> 00:13:30.650
debt repayments are reduced

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.250
and borrowing and spending pick up

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.450
and we see another expansion.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:39.450
As you can see, the economy works like a machine.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:44.160
In the short term debt cycle, 
spending is constrained only by the willingness of

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.140
lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:52.510
When credit is easily available, 
there's an economic expansion.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.090
When credit isn't easily available, 
there's a recession.

00:13:56.090 --> 00:14:00.450
And note that this cycle is controlled primarily by the central bank.

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:05.120
The short term debt cycle typically lasts 5 - 8 years

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.410
and happens over and over again for decades.

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:10.410
But notice that the bottom and

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.400
top of each cycle finish

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.670
with more growth than the previous cycle and with more debt.

00:14:16.670 --> 00:14:18.040
Why?

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.740
Because people push it

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:25.530
— they have an inclination to borrow 
and spend more instead of paying back debt.

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.480
It's human nature.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.380
Because of this,

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.680
over long periods of time,

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.470
debts rise faster than incomes

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:36.670
creating the Long Term Debt Cycle.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:39.670
Despite people becoming more indebted,

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:44.030
lenders even more freely extend credit.

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:45.030
Why?

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:48.670
Because everybody thinks things are going great!

00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:51.970
People are just focusing on what's been happening lately.

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:55.650
And what has been happening lately?

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.650
Incomes have been rising!

00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.250
Asset values are going up!

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.550
The stock market roars!

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:02.480
It's a boom!

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.690
It pays to buy goods, services, and financial assets

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:08.390
with borrowed money!

00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:11.770
When people do a lot of that, we call it a bubble.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.640
So even though debts have been growing,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.110
incomes have been growing nearly as fast to offset them.

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:21.970
Let's call the ratio of debt-to-income the debt burden.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:25.210
So long as incomes continue to rise,

00:15:25.210 --> 00:15:27.040
the debt burden stays manageable.

00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.230
At the same time asset values soar.

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.230
People borrow huge amounts of money

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:35.060
to buy assets as investments

00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:37.660
causing their prices to rise even higher.

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.260
People feel wealthy.

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.260
So even with the accumulation of lots of debt,

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:49.490
rising incomes and asset values 
help borrowers remain creditworthy for a long time.

00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:52.530
But this obviously can not continue forever.

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:54.250
And it doesn't.

00:15:54.250 --> 00:16:00.520
Over decades, debt burdens slowly increase
 creating larger and larger debt repayments.

00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:05.400
At some point, debt repayments start growing faster than incomes

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.240
forcing people to cut back on their spending.

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:12.200
And since one person's spending is another person's income,

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.500
incomes begin to go down...

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:19.020
...which makes people less creditworthy
 causing borrowing to go down.

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.020
Debt repayments continue to rise

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.440
which makes spending drop even further...

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.140
...and the cycle reverses itself.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.960
This is the long term debt peak.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.150
Debt burdens have simply become too big.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:38.830
For the United States, Europe and much of the rest of the world this

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:40.760
happened in 2008.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:45.430
It happened for the same reason it happened in Japan in 1989

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:48.750
and in the United States back in 1929.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:51.980
Now the economy begins Deleveraging.

00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:56.500
In a deleveraging; people cut spending,

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.540
incomes fall, credit disappears,

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.700
assets prices drop, banks get squeezed,

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.340
the stock market crashes, social tensions rise

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:09.709
and the whole thing starts to feed on itself the other way.

00:17:09.709 --> 00:17:13.850
As incomes fall and debt repayments rise,

00:17:13.850 --> 00:17:17.990
borrowers get squeezed. 
No longer creditworthy,

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:22.360
credit dries up and borrowers can no longer borrow 
enough money to make their

00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.600
debt repayments.

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:28.440
Scrambling to fill this hole, borrowers are forced to sell assets.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.550
The rush to sell assets floods the market

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:36.370
This is when the stock market collapses,

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:39.740
the real estate market tanks and banks get into trouble.

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:44.940
As asset prices drop, the value of the collateral borrowers can put up drops.

00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:48.280
This makes borrowers even less creditworthy.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.200
People feel poor.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.010
Credit rapidly disappears. 
Less spending ›

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:55.890
less income ›

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:57.890
less wealth ›

00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:58.590
less credit ›

00:17:58.590 --> 00:18:00.800
less borrowing and so on.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:03.000
It's a vicious cycle.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.530
This appears similar to a recession but the difference here

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:10.160
is that interest rates can't be lowered to save the day.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.590
In a recession, lowering interest rates works to stimulate the borrowing.

00:18:14.590 --> 00:18:18.570
However, in a deleveraging, lowering interest rates doesn't work because

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:20.530
interest rates are already

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:25.310
low and soon hit 0% - so the stimulation ends.

00:18:25.310 --> 00:18:29.210
Interest rates in the United States hit 0% during the deleveraging of

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.840
the 1930s

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.440
and again in 2008.

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.840
The difference between a recession

00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:40.270
and a deleveraging is that in a deleveraging borrowers' debt burdens have

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.930
simply gotten too big

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:45.050
and can't be relieved by lowering interest rates.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:50.240
Lenders realize that debts have become too large to ever be fully paid back.

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.310
Borrowers have lost their ability to repay and their collateral has lost value.

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:59.370
They feel crippled by the debt - they don't even want more!

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.490
Lenders stop lending. 
Borrowers stop borrowing.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.020
Think of the economy as being not-creditworthy,

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:09.000
just like an individual.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.600
So what do you do about a deleveraging?

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.540
The problem is debt burdens are too high and they must come down.

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.790
There are four ways this can happen.

00:19:20.790 --> 00:19:24.489
1. people, businesses, and governments cut their spending.

00:19:24.489 --> 00:19:28.409
2. debts are reduced through defaults and restructurings.

00:19:28.409 --> 00:19:34.139
3. wealth is redistributed from the 'haves' to the 'have nots'.

00:19:34.139 --> 00:19:37.980
and finally, 4. the central bank prints new money.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:42.999
These 4 ways have happened in every deleveraging in modern history.

00:19:45.699 --> 00:19:47.779
Usually, spending is cut first.

00:19:47.879 --> 00:19:52.129
As we just saw, people, businesses, banks and even governments tighten their belts and

00:19:52.129 --> 00:19:54.869
cut their spending so that they can pay down their debt.

00:19:54.869 --> 00:19:58.559
This is often referred to as austerity.

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:01.830
When borrowers stop taking on new debts,

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:06.769
and start paying down old debts, you might expect the debt burden to decrease.

00:20:06.769 --> 00:20:10.720
But the opposite happens!
Because spending is cut

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:14.610
- and one man's spending is another man's income - it causes

00:20:14.610 --> 00:20:19.029
incomes to fall.
They fall faster than debts are repaid

00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:23.210
and the debt burden actually gets worse.
As we've seen,

00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.330
this cut in spending is deflationary and painful.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:29.389
Businesses are forced to cut costs...

00:20:29.389 --> 00:20:32.779
which means less jobs and higher unemployment.

00:20:32.779 --> 00:20:37.139
This leads to the next step: debts must be reduced!

00:20:37.139 --> 00:20:41.149
Many borrowers find themselves unable to repay their loans

00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:44.299
— and a borrower's debts are a lender's assets.

00:20:44.299 --> 00:20:48.749
When borrowers don't repay the bank, 
people get nervous that the bank won't

00:20:48.749 --> 00:20:50.309
be able to repay them

00:20:50.309 --> 00:20:54.909
so they rush to withdraw their money from the bank.
Banks get squeezed and

00:20:54.909 --> 00:20:55.590
people,

00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:00.080
businesses and banks default on their debts.
This severe

00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:03.570
economic contraction is a depression.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:08.649
A big part of a depression is people discovering much of what they thought

00:21:08.649 --> 00:21:11.089
was their wealth isn't really there.

00:21:11.089 --> 00:21:13.490
Let's go back to the bar.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:17.619
When you bought a beer and put it on a bar tab,

00:21:17.619 --> 00:21:23.570
you promised to repay the bartender. 
Your promise became an asset of the bartender.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:28.129
But if you break your promise
 - if you don't pay him back and essentially default

00:21:28.129 --> 00:21:29.309
on your bar tab -

00:21:29.309 --> 00:21:32.649
then the 'asset' he has isn't really worth anything.

00:21:32.649 --> 00:21:35.779
It has basically disappeared.

00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:39.710
Many lenders don't want their assets to disappear and agree to debt

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:40.759
restructuring.

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:44.320
Debt restructuring means lenders get paid back

00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.049
less or get paid back over a longer time frame

00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:52.330
or at a lower interest rate that was first agreed.
Somehow

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:56.889
a contract is broken in a way that reduces debt.
Lenders would rather have a

00:21:56.889 --> 00:21:59.419
little of something than all of nothing.

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:03.450
Even though debt disappears, debt restructuring causes

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:06.559
income and asset values to disappear
faster,

00:22:06.559 --> 00:22:09.679
so the debt burden continues to gets worse.

00:22:09.679 --> 00:22:12.950
Like cutting spending, debt reduction

00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:16.009
is also painful and deflationary.

00:22:16.009 --> 00:22:21.940
All of this impacts the central government because lower incomes and less employment

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:27.049
means the government collects fewer taxes.

00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:30.210
At the same time it needs to increase its spending because unemployment has risen.

00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:33.960
Many of the unemployed have inadequate savings

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.419
and need financial support from the government.

00:22:36.419 --> 00:22:39.999
Additionally, governments create stimulus plans

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:43.879
and increase their spending to make up for the decrease in the economy.

00:22:43.879 --> 00:22:47.509
Governments' budget deficits explode in a

00:22:47.509 --> 00:22:51.059
deleveraging because they spend more than they earn in taxes.

00:22:51.059 --> 00:22:55.720
This is what is happening when you hear about the budget deficit on the news.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:01.320
To fund their deficits, governments need to either raise taxes

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.059
or borrow money. 
But with incomes falling and so many unemployed,

00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:09.789
who is the money going to come from? 
The rich.

00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:14.580
Since governments need more money and since wealth is heavily concentrated in

00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:17.109
the hands of a small percentage of the people,

00:23:17.109 --> 00:23:20.379
governments naturally raise taxes on the wealthy

00:23:20.379 --> 00:23:24.450
which facilitates a redistribution of wealth in the economy -

00:23:24.450 --> 00:23:29.279
from the 'haves' to the 'have nots'. 
The 'have-nots,' who are suffering, begin to

00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:30.970
resent the wealthy 'haves.'

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:36.309
The wealthy 'haves,' being squeezed by the weak economy, falling asset prices,

00:23:36.309 --> 00:23:39.940
higher taxes, begin to resent the 'have nots.'

00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:43.890
If the depression continues social disorder can break out.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:47.280
Not only do tensions rise within countries,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:52.200
they can rise between countries - especially debtor and creditor countries.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.040
This situation can lead to political change

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:58.840
that can sometimes be extreme.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:02.630
In the 1930s, this led to Hitler coming to power,

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:08.080
war in Europe, and depression in the United States. Pressure to do something

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.070
to end the depression increases.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:14.950
Remember, most of what people thought was money was actually credit.

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:18.400
So, when credit disappears, people don't have enough money.

00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:23.190
People are desperate for money and you remember who can print money?

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:27.370
The Central Bank can.

00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.309
Having already lowered its interest rates to nearly 0

00:24:30.309 --> 00:24:34.090
- it's forced to print money. Unlike cutting spending,

00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:37.299
debt reduction, and wealth redistribution,

00:24:37.299 --> 00:24:42.190
printing money is inflationary and stimulative. Inevitably, the central bank

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.210
prints new money

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:47.150
— out of thin air — and uses it to buy financial assets

00:24:47.150 --> 00:24:52.260
and government bonds. It happened in the United States during the Great Depression

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:56.010
and again in 2008, when the United States' central bank —

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.940
the Federal Reserve — printed over two trillion dollars.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:04.179
Other central banks around the world that could, 
printed a lot of money, too.

00:25:04.179 --> 00:25:07.440
By buying financial assets with this money,

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:11.679
it helps drive up asset prices which makes people more creditworthy.

00:25:11.679 --> 00:25:15.820
However, this only helps those who own financial assets.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:21.840
You see, the central bank can print money but it can only buy financial assets.

00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.900
The Central Government, on the other hand,

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:29.580
can buy goods and services and put money in the hands of the people

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.520
but it can't print money. So, in order to stimulate the economy, the two

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.650
must cooperate.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:40.470
By buying government bonds, the Central Bank essentially lends money to the

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:41.190
government,

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:44.909
allowing it to run a deficit and increase spending

00:25:44.909 --> 00:25:48.650
on goods and services through its stimulus programs

00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:53.080
and unemployment benefits. This increases people's income

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.240
as well as the government's debt. However,

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.540
it will lower the economy's total debt burden.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:05.429
This is a very risky time. Policy makers need to balance the four ways that debt

00:26:05.429 --> 00:26:06.590
burdens come down.

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:13.050
The deflationary ways need to balance with the inflationary ways in

00:26:13.050 --> 00:26:14.710
order to maintain stability.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.130
If balanced correctly, there can be a

00:26:18.130 --> 00:26:21.479
Beautiful Deleveraging.

00:26:21.479 --> 00:26:25.359
You see, a deleveraging can be ugly or it can be beautiful.

00:26:25.359 --> 00:26:28.839
How can a deleveraging be beautiful?

00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:33.429
Even though a deleveraging is a difficult situation,

00:26:33.429 --> 00:26:37.549
handling a difficult situation in the best possible way is beautiful.

00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:42.210
A lot more beautiful than the debt-fueled, unbalanced excesses of the

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:45.940
leveraging phase. 
In a beautiful deleveraging,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:51.089
debts decline relative to income, real economic growth is positive,

00:26:51.089 --> 00:26:56.889
and inflation isn't a problem. 
It is achieved by having the right balance.

00:26:56.889 --> 00:27:00.159
The right balance requires a certain mix

00:27:00.159 --> 00:27:04.229
of cutting spending, reducing debt, transferring wealth

00:27:04.229 --> 00:27:09.149
and printing money so that economic and social stability can be maintained.

00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:13.639
People ask if printing money will raise inflation.

00:27:13.639 --> 00:27:18.879
It won't if it offsets falling credit. 
Remember, spending is what matters.

00:27:18.879 --> 00:27:24.249
A dollar of spending paid for with money has the same effect on price as a dollar

00:27:24.249 --> 00:27:25.969
of spending paid for with credit.

00:27:25.969 --> 00:27:31.299
By printing money, the Central Bank can make up for the disappearance of credit

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:33.080
with an increase in the amount of money.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:38.509
In order to turn things around, the Central Bank needs to not only pump up

00:27:38.509 --> 00:27:39.519
income growth

00:27:39.519 --> 00:27:43.849
but get the rate of income growth higher than the rate of interest on the

00:27:43.849 --> 00:27:45.099
accumulated debt.

00:27:45.099 --> 00:27:48.379
So, what do I mean by that? Basically,

00:27:48.379 --> 00:27:52.309
income needs to grow faster than debt grows. For example:

00:27:52.309 --> 00:27:56.080
let's assume that a country going through a deleveraging has a debt-to-

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:58.580
income ratio of 100%.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:03.659
That means that the amount of debt it has is the same as the amount of income the

00:28:03.659 --> 00:28:05.799
entire country makes in a year.

00:28:05.799 --> 00:28:09.009
Now think about the interest rate on that debt,

00:28:09.009 --> 00:28:11.159
let's say it is 2%.

00:28:11.159 --> 00:28:15.029
If debt is growing at 2% because of that interest rate and

00:28:15.029 --> 00:28:15.690
income

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:20.230
is only growing at around only 1%, you will never reduce the debt burden.

00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:24.809
You need to print enough money to get the rate of income growth above the

00:28:24.809 --> 00:28:25.950
rate of interest.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:30.720
However, printing money can easily be abused because it's so easy to do and

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.049
people prefer it to the alternatives.

00:28:33.049 --> 00:28:36.200
The key is to avoid printing too much money

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:41.110
and causing unacceptably high inflation, the way Germany did during its

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.129
deleveraging in the 1920's.

00:28:43.129 --> 00:28:48.269
If policymakers achieve the right balance, a deleveraging isn't so dramatic.

00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:51.340
Growth is slow but debt burdens go down.

00:28:51.340 --> 00:28:54.470
That's a beautiful deleveraging.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:59.830
When incomes begin to rise, borrowers begin to appear more creditworthy.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:02.999
And when borrowers appear more creditworthy,

00:29:02.999 --> 00:29:08.509
lenders begin to lend money again. 
Debt burdens finally begin to fall.

00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:13.499
Able to borrow money, people can spend more. Eventually, the economy begins to

00:29:13.499 --> 00:29:14.399
grow again,

00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:18.009
leading to the reflation phase of the long term debt cycle.

00:29:18.009 --> 00:29:22.490
Though the deleveraging process can be horrible if handled badly,

00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:26.279
if handled well, it will eventually fix the problem.

00:29:26.279 --> 00:29:29.580
It takes roughly a decade or more

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.669
for debt burdens to fall and economic activity to get back to normal

00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:37.899
- hence the term 'lost decade.'

00:29:37.899 --> 00:29:42.720
Of course, the economy is a little more complicated than this template

00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.639
suggests.

00:29:43.639 --> 00:29:48.850
However, laying the short term debt cycle on top of the long term debt cycle

00:29:48.850 --> 00:29:52.629
and then laying both of them on top of the productivity growth line

00:29:52.629 --> 00:29:55.919
gives a reasonably good template for seeing where we've been,

00:29:55.919 --> 00:29:58.919
where we are now and where we are probably headed.

00:29:58.919 --> 00:30:03.019
So in summary, there are three rules of thumb that I'd like you to take away

00:30:03.019 --> 00:30:03.720
from this:

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:08.220
First: 
Don't have debt rise faster than income,

00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:11.429
because your debt burdens will eventually crush you.

00:30:11.429 --> 00:30:16.059
Second: 
Don't have income rise faster than productivity,

00:30:16.059 --> 00:30:19.159
because you will eventually become uncompetitive.

00:30:19.159 --> 00:30:24.000
And third: 
Do all that you can to raise your productivity,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.029
because, in the long run, that's what matters most.

00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:34.080
This is simple advice for you and it's simple advice for policy makers.

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:38.470
You might be surprised but most people — including most policy makers — don't pay enough attention

00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:39.509
to this.

00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:44.059
This template has worked for me and I hope that it'll work for you.

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:46.380
Thank you.
