00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.120
Amazon is a very
sophisticated tax player.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.480
Amazon is very much the
canary in the coal mine.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.500
They're really doing what a lot
of politicians wish more companies would do.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.590
Amazon is a huge company, but you
know just how huge it really is.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.570
We start with amazing Amazon somewhere
CEO Jeff Bezos is smiling.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.250
It's one of only two U.S.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.040
companies to ever reach
a trillion dollar valuation.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.760
No one in history has
become as rich as quickly.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.940
It's made Jeff Bezos the
richest man in the world.

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.300
That is one hundred
million prime subscribers globally.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.770
And if you put those prime subscribers in
one country, it would be the 14th

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.000
largest on the planet.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:44.290
The planet.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.050
But that massive company paid no federal
income tax on more than 11 billion

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.910
in profits in 2018.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.550
And somehow they actually got a
$129 million tax rebate.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.890
So how do they do it?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.500
First, there is the tax bill.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.150
President Trump's signature tax legislation
lowered the corporate tax rate

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.040
from 35 to 21 percent.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.820
Corporations are literally going
wild over this.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.420
That immediately slashed Amazon's
potential tax burden.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.450
Then there's Amazon savvy
use of revenue.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.670
Amazon plows large portions of revenue
back into itself to cultivate long term growth.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.050
Amazon has actually been selfs
funding for several years now.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.890
The company challenged significant
free cash flow.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.760
One of the things I like about Amazon
is it's a company that doesn't really

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.570
kind of rest on their laurels
and is constantly trying to innovate,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.810
constantly trying to heed the
needs of the customer.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.820
This started early on with Bezos using
the strategy to get big fast helping

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.640
Amazon eclipse its once arch
rival, Barnes &amp; Noble.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.780
Since then, it's helped Amazon gobble
up countless other retail markets as

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.890
well, embark on lucrative ventures like
Amazon Web Services, and even

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.150
become a Hollywood studio with
shows like "The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel" and "Jack Ryan."

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.220
Amazon has invested so much revenue
in itself over the years that

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.200
sometimes it didn't even
make a profit.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.700
And when that happened, it could carry
forward losses to write off on future tax bills.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.770
In 2018, those carryforward losses eligible
for federal write off amounted

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.440
to $627 million.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.850
Then there's massive federal tax credits,
which the company reports are

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.750
primarily related to research and
development from its A.I

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.770
assisted logistics network to its
suite of consumer electronics products

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.640
Amazon has poured tens of billions
of dollars into research and

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.080
development over the years.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.770
But that's not the only
tax credit Amazon qualifies for.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:05.160
The big one last year was the
expensing that is allowed for investments in

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.060
plants and equipment and buildings
and things of that sort.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.770
Trump's Tax Cuts and Jobs Act supercharged
this credit, a perk that Amazon

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:14.670
has cashed in on.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.010
The idea behind the expanded credit.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.420
The big problem the U.S.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.370
economy is that it has not been
as productive recently as in the past.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.050
And so one solution which would help
sort of companies everywhere is if

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.030
they invested more in machinery and
training to make their workers more productive.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.430
But not everybody buys
into this reasoning.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.680
The tax breaks Amazon is getting, they're
being rewarded for what they were going to do anyway.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.780
Because when you're a company as
successful, as profitable, as cash rich

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.330
as Amazon is, you make investments when you
have the money to do them and

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.730
when you see the
need for those investments.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.150
In 2018, Amazon had about one point
four billion dollars in total available tax credits.

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.900
Finally, there's the company's use
of stock based employee compensation.

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.670
Basically, this allows Amazon to pay
employees using stock and then take

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.070
the value of that stock
off their tax bill.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.160
Amazon rewards its employees, especially
its executives, with stock based

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.370
compensation, and Amazon stock has
been rising fairly substantially for many years.

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.710
And so the size of that stock
based compensation is now very large and

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.900
affords Amazon a large write off.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.160
Some say the federal government ends up making
just as much in the long run

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.970
from stock based compensation because the
stock is taxed when it's sold.

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.750
But others have concerns because of
the major difference between the value

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.500
of the stock when it's offered to
employees versus the value when it's written off.

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.840
They give executives the right to purchase
a certain number of shares of

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.640
stock at a set price.

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.100
The price of the stock goes way up.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.790
The company is then allowed to write
off the value of that stock and

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.130
suddenly the tax breaks can be huge.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.590
Amazon deducted about one point one
billion dollars from its tax liability

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.570
using this method in 2018.

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.190
So that's how Amazon secures such
a small federal income tax bill.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.730
But before we get ahead of
ourselves, we should probably remember that

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:28.340
Amazon does pay certain taxes like
state taxes, local taxes, other federal

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.500
taxes and international taxes.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.290
In a statement to CNBC, an Amazon
spokesperson said, Amazon pays all the

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.050
taxes we are required to
pay in the U.S.

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.460
and every country where we operate,
including paying 2.6 billion

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.660
in corporate tax and reporting 3.4 billion in tax expense

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.310
over the last three years.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.690
The company also touted its investments
and job creation in the U.S.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.950
But according to data compiled by
the Institute on Taxation and Economic

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:02.990
Policy, Amazon had an effective federal tax
rate of just 3 percent over 10

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.700
years. That's far below the once 35
percent corporate income tax rate in

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.030
the United States and even the
new 21 percent rate now.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:15.020
And Amazon's story is
not exactly unique.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:19.580
Another disruptor Netflix and even a
more traditional auto company General

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:25.700
Motors both report expected net federal
income tax benefits in their 2018 annual filings.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.140
When we asked Netflix about it, the
company highlighted the 131 million it

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.380
paid in taxes total but wouldn't
break out its federal bill.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.390
It all seems to be part of a
larger trend over the past 70 years, we've

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.930
seen a decline in corporate income tax
revenue as a share of the larger

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.040
economy and in the last decade.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.810
Companies as diverse as Southwest and Goldman
Sachs, just to name a few,

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.380
have all had at least a year where
they reported net tax benefits in their

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.150
S.E.C. filings, but could lowering
America's corporate tax rate actually

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.580
make it more competitive for
companies to do business here?

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:07.180
I think what a lot of economists would
say is that the corporate tax is a very bad tax.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.200
One you have sort of a
global economy where economic activity is

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:13.930
everywhere. You have other countries
cutting their tax rates.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.910
You want to sort of incentivize economic
activity to be in your country.

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:20.480
What do you want
these companies to do?

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.680
You want them to
invest in new machinery.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:25.300
Want them to invest in their workers.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.120
You want them to have more profits,
which then they can use to invest

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:30.250
more. That's what you
want corporations to do.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.690
You don't want corporations necessarily be
paying lots of taxes that's not

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.590
what they're there for.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:40.930
Others say it deprives the country of
much needed tax revenue without a lot of benefit.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:46.960
We may yet succeed in this experiment
of lowering our effective tax rates

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:51.190
and our statutory tax rates to
draw more business to the US.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:57.340
But so far, we're not seeing the type
of level of growth in business and

00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:03.300
investment that would make up for the
lost revenue when we lowered our tax rates from 35 to 21.

00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.960
So yeah, it's an issue
because we need the money.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.270
As of 2017, the U.S.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.170
has corporate tax revenue as a share
of the larger economy was lower than

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:19.510
most other peer nations ranking below
Italy, South Korea and Mexico.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.400
We're in a lot of trouble.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:26.230
We're facing one trillion dollar deficits as
far as the eye can see.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.770
Ultimately, this means everyone else has
to pick up the slack.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:35.320
That two billion dollars Amazon is not
paying will have to get paid by

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:39.430
smaller businesses that don't have the
wherewithal to lobby for tax

00:08:39.430 --> 00:08:43.030
breaks. It'll get paid by middle income
families in the form of higher

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.020
taxes in some way.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.280
The reality is this is how
business has been done for years.

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.570
Corporations with savvy lobbyists on their
payroll have found ways to

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.710
convince politicians in both parties to
leave loopholes in the tax code.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:03.820
So I'm a tax lawyer and I drafted
tax rules for Congress for six years.

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.440
Multinationals have a very strong
presence on the Hill.

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:11.610
When I was there, we would meet
every week with companies and their

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:15.940
lobbyists. And I think
the interest is disproportionate.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:21.370
I mean, every American, including every
American company, has a right to

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.520
petition Congress and to share
their concerns with Congress.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:31.150
The trouble is, sometimes of those with
the most resources have the loudest voice.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.860
But business as usual may be changing
as average Americans have begun to

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:39.010
wonder whether this bargain
really benefits them.

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:45.180
It's a question that came front and
center during Amazon's hunt for a second headquarters.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:46.760
Amazon has made it official.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.730
The online giant announced it's splitting
its new headquarters into two locations

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.720
Crystal City in Northern Virginia and
Long Island City in Queens.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:57.870
The company courted massive interest
from hundreds of cities.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.400
Amazon today saying they are bringing at
least 25,000 jobs with an average

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.890
salary of $150,000.

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:08.580
New York's governor, a mayor, saying
the $3 billion dollars in tax

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:15.990
incentives they gave Amazon for an expected 27.5 billion in tax revenue would pay off big for New Yorkers.

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:26.550
That is the highest rate of return for an economic incentive program that this state has ever offered.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:31.860
This certainly consolidates New York City
as a great international tech hub.

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:37.360
Despite positive polling on the deal, a groundswell of New Yorkers vehemently disagreeing.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.300
Whose city? Our City!
Whose City? Our City!

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.100
We want to make sure that they know
that this community is going to stand

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.660
up and fight against this deal.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.640
Any politician in this progressive city and
a state who's willing to hand

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.100
out three billion dollars to Amazon, there
should be a career ender right there. Period.

00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:00.090
And soon it all came crashing down.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:03.540
Breaking news, Amazon canceling
its controversial plans

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.360
Now it will not build
a headquarters in New York

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:11.970
The world's biggest company just got sent packing thanks to an unfriendly welcome by New Yorkers

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:15.540
Has the populist victory in the
HQ to fight change the game?

00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:21.750
I mean, it shows that everyday Americans
can have more say in this country

00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.070
than the richest man in the world.

00:11:23.310 --> 00:11:26.820
Will it ignite a grassroots movement
demanding that loopholes be tightened

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.150
and the effective tax rate be raised all
the way up to the federal level?

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:35.640
We should not have a regressive
tax system in which large profitable

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.050
corporations like Amazon pay nothing
in federal income taxes.

00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.910
Or is it just a flash in the pan?

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:46.860
As even President Trump, a frequent critic
of Amazon, came to the deal's defense?

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.630
Well, I think it's a
loss for New York City.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.100
And the $3 billion
dollars wasn't a check.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.010
It was a form of taxes over a
period of time that now they'll never see.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:57.630
Only time will tell.

00:11:57.870 --> 00:12:01.980
But one thing is for sure, it's
quite normal for some corporations to pay

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.960
no income tax to the federal government.
