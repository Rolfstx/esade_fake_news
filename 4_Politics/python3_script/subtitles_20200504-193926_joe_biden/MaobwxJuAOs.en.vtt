00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
That's it. We're happy with that, thank you very much

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.740
Okay, standing by.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.100
Hello, young man.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.700
1, 2, 3, 4. 6, 7, 8. 9-7, that's what the score should have been.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.020
My mum was a bit, "footballer?" You know?

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.320
My dad was, who never missed a match, went to all the matching at Middlesborough, was a huge Borough supporter

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.980
was absolutely thrilled, "that's the young man whose been scoring all the goals."

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.220
We dictators like to talk a lot.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.240
Complex

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:32.440
We all like to be liked

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.900
A purist

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.080
Play it in the green grass, not in the air

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.220
Get in there, that's what I pay you for

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.040
A lover of the simple things

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.760
One thing you haven't got in football is time

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.980
And at times his own reflection

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.600
Ali: Clough, I've had enough. Stop it

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.480
Clough tells it all

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.920
Mid-70's, late-70's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.700
He turned the average into the extraordinary

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.440
He captured that decade

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.020
The portrayal of Brian Clough in that book -- But the truth -- is absolutely outrageous

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.500
--isn't always black and white

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.440
I would like the supreme job

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.320
It's a bit cold isn't it?
