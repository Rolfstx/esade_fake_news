Thank you.

(cheering and applause)

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.266
Thank you.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.033
I think Congress needs
one of those horns.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.400
(laughter)

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.100
That sounds pretty good.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.333
Sounds like Louis
Armstrong back there.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.333
(laughter)

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:48.533
Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:53.233
It is a great honor
for me to be in Accra,

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:58.467
and to speak to the
representatives of the people of Ghana.

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:01.600
(cheering and applause)

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.400
I am deeply grateful for the
welcome that I've received,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.200
as are Michelle and
Malia, and Sasha Obama.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.734
Ghana's history is rich, the
ties between our two countries

00:01:13.734 --> 00:01:18.200
are strong, and I am proud
that this is my first visit to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.000
sub-Saharan Africa as President
of the United States of America.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.834
(cheering and applause)

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:31.667
I want to thank Madam Speaker 
and all the members of the

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:34.867
House of Representatives
for hosting us today.

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:39.667
I want to thank President Mills 
for his outstanding leadership.

00:01:39.667 --> 00:01:44.200
To the former Presidents --
Jerry Rawlings,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.066
former President Kufuor; 
Vice President; Chief Justice;

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:54.433
thanks to all of you for your 
extraordinary hospitality and

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:58.867
the wonderful institutions 
that you've built here in Ghana.

00:01:58.867 --> 00:02:03.734
Now, I'm speaking to you
at the end of a long trip.

00:02:03.734 --> 00:02:08.533
I began in Russia, for a Summit
between two great powers.

00:02:08.533 --> 00:02:13.533
I traveled to Italy, for a
meeting of the world's leading economies.

00:02:13.533 --> 00:02:17.567
And I've come here, to
Ghana, for a simple reason:

00:02:17.567 --> 00:02:22.900
the 21st century will be shaped by 
what happens not just in Rome

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.633
or Moscow or Washington, but by
what happens in Accra as well.

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:39.700
(cheering and applause)

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.133
This is the simple truth of a
time when the boundaries between

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:50.400
people are overwhelmed
by our connections.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.567
Your prosperity can expand
America's prosperity.

00:02:55.567 --> 00:03:00.467
Your health and security can
contribute to the world's health

00:03:00.467 --> 00:03:02.333
and security.

00:03:02.333 --> 00:03:06.300
And the strength of your
democracy can help advance human

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.133
rights for people everywhere.

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:13.100
So I do not see the countries
and peoples of Africa as a world

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.667
apart; I see Africa as a
fundamental part of our

00:03:17.667 --> 00:03:22.233
interconnected world -- 
as partners with America on behalf

00:03:22.233 --> 00:03:26.934
of the future we want
for all of our children.

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:28.934
That partnership must
be grounded in mutual

00:03:28.934 --> 00:03:33.033
responsibility and
mutual respect,

00:03:33.033 --> 00:03:37.900
and that is what I want to
speak with you about today.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:44.600
We must start from the simple
premise that Africa's future is

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.100
up to Africans.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.500
I say this knowing full well the
tragic past that has sometimes

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.233
haunted this part of the world.

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:57.967
After all, I have the blood
of Africa within me --

00:03:57.967 --> 00:04:01.500
(cheering and applause)

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.867
-- and my family's own story
encompasses both the tragedies

00:04:04.867 --> 00:04:09.633
and triumphs of the
larger African story.

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:12.500
Some of you know, my grandfather
was a cook for the British in

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.734
Kenya, and though he was a
respected elder in his village,

00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:21.900
his employers called him
"boy" for much of his life.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.900
He was on the periphery of
Kenya's liberation struggles,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.400
but he was still imprisoned
briefly during repressive times.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.400
In his life, colonialism wasn't
simply the creation of unnatural

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.700
borders or unfair
terms of trade --

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.133
it was something experienced
personally, day after day,

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:42.000
year after year.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.667
My father grew up herding
goats in a tiny village,

00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:49.800
an impossible distance away from
the American universities where

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.133
he would come to
get an education.

00:04:53.133 --> 00:04:58.533
He came of age at a moment
of extraordinary promise for Africa.

00:04:58.533 --> 00:05:00.867
The struggles of his own
father's generation were giving

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:04.967
birth to new nations,
beginning right here in Ghana.

00:05:04.967 --> 00:05:10.233
(cheering and applause)

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:13.900
Africans were educating and
asserting themselves in new ways

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.333
and history was on the move.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:22.300
But despite the progress
that has been made --

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:29.300
and there has been considerable
progress in many parts of Africa

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:35.066
-- we also know that much of 
that promise has yet to be fulfilled.

00:05:35.066 --> 00:05:40.266
Countries like Kenya had a
per capita economy larger than

00:05:40.266 --> 00:05:44.300
South Korea's when I was born.

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.133
They have badly been outpaced.

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:53.600
Disease and conflict have
ravaged parts of the African continent.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.567
In many places, the hope of my
father's generation gave way to

00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:02.533
cynicism, even despair.

00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:06.300
Now, it's easy to point fingers,
and to pin the blame of these

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.500
problems on others.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.667
Yes, a colonial map that made
little sense helped to breed

00:06:13.667 --> 00:06:20.400
conflict; the West has often
approached Africa as a patron

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:27.066
or a source of resources,
rather than a partner.

00:06:27.066 --> 00:06:29.400
But the West is not responsible
for the destruction of the

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.600
Zimbabwean economy
over the last decade,

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:41.367
or wars in which children
are enlisted as combatants.

00:06:41.367 --> 00:06:44.767
In my father's life, it was
partly tribalism and patronage

00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:51.000
and nepotism in an independent
Kenya that for a long stretch,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.633
derailed his career, and we know
that this kind of corruption is

00:06:56.633 --> 00:07:01.567
still a daily fact of
life for far too many.

00:07:01.567 --> 00:07:05.500
Now, we know that's
also not the whole story.

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:10.233
Here in Ghana, you show us a
face of Africa that is too often

00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:16.066
overlooked by a world that
sees only tragedy or a need for charity.

00:07:16.066 --> 00:07:20.033
The people of Ghana have worked
hard to put democracy on a

00:07:20.033 --> 00:07:25.100
firmer footing, with repeated
peaceful transfers of power even

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.000
in the wake of closely
contested elections.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:35.800
(cheering and applause)

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:40.800
And by the way, can I say that for that, 
the minority deserves

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.967
as much credit as the majority.

00:07:42.967 --> 00:07:50.700
(cheering and applause)

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:54.734
And with improved governance
and an emerging civil society,

00:07:54.734 --> 00:07:58.767
Ghana's economy has shown
impressive rates of growth.

00:07:58.767 --> 00:08:01.000
(cheering)

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.033
This progress may lack the drama
of 20th century liberation

00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:11.033
struggles, but make no mistake:
it will ultimately be more significant.

00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:16.333
For just as it is important to
emerge from the control of other

00:08:16.333 --> 00:08:23.700
nations, it is even more
important to build one's own nation.

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:27.567
So I believe that this moment is
just as promising for Ghana --

00:08:27.567 --> 00:08:30.600
and for Africa -- as the moment when 
my father came of age and

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.567
new nations were being born.

00:08:33.567 --> 00:08:37.533
This is a new moment
of great promise.

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:40.700
Only this time, we've learned
that it will not be giants like

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:44.667
Nkrumah and Kenyatta who will
determine Africa's future.

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:48.633
Instead, it will be you --
the men and women in Ghana's

00:08:48.633 --> 00:08:52.400
Parliament, the
people you represent.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.533
It will be the young people -- 
brimming with talent and energy

00:08:55.533 --> 00:09:01.200
and hope -- who can claim the 
future that so many in previous

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.533
generations never realized.

00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:08.967
Now, to realize that promise,
we must first recognize a

00:09:08.967 --> 00:09:13.734
fundamental truth that you
have given life to in Ghana:

00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:19.834
development depends
on good governance.

00:09:19.834 --> 00:09:22.300
(cheering)

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.934
That is the ingredient which has
been missing in far too many

00:09:24.934 --> 00:09:27.500
places, for far too long.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:31.233
That's the change that can
unlock Africa's potential.

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:36.867
And that is a responsibility
that can only be met by Africans.

00:09:36.867 --> 00:09:41.900
As for America and the West, our
commitment must be measured by

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.166
more than just the
dollars we spend.

00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:48.266
I've pledged substantial
increases in our foreign

00:09:48.266 --> 00:09:53.934
assistance, which is in
Africa's interest and America's interests.

00:09:53.934 --> 00:09:58.767
But the true sign of success is
not whether we are a source of

00:09:58.767 --> 00:10:02.633
perpetual aid that helps
people scrape by --

00:10:02.633 --> 00:10:05.500
it's whether we are partners
in building the capacity for

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:07.100
transformational change.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:15.467
(cheering and applause)

00:10:15.467 --> 00:10:20.233
This mutual responsibility
must be the foundation of our partnership.

00:10:20.233 --> 00:10:23.767
And today, I will focus on four
areas that are critical to the

00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:29.233
future of Africa and the entire
developing world: democracy;

00:10:29.233 --> 00:10:36.100
opportunity; health; and the
peaceful resolution of conflict.

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:42.266
First, we must support strong
and sustainable democratic governments.

00:10:42.266 --> 00:10:45.433
(cheering and applause)

00:10:45.433 --> 00:10:49.767
As I said in Cairo, each nation
gives life to democracy in its

00:10:49.767 --> 00:10:54.467
own way, and in line
with its own traditions.

00:10:54.467 --> 00:10:57.567
But history offers
a clear verdict:

00:10:57.567 --> 00:11:01.433
governments that respect the 
will of their own people that

00:11:01.433 --> 00:11:07.934
govern by consent and 
not coercion are more prosperous,

00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:14.667
they are more stable, and more 
successful than governments that do not.

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:16.700
This is about more than
just holding elections --

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.700
it's also about what
happens between elections.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.867
(cheering)

00:11:21.867 --> 00:11:24.033
You know, repression
can take many forms,

00:11:24.033 --> 00:11:29.100
and too many nations -- 
even those that have elections --

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.033
are plagued by problems that 
condemn their people to poverty.

00:11:33.033 --> 00:11:35.867
Now, no country is going to 
create wealth if its leaders

00:11:35.867 --> 00:11:39.100
exploit the economy to
enrich themselves --

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:44.700
(cheering and applause)

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:50.900
-- or if police can be bought 
off by drug traffickers.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:55.300
No business wants to invest in a
place where the government skims

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.433
20% off the top --

00:11:57.433 --> 00:11:59.033
(cheering and applause)

00:11:59.033 --> 00:12:02.667
-- or the head of the
Port Authority is corrupt.

00:12:02.667 --> 00:12:06.266
No person wants to live in a
society where the rule of law

00:12:06.266 --> 00:12:10.333
gives way to the rule of
brutality and bribery.

00:12:10.333 --> 00:12:12.600
(cheering)

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.767
That is not democracy,
that is tyranny,

00:12:15.767 --> 00:12:20.066
even if occasionally you
sprinkle an election in there.

00:12:20.066 --> 00:12:25.967
And now is the time for that 
style of governance to end.

00:12:25.967 --> 00:12:30.867
In the 21st century, capable,
reliable and transparent

00:12:30.867 --> 00:12:34.033
institutions are the
key to success --

00:12:34.033 --> 00:12:39.400
strong parliaments, honest
police forces, independent judges --

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.767
(cheering)

00:12:40.767 --> 00:12:45.567
-- an independent press; 
a vibrant private sector, a civil

00:12:45.567 --> 00:12:53.000
society; those are the things 
that give life to democracy,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.367
because that is what matters
in peoples' everyday lives.

00:12:58.367 --> 00:13:02.333
Now, time and again, 
Ghanaians have chosen Constitutional rule

00:13:02.333 --> 00:13:07.066
over autocracy, and shown a
democratic spirit that allows

00:13:07.066 --> 00:13:10.266
the energy of your
people to break through.

00:13:10.266 --> 00:13:12.767
(cheering)

00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:17.533
We see that in leaders who
accept defeat graciously --

00:13:17.533 --> 00:13:21.433
the fact that President Mills' 
opponents were standing beside

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:25.100
him last night to greet me
when I came off the plane spoke

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:26.967
volumes about Ghana.

00:13:26.967 --> 00:13:31.533
(applause)

00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:34.600
Victors who resist calls
to wield power against the

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.500
opposition in unfair ways.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.467
We see that spirit in
courageous journalists like

00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:52.033
Anas Aremeyaw Anas, 
who risked his life to report the truth.

00:13:52.033 --> 00:13:55.533
We see it in police
like Patience Quaye,

00:13:55.533 --> 00:14:00.600
who helped prosecute the first
human trafficker in Ghana.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:04.500
We see it in the young people
who are speaking up against

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:07.734
patronage, and participating
in the political process.

00:14:07.734 --> 00:14:11.133
Across Africa, we've seen
countless examples of people

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:14.734
taking control of their destiny,
and making change from the

00:14:14.734 --> 00:14:16.667
bottom up.

00:14:16.667 --> 00:14:19.734
We saw it in Kenya, where civil
society and business came

00:14:19.734 --> 00:14:23.367
together to help stop
post-election violence.

00:14:23.367 --> 00:14:27.033
We saw it in South Africa, where
over three quarters of the

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.934
country voted in the
recent election --

00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:32.200
the fourth since the
end of Apartheid.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.233
We saw it in Zimbabwe, where the
Election Support Network braved

00:14:36.233 --> 00:14:39.867
brutal repression to stand
up for the principle that a

00:14:39.867 --> 00:14:43.900
person's vote is
their sacred right.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:47.333
Now, make no mistake: history
is on the side of these brave

00:14:47.333 --> 00:14:52.600
Africans; not with those who use 
coups or change Constitutions to

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.767
stay in power.

00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:58.000
(cheering and applause)

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Africa doesn't need strongmen,
it needs strong institutions.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.967
(cheering)

00:15:08.967 --> 00:15:13.967
Now, America will not seek to
impose any system of government

00:15:13.967 --> 00:15:16.367
on any other nation.

00:15:16.367 --> 00:15:21.433
The essential truth of democracy 
is that each nation determines

00:15:21.433 --> 00:15:25.133
its own destiny.

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:29.000
But what America will do,
is increase assistance for

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.300
responsible individuals and 
responsible institutions with a

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.767
focus on supporting
good governance --

00:15:35.767 --> 00:15:38.533
on parliaments,
which check abuses of power and ensure that

00:15:38.533 --> 00:15:43.033
opposition voices are
heard; on the rule of law,

00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:46.533
which ensures the equal administration of justice;

00:15:46.533 --> 00:15:50.100
on civic participation, so
that young people get involved;

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:53.700
and on concrete solutions
to corruption like forensic

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:56.300
accounting and
automating services,

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:00.166
strengthening hotlines, 
protecting whistle-blowers to

00:16:00.166 --> 00:16:03.433
advance transparency
and accountability.

00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:07.734
And we provide this support, I
have directed my Administration

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:12.233
to give greater attention to
corruption in our Human Rights reports.

00:16:12.233 --> 00:16:14.400
People everywhere should have
the right to start a business or

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.967
get an education
without paying a bribe.

00:16:16.967 --> 00:16:18.333
(cheering)

00:16:18.333 --> 00:16:20.900
We have a responsibility
to support those who act

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.233
responsibly and to
isolate those who don't,

00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:28.000
and that is exactly
what America will do.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.100
Now, this leads directly to our
second area of partnership --

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:36.700
supporting development that
provides opportunity for more people.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.533
With better governance, I have
no doubt that Africa holds the

00:16:39.533 --> 00:16:43.200
promise of a broader
base of prosperity.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:47.500
Witness the extraordinary success 
of Africans in my

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.200
country, American.

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.133
They're doing very well.

00:16:53.133 --> 00:16:55.166
So they've got the talent, 
they've got the entrepreneurial

00:16:55.166 --> 00:16:58.934
spirit; the question is, how
do we make sure that they're

00:16:58.934 --> 00:17:02.934
succeeding here in
their home countries?

00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:06.233
The continent is rich
in natural resources.

00:17:06.233 --> 00:17:08.967
And from cell phone
entrepreneurs to small farmers,

00:17:08.967 --> 00:17:12.200
Africans have shown the capacity
and commitment to create their

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.800
own opportunities.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.867
But old habits must
also be broken.

00:17:17.867 --> 00:17:22.567
Dependence on commodities
-- or a single export --

00:17:22.567 --> 00:17:26.200
has a tendency to concentrate
wealth in the hands of the few,

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.800
and leaves people too
vulnerable to downturns.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.633
So in Ghana, for instance, oil
brings great opportunities,

00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:38.533
and you have been very
responsible in preparing for new revenue.

00:17:38.533 --> 00:17:45.000
But as so many Ghanaians know,
oil cannot simply become the new cocoa.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.633
From South Korea to Singapore,
history shows that countries

00:17:48.633 --> 00:17:51.633
thrive when they invest in
their people and in their

00:17:51.633 --> 00:17:54.133
infrastructure; when --

00:17:54.133 --> 00:18:00.633
(cheering and applause)

00:18:00.633 --> 00:18:04.333
-- when they promote
multiple export industries,

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:08.166
develop a skilled workforce,
and create space for small and

00:18:08.166 --> 00:18:11.633
medium-sized businesses
that create jobs.

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:13.967
As Africans reach
for this promise,

00:18:13.967 --> 00:18:19.133
America will be more responsible
in extending our hand.

00:18:19.133 --> 00:18:21.734
By cutting costs that go
to Western consultants and

00:18:21.734 --> 00:18:25.266
administration, we want to put
more resources in the hands of

00:18:25.266 --> 00:18:28.900
those who need it, while
training people to do more for themselves.

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:32.133
(applause)

00:18:32.133 --> 00:18:37.200
That's why our $3.5 billion food
security initiative is focused

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.433
on new methods and
technologies for farmers --

00:18:40.433 --> 00:18:45.300
not simply sending American
producers or goods to Africa.

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.767
Now, aid is not
an end in itself.

00:18:48.767 --> 00:18:52.133
The purpose of foreign
assistance must be creating the

00:18:52.133 --> 00:18:55.467
conditions where it's
no longer needed.

00:18:55.467 --> 00:18:59.367
I want to see Ghanaians not
only self-sufficient in food,

00:18:59.367 --> 00:19:03.333
I want to see you exporting food to 
other countries and earning money.

00:19:03.333 --> 00:19:04.333
You can do that.

00:19:04.333 --> 00:19:07.800
(applause)

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.033
Now, America can also do more
to promote trade and investment.

00:19:12.033 --> 00:19:15.967
Wealthy nations must open our
doors to goods and services from

00:19:15.967 --> 00:19:18.900
Africa in a meaningful way.

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:22.166
That will be a commitment
of my administration.

00:19:22.166 --> 00:19:23.834
And where there is
good governance,

00:19:23.834 --> 00:19:25.900
we can broaden prosperity
through public-private

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:29.033
partnerships that invest in
better roads and electricity;

00:19:29.033 --> 00:19:32.567
capacity-building that trains
people to grow a business;

00:19:32.567 --> 00:19:35.800
financial services that
reach not just the cities,

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.867
but also the poor
and rural areas.

00:19:39.867 --> 00:19:42.767
This is also in our
own interests --

00:19:42.767 --> 00:19:45.200
for if people are lifted out of
poverty and wealth is created in

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.500
Africa, guess what?

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.100
New markets will open
up for our own goods.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.333
So it's good for both.

00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:59.300
Now, one area that holds out
both undeniable peril and

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.767
extraordinary promise is energy.

00:20:02.767 --> 00:20:05.934
Africa gives off less greenhouse
gas than any other part of the

00:20:05.934 --> 00:20:10.900
world, but it is the most
threatened by climate change.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:15.734
A warming planet will spread
disease, shrink water resources,

00:20:15.734 --> 00:20:18.867
and deplete crops, creating
conditions that produce more

00:20:18.867 --> 00:20:22.033
famine and more conflict.

00:20:22.033 --> 00:20:24.834
All of us -- particularly
the developed world --

00:20:24.834 --> 00:20:27.900
have a responsibility
to slow these trends --

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:32.500
through mitigation, and by
changing the way that we use energy.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.800
But we can also work with
Africans to turn this crisis

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.967
into opportunity.

00:20:36.967 --> 00:20:39.367
Together, we can partner on
behalf of our planet and on

00:20:39.367 --> 00:20:43.767
prosperity, and help countries
increase access to power while

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:49.133
skipping -- leapfrogging -- the
dirtier phase of development.

00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:51.767
Think about it: Across Africa,
there is bountiful wind and

00:20:51.767 --> 00:20:57.233
solar power; geothermal
energy and bio-fuels.

00:20:57.233 --> 00:20:59.567
From the Rift Valley to
the North African deserts;

00:20:59.567 --> 00:21:03.266
from the Western coasts to
South Africa's crops --

00:21:03.266 --> 00:21:07.533
Africa's boundless natural gifts
can generate its own power,

00:21:07.533 --> 00:21:12.467
while exporting profitable,
clean energy abroad.

00:21:12.467 --> 00:21:16.533
These steps are about more than
growth numbers on a balance sheet.

00:21:16.533 --> 00:21:19.934
They're about whether a young
person with an education can get

00:21:19.934 --> 00:21:24.133
a job that supports a family; a
farmer can transfer their goods

00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:29.066
to market; an entrepreneur
with a good idea can start a business.

00:21:29.066 --> 00:21:31.500
It's about the dignity of work.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:36.033
It's about the opportunity that
must exist for Africans in the

00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:39.166
21st century.

00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:41.767
Now, just as governance
is vital to opportunity,

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:44.967
it's also critical to the third
area I want to talk about --

00:21:44.967 --> 00:21:47.800
strengthening public health.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.934
In recent years, enormous
progress has been made in parts

00:21:50.934 --> 00:21:52.600
of Africa.

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.834
Far more people are living
productively with HIV/AIDS,

00:21:55.834 --> 00:21:58.000
and getting the drugs they need.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.133
I just saw a wonderful clinic 
and hospital that is focused

00:22:03.133 --> 00:22:06.834
particularly on maternal health.

00:22:06.834 --> 00:22:10.633
But too many still die from
diseases that shouldn't kill them.

00:22:10.633 --> 00:22:14.500
When children are being killed
because of a mosquito bite,

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:17.834
and mothers are
dying in childbirth,

00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:22.633
then we know that more
progress must be made.

00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:27.600
Yet because of incentives
often provided by donor nations,

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.200
many African doctors
and nurses go overseas,

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.367
or work for programs that
focus on a single disease.

00:22:35.367 --> 00:22:40.467
And this create gaps in primary
care and basic prevention.

00:22:40.467 --> 00:22:43.266
Meanwhile, individual Africans
also have to make responsible

00:22:43.266 --> 00:22:45.767
choices that prevent
the spread of disease,

00:22:45.767 --> 00:22:50.133
while promoting public health in
their communities and countries.

00:22:50.133 --> 00:22:52.600
So Across Africa, 
we see examples of people tackling

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.567
these problems.

00:22:54.567 --> 00:22:58.000
In Nigeria, an Interfaith effort
of Christians and Muslims has

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.400
set an example of cooperation
to confront malaria.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.100
Here in Ghana and across Africa,
we see innovative ideas for

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.533
filling gaps in
care -- for instance,

00:23:09.533 --> 00:23:12.567
through E-Health initiatives that 
allow doctors in big cities

00:23:12.567 --> 00:23:16.433
to support those in small towns.

00:23:16.433 --> 00:23:21.100
America will support these
efforts through a comprehensive,

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.767
global health strategy.

00:23:22.767 --> 00:23:26.300
Because in the 21st century,
we are called to act by our

00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.533
conscience, but also
by our common interest.

00:23:29.533 --> 00:23:33.333
Because when a child dies of a
preventable disease in Accra,

00:23:33.333 --> 00:23:36.133
that diminishes us everywhere.

00:23:36.133 --> 00:23:40.066
And when disease goes unchecked
in any corner of the world,

00:23:40.066 --> 00:23:44.033
we know that it can spread
across oceans and continents.

00:23:44.033 --> 00:23:48.667
And that's why my Administration
has committed $63 billion to

00:23:48.667 --> 00:23:51.233
meet these challenges.

00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:52.834
$63 billion.

00:23:52.834 --> 00:23:55.433
(applause)

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:58.567
Building on the strong
efforts of President Bush,

00:23:58.567 --> 00:24:02.333
we will carry forward the
fight against HIV/AIDS.

00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:05.800
We will pursue the goal of
ending deaths from malaria and

00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:09.467
tuberculosis, and we will
work to eradicate polio.

00:24:09.467 --> 00:24:13.166
(applause)

00:24:13.166 --> 00:24:17.767
We will fight neglected
tropical disease.

00:24:17.767 --> 00:24:20.533
And we won't confront
illnesses in isolation --

00:24:20.533 --> 00:24:24.367
we will invest in public health
systems that promote wellness,

00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:28.100
and focus on the health
of mothers and children.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:33.433
(applause)

00:24:33.433 --> 00:24:37.567
Now, as we partner on behalf
of a healthier future,

00:24:37.567 --> 00:24:41.300
we must also stop the
destruction that comes not from

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:45.000
illness, but from
human beings --

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.834
and so the final area that
I will address is conflict.

00:24:49.834 --> 00:24:53.967
Let me be clear: Africa is
not the crude caricature of a

00:24:53.967 --> 00:24:57.934
continent at perpetual war.

00:24:57.934 --> 00:25:02.266
But, if we are honest,
for far too many Africans,

00:25:02.266 --> 00:25:08.333
conflict is a part of life,
as constant as the sun.

00:25:08.333 --> 00:25:13.200
There are wars over land
and wars over resources.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.467
And it's still far too easy for
those without conscience to

00:25:16.467 --> 00:25:22.166
manipulate whole communities
into fighting among faiths and tribes.

00:25:22.166 --> 00:25:27.200
These conflicts are a millstone
around Africa's neck.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.834
Now, we all have
many identities --

00:25:28.834 --> 00:25:32.567
of tribe and ethnicity; of
religion and nationality.

00:25:32.567 --> 00:25:35.000
But defining oneself in
opposition to someone who

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.233
belongs to a different tribe,
or who worships a different

00:25:38.233 --> 00:25:42.967
prophet, has no place
in the 21st century.

00:25:42.967 --> 00:25:49.000
(cheering and applause)

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.100
Africa's diversity should
be a source of strength,

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.467
not a cause for division.

00:25:53.467 --> 00:25:55.367
We are all God's children.

00:25:55.367 --> 00:25:58.333
We all share common
aspirations --

00:25:58.333 --> 00:26:01.600
to live in peace and security;
to access education and

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:04.500
opportunity; to love our
families, and our communities,

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.734
and our faith.

00:26:05.734 --> 00:26:08.367
That is our common humanity.

00:26:08.367 --> 00:26:13.667
That is why we must stand up
to inhumanity in our midst.

00:26:13.667 --> 00:26:18.433
It is never justified -- 
never justifiable to target innocents

00:26:18.433 --> 00:26:21.667
in the name of ideology.

00:26:21.667 --> 00:26:26.867
It is the death sentence of a
society to force children to

00:26:26.867 --> 00:26:28.967
kill in wars.

00:26:28.967 --> 00:26:31.700
It is the ultimate mark of
criminality and cowardice to

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:36.667
condemn women to relentless
and systematic rape.

00:26:36.667 --> 00:26:40.867
We must bear witness to the
value of every child in Darfur

00:26:40.867 --> 00:26:44.600
and the dignity of every
woman in the Congo.

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:51.367
No faith or culture should
condone the outrages against them.

00:26:51.367 --> 00:26:54.066
And all of us must strive for
the peace and security necessary

00:26:54.066 --> 00:26:57.133
for progress.

00:26:57.133 --> 00:27:00.300
Africans are standing
up for this future.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:07.633
Here, too, in Ghana we are
seeing you help point the way forward.

00:27:07.633 --> 00:27:10.033
Ghanaians should take pride
in your contributions to

00:27:10.033 --> 00:27:13.667
peacekeeping from Congo
to Liberia to Lebanon --

00:27:13.667 --> 00:27:17.433
(applause)

00:27:17.433 --> 00:27:21.500
-- and your efforts to resist
the scourge of the drug trade.

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.700
(cheering and applause)

00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:29.200
We welcome the steps that are
being taken by organizations

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.233
like the African Union and
ECOWAS to better resolve

00:27:32.233 --> 00:27:37.433
conflicts to keep the peace,
and support those in need.

00:27:37.433 --> 00:27:40.000
And we encourage the
vision of a strong,

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.100
regional security architecture
that can bring effective,

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:47.433
transnational forces
to bear when needed.

00:27:47.433 --> 00:27:50.734
America has a responsibility
to work with you as a partner to

00:27:50.734 --> 00:27:53.367
advance this vision,
not just with words,

00:27:53.367 --> 00:27:58.100
but with support that 
strengthens African capacity.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.467
When there's a genocide in 
Darfur or terrorists in Somalia,

00:28:01.467 --> 00:28:03.367
these are not simply
African problems --

00:28:03.367 --> 00:28:05.567
they are global
security challenges,

00:28:05.567 --> 00:28:07.967
and they demand a
global response.

00:28:07.967 --> 00:28:10.867
And that's why we stand ready
to partner through diplomacy

00:28:10.867 --> 00:28:13.467
and technical assistance,
and logistical support,

00:28:13.467 --> 00:28:18.967
and we will stand behind
efforts to hold war criminals accountable.

00:28:18.967 --> 00:28:23.433
And let me be clear: our Africa
Command is focused not on

00:28:23.433 --> 00:28:26.100
establishing a foothold
in the continent,

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.133
but on confronting these common
challenges to advance the

00:28:29.133 --> 00:28:33.266
security of America,
Africa and the world.

00:28:33.266 --> 00:28:37.467
(cheering and applause)

00:28:37.467 --> 00:28:41.333
In Moscow, I spoke of the need
for an international system

00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:44.433
where the universal rights of
human beings are respected,

00:28:44.433 --> 00:28:47.834
and violations of those
rights are opposed.

00:28:47.834 --> 00:28:50.667
And that must include a 
commitment to support those who

00:28:50.667 --> 00:28:54.767
resolve conflicts peacefully,
to sanction and stop those who

00:28:54.767 --> 00:28:59.734
don't, and to help
those who have suffered.

00:28:59.734 --> 00:29:02.900
But ultimately, it will be
vibrant democracies like

00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:07.433
Botswana and Ghana which roll
back the causes of conflict,

00:29:07.433 --> 00:29:13.433
and advance the frontiers
of peace and prosperity.

00:29:13.433 --> 00:29:17.734
As I said earlier, Africa's
future is up to Africans.

00:29:17.734 --> 00:29:21.700
The people of Africa are
ready to claim that future.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:25.900
And in my country,
African-Americans --

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.333
including so many
recent immigrants --

00:29:29.333 --> 00:29:33.166
have thrived in every
sector of society.

00:29:33.166 --> 00:29:36.433
We've done so despite
a difficult past,

00:29:36.433 --> 00:29:40.867
and we've drawn strength
from our African heritage.

00:29:40.867 --> 00:29:43.033
With strong institutions
and a strong will,

00:29:43.033 --> 00:29:47.133
I know that Africans can live
their dreams in Nairobi and

00:29:47.133 --> 00:29:52.200
Lagos; Kigali and Kinshasa;
Harare and right here in Accra.

00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:59.633
(cheering and applause)

00:29:59.633 --> 00:30:06.867
You know, 52 years ago, the
eyes of the world were on Ghana.

00:30:06.867 --> 00:30:10.200
And a young preacher named
Martin Luther King traveled

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:15.767
here, to Accra, to watch the
Union Jack come down and the

00:30:15.767 --> 00:30:18.500
Ghanaian flag go up.

00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.400
This was before the march on
Washington or the success of the

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.767
civil rights movement
in my country.

00:30:25.767 --> 00:30:29.834
And Dr. King was asked 
how he felt while watching the birth of

00:30:29.834 --> 00:30:32.200
a nation.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:36.900
And he said: "It renews my
conviction in the ultimate

00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:40.800
triumph of justice."

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:45.166
Now, that triumph
must be won once more,

00:30:45.166 --> 00:30:47.500
and it must be won by you.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:53.233
(cheering and applause)

00:30:53.233 --> 00:30:58.767
And I am particularly speaking
to the young people all across

00:30:58.767 --> 00:31:02.667
Africa and right here in Ghana.

00:31:02.667 --> 00:31:07.433
In places like Ghana, 
young people make up over half of the population.

00:31:07.433 --> 00:31:12.900
And here is what you must know: 
the world will be what you make of it.

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:15.800
You have the power to hold
your leaders accountable,

00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:19.400
and to build institutions
that serve the people.

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:20.967
You can serve in
your communities,

00:31:20.967 --> 00:31:24.300
and harness your energy and
education to create new wealth

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:26.934
and build new
connections to the world.

00:31:26.934 --> 00:31:29.900
You can conquer disease,
and end conflicts,

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.467
and make change
from the bottom up.

00:31:32.467 --> 00:31:34.200
You can do that.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.667
Yes you can.

00:31:35.667 --> 00:31:36.734
(cheering)

00:31:36.734 --> 00:31:40.934
Because in this moment,
history is on the move.

00:31:40.934 --> 00:31:44.000
But these things can only
be done if all of you take

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
responsibility for your future.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.166
And it won't be easy.

00:31:48.166 --> 00:31:50.834
It will take time and effort.

00:31:50.834 --> 00:31:52.433
There will be
suffering and setbacks.

00:31:52.433 --> 00:31:56.133
But I can promise you this:
America will be with you every

00:31:56.133 --> 00:31:57.433
step of a way.

00:31:57.433 --> 00:31:58.667
As a partner.

00:31:58.667 --> 00:31:59.800
As a friend.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.533
(cheering and applause)

00:32:04.533 --> 00:32:08.400
Opportunity won't come from
any other place, though --

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.100
it must come from the decisions
that all of you make,

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:19.233
the things that you do, the hope
that you hold in your heart.

00:32:19.233 --> 00:32:22.300
Ghana, freedom is
your inheritance.

00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:26.934
Now, it is your responsibility
to build upon freedom's foundation.

00:32:26.934 --> 00:32:29.767
And if you do, we will look back
years from now to places like

00:32:29.767 --> 00:32:34.600
Accra and say, this was the time
when the promise was realized --

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.433
this was the moment when
prosperity was forged;

00:32:37.433 --> 00:32:41.967
when pain was overcome; and
a new era of progress began.

00:32:41.967 --> 00:32:48.100
This can be the time when we
witness the triumph of justice once more.

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.166
Yes we can.

00:32:49.166 --> 00:32:50.166
Thank you very much.

00:32:50.166 --> 00:32:51.333
God bless you.

00:32:51.333 --> 00:32:52.333
Thank you.

00:32:52.333 --> 00:32:55.100
(cheering and applause)
