00:00:31.965 --> 00:00:32.766 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I WILL.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:37.404
I LOVE THE WAY YOU EXPLAIN
WORDS, HOW YOU TELL THE STORY OF

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:39.172 size:88% position:44%
HOW WE TELL STORIES.

00:00:39.172 --> 00:00:40.540 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S MY JOB.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.745
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO, WHAT IS-- WHAT
IS LEXICOGRAPHY?

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.248 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT'S THE IMPORTANCE OF
LINGUISTICS?

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.050 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT
LINGUISTICS IS WE UNDERSTAND

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.184
THAT LANGUAGE ALWAYS CHANGES.

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.753 size:88% position:56%
AND THE REASON WE UNDERSTAND
THAT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE IT

00:00:53.753 --> 00:00:54.487 align:start size:88% position:13%
ALWAYS CHANGES.

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:55.989
BECAUSE IN ITSELF, WHO CARES?

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.690
THE CLOUDS ARE ALWAYS CHANGING.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.161
BUT WE HAVE THIS LAST REMAINING
PREJUDICE THAT WE CAN EXPRESS

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:05.999
OPENLY WITH NO SCIENCE
URWHATSOEVER, WHICH IS WE HAVE

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:08.034
THIS IDEA TWO OUT OF THREE
PEOPLE ARE USING THE LANGUAGE

00:01:08.034 --> 00:01:12.138 align:end position:100%
WRONG IN SOME SCIENTIFICALLY
PROVABLE WAY, AND IT JUST ISN'T

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:14.240
TRUE, BUT IT CAN BE REALLY HARD
TO SEE THAT.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.041
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:18.611
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF LINGUISTICS IS TO
TEACH US THAT NO, LANGUAGE COULD

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:20.113
NOT BE CHANGING ALL THE TIME.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:23.616
THERE COULD NEVER BE A LANGUAGE
THAT DIDN'T EXIST IN DIFFERENT

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:23.817 align:start size:88% position:13%
FORMS.

00:01:23.817 --> 00:01:26.886
AND THE ONLY REASON WE THINK OF
ONE KIND AS THE GOOD KIND OR THE

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.923
RIGHT KIND IS BECAUSE IT LAND TO
WIND UP IN THE SHOP WINDOW FOR

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.725
SOME CHANCE REASON-- GENERALLY
HUNDREDS OF YEARS AGO.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:36.429
SO THAT'S A LOT OF WHAT
LINGUISTICS IS GOOD FOR IN THE

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.629 align:start size:88% position:13%
WORLD.

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:40.500
BECAUSE MY LINGUIST EAR LISTENS
TO ANYBODY TALKING, NO MATTER

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.038 align:start size:88% position:13%
WHAT DIALECT, NO MATTER HOW
VULGAR, NO MATTER HOW

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:49.042 size:88% position:56%
INEBRIATED, AND I THINK GOOD
LORD, THAT IS SO NUANCED AND

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:49.309 align:start size:88% position:13%
COMPLEX.

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:52.145
AND LINGUISTS WANT EVERYBODY TO
HEAR ALL LANGUAGE THAT WAY.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:54.447
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS THERE AN OLDEST
WORD IN ENGLISH?

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.716
IS THERE A WORD THAT HAS CHANGED
THE LEAST IN ENGLISH?

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:59.452 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; SO A SINGLE WORD THAT HAS
CHANGED THE LEAST.

00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:04.157 align:end position:100%
THERE'S NOT ANY ONE WORD NAY
WOULD THINK OF, BUT IT TENDS TO

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:08.828
BE THE MOST HEAVILY USED AND,
THEREFORE, DULLEST WORDS.

00:02:08.828 --> 00:02:11.331 size:84% position:42%
FOR EXAMPLE, "AND."

00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:17.103
I HAVE NOTHING REMOTELY
INTERESTING I COULD SAY ABOUT

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:17.303 align:start size:88% position:13%
"AND."

00:02:17.303 --> 00:02:21.908
AND "I," IT GOES BACK AND SOUNDS
DIFFERENT, BUT IT'S SAIMENT

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:22.108 align:start size:88% position:13%
THING.

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:23.510 align:start size:88% position:13%
FAMILY MEMBERS.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.680
THINK ABOUT WHAT "BROTHER" HAS
COME TO MEAN IN ACTUAL ENGLISH,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.250 size:88% position:56%
WITH ALL THE BRO, ET CETERA.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.985 size:88% position:56%
NOBODY WOULD HAVE RECOGNIZED
THAT ON THE STECHTZ UKRAINE.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:33.820 size:88% position:56%
YOU DO HAVE THINGS CHANGING.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:38.458 size:88% position:56%
FATHER, MOTHER-- THOSE BASIC
MEANT-AND-POTATOES, LIFE IN

00:02:38.458 --> 00:02:42.362
THEM, DIE IN THEM WORDS TEND TO
STAY THE SAME, BUT THAT'S REALLY

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:44.430
ONLY A FEW HUNDRED WORDS.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.033 align:start size:88% position:13%
MOST WORDS ARE IN A STATE OF
FLUX.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.134 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT'S CHANGING
NOW?

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:49.536 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; LIKE RIGHT NOW?

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:51.938 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IN OUR LANGUAGE,
WHAT'S CHANGING NOW?

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.873
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN FEEL IT HAPPENING IN
REAL TIME.

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.308 size:78% position:39%
IT'S FASCINATING.

00:02:55.308 --> 00:03:00.713
THERE'S SOMETHING STEPHEN PINKER
HAS CALLED THE EUPHEMISM

00:03:00.713 --> 00:03:00.980 align:start size:88% position:13%
TREADMILL.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.216
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN YOU COULD
NAME A SCHOOL-- YOU KNOW "SCHOOL

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:05.785 size:88% position:56%
FOR CRIPPLES," AND YOU COULD
HAVE THAT CAST IN STONE, AND

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:06.753 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT WAS OKAY.

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:10.823 size:88% position:56%
NOW, AFTER A WHILE, NEGATIVE
ASSOCIATIONS, UNFORTUNATELY,

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:14.694
ACCRETE ON TO CRIPPLES AND SO
YOU CHANGE IT TO "HANDICAPPED."

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:19.499 align:end position:100%
THAT WORD GETS A LITTLE OLD, AND
YOU CHANGE IT TO "DISABLED,"

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.937
AND,000 NOOSE CONSIDERED --
THAT'S CALLED THE EUPHEMISM

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:26.272
TREADMILL, WHERE NEGATIVE
ASSOCIATIONS, WHETHER WE LIKE IT

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:29.242
EAR NOT, SETTLE ON A WORD AND
YOU HAVE TO COME UP WITH A NEW

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:29.409 align:start size:88% position:13%
ONE.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.345
THE ONE HAPPENING NOW-- I'M A
STODGY PERSON WHO TENDS TO LIKE

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:35.315
OLD THINGS AND DOESN'T WANT
THINGS TO CHANGE SOY ALWAYS

00:03:35.315 --> 00:03:38.318
LEARN ABOUT SLANG TERMS ABOUT 20
MINUTES TOO LATE.

00:03:38.318 --> 00:03:39.586 size:88% position:44%
FOR EXAMPLE, "WOKE."

00:03:39.586 --> 00:03:41.921
I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHEN I
LEARNED THAT TERM.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:45.425
BUT WHEN I LEARNED IT, IT WAS
STILL JUST THE COOLEST THING.

00:03:45.425 --> 00:03:49.796
"YOU ARE WOKE TO THE
COMPLEXITIES OF SOCIETY AND HOW

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:50.496
INJUSTICE REALLY HAPPENS."

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:52.065 align:start size:88% position:13%
IT WAS COOL.

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:56.502
IT SMELLED LIKE, ROUGHLY,
MARIJUANA AND LAF DER.

00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.504
IT WAS THAT KIND OF WORD.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:00.373
<i>( LAUGHTER )
AND ABOUT TWO SECONDS LATER, A</i>

00:04:00.373 --> 00:04:05.678
CERTAIN KIND OF PERSON STARTED
SNEERG, "OH, IS THAT PERSON

00:04:05.678 --> 00:04:08.715
WOKE?"
IT'S AT THE POINT WHERE "WOKE"

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:13.486
IN QUOTATION MARKS IS THE WORD
"PERKY."

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:15.922
YOU CAN'T SAY SOMEBODY IS PERKY.

00:04:15.922 --> 00:04:20.226
IT HASN'T BEEN A REAL WORD SINCE
"BYE-BYE BIRDIE."

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:21.561
NOW WOKE IS THE SAME THING.

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:25.765
IT'S A WORD PEOPLE ON CERTAIN
SIDES OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM

00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:27.000 size:75% position:38%
THROW AT PEOPLE.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.570
YOUR VIEWS ARE THE ONES THAT YOU
THINK COME FROM ON HIGH.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.340
THAT IS HAPPENING ROUGHLY AT A
CERTAIN TIME A PERSON BECAME

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.109
EXPRT ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE
THAT.

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.977
I FOUND IT FASCINATING.

00:04:37.977 --> 00:04:41.714
WOKE WILL BE ALL BUT UNUSABLE IN
10 YEARS.

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:43.616
&gt;&gt; Stephen: TWO POINTS.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.051 size:88% position:56%
ONE, KELLY RIPA, VERY PERKY.

00:04:45.051 --> 00:04:46.185 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; KELLY RIPA.

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:47.387 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NO, SHE'S PERKY.

00:04:47.387 --> 00:04:50.423
AND THE OTHER IS HOW HAS THIS
MAN, HOW HAS DONALD TRUMP

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.491
CHANGED OUR LANGUAGE?

00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:56.696
BECAUSE I THINK MORE PEOPLE READ
HIM ON A DAILY BASIS RIGHT NOW

00:04:56.696 --> 00:04:59.132
THAN PROBABLY ARE READING THE
GOSPELS.

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.301
BECAUSE HE'S TWEETING TO
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE

00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:02.302
RESPONDING TO WHAT HE SAYS.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:04.070
&gt;&gt; THAT'S LITERATURE.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:06.072 align:start size:88% position:13%

&gt;&gt; WHAT HAS HE DONE!

00:05:19.686 --> 00:05:22.755

00:05:24.223 --> 00:05:27.427

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.234 align:start size:88% position:13%
KEEP HIM AWAY.

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:37.804
BUT, NO, IT'S VERY INTERESTING
WITH HIM.

00:05:37.804 --> 00:05:40.673
HE DOES LET IT ALL HANG OUT WITH
THE LANGUAGE.

00:05:40.673 --> 00:05:41.074 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: TRUE.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:44.844
&gt;&gt; , AND REALLY, WE'VE ALL KNOWN
PEOPLE WHO WROTE LIKE THAT, WHO

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:45.445 size:78% position:39%
TALKED LIKE THAT.

00:05:45.445 --> 00:05:49.449 size:88% position:56%
I MEAN, THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO
WERE DEFINED, DESPITE ALL OF

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.953
THEIR DIVERSITY, AS NEVER
BECOMING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED

00:05:53.953 --> 00:05:54.187 align:start size:88% position:13%

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:54.721 size:88% position:44%
HE'S QUITE ORDINARY.

00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:58.691
BUT HE'S THE FIRST PERSON WHO
HAS NO SENSE WHATSOEVER THAT IF

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:01.461
YOU'RE USING LANGUAGE, AS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.397 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU'RE USING IT AS A KIND OF

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:05.898
YOU'RE NEVER REALLY CHATTING.

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:07.300
YOU'RE KIND OF SIGNALING.

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.370
AND FOR HIM, HE THINKS THAT IT'S
OKAY.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:14.207

IT'S BECOME SO, TO JUST RUN YOUR
