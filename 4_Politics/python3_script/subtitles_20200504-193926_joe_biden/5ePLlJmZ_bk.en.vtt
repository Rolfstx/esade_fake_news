00:00:01.301 --> 00:00:02.535
Hello, everyone,
and welcome back to the attic.

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.437
So last night,
I noticed there was

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.339
a little bit
of speculation online

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:09.275
over the fact that my various
copies of "The Thorn Birds,"

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:11.477
the 1977 Australian
romance novel

00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:13.913
that inspired
the hit 1983 miniseries

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.715
starring Richard Chamberlain,

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:18.017
had disappeared
from the book pile.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:20.219
And I just want to
assure everyone we are,

00:00:20.219 --> 00:00:21.554
you know, looking into it.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:24.623
Our best guess is
I left the window open

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.259
to let the wasps out,

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.895
and the Thorn Birds
took advantage and flew away.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.465
Now, generally birds fly south
for the winter,

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:35.568
but Thorn Birds fly, as you know
if you've read the book,

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:37.136
where their passions take them.

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.405
Anyway, we're hoping they come
back, but in the meantime,

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.273
the thing we definitely
don't want to come back

00:00:41.273 --> 00:00:43.043
is the coronavirus.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.411
Our segues are getting worse,
right?

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:47.980
It's not just me
that's thinking that?

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.650
Anyway, the president
ignored repeated warnings

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:51.818
in his intelligence briefings

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:53.386
that the pandemic
could be devastating.

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.788
And now he and his sycophants
on state TV

00:00:55.788 --> 00:00:58.491
are pushing people to go back
to work before it's safe.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:01:01.127
For more on this,
it's time for "A Closer Look."

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.232
We already know
that the president

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.434
ignored repeated warnings
from public health experts

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:09.768
and intelligence officials

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:12.672
about the threat posed
by the coronavirus for months.

00:01:12.672 --> 00:01:16.042
In fact, ABC reported
that an intelligence report

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:19.512
warned of the coronavirus crisis
as early as November

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:23.049
and that analysts concluded
it could be a cataclysmic event.

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:24.650
Of course, back in November,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.619
Trump had bigger things
on his plate.

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.923
-They don't want to use
the term "Thanksgiving."

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:32.925
And that was true also
with "Christmas."

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:35.360
But now everybody's
using "Christmas" again.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.996
Remember I said that?

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:39.299
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:43.970
But now we're gonna have to do
a little work on "Thanksgiving."

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.271
People have different ideas

00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:47.206
why it shouldn't
be called Thanksgiving.

00:01:47.206 --> 00:01:48.841
But everybody in this room
I know

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:52.078
loves the name Thanksgiving,
and we're not changing it.

00:01:52.078 --> 00:01:55.514
-The word "Christmas"
was breathtakingly dumb,

00:01:55.514 --> 00:01:57.283
but at least I understood it.

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:00.653
I mean, what else would we
even call Thanksgiving?

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.056
Green Bean Casserole
Avoidance Day?

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:05.357
The Festival of Gravy Farts?

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:07.326
"It was a miracle, Timmy.

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:10.896
They had but only one
gravy boat,

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:14.133
and yet the farting lasted
for eight nights."

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.636
Of course, that idea,
like all of Trump's dumb ideas,

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:19.505
was something he regurgitated
from Fox News.

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:22.108
Trump could see literally
anything on Fox News,

00:02:22.108 --> 00:02:24.443
and he would mindlessly
repeat it the next day.

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:27.780
"You know, I saw
the great Tom Selleck,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.549
Magnum, P.I. himself,

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:32.986
talking about reverse mortgages,
and it gave me an idea.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:37.223
Why don't we create
a reverse coronavirus?

00:02:37.223 --> 00:02:40.026
It would reverse the symptoms
and make you better

00:02:40.026 --> 00:02:41.794
but be exactly like
the coronavirus.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:45.131
And then when you shook hands,
you would be curing people.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:46.633
I don't know.

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:48.668
May be worth a shot.
What do you think, Fauci?

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:49.969
Fauci?

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.137
Fauci, I can't hear you

00:02:51.137 --> 00:02:52.538
when you talk through your hand
like that.

00:02:52.538 --> 00:02:55.508
It's blocking -- I'll just
assume it's full steam ahead.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.842
Fauci."

00:02:56.842 --> 00:02:58.410
So Trump was getting warnings
about the coronavirus

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:59.712
as early as November.

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:01.648
And then on Monday,
"The Washington Post" reported

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.584
that in January and February,
he was also getting warnings

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.552
in his daily
intelligence briefings.

00:03:06.552 --> 00:03:08.587
-"The Washington Post"
reports tonight

00:03:08.587 --> 00:03:09.955
U.S. intelligence agencies

00:03:09.955 --> 00:03:12.224
issued warnings about
the novel coronavirus

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:15.328
in more than a dozen
classified briefings

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:18.531
prepared for President Trump
in January and February,

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:22.735
months during which he continued
to play down the threat.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:24.904
According to current
and former U.S. officials,

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:26.939
the repeated warnings
were conveyed

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:29.341
in issues of the president's
daily brief,

00:03:29.341 --> 00:03:33.546
a sensitive report that is
produced before dawn each day

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.915
and designed to call
the president's attention

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.150
to the most significant
global developments

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.719
and security threats.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.454
-So while Trump
was telling everyone

00:03:41.454 --> 00:03:43.055
it would disappear
like a miracle

00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:44.757
and cases would soon
go down to zero,

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:47.993
he was getting private warnings
that actually it was a big deal,

00:03:47.993 --> 00:03:49.862
which means either one
of two things --

00:03:49.862 --> 00:03:51.597
He was lying
or he didn't read it,

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:53.933
and honestly,
both are probably true.

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:56.235
Trump's like a high school
student doing a book report

00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:58.504
who not only didn't read
the book, but even if he did,

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:01.207
you know it would go
way over his head anyway.

00:04:01.207 --> 00:04:04.710
"'Beowulf' is about a wolf
who's also a lifeguard.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.447
That's the 'Bay' part.
Works with Pamela Anderson.

00:04:08.447 --> 00:04:11.818
Anderson.
[ Mumbles ]"

00:04:11.818 --> 00:04:14.486
And once Trump heard them refer
to it as the novel coronavirus,

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:15.622
he was never gonna read it

00:04:15.622 --> 00:04:17.323
because he's never
gone near a novel.

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:18.758
They should have told him
it was called

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:20.459
"Sports Illustrated"
swimsuit issue coronavirus,

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.094
and he would have at least
thumbed through it.

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:25.064
"Well, I mean, she's a 10,
but her friend's a real dog.

00:04:25.064 --> 00:04:27.466
Should do something
about her friend.

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:29.469
Create a task force
or something."

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.571
You know what? This is
probably not fair of me.

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:34.140
I'm sure the president
read the briefings.

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.041
-But the alarms
appear to have failed

00:04:36.041 --> 00:04:37.510
to register with the president,

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.347
who routinely skips
reading the PDB

00:04:41.347 --> 00:04:44.783
and has at times
shown little patience

00:04:44.783 --> 00:04:47.086
for even the oral summary

00:04:47.086 --> 00:04:50.890
he takes two or three times
per week.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.992
-Not only does he
not read the briefings,

00:04:52.992 --> 00:04:56.596
he loses patience
during the oral summary.

00:04:56.596 --> 00:04:58.764
What do they have to do
to keep this guy's attention?

00:04:58.764 --> 00:04:59.865
Have his daily briefings

00:04:59.865 --> 00:05:01.467
delivered
by pageant contestants?

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.136
"My name is Briana.
I'm from Battle Creek, Michigan.

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:06.239
And a new virus spreading
across the globe

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.407
has a 3.4% mortality rate."

00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:10.543
This fits with what we know
about Trump

00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:12.344
and how he consumes
his intelligence briefings.

00:05:12.344 --> 00:05:14.547
For example, soon after
he first took office,

00:05:14.547 --> 00:05:17.716
it was reported that, "National
Security Council officials

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:20.085
have strategically
included Trump's name

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:21.854
in as many paragraphs as we can

00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:23.756
because he keeps reading
if he's mentioned.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:27.426
He prefers killer graphics like
pictures, videos, and charts.

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:30.696
The president also favors
tiny nuggets of intelligence

00:05:30.696 --> 00:05:34.133
that pop out at him
during his daily briefings."

00:05:34.133 --> 00:05:37.503
He wants tiny nuggets,
killer graphics,

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:38.637
and to see his own name.

00:05:38.637 --> 00:05:40.239
So he wants a birthday party.

00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:42.074
He wants a child's
birthday party.

00:05:42.074 --> 00:05:44.076
Look, Donald,
Ronald McDonald is here

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:45.944
with your daily
intelligence briefing.

00:05:45.944 --> 00:05:49.548
On Tuesday, Trump was asked
why he downplayed the threat

00:05:49.548 --> 00:05:51.750
even when he was getting
warnings to the contrary

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.885
and said he'd have to go back

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:54.420
and look at the dates
of the reports.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.657
-Can you clarify what
your intelligence advisers

00:05:57.657 --> 00:06:00.359
were telling you back in January
and February?

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:03.395
Were you warned about what was
happening with coronavirus

00:06:03.395 --> 00:06:04.763
and the threat to this country?

00:06:04.763 --> 00:06:06.799
Should there have been
stronger warnings?

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:08.568
What were you hearing every day?

00:06:08.568 --> 00:06:11.103
-I think probably a lot more
than the Democrats,

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:13.372
because a month later,
Nancy Pelosi was saying,

00:06:13.372 --> 00:06:15.440
"Let's dance in the streets
of Chinatown."

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.710
You go back and you take a look

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:20.545
at even professionals
like Anthony were saying,

00:06:20.545 --> 00:06:21.546
"This is no problem."

00:06:21.546 --> 00:06:22.748
This is late in February.

00:06:22.748 --> 00:06:26.085
"This is no problem.
This is gonna blow over."

00:06:26.085 --> 00:06:29.354
And they're professionals
and they're good professionals.

00:06:29.354 --> 00:06:31.691
Most people thought this
was gonna blow over.

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.793
-Did you have any warnings
in your...

00:06:33.793 --> 00:06:35.962
-I'd have to check.
I would have to check.

00:06:35.962 --> 00:06:39.731
I want to look as to
the exact dates of warnings.

00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:41.534
-Okay, couple things.

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:44.203
First of all,
Nancy Pelosi did not say,

00:06:44.203 --> 00:06:46.072
"Let's dance in the streets
of Chinatown."

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:47.240
What are you talking about?

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.608
Sounds like a lyric
from a Tony Bennett song.

00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:53.845
♪ Let's dance in the streets
of Chinatown ♪

00:06:53.845 --> 00:06:57.249
♪ Let's go swimming
in the Hudson River ♪

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:58.617
[Bleep]

00:06:58.617 --> 00:07:00.352
That sounded good.

00:07:00.352 --> 00:07:04.156
These attic acoustics
are outstanding.

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:06.224
Can we get that over
to Columbia Records?

00:07:06.224 --> 00:07:08.527
Why?
Oh, because you're a wasp?

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.363
Well, oh, I'm sorry

00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:13.398
that I thought you might
add some value.

00:07:13.398 --> 00:07:15.935
Sorry. Where was I?
Oh, right.

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.637
No one was saying this was
gonna blow over,

00:07:18.637 --> 00:07:20.139
beside you and Fox News.

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:22.608
That's not how public health
experts talk about pandemics.

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:25.444
That's how Real Housewives
talk about their feuds.

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:28.080
"Look, just stay away
from Ramona for a few days,

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.516
and this will all blow over."

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:31.984
It's just one of many examples

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:34.252
in which Trump has aggressively
ignored advice and warnings

00:07:34.252 --> 00:07:35.321
from his own experts,

00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:37.222
like when the CDC
issued new guidelines

00:07:37.222 --> 00:07:39.592
recommending that Americans
to wear face masks

00:07:39.592 --> 00:07:41.560
to prevent the spread
of coronavirus.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.295
When he announced
the guidelines,

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:45.898
Trump added that he personally
would not follow them.

00:07:45.898 --> 00:07:51.003
-The CDC is advising the use of
non-medical cloth face covering

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:54.473
as an additional
voluntary public health measure.

00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:56.442
So it's voluntary.
You don't have to do it.

00:07:56.442 --> 00:07:59.644
They suggest it
for a period of time.

00:07:59.644 --> 00:08:02.915
But this is voluntary.

00:08:02.915 --> 00:08:04.550
I don't think
I'm gonna be doing it.

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.253
I don't know. Somehow sitting
in the Oval Office

00:08:07.253 --> 00:08:11.857
behind that beautiful resolute
desk, the great resolute desk,

00:08:11.857 --> 00:08:17.029
I think wearing a face mask
as I greet presidents,

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:20.799
prime ministers, dictators,
kings, queens -- I don't know --

00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:23.101
somehow I don't see it
for myself.

00:08:23.101 --> 00:08:26.105
I just don't.
Maybe I'll change my mind.

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:27.506
-Guess I can't be that surprised

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:29.775
that a guy who has unprotected
sex with porn stars

00:08:29.775 --> 00:08:31.477
and pops cheeseburgers
like Tic Tacs

00:08:31.477 --> 00:08:33.379
would ignore a warning
from the CDC.

00:08:33.379 --> 00:08:36.648
Seems like he might be more of
a "roll the dice" kind of guy.

00:08:36.648 --> 00:08:38.584
And I'd say there's a good
chance you'll change your mind

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:39.952
because you change your mind
about everything.

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:41.620
We all know Trump
is easily swayed

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.556
by, you know, the last thing
someone said to him.

00:08:44.556 --> 00:08:47.059
He's almost like
a senile family patriarch

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.527
whose kids
are fighting over the will.

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:50.329
"I'm giving the house to Tyler."

00:08:50.329 --> 00:08:51.631
"Why should he get it all
to himself?"

00:08:51.631 --> 00:08:52.965
"You're right.
That wouldn't be fair.

00:08:52.965 --> 00:08:55.201
Get out of here, Tyler!"

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:58.204
Trump's only capable of exactly
one thought at a time.

00:08:58.204 --> 00:08:59.905
He's our first amoeba president.

00:08:59.905 --> 00:09:02.040
And second, I think
you're having trouble

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.376
picturing that scene
not because of the mask,

00:09:04.376 --> 00:09:05.410
but because of the desk.

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:06.244
You're never there.

00:09:06.244 --> 00:09:07.346
You're always golfing

00:09:07.346 --> 00:09:08.747
or out on the lawn
yelling at reporters

00:09:08.747 --> 00:09:10.616
like an old man telling
the neighborhood kids

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:12.251
they're not getting
their Frisbee back.

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:16.154
And when you do show up,
your desk is spotless,

00:09:16.154 --> 00:09:18.424
like a busboy
just cleaned it off.

00:09:18.424 --> 00:09:21.227
I mean, even the desks
at a furniture store

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:23.162
have a calendar
or something on them

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:24.964
so you can imagine yourself
working on it.

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:27.833
This is what a desk looks like
after you've been fired

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.968
and all your stuff
is in a cardboard box

00:09:29.968 --> 00:09:31.737
with a fern sticking out of it.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:35.908
Mm, damn, that picture
makes me want to sing.

00:09:35.908 --> 00:09:39.812
♪ Dance in the streets
of Chinatown ♪

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:43.982
♪ Have a drink with
the Statue of Liberty ♪

00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:48.654
♪ Go swimming
in the Chicago fountain ♪

00:09:48.654 --> 00:09:52.257
♪ From the opening credits
of "Married...with Children" ♪

00:09:52.257 --> 00:09:53.859
Anyway, so Trump
wouldn't wear his mask

00:09:53.859 --> 00:09:55.694
even though his own government
recommended it,

00:09:55.694 --> 00:09:57.830
just like he said
the coronavirus was no big deal

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.532
when his government
was telling him it was.

00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:02.034
But as we all know,
the sycophants around Trump

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:05.504
have always had to mimic him
for fear of incurring his wrath.

00:10:05.504 --> 00:10:06.805
And so yesterday,

00:10:06.805 --> 00:10:10.208
when Vice President Mike Pence
visited the Mayo Clinic,

00:10:10.208 --> 00:10:11.677
he declined to wear a mask

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:14.846
despite the fact that the clinic
requires visitors to wear masks

00:10:14.846 --> 00:10:17.583
and they made Pence's office
aware of that fact

00:10:17.583 --> 00:10:18.717
before the trip.

00:10:18.717 --> 00:10:22.721
Well, at least that image
will last forever.

00:10:22.721 --> 00:10:23.889
I mean, look at that.

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:25.524
He's the only one
not wearing a mask.

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:27.626
Why couldn't you just
follow the rules, man?

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:29.628
Do you think if you purse
your lips hard enough,

00:10:29.628 --> 00:10:31.163
the virus can't get in?

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:33.365
He's like the ass[bleep]
who shows up at a restaurant

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:35.967
with no shirt and no shoes,
still demanding service,

00:10:35.967 --> 00:10:39.772
yelling, "Give me crab cakes
or give me death, man."

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:42.107
And, Mike, you may not
have coronavirus.

00:10:42.107 --> 00:10:44.510
But that doesn't mean you can't
spread the other diseases

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:48.013
you do have, like, for example,
rheumatoid gravititis

00:10:48.013 --> 00:10:51.116
or chronic furrowed brow
or mayonnaise blood.

00:10:51.116 --> 00:10:52.451
Pence was asked later

00:10:52.451 --> 00:10:54.787
why he refused to follow
the Mayo Clinic's guidelines,

00:10:54.787 --> 00:10:56.688
And his answer
didn't really make sense.

00:10:56.688 --> 00:10:59.592
-Mr. Vice President, there's
obviously been some controversy

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.060
since you got here

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.495
about the decision not to wear
a mask around the Mayo Clinic,

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:06.665
as the governor
and other officials here did.

00:11:06.665 --> 00:11:07.833
Can you just walk us through

00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:09.802
why you made the decision
not to wear the mask

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:11.203
even though the clinic,

00:11:11.203 --> 00:11:13.973
they tweeted that they
had asked you to do so.

00:11:13.973 --> 00:11:17.042
-When the CDC issued guidelines
about wearing a mask,

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:18.944
it was their recognition

00:11:18.944 --> 00:11:22.181
that people that may have
the coronavirus

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:24.516
could prevent the possibility

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:29.021
of conveying the virus to
someone else by wearing a mask.

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:31.156
And since I don't have
the coronavirus,

00:11:31.156 --> 00:11:34.493
I thought it'd be a good
opportunity for me to be here,

00:11:34.493 --> 00:11:36.428
to be able to speak
to these researchers,

00:11:36.428 --> 00:11:38.530
these incredible
healthcare personnel,

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:41.233
and look them in the eye
and say thank you.

00:11:41.233 --> 00:11:44.704
-You can still see people's eyes
with a mask on.

00:11:44.704 --> 00:11:47.206
It's the Mayo Clinic,
not Daft Punk.

00:11:47.206 --> 00:11:49.608
For real, how do you think
you're supposed to wear a mask?

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:51.176
It's never supposed to
cover your eyes,

00:11:51.176 --> 00:11:52.944
unless you're thinking about
"Fifty Shades of Grey."

00:11:52.944 --> 00:11:55.714
[ Gasps ] Which means you've
seen "Fifty Shades of Grey."

00:11:55.714 --> 00:11:57.816
Mike Pence, you nasty.

00:11:57.816 --> 00:12:00.686
But this gets at a core maxim
of the Trump cult.

00:12:00.686 --> 00:12:03.556
They see themselves as above
the rules and above you.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.724
That's why Trump and his
sycophants on Fox News

00:12:05.724 --> 00:12:07.659
are all talking about
reopening the economy

00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:10.963
and proclaiming that we all
need to get back to work.

00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:13.899
What they really mean is
you need to get back to work

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:16.068
while they all sit comfortably
in safe isolation,

00:12:16.068 --> 00:12:18.970
you know, like Real Housewife
of Westchester Jeanine Pirro

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.139
or Long Island Lurch
Sean Hannity.

00:12:21.139 --> 00:12:22.541
This crisis has revealed

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:25.777
everything the conservative
movement pretended to believe in

00:12:25.777 --> 00:12:26.912
to be a fraud.

00:12:26.912 --> 00:12:29.314
And there's really
no better example of that

00:12:29.314 --> 00:12:31.717
than the protests
you've probably seen on TV

00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:33.284
against the stay-at-home orders.

00:12:33.284 --> 00:12:36.488
In reality, polls show
the vast majority of Americans

00:12:36.488 --> 00:12:37.956
support the stay-at-home rules.

00:12:37.956 --> 00:12:39.224
But these small protests

00:12:39.224 --> 00:12:41.327
are being ginned up
by right-wing groups

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:44.296
to support Trump's push to
prematurely reopen the economy.

00:12:44.296 --> 00:12:47.699
Groups like FreedomWorks,
which played a pivotal role

00:12:47.699 --> 00:12:49.968
in the Tea Party movement
10 years ago

00:12:49.968 --> 00:12:52.871
specifically decrying bailouts.

00:12:52.871 --> 00:12:54.172
"The New York Times" reported

00:12:54.172 --> 00:12:55.874
that among the applicants
for loans

00:12:55.874 --> 00:12:58.310
from the Small Business
Administration stimulus package

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.379
is the foundation arm
of FreedomWorks.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.281
The president
of FreedomWorks said,

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:04.550
"I would love someone
to give us free cash."

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.017
You got to love the Trump era,

00:13:06.017 --> 00:13:08.319
when people just admit
their [bleep] out loud.

00:13:08.319 --> 00:13:10.256
"Hey, maybe say
we want the money

00:13:10.256 --> 00:13:12.657
to pay our employees
in these trying times.

00:13:12.657 --> 00:13:15.994
Nah, I'm gonna go with,
'I'd love free cash.'"

00:13:15.994 --> 00:13:17.429
And I have an idea,
FreedomWorks.

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:19.064
Instead of freeloading
off the government,

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:20.966
why don't you pick yourself up
by your bootstraps

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.468
and take some personal
responsibility?

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.270
Go out there and get a job
as an essential worker

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.073
in a grocery store
or as a postal worker

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:30.075
or in a meat processing plant.

00:13:30.075 --> 00:13:31.877
All you have to do is change
one letter in your name,

00:13:31.877 --> 00:13:33.779
and, boom, you're no longer
FreedomWorks.

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:35.246
You're FreedomPorks.

00:13:35.246 --> 00:13:36.915
This crisis has revealed
once again

00:13:36.915 --> 00:13:38.617
that everything
these people told you

00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:39.985
about the conservative movement

00:13:39.985 --> 00:13:42.154
and what they pretended
to stand for was a lie.

00:13:42.154 --> 00:13:44.456
They're all frauds,
and now they're all sycophants

00:13:44.456 --> 00:13:45.858
to an incompetent authoritarian

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:48.327
who repeatedly ignored warnings
about what was coming.

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:50.662
And one day,
when they're all out of power,

00:13:50.662 --> 00:13:52.865
I'll be the first to say,
hey, everyone...

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:55.000
-Let's dance in the streets
of Chinatown.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.236
-This has been "A Closer Look."

00:14:00.539 --> 00:14:02.307
We've been talking
about City Harvest

00:14:02.307 --> 00:14:03.708
on our show during this crisis.

00:14:03.708 --> 00:14:05.977
And you have been
incredibly helpful.

00:14:05.977 --> 00:14:08.079
So if you can,
please keep giving.

00:14:08.079 --> 00:14:09.448
With unemployment skyrocketing,

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:11.049
they are keeping
their trucks full

00:14:11.049 --> 00:14:12.951
to feed the growing number
of New Yorkers

00:14:12.951 --> 00:14:15.254
who are turning to them
to put food on their tables.

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:17.889
If you're watching this online,
please hit the "donate" button.

00:14:17.889 --> 00:14:20.893
Stay safe. Wash your hands.
We love you.
