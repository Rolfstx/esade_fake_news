that<00:02:44.690><c> I</c><00:02:44.750><c> questioned</c><00:02:45.350><c> throughout</c><00:02:45.710><c> the</c><00:02:45.890><c> build</c>

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 align:start position:0%
that I questioned throughout the build
 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.490 align:start position:0%
that I questioned throughout the build
then<00:02:46.340><c> I</c><00:02:46.430><c> go</c><00:02:46.610><c> I</c><00:02:46.880><c> have</c><00:02:47.480><c> no</c><00:02:47.690><c> idea</c><00:02:47.990><c> how</c><00:02:48.170><c> this</c><00:02:48.350><c> is</c>

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 align:start position:0%

and Oliver was like you know that's not
exactly<00:03:14.480><c> gonna</c><00:03:14.840><c> work</c><00:03:15.110><c> so</c><00:03:15.440><c> I</c><00:03:15.650><c> think</c><00:03:15.740><c> that's</c>

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 align:start position:0%

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 align:start position:0%
we do use the services when we have

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 align:start position:0%
the heating inside is all propane so

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 align:start position:0%
that really takes the electrical load

here so it's really important to be able
to<00:16:28.610><c> close</c><00:16:28.820><c> those</c><00:16:29.090><c> definitely</c><00:16:29.660><c> nice</c><00:16:29.930><c> having</c>

00:16:29.950 --> 00:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
to close those definitely nice having
 

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.170 align:start position:0%
to close those definitely nice having
that<00:16:30.410><c> option</c><00:16:30.590><c> and</c><00:16:30.920><c> now</c><00:16:31.250><c> what's</c><00:16:31.550><c> this</c><00:16:31.730><c> unit</c><00:16:32.060><c> up</c>

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:32.180 align:start position:0%
that option and now what's this unit up
 

00:16:32.180 --> 00:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
that option and now what's this unit up
here<00:16:32.420><c> yeah</c><00:16:32.690><c> so</c><00:16:32.960><c> we</c><00:16:33.050><c> just</c><00:16:33.200><c> went</c><00:16:33.350><c> with</c><00:16:33.440><c> a</c><00:16:33.560><c> plug-in</c>

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.010 align:start position:0%
here yeah so we just went with a plug-in
 

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:37.390 align:start position:0%
here yeah so we just went with a plug-in
a/c<00:16:34.370><c> for</c><00:16:35.300><c> us</c><00:16:35.420><c> we</c><00:16:35.660><c> don't</c><00:16:35.750><c> use</c><00:16:36.140><c> an</c><00:16:36.470><c> AC</c><00:16:36.650><c> enough</c><00:16:37.190><c> to</c>

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:37.400 align:start position:0%
a/c for us we don't use an AC enough to
 

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
a/c for us we don't use an AC enough to
really<00:16:37.580><c> justify</c><00:16:38.000><c> like</c><00:16:38.390><c> a</c><00:16:38.420><c> built</c><00:16:38.810><c> in</c><00:16:38.990><c> unit</c><00:16:39.350><c> so</c>

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:39.530 align:start position:0%
really justify like a built in unit so
 

00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:40.930 align:start position:0%
really justify like a built in unit so
we<00:16:39.650><c> just</c><00:16:39.830><c> went</c><00:16:39.980><c> with</c><00:16:40.100><c> one</c><00:16:40.340><c> that</c><00:16:40.460><c> sits</c><00:16:40.670><c> on</c><00:16:40.820><c> the</c>

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:40.940 align:start position:0%
we just went with one that sits on the
 

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.850 align:start position:0%
we just went with one that sits on the
floor<00:16:41.090><c> we</c><00:16:41.720><c> don't</c><00:16:41.750><c> use</c><00:16:42.110><c> that</c><00:16:42.140><c> corner</c><00:16:42.650><c> space</c>

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:42.860 align:start position:0%
floor we don't use that corner space
 

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
floor we don't use that corner space
anyway<00:16:43.370><c> it's</c><00:16:43.640><c> doesn't</c><00:16:43.820><c> really</c><00:16:44.060><c> matter</c><00:16:44.330><c> to</c><00:16:44.540><c> us</c>

00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:44.570 align:start position:0%
anyway it's doesn't really matter to us
 

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.180 align:start position:0%
anyway it's doesn't really matter to us
so<00:16:44.930><c> it's</c><00:16:45.110><c> just</c><00:16:45.320><c> there</c><00:16:45.470><c> when</c><00:16:45.650><c> we</c><00:16:45.710><c> need</c><00:16:45.860><c> it</c><00:16:45.890><c> so</c>

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:46.190 align:start position:0%
so it's just there when we need it so
 

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.860 align:start position:0%
so it's just there when we need it so

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:27.560 align:start position:0%
way that we live and really we haven't
 

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.430 align:start position:0%
way that we live and really we haven't
sacrificed<00:17:28.250><c> a</c><00:17:28.730><c> whole</c><00:17:29.420><c> lot</c><00:17:29.630><c> to</c><00:17:29.900><c> move</c><00:17:30.080><c> from</c>

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
sacrificed a whole lot to move from
 

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:32.500 align:start position:0%
sacrificed a whole lot to move from
basically<00:17:31.010><c> you</c><00:17:31.220><c> know</c><00:17:31.310><c> 2,500</c><00:17:32.210><c> square</c><00:17:32.390><c> feet</c>

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:32.510 align:start position:0%
basically you know 2,500 square feet
 

00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:36.250 align:start position:0%
basically you know 2,500 square feet
down<00:17:32.990><c> to</c><00:17:33.670><c> 225</c><00:17:34.670><c> so</c><00:17:35.180><c> yeah</c><00:17:35.330><c> this</c><00:17:35.480><c> really</c><00:17:35.690><c> gave</c><00:17:36.050><c> us</c>

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:36.260 align:start position:0%
down to 225 so yeah this really gave us
 

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
down to 225 so yeah this really gave us
the<00:17:36.410><c> opportunity</c><00:17:36.650><c> for</c><00:17:37.640><c> us</c><00:17:37.730><c> to</c><00:17:37.790><c> kind</c><00:17:38.000><c> of</c><00:17:38.120><c> go</c>

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:38.210 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for us to kind of go
 

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:40.330 align:start position:0%
