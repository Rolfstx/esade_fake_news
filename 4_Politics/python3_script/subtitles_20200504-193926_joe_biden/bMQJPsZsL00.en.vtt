00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:04.204
-Good evening,
ladies and remaining gentlemen.

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:08.308
[ Laughter ]

00:00:08.308 --> 00:00:10.643
I'm Seth Meyers,
and I'll be your host tonight.

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:14.046
Welcome to
the 75th annual Golden Globes,

00:00:14.046 --> 00:00:16.516
and Happy New Year, Hollywood.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:19.952
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:22.388
It's 2018.

00:00:22.388 --> 00:00:24.557
Marijuana is finally allowed,

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:27.093
and sexual harassment
finally isn't.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.061
[ Laughter, cheers, applause ]

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:31.464
It's gonna be a good year!

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:36.402
[ Cheers and applause
continues ]

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:39.972
This was the year of
big little lies and "get out"

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:42.908
and also the television series
"Big Little Lies"

00:00:42.908 --> 00:00:44.811
and the movie "Get Out."

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.713
[ Laughter ]

00:00:47.713 --> 00:00:51.050
There's a new era under way,
and I can tell,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.187
because it's been years
since a white man

00:00:54.187 --> 00:00:55.955
was this nervous in Hollywood.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.991
[ Laughter ]

00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:59.959
By the way,
a special hello to hosts

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:02.928
of other upcoming awards shows
who are watching me tonight

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:06.031
like the first dog
they shot into outer space.

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:10.937
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:01:10.937 --> 00:01:13.206
For the male nominees
in the room tonight,

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:15.241
this is the first time
in three months

00:01:15.241 --> 00:01:18.510
it won't be terrifying
to hear your name read out loud.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.649
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.951
"Did you hear
about Willem Dafoe?"

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:28.154
"Oh, God, no!"
"He was nominated."

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.688
"Don't do that!
[ Laughter ]

00:01:29.688 --> 00:01:32.691
Don't do that!"

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:36.428
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:39.866
Considering what has been going
on this year with powerful men

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:41.500
and their terrible behavior
in Hollywood,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.136
a lot of people thought
it would be more appropriate

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:45.771
for a woman
to host these awards,

00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:47.207
and they may be right.

00:01:47.207 --> 00:01:48.708
But if it's any consolation,

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:51.844
I'm a man with absolutely
no power in Hollywood.

00:01:51.844 --> 00:01:53.178
[ Laughter ]

00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:58.117
I'm not even the most powerful
Seth in the room tonight.

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:00.753
[ Laughter ]

00:02:00.753 --> 00:02:02.555
Hey, remember
when he was the guy

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:04.457
making trouble with North Korea?

00:02:04.457 --> 00:02:07.760
[ Laughter, cheers, applause ]

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.529
Remember that?

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:14.200
[ Applause continues ]

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.304
Simpler times.
[ Laughter ]

00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:20.540
They tried to get a woman
to host this show --

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.941
they really did.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.477
They said, "Hey, how would you
like to come and be judged

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:26.746
by some of the most powerful
people in Hollywood?"

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:29.015
And women were like,
"Hmm, well, where is it?"

00:02:29.015 --> 00:02:30.316
And they said,
"It's at a hotel,"

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:32.085
and long story short,
I'm your host tonight.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.954
[ Laughter ]

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:36.088
And we're all here tonight

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:39.391
courtesy of
the Hollywood Foreign Press.

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.960
A strin-- Yeah.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.065
Give it up
for the Hollywood Foreign Press.

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:48.801
A string of three words
that could not have

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:52.371
been better designed
to infuriate our President --

00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.040
Hollywood Foreign Press.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.976
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.345
The only name
that would make him angrier

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.614
would be the Hillary Mexico
Salad Association.

00:03:02.614 --> 00:03:07.620
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.823
Well, I think it's time
to address the elephant

00:03:10.823 --> 00:03:12.558
not in the room.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:15.228
Harvey Weinstein
isn't here tonight,

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:17.730
because, well, I've heard rumors

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.533
that he's crazy
and difficult to work with.

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:21.700
[ Laughter ]

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.703
But don't worry --
he'll be back in 20 years

00:03:23.703 --> 00:03:24.904
when he becomes the first person

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:27.106
ever booed
during the "In Memoriam."

00:03:27.106 --> 00:03:30.375
[ Laughter, audience groans ]

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:31.944
It'll sound like that.

00:03:31.944 --> 00:03:34.813
[ Laughter ]

00:03:34.813 --> 00:03:36.749
Well, despite everything
that happened this year,

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:37.817
the show goes on.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:39.418
For example, I was happy to hear

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:42.021
they're gonna do another season
of "House of Cards."

00:03:42.021 --> 00:03:44.424
Is Christopher Plummer
available for that, too?

00:03:44.424 --> 00:03:46.024
[ Laughter ]

00:03:46.024 --> 00:03:48.227
I hope he can do
a Southern accent,

00:03:48.227 --> 00:03:50.229
'cause Kevin Spacey
sure couldn't.

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:51.697
[ Laughter, audience groans ]

00:03:51.697 --> 00:03:53.633
Oh, is that too mean?

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.334
To Kevin Spacey?

00:03:55.334 --> 00:03:58.704
[ Laughter ]

00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:01.707
Daniel Kaluuya
is nominated for Best Actor...

00:04:01.707 --> 00:04:07.646
[ Cheers and applause ]
...for his work in "Get Out."

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:10.950
Daniel plays a young man
lured to an event

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.184
full of aging white people

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:13.886
desperate
to reclaim their youth,

00:04:13.886 --> 00:04:16.422
and -- oh, my God,
Daniel, it's a trap!

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:21.326
Get out!
[ Laughter ]

00:04:21.326 --> 00:04:23.429
"Get Out" was a great film
to see in a theater

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:26.732
and also a great way to tell
if your date was a racist.

00:04:26.732 --> 00:04:29.268
If you walked out after
that movie and your date said,

00:04:29.268 --> 00:04:33.606
"It was so sad when they hit
that deer," they're a racist.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.442
You went to a movie
with a racist.

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:38.877
"The Shape of Water"
received the most nominations

00:04:38.877 --> 00:04:40.279
of any film this year.

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:45.718
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:04:45.718 --> 00:04:47.753
Just an incredibly
beautiful film.

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:49.855
But I have to admit,
when I first heard

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:51.690
about a film
where a naive young woman

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.759
falls in love
with a disgusting sea monster,

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.963
I thought, "Oh, man,
not another Woody Allen movie."

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:59.064
[ Laughter ]

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:02.201
It's like "Manhattan" in water.

00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:04.870
"The Post" is nominated
for Best Picture tonight.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.909
"The Post"...
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.379
"The Post" is a film
about journalistic integrity,

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:15.214
directed by Steven Spielberg

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:16.715
and starring Tom Hanks
and Meryl Streep --

00:05:16.715 --> 00:05:18.384
No, not yet, we have to wait.

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.618
[ Laughter ]

00:05:19.618 --> 00:05:20.820
We have to wait
and see what happens.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:29.795
[ Laughter, cheers, applause ]

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:33.499
There was some great television
nominated this year, too.

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:36.969
We had another fantastic season
of "Stranger Things."

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.006
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:44.410
"Stranger Things" reminded me
so much of my childhood.

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.513
Not the sci-fi stuff, and I
didn't really have any friends.

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.581
I don't know how to ride a bike.

00:05:49.581 --> 00:05:50.750
Basically, just the part

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.186
where a guy from RadioShack
dated my mom.

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:55.421
[ Laughter ]

00:05:55.421 --> 00:05:57.657
"Sesame Street"
recently released a parody

00:05:57.657 --> 00:06:00.059
of "Stranger Things,"
titled "Sharing Things."

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:02.194
Meanwhile, Bert and Ernie
have been doing a parody

00:06:02.194 --> 00:06:04.497
of "Call Me By Your Name"
for years.

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:08.100
[ Laughter ]

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.501
I live in New York,

00:06:09.501 --> 00:06:12.538
so one of my favorite shows
of the year was "The Deuce."

00:06:12.538 --> 00:06:14.707
If you haven't seen it,
"The Deuce" is a show

00:06:14.707 --> 00:06:16.942
about Times Square
in the early '70s,

00:06:16.942 --> 00:06:21.280
when New York was so seedy
there were two James Francos.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.851
[ Laughter ]

00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:30.056
Oprah Winfrey is receiving the
Cecil B. DeMille Award tonight.

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:34.260
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:38.997
What a tremendous honor

00:06:38.997 --> 00:06:40.833
for Cecil B. DeMille.

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.501
[ Laughter ]

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:47.507
And, Oprah, while I have you,
in 2011, I told some jokes

00:06:47.507 --> 00:06:48.641
about our current president

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:50.442
at the White House
Correspondents Dinner --

00:06:50.442 --> 00:06:53.078
jokes about how he was
unqualified to be president --

00:06:53.078 --> 00:06:56.215
and some have said that night
convinced him to run.

00:06:56.215 --> 00:06:58.484
So if that's true,
I just want to say --

00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:01.120
Oprah, you will
never be President!

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.421
[ Laughter ]

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.658
You do not have what it takes!

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:08.994
And Hanks!
Where's Hanks?!

00:07:08.994 --> 00:07:10.997
You will never
be Vice President!

00:07:10.997 --> 00:07:12.531
[ Laughter ]

00:07:12.531 --> 00:07:14.834
You are
too mean and unrelatable!

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.234
[ Laughter ]

00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:18.104
Now we just wait and see.

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.772
[ Laughter ]

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:22.842
So if I may, on my show,
we do a segment called

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:25.111
"Jokes Seth Can't Tell"
with two of my writers,

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:28.414
Amber Ruffin and Jenny Hagel,
where they tell punch lines

00:07:28.414 --> 00:07:31.716
that would be more fun
coming from them instead of me,

00:07:31.716 --> 00:07:33.052
a straight white male.

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:34.520
Tonight,
that's more true than ever,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.255
so we thought we could enlist

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:38.257
some of the brilliant people
in this room, so let's start.

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.259
Where's Jessica Chastain?
Jessica Chastain?

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:41.660
There she is.
Give it up for Jessica.

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.663
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:07:43.663 --> 00:07:45.164
So I'm gonna say the setup,

00:07:45.164 --> 00:07:47.833
and Jessica's
gonna say the punch line.

00:07:47.833 --> 00:07:49.335
Okay, here we go.

00:07:49.335 --> 00:07:52.505
The Golden Globes
turns 75 this year...

00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:56.575
-But the actress that plays
its wife is still only 32.

00:07:56.575 --> 00:07:58.210
[ Laughter ]

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.313
-There you go!
So much more fun.

00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:03.215
Where's Billy Eichner?

00:08:03.215 --> 00:08:05.384
-I'm here!
I'm right over here.

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:06.785
-Here you go.
Here's your setup, Billy --

00:08:06.785 --> 00:08:07.887
"Call Me By Your Name"

00:08:07.887 --> 00:08:10.389
is nominated
for best motion picture.

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:13.191
It is a gay
coming-of-age film...

00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:16.762
-Said Kevin Spacey,
"You lost me at 'of age.'"

00:08:16.762 --> 00:08:19.665
[ Laughter, audience groans ]

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:20.966
-And you thought it was mean

00:08:20.966 --> 00:08:22.935
when I said he didn't have
a Southern accent!

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:24.269
[ Laughter ]

00:08:24.269 --> 00:08:28.107
Issa Rae is nominated
for her HBO show, "Insecure."

00:08:28.107 --> 00:08:29.575
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:32.711
There's Issa.
-Hey.

00:08:32.711 --> 00:08:34.246
-All right, here's your setup.

00:08:34.246 --> 00:08:37.916
"Insecure" creator Issa Rae
currently has three projects

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:39.952
in development with HBO.

00:08:39.952 --> 00:08:41.987
-Yeah, that's right,
and three projects

00:08:41.987 --> 00:08:43.656
is also where they think
I'm from.

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:45.557
[ Laughter ]

00:08:45.557 --> 00:08:48.060
-Next up, Hong Chau,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.262
so brilliant
in the film "Downsizing."

00:08:50.262 --> 00:08:54.066
Let's see Hong.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.335
Here's the setup --
according to a recent article,

00:08:56.335 --> 00:08:58.804
only 5% of speaking roles
in Hollywood

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:01.106
are played by Asian actors.

00:09:01.106 --> 00:09:03.041
-But those numbers might be off

00:09:03.041 --> 00:09:04.809
since a white person
did the math.

00:09:04.809 --> 00:09:08.180
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.749
-All right, where's Amy Poehler?

00:09:10.749 --> 00:09:13.418
All right,
there you are, Amy!

00:09:13.418 --> 00:09:14.986
Do you want to do one?

00:09:14.986 --> 00:09:18.190
-Uh, yeah, I'll do one,
but I don't need your help.

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.725
[ Laughter ]

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:22.628
-Yeah, but, no, I do the setup,
and then you do the punch line.

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:24.963
-Oh, is that how it works?
[ Laughter ]

00:09:24.963 --> 00:09:27.199
You're -- You're explaining
something I already know.

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:28.700
Is this the mansplaining
part of the evening?

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.871
-No, no, I just don't think
it'll work without

00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:33.072
a setup to your punch line.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.506
-Oh, well, I'm glad
to know what you think.

00:09:34.506 --> 00:09:36.274
First of all, thank you
for telling me what you think.

00:09:36.274 --> 00:09:40.179
And, secondly,
I'm a woman in Hollywood, Seth.

00:09:40.179 --> 00:09:41.980
We've all been through a lot.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.217
I don't need a setup
to make a punch line work.

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:47.420
Okay?
You're sadly mistaken.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.288
-Okay, I'm sorry.
I apologize.

00:09:49.288 --> 00:09:52.825
-Oh, another apology.
How wonderful.

00:09:52.825 --> 00:09:54.125
[ Laughter ]

00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:56.162
All right.
Let me just get started.

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:59.765
I'm reclaiming my wine.
Here we go.

00:09:59.765 --> 00:10:01.467
[ Laughter ]

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:02.801
Okay.

00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:04.437
-So you're gonna just
do a punch line with no setup.

00:10:04.437 --> 00:10:07.773
-Everybody gets it!
You already explained it!

00:10:07.773 --> 00:10:11.176
Stop explaining it!

00:10:11.176 --> 00:10:14.112
Oh, my God!
Okay.

00:10:14.112 --> 00:10:18.016
Punch line. No setup.
Here we go.

00:10:18.016 --> 00:10:20.786
Said the peach
in "Call Me By Your Name,"

00:10:20.786 --> 00:10:22.587
this scene is the pits.

00:10:22.587 --> 00:10:27.926
[ Laughter and applause ]

00:10:27.926 --> 00:10:29.261
-Thank you so much, Amy.

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:32.131
Also, I want to point out
that sitting next to Amy

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:35.060
is Saru Jayaraman.
Give it up for Saru, everyone.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.536
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:40.739
She is one of many activists
from outside of this industry

00:10:40.739 --> 00:10:42.308
who have been
invited here tonight

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:44.043
in support of
the Time's Up initiative.

00:10:44.043 --> 00:10:45.844
It's great.
Yeah, give it up.

00:10:45.844 --> 00:10:50.415
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:10:50.415 --> 00:10:53.151
It's great
that this movement understands

00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:54.920
that what tarnished
our world this year

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.556
tarnishes so many others and is
reaching out to help them, too.

00:10:57.556 --> 00:11:00.092
And I know
if you're watching at home

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:02.427
and you see everyone
in their tuxedos and gowns,

00:11:02.427 --> 00:11:04.997
this looks like a room
of privileged Hollywood elite.

00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:07.799
And that's fair.
But everyone in this room knows

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:10.102
that Hollywood
is so much more than that.

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:12.638
When you're on a film set,
you meet hairdressers

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:14.840
and camera people
and script supervisors.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.309
Most of the jobs on film sets

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:19.778
are jobs for people
who work long, hard hours.

00:11:19.778 --> 00:11:22.481
They are American dream jobs.

00:11:22.481 --> 00:11:24.116
Those people aren't there...

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:31.523
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:11:31.523 --> 00:11:34.593
Those people aren't there
thanks to their rich dad,

00:11:34.593 --> 00:11:36.562
except for that one P.A.

00:11:36.562 --> 00:11:38.564
[ Laughter ]

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:41.967
Every film set has at least
one super-connected P.A.

00:11:41.967 --> 00:11:43.702
who is always late.

00:11:43.702 --> 00:11:45.871
And you ask what the hell
his deal is, someone's like,

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:47.973
"Oh, that's Jeremy Paramount."

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:52.210
[ Laughter ]

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:55.213
"Give Jeremy his space."

00:11:55.213 --> 00:11:58.550
People in this room
worked really hard to get here,

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.652
but it's clearer now
than ever before

00:12:00.652 --> 00:12:03.222
that the women
had to work even harder.

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:05.591
So thank you
for all the amazing work

00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:07.359
that you've all done
and you continue to do.

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:10.929
I look forward to you leading us
into whatever comes next.

00:12:10.929 --> 00:12:12.231
So thank you so much
for letting me say that.

00:12:12.231 --> 00:12:13.733
[ Cheers and applause ]
