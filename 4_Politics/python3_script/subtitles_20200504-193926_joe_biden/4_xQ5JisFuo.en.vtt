of the world's two largest
economies.

&gt;&gt; One of the things that
President Trump believes--

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.105
he believes in this totally--

00:02:19.172 --> 00:02:21.808

&gt;&gt; That summit was important,

00:02:57.577 --> 00:02:59.912
because the two leaders
established

a strong personal relationship.

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:08.454
I think the image is that
the two leaders sit together,

and two family actually sit
together.

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:14.060
President Xi and his wife

&gt;&gt; We've had a long discussion
already,

00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:24.804

nothing, absolutely nothing.

00:03:24.871 --> 00:03:27.706

someone that we can talk to.

high, and the hope was,

00:03:49.596 --> 00:03:51.664

the situation

00:03:51.731 --> 00:03:55.034

American steel, too.

And that sent Gaynor's costs
skyrocketing.

00:07:38.858 --> 00:07:40.359

consumer will just say,

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.476
"I, I can't afford this,
this is too expensive"?

00:07:57.542 --> 00:07:59.778
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I, I think there's
always that risk,

00:07:59.845 --> 00:08:02.081
and that's the thing with
tariffs is,

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.884
are you kind of artificially
messing with the price of,

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:07.453
you know, what the market
dictates?

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.021
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: And what people
will be willing to pay.

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:10.422
&gt;&gt; And what people will be
willing to pay.

00:08:10.489 --> 00:08:12.024
Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:13.593
And I think that's the question
with tariffs.

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:17.429
Is it going to do good,
or is it going to do bad?

00:08:17.496 --> 00:08:20.298
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Manufacturers like
Shepherd Chemical were also

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:22.034
hit hard by the tariffs,

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:25.571
especially when China retaliated
with tariffs of its own.

00:08:25.637 --> 00:08:27.773
&gt;&gt; So all these tanks around
here produce

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.475
various metal carboxylates.

00:08:29.542 --> 00:08:33.279
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: C.E.O. Tom Shepherd
sells products to China,

00:08:33.346 --> 00:08:36.048
and he also imports raw
materials from China.

00:08:36.114 --> 00:08:38.450 line:0%
&gt;&gt; Our sales to China
have gone down,

00:08:38.517 --> 00:08:41.687 line:0%
and our raw materials from China
have increased in cost.

00:08:41.754 --> 00:08:43.855 line:8%
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: How big of a
problem is that for you?

00:08:43.922 --> 00:08:48.660
&gt;&gt; Several million dollars of,
of profit lost, in a year.

00:08:48.727 --> 00:08:51.464
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Okay. Yeah, you're
getting it from all sides, then.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.131
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.

00:08:53.198 --> 00:08:55.834
If what we're trying to do is
protect the American economy,

00:08:55.901 --> 00:08:57.803
this is a bad way to do it.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:00.172
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: But despite the
uneven consequences,

00:09:00.238 --> 00:09:04.777
President Trump was all in
on the tariff strategy.

00:09:04.843 --> 00:09:07.679
It's a strategy he's been
talking about for years,

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:10.649
as far back as the late 1980s,

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.318
when he first tested
the possibility

00:09:12.384 --> 00:09:14.219
of becoming president.

00:09:14.286 --> 00:09:16.755 line:0%
&gt;&gt; Our guest, the famed
developer Donald Trump

00:09:16.822 --> 00:09:18.157 line:0%
of New York...

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.092 line:0%
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Back then, Trump's
target was Japan

00:09:20.159 --> 00:09:21.694 line:0%
and its trade practices.

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:23.395
&gt;&gt; The fact is that you don't
have free trade.

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:25.131
We think of it as free trade,

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:26.332
but you right now don't have
free trade.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.534
And I think lot of people are
tired

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.235
of watching other countries
ripping off the United States.

00:09:30.302 --> 00:09:31.370
This is a great country.

00:09:31.436 --> 00:09:33.972
&gt;&gt; He believed from the
beginning

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:36.975
that there's really nothing
worse than being laughed at.

00:09:37.042 --> 00:09:39.011
&gt;&gt; They laugh at us behind our
backs, they laugh at us,

00:09:39.078 --> 00:09:40.379
because of our own stupidity.

00:09:40.446 --> 00:09:43.382 line:0%
&gt;&gt; And he came to see the
Japanese as laughing

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:46.652 line:0%
at the United States and taking
advantage of the United States

00:09:46.719 --> 00:09:50.990 line:0%
by stealing the jobs,
by dumping product here.

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:52.724 line:0%
&gt;&gt; We let Japan come in and dump
everything right

00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:54.359 line:0%
into our markets and everything.

00:09:54.426 --> 00:09:55.894 line:0%
It's not free trade.

00:09:55.961 --> 00:09:57.997 line:0%
If you ever go to Japan right
now and try to sell something,

00:09:58.064 --> 00:09:59.832 line:0%
forget about it, Oprah, just
forget about it,

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.500 line:0%
it's almost impossible.

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:03.368
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: After Japan's
economy cratered,

00:10:03.435 --> 00:10:06.771
Trump shifted his ire to a
rising economic power, China.

00:10:06.838 --> 00:10:09.541
&gt;&gt; They are ripping us like
we've never been ripped before.

00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:12.945
If you look at Japan,
if you look at China,

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:16.181
where we lose $100 billion
a year with China...

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:18.417
&gt;&gt; He's been saying the same
thing for 30 years.

00:10:18.484 --> 00:10:21.253
Donald Trump has a very binary
view of life

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.521
and certainly of the world.

00:10:22.588 --> 00:10:25.424
And, and so to confront China,

00:10:25.491 --> 00:10:28.327
which he perceives as America's
most important

00:10:28.394 --> 00:10:32.765
and dangerous rival, and to be
able to use blunt instruments

00:10:32.832 --> 00:10:36.835
against them, and to come out
and at least be able to say

00:10:36.902 --> 00:10:38.703
that you are a winner
and they are a loser,

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:40.906
there's, it's hard to imagine
anything more appealing

00:10:40.973 --> 00:10:42.875
to the core of his personality.

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:47.479
&gt;&gt; Please welcome the next
president of the United States,

00:10:47.546 --> 00:10:51.283
Mr. Donald J. Trump.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.684
(people applauding and cheering)

00:10:52.751 --> 00:10:55.954
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: By 2016, Trump's
message had finally found

00:10:56.021 --> 00:10:57.889
an audience.

00:10:57.956 --> 00:11:01.661
And his focus on trade
and China had found its moment.

00:11:01.727 --> 00:11:04.763
&gt;&gt; First time I ever met Trump,
I was, you know,

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:07.566
coming out of Goldman Sachs,
and, and being somebody

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:09.068
that had been in finance for a
number of years,

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:11.536
I was set to be unimpressed.

00:11:11.603 --> 00:11:14.739
I was actually very impressed.

00:11:14.806 --> 00:11:16.208 line:0%
Now, he didn't know a lot of
details.

00:11:16.275 --> 00:11:17.676 line:0%
He knew almost no policy.

00:11:17.743 --> 00:11:20.279 line:0%
But what I found most
extraordinary was,

00:11:20.346 --> 00:11:21.413 line:0%
when we got to the section on
China,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.481 line:0%
which I kind of threw out there,

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:26.451 line:0%
of a two-hour meeting, almost 30
minutes or more

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:27.720 line:0%
was all about China.

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:29.754
&gt;&gt; We have a $500 billion
deficit,

00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:32.390
trade deficit with China.

00:11:32.457 --> 00:11:35.193
&gt;&gt; And you've got to remember, a
lot of this he was just reciting

00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:37.863
everything he'd heard
from Lou Dobbs.

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:40.999 line:0%
&gt;&gt; We're talking about a trade
deficit of $315 billion

00:11:41.066 --> 00:11:42.601 line:0%
last year with the Chinese.

00:11:42.667 --> 00:11:44.102 line:0%
&gt;&gt; He's been a guy that's
watched Lou Dobbs

00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:45.403 line:0%
for 30 or 40 years.

00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.840 line:0%
And the only thing he had formed
as a worldview was China.

00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:53.412
&gt;&gt; Because we can't continue to
allow China to rape our country,

00:11:53.479 --> 00:11:55.047
and that's what they're doing.

00:11:55.114 --> 00:11:58.884
It's the greatest theft
in the history of the world.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:01.787
&gt;&gt; He talked in this kind of
vernacular that,

00:12:01.853 --> 00:12:03.922
that kind of hit people
in the, in the gut,

00:12:03.989 --> 00:12:05.824
and particularly when he talked
about trade and jobs

00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:06.992
and jobs shifting overseas.

00:12:07.058 --> 00:12:08.460
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: What was his
message

00:12:08.526 --> 00:12:10.829
to these people on trade?
"China's to blame"?

00:12:10.896 --> 00:12:12.597
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the message's
very simple, is that,

00:12:12.664 --> 00:12:14.366
"The elite shipped the jobs
overseas,

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:16.268
and I'm going to bring
them back."

00:12:16.334 --> 00:12:17.969
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Indiana.

00:12:18.036 --> 00:12:20.672
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: That message helped
propel Trump to the presidency.

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:25.778
And once there, he assembled
his team of advisers on trade.

00:12:25.845 --> 00:12:28.113
To oversee economic policy,

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.449
he brought in the former
president of Goldman Sachs,

00:12:30.515 --> 00:12:32.184
Gary Cohn.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.353
&gt;&gt; The job I had
in the White House

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.123
was to convene everyone who
basically had an opinion

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:41.927
on an economic topic,
and try and come up

00:12:41.994 --> 00:12:47.232
with a recommendation or two,
or present to the president

00:12:47.299 --> 00:12:49.602
completely diametrically opposed
opinions

00:12:49.668 --> 00:12:51.870
and allow the president
to make a decision.

00:12:51.937 --> 00:12:54.373
&gt;&gt; In the Roosevelt Room,
we would have a trade meeting

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.941
every Tuesday, and then we would
take some version of that

00:12:57.008 --> 00:12:59.478
into the Oval
in a smaller group.

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:02.380
If you take all the other
nastiness

00:13:02.447 --> 00:13:04.783
on the things like
the Paris Accord and TPP,

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.685
all this other stuff,
roll it up,

00:13:06.752 --> 00:13:08.653
and put it to the factor of ten,

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.889
they don't compare to these
weekly nasty trade meetings.

00:13:10.956 --> 00:13:12.357
♪ ♪

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:15.293
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: From the start, the
weekly trade meetings surfaced

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:18.664
deep divisions among Trump's
advisers over how to deal

00:13:18.731 --> 00:13:22.401
with rising economic tensions
with China.

00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:25.003
The two camps came to be known
as the globalists

00:13:25.069 --> 00:13:27.639
and the nationalists.

00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:29.774
On the one side, the globalists
included

00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:32.344
former Wall Street executives
like Gary Cohn

00:13:32.411 --> 00:13:34.513
and Steve Mnuchin.

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:37.650
On the other side, the
nationalists included Bannon,

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:40.986
along with Robert Lighthizer
and Peter Navarro,

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:44.022
a hawkish economist whose film
"Death by China"

00:13:44.089 --> 00:13:45.824
caught Trump's attention.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.861
&gt;&gt; One of the most urgent
problems facing America,

00:13:48.927 --> 00:13:50.128
its increasingly destructive
trade relationship

00:13:50.195 --> 00:13:54.165
with a rapidly rising China.

00:13:54.232 --> 00:13:56.068
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The two camps
disagreed sharply

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:59.437
over whether aggressive measures
like tariffs would help

00:13:59.504 --> 00:14:01.774
or hurt the American economy.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.976
&gt;&gt; We had a mindset that to be a
great power,

00:14:05.043 --> 00:14:06.645
you know, it wasn't just
your military.

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:08.514
You had to be a great economic
power.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:11.016
And a great power had to be
built upon,

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.084
had to be built upon
a great manufacturing base.

00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:15.587
To "make America great again,"

00:14:15.654 --> 00:14:17.122
you've got to bring
manufacturing back

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:18.724
to the country.

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.692
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Some of the people
that are very pro-tariff

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:23.261
right now make an argument that
the United States has lost

00:14:23.328 --> 00:14:25.664
its manufacturing base,

00:14:25.731 --> 00:14:29.534
and that this is actually real
people's lives at stake here.

00:14:29.601 --> 00:14:32.237 line:0%
&gt;&gt; Well, the data would show

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:35.374 line:0%
manufacturing jobs have gone
down in the United States,

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.776 line:0%
so I understand where they're
saying there.

00:14:37.842 --> 00:14:41.013
The flip side is,
factory output,

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.515
or what we produce in the United
States, has actually gone up.

00:14:43.582 --> 00:14:46.351
There's this thing called
technology

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:48.787
that's happened
in the United States.

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:50.488
Factories have changed.

00:14:50.555 --> 00:14:54.626
But we have also created
millions upon millions of jobs

00:14:54.693 --> 00:14:57.996
in new industries that didn't
exist 20 years ago.

00:14:58.063 --> 00:15:00.665
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: The split between
globalists and nationalists

00:15:00.732 --> 00:15:03.802
was about more than just
industrial policy.

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:06.271
It reflected a fundamental
difference

00:15:06.337 --> 00:15:09.708
over how best to confront China
and what each saw

00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:11.176
as the endgame.

00:15:11.243 --> 00:15:14.146
&gt;&gt; The nationalists said,
"This is a great hegemonic,

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:16.115
you know, great-power struggle."

00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:18.817
It's definitely two systems that
couldn't be more

00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:20.352
radically different, right,

00:15:20.419 --> 00:15:22.520
and, and one of these
two are going to win.

00:15:22.587 --> 00:15:24.055
We need not just a trade deal,

00:15:24.122 --> 00:15:27.626
we need fundamental structural
changes in your economy.

00:15:27.693 --> 00:15:29.127
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Some of your former
colleagues have sat

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:31.063
exactly where you are and said,

00:15:31.129 --> 00:15:33.231
"This is a winner-takes-all
situation."

00:15:33.298 --> 00:15:34.766
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I, I understand that,

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:36.868

As a globalist,
as a market practitioner,

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:45.077

00:15:45.143 --> 00:15:49.047
a globalized world
that works well.

00:15:49.114 --> 00:15:53.484
The question is, "Can we both be
complementary to each other?"

00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:55.587
I think the answer is yes.

00:15:55.653 --> 00:15:57.689
&gt;&gt; These arguments would get
quite personal.

00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:59.391
We would get through
the facts quickly,

00:15:59.458 --> 00:16:00.559

never going

00:16:00.626 --> 00:16:01.994

It's my job to get rid of the

aggressively pursuing

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:24.334
next-generation technology,

00:48:24.401 --> 00:48:27.637
the talk in Lordstown that day
was how this plant could be

00:48:27.704 --> 00:48:30.908
transformed to keep
the U.S. competitive.

00:48:30.974 --> 00:48:32.975
&gt;&gt; My personal hope
is that General Motors,

00:48:33.042 --> 00:48:37.713
which is investing billions
of dollars in all-electric,

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:42.252
emission-free, green cars, will
decide to build them right here.

(car horn honking)

00:48:43.719 --> 00:48:46.456
&gt;&gt; We've got to fix our system
to compete with China.

00:48:46.523 --> 00:48:48.425
We've got to internalize some of
this blame

00:48:48.491 --> 00:48:50.760
and not spend all our time
blaming it on China.

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.529
They've outsmarted us, they've
done some things

00:48:52.595 --> 00:48:54.798
that we don't agree with,
they've done some things

00:48:54.865 --> 00:48:56.432
against the agreements
they've made,

00:48:56.499 --> 00:48:58.301
but they're focused
and moving ahead.

00:48:58.368 --> 00:49:00.036
&gt;&gt; China has a plan.

00:49:00.103 --> 00:49:02.472 line:0%
They got a ten-year, a 20-year,
a 50-year plan.

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:05.642 line:0%

serious about this in,

00:49:05.709 --> 00:49:07.477 line:0%

in terms of manufacturing,

and make sure that our
government is supportive.

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.718
&gt;&gt; We didn't do
what China's doing.

00:49:15.785 --> 00:49:17.521
We didn't look at, "Where are
the industries of the future?

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:19.956
Where do... what kind of

the Chinese system

actually has an advantage now.

00:49:36.272 --> 00:49:38.508
President Trump has been upping
the pressure

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:40.577
to get an agreement
on at least some

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.380

certain tariffs...

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:06.269
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: Despite challenges,
he says a deal is possible.

00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:08.371
&gt;&gt; This is the granddaddy of
them all,

00:50:08.438 --> 00:50:10.474

But whether a deal is made,

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:14.777
Trump's trade war has heightened
the economic conflict.

00:50:14.844 --> 00:50:18.814
&gt;&gt; I think I'll quote
my Chinese friends...

00:50:18.881 --> 00:50:22.385
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: And the specter of
a prolonged rivalry looms large.

00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:26.689
What does Trump want from China?

00:50:26.756 --> 00:50:28.558

00:50:36.967 --> 00:50:39.536
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: How on Earth...
&gt;&gt; I think the goal

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:41.705
into China is quite simply,
is to bring them...

00:50:41.771 --> 00:50:44.674
is to break the back
of this totalitarian

00:50:44.741 --> 00:50:47.277
mercantilist economic society...

00:50:47.344 --> 00:50:49.813
&gt;&gt; SULLIVAN: You're talking
about regime change.

00:50:49.879 --> 00:50:52.949
&gt;&gt; Well, first off,
nobody in the White House

00:50:53.016 --> 00:50:54.617
is talking about that, okay?

00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:56.686
And the president would never
even consider that.

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:57.853
They're talking about a trade
deal

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.556
and some fundamental economic
change.

00:50:59.622 --> 00:51:01.457
I'm saying, one of these two are
going to...

00:51:01.524 --> 00:51:03.526
this, either, this,
this mercantilist,

00:51:03.593 --> 00:51:06.296
totalitarian system that
has a network effect,

00:51:06.362 --> 00:51:09.432
or the kind of, you know,
liberal, democratic West.

00:51:09.499 --> 00:51:11.534
One of those two systems is
going to be the system

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.003
at the end of the day.

&gt;&gt; The arrest of a top executive
at Chinese telecom...

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:23.646

States ramping things up

against Huawei.

a hot-button issue.

fought against China.

00:51:32.521 --> 00:51:35.191

scenario,

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:39.195
that we will have
a managed tension.

00:51:39.262 --> 00:51:43.934
But we do have the, uh,
pessimistic scenario.

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:46.636
We do have a chance to see
a so-called...

00:51:46.703 --> 00:51:50.106
I don't like the term,
but the new cold war.

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:54.010
I don't think like the one
the U.S. had with the USSR.

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:57.613
But we will have another type of
cold war

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.416
that nobody have ever
experienced.

00:52:00.483 --> 00:52:04.053
But I think it's a comprehensive
confrontation.

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.822
That's dangerous.

00:52:05.888 --> 00:52:08.958
