00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:02.301
-Welcome back to the show, sir.
-Happy to be back.

00:00:02.334 --> 00:00:04.904
Interesting. You were
the third guest on my show.

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:08.141
-I was. -You were also one
of the only...

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:10.977
In fact,
you are the only Republican

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.845
who supports Trump

00:00:12.878 --> 00:00:15.715
who's come back to the show
post Trump winning.

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:18.017
-Huge bravery.
-(laughter)

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.019
-So brave, Chris. So brave.
-So brave...

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:21.988
You also got nothing to lose,
which helps.

00:00:22.021 --> 00:00:23.556
Well, you know, listen, it's...

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.959
-(laughter)
-(Christie giggles)

00:00:26.992 --> 00:00:29.062
You know, sometimes that's when
you're bravest, Trevor.

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.830
-You know? All right. -That is
when you're bravest, right?

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:32.031
Right. Never know.

00:00:32.064 --> 00:00:33.633
How-how do you feel
about these Republicans

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:35.701
who seem to be pro Trump
or with him,

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:37.637
and then, when they're leaving,
all of a sudden, they're like,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.639
"He is the worst thing
in the world."? And...

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.674
It seems like bravery does
happen when the people leave.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.943 line:0%
Uh, yeah, when, you know,
you don't have to look at him

00:00:43.976 --> 00:00:45.478 line:0%
-every day or something,
I guess. -Right.

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.647 line:0%
I guess that's probably it.
Um, but, you know,

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.382 line:0%
they were brave
in the beginning, you know,

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:52.018 line:0%
and-and what they're doing now
is just faux bravery, so...

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:53.786
-Oh. That's interesting.
-That's the way it goes.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:57.490
Hurricane Sandy was for you
one of the most seminal moments

00:00:57.523 --> 00:00:59.258
in your life
and-and your career.

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:01.727
Um, it's interesting
because you went

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.530
on this roller-coaster ride
of approval ratings.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:07.366
Hurricane Sandy,
around that time, people said

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.503
Chris Christie could be the next
president of the United States.

00:01:10.536 --> 00:01:12.305
-I recall that.
-Yeah.

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:16.142
And then, a while later, like,
this picture was one of those

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.544
that made you one
of the most hated men

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:20.046
-in the United States.
-Yeah.

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.414
When, like,
a beach was shut down,

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:22.982
and there was, you know,
a shutdown,

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:24.851
-and you were out on the beach
with your family. -Yeah.

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:26.185
-Mm-hmm.
-What was that like?

00:01:26.218 --> 00:01:27.787
Just genuinely, from your side
as a human being,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.589
going from, like,
everyone loving to... you

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.023
to feeling like
everyone hates you?

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:33.025
-Trying to make me cry?
-(laughter)

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:35.361
-No, no, but, I mean, seriously.
-No. No. I mean, listen.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.131
Seriously, like,
that's-that's often

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.632
what political life is like.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:42.168
You know, very rarely is there
somebody in political life

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:44.370
who does anything
that's worth anything...

00:01:44.403 --> 00:01:46.539
-Right. -...that remains popular
all the way through.

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:49.275
Because if you're doing stuff
that matters

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:50.676
and stuff that needs to be done

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.211
in your state
or in this country,

00:01:52.244 --> 00:01:54.213
you're gonna anger some people.
You have to.

00:01:54.246 --> 00:01:56.449
Because, unless you're just
giving everything away,

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:58.351
unless you're just saying "yes"
to everybody

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.685
even if you don't mean it,

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:01.420
you're gonna make some people
angry.

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:05.324
-Um, and so, you know, to me,
like, it's never fun. -Mm-hmm.

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:09.128
-Like, you always would much
rather be 75% than 15%. -Right.

00:02:09.161 --> 00:02:12.131
But in the end,
does it really matter?

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:14.901
Like, to me,
what matters is what you did

00:02:14.934 --> 00:02:16.435
and what you accomplished.

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:18.738
And so, for me, that's what
always mattered the most.

00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:20.072
No one likes it.

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:21.974
Anybody who says
they like being unpopular

00:02:22.007 --> 00:02:23.976
at times is just
completely full of it.

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.845
I didn't like it,
but I also tried

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:27.246
to have some perspective on it.

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:29.348
That wasn't why I did it
in the first place anyway,

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:30.616
-was to be popular.
-Mm-hmm.

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:33.452
And I used to tell my folks
when we were at 75%,

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:35.454
like, we're not keeping this
in the desk drawer,

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:37.823
like, just looking at it, go,
"Look how pretty that 75% is."

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:39.325
Let's go spend it.

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:41.594
Let's go do the difficult things
that'll bring that down,

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:43.763
and then you got
to live with it.

00:02:43.796 --> 00:02:45.331
-You've written a book.
-Yeah.

00:02:45.364 --> 00:02:47.733
 Let Me Finish: Trump, the
 Kushners, Bannon, New Jersey,

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:49.535
 and the Power
 of In-Your-Face Politics.

00:02:49.568 --> 00:02:51.737
You take us through
a little bit of how you began,

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.573
a little bit of your life,
the journey that made you

00:02:53.606 --> 00:02:55.041
into Chris Christie
as people know you.

00:02:55.074 --> 00:02:56.809
And then really you get
into the meat

00:02:56.842 --> 00:03:00.880
of the presidential campaign,
from you announcing,

00:03:00.913 --> 00:03:02.181
from you going into the race,

00:03:02.214 --> 00:03:04.083
all the way through
to dropping out.

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:06.586
-And then, the story
with Donald Trump. -Right.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.487
-Let's start at the beginning
of this journey... -Yeah.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.524
...when you were running
and Donald Trump was running.

00:03:11.557 --> 00:03:13.459
You-you guys had been friends
for a while.

00:03:13.492 --> 00:03:16.896
Yeah, at that time, we had been
friends for about 14 years.

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:18.598
Did you think he stood a chance?

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.199
-No.
-Why not?

00:03:20.232 --> 00:03:22.201
I thought
the whole thing was a joke.

00:03:22.234 --> 00:03:25.137
At the time. I really did.
I mean, you know, he had been

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.506
talking about running
for president for a long time.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.575
-Right.
-I mean, going back 20 years.

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:31.410
And so, when he finally...

00:03:31.443 --> 00:03:35.114
Look, he was getting older,
and when he finally declared,

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:36.616
-I thought to myself, "Well,
he's not gonna stay in."

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:37.950
-Uh-huh. -I mean,
this is gonna be something

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:39.385
where he's gonna do it
for a little while,

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:41.487
gets into a debate or two,
experience it,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.856
and then go, "Aah, I don't need
this. I'm gonna go away."

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.158
So, the whole premise of me,
and not just me, but most

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:48.561
-of the other men and women that
were up on the stage... -Yes.

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:50.930
...was like, "All right,
he's getting some attention now,

00:03:50.963 --> 00:03:52.832
but he can't be serious
about this."

00:03:52.865 --> 00:03:55.334
Is-is that why you guys didn't
work as hard to attack him?

00:03:55.367 --> 00:03:57.670
It felt like everyone was
leaving him, and was just like,

00:03:57.703 --> 00:03:59.205
"Ah, forget him. He's fun."

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:00.573
You know what it really was?

00:04:00.606 --> 00:04:03.042
Part of the problem was
there were so many of us.

00:04:03.075 --> 00:04:06.979
And he had so much, uh,
popularity in the polls early...

00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:08.814
-Yes.
-...that all the rest of us,

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:10.283
there was just a little bit left
for everybody.

00:04:10.316 --> 00:04:11.851
So, you remember, when
people would go to attack him...

00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:13.486
Like, Rand Paul, went
to attack him, one thing.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.221
And he'd look at him, and
he'd go, "You're at two percent.

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:16.422
"You're nothing,
You're never gonna win.

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:17.757
-Leave me alone." Right?
-Yes. Yes.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:18.991
-Or... -"You shouldn't even be
on the stage."

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:20.359
"You shouldn't be on the stage.
Who are you?"

00:04:20.392 --> 00:04:21.527
-Yes.
-That kind of thing.

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.262
And-and everybody
saw that happening,

00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:25.264
and the media
would react to that

00:04:25.297 --> 00:04:28.167
and play it over and over again,
so it would be like

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.269
you're getting-getting, you
know, sand kicked in your face,

00:04:30.302 --> 00:04:32.538
not just once,
but, like, a hundred times.

00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:34.774
And so people said:
Well, let's wait.

00:04:34.807 --> 00:04:36.575
The strategy of everybody was:

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:39.045
Let's wait till we're down
to the last few,

00:04:39.078 --> 00:04:41.047
-and then we'll go after him.
-Uh-huh.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.748
But when you saw that happening,

00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:46.018
when you saw Trump becoming
a viable candidate, it...

00:04:46.051 --> 00:04:47.920
the race changed quite a bit.

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:49.955
Did it change your friendship?

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:52.058
You know, interestingly, no,
because we never...

00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.360
except for one instance
that I detail in the book...

00:04:54.393 --> 00:04:56.962
-Right. What is that instance?
-Well, that instance was,

00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:59.165
I got the endorsement
of the Manchester Union Leader

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:01.667
in New Hampshire,
which is the biggest newspaper

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.470
in New Hampshire, and the
biggest to get in the primary.

00:05:04.503 --> 00:05:06.472
-And he was really pissed.
-Right.

00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:09.075
And so he was in South Carolina
when it happened, and he...

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:11.444
and then he gives some speech
saying that, "Oh, you know,

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:12.812
"Bridgegate,
he knew all about it.

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:14.447
-Right.
-"I know he knew about it.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.248
"He had breakfast
with these people every morning.

00:05:16.281 --> 00:05:18.651
What were they talking about?"
It was all made up.

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:20.486
-Right? All made up.
-But how does that...

00:05:20.519 --> 00:05:23.089
how do you still stay friends
with somebody who's accusing you

00:05:23.122 --> 00:05:25.591
of being part of something
that is a crime?

00:05:25.624 --> 00:05:28.394
Well, part of what...
part of it is politics.

00:05:28.427 --> 00:05:30.229
Right? I mean,
people accuse people

00:05:30.262 --> 00:05:31.797
of everything
in politics sometimes,

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.200
and if you break
every relationship you have

00:05:34.233 --> 00:05:36.202
with someone who says
something bad about you,

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.270
you're gonna be eating dinner
alone in politics,

00:05:38.303 --> 00:05:39.605
'cause it's a nasty game.

00:05:39.638 --> 00:05:41.807
But also what happened was,
when he did that,

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.242
then I went after him.

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:45.711
-So, I was in Iowa
when he did that. -Yes.

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:47.913
That night, I went after him,
and I said: Listen,

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:50.449
Donald Trump said a whole bunch
of lies about me today.

00:05:50.482 --> 00:05:52.284
Let me tell you the truth.

00:05:52.317 --> 00:05:53.953
We're... we don't need a wall.

00:05:53.986 --> 00:05:56.055
-Uh-huh.
-We're never gonna build a wall,

00:05:56.088 --> 00:05:57.456
even if he's elected.

00:05:57.489 --> 00:06:00.226
And if we ever did build a wall,
I can guarantee you one thing--

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.294
-Mexico ain't ever
gonna pay for it. -Right.

00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:04.830
-And, you know... -Do you still
believe all of those things?

00:06:04.863 --> 00:06:07.299
Listen, it-it looks like
I was right. Um...

00:06:07.332 --> 00:06:08.667
-(laughter)
-No, but do you still...

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.369
do you still believe
all of those things?

00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:12.405
Yeah. I mean, yeah.
That's what I ran on.

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:14.573
I don't think... I don't think
we need those things.

00:06:14.606 --> 00:06:16.575
Um, do we need some more
security at the border?

00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:18.778
Of course we do. And I think
everybody agrees on that.

00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:21.580
-Right. -Um, but did we need
what he was talking about then?

00:06:21.613 --> 00:06:23.416
-Which was a concrete wall
-Yes.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:25.418
from one end of the border
to the other.

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.386
No. And-and I said that
at the time.

00:06:27.419 --> 00:06:29.188
-Right. -And now he
doesn't even say anymore

00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:31.257
-that that's what we need.
-Now he says a fence.

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:33.159
-A fence-wall. -Right,
a fence or... or steel slats

00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:35.161
or something like that.
But... but the point was...

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:36.929
-More like a stern warning.
-when-- right--

00:06:36.962 --> 00:06:39.665
when I went after him,
the next morning,

00:06:39.698 --> 00:06:41.767
Corey Lewandowski, who was
campaign manager at the time,

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.836
called my campaign,
and actually said, "Listen,

00:06:43.869 --> 00:06:45.404
"Donald's really, um, sorry.

00:06:45.437 --> 00:06:47.406
"He didn't mean
to say any of that.

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:49.975
"He knows it was wrong.
He knows that that wasn't true.

00:06:50.008 --> 00:06:51.410
And he wants a truce."

00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:54.713
And so I said to my guy, "If
he wants a truce, he calls me."

00:06:54.746 --> 00:06:56.982
And so he called me,
and he admitted...

00:06:57.015 --> 00:06:59.518
he never... he didn't mean it,
he knew it wasn't true,

00:06:59.551 --> 00:07:01.387
he was just angry,
and he apologized.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.190
So, let me ask you this, then.
You get to that point

00:07:04.223 --> 00:07:05.724
-where you've now...
-And then he

00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:07.793
didn't say anything anymore,
by the way, that was it.

00:07:07.826 --> 00:07:10.129
Right, there's been a truce.
But then you were

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:12.798
the first prominent Republican
to stand behind Donald Trump.

00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:15.167
Like, I will never forget,
there was this debate

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.236
that we watched together where,
out of nowhere--

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:19.004
it was like watching
the Royal Rumble--

00:07:19.037 --> 00:07:20.706
we thought you
would be going after him,

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:22.842
and then you just kicked
Marco Rubio in the jaw,

00:07:22.875 --> 00:07:24.877
basically took him
out of the race,

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.879
-Yeah.
-and you-you backed Trump.

00:07:26.912 --> 00:07:28.981
You-you backed him... -Well,
that happened after it, yeah.

00:07:29.014 --> 00:07:30.416
Right, but I'm saying,
you backed him--

00:07:30.449 --> 00:07:31.917
did you genuinely believe
at that time

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.153
that this man was the best man
to be president

00:07:34.186 --> 00:07:35.955
-of the United States?
-Here's what I believed.

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:37.456
I believed
that he was gonna win,

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:39.191
that he was gonna win
the Republican nomination

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:40.759
He had come in second place
in Iowa...

00:07:40.792 --> 00:07:42.595
But did you believe
that he deserved to win?

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:45.064
Well, I... No,
I thought I deserved to win.

00:07:45.097 --> 00:07:47.333
-(laughter)
-Hey. Hey, like...

00:07:49.134 --> 00:07:51.737
-Touché.
-Right? All right, so, you know,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.473
'cause I get asked this question
a lot, for obvious reasons,

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.242
and I go, "Let's be clear here.

00:07:56.275 --> 00:07:59.445
He was not my first choice
for president. I was." Right?

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:01.380
So... but then I was trying
to be practical.

00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:04.183
I looked at it, I said:
None of the rest of these guys

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:06.252
on the stage are gonna beat him,
they're just not.

00:08:06.285 --> 00:08:08.120
After he came in second place
in Iowa...

00:08:08.153 --> 00:08:11.190
But you... but you were part
of that prophecy.

00:08:11.223 --> 00:08:12.658
No, it was over by then.

00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:15.895
When he won New Hampshire and
South Carolina by double digits,

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:18.664
-Yes.
-in fields of 12, 13 people,

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:20.332
it's over, it's just over.

00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:23.002
I knew it was over,
and I sat there with my wife

00:08:23.035 --> 00:08:24.370
on the couch
watching South Carolina,

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.405
and I said: Listen,
we've been friends with this guy

00:08:26.438 --> 00:08:28.607
for 14 years--
he's gonna be the nominee.

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.943
We got two choices:
either stay on the sidelines

00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:33.379
or support him and try
to make him a better candidate.

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:35.581
And I thought
I could talk to him in ways

00:08:35.614 --> 00:08:37.216
that nobody else
could talk to him

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:38.884
because of the 14-year
friendship.

00:08:38.917 --> 00:08:40.452
That... Like, for instance,

00:08:40.485 --> 00:08:42.688
when he was doing all the stuff
with Judge Curiel,

00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:45.024
-Yes. -I was the guy
who got called in,

00:08:45.057 --> 00:08:47.626
by his family,
to talk to him and say,

00:08:47.659 --> 00:08:49.228
-"You have to stop this.
-Right.

00:08:49.261 --> 00:08:51.764
"It's not right. It's not right
to go after this judge

00:08:51.797 --> 00:08:53.933
"because he's
a Mexican-American.

00:08:53.966 --> 00:08:56.135
"Stop it. Put out a statement
saying you're gonna stop

00:08:56.168 --> 00:08:57.803
and don't do it anymore."

00:08:57.836 --> 00:08:59.471
And I got called in to do that,
and I did it.

00:08:59.504 --> 00:09:01.140
And I convinced him
to put out a statement

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:03.108
saying he wouldn't do it anymore
and he didn't do it anymore.

00:09:03.141 --> 00:09:04.643
So it's interesting you say
you wanted this man

00:09:04.676 --> 00:09:06.612
to be a better candidate, and
you thought you could help him.

00:09:06.645 --> 00:09:09.214
-Yep.
-The book is really engaging.

00:09:09.247 --> 00:09:10.916
And it's an interesting insight
into the world

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:13.586
that you have and Trump has
and the people around him have.

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.588
Especially when it comes
to the Kushners.

00:09:15.621 --> 00:09:17.790
-'Cause the way you lay it out
in the book, -Yeah.

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:19.792
you make it sound like
Jared Kushner

00:09:19.825 --> 00:09:22.728
has the power
in the White House.

00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:24.897
-I mean, you... -Well, he is,
he is the most powerful person

00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:26.966
in the White House
next to the president.

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:30.002
And you argue
that you didn't get the job

00:09:30.035 --> 00:09:32.404
as vice president
because of Jared Kushner.

00:09:32.437 --> 00:09:34.239
Sure, that's exactly why.

00:09:34.272 --> 00:09:36.909
Listen, the Wednesday night
before the president--

00:09:36.942 --> 00:09:39.979
the now president-- announced
his running mate on a Friday,

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:42.114
I was in Washington D.C. working
on the transition.

00:09:42.147 --> 00:09:43.949
He called me, that night
on the phone, he said,

00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:45.985
"Are you ready?" I said
"Am I ready for what?"

00:09:46.018 --> 00:09:48.087
He goes, "You know what I'm
talking about. Are you ready?"

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.222
And I said, "Well, if you ask,
I'm ready."

00:09:50.255 --> 00:09:51.924
And he said,
"Well, talk to Mary Pat.

00:09:51.957 --> 00:09:55.494
Make sure she's okay. I'm gonna
make my announcement tomorrow."

00:09:55.527 --> 00:09:57.429
Now, I don't know, Trevor.

00:09:57.462 --> 00:10:00.499
-(laughs) That sounds, to me,
like it's gonna be me. -Right.

00:10:00.532 --> 00:10:02.334
-Um...
-(laughter)

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:05.604
And then, about two hours later,

00:10:05.637 --> 00:10:09.074
a high-level staff person on
the campaign that was with him,

00:10:09.107 --> 00:10:11.610
called me and said,
"He just called the family

00:10:11.643 --> 00:10:13.545
"and told them
that it's gonna be you.

00:10:13.578 --> 00:10:16.582
"And Jared and Ivanka have said
they're getting on a plane

00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:19.318
"at 6:00 a.m. to Indianapolis
to come and talk to him

00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:21.620
and tell him he's got
to go see Mike Pence again."

00:10:21.653 --> 00:10:24.556
So I don't know if it was Jared
who made sure

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:26.992
that I wasn't vice president,
but then they went to see Pence,

00:10:27.025 --> 00:10:29.461
-and then I didn't get it, so...
-Right. So, so, so...

00:10:29.494 --> 00:10:31.096
-So let's look at that part
in the book, -Yeah.

00:10:31.129 --> 00:10:32.698
'cause this is really
fascinating where you talk

00:10:32.731 --> 00:10:34.433
about this moment between
the two of you.

00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:36.168
There's a lot of tension
that's happening here.

00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:39.271
Jared comes to you at one point
and, basically, says to you,

00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:41.674
to your face, he says,
"This is, basically,

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:43.742
-for what you have done
to my father." -Right.

00:10:43.775 --> 00:10:45.744
Because you were,
basically, responsible

00:10:45.777 --> 00:10:48.047
-for putting his father in jail.
-No, let's be clear.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.082
His father was responsible
for going to jail.

00:10:50.115 --> 00:10:52.084
(applause)

00:10:52.117 --> 00:10:53.719
No, putting him in jail.

00:10:53.752 --> 00:10:55.254
-W-What he did...
-He-- Yes.

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:56.955
-What he did put him in jail.
-Semantics. Yes. I'm...

00:10:56.988 --> 00:10:58.557
-No, not semantics,
really important. -Right.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:00.059
Because when you say--
When someone says

00:11:00.092 --> 00:11:01.627
a prosecutor
puts someone in jail--

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:03.128
-I did my job.
-Right.

00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:06.065
My job is when people break
the law in my state,

00:11:06.098 --> 00:11:07.866
and I have the evidence beyond

00:11:07.899 --> 00:11:10.536
a reasonable doubt that
they did, then they go to jail.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:12.504
Whether they're the richest guy
in the state,

00:11:12.537 --> 00:11:14.440
-which is what he was
at the time, -Mm-hmm.

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:16.575
or whether they're
a low-level drug dealer,

00:11:16.608 --> 00:11:18.744
you know, who committed a crime
and killed somebody,

00:11:18.777 --> 00:11:20.546
-they go to jail.
-So you think it was--

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:23.248
You think it was him
enacting his vendetta.

00:11:23.281 --> 00:11:24.983
He was saying, "You're not
gonna be vice president

00:11:25.016 --> 00:11:26.652
'cause of what you did
to my dad."

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.454
(stammers) Listen, that's not
when he had the talk with me.

00:11:28.487 --> 00:11:30.055
It was earlier than that.

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:31.890
When Trump was making me
the chairman of the transition,

00:11:31.923 --> 00:11:33.525
-which was in May,
-Yes.

00:11:33.558 --> 00:11:35.828
he came in to Trump's office
uninvited,

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:39.732
and made the argument, in front
of me, to his father-in-law,

00:11:39.765 --> 00:11:42.234
that I couldn't be chairman
of the transition

00:11:42.267 --> 00:11:44.136
because I was untrustworthy,

00:11:44.169 --> 00:11:46.538
because I had pursued
his father and put him in jail,

00:11:46.571 --> 00:11:48.574
and that that was
a family matter

00:11:48.607 --> 00:11:50.542
that should have been resolved
by the rabbis,

00:11:50.575 --> 00:11:52.444
and not by a prosecutor.

00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:55.013
Do you think that
you would have been...

00:11:55.046 --> 00:11:57.449
-Yeah. I-I reacted the same way,
by the way. -(laughter)

00:11:57.482 --> 00:12:00.519
Do you... Do you think-- 'Cause
if you asked it the other way,

00:12:00.552 --> 00:12:03.188
do you find, like, Jared
and them would have said,

00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:06.191
"Oh, no, but, you know,
Mike Pence was a better VP,"

00:12:06.224 --> 00:12:09.194
because Trump was so, you know,

00:12:09.227 --> 00:12:11.897
just so caught up in
all of his scandals--

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.500
the pussy tape, etc., you wanted
someone next to him who was...

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:16.168
Remember, they didn't know
about that tape then.

00:12:16.201 --> 00:12:17.703
Right. But I'm saying,
they wanted somebody

00:12:17.736 --> 00:12:19.905
who was the squeaky clean
Bible guy, and they were like,

00:12:19.938 --> 00:12:21.707
"Oh, maybe Chris Christie's
not the right VP

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.375
to have next to Trump,
look at Bridgegate."

00:12:23.408 --> 00:12:25.778
Well, I'm-I'm definitely not
the Bible guy, but, but...

00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:29.081
I'm from New Jersey, but...

00:12:29.114 --> 00:12:32.050
But nonetheless, like,
the point is,

00:12:32.083 --> 00:12:34.286
-that should be
the president's choice, -Yes.

00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:37.022
and it shouldn't have to worry
about me having--

00:12:37.055 --> 00:12:38.957
And Trump said it that day
in the meeting,

00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:40.726
because he made me chairman
of the transition.

00:12:40.759 --> 00:12:43.862
And he said to Jared, "You can't
blame him for doing his job.

00:12:43.895 --> 00:12:45.831
He was just doing his job."

00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:48.700
And let me remind you
what this guy did.

00:12:48.733 --> 00:12:51.003
I mean, besides tax evasion

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:53.338
and violating
fair election laws,

00:12:53.371 --> 00:12:55.140
when he found out
we were investigating him,

00:12:55.173 --> 00:12:57.509
and that his sister had been
called to the grand jury,

00:12:57.542 --> 00:12:59.912
'cause she was part owner
of the company,

00:12:59.945 --> 00:13:02.147
he sent-- he hired a prostitute

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:05.150
to go after
his sister's husband,

00:13:05.183 --> 00:13:08.187
seduce his sister's husband,
videotape it,

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.390
and then he took the videotape
and sent it to his own sister

00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:14.193
on the day of her son's
engagement party

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:16.161
to intimidate her
from going and speaking

00:13:16.194 --> 00:13:17.896
in front of the grand jury.

00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:20.732
Now, listen, I know some
families have problems...

00:13:20.765 --> 00:13:22.568
(laughter)

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:24.303
But... And-and my family

00:13:24.336 --> 00:13:25.571
has been one that's,
like, you know...

00:13:25.604 --> 00:13:27.573
We-we talk, and we're...
and we're...

00:13:27.606 --> 00:13:29.341
-We'll battle with each other,
all right? -Right.

00:13:29.374 --> 00:13:32.010
I never hired a hooker, right,

00:13:32.043 --> 00:13:35.214
-to go and videotape it and send
it to my sister. -That-that...

00:13:35.247 --> 00:13:39.151
I mean, so, we're not talking
about, oh, you know,

00:13:39.184 --> 00:13:40.419
-a parking ticket.
-Yes.

00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:42.554
And my point to Jared

00:13:42.587 --> 00:13:45.257
and to anybody who's
ever asked me about this is,

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:47.359
you know,
when you do something like that,

00:13:47.392 --> 00:13:49.094
you have to be held accountable.

00:13:49.127 --> 00:13:51.864
And by the way, it wasn't a jury
that found him guilty.

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:53.065
He pled guilty.

00:13:53.098 --> 00:13:56.268
-He admitted guilt to 18 counts.
-Right.

00:13:56.301 --> 00:13:58.537
-So, my point is, like,
you've got to let... -So...

00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.972
I understand it's his father.

00:14:00.005 --> 00:14:01.907
-Nobody would want their father
to go to jail. -Uh-huh.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.041
I totally understand that.

00:14:03.074 --> 00:14:04.910
But at some point
as you get older,

00:14:04.943 --> 00:14:08.180
you've got to understand that,
"Well, I'm an adult now.

00:14:08.213 --> 00:14:09.748
"My father
has to take responsibility

00:14:09.781 --> 00:14:11.884
"for his own conduct,
and I can't blame the guy

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:13.619
who was just doing his job."

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:15.320
Let's talk about the transition
before I let you go.

00:14:15.353 --> 00:14:16.889
-Yeah. -Because this is
one of the parts of the book

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:19.091
that I genuinely
was-was engrossed by.

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:22.327
You talk about how you spent
a really long time

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:24.663
compiling a giant dossier

00:14:24.696 --> 00:14:26.999
of, like, what
your transition team would be,

00:14:27.032 --> 00:14:29.101
-what Trump's transition
should look like. -Yep.

00:14:29.134 --> 00:14:31.670
-All the people who would help
him to become president. -Yep.

00:14:31.703 --> 00:14:34.673
-You then get kicked off
the transition team. -Yep.

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:36.508
-They throw away
all of your work. -Yeah.

00:14:36.541 --> 00:14:40.379
-And, as we saw, the transition
was a disaster, right? -Total.

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:44.316
Do you think that you
could have helped Donald Trump

00:14:44.349 --> 00:14:47.753
to become presidential,

00:14:47.786 --> 00:14:49.788
the thing that people
have been searching for

00:14:49.821 --> 00:14:51.990
-from the very beginning?
-Well, I don't know about that.

00:14:52.023 --> 00:14:54.927
Um, but I think
what-what we could have done

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.395
was gotten him off
to a much better start

00:14:56.428 --> 00:14:58.964
and-and put more good people
around him.

00:14:58.997 --> 00:15:00.999
You know,
there's that old saying, right?

00:15:01.032 --> 00:15:02.501
-Garbage in, garbage out.
-Yes.

00:15:02.534 --> 00:15:04.703
Right? So if you have
a bunch of people around you

00:15:04.736 --> 00:15:06.605
-who are not good,
-Mm-hmm.

00:15:06.638 --> 00:15:09.508
it significantly decreases
your ability to be good.

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:11.176
But let me ask you this.
You say in the book...

00:15:11.209 --> 00:15:12.444
This was interesting,
'cause in the book,

00:15:12.477 --> 00:15:13.979
there's a passage where you talk
about Trump,

00:15:14.012 --> 00:15:16.615
and you say he's not
a good judge of character,

00:15:16.648 --> 00:15:18.717
or he makes...
or he makes, um, rash decisions.

00:15:18.750 --> 00:15:19.785
-You say he's very impulsive.
-Impulsive.

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:21.086
-Yes, impulsive.
-Impulsive, yeah.

00:15:21.119 --> 00:15:22.487
And you say he surrounds himself

00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:25.424
with guys who are, you know,
con men and people who are shady

00:15:25.457 --> 00:15:27.893
and people who are just not,
you know,

00:15:27.926 --> 00:15:29.394
-the right people to be around.
-Some of them aren't.

00:15:29.427 --> 00:15:30.762
-Right, right, right.
-Right, some of them aren't.

00:15:30.795 --> 00:15:32.597
But then did you never...
not ask yourself that question,

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.066
like, "Why does he
want me around, then?"

00:15:34.099 --> 00:15:36.034
No. Well, apparently he didn't.

00:15:36.067 --> 00:15:38.603
Uh, but it's not like all
the people around him are bad.

00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:40.172
And it's not like
every decision,

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:42.274
personnel decision he makes
is bad.

00:15:42.307 --> 00:15:45.811
But the problem is that if you
don't have the process set up

00:15:45.844 --> 00:15:47.846
to vet people, right?

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:50.048
-So, they threw all that away.
-Right.

00:15:50.081 --> 00:15:53.051
And, so, you know, they were,
like, vetting people on Google.

00:15:53.084 --> 00:15:55.787
I mean,
and-and you can't do that

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.923
because what happens
is you miss things.

00:15:57.956 --> 00:16:01.059
And someone can sit
across from you in a meeting

00:16:01.092 --> 00:16:04.129
-and impress you one day in
an hour or two hours. -Uh-huh.

00:16:04.162 --> 00:16:05.797
And they may seem okay.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.232
And we've all met people
like this.

00:16:07.265 --> 00:16:09.101
And then all of a sudden you
find out other stuff about them.

00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.836
You do a little research.
You go, "Oh, yeah.

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:12.170
That guy's...
that guy's not good."

00:16:12.203 --> 00:16:13.338
-Right.
-And you move on.

00:16:13.371 --> 00:16:15.974
He threw
that entire process away.

00:16:16.007 --> 00:16:18.777
Jared, Steve Bannon,
Rick Dearborn--

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:20.879
those three guys
took 30 volumes.

00:16:20.912 --> 00:16:22.014
It's not just my work.

00:16:22.047 --> 00:16:24.783
We had 140 people,
all volunteers,

00:16:24.816 --> 00:16:27.652
-working from May till November
-Yes.

00:16:27.685 --> 00:16:29.821
to put together 30 binders
of stuff on...

00:16:29.854 --> 00:16:31.323
You know, so they wouldn't
have had to write...

00:16:31.356 --> 00:16:32.824
-On-on... No, I'm with you.
Everyone. -On everything.

00:16:32.857 --> 00:16:34.593
-An executive order on the back
of an envelope -Right.

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.028
that's gonna get
thrown out of court

00:16:36.061 --> 00:16:37.929
-on some kind of travel ban
scam, right? -Right, right.

00:16:37.962 --> 00:16:39.698
I'm with you.
But let me ask you this, then.

00:16:39.731 --> 00:16:42.067
Let me ask you this.
You-You're in a position

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.102
where as Chris Christie, you are
friends with Donald Trump,

00:16:44.135 --> 00:16:45.904
the man who's about to become
president of the United States,

00:16:45.937 --> 00:16:47.839
or has a good chance of becoming
president of the United States.

00:16:47.872 --> 00:16:50.042
You are engaging with him
in debate prep.

00:16:50.075 --> 00:16:51.443
-Yeah.
-You talk about in the book

00:16:51.476 --> 00:16:54.079
where you are out with this man,
and you're playing golf.

00:16:54.112 --> 00:16:56.081
And the reason you're playing
golf is because you realize

00:16:56.114 --> 00:16:58.517
that he does not want
to sit down and read anything,

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.285
so you think you can trick him
into learning things

00:17:00.318 --> 00:17:01.686
before the next debate,
essentially.

00:17:01.719 --> 00:17:03.655
Well, no, not trick him,
but-but...

00:17:03.688 --> 00:17:06.291
What I began to understand
and learn

00:17:06.324 --> 00:17:10.262
was that he learned much better
verbally than he did in writing.

00:17:10.295 --> 00:17:12.631
-So that if we sat and had
a conversation... -(laughter)

00:17:12.664 --> 00:17:14.733
It's true. And then,
you know, some people...

00:17:14.766 --> 00:17:16.134
-And over...
-But at this point...

00:17:16.167 --> 00:17:17.402
And you...
At this point you're like,

00:17:17.435 --> 00:17:19.204
"This man should be the
president of the United States"?

00:17:19.237 --> 00:17:20.605
No, remember... Hold on.

00:17:20.638 --> 00:17:22.441
Remember-remember what I said.

00:17:22.474 --> 00:17:24.509
He was going to be
the Republican nominee.

00:17:24.542 --> 00:17:25.844
He was going to be.

00:17:25.877 --> 00:17:27.245
-That was over.
-Right. So in your head...

00:17:27.278 --> 00:17:28.413
-So...
-In your head, you're going,

00:17:28.446 --> 00:17:29.881
"I have to try to fix this,
basically."

00:17:29.914 --> 00:17:31.483
That's...
I want to make it better.

00:17:31.516 --> 00:17:32.984
-And you thought you could.
-He's gonna be the nominee.

00:17:33.017 --> 00:17:34.486
Well, damn, man,
I wouldn't have done it

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:36.088
-if I didn't think I could.
-Right.

00:17:36.121 --> 00:17:38.223
Right, I wa... Like, this...
I wasn't getting paid.

00:17:38.256 --> 00:17:39.958
Um, and-and I...

00:17:39.991 --> 00:17:42.394
My point was,
I love the country.

00:17:42.427 --> 00:17:44.196
This is gonna be...
This guy's gonna have

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:46.431
-a fifty-fifty shot
to be president. -Right.

00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:49.267
So let's try to make him
as good as we can make him,

00:17:49.300 --> 00:17:51.136
and let's see
if we can make this work.

00:17:51.169 --> 00:17:52.771
And when were you with him
on the golf course,

00:17:52.804 --> 00:17:54.172
you guys are playing,
and between holes,

00:17:54.205 --> 00:17:55.640
-you're trying to brief...
-We weren't playing.

00:17:55.673 --> 00:17:57.042
-You weren't playing. Oh.
-'Cause I don't play.

00:17:57.075 --> 00:17:58.443
-So you're just trying
to brief him between holes. -No.

00:17:58.476 --> 00:18:01.012
What happened was we went
to the golf course for lunch.

00:18:01.045 --> 00:18:02.981
-Yes.
-And I said to him,

00:18:03.014 --> 00:18:06.351
"Listen, we need to talk about
the health care reform stuff.

00:18:06.384 --> 00:18:08.286
-Right. -So where
do you want to do that?"

00:18:08.319 --> 00:18:10.355
And he goes, "Well,
have you ever seen the course?"

00:18:10.388 --> 00:18:11.690
And I said, "No,
I've never seen this course."

00:18:11.723 --> 00:18:13.024
He goes, "Well,
let's get in the golf cart

00:18:13.057 --> 00:18:14.526
and we'll ride around
and we'll talk."

00:18:14.559 --> 00:18:16.261
And what happened--
and that's an interesting part

00:18:16.294 --> 00:18:18.597
of the book-- I started
to try to talk to him about it.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.931
He didn't want to talk about it.

00:18:19.964 --> 00:18:23.001
What he wanted to talk about was
that he was concerned

00:18:23.034 --> 00:18:25.070
that, like,
this might really happen.

00:18:25.103 --> 00:18:26.605
"I-I might win."

00:18:26.638 --> 00:18:28.406
-(laughter)
-And he said-- Yeah.

00:18:28.439 --> 00:18:30.942
And he said to me, like,
"I'm cons..."

00:18:30.975 --> 00:18:33.345
-This is so (bleep) crazy, man.
I'm sorry, man. -Right? Right?

00:18:33.378 --> 00:18:35.013
And he says-- Well, listen,

00:18:35.046 --> 00:18:38.950
I-I think if you-- I think
if you talk to President Obama

00:18:38.983 --> 00:18:42.154
President Bush, 43,
President Clinton,

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:44.956
that there-there comes a moment
when you're running--

00:18:44.989 --> 00:18:46.558
-you want to win--
-Right.

00:18:46.591 --> 00:18:48.059
but then there's a moment
when it goes,

00:18:48.092 --> 00:18:49.394
"Whoa.

00:18:49.427 --> 00:18:51.263
-I may actually win."
-Right.

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.998
I, personally,
never got to that moment.

00:18:53.031 --> 00:18:54.466
But...
(clears throat)

00:18:54.499 --> 00:18:56.468
I wished I'd gotten
to that moment, but I didn't.

00:18:56.501 --> 00:18:57.736
That's a different moment.

00:18:57.769 --> 00:18:59.271
And what he was saying to me
that day was--

00:18:59.304 --> 00:19:02.340
he was talking to me about,
"I've run a family business.

00:19:02.373 --> 00:19:04.609
"I've taken care of my kids.

00:19:04.642 --> 00:19:07.612
-"I'm worried about
what's gonna happen -Uh-huh.

00:19:07.645 --> 00:19:10.482
"when I'm not there every day
and they have to do this.

00:19:10.515 --> 00:19:11.816
"And they're gonna do--

00:19:11.849 --> 00:19:13.985
Are they gonna do well or not?
Is this gonna work?"

00:19:14.018 --> 00:19:15.654
And we sat there talking for--

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:17.389
instead of talking
about health care reform,

00:19:17.422 --> 00:19:20.125
we sat there for about an hour,
riding around this course,

00:19:20.158 --> 00:19:22.527
talking about being a father.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:24.529
-So, when you-- when you...
-And what that--

00:19:24.562 --> 00:19:26.364
and-and what your responsibility
is in public.

00:19:26.397 --> 00:19:27.966
'Cause he had never been
in public life before.

00:19:27.999 --> 00:19:29.801
So he's asking me, like,
"Listen, you've been doing this

00:19:29.834 --> 00:19:32.304
"for a long time. How do you
make time to see your kids?

00:19:32.337 --> 00:19:34.306
"How do you deal with the things
they need from you

00:19:34.339 --> 00:19:36.608
-when you've got this really
important job?" -Uh-huh.

00:19:36.641 --> 00:19:38.476
It's not the kind
of conversation that most people

00:19:38.509 --> 00:19:40.345
think Donald Trump would want--
would be having.

00:19:40.378 --> 00:19:42.347
And that's one of the reasons
I put it in the book.

00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:44.015
It started off as a bad story,

00:19:44.048 --> 00:19:45.684
like he didn't want to talk
about health care reform.

00:19:45.717 --> 00:19:47.686
-Right. -But, in the end,
we talked about something that,

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:49.888
in a personal way,
was-was meaningful

00:19:49.921 --> 00:19:51.423
and-and something that I think

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:53.291
most people wouldn't think
of him.

00:19:53.324 --> 00:19:55.093
And that's one of the reasons
I put it in the book.

00:19:55.126 --> 00:19:58.029
-Because we know all the stuff
we know-- -Yes.

00:19:58.062 --> 00:20:00.031
all the tweeting and the stuff
that you were talking about

00:20:00.064 --> 00:20:02.167
-for the first half hour
of the show. -Right.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.169
But that's something that most
people wouldn't know and that,

00:20:04.202 --> 00:20:06.037
because I was his friend
and around then,

00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:08.840
I had a window into
and I thought was important

00:20:08.873 --> 00:20:11.776
to share with the public so
that they got more information

00:20:11.809 --> 00:20:13.378
about the guy who's sitting
in the Oval Office.

00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:15.046
-So then let me ask you this.
-Yeah.

00:20:15.079 --> 00:20:17.249
If he was to call you today
and say,

00:20:17.282 --> 00:20:19.251
"Chris, I need you.

00:20:19.284 --> 00:20:20.986
"Remember that night
that I called you?

00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:22.254
"I should have followed through.

00:20:22.287 --> 00:20:23.989
"I should have given you
the ring.

00:20:24.022 --> 00:20:26.258
-"Will you...
-Or the rose or whatever.

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:28.326
"Will you come and join me
at the White House?

00:20:28.359 --> 00:20:29.728
I need you
in my administration."

00:20:29.761 --> 00:20:31.396
-Would you say yes?
-He's offered me

00:20:31.429 --> 00:20:32.897
six different jobs
since he's there,

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:34.299
-and I've said no
to all of them. -Why?

00:20:34.332 --> 00:20:37.168
Because there were no jobs that
he offered me that I wanted.

00:20:37.201 --> 00:20:38.970
-And...
-Which job would you want?

00:20:39.003 --> 00:20:40.438
I told him way back--

00:20:40.471 --> 00:20:42.440
and I put this in the book--
when I endorsed him,

00:20:42.473 --> 00:20:44.909
a day or two later, when we were
campaigning around together,

00:20:44.942 --> 00:20:46.578
he said to me,
"Hey, if I win this thing,

00:20:46.611 --> 00:20:48.647
what do you want?"
And I said,

00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.582
"There's only two jobs
that I'm interested in,

00:20:50.615 --> 00:20:52.584
-vice president
or attorney general." -Uh-huh.

00:20:52.617 --> 00:20:54.486
That's it. I said, "Those are
the two jobs that I think

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:56.821
"I'm most qualified for and
the ones that would excite me

00:20:56.854 --> 00:20:58.490
the most and where I think
I could do the most good."

00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:00.358
-Uh-huh. -I'm not looking
for another title.

00:21:00.391 --> 00:21:02.560
-I got plenty of titles. I-I...
-So let me ask you this.

00:21:02.593 --> 00:21:04.896
Would you-- would you-- would
you run for president again?

00:21:04.929 --> 00:21:07.399
-Never say never. I mean...
-Would you-- would you run

00:21:07.432 --> 00:21:09.401
-against Trump? Do you think
you could be-- -In 2020?

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:10.802
-do you think
you could beat him? -No.

00:21:10.835 --> 00:21:12.337
In a primary in 2020?

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:14.072
-Prob-- No, I don't think so.
-Do you think any Republican

00:21:14.105 --> 00:21:15.740
-could beat him?
-I don't think so. Not now.

00:21:15.773 --> 00:21:18.143
Now, listen,
politics is a dynamic thing,

00:21:18.176 --> 00:21:19.344
-and you never know.
-Right.

00:21:19.377 --> 00:21:20.612
But based on what we see
right now,

00:21:20.645 --> 00:21:22.480
no, I think--
You're the incumbent president.

00:21:22.513 --> 00:21:24.015
It's very hard to beat
an incumbent president

00:21:24.048 --> 00:21:25.283
in a primary.

00:21:25.316 --> 00:21:27.552
Um, and-and
he's still highly popular

00:21:27.585 --> 00:21:28.887
among Republican Party voters.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.555
I think the last poll I saw
had him at, like,

00:21:30.588 --> 00:21:33.024
-80% or 81% approval
among Republicans. -Right.

00:21:33.057 --> 00:21:34.959
So if 81% percent of the people

00:21:34.992 --> 00:21:36.628
like the guy
you're running against,

00:21:36.661 --> 00:21:38.430
that only leaves 19% for you.

00:21:38.463 --> 00:21:40.832
Um, so that's not good--
that's not a good game to play.

00:21:40.865 --> 00:21:42.834
So, no. But I'm 56 years old.

00:21:42.867 --> 00:21:44.436
Would I think
about doing it again?

00:21:44.469 --> 00:21:46.371
I-- Of course
I would think about it,

00:21:46.404 --> 00:21:50.108
but only if I saw
a reasonable path to win.

00:21:50.141 --> 00:21:52.577
Like, I don't want to be one
of these guys who runs

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:54.512
-just 'cause, like, "Hey,
why not? Let's run." -Mm-hmm.

00:21:54.545 --> 00:21:56.915
It's too hard to do that,
and it's too important.

00:21:56.948 --> 00:21:58.583
I didn't run in 2012,

00:21:58.616 --> 00:22:00.785
despite a lot of people
asking me to do it,

00:22:00.818 --> 00:22:02.654
-because I didn't feel
like I was ready. -Right.

00:22:02.687 --> 00:22:05.123
I had an antiquated view
of the presidency at that time,

00:22:05.156 --> 00:22:06.791
-apparently. -And now you're
like, "It's a free-for-all."

00:22:06.824 --> 00:22:09.661
Now I'm like, "What? (stammers)
I-I had 15 months as governor?

00:22:09.694 --> 00:22:11.463
I was overqualified!" Um...

00:22:11.496 --> 00:22:13.432
(laughing)

00:22:14.699 --> 00:22:16.401
But-but, at the time,

00:22:16.434 --> 00:22:17.869
I had 15 months as governor,
I thought, like,

00:22:17.902 --> 00:22:20.271
"I can't do this.
Like, this is ridiculous.

00:22:20.304 --> 00:22:22.474
This is not right."
And maybe, politically,

00:22:22.507 --> 00:22:25.810
-I had a good chance to-to
win-win the nomination. -Right.

00:22:25.843 --> 00:22:28.279
I felt like, in your heart,
you got to believe

00:22:28.312 --> 00:22:31.483
that you can win
and that, if you win,

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:34.886
that you're qualified to do the
most important job in the world.

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:36.621
That's the way I feel about it.

00:22:36.654 --> 00:22:38.823
So the answer to your question
is, yeah, I'd think about it

00:22:38.856 --> 00:22:41.760
but only if I thought
that I had a path to win.

00:22:41.793 --> 00:22:43.762
And if I didn't,
then you have no business

00:22:43.795 --> 00:22:45.830
going out and asking people
for money and asking people

00:22:45.863 --> 00:22:47.165
-for-for their vote.
-Right.

00:22:47.198 --> 00:22:49.167
-It's just not right.
-I will say this.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.302
Um, we haven't always agreed
on everything.

00:22:51.335 --> 00:22:53.138
We fight and argue about stuff.

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:54.739
But I've always appreciated
that you come on the show

00:22:54.772 --> 00:22:56.274
-and that you talk.
-Listen, you're great.

00:22:56.307 --> 00:22:58.009
And I love coming on the show,
and I love what you do.

00:22:58.042 --> 00:22:59.344
-Thank you for being here.
-Thank you.

00:22:59.377 --> 00:23:01.546
 Let Me Finish. 
It's a fascinating book,

00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:03.582
and it's available now. Governor
Chris Christie, everybody.
