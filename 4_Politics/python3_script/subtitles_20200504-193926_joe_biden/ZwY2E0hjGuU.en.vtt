00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:05.471
Nuclear waste.

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:08.407
The worst type of garbage
for raccoons to get into.

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:11.244
Now, it's a substance
that we all know is dangerous

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:12.779
thanks to movies like this.

00:00:13.045 --> 00:00:15.849
NARRATOR:<i> They tormented him
 until he had a horrifying</i>

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.518
<i> accident and fell into a bag
 of nuclear waste.</i>

00:00:18.618 --> 00:00:22.021
<i> Melvin became
 The Toxic Avenger,</i>

00:00:22.255 --> 00:00:25.825
<i> the first superhero born
 out of nuclear waste.</i>

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.728
<i> -His face is so terrifying...</i>
-(SCREAMS)

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:31.764
NARRATOR:
<i>...we can't show it to you now.</i>

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:34.166
<i> You'll have to see the movie
 for yourself.</i>

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:38.004
Honestly, you really don't need
to see the movie, 'cause...

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:40.339
his face isn't really
that terrifying. This is it.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.708
I mean it's bad, but its--
it's so ugly,

00:00:42.808 --> 00:00:44.243
it's almost cute again.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.779
It's like-- it's like someone
melted a candle shaped

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.281
-like a pug.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.883
But-- but the point here is

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:52.952
nuclear waste, the radioactive
and toxic byproducts

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:55.055
from making nuclear energy
and weapons is

00:00:55.155 --> 00:00:58.458
a serious health hazard,
and America has a lot of it.

00:00:59.092 --> 00:01:02.562
ANCHOR:<i> There are more than
 71,000 tons of nuclear waste</i>

00:01:02.662 --> 00:01:05.331
<i> stranded
 at the nation's 104 reactors.</i>

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.034
<i> Put all those
 spent fuel rods together,</i>

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:10.870
<i> and you get a pile
 as big as a football field</i>

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.638
<i> and more than 20 feet tall.</i>

00:01:13.005 --> 00:01:14.506
Or you could put them
in a pile as big

00:01:14.606 --> 00:01:16.842
as two football fields
and ten feet tall

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:19.478
or half a football field
and 40 feet tall.

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.914
Or 20 football fields,
one foot tall.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:25.217
The point is, we have a lot of
nuclear waste and it's very fun

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:26.719
-to play with.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:29.455
And look, that is just the waste
from nuclear energy.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.124
We also have more than
100 million gallons

00:01:32.224 --> 00:01:34.693
of hazardous liquid waste
from producing weapons.

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:37.597
And you may live closer
to nuclear waste than you think.

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:41.100
One out of three Americas lives
within 50 miles

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.735
of high level nuclear waste.

00:01:42.835 --> 00:01:45.838
Some of which, like plutonium,
is lethally dangerous,

00:01:46.038 --> 00:01:49.075
and will be-- will be around
for an incredibly long time.

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.244
NARRATOR:<i> Even microscopic
 amounts of plutonium,</i>

00:01:52.344 --> 00:01:54.013
<i> if ingested, are deadly.</i>

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.182
One of the characteristics
of it is it has

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.816
an extremely long half-life.

00:01:58.217 --> 00:02:00.787 line:0%
Plutonium 239, for example,
has a half life

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:02.855 line:0%
of about 24,000 years.

00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:06.625
It's true, 24,000 years and that
just scratches the surface.

00:02:06.725 --> 00:02:10.162
It takes ten half-lives
for plutonium to become harmless

00:02:10.362 --> 00:02:12.765
so that's 240,000 years.

00:02:13.065 --> 00:02:16.536 line:0%
A unit of time more commonly
known as one English patient.

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:17.737 line:0%
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:02:17.837 --> 00:02:20.773 line:0%
And as any adult with
an American girl doll collection

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:22.942
eventually finds out,
if you wanna keep something

00:02:23.042 --> 00:02:25.844
around for a disturbingly
long time, you have got to find

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:27.480
an appropriate place to put it.

00:02:27.947 --> 00:02:30.783
"I cannot live
with your murder dolls anymore.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.386
Felicity stares at me
while I sleep!

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:34.954
She stares at me!"

00:02:35.254 --> 00:02:37.390
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS, CHEERS)
-"She stares unblinking!"

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.191
And look,

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:41.327
I'm not the first person
to make this point.

00:02:41.427 --> 00:02:43.296
Look at this news report
from 1990.

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:45.097
NARRATOR:
<i> Almost half a century</i>

00:02:45.197 --> 00:02:46.799
<i> after nuclear power
 was harnessed,</i>

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:50.169
<i> there still is no agreement
 on where to store the waste.</i>

00:02:50.536 --> 00:02:52.605
<i> "We have built the house,"
 said one critic,</i>

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:54.640
<i> "and forgotten the toilets."</i>

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:56.509
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-A home...

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.378
with no toilets. Or as a realtor
selling a Brooklyn loft

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:02.115
is calling it right now,
"artisanal composting."

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:03.416
Wait.

00:03:03.516 --> 00:03:05.651
You're suggesting that
I shit in that potted plant

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:07.921
while you and I both know that
I will do that

00:03:08.221 --> 00:03:09.955
'cause this is convenient
to public transport,

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.824
and has both northern
and eastern exposures.

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.092
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:16.362
But look, it-- it has been
27 years since that clip

00:03:16.462 --> 00:03:19.231
and our country still doesn't
have a nuclear toilet.

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:21.167
And that is
our subject tonight.

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.003
Why do we not have
a nuclear toilet?

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.439
And it's actually easy
to understand how we got

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.941
into this situation.
Because during World War Two,

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:31.410
we rushed to develop nuclear
weapons because we were trying

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.378
to defeat the Nazis,

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:35.681
who, fun fact, pretty much
all Americans agreed were bad

00:03:35.781 --> 00:03:37.116
-at the time.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:39.585
Anyway, the-- the thing is,

00:03:39.852 --> 00:03:42.722
we didn't really have
a plan on what to do

00:03:42.822 --> 00:03:45.624
with all the radioactive
byproducts that we produced.

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:46.925
And this initially led us

00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:49.295
to some mind-blowingly
stupid solutions.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.764
For instance, for years,
we actually did this...

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:54.033
MAN:<i> They loaded the, uh,</i>

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:58.704
radioactive waste and it was
in barrels, 55 gallon barrels,

00:03:58.938 --> 00:04:03.076 line:0%
of, uh, radioactive waste
with concrete poured over it.

00:04:03.343 --> 00:04:05.344 line:0%
It's funny, the ocean
don't glow out there

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:08.547 line:0%
outside of Red Bank, New Jersey.
(CHUCKLES)

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:11.951
Really. 'Cause we dumped
a lot of barrels out there.

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:13.986
-(AUDIENCE GASPS)
-That is true.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.389
We didn't just dump barrels
of radioactive waste

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.191
in the ocean, we did it
off the coast of New Jersey.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:20.359
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:21.961
That is so horrifying!

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:25.498
I'm surprised that<i> Jersey Shore</i>
was the title of a lighthearted

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.401
MTV series, and not the name
of a harrowing documentary.

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:31.637
An entire generation of children
was born without thumbs,

00:04:31.737 --> 00:04:33.539
a phenomenon known
to locals as...

00:04:33.873 --> 00:04:36.475
-"The Situation."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:04:36.575 --> 00:04:38.043
And, incidentally,

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:41.947
not all of those barrels sank.
In fact, in 1957,

00:04:42.047 --> 00:04:44.550
when two barrels were
caught floating off the shore,

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.186
naval aircraft were summoned
to strafe them

00:04:47.286 --> 00:04:49.655
with machine-gun fire
until they sank.

00:04:49.755 --> 00:04:50.589
That's right.

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:52.625
They shot barrels full
of nuclear waste

00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:54.260
with machine guns!

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:57.263
That's got to be one of the most
terrifying sentences ever said

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.598
out loud, right after,

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.232
"Donald Trump is
the president now,"

00:05:00.332 --> 00:05:03.135
and, "Wait, wasn't Felicity
on a different shelf

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:04.837
when we went to bed last night?

00:05:04.937 --> 00:05:08.107
Oh, my God!
Felicity is a waking nightmare!"

00:05:08.207 --> 00:05:09.542
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:05:10.208 --> 00:05:11.143
Oh!

00:05:11.543 --> 00:05:14.780
Well, the truth is, tossing
barrel-fulls of nuclear waste

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.215
into the ocean and shooting them

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:18.751
with machine guns is actually
preferable to at least

00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:21.854
one genuine other idea
that was thankfully rejected,

00:05:21.954 --> 00:05:24.023
and that was blasting it
into space.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.260
A concept
with a pretty clear flaw.

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:29.161
WOMAN:<i> Unfortunately,</i>

00:05:29.562 --> 00:05:31.497
<i> we don't have a great record</i>

00:05:32.564 --> 00:05:34.801
<i> with getting rockets
 out into the atmosphere.</i>

00:05:36.502 --> 00:05:38.204
<i> If any one of them blew up,</i>

00:05:39.272 --> 00:05:41.207
<i>that would basically contaminate</i>

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:44.710
<i> a large portion of the Earth
 with radioactive material.</i>

00:05:45.244 --> 00:05:46.646
(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:05:48.848 --> 00:05:50.616
WOMAN:<i> So that's probably
 not a great idea.</i>

00:05:51.216 --> 00:05:52.318
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Yeah.

00:05:52.885 --> 00:05:55.287
You're right. That's probably
not a great idea.

00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:58.257
I mean, a really great idea
would be also filling

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.225
the rockets up with confetti,
so at least that way

00:06:00.325 --> 00:06:03.429
if there's a horrific accident,
there's also a party!

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:04.664
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:06:04.997 --> 00:06:08.067
Now, over the years, we have
dumped nuclear waste all over

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:11.237
the country and in many places,
there've been frightening leaks.

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:13.773
Take the Savannah River Site
in South Carolina,

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.008
where waste from poorly-stored
material leaked

00:06:16.108 --> 00:06:17.009
into the ground water.

00:06:17.342 --> 00:06:19.778
And just watch this alarmingly
laid back man explain

00:06:19.878 --> 00:06:21.113
the consequences of that.

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:24.217
MAN:<i> There are radioactive
 alligators on the site.</i>

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:25.717

00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:28.420

00:06:33.592 --> 00:06:35.528
<i> there's gonna be
 radioactive alligators.</i>

00:06:36.028 --> 00:06:37.362
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-Yeah.

00:06:37.829 --> 00:06:39.098
Radioactive alligators!

00:06:39.598 --> 00:06:40.833
They even have names,

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.135
Tritagator and Dioxinator,

00:06:43.335 --> 00:06:45.437
after two of the wastes
that poisoned them.

00:06:45.537 --> 00:06:46.472
And that's actually very clever,

00:06:46.572 --> 00:06:48.307
because if I had
to give them names,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:50.009
I don't know, I'd probably
have gone with something like,

00:06:50.109 --> 00:06:53.312
(SCREAMS) "Holy Shit! A Fucking
Radioactive Alligator!"

00:06:53.646 --> 00:06:55.781
And, "Oh No, Fuck Me,
There's Another One!

What Nightmare
Hath God Wrought?"

00:06:59.285 --> 00:07:01.753
And it's not just reptiles
who've been impacted

00:07:01.854 --> 00:07:03.922
by nuclear waste.
Researchers are now studying

00:07:04.022 --> 00:07:05.925
an area in North St. Louis
County, Missouri,

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:08.628
where tons of waste
from the Manhattan project was

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.730
improperly stored,
some near a creek

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:12.764
that winds through
residential communities,

00:07:12.864 --> 00:07:15.868
and people who live there have
noticed some alarming trends.

00:07:16.535 --> 00:07:18.570
JENELL WRIGHT:<i> I got on Facebook
 in order to reconnect</i>

00:07:18.671 --> 00:07:20.305
<i>with people from high school...</i>

00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:23.943
<i> And we all immediately
 started noticing that so many</i>

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:26.245
<i> of us were sick.
 We've discovered that</i>

00:07:26.345 --> 00:07:28.080
<i> the Department
 of Veterans Affairs</i>

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:32.785
<i>officially recognizes around 21

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:35.621
<i> to ionizing radiation,

00:07:36.188 --> 00:07:37.289
<i> to what we had.</i>

<i> We had all of those cancers,
 every single one.</i>

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:44.296
That is an incredibly
depressing thing to discover

00:07:44.396 --> 00:07:46.265
on Facebook and it's-- it's hard
to know how to respond.

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:48.100
I mean, you definitely
don't want to use

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.668
the "like" button, because...

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:51.804
then it looks
like you really like the fact

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:52.738
they just got cancer.

00:07:52.838 --> 00:07:55.074
Now, there is
that new sad emoji,

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:56.442
which would really be perfect

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:58.710
if you hadn't already cheapened
it by using it to respond

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.813
to the news that Chris Pratt
and Anna Faris were separating.

00:08:01.913 --> 00:08:05.918
I mean, it is sad. It is sad.
But it is not "21-cancer" sad.

00:08:06.618 --> 00:08:08.955
It's "nine-cancer" sad.
Tops.

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:13.125
The point is, thankfully,
60 years ago,

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:15.428
our government
and the scientific consensus

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:16.895
came up with a solution.

00:08:16.995 --> 00:08:20.132
In 1957, the National Academy
of Sciences issued a report

00:08:20.399 --> 00:08:23.168
urging the creation
of a permanent storage facility

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.971
deep underground.
Basically, a nuclear toilet.

00:08:26.305 --> 00:08:28.140
And while we did build
a repository

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.175
for lower-level waste
in New Mexico,

00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:31.543
we still haven't built one

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:34.446
for the most dangerous,
high-level waste.

00:08:34.547 --> 00:08:36.549
And, as a result, it's
essentially been left

00:08:36.849 --> 00:08:38.850
wherever it was made.
Which is not good,

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.986
because those facilities
were not built

00:08:41.286 --> 00:08:43.522
with the idea that they would be
storing waste indefinitely.

00:08:43.622 --> 00:08:45.958
So, to continue the toilet
metaphor,

00:08:46.158 --> 00:08:48.193
we've basically been shitting
in bags,

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:49.862
leaving them
all over the house,

00:08:49.962 --> 00:08:51.597
and praying
that they don't leak.

00:08:53.232 --> 00:08:55.301

example of this is

00:08:55.401 --> 00:08:57.402
the Hanford Site
in Washington state,

00:08:57.502 --> 00:08:59.604
which created two third
of the plutonium

00:08:59.704 --> 00:09:01.641

and is currently storing

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:04.510
56 million gallons
of highly toxic

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.211
and radioactive waste
underground.

00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:06.979
And over the years,

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.481
there have been so many issues
at Hanford,

00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:11.250
that they've achieved
a dubious honor,

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.051
as one local
new-station reported,

00:09:13.151 --> 00:09:15.054

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:45.050
There have been a string
of problems at Hanford,

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.686
from explosions,
to toxic vapor releases,

over the years.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.158
It has been so bad,
the government has had

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:55.728

one and a half billion dollars

to radiation

00:10:00.165 --> 00:10:01.367
and toxic chemicals there.

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:03.502
A local news station has done
a series of reports

And even though it hasn't
produced anything for 30 years,

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:48.380
the Department of Energy
still spends

nearly two and a half billion

00:11:15.607 --> 00:11:18.243
remember there are nuclear
power plants storing waste

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:20.779
all over the country,
lots of it in so-called

"spent fuel pools."

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:25.017

temporarily placed to cool down,

00:11:26.885 --> 00:11:28.887

But remember,
we don't have one of those.

00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:37.395

are just accumulating

00:11:37.495 --> 00:11:38.663
more and more rods.

00:11:38.764 --> 00:11:40.399
And while experts say
it's highly unlikely,

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:43.836
if a Fukushima-like accident
happens at one of those,

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:45.771

a permanent facility to store
our most dangerous waste.

we actually settled on a site,

Yucca Mountain in Nevada.

00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:34.653

and on the basis of that,
managing volatile energy

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.828
is not really his forte.

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:32.197
But here's the thing.
We've been saying

00:15:32.298 --> 00:15:34.533
that we are going to fix this
for decades now,

00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:36.768
and we seem to be no closer
to a solution.

00:15:36.868 --> 00:15:37.770
And let me show you something

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.371
that really drove that fact
home to us,

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:40.906
because we've
been researching this story

00:15:41.006 --> 00:15:43.609
for a couple of weeks now,
and just yesterday afternoon,

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:47.345
we stumbled on a TV special
from 1977,

00:15:47.445 --> 00:15:48.580
the year that I was born.

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:52.418
♪ (MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

00:15:55.353 --> 00:15:56.922
NARRATOR:
<i> NBC News presents...</i>

00:16:00.358 --> 00:16:02.428
Danger! Radioactive Waste.

00:16:03.328 --> 00:16:05.397
Yeah, this problem is so old

00:16:05.497 --> 00:16:07.366
they reported on it back when
the news was kept

00:16:07.466 --> 00:16:09.467
in an America-shaped vault
that you had to open

00:16:09.567 --> 00:16:10.602
with a crank.

00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:13.305
As we watched that yesterday,
we gradually

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:15.908
and chillingly realized that
by pure coincidence

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:19.344
it hits every beat of the story
that we just told you.

00:16:19.578 --> 00:16:21.747
It opens with footage
of sailors throwing barrels

00:16:21.847 --> 00:16:22.781
into the ocean.

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:24.883
It looks at the facilities
at Hanford.

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:27.452
It talks about radiation's
impact on workers

00:16:27.685 --> 00:16:29.354
and on families
who live nearby.

00:16:29.554 --> 00:16:31.523
And while it doesn't have
a radioactive alligator,

00:16:31.724 --> 00:16:33.658
it does have radioactive cows.

00:16:33.925 --> 00:16:35.761
Which is-- which is still good.
Although,

00:16:35.861 --> 00:16:38.029
I did prefer our alligator.

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:40.299
I liked it when he went...
(HISSES)

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.500
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
-But--

00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:43.268
But the most chilling moment

00:16:43.501 --> 00:16:46.004
in that documentary might be
the one where they sit down

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:48.239
with someone in authority,
and demand to know

00:16:48.339 --> 00:16:50.075
exactly when this will be fixed.

00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.945
NARRATOR:<i> When you ask
when the problem will be solved,</i>

00:16:53.045 --> 00:16:54.312
<i> you get answers like this.</i>

00:16:54.946 --> 00:16:56.648
WOMAN: What's the realistic
time table?

00:16:57.515 --> 00:16:59.518 line:0%
Realistic time table
is scheduled to have

00:16:59.618 --> 00:17:02.721 line:0%
a repository in operation
by 1985,

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:06.792
with the selection of the sites
by the end of 1978

00:17:06.892 --> 00:17:07.960
for detailed work.

00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:09.327
Exactly.

00:17:09.761 --> 00:17:12.163
Nuclear waste is a problem
we were supposed to have dealt

00:17:12.263 --> 00:17:14.833
with in the 1980's
and still cannot solve,

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:18.670
much like this Rubik's Cube
that I always carry with me.

00:17:19.071 --> 00:17:22.541
You are my Jean Valjean,
cube, and, one day,

00:17:22.975 --> 00:17:25.243
-I shall defeat you.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

00:17:25.443 --> 00:17:27.679
And at the end
of that special, remember,

00:17:27.779 --> 00:17:31.249
40 years ago, the correspondent
delivers this special message.

00:17:31.783 --> 00:17:33.852
The waste
increases every minute.

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:37.088
The solution of where
to put it is years away.

00:17:37.556 --> 00:17:39.525
<i> And none of the previous
 solutions has worked.</i>

00:17:40.893 --> 00:17:42.827
<i> We are accustomed
 in this country to act</i>

00:17:42.927 --> 00:17:44.763
<i> only in times of crisis.</i>

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:47.266
<i> But with nuclear waste,</i>

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:49.701
<i> when the crisis comes,
 it will be too late.</i>

00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:52.971
And that was
from four decades ago.

00:17:53.071 --> 00:17:56.241
We have already waited way
too long to resolve this issue.

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:58.309
And we are dancing
with trouble here.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.345
So if any one says
the government

00:18:00.445 --> 00:18:02.147
can just continue to wait,

00:18:02.247 --> 00:18:04.916
they are much like
a house with no toilet.

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:07.185
Absolutely full of shit.

00:18:07.285 --> 00:18:08.887
