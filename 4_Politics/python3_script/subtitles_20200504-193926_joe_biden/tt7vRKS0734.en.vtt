00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.160
If there is one thing we have
learned over the past 25 years,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.050
it is that life can
change in an instant.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.730
In the amount of time it
takes to replace a light bulb,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.120
to put on your lipstick,
to get your mail,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.730
it can happen just that fast.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.240
Nobody knows that better
than Lori and Chris Coble.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.760
What happened to them
has us all shaking

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.840
our heads in utter disbelief.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.880
It is a story of imaginable
loss, unbelievable courage,

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.530
and an undeniable miracle.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.540
A twist of fate that will make
the little hairs on the back

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.660
of your neck stand up.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.450
It starts with the worst
day of their lives.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.770
We knew when we first got
married that we definitely

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.860
wanted kids right away.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.200
Well, we were definitely a--

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.120
I think best described as
a goofy, fun-loving family.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.570
And there was plenty of dancing
and silliness and laughing.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.910
And I think we just liked
to have a lot of fun.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.489
LORI: Oh, here's your crazy
sister coming to do it, too.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.260
It was the day after
Kyle's birthday.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.100
My mom was with us that day.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.490
And we wanted to go somewhere
and do something fun.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.620
We decided to go
to a local shopping

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.750
center that had a Ferris wheel.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.390
And Kyle wanted to go
on the Ferris wheel.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.450
We went on the merry-go-round,
went to the pet store.

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.060
Everything the kids loved to do.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.950
It was getting pretty
close to nap time.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.590
And the kids kind of
starting to get tired.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.440
So we packed the car
up, got on the freeway,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.100
and started to head home.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.830
While we were driving
home, Emma and Katie

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.510
were watching a movie on TV.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.450
And Kyle was playing
with a new Nintendo DS

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.060
he just got for his birthday.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.130
After 10 minutes
being in the car,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.590
I was stuck, stopped in traffic.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.020
And I turned around
to check on the kids.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.520
And that's when I noticed
that Katie was falling asleep.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.710
So I reached back and
I tickled her toes.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.115
And that was one of the
last things that I remember.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.080
A big rig truck, loaded
with 40,000 pounds of cargo,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.970
slammed into Lori's minivan
at over 55 miles per hour.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.040
Lori was knocked unconscious.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.680
But her mother, Cindy,
who was also in the car,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.080
remembers everything.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.760
CINDY: All of a sudden,
all I could hear

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.890
was metal bending and
crashing and crunching.

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.920
And it was the worst sound
I've ever heard in my life.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.570
RICHARD: It was the most
horrific accident I've--

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.470
I've ever seen.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.240
And it just happened so quick.

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.848
Alls I could think
was, oh, my god.

00:02:48.848 --> 00:02:51.140
How are we going to get these
kids out of here as well?

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.030
And I couldn't.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.100
I couldn't get them out.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.920
The next thing I
remember is waking

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.050
up on the side of the freeway.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.030
OPRAH: Lori had a
severe concussion.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.400
Her mother, Cindy,
had broken ribs.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.110
They were taken to one hospital.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.760
In order to handle
all of the trauma,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.920
Kyle and Katie were
taken to another.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.560
And four-year-old
Emma went to a third.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.650
Chris was at work when he
received the devastating news.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.450
Doctors wouldn't
tell him anything

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.130
until he got to the hospital.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.070
I literally ran to the
emergency room at that point.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.620
They took me back
into a small room.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:35.440
And the doctor told me, I'm
sorry, but Katie has expired.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.600
A few more minutes went by.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.650
They told me there was
a call from the doctor

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.450
from Saddleback Hospital.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.580
And I got on the phone.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.670
And the first thing I said was,
please tell me Emma is alive.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.110
And he said, I'm sorry,
but Emma has expired.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.840
So I just dropped the phone.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.100
I just couldn't believe
that was happening.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.380
It's almost like my world went
black at that point, you know?

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.280
Emma was at a third hospital
30 to 40 minutes away

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.519
from where we were.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.769
It was one of my own children.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.779
I couldn't even make
it to that hospital

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:22.190
with everything going on.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.690
OPRAH: Chris had to tell Lori
that Emma and Katie had died.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.280
LORI: I just remember screaming.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.780
And I didn't know how I could be
alive and they could have died.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.230
And I asked about Kyle.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.920
They didn't know if he
was going to make it.

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.900
I didn't want Kyle to be alone.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.560
I didn't want him to be
scared when he woke up.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.430
OPRAH: Chris rushed to be with
Kyle, his only remaining child.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.340
And I could see Kyle on a
bed with lots of equipment

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.240
around him.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.910
And he was laying there
with his eyes half open.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.400
I had some hope for a moment
that maybe he'll survive.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.430
So the doctor talked to me and--

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:07.440
and pulled me aside.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.510
His brain hadn't been
receiving any oxygen

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.980
and he wasn't coming back.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.360
They suggested to
stop life support.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.910
So we decided to get
Lori transported,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.420
so we could say goodbye
together to Kyle.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.580
I got to hold his hand and talk
to him, spend time with him,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.790
tell him I'm sorry
this happened.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.120
Wish I could go in his place.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.600
Wish I could change things.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.990
Brushing his hair back
and holding his hand.

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.540
His eyes were open.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.860
And I thought he was alive.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.210
I thought they were all wrong.

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.010
She was climbing
out of the wheelchair

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.020
as best she can to hug Kyle.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.740
And saying, he's got to go
be with his sisters now.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.115
His sisters are waiting for him.

00:05:57.115 --> 00:05:59.850
And so we stopped life support.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.530
The machines went dark.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.970
The room went dark.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:08.470
And I, uh, held my
hand on his chest.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.400
And-- until his heart
stopped beating.

00:06:15.559 --> 00:06:16.510
He was gone.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.370
Well, it's obviously very
difficult for Chris and Lori

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.260
to share their story.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.560
But I have to believe that they
will inspire everybody watching

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.470
today and help us all
understand that it is possible,

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:36.550
no matter what you
are facing right now,

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.340
somehow you can
keep going and put

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:41.440
one foot in front of the other.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.750
Thank you both for
being here today.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.870
How were you even able
to breathe after that?

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.280
I mean, how--

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:51.550
I'm sure that there was a
period of complete numbness,

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.300
where you were just
walking through your life.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.200
Yes.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.880
I think I was numb for--

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.000
for months
afterwards, for years.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.090
I'm still numb at times.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.257
OPRAH: This was three--

00:07:05.257 --> 00:07:06.340
LORI: 3 and 1/2 years ago.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:07.460
3 and 1/2 years ago.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:13.790
It was hard to get up
to do your daily routines,

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.150
to even take a shower.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.220
You somehow just do it.

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.360
We did it for them.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.120
But we, you know--

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:27.630
you're obviously in shock
for weeks, in disbelief.

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:31.200
And denial would be the most
descriptive word, probably.

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.100
OPRAH: Yeah.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.290
Because when you
wake up, you still

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:34.582
can't believe that it happened.

00:07:34.582 --> 00:07:36.230
You're hoping that
it was a nightmare.

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:37.130
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:38.780
The worst nightmare
you ever had.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.760
Every morning,
you just wake up.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.370
And you were happy to be asleep,
just for some period of time,

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:48.660
so you could get away from
the crushing feeling of grief.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.700
We wanted to tell the Cobles'
heart-wrenching story today

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.070
not just so that we could
be voyeurs in their lives,

00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:59.010
but because of their
strength and their ability

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:01.910
to keep standing,
to actually get

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:06.380
up and put one foot in front
of the other every day.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.960
As we go to break, Chris and
Lori share some tender memories

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.630
of Kyle, of Emma, and of Katie.

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:16.890
LORI: Kyle was an amazing kid.

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.560
Loved life, he was outgoing.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.590
He had lots of friends.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:25.630
He was just very unique.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.730
He was an angel.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.440
CHRIS: My fondest
memories of Emma

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.640
were the adventurous
side of her.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.150
She was independent and
brave and fun-loving.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.810
LORI: She had a
unique personality.

00:08:40.810 --> 00:08:42.040
She loved to dance.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.940
Emma was always bouncing around.

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.350
CHRIS: Katie was
our little handful.

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.710
She was the youngest, of course.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:52.960
She was very outgoing and loud.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:56.120
And she would dress
up as a princess.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.460
And she'd put on her
crown and her shoes

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.710
and dance on this little mat.

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.100
Hi, Daddy!

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:06.310
When, you know, you'd
come in the front door

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:08.840
and three children are
sprinting to get to you first,

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:13.040
I'd have to open my arms big and
catch everybody at full speed

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.150
and give everyone kisses.

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:17.160
So that was the best
part of coming home.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.210
OPRAH: You spent a
lot of time, I know,

00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:22.120
thinking about the
reason you survived.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.480
I think the reason I survived
was to stay here with Chris.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.520
I believe that he couldn't
have made it alone.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:35.720
And I think that I survived so
we could continue our family.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.740
OPRAH: So three months
after the accident,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:42.250
Lori and Chris decided to
try to have more children.

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:44.410
So first, tell us about
making that decision.

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:47.120
I think that was the
easy decision to make.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.790
I think we had so much
fun with the kids,

00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.590
the kids would want
us to be happy again.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.190
They'd want us to
have more children.

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:58.060
That seemed, like, very simple.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:58.790
Yeah.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.930
We always described ourself as--

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.870
at that point-- parents
without children.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.760
I mean, when you have
three children that young,

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.300
your whole lives are
dedicated to them.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.570
And you love it.

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:12.270
So what happened next
is, I think, a miracle.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:16.310
Almost one year to the
day after the tragic loss

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:17.340
of their children--

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.880
Kyle, Katie, and Emma--

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.850
Lori gave birth
again to triplets.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:26.990
But not just triplets.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.090
Two girls and a boy.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.790
Doesn't that give
you goose bumps?

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:37.630
We are thrilled to introduce
you to 2 and 1/2 year

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:41.660
old Ashley, Ellie, and Jake.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:51.580
Ashley, Ellie, and Jake.

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:57.780
Ashley, Ellie, and Jake.

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.250
Hi, guys.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.650
Hi.

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:03.290
Can you say hi, Jake?

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:04.250
Hi.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.720
2 and 1/2, you get
whatever you can.

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:08.990
You get whatever you can.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:14.800
So do you consider
it a miracle also?

00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:16.230
Yes, definitely.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.460
Definitely a miracle.

00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:19.400
OPRAH: I mean, really.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.600
Triplets.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.100
A boy and two girls.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.450
You probably want the
back story, don't you?

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:28.790
A little story.

00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.270
What-- what happened here?

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.340
Well, we had decided
we were done having

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.010
children prior to the accident.

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.480
So we had to do--

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.230
Daddy?

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:39.200
We had to do in--

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.860
Daddy?

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:43.470
We had do in vitro
for medical reasons.

00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:44.470
OPRAH: Yes.

00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:46.340
And we found out that it
was two girls and a boy.

00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:48.610
We took that as a
sign from above.

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:50.140
And we put them--

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:51.510
we put all back in.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.540
And almost, you know, nine
months later, they were born.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.640
OPRAH: Unbelievable.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:57.780
Do you think--
you know, I always

00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.700
say that when somebody
you love dies,

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.850
it feels like the spirit of
them is like an angel you know.

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:06.690
I heard you describing, you
know, Kyle as a little angel.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:10.160
Do you feel the spirit of
them through these children.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.120
Definitely.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.360
We see their little
personalities.

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.060
And definitely by their looks.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.860
Hi.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.460
Say hi to Oprah.

00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:18.770
OPRAH: Hi, Ellie.

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.700
Hi.

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.740
Definitely by their looks, yes.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.070
Their looks,
their personalities,

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:24.100
their mannerisms.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.340
They have fun together.

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:28.250
Yeah, it's great.

00:12:28.250 --> 00:12:30.050
It brings a smile to our face
to see that little part of Kyle,

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.080
Emma, and Katie come back.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.980
OPRAH: A little part of them.

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.160
Now, have you-- have you
already started talking to them

00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:40.520
about Kyle and Katie and Emma?

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:41.520
Yes.
Yes.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.830
They know that they
have two sisters

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:45.190
and a brother in heaven.

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:48.890
And we go to the cemetery
and we have picnics.

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:51.070
OPRAH: Really?

00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:54.160
As much of a picnic that a
2 and 1/2 year old can have.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.500
OPRAH: Yes, as much
as that can be.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.100
Yes.

00:12:56.100 --> 00:12:57.940
But yeah, I guess
my question is,

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:00.370
you will integrate the
lives of your children

00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:01.240
who are no longer here--

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.300
Of course.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.170
--with this?

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.950
Because they still are
a part of this family.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:07.280
Of course.
Of course.

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.210
OPRAH: And the reason for
these children's lives.

00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:10.240
They will grow up
with this knowledge.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.540
I mean, we have all the pictures
up on the walls in our house,

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.160
still, of Kyle, Emma, and Katie.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:17.550
And we look at them
everyday with them.

00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:21.450
And so they definitely will
be part of their lives,

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:22.460
knowledge of them.

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.330
OPRAH: Be part of their lives.

00:13:23.330 --> 00:13:24.590
That's amazing.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:27.260
So tell us about
their middle names.

00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.230
LORI: The triplets have
the same middle names

00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:31.830
as Kyle, Emma, and Katie.

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:35.170
OPRAH: So you-- they carry
a little piece of them.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.260
LORI: They do.
- Yeah.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.050
LORI: They do.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:38.100
They'll never be
able to know them,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.550
but they will know
them through us.

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:43.120
A miracle, don't you think?

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.800
A miracle.
