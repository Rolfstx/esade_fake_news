00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:02.563
- And we can move that
throttle to max power.

00:00:02.563 --> 00:00:04.502
(engine whines)

00:00:04.502 --> 00:00:07.700
(upbeat music)

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.343
- Over 50,000 horsepower, that's massive.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.360
- Just be careful, Sam, the
leading edges are pretty sharp.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.053
- Test cell, which is a
building within a building.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.990
- Wow.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.999
- But we can do water ingestion testing.

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:27.666
(engine whines)

00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.460
- Well, this is our DreamFix facility.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.843
- What went wrong with the Dreamliner?

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.440
- A special Trent 1000 over here.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.847
- Wow, this is a very different one.

00:00:39.847 --> 00:00:42.140
- Once it's finished, this
will be the world's largest

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.699
indoor testbed for experimental testing.

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:45.532
- It's like a swimming pool.

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:48.280
- Yeah, yeah, it's a bit, it
isn't actually a swimming pool.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.200
- I'm really impressed, but
this is really geared up

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.093
for the future generation
of engine like the UltraFan.

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:58.634
Welcome to Derby in the U.K.

00:00:58.634 --> 00:01:00.170
When you think about Rolls-Royce,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.840
you probably think about their cars,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.900
Rolls-Royce Phantom, Rolls-Royce Ghost.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.220
But for AvGeek like me and many
of you, we love aeroplanes ,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.720
we know Rolls-Royce make
great aeroplane engine.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.370
Today we're going to take a look inside

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.251
the Rolls-Royce engine factory.

00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:15.834
(upbeat music)

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.930
This building's like, huge.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.550
Looking through what they done, to me,

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.110
it's like rocket science.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.660
But here it's just production.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.523
Every 20 days a new engine get produced.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.453
- Welcome, Sam, to our
production test facility.

00:01:34.453 --> 00:01:36.770
This is where we start
to build the engines.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.630
So today we're going to look at
engine build for a XWB engine,

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.717
which is the exclusive engine on the A350.

00:01:42.717 --> 00:01:45.217
(engines hum)

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:51.250
(upbeat music)

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.790
Start of the process really, here.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.800
We've got behind us a fan disc.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.560
So this is where the fan blades go.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.070
If you look over behind the fan disc

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.070
you can see where the blades come in.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.690
So they're manufactured
and brought into here.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.640
So you've got fan blades, fan disc,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.790
and over on the table
here the annulus fillers,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.603
and they're the pieces
that go between the blades

00:02:07.603 --> 00:02:09.550
to make a nice, smooth finish

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.190
for the air flowing into the engine.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.964
So this really is the start of the process

00:02:12.964 --> 00:02:14.823
for our XWB engine.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.290
Then what we've got here now
is we've brought the disc,

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.002
the blades and the
annulus fillers together

00:02:22.002 --> 00:02:24.830
and formed the fan that goes
at the front of the engine,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.120
where the flow goes through the engine.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.120
And it's the fan that
produces the majority

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.387
of the thrust for the engine.

00:02:29.387 --> 00:02:32.890
And this is an assembled
fan for an XWB engine.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.480
- Wow, look at this blade here.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.594
- Just be careful, Sam, the
leading edges are pretty sharp.

00:02:36.594 --> 00:02:37.427
- Pretty sharp?

00:02:37.427 --> 00:02:40.420
- And that's to get a really
efficient flow into the engine.

00:02:43.336 --> 00:02:44.670
We've just seen the fan at
the front of the engine.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.930
What we're looking at now
is a turbine and a shaft

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.390
that goes at the back of the engine.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.427
Now, what this is is what drives the fan

00:02:50.427 --> 00:02:52.960
with a compressor end, so you tend to see

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.200
turbine blades hidden
in this casing up here,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.660
and then a long shaft that goes through

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.768
the middle of the engine
and drives the compressor

00:02:58.768 --> 00:03:00.830
or the fan at the front.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.350
So this is another module on build

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.693
that comes together to
make our XWB engine.

00:03:05.771 --> 00:03:08.354
(upbeat music)

00:03:12.116 --> 00:03:14.297
What we've got here now is
the low-pressure turbine

00:03:14.297 --> 00:03:15.920
at the back of the engine.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.160
That's the start of the core build,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.040
so that's why at the back of the engine

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.690
we've put that vertically
and gradually build that up

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.939
in what we call a stack,
that's building the core.

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.473
And then on the other side
of the shop, over here,

00:03:25.473 --> 00:03:27.490
we've got the fan being built.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.760
You saw the fan blades
being built nextdoor.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.199
This is the fan case, and
you can see lots of pipes

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.750
and wires on the outside,
very complex build process.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.317
And you can see we use electronic models

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:40.120
to direct the guys that
are building the engine.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.360
So they'll look on the screen,

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.300
look at where the pipes
need to go, check that

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.883
before they go and actually
put them on the engine.

00:03:47.022 --> 00:03:49.605
(upbeat music)

00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:55.810
So this is where we build
the core of the engine.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.730
So what we do there is we
start with the compressor

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.557
at the bottom, build up to the combustor

00:03:59.557 --> 00:04:01.730
and then the turbines on the top.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.629
And as you can see, the different levels,

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.080
where the guys that are
working on the engine

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.270
need to be close to the
bit they're working on,

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.383
so the floor moves as the
engine build progresses.

00:04:12.456 --> 00:04:15.039
(upbeat music)

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.713
Behind me, the core
has finished build now.

00:04:33.713 --> 00:04:36.280
She is now ready to marry with the fans.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.590
You remember the fan and the
core are built separately?

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.440
Here's the final core ready to go,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.670
we just need to join it to the fan.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.810
If you look behind me here, you can see

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.760
the core has been flipped
to being from vertical

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.968
to being horizontal, and the big fan case

00:04:47.968 --> 00:04:49.433
has been put on the front.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.540
- [Sam] Phil, what's this
machine's been doing,

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.380
spinning around?
- Okay.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.390
Well, before we put the
fan blades in the fan case

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.840
we need to make sure that the fan blades

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.730
are a perfect fit to the fan case.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:05.780
We don't want a very big
gap between the fan case

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.610
and the blades, so this
is just checking that

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.703
and making sure that they're
going to fit perfectly together.

00:05:18.077 --> 00:05:22.094
- Behind the 22 giant fan blade
is the turbine blade inside.

00:05:22.094 --> 00:05:25.480
They can generate, each
of 'em, 800 horsepower,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.389
so together, 68 turbine blade generate

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:31.820
over 50,000 horsepower, that's massive.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.250
This looks like the
engine's ready to roll.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.880
- Just 20 days from start to finish,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.640
and the engine's ready
to go across to test

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.080
before it goes to our customer.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.880
So let's go over now and
look at our test facility.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.862
- Test facility, so the engine
go to test facility now?

00:05:42.862 --> 00:05:43.865
- That's right.
- Then let's go.

00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:45.483
- That's where we go next, let's go.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.433
(upbeat music)

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.990
- Welcome to 58 Bed control room.

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.330
Here is where the guys
take control of the engine,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:06.400
whether it's to gather data
or ensure build conformity.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.267
We take the engine, we rig
it to the test facility

00:06:09.267 --> 00:06:11.760
and we carry out the
customer's requirements,

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.410
either to test it for maturity,
for different strains,

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.950
pressures, temperatures,
we can do many things

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.700
here in Derby in the test bed.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.040
This is basically the pilot takes control

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:23.870
of the engine with the throttle,

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.234
and we can move that
throttle to max power.

00:06:26.234 --> 00:06:28.901
(engine whines)

00:06:31.354 --> 00:06:34.050
And that will then put the
engine in a certain mode

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.310
through the power range.

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:39.041
We gather the data, we
write everything we do

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:41.850
electronically and
record everything we do.

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.779
And we also look at real-time
data in the control room

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.203
to ensure we are getting
the customer's requirements.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.480
So we have a safety system
here in the test facility

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.020
which allows us to make sure
that we have all the people

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.180
and the personnel out of the test facility

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.370
before we start work
and rotating the engine.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.430
So every single system has a lock on.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.190
Until all those locks are in place

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:10.240
we cannot start the engine.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.283
It's an interlock system for safety.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.179
So here we are, entering
the the test cell,

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:18.540
which is a building within a building,

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:21.260
which makes the building extremely quiet

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.700
when we run the engine.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.513
(upbeat music)

00:07:29.513 --> 00:07:31.417
This is the test cell now.

00:07:31.417 --> 00:07:35.450
So when we go through this door
we'll go into the test cell,

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.800
and we'll be able to look
at the test facility.

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.943
- Wow.

00:07:42.971 --> 00:07:45.554
(upbeat music)

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:51.484
- This is where we do
different types of testing.

00:07:51.484 --> 00:07:53.420
We can do pass-off testing right before

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:54.530
engines go to the customer,

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.710
we can do research testing
or development testing.

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.343
Some of them really exciting
and interesting tests

00:07:59.343 --> 00:08:02.600
that we don't do very often,
that we do in development,

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.560
ready for certification,
could fan blade-off tests,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.390
where we blow a fan off and check

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.097
that it's contained within the system.

00:08:09.097 --> 00:08:10.899
We could do a--
- Oh, you have to destroy it?

00:08:10.899 --> 00:08:13.810
- Destroy a blade to show--
- How they can sustain that.

00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:16.520
- To just prove that should
that happen in service,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.700
very unlikely that it would,
but we got to prove that

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.294
that event is safe, so we do that.

00:08:21.294 --> 00:08:23.404
We can do water ingestion testing.

00:08:23.404 --> 00:08:26.071
(engine whines)

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:29.900
We pour loads of water down
the front of the engine

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:31.890
to simulate a storm and
flying through a storm,

00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:34.400
and show that the engine
performs correctly in that.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.650
We can do bird strike
testing, where we fire birds

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.070
at the engine to simulate
what could happen

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:40.860
if you were to hit a bird and show

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:42.797
that the engine's strong
enough to take that.

00:08:42.797 --> 00:08:46.050
And we can also do what we
call cold-start testing,

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.870
where we basically bring
a massive fridge in

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.070
and put the engine in it.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:50.470
- Make it really cold.
- Overnight,

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.220
make it really, really cold,
and then take the fridge away

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.030
and prove that we can start
it cold, 'cause engines

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.390
find it more difficult to start
in really cold conditions.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.073
So all kinds of really important testing

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:02.737
that we can do on this cell in Derby.

00:09:02.737 --> 00:09:03.570
- All right.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.540
- So should we go now and
look at the preparation shop

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.860
where we get the engines ready

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.510
before they go on to the testbed?

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:11.930
Okay, so we're entering our prep shop,

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.880
our preparation shop,
where the engines come

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.950
before they go on the testbed.

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:18.161
Now, every engine that
we build here in Derby

00:09:18.161 --> 00:09:20.710
will come through here before it gets

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:21.950
delivered to our customer.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:24.470
So relatively simple setup
checks that we do on the testbed,

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.278
just to make sure
everything's working properly.

00:09:26.278 --> 00:09:28.635
Very similar to what you
might get with a car.

00:09:28.635 --> 00:09:31.010
So anytime we build a car,
before they deliver it

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.930
to the car showroom they
just give it a quick drive,

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:34.990
just to make sure everything's
functioning correctly.

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:37.840
We put the white on the
front, which simulates,

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:39.470
it's different to what
would go on in service,

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:41.370
but it simulates the front of the engine.

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:45.430
We connect it up to this
sort of carriage at the top

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:46.710
which simulates the pylon,

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:49.740
the bit that attaches the
engine to the aircraft.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:52.210
It's not exactly the same,
but it represents it.

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:55.020
And then you can lots and
lots and lots of connections.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:58.060
So the data then comes from
the engine into the pylon,

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:00.410
the pylon connects
together in the test cell,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.760
and all that data flows
back to those computers

00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:04.230
that we saw in the control rooms,

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.260
so the engineers and the test engineers

00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.580
can understand how the
engine's performing.

00:10:18.808 --> 00:10:21.391
(upbeat music)

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.770
- So Sam, this is our DreamFix facility

00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:31.710
which is a physical
representation, if you like,

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.780
of the effort we're putting
into fix this problem

00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:35.440
we've got with the Trent 1000,

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.270
and reduce the disruption
for our customers

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.160
which we are really regretful of.

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.420
At the moment we've got
about four engines in here

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.250
which we're fixing quickly on a turn time

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.170
to get them back out into the fleet.

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:47.395
And you see around you,
about the activity in here

00:10:47.395 --> 00:10:50.416
to really start to get onto
this problem and crack it,

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:53.944
embody all the fixes that we
know we've got designs for now.

00:10:53.944 --> 00:10:56.527
(upbeat music)

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.810
- The Trent 1000 engine
is developed specially

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.650
for 787 Dreamliners, but
somehow they suffer a problem.

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:05.970
What went wrong with the Dreamliner

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.710
on the Trent 1000 engine, Richard?

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.540
- Well, we had three issues,
but I think the easiest way

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:14.430
to try and understand
it is use a car analogy.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.669
Imagine you've got a car,
it's been proven safe for use,

00:11:18.669 --> 00:11:21.770
but you know that the tyres
will wear out at some point,

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:22.680
you know that the windscreen wipers'll

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.340
wear out at some point.

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.040
Those things happen,
and you bring those in

00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.660
to fix them as and when they need.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:29.180
Two of our problems were like that.

00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.680
So we had an HP turbine and IP turbine

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.890
that were wearing out slightly
earlier than expected,

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.600
so you bring them in to replace
them earlier than expected.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.670
On top of that, and the
third problem which made it

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:41.260
a bit trickier was we had
an IP compressor problem,

00:11:41.260 --> 00:11:43.780
which was not something that
you can monitor on condition.

00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.787
So it's not like wearing your tyres out

00:11:45.787 --> 00:11:47.630
or looking at your windscreen wipers.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:49.700
Imagine you had a problem with an oil pump

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.100
that you had to bring in.

00:11:51.100 --> 00:11:53.040
If you bring that car in because the tyres

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.120
you know have worn out,
you don't necessarily

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.690
replace the wiper blades and
the oil pump at the same time.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.090
That's why it's take a while for us

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.650
to flow all of these fixes in,

00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:03.280
just because you don't necessarily
fix everything at once.

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.970
The engine's perfectly safe
and perfectly reliable,

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:07.660
it's just that we're not
making it last as long

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:09.520
as we and our customers would like it to.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.620
So that's the three
problems we're addressing.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.450
So imagine you're bringing in your tyres,

00:12:13.450 --> 00:12:15.372
we're putting new tyres
on, not necessarily

00:12:15.372 --> 00:12:17.470
changing the windscreen
wipers at the same time

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:19.360
because they might still be good to go.

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.450
Then you come in next time,

00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:22.983
you change the windscreen wipers,
your tyres are still fine.

00:12:22.983 --> 00:12:24.530
That's why it takes a long time,

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.330
but we'll get there and
we'll fix this problem.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:29.030
It's all ready, the design
fixes are already in place.

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.700
So Sam, we're in the DreamFix facility

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.810
looking at Trent 1000s,
and we've actually got

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.580
a special Trent 1000 over here

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.670
that's got some of our newer technology

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:41.670
for future engines on, which
I could like to show you

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.690
if you want to walk this way.

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:43.638
- Let's take a look.

00:12:43.638 --> 00:12:46.221
(upbeat music)

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:50.860
Wow, this is a very different one.

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.533
This one has blue turquoise
colour engine blade.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:59.250
It looks like carbon rim here, yeah.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:02.640
So what's the latest technology
breakthrough at Rolls-Royce?

00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.460
- So this is actually a test engine

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:09.720
for our latest carbon/titanium
fan and containment system,

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.340
which is the application
of carbon technology

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:14.680
to reduce the weight of
the front of the engine,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:15.870
the fan and the fan case.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:18.400
It's running on a Trent 1000 donor engine,

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.670
'cause it happens to be the right size,

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:21.700
but we're putting this
engine and the new system

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.000
through its paces.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.530
This technology, it's taken a while for us

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.300
to surpass our own
class-leading titanium blades.

00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:31.680
And that's fundamentally because
first and second generation

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.970
carbon blades, while they
were good for weight,

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.760
they weren't as good for air dynamics,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.320
whereas our titanium blades
that we saw in the Trent 1000,

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.670
they're excellent for both.

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:41.710
Now we've got a technology where,

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:44.320
because of the 3D weave
of the carbon fibre,

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.089
we can make a blade
that is both lightweight

00:13:46.089 --> 00:13:48.200
and aerodynamically efficient.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.440
So a system like this at this size

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.203
would save about 750 pounds per engine,

00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:57.200
which is about, obviously
on a twin-engined aircraft,

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.930
1,500 pounds of weight
that you can really,

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:04.060
either burn less fuel
or take more passengers.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:07.280
'Cause what we'll also do
during certification testing

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:10.620
is we'll put an explosive
bolt into the root here

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.610
and explode that when the
engine's at full power,

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.154
and then the engine has
to prove it can contain

00:14:15.154 --> 00:14:17.581
the kinetic energy of that blade.

00:14:17.581 --> 00:14:21.380
If one of these were to let
go under those circumstances,

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.130
the amount of energy that
we're talking about containing

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.530
would be similar to if
you take a BMW 3 Series

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.380
and drive off a 100-foot cliff.

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:31.960
That's the amount of energy
that this has to contain.

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.700
And what we've got to prove
as the engine manufacturer

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.450
is that, the engine doesn't necessarily

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.040
have to continue running
and producing thrust,

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.610
but it does have to make
sure that it runs down safely

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:43.007
and no high-energy debris
penetrates the casing

00:14:43.007 --> 00:14:46.250
to go and harm the fuselage.

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.657
So if one of these were to
happen while you are flying,

00:14:49.657 --> 00:14:51.670
then you might spill your gin and tonic

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:53.070
but you'd be perfectly safe.

00:14:57.336 --> 00:15:00.530
(upbeat music)

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:04.070
- So today we're changing
up to construction gear,

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:06.070
because today we're going to see something

00:15:06.070 --> 00:15:07.243
under the construction.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.480
- We're here today at Bed 80.

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:18.380
So once it's finished, this
will be the world's largest

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.930
indoor testbed for experimental testings.

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:22.790
This is where we actually push our engines

00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:24.720
to their ultimate limits
so we can understand

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.830
how they really perform.

00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:28.480
So what we're doing now is really putting

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.520
the intelligence into the building.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.530
We're fitting out the
systems which will allow us

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.870
to control the engine,
but more importantly

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:36.670
understand what the engine's doing.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.554
And we can actually read
up to 10,000 parameters

00:15:38.554 --> 00:15:41.940
on this bed, and we can
take that data real-time

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.247
and we can actually stream
it back out to the cloud

00:15:44.247 --> 00:15:46.250
so that it can actually link real time

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.760
to all our various models.

00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.460
So really exciting for us,

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:52.330
it's not just a construction
project, you know?

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.113
This is about testing for
the future for Rolls-Royce.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.460
We're now inside what
we call the prep shop.

00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.030
So this is where we
bring what essentially is

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:04.740
a built experimental engine,

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.950
but we're now bringing it in
here to get it ready for tests.

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:09.390
So this is where we put
the engine on our pylon,

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.260
so effectively we've made the engine think

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.550
it's fitted to an aircraft.

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:15.170
So that the reason for
the size of this building,

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:17.445
is to allow us to actually
manoeuvre the engines

00:16:17.445 --> 00:16:20.150
and get them ready, and with UltraFan,

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.490
clearly one of the largest
engines we've done,

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:24.610
particularly in terms of its fan size.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:25.680
- That's huge.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.400
Yesterday I was in Testbed
58, I was really impressed.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.280
But this is really
geared up for the future

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.740
generation of engine like the UltraFan.

00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:37.240
Much, much bigger and much,
much stronger capability.

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.340
- That's correct, this is a lot bigger.

00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:42.310
But again, bigger for a reason.

00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:45.110
The UltraFan, the fan size
is significantly larger.

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:47.350
We will be putting a
lot more slow-moving air

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:48.960
through this testbed.

00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:51.731
So again, this is all about
getting a smooth flow of air

00:16:51.731 --> 00:16:54.410
into that engine, and we can do big.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:56.320
Absolutely, we can do UltraFan,

00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.140
and clearly we've designed
it to do a little bit more.

00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.050
But the important thing
is we can also do small

00:17:01.050 --> 00:17:03.040
in this bed, as well,
so we can also go down

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.850
to much smaller engines.

00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:08.420
It will basically be able to
do every engine we make today,

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.043
and every engine we're
intending to make in the future

00:17:10.043 --> 00:17:12.430
at this point in time.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:13.550
- It's like a swimming pool.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:15.780
It's a bit, it isn't
actually a swimming pool.

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:17.220
So what this is about,

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:19.570
this is about we have a floor in here,

00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:22.160
and when we're testing,
the floor's down flat.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.010
But when we want to get to the engine,

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.780
because it's raised to such a height,

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.420
what this allows us to do is
we lift the entire floor up

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:31.030
to the engine, and this allows
us to work on the engine

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:32.680
while it's in the testbed,

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.370
and then we lower it back down again.

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.020
But yeah, absolutely, you can imagine

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.717
people do come in thinking it's our pool.

00:17:38.717 --> 00:17:42.380
But yeah, no, it's a floor
which comes up and down.

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.963
(upbeat music)

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:48.700
We've moved from the test cell.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.850
We're now into the first
section of the tube,

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.480
which is where we start to manage the air

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.650
coming out of the engine.

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:56.090
Anyone who's been at the airport,

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.360
you know what the noise is like.

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.640
And I think lots of people
probably have seen the videos

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:03.130
on YouTube of the people
standing at the airport fences

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.733
and seeing the power of
the engine as it takes off.

00:18:06.654 --> 00:18:09.237
(engines roar)

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:13.270
Clearly, we need to make
sure that we do something

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.500
about all that power, and
that's what this is doing.

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.570
So this is about a
five-and-a-half-meter section tube,

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.230
which has actually been
designed to allow us to slow

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:25.010
that air down as it comes
out the back of the engine.

00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:27.519
Again, so by the time it
actually leaves the test cell,

00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:29.869
people won't even realise
the engine's running.

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.660
This is effectively where the
air will leave the testbed.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:41.660
When we look at this we call it the basket

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.690
for obvious reasons.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.470
So this is where the air,
it's come out of the engine,

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.060
it's come through the big tube we've seen,

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:51.550
it comes into here which
is an eight-meter section.

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.770
And what we're doing here
is as the air is coming down

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:55.860
it's hitting that, what does look like

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.650
the front of an engine,
it's hitting that cone.

00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.500
But what that cone's then
doing is spreading the air out

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.810
throughout this space,
and again the idea is

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.950
we spread the air out,
we change its direction,

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:07.973
we slow it down, and the
air can then all lift up.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.520
This testbed you know,
build a testbed like this

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.230
probably every 10 to 15 years,

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.240
so from an engineer's point
of view this really is

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.110
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:20.080
So we've got people working on this

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.220
who are very, very
excited, 'cause they know

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.060
they're doing something for the future,

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:27.010
future generations, and
they know they may not get

00:19:27.010 --> 00:19:29.940
the opportunity again in their
career, so really exciting.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.660
- Then your legacy would
last for a lifetime.

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.648
- That's it, absolutely.
- Many more years to come,

00:19:33.648 --> 00:19:35.460
for such an engineering feat like this.

00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.853
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:19:37.976 --> 00:19:40.681
(air whooshing)

00:19:40.681 --> 00:19:41.748
(bell dings)

00:19:41.748 --> 00:19:44.248
(bubble pops)
