&gt;&gt; Stephen: HI, EVERYBODY.

00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:03.536 size:78% position:39%
WELCOME TO "A LATE SHOW."

00:00:03.569 --> 00:00:05.905 align:start position:0%
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A FIGHT
IN THE ROOM.

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:08.107
DO WE NEED TO CLEAN UP THE AREA?

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.477 align:start position:0%
I DON'T THINK SO BECAUSE YOU
CAN'T SEE IT.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.846 size:84% position:42%
I CAN AND I'M FINE WITH IT.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:15.448 size:84% position:42%
WELCOME TO "THE LATE SHOW."

00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.084
I'M YOUR HOST, STEPHEN COLBERT.

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:20.019
LAST NIGHT, I TALKED ABOUT THE
GOVERNORS WHO HAVE DECIDED TO

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:22.889 align:start position:0%
REOPEN THEIR STATES IN
OPPOSITION TO THE FEDERAL

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:27.393
GUIDELINES, BUT ONE DAY LATER,
I'M HAPPY TO REPORT THAT COOLER

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
HEADS HAVE PREVAILED IN OUR
NATION'S LEADERSHIP, BECAUSE THE

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.068
INSANE CLOWN POSSE IS CALLING
OFF ITS ANNUAL GATHERING OF THE

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.169 align:start position:0%
JUGGALOS FESTIVAL.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.970 align:start position:0%
THEY'VE ALSO OFFICIALLY
CHANGED THEIR NAME TO THE

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:39.138 align:start position:0%
RATIONAL CLOWN POSSE.

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:43.209 align:start position:0%
OF COURSE, THIS MOVE WILL
DISAPPOINT FANS OF I.C.P., KNOWN

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:46.879 align:start position:0%
AS "JUGGALOS," SEEN HERE
CONFUSING THEIR GRANDPARENTS.

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:54.187 size:88% position:44%
YESTERDAY, THE CLOWN POSSE'S
RECORD LABEL, PSYCHOPATHIC

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.124 align:start position:0%
RECORDS, ISSUED A STATEMENT:
"WITH THOUSANDS OF DEATHS DURING

00:00:58.157 --> 00:01:04.130
THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK, WE REFUSE
TO RISK EVEN ONE JUGGALO LIFE BY

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:09.735 align:start position:0%
HOSTING A GATHERING DURING THESE
TROUBLING TIMES."

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:12.305 align:start position:0%
SO, THESE GUYS RESPECT SCIENCE
MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR OF

00:01:12.338 --> 00:01:13.206 align:start position:0%
GEORGIA.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:14.207 align:start position:0%
MAKES SENSE.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.241 align:start position:0%
THEY'VE ALWAYS WANTED
EXPLANATIONS BASED ON HARD

00:01:15.274 --> 00:01:17.777 align:start position:0%
SCIENCE.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.047
&gt;&gt; WATER, FIRE, AIR AND DIRT.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.514 align:start position:0%
(  BLEEP  ) MAGNETS.

00:01:21.547 --> 00:01:25.318 align:start position:0%
HOW DO THEY WORK?

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.087
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YOU KNOW WHO I WISH
BELIEVED IN SCIENCE AS MUCH AS

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.722 align:start position:0%
THE INSANE CLOWN POSSE?

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.157 size:84% position:42%
THE INSANE CLOWN PRESIDENT.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.759 align:start position:0%
IT TURNS OUT THAT THE DIRECTOR
OF THE LEAD FEDERAL AGENCY

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:37.797 align:start position:0%
SEARCHING FOR A CORONAVIRUS
VACCINE WAS FIRED BECAUSE OF HIS

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.737 align:start position:0%
CONCERN ABOUT TRUMP'S
CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT THEORY.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.540 align:start position:0%
DR. TRUMP IS CANNING MEDICAL
EXPERTS JUST BECAUSE THEY

00:01:47.573 --> 00:01:49.775 align:start position:0%
DISAGREE WITH HIS RANDOM NOTIONS
OF HEALTH.

00:01:49.808 --> 00:01:52.145
YOU KNOW ANY DAY NOW, THE NEW
FOOD PYRAMID IS GOING TO LOOK

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:55.882 align:start position:0%
LIKE THIS.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.084 align:start position:0%
THE OFFICIAL IN QUESTION IS
FORMER DIRECTOR OF THE

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:05.358 size:88% position:44%
BIOMEDICAL ADVANCED RESEARCH
AND DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY AN

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:10.897 align:start position:0%
HUSKY ANDERSON COOPER, DR. RICK
BRIGHT.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.131 align:start position:0%
TRUMP FIRED A GUY NAMED
"DR. BRIGHT."

00:02:12.164 --> 00:02:16.202 align:start position:0%
HE ALSO LET GO PROFESSOR SMARTY,
DR. SAVIOR, AND SECRETARY "I

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:17.803
HAVE THE CURE DON'T FIRE ME."

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:21.374
APPARENTLY, BEHIND THE SCENES,
DR. BRIGHT OPPOSED THE CURE THAT

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:21.874 align:start position:0%
TRUMP LIKES.

00:02:21.908 --> 00:02:25.845 align:start position:0%
WHAT WAS THAT AGAIN?

00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:28.347 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; CHLOROQUINE, OR
HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.848 size:75% position:38%
THE HYDROXY-CHLOROQUINE.

00:02:28.881 --> 00:02:29.782 align:start position:0%
THE CHLOROQUINE.

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:35.922 size:75% position:38%
THE HYDROXY-CHLOROQUINE.

00:02:35.955 --> 00:02:37.823
HYDROXY... CHLOR... CHLOROQUINE.

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:39.325 size:78% position:39%
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO LOSE?

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:40.126 align:start position:0%
TAKE IT.

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.728 align:start position:0%
I REALLY THINK THEY SHOULD TAKE
IT.

00:02:42.761 --> 00:02:44.597 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: IT'S THE MOST
BLATANT PRESIDENTIAL

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.601 size:84% position:42%
DRUG-PUSHING SINCE THE 1956
CAMPAIGN, "IKE LIKES COKE."

00:02:48.634 --> 00:02:50.102 align:start position:0%
TRUMP'S BEEN PUSHING THIS EVEN
THOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO

00:02:50.135 --> 00:02:52.205 align:start position:0%
CONCLUSIVE RESEARCH.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:55.308
AFTER GETTING FIRED, DR. BRIGHT
SAID, "I BELIEVE THIS WAS IN

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:57.843 align:start position:0%
RESPONSE TO MY INSISTENCE THAT
THE GOVERNMENT INVEST THE

00:02:57.876 --> 00:03:01.948
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ALLOCATED BY
CONGRESS TO ADDRESS THE COVID-19

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:05.885 align:start position:0%
PANDEMIC INTO SAFE AND
SCIENTIFICALLY VETTED SOLUTIONS,

00:03:05.918 --> 00:03:08.054
AND NOT IN DRUGS, VACCINES AND
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT LACK

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:09.855 align:start position:0%
SCIENTIFIC MERIT."

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:13.859 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"HEY, LOOK, MY IDEAS DON'T LACK

00:03:13.892 --> 00:03:15.728 align:start position:0%
SCIENTIFIC MERIT.

00:03:15.761 --> 00:03:16.295 align:start position:0%
THEY LACK ANY MERIT.

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:19.832 align:start position:0%
READY FOR ANOTHER?

00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:21.200 align:start position:0%
BOOF SOME LISTERINE.

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:21.901 align:start position:0%
COULDN'T HURT.

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.202 align:start position:0%
I MEAN, IT STINGS.

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:26.906 align:start position:0%
BUT THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW IT'S
WORKING."

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:32.111
EVEN WITH DR. BRIGHT GONE, THE
PRESIDENT ISN'T WITHOUT ADVICE,

00:03:32.144 --> 00:03:35.982 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE TRUMP REGULARLY TELLS
VISITORS TO THE OVAL OFFICE THAT

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:38.117
HE IS IN TOUCH WITH DOCTORS IN
NEW YORK, INCLUDING HIS OWN, WHO

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.286
YOU'LL REMEMBER LOOKS LIKE THIS.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.887 align:start position:0%
"HELLO!

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.291 align:start position:0%
I'M DR. KOOKY.

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:47.360 align:start position:0%
MAYBE WE CAN CURE THE
CORONAVIRUS WITH THESE LOOSE

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.895 align:start position:0%
PILLS I FOUND IN THE CUPHOLDER
OF MY CAMRY.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:50.663 size:78% position:39%
ONE OF THEM IS A GEL CAP.

00:03:50.696 --> 00:03:59.105 size:81% position:41%
IT'S GOT TO DO SOMETHING."

00:03:59.138 --> 00:03:59.539 align:start position:0%
DIGNITY.

00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.706 align:start position:0%
ALWAYS DIGNITY.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.874 align:start position:0%
DR. BRIGHT'S NOT THE ONLY EXPERT
THAT TRUMP IS SHUTTING UP.

00:04:01.908 --> 00:04:06.646
ENTER C.D.C. DIRECTOR AND MAN
PASSIONATELY DESCRIBING HIS

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:07.780
STOLEN MARACAS, ROBERT REDFIELD.

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:11.484
ON TUESDAY, DR. REDFIELD TOLD
THE "WASHINGTON POST" THAT

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:13.886 align:start position:0%
"THERE'S A POSSIBILITY THAT THE
ASSAULT OF THE VIRUS ON OUR

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.491
NATION NEXT WINTER WILL ACTUALLY
BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT THAN THE

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:19.692 size:81% position:41%
ONE WE JUST WENT THROUGH."

00:04:19.725 --> 00:04:22.928
AND IF YOU DON'T REMEMBER HOW
DIFFICULT THIS WINTER WAS, IT

00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:25.865 align:start position:0%
HAD TRUMP'S ACQUITTAL, THE
AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES, AND "CATS:

00:04:25.898 --> 00:04:28.367 align:start position:0%
THE MOVIE."

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.170 size:88% position:44%
REDFIELD SAID IT WOULD BE A
TOUGH WINTER BECAUSE WE'D BE

00:04:31.203 --> 00:04:35.474 align:start position:0%
FIGHTING A FLU EPIDEMIC AND A
CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC AT THE SAME

00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:37.109 align:start position:0%
TIME.

00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:39.478 align:start position:0%
AND REDFIELD ADDED THAT IT
HASN'T BEEN EASY EXPLAINING THIS

00:04:39.511 --> 00:04:41.013 align:start position:0%
TO EVERYONE.

00:04:41.046 --> 00:04:43.549 align:start position:0%
"WHEN I'VE SAID THIS TO OTHERS,
THEY KIND OF PUT THEIR HEAD

00:04:43.582 --> 00:04:46.819 align:start position:0%
BACK, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT
I MEAN."

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:49.488 align:start position:0%
(AS REDFIELD)
"YES... 'OTHERS' GOT VERY

00:04:49.521 --> 00:04:50.722 align:start position:0%
CONFUSED.

00:04:50.756 --> 00:04:54.527
'OTHERS' STOPPED LISTENING TO
ME, TURNED ON SOME CARTOONS AND

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.098 align:start position:0%
I HAD TO SAY, "THIS IS
IMPORTANT, PRESIDENT OTHERS."

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:00.199 size:84% position:42%
OTHERS WASN'T HAPPY ABOUT
REDFIELD SAYING THIS TO THE

00:05:00.232 --> 00:05:03.436 align:start position:0%
"WASHINGTON POST."

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:05.604
SO HE SUMMONED DR. REDFIELD TO
HIS DAILY PRESS BRIEFING, AND

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:09.909 align:start position:0%
SAID THERE'S A SIMPLE
EXPLANATION.

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:12.445 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; DR. ROBERT REDFIELD WAS
TOTALLY MISQUOTED IN THE MEDIA

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:17.750 align:start position:0%
ON HIS STATEMENT ABOUT THE FALL
SEASON AND THE VIRUS.

00:05:17.783 --> 00:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
TOTALLY MISQUOTED.

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
I SPOKE TO HIM AND HE SAID IT
WAS RIDICULOUS.

00:05:21.553 --> 00:05:24.523 align:start position:0%
HE WAS MISQUOTED, TOTALLY
MISQUOTED.

00:05:24.556 --> 00:05:25.925 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OKAY, I GUESS HE WAS
TOTALLY MISQUOTED IN THE

00:05:25.958 --> 00:05:28.260 align:start position:0%
"WASHINGTON POST."

00:05:28.293 --> 00:05:30.830 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I AM ACCURATELY QUOTED IN THE
"WASHINGTON POST."

00:05:30.863 --> 00:05:31.998 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: THERE YOU GO.

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:34.667
IT'S A CASE OF HE-SAID... YEAH
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE SAID.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:37.903 align:start position:0%
REDFIELD THEN TRIED TO EXPLAIN
THAT HE HAD BEEN RIGHT ALL

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:39.205 size:78% position:39%
ALONG-- BUT SO HAD TRUMP.

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:43.008 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I THINK IT IS REALLY
IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE WHAT I

00:05:43.041 --> 00:05:43.976 align:start position:0%
DIDN'T SAY.

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.246 align:start position:0%
I DIDN'T SAY THAT THIS WAS GOING
TO BE "WORSE."

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.248 align:start position:0%
I SAID IT WAS GOING TO BE
COMPLICA-- OR MORE DIFFICULT.

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:53.719 align:start position:0%
DOESN'T MEAN IT'LL BE MORE
IMPOSSIBLE.

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:56.455
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOING TO BE
MORE, AS SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID,

00:05:56.488 --> 00:05:59.024 align:start position:0%
"WORSE," IT JUST MEANS MORE
DIFFICULT.

00:05:59.057 --> 00:06:00.192
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: HOW CAN SOMETHING
THAT'S MORE DIFFICULT NOT BE

00:06:00.225 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
WORSE?

00:06:01.393 --> 00:06:03.596 align:start position:0%
"I DIDN'T SAY NINE WAS BIGGER
THAN SEVEN.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.600
I JUST SAID IT WAS MORE NUMBER.

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.769 align:start position:0%
IT'S ADDITIONAL MANYS."

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:11.570
TRUMP WENT ONE STEP FURTHER AND
SAID NEXT YEAR'S VIRUS WON'T BE

00:06:11.603 --> 00:06:12.838 align:start position:0%
WORSE.

00:06:12.871 --> 00:06:15.608
THEE MAY NOT A BE VIRUS AT ALL.

00:06:15.641 --> 00:06:17.543 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; IF THE CORONA COMES BACK.

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:18.577 align:start position:0%
AND HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IF IT
IS GOING TO.

00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:21.013 size:81% position:41%
IT IS ESTIMATED IT MIGHT
NOT COME BACK AT ALL, JIM.

00:06:21.046 --> 00:06:22.047
IT MIGHT NOT COME BACK AT ALL.

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:24.283 align:start position:0%
I PERSONALLY HOPE IT DOESN'T
COME BACK IN THE FALL.

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:26.752 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YOU HOPE?

00:06:26.785 --> 00:06:30.022 align:start position:0%
MR. PRESIDENT, HOPE IS NOT A
PLAN.

00:06:30.055 --> 00:06:31.590
I HOPE YOU DON'T COME BACK IN
THE FALL, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

00:06:31.623 --> 00:06:35.594 align:start position:0%
I HAVEN'T STOCKPILED...

00:06:35.627 --> 00:06:42.435 size:78% position:39%
MEDICINE, IN CASE YOU DO.

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:43.602 align:start position:0%
MMM.

00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:45.337 align:start position:0%
MASSIVE DOSES.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.405 align:start position:0%
STILL, HEARING THAT THE VIRUS
MAY NOT COME BACK WAS

00:06:46.438 --> 00:06:47.573 align:start position:0%
COMFORTING...

00:06:47.606 --> 00:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
FOR A WHILE.

00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.009 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WE WILL HAVE CORONAVIRUS IN
THE FALL.

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:52.344 align:start position:0%
I AM CONVINCED OF THAT.

00:06:52.377 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
THERE WILL BE CORONAVIRUS IN THE
FALL.

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:55.948
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: SO WE JUST BETTER
PRAY THAT CORONAVIRUS IS CURED

00:06:55.981 --> 00:06:58.417 align:start position:0%
BY PUMPKIN SPICE.

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:03.489 align:start position:0%
BUT DON'T THINK THE PRESIDENT
DOESN'T VALUE EXPERTISE.

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:04.690 align:start position:0%
OH, NO.

00:07:04.723 --> 00:07:06.058 align:start position:0%
WE JUST FOUND OUT THAT SECRETARY
OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:08.294 align:start position:0%
ALEX AZAR TAPPED A FORMER DOG

CORONAVIRUS.

00:07:13.165 --> 00:07:15.668

MY DOG BENNY IS AVAILABLE.

00:07:25.311 --> 00:07:27.179 align:start position:0%
TECHNICALLY, HE'S A DOG BREEDER,

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:35.321 align:start position:0%
SAY HI TO THE PEOPLE.

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:36.422 align:start position:0%
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS OF HOW TO
FIGHT THE CORONAVIRUS?

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:37.356 align:start position:0%
WHAT'S THAT?

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:38.624 align:start position:0%
GIVE YOU MORE TURKEY?

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:41.126
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT WOULD HELP,
BUT AS A GREAT MAN ONCE SAID...

00:07:41.159 --> 00:07:48.534 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHAT THE HELL DO YOU HAVE TO
LOSE?

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:51.470 align:start position:0%

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:53.572 align:start position:0%
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:07:53.606 --> 00:07:56.575 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE HEAD OF
INFECTIOUS DISEASE.

00:07:56.608 --> 00:07:57.510 align:start position:0%
THAT'S RIGHT.

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:00.212 align:start position:0%

00:08:04.383 --> 00:08:05.451 align:start position:0%
HE'S GOING TO GO STRAIGHT FOR MY

00:08:05.484 --> 00:08:07.319 size:88% position:44%
THE DOG BREEDER IN CHARGE OF
KEEPING YOU ALIVE IS BRIAN

HARRISON, AND UNTIL 2018, HE RAN

00:08:14.059 --> 00:08:17.096 align:start position:0%
NOW WE KNOW WHO CROSS-BRED
TRUMP'S HAIR.

00:08:17.129 --> 00:08:20.065
TRUMP'S GOTTEN A LOT CRITICISM
FOR HOW HE'S HANDLED THE CRISIS,

00:08:20.098 --> 00:08:25.170 align:start position:0%
BUT YESTERDAY HE UNVEILED A NEW
PLAN TO FIX EVERYTHING.

00:08:25.203 --> 00:08:29.174
&gt;&gt; I AM EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE
THAT IN THE COMING WEEKS, THE

00:08:29.207 --> 00:08:35.548
AIR FORCE THUNDERBIRDS ARE
INCREDIBLE, AND THE NAVY BLUE

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:39.518 align:start position:0%
ANGELS, EQUALLY INCREDIBLE, WILL
BE PERFORMING AIR SHOWS OVER

00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:41.153
AMERICA'S MAJOR CITIES AND SOME
OF THE CITIES THAT AREN'T MAJOR

00:08:41.186 --> 00:08:43.689 align:start position:0%
CITIES.

00:08:43.722 --> 00:08:45.724 align:start position:0%
WE'RE PAYING TRIBUTE TO OUR
FRONT LINE HEALTH CARE WORKERS

00:08:45.757 --> 00:08:49.361 align:start position:0%
CONFRONTING COVID.

00:08:49.394 --> 00:08:51.564 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.

00:08:51.597 --> 00:08:53.032 align:start position:0%
HE'S FIGHTING A
RESPIRATORY VIRUS WITH OUR

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:54.033 align:start position:0%
MILITARY.

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.201 align:start position:0%
JUST LIKE IN THE TOM CRUISE
CLASSIC, "TOP LUNG."

00:08:56.234 --> 00:08:58.304 align:start position:0%
BUT A JET PLANE FLY-BY ISN'T
JUST FUN AND GAMES:

00:08:58.337 --> 00:09:00.506 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEY'RE GOING TO BEE DOING
A LOT OF WORK, A LOT OF

00:09:00.539 --> 00:09:01.607 align:start position:0%
DANGEROUS FLYING.

00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.244 align:start position:0%
IT'S DANGEROUS, YOU KNOW
THE ODDS WHEN YOU START GOING

00:09:05.277 --> 00:09:09.882
AT MASSIVE SPEEDS AND YOU ARE
18 INCHES AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:10.382 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: 18 INCHES?

00:09:10.415 --> 00:09:12.051 align:start position:0%
THAT IS DANGEROUS.

00:09:12.084 --> 00:09:15.020 align:start position:0%
THOSE PLANES SHOULD BE FLYING AT
LEAST SIX FEET APART.

00:09:15.053 --> 00:09:19.525 align:start position:0%
AND YOU CAN'T GO OUTSIDE TO
WATCH IT.

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.827 align:start position:0%
IN ORDER TO AVOID DRAWING
CROWDS, THE PLANES WILL AVOID

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.330 align:start position:0%
FLYING OVER AREAS WHERE PEOPLE
CAN CONGREGATE.

00:09:24.363 --> 00:09:27.633 align:start position:0%
SO, YOU'LL JUST GET TO HEAR THEM
ROAR OVERHEAD.

00:09:27.666 --> 00:09:31.537 align:start position:0%
ALL IN ALL, A BEAUTIFUL TRIBUTE:
BRIEFLY GIVING EACH AND EVERY

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:36.308
AMERICAN THE SENSE OF WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO LIVE NEAR LAGUARDIA.

00:09:36.341 --> 00:09:39.311
DURING THE PANDEMIC, CONGRESS
HAS BEEN APPROVING MONEY FOR

00:09:39.344 --> 00:09:40.512 size:84% position:42%
STATES THAT ARE STRUGGLING.

00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:43.916 align:start position:0%
BUT THAT COULD ALL END SOON,
THANKS TO SENATE MAJORITY LEADER

00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
AND PROFILE IN PORRIDGE, MITCH
MCCONNELL.

00:09:48.153 --> 00:09:50.589 align:start position:0%
YESTERDAY, MCCONNELL SAID THAT
INSTEAD OF GETTING ANY MORE

00:09:50.622 --> 00:09:51.957 align:start position:0%
MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT, STATES SHOULD

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.225 align:start position:0%
CONSIDER BANKRUPTCY.

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:59.164 align:start position:0%
BANKRUPTCY?

00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:00.065 align:start position:0%
REALLY?

00:10:00.098 --> 00:10:01.867 align:start position:0%
THEY'RE AMERICAN STATES, NOT
TRUMP CASINOS.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.536
UNSURPRISINGLY, MCCONNELL'S
"SCREW THE STATES" PLAN ISN'T

00:10:04.569 --> 00:10:05.704 align:start position:0%
VERY
POPULAR WITH THE STATES.

00:10:05.737 --> 00:10:08.874
NOT EVEN AMONG CONSERVATIVES.

00:10:08.907 --> 00:10:11.944
LAST NIGHT, NEW YORK REPUBLICAN
CONGRESSMAN PETER KING TWEETED

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:15.014 align:start position:0%
THAT TAKING AWAY FUNDING FOR
"COPS, FIREFIGHTERS AND

WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?

00:10:24.589 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
