00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.200
Let’s bring in Lynda LaCasse, the former
neighbor of Tara Reade, who has accused Democratic

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.629
presidential candidate Joe Biden of sexual
assault.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:10.730
Tara Reade accused him in 1993.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.510
We just played the clip of Tara describing
what happened.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:27.060
Lynda LaCasse came forward just recently in
the Business Insider piece and has corroborated

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.150
Tara Reade’s account.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.779
Lynda, this is your first time speaking on
television about this.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.010
Can you tell us what happened in the mid-1990s?

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.410
How did you know Tara?

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.100
And then tell us what she told you and why
you’re coming forward today.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.920
Well, Tara was my next-door neighbor.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:53.390
I moved into the apartment right next to her,
and we became close at that time.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.320
And we actually — she told me about it when
we were having a conversation.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:11.300
And so, as Rich put forth in the article in
the Business Insider, I was having a moment

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.620
— I was outside, and I had just received
some papers, and I was upset about them.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.890
And she came over.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:31.780
And we were talking about violence, because
I had experienced violence myself.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.950
And she started telling me about Joe Biden
and what he had done.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:46.320
And basically, she told me that he put his
— he put her up against a wall, and he put

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.979
his hand up her skirt, and he put his fingers
inside her.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.960
And she was very distraught, and she was very
upset, and she was crying.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.330
And that’s how that conversation happened.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.760
We were just sitting on my front stoop in
front of my apartment.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.000
And what year was this that you had that conversation?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:23.370
Well, it was either 1994 or very early — yeah,
I’m sorry, 1995 or early 1996.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.280
And, Lynda, if you could talk about your response
at the time?

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.850
She told you — did she tell you it was Senator
Biden who she had worked for?

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.220
She did.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.750
She did tell me that.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.730
And, you know, I really didn’t pay that
much attention at the time.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.610
I didn’t really care much about politics.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.120
I didn’t — I knew she worked for him.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.050
I didn’t know really who he was much.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.090
I didn’t put that much importance on it.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.430
So…

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.319
So, can you talk about why you’ve decided
to come forward now?

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.099
I understand you’re a Biden supporter.

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.099
Is that right?

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.280
That’s correct.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.670
I’m a strong, lifelong Democrat, and I am
a Biden supporter.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:31.150
And, you know, I didn’t know about — I
didn’t know about all the stuff that was

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.660
going on in the news.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.209
She told me about it last month.

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:47.160
She called me, and she told me that she had
decided to come forward with it.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.540
And I said — and she told me about the allegations.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.000
And I said, “Oh, yes, I remember that.”

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:03.410
So, then we talked again a little over a week
ago, and I volunteered to come forward.

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:12.450
And again, you know, I’ve worked so much,
I hadn’t really had time to pay as much

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.420
attention as I could have.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.949
But I did volunteer to come forward.

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:26.789
And the reason I volunteered to come forward
is just I feel that the truth needs to be

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:29.099
told, and her truth needs to be told.

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:37.219
I believed her back then, when she told me,
and I believe her now.

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:43.289
And just talk about how you mesh believing
her now, that she was sexually assaulted by

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.930
her boss, by Senator Joe Biden — that’s
her allegation — if you believe her, why

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.770
you support him.

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.189
It’s a difficult thing.

00:04:56.189 --> 00:05:00.319
I’ve always supported him.

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:06.860
And I just have to keep supporting him now.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:12.199
And it’s a little bit harder now, after
this allegation.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:23.659
I’m a definite anti-Trumper, so I’m having
a little bit of a hard time with it.

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:28.900
So, but mostly it’s an anti-Trump thing.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:37.719
And, you know, I saw him on Morning Joe this
morning, and he looks very believable, too.

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:44.879
But I’m hearing this today, and I heard
Tara a long time ago telling me that.

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:53.219
So, I’m struggling with it, with the election
now.

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:56.719
But I’m not — I’m still going to vote
for him.
