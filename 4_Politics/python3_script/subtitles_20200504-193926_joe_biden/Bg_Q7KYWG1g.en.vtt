00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:03.254
 - The wisest person I have ever met, 

00:00:03.254 --> 00:00:05.087
 He is someone who has left school in the third grade 

00:00:06.114 --> 00:00:08.211
 The words "wisdom" and "quit learning" are in one sentence 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.666
 This is very paradoxical. 

00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:10.797
 Like "Jumbo Shrink". 

00:00:10.797 --> 00:00:13.061
 (Jumbo Shrink is a sports team and here it mocks the team's name) 

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:13.896
 Mmm 

00:00:13.896 --> 00:00:15.969
 (Audience laughing) 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.285
 As an enjoyable tour 

00:00:17.285 --> 00:00:18.472
 But it has nothing interesting 

00:00:18.472 --> 00:00:20.645
 (Audience laughing) 

00:00:20.645 --> 00:00:24.010
 Like Microsoft works. You did not hear that from me. (Making fun of Microsoft) 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.769
 (Audience laughing) 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.747
 I used to say I love country music 

00:00:27.747 --> 00:00:29.623
 But I have lived in Texas a long time 

00:00:29.623 --> 00:00:31.245
 I love music now. 

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:32.645
 (Cheering the audience) 

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:33.870
 Yes 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.462
 I hunt, hunt fish, I have cowboy boots, cowboys, 

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:38.960
 Yes, everyone, hear that. 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.181
 Do you hear what I tell you? 

00:00:41.181 --> 00:00:42.789
 (Audience laughing) 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.266
 This is no longer a contradiction for me to say country music. 

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.074
 It is not a contradiction for me to say 

00:00:48.074 --> 00:00:50.436
 Third grade, leaving education. 

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:51.399
 This is the person who left his education in the third grade 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.304
 He is the wisest person I have ever met 

00:00:53.304 --> 00:00:58.840
 He taught me to combine knowledge and wisdom to make an impact 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.460
 My father was. 

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:01.628
 Simple cooker. 

00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:04.974
 The wisest man I have ever met. 

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:06.571
 Just a simple cook. 

00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:07.722
 He left school in the third grade 

00:01:07.722 --> 00:01:08.989
 To help on the family farm 

00:01:08.989 --> 00:01:10.450
 But only because he left school 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.759
 Not to stop learning. 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:13.662
 Mark Twain once said 

00:01:13.662 --> 00:01:16.780
 "I have never allowed school education to prevent my education." 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.440
 My father taught himself to read, 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.920
 Teach himself how to write. 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.060
 I decided in the midst of apartheid, 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.260
 When America was breathing the last moments of the Civil War, 

00:01:25.264 --> 00:01:28.303
 My father decided that he would stand up and be a man, 

00:01:28.303 --> 00:01:31.900
 Not a black man, not a brown man, not a white man, 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.900
 But a man 

00:01:34.028 --> 00:01:38.924
 He literally challenged himself to be the best he could 

00:01:38.924 --> 00:01:41.508
 All the days of his life. 

00:01:41.508 --> 00:01:43.104
 I have four grades (the highest average at the university) and my brother is a judge. 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.842
 We are not the smartest in our family. 

00:01:47.842 --> 00:01:50.179
 It is my father who left school in the third grade 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:52.115
 The parent who left school in the third grade 

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:54.054
 Who was quoting Michelangelo, telling us: 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.340
 My son, I have no problem if I have a lot of chaos. But I will face a lot of problems if I don't drop and strike me. ” 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.399
 A rural mother quotes Henry Ford says: 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.745
 "If you think you can, or if you think you cannot, then you are right." 

00:02:06.767 --> 00:02:09.952
 From that guy who left school in the third grade, I learned simple lessons, lessons like this. 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.940
 "My son, come early for an hour, rather than late and accurate." 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.160
 We never knew how much time was in our house, because the hours were always advanced. 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.500
 My mother said: For nearly thirty years, my father was leaving the house at 3:45 am. 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.300
 One day I asked him: "Why, Dad?" 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.540
 He said: "Maybe one of my children will be excellent like me. 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.240
 I want to share two things with you. 

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:30.770
 Aristotle said: You are what you do over and over again, 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.319
 Therefore, excellence should be a habit, not an act. 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:35.883
 Never forget that. 

00:02:35.883 --> 00:02:38.733
 I know you are firm but always remember to be gentle. 

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:39.567
 Always. 

00:02:39.567 --> 00:02:41.159
 Never forget that 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.439
 Never embarrass your mother 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:44.272
 Mhmm. 

00:02:44.272 --> 00:02:45.371
 (The audience laughs) 

00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:48.517
 Yes, if the mother is not happy, then no one is happy. 

00:02:48.517 --> 00:02:50.599
 If my father is not happy, then nobody cares, but you know-- 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:51.432
 (The audience laughs) 

00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:52.349
 I tell you. 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:54.289
 The next lesson, 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.490
 A lesson from the chef, over there in the kitchen. 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.880
 Brown, remember that your worker’s towel is bigger than your ego. 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.038
 Vanity is the anesthesia that relieves stupidity. 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.640
 Now all of you are thinking about someone you want to send this clip to, 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.640
 So let me say it again. 

00:03:10.647 --> 00:03:12.272
 (The audience laughs) 

00:03:12.272 --> 00:03:15.441
 Vanity is the anesthesia that relieves stupidity. 

00:03:15.441 --> 00:03:17.063
 Pride is a load of a stupid person. 

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:20.394
 John Wooden was coach of the basketball team 

00:03:20.394 --> 00:03:22.531
 But his mission was to influence people. 

00:03:22.531 --> 00:03:24.683
 In the midst of the national championship and ongoing matches 

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:27.194
 Guess what he was doing in the middle of the week? 

00:03:27.194 --> 00:03:28.171
 He goes to the dressing room 

00:03:28.171 --> 00:03:32.426
 Hold the broom and wipe the club floor. 

00:03:32.426 --> 00:03:34.310
 Do you want to make an impact? 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:35.700
 Find your broom. 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.540
 Every day of your life, you have to find your broom. 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.060
 This is how you can improve your impact. 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.720
 This way you will attract people so that you can influence them. 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.440
 The last lesson. 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.300
 "Son, you will do a job, do it to the fullest, do it the best way." 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.340
 I have always been told how I can be normal. 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.200
 Always prepared to be normal. 

00:04:03.204 --> 00:04:04.948
 But I want to tell you something 

00:04:04.948 --> 00:04:06.863
 I am standing here in front of you, 

00:04:06.863 --> 00:04:08.489
 Before all these people 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.942
 I don’t hear these words, 

00:04:10.942 --> 00:04:13.916
 But I tell myself every day, because I seek the stars, to be the best I can be. 

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:19.106
 Being good enough is not enough ... 

00:04:19.106 --> 00:04:20.333
 If you could be better. 

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.608
 To be better is not enough ... 

00:04:21.608 --> 00:04:23.300
 If you can be the best. 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.220
 Let me close with a very personal story that I think will focus all of you. 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.640
 Wisdom will come to you in the worst way. 

00:04:31.642 --> 00:04:33.321
 And often through failure. 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:41.760
 When you get to the bottom Remember this, while you struggle and suffer, remember that the bottom can also be a great basis for building and growing on it. 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.120
 I am not worried about being successful, I am concerned that you may not fail from time to time. 

00:04:49.157 --> 00:04:52.848
 The person who rises up some of his downfall and follows his progress 

00:04:52.848 --> 00:04:56.680
 He is the one who will continue to grow and influence. 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.120
 In the seventies, 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.560
 In order to be able to clarify my point, I want to introduce you to someone. 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.880
 I met the coolest woman I had ever met. 

00:05:05.881 --> 00:05:06.714
 Mhmm. 

00:05:06.714 --> 00:05:07.898
 (Audience laughter) 

00:05:07.898 --> 00:05:11.206
 In my day we used to call it the marble house. 

00:05:11.206 --> 00:05:14.839
 (Audience laughter) 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:16.952
 This woman was the best woman I've ever seen. 

00:05:16.952 --> 00:05:18.276
 There is one small problem 

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.571
 At that time, the women did not like the team's defender. 

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.094
 Blindside had not been released at the time. 

00:05:23.094 --> 00:05:25.391
 (Audience laughter) 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.383
 They loved the spring player and the striker. 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.800
 We were in a dance and discovered her name, Trina Williams, from Lombok, California 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.595
 We were all dancing 

00:05:33.595 --> 00:05:35.760
 We are excited 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.630
 I decide in the middle of dancing with her 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.438
 I am asking her about her phone number. 

00:05:39.438 --> 00:05:41.339
 Trina was the first 

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:44.280
 Trina was the only woman in college who gave me her real phone number 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.160
 (The audience laughs) 

00:05:46.177 --> 00:05:48.541
 The next day we walked to Baskin and Robins 

00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:49.945
 Ice cream salon. 

00:05:49.945 --> 00:05:51.538
 My friends did not believe it. 

00:05:51.538 --> 00:05:53.476
 This was 40 years ago 

00:05:53.476 --> 00:05:55.130
 And my friends still can't believe it. 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.263
 (Audience laughter) 

00:05:56.263 --> 00:05:58.105
 We go on a second date 

00:05:58.105 --> 00:06:00.011
 And a third date 

00:06:00.011 --> 00:06:02.075
 And a fourth date. 

00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:02.908
 Mhmm. 

00:06:02.908 --> 00:06:04.354
 (Audience laughter) 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.520
 We drive from Chico to Vallejo so you can meet my parents. 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.911
 My father meets her. 

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.762
 My dad, my hero, meets her, 

00:06:12.762 --> 00:06:15.268
 He pulls me to the side and asks me, "Is she psychologically upset?" (He wants to say that his father didn't believe this woman really loved him) 

00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:16.101
 But anyway-- 

00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:17.471
 (The audience laughs) 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.960
 We stayed together for one year, two years, three years, four years 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.000
 And she showed us last year in college. 

00:06:22.004 --> 00:06:22.995
 I am still a student 

00:06:22.995 --> 00:06:24.812
 But I do some things 

00:06:24.812 --> 00:06:26.691
 (The audience laughs) 

00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:29.351
 I am so glad I graduated in four semesters. 

00:06:29.351 --> 00:06:31.292
 Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan. 

00:06:31.292 --> 00:06:33.713
 (The audience laughs) 

00:06:33.713 --> 00:06:35.805
 So now it is time to ask for marriage. 

00:06:35.805 --> 00:06:37.636
 So she talked to her friends 

00:06:37.636 --> 00:06:39.237
 It's California, in the seventies. 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.720
 So you have to be outside, you have to have a candle, and you have to have some chocolate. 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.400
 Listen, I'm from the neighborhood, and I had a Bonny Farm bottle of wine. 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.520
 This is what I had. 

00:06:47.536 --> 00:06:48.777
 (Audience laughter) 

00:06:48.777 --> 00:06:50.560
 She said yes! 

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.497
 This was the key. 

00:06:52.497 --> 00:06:53.746
 She got married to the most beautiful woman 

00:06:53.746 --> 00:06:55.070
 I saw her in my life 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.240
 Everyone who was at a wedding even before the wedding could hear people say 

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.199
 "How is this possible?" 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:03.470
 (The audience laughs) 

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:06.456
 This question was coming from guests from my family's side. 

00:07:06.456 --> 00:07:09.456
 (The audience laughs) 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.360
 We get married, have children, and our lives have been wonderful. 

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.223
 One day, Trina found a bump in her left chest 

00:07:19.223 --> 00:07:20.999
 breast cancer. 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:28.200
 Six years after this diagnosis, my two little boys and I walked into her funeral. 

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.960
 And for two years my heart had no pulse. 

00:07:30.973 --> 00:07:34.120
 If I hadn't believed in God, I wouldn't have stood here today 

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:40.200
 If I had not had these two little boys, I would have had no reason to complete my life. 

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.320
 I was completely lost. 

00:07:44.034 --> 00:07:45.784
 This was the bottom. 

00:07:46.873 --> 00:07:48.874
 Do you know what drove me? 

00:07:48.874 --> 00:07:51.696
 The wisdom of the man who left school in the third grade. 

00:07:51.696 --> 00:07:54.029
 The wisdom of a simple cook. 

00:07:54.922 --> 00:07:56.236
 We were at the funeral 

00:07:56.236 --> 00:07:58.418
 I have never seen my father cry. 

00:07:58.418 --> 00:07:59.852
 But this time I saw my dad crying. 

00:07:59.852 --> 00:08:00.810
 That was his daughter. 

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:02.230
 She showed us his daughter 

00:08:02.230 --> 00:08:03.751
 His daughter is not in law. 

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.920
 And I was completely behind my father, about to see her last time in this world 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.200
 My father told me three words that changed my life there at the funeral. 

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:15.480
 This was the last lesson he taught me. 

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:24.760
 He said: "My son, just stand up, keep standing, keep standing no matter how severe the waves, so keep standing on your feet. 

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.960
 "And I'm not just talking about water. Keep on standing no matter how you never give up." 

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:38.080
 These were some of her last words to me as well, and I'll see you today. 

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:47.880
 She looked into my eyes and said: "It doesn't matter to me how much I will live. What matters most to me is how I live." 

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.160
 I ask you all one question, 

00:08:50.164 --> 00:08:52.261
 A question I was asked throughout my life by a man who left school in the third grade: 

00:08:54.419 --> 00:08:56.353
 "how do you live"? 

00:08:56.353 --> 00:08:57.376
 "how do you live?" 

00:08:57.376 --> 00:08:59.539
 Every day ask yourself this question. 

00:08:59.539 --> 00:09:00.675
 how do you live? 

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:06.520
 This is what the cook would have suggested for you to live, to live that way. 

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.480
 You will not judge anyone, 

00:09:08.481 --> 00:09:10.734
 You will appear early 

00:09:10.734 --> 00:09:12.360
 To be nice, 

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.600
 Be sure that your worker towel is large and grandfather used. 

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.960
 If you are going to do something, do it right. 

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.506
 This cook will tell you this: 

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:26.320
 It is not always wrong to do the right thing, so you do anything. 

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.520
 So do everything. 

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.569
 This way your impact will make you change. 

00:09:31.928 --> 00:09:33.384
 This way you will respect all those who passed by you. 

00:09:34.728 --> 00:09:35.971
 Who invested in you. 

00:09:35.971 --> 00:09:39.101
 Look at these undesirable places to seek wisdom. 

00:09:39.101 --> 00:09:43.344
 Improve your life every day by searching for this wisdom. 

00:09:43.344 --> 00:09:45.825
 And ask yourself every day: 

00:09:45.825 --> 00:09:47.111
 "How do I live?" 

00:09:47.111 --> 00:09:48.438
 God bless you all. 

00:09:48.438 --> 00:09:49.898
 Thank you for having me. 

00:09:49.898 --> 00:09:54.090
 (The audience cheers and claps) 

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:56.923
 (Music blaring)
