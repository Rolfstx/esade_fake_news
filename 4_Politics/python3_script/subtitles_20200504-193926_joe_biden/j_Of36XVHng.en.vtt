00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.080
In this video, we are going to
solve your shady garden woes.

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.770
Whether you have a big building
blocking you, a big tree, a big house,

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.500
whatever the case may be, and
you say, oh, I can't garden,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.560
I can't grow anything
worthwhile. Think again because,

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.330
after watching this video, you will still
be harvesting Epic amounts of produce.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.790
What's going on gardeners? Kevin
Espiritu here from Epic Gardening,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.910
where it's my goal to help you grow
a greener thumb. Now you might say,

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.060
I have two to four hours of sun.
What am I supposed to do? Grow, eh,

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.470
I don't know what to grow. Well,

00:00:36.471 --> 00:00:39.290
it would be a big mistake to ignore
those sections of the garden.

00:00:39.291 --> 00:00:41.930
You can still squeeze out, like I
said, an impressive amount of yield.

00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:46.550
So we're going to go over 12 different
vegetables and herbs that do well.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.760
Some that do really well and
some that can tolerate shade.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.920
And then at the end of this
video is a little bonus.

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:55.910
I'm going to go over six different tips
to really help maximize your results in

00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:56.601
your shady garden.

00:00:56.601 --> 00:01:00.800
So let's cultivate that Like button and
let's go ahead and kick into the video.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.050
Let's use my front yard
garden as an example of the
three categories of sunlight

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.810
that can be falling on a
particular space. So first of all,

00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:12.050
you have all these beds right here, these
south facing beds, this one, this one,

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:15.680
this one, this one. These are direct
sun. They're getting six plus,

00:01:15.681 --> 00:01:19.520
sometimes eight plus hours of direct
sun throughout the day during the peak

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.040
hours of the day too - 10:00
AM to about sunset or so.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.080
So these are really the classics.

00:01:24.081 --> 00:01:28.250
You can grow more or less whatever
you want in these beds. Now over here,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.280
and these were really the ones for the
purposes of this video that we're talking

00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:34.130
about, this style of bed or this
style of location in the garden.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.650
These ones are blocked by a loquat tree.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.920
They have a little bit of blockage by an
awning and some of the property behind

00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:44.510
there. So they're getting anywhere from
three to five hours of direct sun a day.

00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:48.110
And then the rest of the day they're
getting a nice dappled sunlight.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.460
It's not completely shaded out,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.200
but it's certainly not as bright as
these beds over here. Our final example,

00:01:54.201 --> 00:01:55.370
and the one that we're going to ignore,

00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:57.740
again for the purposes of this
video - would be a full shade.

00:01:57.741 --> 00:02:01.730
And so that would be something like
in my backyard in the shady zen oasis,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.020
that's why it's called that.

00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:06.230
There's almost no direct sun and so I'm
growing a lot of ornamentals and stuff

00:02:06.231 --> 00:02:08.540
back there. Not a whole
lot of edibles. So again,

00:02:08.541 --> 00:02:09.740
for the purposes of this video,

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.700
these part shade style beds are the
ones that we're doing our 12 crop

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:17.270
recommendations on. So let's go ahead
and get into those. Crop number one.

00:02:17.271 --> 00:02:21.560
It's hanging out in our veggie pod. Here
it is, the spinach plant. Spinach. Wow.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.860
It is an incredible,
incredible cold tolerant green.

00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:27.500
It's a great shady garden
crop and Popeye eats it.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.020
So we should obviously all follow his
suit if we want to get ripped and have

00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:34.820
massive biceps like Popeye. But things
to know about spinach. Number one,

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.930
like I said, cold tolerant,
which means is heat intolerant.

00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:41.210
So you don't want to grow it in too many
spots that are getting blasted both by

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:43.250
direct sun and by
excessive amounts of heat.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.100
That makes it a really
good early spring crop.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.020
It makes it a good fall into winter crop.

00:02:48.021 --> 00:02:53.021
In the summer you can make it happen by
putting it where - in your shady garden,

00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:57.140
right. Now the thing I'll say about
spinach is I recommend starting from seed,

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.270
but indoors it's a slow germinator
sometimes can take up to two weeks to

00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.650
germinate even though
it's a nice big seed.

00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:07.450
And you know that can sometimes test your
patience when you're direct sowing it.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.600
So I recommend starting indoors and then
you can keep starting it on succession

00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.800
and just producing crop after crop after
crop of delicious, nutritious spinach.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.990
Crop number two is chard.

00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:20.950
We have this yellow chard here
that looks absolutely amazing.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.160
It is looking slightly more
pale than I would like it to,

00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:27.520
but it's been growing for a while
in a pretty shady spot. In fact,

00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:30.640
I actually forgot about this grow bag
for a little bit and only recently did I

00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:33.100
pick it back up. And lo and behold,
everything's growing pretty well.

00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:35.860
So chard is effectively something
that you can perennialize,

00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:39.760
you can just grow it in a shady spot
and just come pick it as you need it.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.540
I can come with my shears here,
clip, clip, clip, leave the rest,

00:03:43.541 --> 00:03:45.310
and it'll still keep growing
and growing and growing.

00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:47.890
And it can get pretty
massive. So as you can see,

00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:50.050
I haven't chopped this one in a
while. When you're starting a chard,

00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:52.210
remember that the seeds are compound.

00:03:52.211 --> 00:03:56.050
There's more than one seed in the thing
that you think is the seed. It's very,

00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:59.620
very large. And so within
there there's multiple seeds.

00:03:59.621 --> 00:04:03.760
Oftentimes you'll get more than one chard
plant germinating from that one "seed"

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.450
that you put into the ground.
So feel free to direct sow it,

00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.840
feel free to start indoors.
Very cold tolerant plant.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.020
And you can just really let it be.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.130
And the nice thing about it is it pops
in color. There's oriole orange chard,

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.160
there's ruby red chard, there's rainbow
chard. There's white chard, pink chard,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.190
any color under the sun
literally you can do with chard.

00:04:24.191 --> 00:04:28.810
And it puts a nice pop of color and a
nice pop of flavor into your shady garden.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.550
Shady crop number three is going to
be most varieties of leaf lettuce,

00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:36.670
really almost any variety of leaf
lettuce. You can have your pick here.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.100
Lettuce is a very quick growing crop.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.580
Of course it will grow a little bit slower
in the shade so you can pick an even

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.930
quicker cultivar,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.140
something that matures in let's say 35
to 45 days as opposed to in that 55 plus.

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.610
That'll help you out a
little bit. Of course,

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:54.310
starting from transplant is going to help
you out a little bit because if you're

00:04:54.311 --> 00:04:57.190
starting the seed by direct
sowing in your shady bed,

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.580
then that early growth is really going
to be stunted. So if you go ahead,

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.600
start it in your seed starting system
and then transplant some really nice and

00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:08.230
healthy seedlings, then you're going
to get it off to a much better start.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.050
But almost all of them do really well.

00:05:11.051 --> 00:05:14.860
Lettuce can sometimes struggle in
high temperatures and direct sun.

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.410
These very sensitive leaves
can have a hard time.

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.610
It's a shallow rooted plant and so that
really speaks right to the benefits of a

00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:24.190
shady garden. The soil
doesn't dry out as much,

00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:27.910
the temperature is a little
bit more stable and a little
bit on the colder side.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.021
Crop number four,

00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:32.260
which I coincidentally just harvested
out so I don't have an example.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.170
You're going to have to enjoy this
beautiful Beni Houshi mizuna in the

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.170
background. But crop
number four is a twin crop,

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:41.350
so it's endive and escarole
or endive and escarole.

00:05:41.351 --> 00:05:43.960
Comment down below the correct
pronunciation cause I actually don't know,

00:05:43.961 --> 00:05:47.860
but these are really underrated greens.
I'm not sure why they're not grown more.

00:05:47.861 --> 00:05:49.750
I think some people might have
a hard time with the flavor,

00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:53.230
but I personally think if you throw it
into a mixed green salad it tastes really

00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:57.950
nice. They look really nice and they
grow really well in a shady garden.

00:05:57.951 --> 00:06:00.350
Now again, I know I'm kind
of beating the drum here,

00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:03.380
but this is when you definitely do want
to start indoors because I've noticed

00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:07.280
that both endive and escarole seeds are
much slower to germinate as compared to

00:06:07.281 --> 00:06:09.410
most leafy greens. The
lettuce we just talked about,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.040
lettuce is a quick germinator, anything
like an arugula, kale, et cetera,

00:06:13.041 --> 00:06:16.370
that's all a quick germinator. And then
the escarole the seeds look like little,

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:21.410
um, kind of like little satchels and
they just don't seem to take as quickly,

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:23.690
ten plus days. And so start them indoors,

00:06:23.691 --> 00:06:27.350
get them off to a good start and then
just mix a little variety into your leafy

00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:31.460
shaded garden. Shade loving
crop numero cinco, are peas.

00:06:31.461 --> 00:06:35.090
Peas are the quintessential spring
crop. And what does that tell you?

00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.500
That means that they really will struggle
as you move into those more direct

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:41.780
days of sun, that higher level of heat.

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.380
So that tells us that it also could
do pretty well as a shady crop. Now,

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.020
this is an area where, of
course it's spring right now,

00:06:48.021 --> 00:06:49.970
so they're getting a
good amount of full sun,

00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:53.090
but it's a little bit more mild sun,
but these are doing really well.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.090
They'll do completely fine in
a shady section of the garden.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.510
You can even pull that off as you
move into summer a little bit.

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.610
Maybe the peak of summer
might still be a little hard,

00:07:01.611 --> 00:07:02.960
but you can still make it happen. Now,

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.770
another fun little hack that I've done
with peas is if you sometimes have a hard

00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:08.810
time getting them to adhere and climb up,

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.770
sometimes they like to like flop out
this way and do all sorts of weird stuff.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.270
Remember, nature is amazing.

00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:19.130
They're climbing via their natural
organic tendrils that are just adhering to

00:07:19.131 --> 00:07:20.750
this trellis, but sometimes
they need a little help.

00:07:20.751 --> 00:07:24.890
So I'll take these little hooks here and
I'll just do that and that helps pull

00:07:24.891 --> 00:07:28.610
it back towards the trellis
and it'll climb up. But yeah,

00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:32.090
peas a fantastic one. You can
direct sow them, that's a nice seed.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.820
Soak it then direct sow it.
You'll do completely fine,

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.560
although I will say
transplanting has worked.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.060
It's just a shallow rooted plant and you
want to make sure that more or less you

00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:43.400
don't move it. Whether you're
transplanting it or direct sowing it,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.300
just let it be where it is. Let it climb
up and make sure it's nice and moist.

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.750
Maybe even throw a little mulch on top
just to make sure it doesn't dry out

00:07:50.751 --> 00:07:53.120
because again, it's, it is a shallow
rooted plant. But it will thrive,

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.640
absolutely thrive in a shady garden.

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:59.150
Shady crop number six as I munch
on my freshly harvested pea,

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:03.080
it's another one that I actually don't
have here. Oh, that's really sweet. Man,

00:08:04.070 --> 00:08:08.120
another props for peas. So sweet,
so delicious. I don't have it here.

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:10.940
I just harvested out a bunch of them.
It's radishes. The humble radish.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.700
I think a lot of people have
a problem with growing radish,

00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:15.170
not because it's hard to grow,

00:08:15.171 --> 00:08:16.520
but because they don't really
know what to do with it.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.660
I will say pickling radish has been one
of my best ways to use it as well as

00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:25.340
picking young and roasting the radish
or working the young radish into a nice

00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:27.110
little salad mix. Nice and fresh.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:30.860
Now the thing about radishes -
will they do well in full sun?

00:08:30.861 --> 00:08:31.850
They can definitely handle it,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.280
although they will bolt if
they get blasted by the sun.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.540
They just grow slower but they'll still
bulb up. You just have to be patient.

00:08:38.541 --> 00:08:42.200
So I would say if you're growing it in
a two to four hours of sun section of

00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:44.870
your garden, like back
behind the camera over here,

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.860
throw another 15 days
or so on the maturity.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.890
But that's fine because you weren't
going to use that space anyways. Right?

00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:53.690
So you might as well squeeze
something nice out of it.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.730
And the beauty of the radish is I
probably have more different varieties of

00:08:56.731 --> 00:09:01.410
radish seeds than I do any other type
of plant. It's just so versatile.

00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:04.650
You have green Lobo, you have black
Spanish, you have watermelon, you have,

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.150
you have Beni Hida, you have the di, uh,
the humble daikon. I mean the daikon,

00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:12.990
it's not even humble. It's a
massive plant. So radish is amazing,

00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:17.730
incredible variety in that plant.
There's just so much you can do with it.

00:09:17.731 --> 00:09:21.450
So highly, highly recommend radish.
It's a kind of a sleeper hit.

00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:22.710
A lot of people think it's a boring plant.

00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.200
There's way more than
you think about radish.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.460
As we move into shady crop number seven
we're starting to get into crops that

00:09:29.461 --> 00:09:33.240
are not necessarily shade lovers, but
I would say they're shade tolerant.

00:09:33.241 --> 00:09:36.990
You can still get a decent yield, although
that yield might drop a little bit.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.110
Now that would be potatoes
for number seven surprisingly,

00:09:40.111 --> 00:09:41.790
they still can do pretty well. Now,

00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:44.850
the reason I'm sitting in
front of something that's
not potatoes here is because

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.110
the potatoes that I've grown so far
this spring came from my compost pile.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:54.240
They were some old small potatoes that
I tossed in there that I actually got a

00:09:54.241 --> 00:09:58.680
decent yield out of, and this is
definitely a shady compost pile.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.350
Not your classic way to grow potatoes,

00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:05.340
but effectively you could consider that
like a lasagna bed if you're familiar

00:10:05.341 --> 00:10:08.730
with that technique of gardening or
almost like a straw bale gardening style

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:13.050
because of the way that the ingredients
are layered in there. But again,

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.720
grow them in soil. You don't have
to grow them in a compost bin.

00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:20.280
They're still going to do well in the
shade. I would say for my personal tastes,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.020
I first of all, I love new potatoes.

00:10:22.021 --> 00:10:25.320
I don't know about you guys but that's
going to be a good way to do it.

00:10:25.321 --> 00:10:27.390
As soon as you start to
see those flowers develop,

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.870
you may want to just pull those potatoes
that have been planted in a shady

00:10:30.871 --> 00:10:34.800
section because it's going to be hard
to get them to size up like crazy.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.310
It's going to take a long time. So I
like to pull, pull those new potatoes,

00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:40.290
enjoy them and plant something
else in the shady garden.

00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:43.950
But potatoes can still work in
your shady beds. Crop number eight.

00:10:43.951 --> 00:10:48.330
Another one which I have yet to plant
in this garden would be a very fast

00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:51.090
maturing, cold, tolerant
bush style tomato.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.530
So a determinant style tomato that is
suited for an early spring planting.

00:10:55.531 --> 00:10:58.710
That can actually work. You can
get a decent yield out of it.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.890
I would say Glacier tomatoes
are a decent one to look at.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:05.820
Really any tomato that has
the name of a cold area,

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:11.030
any tomato that has a name that relates
to Russia or New York or Canada.

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.740
A lot of those cultivars of course,

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:17.310
are going to do well in a colder area
because that's what they're named after,

00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:18.960
right? And so surprisingly,

00:11:18.961 --> 00:11:23.550
you can still squeeze out a yield
of tomatoes in a shady garden bed.

00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:27.690
Now the thing I will say is put it in
the best sun access spot of your shady

00:11:27.691 --> 00:11:31.380
bed. So if you have a bed that's getting
two hours and a bed that's getting four

00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:31.711
hours,

00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:35.370
obviously opt to put your bush tomatoes
in the four hour bed and maybe put your

00:11:35.371 --> 00:11:38.280
spinach in the two hour bed.
But you can still do it.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:41.760
And so don't count out your
shady gardens. Our next crop,

00:11:41.770 --> 00:11:43.950
surprisingly would be a bush bean.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:47.100
Bush beans will produce in a shady garden,

00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:49.020
obviously opt towards that
higher end of the sunlight.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.440
But this surprisingly is
kind of a shady garden.

00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:57.441
This is a GreenStalk vertical tower
garden that I planted out with 100% bush

00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:00.340
beans and they're actually
starting to produce.

00:12:00.341 --> 00:12:03.100
You can see you're getting a little
bit of bush bean production here,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:04.930
but remember this is a vertical tower,

00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:07.930
so only half of it is getting
sun throughout the day.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.880
So to compensate for that every
morning I just rotate it one half.

00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:17.170
And so then I make sure that at least
every other day one of the sides is

00:12:17.171 --> 00:12:18.670
getting blasted with full sun.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:21.580
But if you think about that on
like a month over month basis,

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.750
these are only getting 15 days of
full sun per day and I just rotate it.

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:29.080
So these are still producing
really well. You can see,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.560
and you will see later on when I release
a full grow guide on growing beans

00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:34.540
vertically in this particular system,

00:12:34.810 --> 00:12:37.870
you'll see that we're going to get a
really good yield out of these. Next,

00:12:37.871 --> 00:12:41.500
we're in the world of herbs guys.
And also if you're from the UK,

00:12:41.501 --> 00:12:44.020
I will pronounce it the
way you choose, herbs.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.810
These are the herbs that you
can grow in a shady garden.

00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:47.591
So if you're from the UK,

00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:50.440
please hit the like button because
I used the pronunciation you prefer.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.590
I got a lot of comments about that
and having spent some time in London,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.330
I do appreciate the accent. So, basil,
it's a quintessential full sun crop,

00:12:58.331 --> 00:13:01.630
but again, it's one that will tolerate
and sometimes even thrive in shade,

00:13:01.631 --> 00:13:06.631
especially if you grow it for pollination
or more ornamental style gardens.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.880
So here I have an African blue basil bush.

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:14.380
This is my favorite perennial
style basil that does really,

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.730
really well in the shade.

00:13:15.731 --> 00:13:19.870
I've cut this back twice in
a pretty severe manner and
as you can see it's still

00:13:19.871 --> 00:13:22.660
exploding in growth. We have a
bee that just landed right now.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:26.680
So it's a fantastic pollinator plant.
I have Greek columnar basil right here.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.810
As you can tell by the
name, it grows straight up.

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.460
Many of these basil varieties you see are
actually in another video I did called

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:35.530
eight rare basils that you've
probably never heard of.

00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:36.820
So feel free to check that video out.

00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:41.680
I have another Thai basil that's hanging
out down here with these really unique

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:43.960
flower clusters that I
think are quite beautiful.

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.360
Behind here we have pesto Propecho,

00:13:46.361 --> 00:13:49.870
which you can see is that lighter
colored basil. And I also have Tulsi,

00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.490
also known as holy basil.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:56.200
So basil is more or less 50% of this
shady garden bed and it's absolutely

00:13:56.201 --> 00:13:57.034
thriving. Our next herbs

00:13:58.301 --> 00:14:00.610
that do well in the shade
would be cilantro and parsley.

00:14:00.611 --> 00:14:01.810
These ones can do really well.

00:14:01.811 --> 00:14:05.710
Cilantro especially does really well in
the shade and I'm kinda going to trim

00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:07.930
this one up a little bit. It's
looking a little worse for the wear,

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.620
but this has been in a shady section of
the garden for quite some time and it's

00:14:11.621 --> 00:14:12.610
doing perfectly fine.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:16.780
Cilantro actually struggles because
in the heat it will start to bolt.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.170
Now I recommend getting
a slow bolt variety,

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.790
slow bolt cultivar of
cilantro to help prevent that.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.420
But still the number one problem I
hear from everyone who comments here on

00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:29.620
Instagram, on the podcast and email is
what do I do when my cilantro is bolting?

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:32.920
And one of the best things I recommend
is put it in a shadier section.

00:14:32.950 --> 00:14:35.950
Yes it's going to grow slower,
but yes, it also won't bolt.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:38.740
And that's really what you're trying
to avoid when growing cilantro.

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:42.310
So you can mix it into all those classic
recipes that you love. Our final crop,

00:14:42.311 --> 00:14:45.580
before we get to our six shady
garden tips, is a green onion.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.330
Now I say green onion because I think
it's a good idea to leave the bulb onions,

00:14:50.110 --> 00:14:53.660
your shallots, your, your
just red, white onions,

00:14:53.661 --> 00:14:57.020
all those to a direct sun area of the
garden cause you really want all that

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.730
energy to get sent down into the bulb.

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.770
You really want to give it
the best chance to bulb up.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.360
But if you're going to eat the leaves,

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:05.000
like we are with the green onion
then come through, chop it up,

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.390
then that's totally fine. Throw it in a
shady garden. It's going to grow slower.

00:15:08.391 --> 00:15:11.630
It's going to be nice and tasty and you're
just going to get a consistent supply

00:15:11.631 --> 00:15:15.650
of that delicious allium flavor that
you want without as much of the effort.

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.080
Okay, we've made it
through our suggestions,

00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:22.310
so go ahead and cultivate that Like button
if you want 20 years of good luck in

00:15:22.311 --> 00:15:25.160
the garden. But we're going to
get into these shady garden tips,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.070
so some things that you can do to
really maximize your shady garden.

00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:30.860
Now I've talked about a couple of them,
peppered them in throughout the video,

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.420
but the first one would be just remember
that it is going to grow slower.

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:39.050
Remember, most of these things are shade
tolerant, not necessarily shade loving,

00:15:39.051 --> 00:15:40.250
so they're going to grow slower,

00:15:40.251 --> 00:15:43.220
maybe throw another 15 to 25%
on their days to maturity.

00:15:43.221 --> 00:15:47.420
But you are still going to get a yield,
so that's completely, completely fine.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.710
Tip number two,

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.670
you're going to have to remember
to water a little bit less often.

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:56.480
Remember the thing that we are not
getting in a shade garden, is sun,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.130
what's the second effect of that?

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:01.970
There's going to be less water evaporating
so the plants aren't going to need to

00:16:01.971 --> 00:16:06.770
be watered as often, so really try to
avoid over-watering your shady garden.

00:16:06.890 --> 00:16:09.800
Number three because
they are growing slower,

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.970
it makes sense to transplant in instead
of direct sowing and this is for two

00:16:13.971 --> 00:16:15.050
reasons. Number one,

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:18.050
you're going to get them off to a quicker
start because you're putting a nice

00:16:18.051 --> 00:16:21.740
healthy perfectly started seedling
into the ground. Number two,

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.700
oftentimes the shady garden
soil temperatures are a
little bit lower and what

00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:30.590
our plants generally want is somewhere
around that 65 to 75 degrees soil temp,

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.840
which you may not be able
to achieve by direct sowing.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.210
So start it indoors with
some seedling heat mats.

00:16:35.211 --> 00:16:38.180
I have a whole video on how to do
that and then transplant it in.

00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:41.570
Tip number four for a shady garden is
make sure to give it as much sun as you

00:16:41.571 --> 00:16:44.840
can give it. Now that means
if you have to prune a tree,

00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:47.570
like you guys have seen my
epic loquat tree out there.

00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.660
Once that's done fruiting and I've
harvested it and it's time to give it its

00:16:50.661 --> 00:16:51.740
prune for the season.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.680
I need to make sure and go ahead and do
that as quick as I can because that's

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.920
going to open up that area. It's
going to let a little more sun in.

00:16:57.921 --> 00:17:02.030
Maybe I squeak out 30 minutes more of
direct sun a day in that shady bed.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.090
That's good. That's going to actually
boost the growth of those plants.

00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:09.740
Tip number five is kind of a more
intensive one, but if you do have a fence,

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.670
a wall, some sort of thing that
you could paint a different color,

00:17:13.910 --> 00:17:16.100
lighter colors are going
to reflect more light.

00:17:16.101 --> 00:17:20.810
And you'd be surprised at how much that
can actually boost the overall light

00:17:20.811 --> 00:17:22.340
levels of a shady garden.

00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:24.950
So if there's something that maybe
needs a little bit of touch up,

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:27.920
an old garage, an old wall and you
want to paint it a lighter color,

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:31.310
that can actually help boost the light
levels. Our final tip, number six,

00:17:31.311 --> 00:17:34.160
thanks for sticking with me guys,
is consider growing in containers.

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.210
In your shady garden sometimes you can
think of it kind of as a staging area so

00:17:38.211 --> 00:17:41.330
you have all your containers in the shady
garden and then as something needs to

00:17:41.331 --> 00:17:44.630
be moved into an area with more
sun, pick the container up,

00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:48.470
move it over and put it out there. Grow
bags are a really good idea for this.

00:17:48.471 --> 00:17:51.450
One of my favorite favorite
methods for container gardening.

00:17:51.450 --> 00:17:55.800
I do a lot more of that on the channel.
But those are my tips for shady gardens.

00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:57.420
Now there's a lot of other
plants that can work.

00:17:57.421 --> 00:18:00.540
I'm curious if you have one that's
really worked for you in a shady garden.

00:18:00.541 --> 00:18:04.680
Go ahead and drop that in the comments
and let me know the next style of list

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:06.930
type of video you'd like
to see here on the channel.

00:18:07.170 --> 00:18:11.400
I'm putting out three videos a week and
I'm really trying to make everything as

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.410
good as I can get it for you guys.

00:18:13.411 --> 00:18:16.350
The best information I can possibly get
out there because I know a lot of us

00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:18.570
might be stuck at home.
We're trying to garden more.

00:18:18.571 --> 00:18:21.420
We're trying to really like lean
into our hobbies. You know, for me,

00:18:21.421 --> 00:18:22.770
this is a business and is a hobby.

00:18:22.771 --> 00:18:25.290
So I'm definitely trying to put some
good stuff out there for you guys.

00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:27.270
So until next time,
good luck in the garden.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.570
Cultivate that Like button and I
will see you on the next video.
