00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:05.600
Over the past decade, prices for solar
panels and wind farms have reached

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.200
all time lows, leading to hundreds
of gigawatts worth of new renewable

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.280
energy generation.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.510
As the saying goes though, the wind
isn't always blowing and the sun isn't

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.250
always shining.If, for example, it's a beautiful
sunny day and we've got a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.940
super abundance of electricity,
we can't use it.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.020
The question of how to firm
renewables, that is, ensuring there's always

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.290
energy on demand no matter the time of
day or weather, is one of the

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.760
biggest challenges in the industry.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.610
We need a good way
to store energy for later.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.610
And the main option right
now is lithium ion batteries.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.450
You see them in products like
Tesla's home battery, the Powerwall and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.240
utility-scale system, the Powerpack.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.050
But though lithium ion is dropping in
price, experts say it will remain

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.020
too expensive for
most grid-scale applications.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.140
To get to battery for the electrical grid,
we need to look at a further

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.630
cost reduction of 10 to 20x.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.250
Right now, lithium ion batteries just
can't store more than four hours

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.710
worth of energy at a price
point that would make sense.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.700
Plus, they pose a fire risk and their
ability to hold a charge fades over

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.450
time. To address this, there's acadre
of entrepreneurs experimenting with a

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.220
variety of different solutions.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.360
Now we're seeing flow batteries, which
are liquid batteries, and we're

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.520
seeing other forms of storage that
are not chemical or battery-based

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.250
storage.And each has
serious potential.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.820
We looked at materials on the periodic
table that were actually going to be

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.530
cost competitive from day one.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.760
Primus Power's flow battery
is a workhorse.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.900
Thermal energy storage has a pretty
unique opportunity to be extremely low

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.730
cost.Our solution will last 30 plus
years without any degradation in that

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.270
performance.Which technologies prevail remains
to be seen.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.940
But one thing is clear.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.090
For renewables to truly compete with fossil
fuels, we need to figure out a

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.470
better way to store energy.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.180
From 2000 to 2018, installed wind power
grew from 17,000 megawatts to over

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.790
563,000 megawatts.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.750
And solar power grew from a
mere 1,250 megawatts to485,000 megawatts.

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.760
And it's not stopping there.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.630
Renewables are expected to grow an
additional 50 percent over the next

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.500
five years.We know today
that solar P.V.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:36.380
and wind are the least
expensive way to generate electricity.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.850
In particular, the price of solar
photovoltaics has plummeted far faster

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.360
than all forecasts predicted, after China
flooded the market with cheap

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.100
panels in the late 2000s.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.930
All the Wall Street analysts did not
believe that solar was going to ever

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.720
stand on its own without subsidies.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.690
Well, a few years later, even
the most conservative analysts started

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.950
realizing that actually solar was going to
become economic in most parts of

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:01.970
the world pretty quickly.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.110
And as solar has gotten cheaper, so
too have lithium ion batteries, the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.940
technology that powers electric vehicles,
our cell phones and laptops.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.000
And thanks to improved manufacturing
techniques and economies of scale,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.910
costs have fallen 85
percent since 2010.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.300
Now, wind or solar plus battery
storage is oftentimes more economical than

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.050
peaker plants, that is, power plants that
only fire when demand is high.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.660
Tesla, for example, built the world's
largest lithium ion battery in

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.470
Australia, pairing it with a wind
farm to deliver electricity during peak

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.000
hours. But this doesn't mean lithium
ion is necessarily economical for

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.440
other grid applications.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.770
We don't really see the cost structure
coming down to the point where it

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:47.340
can serve those tens to
hundreds of hours applications.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.520
Basically, the market is
ripe for competition.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.780
There are dozens of chemistry
being looked at today.

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.230
There are hundreds of companies working
on scaling up and manufacturing

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.370
new battery technology.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.070
Lithium ion has done remarkable things
for technology, but let's go to

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.360
something far better.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.760
One of the main alternatives being
explored is a flow battery.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.540
Unlike lithium ion, flow batteries
store liquid electrolyte in external

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.900
tanks, meaning the energy from the
electrolyte and the actual source of

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.670
power generation are decoupled.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.450
With lithium ion tech, the electrolyte
is stored within the battery

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.700
itself. Electrolyte chemistries vary, but
across the board, these aqueous

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.450
systems don't pose a fire risk and
most don't face the same issues with

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.040
capacity fade. Once they scale up
their manufacturing, these companies say

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.290
they'll be price competitive
with lithium ion.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.940
Hayward, California-based Primus Power has been
working in this space since

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.000
2009, and uses a
zinc bromide chemistry.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.740
So far it's raised over $100 million
dollars in funding, including a number

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.650
of government grants from agencies like
the Department of Energy and the

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.030
California Energy Commission.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.000
Primus's modular EnergyPod provides 25 kilowatts
of power, enough to power

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.230
five to seven homes for five hours
during times of peak energy demand and

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.780
for 12 to 15
hours during off-peak hours.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.310
Most systems use multipleEnergyPods though,
to further boost capacity.

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.150
The company says what sets it
apart is its simplified system.

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.620
So instead of two tanks, which every
other flow battery has, Primus only

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.780
has one. And we are able to
separate the electrochemical species by taking

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:33.460
advantage of the density differences between
the zinc bromine and the

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.610
bromine itself, and the more
aqueous portion of that electrolyte.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.320
To date, Primus has shipped 25 of
its battery systems to customers across

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.310
the U.S. and Asia, including a San
Diego military base, Microsoft and a

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.080
Chinese wind turbine manufacturer.

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.310
It expects to ship an additional 500
systems over the next two years.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.430
Future customers are either independent
power producers that are doing

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.370
solar plus storage at utility-scale
or larger commercial enterprises.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.430
Also operating in this space is
ESS Inc, an Oregon-based manufacturer of

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.680
iron flow batteries, founded in 2011.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:13.680
Its systems are larger
than Primus Power's.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.890
They're basically batteries in a shipping
container and they can provide

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.240
anywhere from100 kilowatts of power for four
hours to 33 kilowatts for 12

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.170
hours, using an electrolyte made entirely
of iron, salt and water.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.460
When we came into this market, we wanted
to come into it with a technology

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.230
that was going to
be very environmentally friendly.

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:33.340
It was going to be very low cost.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.330
It didn't require a lot of volume
on the production line to drive down

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.250
costs.ESS is backed by some major
players like SoftBank Energy, the Bill

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.760
Gates-led investor fund, Breakthrough
Energy Ventures, and insurance

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.930
company Munich Re.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:50.160
Having an insurance policy is a big
deal, since it will make risk-averse

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.590
utility companies much more likely
to partner with it.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.780
So far, ESS has six of its
systems, called Energy Warehouses, operating in

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.570
the field and plans to
install 20 more this year.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.220
It's also in the process of developing
its Energy Center, which is aimed

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.900
at utility-scale applications in the
100 megawatt plus range.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:12.960
That would be 1,000 times more
power than a single Energy Warehouse.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:17.670
We're planning to be at 250 megawatt
hours of production capacity by the

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.810
end of this year, which is probably a
little over 10 times the capacity we

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.500
had last year. And then eventually getting
to a gigawatt hour of production

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.570
capacity in the next couple of years.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.760
So far, key customers includePacto GD,
a private Brazilian energy supplier,

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:33.980
and UC San Diego.

00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:38.400
But for all their potential, flow
battery companies like Primus and ESS

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:42.240
Inc still aren't really designed to store
energy for days or weeks on end.

00:07:42.900 --> 00:07:45.690
Many of those flow battery technologies
still suffer from the same

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:49.860
fundamental materials cost challenges that
make them incapable of getting

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:53.010
to tens or hundreds of
hours of energy storage capacity.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.550
Other non-lithium ion endeavors,
such as the M.I.T

00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.270
spinoff Ambri, face the same
problem with longer-duration storage.

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.830
Form energy, a battery company with
an undisclosed chemistry, is targeting

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.610
the weeks or months-long storage
market, but commercialization remains far

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:12.480
off. So other companies are
taking different approaches entirely.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:20.430
Currently, about 96 percent of the
world's energy storage comes from one

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.230
technology: pumped hydro.

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.330
This system is
pretty straightforward.

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:27.660
When there's excess energy on the grid,
it's used to pump water uphill to

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.050
a high-elevation reservoir.

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:33.420
Then when there's energy demand, the
water is released, driving a turbine

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:35.250
as it flows into a reservoir below.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.610
But this requires a lot of land,
disrupts the environment and can only

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.650
function in very
specific geographies.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.720
Energy Vault, a gravity-based storage
company founded in2017, was inspired

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.120
by the concept but thinks
it can offer more.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:53.080
And so we wanted to look at
solving the storage problem with something much

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.760
more environmental, much more low cost,
much more scalable, and something

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.920
that could be brought
to market very quickly.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:05.050
Instead of moving water, Energy Vault uses
cranes and wires to move35 ton

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.530
bricks up and down, depending on
energy needs, in a process that's

00:09:08.530 --> 00:09:10.450
automated with machine
vision software.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:16.630
We have a system tower crane that's
utilizing excess solar or wind to drive

00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:20.620
motors and generators that lift and stack
the bricks in a very specific

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:24.880
sequence. Then when the power is needed
from the grid, that same system

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:28.360
will lower the bricks
and discharge the electricity.

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.930
This system is sized
for utility-scale operation.

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.710
The company says a standard
installation could include 20 towers,

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:39.970
providing a total of 350 megawatt
hours of storage capacity, enough to

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.760
power around 40,000 homes
for 24 hours.

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:46.690
Some of our customers are looking
at very large deployments of multiple

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:51.550
systems so that they'll have that power
on demand for weeks and months and

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:52.930
whenever it's gonna be required.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:57.280
The company recently received110 million
dollars in funding from SoftBank

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.910
Vision Fund, and it's building out a test
facility in Italy as well as a

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.830
plant for India's Tata Power Company.

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:07.210
But some say the sheer size of the
operation means it just can't be a

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.980
replacement for chemical batteries.

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:12.790
Sounds very simple. However, the energy
density in those systems are very

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:16.450
low. And so that's where we
believe chemical-based storage still has an

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:17.860
advantage in terms of a footprint.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.140
You can't install a gravity-based system in
the city, but you'd have to

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:23.260
install it outside in
the remote areas.

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.880
Then there's thermal storage.

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:29.150
It's still an emerging technology in this
space, but it has the potential

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.570
to store energy for longer than
flow batteries with a smaller footprint

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.010
than gravity-based systems.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.320
Berkeley, California-basedAntora Energy, founded in2017,
is taking on this

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.120
challenge. Basically, when there's excess
electricity on the grid, that's

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.960
used to heat upAntora's cheap carbon
blocks, which are insulated inside a

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:53.350
container. When needed, that heat is
then converted back into electricity

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.400
using a heat engine.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.520
Typically, this would be a
steam or gas turbine.

00:10:57.790 --> 00:11:01.360
But Briggs says this tech is just
too expensive and has prevented thermal

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.730
storage solutions from working
out in the past.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:08.050
SoAntora has developed a novel type
of heat engine called a

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:12.850
thermophotovoltaic heat engine, or TPV for
short, which is basically just a

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:16.630
solar cell, but instead of capturing
sunlight and converting that to

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:21.370
electricity, this solar cell captures light
radiated from the hot storage

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:23.740
medium and converts
that to electricity.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.850
So it's electricity in, electricity out,
and it's stored in ultra-cheap

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:29.650
raw materials as heat
in the meantime.

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:33.280
Recently, Antora received funding from
a joint venture between the

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:36.790
Department of Energy and Shell, who
are excited by the company's potential

00:11:36.790 --> 00:11:39.040
to provide days
or weeks-long storage.

00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:43.720
We think that that solves a need that
is currently and will continue to be

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.230
unmet by lithium ion batteries and that
will sort of enable the next wave

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.090
of integration of renewables
on the grid.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.740
It's still early days forAntora and
Energy Vault though, and there's

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.020
definitely other creative solutions
in the mix.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.640
For example, Toronto-basedHydrostor is
converting surplus electricity into

00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:02.510
compressed air. And U.K.

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:06.350
and U.S.-based Highview Power
is pursuing cryogenic storage.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.520
That is, using excess energy to cool
down air to the point where it

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.870
liquefies. These ideas may seem far out,
but investment is pouring in and

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.090
projects are being piloted
around the world.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.540
While these companies are all vying to
be the cheapest, safest and longest

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:28.890
lasting, many also recognize that this is
a market with many niches, and

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.080
therefore the potential
for multiple winners.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.830
In the residential and commercial areas,
you're gonna have a certain type

00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:37.290
of technology. A lot of
it will probably be battery-based.

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.220
I think as you get to utility-scale
and grid-scale, you're going to see

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.460
some batteries, you're going to see
other types of compressed air and

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:48.030
liquid air solutions, and then you're going
to see some of the gravity

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:49.650
solutions that could be scaled.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:54.960
Overall, the energy storage market
is predicted to attract$620 million

00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.000
dollars in investments by 2040.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:00.900
But as always, it's going to be tough
to get even the most promising ideas

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:06.810
to market.No matter if the raw materials
were dirt cheap, the initial cost

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:10.020
of a first system
is essentially astronomical.

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.560
Of course, government policies and incentives
could play a major role as

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.090
well.There is a production
tax credit on wind.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.710
There's an investment tax
credit on solar.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:25.050
We in the battery community would like to
see an ITC for batteries in the

00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:27.600
same way that it is
in existence for solar.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.370
Implementing a storage mandate, as California
has done, is another policy

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.660
that many are advocating.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:40.530
When we get to roughly 20 percent
of our peak demand available in storage,

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:45.630
we will be able to run a
renewable-only system, because the mix of solar

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:51.270
and wind, geothermal, biomass all backed up
with storage will be enough to

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:55.140
carry us through even some
of these potentially long lulls.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.640
With the right mix of incentives
and ingenuity, we're hopefully headed

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.640
towards a future with a
plethora of storage technologies.

00:14:02.970 --> 00:14:05.550
The future is not going to
be a mirror of the past.

00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.840
We've got to do something
that's radically different from everything

00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:11.550
that's been done up until now.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.740
I'm really excited about that.
