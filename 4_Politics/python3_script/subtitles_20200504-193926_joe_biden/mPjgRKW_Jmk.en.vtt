Equifax.

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.707
The company whose name sounds
like a theatrical production

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.475
in which Daniel Radcliffe,
plays a horse

00:00:09.575 --> 00:00:11.411 line:0%
-that fucks a fax machine.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.812
Now Equifax,

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.615
is one of the big three
credit reporting agencies.

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:17.917
The companies who keep
financial data on all of us.

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:21.254
So that people like uh, lenders
and landlords can decide,

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:22.755
whether or not
we are trustworthy.

00:00:22.855 --> 00:00:26.192
So, Equifax controls some of our
most sensitive information

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.561
and about a month ago,
we learned this.

It's now 145 million Americans

00:00:44.543 --> 00:00:46.178
and I have got good news
and bad news there.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:48.314
The good news is that
by "private information"

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:51.017
they don't mean
your Google search history, so,

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:53.486
nobody yet knows about the time
you searched for,

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.822
"wario porn (real),"

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.058
or "world's richest dogs
looking for assistants,"

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:01.861
or "can loneliness

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.665
But the bad news is,
the information they got,

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.166
could well be all this.

-Wow! Okay,

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:21.280
so, that does sound bad,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.884
but here's a simple solution,
just move 145 million people

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.686
into the witness
protection program.

00:01:26.886 --> 00:01:29.188
That means Jones'
uh, you are the Thompson's,

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:31.090
uh, Thompson's
you're the Campbell's,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.925

you're the Mendoza's,

00:01:33.025 --> 00:01:34.828
Mendoza's, you're the Jones'.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:36.695
Wait-- wait hold on,
Jones' you shouldn't be there,

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:37.897
I made you the Thompson's.

00:01:37.997 --> 00:01:39.799
No, Thompson's I made you

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:43.169
Mendoza's, why are you there?

00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.537
You should be living
in the Jones' house in Phoenix.

00:01:45.637 --> 00:01:47.206
Oh no, I shouldn't have
said Phoenix.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:49.608
-Oh God, the Jones' are dead!

I'm sorry for trying!
Oh, they're dead!

and, well hold on-- who cares?

00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:07.227
We're the first generation

00:02:07.327 --> 00:02:09.462
to routinely send pictures
of our junk to each other

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:10.830
-over the internet.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:11.931
Why should we give a shit

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:14.166
about someone seeing
our social security numbers?

00:02:14.266 --> 00:02:15.134
But you should know,

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:17.670
criminals can do a lot more
with that number

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.739
than they can with a picture
of your dick.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.908 line:0%
This information
is gonna be sold

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:23.476 line:0%
left and right
on the black market.

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:26.346 line:0%
People are gonna be
able to open up credit cards

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.715 line:0%

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.951 line:0%

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.487 line:0%
They can open bank accounts,

00:02:34.587 --> 00:02:36.322
Someone who has your
social security number

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:38.490
could actually take a job,
they could file taxes

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.426
and even claim
your kids as dependents

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:41.794
and be gone with your refund

00:02:41.895 --> 00:02:43.963
before you ever actually file
a tax return.

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:45.230
No! No!

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.598
No, the tax benefit,

00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:48.635
is the whole point
of having children.

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:49.769
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Without that,

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.338
all you're left with
is your actual children.

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:53.706
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Which, you know...

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:55.341
-Ugh!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:58.177
The point here is,
it's a huge problem

00:02:58.277 --> 00:02:59.545
and in any other era,

00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:01.414
this would've been
the biggest news story

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:02.381
for a month, but--

00:03:02.481 --> 00:03:03.949
but now that
every day's headline

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:04.984
is simply the words,

00:03:05.084 --> 00:03:07.620
"Everything batshit
bananas again today,"

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.222
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-it slipped under the radar,

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:12.291
but it is worth asking,
"How the hell did this happen?"

00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:13.659
Because the short answer is,

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:16.562
the people in-charge have done
literally everything wrong.

00:03:16.662 --> 00:03:17.763
And let's start with just--

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:20.199
just the way that Equifax
told us about the hack.

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:23.369
In early September,
their then CEO, Rick Smith,

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:25.438
a man with a face and name
so bland

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.506
he may as well be called,
"Human Person,"

00:03:27.606 --> 00:03:29.174
or "Frasier re-run."

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:31.677
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-He issued a taped apology,

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:34.280
but his remorse seemed a little
less than heart felt.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.450
On July 29th of this year,
we discovered that attackers

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:41.553
had gained unauthorized access
to certain Equifax data files.

00:03:41.653 --> 00:03:43.155
This is clearly
a disappointing event

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:44.557
and one that strikes
at the heart...

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:46.793
of who we are
and what we do.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.594
-Holy shit!
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:03:48.694 --> 00:03:50.629
Rick Smith is so
alarmingly mechanical

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:53.566
you probably have to put him
in rice every time he gets wet.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:55.801
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, notably

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:58.070
he mentioned there that Equifax
learned about the breach

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.605
on July 29th,

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:03.709
but even more notably that video
was uploaded in September,

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.946
which is, and this is true,
after July.

00:04:07.346 --> 00:04:09.214
So, Equifax
knew about the breach

00:04:09.314 --> 00:04:10.483
for nearly six weeks

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:12.051
before telling the public
and they claim

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:14.486
that they needed that time
because the investigation was

00:04:14.586 --> 00:04:16.656
"complex and time consuming."

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:19.725
Although, that's not all
that happened in that time span.

NEWSCASTER 3:<i> Three Equifax

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:28.534
Wow!

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:30.903
Selling stock before the public
knows there's a problem

00:04:31.004 --> 00:04:32.871
is one of those thing
that looks suspicious

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:35.040
whether or not you're
actually doing something wrong.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.109
It's like, walking
into a petting zoo,

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:38.310
with a bib on.

00:04:38.544 --> 00:04:40.713

-on messily devouring in there?
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.485
And Equifax defended
that saying,

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.053
none of the executives
in question

00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:48.921
including their
Chief Financial Officer

00:04:49.021 --> 00:04:51.457
knew about the data breach,
which raises another question,

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:54.327
-"How is that even possible?"
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:04:54.427 --> 00:04:56.695
Did they just ignore emails

00:04:56.795 --> 00:04:59.097
"Breach!"
"Following up on breach!"

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:02.067
"Where the fuck are you?
Breach, breach, breach!"

00:05:02.334 --> 00:05:04.337
And, "Just spoke to you
in person about breach

00:05:04.437 --> 00:05:06.772
and you just stared blankly
at me, and then said,

00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:08.807
'I'm gonna order
from the salad place.'"

00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:09.842
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:11.843
And if you are getting
frustrated already

00:05:11.944 --> 00:05:13.012
with this kind of incompetence,

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:14.346
you're gonna need
to pace yourself,

00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:17.116
because this story,
gets a lot worse.

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:19.051
Apparently,
there were multiple points

00:05:19.251 --> 00:05:20.586
where this hack
could have been prevented

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:21.788
and one of them is incredible,

00:05:21.888 --> 00:05:24.356 line:0%
because Equifax were alerted
by Homeland security,

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.691 line:0%
back in March,

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:27.727 line:0%
that they needed to fix
a critical vulnerability

00:05:27.827 --> 00:05:28.661 line:0%
in their software.

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:30.929 line:0%
But as lawmakers discovered
at a recent hearing,

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:32.564 line:0%
that's not what happened.

00:05:32.764 --> 00:05:37.070 line:0%
There was one person apparently,
who forgot to tell somebody

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:38.670 line:0%
that they had a piece
of software

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:39.872 line:0%
that needed to be patched.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:42.041
Yeah, it is not ideal,

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:44.243
that a company guarding
such valuable information

00:05:44.343 --> 00:05:47.446
leaves something that important
down to one person.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.248
It's like finding out
that Chase Bank

00:05:49.348 --> 00:05:52.284
has a big red button labeled,
"Lose everyone's money,

00:05:52.384 --> 00:05:55.054
and the only thing
stopping anyone from pushing it,

00:05:55.154 --> 00:05:56.355
-is Frank."
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:05:56.455 --> 00:05:58.024
And look, I love Frank.

00:05:58.291 --> 00:06:01.126
I love the guy,
but what if he has to pee?

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:02.327 --> 00:06:04.797
A-- and I want to tell you
that this is an anomaly,

00:06:04.897 --> 00:06:07.600
but Equifax has had multiple
headline-grabbing breaches

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:08.534
over the years,

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:11.270
and that is not even counting
smaller incidents like this.

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:13.139 line:0%
I checked my credit report
the other day

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:14.706 line:0%

00:06:15.907 --> 00:06:19.312 line:0%
That was it, and next thing
I know I have 300 pieces of mail

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:20.713 line:0%
sittin' in my mailbox.

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:23.416 line:0%

that not great, is it?

And it really should have
set off red flags at Equifax,

00:06:46.038 --> 00:06:48.073
when hundreds of different
credit reports

00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:49.909
were being mailed
to the same address.

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:52.011

00:11:51.376 --> 00:11:53.778

00:11:53.878 --> 00:11:56.481
that's Equifax, Experian
and TransUnion,

00:11:56.581 --> 00:11:57.949

00:12:03.755 --> 00:12:05.024
their own credit protection

00:12:05.124 --> 00:12:06.725

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:10.315 line:0%
I haven't heard any big company
came out-- come out yet

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:12.484 line:0%
and say, "We're not gonna use
Equifax anymore"

00:14:12.584 --> 00:14:13.818 line:0%
-for their credit scores.
-STUART VARNEY:<i> Good point.</i>

00:14:13.919 --> 00:14:15.754 line:0%
So far, everybody's been quiet,

00:14:15.954 --> 00:14:17.589 line:0%
and I don't know what they're
waiting to hear.

00:14:17.689 --> 00:14:19.791 line:0%
This is outrageous,
they should be done

00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:20.859 line:0%
but I bet you,

00:14:20.959 --> 00:14:23.128 line:0%
because it's America,
they'll be okay.

00:14:23.228 --> 00:14:24.729
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Here's the truth,

00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:28.033
that angry business casual
farm animal on Fox Business

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:29.601
-is talking sense.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:33.172
And that sentence alone
shows just how bad things are.

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:34.606
So, in the long term,

00:14:34.706 --> 00:14:37.042
there should clearly be
major reform to this industry

00:14:37.142 --> 00:14:38.143
and how it's regulated,

00:14:38.243 --> 00:14:40.145
but that is going to take time,
so until then

00:14:40.245 --> 00:14:42.681
you need to freeze
your credit reports

00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:44.550
with all three
of these companies,

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:46.051
and only unfreeze them

00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:47.252
when you need to apply
for credit.

00:14:47.352 --> 00:14:48.587
And because the freeze option

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:50.355
can be hard to find
on their sites

00:14:50.455 --> 00:14:51.957 line:0%
if you go to our twitter feed,

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:54.827 line:0%
we will give you exact links
to do that, and when you do,

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:57.796 line:0%
they will give you a PIN number
that you need to unfreeze it.

00:14:57.896 --> 00:15:00.332 line:0%
So, do not lose that number,
or at the very least,

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:01.500 line:0%
make it something memorable.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:02.534 line:0%
I don't know, like...

00:15:02.834 --> 00:15:06.538
-457-55-5462.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:15:06.638 --> 00:15:08.873
-(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
-But not that, 'cause of course

00:15:08.974 --> 00:15:12.144
that's Todd Davis's
social security number.
