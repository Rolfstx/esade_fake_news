00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.939
When Christopher Columbus crossed the atlantic in 1492, he carried with him diseases

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.029
which all but quite touched the native Indian population.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.389
Their revenge, according to history, was to send back to Europe the scourge of syphilis.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.050
But now, a skeleton unearthed in an English monastery can at last put the record straight.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.639
This is the true story of syphilis.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:09.210
This story begins in Hull.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.700
When the city planners decided to build a new magistrate's court next to a multi-story car park in the town center,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.549
it gave the local archaeological unit the chance to survey the site first for ancient remains and artifacts.

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:42.829
Working within a very limited time frame, the team worked day and night, digging out what they suspected might be the remains of a medieval friary.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.089
By the end of the dig, they had unearthed more than 240 skeletons and countless artifacts,

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.188
information which painted a detailed picture of a Shadowy medieval world:

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:11.869
A heady mix of religion and riches, medicine and morality, sex and disease.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.999
You have a complete ground plan for a medieval monastery, which is almost unheard of; it's a major piece of archaeological work.

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.819
John Bugless is the project leader for what has become known as the "Magistrates Court Site,"

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.959
responsible for recording every last detail of the excavation.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.500
We're fortunate with this site that preservation conditions are excellent.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.700
We have surviving coffins, textile fragments, leather objects; we have bodies that still got shoes on and things like that.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.640
So we have really good skeletons to look at.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.540
One skeleton in particular from the hull site was sent to rewrite history.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.140
Very soon after we got the skeletons, we started to see things that were rather unusual.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.600
And particularly, there was a lot of infectious disease in the site,

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.020
including what we thought were classic cases of syphilis.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.420
And this one here, 1216 - this 25 to 35-year-old male - is one good example. In fact, it's the best example.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:57.040
The skeletons from the Hull site were sent to the University of Bradford for analysis.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.340
It's usually incredibly difficult to diagnose the cause of death so long after the event,

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.229
as many diseases leave no trace at all on the bones.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.400
But syphilis is one of the few exceptions.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.700
Charlotte Roberts is an expert in paleopathology, the archaeology of disease.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.420
Can she be sure that skeleton number 1216 really did have syphilis?

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.680
There are a number of changes in the skeleton for recognizing syphilis.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:38.979
If we focus on the skull, you can see immediately that there's something wrong.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.600
Normally - if I just get a skull that's not affected by the disease

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:52.780
- you would expect to see a smooth surface on this part of the skull.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.200
But here, you've got pockmark lesion; holes in the bone.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.440
It's something that people call carry sicca.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.820
It's characteristic of venereal syphilis. We don't see it in any of the other syndromes.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.000
So I would say that's characteristic of the disease.

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.720
The other thing on this skull is that you've got a hole in the palate,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.200
the connection between the nose and the mouth,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.600
and that's commonly seen in syphilis.

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.839
We move down the skeleton what we see again is bone formation and bone destruction.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.120
I think probably the most florid bone formation is actually on the leg bones.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.880
This is a thigh bone.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:48.160
And you can see the whole length of it

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.220
has got the formation of bone we also got some destructive lesions here

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:57.460
and here.

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.020
We look at one of the lower leg bones.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.180
Again, you see the same sort of changes that you see here,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.380
but also you get a massive amount of bone formation on the front of this lower leg bone,

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.340
which people call a "saber shin" because it looks like a saber.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:29.769
Imagine the inflammation, swelling of these limbs, the redness, the heat, the pain.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.800
Apart from skeleton 1216, the site contained two more classic cases of the disease,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.320
and there were characteristic signs of syphilis in more than 60% of the bodies.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.780
But all these people were buried in the sanctuary walls of a deeply religious community.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:57.800
And syphilis is a venereal disease that is contract through sexual intercourse.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.540
So what kind of religious community was this?

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:30.460
The building belonged to a Christian order called the Augustinian Friars,

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:36.939
and this complex of cloisters, living accommodation and church was the friary.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:46.420
It was one of the first to be established in England, and in 1539, the last to be destroyed.

00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:58.809
The brothers were not rich, like some other religious orders of the time; they were supposed to beg for a living.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:07.420
These friars were the social services of their day: They looked after the poor at the time.

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:11.460
They were skilled in medicine and they cared for the sick whether they were rich or poor.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.240
Their good works and religious calling put them beyond reproach.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.580
And they were, of course, celebate.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.780
But the skeletons from the Hull friary proved the presence of a sexually transmitted disease.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.620
What had gone so perversely wrong amongst the brothers here?

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.900
There was more evidence from the dig which could not easily be explained away.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.420
A dozen bodies were found with a wooden rod buried alongside them,

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:03.620
leading to the suspicion that these friars belonged to a flagellation sect.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.440
We have a series of rods which are quite short.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:13.800
They're sort of about that long and they still have the bark on them. And they're hazel, nice and whippy.

00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.400
And there has been a suggestion they're actually flagellation rods.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.100
Because at this particular time, with plague sweeping through various parts of Europe,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:27.780
there was quite a strong movement - particularly on the continent - for self-flagellation and hair shirts.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.420
And you suffer more in this life; therefore, the afterlife becomes better.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.620
The Augustinian brothers were experts on the afterlife.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.260
They made a lot of money from death.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.400
They sold candles and winding sheets for the dead.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:57.189
They presided over funerals, held vigils and set masses for the souls of the departed,

00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:04.340
all paid for by the wealthy merchant and aristocratic classes in order to save their souls,

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.100
buying their way into heaven through the industry of the friars.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.079
This put the brothers in a powerful position.

00:10:14.529 --> 00:10:20.099
If they dispensed with their vow of poverty as easily as they seem to have broken their vow of celibacy,

00:10:20.649 --> 00:10:23.669
they could make a fortune out of the misfortune of others.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:44.190
This medieval will from Hall shows that the system was certainly open to corruption.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.000
We have two surviving wills from this period of time.

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:55.920
And one of them actually states that a sum of money is to be put aside per friar who attends mass for this person's funeral.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:11:00.959
Which is terribly open to abuse, because you can just load up x number of friars;

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.000
you could grab friars from every house in the area and bring them in and bulk your funds up.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:18.160
The Augustinians were not a closed order of monks, shut away from the temptations of the world in a life of quiet contemplation.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.100
The priory was deliberately positioned in the commercial heart of the time,

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.440
wedged in between the houses of wealthy merchants and the key side of the bustling port.

00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:42.309
One of the things is the trade that comes into Hull and makes its wealth its wine trade coming in from Spain.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:50.530
The volume of wine being imported is enormous - a million and a half liters a year is a staggeringly large amount of wine,

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:57.549
a lot of which would be consumed locally. So you would seem to think that there could well be a high degree of carousing.

00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.130
The site in Hull uncovered large collections of the imported wine jugs,

00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:10.749
evidence that at least some of the carousing was going on within the fiery walls.

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:16.090
But this does not mean that they were necessarily dissolute.

00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:22.479
Medieval monks probably drank four times as much alcohol as people drink in England today,

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:25.660
and the Hull friars were no different.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:40.300
The whipping rods, if that is what they were, point more towards a form of medieval Christian devotion than sexual deviancy.

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.180
If they were corrupt, the evidence is no more than circumstantial.

00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.280
We are left would be astonishing evidence of the bones.

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:02.739
How can we explain the presence of syphilis within the friary walls?

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:15.400
Channel Four commissioned experts at Bradford University to make a computerized map plotting the site of each skeleton,

00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.420
superimposed on the outline of the friary.

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.440
Augustinian friars sold burial plots within their church;

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:37.600
the nearer the altar, the nearer to God, and so the more expensive the plot.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.780
The most prestigious plots were reserved for the senior friars

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.060
and for the rich merchants who paid for this privilege.

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:58.029
The map shows exactly where the bones of skeleton 1216 were buried:

00:14:05.180 --> 00:14:08.049
In a prime spot close to the altar.

00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:22.040
So which was he? A rich nobleman? Or an esteemed member of the monastic community?

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.000
We will never know.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:30.580
The Hull site cannot prove that syphilis was rampant amongst the friars,

00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:36.699
but it does show that it was widespread amongst the elite of this prosperous community at that time.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:40.740
So when was that time?

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.640
When did skeleton number 1216 die?

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.200
The evidence from the dig suggests that he died in the 1300s.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:01.569
But if this was true, this was electrifying information.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:12.600
For history records that syphilis originated amongst the Native American Indians,

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:19.440
and was contracted by the crew of Christopher Columbus during his voyages to the New World.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.240
On returning to the Old World, the new disease grew into a plague of epidemic proportions.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:33.020
First among the Spanish soldiers of the siege of Naples in 1495 before spreading remorselessly through Europe.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.200
If the Hull site could be dated to before 1492,

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:59.420
then the disease must have existed in the Old World prior to Columbus's journey, and history would have to be rewritten.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:06.560
And to help them date the burials, the archaeologists at Hull had a red piece of luck:

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:15.989
The waterlogged conditions of the site had preserved a remarkable number of wooden coffins,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.459
ideal and rare material from which to get a reliable date.

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.000
It's a very unusual find.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:31.800
There are only ten sites that have generated significant quantities of waterlogged coffin boards across the whole country for the past fifty years.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:35.520
So it's a very unusual find, and this is by far the biggest assemblage.

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:46.760
Ian Tires, from the dendrochronology unit in Sheffield, took over 300 samples back to his lab.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.000
The critical thing that we were supposed to be sorting out was the dating of the coffins themselves,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.860
to help sort the stratigraphy and help put a timetable to the burials.

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:05.200
You can see that we have wide rings and narrow rings are effectively reflecting the conditions

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.640
under which the tree was growing; whether it was having a good summer or a bad summer, as far as growth is concerned.

00:17:09.850 --> 00:17:17.429
And those are act like a fingerprint through time - the pattern of narrow and wide rings is unique over a number of millennia.

00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:25.400
Having recorded the measurements for each sample, Ian then fed all the information into a central database

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.280
to find a match which would give him a definite date.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.570
From our dating perspective,

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:38.500
we can date their year and indeed the season of the year that the trees are felled

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:45.980
And those that we have bark age for, so the year the trees were cut down are all in the 1340s and the 1360s.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:57.420
The date from the dendrochronology lab puts the coffins at between 1340 and 1369.

00:17:58.380 --> 00:18:01.620
This is not in itself particularly surprising.

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.160
All the indications from the dig - the pottery, the historical records -

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:11.960
all show a date around the middle of the 14th century, and the wood dating is right in the middle of this.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:22.389
But of course this information from the site in Hull has sent shockwaves through the archaeological and historical worlds.

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:31.480
Because syphilis is not supposed to have been in this country - in Europe, even - until Columbus brought the disease back from America.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:40.600
150 years after skeleton 1216 was buried in the nave of an Augustinian friary on the northeast coast of England.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.300
Who can history blame for the scourge of syphilis?

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.760
In 1493, Christopher Columbus returned home to Europe with news of a New World.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:01.650
History records that he brought a new disease with him, too: Syphilis.

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:10.950
But now, the discovery and Hull of skeletons bearing the scars of syphilis undermines this 500-year-old version of history.

00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:18.020
For these bodies were buried 150 years before Columbus set sail.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:24.020
So the question now is, who really gave syphilis to whom?

00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:37.560
To understand, we need to look closely of the reasons why people have always believed this Columbus theory.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:47.309
In the closing years of the 15th century, a young ambitious scholar described a new disease sweeping through Europe.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:54.220
In recent times, I have seen a disease which is so cruel, so distressing, so appalling,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:20:01.020
that until now nothing so horrifying, nothing more terrible or disgusting has ever been known on this earth.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:15.020
Joseph Gruenpeck was an eyewitness to the agonies of the Spanish soldiers at the siege of Naples in 1495.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:21.590
Some had become so repugnant.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:25.430
Left in the open air on the battlefield, they hoped to die.

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:32.200
Others moaned and wept and uttered heart-rending cries because of the ulceration of their male organ.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:42.600
Gruenpeck's description is historically important: It is the first unchallenged record of syphilis in the world.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:49.460
He accurately portrays the distinct stages of the disease as they are still understood today.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:57.360
The first stage of the disease really just involves ulceration at the site of infection,

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.620
so things like genital ulcers.

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.880
The swelling of the glans was followed by an abscess,

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:06.360
from which the putrid smelling pus flowed for a full month.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:12.820
The second stage, which occurs about three to six months after infection, you get a generalized rash.

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:20.380
They experienced intense pains in head and bones, and soon boils appears all over the body.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.899
It's the third phase where you get considerable ulceration on the skin.

00:21:28.770 --> 00:21:33.109
The person wouldn't be feeling too good, I don't think, and wouldn't look very nice, either.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.080
You can relate their bone lesions quite nicely to ulcerations of the skin.

00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:46.670
Imagine a boil or an ulcer on the skin, and that's tracking down to these lesions on this on the skull.

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:49.310
Not very nice.

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:01.980
And I would thinking you've got an infectious lesion that's active in the mouth,

00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.360
you're going to have somebody who's got a pretty awful bad breath.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.900
If you can imagine this person with these bones inside their body,

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:19.980
you would expect swelling, quite a lot of pain and heat just as a result of inflammation.

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:29.480
The other thing that you get in the third phase of syphilis is what they call "general paralysis of the insane."

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:51.460
This was more than just another plague. It was a disease which brought to the sufferer not only pain, but shame.

00:22:54.780 --> 00:23:00.800
In the fervently religious Christian Europe of the time, this new disease represented the wrath of God,

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.949
punishing wicked people for their immorality.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:12.020
As Gruenpeck describes the horror at the end of the 15th century,

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:15.520
no one seemed to know where syphilis had come from,

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.840
and of course nobody was willing to accept the place of origin for this disease as their own.

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:27.899
He calls it the French disease; the French called it the Neapolitan disease; the Germans called it the Spanish itch.

00:23:33.090 --> 00:23:39.799
Then a Portuguese doctor, who had treated Columbus's crew for the disease, made the connection with their trip to the New World.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:48.319
Clearly, they had contracted the disease from dirty American Indian women and brought it back to Christian Europe.

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:56.800
In the 500 years since American Indians were first blamed for giving the disease to Europe,

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:00.220
scientists have searched for evidence to support this theory.

00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:12.700
George R. Melagos is absolutely convinced that Columbus's crew contracted the disease in the Americas and brought it back to Europe.

00:24:13.710 --> 00:24:16.639
He has been analyzing skeletons for 30 years.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:24.169
He believes the only place there is convincing evidence of syphilis in bones from before 1492 is in the Americas.

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:31.600
What I found is that there's all kinds of evidence of the lesions in the New World prior to Columbus, and it continued on after Columbus.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.880
You go into the Old World, you find hardly any evidence at all.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:45.780
I've looked from from Florida all the way up to Ohio, from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River,

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:50.980
and it was just incredible numbers of cases of this syphilis-like lesion.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.400
George is convinced that the disease was widespread in the New World - not just because he has found classic cases,

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.620
but because he has found signs of syphilis in the population as a whole.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.820
Now what I would expect to find is not only the fact that you find it within an individual,

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.600
which we find many isolated cases,

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:21.509
but we find it within the population and within a region if these people are in social contact.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:24.660
They're in sexual contact and so the disease should be widespread.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:39.620
For George, the whole skeleton alone would not be sufficient proof that syphilis was present in medieval England before 1492.

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.620
If Charlotte is to overturn 500 years of history, she needs more evidence.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:05.920
At the Hull site she has found signs of the disease in more than half the skeletons.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.540
But it's true to say that this is the very reason that Hull is so important.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.699
Syphilis has not been fun distributed across medieval Europe, like it seems to be in America.

00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:23.589
But Charlotte thinks there is a good reason for this.

00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:29.660
Syphilis does not show up on the bones until the third stage of the disease,

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.400
sometimes not until 50 years after initial infection.

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:40.800
In medieval times, most people would have died of something else before then, leaving no signs that they ever had syphilis.

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:50.320
Only a small proportion of people with syphilis will get bone change.

00:26:55.160 --> 00:27:06.820
They may die before that develops. They may have died from something like the Black Death or other conditions that were prevalent at a time,

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.780
like cholera, like smallpox. Et cetra, et cetra.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:20.420
So, there was a lot going on in the medieval period that will have predispose people to die quite young,

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:23.980
and in fact this person has died before the age of 40.

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.360
But we don't know what from, but we know that this person has syphilis.

00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:38.440
And so it's actually difficult to get a handle on really what the prevalence, the rate of this disease,

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:43.920
was in the late medieval period in England, because there's so many confounding factors.

00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:50.659
Charlotte would not expect to find the classic signs of syphilis in the general population at this time.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.309
This is what makes 1216 such a special find.

00:27:55.889 --> 00:27:58.008
He shows all the evidence of the disease.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:04.420
There has never been a clearer example in the Old World from a site dated before 1492.

00:28:12.620 --> 00:28:19.000
But the supporters of the Columbus theory want more: They want quantity as well as quality.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.440
And they want a carbon date.

00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:32.780
Really the debate centers around this issue: What is the evidence in the Old World prior to contact?

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:41.000
Now it may be at Hull there is irrefutable evidence if they find for example that you have a radiocarbon date that dates it before 1492,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:43.820
then I would have to do some explaining.

00:28:46.220 --> 00:28:53.180
Dendrochronology has given a precise date to the coffins font of the Hull site. But George wants more than that.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:58.600
He wants a date for 1216 that comes from the bones themselves.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:04.380
In the debate about who gave syphilis to whom, the date is crucial.

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:15.620
And Charlotte knows that if her findings are to be taken seriously, she will need irrefutable evidence that skeleton number 1216 predates Columbus - a carbon date.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.280
She sends off samples from the bones to the carbon dating laboratory in Oxford.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.440
And waits.

00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:34.640
By working out how much radioactive carbon is left in the bones, it is possible to work out when the individual died.

00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:45.040
If skeleton 1216 can be securely dated to before 1492, the Columbus theory will be in tatters.

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:04.620
When the carbon age of 1216 is converted into calendar time, even with the cautious margin of error,

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:12.000
the young man with syphilis can definitely be said to have died between 1300 and 1420 AD.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.600
At least 70 years before Columbus set sail for the Americas.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:37.559
Charlotte is invited to an international conference in Texas, where the world's leading experts in this field are gathered.

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.379
Armed with photographic evidence and a carbon date,

00:30:52.980 --> 00:31:02.440
Charlotte arranges a private meeting to confront George R. Melagos with curator at the Smithsonian Institution, Don Ordner, as an independent witness.

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.380
Will this be the end of the Columbus theory?

00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:22.020
I have some very interesting photographs of the skeleton from England that I think might change your mind about the pre-Columbian origin.

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:27.100
Do you think that facts are going to change my mind? I'm hoping so. You're now look at this

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:37.020
This skeleton comes from a sight in Hull; it's one of three that has changes I'm sure you would consider classic.

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.220
Classic what? Ah. I see.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.260
And I would suggest that that's carris sicca.

00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.900
Perforation of palate here.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.740
Destruction and formation of bone.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.640
60% of the adults have got bone formation on the lower legs.

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.340
I'd say that this is obviously a clear case with syphilis.

00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.420
And I really congratulate you, because this is quite impressive.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.780
When you see something like this - the whole specimen, which is classic -

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:32.240
I mean, any anatomist who's had any experience with syphilis in modern populations would recognize these lesions immediately.

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:37.600
On the face of it, Charlotte has scored a significant victory in Texas.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:42.080
Her diagnosis of skeleton 1216 has been accepted and agreed.

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:50.250
But amongst the thousands of pre-Columbian skeletons excavated so far in Britain, it is still an isolated case.

00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:57.959
Charlotte thinks that this is because no one has been looking for syphilis in the Old World, because it wasn't supposed to be there.

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.500
George is still not convinced.

00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:05.940
You actually - I mean, how many skeletons have been excavated in England, would you guess?

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:09.020
Oh, many thousands. Fifty thousand plus, I would say.

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:14.620
Your point is that, even though you've looked at fifty thousand skeletons--

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:23.640
I'm not saying that those fifty thousand skeletons have been looked at systematically and scientifically by a person who knows what they're looking for.

00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:29.980
I mean, this it would be - I would be - I would probably be more accepting of this position

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:35.220
if this wasn't an issue that has been as issue from the late 1800s.

00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:41.640
Or even from the 1500s. I mean, this is such an important issue within the history of medicine

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:48.580
within the history of disease, within the history of the world, that it seems to me that all of this evidence would be there by now.

00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:55.680
For George, more classic cases of syphilis would have to be unearthed in the northeast of England and elsewhere

00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:59.010
before he would agree to give up the Columbus theory.

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:04.170
But in Don Ordner, Charlotte has found an ally.

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.959
Don has examined the evidence in both the Old World and the New World.

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:15.959
He agrees with Charlotte that it would be difficult to find widespread proof of syphilis in Europe.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:21.149
But more importantly, it would dispute most of George's New World evidence.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:29.540
Don thinks that there is only one indisputable way to diagnose syphilis in old bones.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:35.040
The best evidence for venereal syphilis is going to occur in children's skeletons.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.180
Syphilis is only infectious in the first stages of the disease.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:52.100
If a woman becomes pregnant during this time, then the teeth forming in the unborn child will have a unique groove mark on them.

00:34:53.859 --> 00:34:57.929
You'll also see evidence of abnormal defects in the teeth,

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:06.580
and you can see a groove that's horizontal going across the central incisor.

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.760
And adjacent that the second incisor has actually broken off.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:17.580
So the enamel was clearly very defective in the formation of the tooth, and this would have been right about at the end of pregnancy

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:19.220
or at the time of birth.

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:32.140
The work in the New World cannot prove that the disease originated here in America,

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:37.410
and too little work has been done in Europe to conclusively reject the Columbus theory.

00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:44.909
The only way to prove the existence of syphilis in adults is to identify it in the skeletons of their children.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:59.400
Only a handful of child skeletons, with the telltale syphilitic groove in their teeth dated before 1492, had ever been found, all of them in America.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:10.240
In effect, the whole of the Columbus theory rested on four or five skeletons.

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:14.020
And yet, still it stood, apparently unshakeable.

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:25.140
That is, until another skeleton was found with the distinctive teeth to finally shatter this distorted view of history.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:39.000
A skeleton found not in America, nor in medieval Europe, but from a town that flourished 2,000 years before the death of skeleton 1216.

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:57.580
For 500 years, the American Indians have been blamed for giving Europe syphilis.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:09.610
Then the discovery of skeletons from medieval Hull suggested we might have given it to them.

00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:22.179
Now discoveries from the ancient world may finally reveal the truth behind the syphilis enigma.

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:31.540
Maciej and Renata Henneberg excavated nearly 300 skeletons from an ancient Greek settlement in southern Italy.

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:40.840
Metaponto was a busy port of forty thousand inhabitants that flourished from 600 years BC.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:46.449
As they worked their way through the bones, looking for signs of disease,

00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:50.830
Matty found it difficult to believe the evidence before his eyes.

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:59.980
What I could see on the bones, in terms of physical signs of disease, was not making much sense

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:05.400
in terms of patterns we normally expect in some ancient populations.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:15.820
And it took me two weeks to come to grips with an idea that the signs fit only one disease,

00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:17.860
and this disease was syphilis.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:26.140
He found many bones with the classic syphilis lesions and formations.

00:38:27.790 --> 00:38:32.519
Then his wife, Renata, a dental expert found the clinching proof.

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:36.599
A child's skeleton with the telltale markings on its teeth.

00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:49.540
When I told him that I have two examples of the teeth change accrue as it is found in congenital syphilis,

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:58.020
Maciej was very happy, because finally we had the picture of syphilis coming together.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:05.360
The Hennebergs knew that if they were right, the presence of syphilis in Europe had nothing to do with Columbus.

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:13.720
But if it had been in Europe since classical times,

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.600
then they should also find evidence of the disease at their other archaeological site.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.440
The ancient Roman remains at Pompeii.

00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.080
They began to search for the evidence that other experts might have missed.

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:36.480
Crucially, they widened their search beyond what the bones alone could tell them.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:43.109
They read Latin texts and studied Roman medicine.

00:39:44.049 --> 00:39:49.229
They found evidence everywhere that convinced them that syphilis was rampant in the city.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:57.600
There's various strings of evidence from written sources, from the cultural functioning of the city,

00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:06.200
from the business of prostitutes, from public houses, from the fact that it was a trading center and a sea port.

00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:12.000
And evidence that we can see on bones are all coming together to support the hypothesis

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
of the presence of syphilis in the classical antiquity of Europe.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:24.620
By looking at the wider social context of the disease, the Hennebergs have not just demonstrated

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:28.200
that the disease has been around in Europe for thousands of years,

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:32.180
they have also found the key to unlock the syphilis enigma.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.420
The question is no longer, "Who gave it to whom?"

00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:43.020
There is simply not enough bone evidence yet, on either side of the Atlantic, to settle the argument for good.

00:40:55.080 --> 00:41:00.400
But add to the evidence of the bones an understanding of the way of life of these places,

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:03.820
and the true story of syphilis begins to unfold.

00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:15.740
Syphilis is a survivor, and to survive it has mutated to adapt to different climates and different societies.

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:22.150
It has not always been a killer.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:39.420
Epidemiological research shows that in rural societies around the world,

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:44.500
syphilis was present, but in a much milder form and was not transmitted sexually.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:55.729
Mary Lukas Powell studies the evolution of the bacteria, and how it has been transmitted amongst the Indian communities of the New World.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:04.980
Well, in the pre-Columbian New World - in the southeastern United States -

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:13.460
there was ample opportunity because of styles of clothing, of styles of communal sharing,

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:17.480
of eating and drinking utensils, of sleeping places.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:21.380
There was abundant opportunities in every generation

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:27.280
for these diseases to be transmitted without any sort of sexual contact involved.

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:36.620
And therefore, they were much more common within the populations, but with no connection with sexual activity.

00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:42.520
What the syphilis bacteria needs in order to spread is skin-to-skin contact.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.780
In unsophisticated rural communities, and in hot climates like pre-Columbian America,

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:54.000
the bacteria could easily pass from skin-to-skin.

00:42:55.720 --> 00:43:02.300
It caused an ugly skin disease that everyone caught in childhood. It rarely developed into something more serious.

00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:11.280
And everyone who caught it as a child was immunized against the dangerous venereal form of the disease.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:21.420
So why, then, does the bacteria sometimes mutate into a sexually transmitted killer?

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:30.600
If we look at the places where we now know syphilis existed in its deadly venereal form,

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:33.000
will that help us to understand?

00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:39.500
What is it that links Metaponto, Pompeii, Hull and Naples?

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:45.000
One common denominator is that they were all ports.

00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:52.000
Well, ports are ports. People have always behaved badly in ports.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:57.980
It seems that Hamburg is a good example at the moment. Rotterdam, Amsterdam - they're all ports. They all have very large red-light districts.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:06.980
And if your an all-male crew cooped up on a ship, then you would expect a certain amount of recreational activity to occur,

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:11.000
and a certain amount of sexual activity to occur.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.020
And there will always be prostitution.

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:19.600
But it could not simply be promiscuity.

00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:27.290
The culture of some rural communities in the New World, for example, allows for promiscuity before marriage.

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:37.249
The difference, as the archaeologists at Hull discovered, was just how cosmopolitan these ports were.

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:44.059
The wine came from Spain; the coffin wood was traced to the Baltic forests.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.649
Traces of precious metal from the Far East were found on the friary stones.

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:55.490
Complex international trading, it seems, was an essential feature of life in medieval Hull.

00:44:56.099 --> 00:45:02.419
You're going to have people from the Baltic, which we've seen from the timber trade, and from Spain coming in with the pottery and the wine.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:07.380
We're also gonna have people from the low countries: The Dutch, the French, people coming from Poland.

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:11.660
And because you've got high turnover population, diseases is gonna come in.

00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:21.240
There is another reason why the bacteria had mutated in certain times in the Old World into this horrific sexually-transmitted plague.

00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:27.600
Venereal syphilis is primarily a disease of cities,

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:35.220
of advanced civilizations with advanced health measures and medications.

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.660
Civilization means civilization.

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:54.030
Better hygiene, the wearing of clothes, less sharing of eating and drinking utensils,

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:58.110
means the less dangerous form of the bacteria cannot move around.

00:45:58.690 --> 00:46:00.780
It must mutate to survive.

00:46:06.289 --> 00:46:12.758
The people buried within the Hull friary walls were the sophisticated urban elite of medieval society.

00:46:14.119 --> 00:46:18.459
Amongst such people, the mild form of the disease simply couldn't survive,

00:46:20.029 --> 00:46:25.689
so the syphilis bacteria sought out the warm, sensual parts of the body and waited.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:37.500
The syphilis enigma is finally cracked.

00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:46.840
The bacteria has been in human society for thousands of years. But like all bacteria, it is not fixed in a single form.

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:51.040
As society has changed, so it has changed.

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:58.180
Where climate and social customs permitted, it would thrive as a mild childhood skin disease.

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:08.020
But whenever and wherever social change made that impossible, it has mutated into a terrifying sexually transmitted killer.

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.040
But there is a final twist in the tale.

00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:40.310
For the innocent American Indians tainted for the last 500 years by the accusation that they had given syphilis to the world,

00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.699
history had decreed an even crueler fate.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:53.120
When the Native Indians first encountered Columbus and his crew, they were almost wiped out by the diseases the Europeans carried.

00:47:54.600 --> 00:48:02.840
The Indians survived, just. But with the loss of so many people, they also lost their immunity to syphilis.

00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:10.780
The cycle of protection given to each generation by the existence of the non venereal form of the disease had been broken.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:17.800
And when, in the subsequent centuries, venereal syphilis came in from the Old World,

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:25.260
the result on the native American populations was as devastating as it had been on the Europeans hundreds of years earlier.
