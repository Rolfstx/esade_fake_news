smothering or tilling right after and so
 

00:14:22.299 --> 00:14:25.109 align:start position:0%
smothering or tilling right after and so
we<00:14:22.689><c> just</c><00:14:22.929><c> need</c><00:14:23.110><c> to</c><00:14:23.350><c> basically</c><00:14:23.529><c> be</c><00:14:24.009><c> easy</c><00:14:24.699><c> enough</c>

00:14:25.109 --> 00:14:25.119 align:start position:0%
we just need to basically be easy enough
 

00:14:25.119 --> 00:14:28.289 align:start position:0%
we just need to basically be easy enough
to<00:14:25.179><c> harvest</c><00:14:25.600><c> and</c><00:14:26.049><c> then</c><00:14:26.649><c> we'll</c><00:14:26.829><c> deal</c><00:14:27.040><c> with</c><00:14:27.299><c> so</c>

00:14:28.289 --> 00:14:28.299 align:start position:0%
to harvest and then we'll deal with so
 

00:14:28.299 --> 00:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
to harvest and then we'll deal with so
kind<00:14:28.600><c> of</c><00:14:28.689><c> easy</c><00:14:28.899><c> enough</c><00:14:29.110><c> to</c><00:14:29.170><c> harvest</c><00:14:29.410><c> and</c><00:14:29.649><c> then</c>

00:14:29.699 --> 00:14:29.709 align:start position:0%
kind of easy enough to harvest and then
 

00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:31.889 align:start position:0%
kind of easy enough to harvest and then
we'll<00:14:29.889><c> deal</c><00:14:30.009><c> with</c><00:14:30.040><c> it</c><00:14:30.160><c> and</c><00:14:30.489><c> then</c><00:14:30.910><c> this</c><00:14:31.360><c> tunnel</c>

00:14:31.889 --> 00:14:31.899 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with it and then this tunnel
 

00:14:31.899 --> 00:14:34.109 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with it and then this tunnel
was<00:14:32.410><c> the</c><00:14:32.589><c> first</c><00:14:32.829><c> one</c><00:14:33.009><c> planted</c><00:14:33.429><c> so</c><00:14:33.610><c> we</c><00:14:33.730><c> keep</c><00:14:33.970><c> it</c>

00:14:34.109 --> 00:14:34.119 align:start position:0%
was the first one planted so we keep it
 

00:14:34.119 --> 00:14:37.549 align:start position:0%

tunnels<00:15:21.389><c> is</c><00:15:21.569><c> that</c><00:15:22.139><c> we</c><00:15:22.290><c> are</c><00:15:22.470><c> will</c><00:15:23.009><c> do</c><00:15:23.189><c> a</c><00:15:23.220><c> little</c>

00:15:23.419 --> 00:15:23.429 align:start position:0%
tunnels is that we are will do a little
 

00:15:23.429 --> 00:15:24.949 align:start position:0%
tunnels is that we are will do a little
bit<00:15:23.579><c> less</c><00:15:23.730><c> of</c><00:15:23.879><c> that</c><00:15:23.910><c> and</c><00:15:24.119><c> just</c><00:15:24.540><c> getting</c><00:15:24.869><c> a</c>

00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
bit less of that and just getting a
 

00:15:24.959 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
bit less of that and just getting a
second<00:15:25.350><c> cut</c><00:15:25.559><c> will</c><00:15:26.069><c> be</c><00:15:26.189><c> worth</c><00:15:26.309><c> a</c><00:15:26.459><c> lot</c><00:15:26.579><c> to</c><00:15:26.759><c> us</c><00:15:26.879><c> so</c>

00:15:27.639 --> 00:15:27.649 align:start position:0%
second cut will be worth a lot to us so
 

00:15:27.649 --> 00:15:30.109 align:start position:0%
second cut will be worth a lot to us so
this<00:15:28.649><c> one</c><00:15:28.949><c> will</c><00:15:29.129><c> be</c><00:15:29.249><c> one</c><00:15:29.459><c> cut</c><00:15:29.759><c> because</c>

00:15:30.109 --> 00:15:30.119 align:start position:0%
this one will be one cut because
 

00:15:30.119 --> 00:15:31.369 align:start position:0%
this one will be one cut because
tomatoes<00:15:30.329><c> are</c><00:15:30.629><c> coming</c><00:15:30.869><c> in</c><00:15:30.959><c> as</c><00:15:31.049><c> soon</c><00:15:31.170><c> as</c><00:15:31.290><c> we're</c>

00:15:33.679 --> 00:15:33.689 align:start position:0%
done the other tunnel of sound over that
 

00:15:33.689 --> 00:15:35.809 align:start position:0%
done the other tunnel of sound over that
we've<00:15:33.839><c> got</c><00:15:34.049><c> that'll</c><00:15:34.709><c> be</c><00:15:34.829><c> two</c><00:15:34.980><c> cups</c><00:15:35.160><c> so</c><00:15:35.549><c> this</c><00:15:35.699><c> is</c>

00:15:35.809 --> 00:15:35.819 align:start position:0%
we've got that'll be two cups so this is
 

00:15:35.819 --> 00:15:39.289 align:start position:0%
we've got that'll be two cups so this is

00:15:52.429 --> 00:15:52.439 align:start position:0%
and so our early crops would go in our
 

00:15:52.439 --> 00:15:54.710 align:start position:0%
and so our early crops would go in our

cucumbers and basil so the talent of a
 

00:15:57.449 --> 00:15:59.030 align:start position:0%
cucumbers and basil so the talent of a
