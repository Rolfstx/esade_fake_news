Radio: 32-62

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.400
Radio: We're getting information that she may be around this location...

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.880
Radio: 370 on the way.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.300
Ernie: Ok, who's he? Who are these people?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.094
Officer: Uh, this is her husband.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.860
Ernie: Hey, how you doing? Hey. Officer Stevens. Ernie.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.720
Louis: Louis

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.300
Ernie: Hey Louis, my partner Gabe.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:32.920
Gabe: Hello sir.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.540
Ernie: How long has she been acting this way?

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.560
Louis: It's been since Saturday.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.960
She just believes that I'm having an affair and that I
have a woman that I've gotten pregnant in our ceiling.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.240
Hiding.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.560
Ernie: I'm sorry you're having a bad day.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.720
Woman: It's been the past four days.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.540
Ernie: Past four days have been bad?

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.380
Woman: Yes sir.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.300
Ernie: Ok, well, we're here because we don't want you to have any more bad days. Right?

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.920
We want to get you some help.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.480
In the police academy we had no training on what it was like to deal with someone that was mentally ill 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.720
or in a crisis.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.540
I was probably the last
officer that you wanted to help a loved

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.400
one that was in a mental health crisis.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.060
Woman: She's watching us sleep. And I told him I could be in the living room

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.240
I can hear y'all's whole conversation.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.600
Ernie: So you actually hear this girl...

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.780
Woman: I hear both of them.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.540
Ernie: Okay.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.780
But now in the mental health unit every single call we're responding to is a mental health crisis.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.560
Ernie: I'm not sure, do you hear her right now as we're talking?

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.940
Woman: He's talking to her...

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.720
Ernie: He's talking to her? Cause he's actually out by...

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.200
Woman: If you want to go to my room over here...

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.160
Ernie: You want me to go to your room?

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.680
Woman: I just don't want to say it loud because he's gonna shut up.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.080
Ernie: Are you hearing? You hearing it right now?

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.060
Cause I don't...

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.920
Woman: He's telling her, I need her here.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.520
Ernie: Ok I don't hear anything. I'm sorry. I don't.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.700
I'm just being honest with you. I'm not gonna lie to you.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.880
I'm not saying that I don't believe that you
don't hear him. I believe it is very real for you.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.300
I just don't hear anything right now.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.700
Woman: I don't want to go anywhere.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.060
Ernie: I know you don't.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.380
Woman: I didn't do nothing wrong.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.500
Ernie: You're right. You didn't do anything wrong.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.820
Woman: I'm getting kicked out of my own house because somebody don't come out.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.860
Ernie: You're extremely agitated right
now and stressed out.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.700
Woman: I'm fine. I'm just broken. I'm shattered. My whole heart is shattered.

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.320
Ernie: Okay, you're using words like shattered and broken, okay, if you were my sister, okay, there's no way

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.200
I would leave you in this condition.
There's no way.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.360
Officer: Drop that for me.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.700
Officer: Drop it!

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.240
Officer: Drop it!

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:51.300
Jon: More conservative estimates say that those suffering from a mental illness account for almost 1/4 of all fatalities involving law enforcement.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.300
This slide identifies
every single officer-involved shooting.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.260
All of those that are identified in red
showed some sign of mental illness.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.360
Is there a crisis in the United States when
it comes to mental health issues?

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.980
Absolutely.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.720
Joe: People with mental illness are overrepresented in every aspect of the criminal justice system.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.180
So I work on a specialized unit that only deals with
people in a mental health crisis.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.260
Almost everything about how I respond to calls
goes against what most would believe.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.420
I'm in plainclothes. I drive an unmarked car. My weapon is concealed.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.400
And for the last nine years the only weapon that I've used is my ability to communicate.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.080
Tre: No, I'm a police officer just like him.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.520
I don't want to say we do unconventional policing.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.640
We just approach certain situations differently.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.180
Woman: No, no.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.240
Woman: I know you do.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.760
James: You know you're going to deal with someone in crisis that night. 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.740
You know that someone's gonna need your help.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.020
Ernie: San Antonio police, are you okay?

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.920
Chris: Police have a misconception of mental health.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.780
Alma: I want the old Chris. 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.720
Those voices just have
total control of him. He don't trust anybody.

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.700
Mr. Crump: Mental illness is not unique to the United States of America.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.699
What is unique is this dynamic of unarmed citizens

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.300
being killed by the people who are
supposed to protect and serve us.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.320
Marketta: Is that the first thing that they think of is to pull their weapon and shoot somebody?

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:31.300
No one with mental illness deserves to
die because they're already dying inside. Suffering.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.620
Joe: We have to change the way culturally that we look at how we succeed in police work.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.150
I have an opportunity every single time I'm called

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.860
to change somebody's perspective.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:05:11.360
[Music]

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.720
James: There was an incident that happened in Memphis Tennessee with a young man who

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.330
was fatally shot during an encounter
with police and he had mental illness and

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.040
the department in Memphis realized that there needed to be a program to deal with these types of folks.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.040
How to interact with somebody with a mental illness. How to talk to somebody with a mental illness.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.140
It prompted police department across the nation to start to deal with those folks in our community.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:44.180
[Music]

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.150
There are a lot of folks that are locked
up in prison.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.280
They have an underlying mental health issue.
Our goal is to try to keep these folks out of jail.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.520
James: We got some updates saying that he was asking someone to shoot him? Who is he telling that to?

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.460
James: Well here's the thing Christopher you've got a lot of people here because they're concerned about some things you said.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.140
That's why we're out here.

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:33.660
James: Do you hit walls when you get upset?

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.460
James: Right there? You did that today?

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.400
Tre: If a police officer feels that you're an imminent threat to yourself we can detain you to see a doctor.

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:46.220
That's essentially what an emergency
detention is.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.780
James:  I'm gonna be honest with you man. I'm a straight shooter with you. 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.420
I think we need to go back to the hospital tonight.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.020
Tre: It's not an arrest. Even though we put
handcuffs on you if we have to. 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.840
It doesn't go on arrest record. The police
report is protected by HIPAA so you have privacy rights.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:14.120
James: Christopher you made threats to shoot yourself.

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.740
James: Okay, I'm going to go get some shoes for you, okay. I'll be back.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.220
Joe: The choice of you deciding if we're gonna go or not go that's been removed.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:32.400
You're gonna go. How we leave here is up
to you. Where we go is up to you.

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.520
If you have a facility you'd like to go to tell
me.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.800
James: I can't I can't... We're gonna make a phone call and see what we can get you. 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.000
Joe: If you want to fight and me call more people and we have to carry you out and break

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.540
half your stuff in the house then let's
do it. I don't want to do that and you

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:51.380
know you don't want to do that.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:54.300
James: You didn't do anything wrong. 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.500
James: We just don't want the wrong response to come out here because you're punching holes and stuff. 

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.340
Tre: We're just gonna close the door nice and slow. Okay?

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.220
Yes sir.

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:12.160
 
[Music]

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:21.320
Tre: I think that ended up going really well. He went from 100 to 0, not 0 to 100.

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.160
James: Okay sir. Let's go and walk through
this single door over here and then we'll

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.100
get you right to the ER. Okay? Perfect.

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:29.920
Tre: See. I told you we'd get you to an ER.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.180
James: I get frustrated with the system and
the fact that there's just not enough

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.600
resources for a mental health. And it's
frustrating because it's become a police matter.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.580
Because it has become a police matter
we're expected to fix the situation.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.840
The reality is we can't fix every
situation.

00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.920
Jon: From 1955 to 1977 the number

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:55.760
of people in state hospitals suffering from mental illness dropped from 75% to 7%.

00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.120
 What happened to all those people? Where did they go?

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.710
I mean they just didn't disappear. When
they were released from the hospitals

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:08.920
they were released to the community.
Problem was there was no groundwork for it.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:14.660
There was no local mental health
authority. We moved them from the state hospitals

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:19.190
 to the penal system which now
became the largest provider of mental

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:21.240
health services in the country.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:27.320
 Basically what happened with deinstitutionalization was the people that were in the hospitals were released into

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.820
the society and told to fend for yourself.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:37.500
[Music]

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:50.040
Chris: And I hate when they put messages and little writings and sayings and crap

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.920
like on my head just because they want to
play around and make fun of me.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:59.000
They put sensors in me and stuff to make
me shake and wobble

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.620
like if I'm wired or something. And I'm not.

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:15.440
[Music]

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.380
Martha: The police have come here several times

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.300
and they know Christopher on a
first-name basis and they also know me

00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:27.640
on a first-name basis because of the
amount of times that they've gone over to the home.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:31.600
Chris: She's the one making my life
worse and miserable. Her and my grandma

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.000
they're the worst people ever. 

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:39.319
The doctors said I was bipolar depressive and major depressive. They labeled me schizophrenic because of the hearing

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.920
aids they put in me. And I barely got
labeled schizophrenic because of these.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:51.300
Martha: I just saw that. That just happened last night. It's a burn from the lighter.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.860
So I don't like him you know
with matches or with any kind of lighters.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.760
Alma: I want the old Chris. 

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.200
Alma: Yeah. The one we used to have fun. 

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:16.840
Alma: Chris is a great guy.  He is funny. He's generous and for him to go through all this it hurts.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:23.960
You know these voices just took over his
whole life. He don't trust anybody.

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:34.660
Chris: I see a picture that looks like a man
and not my grandma. That's not my grandma.

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.259
Take off the hair

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.580
that's a man.

00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:47.660
Female filmmaker: Chris I'm wondering - are you okay
that I'm filming you? 

00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:54.200
Chris: I don't mind. I don't mind. I'll let you do this. It don't
bother me because I need to get this off my chest.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.480
Female filmmaker: I asked him if it was okay if I filmed 

00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:03.570
and he said: "yeah, you can film, I need to get this off my chest"

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:07.339
Martha: Oh he did? Okay well then good. Thank you.

00:12:07.339 --> 00:12:12.060
There's a lot of heartless people here. A lot. Or maybe a lot of people that just

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:17.579
aren't educated enough as to the illness.
They don't have the medication to calm

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:23.480
them down so they act erratic and you,
you, wouldn't know that unless you were told.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:29.360
Like I told him - I said someone's gonna
you know hurt you. You know they might

00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:37.320
not know that you're not all there and
you can get hurt just like that boy that

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.040
was in Houston. They really didn't
understand what he was going through.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.440
News reporter: Cellphone video that surfaced
shows Thomas walking towards the deputy

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:39.240
with his pants around his ankles. The
deputy had ordered Thomas to stop and

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.830
when he continued forward the deputy
shot and killed Thomas. It was found that

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:48.750
Thomas did not have a weapon.
Deputy Brewer was carrying a taser at

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:50.900
the time of the shooting but didn't use
it.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.280
Sheriff Gonzalez: Any loss of life is always of serious

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.080
serious concern. From his immediate
actions it looked like something was

00:13:57.090 --> 00:14:01.860
going on, some kind of crisis situation
was happening at the time with him.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:06.540
Thomas had a history of mental illness.
Marketta Thomas says her brother was

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:09.120
having trouble dealing with a family
tragedy.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:12.740
His wife stands accused of drowning
their two children.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:17.420
Marketta: You could have tased him.  You clearly could have tased him. 

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:24.160
He wasn't trying to hit you, he wasn't trying to shoot you, he wasn't trying to do anything.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.600
Marketta: Danny lived with me here. I got his
clothes over there in the bucket. 

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:43.060
I haven't touched that because how it's
folded in there is exactly how he folded it.

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:48.180
 I wear some of his stuff just
to kind of like feel close to him.

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:56.199
Marketta: That day of the shooting, like,  I was
inside Walmart five to ten minutes away

00:14:56.199 --> 00:15:02.170
from the location. I just get this phone call -
they're like your brother's in trouble

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.319
your brother's going to jail. And I hear
these people in the background like

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:09.720
screaming screaming screaming. I'm just like 
what is, like,  is it that serious?

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:14.880
 Like what's going on? And then I
get like this real horrible feeling in

00:15:14.889 --> 00:15:17.519
the pit of my stomach.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:26.790
I just felt like my whole
spirit lost my body that day. I just felt

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:31.820
so empty and numb. My whole life
changed.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:43.560
We grew up together. We were very close. We kept each other on track for like so long and I think he kind of like

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:49.160
put his feelings aside and his emotions
aside to make sure that I was okay.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:56.700
He always wanted to be tough and put on
that exterior, like okay, but he went

00:15:56.700 --> 00:16:03.120
through a traumatic experience losing
his kids and deep down inside like he

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.440
was broken.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.800
Marketta: How's school? I want to tell you about this jacket. It's too hot.  

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.040
Sean: Oh, come on.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.640
Marketta: Hi Mila. 

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:20.840
 Sean: It's my jacket!

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:23.780
Marketta: How's school?

00:16:23.780 --> 00:16:24.580
Mila: Good.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.980
Marketta: Since everything happened with his uncle Danny he's just, you know, his schoolwork has taken a

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.880
little bit. I think he's trying to still
process it.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:17:00.740
[Music]

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.420
Mr. Crump: Statistics bear out that if you're
mentally ill and you're black that you

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:12.829
already have two strikes against you
when you encounter law enforcement.

00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:20.180
Just because you are having a mental ill crisis
does not mean you should encounter the

00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:25.730
death penalty executed by a police
officer on a street corner.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:31.440
We will be looking at the training of
this deputy as well. 

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:37.600
Marketta: I just hope and pray that my brother's life is justified and not swept under the  rug.  

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:44.280
No one with mental illness deserves to die because they're
already dying inside suffering. 

00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.840
I'm asking you to please give my brother
justice and his children.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:55.720
[Music]

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:03.600
Ernie: I would venture to say that at some
point somebody that has a mental illness

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:09.620
has been mistreated by law enforcement.
Is that a fair statement? Absolutely it is.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.040
Our job is to try to change that on
our side. Okay?

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:19.400
Our job is to try to break the stigma,
try to teach better skills, try to teach better outcomes.

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:26.820
Jon: My goal here is that no
one in this room ends up as the next

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.640
viral YouTube sensation. 

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:32.060
When you go out
and you handle a consumer that's in

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.660
crisis and you talk to them and you
de-escalate them and you put them in

00:18:36.669 --> 00:18:41.919
your car is that gonna end up on YouTube?
No. Nobody wants to see that. They want to

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:44.860
see those first responders that get out
there and yell and scream and go

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:48.630
hands-on and fight with them. That's what
ends up on YouTube.

00:18:48.630 --> 00:18:54.240
[Music]

00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:58.560
James: Today we're gonna talk about active
listening, how that applies to you,

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.900
what you guys do every day. All of us in here have made a mental health or a mental

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.340
disturbance call at some point. Communication is a basic tactical skill in crisis intervention.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.520
Tre: Crisis intervention training, it trains you to

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:14.420
recognize when someone is in crisis. When
you recognize there's a mental health

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.900
component and instead of just grabbing
them tacking to the ground you're trying

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.580
to talk to them and get them to get help.

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.200
James: My homeroom teacher called y'all man? I'm sorry she wasted y'all's time man. You know what?

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:30.280
I made one silly comment earlier, just kind of venting, and she took it way too far.

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.380
James: Couple weeks ago, man, I slid in to
second  and shattered my ankle in several places

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.660
so I just found out today I lost my
scholarship. I had a full scholarship to go play ball.

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:42.830
I have no backup plan like
that was it. Go to college play ball go

00:19:42.830 --> 00:19:46.910
pro. That was it. And all I said was you
know what I just wish I was dead. 

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.480
You know that what's the point of living I
can't play baseball no more.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.900
James: Good job man! 

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:17.300
When we get in a situation where we're suicidal we get tunnel vision so all I kept thinking about was my failure

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.330
I was think about myself. I wasn't even
thinking about my mom. So you're giving me

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:23.810
options to kind of get me out of that
phase man. And you can't tell me what

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.810
what's best for me as far as a plan. I'm
gonna have to figure that out. But like you

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.570
said you're giving me some options to start
thinking about. So that was good.

00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:33.260
In order to get anybody to do anything you
ask them to do you got to build some

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.620
type of rapport. If it's done properly
it's reassuring and you're gonna

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.190
establish an understanding about the
person that you're dealing with.

00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.730
Student: Is something bothering you at work?
Something going on at work? 

00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:46.520
Joe: I don't know what you want from me. I didn't do anything wrong. 

00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:47.580
Student: No you...    Joe: I chose...

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.100
Joe: Can I talk? 

00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:48.700
Student: Yes, sir.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.500
Joe: Thank you.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.700
You'd ask me a question. It's a good open-ended question and I'm giving you an answer and as I'm talking

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:57.940
you would interrupt me to ask me something else and completely throw me off. 

00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:02.220
I know your intentions are good. I know that you are you're trying to get to the bottom of it but it feels

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:04.700
like you're trying to rush to the cause
because you want to fix it.

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:08.420
Tre: There's a difference between when you hear somebody and you're listening to them.

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:12.260
Hearing is an action and listening is a
process.

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:17.940
Tre: Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up. You're not the FBI I called the FBI last Tuesday and they weren't there.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.900
Tre: I've seen you before. You're part of that red light team back in the 20's. I remember you.

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:31.860
Tre: You ever notice that there are little focuses? When you get that window of like somebody's paying attention to you

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:34.540
can you say focus on me focus on me.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.540
Ernie: Christopher Lopez!

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:42.260
Joe: CIT is great. It's 40 hours. I think 40 hours of mental health training in a police academy that is seven

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:46.290
and a half months long isn't long enough. I
think we should do six to eight weeks of

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:50.970
training. I think we should spend a vast
majority of our time perfecting

00:21:50.970 --> 00:21:55.350
communication and then you can spend a
little bit of time training them on how

00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:59.820
to shoot your gun because most officers
go their entire career never doing that.

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.540
Tre: Hey that was a real call that I went on. They get interesting.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:16.200
 
[Music]

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:20.640
James: And does he have a mental health
diagnosis of any sorts like

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.580
James: And is he taking his
medications as prescribed or does he

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.680
have access to any?

00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.140
James: Is he making any type of suicidal statements or statements to

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.580
harm other people as well? 

00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:51.620
James: Is he hearing voices or seeing things that aren't there, experiencing those type of hallucinations?

00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:54.780
James: ok.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.520
Tre: Again my name is Trey

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:01.539
so what you're telling me Chris is these
people are beating you up right there,

00:23:01.539 --> 00:23:04.989
they're putting charges on you,
they're stealing your SIM cards. How long

00:23:04.989 --> 00:23:05.660
has it been going on?

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.260
Tre: Nine years? That's that's a lot of stress man.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.240
You look a little tired Chris. 

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:30.360
Tre: So Chris what we'd like
to do tonight, Chris, is is take you...

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.460
Tre: I do respect that you know you don't want to go anywhere

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:43.800
but unfortunately Chris you know...

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.040
Tre: You do have a
choice in how you go okay...

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.540
We don't want to put you in handcuffs...

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.860
Tre: don't want you to get hurt. I don't want to get hurt. Okay?

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.520
Tre: Okay. We have to go.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:17.260
James: Just relax man, just relax...

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:22.720
James: Just relax man, just relax, just relax...

00:24:23.900 --> 00:24:24.700
Just relax.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:38.800
Tre: Relax Chirs, relax.

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.260
Tre: I don't want to hurt you man.

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.380
Officer: We don't want to hurt you. Okay? Alright.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:48.720
[Screams]

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:50.240
Tre: Alright Chris.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.500
Ok. We just want to see you get in front of a doctor. Okay?

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:54.740
Tre: Yes. Serrano.

00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.060
Officer: Watch your step guys.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:59.320
Chris: Get Tre arrested!

00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:05.480
Tre: We just want to see you get help man. That's all it was.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.060
All right Chris. 

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:15.320
James: Let me get MEDCOM added and we'll get him going.

00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:21.440
Tre: See that's why I do Jiu-Jitsu man. Then I don't have to use that much force just get his hands and that's it.

00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.960
He was strong.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.960
Officer: My concern was the dog...

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:34.440
James: Officer Williams 1725. Was calling to see if we
could take a patient to the hospital

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:38.680
he is a bit combative. Having some
mental decompensation. 

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.720
Tre: I know we had to take him to the ground but I was just trying not to hurt him make sure he

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.660
didn't hurt us.

00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.320
Tre: Yes ma'am yes ma'am.
usually when he goes to the hospital

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.520
Tre: I don't think they'll release him in the
morning.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:06.340
Even though we took her son to the ground even though we had to use force to put him into handcuffs then

00:26:06.340 --> 00:26:10.820
basically lift him and carry him out of
the house she still thanked me for the

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:15.880
way I talked to him and that is the
bread and butter of why we do what we do

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.680
is because these people are not
criminal. They just, they have an illness.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:22.300
I guarantee you he won't remember us though.

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:24.800
James: No he won't he was so
decompensated.

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.100
Tre: But the family will for sure.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:33.600
Tre: Chris, I respect that you don't wanna be
here man I know you don't want to be here.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.580
Chris: No, if you were to respect and you would have left
me alone.

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.520
Tre: But we're just trying to get you some help man.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.620
Chris: No
you're not, no you're not. 

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:49.140
Tre: For somebody that said you should have left him there. Why have a conflict and fight him on the ground to

00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:51.070
get him into the hospital when you could
have just left him there.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:55.330
My response is he's not getting any
better if anything he's gonna get worse

00:26:55.330 --> 00:27:00.429
and when mental illnesses get worse
their delusions get larger and they get

00:27:00.429 --> 00:27:04.760
more vivid. That is way too much of a
potential for other people to get hurt

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.200
[Music]

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:16.640

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.560
James: Hello. Alright.

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.600

Marketta: We're headed back to the DA's office to
see where we're at in the process of the case.

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:03.880
 I'm hoping they give me some
answers and not you know yet again like

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.440
we're doing the best that we can. I just
don't feel too confident in a lot of

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:14.290
things that law enforcement is doing.
Officers are protected to the fullest

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:18.160
extent by law enforcement.
I feel like this guy's still being

00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:24.000
protected even though he's not employed
with law enforcement anymore.

00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.120
Marketta: I know it was hard for you I know

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:54.120
it's hard for you Sean but he thought
uncle Danny was gonna harm him he.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:01.480
Marketta: We know uncle Danny didn't mean no harm we
know. We know uncle Danny was not that

00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:08.120
type of guy. We don't know what was going
on with Cameron. Why did he take a broken

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:15.100
man's life. Right now my job is to
prepare you guys for the world out there

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:25.840
because it's not gonna be easy for you
and I say you because of the color of your skin.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:31.880
And this is very hurtful for
me because my son wanted to be a police

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:37.880
officer. Now he says mom I don't want to
be that police officer that kills people

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:44.780
like they did my uncle Danny. He said
that he don't he don't want to harm

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:47.280
innocent people

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:54.020
Joe: You can break down every deadly force
encounter in this country with law

00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:59.420
enforcement - it all comes down to in that
moment that officer was afraid and they

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:02.960
reacted some overreacted.

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:08.440
[Music]

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.720
Jon: Am I gonna sit up here and tell you that
when you deal with somebody that's in

00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:16.160
crisis that we're not gonna use force on
them that we can talk everybody down

00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:20.480
absolutely not.
Let's be honest there are some people

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:24.470
that we need to go hands-on with there
are some people that need to be tased

00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:30.200
and the reality is that unfortunately
it's some people need to be shot.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:34.560
Ernie: Alright, let's go see how you do.

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.520
 A lot of people don't know how police departments are trained.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.440
We are trained to shoot to stop the
threat.  

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:47.040
Hey! Put the gun down! Put the gun down! Put it down! Put it down! Don't do it! Don't do it! Don't do it!

00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.440
Put it down! Put it down!

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:57.120
We are not trained to shoot somebody in the leg. We're not trained to shoot the knife out of your hand. 

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.780
I'm sorry this is not an episode of TJ
Hooker this is real life.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:05.320
Actor: Watch me and everything that I do. I'm so sick and tired of you guys.

00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.620
Gabe: Just want to talk to you. Put the knife down.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:07.460
Actor: What are you going to do?

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:08.100
Ernie: Relax!

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.520
Just put, put the knife down.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:15.240
Actor: Ok. Ok. I'll do whatever you want. I don't like it. I'll do it.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:16.560
Ernie: Thank you.

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.800
You know if you're if you're not
protecting yourself or somebody else you

00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:22.660
could be killed that day.

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:25.800
Officer: It could go the other way too. Here we go. Do it the other way now. 

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.820
Actor: What are you going to do?

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:28.000
Ernie: You're not in trouble. Put the knife down.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.300
Actor: I'm so sick and tired of you guys.

00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:30.600
Ernie: Put the knife down!

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:34.900
Actor: What are you going to do? I don't want anymore of your crap! Yeah. That's what I'm talking about!

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.280
[Shots]

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:42.900
Interviewer: It seems like a contradiction like what you
have to do on a daily basis you find

00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:50.380
your hip have the power to end someone's
life but yet what you're trying to do is

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:57.200
save someone's life. And so uh. Those are. You know like how do you...

00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:04.380
Tre: So I think me walking into a situation, I have the power to 

00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:09.070
I guess essentially end
someone's life. But I don't see this as

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:14.630
something to end somebody's life I see
this as a tool to stop a threat and I

00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:21.800
think just from training and constant
courses I always see I see a firearm as

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:30.530
a tool to stop a threat so I think once
it becomes that language it's not so

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:46.520
much that I look at a person... I don't... I
want... I think I was gonna say I don't

00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:54.680
look as a person as a person... I do see
them as a person but I I'm more so just

00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:05.570
I you know I I think I just put on my
cop hat and see people as... I don't know... I don't know

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.990
how to answer that.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.550
Joe: The reality is that if we wake up we can't
undo what's been done

00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:21.420
law enforcement is very much involved in
the front lines of people at their worst in a crisis.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.300
Should the rules of engagement change because someone is mentally ill?

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:33.900
Ernie: Gun gun gun! Put the gun
down Marcus! Get to cover! Get to cover! Put it down!

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:35.320
Actor: Back off!

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.520
Ernie: We will. Just put the gun down so we can talk to you.

00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:45.820
Marketta: If I had a family member that was going through a mental breakdown I would not call the police I

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.000
would not.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.360
Ernie: I can talk to you better if you put the gun down.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:52.780
Let's just talk about this for a second. You're alright.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:53.660
Actor: Leave me alone!

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:54.380
Ernie: You're ok!

00:34:54.540 --> 00:35:00.120
Marketta: Knowing what I know now. Why would you when you know what they're capable of doing.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.740
 Ernie: It's ok Marcus. 

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.320
Gabe: We just wanna help you Marcus. Put the gun down. Let's help you.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:08.100
[Music]

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:19.670
Jon: Why do we have a crisis with mental
health? It's money like everything else.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:25.010
Texas is 48th in the nation when it
comes to mental health spending.

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:29.260
If you have an unfunded patient with no
insurance who pays for that?

00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.460
You can't expect the private agencies to
pay for it without support and still survive

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:40.359
because there's a lot of people
with mental illness with no insurance

00:35:40.359 --> 00:35:46.730
but let's be honest that takes money.
There's got to be money available.

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:53.160
Spending for mental health services has
continually been cut. These are all the

00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:58.290
different things that have led up to why
we're seeing an increase in the number

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:03.400
of calls we get why we're dealing with
people with mental crisis.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:10.700
[Music]

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:23.500
Ernie: Hey brother, this is the SARIC BOLO that went out for the guy that

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:28.380
threatened to shoot police officers. I've
got a couple officers coming with me in plainclothes.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.680
Alright so the backstory on this guy

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:34.820
is he posted a bunch of stuff on
Facebook. This post right here: "I was

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:39.100
thinking you know if I was willing to
kill a cop today you know what's gonna happen".

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.080
He posted a picture of himself
holding a gun with his birthday and then

00:36:43.099 --> 00:36:49.099
his R.I.P rest in peace date of it being
2018. Okay. We'll approach him. I'll tell

00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:52.910
him keep his just his hands up and once he's
clear then we're gonna just build

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:57.020
rapport with him. If he has a weapon
inside the apartment we're gonna go

00:36:57.020 --> 00:37:01.099
ahead and do a seizure on that weapon.
His mom informed us that he has bipolar

00:37:01.099 --> 00:37:03.740
disorder and that really he just needs
help.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.820
I hope he remains calm.

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.280
Gabe: There he is.       Ernie: Yup, yup, yup.

00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:15.080
Ernie: So he's got his hands in front of him. Good.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.000
Ernie: Hey Larry.
I'm the one you talked to on the phone

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.860
Me and my partner Gabe. Okay.  

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:24.420
Gabe: Hey Larry. I'm Gabe.

00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:25.720
Ernie: Ok. No weapons on you right now?

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.020
Larry: No, no sir.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:29.420
Ernie: Do you mind if we check? Ok, just a phone.

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.700
Your mental health - where have you received treatment in the past?

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:37.700
Ernie: Because your mom said that was part of

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.270
the struggle is that you're having
difficulty and seeing a doctor because

00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:42.780
money is an issue and all that.

00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:54.839
Ernie: But what we saw was the threats were
really a cry for help. I mean that's what

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:58.920
that was I was you asking for help. How
long have you been feeling like this?

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.140
Ernie: Okay. Childhood trauma?

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.800
Ernie: Your mom told us a little bit okay?

00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:11.940
That's a lot to deal with man. Unresolved trauma it's a beast man.

00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:15.340
 We actually have
clinicians and therapists that work

00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:21.810
directly with our unit so it's very easy
for us to get you to see a doctor. Okay?

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.020
This is no different from you going
to the doctor and saying hey I got a

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:29.280
sore throat. All we're saying is hey I'm
having some sore thoughts right now and

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:34.140
I need help with that. Okay? It's the same
thing. I'm glad that we got to intervene

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.000
before you know this became serious.

00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.980
Ernie: Because we want to help you man. I mean
it. I don't want you feeling like this.

00:38:44.380 --> 00:38:47.940
Gabe: We're going to call MEDCOM and find out where we're gonna take him and then we'll go from there.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:53.060
Ernie: You look at parkland
over in Florida, the FBI had information

00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:58.050
Facebook posts that this kid had made these threats.

00:38:58.050 --> 00:39:02.430
Thank goodness that there's a program
like this in place where somebody

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:07.410
captured what he said and didn't just
say oh my goodness threat look out send

00:39:07.410 --> 00:39:10.859
a SWAT team in to get this guy. It's hey
there's some mental health issues. Let's

00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:14.660
send in mental health and offer services
to him because he's going to get a lot

00:39:14.660 --> 00:39:18.680
better services going to mental health
than going to jail.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:40.160
[Music]

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:45.400
Martha: The officers advised me when they left
here that they were going to take him to

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.980
the mental health unit to get evaluated
and that he would get the assistance that he needed.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:56.800
 The following morning the
nurse contacted me and said that he had

00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:02.140
told her he was not ill. He didn't need
any medication and he refused services

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:06.850
and he was ready to go home. I asked her
you know isn't there anything you can do

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:10.540
you know to keep him you know to make
sure he gets some kind of medical

00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:14.320
assistance some kind of medication to
calm him down to you know make the

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:18.580
voices go away and she says no as long
as he refuses services they can't help him.

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:21.700
And so he walked out of there and
walked home.

00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:35.060

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.280
Alma: I love. This is the picture I love of Chris. Where is it?

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:41.860
That's how Chris looked. 

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.060
Filmmaker: Oh wow. He's a lot thinner now.

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:49.760
Martha: Yeah, it's taking a toll on him.
Alma: Yeah he's changed a lot. Look at that smile on his face.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.880
Chris: That's my sweatshirt but that's a different man.

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.280
Filmmaker: Who's that? 

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.840
Chris: That's supposed to be me
but that's not me. 

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.840
Alma: This picture was taken here maybe a few years ago.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:05.100
Martha: I never noticed any signs of the bipolar

00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:09.180
schizophrenic until maybe about five six
years ago.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:17.480
Chris: I know these people these faces aren't my family or my sister but these faces are the faces of the death

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:23.200
because there's always something hidden
in background.

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:30.540
Alma: Everything reminds me of him. Because I honestly didn't see my life without him.

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:45.980
 Happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday dear Christopher happy birthday to you.

00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:50.840
Filmmaker: So Chris right now we're making a
documentary. You know that right? 

00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:51.700
Chris: Yes. Yes Sir.

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.240
Filmmaker: You remember when we talked about this?

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:56.000
Yeah. And I didn't sign the papers. Yeah. 

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:58.280
Filmmaker: And you're ok with us?

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:04.120
Chris: Right now I'm ok with you filming this yeah, because this is a lot to get off my chest.

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:10.920
I think police have a misconception of mental health. Police don't understand people with the

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:15.600
mental illness because they see a
conception of somebody that is a threat to them.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:18.440
Chris: That's bullsh-t, I didn't do sh-t.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.540
My thing is that when they arrested me they used too much force.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.860
Get your hands out of my pockets!

00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:26.080
Tre: We've just got to search you before you get into the police car.

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:28.560
Chris: Nah! This is all fake! This is all fake!

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:31.960
Look, if somebody's calm and collected and
telling you get the hell out of my house

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:37.420
cause you don't really belong here at all,
don't come at him roughly.

00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:40.280
Tre: We just want to get you in front of a doctor. Okay Chris?

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.460
Chris: I'm fine. I don't need a doctor. I need people to stop f---ing with me.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:48.140
Try and soothe them down in order to figure out
what's wrong with them. If he starts

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:54.000
agitating or angry you just calm down
and say: "Okay well maybe we could talk it out.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.359
Is there something bothering you we
could talk about?" I didn't need help I

00:42:58.359 --> 00:43:02.010
needed them to stop bugging me

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:14.860

00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:25.600
something and I know it wasn't his fault and when
people say like you're gonna be alright

00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:30.470
you're gonna be alright like I'm never
gonna be alright for a long time cause I don't feel

00:44:30.470 --> 00:44:35.059
a connection with nobody like I did with
Danny. I want somebody to reach out to me

00:44:35.059 --> 00:44:38.690
like hey are you okay like do you need
me like do you need to talk to me like

00:44:38.690 --> 00:44:46.420
whatever. I don't get that man. I just
feel so alone man like it's so hard. 

00:44:46.420 --> 00:44:52.579
Lisa: You're a leader. You have been given a lot and
when I say that I mean knowledge and

00:44:52.579 --> 00:44:58.220
wisdom so there will always be much more
expected of you more than you even want

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:03.560
to give. Now that's not to say you won't
get tired but Marketta get your second wind,

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:11.520
 dust yourself off baby and get up
and go again. It has not being in vain, Marketta.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:14.780
 I promise you it has not been
in vain.

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:22.470
Marketta: Like in the black community some of us
feel like we don't need help to cope

00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:28.110
with what we know we need help with
because we don't want people to presume

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:33.820
like we're crazy or like we're less than
human. That's gonna take a toll on you mentally.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:34.760
Cousin: Turn sideways.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.540
Cousin: You fired.

00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:39.320
Man behind camera: Oooh, I’m seein them gold teeth...

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.620
[Laughter]

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.420
Marketta: If I show you a sign of weakness then you would think I'm weak.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:50.900
 It's like a revolving door and we don't want that

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:54.760
door no more. We don't want that cycle. We don't.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:05.340
Ernie: A mental health call came in. The Navy
Department is calling in on a welfare

00:46:05.350 --> 00:46:10.390
check on a twenty-nine-year-old who is messaging
other sailors that he's thinking of

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:14.520
hurting himself and ending it all. They
said there may be weapons in the house

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.020
The last message they got was about an
hour ago from him. 

00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:23.940
I don't have much details about what happened. Just that you sent some text messages out that

00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:25.720
were concerning. Can you talk to me about
that? 

00:46:25.980 --> 00:46:30.140
Vet: It's not a good time of year. Like I lost my mom on my last deployment in 2015.

00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:30.740
Ernie: I'm sorry 

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:36.040
Vet: And I wasn't able to say goodbye or anything like that. So I'm like a combat vet.

00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:39.940
There's like zero decompression time from
Afghanistan through another deployment

00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.230
and then getting home. Ever since my mom
died I've always you know been like you

00:46:44.230 --> 00:46:47.230
know what I don't really want to be here
anymore. I've been working through it and

00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:51.370
the fact that you know reached out to
people was a huge step for me and you

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.750
know I told people in the text message you
know I might not come back.

00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:57.300
Ernie: What do you mean by "I might not come
back."

00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:04.360
Vet: I'm like you know I might consider hurting myself or killing myself while I was out here.

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:07.540
Like I discussed with her before I came out here and it was just something on my mind and stuff like that

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:11.950
and nothing real like hey how you gonna
do it like let's go buy a gun and put it and...

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:12.920
Nothing like that.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.420
Ernie: So no plan?

00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:14.140
Vet: No, no.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:15.680
Ernie: Just thoughts, fleeting thoughts?

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:16.560
Vet: So just, um...

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.780
Ernie: Okay. I appreciate you being being honest.

00:47:19.780 --> 00:47:22.720
Do you have concerns right now for Christopher?

00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.740
Woman: Yes.

00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.060
Ernie: Okay. What? What are your concerns?

00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.820
Woman: I just worry that one day he's

00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.140
not just gonna be upset and he's going to do something and I'm going to lose him.

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:32.320
Ernie: Are you worried that he's in that state of mind right now?

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.300
Woman: I didn't know how bad work had gotten. He had closed me out to that.

00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:38.900
Ernie: So you've never been diagnosed with depression, PTSD? 

00:47:38.900 --> 00:47:42.600
Vet: Just PTSD. I have super
vivid nightmares.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:51.860
And I've lost four... No it's five, five of my
Marines in the last calendar year to suicide.

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:54.640
And then one of my buddies
said I went to Afghanistan with, 

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.920
his wife just out of the blue killed herself. 

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.860
Ernie: It's 22 a day. You know that right? It's 22 veterans a day and I don't want you to be a statistic man.

00:48:01.860 --> 00:48:03.440
 I do not want that. 

00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:08.240
I want to make the right choice. You know. I want us to

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:12.320
make the right choice for you on your
well-being. Okay?

00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:16.700
So I got to know 100%, are you
thinking of suicide today?

00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:18.460
No? 

00:48:18.460 --> 00:48:20.540
Will you call me if things change

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.020
Vet: I will.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.160
Ernie: Promise?

00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:29.280
I just want to make sure that you're not gonna be
overwhelmed. You feel comfortable in this

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.120
situation right now?

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:32.440
Woman: And I'm not afraid to call for help if I need to.

00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:36.020
Ernie: You've seen your fair share of trauma for sure being a corpsman.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.980
We get that asked all the time, you know,

00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.340
who checks on you guys?

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:40.600
Woman: Nobody.

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:42.980
Ernie: We kind of check on each other.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:49:06.960
[Music]

00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.540
Chris: I know she's not my mom

00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:17.660
I know for a fact she's not my mom. I
know that's not my grandma for a fact.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:21.340
They want someone to take control of my
system and nobody's gonna take control

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:28.380
my system. I got my key right here.

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:37.400
I move the house. I move everything. I'm me. I'm the
only one.  Everybody thinks I'm crazy.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Martha: That's not our stuff.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.100
Chris put that stuff away that's not
ours.

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:48.900
Martha: They're not ours.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:52.400
Martha: Not in my name.

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:01.500
Martha: Alright Chris, that's enough.

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.580
Martha: You really need to stop.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.560
No you don't. That's enough.

00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.360
Martha: Yeah I did.

00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.440
Martha: Hell yeah I did.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:26.300
Martha: Excuse you.
You know what you need to stop right now.

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.000
Martha: Go walk outside so we can call the
police on you. Okay? Go on.

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:35.140
Martha: Well then leave Christopher.

00:50:35.140 --> 00:50:36.880
Chris: No, you leave my house!

00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:37.760
Martha: That's enough.

00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:06.480
Filmmaker: What's your biggest fear?

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:12.100
Martha: That, that, he, uhm, that he hurts someone.

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.480
[Music]

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.560
Alma: I really don't like to think about it.

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.020
 I mean I even kept things for my kids that they

00:51:29.020 --> 00:51:33.059
don't know about that he did to me
because I didn't want them to hate him

00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:36.340
for something that he didn't have
control of. 

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:39.640
Once he said the voices

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:44.440
told him something, I don't know. Well
I had a different necklace and he got my

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:51.670
necklace and he was choking me and I had
the marks. I called Martha and I told her

00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:55.620
I go "please come, he choked me and
I'm scared."

00:51:55.620 --> 00:52:02.720
I was never scared of him until that
time and so she ended up calling the police

00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:05.680
but I didn't let the cops see my neck.

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.580
I had, I put on my hoodie, I covered my myself.

00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:23.340
Chris: I'm not a violent man towards anybody, unless it's self-defense.

00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:34.140
Filmmaker: So we've spent two nights now going back with Chris.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:35.660
Tre: Uh-huh. How's he doing?

00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:42.500
Filmmaker: Not good. And I'm pretty sure the night after you guys were there he was released the next morning.

00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:43.680
Tre: Holy-moly.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:48.840
James: I can't believe they released him that quickly.

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.800
Do you tell me this person is safe after
one day to go back to his mom after he's

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.220
already believing his mom is not his mom.

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:55.920
Tre: And his mom is dead.

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:59.700
James: And his mom is dead. This person is a threat to him that he may harm. That's crazy.

00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.960
Now here's the thing, what if he did go
home that night and killed his mom?

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.060
Who's responsible for that? The hospital.

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.500
Tre: That's where they fail people.

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:17.620
We do an efficient job for what we have to get
them to the hospital. But you know, we're

00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:21.970
not treatment facilities we're a police
department and he's still not well he

00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:26.440
needs extended treatment he needs some
kind of follow-up care or inpatient care.

00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:31.300
Now he's back out and and still really
really decompensated. Now you're gonna

00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:36.160
put more officers you know in danger
because this person doesn't know what

00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.960
their actions can potentially do.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:41.340
James: So the call we're going to, the lady is calling saying

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:43.660
she's having thoughts to kill her
mother's dog. This has been going on for

00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:48.700
six months. She's diagnosed with PTSD and
bipolar and she is taking medication

00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:51.920
daily and she'll be waiting at the door
for officers when they get there. No weapons.

00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.760
James: You did the right thing by calling
us tonight. That's the first step.

00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:00.180
Woman: Yeah, you get little hiccups even
though you think you're cured. You never are.

00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:03.600
I've been ran around so much through the system sadly.

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:05.550
Tre: Put through the system, what do
you mean by that?

00:54:05.550 --> 00:54:10.460
Woman: My mother has helped me to try to stay
in but they just let you go. 

00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:13.480
I've been ignored like I said so many times. They
didn't care. 

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:16.020
James: So you've been ignored more than you'd like to?

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.080
Woman: Oh yeah, I've even been threatened. Either you take 

00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:23.099
your medications or you're going to get shot up
with the needle. A doctor even told me

00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:26.780
and looked in my face told me just take
was you're supposed to and then you'll get out.

00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:33.820
At one point I had about $2,000 worth of
 medications and I only made like $600 a month.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.720
[Music]

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:42.580
Tre: The mental hospitals, why aren't they
doing their job? They have one job and

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:45.660
that's to stabilize patients. We have
like eight jobs. 

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.460
Joe: CIT is fantastic but it's

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:54.119
one cog of the wheel. Right? If I have a
person who's in crisis out there on the

00:54:54.119 --> 00:54:57.480
street and I go out there and deescalate
them and I don't use force and then I

00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.440
take them to whatever facility
throughout that city, the sad reality is

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:05.280
a hundred percent of how that person is
treated is dependent on who that person

00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.720
is and what insurance they have. If
they're indigent and they don't have any

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:12.570
insurance and they have no capacity to
pay that bill at all they're gonna be

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:16.320
"stabilized" very very quickly and they're
gonna get released and then they're

00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:19.230
usually gonna go back to the same
situation. Now you're gonna have that

00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:22.440
same officer dealing with them again two
days later. We don't have enough

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:26.480
resources in Bexar County for the amount
of problem that's out there not even close.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.450
James: These people are gonna come out at some
point and the reality is that they don't

00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:36.240
have good paying jobs. They don't
have insurance. How are they going to afford

00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:39.510
medications? Follow-up services? You're
dealing with somebody who doesn't have

00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:42.660
transportation. Doesn't have a good
paying job or a job at all. These are the

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:47.460
expectations that we have to think about
outside of the mental health facility.

00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:53.640
Martha: He has to sign a release in order for me to get
any kind of information. 

00:55:54.500 --> 00:55:59.900
He never signs anything. He never wants anyone to know what meds he's taking or where he has to

00:55:59.900 --> 00:56:01.480
go or what appointments.

00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:07.380
Chris:  They want me to
be mentally incompetent. That's the whole thing.

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:10.950
They want me to be mentally incompetent in order from my mom to have

00:56:10.950 --> 00:56:15.100
co-sign of everything. To get what they
want.

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:22.600
Chris: Yes, Grandma.

00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:38.740
Bertha: I feel very sad to see him in this

00:56:38.740 --> 00:56:46.620
condition. Very sad. I pray for him on a daily basis.

00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:50.620
And I pray that he gets well. 

00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:58.880
Alma: Sometimes I just
wish, I wish it's just a nightmare. I just wish I

00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:05.200
could just wake up and he could be back
to the way he was. Even without me I wouldn't

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:15.250
care as long as I know he was better. I'd be happy. So all we can do is just watch him waste away.

00:57:15.250 --> 00:57:20.410
Martha: I know a lot of people say well he's 35, let him
go, let him figure it out himself but put

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:23.260
yourself in my shoes if it was your
child what would you do?

00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:28.390
I mean I know a lot of people say
tough love but this is a disease this is

00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:33.430
not you know because they're being
resentful. They're not cognizant of what

00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:37.600
they're doing so you can't say tough
love.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:54.040

00:57:54.040 --> 00:58:02.040
District Attorney: Today the 176 grand jury of Harris County indicted former deputy Cameron Brewer for the

00:58:02.050 --> 00:58:07.360
fatal shooting of Danny Thomas an
unarmed civilian. Brewer now faces

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:14.860
five to ninety-nine years or up to life in prison
as a result of this charge. 

00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:20.160
Any time a life is lost it's important to us at the
Harris County District Attorney's Office

00:58:20.170 --> 00:58:24.910
but when it happens at the hand of a
government official in a free country it

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:31.900
creates even greater concern and emotion
among family members and the rest of the community.

00:58:34.020 --> 00:58:38.380
He was fired from the Harris
County Sheriff's Office for failing to

00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:44.080
apply the training that he had been
provided using less than deadly force

00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:49.110
against somebody who was clearly unarmed.

00:58:49.110 --> 00:58:54.120
When the government takes a life it
matters how we respond. We responded by

00:58:54.120 --> 00:58:58.300
presenting all the evidence to a grand
jury and they responded with a true bill.

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:03.340
And we're going to prosecute. Thank you all.

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.660
Marketta: I can't even stand like standing

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:08.340
here right now.

00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:26.940
[Music]

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:31.320
Marketta: We just pray to God the cop that shot

00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:35.720
uncle Danny
that he's brought to justice, right?

00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:42.180
Marketta: Will Cameron go to hell?
What you think?

01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:10.770
Marketta: An eleven-year-old who who doesn't
understand death and why people kill

01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:24.780
other people but is so fast and
willing to forgive is mind-blowing cause

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:30.080
I'm not ready to forgive but my son is
so ready to forgive.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:43.860
Marketta: You got to go that way. Oh you got skills now. Go long Sean!

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:51.480
Maybe this is my calling. Maybe this is God's bittersweet way of telling me like hey this is what I think

01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:52.340
you should be doing. 

01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.440
Go!

01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:00.040
Being a voice for somebody else that feels like their voice isn't strong enough.

01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:02.420
Chris: I think the public
misunderstands mental illness

01:01:02.420 --> 01:01:07.920
as disease you could contact and touch
and it'll just go at you. No.

01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:12.020
You have to get to know 'em. If you don't feel the emotions that they went through

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.620
then you shouldn't be judging another person. You don't lower each other.

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:19.240
I love you. I love you. This is my grandma. This is my grandma.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.600
This is my real grandma. 

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.840
Jon: We got to get away from that stigma. Having a 

01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:27.059
mental illness does not mean that we
can't function in society. It does not

01:01:27.059 --> 01:01:30.809
mean that we're crazy. People with mental
illness are more likely to be victims of

01:01:30.809 --> 01:01:34.060
crime than to actually be the ones to
commit it. 

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.320
James: Is the system perfect? By all means no it's not.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.240
Tre: Hey buddy.

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.720
[toddler sounds]

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:40.680
Tre: What's that, a toy?

01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:41.720
[toddler sounds]

01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:44.640
James: The only thing I can do is go out there every day and do the best job that I can

01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:47.520
and remember I serve a public, I serve people.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:51.360
Child: Mat...Sat...Sam...Sat...

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:53.820
James: Alright. Good job. You're getting it.

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.220
Never get to a point
where you become cynical because it's easy to do that.

01:01:57.220 --> 01:01:58.020
Marketta: Hi Momma. 

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.940
[Laughing]

01:02:01.020 --> 01:02:02.220
Sean: I love you.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:03.860
Marketta: I love you too big guy.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.480
Mila: We all love you.

01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:09.260
Joe: We were never meant to do this, but we are. We have been for years

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.860
 and we're going to be probably
forever. 

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.080
Stop complaining about it, wake up and let's just give us the tools and resources that we need.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.120
Tre: Say stop police!

01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:18.040
[toddler sounds]

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:18.780
Tre: Police.

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:21.420
Stop resisting.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.660
Love you.

01:02:23.660 --> 01:02:27.420
Joe:  The bar that we have in police
work is just stay alive. That's the most

01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:32.280
important thing go home at the end of the
day. Yeah, but that's also a pretty low bar.

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.340
We need to raise the bar of what our
expectations are.

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.480
Marketta: Love you guys.

01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:38.000
Sean &amp; Mila: Love you too.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:43.320
Marketta: I feel good, like actually, like, stating my piece,
kinda, you know?

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:47.680
Marketta: Kind of like get that sense of like relief. 

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:53.740
It's been a good day.
