 Translator: Iris Xholi Reviewer: Helena Bedalli 

00:00:12.146 --> 00:00:13.824
 I will never forget that day 

00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:17.723
 of the spring of 2006. 

00:00:17.723 --> 00:00:19.302
 I was a resident surgeon 

00:00:19.302 --> 00:00:21.733
 at Johns Hopkins Hospital 

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:23.510
 in accepting emergency calls. 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.873
 Around 2 a.m. I was notified by ER 

00:00:26.873 --> 00:00:28.900
 to go see a woman with diabetic ulcer 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.694
 at her feet. 

00:00:30.694 --> 00:00:34.395
 I still remember that kind of rotten blood smell, 

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:38.022
 as I was pulling the curtain to see it. 

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:40.367
 Everyone there thought that woman was very ill 

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:41.719
 and needed to be hospitalized. 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.319
 This was not discussed. 

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:45.461
 The question I posed was another, 

00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:49.390
 did she need amputation? 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.357
 Now, turning our heads back to that night 

00:00:52.357 --> 00:00:57.522
 I would desperately want to believe that I treated that woman, 

00:00:57.522 --> 00:01:00.658
 that night, with the same empathy and compassion 

00:01:00.658 --> 00:01:04.893
 which I showed to the 27-year-old newlywed 

00:01:04.893 --> 00:01:06.838
 which came to ER three days ago 

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:08.452
 with low back pain 

00:01:08.452 --> 00:01:12.701
 which turned out to be advanced pancreatic cancer. 

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:14.864
 In her case, I knew there was nothing I could do 

00:01:14.864 --> 00:01:16.632
 that would save his life. 

00:01:16.632 --> 00:01:18.681
 The cancer was very advanced. 

00:01:18.681 --> 00:01:21.361
 But I was committed to making sure that 

00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:23.784
 I would do everything possible to make her feel 

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:26.207
 more comfortable. I brought him a warm blanket 

00:01:26.207 --> 00:01:28.927
 and a cup of coffee. 

00:01:28.927 --> 00:01:31.112
 I also brought it to her parents. 

00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:34.258
 But look, the most important thing is that I didn’t prejudice him, 

00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:36.155
 because it was clear that she had done nothing 

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:38.329
 that could cause this to itself. 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:41.142
 Then, how is it possible that a few nights later, 

00:01:41.142 --> 00:01:44.300
 to stay in the same emergency room and set 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.711
 that my diabetic patient needed amputation, 

00:01:47.711 --> 00:01:51.615
 why did I say that in such a bitter way? 

00:01:51.615 --> 00:01:54.080
 The difference is that in contrast to the woman the night before, 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.479
 this woman suffered from type 2 diabetes. 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.031
 She was healthy. 

00:01:58.031 --> 00:01:59.944
 And we all know that this comes as a result of eating too much 

00:01:59.944 --> 00:02:02.299
 and lack of physical activity, right? 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.983
 I mean, how hard can it be? 

00:02:04.983 --> 00:02:07.344
 As I watched him lie down I thought to myself, 

00:02:07.344 --> 00:02:10.232
 as if you cared very little, 

00:02:10.232 --> 00:02:13.222
 you would not be in this state now 

00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:14.999
 with a doctor you had never seen before 

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:18.814
 preparing to cut your leg. 

00:02:18.814 --> 00:02:22.456
 Why did I feel justified in judging her? 

00:02:22.456 --> 00:02:25.025
 I would like to say that I do not know. 

00:02:25.025 --> 00:02:27.061
 But this is not true. 

00:02:27.061 --> 00:02:29.392
 With the pride of my youth, 

00:02:29.392 --> 00:02:32.496
 I thought I had psychologized it. 

00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:34.326
 She has eaten a lot. She has been unlucky. 

00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:37.695
 He contracted diabetes. That's the job. 

00:02:37.695 --> 00:02:39.098
 Strangely, at that time, 

00:02:39.098 --> 00:02:41.496
 I was researching cancer, 

00:02:41.496 --> 00:02:43.839
 immune system therapies for skin cancer, to be more precise, 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:47.812
 from which I had learned that I should have doubts about everything, 

00:02:47.812 --> 00:02:49.848
 not to take anything for granted 

00:02:49.848 --> 00:02:53.658
 and to measure with the highest scientific standards. 

00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:57.034
 Meanwhile, when it comes to diabetes 

00:02:57.034 --> 00:03:00.583
 which kills 8 times more Americans than melanoma, 

00:03:00.583 --> 00:03:04.011
 I never put the knowledge to the test until then. 

00:03:04.011 --> 00:03:07.057
 I accepted the welcome, 

00:03:07.057 --> 00:03:09.642
 every link in the chain of pathological causes that led to it. 

00:03:09.642 --> 00:03:13.042
 Three years later, I discovered that I was very wrong. 

00:03:13.042 --> 00:03:15.642
 But this time, I was the patient. 

00:03:15.642 --> 00:03:19.473
 Although I exercised 3-4 hours a day, 

00:03:19.473 --> 00:03:22.038
 and the implementation of precision food pyramids, 

00:03:22.038 --> 00:03:24.195
 I had gained a lot of weight and developed 

00:03:24.195 --> 00:03:26.480
 something called metabolic syndrome. 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.464
 Some of you may have heard of it. 

00:03:28.464 --> 00:03:31.909
 I was immune to insulin. 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.358
 You can think of insulin as this all-powerful hormone 

00:03:34.358 --> 00:03:38.421
 that controls what our body does with the foods we eat, 

00:03:38.421 --> 00:03:40.535
 if we store or burn them. 

00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:43.349
 In medical parlance this is called "energy sharing". 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.525
 Insufficient insulin production is not compatible with life. 

00:03:46.525 --> 00:03:49.181
 And insulin resistance, as the name suggests, 

00:03:49.181 --> 00:03:51.861
 occurs when cells become more and more resistant 

00:03:51.861 --> 00:03:55.374
 from the effects of insulin trying to do its job. 

00:03:55.374 --> 00:03:57.550
 When you become insulin resistant, 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.925
 you become diabetic, 

00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:00.989
 what happens when the pancreas 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.312
 cannot withstand resistance and produce enough insulin. 

00:04:04.312 --> 00:04:06.940
 The increase in the amount of sugar in the blood begins, 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.572
 and a waterfall of pathological problems 

00:04:09.572 --> 00:04:13.273
 get out of control, which can lead to heart problems, 

00:04:13.273 --> 00:04:16.882
 cancer, or even Alzheimer's, 

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:21.764
 and amputation, just like that woman a few years ago. 

00:04:21.764 --> 00:04:24.725
 With this problem, I started to drastically change my diet, 

00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:26.902
 removing and adding things you would find 

00:04:26.902 --> 00:04:29.982
 obviously shocking. 

00:04:29.982 --> 00:04:33.861
 I did so and lost 20 kg, although I did less exercise. 

00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:36.902
 As you can see, I'm not overweight. 

00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:39.069
 What is more important is that I no longer have insulin resistance. 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:41.113
 But even more important are these three questions 

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:44.962
 which I have left and which do not want to be taken away from me: 

00:04:44.962 --> 00:04:47.411
 How did this happen to me when I was thinking 

00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:50.108
 that I was doing everything right? 

00:04:50.108 --> 00:04:53.143
 If the science of healthy eating has been false, 

00:04:53.143 --> 00:04:56.930
 was that the case for others? 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.830
 And in analyzing these questions 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.076
 it became almost fixed 

00:05:02.076 --> 00:05:04.803
 in trying to understand the real connection 

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:08.433
 between obesity and insulin resistance. 

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:11.249
 Now, many researchers believe that obesity 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.641
 is due to insulin resistance. 

00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.756
 Logically, when treating insulin resistance, 

00:05:16.756 --> 00:05:18.648
 it forces people to lose weight, doesn't it? 

00:05:18.648 --> 00:05:21.412
 Treats obesity. 

00:05:21.412 --> 00:05:24.118
 What if it's the exact opposite? 

00:05:24.118 --> 00:05:27.489
 What if obesity is not the cause of insulin resistance? 

00:05:27.489 --> 00:05:31.409
 In fact, if it were a synthesis of a much bigger problem, 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:34.231
 the tip of an iceberg? 

00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:36.874
 I know it sounds a little weird, because we're in the middle 

00:05:36.874 --> 00:05:40.093
 of an obesity epidemic, but listen to me a little. 

00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:43.307
 What if obesity is a camouflage 

00:05:43.307 --> 00:05:46.909
 of a much more serious problem that 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:48.391
 does it have roots in the cell? 

00:05:48.391 --> 00:05:50.757
 I am not suggesting here that obesity is benign, 

00:05:50.757 --> 00:05:53.060
 but what I am suggesting is that it may be the least evil 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.771
 of the two evils of metabolism. 

00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:58.790
 You can think of insulin resistance as a limited ability 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:00.777
 of itself to distribute fuel, 

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.068
 as I referred to a minute ago, 

00:06:03.068 --> 00:06:04.990
 to get the calories we provide with food 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.429
 and proportionally burn one part and store the other. 

00:06:08.429 --> 00:06:10.071
 When we become insulin resistant, 

00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:13.438
 homeostasis in this type of balancing is disrupted. 

00:06:13.438 --> 00:06:15.566
 So now, when insulin tells the cell, 

00:06:15.566 --> 00:06:17.611
 I want to burn more energy 

00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:20.046
 how safe the cell considers it, in fact it responds, 

00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:24.478
 "No thanks, I'll save that energy." 

00:06:24.478 --> 00:06:26.380
 And since it is not found in fat cells 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.182
 those complex cellular machines found in other cells, 

00:06:29.182 --> 00:06:31.953
 is the best place to store them. 

00:06:31.953 --> 00:06:36.922
 Many of us, about 75 million Americans, 

00:06:36.922 --> 00:06:40.537
 insulin resistance response 

00:06:40.537 --> 00:06:45.466
 it may be to preserve it in the form of fat and not the other way around, 

00:06:45.466 --> 00:06:50.810
 to have insulin resistance in response to fat. 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.985
 This is actually a small change, 

00:06:52.985 --> 00:06:56.352
 but with serious consequences. 

00:06:56.352 --> 00:06:58.850
 Consider the following analogy: 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.819
 Think about the wrinkles you experience on the skin 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.411
 when you accidentally hit your knee on the coffee table. 

00:07:05.411 --> 00:07:08.298
 Obviously the wound hurts a lot and 

00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:11.279
 you don't like the fact that it's blackened, but we all know it 

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:14.732
 that the wound itself is not the problem. 

00:07:14.732 --> 00:07:18.474
 In fact, it's the opposite, it's a healthy response to a trauma, 

00:07:18.474 --> 00:07:21.235
 it is the immune cells that run where the damage occurred 

00:07:21.235 --> 00:07:24.219
 to help the cells there and stop 

00:07:24.219 --> 00:07:26.917
 the spread of infection to other parts of the body. 

00:07:26.917 --> 00:07:30.639
 Now, imagine if we thought the wound was actually the problem, 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:33.507
 and conduct any research 

00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:36.647
 and medical culture about wound healing: 

00:07:36.647 --> 00:07:39.930
 camouflage cream, painkillers, and many more, 

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.156
 completely ignoring the fact that people 

00:07:42.156 --> 00:07:45.776
 are still crashing into the coffee tables. 

00:07:45.776 --> 00:07:48.979
 How much better would it be if we treated the causes-- 

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:50.544
 telling people to be more careful 

00:07:50.544 --> 00:07:52.147
 as they walk through the living room-- 

00:07:52.147 --> 00:07:55.420
 instead of the effect that is created? 

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.297
 Understand the cause and effect, 

00:07:57.297 --> 00:07:59.776
 makes all possible difference. 

00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:02.855
 Wrong, the pharmaceutical industry 

00:08:02.855 --> 00:08:05.535
 can continue to be profitable for its investors 

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:09.451
 but for people with murdered kerci nothing is improved. 

00:08:09.451 --> 00:08:12.295
 Cause and effect. 

00:08:12.295 --> 00:08:14.132
 What I am suggesting is 

00:08:14.132 --> 00:08:16.889
 that we probably have the wrong cause and effect 

00:08:16.889 --> 00:08:19.523
 when falsification for obesity and insulin resistance. 

00:08:19.523 --> 00:08:21.300
 Maybe we should ask ourselves, 

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:25.185
 is it possible that insulin resistance causes weight gain? 

00:08:25.185 --> 00:08:27.251
 and obesity-related diseases, 

00:08:27.251 --> 00:08:28.781
 at least in most people? 

00:08:28.781 --> 00:08:31.781
 What if being obese is just a metabolic response 

00:08:31.781 --> 00:08:34.002
 to something much more threatening, 

00:08:34.002 --> 00:08:36.213
 a hidden epidemic, 

00:08:36.213 --> 00:08:38.770
 what should we worry about the most? 

00:08:38.770 --> 00:08:40.242
 Let's take a look at the facts. 

00:08:40.242 --> 00:08:42.728
 We know that 30 million obese Americans 

00:08:42.728 --> 00:08:45.701
 in the USA do not suffer from insulin resistance. 

00:08:45.701 --> 00:08:47.638
 And by the way, they don't seem to be us 

00:08:47.638 --> 00:08:50.718
 any greater risk for disease than weak people. 

00:08:50.718 --> 00:08:53.602
 Meanwhile, we know that 6 million people are weak 

00:08:53.602 --> 00:08:57.039
 in the USA are insulin resistant, 

00:08:57.039 --> 00:09:00.106
 and by the way, they are thought to be at greater risk for 

00:09:00.106 --> 00:09:02.261
 those metabolic diseases I mentioned above, 

00:09:02.261 --> 00:09:04.083
 in contrast to the group of obese. 

00:09:04.083 --> 00:09:06.320
 I don't know why, but maybe it comes as a result of that fact 

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.010
 in their case, the cells have not yet understood it 

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.295
 what to do with excess energy. 

00:09:12.295 --> 00:09:15.614
 So if a person may be obese and may not have insulin resistance, 

00:09:15.614 --> 00:09:17.485
 or he may be weak and have it, 

00:09:17.485 --> 00:09:21.918
 this indicates that obesity may be a camouflage 

00:09:21.918 --> 00:09:24.942
 for what is happening. 

00:09:24.942 --> 00:09:27.357
 So, if we were fighting a wrong war, 

00:09:27.357 --> 00:09:31.157
 to fight obesity instead of insulin resistance? 

00:09:31.157 --> 00:09:34.400
 Even worse, like blaming obese people 

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.125
 does that mean we are blaming the victims? 

00:09:37.125 --> 00:09:40.844
 What if some of our core ideas about obesity 

00:09:40.844 --> 00:09:42.702
 are they wrong 

00:09:42.702 --> 00:09:46.825
 Personally, I can't have it with the luxury of arrogance 

00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:49.408
 let’s not talk then about the luxury of complete security. 

00:09:49.408 --> 00:09:52.254
 I have my own ideas of what the problem might be, 

00:09:52.254 --> 00:09:54.166
 but I am open to suggestions. 

00:09:54.166 --> 00:09:56.885
 My hypothesis, because everyone asks me, 

00:09:56.885 --> 00:09:58.502
 this is. 

00:09:58.502 --> 00:10:01.631
 If you ask yourself, from what it tries to protect the cell 

00:10:01.631 --> 00:10:03.358
 when it becomes resistant to insulin, 

00:10:03.358 --> 00:10:06.033
 the answer is probably no, overeating. 

00:10:06.033 --> 00:10:09.683
 But most likely, excess glucose: blood sugar. 

00:10:09.683 --> 00:10:11.977
 We know that processed cereals 

00:10:11.977 --> 00:10:14.033
 raise blood sugar levels in the short term, 

00:10:14.033 --> 00:10:15.941
 and there is reason to believe that sugar 

00:10:15.941 --> 00:10:18.742
 can lead directly to insulin resistance. 

00:10:18.742 --> 00:10:22.837
 If these psychological processes are put to work, 

00:10:22.837 --> 00:10:26.310
 hypothesizes that it may be the cause of the acquisition 

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.173
 processed cereals, bulk sugar, what it brings 

00:10:29.173 --> 00:10:33.824
 obesity and diabetes epidemic, 

00:10:33.824 --> 00:10:35.662
 but through insulin resistance, 

00:10:35.662 --> 00:10:39.574
 and not as an effect of overeating or not exercising. 

00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:42.159
 When I lost 20 kg a few years ago, 

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:44.759
 I did it simply by limiting these things, 

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:48.215
 which suggests that I have a side 

00:10:48.215 --> 00:10:50.576
 based on my personal experience. 

00:10:50.576 --> 00:10:53.231
 But that doesn't mean my side is wrong. 

00:10:53.231 --> 00:10:57.184
 and most importantly, all of this can be scientifically proven. 

00:10:57.184 --> 00:11:00.291
 But the first step is to accept the possibility 

00:11:00.291 --> 00:11:02.663
 that our belief about obesity, 

00:11:02.663 --> 00:11:05.669
 diabetes and insulin resistance may be wrong 

00:11:05.669 --> 00:11:08.544
 and as a result should be tested. 

00:11:08.544 --> 00:11:10.935
 I bet my career on this. 

00:11:10.935 --> 00:11:15.060
 Today, I dedicate all my working time to this problem, 

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.233
 and I will go wherever science takes me. 

00:11:18.233 --> 00:11:21.764
 I have decided that what I can't and will not do again 

00:11:21.764 --> 00:11:24.808
 is to claim that I have the answers when I don't have them. 

00:11:24.808 --> 00:11:28.916
 I was humble about everything I don’t know 

00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:31.073
 Last year, I was lucky enough 

00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:34.486
 that I worked on this problem with a wonderful group 

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:37.890
 researchers on obesity and diabetes in the country, 

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.195
 and the most beautiful part is that, 

00:11:39.195 --> 00:11:43.094
 as Abraham Lincoln surrounded himself with a group of rivals, 

00:11:43.094 --> 00:11:44.590
 and we have done the same. 

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.853
 We have recruited a working group with rival scientists, 

00:11:47.853 --> 00:11:51.298
 the best and the brightest but they all have their own hypotheses 

00:11:51.298 --> 00:11:52.912
 about what may be at the heart of the epidemic. 

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:55.293
 Some think it is the large amount of calories consumed. 

00:11:55.293 --> 00:11:57.672
 Others think it's a big consumption of a high-fat diet. 

00:11:57.672 --> 00:12:01.142
 For others, the problem lies in consuming cereals and starch. 

00:12:01.142 --> 00:12:03.750
 But this working group of multi-disciplinary researchers, 

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.734
 quite educated and quite talented, 

00:12:06.734 --> 00:12:09.022
 agree on two things. 

00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:12.671
 First, this problem is very important 

00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:15.414
 to continue to ignore it simply because we think we know the answers. 

00:12:15.414 --> 00:12:18.198
 And second, if we admit we are wrong, 

00:12:18.198 --> 00:12:20.735
 if we accept to challenge the knowledge so far 

00:12:20.735 --> 00:12:23.798
 with the best experiments offered by science, 

00:12:23.798 --> 00:12:26.103
 the problem can be solved. 

00:12:26.103 --> 00:12:29.158
 I know it's pretty tempting for loved ones to learn the answer right now, 

00:12:29.158 --> 00:12:33.655
 policies and measures, dietary recommendations-- 

00:12:33.655 --> 00:12:35.384
 eat this, not that-- 

00:12:35.384 --> 00:12:37.064
 but if we want to identify it exactly, 

00:12:37.064 --> 00:12:39.298
 we have to do a pretty rigorous science 

00:12:39.298 --> 00:12:42.151
 before we start giving recommendations. 

00:12:42.151 --> 00:12:44.750
 Briefly, to address this, our research program 

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.993
 is focused on about three main topics or questions. 

00:12:47.993 --> 00:12:50.888
 First, how do the different foods we eat affect us? 

00:12:50.888 --> 00:12:53.689
 in metabolism, hormones and enzymes, 

00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:56.507
 and through what molecular mechanism? 

00:12:56.507 --> 00:12:58.757
 Second, based on these data, 

00:12:58.757 --> 00:13:01.716
 can people make the necessary changes to their diet? 

00:13:01.716 --> 00:13:05.447
 in a way that is safe and practical to implement? 

00:13:05.447 --> 00:13:08.456
 And finally, when we identify it 

00:13:08.456 --> 00:13:11.484
 what are the safe and practical changes that people can make to their diet, 

00:13:11.484 --> 00:13:15.159
 how can we direct their behavior in that direction 

00:13:15.159 --> 00:13:17.412
 to become everyday 

00:13:17.412 --> 00:13:19.268
 and not the exception? 

00:13:19.268 --> 00:13:21.688
 Knowing what to do doesn't mean 

00:13:21.688 --> 00:13:23.197
 that you will always do it. 

00:13:23.197 --> 00:13:25.325
 Sometimes it is necessary to put data around people 

00:13:25.325 --> 00:13:27.628
 to make it easier, and believe it or not, 

00:13:27.628 --> 00:13:31.269
 this can be studied scientifically. 

00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:33.853
 I don't know how this trip will end, 

00:13:33.853 --> 00:13:38.066
 but that seems clear to me at least: 

00:13:38.066 --> 00:13:43.062
 We cannot continue to blame overweight and diabetic patients 

00:13:43.062 --> 00:13:45.974
 as I did. 

00:13:45.974 --> 00:13:48.253
 Most of them actually want to do the right gene, 

00:13:48.253 --> 00:13:51.622
 but they need to know what that is, 

00:13:51.622 --> 00:13:54.668
 and should work. 

00:13:54.668 --> 00:13:59.364
 I dream of the day when our patients 

00:13:59.364 --> 00:14:01.099
 will be able to weaken 

00:14:01.099 --> 00:14:03.912
 and cure themselves from insulin resistance, 

00:14:03.912 --> 00:14:06.642
 as a medical professional, 

00:14:06.642 --> 00:14:08.612
 we have sweated our mental baggage 

00:14:08.612 --> 00:14:11.938
 and we have healed ourselves from resisting ideas enough 

00:14:11.938 --> 00:14:15.028
 to return to our ideals of origin: 

00:14:15.028 --> 00:14:19.445
 open mind, with the courage to throw away yesterday's ideas 

00:14:19.445 --> 00:14:22.773
 when they do not yield results, 

00:14:22.773 --> 00:14:25.892
 and understanding that scientific truth is not the last word, 

00:14:25.892 --> 00:14:28.640
 but in constant evolution. 

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.932
 Staying true to that path will be better for our patients 

00:14:31.932 --> 00:14:35.180
 and better for science, 

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.174
 If obesity is nothing but camouflage 

00:14:38.174 --> 00:14:40.100
 of metabolic diseases, 

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:45.397
 What good is it for us to punish those who suffer from it? 

00:14:45.397 --> 00:14:49.941
 It happens to me to think about the night in the emergency room 

00:14:49.941 --> 00:14:52.254
 7 years ago. 

00:14:52.254 --> 00:14:55.878
 I wish I could talk to that woman again. 

00:14:55.878 --> 00:14:59.133
 I would like to tell you how bad it was for me. 

00:14:59.133 --> 00:15:02.020
 I would tell her that as a doctor, I gave it to her 

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.680
 the best clinical service I could, 

00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.577
 but as human beings, 

00:15:09.577 --> 00:15:11.985
 I didn’t handle it properly. 

00:15:11.985 --> 00:15:16.230
 You didn't need my judgment. 

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:20.728
 You needed my sympathy and regret, 

00:15:20.728 --> 00:15:22.723
 and most of all you needed a doctor 

00:15:22.723 --> 00:15:25.352
 who would be willing to consider 

00:15:25.352 --> 00:15:28.416
 the fact that you could be outside the framework of the system. 

00:15:28.416 --> 00:15:31.634
 Maybe the system, of which I was a part, 

00:15:31.634 --> 00:15:34.073
 did not help you. 

00:15:34.073 --> 00:15:36.874
 If you are watching this now, 

00:15:36.874 --> 00:15:41.112
 I hope you can forgive me. 

00:15:41.112 --> 00:15:45.112
 (Applause)
