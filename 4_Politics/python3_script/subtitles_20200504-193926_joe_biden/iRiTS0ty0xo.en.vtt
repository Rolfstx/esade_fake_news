00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.880
Over the last couple of months,
our first guest's leadership

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.590
has not only helped
the state of New York,

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.525
but also the whole nation cope
with these uncertain times.

00:00:09.525 --> 00:00:11.775
Please welcome the governor
of New York, Andrew Cuomo.

00:00:11.775 --> 00:00:12.960
[CLAPPING]

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:14.980
Good to be with you.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.230
Thank you, Ellen.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.160
Thank you so much.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.720
Thanks for your leadership.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.920
Thanks for taking the time.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.050
You're a very busy man.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.210
And everybody loves
you right now.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.210
I think you can feel
the love from us.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.120
But you've always been
honest and upfront

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.759
about the information,
and we've needed that.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.950
You must feel how necessary what
you're doing is for all of us

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.810
right now.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.740
Well, thank you.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.850
This situation became so
bizarre so quickly, Ellen.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.140
What we were asking people
to do was extraordinary--

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.370
lock yourself in your
house, close your business,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.340
don't go out-- just
think about it.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.880
So government really
doesn't have the ability

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:03.990
to enforce that.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.610
The only way to get
it done was really

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.000
to give people the facts,
explain the situation,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.060
and then they had
to agree to do it.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.610
It was almost a
voluntary compliance.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.410
And New Yorkers can be a
difficult, cynical bunch.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.420
And I knew we were asking them
to do extraordinary things.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.150
So I just laid out the facts.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.360
And I said, here are the facts,
this is what you need to know,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.540
I recommend this,
and this is why.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.050
But I needed them to
buy in, especially given

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.420
the degree of
difficulty that we were

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.540
going to have to actually
implement these things.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.610
And you know, people are smart.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.160
If you give them the facts,
and they trust the facts,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.410
and they trust the person
who's giving them the facts,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.610
they will do the right thing.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.250
And I think that's what
the people in New York did.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.890
And I think that's what you've
seen across the country.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.540
Yeah, absolutely.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.570
But especially New York because
it was a hotspot early on.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.070
And now the state is
doing well, right?

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.610
Right now, the numbers
are on the way down.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.110
We still have a higher number of
cases than just about anywhere

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.190
else.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.440
And also, interestingly,
they're now

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.760
discovering that we were
all looking at China--

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.690
by the time we acted
on China, the virus

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.730
had been out of China,
had gone to Europe,

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.280
and the virus that
actually came to New York

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.000
came from Europe, not
China, and much earlier

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.540
than we even thought.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.370
Yeah.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.850
I'm hearing that
possibly in California it

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.610
was here in October.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.610
Well, we were hearing about it--

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.160
there's so many lessons
to learn when we go back

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.960
and do the
retrospective on this--

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.410
but we were hearing about it
in November, December in China,

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.730
right?

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.550
Global pandemic, yeah--
the virus gets on a plane,

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.920
and it goes to Europe,
and it goes to New York,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.080
and it goes to California.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.610
So there is there's no time to
delay in a situation like this.

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.790
And I think we all have
a lot to learn from this

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.040
because by the time we actually
acted and enacted travel bans,

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.740
we were closing the
door on the barn

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.330
and the horse was already gone.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.270
I think that's clear.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.430
Yeah.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.250
It's so devastating
because I think

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.670
nobody really thought about
a pandemic except maybe

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.420
Bill Gates.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.630
But there are a lot of
people who didn't know

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.530
that this was a possibility.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.940
And then it's a whole
new level because we

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.090
haven't had this for 100 years.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.160
But we have the
economy that's affected

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.870
in a different way that--

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.090
we didn't realize
the effect that it's

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.380
going to have on everything.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.860
And it's hard to wrap
our heads around how

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.970
we're all going to get back
to some sense of normalcy.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.780
Well, you're right.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.147
Global pandemic-- if you
look at the textbooks,

00:03:56.147 --> 00:03:57.980
they've been talking
about a global pandemic

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.075
for a long time.

00:03:59.075 --> 00:04:01.700
But they've been talking about
a lot of things for a long time.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.590
And you're right,
we never had it

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.130
so it was never
actualized for us.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.880
We didn't really fully
experience what it was like.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.600
Then it happens, no
one's been here before,

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.680
it's a scramble for
everyone on every level.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.190
This action that we're
taking is unprecedented.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:26.450
And we don't even know what the
future is, which is probably

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.230
the first time in my
lifetime that we've

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:31.550
been in this situation.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.070
And no one can tell
you what's going

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.290
to happen one month, two months,
three months down the road.

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.200
So it's all uncharted territory.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.650
You have to keep moving
forward, take the next step,

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.860
be the most educated as
you can in the next step.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.970
But it's a very difficult
time when people are basically

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.390
out of control, nobody
can give them answers,

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.490
nobody knows the future.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:59.690
And then, the only hard point
you have is, well, at one point

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.250
we'll have a vaccine.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.963
And then you can really be
safe when we have the vaccine.

00:05:03.963 --> 00:05:05.630
But we don't know if
we're going to have

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.770
a vaccine for 12 months,
or 14 months, or 18 months.

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.710
But then we also have
a vaccine for the flu,

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.690
and people get
vaccinated for the flu,

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:17.366
and they get the flu anyway.

00:05:17.366 --> 00:05:21.800
Yeah, or they get a
mutation of the flu anyway.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:26.140
But at one point, we'll have
a vaccine for this virus.

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.950
The virus may mutate, come
back in a mutated form,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.430
and you'd need a
vaccine for that.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.800
But you'd be starting
with the first vaccine.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.600
So there's no doubt
that the vaccine is

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.570
going to be very helpful, and
I think give people comfort.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:42.970
What I'm wondering is
when people actually

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.530
have comfort again.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.140
Because we can say--

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.140
just the way we needed
buy-in to close down,

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:53.310
you're going to need
buy-in to open up.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.890
I can stand up and say,
don't worry, it's safe,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.670
everybody get back on the subway
and get back on the buses.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.140
It's not going to be that easy.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.020
They started to reopen
China and people were

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.870
very slow to come back, right?

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.110
They now get the
severity of this issue

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.460
and they're going to have to
believe that the danger is

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.660
abated before they
resume life as usual,

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:21.700
especially in a
city like New York

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.670
where it is all
about the density.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.750
We had the cases coming
from Europe and nobody knew.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.110
But this spread, it's like
fire through dry grass

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.660
because you can't
socially distance

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.250
in New York City, right?

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.280
You can't walk down a sidewalk
and be socially distant.

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.490
You can't ride a subway
and be socially distant.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.280
Los Angeles, California,
it's a different geography,

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.630
different density.

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.550
So people are going
to really have

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.610
to feel comfortable before
they go back to normal, that's

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.090
for sure-- if there
ever is a back to normal

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.640
or a new normal as
we talk about it.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.970
Yeah, I think that's the thing.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:04.000
It will be a new normal
because I can't imagine

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.610
what it's going to be like to--

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:09.230
even when we have
the vaccine, I think

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.270
we've all become so scared of
all the different symptoms.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.620
They keep surprising us.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.860
There's all these new
things that you hear about

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:21.010
that we didn't know that were
the headaches, or the fever,

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.680
or the asymptomatic,
or the blood clots.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.020
It just keeps surprising us
in different ways, right?

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.890
Oh no, I think that's for sure.

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:35.290
And look, you'll have in the
back of your mind always, well,

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.180
what's the next one going to be?

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.050
What's the next
public health risk?

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.840
Is this coronavirus coming back?

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.720
Is it another virus coming back?

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.000
There's going to
be a form of PTSD,

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.280
I think, for a
generation, right?

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.030
It was after 9/11
happened in New York.

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:56.770
Everybody was affected by 9/11.

00:07:56.770 --> 00:08:01.390
You heard a bang in New York
for five years afterwards

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.280
and everybody jumped, you know?

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:07.240
It just introduces into your
psyche a whole new fear.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.840
Yeah.

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.720
Right.

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:11.260
OK, we have to take
a break and then

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.990
we're going to talk some
more with Governor Cuomo.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.850
Take a break here.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.850
That's what I just said.

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:16.390
OK.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:17.840
And we're back.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.450
Andy?

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:20.080
I just wanted to say one thing.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.990
A lot of Ellen's
staff-- myself included,

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:26.380
some of the producers,
Lauren, and Johnny, and Mary--

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.180
we're all native New Yorkers.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.980
And I can tell you
that across the board--

00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.549
my mother is 82, sitting in
her apartment in Manhattan--

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:35.650
and across the
board, what we keep

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.549
hearing is what a great job
you're doing bringing comfort

00:08:39.549 --> 00:08:40.720
to these people.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.900
And it is so
important, at a time

00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:48.130
where there's a lack of some
honest information coming out,

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:49.540
to have someone like you.

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.250
And I think it's
why you've resonated

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.100
across the whole country,
because people can tell honesty

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.803
and we appreciate that.

00:08:55.803 --> 00:08:56.470
Well, thank you.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:57.280
Absolutely.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.680
I was just going to
say, Andy is my producer

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:01.450
and he's only
allowed in the garden

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:03.220
because we're
socially distancing.

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.500
So he can only
talk from the yard.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.800
That's why he's out there.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.300
Yeah.

00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:08.980
No, I noticed him out there.

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.020
[CHUCKLES] I was going
to say something but

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:13.210
I thought better of it.

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.660
But thank you for
your nice words.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.910
Look-- and as I said
in the beginning--

00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.760
we needed people to buy in, so
I wanted them to have the facts

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.070
and I wanted to have
the information.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:27.940
And I also wanted to
communicate that this is not

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:29.140
a governmental issue.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.850
It is a social issue.

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:32.980
It's a personal issue.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.660
People are afraid.

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.790
People are anxious.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.920
They've never been here before.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.320
They have all sorts of pressure
that they've never had before.

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.590
You know, we have domestic
violence going up.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:47.780
We have mental health
issues going up.

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.310
This is an extraordinarily
stressful time,

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:53.420
and it is for everyone.

00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:59.290
So I wanted people to know that,
look, I feel it also, you know?

00:09:59.290 --> 00:10:01.210
I'm going through it in my life.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:02.620
I'm worried about my family.

00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:05.050
I'm worried about my mother.

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:08.650
And then you're in this hellish
situation where you can't even

00:10:08.650 --> 00:10:13.870
go see the people who you love,
who you want to reach out to.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:17.620
I can't even go see my mother.

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.660
She gets offended when I say
it, but she's a senior person.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.530
I'm out there,
I'm moving around,

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:26.080
who knows what I'm exposed to?

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.330
I can't even go see her.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.250
You're afraid to
hug someone, you're

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:33.730
afraid to kiss
someone at this time

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.580
when you need comfort
probably more than you've ever

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:37.950
needed it.

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:43.390
It is like a hell where you are
isolated not just in your home,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:49.480
you're isolated personally at a
time when you need association

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.360
and you need relationships
probably more than ever.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.990
So it works on so
many levels and it's

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.570
so upsetting and disturbing.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:02.080
And again, nobody can tell
you when it ends, how it ends.

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.720
Look, I think we've never been
through anything like this.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.960
I think, Ellen, we're actually
better on the other side,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.460
right?

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.960
You talk about the World
War II generation, people

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.550
who have gone through
real crises in their life

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:19.670
and you learn from it.

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.600
Maybe it hardens you and
you come back better.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:30.820
But it's going to be life
changing, hard, disruptive,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:33.020
and we will never be the same.

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:35.465
I just hope we're better for it.

00:11:35.465 --> 00:11:37.840
Well, I can tell you one
thing-- we have to take a break,

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.820
but I can tell you
one thing-- just,

00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:42.730
you are a calming voice in this.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:47.450
Like Andy said, even though
it's all disturbing news

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:54.130
and it's all sad, we watch
you and feel better listening

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:56.950
to you because we know
that it's the real truth.

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:01.112
And we're getting comforted,
no matter how bad the news is,

00:12:01.112 --> 00:12:02.320
because it's coming from you.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.320
We have to take a break.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.870
More with Governor
Cuomo after this.
