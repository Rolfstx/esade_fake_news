00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.153
- Here we go.

00:00:01.153 --> 00:00:05.210
(plane engine noise drowns out speech)

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.960
(dramatic music)

00:00:10.386 --> 00:00:14.372
- Best VIP aeroplanes  that
I've seen in my career.

00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:15.205
- Wow.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.814
This aeroplane was built in 1979.

00:00:20.814 --> 00:00:22.263
(engines roaring)

00:00:22.263 --> 00:00:23.745
I guess that's the king's bathroom.

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.806
Here there's another
small, private office here.

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:27.266
There's a shower room.

00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:28.821
A big conference room here.

00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:30.376
Bodyguards probably like, sitting here.

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:31.706
The king's bedroom, basically.

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:33.433
(content sounds)

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.068
- Main equipment centre.

00:00:35.068 --> 00:00:37.963
(dramatic music)

00:00:37.963 --> 00:00:40.424
- Now the aeroplane will go
in the hangar to do a C check.

00:00:40.424 --> 00:00:43.334
- [Automated Voiceover] Traffic, traffic.

00:00:43.334 --> 00:00:48.311
- I never thought in 2019, I
could fly again on the 747SP.

00:00:48.311 --> 00:00:51.997
This is probably the greatest
flight I have this year.

00:00:51.997 --> 00:00:55.787
(plane engines roar)

00:00:55.787 --> 00:00:57.836
Welcome to Hamilton, Canada.

00:00:57.836 --> 00:01:01.471
Today, no kidding, I'm
gonna fly on a Boeing 747SP,

00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:03.647
a VIP special aeroplane today.

00:01:03.647 --> 00:01:06.397
(dramatic music)

00:01:42.486 --> 00:01:44.710
- Probably one of the best VIP aeroplanes 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.840
that I've seen in my career.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.200
- A year ago, this plane
came to our airport

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.029
and it hasn't moved since.

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:54.269
I'm so happy to see it leaving today.

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:57.019
(dramatic music)

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.640
- I was in Mauritius on my way to Paris,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.627
then I got a call from the
owner of this company saying

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:07.865
"Sam, you have to come,
there's a 747SP flight ready,

00:02:07.865 --> 00:02:10.672
today," so I just booked a flight Paris,

00:02:10.672 --> 00:02:13.300
to Munich, to Toronto on Lufthansa, then

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.510
I'm here today, this morning.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.850
I'd do anything to catch
a 747SP in 2018 and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.243
this is a VIP one,
let's check it out guys.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.174
Wow, this is amazing.

00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:28.924
(dramatic music)

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.380
- So, this aircraft, er, had to be er,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.870
reactivated, it was in uh,
storage for quite a number

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.087
of months, weeks and um,
basically they had to go through

00:03:07.087 --> 00:03:11.480
and un-pickle the motors, uh
basically run up the motors.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.160
They had to check all the
systems in the aircraft, um

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.370
from all the altimeters, the
pitot-static system, down to

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.740
the radios, um, actually all
the radios were removed from

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.800
the aircraft and put in storage.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.340
Um, and then of course
everything else went back in

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.950
so all the systems on the
aircraft had to be verified

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.964
and functionally tested,
um, especially the motors.

00:03:31.964 --> 00:03:35.560
Um, and now this aircraft
is deemed airworthy and

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.330
it's gonna make a ferry
flight down to Marana, Arizona

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.100
for a scheduled C check,
which is a normal process

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.450
in the maintenance life of the aircraft.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.890
- [Sam] This is the avionics bay.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.770
- Yeah, main equipment centre.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.960
- [Sam] Main equipment centre, wow.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.630
Is this where, um, all the electronics,

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.810
what kind of electronic this is?

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.047
- [Mechanic] They're radio systems.

00:03:56.047 --> 00:03:56.880
- [Sam] Radios?

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.323
- Radios and navigation, and auto-pilots,

00:04:02.726 --> 00:04:04.206
IRS's.

00:04:04.206 --> 00:04:06.873
(loud whirring)

00:04:10.065 --> 00:04:11.550
- [Mechanic] You have, up
here you have weather radar,

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:12.383
up there

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.980
- [Sam] It goes through the nose, right?

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.233
- [Mechanic] Yeah.
- [Sam] Okay. Wow.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.740
Hidden equipment, I've
never seen this before.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.840
Thanks for showing me.

00:04:25.701 --> 00:04:28.368
(loud whirring)

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.804
- [Sam] The battery's good
and he's writing the report?

00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:35.042
- [Man in blue trousers] He's
writing the reports, yeah.

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:36.312
The APU battery's not working.

00:04:36.312 --> 00:04:38.382
- [Sam] The APU battery's not working?

00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:40.109
But we can still fly?

00:04:40.109 --> 00:04:41.250
- [Man in blue trousers] Yeah.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.610
- There was a lot of work
to prepare this aeroplane

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.450
ready for this flight, to uh,

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.080
Marana, near Phoenix in Arizona.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.610
And then, the aeroplane will
go in a hangar to do a C check,

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.762
which is a heavy maintenance check.

00:04:52.762 --> 00:04:53.595
- [Sam] Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

00:04:53.595 --> 00:04:55.260
- [Sam] Thank you for all the work.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.689
Thank you.
- Yes sir, no problem.

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:57.968
(engine noise drowns out speech)

00:04:57.968 --> 00:04:59.318
- [Sam] Thank you.

00:04:59.318 --> 00:05:01.985
(loud whirring)

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.590
- All doors closed, we're ready for depart

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.980
to Arizona, Marana.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.710
Let me go to the cockpit to sit down.

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.850
- My name's Jeff and this is Adam.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.470
Aeroplane is an old 747SP,

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.260
it's going to the desert

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.450
for some maintenance, it's
gonna take us about four hours

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.060
from Hamilton, Ontario,
flying at 38000 feet,

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.870
mach .86 or .87, um,

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.500
we have plenty of fuel on board,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.690
nobody else on board,
so um, we're in a bit of

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.600
a hurry to get home, we're going fast.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.250
- So it is shorter than
the normal, uh, 747.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:49.390
But, because it's shorter,
because it doesn't carry

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.010
as much weight, it does
use the same engines and

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.600
it is a lot faster,
especially in the climb.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.620
But once you get in the
uh, in the air, speed

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.520
is still the same with it
and the er, longer 747.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.870
- You know, about seven and
a half tonnes an hour, up to

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.650
about 13 tonnes an hour.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.483
- [Sam] This is the whole
aeroplane, it burns --

00:06:10.483 --> 00:06:12.511
- That's for, that's for
all of them, yeah, all four.

00:06:12.511 --> 00:06:13.890
- [Sam] All four engines,
13 tonnes per hour.

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.723
- Yeah.

00:06:14.723 --> 00:06:16.673
- Okay, brake pressure, one pound, check.

00:06:18.368 --> 00:06:19.611
- Thermometers?

00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:22.023
- Armed and checked, right there.

00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:26.522
- And start valve switch, armed?

00:06:26.522 --> 00:06:27.594
(laughter)

00:06:27.594 --> 00:06:29.880
- Eyes on the checklist, and
no eyes on the checklist,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:30.756
people forget it.

00:06:30.756 --> 00:06:32.210
(laughter)

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.560
- Alright.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.840
- Start number four, please.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.983
- Turning number four.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:41.474
Valve open.

00:06:41.474 --> 00:06:42.474
We're at 40.

00:06:44.563 --> 00:06:46.363
- [Jeff] Okay, number three, please.

00:06:47.582 --> 00:06:50.975
- [Man in striped top] Rotation.

00:06:50.975 --> 00:06:52.270
Maximum.

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.820
- [Jeff] Okay, sir, we got three
and four started just fine,

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.970
you're cleared to, uh,
disconnect and just confirm

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.005
there's no bypass been installed here.

00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:03.900
(loud whirring)

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.761
- [Man in striped top]
We've got 70% usually.

00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:06.594
- N2, yeah, that's nice.

00:07:06.594 --> 00:07:08.211
- [Man in striped top]
Yeah, here, here it comes,

00:07:08.211 --> 00:07:10.090
I'm, I got 42 PSI we'll leave it there.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:11.320
- [Jeff] I think that's enough.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.930
Okay, sir, we got four
good starts, you're clear

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.810
to disconnect and uh, have a nice day,

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.390
thanks for the help.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.223
Okay, watch yourself please,
flight controls, left.

00:07:25.213 --> 00:07:29.296
(engine noise drowns out speech)

00:07:30.926 --> 00:07:31.893
- [Man in striped top] Two full up.

00:07:33.615 --> 00:07:34.448
Two full down.

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:37.417
Neutral.

00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:41.500

Uh, just stand them up vertical and then.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.920
- Okay.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:14.003

- [Jeff] You want it?
Go take it.

00:09:50.855 --> 00:09:52.048
How's the climb?

00:09:52.048 --> 00:09:56.131
(engine noise drowns out speech)

00:10:01.521 --> 00:10:04.271
(dramatic music)

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.250
- Wow, it's just unbelievable.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.150
We got this plane took
off and now we're cruising

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.310
at 38000 feet in the blue sky.

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:32.709
I'm a bit exhausted to be
honest, I flew 32 hours

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:36.270
from Mauritius, to Paris, to
Munich, to Toronto last night.

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.750
Um, just to get on this
plane because I'm determined

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:42.316
to fly the SP one more time and
this is a VIP head of state,

00:10:42.316 --> 00:10:44.730
so this is extra bonus.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:46.680
I'm gonna give you guys
a tour now, alright?

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.630
This is the upper deck, as you can see.

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:52.660
And on the upper deck
there's 12 La-Z-Boy seats

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.920
and really, really wide and really, really

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.110
good leg room here.

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:58.974
So I'm gonna show you, see
these beautiful, blue-colored

00:10:58.974 --> 00:11:01.870
bins, huge leg room, really amazing.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.713
Let me recline.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.994
Oh, it actually is almost
like a flat bed, deep recline.

00:11:07.994 --> 00:11:11.494
(electronic lounge music)

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.550
I'm walking towards the back
here, here this is a galley

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.336
on the upper deck, a small
galley, for 12 passengers

00:11:22.336 --> 00:11:24.480
on the upper deck.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.210
So now, let's continue the
tour, going downstairs,

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.043
take a look.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.810
Oh, I love this spiral
staircase, isn't that great?

00:11:33.753 --> 00:11:34.793
Okay.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.510
Alright, let's start with
the top at the 747 nose.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.514
The 747 nose on this plane
is actually a bathroom.

00:11:44.514 --> 00:11:48.014
(electronic lounge music)

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.840
I guess that's the king's bathroom.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.410
And there's a seat here
and there's a toilet

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:57.270
and there's a beautiful,
beautiful, um wash basin here.

00:11:57.270 --> 00:11:59.120
Let me sit on the king's toilet seat.

00:12:00.047 --> 00:12:01.090
(laughter)

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:02.743
One day my life became a king.

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:06.550
Wow, a golden water hose.

00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:08.330
Everything on the plane here is like,

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.350
it's just luxury, extreme gold.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.230
All right, follow me and let's
go to the next, next room

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:18.670
is the king's bedroom
basically, as you can see,

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:21.740
it's right at the quietest
zone, which is the nose zone,

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.453
the bathroom and the bedroom here.

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:26.240
I'm tempted to try out the bed.

00:12:27.989 --> 00:12:30.870
(content noises)

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:32.424
This is incredible.

00:12:32.424 --> 00:12:35.924
(electronic lounge music)

00:12:44.730 --> 00:12:47.660
I'm the only passenger on this SP flight

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.300
and now I really feel
like I'm the king here,

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.850
and I actually have the
whole flight to myself,

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:55.130
unbelievable, such an experience.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.710
There's a controller here, I can push

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.441
and then now the bed's coming up.

00:12:59.441 --> 00:13:02.500
You can actually adjust
your bed up to your liking,

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.203
going up and down with all
the push of a button here.

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.223
Hey, let's continue the
tour to the next cabin here,

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.740
walking past the entrance of the stairs,

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.031
now this is the best room, this
is the conference room here.

00:13:17.031 --> 00:13:20.531
(electronic lounge music)

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:30.540
But the best seat here on
the whole plane probably,

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.170
is this seat here, the blue colour.

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.123
This is for the king, the throne.

00:13:35.558 --> 00:13:38.140
Feels like a king here,
with all my ministers

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:40.865
and all my entourage and followship here.

00:13:40.865 --> 00:13:44.365
(electronic lounge music)

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.040
This seat is so comfortable,
I actually didn't want

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.337
to leave here, but
let's continue the tour.

00:13:53.337 --> 00:13:55.387
I want to show you more about this plane.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.313
This is a passage, onto the next room.

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.190
Okay, there's actually a galley here.

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:14.440
Let's continue.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:19.400
So now, I'm coming to a, uh,
very big conference room here.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.381
This is also a great
dining room, I believe.

00:14:21.381 --> 00:14:24.881
(electronic lounge music)

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:35.290
Look at these paintings.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:37.380
I don't have to tell you
where the ex-owner comes from,

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:39.244
as you can probably guess it right.

00:14:39.244 --> 00:14:40.963
And look at this, a showcase.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:46.350
Wow, everything is, wow,
those are cup holders

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.980
and then plate holders.

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.003
Beautiful showcase.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.590
And then walking continuing down, you see

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:56.840
some sofa on the aisle,
this is probably for

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.908
the bodyguard.

00:14:57.908 --> 00:15:01.408
(electronic lounge music)

00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:04.710
So the bodyguard's probably
sitting on the sofa outside,

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.430
attending to any calls from the ruler.

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.490
After the dining hall here
there's another small,

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.304
private office here, as you can see.

00:15:12.304 --> 00:15:15.804
(electronic lounge music)

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:21.280
And inside here, there's a shower room.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.070
The shower room is here, you can tell.

00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.370
We can go inside having a shower here.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:28.740
Whoa, but today, because the
plane just came out of storage,

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.731
there's no water on the plane,
so I can't enjoy a shower.

00:15:31.731 --> 00:15:35.231
(electronic lounge music)

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.197
And then towards the end
of the plane, there's for

00:15:39.197 --> 00:15:41.760
the entourage, maybe for
the journalist, minister.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:45.111
There's a lot of business
class La-Z-Boy chairs again.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.500
(electronic lounge music)

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.630
And towards the end of the plane,

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.670
this is where economy class is sitting

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:53.690
and probably for the
servants and entourage.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:56.590
And then, what's interesting,
is on the side bin here,

00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:58.460
and these are extra, extra
large bins, look at this.

00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:00.840
Whoa, very large bins.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.020
And there's extra side
storage bins, probably

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:04.900
for some cargoes.

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:07.090
And then there is a
galley at the very end.

00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.697
A 747SP galley.

00:16:08.697 --> 00:16:12.197
(electronic lounge music)

00:16:18.452 --> 00:16:20.450
I'm just walking back, from
all the way at the end of

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:22.360
the plane, to the front of the plane.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.223
As you can see, all the cabin here.

00:16:25.077 --> 00:16:28.577
(electronic lounge music)

00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:34.850
Okay, this is the end of the
747SP tour, back to where

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.860
I started with the VIP toilet
at the front of the nose.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.210
Well guys, I've shown you
every part of this plane.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.070
Tell me which part's your
favourite, leave your comments.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:45.240
Did you like the uh, bedroom in the nose?

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:47.260
Or did you like the middle, the lounge,

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.630
with the king's seats?

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.260
Or did you like the
dining lounge, here where

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.510
I'm sitting right now, or the
back end, where the entourage?

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.968
Or the upper deck, tell
me in your comments.

00:16:55.968 --> 00:16:59.468
(electronic lounge music)

00:17:03.759 --> 00:17:07.092
(plane engines roaring)

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:11.150
On the flight, Jack came down, Jack is

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.500
my flight engineer today on the SP flight.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:17.090
Jack is the pilot and
engineer on Air Force One.

00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:18.550
The VC-1,

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.950
the VC-137, right?

00:17:20.950 --> 00:17:23.010
- Yeah, VC-137 and the VC-25 747.

00:17:23.010 --> 00:17:26.700
- VC-25 is the 747 Air Force One.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.110
- Yes.
- And you're one of the first

00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:29.750
flight engineers on that?

00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:31.540
- Yes, yes the first cruise.

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:34.440
- I am so lucky today, to have you.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.960
Of course, a VIP plane
like this, we need to have

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.327
the best engineer and best pilot.

00:17:39.327 --> 00:17:41.484
- [Jack] I'm the second from the top-left.

00:17:41.484 --> 00:17:43.640
- [Sam] You're the
second from the top-left?

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.120
- [Jack] Yes. Yep that's me.
- [Sam] There you go.

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:48.630
Wow, you're an Air Force One pilot, Jack.

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:49.750
And this photo is?

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:53.063
- [Jack] That's the Oval
Office Christmas uh, 1988.

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:58.550
- [Sam] Oh my God, that's
president Ronald Reagan.

00:17:58.550 --> 00:18:00.150
- [Jack] Yep.
- [Sam] Where are you, Jack?

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:02.727
- [Jack] I'm to the, I'm to the, uh,

00:18:02.727 --> 00:18:04.933
I'm right here.
- [Sam] Wow.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.190
- [Jack] I'm that one.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.680
Talk about the history of this aeroplane.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.035
This aeroplane was built in
1979, delivered to Pan Am.

00:18:13.035 --> 00:18:16.020
In 1986, it was sold to United Airlines.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:19.256
In 1995, the Qatar Amiri
Flight picked up this aeroplane

00:18:19.256 --> 00:18:21.700
and used it until 2018.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.772
Since then, it was parked
at Hamilton airport

00:18:23.772 --> 00:18:27.700
and today, I am on this ferry
flight to Marana, Arizona.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:31.463
This aeroplane will go in for
a C check, looking for a buyer.

00:18:31.463 --> 00:18:34.130
(radio chatter)

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.590
So today's flight's ferry
flight, I'm the only passenger.

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.412
I'm also, I guess, the chief
cabin crew and flight attendant

00:18:44.412 --> 00:18:49.298
and um, we have a lot of drinks
stored in the fridge here,

00:18:49.298 --> 00:18:50.653
which is self-serve.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:54.340
We got Gatorade, we got Diet Pepsi

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.720
and all the drinks are stored here.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.800
And then we have club sandwiches snack.

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.820
I'm enjoying my lunch, club sandwich, on

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.493
the upper deck of the SP seat.

00:19:06.308 --> 00:19:09.320
(engines roaring)

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.320
We're over New Mexico, now.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.150
The views out there's just beautiful,

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:15.580
the clouds broken up and watching

00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:19.600
the wings on the SP, flying
38000 feet's such a treat.

00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.600
I never thought in 2019, I
could fly again on the 747SP.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:28.089
This is probably the greatest
flight I have this year.

00:19:28.089 --> 00:19:30.839
(dramatic music)

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:49.420
I actually been sitting on
different part of the plane on

00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:52.400
this flight, it's a pretty
long flight, four hours.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.070
I think I'm still in a dream.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:56.610
I'm sitting in the king's seat here,

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.100
what's incredible is this is actually

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.100
an electric-controlled
seat, so you can actually

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.920
lower yourself into a
full sleeping position on

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.097
the seat as well, like I'm lowering now.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:15.010
(dramatic music)

00:20:23.815 --> 00:20:27.085
(engines roaring)

00:20:27.085 --> 00:20:30.502
- [Automated Voiceover] Traffic, traffic.

00:20:36.305 --> 00:20:39.055
(dramatic music)

00:20:41.222 --> 00:20:44.624
- 747 turning final,
for runway three-zero.

00:20:44.624 --> 00:20:47.374
(dramatic music)

00:21:15.945 --> 00:21:19.317
- [Jeff] Runway's in sight, landing.

00:21:19.317 --> 00:21:21.223
Little fast, right now.

00:21:22.651 --> 00:21:25.984
(plane engines roaring)

00:21:44.965 --> 00:21:45.882
[Sam] 100.

00:21:48.029 --> 00:21:50.362
- [Automated Voiceover] 100.

00:21:52.456 --> 00:21:53.289
50.

00:21:54.258 --> 00:21:55.202
30.

00:21:55.202 --> 00:21:56.035
20.

00:21:56.035 --> 00:21:56.868
10.

00:21:59.173 --> 00:22:03.590
(drone of engines drowns out speech)

00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:12.092
- [Jeff] Manual braking.

00:22:13.275 --> 00:22:14.192
- 80 knots.

00:22:16.957 --> 00:22:21.957
(drone of engines drowns out speech)

00:22:22.067 --> 00:22:23.470
- Alright, everything down.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:26.303
(engines roaring)

00:22:36.468 --> 00:22:38.163
- [Jeff] It should be parked
right over here, where all

00:22:38.163 --> 00:22:42.394
the Air Canadas are.
- [Adam] Right.

00:22:42.394 --> 00:22:45.227
(engines roaring)

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.923
- [Jeff] Brakes are set.

00:22:53.707 --> 00:22:58.707
(drone of the plane drowns out speech)

00:22:59.047 --> 00:23:00.723
- [Jack] Oh, hey, alright.

00:23:02.077 --> 00:23:04.580
- Here I just arrived, sunny Arizona, wow.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.100
The weather's beautiful here.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:09.960
Just arrived in style
on a private, VIP 747.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.470
But who would've thought, in 2019,

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:14.660
I could still fly a 747SP?

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.650
Well, I hope you enjoyed the ride with me

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:18.529
and thank you so much for watching.

00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:21.279
(dramatic music)
