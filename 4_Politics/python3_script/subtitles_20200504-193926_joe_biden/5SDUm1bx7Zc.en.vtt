others’ e-commerce businesses.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.691
Among the many former British colonies that
have grown into some of the world’s most

00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.320
developed countries, Australia is unique.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.179
Specifically, its economy has developed into
something unlike that of any other, and a

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:24.180
big player in the story of that economy is
China… for better or worse.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.850
To understand China’s role in Australia
and the problem this poses down under, one

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.169
has to start in a very different place—the
United States.

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.410
If it were not for the US, Australia might
not exist.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.180
Prior to the American Revolutionary War, Britain
would primarily send their prisoners to the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.260
American colonies when sentenced to transportation.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Once the colonies became the independent country
of the United States, Britain needed to find

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.490
a new place to put their convicts and for
that, they chose what is now Sydney.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.940
The first fleet of convicts who arrived in
Botany Bay were the origins of what is now

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.450
the country of Australia, and they might not
have made the long trek to there if not for

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.860
the founding of the United States.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.049
Beyond just this, the history of Australia
and the history of the US are eerily similar

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.409
and interlinked.

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.330
The two country’s foundings are offset from
each other by 180 years, but parallel significantly.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.460
Australia is almost the exact same size as
the contiguous United States, and even has

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.030
similar dimensions to the US.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.840
Both nations include similarly diverse landscapes
and climates, and both started in the east.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.509
They then each expanded west, taking over
indigenous land, largely fueled by the discovery

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:33.359
of gold and its subsequent mining.

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:37.799
While the scale is obviously quite different,
both nations were quite isolated by distance

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.210
to the European world, although close to a
number of other European colonies.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.630
Both nations started with their small British
populations but then grew primarily through

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.509
immigration from English-speaking countries,
secondly through immigration from non English-speaking

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.170
European countries, and thirdly through immigration
from the rest of the world.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.139
They even share the same story in the founding
of their capital cities—they each built

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:01.509
a planned city in a central location between
their two major population centers as to not

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.429
favor one over the other.

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.799
The similarities go on and on, but the point
is that Australia and the US were largely

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.209
dealt the same cards, but got vastly different
results

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.560
The US quickly developed into one of the most
politically, economically, and socially powerfully

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.920
countries on earth with a population well
over 300 million.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.540
Australia, however, never grew into more than
a small, regional power, with a small population

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.530
of just 25 million.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.640
Now, Australia is no doubt a highly successful
nation.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.519
It’s among the world’s most wealthy countries,
the world’s most developed countries, it

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.060
has one of the world’s lowest unemployment
rates, one of the world’s lowest poverty

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.000
rates, and is one of the highest scoring in
the world happiness index.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.030
What the country is definitively not, though,
is a superpower.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.099
While you can never forget the role of pure
chance, given the similar starting position

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.510
of both countries, the first thing one has
to look at for a reason behind this is Australia’s

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.510
geography.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.650
Despite their similar sizes, what differentiates
Australia from the US is its desolation.

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.850
About 35% of the landmass is considered desert,
which generally cannot sustain large population

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.860
centers.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.879
There are of course exceptions to this, most
notably in the Middle East where huge cities

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.239
such as Dubai, Doha, and Riyadh sprung up
in the middle of deserts, but each of these

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.129
largely developed as a result of oil booms
in their respective countries.

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.659
While the deserts of Australia do have oil
deposits, none of these are at a similar scale

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:27.069
to those of the Middle East, have not been
significantly exploited, and, in addition,

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.840
it’s largely Perth, on the western coast,
that has emerged as a hub for oil, rather

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.379
than an inland city.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.489
With limited arable land and a harsh climate,
the inland of Australia just isn’t conducive

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.360
to most human life.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.680
That results in a fairly striking population
density map.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.349
Just five major population centers have emerged—Brisbane,
Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth.

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.989
Each of these is directly on the coast.

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.950
The largest city in Australia that’s not
directly on the coast, in fact, is Canberra—the

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.920
capital—which has a population of just 400,000
and was a planned city, meaning its development

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.390
cannot be a perfect indicator for the viability
of inland life in Australia.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.349
Even then, it sits a mere 70 miles or 115
kilometers from the coast.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.609
If you’re talking about population centers
that are significantly offset from the coast,

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.319
in the outback, as it’s called, the largest
would probably be Alice Springs—a northern

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:22.400
territory town of just 24,000.

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.169
This desolation can be further exemplified
by the country’s road network.

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.250
The primary highway linking the population
centers of Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:35.120
Adelaide to Perth is just a single, two-lane
road, traversing the southern coast of the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.120
country.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.509
The same is the case for the Stuart highway
which serves as the primary link from the

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.650
south coast to the north coast up the center
of the country—it too is just a two-lane

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:45.650
road.

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.180
What this all means is that much of Australia’s
land just doesn’t lend itself to the development

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.380
of large-scale human settlements, leaving
it fairly empty.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.860
Australia’s vastness served a crucial role
in developing it into one of the world’s

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.240
wealthiest economies, though.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.750
The country is now the world’s largest exporter
of minerals.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:10.449
It has huge amounts of coal, iron, lead, diamonds,
gold, uranium, and more, mostly in its vast,

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.569
open, outback.

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:15.931
That means that the primary economic activity
in Australia’s interior is mining, and with

00:05:15.931 --> 00:05:20.389
natural resources making up a majority of
the country’s exports, it were these minerals

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.440
that played a major part in growing Australia
into a wealthy economy.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.750
They also cemented who Australia’s economic
partners would be.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.380
Nearly 30% of Australia’s exports go to
China, primarily driven by China’s significant

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.520
demand for minerals.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.870
China, in fact, in the number one spot, buys
more from Australia than the number two, three,

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.639
and four countries combined—Japan, the US,
and South Korea.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.020
Beyond just Chinese companies buying minerals
from Australian mining companies to use in

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.250
their factories, there are also sizable amounts
of investment coming in from Chinese companies.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.830
Overall, it’s safe to say that the Australian
mining sector would not be what it is without

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.900
China, but Australia also relies on the billion
people up north to act as customers for another

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.220
crucial aspect of their economy—education.

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.250
As strange as it might sound, universities,
which in most cases are non-profits, form

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.440
a sizable part of the Australian economy as
Australian universities are some of the most

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.010
successful in the world at attracting international
students.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.360
The country is home to about 875,000
international students across all types of

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360
schools.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.870
Now, of course, remember, the entire population
of Australia is only about 25 million.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:34.840
What that means is that, in the entire country,
1 out of every 28 people are international

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.910
students.

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.050
Of these international students, the highest
proportion, by far, are Chinese, at 30%.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.490
That represents a quarter of a million Chinese
students studying in Australia.

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:50.389
On the flip side, that means that at any given
time, 1 out of every 5,000 Chinese people

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.160
are studying in Australia.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.699
Within universities, Chinese make up 10% of
the average student body, however, considering

00:06:56.699 --> 00:07:00.979
they tend to cluster together, certain universities
have far higher proportions.

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:07.379
At UNSW the proportion is 23%, at the University
of Sydney, it’s 24%, and numbers are similar

00:07:07.379 --> 00:07:09.440
at other hotspots.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.720
All in all, these Chinese students contribute
more than about $10 billion a year to the

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.520
Australian economy.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.220
There are also plenty of other sectors that
play a part of China’s huge economic influence

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.199
in Australia such as tourism, manufacturing,
services, and more.

00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:28.940
Given how much the two economies are interlinked,
therefore, as China has risen, so too has

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.940
Australia.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:34.200
This link to the success of one of the biggest
economic success stories ever has helped Australia

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.849
earn an impressive record.

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:41.550
It has gone 28 years, since 1991, without
a recession.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:44.441
While the rest of world struggled through
the Asian Financial crisis, the collapse of

00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:49.080
the dot-com bubble, and the Great Recession,
Australia just kept on going with quarter

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:52.580
after quarter after quarter of economic growth.

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:58.289
By most measures, in modern history, no developed
country has ever gone such a long period without

00:07:58.289 --> 00:07:59.620
a recession.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:02.470
But this all, of course, has a flip side.

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:06.129
Such heavy economic reliance on a country
that politically, Australia doesn’t always

00:08:06.129 --> 00:08:08.120
agree with is dangerous.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:12.880
An Australian-Chinese trade war would certainly
cause a lot more damage down under than up

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:13.880
north.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:18.880
At the same time, there are quite a few efforts
by China to influence Australia.

00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.090
China has made plenty of attempts to tip politics
in the country in their favor.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.860
As one, small example, Chinese Communist Party
run or affiliated WeChat accounts, a popular

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.690
social network in China, released posts critical
and mocking of Australian politician and current

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:36.839
prime minister Scott Morrison in the run-up
to the May, 2019 Australian election.

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:41.550
Beyond that, the Chinese government has been
known to unofficially sponsor certain pro-China,

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:46.160
ethnically-Chinese candidates for various
Australian offices through a variety of methods.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.200
In media, China has been known to impart vast
control over Chinese-language outlets in Australia

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.950
and responds harshly to criticism through
defamation lawsuits and more.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:59.160
On university campuses, the Chinese Communist
Party is known to have vast amounts of influence,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.260
with accusations that the government has built
spy networks within Australian universities

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.890
to monitor Chinese students and their political
views.

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:10.420
In one instance, a Chinese student studying
in Brisbane participated in a rally supporting

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:15.510
the anti-Beijing protests in Hong Kong, and
days later, the student's family back in China

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.970
were visited by the authorities.

00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:22.170
There is a very clear but unspoken threat
by China to Australia—if you make things

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:26.510
difficult for us politically, we’ll make
things difficult for you economically.

00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:31.231
How things typically work in China is that,
in order to achieve business success, even

00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:35.690
when running a fully private company, one
needs to be cosy with the Chinese Communist

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:37.690
Party that runs the government.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:42.260
Therefore, even if a Chinese company is fully
private, it knows that it needs to act in

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.100
a way that aligns with China’s politics.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.089
Of course, while some of China’s tools of
economic warfare are more traditional, like

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:53.589
tariffs, a lot of its influence stems from
the actions of the private sector.

00:09:53.589 --> 00:09:57.930
Any private Chinese company knows that, if
Australia suddenly took a hard pro Hong Kong

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:02.550
independence stance, for example, the CCP
might not be happy about continued business

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:03.550
with the country.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.540
Australia’s therefore in a tricky spot where
it’s a western country socially and politically,

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:12.070
but in many ways, an eastern country economically.

00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:17.510
As a result, taking a political stance against
any actions by China comes at a much higher

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.470
cost than that of a less economically linked
country.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.730
Australia quite literally cannot afford to
lose China.

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:30.389
A trade-war with China on the scale of the
US’ would devastate the Australian economy.

00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:35.250
China no doubt has done wonders for Australia,
but the point is that too much reliance on

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:40.470
any economy, no matter how strong that economy
may be, is a risky strategy.

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:44.190
When that strong economy is run by a foreign
government that can adjust its flows in an

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:46.320
instant, that’s even riskier.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:51.100
According to one study run by the Reserve
Bank of Australia, if China’s GDP contracted

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:57.240
by just 5%, that would result in Australia’s
GDP falling by 2.5%.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:03.510
That is a clear-cut case of economic reliance,
so, if Australia wants to keep up its unprecedented

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:09.850
period of economic growth irregardless of
how China’s doing, diversification is crucial.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:14.590
I know a lot of Wendover Productions viewers
are the type of people who already run or

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.459
would like to run their own businesses, and
one of the fastest growing industries out

00:11:18.459 --> 00:11:21.050
there is, of course, e-commerce.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.010
Traditionally, starting any sort of business
that involves selling physical goods required

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:29.220
a ton of work to build out the infrastructure
necessary to do that, there was a huge barrier

00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:35.170
to entry, but nowadays, it’s super simple,
especially thanks to platforms like Shopify.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:39.080
Shopify now powers more than a million online
businesses meaning you’ve almost certainly

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.330
bought something through Shopify, but on the
merchant side, it makes setting up, marketing,

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:45.060
running, and managing your business easy.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:49.910
I, of course, know since it’s what I’ve
used for ages to run my Wendover Productions

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.060
merch store.

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:55.560
Shopify has all the tools you need, fantastic
customer service, and really works as a partner

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.760
to independent business owners, so if you
want to start or move your business to Shopify,

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:05.600
head over to shopify.com/Wendover and try
it for free for 14 days, no credit card required.
