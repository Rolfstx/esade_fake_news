00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.990
I've been teasing today's
recipe over on Instagram

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.310
for the last several weeks,

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.970
and that's because I made
it over and over again,

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.050
making sure that it
was absolutely perfect.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.360
And now that it is, I'm
happy to share it with you.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.380
So today, we are making
the best falafel recipe

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.320
that you have ever tasted.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.880
Falafel are little balls
of chickpea goodness

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.450
that are crispy on the outside
and soft on the inside.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.860
They're a traditional
Middle Eastern recipe,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.520
they are naturally vegan,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.780
and they are perfect on top of salads

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.180
or in wraps, in pita, or in sandwiches,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.210
though I personally love them on salads

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.820
because it means you get
a little extra greens.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.760
I've had my fair share of falafel

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.950
on travels through Egypt,
Israel, and Jordan.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.850
And last year, when I was in Tel Aviv,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.220
I got a behind-the-scenes
look at the falafel making

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.720
happening at the very
popular Hakosem restaurant

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.100
where crowds line up for their falafel

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.730
and their gluten-free pita.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.770
So, with all of that inspiration,

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.520
let me show you how to make
the best falafel recipe.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.810
To get started, you'll need
one cup of dried chickpeas

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:05.940
and it is critical

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.730
that you do use dried
chickpeas in this recipe

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:10.720
and not canned chickpeas,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.310
as canned chickpeas are too soft and wet

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.383
and your falafel will not
form properly if you use them.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.670
You'll need to soak your chickpeas

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.490
for at least eight to 12 hours,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.860
and this is easy to do overnight.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.550
Just add them to a large bowl

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.470
and cover them with two
to three inches of water.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.320
Remember that the chickpeas
will almost triple in size

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.813
so you do want plenty
of water in the bowl.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.573
The next morning,

00:01:34.573 --> 00:01:36.880
you'll see how much your
chickpeas have expanded

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.500
and the water might
look a little yellowish.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.050
That's fine, just drain
and rinse your chickpeas

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.123
and then add them to your food processor.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.240
Dice up about a half a cup of yellow onion

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.710
and you just roughly chop this.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.830
The food processor will
do much of the work,

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.160
but I find that it does help

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.800
to do a little chopping beforehand

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.593
to keep the texture consistent.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.900
The best falafel recipes I've eaten

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.630
have always had heaps of herbs inside,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.400
so we're adding a generous amount today.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.880
Grab a large bunch of parsley
and then roughly chop it.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.470
It should equal about
one cup, lightly packed,

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.770
if you wanna double check,

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.720
and then add it to your food processor.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.740
Next, we'll add cilantro,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.780
and you want an equal amount
of cilantro to parsley.

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.500
So, roughly chop your cilantro

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.733
and add that to your
food processor as well.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.790
Now, this is what I consider
the special ingredient

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.640
of this recipe, and it's a green pepper.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.630
I'm using a small serrano pepper

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.870
but you could use a small
jalapeno pepper as well.

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.370
You don't want too much pepper,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.300
just enough to add a kick of flavor

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.650
without overpowering the falafel.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.750
If your pepper is bigger
than what you see here,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.160
just use half of it,

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.830
but don't omit the pepper
without trying it first.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.760
And you'll just have to
trust me on this one.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.440
So, remove the seeds and membrane

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.860
from the inside of the pepper,

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.393
dice it up, and add it
to the food processor.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.260
Next, we'll add three cloves of garlic,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.070
and do use fresh garlic
rather than garlic powder

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.220
for the most robust flavor.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.390
Again, you can always tweak

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.090
the amount of garlic to your liking.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.830
So, just peel the garlic cloves

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.070
and toss them into the
food processor as well.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.550
Now we'll add a couple of spices

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.590
that are often used in
Middle Eastern cooking

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.890
and which smell amazing,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.420
and that includes one teaspoon of cumin,

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.050
one teaspoon of salt,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.620
a half a teaspoon of
cardamom, which I love,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.963
and a quarter teaspoon of black pepper.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.850
Once everything is in your food processor,

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.330
add the lid, and then
pulse it several times,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.840
scraping down the sides in between.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.570
After you've done this
for a minute or two,

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:39.630
you should have a mixture

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.970
that still has a little
bit of texture to it

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.593
but it also resembles coarse sand.

00:03:45.712 --> 00:03:48.295
(mellow music)

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.230
Transfer the falafel dough
mixture to a mixing bowl

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.770
and then add two tablespoons
of chickpea flour

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.200
and a half a teaspoon of baking soda.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.550
These ingredients help to
bind everything together

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:09.810
and make the falafel nice
and fluffy on the inside.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.310
I do have additional tips
on the full blog post

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.040
if your mixture is too wet

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.320
or too dry and crumbly at this stage,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.750
so make sure to check those out

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.383
if you need a little extra help.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.650
Cover the bowl and then
refrigerate the mixture

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.960
for 30 minutes to an hour so it can chill

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.830
and all of the flavors can melt together.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.550
After it's chilled
comes the scooping part.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.680
I'm using a medium cookie
scoop, which I'll link to below,

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.930
and I love it as it helps

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.040
to keep all of your falafel the same size.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.890
So, scoop the mixture into your hands

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.580
and form them into balls.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.720
The ball should stick together
but they are a bit fragile,

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.780
so do be gentle with them.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.420
Repeat this process until
you've used up all of your dough

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.963
and just place the uncooked
falafel on a plate.

00:04:54.154 --> 00:04:56.737
(mellow music)

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.840
Now, if you do prefer
the flatter patty shape,

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.110
you can do this by hand as well.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.960
I tend to scoop a little bit
more than I do for the balls,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.120
and then just form them into
patty shapes with my hands.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.180
The flatter shape is perfect for serving

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.980
in pita or sandwiches,

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.970
so it helps to think of how
you might serve the falafel

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.583
before you start shaping them.

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.380
When it comes to cooking falafel,

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.370
I'll show you three different methods.

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:25.860
The first is deep frying,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.560
which is the most common
method used in restaurants,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.710
but it does use the most oil.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.930
And in terms of oil,

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.060
I'm using avocado oil
as it's a high heat oil

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.670
and it's my personal
favorite oil to cook with,

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.650
but you could use a vegetable oil as well.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.260
Heat the oil on medium heat

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.200
until the temperature reaches
350 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.670
Some websites recommend
375 degrees, but I found

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.570
that this made the outside
of the falafel much darker

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.180
and I prefer a more
golden, crispy outside.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.090
Once your oil has come to temperature,

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.350
gently drop your falafel balls in the oil

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.590
and let them cook for a minute or so.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.180
Cook them in batches of
six to eight at a time,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.380
and I'll use my skimmer

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.270
to move them around a bit and take a peek

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.110
to make sure that they're
not getting too dark.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.120
Once they look beautiful and golden,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.330
we move them to a paper-towel-lined plate

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.983
and repeat the process.

00:06:18.134 --> 00:06:20.717
(mellow music)

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.967
Now I'll show you how to pan-fry falafel,

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:37.090
and this method is great
as it uses less oil.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.670
You only need a few
tablespoons of oil in a pan

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:42.810
and I prefer a cast iron pan for this.

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.580
Heat the oil to medium
high or until it sizzles

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.610
when you drop the first
falafel in the pan.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.550
Cook the falafel for two to
three minutes on each side

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.470
or until they're golden brown.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.283
Then, transfer them to a
paper-towel-lined plate.

00:06:58.146 --> 00:07:00.729
(mellow music)

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.120
Our last method is baked falafel

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.830
and you'll start by preheating your oven

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.850
to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.880
Grab a baking sheet and either spray

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.020
or lightly brush it with oil.

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:25.700
Then add your falafel to the pan

00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.030
and lightly coat the top
sides with oil as well.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.250
Cook them in the oven for
about 25 to 30 minutes

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:34.360
and flip them halfway through.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.193
When they're done,

00:07:35.193 --> 00:07:37.823
they should be just as
golden as the other methods.

00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:41.424
(mellow music)

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.040
So here's my flatter, baked falafel,

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.880
my pan-fried falafel, and
my deep-fried falafel.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.150
You can see that they
look pretty darn similar,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.760
so it's really up to you
on which method you prefer.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.460
Falafel are best eaten warm

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.200
and while they're nice
and crispy on the outside.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.380
If you break one open,

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.960
you'll see that beautiful
vibrant green color,

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:12.410
and I'll forewarn you that
they are highly addictive.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.600
Drizzle your falafel with tahini sauce,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.570
which is a creamy and
flavorful requirement,

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:20.330
and I have a separate recipe
for that on my website,

00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:22.090
downshiftology.com.

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:23.510
If you want to make a feast,

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:25.860
serve the falafel with my homemade hummus,

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.940
lentil salad, cauliflower rice tabbouleh,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:31.330
and za'atar roasted cauliflower.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.390
And I have separate videos for the hummus

00:08:33.390 --> 00:08:35.030
and tabbouleh on this channel,

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.430
so make sure to watch those videos.

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:39.170
I hope you guys enjoy your falafels

00:08:39.170 --> 00:08:41.060
and make sure to tag me on social media

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.843
when you whip them up because
I would love to see them.
