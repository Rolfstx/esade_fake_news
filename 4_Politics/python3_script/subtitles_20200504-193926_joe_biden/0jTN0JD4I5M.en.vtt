00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:03.350
(dramatic music)

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.250
- The Boeing saga this past year

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.840
is an example of how
not to handle a crisis.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.260
- A relatively small design issue

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.120
that exploded into massive catastrophe.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.770
- They did not build in
margin for human error.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.750
- This brand new plane crashed twice

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.700
in the span of about five months.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.150
How could this possibly happen?

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.100
- How long has this plane
going to be grounded?

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.250
Boeing says there's a fix.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.240
When is it coming?

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.810
- Boeing was once held up
to be the gold standard

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.340
of engineering excellence.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.190
And today it has lost
a lot of credibility.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.330
- The 737 MAX scandal will
change aviation history

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.330
like no other event in the
past five or six decades.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.660
- [Narrator] Until relatively recently,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.320
Boeing's reputation among
pilots and passengers

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.880
was second to none.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.150
Today, that faith has
been significantly shaken

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.980
as America's aviation
giant continues to reel

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.770
from the fall out of
two devastating crashes

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.690
that killed 346 people.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.960
The MAX crisis has severely crippled

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.610
the nation's biggest exporter.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.410
Exposed critical flaws in the relationship

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.470
between the FAA and the
businesses it regulates.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.390
And raised serious questions,
how was this able to happen?

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.920
Who is to blame, and what does this mean

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.403
for the future of the aviation industry?

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:31.090
(dramatic music)

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.370
In late 2018, things were
going pretty well for Boeing.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.920
- Before the first crash,
Boeing thought of the MAX

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.280
as a cash cow that
would keep on producing.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.550
- They were just breaking
all sorts of records

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.360
for revenue and airplane deliveries.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.100
- [Narrator] A global boom in air travel

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.330
had helped the company
earn record profits,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.660
which drove it's stock
price to new heights.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.740
- Problem prior to the crash for Boeing

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.480
was that Boeing couldn't
make the MAX fast enough.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.040
We wrote about how Boeing

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.810
was running out of
parking spots for the MAX.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.030
- [Narrator] The MAX
is the latest iteration

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.460
of Boeing's 737 aircraft,

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.950
which first entered
commercial service in 1968.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.570
- It's kind of the work
horse of Boeing's fleet

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.760
if you've kind of done any
kind of medium length travel,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.540
domestically, you've almost
definitely flown on a 737.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.630
- [Narrator] As times
changed so did the 737.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.360
Over the years, Boeing has
updated the jet dozens of times.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.470
All the while maintaining
the original air frame.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.530
And this system worked well for Boeing.

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.900
The 737 is the most successful

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.160
commercial airplane ever made.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.060
In 2017, 50 years after
the first 737 took off,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.870
Boeing was following a
long established play book

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.140
when it delivered one of
the first 737 MAX eight's

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.000
to a budget Indonesian
airline called Lion Air.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.350
- [Newsreader] An
Indonesia passenger plane

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.550
crashing into the sea
minutes after take off.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.113
- [Newsreader] 189 people on board.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.170
- [Narrator] On October 29th, 2018,

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.560
a Boeing 737 MAX eight jet
crashed into the Java sea,

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.380
killing everyone on board.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.270
- There are a bunch of questions
that immediately come up.

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.410
A brand new plane went
into commercial service

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.320
about a year before it crashed.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.400
That's unusual.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.360
What could have happened?

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.810
Could there have been pilot error?

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.960
Was there a maintenance issue?

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.880
- [Narrator] Some of the
most important reporting

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.500
to come out after the crash

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.570
was the story about an
obscure piece of software.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.850
- We were obviously trying
to understand things

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.090
about this airplane and the
systems on the airplane,

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.470
and so I went to a
aviation safety conference.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.010
One of the people we talked to

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.680
was a pretty senior Boeing executive,

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.430
and he acknowledged that
they never told pilots

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.380
about the system.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.180
And essentially what's the big deal.

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:50.820
- [Narrator] Boeing at the time argued

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:52.170
that pilots didn't need to know

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.770
about the existence of the
automated flight control system,

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.600
who's name the public would
eventually learn was MCAS.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.770
- Well how can that be?

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.800
How can there be something on a plane,

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.980
not only that pilots
didn't fully understand

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:06.420
and weren't trained on,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.660
but also just didn't know that it existed.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.750
- After the first crash I think
we still didn't yet realize

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.917
how big the story would become.

00:04:13.917 --> 00:04:14.870
(mellow music)

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.610
- [Narrator] The origin of the MAX scandal

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.623
has it's roots in the rivalry
between Airbus and Boeing.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.230
Ever since the 1990's

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:24.730
the two companies have
been locked in competition.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.830
By the 2010's the
commercial aviation market

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.950
was essentially a stable duopoly,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.260
with each company controlling
roughly half of the market.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.720
At the heart of this rivalry

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.220
has long been each company's

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.670
flagship commercial passenger plane.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.850
For Boeing, that aircraft is the 737,

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.497
for Airbus, it's the A320.

00:04:45.497 --> 00:04:46.330
(dramatic music)

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:48.630
In 2010, Airbus shook up the market

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.120
when it announced the A320 Neo,

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.440
an updated version of
the A320 aircraft line.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.090
Neo planes wouldn't
just be updated versions

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.480
of a familiar aircraft, they
would also be cheaper to run.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.860
- Fuel efficiency's the
touchstone of anything

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.060
that airlines do.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.360
I mean, if you talk about bean
counters and penny pinchers,

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.860
airlines are the ultimate in those areas.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.470
- [Narrator] It's time to think max.

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.230
- Boeing did not design
a completely new plane

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.550
from the ground up because
it would have taken too long.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:17.800
- [Narrator] To make the MAX,

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.560
Boeing took the existing 737 air frame

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.690
and paired it with a new,
more powerful engine.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.440
But doing that changed
the plane's aerodynamics.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.410
One effect was that in
rare flying conditions

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.690
the aircraft's nose would pitch up.

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.260
This is where the MCAS software came in.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.070
It was designed to automatically
push the plane's nose down.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.610
- One former Boeing engineer
who didn't work on the MAX,

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.890
characterized the software
fix as a band aid.

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:45.840
We've been learning for the last year

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.426
how the band aid wasn't as
strong as Boeing needed it to be.

00:05:50.426 --> 00:05:53.720
(slow piano music)

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.010
- [Narrator] On March
10th 2019, a second crash.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:58.640
This time in Ethiopia.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.610
All 157 people on board were killed.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.680
- [Male] I heard about the second crash.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.951
- When on Sunday morning.

00:06:05.951 --> 00:06:08.850
- I woke up and kind of rolled
over and looked at my phone.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.030
- I got a text from an airline official,

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.800
and it simply read, "MAX eight".

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.760
I thought, how could this be, another one?

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.000
- From the moment that
the second crash happened,

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.920
we've really thought or written
about almost nothing else.

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.700
- Plane crashes in
general are pretty rare.

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.950
Plane crash within five
months of each other,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.575
is pretty stunning.

00:06:29.575 --> 00:06:30.840
(dramatic music)

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.270
- This is unparalleled in
modern commercial aviation.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.510
It doesn't happen.

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:36.840
- [Narrator] A day after the crash,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.450
in an unprecedented move,
China grounded the MAX.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.360
Other nations quickly followed.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.640
- China grounding the planes

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.210
before the FAA had done
that was a huge deal,

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.360
and it came as a huge
surprise to all of us.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.620
- Historically speaking,
the FAA has always been the,

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.350
the leader that all the
other countries followed.

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:57.660
- [Narrator] This was the
first time in aviation history

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.730
that any nation's regulatory
body had overruled the FAA.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.140
- An emergency order of prohibition

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.457
to ground all flights
of the 737 MAX eight.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.480
- [Narrator] Two days
later, the FAA relented

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.190
and decided to ground the MAX.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.700
This marked the beginning
of the agency's troubles,

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.490
as the MAX crisis brought the regulator

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.093
under increased scrutiny.

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.820
In April, Boeing began to face
the financial consequences

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:25.703
of the scandal.

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:32.440
News then emerged that Boeing
hadn't informed the FAA

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.750
the warning system that
helped pilots diagnose

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.220
an MCAS malfunction wasn't
working as intended.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.760
Boeing's lack of transparency about MCAS

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.240
was highlighted yet again

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.100
when a recording emerged of a meeting.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:46.070
- [Michael] If you're
gonna give us a system

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.750
that we are gonna be affected by,

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.650
it's hugely important that
we get briefed on what it is.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:54.150
- [Narrator] The story was
based partially on a recording

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:56.710
made about a month after the first crash,

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:58.360
when a group of Boeing executives

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.200
met with the American
Airlines pilot union.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.250
In the tape, the pilots
confront the executives,

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.900
saying they were not told
enough about the plane.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:07.733
- [Michael] Most people say,

00:08:07.733 --> 00:08:09.420
"If it ain't Boeing, it ain't goin'."

00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:10.313
That's where most of us get that from

00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:12.450
because we think we've
been dealt with honestly

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:13.920
by the company.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.705
We're getting told via the news media

00:08:16.705 --> 00:08:19.100
that you know what, the average pilot,

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.430
that's a little bit too much information

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:22.993
for him to understand and
be able to comprehend.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.550
- [Narrator] Then in July it was revealed

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.100
that after the first crash,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.110
the FAA had done it's own
internal risk analysis

00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.080
of a potential second crash.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.430
- Their analysis showed that if the FAA

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:37.320
and Boeing didn't do anything

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.340
and just kept the planes
operating as they had been,

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:44.050
there would be 15 crashes
over some two decades.

00:08:44.050 --> 00:08:47.970
That would make the 737 MAX
the most dangerous jet airliner

00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:50.650
ever developed in the modern world.

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:52.220
- What was going on inside Boeing?

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.100
What was going on inside FAA?

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.970
Did anyone discuss grounding the plane

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.360
after the first crash?

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.730
- A lot of questions have been raised

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:01.120
about what the FAA's role was.

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:05.150
Whether the agency was
really doing it's job

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:09.170
in overseeing the design
and production of the MAX.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:12.040
You know, the FAA
delegates Boeing employees

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.670
to do some of that oversight itself,

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.890
and I think some people
have questioned whether

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.020
that has gone too far.

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.470
You know, whether it's sort of the fox

00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.099
guarding the hen house.

00:09:21.099 --> 00:09:23.682
(mellow music)

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.270
- We set out to pin point the root cause

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:33.000
of how Boeing created
a plane that crashes.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.450
We really tried to get to the heart

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.530
of how they came to these decisions.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.790
- Why didn't they use two sensors?

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:42.230
They only used one sensor

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.230
and that is sort of a
violation of basic engineering.

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.650
- At the root of it

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:52.580
Boeing made an incredibly
flawed assumption.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.290
- But they failed to recognize badly,

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:59.620
that all these other emergency
signals would be confusing.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.720
Would make it very very
difficult for a crew

00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.900
to do the right thing
in a fast enough way.

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.190
- [Narrator] Despite the intense scrutiny

00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:08.320
surrounding the MAX,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.950
at that time Boeing wasn't
especially forthcoming

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.540
with information about the plane.

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.230
- I spent much of the summer
knocking a lot of doors

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.880
in the Seattle area, trying
to find Boeing and FAA people

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.730
who would help us understand
how all this happened.

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.520
People would politely
say no, close the door,

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:30.130
sometimes it was more of a
door being slammed in our face.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:33.120
- We went to, I think it was
something like 200 houses,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.970
you know, drove 500 miles.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.870
It was really difficult to get people

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.950
to agree to talk with us.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:42.870
- [Narrator] That fall,
Boeing CEO, Dennis Muilenburg

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:44.340
appeared before congress,

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.670
where he was sharply
criticized by senators.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.920
- How did you not, in February,

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.590
set out a nine alarm fire to say,

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:54.090
we need to figure out
exactly what happened.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.500
- We're not quite sure
what Mr Faulkner meant

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.810
by that exchange.

00:10:57.810 --> 00:10:59.500
- I think it was widely thought

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.548
that he did not perform
well in those hearings.

00:11:02.548 --> 00:11:06.490
- He survived two days of
really tough questioning,

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.310
but he was brutally wounded.

00:11:08.310 --> 00:11:09.470
- In conjunction with those hearings

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:12.650
he sat down with family members
in a closed door meeting,

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:16.230
and they sat there with large posters

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.460
with photos of their loved ones.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.600
In one case, a family
member brought photos

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.740
just of the coffins of his
wife and his mother in law,

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.400
and his three children, and he lost

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.470
and he told the Boeing officials,

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.800
including Dennis Muilenburg,

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.510
that he didn't feel they deserved

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.930
to see his family members' faces.

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.100
In December, the company finally said,

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:37.750
we can't keep making these planes,

00:11:37.750 --> 00:11:39.540
we're going to have to
shut down our factory.

00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:41.270
And that has a huge ripple effect

00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.450
throughout the supply chain, and I think,

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.300
all of the relatively rosy projections

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.980
that Dennis Muilenburg had been
making throughout the year,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.730
finally it came to a head,

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:54.270
and the board said enough is enough.

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.880
- [Narrator] Less than a month
later, Muilenburg was fired.

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.530
- It wasn't surprising when
Muilenburg was pushed out,

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.420
it was more surprising
that it took the board

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.293
as long as it did to push Muilenburg out.

00:12:04.293 --> 00:12:05.559
- He wasn't visible.

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:06.877
You know a question that came up a lot was

00:12:06.877 --> 00:12:08.047
"Where is Dennis?"

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.230
- [Narrator] In the new year,

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.260
Boeing has continued to
grapple with the fall out

00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:13.520
from the MAX scandal.

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.540
The end of which doesn't
seem to be anywhere in sight.

00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:17.800
On January 10th,

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:20.660
Boeing released a batch of
internal communications.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.470
- They showed Boeing employees

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.780
talking about tricking regulators

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:27.240
and say some really unflattering things

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.460
about the regulators that
they were dealing with.

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.330
- It gives you a real glimpse
into culture inside Boeing.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.400
- [Narrator] It was
these internal messages

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.930
that likely led to
Boeing's hand being forced

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:39.860
to reverse their long held stance

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:42.530
that pilots didn't need
simulator training.

00:12:42.530 --> 00:12:44.980
- That is a stunning development.

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.550
- We had been writing about
how going back nearly a decade,

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.210
Boeing had designed the MAX from the start

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:55.320
to not require additional
simulator training for pilots.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.220
- [Narrator] Flight simulators

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.130
are highly specialized machines,

00:12:58.130 --> 00:13:00.280
built to train pilots on the ground.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.270
One of the MAX's biggest selling points,

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:04.120
touted by Boeing from the beginning,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.300
was that the pilots who
knew earlier 737 models,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.270
like the 737 NG,

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.550
wouldn't need much more
training to pilot the MAX.

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.500
For years, Boeing assured
pilots, airlines and regulators

00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:20.120
that pilots who knew the
NG could easily fly the MAX

00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:22.640
after just a few hours
of training on an iPad.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.730
- Requiring pilots to go
through simulator training

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:28.140
before flying the MAX
sort of raises questions

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.040
about the fundamental, you know,

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.260
value proposition of the MAX.

00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:34.623
You know, what is the value of the MAX?

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.070
- [Narrator] Since March 8th of 2019,

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:41.603
Boeing's market value has
dropped close to $112 billion.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.490
- There is an ongoing
criminal investigation

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:45.970
by the justice department.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.610
There is a civil investigation

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:49.890
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:51.840
It is also the subject of inquiries

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.880
by the congressional law makers.

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.260
It is also being looked at

00:13:57.260 --> 00:14:00.860
by the Department of
Transportation and the FAA.

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.023
The plane is still on the ground.

00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:07.383
Perhaps most important
of all, 346 people died.

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:11.350
- The MAX saga shows
that there's something

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:14.340
that needs to be reassessed
in that whole system.

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.160
It's time to take a breath.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:19.010
And let's think about the
down sides of automation.

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:20.450
How it can confuse pilots,

00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:23.180
how it can introduce
unexpected consequences

00:14:23.180 --> 00:14:24.950
and new hazards.

00:14:24.950 --> 00:14:26.410
So we're looking at a new world

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:29.330
where other regulators
will be much more assertive

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.060
and will take a much greater
role in approving aircraft,

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:35.090
even if they're US aircraft.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:37.040
- [Narrator] In an email
to the Wall Street Journal,

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.517
Boeing said, "The development
to the MCAS portion

00:14:39.517 --> 00:14:41.297
"of the software is complete,

00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:43.337
"however the entire software package

00:14:43.337 --> 00:14:45.767
"is going through the
system safety analysis,

00:14:45.767 --> 00:14:49.430
"and then will be presented
to the FAA for approval."

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.510
Boeing said it expects
the MAX to be cleared

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:53.123
to back in the air this summer.
