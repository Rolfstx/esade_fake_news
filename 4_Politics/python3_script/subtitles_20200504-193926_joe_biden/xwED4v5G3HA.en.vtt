just talked and I feel that I'm a
stand-up<00:31:22.390><c> for</c><00:31:22.690><c> the</c><00:31:22.810><c> first</c><00:31:23.050><c> time</c><00:31:23.320><c> I</c><00:31:23.590><c> feel</c><00:31:24.580><c> that</c>

00:31:24.780 --> 00:31:24.790 align:start position:0%
stand-up for the first time I feel that
 

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:27.750 align:start position:0%
stand-up for the first time I feel that
this<00:31:25.000><c> tour</c><00:31:25.390><c> I</c><00:31:25.800><c> can</c><00:31:26.800><c> say</c><00:31:26.950><c> I'm</c><00:31:27.070><c> a</c><00:31:27.130><c> stand-up</c><00:31:27.370><c> and</c>

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
this tour I can say I'm a stand-up and
 

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
this tour I can say I'm a stand-up and
the<00:31:28.450><c> first</c><00:31:28.720><c> four</c><00:31:29.110><c> tours</c><00:31:29.470><c> I</c><00:31:30.210><c> was</c><00:31:31.210><c> in</c><00:31:31.450><c> the</c>

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:31.570 align:start position:0%
the first four tours I was in the
 

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:32.900 align:start position:0%
the first four tours I was in the
ballpark

00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:32.910 align:start position:0%
ballpark
 

00:31:32.910 --> 00:31:37.170 align:start position:0%
ballpark
so<00:31:33.910><c> I'd</c><00:31:34.150><c> say</c><00:31:34.540><c> and</c><00:31:35.340><c> here's</c><00:31:36.340><c> another</c><00:31:36.490><c> revelation</c>

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:37.180 align:start position:0%
so I'd say and here's another revelation
 

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:38.610 align:start position:0%
so I'd say and here's another revelation
that<00:31:37.330><c> shouldn't</c><00:31:37.900><c> be</c><00:31:37.960><c> a</c><00:31:37.990><c> revelation</c><00:31:38.260><c> it</c><00:31:38.470><c> should</c>

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:38.620 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be a revelation it should
 

00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
that shouldn't be a revelation it should
be<00:31:38.680><c> obvious</c><00:31:38.880><c> stage</c><00:31:39.880><c> time</c><00:31:40.270><c> is</c><00:31:40.390><c> everything</c><00:31:42.210><c> you</c>

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:43.210 align:start position:0%

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:46.360 align:start position:0%
and it can be pretty funny and they can
 

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
and it can be pretty funny and they can

laugh but if you do the stage time you
 

00:31:49.810 --> 00:31:53.550 align:start position:0%
laugh but if you do the stage time you
it's<00:31:50.380><c> it's</c><00:31:50.860><c> actually</c><00:31:51.280><c> doing</c><00:31:51.640><c> it</c><00:31:51.790><c> I</c><00:31:52.060><c> I</c><00:31:52.560><c> can't</c>

00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:53.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually doing it I I can't
 

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually doing it I I can't
