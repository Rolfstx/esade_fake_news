00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:05.040
Conan O'Brien: Thank you.

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.040
Thank you.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.040
Please remain seated.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.040
That is not necessary.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.830
[applause] [laughter] thank you, don’t stand,
that wouldn’t be right.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:19.740
Good evening, thank you, Mr. President, Mrs.
Obama, distinguished members of the press

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.470
and Bon Jovi.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.930
Yes, it is an honor to share the stage with
the President.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.410
When you think about it, the President and
I are a lot alike.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.890
We both went to Harvard, we both have two
children and we both told Joe Biden we did

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.969
not have extra tickets for tonight event.

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.829
We also have something else in common, I too
recently got in hot water for talking about

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.309
a public official’s good looks.

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.670
It was when time I would not shut up about
that stone cold fox, Secretary of Transportation

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.109
Ray Lahood.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:55.010
Oh, man.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.530
I like the cut of his jib.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.780
Bu President Obama, President Obama, you had
some great jokes.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.479
It was a pleasure watching you stand here
and do what I do.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.560
Now it is only fair that I get to do what
you do.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.049
That’s right, ladies and gentlemen, for
the next 15 minutes I will be mired in intense

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.480
dysfunctional standoff with congress.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.520
This is going to be fun.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.490
Now right away, I would like to formally congratulate
the President on his re-election.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.490
Congratulations.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.490
Thank you.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.130
As you all know, he is hard at work creating
jobs.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:37.729
Since he was first selected, the number of
popes has doubled.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.070
And the number of tonight show hosts has tripled.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.860
Congratulations.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.079
And while I’m at it, I would like to congratulate
President George W. Bush on big dedication

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.090
of his Presidential library.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.609
Yes, the library has millions of books, articles,
and documents and if you go, you can be the

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:05.210
first to read them.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.990
You can’t hurt me.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.340
Ladies and gentlemen, let’s get going.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.420
Right here at the start I am going to share
something with you people and it does not

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:14.860
leave this room.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.560
I say this with absolute confidence, because
we are on C- Span.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.300
Who doesn’t love C-SPAN, seriously?

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.300
C-SPAN.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.180
It’s an entire channel shot the backup Camera
on a Ford Explorer.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.130
Congratulations to C-SPAN for winning the
bid to broadcast this event.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.630
They narrowly beat out HD TV two, TVC South
America and the Hilton Hotel how to check

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.040
out channel.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.400
That’s right, the Hilton.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.750
It is great to be here at the Hilton.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.920
Is it just me or is it time to stop using
Priceline to book this event?

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.920
No, I really love the Hilton.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.960
I love their motto, sorry the Radisson was
booked.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.590
I was worried that because of the sequester
we would be forced to hold this event at a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.380
less prestigious hotel then the dc Hilton.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.650
Then I was told that was not possible.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.290
I do want to thank the Hilton for accommodating
us.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.630
They were kind enough to reschedule a cash
for gold seminar.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.430
By the way, for those of you here for the
cash for gold seminar, that has been moved

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.850
to salon ‘B’ on the mezzanine.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:37.210
And if Joe Biden asks, there are no extra
tickets for that, either.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.350
Quick announcement, before we really get going,
before we continue, if any of you are live

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:46.850
tweeting this event, please use the #incapable
oflivinginthemoment.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.110
[laughter] yeah.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.740
Yeah.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.000
Yes, Yes.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.660
Also, to any U.S. Senators here tonight, if
you would like to switch your dessert or your

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.320
position on gay marriage, please signal a
waiter.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.450
By the way Speaking of dinner, tonight entrees
were halibut, and filet mignon.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:20.120
Or as CNN reported, lasagna and couscous.

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.090
There is a gavel here, and I don’t know
why.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.120
[gavel pounds]

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.230
Here is a fun fact about tonight’s food,
everything you it was personally shot by Wayne

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.230
Lapierre.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.000
Don’t worry it was during a home invasion.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.590
The fish came in through the window.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.940
It wasn’t peppercorn, it was buckshot, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.870
Incidentally, you may not know this, but Wayne
Lapierre is merely the executive Vice President

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.620
of the NRA.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.910
Which begs the question, how freaking crazy
do you have to be to be the actual President

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.240
of the NRA?

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.750
He is not even at the top.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.370
Also, I would like to acknowledge that earlier
this evening there was some confusion with

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.840
the seating chart.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.100
For a moment, someone accidentally sat governor
Chris Christie with the Republicans.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.460
That was awkward, and I apologize.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.930
Very awkward.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.740
But speaking of tables, before dinner, I had
a chance to mingle, you probably saw me.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.840
I worked the crowd, shook some hands and sold
my twitter account to Al Jazeera for $500

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.840
million.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.550
They will buy anything.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:42.000
(ah ha ha ha ha ha)

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.900
It is an absolute joy to be her at the White
House correspondents dinner.

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.700
Last year, Tom Brokaw criticized this event
for having too many superstars and A-list

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:51.890
celebrities.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:59.110
When I told him I would be attending this
year, he said, that’s more like it.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.840
That should not be funny to you.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.780
But this is really a star- studded event.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.790
this year, you have taken it to new heights.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.970
I have to congratulate you.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:08.150
New heights!

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:16.370
Because you have some of the guy from duck
dynasty is here – duck dynasty.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.440
Which can only mean one thing, the guys from
storage wars said no.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.370
I love duck dynasty, don’t get me wrong.

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:29.840
I really don’t think the whistle — all
my god, it works.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.840
It’s incredible.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.139
He is here.

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:34.840
I always hated that one.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.920
As some of you know, this is my second time
speaking at this event.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:45.720
I was 18 years ago in 1995, a lot has changed
since then.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.410
Today you can get real-time information on
world events from something small enough to

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.840
fit in the palm of your hand.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.730
Back in 1995, we called that George Stephanopoulos.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:02.830
I can see if George is here because there
is a crouton in the way.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:11.590
It is amazing to think how much our country
has changed in 18 years.

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:12.590
Think about it.

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:18.790
If in 1995 you told me that in 2013, we would
have an African- American President with a

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:25.389
middle name Hussein, who was just reelected
to a second term in a sluggish economy, I

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:35.330
would have said, oh, he must have run against
Mitt Romney.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:39.620
By the way, no offense, Mr. President, I do
congratulate you on your victory, but as a

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:43.910
late-night comedian, I was kind of pulling
for the rich guy who’s horse danced in the

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:52.820
Olympics.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.240
The demographics of this country have been
rapidly changing over the past two decades.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.380
I look forward to hosting this event 18 years
from now.

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:09.520
Then, my opening line will be, [speaking spanish]
Si.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:17.139
Especialmente, Presidente Mario Lopez.

00:08:17.139 --> 00:08:22.270
But, my prior experience has taught me how
these dinners work.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.490
If the President laughs, everyone laughs.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:31.800
If the Fox News table laughs, a little girl
just fell off her bike.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:38.849
How are you doing, Bill?

00:08:38.849 --> 00:08:43.819
Yes, all the Washington news media are here
tonight, including the stars of online journalism.

00:08:43.819 --> 00:08:47.070
I did the Huffington post has a table.

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:53.120
Which has me wondering, if you are here, who
is covering Miley Cyrus’s latest nip slip?

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:58.870
Who is assembling today’s top 25 yogurt
related tweets?

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:03.559
Seven mistakes your making with bacon, and
that’s a real one, and you should be ashamed

00:09:03.559 --> 00:09:10.050
our yourselves.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:13.601
By the way, just before dinner, I tried to
say a quick hello to Arianna Huffington, but

00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:17.060
she made me watch a 32 second ad first.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.290
— 30-second ad first.

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:26.550
Yes, a lot of online stars in the room, but
unfortunately Matt Drudge couldn’t make

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:27.550
it.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:32.029
Ya, he had a prior commitment to teach a web
design class in 1997.

00:09:32.029 --> 00:09:37.959
Of course, the Washington print media is also
joining us this evening.

00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:40.850
The print media are here for two very good
reasons.

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:42.910
food and shelter.

00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:54.740
You know, how are you, you know, some people
say print media is dying, but I don’t believe

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:55.740
it.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.490
Neither does my blacksmith.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:06.760
You have got to meet Zachariah, he is great.

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:12.850
Man, rough year for Newsweek, which after
80 years published its last print issue.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.089
Yeah.

00:10:14.089 --> 00:10:17.980
Time magazine might be gloating, but they
really shouldn’t, because Time will outlive

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:22.430
Newsweek a way Juliett outlived Romeo.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.319
Read the play, it is very smart.

00:10:25.319 --> 00:10:31.480
Things are so tough for old media, Reuters
– (this is a true story) Reuters is having

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.569
its after party right here at the Hilton.

00:10:34.569 --> 00:10:38.629
Because nothing says we are having a great
here like having your after party at the same

00:10:38.629 --> 00:10:42.910
table where you just had dinner.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:46.050
With that in mind, Reuters is asking everyone
here to leave a little wine at the bottom

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.980
of the glass.

00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:57.709
And to be fair, print media still has a big
star in Bob Woodward.

00:10:57.709 --> 00:11:00.990
Got to give it up for Bob
Woodward.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:06.139
[applause] Earlier this evening, a waiter
asked him if he wanted regular or decaf and

00:11:06.139 --> 00:11:13.860
he said, Stop threatening me!

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.860
Also tonight, some big names in television
news.

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:19.759
When it comes to television news, we have
a divided landscape.

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:26.029
Fox news is watched by conservatives, MSNBC
watched by liberals and CNN is watched by

00:11:26.029 --> 00:11:34.129
people who clean the offices at CNN. [laughter]
[oohs] Oh, it gets worst.

00:11:34.129 --> 00:11:40.839
CNN’s ratings are so low, now when it comes
up, James Earl Jones says, you are watching

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:42.209
CNN?

00:11:42.209 --> 00:11:44.329
what the hell?

00:11:44.329 --> 00:11:50.889
I have to say, in the past two years, CNN
has made some odd moves.

00:11:50.889 --> 00:11:56.069
It replaced the — popular Larry King with
one of the scheming footman from “Downton

00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:57.069
Abbey.”

00:11:57.069 --> 00:12:09.449
it is good to 
see my old friends at MSNBC.

00:12:09.449 --> 00:12:11.499
Chris Matthews is here.

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:15.279
Chris Matthews has the only show where the
commercial exists just so they can wipe the

00:12:15.279 --> 00:12:19.949
spittle off the lens.

00:12:19.949 --> 00:12:24.269
By the way, during the Boston
coverage on MSNBC last week, Chuck Todd stopped

00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:27.540
a pundit from speculating on on fire side
— unverified information.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:29.360
There is no joke here.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:35.970
I’m just letting the people at CNN know
that you can do that.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.230
This is a learning experience.

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:41.300
Hello to Fox news star Bill O’Reilly, Bill
has become quite the author.

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:45.589
He’s had two recent bestsellers, ” Killing
Kennedy” and “killing Lincoln.”

00:12:45.589 --> 00:12:49.929
He also wrote a book that wasn’t as nearly
as popular – the Natural Peaceful Death

00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:51.610
of Taft.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:56.540
What were you thinking.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:12:59.949
The truth is Bill O’Reilly (and this is
true) is now working on his next book, due

00:12:59.949 --> 00:13:03.589
out this fall, this time about the killing
of Jesus.

00:13:03.589 --> 00:13:10.550
It will be the first time in history Jesus’s
death is blamed on Obamacare.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:13.889
Two quick shout outs to PBS and NPR.

00:13:13.889 --> 00:13:17.829
PBS — yes! [applause] Those people love
to party.

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:24.850
Guys if you get lucky tonight – Be safe,
where a tote bag.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:25.850
It works.

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.429
You have got to love NPR.

00:13:28.429 --> 00:13:33.009
Still the number one source for news delivered
as if there is a toddler sleeping in the next

00:13:33.009 --> 00:13:36.499
room.

00:13:36.499 --> 00:13:39.999
Shh!

00:13:39.999 --> 00:13:41.199
NBC NEWS is in the house.

00:13:41.199 --> 00:13:43.730
They have had a rough go of it.

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:46.509
The Today Show let go of Ann Curry.

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:52.100
After being told that an curry said, how broker
tells the world that he crafted answer the

00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.560
White House and I am getting fired?

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.970
Al is the reason there are no more tours of
the White House, they’re still hosing it

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:05.050
down.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.050
Brian Williams is here.

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.420
Brian – I am a big fan of your show.

00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:12.029
Rock Center with Brian Williams – If you
haven’t seen it, imagine brand delivering

00:14:12.029 --> 00:14:18.509
the evening news on a different floor of the
building, a little later, with a slightly

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:19.670
different tie.

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.700
It is a mind blower.

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.649
You gotta check it out.

00:14:22.649 --> 00:14:28.569
As I look all around the room, I see all the
media here tonight, I realize this is one

00:14:28.569 --> 00:14:29.860
big high school cafeteria.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.049
That is all it is.

00:14:32.049 --> 00:14:33.049
Think about it.

00:14:33.049 --> 00:14:34.610
Fox is the jocks.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:36.649
MSNBC is the nerds.

00:14:36.649 --> 00:14:38.689
Bloggers are the Goths.

00:14:38.689 --> 00:14:47.439
NPR is the table for kids with peanut allergies.

00:14:47.439 --> 00:14:59.089
[laughter] Al Jazeera is the weird foreign-
exchange student nobody talks to.

00:14:59.089 --> 00:15:04.680
And print media, you are the poor kid who
died sophomore year in a car crash.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:09.220
Ya, cheer up, we dedicate the yearbook to
you.

00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:14.889
Of course, probably the biggest or that people
covered this past year was the Republicans

00:15:14.889 --> 00:15:17.480
failure to recapture the White House.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.850
Hard to believe they did not fare better with
this port of celebrities like Ted Nugent and

00:15:22.850 --> 00:15:24.240
Meatloaf.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:34.199
They underestimated the number of voters who
still drive carpeted vans.

00:15:34.199 --> 00:15:40.180
The republican party’s on the mend.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:44.239
One rising star on the right is Senator Marco
Rubio.

00:15:44.239 --> 00:15:49.779
Or as he is known in the republican party,
our black guy.

00:15:49.779 --> 00:15:52.699
Ya.

00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:57.600
By the way, as of today come in the U.S. Senate
has a record number of African- american senators.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.649
Two.

00:15:58.649 --> 00:15:59.709
Two.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:09.480
In other words, there are now more African-Americans
in the senate and in a Mumford and Sons concert.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:10.480
Thank you, younger people.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.250
Paul Ryan — I don’t understand!

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:18.730
What’s he babbling about?

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:25.839
Who is this man?

00:16:25.839 --> 00:16:29.989
Paul Ryan recently — he really burst through
when he ran or Vice President.

00:16:29.989 --> 00:16:33.819
After the election, Ryan said President Obama
was reelected because of the high turnout

00:16:33.819 --> 00:16:35.059
of urban voters.

00:16:35.059 --> 00:16:43.110
When he was asked how he liked his coffee
he said, no milk, no sugar, just urban.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:57.619
Well there is RNC chairman writes previous
— Reince Priebus.

00:16:57.619 --> 00:17:03.209
Tonight he is sitting between his brothers
lather and repeat.

00:17:03.209 --> 00:17:10.429
House majority leader Eric Cantor is here.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:20.139
Or as I like to refer to him, yet another
Jewish Republican from the south — Get sold.

00:17:20.139 --> 00:17:26.120
That also reminds me also joining us a Congressman
from New York named Steve Israel.

00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:29.490
He is from New York and his name is Israel.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:33.480
Now, there is pandering, and then there is
pandering.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:38.890
That is like having a Congressman from South
Carolina named Jesus H.Gun – my name is

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.390
Jesus – Jesus H. Gun.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:55.080
You’ve got to use this thing, it is fantastic.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.320
[Gavel Pounds]

00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:00.980
I mentioned Chris Christie earlier, governor
Christie and Shaquille O’neal are sitting

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.659
at the same dinner table.

00:18:02.659 --> 00:18:10.169
So, let’s give it up for the real unsung
hero tonight, their waiter.

00:18:10.169 --> 00:18:15.120
That poor bastard is gonna lose an arm.

00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:21.140
And I believe we have one or two supreme court
justices here.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:24.000
The supreme court seems divided over same-sex
marriage.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.540
The liberal justices favorite it while the
conservatives oppose any life long union between

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:34.919
two men, unless it is Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas.

00:18:34.919 --> 00:18:39.710
What the hell was that?

00:18:39.710 --> 00:18:44.330
There’s no surprise, Speaker John Boehner
is not here tonight.

00:18:44.330 --> 00:18:48.600
Speaker banner and President Obama are still
struggling to get along.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.880
President Obama and John Boehner, are kind
of like a blind date between Anderson Cooper

00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.519
and Rachel Maddow.

00:18:54.519 --> 00:18:57.980
In theory, they understand each other’s
positions, but deep

00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:03.870
down, you know nothing’s ever gonna happen.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:20.460
[Gavel Pounds] [Gavel Pounds] Speaking of
nothing happening, we are all hoping of course

00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.289
that nothing happens with North Korea.

00:19:23.289 --> 00:19:26.789
And that got me wondering, what is with Kim
Jong-un?

00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:32.360
In the past, we have had really scary enemies
like Saddam Hussain and Hitler.

00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.059
Now, suddenly our nemesis is a pouty teenage
boy who dresses like Rosie O’donnell at

00:19:37.059 --> 00:19:41.230
the Emmys.

00:19:41.230 --> 00:19:45.700
Kim Jong-un does not understand that we aren’t
afraid of him.

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:49.480
What that guy doesn’t get is
that we already have an unstable peninsula

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.570
that will ultimately bring down america.

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:55.169
It is called Florida.

00:19:55.169 --> 00:19:57.409
Yes it is.

00:19:57.409 --> 00:20:01.269
Yes, President Obama has a lot on his plate
right now.

00:20:01.269 --> 00:20:07.019
But he is at the very nice stage where there
are no more secrets left to come out about

00:20:07.019 --> 00:20:08.019
him.

00:20:08.019 --> 00:20:12.259
We all know that he lived in Indonesia as
a child, studied at a Muslim seminary and

00:20:12.259 --> 00:20:16.549
occasionally ate dog.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:22.170
From the beginning, a kid who had his eyes
set on the U.S. Presidency.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:24.159
Check, and check.

00:20:24.159 --> 00:20:26.080
Here I come.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:32.280
I know the relationship between the President
and the press can seem a bit strained at times.

00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.809
Some in this room have accused him of being
distant and aloof.

00:20:36.809 --> 00:20:44.190
When I asked the President about it earlier,
he said, oh, and then walked away.

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:51.289
Of course it is only natural, but Mr. President
election was less exciting than the first

00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:52.289
time around in 2008.

00:20:52.289 --> 00:20:56.539
An election night on 2008, you celebrated
with hundreds of thousands of people in Chicago’s

00:20:56.539 --> 00:20:57.539
Grant park.

00:20:57.539 --> 00:20:58.539
It was fascinating.

00:20:58.539 --> 00:21:03.679
This time around, you split the Char-dog with
David Axelrod at the wiener circle.

00:21:03.679 --> 00:21:05.860
It just did not have the same buzz.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:06.980
And by the way I have a question.

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:08.929
And I think some of you also have this question.

00:21:08.929 --> 00:21:13.990
It has been several months since you were
reelected, so I am curious, why are you still

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:17.600
sending everyone five e-mails a day asking
for more money?

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.600
You won.

00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:25.059
Do you have a gambling problem we don’t
know about?

00:21:25.059 --> 00:21:29.650
Did you put it all on Gonzaga?

00:21:29.650 --> 00:21:33.260
You did, didn’t you?

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:35.070
He did.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.880
[gavel pounds]

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:39.410
President Obama has already made a lot of
changes in his second term.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.460
You recently, Sir, you recently appointed
John Kerry and Chuck Hagel.

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.460
Very smart moves.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.280
You appointed the only two people in the United
States who look even more tired than you.

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.240
A great strategy.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.300
Mr. President, you will leave office as a
very young man.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:58.139
And yet the Presidency has taken it’s toll.

00:21:58.139 --> 00:22:01.909
I don’t want to alarm you sir, but you are
starting to look like a judge on “Law and

00:22:01.909 --> 00:22:02.909
Order.”

00:22:02.909 --> 00:22:06.610
Just say, you are on thin ice, counselor.

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:07.830
You could have that part right away.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:16.260
Seriously, Mr. President, your hair is so
white, it could be a member of your cabinet.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.350
He can handle it.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:21.429
Speaking of the Cabinent, the President, he
recently picked the new treasury secretary,

00:22:21.429 --> 00:22:22.850
Jack Lew.

00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:31.990
If the President ever has to let him go, he
can say, it is not Lew, it’s me.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.759
But the quote a city must but the President
is that he is always the coolest guy in the

00:22:35.759 --> 00:22:36.759
room.

00:22:36.759 --> 00:22:37.929
That is what everyone says.

00:22:37.929 --> 00:22:39.659
He is the coolest guy in the room.

00:22:39.659 --> 00:22:40.970
Here is my question.

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:42.789
Who else is in that room?

00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:47.460
It is not hard to be the cool one when the
other guys in the room are Biden, Hagel, and

00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.870
Kerry.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:53.370
I would be cool to if I was in a room where
Tom Vilsack is showing Steven Chu how to do

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.940
the Harlem Shake.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:23:02.669
Now, I have made some jokes about the President
this evening.

00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:05.029
Now, I am looking forward to my audit.

00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:08.380
President Obama:
It’s coming.

00:23:08.380 --> 00:23:12.590
Conan O'Brien:
It is coming.

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:13.590
I know, sir, It’s coming.

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:17.909
But, I would like to take a moment here and
change gears and say some into the President.

00:23:17.909 --> 00:23:20.950
Regarding the events of the past two weeks.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:21.950
Some of you may not know this.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:24.010
I grew up in Boston.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.370
My parents still live there.

00:23:25.370 --> 00:23:28.450
My brother, Luke, raised his family in Watertown.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:34.890
I would like to take this opportunity to thank,
you Mr. President, for visiting that great

00:23:34.890 --> 00:23:38.970
city and helping its people begin to heal
with your inspiring words.

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:45.240
It’s made a huge difference.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:50.630
It has been said recently that you don’t
mess with Boston.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.539
As someone who grew up there, I would like
to echo that sentiment.

00:23:53.539 --> 00:23:55.030
It is really pretty simple.

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:59.639
If you’re going to pick on a city, don’t
choose one where nine out of 10 people are

00:23:59.639 --> 00:24:01.210
related to a cop.

00:24:01.210 --> 00:24:03.809
Don’t do it.

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:05.549
It’s stupid.

00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:08.299
And that includes myself.

00:24:08.299 --> 00:24:11.020
I have one more thing to mention before I
go.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:12.720
Everyone is obsessed with Washington these
days.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:19.040
You all saw how you went crazy for “house
of cards” “homeland”, Hollywood can’t

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:21.409
get enough of your world.

00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:26.860
Well, tonight, I’m excited to announce that
they are going to make a television miniseries

00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:30.500
about the power players here in Washington.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:36.360
They just finished the casting, and I would
like to announce who is going to play who.

00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:37.360
This is big.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:49.080
Vice President Joe Biden is going to be played
by Bob Barker.

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:58.289
Former White House adviser David Axelrod will
be played by Higgins from Magnum P.I.

00:24:58.289 --> 00:25:01.280
This was also produced by Steven Spielberg,
by the way.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:12.870
Representative Paul Ryan will be played by
Mr. Bean.

00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:23.980
Senator Chuck Schumer will be played by Grandpa
Munster.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:32.940
Senator Harry Reid will be played by the old
man from the American Gothic painting.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:40.889
Fox news Ceo Roger Ailes will be played by
Boss Hog, we signed the deal.

00:25:40.889 --> 00:25:51.049
Speaker of the House John Banner will be played
by TAN-MOM.

00:25:51.049 --> 00:26:05.510
Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano
will be played by Paul Giamatti.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:11.159
Former White House Chief of Staff and Chicago
Mayor Rahm Emanuel will be played by Stewie

00:26:11.159 --> 00:26:18.809
