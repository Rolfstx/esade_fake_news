00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:15.920
We named our fourth child Kayla Chaya after
Chaya Holtzberg.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.460
We feel very fortunate that we were able to
discover this story about our family and our

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.460
heritage.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.300
Let me tell you a little bit about my father
because that basically will explain a little

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.000
bit, I think, the background of this whole
story.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.860
My father was a very quiet man.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.310
He didn't tell me anything about the Holocaust.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.650
They didn't want to talk about it.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.780
We didn't want to necessarily ask too many
questions.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.309
When I was about 10-, 12-years-old, my father
bought himself a gold watch.

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.229
When my father passed away, my mother gave
me the watch.

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:58.260
When I opened it there was a small warranty
booklet inside the case.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.720
And as we open up the folds of this warranty,
something falls down.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.780
It flutters to the ground.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.030
So I bent down to pick it up, and it's a postage
stamp picture of 2 women.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.550
I was absolutely shocked.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.439
I have never seen this photograph before.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.649
I showed it to my mother, she wasn't sure
what it was.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.130
I showed it to some of my relatives, again,
couldn't really get information about it.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.090
But it seemed clear to me that my father wanted
me to have this photograph.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.570
I then found out that Yad Vashem has uploaded
the database

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.289
with the memorial documents and I decided,
well, let me take a look, maybe I'll find

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.240
something about my father.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:54.299
So I put in my father's name, and I found
2 documents which actually shocked me.

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.179
The first one is with my father's handwriting

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:06.259
and basically he documents there the fact
that he had a wife and 2 children.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.550
And in addition to the name Chaya Goldberg,
I found in parentheses her maiden name, Holtzberg,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.550
and at that point I remembered that my father
had relatives by the name of Holtzberg.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.940
Perhaps they will know who she was.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.430
And we got in touch with the Holtzbergs who
Tzachi had found out were living in Queens.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.180
We invited them to our house.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.360
We had a family meal.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.340
We had all of our children there.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.030
All of our grandchildren.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.950
This is the watch that he left for me, right…

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:45.570
And inside the watch, was 
this picture.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.570
And he says, 'yes of course.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.260
This is my sister.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.280
She was married to your father.'

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.870
And we said, wow!

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.670
And then he gave us some additional information
about their lives.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.040
They had 2 daughters.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.390
One of them was about 6 or 7-years-old, and
the other one was a newborn.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.870
And they were apparently hiding when the Germans
came in.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.110
And obviously they were very worried about
the baby crying

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:22.150
and somebody covered her mouth, and after
the Germans left they realized that the baby

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.150
died.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.140
The mother, with her own bare hands dug a
grave for her newborn baby

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.050
and buried her in an unmarked grave.

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.480
A couple of months later my father was taken
to a labor camp

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:51.840
and Chaya Goldberg and her daughter were gassed
in Majdanek.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.070
The work that Yad Vashem does in maintaining
this database, making it available…look

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.450
I would have never found out about that part
of my family history.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.870
And it is such an important component of what
we are.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.320
What Yad Vashem is doing is absolutely critical.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.390
To the history of our people, to the future
of our people…

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:18.949
And when you to a place like Yad Vashem, and
you encounter the artifacts, and the archives,

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:19.949
and these stories

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.510
and these untold stories, there are so many
more stories.

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.090
It's an opportunity to really understand more.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.250
And as we understand more about our past we
understand more about our future.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.250
What our role is.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.610
How we must live our lives in light of what
has happened.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.980
I asked my father when she was born, I told
him, 'you know

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.750
I'm going to name this child after Chaya Holtzberg.'

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.460
In true fashion my father said, 'you do what
you need to do.'

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.410
But I know that when I named her Chaya, he
was very very thankful.
