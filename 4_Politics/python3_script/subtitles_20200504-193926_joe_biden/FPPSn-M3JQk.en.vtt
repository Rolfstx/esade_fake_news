00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.530
Returns are a major headache for
customers, and they drain companies of

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.620
millions of dollars in unwanted
inventory and extra labor.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.460
Returns create billions of pounds of waste
and entire walls of shame in

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.810
warehouses around the world.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.140
But Amazon is trying to
change all of that.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.390
Where Amazon absolutely leads is in trying
to be the easiest, the lowest

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.840
friction return experience for the
consumer and thereby win customer

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.800
loyalty and increase customer purchases while
they tackle some of these

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.730
other big institutional infrastructure
problems around returns.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.330
From robots to in-person returns, the
world's most valuable company is

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.040
redefining the returns process.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.790
And as e-commerce grows, smaller companies
are finding ways to make money

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.630
off returns. We wanted to find
out how does Amazon process returns?

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.570
And what's the company doing to
protect the environment and its bottom

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:57.500
line? Returns are by far
the largest challenge to

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.660
e-commerce, and I think to commerce
in general for both retailers and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:07.760
manufacturers. As more consumer spending
is shifting from in-store to

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.680
online, it's really just exacerbating the
size of the returns problem that

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.600
we all have to deal with. Across
the entire Amazon marketplace, you know,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.200
they now sell over
800 million products.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.190
So this is a scale that the world
has never had to deal with before.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.730
There's even an annual conference devoted
entirely to solving the problem

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.840
created by returns, namely inefficient reverse
logistics is a huge loss

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.960
for companies,. In a traditional brick
and mortar store we might have

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.450
average return rates of 8 to 10 %.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.610
But in e-commerce, it's totally common to see
20 or 30 % of all purchases

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.530
get returned. Forrester Research estimates
that e-commerce will see $207

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.570
billion worth of returns this year.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.000
Amazon is about half of all e-commerce,
so slightly more than $100 billion

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.100
dollars in returns happen in
North America just with Amazon.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.420
So that's a huge expense.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.780
And the returns process
matters to customers.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.340
According to data compiled by Invesp,
79% of consumers want free return

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.720
shipping and 67% check the returns
page before making an online purchase.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.020
All this has led to the current
trend of free return shipping, which is

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.120
now offered by almost
half of retailers.

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.330
Where the challenges is, is can you do
it in a way where the unit

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.620
economics don't kill you?

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.730
The difference with Amazon is they
have the scale and they've trained

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.650
their investors to accept that in the
beginning they may do things at a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.880
loss. What that gives them the flexibility
to do then is to invent.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.660
They bring a lot of talent to the
table and they figure out how to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.920
optimize and create efficiencies that will
allow them to have the unit

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.550
economics work to their favor and
ultimately get those margins back.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.510
The complicated reverse logistics journey starts
when you decide to return

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.020
an item. Amazon gives you 30 days from
the day you receive an item to

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.370
bring it back or put it in the mail.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:56.960
Generally you get 30 days.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.680
And generally they give your money
back and even include paying for

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.090
shipping both ways, right?

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.880
Which has inspired other companies
to have to follow suit.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.280
And with every return, Amazon
wants to know why.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.220
34 % say the size,
fit or color was wrong.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.030
21 % say the item was
damaged, broken or no longer functional.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.850
14 % say the item wasn't as described, 10
% simply didn't like it and 9 %

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.440
changed their minds. Amazon sees on
their scoring system that you're a

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.120
customer that abuses
the return policy.

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.850
It is possible that they'll charge
you a fee for that out-of-reason

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.840
return, whereas for a good customer
they might continue to offer that

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.650
return for free. Whether a return is
free also depends on the method you

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.010
choose for that return. That menu is
going to vary slightly depending on

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.570
your geography and the item.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.200
A popular thing that they'll do is you
put it back in the box, you seal

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.260
the box and we'll send someone to your
house to pick up the box and

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.080
they're going to charge
you for that option.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.590
If you live in a place where
there's literally no other options, they may

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.610
offer that for free.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.200
But in most cases, they're going to say,
if you bring it to a UPS store,

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.700
it's free. But for certain items
where the reverse logistics costs way

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.330
outweigh the potential value of the
item, if you're not someone that

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.900
they've identified as a return abuser, they
very likely are going to tell

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.090
you to just not
worry about the return.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.050
The returns process is now so easy
that customers have been caught gaming

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:26.660
the system. One man reportedly scammed
Amazon out of $370,000 by sending

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.200
back boxes of properly weighted dirt
instead of the returned products.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.370
Amazon has also banned customers who appear
to be conning the system by

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.250
making too many returns.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.650
In all, return fraud cost to the
retail industry $18 billion in 2017.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.220
You have a secret credit score that
says how profitable and how good a

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.280
customer you are for that retailer.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.810
A particularly egregious and common version
of this is there's a huge

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.190
spike in TV sales the week before the
Super Bowl, and there's a huge spike

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.910
in TV returns the week
after the Super Bowl, right?

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.920
So increasingly your own behavior can
impact the returns experience that

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.520
you get. But even those items that
are legitimate returns can create a lot

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.450
of pressure, specifically
on Amazon workers.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.490
For every package you return from
your doorstep, there's a delivery driver

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.130
who has to pick it up and get
it started on that journey back to the

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.670
warehouse. It's those boots on the
ground that cost Amazon the most.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.040
As more of Amazon's overall volume gets
shifted from UPS and the U.S.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.650
Post Office to Amazon's own delivery
network, they're also able to handle

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.450
a lot more of the returns
themselves and the logistics of picking

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.940
something up at someone's house and
taking it back to the fulfillment

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.840
center are actually harder and more
expensive than the logistics of

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.100
delivering something to the home.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.580
Amazon has one big way to relieve
the pressure on its drivers and its

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.680
bottom line: use you
for the delivery.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:58.000
In July, Amazon expanded its partnership with
Kohl's to allow items to be

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.930
returned without a box at any
of Kohl's 1,100 stores for free.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:06.490
If they have to go to 100
hundred consumers' houses and collect one box

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.030
for a return, that's much more
expensive than having those hundred

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.490
consumers all go to one Kohl's.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:14.900
Kohl's needs traffic. Retail
traffic is down.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.690
You've got to find a way
to get people in the stores.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.410
They're now getting the Amazon customer
into their store who then has

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.300
money in their pocket after a return.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.570
It's a great opportunity.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.290
So far, Kohl's says
results are promising.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.180
The net impact of the traffic and
sales we're getting and then considering

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.580
the support that we're leveraging.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.170
So in terms of the support inside
of our stores, reverse logistics, all of

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:43.330
that is expected to be a
positive EBIT contribution for 2019.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:48.940
So we're early days, but we're highly encouraged
and we do see this as a

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:50.770
profitable venture for the company.

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:54.640
If the cost of me handling the return,
which by the way they're going to

00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.280
help pay for, is lower than getting
another pair of shoes sold to the

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.460
person walking in, then it's
ultimately a net gain.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.360
In the world of Amazon partnerships, this
Kohl's deal is almost unique in

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.300
how favorable it is for both parties.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.050
According to data compiled by Invesp, 62
% of customers are more likely to

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.270
shop online if they can
return an item in store.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.140
With Amazon, you can also return items in
person without a box to one of

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.370
2,800 Amazon Hub locker locations, which can
often be found at Whole Foods

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.480
or college campuses.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:29.800
Depending on your location, you can also
return items in person at UPS

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.690
stores and a growing number of
Amazon Books and Amazon 4-star stores,

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.870
although this does sometimes
cost a fee.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:39.130
Other retailers are trying to catch
up with Amazon's in-store return

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.610
options. Walmart has actually created a
separate return line so that you

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:46.330
don't have to wait in line behind
other people trying to get Walmart

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:50.470
service. Target has set up dedicated e-commerce
space in the front of the

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:51.580
store.

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:53.800
at Nordstrom's Local stores in
New York and L.A.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:57.460
you can now return items purchased
online from other retailers like Macy's

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:01.750
and Kohl's. And FedEx announced this month
that consumers can now drop off

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.170
their online returns at thousands of
Walgreens stores and print their

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.620
return labels in store too.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.690
UPS also unveiled a similar
partnership this month, allowing pre-labeled

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:13.390
returns at 1,100 Michaels
stores in the U.S.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.800
Amazon and everybody else is constantly
trying to enhance that user

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.110
experience and figure out how
do you best do that?

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:22.300
But you still have
the reverse shipping.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.920
You have to pay for
that shipping to go back.

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.260
You have to deal
with the item itself.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:27.310
How do you file it away?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:30.160
How do you deal with it?
This creates another big challenge.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.210
The reality is it often ends up in
a place of limbo, a place that some

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:35.860
retailers call the wall of shame.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.940
Sometimes we've seen it as high as like,
you know, 50, 60 ,000 square feet

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.130
of just all items that are just
all returns, all mistakes, all the stuff

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.470
in there. And we're talking
about thousands of items.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.110
We sometimes talk about millions of
dollars in inventory that is just

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:53.890
sitting there and it's just costing them too
much to try to fix that issue

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:55.300
that they just push it aside.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:58.270
That's what happens. It's at the
wall of shame where L.A.-based

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:01.360
startup inVia says its 400
robots deployed in U.S.

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.190
warehouses are making
a big difference.

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.960
The robots can be programmed to process
returns in a way that's custom to

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.230
the needs of a company. Customers would
approach us and say, what can you

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.820
do to just fix my wall of shame?

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.270
That's what we want the most.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.750
So with our robots, as the items come
back we're actually able to go in

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:24.440
and file them away so we're taking
away that pain point of moving the

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.060
items back. InVia is now programming
its robots with separate software

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.620
entirely devoted to returns.

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:33.040
For example, after Christmas, there might
be a lot of Christmas returns,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.980
which nobody's probably going to
order til next year.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.870
And we'll go file it
away pretty far away.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.170
These robots are meant to offer
competitors an alternative to Amazon's

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:45.190
Kiva robots, which were used by stores
like Walgreens, Staples and The Gap

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.170
before Amazon bought Kiva in 2012.

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:51.520
A major difference: inVia's robots can handle
small totes up to 40 pounds,

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.510
often carrying one individual item,
while Amazon's robots move entire

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:57.400
1000-pound shelves all at once.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:02.050
InVia says this more finite control helps
cut down on one big reason for

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.530
returns: the warehouse worker accidentally
boxing the wrong item.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.040
We only present the
person with one item.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.310
If you look at the Kiva case, you have
a big rack with a bunch of items.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:15.400
There's a guided pointer that points you
but you can still make a mistake.

00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.800
You know, you're trying to
move these things in seconds.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.800
So with our robots, we only
present them with one choice.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.920
So there's a very, very low
probability that they'll make a mistake.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:28.060
Amazon says its Kiva robots are not
used in areas that handle returns.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.720
InVia wouldn't disclose if it's been
approached by Amazon about acquiring

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:35.590
its robotic return software but did confirm
it's been in talks with a lot

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:36.790
of Amazon's competitors.

00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:39.970
So far inVia's robots are
being used in Rakuten's U.S.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:43.750
warehouses and smaller companies like
discount e-commerce retailer Hollar.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:48.910
Once returned items are sorted by human or
robot, it can still be a major

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:50.910
problem to find the best use or them.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:54.690
This can lead to a huge surplus
of inventory, wasted fuel emissions and

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.400
unnecessary packaging to handle it.

00:10:56.730 --> 00:10:58.860
In a nutshell, returns are
hard on the planet.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:06.720
As much as five billion pounds of waste
gets thrown away as a result of

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:10.320
these returns that can't be resold.

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:16.590
So to put that in perspective, that's
250,000 garbage trucks full of goods

00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:21.180
that people bought, half of which from
Amazon, and then ultimately had to

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:23.090
be thrown away because
it couldn't be resold.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:26.700
The environmentally unfriendly disposal of
unsold and returned inventory

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.940
has made big news. Burberry famously
revealed last year that it

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:31.590
incinerated 28.6

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:35.050
million pounds of unsold and returned
products, a practice it's since

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:39.030
stopped. Earlier this year it was
reported that a single Amazon facility

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:43.080
sent 293,000 products to a garbage
dump in just nine months.

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:47.370
And after a documentary found Amazon
destroyed three million products in

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.700
France last year, the country vowed
to outlaw the destruction of unsold

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.500
consumer products by 2023.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.140
That, of course, is
an ecological disaster.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:59.340
What's super interesting, of course,
is consumers are increasingly

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:00.740
sensitive to that.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:06.150
Even when destroying the product is
the best economic option, retailers

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:10.020
are having to pivot away from
that because consumers don't like doing

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:12.900
business with these
ecologically unfriendly companies.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.110
In response, Amazon launched a
program called Fulfilled by Amazon

00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:20.580
Donations. Starting September 1st, donations
became the default option for

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:23.670
all sellers when they choose how to
dispose of their unsold or unwanted

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:26.070
products stored in Amazon
warehouses in the U.S.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:31.470
and the U.K. And that's entirely
a result of customer sentiment pivoting

00:12:31.470 --> 00:12:33.120
away from Amazon.

00:12:33.450 --> 00:12:37.560
According to Narvar's 2019 consumer report,
52 % of shoppers said they

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.680
would go in-store to return items
if it helped reduce the environmental

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.700
cost of returns.

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:45.630
Amazon also has a program called
Amazon Warehouse, which sells renewed

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.860
goods at a discounted rate.

00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:50.490
Another big tool Amazon has to help
cut down on wasted inventory: a

00:12:50.490 --> 00:12:52.680
massive amount of data
on customer behavior.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:57.960
They can look at information about you
and and other folks like you, and

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.590
they can then have, you know,
their technology can make predictions that

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:06.380
says, hey, this product, there's gonna
be others that want it.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.080
There's demand for it. So if we get it
back and we get it back in the

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.600
region where it was shipped, we actually
think we're going to be able to

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.650
ship it to a buyer in that same spot.

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:18.390
But then there's all that packaging
waste created by returns, which Amazon

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.710
is trying to reduce. Kohl's and
the Amazon pickup locations generally are

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:27.720
using poly bags and other kinds of
containers when they aggregate all of

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:32.670
these returns together to
dramatically use less packaging.

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.970
Amazon has also replaced many
cardboard boxes with more lightweight

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.210
plastic mailers, although these mailers
aren't recyclable in curbside

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:43.590
bins. It claims the plastic mailers have
reduced packaging waste by 16 %

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:47.610
and eliminated the need for more than
305 million shipping boxes in just

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:52.620
2017. And last month, CEO Jeff Bezos
pledged to make Amazon carbon neutral

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:55.170
by 2040.

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.290
While Amazon works to cut down the
waste and high cost of returns, there's

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.650
a whole other side to it: a
growing market for companies and individuals

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:03.080
that make money off returns.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:07.200
It's sort of a new business that
kind of started from this e-commerce that

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:08.250
nobody ever thought of.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.010
One example is a
company called Happy Returns.

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:15.420
It has 700 return centers at malls
and inside stores where customers can

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:18.570
come return items from about
30 popular online stores.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.690
Happy Returns gets paid by its
retail partners to aggregate all its

00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:24.930
returns. Saving money on that
last-mile delivery person who would

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:26.670
otherwise need to
make multiple stops.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:31.080
It claims to save e-commerce retailers 20
to 30 % on shipping costs.

00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.520
The store or mall also pays Happy
Returns a fee, hoping the concierge

00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.530
service will bring shoppers
into its stores.

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:41.580
There's also a market of third-party
companies that buy returns in bulk,

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:45.180
repackage them, sometimes with added accessories,
and resell them for a

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:50.280
profit. So you can go to some
of these third-party companies and and buy

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:54.120
things that have been returned, kind
of almost like a salvage process.

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:57.720
And the really fascinating thing is some
of that ends up back on the

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.200
Amazon marketplace. There's also a
growing number of companies

00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:03.510
specializing only in
reverse logistics.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.350
GENCO, for example, was bought and
rebranded as FedEx Supply Chain.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:11.100
It helps liquidate returned inventory by
sending it to smaller markets

00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:15.030
like Brazil. It finds a market or
place for donation for products that

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:16.230
won't sell in the U.S.

00:15:16.650 --> 00:15:19.350
Think: the Super Bowl champions
t-shirt of the losing team.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.080
And of course there are
discount retailers like T.J.

00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.620
Maxx that buy returned and unsold merchandise
in bulk and then market it

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:26.880
up and sell it to consumers.

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:31.290
So we should absolutely be paying
attention to the returns market.

00:15:31.290 --> 00:15:35.610
And there's significant economic opportunities
for companies that are able

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.800
to help retailers with this problem.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.880
Meanwhile, Amazon itself is still working
to make returns more profitable

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:45.480
by making the process easier and
keeping its customers coming back.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:50.120
Amazon is definitely not perfect at
this whole returns process and there

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.320
are places where other retailers might
be more ecological or do something

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:59.420
better. But on the whole, Amazon is driving
a lot of the innovation in the

00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:04.220
returns market. So more so than
reducing their costs, they're saying let's

00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:08.570
make it really easy and hassle-free for
customers to return and that will

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:12.830
make customers trust us more and more
confident that they can buy from us

00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:14.330
instead of one of our competitors.
