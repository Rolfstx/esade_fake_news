00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.888
- This is probably the
best restaurant in the sky.

00:00:02.888 --> 00:00:05.770
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.884
Oh, every little inch is
precious here on the 747 cargo.

00:00:09.884 --> 00:00:11.490
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.110
We don't need any Qsuites
on this aeroplane.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.865
I'm gonna show you something even better.

00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:16.560
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.747
Who needs first class?

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:20.590
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.060
Let's quickly go back to the upper deck

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.710
because we just got a
seatbelt, there's a turbulence.

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:29.185
There you go, your full
flat bed in the sky.

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:32.769
I have super power, I'm
gonna use one of my finger

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.980
to pull the container forward.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.980
(upbeat rock music)

00:00:40.308 --> 00:00:43.391
(upbeat dance music)

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:51.160
It's been a longtime dream for me.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.500
Today I'm gonna fly on a cargo plane!

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.987
And what's better than the one behind me,

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:58.390
the 747-8 cargo of Qatar Airways?

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.783
Let's fly together guys.

00:00:59.783 --> 00:01:02.866
(upbeat dance music)

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.493
It's really, really crazy
weather outside in Hong Kong

00:01:08.493 --> 00:01:12.600
but the cargo loading just
started onto the 747-8.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.112
So let's check it out.

00:01:14.112 --> 00:01:16.279
(beeping)

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.890
- Hi, my name is Guillaume Halleux.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.810
I'm the chief officer
cargo for Qatar airways.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.650
We are very pleased to welcome Sam today

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.600
on board our 747-8 freighter
from Hong Kong to Doha.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.650
Very unique flight today, fully loaded,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.230
as quite often with Hong Kong.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.280
We expect 34 positions,
main deck of cargo.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.550
We expect one engine
connecting in Doha into Madrid.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.870
And very soon Alberto will
open the nose door for us

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.240
so that, Sam, you can show our viewers

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.530
from the outside, the unique
feature of that aeroplane.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.030
Well this is really,
really, crazy weather.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.933
A non-stop torrential rain in Hong Kong.

00:01:50.933 --> 00:01:53.470
But, look at this, 747
nose is about to open

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.423
to load a cargo in.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.543
(upbeat dance music)

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.990
I'm soaking wet but this is the operation.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.220
They must go on.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.580
I mean, I'm with all
the people who work hard

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.960
on the frontline, the operation.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.280
You must load all the cargo in the plane

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.170
and in about 40 minutes, we're
closing the door to take off.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.740
So hats off to all the people

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.894
who work under rain or shine like this.

00:02:26.894 --> 00:02:29.977
(upbeat dance music)

00:02:34.803 --> 00:02:38.230
- This unit here, as we
can see, is a rubber wheel.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.710
It's called the power drive unit, PDU.

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.370
It basically helps the traction

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.200
of the pallet inside the main deck

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.650
so that the staff and
our pulleys don't have

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.920
to push very hard.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.810
Each pallet can go up to
seven tonnes for one position.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.820
But sometimes we even
have 20 tonnes pallet.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.590
So nobody can really move it.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.820
Those roller blades here
are actually helping

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:58.653
also the movement.

00:02:58.653 --> 00:03:00.140
So be careful where you step

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.620
'cause I don't want you to fall down.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.350
- I'm on the flight deck of the nose here.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.810
And just one more pallet will come in

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.430
through the 747 nose.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.950
There's already one right here,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.210
which I filmed from down under the plane.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.460
So there's one more from
this position gonna come in.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.550
What's happening, Alberto?

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.100
- So now, due to the heavy rain,

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.137
the pallet has a lot
of water on top of the

00:03:19.137 --> 00:03:20.574
- [Sam] Oh the water's
on top of the pallet!

00:03:20.574 --> 00:03:22.750
- Yeah, so we have to get
rid of all this excess water.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.260
So that's why they're
bringing the pallet down

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.150
so that they can remove that excess water.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.229
- [Sam] Shake it off.

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:30.050
- Yeah, it's part of the job so.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.870
- [Sam] Look at all this
water on the pallet.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.387
Yeah, get rid of the water, too wet.

00:03:41.143 --> 00:03:43.743
- [Man On Radio] (mumbles)
higher on the below deck.

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:48.790
- [Sam] So this is how you lock it?

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.930
- [Alberto] Yeah.
- Can I try?

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.200
- [Alberto] Yeah, yup, and
then make sure they click down.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.683
- [Sam] Oh sorry, lift it up?

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:56.131
- [Alberto] Yup.
- Yeah, clicks down.

00:03:56.131 --> 00:03:56.964
- [Alberto] There you go!

00:03:56.964 --> 00:03:59.130
- We're like fully loaded
from Hong Kong here.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:00.030
Ready to go.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.060
Look at it, it's still wet!

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.850
Everything is plastic sealed.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.700
- So, Sam, I want you to
see and observe this pallet

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.850
in the nose part.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.170
Look how high it is.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:09.940
It's actually a couple of centimetres

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.904
from the ceiling of the plane there.

00:04:11.904 --> 00:04:14.220
This is pure optimization
of the space we have

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.080
on the freighter.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.381
This is how we maximise the aircraft

00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:19.183
and we move as much cargo as possible

00:04:19.183 --> 00:04:20.633
in an efficient manner.

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:23.716
(upbeat dance music)

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.343
- [Sam] Oh, barely, barely made this door.

00:04:35.343 --> 00:04:36.420
- [Guillaume] See how precise it is?

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.760
- [Sam] Precise, yes, oh wow!

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.880
- [Guillaume] People like Rolls-Royce,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.160
when they design an engine, or GE,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.660
they make sure that the maximum
size fits the cargo doors

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.930
of the aircraft available in the market.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.290
Because they know that otherwise
nobody can transport it.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.123
- That's right!

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:53.060
Talk about real estate here.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.120
Every little inch is precious here

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.910
on the 747 cargo.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.290
Just barely fits the ceiling
of the cargo deck here,

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:01.123
this engine.

00:05:01.123 --> 00:05:02.730
They're still having problems moving.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.054
So it's going back and
forth at the moment.

00:05:05.054 --> 00:05:07.637
(upbeat music)

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.900
- So Sam, what you just
saw is called a turn.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.903
The turn meaning that the
pallet enters perpendicular

00:05:16.903 --> 00:05:18.260
to the aeroplane, then they have

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.999
to turn it 90 degrees in order to load it.

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:24.166
(upbeat, funky music)

00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:31.760
- So now the engine is in position.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.640
What we'll do is listen to the load master

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.390
and apply tie down on the engine.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.930
We'll spend approximately
20 minutes on the tie down.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.180
- Normally, we use
these locks on the floor

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.150
to secure the pallets on the aircraft.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:45.310
But for this type of loading,

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.520
which is centre loaded on the 747,

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.590
we have to use straps.

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.770
We cannot use locks to secure the cargo.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.597
That's why we are having all these straps

00:05:52.597 --> 00:05:53.970
to secure the cargo.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.120
There's nothing else holding
this pallet to the aircraft.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.287
(upbeat, funky music)

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.500
- On each side of the 747 freighter,

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.300
you have a narrow passage
you can come through.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.550
'Cause the whole main deck, everywhere

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.460
in the centre is occupied
by the cargo pallets.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.520
And today we have full cargo pallets.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.720
This plane's huge!

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.320
Taking 135 tonnes capacity of cargo.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.123
- Hi guys, I'm Captain Orso.

00:06:23.123 --> 00:06:25.000
Today doing the freighter flight,

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.867
Qatar Airways cargo to Doha from Hong Kong

00:06:27.867 --> 00:06:29.785
on our beautiful 747-8.

00:06:29.785 --> 00:06:32.613
And let's move on for
the outside inspection.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.645
Okay before each flight, we check

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:38.043
that all wheels are in a good

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:42.203
position, that there's
nothing wrong with them.

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:46.762
All the tyre pressure is
good, nothing leaking.

00:06:46.762 --> 00:06:47.910
We have our landing lights.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.714
Everything looks nice.

00:06:49.714 --> 00:06:51.824
Entrance of the pickup tubes
is not blocked or something.

00:06:51.824 --> 00:06:53.410
That's very important for

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:54.243
- [Sam] You mean these two?

00:06:54.243 --> 00:06:55.076
- [Captain] Yes.

00:06:55.076 --> 00:06:56.600
- [Sam] This is the sensor, right?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.540
- This is the sensor.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:01.173
It takes the air and we have also

00:07:02.167 --> 00:07:05.670
static sensors and according
to what they have as an input,

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.290
we get the air speed out of
this and also other things.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.720
Here we check that everything is good

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:14.233
with our powerful GE
(mumbles) double engines.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.653
We check downstairs that
there is nothing leaking,

00:07:18.653 --> 00:07:20.433
no hydraulic, no fuel.

00:07:21.805 --> 00:07:25.805
And then proceed forward
to check our in blades.

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:31.342
(upbeat music)

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.810
- We have a huge engine
being loaded in our aircraft.

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.910
- I was told Rolls-Royce Trent 700.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.560
- Exactly, the one used on the Airbus 330.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:51.260
And of course since it's so big,

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:54.340
we have to strap it down very tightly.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.750
- You want it extra strapped down.

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:57.840
- [Captain] Exactly to
have a safe flight today.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.160
- [Sam] So you do the final
check before you sign off.

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.760
- Exactly, before we close the doors,

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.290
I come down and check all the locks

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:06.100
and everything inside the main deck.

00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.510
And then after if I agree with everything,

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.980
I do sign off the load sheet
and we close the doors and go.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.220
(upbeat music)

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.060
- And now I'm just climbing up the stairs

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.890
to go to the upper deck,
where the pilots fly.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:22.710
And where also there's a crew rest

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:26.225
where I'm gonna sit today as
a passenger on the 747 cargo.

00:08:26.225 --> 00:08:28.808
(upbeat music)

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.270
- Suggest you to keep
your seatbelts fastened.

00:08:33.270 --> 00:08:35.750
If they see anything that
there will be any turbulance

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.880
or we are already in turbulence.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.090
Sometimes it's a clear air turbulence.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.520
We cannot see before.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.930
I will set the seatbelt signs on.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:44.377
So you just sit.

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:49.360
If there is anything today
during the departure,

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.140
if we have to abort the
takeoff for example,

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:54.960
I will call you guys supernumaries.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.700
So if I say, "Supernumaries, be seated,"

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:58.890
just keep seated.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:59.938
Don't stand up.

00:08:59.938 --> 00:09:02.890
We don't use this door for any emergency.

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.070
We have another door right here.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.070
If we tell you to evacuate in such a case,

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:10.330
which will hopefully not happen.

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:11.163
- [Sam] Right here.
- Yup.

00:09:11.163 --> 00:09:13.590
We have this done and in such a case,

00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:15.310
we go always already come to you.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.450
And we will open the
door, push out the slide,

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.310
and then we will slide down all together.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.770
- These are the seats
on the 747-8 upper deck.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:26.630
There are six seats, two
private bunks back at the back.

00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:28.550
Ciao, Giancarlo.
- Hello!

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.240
- Today first officer from Italy.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.340
- Today on our flight
from Hong Kong to Doha,

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.670
that'll be around seven
hours and 35 minutes.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.300
We will cruise initially at
an altitude of 30,000 feet,

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.140
since we are really topped
up today, fully loaded.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.513
And thereafter, after
using some more fuel,

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.550
we plan to climb to 32,000 feet

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.550
to continue until Doha.

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:59.340
- Captain, I wanna know
like you fly 747-8 cargo.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.100
Have you flown passenger flights?

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:02.830
I want to know what kind of difference

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.650
as a pilot flying cargo
compared to flying passenger?

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:09.113
- Yeah, I did passenger
flights as well before.

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:12.470
I feel that cargo flights
are a little bit easier

00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:13.410
for the crew.
- Yeah.

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.130
- There is no passengers,
nothing to wait for.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:18.560
If the load is finished, you
just close the doors and go.

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.953
- Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, bye!

00:10:24.619 --> 00:10:25.561
- Good to go!

00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:28.228
(intense music)

00:10:37.657 --> 00:10:38.879
- [Man On Radio] Qatar 841 niner

00:10:38.879 --> 00:10:40.315
behind the landing triple seven.

00:10:40.315 --> 00:10:42.851
Line up and wait, 1007 right behind it.

00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:44.768
- [Captain] Behind landing
traffic line up and wait,

00:10:44.768 --> 00:10:48.584
07 is right behind the Qatari 841 niner.

00:10:48.584 --> 00:10:51.334
(dramatic music)

00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:53.402
- [Man On Radio] Qatari 841 Niner,

one eight knots from a 07
right, clear for takeoff.

00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:59.245
- [Captain] Clear to take off 07 right,

00:10:59.245 --> 00:11:00.750
Qatari 841 niner.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:03.500
(dramatic music)

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:07.383
Rotate.

00:11:13.128 --> 00:11:14.000
(mumbles)

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.700
- [Giancarlo] Gear up.
- Gear up.

00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:19.868
(mumbles)

00:11:26.273 --> 00:11:27.827
- [Man On Radio] Qatari 841 niner contact

00:11:27.827 --> 00:11:29.906
for departure from 123 days night clear.

00:11:29.906 --> 00:11:31.629
- [Capatain] One two three point eight,

00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:33.286
Qatari 841 niner bye.

00:11:33.286 --> 00:11:36.036
(dramatic music)

00:11:51.362 --> 00:11:54.529
- [Sam] Fly over Bangladesh, Calcutta,

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:58.299
just north of Bombay,

00:11:59.705 --> 00:12:01.122
over Arabian Sea.

00:12:02.078 --> 00:12:06.070
Were flying over north
over the Strait of Hormuz,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:08.263
down to Qatar.

00:12:09.890 --> 00:12:12.670
So after takeoff, we're
all getting hungry.

00:12:12.670 --> 00:12:13.503
- Yes.

00:12:13.503 --> 00:12:15.520
- Alberto is the load master.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.550
I think you are also
the chef on this flight.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:18.690
- I will be onboard today yes.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.160
- Yeah, we'll see what kind of meals

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.370
on a cargo plane we have,

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.080
gourmet, five-star Qatar Airways food.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:24.913
- Of course.

00:12:24.913 --> 00:12:25.746
That we call the magic box.

00:12:25.746 --> 00:12:27.420
So we have
- Magic box?

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.280
- Yes I don't know what's why
- Let's have a look!

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.173
What's the magic?

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.583
- [Alberto] So

00:12:36.648 --> 00:12:37.699
- [Sam] Oh!

00:12:37.699 --> 00:12:38.690
- [Alberto] Snacks.

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:39.523
- [Sam] Snack.

00:12:39.523 --> 00:12:40.930
- [Alberto] Snacks, cookies.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:41.763
- [Sam] Oh this is nice.

00:12:41.763 --> 00:12:42.870
This is like nuts.

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:43.810
- [Alberto] Yeah.

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:44.750
- [Sam] All right, cookies.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.078
- [Alberto] Cookies, some wheat.

00:12:47.078 --> 00:12:48.863
- [Sam] Weeatbix, wow!

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:51.913
Cool!

00:12:51.913 --> 00:12:55.293
- [Alberto] Plus we also have
tea, coffee, very important.

00:12:55.293 --> 00:12:57.513
- [Sam] Coffee, oh, Nairobi coffee.

00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.685
Oh yes, cup noodles.

00:13:00.685 --> 00:13:02.395
- [Alberto] (laughing) Of course.

00:13:02.395 --> 00:13:05.432
We have salmon.

00:13:05.432 --> 00:13:07.099
- [Sam] Salmon, ooh.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.963
- [Alberto] We also have chicken.

00:13:10.963 --> 00:13:12.296
- [Sam] Chicken.

00:13:14.914 --> 00:13:15.883
- [Alberto] And pasta.

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:18.263
- [Sam] What's this one, pasta?

00:13:18.263 --> 00:13:19.096
- [Alberto] Pasta.

00:13:20.510 --> 00:13:21.580
- There's no flight attendants.

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:24.910
So you gotta help yourself,
come to the galley here,

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:26.870
order your food, and help yourself.

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:28.185
Much quicker, no?

00:13:28.185 --> 00:13:30.768
(upbeat music)

00:13:32.526 --> 00:13:34.410
Well there are six seats on the upper deck

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:36.830
on the 747-8 freighter here.

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:39.960
I mean like these seats
are not really the Qsuites,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.820
but they do recline pretty deep.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.540
It's like an old La-Z-Boy.

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:46.740
It feels very, very comfy.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.310
- In order to go downstairs, we have

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:50.710
to carry this oxygen bottle
because there's no oxygen mask

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:51.848
like in the passenger aircraft.

00:13:51.848 --> 00:13:53.920
So this in case of a decompression.

00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.440
So, in case we need it,
you just open the valve,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.420
place the mask, breathe normally.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:00.750
That's it.

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.500
- Now I'm just going downstairs.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.826
So now, I'm wearing this oxygen mask

00:14:05.826 --> 00:14:07.723
in case of decompression.

00:14:07.723 --> 00:14:12.651
Just going down to the deck
to take a look all the cargos.

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:15.234
(upbeat music)

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:21.100
I was just looking out this window.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.350
It has amazing engine view.

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:25.930
Okay, let's go continue now.

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:28.270
Coming to the middle of the fuselage,

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:29.880
where the engine is now.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.463
(upbeat music)

00:14:40.553 --> 00:14:42.021
- So these flashing lights mean

00:14:42.021 --> 00:14:43.740
that the seatbelt sign has been turned on.

00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:47.434
So we have to return to the
main deck because of turbulence.

00:14:47.434 --> 00:14:49.060
So.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.580
- Let's quickly go back to the upper deck

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.360
because we just got a seatbelt.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.410
There's a turbulence.

00:14:56.111 --> 00:14:59.090
Oh I can tell you
carrying this oxygen mask.

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.430
It's a couple kilos, it's not easy.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.910
Ooh, better sit down and seatbelt now.

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.900
Captain, the CB, what's the ceiling like?

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:08.830
It looks really bulbous.

00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:11.190
- According to the weather
charts we have today,

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.470
it's going up to 45,000 feet.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:16.930
It's well above us so
there's no another chance

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.060
than avoiding as we're
just doing right now.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:23.774
- You are small adjustment
trying to go around going,

00:15:23.774 --> 00:15:25.490
not going through, okay.

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:27.070
- Exactly, it would be real dangerous

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.370
to go inside those clouds.

00:15:29.284 --> 00:15:32.920
And we are just going, we try
to do smallest adjustments.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.680
Sometimes we have to do larger ones.

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.060
Like right now, we are 30 miles

00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:40.150
to the right of our track,
but we have to do it.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:42.213
There is no other chance to avoid them.

00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.750
- So now, I'm gonna
show you the best thing.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:47.390
We don't need any Qsuites
on this aeroplane.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:50.110
I'm gonna show you something
even better than a Qsuite.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.943
Follow me.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.100
Now, look at this!

00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:01.946
I have my own private bedroom here.

00:16:01.946 --> 00:16:06.946
There you go, your full flat
bed in the sky on the 747-8.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.010
There's nothing better than this.

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.070
Your feet doesn't hit the wall

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.270
and you know you got all the room.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.040
Look at how wide this seat is.

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.410
And it's full flat, it's
like a mattress on here.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.040
This is better than all
the business class seats

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:21.890
I have tried out.

00:16:24.288 --> 00:16:27.020
(upbeat music)

00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:30.210
We finally went past the weather system.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:31.810
The seatbelt sign's off now.

00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:33.995
So I'm going down to check out the cargo.

00:16:33.995 --> 00:16:36.578
(upbeat music)

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:47.630
747 hold about 145 tonnes,
pallets and pallets of cargo.

00:16:47.653 --> 00:16:50.236
(upbeat music)

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.660
Oh my god, this part is really narrow!

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.410
By the nose coming out
from the back to the nose.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.449
Oh, very narrow, made it, geez!

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:11.032
(upbeat music)

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:20.103
(white noise)

00:17:23.323 --> 00:17:25.440
Actually self-serving

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.210
and now I'm going to
the cockpit for my meal.

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.060
What a great place to have a meal at.

00:17:32.475 --> 00:17:36.171
This is probably the best
restaurant in the sky.

00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:37.742
Ah, look at this, beautiful, huh?

00:17:37.742 --> 00:17:39.156
- Yeah, that looks good.

00:17:39.156 --> 00:17:41.739
(upbeat music)

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.900
- Nothing better, cruising 34,000 feet.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.040
Just flew over the Indian coast,

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.150
on our way toward Arabian Sea

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.200
and having my second meal in the cockpit.

00:17:54.367 --> 00:17:57.117

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:36.006
continue approach, Q and H
niner niner, eight tack pascals.

00:18:36.006 --> 00:18:38.756
(dramatic music)

00:18:43.678 --> 00:18:44.700
- Welcome to Doha!

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.507
Thank you very much for joining us today.

00:18:46.507 --> 00:18:48.370
And I hope you have enjoyed the flight.

00:18:48.370 --> 00:18:51.720
Hope to see you on another
flight at Qatar Airways.

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.897
All right, Giancarlo
- Thank you.

00:18:53.897 --> 00:18:54.890
- Yeah, thank you and.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.090
- So this is your last flight I heard

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:58.024
before you go back to your home country,

00:18:58.024 --> 00:18:59.500
stationed at your home country.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.333
- That's correct.

00:19:00.333 --> 00:19:01.240
- Are you gonna miss this?

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.350
- Of course.
- Big time.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.610
- This is an amazing job so I
really enjoyed all this time

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:07.400
here in Doha so it's time to go home.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.390
- Well, thank you so much for looking

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:09.223
after me on the flight.

00:19:09.223 --> 00:19:12.930
I learned so much and this
is a flight to remember.

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:14.530
- Yes of course, even for me this is

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:16.690
I will remember this for a
very long, long, long time.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:17.870
Thank you very much also.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.610
- And guys, it's not the end.

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:23.140
We haven't shown you all
the cargo facilities,

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.470
loading, offloading activities in Doha.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.303
So stay tuned!

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.640
Super, super humid in Doha here.

00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:35.060
But nothing better than
walking down a 747.

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.634
What a glorious arrival!

00:19:36.634 --> 00:19:39.634
(upbeat rock music)

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.890
- Welcome to the Hamad
International Airport cargo campus.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:51.760
This is our hub.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.780
This is where all the transit cargo

00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.680
that came to Doha will be broken down,

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.380
sorted, and put on a connecting flight.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.990
Again, similar process as the passengers.

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.030
So this is an example
of a lower deck pallet

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:06.210
that is ready to go and to be loaded.

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:10.080
The three components, the aluminium sheet,

00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:12.219
this is the base of the pallet.

00:20:12.219 --> 00:20:14.739
The boxes inside have been positioned

00:20:14.739 --> 00:20:18.100
to a certain height to make
sure it fits in the belly.

00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:20.560
And then the plastic sheet
to protect from water.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:22.810
And the net, and the
net would be tightened

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:26.210
to avoid that the content collapses

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.128
on the side of the pallet.

00:20:28.128 --> 00:20:31.128
(upbeat rock music)

00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:34.580
Sam, earlier in the flight today,

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.370
we talked about the
contour of the aircraft

00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.180
and contour of the pallets, right?

00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:41.140
If you come with me to that side,

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:44.400
you clearly see that one side
is actually very straight

00:20:45.768 --> 00:20:50.510
with a top, and then it goes
and it makes sort of an arch.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:54.400
And the arch is designed
to match the fuselage

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.312
of the aircraft in order
to maximise the space used

00:20:57.312 --> 00:21:02.312
on the pallet. (upbeat rock music)

00:21:06.690 --> 00:21:08.890
- Sam, we're now in a danger zone.

00:21:08.890 --> 00:21:10.130
We're talking dangerous goods.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:11.770
So we have classfied them
- Dangerous?

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:12.710
- Very dangerous.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.720
So we've classified them
in several categories.

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.680
And they're segregated from one another.

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.613
So you have your corrosives.

00:21:17.613 --> 00:21:20.360
You have your flammables over there.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.020
And further down here.

00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:23.830
I don't want to go too close,

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:25.840
but again, properly segregated.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.780
So it's all in safe hands.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.560
And this specific one is
for cargo aircraft only.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.421
So it will not travel in the
belly hold with passengers,

00:21:33.421 --> 00:21:34.610
only cargo aircraft.
- All right.

00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:37.360
So most dangerous goods
travel on cargo planes.

00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.260
- Not all, but certain categories.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:42.030
It's all categorised and
you see it in the labels

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.424
that are displayed on the box.

00:21:44.424 --> 00:21:46.957
So this has the categories so.

00:21:46.957 --> 00:21:49.699
(upbeat rock music)

00:21:49.699 --> 00:21:53.030
- Qatar Airways, we transport
more than 1,000 cars per year.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:53.890
- A thousand cars?

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.551
- To around the world,
this one is a new one.

00:21:56.551 --> 00:21:58.220
It's a main deck car.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.510
It's too high to go on
the passenger flight.

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:03.230
But sometimes we move Ferraris or Porsches

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:04.220
in the passenger plane.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:05.890
So don't be surprised
if next time you fly,

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:09.060
through the window, you
see a Ferrari being loaded

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:09.935
under your feet.

00:22:09.935 --> 00:22:12.935
(upbeat rock music)

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.440
- Sam, this illustrates
one of the great pride

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.510
that we have at Qatar
Airways, contributing

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:23.220
to a better world by
sending aid and relief

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.550
to people and populations in need.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.020
So we do it twofold.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.620
We do it with NGOs.

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.760
We also do it, part of
our humanitarian activity,

00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:33.850
meaning we ship some cargo free of charge

00:22:33.850 --> 00:22:36.730
to a number of locations
when people are in need.

00:22:36.730 --> 00:22:38.900
- We are in our live animal facility,

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.390
full air-conditioned facility

00:22:40.390 --> 00:22:43.680
where we look after all of our
animals, the smaller animals.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.290
Little cat here going, coming from Sofia

00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:49.906
and going to Jakarta, fabulous nation.

00:22:49.906 --> 00:22:51.533
- [Sam] From JFK to Lahore.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.300
Beautiful cats. (meowing)

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.480
- This is area for dogs where
we just have delivery coming

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.610
in from Washington here for Doha.

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.370
So the owner, very happy owner,

00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:03.653
will be soon collecting his beloved dog.

00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:09.580
- So Frank, what kind of
exotic animals do you transport

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.413
as cargo?

00:23:10.413 --> 00:23:12.630
- Oh Sam, we go from zebras to lions

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.783
to elephants, but not
today, unfortunately.

00:23:15.783 --> 00:23:18.783
(upbeat rock music)

00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:22.060
- Welcome to our climate control centre.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:25.310
This is where all the
perishable cargo we transit.

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.870
We guarantee temperature
from 15 to 25 degrees.

00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.330
In the other room over there
from three to eight degrees.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:34.400
And we carry here pharmaceutical

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.203
as well as food and any sort
of other perishable products.

00:23:38.203 --> 00:23:40.786
(upbeat music)

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:44.170
- It's actually really easy.

00:23:44.170 --> 00:23:45.970
These wheels made it.

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:50.104
I mean you can push four tonne by one man.

00:23:50.104 --> 00:23:53.360
On your own, you can
push four tonne in cargo.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.093
Oh, look, you got fresh fish coming in.

00:23:58.501 --> 00:24:00.960
It looks really easy, they
just push it like this!

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.960
(upbeat rock music)

00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:07.990
Well thanks for showing me so much.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.950
I actually never thought about you know

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.730
when people think about cargo,

00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:14.560
we don't really think much
about it really, honestly.

00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:17.620
And now seeing all the facilities you have

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:21.630
like the perishable one, like
you have a dangerous one.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.240
You have so much, so much areas.

00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.410
You have all sorts of cargo.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:27.450
You know when you think about,

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:29.850
for example, the phone I'm holding here.

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.220
This came in on a cargo plane.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.110
- You're right, Sam.

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.000
Cargo is an industry
that is not well-known

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.310
to the wider audience.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:37.770
However, it's everywhere.

00:24:37.770 --> 00:24:40.240
The shirt you're wearing
came to your shop in cargo.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.020
The watch, your iPhone,
probably your shoes,

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:43.853
and the salmon you had last night

00:24:43.853 --> 00:24:46.010
in your hotel in Hong Kong came

00:24:46.010 --> 00:24:48.110
to Hong Kong on Qatar Airways cargo.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:49.680
- Wow, well thank you very much

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:50.960
for showing me.
- My pleasure!

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.960
- It's a huge pleasure to fly
on a 747-8 Qatar Airways cargo

00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.950
and also see the world-class
facility here in Doha.

00:24:58.950 --> 00:25:00.023
- It was a great pleasure to have you.

00:25:00.023 --> 00:25:01.592
Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:25:01.592 --> 00:25:03.270
I have super power.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.260
I'm gonna use one of my fingers

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:07.060
to pull the container forward.

00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:07.893
Watch it.

00:25:09.788 --> 00:25:12.519
Using one finger, let's go.

00:25:12.519 --> 00:25:14.852
(squeaking)

00:25:16.474 --> 00:25:17.810
Wow, that was the super power I have

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.140
after the 747 flight, but honestly,

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.670
it is an empty container.

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:23.323
Thank you so much for watching!
