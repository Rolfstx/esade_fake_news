00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.509
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lack of access to running water
is an issue in many developing countries,

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:08.940
but it turns out it's also a problem in the
United States.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.590
The sprawling Navajo Nation reservation is
the size of West Virginia and it spreads across

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:19.010
13 counties in New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.760
Special correspondent Fred de Sam Lazaro traveled
to Thoreau, New Mexico, and has this report

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.619
on new efforts to get on the grid to get the
water.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.790
It's part of his ongoing series Agents for
Change and this week's Leading Edge segment.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.320
Darlene Arviso's truck route takes her to
some of the most remote and isolated people

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.750
in America.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.980
She is their link to the world outside, her
payload literally a lifeline.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.399
DARLENE ARVISO, Truck Driver: The kids would
be yelling, running to the water truck when

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:53.780
I'm coming up to their house.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.840
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She's known as the Water
Lady in a region where 40 percent of residents

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.660
have no access to running water.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.110
Many live in such extreme poverty, they can't
even afford large containers.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.970
Often Darlene Arviso delivers more than just
water.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.670
Working with her church and other charities,
she helped this family at the onset of last

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:17.670
winter.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.670
DARLENE ARVISO: I brought them food.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.170
I saw the trailer, the small one.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.090
We gave out some blankets to cover the window.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.119
That time, it was snowing.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.380
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, it gets pretty cold
up here?

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.710
DARLENE ARVISO: Yes, it gets very cold.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.070
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A few miles away, Arviso
has a new customer.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.630
Tina Bicenti returned to her family's ancestral
land from a trailer park she had rented in

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.060
the town of Thoreau, New Mexico.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.200
Despite the harsh conditions, she wanted to
raise her five children, including 6-month-old

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.960
twin girls, on the Navajo Reservation.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.210
TINA BICENTI, Mother: I wanted to have my
children have more open space for them to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.460
run around outside.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.930
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: What they gave up are
two of life's most basic amenities, electricity

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.770
and running water.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.950
Water they use in their new home is carried
in from Bicenti's mother's home a mile down

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.180
the road at the other end of their homestead.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.309
Even using the toilet involves a trip to grandma's
house.

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:21.109
TINA BICENTI: I am planning to look into getting
a port-a-potty or a port-a-outhouse.

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:25.909
As for the shower and the bath, I can't really
do anything unless I have a main water line,

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.120
until I have a septic service and all of that.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.319
But, like I said, I can't get that.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.970
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Due to a long waiting
list, getting connected to the main water

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.249
line could take up to 15 years, and it will
cost more than $12,000.

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:46.950
Although Bicenti works full-time, piped-in
water is a luxury she cannot afford.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.739
GEORGE MCGRAW, Founder, DigDeep: For a long
time, we told those people, just wait.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.049
Infrastructure will catch up with you.

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.670
Well, infrastructure is not coming.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:59.049
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: George McGraw founded
a group called DigDeep that used to work on

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.319
water projects in Africa, but is now directing
its efforts to help some of two million people

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.930
in this country, like the Bicenti family,
who lack access to clean water and sanitation.

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.049
GEORGE MCGRAW: When the backhoe is active,
everyone needs to have a hardhat on.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.519
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That includes 18,000 homes
in the Navajo Nation.

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.569
Wells are not an option for most homeowners.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.379
They're deep, expensive, and there's no guarantee
of clean water.

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.249
GEORGE MCGRAW: A lack of clean water in the
United States does exactly the same thing

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:29.930
to families it does around the world.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.541
It impacts their health, their ability to
hold down a job, to get an education, their

00:03:34.541 --> 00:03:38.939
ability to spend time with their kids, to
play, to have a happy life.

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:45.310
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: DigDeep's solution is
in off-grid systems that don't require a utility

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.319
hookup.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.239
Tina Bicenti's is one of nearly 300 homes
being fitted with large water storage systems

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.879
and solar-powered pumps to bring drinking
water directly into the home.

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.569
TINA BICENTI: It's going to be good, because
we don't have to haul water.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:01.989
We will have it here.

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.140
It will allow us to give the girls a bath
in the sink, because they're still small,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.439
and it will allow the drinking water.

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.970
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: As more of these 1,200-gallon
cisterns are installed, there's a need for

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.959
a more convenient water source.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.220
So, DigDeep is looking for spots to drill
more unity wells like this one.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.590
It's a costly and time-consuming process.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.650
The first task when water comes out of this
hole is to make sure that it's free of contaminants.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.300
Uranium from old mines is a common one.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.849
If it checks out as clean, this well will
bring huge savings for hundreds of families

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:41.599
who come from miles around here.

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:47.539
On average, residents of the Navajo Reservation
pay 13 cents for a gallon of water.

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:54.110
That is 72 times what a typical rate payer
pays in suburban Arizona or New Mexico.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.830
GEORGE MCGRAW: We spend a lot of our time
out here working on water project, but a lot

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.860
more time in our office in Los Angeles, for
instance, trying to convince everybody in

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.120
America they should pay attention to this
problem, care about it, and want to do something

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.120
about it.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:10.370
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Last year, DigDeep did
manage to convince some nearby Rotary Clubs,

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:16.530
which pledged some $75,000, which will fund
about 18 installations like this one Tina

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.240
Bicenti's home.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.509
Rotary International has long been involved
in clean water projects around the world,

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:29.940
but Jim Bissonett of Scottsdale, Arizona,
said they never imagine doing this work in

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:30.940
their own backyard.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.199
JIM BISSONETT, Rotary International: It's
kind of a shock when you think that people

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:34.510
in the United States don't have running water.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.539
We're going to change the lives of this family
dramatically from the water they were carrying

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:41.770
in pickle jars to their house actually having
running water.

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.800
And that's a huge shift for them.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.020
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: They will have a few more
small luxuries with the new rooftop, solar

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.020
panel.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.960
It will drive the water pump and also some
basic LED lighting.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.430
TINA BICENTI: Lights.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.389
Well, we have power.

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.509
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Projects like these also
help train and provide work that can keep

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:03.720
local talent local.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:08.599
Twenty-three-year-old Annie Begay's skills
could fetch a job anywhere in America, but

00:06:08.599 --> 00:06:11.940
she's thrilled to be able to stay in the place
she calls home.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.069
ANNIE BEGAY, DigDeep: You get to know the
family before we put in the systems.

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:17.030
You get to know a little bit of their background.

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:21.889
And it's where I grew up, so it's a good feeling
knowing that you're helping where you grew

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:22.889
up.

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:28.479
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Finally, at the end of
a long day, the Water Lady arrived for her

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:35.509
big delivery, and Annie Begay tightened the
last screws.

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.840
It was time to gather around the sink for
an impromptu celebration, as Tina Bicenti

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:51.990
turned on the faucet, a mundane and giant
leap for this family into the modern world

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:54.999
that many of her neighbors are still waiting
to join.

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:59.819
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Fred de Sam Lazaro
in the Navajo Nation.

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:03.060
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not taking water for granted.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.580
And Fred's wonderful reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories Project at the

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.889
University of St. Thomas in Minnesota.
