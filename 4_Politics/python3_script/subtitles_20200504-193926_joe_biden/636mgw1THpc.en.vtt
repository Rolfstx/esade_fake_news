00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:03.336
President Obama:
Greetings, massive!

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.005
(laughter and applause)

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:08.274
Wah gwaan, Jamaica?

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.177
(applause)

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.253
Can everybody
please give Aubrey

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.188
a big round of applause for
the great introduction?

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:26.226
(applause)

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.998
I want to thank the
University of the West Indies

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.166
for hosting us.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.901
Big up, You-Wee!

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.837
(applause)

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:40.573
Thank you.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:42.142
I've been making
myself at home here.

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:43.943
(laughter)

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:49.549
It is great to be in
beautiful Jamaica --

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:51.152
not only because I'm proud
to be the first 

00:00:51.152 --> 00:00:56.389
President of the United States 
to visit in more than 30 years,

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:59.692
but because I just
like the vibe here.

00:00:59.692 --> 00:01:05.698
(applause) 

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:11.005
I was born on an island, and 
it was warm, and so I feel right

00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:15.408
at home.  And I'm grateful for 
the warm Jamaican hospitality

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.744
that I received this
morning, including from

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:20.947
Prime Minister
Simpson-Miller.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:23.516
I also had the chance to meet
with leaders from across

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:26.486
the Caribbean, where
we focused on issues

00:01:26.486 --> 00:01:30.056
of shared prosperity
and shared security.

00:01:30.056 --> 00:01:32.525
And tomorrow, I'll meet
with leaders from across

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:35.962
the hemisphere at the Summit
of the Americas in Panama.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:40.233
But before my trip
became all business,

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:44.671
I wanted to come here and hear
from young people like you.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.341
Because it is your generation
who will shape the future

00:01:48.341 --> 00:01:52.445
of our countries and our
region and this planet

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:56.316
that we share long after
those of us who are currently

00:01:56.316 --> 00:02:00.920
in public service are
gone from the stage.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.190
So I'm going to only speak
for a few minutes at the top,

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.394
because I'd rather spend time
taking questions from you,

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:11.564
and also because after
we have a chance for

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:15.034
our town hall, I get a
chance to say hi to Usain

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.103
Bolt and Shelly
Ann Fraser-Pryce.

00:02:17.103 --> 00:02:20.874
(applause)

00:02:20.874 --> 00:02:24.777
When you have the fastest
people on the planet,

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.980
you've got to say
hi to them, right?

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:28.915
Because that's fast.

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:29.916
(laughter)

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:32.385
There are a lot of
people out there,

00:02:32.385 --> 00:02:34.621
and they're the fastest.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:42.395
Now, we are not just nations,
we're also neighbors.

00:02:42.395 --> 00:02:45.131
Tens of millions of Americans
are bound to the Caribbean

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:48.635
and the Americas through
ties of commerce,

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:51.237
but also ties of kin.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:53.239
More than one million
Americans trace their

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.009
ancestry to Jamaica.

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:58.011
More than one
million Americans visit

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.113
Jamaica each year.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.549
So we're committed to
you and this region.

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:06.786
And as I've said before, in
our foreign policy there

00:03:06.786 --> 00:03:09.756
are no senior or junior
partners in the Americas;

00:03:09.756 --> 00:03:10.757
there are just partners.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:13.993
And that's one reason why
the United States has

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:16.029
started a new chapter
in our relations with

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:17.664
the people of Cuba.

00:03:17.664 --> 00:03:20.300
(applause)

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:28.041
We will continue to have
some differences with

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:31.978
the Cuban government, but we
don't want to be imprisoned

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:34.280
by the past.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.848
When something doesn't
work for 50 years,

00:03:35.848 --> 00:03:38.551
you don't just keep on doing
it; you try something new.

00:03:38.551 --> 00:03:41.387
(applause)

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:44.490
And we are as committed
as ever to supporting

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.793
human rights and
political freedom in Cuba

00:03:46.793 --> 00:03:48.761
and around the world.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:51.698
But I believe that engagement
is a more powerful force

00:03:51.698 --> 00:03:54.767
than isolation, and the
changes we are making

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:58.204
can help improve the lives
of the Cuban people.

00:03:58.204 --> 00:04:00.239
And I also believe that this
new beginning will be good

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.478
for the United States and
the entire hemisphere.

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:08.748
My point is, I believe
we can move past some

00:04:08.748 --> 00:04:13.186
of the old debates that so
often define the region,

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:15.388
and move forward in a way
that benefits your generation

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:19.792
with new thinking -- an
energetic, impatient,

00:04:19.792 --> 00:04:22.595
dynamic and diverse
generation that you

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.597
represent, both in
the United States

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:26.899
and across this
hemisphere.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.435
More than 100 million
people in Latin America

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:34.307
and the Caribbean are between
the ages of 15 and 24.

00:04:34.307 --> 00:04:38.645
Most of the region
is under 35.

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:41.648
And what gives me so much hope
about your generation is that

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:45.652
you're more interested in the
hard work of waging peace

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:49.889
than resorting to the quick
impulses of conflict.

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.425
You're more interested in the
hard work of building prosperity

00:04:52.425 --> 00:04:56.462
through entrepreneurship,
not cronyism or corruption.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:05:00.967
(applause)

00:05:03.336 --> 00:05:04.837
You're more eager
for progress that comes

00:05:04.837 --> 00:05:06.973
not by holding down any
segment of society,

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.742
but by holding up the
rights of every human being,

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:12.378
regardless of what we look
like, or how we pray,

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.881
or who we love.

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:17.917
You care less about the
world as it has been,

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:21.120
and more about the world
as it should be and can be.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.323
And unlike any other
time in our history,

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:26.459
the technology at your
disposal means that you don't

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:29.195
have to wait for the change
that you're looking for;

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:32.465
you have the freedom to
create it in your own

00:05:32.465 --> 00:05:36.302
powerful and
disruptive ways.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:38.304
Many of you already have,
whether by starting your

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:41.607
own enterprises or by
helping others start theirs.

00:05:41.607 --> 00:05:44.110
And I'm going to just single
out two remarkable young

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.345
leaders who are here today
because I think they're

00:05:46.345 --> 00:05:49.515
an example of what is
possible, even in the most

00:05:49.515 --> 00:05:51.584
difficult of
circumstances.

00:05:51.584 --> 00:05:53.753
So Angeline Jackson
is here today.

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:55.955
Where is Angeline?

00:05:55.955 --> 00:05:57.156
There she is, right there.

00:05:57.156 --> 00:05:59.325
(applause)

00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:04.363
Several years ago,
when Angeline was 19,

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:06.699
she and a friend were
kidnapped, held at gunpoint

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.235
and sexually assaulted.

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:10.603
And as a woman,
and as a lesbian,

00:06:10.603 --> 00:06:13.206
justice and society were
not always on her side.

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:15.708
But instead of remaining
silent, she chose to speak

00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:18.277
out and started her own
organization to advocate

00:06:18.277 --> 00:06:21.114
for women like her, and
get them treatment and get

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:23.816
them justice, and push
back against stereotypes,

00:06:23.816 --> 00:06:26.986
and give them some sense
of their own power.

00:06:26.986 --> 00:06:29.255
And she became a
global activist.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:31.724
But more than anything, she
cares about her Jamaica,

00:06:31.724 --> 00:06:33.726
and making it a place
where everybody,

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:35.728
no matter their
color, or their class,

00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:37.730
or their sexual orientation,
can live in equality

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:38.798
and opportunity.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.000
That's the power of one
person, what they can do.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.102
(applause)

00:06:48.441 --> 00:06:51.244
Jerome Cowans grew up in
a tough part of Kingston.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:52.678
Where's Jerome?

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:56.015
(applause)

00:06:58.818 --> 00:07:02.221
When Jerome was 12,
he saw a friend gunned down.

00:07:02.221 --> 00:07:03.556
And when he looked at
the shooters, he said,

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:07.794
"I realized that wasn't
a life I wanted to live.

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:11.864
They had expensive machinery,
but they had nothing else."

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:16.402
So at the ripe old age of 13,
he founded a youth group

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:18.738
to help others like him
stay on the right path.

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:22.675
And he started small,
with only six people,

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:24.677
but they had one
big thing in common

00:07:24.677 --> 00:07:27.513
and they believed that
change was possible.

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:29.849
And like Angeline, he was
threatened for his work,

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.451
but he kept at it.

00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:34.887
And he said, "Things
won't get any better

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:37.056
if no one does anything."

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:40.560
And today, the LEAD Youth Club
he started has six chapters,

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.428
including one in Colombia.

00:07:42.428 --> 00:07:44.463
His work has taken him
to five continents.

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:47.233
Last year, he became the
first Jamaican to receive

00:07:47.233 --> 00:07:50.269
the Nelson Mandela
Innovation Award.

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.504
He's just 25 years old.

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:54.240
(applause)

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:09.188
So individuals like those
two young people --

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:11.757
the young people here
today -- you remind

00:08:11.757 --> 00:08:13.659
me of something that
Bob Marley once said.

00:08:13.659 --> 00:08:16.629
You know I went to
his house yesterday.

00:08:16.629 --> 00:08:17.730
(laughter)

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:19.532
I thought, I'm only five
minutes from his house,

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:20.733
I got to go check it out.

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:22.468
(laughter)

00:08:22.468 --> 00:08:26.873
And one of the displays
has to do when he was

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:31.210
shot right before a concert
he was supposed to give,

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:35.948
trying to bring the political
factions in Jamaica together.

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:40.519
And he was treated for his
wounds and he went ahead

00:08:40.519 --> 00:08:42.521
with the program, went
ahead with the show.

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:44.524
And somebody asked, well,
why would you do that?

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:46.525
He said, "The people
who are trying to make

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:48.694
this world worse are
not taking the day off.

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:51.430
Why should I?"

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:52.531
Why should I?

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:54.567
(applause)

00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:59.872
So none of us can afford
to take the day off.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:03.509
And I want you to
have every chance,

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:06.412
every tool you need to
make this world better.

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:09.682
So today I'm announcing
nearly $70 million

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:12.652
in U.S. investments in
education, training,

00:09:12.652 --> 00:09:15.121
and employment programs
for our young people

00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:16.856
throughout Latin America
and the Caribbean.

00:09:16.856 --> 00:09:19.392
(applause)

00:09:25.798 --> 00:09:29.335
And these investments
will help young people

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:33.339
in unemployed and impoverished
and marginalized communities,

00:09:33.339 --> 00:09:35.107
and give them a chance to
gain the skills they need

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:38.911
to compete and succeed in
the 21st century economy.

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:40.413
And that's not all.

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:42.281
As President, some of the
initiatives I'm most proud

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:45.384
of the ones that increase my
country's engagement with

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:48.020
the next generation of leaders
like Angeline and Jerome

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.190
and all of you -- leaders in
government and civil society,

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.393
and entrepreneurship
and the private sector.

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:56.395
Four years ago, I
launched an initiative

00:09:56.395 --> 00:09:58.898
called "100,000 Strong
in the Americas."

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.900
And the goal was to
have 100,000 U.S.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.902
students studying
in this region,

00:10:02.902 --> 00:10:05.471
and 100,000 of this
region's students studying

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:07.473
in the United States by
the end of this decade.

00:10:07.473 --> 00:10:10.042
And we are on track
to meet that goal.

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:12.044
So today, to build
on that progress,

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:15.581
I'm proud to launch the Young
Leaders of the Americas

00:10:15.581 --> 00:10:17.850
Initiative right
here in Kingston.

00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.920
(applause)

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:24.023
Let me say this.

00:10:24.023 --> 00:10:26.459
This is not your
traditional exchange.

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:28.761
We're going to seek
out the most innovative

00:10:28.761 --> 00:10:31.030
young entrepreneurs and
civil society leaders

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.468
in the Caribbean, Latin
America, and we're

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:39.271
going to give them a
chance to earn a substantial

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:43.109
continuum of the training
and the resources and the

00:10:43.109 --> 00:10:46.345
connections, the networks and
the capital that you need

00:10:46.345 --> 00:10:48.014
to make a difference.

00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:51.217
So this year, we'll bring two
dozen entrepreneurs and civil

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:54.487
society leaders from Latin
America and the Caribbean --

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:58.024
including young Cuban leaders
-- to the United States.

00:10:58.024 --> 00:11:02.028
(applause)

00:11:02.028 --> 00:11:03.763
Then next year,
we'll increase this

00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:07.900
fellowship to 250
young leaders.

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.503
And we'll help you to expand
your commercial and social

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:13.839
ventures; we'll embed you
in an American business

00:11:13.839 --> 00:11:15.307
and incubators.

00:11:15.307 --> 00:11:17.376
We'll give U.S. participants
the chance to continue

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:22.548
their collaboration with
you in your home countries.

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:26.285
So the idea is that you'll get a
chance to implement your ideas

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:30.156
but now have linkages that
give you access to capital

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:34.126
and research and all the
things you need to mobilize

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:37.997
and implement the kinds of
things that you're doing.

00:11:37.997 --> 00:11:39.632
And this isn't
charity for us.

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.767
This is an investment
in your future,

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:44.970
because that means it's an
investment in our future --

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:48.974
a future where climate
researchers in the Amazon

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:50.976
can collaborate with
scientists in Alaska.

00:11:50.976 --> 00:11:55.247
An idea in Barbados
suddenly can

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:58.951
be developed in an
incubator in Boston.

00:11:58.951 --> 00:12:05.257
Anti-gang activities in
Honduras can be connected

00:12:05.257 --> 00:12:10.796
to similar activities
in Houston, Texas.

00:12:10.796 --> 00:12:13.766
It's a future where any kid
from Kingston can choose

00:12:13.766 --> 00:12:16.769
a path that opens his or
her horizons beyond

00:12:16.769 --> 00:12:20.072
their neighborhood
to the wider world.

00:12:20.072 --> 00:12:21.707
(applause)

00:12:21.707 --> 00:12:25.177
And that impulse
to make the world better,

00:12:25.177 --> 00:12:29.014
to push back on those
who try to make it worse,

00:12:29.014 --> 00:12:31.550
that's something that your
generation has to hold on to.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:33.552
And you have to remember,
it's never easy;

00:12:33.552 --> 00:12:36.555
there are no days off.

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:38.557
But if there's one thing
that I know from my own

00:12:38.557 --> 00:12:43.262
life, it's that with hard
work and with hope,

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:46.599
change is always
within our reach.

00:12:46.599 --> 00:12:49.401
The Jamaican-American
poet Claude McKay,

00:12:49.401 --> 00:12:53.439
who was a central figure
of the Harlem renaissance,

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:57.810
once wrote something along
those lines: "We must strive

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:02.982
on to gain the height although
it may not be in sight."

00:13:02.982 --> 00:13:07.386
As long as we've got young
strivers like you -- and I hope

00:13:07.386 --> 00:13:09.455
to see you in Washington as
part of this Young Leaders

00:13:09.455 --> 00:13:11.957
of the Americas Initiative
-- I'm confident that

00:13:11.957 --> 00:13:13.959
a brighter future will
always be in sight.

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:15.628
So thank you very much.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:18.230
With that, let's
take some questions.

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.733
All right, so --

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:23.502
(applause)

00:13:39.051 --> 00:13:40.219
All right, since
we're getting to work

00:13:40.219 --> 00:13:43.989
I'm going to take my jacket
off and get comfortable.

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:53.199
All right.

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:58.704
There are no rules to this
except that there are

00:13:58.704 --> 00:14:00.706
people with microphones
in the audience,

00:14:00.706 --> 00:14:03.075
so wait for them to
come when I call on you.

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:05.344
We're going to go
boy, girl, boy,

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:09.114
girl so everybody gets
a chance, so it's fair.

00:14:09.114 --> 00:14:11.584
(laughter)

00:14:11.584 --> 00:14:15.020
Before your question,
please introduce yourself

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:18.357
and tell us where
you are from, okay?

00:14:18.357 --> 00:14:21.794
And try to keep your question
or comment relatively short

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:26.265
so we can get more questions
or comments in, okay?

00:14:26.265 --> 00:14:28.367
We'll start with this
young lady right here

00:14:28.367 --> 00:14:30.369
in the white blouse.

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:40.379
It's a little tight here.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.146
Female Speaker: Thank you.

00:14:41.146 --> 00:14:43.716
Yani Campbell (ph), a
lecturer at the University

00:14:43.716 --> 00:14:44.950
of the West Indies.

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.453
Thank you so much for your
talk, very interesting.

00:14:47.453 --> 00:14:50.322
And I wondered as well,
on the Cuban issue,

00:14:50.322 --> 00:14:53.692
now that your policy has
actually changed towards Cuba,

00:14:53.692 --> 00:14:57.363
I wondered about your views
on how it is that we should

00:14:57.363 --> 00:15:00.499
approach -- CARICOM should
approach its relationship

00:15:00.499 --> 00:15:02.968
with Cuba in terms of
deepening that relationship.

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:07.640
Should they now perhaps
move to join in CARICOM?

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:08.641
Thank you.

00:15:08.641 --> 00:15:10.643
President Obama:
Well, first of all,

00:15:10.643 --> 00:15:12.645
I think CARICOM can make
its own decisions

00:15:12.645 --> 00:15:14.647
and we'll respect it.

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:19.752
Cuba will be participating in
the Summit of the Americas,

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:26.959
and I think -- it is my strong
belief that if we engage,

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:30.562
that that offers the
greatest prospect for

00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:34.400
escaping some of the
constraints of the past.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.469
I think the Cuban people
are extraordinary

00:15:37.469 --> 00:15:39.538
and have huge potential.

00:15:39.538 --> 00:15:43.642
And what's encouraging is, is
that the overwhelming majority

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:48.580
of Cubans are interested
in ending the Cold War --

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.351
the last vestige of the Cold
War -- and moving forward.

00:15:52.351 --> 00:15:53.752
It's going to take
some time for

00:15:53.752 --> 00:15:57.823
the United States to
fully implement some

00:15:57.823 --> 00:15:59.558
of the things that have
already been agreed to,

00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:03.562
and it's going to take a
little bit longer before

00:16:03.562 --> 00:16:05.564
you actually have
complete normal relations

00:16:05.564 --> 00:16:08.567
between the United
States and Cuba.

00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:12.438
What I would say to Caribbean
countries is, absolutely,

00:16:12.438 --> 00:16:14.606
you should continue to engage
in Cuba in the ways that

00:16:14.606 --> 00:16:18.577
you've already doing -- you've
already done in the past.

00:16:18.577 --> 00:16:21.380
I do think that it
is important for all

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:30.856
of us to be able to speak
honestly where we see concerns

00:16:30.856 --> 00:16:34.626
about issues of human rights
and political freedom.

00:16:34.626 --> 00:16:36.662
And I'm not saying
anything publicly that

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:41.133
I haven't said directly
to Raul Castro.

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:43.135
There are still
constraints on the ability

00:16:43.135 --> 00:16:46.939
of the Cuban people to express
themselves, or to organize

00:16:46.939 --> 00:16:51.643
political parties, or
to start a business.

00:16:51.643 --> 00:16:58.550
And sometimes, the same
things we expect for

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:00.552
ourselves and our country,
somehow we think other

00:17:00.552 --> 00:17:01.553
people don't want.

00:17:01.553 --> 00:17:08.894
But I believe that each
country -- I believe

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:11.230
each country has its
own unique cultures,

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:12.498
its own unique traditions.

00:17:12.498 --> 00:17:15.834
I don't expect every
country to pursue the same

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:18.303
policies or have the
same political practices

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:19.304
as the United States.

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:24.910
And I am certainly aware
of the flaws that exist

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:27.513
in our own country
that we have to fix.

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:31.316
But I do believe there
are certain principles

00:17:31.316 --> 00:17:34.086
that are universal.

00:17:34.086 --> 00:17:39.258
I think that all people want
basic dignity and want basic

00:17:39.258 --> 00:17:44.463
freedom, and want to be able to
worship as they please without

00:17:44.463 --> 00:17:47.232
being discriminated against,
or they should be able

00:17:47.232 --> 00:17:51.570
to speak their mind about an
important issue pertaining

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.572
to their community
without being arrested.

00:17:53.572 --> 00:18:00.546
And so wherever we see
that, we try to speak out.

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:07.085
But what we also try to do is
engage and recognize that

00:18:07.085 --> 00:18:10.456
even with countries that
we have differences,

00:18:10.456 --> 00:18:13.392
there's also going to be
commonality and overlap.

00:18:13.392 --> 00:18:16.395
And the United States and Cuba
should both have an interest

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:18.997
in dealing with climate
change, for example,

00:18:18.997 --> 00:18:24.136
because when the oceans
start lapping upon Miami

00:18:24.136 --> 00:18:29.341
or on Havana, nobody is
going to distinguish, well,

00:18:29.341 --> 00:18:33.145
where do they stand on this
or that ideological issue.

00:18:33.145 --> 00:18:37.049
And so we have to find where
there are areas of cooperation,

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:39.751
but I will continue to try
to be consistent

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:42.921
in speaking out on behalf
of the issues that are

00:18:42.921 --> 00:18:45.991
important to all
people, not just some.

00:18:45.991 --> 00:18:49.495
All right, it's a
gentleman's turn.

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:53.098
This gentleman
right here.

00:18:53.098 --> 00:18:56.201
He looks very serious;
he's got glasses.

00:18:56.201 --> 00:18:58.203
Looking sharp.

00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:02.307
Plus, he's got a
copy of my book.

00:19:02.307 --> 00:19:04.209
(laughter)

00:19:04.209 --> 00:19:05.944
So he's
clearly a wise man.

00:19:05.944 --> 00:19:07.746
Male Speaker: Thank
you very much.

00:19:07.746 --> 00:19:09.281
My name is Chef
Brian Lumley --

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:11.550
I'm a young
Jamaican chef here.

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:14.486
(applause)

00:19:14.486 --> 00:19:15.787
And I own a
restaurant --

00:19:15.787 --> 00:19:17.155
689 by Brian Lumley.

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:18.624
(laughter)

00:19:18.624 --> 00:19:20.359
Just saying.

00:19:20.359 --> 00:19:22.461
My question to you --
I'm going to stay

00:19:22.461 --> 00:19:24.229
a little bit off the
politics for a bit.

00:19:24.229 --> 00:19:25.898
And I've witnessed
your journey a lot,

00:19:25.898 --> 00:19:27.766
and the question is
kind of two-part.

00:19:27.766 --> 00:19:30.536
If you go back and give
yourself one piece of advice

00:19:30.536 --> 00:19:33.906
before the start of you 2008
term, what would it be?

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:35.974
And the second part is if
you can sign this book

00:19:35.974 --> 00:19:36.942
when you're finished.

00:19:36.942 --> 00:19:38.510
(laughter)

00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:39.378
Thank you very much.

00:19:39.378 --> 00:19:41.480
President Obama:
I'll sign the book.

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.050
So the question was, for those
couldn't hear: If I were to go

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:52.324
back and give myself advice
before I started in 2008,

00:19:52.324 --> 00:19:54.326
what would the advice be?

00:19:57.162 --> 00:20:00.032
I suppose I could have started
dying my hair earlier --

00:20:00.032 --> 00:20:01.533
(laughter)

00:20:01.533 --> 00:20:04.002
-- so then people
wouldn't say, man,

00:20:04.002 --> 00:20:06.004
he's getting old.

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:10.175
You're going like this --
at least I got hair, man.

00:20:10.175 --> 00:20:11.877
(laughter)

00:20:11.877 --> 00:20:13.745
I'm teasing you.

00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:16.315
I'm messing with you.

00:20:20.052 --> 00:20:24.156
I think that -- keep in mind
that when I came into office

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:28.093
we were going through the worst
global financial crisis since

00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:32.197
the 1930s, and so we had to
make a series of decisions

00:20:32.197 --> 00:20:35.567
very quickly, many of
which were unpopular.

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:41.473
Overall, I think
we got it right.

00:20:41.473 --> 00:20:42.474
I think we did the
right thing.

00:20:42.474 --> 00:20:48.547
And because, I think,
we took these steps,

00:20:48.547 --> 00:20:52.951
not only were we able to avoid
the kind of Great Depression

00:20:52.951 --> 00:20:59.091
that we saw in the 1930s, not
only was America able to bounce

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:03.261
back and start growing more
rapidly than most of our peers,

00:21:03.261 --> 00:21:08.133
drive down unemployment faster,
create more jobs faster,

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:10.902
but that also had an impact
on the global economy

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:12.904
and it had an impact on
the Caribbean economy,

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:15.607
that we were able to bounce
back quicker than we might

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:18.510
have if we hadn't
taken those steps.

00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:24.383
But it was, I think,
costly politically.

00:21:24.383 --> 00:21:30.088
And what I would have probably
advised was that I might have

00:21:30.088 --> 00:21:34.926
needed to warn the American
people and paint a picture

00:21:34.926 --> 00:21:39.631
for them that was more
accurate about the fact that

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:41.633
it would take some time
to dig ourselves out

00:21:41.633 --> 00:21:44.102
of a very big hole.

00:21:44.102 --> 00:21:50.275
Because FDR, when
he came into office,

00:21:50.275 --> 00:21:54.112
the Great Depression had
already been going on for two,

00:21:54.112 --> 00:22:00.352
three years, and so people
understood how serious it was.

00:22:00.352 --> 00:22:02.654
With us, we came in just
as people were really

00:22:02.654 --> 00:22:04.489
starting to feel
the impacts.

00:22:04.489 --> 00:22:07.826
And trying to paint a picture
that we'll make it but it's

00:22:07.826 --> 00:22:10.762
going to take some time, and
here are the steps that we need

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:16.635
to take -- I think I would have
advised myself to do a better

00:22:16.635 --> 00:22:20.405
job spending more time not
just getting the policy right,

00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:25.377
but also describing it in
ways that people understood,

00:22:25.377 --> 00:22:28.180
that gave them confidence
in their own future.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:31.149
I think that would probably
be the most important

00:22:31.149 --> 00:22:34.352
advice that I would
have given myself.

00:22:34.352 --> 00:22:37.522
(applause)

00:22:37.522 --> 00:22:40.625
All right, it's a
young lady's turn.

00:22:40.625 --> 00:22:41.993
That young lady
right there.

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:43.695
Yes, you.

00:22:43.695 --> 00:22:44.996
You, yes.

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:47.866
Oh, well, I'll call
on both of you.

00:22:47.866 --> 00:22:48.700
I'll call on you later.

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:49.434
Go ahead.

00:22:49.434 --> 00:22:51.036
Female Speaker: Okay, so
we're here and we're looking

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.438
at you, and we're all
very honored to be here

00:22:53.438 --> 00:22:57.209
and very taken about by
your leadership qualities.

00:22:57.209 --> 00:22:59.845
And seeing that you are the
President of the United States

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:01.847
of America and you're
so influential,

00:23:01.847 --> 00:23:04.349
I want to know how you
handle the mental strain

00:23:04.349 --> 00:23:06.952
that comes with being
in charge of so much.

00:23:06.952 --> 00:23:08.653
President Obama:
What's your name?

00:23:08.653 --> 00:23:11.289
Female Speaker: Kimberly
-- from the University

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:13.091
of the West Indies.

00:23:13.091 --> 00:23:15.393
President Obama: Fantastic.

00:23:15.393 --> 00:23:18.029
How do I handle stress?

00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:24.870
You know, I'll be
honest with you.

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.472
One of the things that happens
as you get older is you start

00:23:27.472 --> 00:23:31.276
appreciating both your
strengths and your weaknesses.

00:23:31.276 --> 00:23:34.579
Hopefully you gain a
little wisdom about what

00:23:34.579 --> 00:23:36.581
you're good at and
what you're not.

00:23:36.581 --> 00:23:39.084
And Michelle can give you
a long list of things

00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:40.252
I'm not good at.

00:23:40.252 --> 00:23:41.753
(laughter)

00:23:41.753 --> 00:23:44.689
But one thing
that I've always had,

00:23:44.689 --> 00:23:49.461
which has served me well, is
a pretty good temperament.

00:23:49.461 --> 00:23:52.130
And I attribute that partly
from growing up on an island

00:23:52.130 --> 00:23:55.667
with trade winds and beaches,
and it makes you calm.

00:23:59.237 --> 00:24:05.544
But I try not to get too high
when things are going well

00:24:05.544 --> 00:24:07.679
so that I don't get too low
when things are going badly,

00:24:10.448 --> 00:24:16.755
and try to keep a long view
of how the process

00:24:16.755 --> 00:24:22.427
of social change takes place,
and how the trajectory

00:24:22.427 --> 00:24:25.697
of your own life is
going to proceed.

00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:29.100
We get caught up in the
day-to-day so much,

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:33.171
and it's interesting now when
I'm talking to my daughters

00:24:33.171 --> 00:24:37.776
and "somebody said something
at school," or there's --

00:24:37.776 --> 00:24:41.446
"well, I didn't do quite as
well on that test as I wanted."

00:24:41.446 --> 00:24:43.582
And you want them to
take it seriously,

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:46.585
but you also want to say to
them, you know what, this,

00:24:46.585 --> 00:24:52.324
too, shall pass; I promise
you three months from now,

00:24:52.324 --> 00:24:54.726
much less 30 years from
now, you will not remember.

00:24:57.229 --> 00:25:01.132
And so I think that trying to
keep your eye on the prize

00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:06.304
of where it is that
you want to go and not

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:11.509
be discouraged or overly
impressed with yourself

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:14.446
on a day-to-day basis I
think is very important.

00:25:14.446 --> 00:25:18.316
And then you have to get some
exercise in the morning.

00:25:18.316 --> 00:25:19.951
(laughter)

00:25:19.951 --> 00:25:23.255
I don't run
as fast as these folks,

00:25:23.255 --> 00:25:27.626
but I get a little exercise,
which does help in terms

00:25:27.626 --> 00:25:28.760
of stress relief.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.761
All right.

00:25:29.761 --> 00:25:32.030
It's a gentleman's turn.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.099
Let's see, somebody
from this side.

00:25:34.099 --> 00:25:36.668
This young man right here
in the sharp-looking

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:37.669
checkered shirt.

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:43.675
Male Speaker: Good afternoon
again, Mr. President.

00:25:46.044 --> 00:25:48.046
Especially as it
relates to human rights

00:25:48.046 --> 00:25:50.548
and social change -- I'm
Jomain McKenzie and I'm

00:25:50.548 --> 00:25:53.818
a focal point with the
Global Fund Board.

00:25:53.818 --> 00:25:55.820
As it relates to human
rights and social change,

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.657
how do you make the decision to
allow societies to go through

00:25:58.657 --> 00:26:03.695
the natural evolutionary
process of having change occur

00:26:03.695 --> 00:26:08.533
on their own versus having
governments exert policies

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:11.336
to make these same
political social changes?

00:26:11.336 --> 00:26:14.506
President Obama: That's a
really interesting question.

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:16.508
It's an interesting
question and it's one

00:26:16.508 --> 00:26:19.010
that I have to struggle
with all the time.

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.950
Every society, as I said,
is at a different phase

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:28.186
in development, in
their own history;

00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:31.323
they have different
cultural traditions.

00:26:31.323 --> 00:26:39.164
And so the way I
think about it is,

00:26:39.164 --> 00:26:42.667
is that the United States
has certain core values and

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:50.175
principles that we
believe deeply in.

00:26:50.175 --> 00:26:56.181
And we don't necessarily
expect that every country will

00:27:00.018 --> 00:27:06.024
formulate how to secure those
ideals and those principles.

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:14.099
We don't expect it to be done
exactly as we do any more

00:27:14.099 --> 00:27:17.068
than we expect every --
obviously, our democracy

00:27:17.068 --> 00:27:19.504
is not the same as
aJamaican democracy

00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:22.374
or a British democracy
or Australian democracy.

00:27:22.374 --> 00:27:24.042
But we believe in democracy.

00:27:24.042 --> 00:27:29.581
We think that if people
have the ability to speak

00:27:29.581 --> 00:27:32.283
out about their own lives,
some sense of agency,

00:27:32.283 --> 00:27:34.886
then that society
will be stronger.

00:27:34.886 --> 00:27:41.793
And that doesn't mean that we
won't work with a country

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:46.131
that doesn't precisely
abide by those principles,

00:27:46.131 --> 00:27:49.634
but we will still speak out.

00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:55.073
There are times where a
country is clearly engaging in

00:27:55.073 --> 00:27:59.677
activities that are so egregious
that it's not culturally

00:27:59.677 --> 00:28:01.980
specific; it typically has to
do with a government wanting

00:28:01.980 --> 00:28:06.351
to exert control over
people and oppress them.

00:28:06.351 --> 00:28:09.821
And in those instances, I think
it is entirely appropriate

00:28:09.821 --> 00:28:13.925
for us to speak out
forcefully and, in some

00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:17.295
cases, to not do
business with them.

00:28:17.295 --> 00:28:22.000
Look at a country
like North Korea.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.638
I mean, obviously, Korean
culture is different than

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:28.640
American culture.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.009
On the other hand, you look at
what's happening in South Korea

00:28:31.009 --> 00:28:33.011
and you look at what's
happening in North Korea

00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:35.013
and those are two entirely
different societies.

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:39.050
And I can tell you which
one you'd rather live in.

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.119
And if you have a
situation in which people

00:28:41.119 --> 00:28:46.825
are being murdered simply
because they didn't

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:48.827
agree with the
government on something

00:28:48.827 --> 00:28:54.332
or didn't want their
economic fate to be entirely

00:28:54.332 --> 00:28:58.036
determined by the whims of
some government bureaucrat,

00:28:58.036 --> 00:29:03.942
and suddenly they're sent to
a labor camp --

00:29:03.942 --> 00:29:07.445
that's something where we as
an international community

00:29:07.445 --> 00:29:09.614
have to speak out on.

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:14.552
And then there are some
issues that may be culturally

00:29:14.552 --> 00:29:18.490
specific, but you know what,
I think they're wrong.

00:29:18.490 --> 00:29:22.393
I won't -- we're not going to
try to force that country

00:29:22.393 --> 00:29:26.931
to change, but I may try
to shame that country.

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:29.234
There are nations where
slavery still exists.

00:29:29.234 --> 00:29:35.240
And that may be part of
the ancient culture

00:29:37.475 --> 00:29:42.113
in that society, but
slavery is wrong.

00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:45.783
And I'm not going to
give them the excuse

00:29:45.783 --> 00:29:50.255
that, well, this
is who we are.

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:55.326
In Africa -- and I can speak
I think fairly as somebody

00:29:55.326 --> 00:29:59.998
who is the son of an African
father -- there are practices

00:29:59.998 --> 00:30:03.568
like female genital
mutilation that may be part

00:30:03.568 --> 00:30:07.939
of the tradition there,
but it's wrong.

00:30:07.939 --> 00:30:10.942
And I'm going to say so.

00:30:10.942 --> 00:30:13.211
And it will be U.S. policy
to say that it's wrong.

00:30:13.211 --> 00:30:19.684
So the tools we use to try
to bring about change

00:30:19.684 --> 00:30:22.320
around the world
may vary.

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:26.457
And as I said earlier, we're not
always perfectly consistent.

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:30.895
There are times where we've got
allies who are not observing

00:30:30.895 --> 00:30:34.666
all the human rights we would
like, and there are times

00:30:34.666 --> 00:30:39.103
where there are countries
that are adversaries

00:30:39.103 --> 00:30:41.839
of ours where they do
some things quite well.

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:48.646
And you can't expect
us, or any country,

00:30:48.646 --> 00:30:51.916
to be perfectly consistent
in every circumstance.

00:30:51.916 --> 00:30:54.719
But what I've tried to do is
be fairly consistent

00:30:54.719 --> 00:30:58.356
in terms of what we
believe, what we stand for,

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:01.025
and then we use different
tools depending on what

00:31:01.025 --> 00:31:03.628
we think will bring
about the most change.

00:31:03.628 --> 00:31:06.264
In some cases, it will just
be a diplomatic statement;

00:31:06.264 --> 00:31:14.005
in some cases, it may be serious
enough that we will organize --

00:31:14.005 --> 00:31:16.674
try to organize the United
Nations or other multilateral

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:19.444
forums to speak out
against certain practices.

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:22.513
In some cases, it may be so
egregious that we need to

00:31:22.513 --> 00:31:25.750
sanction them, and we will try
to organize the international

00:31:25.750 --> 00:31:28.219
community in that way.

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:31.022
And then finally, in the
ultimate circumstance,

00:31:31.022 --> 00:31:35.893
where the violations of our
values are so severe that they

00:31:35.893 --> 00:31:39.797
start spilling over and -- in
the instance of, for example,

00:31:39.797 --> 00:31:44.569
genocide -- we may
be say to ourselves,

00:31:44.569 --> 00:31:46.571
in concert with the
international community,

00:31:46.571 --> 00:31:51.376
we need to intervene because
this government is so brutal

00:31:51.376 --> 00:31:56.581
and so unacceptable that we
need to protect people.

00:31:56.581 --> 00:31:59.684
But we do that in the
context of an international

00:31:59.684 --> 00:32:02.754
conversation so that
we're not simply making

00:32:02.754 --> 00:32:10.228
these decisions -- or
we're not so arrogant

00:32:10.228 --> 00:32:13.431
that we're not paying
attention to what

00:32:13.431 --> 00:32:18.102
the rest of the world
community is saying.

00:32:18.603 --> 00:32:20.605
This young lady who I
originally had called

00:32:20.605 --> 00:32:22.607
on and got
skipped over.

00:32:22.607 --> 00:32:24.742
No, no, this
one right here.

00:32:24.742 --> 00:32:25.810
Yes.

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.612
Right here.

00:32:27.612 --> 00:32:28.880
I'm sorry, I love
you, too, though.

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.283
(laughter)

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:33.284
Female Speaker: Good
afternoon, Mr. President.

00:32:33.284 --> 00:32:34.519
My name is Katrina
King-Smith.

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:36.521
I'm from the Turks
and Caicos Islands.

00:32:36.521 --> 00:32:38.523
My question is
two-part, as well.

00:32:38.523 --> 00:32:40.825
Firstly, in countries such as
the Turks and Caicos Islands

00:32:40.825 --> 00:32:43.294
where the population is
small and our main sources

00:32:43.294 --> 00:32:46.497
of revenue are tourism and
foreign direct investment,

00:32:46.497 --> 00:32:49.067
I was wondering if you can
suggest two ways that the

00:32:49.067 --> 00:32:52.603
government may better generate
and regulate sustainable

00:32:52.603 --> 00:32:55.540
revenue, especially with
regulations currently being

00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.811
put in place to close
off-shore financial centers.

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:03.381
And secondly, I was wondering
if after your term has ended,

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:06.384
would you mind coming to the
Turks and Caicos to vacation?

00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:08.152
(laughter)

00:33:08.152 --> 00:33:11.789
President Obama: On the
second question, absolutely.

00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:14.726
(laughter)

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.362
I'll do some
island-hopping once

00:33:17.362 --> 00:33:19.697
I'm out of office.

00:33:19.697 --> 00:33:22.867
And you guys can show me
all the good places to go.

00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:25.236
(applause)

00:33:29.974 --> 00:33:33.745
On this issue of
off-shore financial centers,

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:37.382
we respect each country
to set up its own

00:33:37.382 --> 00:33:39.951
financial regulations.

00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:44.288
And we recognize that
for small countries,

00:33:44.288 --> 00:33:47.859
that providing services --
including financial services --

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:50.395
may be an important
source of revenue.

00:33:52.563 --> 00:33:57.034
The one thing that we have to
make sure of is that these

00:33:57.034 --> 00:34:01.139
financial centers are not
either used for illicit

00:34:01.139 --> 00:34:07.211
money laundering or tax
avoidance by large U.S.

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:13.184
corporations that set
up cut-outs or front

00:34:15.586 --> 00:34:21.926
organizations, but as a
practical matter are operating

00:34:21.926 --> 00:34:25.062
in the United States, employing
folks in the United States,

00:34:25.062 --> 00:34:27.064
essentially headquartered in
the United States and yet,

00:34:27.064 --> 00:34:32.203
somehow, their mailing
address is such-and-such

00:34:32.203 --> 00:34:36.774
island where they
have to pay no taxes.

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:40.344
Those are the kinds of
egregious concerns that we're

00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:42.547
trying to deal with.

00:34:42.547 --> 00:34:45.116
I think we try to take it
on a case-by-case basis.

00:34:45.116 --> 00:34:48.419
And in my CARICOM
meeting that I just had,

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:50.121
this issue was brought up.

00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:52.723
There were a number of leaders
who expressed concern that

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:59.363
maybe they were being
unfairly labeled as areas

00:34:59.363 --> 00:35:01.065
of high financial risk.

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:05.570
And what I committed to them
is we will examine their

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:10.775
complaints and go through in
very concrete ways where our

00:35:10.775 --> 00:35:13.244
concerns are and how our
governments can work together.

00:35:17.415 --> 00:35:23.120
More broadly, I think that
the -- if you look at some

00:35:23.120 --> 00:35:26.023
of the most successful
countries in the world,

00:35:26.023 --> 00:35:29.093
they're actually pretty small
countries -- like Singapore,

00:35:29.093 --> 00:35:35.299
for example -- that on paper
look like they have no assets,

00:35:35.299 --> 00:35:37.568
and yet, if you go to
Singapore, it has one

00:35:37.568 --> 00:35:41.506
of the highest standards
of living in the world.

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:46.644
What is it that Singapore did
that might be replicable?

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:52.517
Well, one of the most
important things they did was

00:35:52.517 --> 00:35:55.920
they made an enormous
investment in their people.

00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.255
(applause)

00:35:57.255 --> 00:36:00.057
And if you've
got a highly skilled,

00:36:00.958 --> 00:36:08.165
highly educated workforce, if
you've set up rules of law

00:36:08.165 --> 00:36:14.071
and governance that are
transparent and non-corrupt,

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:19.043
then you can attract actually
a lot of service industries

00:36:19.043 --> 00:36:22.647
to supplement the tourist
industry, because people

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:27.318
would want to locate
in your country.

00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:30.988
You could envision people
wanting to operate and have

00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:34.392
offices there where you've
got a trained workforce.

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:36.794
And these days, so many
businesses are operating over

00:36:36.794 --> 00:36:45.536
the Internet that if you've
got a really skilled workforce

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:48.839
that provides value
added, you will attract

00:36:48.839 --> 00:36:51.576
companies and you'll
attract businesses.

00:36:51.576 --> 00:36:57.815
What deters people from
investing in most countries is

00:36:57.815 --> 00:37:03.821
conflict, corruption, and a lack
of skills or infrastructure.

00:37:06.857 --> 00:37:09.527
And those countries that
are able to address those

00:37:09.527 --> 00:37:15.700
problems have rule of law
and eliminate corruption.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:20.671
Make sure that you are investing
in the education of your people

00:37:20.671 --> 00:37:22.707
and it's a continuous
education; it doesn't just

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:26.277
stop at the lower grades,
but you give people

00:37:26.277 --> 00:37:29.246
constant opportunities
to upgrade their skills.

00:37:29.246 --> 00:37:35.319
You have a decent
infrastructure -- you're going

00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:37.555
to be able to succeed.

00:37:37.555 --> 00:37:41.592
That's the recipe, the formula
for a 21st-century economy.

00:37:41.592 --> 00:37:44.295
All right.

00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:47.298
Uh oh, they're starting
to holler at me.

00:37:47.298 --> 00:37:49.500
(laughter)

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:53.304
Let's see, I haven't
gone back here in a while.

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:57.808
This gentleman in the
blue shirt right here.

00:38:05.216 --> 00:38:06.917
Male Speaker: Thanks
so much, Mr. President.

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:10.454
We know that there's been
an increasing military

00:38:10.454 --> 00:38:12.256
assertiveness of
China, especially

00:38:12.256 --> 00:38:13.557
in the South China Sea.

00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:15.226
And it seems that the
U.S. has responded

00:38:15.226 --> 00:38:17.628
to that by pledging
to increase its military

00:38:17.628 --> 00:38:19.597
presence because it
recognizes the danger that

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:22.466
that military increase of
China poses to its friends

00:38:22.466 --> 00:38:23.768
and allies there.

00:38:23.768 --> 00:38:26.837
Now, China's growing power isn't
just military, it's economic.

00:38:26.837 --> 00:38:29.273
On this side of the world,
China has used this soft power,

00:38:29.273 --> 00:38:32.410
this economic power especially
to woo Caribbean governments.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:36.080
My questions are,
how does the U.S.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.583
view China's influence
in its own backyard,

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:41.419
especially since you've just
talked about the Cold War

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:42.353
and alliances?

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:45.189
And secondly, what
plan does the U.S. have,

00:38:45.189 --> 00:38:48.659
if any, to contribute
more to economic life

00:38:48.659 --> 00:38:50.895
in the Caribbean to
ward off China in terms

00:38:50.895 --> 00:38:52.329
of foreign direct
investment?

00:38:52.329 --> 00:38:54.965
(applause)

00:38:55.499 --> 00:38:56.967
Thank you very much,
Mr. President.

00:38:56.967 --> 00:38:58.369
President Obama:
What's your name?

00:38:58.369 --> 00:38:59.437
Male Speaker: Oh, sorry.

00:38:59.437 --> 00:39:01.439
My name is Newton Harris
from the University of

00:39:01.439 --> 00:39:02.406
Technology-Jamaica.

00:39:02.406 --> 00:39:03.874
(applause)

00:39:03.874 --> 00:39:05.176
President Obama: Fantastic.

00:39:07.278 --> 00:39:10.414
Well, first of all, let
me say that it is U.S.

00:39:10.414 --> 00:39:14.485
official policy and it
is my strong belief that

00:39:14.485 --> 00:39:17.121
we should welcome
China's peaceful rise.

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:22.426
What China has done in the last
20, 30 years is remarkable.

00:39:22.426 --> 00:39:25.329
More people have been lifted
out of poverty in a shorter

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:28.899
period of time than perhaps
any time in human history.

00:39:28.899 --> 00:39:30.167
(applause)

00:39:30.167 --> 00:39:32.336
And that's
good for the world.

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:35.139
I mean, we should be more
fearful of a poorer,

00:39:35.139 --> 00:39:40.911
collapsing China than a China
that is participating in the

00:39:40.911 --> 00:39:47.017
world marketplace and trading
and is getting along with

00:39:47.017 --> 00:39:49.053
its neighbors and part of
the international order,

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:51.989
because there are a really
large number of Chinese

00:39:51.989 --> 00:39:56.594
people and we want
them to be doing well.

00:39:56.594 --> 00:40:02.166
So our policy is not to
fear China's peaceful rise.

00:40:02.166 --> 00:40:08.405
Where we get concerned with
China is where it is not

00:40:08.405 --> 00:40:13.677
necessarily abiding by
international norms and rules,

00:40:13.677 --> 00:40:19.683
and is using its size and
muscle to force countries

00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.022
into subordinate positions.

00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:28.092
And that's the concern we
have around maritime issues.

00:40:28.092 --> 00:40:30.227
We think this can be
solved diplomatically,

00:40:30.227 --> 00:40:33.998
but just because the
Philippines or Vietnam are

00:40:33.998 --> 00:40:39.036
not as large as China
doesn't mean that they

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:41.672
can just be
elbowed aside.

00:40:41.672 --> 00:40:45.009
And, by the way, we don't
have a particular view

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:48.279
on the territorial disputes,
the maritime disputes.

00:40:48.279 --> 00:40:50.915
Our attitude is simply,
let's use the mechanisms

00:40:50.915 --> 00:40:52.983
that we have in place
internationally

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.585
to resolve them.

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:59.056
Now, with respect to Chinese
investment in the Caribbean

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:02.693
or in the Americas, in
the Western Hemisphere,

00:41:02.693 --> 00:41:05.262
my response is the same one
that I gave when I was asked

00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:11.335
this question in Africa,
which is, if China is making

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:14.638
investments that are building
up infrastructure, or improving

00:41:14.638 --> 00:41:22.279
education, or helping the
people, then we welcome that.

00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:23.414
We think that's great.

00:41:23.414 --> 00:41:26.951
The only thing is you
got to make sure you

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:28.953
look at what strings
may be attached.

00:41:31.589 --> 00:41:35.059
If the investments are made
and it's solely to build

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:41.632
a road to a mine to extract
raw materials that are

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:43.767
going to then be
immediately going

00:41:43.767 --> 00:41:46.570
to a port and
shipped to China,

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:51.775
and if Chinese workers are
shipped in to build the road --

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:55.646
(applause)

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:59.250
-- and if you don't know
exactly what the deal was

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:02.219
with the government that led to
China getting the contract --

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:05.756
(applause)

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:09.994
-- in those situations,
it may not be, in fact,

00:42:09.994 --> 00:42:13.264
serving the long-term
interests of the country.

00:42:13.264 --> 00:42:15.366
Now, I would say -- by
the way, I'd say the same

00:42:15.366 --> 00:42:17.668
thing about the
United States.

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:20.004
So if we come in with an
aid package to your

00:42:20.004 --> 00:42:22.806
country, and we say we
got this great deal,

00:42:22.806 --> 00:42:28.612
we're going to give you $100
million for such and such,

00:42:28.612 --> 00:42:32.583
but if when you evaluate
the actual benefits,

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:36.854
it's U.S. companies that are
disproportionately benefitting

00:42:36.854 --> 00:42:40.524
from it, and it's creating a
situation where over the long

00:42:40.524 --> 00:42:44.495
term the United States is
making a whole lot of profits

00:42:44.495 --> 00:42:48.933
but is not leaving behind a
sustainable industrial base

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:53.771
or ways in which that country
can develop, then you

00:42:53.771 --> 00:42:56.640
have to evaluate that and
try to get a better deal.

00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:58.909
So what I'm saying is
not unique to China.

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:04.181
I think that's how all
countries should be operating.

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:07.184
Your government
should be transparent;

00:43:07.184 --> 00:43:12.289
it should be clear about
what you're getting.

00:43:12.289 --> 00:43:15.726
There should be an accounting
of how the money flows.

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:16.927
(applause)

00:43:16.927 --> 00:43:25.436
There should be a sense
that over the long term,

00:43:25.436 --> 00:43:32.943
Jamaican businesses or
somebody from Belize

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:35.212
is getting a job,
or -- right?

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:37.214
I mean, there should be
some sense of how is this

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:40.050
benefitting us over
the long term.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.519
And that's I think the
only criteria that we're

00:43:42.519 --> 00:43:43.520
going to lay out.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:45.522
Now, last thing I'll say
-- because you asked --

00:43:45.522 --> 00:43:47.758
you kind of posed, is there
like a bidding war going

00:43:47.758 --> 00:43:49.360
on here for affections.

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:52.496
The Chinese are giving us
flowers and chocolates --

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:55.466
(laughter)

00:43:55.466 --> 00:43:57.067
-- what are you
doing for us lately?

00:43:57.067 --> 00:43:59.403
(laughter)

00:43:59.403 --> 00:44:01.271
And so what
I would say is this.

00:44:01.271 --> 00:44:05.843
The United States, I
think historically,

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:10.481
has been an enormous
provider of development aid.

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:15.152
Not always, by the way, has it
followed the rule I just laid

00:44:15.152 --> 00:44:18.889
out in terms of whether or
not the local recipients are

00:44:18.889 --> 00:44:21.592
benefitting, but I think we've
gotten a lot better at that.

00:44:23.627 --> 00:44:26.697
And if you look at
institutions like

00:44:26.697 --> 00:44:30.801
the World Bank or other
multilateral institutions,

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:33.404
we remain the largest
contributors by far.

00:44:33.404 --> 00:44:37.741
So sometimes when you get money
from a multilateral institution

00:44:37.741 --> 00:44:41.779
-- you look at who's doing
what; if you look at what

00:44:41.779 --> 00:44:46.550
happens in terms of when
Haiti gets decimated,

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:51.155
who's raising the money --
we tend to look pretty good.

00:44:51.155 --> 00:44:55.626
It turns out we're doing
more than our fair share.

00:44:55.626 --> 00:44:58.195
And we will continue
to do that.

00:44:58.195 --> 00:45:01.331
We do have some
fiscal constraints.

00:45:01.331 --> 00:45:08.072
And sometimes, I think --
when I travel to the Americas,

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:11.975
to the region, people ask,
why don't we have sort

00:45:11.975 --> 00:45:19.216
of the kinds of Alliance
for Progress programs with

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:21.385
huge sums of money.

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:27.224
Well, part of it is, is that
right after World War II,

00:45:27.224 --> 00:45:30.594
the United States was so
large relative to the rest

00:45:30.594 --> 00:45:32.596
of the world.

00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:36.266
Japan was decimated;
Europe was decimated.

00:45:38.702 --> 00:45:41.738
Huge chunks of the world were
behind the Iron Curtain.

00:45:41.738 --> 00:45:47.945
And so it was natural that
we gave fivefold

00:45:47.945 --> 00:45:50.981
or tenfold more than
anybody else could do.

00:45:50.981 --> 00:45:54.251
Well, things have evened out,
in case you haven't noticed.

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:56.653
We're still, by far, the most
powerful nation on Earth

00:45:56.653 --> 00:45:58.722
and we still do more
than everybody else,

00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:03.994
but we do expect others to step
up and do their fair share.

00:46:03.994 --> 00:46:07.764
But I can guarantee you this: We
will always do our fair share.

00:46:07.764 --> 00:46:10.767
And nowhere is that truer than
in the Caribbean and in the

00:46:10.767 --> 00:46:13.837
Americas, because you are
our neighbors and some

00:46:13.837 --> 00:46:15.572
of our closest friends.

00:46:15.572 --> 00:46:18.342
(applause)

00:46:19.810 --> 00:46:21.211
Let's see.

00:46:21.211 --> 00:46:23.614
It's a young lady's turn.

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:25.115
This young lady right here.

00:46:25.115 --> 00:46:27.284
Right here.

00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:38.028
Female Speaker:
Welcome, Mr. President.

00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:40.631
I lived a block away
from you in Chicago when

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:42.299
I went to the
University of Chicago.

00:46:42.299 --> 00:46:43.300
President Obama:
Is that right?

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:45.569
Female Speaker: And my
college sweetheart, Sam Kass,

00:46:45.569 --> 00:46:47.938
was your private chef
until very recently.

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:49.206
President Obama: Oh, wow!

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:50.274
(laughter)

00:46:50.274 --> 00:46:51.375
Well, you're just
putting Sam's business

00:46:51.375 --> 00:46:52.242
all out there.

00:46:52.242 --> 00:46:54.278
(laughter)

00:46:54.278 --> 00:46:54.745
All right.

00:46:54.745 --> 00:46:55.412
What's your name?

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:56.680
Female Speaker:
Lisandra Rickards.

00:46:56.680 --> 00:46:59.082
I work for the Branson
Centre of Entrepreneurship.

00:46:59.082 --> 00:46:59.850
President Obama: Cassandra?

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:01.018
Female Speaker: Lisandra.

00:47:01.018 --> 00:47:01.752
President Obama: Lisandra.

00:47:01.752 --> 00:47:02.486
All right.

00:47:02.486 --> 00:47:04.021
Well, I'll tease
Sam about this one.

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.122
(laughter)

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:05.822
Female Speaker: Please do.

00:47:05.822 --> 00:47:06.623
(laughter)

00:47:06.623 --> 00:47:07.824
President Obama: Everybody
knows about you now.

00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:08.959
Go ahead.

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:11.662
Female Speaker: My question
is around immigration.

00:47:11.662 --> 00:47:15.499
We've heard a lot about
your immigration policy for

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:18.702
undocumented immigrants who are
currently living in the U.S.

00:47:18.702 --> 00:47:21.572
But what about hopeful
families that are seeking

00:47:21.572 --> 00:47:24.308
a legal pathway for
immigration into the U.S.

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:27.411
but are finding seven- to
ten-year delays before they

00:47:27.411 --> 00:47:29.513
even can get to apply?

00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:34.518
I'd love to hear you talk some
more about your policy regarding

00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:37.888
shortening that timeline
and making it less onerous

00:47:37.888 --> 00:47:39.056
on the applicants.

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:39.623
President Obama: Good.

00:47:39.623 --> 00:47:40.390
That's a great question.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.391
That's a great question.

00:47:41.391 --> 00:47:44.094
(applause)

00:47:44.094 --> 00:47:48.131
The United States
is a nation of immigrants.

00:47:48.131 --> 00:47:53.537
And this region has
contributed to the remarkable

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:59.643
progress that the United
States has made over

00:47:59.643 --> 00:48:01.645
the last two centuries.

00:48:02.779 --> 00:48:06.817
And my goal during the
course of my presidency has

00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:09.820
been to make sure we
continue to be a nation

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.055
of immigrants as well as a
nation of laws, and that

00:48:12.055 --> 00:48:14.825
we're attracting talent from
all around the world.

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:17.828
Part of what makes us
special is you walk

00:48:17.828 --> 00:48:20.998
in Brooklyn and there are
folks from everywhere.

00:48:20.998 --> 00:48:23.133
But they're all striving,
they're all talented,

00:48:23.133 --> 00:48:26.837
they're all trying to make
their dreams come true.

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:31.375
And that is what gives us
the energy and the strength

00:48:31.375 --> 00:48:33.644
to be able to accomplish
everything we've accomplished.

00:48:33.644 --> 00:48:41.485
So we need to fix
what is, right now,

00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:44.421
a broken immigration system.

00:48:44.421 --> 00:48:48.058
Part of it is dealing with those
who are undocumented but who

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:50.260
have been living there a long
time, are part of the community,

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:56.066
providing them with a pathway
in which they have to earn

00:48:56.066 --> 00:48:58.735
a legal status, but
recognizing that they're there

00:48:58.735 --> 00:49:02.639
and we're not going to be
separating out families.

00:49:02.639 --> 00:49:05.175
That's not who we are.

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:07.344
That's not true
to our values.

00:49:07.344 --> 00:49:10.747
And ultimately, it's not
good for our economy.

00:49:10.747 --> 00:49:13.150
But you are absolutely right
that part of the reason that

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:17.154
some people take the illegal
route is because we make the

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:19.790
legal route so difficult.

00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:21.792
And so we're trying
to identify ways

00:49:21.792 --> 00:49:23.760
to streamline that process.

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.796
Now, I have to be honest.

00:49:25.796 --> 00:49:28.498
A lot of people want
to come to America.

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:32.436
So unless we just
had no borders,

00:49:32.436 --> 00:49:37.007
there's always
going to be a wait.

00:49:37.007 --> 00:49:39.209
There's always going to
be background checks.

00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:42.179
There's always going to
be some prioritization

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:46.116
in terms of who's
admitted and who's not.

00:49:46.116 --> 00:49:49.853
But I do think that there
are practices we have -- for

00:49:49.853 --> 00:49:56.693
example, where someone has a
relation in the United States,

00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:59.863
is clearly qualified to
become at some point

00:49:59.863 --> 00:50:03.467
a legal resident and maybe
in the future a citizen,

00:50:03.467 --> 00:50:07.170
but in order to do it they have
to first leave the country,

00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:09.606
wait, and now they're
separated from their families.

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:13.210
I mean, there have to be
ways in which we can make

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:20.784
the system clearer
and less burdensome.

00:50:20.784 --> 00:50:24.087
Some of those changes we wanted
to make were in the legislation

00:50:24.087 --> 00:50:27.391
that was proposed and passed
the United States Senate.

00:50:30.694 --> 00:50:35.699
I think there is still the
opportunity to get that done

00:50:35.699 --> 00:50:39.002
before my presidency is
over, but it does require

00:50:39.002 --> 00:50:41.405
the Republican Party
I think to engage

00:50:41.405 --> 00:50:46.076
with me in a more
serious effort,

00:50:46.076 --> 00:50:48.078
and to put aside
the politics.

00:50:51.715 --> 00:50:53.216
Thank you very much
for the question.

00:50:53.216 --> 00:50:55.352
(applause)

00:50:55.352 --> 00:50:59.089
All right, this side
has been neglected right here.

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:05.729
I'm going to go with this
guy with the beard, man,

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:07.964
because he looks a
little bit like --

00:51:07.964 --> 00:51:11.101
(applause)

00:51:11.101 --> 00:51:13.937
-- he looks a little bit
like Marshawn Lynch.

00:51:13.937 --> 00:51:16.907
(laughter)

00:51:18.642 --> 00:51:20.043
Male Speaker:
Greetings, Mr. President.

00:51:20.043 --> 00:51:20.811
President Obama: How are you?

00:51:20.811 --> 00:51:21.945
Male Speaker: More life
and blessings on you

00:51:21.945 --> 00:51:22.779
and your family.

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:23.613
President Obama:
What's your name?

00:51:23.613 --> 00:51:24.815
Male Speaker: My name
is Miguel Williams,

00:51:24.815 --> 00:51:26.883
but you can call --
I am Steppa.

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:27.884
(laughter)

00:51:27.884 --> 00:51:28.518
President Obama: Steppa.

00:51:28.518 --> 00:51:30.120
Male Speaker: Yeah, man,
that is quite sufficient.

00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:31.955
Yeah, man.

00:51:31.955 --> 00:51:35.592
My question has to
do and surrounds U.S.

00:51:35.592 --> 00:51:41.331
policy as it regards
the legalization,

00:51:41.331 --> 00:51:44.201
the decriminalization
of marijuana.

00:51:44.201 --> 00:51:45.335
President Obama: How did I
anticipate this question?

00:51:45.335 --> 00:51:46.403
(laughter)

00:51:46.403 --> 00:51:48.505
Male Speaker: Yeah, man.

00:51:52.409 --> 00:51:53.877
President Obama: How did
I guess this question?

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:55.045
Male Speaker: Yes.

00:51:55.045 --> 00:51:59.082
And, Mr. President, it really
comes under (inaudible).

00:51:59.082 --> 00:52:02.486
We face economic challenges
with the IMF, et cetera.

00:52:02.486 --> 00:52:06.323
And and we find realistically
that the hemp industry,

00:52:06.323 --> 00:52:10.494
the marijuana industry
provides a highly

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:13.864
feasible alternative
to rise above poverty.

00:52:13.864 --> 00:52:20.003
So I am wanting to over stand
and to understand how U.S.

00:52:20.003 --> 00:52:23.039
is envisioning and how you
would you see Jamaica pushing

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:26.142
forward on a decriminalization,
legalization emphasis

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:28.144
on the hemp industry.

00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:30.981
(applause)

00:52:38.421 --> 00:52:39.389
President Obama: Okay.

00:52:39.389 --> 00:52:40.290
Well.

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:41.758
(laughter)

00:52:41.758 --> 00:52:46.596
Let me -- I do want to
separate out what are serious

00:52:46.596 --> 00:52:49.132
issues in the United States
and then how that relates

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:52.402
to our foreign policy and our
interactions with the region.

00:52:55.572 --> 00:53:01.211
There is the issue of
legalization of marijuana,

00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:04.814
and then there is the
issue of decriminalizing

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:10.120
or dealing with the
incarceration and,

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.155
in some cases, devastation
of communities

00:53:12.155 --> 00:53:16.826
as a consequence of
nonviolent drug offenses.

00:53:20.063 --> 00:53:24.968
I am a very strong believer
that the path that we have

00:53:24.968 --> 00:53:31.374
taken in the United States in
the so-called "War on Drugs"

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:35.712
has been so heavy in
emphasizing incarceration

00:53:37.814 --> 00:53:40.884
that it has been
counterproductive.

00:53:40.884 --> 00:53:48.558
You have young people who
did not engage in violence

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:52.796
who get very long penalties,
get placed in prison,

00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:58.335
and then are rendered
economically unemployable,

00:53:59.803 --> 00:54:04.407
are almost pushed into, then,
the underground economy,

00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:08.311
learn crime more
effectively in prison,

00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:11.748
families are devastated.

00:54:11.748 --> 00:54:14.317
So it's been very
unproductive.

00:54:14.317 --> 00:54:16.319
And what we're trying
to do is to reform our

00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:18.021
criminal justice system.

00:54:18.021 --> 00:54:20.624
And the good news is there has
actually been some interest

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:24.794
on the part of unlikely allies
like the evangelical community

00:54:24.794 --> 00:54:29.332
or some otherwise very
conservative Republicans,

00:54:29.332 --> 00:54:31.401
because it's very expensive
to incarcerate people,

00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:35.805
and a recognition that this
may not be the best approach.

00:54:35.805 --> 00:54:38.041
So that's one issue.

00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:42.812
There's then the second issue
of legalizing marijuana,

00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:46.316
whether it's medical marijuana
or recreational use.

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:49.452
There are two states in the
United States that have

00:54:49.452 --> 00:54:53.456
embarked on an experiment to
decriminalize or legalize

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:58.128
marijuana -- Colorado
and Washington State.

00:54:58.128 --> 00:55:04.434
And we will see how that
experiment works its way

00:55:04.434 --> 00:55:07.203
through the process.

00:55:07.203 --> 00:55:09.205
Right now, that is
not federal policy,

00:55:09.205 --> 00:55:14.144
and I do not foresee
anytime soon Congress

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:18.048
changing the law at
a national basis.

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:22.585
But I do think that if there
are states that show that

00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:26.690
they are not suddenly a
magnet for additional crime,

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:29.592
that they have a strong enough
public health infrastructure

00:55:29.592 --> 00:55:35.498
to push against the potential
of increased addiction,

00:55:35.498 --> 00:55:37.500
then it's conceivable
that that will spur

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.703
on a national debate.

00:55:39.703 --> 00:55:42.672
But that is going
to be some time off.

00:55:42.672 --> 00:55:46.376
And then the third
issue is what will U.S.

00:55:46.376 --> 00:55:49.079
international policy be.

00:55:49.079 --> 00:55:51.948
And we had some discussion
with the CARICOM

00:55:51.948 --> 00:55:54.017
countries about this.

00:55:54.017 --> 00:55:57.087
I know on paper a lot of
folks think, you know what,

00:55:57.087 --> 00:56:03.493
if we just legalize
marijuana, then it'll reduce

00:56:03.493 --> 00:56:06.863
the money flowing into the
transnational drug trade,

00:56:06.863 --> 00:56:09.566
there are more revenues
and jobs created.

00:56:12.769 --> 00:56:17.607
I have to tell you that it's
not a silver bullet, because,

00:56:17.607 --> 00:56:24.447
first of all, if you are
legalizing marijuana,

00:56:24.447 --> 00:56:28.518
then how do you deal
with other drugs,

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:31.121
and where do you
draw the line?

00:56:31.121 --> 00:56:38.461
Second of all, as is true in
the global economy generally,

00:56:38.461 --> 00:56:42.532
if you have a bunch of small
medium-sized marijuana

00:56:42.532 --> 00:56:45.401
businesses scattered
across the Caribbean

00:56:45.401 --> 00:56:48.438
and this is suddenly legal,
if you think that big

00:56:48.438 --> 00:56:50.440
multi-national
companies are not going

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:56.446
to suddenly come in and
market and try to control

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:03.586
and profit from the
trade -- that's I think

00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:07.056
a very real scenario.

00:57:07.056 --> 00:57:10.794
And so I think we have to
have a conversation about

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:16.032
this, but our current
policy continues to be that

00:57:16.032 --> 00:57:19.536
in the United States, we
need to decrease demand.

00:57:19.536 --> 00:57:22.138
We need to focus on a
public health approach

00:57:22.138 --> 00:57:25.375
to decreasing demand.

00:57:25.375 --> 00:57:30.814
We have to stop the flow of guns
and cash into the Caribbean

00:57:30.814 --> 00:57:32.816
and Central America
and Latin America.

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:34.818
(applause)

00:57:36.853 --> 00:57:38.922
And at the same time,
I think the Caribbean,

00:57:38.922 --> 00:57:44.527
Latin America have to -- Central
America -- have to cooperate

00:57:44.527 --> 00:57:50.266
with us to try to shrink the
power of the transnational drug

00:57:50.266 --> 00:57:55.672
organizations that are vicious
and hugely destructive.

00:58:00.076 --> 00:58:03.980
And if we combine a public
health perspective,

00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:08.685
a focus on not simply throwing
every low-level person with

00:58:08.685 --> 00:58:12.922
possession into prison by
trying to get them treatment,

00:58:12.922 --> 00:58:15.758
if we combine that with
economic development

00:58:15.758 --> 00:58:18.461
and alternative
opportunities for youth,

00:58:18.461 --> 00:58:20.897
then I think we can
strike the right balance.

00:58:23.633 --> 00:58:29.539
It may not comport with your --
completely with your vision

00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:33.643
for the future, but I think
that we could certainly have

00:58:33.643 --> 00:58:38.081
a smarter approach to it
than we currently do.

00:58:38.081 --> 00:58:40.850
Got time for one
more question.

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:43.019
One more question.

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:45.021
Let's see -- this
is always hard.

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:48.791
It's always hard to be that
last -- it's a lady's turn,

00:58:48.791 --> 00:58:52.462
so all the guys just have
to put down their hands.

00:58:52.462 --> 00:58:54.464
It's too late for you.

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:59.168
Let's see.

00:58:59.168 --> 00:59:01.170
You know what, I'm
just going to go with

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.171
this young lady
right here.

00:59:02.171 --> 00:59:03.172
She's just right in front.

00:59:03.172 --> 00:59:05.375
Go ahead, yes, you.

00:59:05.375 --> 00:59:07.577
Hold on a second,
wait for the mic.

00:59:07.577 --> 00:59:10.713
(laughter)

00:59:11.848 --> 00:59:13.016
Female Speaker:
Afternoon, Mr. President.

00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:15.852
I'm Alana Williams (ph), I'm
from the South Side of Chicago.

00:59:15.852 --> 00:59:17.120
President Obama: Wait,
you're from Chicago?

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.187
Female Speaker: Yes!

00:59:18.187 --> 00:59:19.322
President Obama: Well,
what are you doing here?

00:59:19.322 --> 00:59:21.090
This is supposed to be for
Caribbean young ladies.

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:22.992
Female Speaker: Actually,
I attend Olivet Nazarene

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:25.795
University and I'm studying
abroad, so I'm here.

00:59:25.795 --> 00:59:27.263
President Obama: I see, okay.

00:59:27.263 --> 00:59:28.197
Well, you're cheating
a little bit.

00:59:28.197 --> 00:59:29.699
I'll have to call on
somebody else after you.

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:30.900
(laughter)

00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.101
But I'm going to go
ahead and let you ask

00:59:32.101 --> 00:59:33.937
a question real quick.

00:59:33.937 --> 00:59:35.471
Because I'll see
you in Chicago.

00:59:35.471 --> 00:59:36.572
(laughter)

00:59:36.572 --> 00:59:37.941
Female Speaker: Most definitely.

00:59:37.941 --> 00:59:41.277
My question is really
more so about home.

00:59:41.277 --> 00:59:46.182
I love my city, but the
violence is terrible,

00:59:46.182 --> 00:59:49.052
specifically amongst
young black men.

00:59:49.052 --> 00:59:51.454
And I know we're talking a
lot about police brutality,

00:59:51.454 --> 00:59:53.523
but I've lost a lot of
friends from people who

00:59:53.523 --> 00:59:54.624
look just like me.

00:59:54.624 --> 00:59:55.758
And that's the problem.

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:57.760
And so I would like to
know what you believe

00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.762
is the true source of the
violence, and what

00:59:59.762 --> 01:00:02.832
is one solution to an
extreme problem.

01:00:02.832 --> 01:00:03.499
Thank you.

01:00:03.499 --> 01:00:05.068
President Obama: Well, look,
I know you asked it about

01:00:05.068 --> 01:00:07.603
Chicago but I know there
are neighborhoods right

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:10.373
here in Jamaica that have
the same problems,

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:14.310
and in every place all
across the Caribbean;

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:16.312
certainly in
Central America.

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:23.686
I don't think there is
just one single factor.

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:26.255
Obviously, a contributor is
one that we just talked about,

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:27.256
which is the drug trade.

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:33.262
If you have an illicit
trade that generates huge

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:41.037
amounts of money and is
not regulated above board,

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:45.575
that is going to attract
ultimately people trying

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:48.811
to carve out turf, trying
to control markets,

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:50.413
and violence ensues.

01:00:50.413 --> 01:00:52.615
So that's point number one.

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:56.986
Point number two is the easy
accessibility of weapons.

01:00:56.986 --> 01:01:02.158
And we were talking earlier
about different traditions;

01:01:02.158 --> 01:01:06.562
the United States has a
tradition of gun ownership

01:01:06.562 --> 01:01:10.533
that is deep; dates back
to the pioneer past.

01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:16.539
And I think it is a mistake
that we do not do a better job

01:01:20.176 --> 01:01:24.047
of putting in place common-sense
gun-safety regulations

01:01:24.047 --> 01:01:28.184
that would keep guns out
of the hands of criminals,

01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:31.154
but unfortunately a
majority of Congress does

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:32.422
not agree with me.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:38.027
Even after six-year-olds
were gunned down viciously

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:40.563
in their classroom, we
could not get action done.

01:01:40.563 --> 01:01:43.466
But what we are doing is
cooperating with the region

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:46.602
as we are cooperating with
local jurisdictions

01:01:46.602 --> 01:01:49.906
to try to stem at least
the flow of guns using

01:01:49.906 --> 01:01:51.908
the administrative
tools that I have.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.943
So that's number two.

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:56.979
Number three is providing
alternative paths

01:01:56.979 --> 01:01:58.981
for young people.

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:04.454
If a young person is reading
by the age -- by the third

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:10.393
grade and at grade level, if
they are enjoying school,

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:13.629
if they see a path for
success, then they are less

01:02:13.629 --> 01:02:16.899
likely to get involved in
criminal activity and that

01:02:16.899 --> 01:02:19.535
will reduce gun violence,
and that will reduce

01:02:19.535 --> 01:02:22.538
crime, and that will
reduce death.

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:23.773
(applause)

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:25.374
Which means investing
in things like early childhood

01:02:25.374 --> 01:02:28.845
education and improving our
schools -- those things

01:02:28.845 --> 01:02:30.213
are absolutely vital.

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:33.249
(applause)

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:37.553
But there is a fourth
element to this,

01:02:37.553 --> 01:02:43.226
and that is our own
responsibility.

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:46.195
And particularly, as I
speak to young people here

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:49.098
today, we always talk about
what can we do about

01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:51.467
the violence as if it's like
just separate and apart.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:58.407
But we have control
in our communities

01:02:58.407 --> 01:03:01.477
of our immediate friends,
our immediate family.

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:04.780
We influence our peers.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:11.020
And I do think that the power
that all of you have as young

01:03:11.020 --> 01:03:18.561
leaders to be able to not
make excuses for violence --

01:03:18.561 --> 01:03:20.563
because there are a whole
bunch of folks who have

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.899
really tough backgrounds
and come from terrible

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:26.035
circumstances, and
are really poor,

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:30.006
but they don't go around
shooting somebody.

01:03:30.006 --> 01:03:35.578
They don't beat somebody over
the head because of sneakers

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:40.349
or because they looked
at them the wrong way.

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:45.788
And so there is an element of
us retaking our communities

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:49.792
and being willing to speak
out against violence

01:03:49.792 --> 01:03:51.894
in our midst.

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:56.098
That doesn't ignore
all the social factors.

01:03:56.098 --> 01:04:01.804
But Dr. King used to say it's
not an either/or situation,

01:04:01.804 --> 01:04:03.439
it's a both/and situation.

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.875
Government has to act.

01:04:05.875 --> 01:04:08.978
We have to have
effective policing,

01:04:08.978 --> 01:04:13.749
which means policing that is
actually protecting as opposed

01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:15.751
to some of the things that
we've been seeing of late

01:04:15.751 --> 01:04:19.322
in the United States,
and I'm sure is true

01:04:19.322 --> 01:04:20.323
in other countries.

01:04:20.323 --> 01:04:27.363
And I say that saying that
police have an extraordinarily

01:04:27.363 --> 01:04:29.932
difficult job, and the
overwhelming majority

01:04:29.932 --> 01:04:32.068
do a great job under
severe circumstances.

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:36.505
But there's got to be trust
built between the communities,

01:04:36.505 --> 01:04:39.075
and I had to put a task
force together that put

01:04:39.075 --> 01:04:41.077
together some excellent
reports in the wake

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:45.014
of Ferguson around how
we can do that.

01:04:45.014 --> 01:04:47.016
But ultimately, what
happens in the home,

01:04:47.016 --> 01:04:49.885
what happens in the school
-- some of you are parents

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:52.388
already; some of you will be
parents -- what we teach

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:56.292
our children in terms of
values, valuing themselves,

01:04:56.292 --> 01:05:00.529
valuing others, that's
important, too.

01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:02.365
(applause)

01:05:02.365 --> 01:05:05.167
So there's
no single solution.

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.003
But all of us have
to do better.

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:11.674
Because the tragedy of what
we see in the United States

01:05:11.674 --> 01:05:15.511
but also in cities and towns
all across the Caribbean

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:20.149
and Central America,
is terrible.

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:22.885
And there's no
excuse for it.

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:23.819
All right.

01:05:23.819 --> 01:05:27.556
Because I called
accidentally on a Chicagoan,

01:05:27.556 --> 01:05:32.428
I've got to call
on one more person.

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:36.799
Look, this young lady stood
up, so she showed --

01:05:36.799 --> 01:05:41.737
that wasn't fair, but I
called on her, go ahead.

01:05:41.737 --> 01:05:44.206
You're not from
Chicago are you?

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:44.874
Female Speaker: No.

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:45.908
President Obama:
You promise?

01:05:45.908 --> 01:05:46.609
Okay.

01:05:46.609 --> 01:05:48.511
All right, get the
mic -- oh, I'm sorry.

01:05:48.511 --> 01:05:51.013
You know what, I confess,
even though I was going

01:05:51.013 --> 01:05:53.015
to call on you, she
thought she was going

01:05:53.015 --> 01:05:53.983
to be called on.

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:55.985
I'm going to call
on both of you now,

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:57.987
but each of you get a
really short question.

01:05:57.987 --> 01:05:59.689
Really short, quick.

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.424
Female Speaker: Well,
I'm the team leader for

01:06:01.424 --> 01:06:03.292
the Global Entrepreneurship
Monitor and I want

01:06:03.292 --> 01:06:04.894
to thank you for the
initiatives that you're

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:06.228
planning to do here.

01:06:06.228 --> 01:06:08.597
And I wanted to invite you to
our annual general meeting

01:06:08.597 --> 01:06:12.535
that's going to be held
in Babson in the States,

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:14.503
so we want you to come
because you are part

01:06:14.503 --> 01:06:15.671
of a global team.

01:06:15.671 --> 01:06:19.008
So I'm representing Jamaica
as the youngest female team

01:06:19.008 --> 01:06:23.546
leader, and I'm inviting you
to come so we can talk

01:06:23.546 --> 01:06:27.083
about Startup America
and we can collaborate

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:28.317
on different projects.

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:31.120
So I'm inviting you
to come to that event.

01:06:31.120 --> 01:06:32.188
President Obama:
Okay, that was good.

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:35.324
And I can say I'll
await your invitation.

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:39.995
And what I will say very
quickly is entrepreneurship,

01:06:39.995 --> 01:06:42.765
small- and medium-sized
businesses,

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:46.202
that is a priority and that
means that we've got to create

01:06:46.202 --> 01:06:53.909
channels for access to
capital, technical training.

01:06:53.909 --> 01:06:56.245
These are areas where a
lot of our development

01:06:56.245 --> 01:06:57.480
aid is shifting.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:07:02.118
Instead of just giving
somebody a fish,

01:07:02.118 --> 01:07:03.986
we want to teach
them how to fish.

01:07:03.986 --> 01:07:05.755
(applause)

01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:10.092
And what you're seeing
-- what you see among

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:11.694
young people all
around the world is,

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:18.534
is that instead of just finding
a job in a big organization,

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.903
they may want to create
something of their own,

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:22.071
a new vision.

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:25.274
And that kind of creativity
has to be tapped.

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:28.711
So we're shifting a lot of the
work that we do around issues

01:07:28.711 --> 01:07:30.713
of entrepreneurship, so I'll
be interested in seeing

01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:31.714
what you have to say.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:32.715
All right.

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:34.717
This young lady
right here, go ahead.

01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.719
Female Speaker:
Hello, everyone.

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:37.720
Hi, Mr. President.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.722
My name is Davianne Tucker,
and I'm the Guild

01:07:39.722 --> 01:07:41.724
president-elect for the
University of the West Indies.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:42.725
(applause)

01:07:42.725 --> 01:07:43.993
Thank you.

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:46.128
So my question is, the
Jamaican government has

01:07:46.128 --> 01:07:48.230
been holding firmly
to the stipulations

01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:49.765
of the IMF agreement.

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:51.767
There are many who would
like to know if the debt

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:55.137
write-offs for Jamaica are
being considered as a means

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:57.873
of improving the
livelihood of our people.

01:07:57.873 --> 01:08:00.109
So is that being considered?

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:02.945
President Obama: Well, this
came up in my bilateral

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.947
with your Prime Minister.

01:08:06.515 --> 01:08:12.521
And, look, historically, I
think there has been times

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:18.994
where the IMF or the
international multilateral

01:08:18.994 --> 01:08:26.268
organizations worked
with governments in ways

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:28.270
that weren't always
productive, got them deep

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:31.273
into debt, and then
suddenly you've got a lot

01:08:31.273 --> 01:08:33.442
more flowing out
than was going in.

01:08:33.442 --> 01:08:35.578
And in some cases there were
governments around the world

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:41.183
that were corrupt, lent money,
money goes into a Swiss bank

01:08:41.183 --> 01:08:46.622
account, suddenly the people
are paying off for decades.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:49.592
In Jamaica, some of it just
had to do with tough

01:08:49.592 --> 01:08:55.931
circumstances, not always
the best fiscal management.

01:08:55.931 --> 01:09:02.037
I think that the current
government has been wise

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:06.242
to work hard to abide by
the IMF provisions.

01:09:06.242 --> 01:09:07.843
That's not been easy.

01:09:07.843 --> 01:09:10.679
And I think that has been
the right thing to do.

01:09:10.679 --> 01:09:13.582
But what I also agreed with,
when I spoke to the Prime

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:16.218
Minister, is the need
to try to address

01:09:16.218 --> 01:09:23.726
in a more systematic fashion
how we can spur growth

01:09:23.726 --> 01:09:31.033
and not just put the
squeeze on folks.

01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:34.703
Because what it turns
out is, is that if a --

01:09:34.703 --> 01:09:37.439
the best way for a country
to reduce its debt

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:40.943
is to grow really fast, and
to generate more income.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.845
(applause)

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.916
Now, that does require
development plans

01:09:46.916 --> 01:09:51.453
and approaches that
are productive.

01:09:51.453 --> 01:09:54.423
And it is true that
sometimes that requires some

01:09:54.423 --> 01:09:55.824
short-term sacrifice.

01:09:55.824 --> 01:10:01.363
And I think the question
that the people of Jamaica,

01:10:01.363 --> 01:10:03.365
just like the people of
the United States

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:05.367
and everywhere else,
should be asking is:

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:07.369
If the government is
spending money right now,

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:09.772
is it on something
that is going to help

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:12.308
create long-term growth
and help people succeed?

01:10:12.308 --> 01:10:15.644
(applause)

01:10:15.644 --> 01:10:18.981
If the answer is no, you
shouldn't spend that money.

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:21.383
Spending money just for
the sake of spending money

01:10:21.383 --> 01:10:24.453
is not -- that's not the
formula for success.

01:10:24.453 --> 01:10:26.455
But if the money is being
spent on what we talked

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:28.457
about -- early childhood
education; if it's being

01:10:28.457 --> 01:10:31.327
spent on infrastructure;
if it's being spent

01:10:31.327 --> 01:10:34.296
on research; if it's
being spent on building

01:10:34.296 --> 01:10:38.734
skills for workers -- those
are good investments.

01:10:38.734 --> 01:10:41.103
And I do think that the
international financial

01:10:41.103 --> 01:10:45.074
institutions have to accommodate
the interests of countries who

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:50.045
have a sound plan for growth so
that they cannot just stay

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:57.786
in this static state but can,
over time, thrive and succeed.

01:10:57.786 --> 01:11:00.089
And the way that's going
to happen is because

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.291
of outstanding young
leaders like you.

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.993
I've had a great
conversation.

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:04.994
Thank you, Jamaica.

01:11:04.994 --> 01:11:06.962
Thank you.

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:09.231
Appreciate it,
young leaders.

01:11:09.231 --> 01:11:10.165
God bless you.

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:11.033
(applause)
