00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.433
- Rock and roll time.

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.680
(upbeat music)

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:04.570
Do you like to go low?

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.940
- Let's see how low you can go?

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.683
Oh my God! Oh my God!

00:00:07.683 --> 00:00:09.703
We're below the water almost.

00:00:10.786 --> 00:00:11.886
Whoa!

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:14.750
(dramatic music)

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.208
- I mean the amount of money
sitting there is just crazy.

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:21.140
(dramatic music)

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.785
You're flying sir, you're flying.

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:24.149
- Yeah

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:25.370
- Whoa, whoa!

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.445
- That's wake turbulence.

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:27.278
- We're all going to die!

00:00:27.278 --> 00:00:28.187
- No we're not.

00:00:28.187 --> 00:00:29.860
(dramatic music)

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.711
Wow that's all of the passenger
ships sitting right there.

00:00:32.711 --> 00:00:33.544
Look at that.

00:00:33.544 --> 00:00:36.294
(dramatic music)

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:41.077
We're now coming over
the LAX at 4,000 feet.

00:00:41.077 --> 00:00:44.455
(dramatic music)

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:47.720
- Well, John I can tell you a secret now.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.620
- Welcome back, today
for the love of aviation

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.070
a lot of general aviation
pilots came out with me.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.470
We're going to do an
Aplick neat air formation

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.477
with three planes.

00:00:56.477 --> 00:00:59.060
(upbeat music)

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.860
- Here's the plan for our flight today.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.850
We've got three aeroplanes ,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.564
so its a formation flight.

00:01:12.564 --> 00:01:15.820
Obviously our number
one priority is safety.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.840
And in order to maintain safety,

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.330
we have to maintain separation.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.230
If someone's leading the flight,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.150
they are doing navigation
and communication

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:24.780
and making sure we stay
out of any air space

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.810
we shouldn't be in.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.230
If people are the wing men,

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.340
they are focusing entirely on separation.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.380
They should be looking
at the lead at all times

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.807
and everyone here knows how to do that.

00:01:34.807 --> 00:01:36.310
When we meet the photo ship,

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.710
the photo ship is going to become lead

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.460
in some of the cases,

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.742
so we're going to have
an exchange of controls.

00:01:42.742 --> 00:01:46.080
We're going to fly to Mohave
and do a few orbits above,

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.620
figure out where all
of the aeroplanes  are.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.700
Then we're going to call,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.160
the photographer's going to call the tower

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.610
and we're going to descend down

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.170
and do whatever orbits we need.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.390
When we're done, we'll exit there and head

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.083
east towards Victorville.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.640
And Victorville, we'll do the same thing.

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.560
We'll do some orbits above the airspace

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.393
to get the lay of the land

00:02:02.393 --> 00:02:04.490
and then we'll do some low passes

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.230
over Runway 2-1.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.990
And we'll be at the direction.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.289
Whenever this is happening,

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.840
the photo ship will be lead

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.020
and they'll be directing us
and telling us what to do.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.600
- Ready to go!

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.630
- Good, you're it.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.750
You're going to be doing everything.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.583
- Yeah (laughter).

00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:20.680
- You're going to be flying us today.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.506
So we start off with the brake,

00:02:22.506 --> 00:02:24.940
park brake is on.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.550
Throttle is closed

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.750
and then over there,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.228
we'll switch on two lanes.

00:02:30.228 --> 00:02:32.100
We've got our...

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.030
Avionics booted up...

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:35.942
Prop here.

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:38.692
(engine turning)

00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:41.910
And you can close your doors.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.160
Sam, just grab it in
front then pull it down.

00:02:46.376 --> 00:02:48.900
- Very, very spacious inside.
- Yes, yes.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.730
Your feet's on the rudder pedals,

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.370
this hand here

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.720
and apply a little bit of power

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.370
and steer with your
feet and let's go down.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:58.203
- Okay

00:02:58.203 --> 00:03:00.304
- Turn right to go right,
push with your feet.

00:03:00.304 --> 00:03:01.620
- Yep

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.560
- A little bit less power, less power.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.770
- Yep. Oh wow I'm getting it!

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.650
- You're getting it quickly.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:08.788
- Dude, I can't totally speak right now.

00:03:08.788 --> 00:03:10.700
- And then, right here
- Okay

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.010
- At this hand, you can put
on the brake if you want to.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.349
- Uh huh
- A little bit harder right

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:15.770
and we're going to go right down there.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:16.603
- Okay

00:03:16.603 --> 00:03:18.127
- And catch up with the guys.

00:03:18.127 --> 00:03:18.960
- Okay

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.060
- Okay good!

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.358
You're a pilot!

00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:22.191
- (laughter)

00:03:22.191 --> 00:03:23.132
- Easy as that.

00:03:23.132 --> 00:03:24.330
Here we go, beautiful, well done.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.411
- Wow! I can't believe I'm doing it.

00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.413
- And the apply brakes. You're
doing it, you're doing it!

00:03:28.413 --> 00:03:29.246
- Wow!

00:03:29.246 --> 00:03:30.464
- Okay, we've got to do some checks.

00:03:30.464 --> 00:03:33.690
Take the stick and go all the way left,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.015
back, check the controls.

00:03:36.015 --> 00:03:36.848
- Yep

00:03:36.848 --> 00:03:38.141
- That's it. Nice.

00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.449
- Check the controls. Yep

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:41.190
- Good. Sam, what you're going to do is,

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.590
I want you to do the takeoff.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.570
- Oh, me?

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.820
- Well, with me.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:45.653
I'll be there,

00:03:45.653 --> 00:03:46.486
but I want you to do it.

00:03:46.486 --> 00:03:47.636
We're going to do a formation takeoff.

00:03:47.636 --> 00:03:48.469
All I want you to do

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.780
is concentrate on the runway,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:54.850
apply power and when
your speed gets to 55,

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.160
a slight pressure on the
stick to pull us back.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.240
But very slight

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.073
and we'll just let the aeroplane take off

00:03:59.073 --> 00:04:01.230
and we'll maintain in these formation

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:02.210
with these guys.

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.043
Okay, let's go.

00:04:03.043 --> 00:04:03.876
All right.

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.620
You ready?

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.453
- Yeah

00:04:06.453 --> 00:04:07.480
- Okay so this hand on the power,

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.930
and ease the power on
and lets go, let's go.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:10.763
- Full throttle?

00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:12.130
- Yes, go all the way,
all the way forward,

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.600
all the way, keep it.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.681
- Oh let's go!

00:04:14.681 --> 00:04:16.527
- There you go, we're going to go.

00:04:16.527 --> 00:04:18.034
- Let me know when to when to rotate.

00:04:18.034 --> 00:04:20.560
- Yeah, and it's a very small movement,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.367
and you can start easing
the stick back a little bit.

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:26.690
And let's go fly.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.492
You're flying sir, you're flying!

00:04:28.492 --> 00:04:29.325
- Yes!

00:04:29.325 --> 00:04:32.075
(dramatic music)

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.713
- Wow, wow.

00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:38.290
- That's wake turbulence.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.090
- Yeah, wake turbulence from the taxiing.

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.540
Yeah, good.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.770
Amazing, airborne now.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.230
- [Radio] Technum doesn't have
visual of the both flights.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.430
Roger, we both got two visual,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.810
I got visual of the TF-5.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.300
- That Technum looks even
sexier with the gear up.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.420
Wow it looks so nice with the gear up.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.571
- Yeah

00:04:54.571 --> 00:04:56.110
(dramatic music)

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.380
- So flying formation like
this is quite difficult.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.180
You really just got to
concentrate, you know?

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.013
- Yeah

00:05:01.013 --> 00:05:02.088
- You're, you're closing speed

00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:04.150
cannot be so quick and sudden.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.978
- We are, we're just coming over

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:09.253
the LAX at 4,000 feet.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.963
- Very quiet down there.

00:05:10.963 --> 00:05:14.710
A lot more aeroplanes  sitting
on the ground than flying.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.600
- Yeah, it's quite amazing,

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.670
cause normally when you fly over here

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.700
and you look out on the approach part,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.060
there's a row of aeroplanes 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:23.680
and there's just almost nothing now.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.710
- Wow, that's incredible.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:26.780
I've never been so close following

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.690
a plane like this.

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.680
This is a new record for me.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.731
Really, thank you so much.

00:05:30.731 --> 00:05:32.500
- You want to try and fly?

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.710
- Uh, okay I'll try a little bit.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.650
- The main thing is if
anything goes wrong,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.310
we'll escape route is down and left.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.143
- Okay.

00:05:39.143 --> 00:05:40.660
- Don't focus on him too much,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.852
but just keep an eye on him.

00:05:41.852 --> 00:05:43.247
Make sure you take control.

00:05:43.247 --> 00:05:44.320
- Okay, I have control.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.252
- Again and if anything goes funny,

00:05:46.252 --> 00:05:47.996
you'll just relax and I'll grab it.

00:05:47.996 --> 00:05:51.060
Keep left, don't don't let
us start getting close.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.083
Try to stay.

00:05:54.081 --> 00:05:56.371
Got it?

00:05:56.371 --> 00:05:57.204
See how quickly

00:05:57.204 --> 00:05:59.428
it gets out of whack.

00:05:59.428 --> 00:06:01.570
- Yeah, sorry about that (laughter).

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:02.672
- No, no, no problem.

00:06:02.672 --> 00:06:04.050
- Oh my God, this is very advanced,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.020
like, this is something

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.063
you wouldn't normally do.

00:06:07.063 --> 00:06:08.710
- You see, you see my movements,

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.183
I'm using two fingers,

00:06:10.183 --> 00:06:13.360
and I'm just like a joystick all the time.

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.510
Slight movements.

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:16.470
And then if you look at one of,

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:18.075
you change the scale there,

00:06:18.075 --> 00:06:22.096
here at 24 miles and just search
around for Nine Mike Bravo.

00:06:22.096 --> 00:06:24.790
- Yep, Nine Mike Bravo found.

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:25.623
- You've got it, excellent.

00:06:25.623 --> 00:06:27.450
- I'm going around 20 miles.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:29.480
- [Narrator] So, we were
looking out for our camera ship,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.450
which is a Cessna 172,

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.180
operated by a father and son team.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.640
From their Cessna,

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.947
they will film our
formation over the desert

00:06:36.947 --> 00:06:38.610
and Blooming Flower Fuse.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.444
That was our plan.

00:06:39.444 --> 00:06:42.194
- (upbeat music)

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.986
- You know the pilot
reported extreme turbulence

00:06:54.986 --> 00:06:56.890
which I don't often do.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:06:58.640
- [Narrator] As we're
heading towards Mohave,

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.570
it became really windy and bumpy.

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:02.360
So, we decided to split up

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.530
instead of continuing the formation.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.363
At this point,

00:07:05.363 --> 00:07:07.108
the Cessna photo ship
went to Victorville first

00:07:07.108 --> 00:07:09.790
with a Whistling trainer aircraft.

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:11.130
They've managed some awesome

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.184
air to air footage ahead of us.

00:07:13.184 --> 00:07:15.934
- (upbeat music)

00:07:29.078 --> 00:07:31.209
- Ted and Choi 0-2-5 Whiskey Tango

00:07:31.209 --> 00:07:32.900
is joining left base

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:35.041
for runway 2-0 low pass.

00:07:35.041 --> 00:07:36.582
- Clear to low approach,

00:07:36.582 --> 00:07:37.950
I'm going to get a left turn on Southbound

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.070
is approved to be advised
or received at par

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:42.751
or above turbulence of extreme.

00:07:42.751 --> 00:07:44.654
- Look at that two pass
and its turbulence.

00:07:44.654 --> 00:07:46.593
Very very steep turbulence.

00:07:46.593 --> 00:07:49.510
- (dramatic music)

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:54.178
- Oh yeah, extreme turbulence today.

00:07:54.178 --> 00:07:55.300
A challenge.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.742
Oh look at all the
aeroplanes  in graveyard.

00:07:57.742 --> 00:07:59.019
- That's amazing.

00:07:59.019 --> 00:08:01.241
- I was in the middle of
that graveyard about a month.

00:08:01.241 --> 00:08:02.074
- Oh, yeah?

00:08:02.074 --> 00:08:02.907
- Yeah.

00:08:02.907 --> 00:08:04.232
I was deep style all these
aeroplanes  actually.

00:08:04.232 --> 00:08:05.065
- Wow.

00:08:05.065 --> 00:08:07.650
_ Yeah. Its good to see all
of them still here, yep.

00:08:07.650 --> 00:08:09.604
- Wow, look at that.

00:08:09.604 --> 00:08:12.521
- (dramatic music)

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.990
- [Narrator] Under heavy turbulence,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:16.880
we made two rather poor attempts

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:18.830
over Mohave aeroplane graveyard

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.300
and we didn't catch much.

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.640
We decided to move on quickly
to Victorville afterwards.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.830
- Hi Victorville tower
1-3-5 Whiskey Tango.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:26.817
Good morning.

00:08:26.817 --> 00:08:29.547
Ah, we're inbound from Mohave,

00:08:29.547 --> 00:08:30.510
and I wondered if

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:32.720
you could accommodate us joining in

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.750
and having a flight

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.733
over runway 2-1 at about 500 feet?

00:08:37.807 --> 00:08:39.750
- [Operator] Five Whiskey
Tango for pictures

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.930
maintain Att above 5,500

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:43.370
and you can take all the photos

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:45.349
you want Att above 5,500.

00:08:45.349 --> 00:08:48.277
- Victorville tower didn't
like our initial request,

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:50.758
instead of letting us fly
in low over the airfield,

00:08:50.758 --> 00:08:54.050
the ATC put us at 5,500 feet,

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:56.240
which outside of his control area.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.460
- Wow, look at that, hey.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.840
- The 2-1 is the one where the runway,

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:01.666
the planes parked like a V shape.

00:09:01.666 --> 00:09:02.499
- Yeah.

00:09:02.499 --> 00:09:03.360
- And then you got a bunch of Southwest

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.100
next to them on the taxiway.

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.898
So, it would be really cool to fly past.

00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:07.731
- I'm just thinking.

00:09:07.731 --> 00:09:09.184
Can we go back,

00:09:09.184 --> 00:09:11.273
and we do a full stop landing?

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.226
- We can land, yes.

00:09:13.226 --> 00:09:15.620
- Victorville tower, 1-3-5 Whiskey Tango,

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:17.760
We've got 5,500 feet,

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.380
I wonder if you can
accommodate full stop landing,

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.111
runway 1-7, please?

00:09:21.111 --> 00:09:23.731
- [Operator] 3-5-2 Whiskey Tango,

00:09:23.731 --> 00:09:27.460
left traffic going 1-7, report downwind.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.310
You'll be number two
to fall all the way in.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.100
- We'll land 1-7 number two

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.961
and copy the wave turbulence
Five Whiskey Tango.

00:09:33.961 --> 00:09:36.310
(dramatic music)

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:37.723
- Ah, the wind is to bad,

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.344
Wow, look at how many
aeroplanes  there is here.

00:09:41.344 --> 00:09:42.331
- It's impressive.

00:09:42.331 --> 00:09:43.164
- Yeah (laughter)

00:09:43.164 --> 00:09:44.363
- First flap speed,

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.100
left on Delta this frequency,

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:51.223
and we'd like to taxi to Million Air.

00:09:51.223 --> 00:09:52.558
- [Operator] 3-5 Whiskey
Tango turn right on taxiway

00:09:52.558 --> 00:09:54.192
and cross only two more.

00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:55.790
- [Narrator] Without much luck,

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.550
we decided to land in Victorville

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.630
and take a short break

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:00.260
at the Million Air facility

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:01.703
and form a new strategy.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.190
- Wow.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.340
So here on the ground, at Victorville,

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:08.360
it's really amazing.

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.520
There's just tonnes and
tonnes of aeroplanes ,

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.400
new aeroplanes , old aeroplanes 

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.740
and also those retired
aeroplanes  that are let.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.740
Everything is here so the Max,

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.760
737 Max those really

00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.550
have zero hours on the clock.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:21.610
Right here, this lot,

00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:23.040
Southwest in the background,

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:24.750
and also right behind our plane,

00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:27.470
Fly Dubai, LOT Polish, Cayman Airways.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.460
You can see GOL Air,

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.170
Europa T'way, China Southern.

00:10:30.170 --> 00:10:31.411
All the brand new MAX

00:10:31.411 --> 00:10:33.260
are stored in Victorville

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.550
because of the low humidity.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:35.630
Then you see the the Delta,

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:37.360
they occupy the whole runway,

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.320
about, I would say,

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.430
about over 100 Delta aeroplanes  now

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.330
parked in a V shape very tightly,

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.320
follow each other.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.180
So, we're going to try our luck now.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:46.456
We're going to try get airborne

00:10:46.456 --> 00:10:48.420
and to do some filming,

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:49.940
if the tower approves us.

00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:52.250
To see from a top down view,

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.500
from the bird's eye view,

00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.100
that will make you to appreciate

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.020
how the scale of the aeroplane storage

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:59.600
happening right now in Victorville.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:00.630
After this short break,

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:02.495
we decide to do a box climb

00:11:02.495 --> 00:11:04.370
over Victorville airfield,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:07.747
so we can slowly climb
up to the 5,500 feet

00:11:07.747 --> 00:11:10.798
and capture all the footage
underneath our plane.

00:11:10.798 --> 00:11:14.030
- (engine turning)

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:15.490
- Here we are, parked there.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:17.882
We've got to be taxiing onto Charlie,

00:11:17.882 --> 00:11:19.932
out Charlie and we're going to get Charlie

00:11:19.932 --> 00:11:22.270
to our departure from there.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.110
And then we're going to try

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:24.390
and take 3-5

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:27.168
and do a round of box flying right here.

00:11:27.168 --> 00:11:30.085
- (dramatic music)

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.830
- 9-1-3-5 Whiskey Tango
Victorville tower approve.

00:11:38.830 --> 00:11:39.663
We're only three,

00:11:39.663 --> 00:11:42.001
Five Charlie Two clear for takeoff.

00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:43.410
- [Operator] Okay, Charlie
Two cleared for takeoff

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.310
runway 3-5 right end box cut approved,

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.360
thanks Five Whiskey Tango.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.193
- Roger.

00:11:48.193 --> 00:11:49.320
- All right, here we go,

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.330
we've got it sir.

00:11:51.330 --> 00:11:52.865
Rock and roll time.

00:11:52.865 --> 00:11:55.782
- (dramatic music)

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:17.107
Just crazy, just the
sheer number of aircraft.

00:12:17.107 --> 00:12:17.940
- Yeah.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:18.915
- Volume.

00:12:18.915 --> 00:12:21.400
I mean the amount of money sitting there,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.353
is just crazy.

00:12:23.353 --> 00:12:24.853
- Victorville tower, 1-2-5 Whiskey Tango

00:12:24.853 --> 00:12:26.970
upbound to the South.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:27.803
Thank you very much.

00:12:27.803 --> 00:12:29.560
Have a good afternoon.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.938
Okay, so...

00:12:30.938 --> 00:12:32.091
San Bernardino,

00:12:32.091 --> 00:12:35.385
we could go over there 3,200 feet.

00:12:35.385 --> 00:12:36.707
- [Radio] And on target tower,

00:12:36.707 --> 00:12:39.983
Sling 1-3-5 Whiskey Tango good afternoon.

00:12:39.983 --> 00:12:41.169
We've got Charlie

00:12:41.169 --> 00:12:43.217
and we'd like to be inbound

00:12:43.217 --> 00:12:44.410
for a touch and go, runway 2-4.

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:46.610
- [Operator] Five Whiskey Tango,

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:48.770
traffic departing runway 2-4

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.309
cleared touch and go.

00:12:50.309 --> 00:12:51.957
- Copy that and departing.

00:12:51.957 --> 00:12:53.840
Departing clear touch and go,

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:55.753
runway 2-4 5 Whiskey Tango.

00:12:59.082 --> 00:13:02.610
(plane touchdown sound)

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:06.928
Hello tower 1-3-5 Whiskey
Tango going around.

00:13:06.928 --> 00:13:09.649
- 5 Whiskey Tango (mumble)

00:13:09.649 --> 00:13:11.460
- See South African Airways there?

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.310
- Oh.

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.622
- Yeah.

00:13:13.622 --> 00:13:15.560
- They got stack here.

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.550
- [Narrator] At San Bernardino,

00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:17.475
there were also lots of planes

00:13:17.475 --> 00:13:19.350
parked in the middle of airfield.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:21.040
We did our very best to capture

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.390
by doing touch and go,

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.330
and box climb in the circuits,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:25.532
but it wasn't quite easy.

00:13:25.532 --> 00:13:28.449
- (dramatic music)

00:13:38.022 --> 00:13:39.017
So, where are we heading now?

00:13:39.017 --> 00:13:40.410
- We're going to go over the field...

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:41.243
- Uh huh.

00:13:41.243 --> 00:13:42.076
- And then to King Harbour

00:13:42.076 --> 00:13:43.610
which is a nice area to start,

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.380
and then we can fly down the coast.

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.297
- (dramatic music)

00:13:49.283 --> 00:13:50.307
- Do you like to go low?

00:13:50.307 --> 00:13:53.260
- Yeah, let's see how low you can go.

00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:54.147
- Accepted.

00:13:54.147 --> 00:13:54.980
- (laughter)

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:57.813
- We are at 660 foot.

00:13:59.159 --> 00:14:01.129
(dramatic music)

00:14:01.129 --> 00:14:02.693
Wow, very pretty.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.320
Wow, it's beautiful, beautiful flight.

00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.153
Oh my God.

00:14:07.153 --> 00:14:07.986
Oh my God.

00:14:08.830 --> 00:14:10.240
Shit (laughter)

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.610
- You want to go lower?

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:13.540
- Oh my God, look at it, it's red,

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:14.790
it's red here (laughter).

00:14:15.724 --> 00:14:16.557
It's red.

00:14:16.557 --> 00:14:17.850
We're below the water almost.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:19.140
Oh my God!

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:19.973
Whoa!

00:14:21.225 --> 00:14:22.951
South African Bush Pilots!

00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:25.201
(laughter)

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.869
Lovely, I love that, love it.

00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:31.786
- (dramatic music)

00:14:35.405 --> 00:14:38.040
- Have you seen one person on the beach?

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.584
- Not one.

00:14:39.584 --> 00:14:40.417
- Not one.

00:14:40.417 --> 00:14:41.250
- Zero.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.083
- They're all closed.

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:45.990
- Wow. Really enjoyable.

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.823
Beautiful.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:49.570
- Wow, so there's all the passenger ships

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:50.620
sitting right there.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:51.868
Look at that.

00:14:51.868 --> 00:14:53.340
- Wow.

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:54.520
- The shipyard parking.

00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.353
- Yeah.

00:14:55.353 --> 00:14:56.390
- Parking lot for ships.

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.323
That is crazy.

00:14:59.395 --> 00:15:02.312
- (dramatic music)

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.800
Harbour traffic, Five
Whiskey Tango is low level,

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.040
Queen Mary area manoeuvre.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.820
I think that was perfect, yeah.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.737
- Oh my God

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.200
- There's a go-kart
track on the top there.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.040
- Yeah, it's like there's a rollercoaster,

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.346
like a waterpark on top.

00:15:32.346 --> 00:15:33.179
- Yeah.

00:15:33.179 --> 00:15:34.012
Great.

00:15:34.012 --> 00:15:35.340
- Unbelievable.

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.760
- Alright, should we head home?

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:37.593
- Head home, man.

00:15:37.593 --> 00:15:38.426
- Okay, good

00:15:38.426 --> 00:15:39.710
- This is incredible, incredible flight.

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:42.330
So, John, I can tell you a secret now.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:43.163
- Yeah.

00:15:43.163 --> 00:15:44.420
- I think that I'm going to sign up

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.160

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.330

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:50.600

The spirit of that and I...

00:15:52.173 --> 00:15:53.119
- Excellent!

00:15:53.119 --> 00:15:54.510
- And I really want to
be flying just like this.

00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.100
It's just total freedom

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:57.720
and just pure enjoyment.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:00.110
- Excellent, well, you've
come to the right place.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.640
- Do you want me to land the plane?

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:02.473
- You want to?

00:16:02.473 --> 00:16:03.438
- We could do a home run away.

00:16:03.438 --> 00:16:04.271
- Oh really?

00:16:04.271 --> 00:16:05.113
- Yeah, you want to?

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:07.910
- (laughter) You're really a push pilot,

00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:09.590
you can let me do anything I want to.

00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:10.423
- Yeah

00:16:10.423 --> 00:16:12.954
- All right, I'll try
to guide to the runway.

00:16:12.954 --> 00:16:13.787
- Yes, good.

00:16:13.787 --> 00:16:14.870
- And I'll let you land then.

00:16:14.870 --> 00:16:17.794
- (radio chatter)

00:16:17.794 --> 00:16:18.627
- Dont.

00:16:19.958 --> 00:16:22.656
Push the stick to the right.

00:16:22.656 --> 00:16:23.489
- It's going to be hard to control.

00:16:23.489 --> 00:16:24.330
- Just cut this,

00:16:24.330 --> 00:16:25.604
look at that,

00:16:25.604 --> 00:16:26.790
oh we're going to die.

00:16:26.790 --> 00:16:27.911
Now we're not.

00:16:27.911 --> 00:16:29.440
- (laughter) Oh my God.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.470
- Oh maybe we got to...

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:32.803
Go with me on that.

00:16:34.843 --> 00:16:35.843
There we go.

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.810
You're going to make a quick correction...

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.950
Till you feel, now

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:46.740
- All right, I'll let you take over.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.800
- Go with it, go with me,

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.289
stay with me.

00:16:49.289 --> 00:16:50.180
- Whoa, we got birds.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.630
- So you see now,

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:53.980
I don't try to put it on the ground.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.220
I try and stay airborne,

00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.680
stay airborne.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.840
Stay airborne, stay airborne.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:03.060
- Ahhhh, it's like slowly
like pushing it in.

00:17:03.060 --> 00:17:05.020
- Yeah, you're trying to stay airborne

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:06.580
and then when the airplane's

00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:07.820
run out of speed and energy,

00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:09.167
it'll land by itself.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.950
Good sir, that was great!

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:13.783
Thank you very much!

00:17:13.783 --> 00:17:14.616
- Amazing!

00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:16.391
(dramatic music)

00:17:16.391 --> 00:17:17.224
(whoosh)

00:17:17.224 --> 00:17:18.244
(clink)

00:17:18.244 --> 00:17:20.077
(pop)
