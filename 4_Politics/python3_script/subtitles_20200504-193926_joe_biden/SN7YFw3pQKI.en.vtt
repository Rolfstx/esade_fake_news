00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.759
 President Donald Trump: The polarizing figure whose fortune lies in his heart 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.320
 Public figure. 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.309
 For decades Trump has introduced himself as a self-made billionaire who he started with 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.670
 Nothing is more than a million dollar loan from his father. 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.570
 And yet, as Donald's father, Fred Trump, has shown, he has had a much bigger role to play 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.150
 In the rise of his son to the fore. 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.000
 In this video, we'll look behind Trump billions, to see how he really got his real 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.940
 Real estate empire. 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.890
 This video was brought to you by Cheddar, from just released a great video on how some 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.940
 One of the most expensive apartments in New York City pays the property tax below your average 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.940
 Homepage. 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.149
 Find out how by watching their video. 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.120
 Donald's wealth story begins almost a century ago with the rise of his father. 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.739
 Fred Trump was a real fraudster. 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.269
 After losing his father at the age of 12, Farid had to learn how to work and make 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.839
 He got in was construction. 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.300
 He had built his first apartment house at the time when he was 20 years old 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.550
 In a very appropriate moment. 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.910
 As you can see, President Roosevelt just signed the new deal, which among other things he wanted 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.580
 To encourage residential construction, the provision of loans and very cheap subsidies that was uniquely 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.580
 Very eager to take. 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.310
 In fact, from the 1930s onwards America enacted housing subsidies after housing subsidies, beginning 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.390
 With the new deal, then with military housing during World War 2 and finally with post-war 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.540
 GI Bill's Enabled Housing Boom. 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.580
 US home ownership also jumped 20% in just 3 decades, Farid 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.900
 Trump has amassed a fortune, largely empowered by the enormous sums he received from the government. 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:59.250
 In 1949 alone, the FHA provided him with a $ 26 million loan to build two housing complexes in Brooklyn: 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.120
 Shore Haven and Haven Beach. 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.900
 Interesting though, it is not that he became rich using government money, and he is 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.990
 Actually very typical, but he started a massive campaign of transferring money to his country 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.330
 Children when he was only 40 years old. 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.950
 The many methods he used were simple, but effective. 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.060
 Before building those two apartment complexes in Brooklyn, Fred bought land that 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.170
 It will be based on the use of his company. 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.300
 Then he created the confidence that the beneficiaries were his children and donated the land 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.569
 To trust. 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.630
 Now because Farid Construction is no longer the owner of the land he wanted 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.720
 It must be rented out of confidence through a contract known as a land lease. 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.390
 Under this contract, you will gain more than $ 60,000 in confidence a year for the next 99 years, 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.630
 Creating a steady stream of income for Donald at the time was only 3 years old. 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.860
 But the leasing contracts were just the beginning because over the next twenty years, it was unique 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.210
 Begin to move the buildings themselves to his children. 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.099
 He buys a plot of land through an empty company, building apartments on that with 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.910
 Government funds and he will gift the company's shares directly to his sons. 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.400
 Now, this is not a very complicated scheme: in fact it actually bears a lot of gift tax, 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.150
 Which uniquely does not seem to be paid. 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.020
 If you go through his tax returns, it shows that he has paid a gift tax on only one of the original 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.610
 Eight buildings moved in this way. 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.000
 He built it in partnership for $ 2.5 million in 1968 and after a year of talented people 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.950
 15% of the partnership for each one of his children. 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.950
 If you do math the gift tax should come close to 100 thousand dollars, but he only paid six a and 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.950
 Half. 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.770
 Of course, it should be noted that Fred Trump has been followed up by New York State 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:50.400
 Several times during the 50s and 60s to pay tax. 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.569
 Despite these issues, he had no problem getting millions of dollars in support, 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.500
 No doubt thanks to his political connections. 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.709
 In fact, during this period Farid had built his greatest project, Trump Village, 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:08.430
 Who earned $ 50 million from New York State which will also 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.260
 He moved to Donald by dubious means, but this happens later. 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.420
 After graduating from college in 1968, Donald of course went to work for his father's 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.330
 This is when the wealth transfer really kicked into high gear. 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:29.560
 In 1972, Donald and his father formed a partnership to secure a $ 8 million loan to build Prospect 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.860
 tower. 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.300
 Interestingly enough, although it is unique who did all the work, most of the profits 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.840
 He went to Donald. 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.920
 At the head of his share of the partnership, he was receiving consulting and management 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.419
 Fees, as well as all tenants paid to rent air conditioners. 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:52.180
 By 1975 Donald would have earned just over $ 300,000 for the whole year from this building and if I were the amount 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.580
 Everything else arrives, by the time he was 29 he had received $ 9 million from his father. 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.610
 Of course, a unique goal was not only to enrich Donald, but to build an image of 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.570
 Him to help start his career. 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:11.430
 In 1976 Donald put his net worth at $ 200 million, when in reality the projects 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.280
 He was claiming as if he really was his father. 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.670
 At the time, Donald was the president of the Trump organization, which she bore with 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:25.530
 Huge salary, but moreover he was constantly receiving loans from Fred. 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:31.270
 In 1979 Donald received loans for a total of $ 3 million from his father's companies 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.830
 And the way these loans are structured is very exciting. 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.050
 They came with a certain amount of interest, but it was paid off as soon as it was a loan 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.800
 I took out and because the loan had no repayment, Donald's plan was free to keep the money indefinitely. 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.570
 These loans and many more came flooding Donald's portfolio when he first started 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:58.800
 A project in Manhattan, the Dean converted a hotel into a Grand Hyatt hotel between 1979 and 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:59.800
 In 1980. 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.150
 The exact same loans will show a second time when Donald was building Trump Tower 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.840
 Between 1980 and 1983. 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:10.970
 During this time Fred mastermind is another scheme for his children. 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:15.690
 Using multiple trusts, he would buy mortgages of at least 14 of his properties 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.560
 He would take them to the funds, whose beneficiaries were, of course, Donald's 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:21.790
 His brothers. 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.700
 Effectively, during the 1980s Donald became a banker for his father, although he never did 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.450
 Already provided mortgage loans, he only pocketed their interest payments. 

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:36.610
 By the end of the eighties all distribution methods transferred nearly 50 million dollars 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.550
 Donald of his father's empire, but that only encouraged him to take greater 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.550
 Risks. 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:49.160
 In 1988 he bought the Plaza Hotel for more than $ 400 million, and a year later he spent more 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:55.410
 $ 350 million on Eastern Airways, which is named after the strange shuttle Trump. 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.449
 The most famous of all, of course, is Donald entering the business casino of the Atlantic 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:00.449
 City. 

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:05.330
 While this story is broad enough for every video on its own, what matters is when 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.500
 Donald casinos started failing in the early nineties, it was Fred who supported matters 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.500
 above. 

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.340
 Donald personally gave millions to prevent his casinos from defaulting 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.270
 Before bankruptcy procedures they can be restructured to give the casinos more time to pay 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:22.509
 Loans. 

00:07:22.509 --> 00:07:29.050
 For example, Farid's personal income increased by order of magnitude to $ 50 million, which 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.860
 A $ 12 million tax bill incurred. 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.960
 During this time, no major debt made payments or charitable donations, and frugal 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.080
 A man like him will never pay taxes, so the money must have gone somewhere. 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:49.490
 Around the same time, a unique employee, who went to Trump Castle Casino, bought $ 3.35 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.419
 Million dollars of casino chips left without placing any bets. 

00:07:54.419 --> 00:07:58.800
 Another unique method used is to actually purchase stakes in Donald properties and then 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.669
 To re-sell them puzzled a few years later. 

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:10.110
 In 1987 he bought 7.5% of Trump Palace, a 55-storey building in Manhattan, finished 

00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:12.190
 15 million dollars. 

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:18.400
 Just four years later, Farid again sold a stake of just $ 10,000, arguing that 

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.650
 The work failed, although it was not. 

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:28.940
 In fact, in the same year that Trump Palace sold 57 apartments for more than $ 50 million. 

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:34.289
 In the early 1990s, however, Fred Health began to decline and even began to emerge 

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.260
 Symptoms of dementia. 

00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:40.130
 Because he still did not transfer most of his wealth to his children 

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:45.520
 An impressive program began to withdraw everything he had left for them without paying real estate 

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:47.870
 Taxes before his death. 

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:54.080
 In 1992, his sons maintenance of the company that immediately became a sub-contractor 

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.140
 For all buildings uniquely. 

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:00.480
 All millions of dollars uniquely spent on fixes and improvements started 

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:05.190
 This company goes through one and they all incur a big sign. 

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.470
 Over the next few years the costs uniquely went the empire way. 

00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:15.860
 In the case of Beach Haven, garbage compression increased services by 64%; The guard 

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.870
 Supplies increased 100%, plumbing increased 120%. 

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:27.300
 In 1994 Donald and his brothers also became more unique building managers 

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.389
 Drain cash from his empire. 

00:09:29.389 --> 00:09:36.140
 By 1999 the unique mastermind methods were providing each of his children $ 2.2 

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.240
 Million in income annually. 

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.720
 Ultimately, when the day came to impart the same properties, the only thing 

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.830
 Who would have mattered how much the buildings would be so appreciated by Donald 

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:53.920
 Bro hired the notorious real estate appraiser to help them with their problem. 

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:59.940
 Using a variety of methods, he dropped the price of 25 apartment blocks by 7,000 

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:03.260
 Units to only $ 40 million. 

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:07.800
 The most hilarious method was the one by two buildings in Trump 

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:11.070
 The village actually has a negative value. 

00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:17.640
 As you can see, in 1992, Farid removed these two types of buildings from the affordable housing program 

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:24.320
 So he can raise the rents, but he does that I lost their tax exemption under this program. 

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.980
 This creates a one-time accounting fee this, if you base your evaluation on that, makes 

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:33.230
 The building seems to be unprofitable although definitely not. 

00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:39.149
 In the end, transferring the whole real Farid cost the real estate empire to him $ 20 million. 

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:44.800
 When Farid died in 1999 he had only $ 2 million in the bank and all of his property 

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.950
 He spent seven decades assembling who were now in the hands of his children. 

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:53.480
 Here's the funny thing: only five a year later, when Donald Atlantic City 

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:58.860
 The casinos were once again on the verge of bankruptcy, convincing his siblings to sell whole 

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.860
 Component, essence, design. 

00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:05.760
 In early 2004, Donald and his brothers sold sisters off the empire and their father was 

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:13.040
 He spent his entire life gathering to the New York City real estate investor with $ 700 million, 

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.709
 Officially put an end to Fred Trump's legacy. 

00:11:16.709 --> 00:11:22.149
 Of course, since then Donald has continued doing business and today his net worth is 

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:27.500
 It is estimated at around $ 3 billion, clearly though it got a massive start from 

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:30.820
 His father, he accomplished a lot on his own. 

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:35.750
 Regarding Fred Trump's legitimacy, ways to avoid taxes, even if they turn 

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:41.340
 To be criminal, the statute of limitations for them ended long ago, so Donald 

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:44.280
 He can only be fined with penalties. 

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.230
 Speaking of avoiding taxes, New York City has come with it, to the point that owners 

00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:54.890
 Hundreds of millions of apartments pay less in real estate taxes than an average home. 

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:59.070
 Sometimes as low as 0.017%. 

00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:02.920
 If you're curious how they get away from that, you should head to Cheddar, 

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.260
 Who made a great video on exactly this topic. 

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.540
 If you don't know, Cheddar Channel is the home to many fun videos covering 

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:13.860
 Business and technology and if you don't have them you should definitely go and check 

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.720
 Out and even consider subscribing. 

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.510
 In any case, thanks for watching. 

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.810
 You'll see me again in two weeks, until then: be smart.
