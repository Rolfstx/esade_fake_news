00:00:00.734 --> 00:00:01.334
The President: Thank you.

00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:04.404
(applause)

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:08.700
Thank you so much.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.914
Madam Chairwoman, thank you
so much for your kind words

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.450
and your leadership.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.720
To Prime Minister
Hailemariam, and the people

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.325
of Ethiopia -- once again,
thank you for your wonderful

00:00:25.325 --> 00:00:28.128
hospitality and for
hosting this

00:00:28.128 --> 00:00:29.662
pan-African institution.

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.664
(applause)

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:36.936
To members of the African
Union, distinguished guests,

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:40.607
ladies and gentlemen --
thank you for welcoming me

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:42.275
here today.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:46.012
It is a great honor to be
the first President of the

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:48.181
United States to address
the African Union.

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:53.553
(applause)

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:57.323
I'm grateful for this
opportunity to speak to the

00:00:57.323 --> 00:01:00.093
representatives of more than
one billion people of the

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.327
great African continent.

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:04.597
(applause)

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:08.568
We're joined today by
citizens, by leaders of

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:12.272
civil society, by faith
communities, and I'm

00:01:12.272 --> 00:01:14.874
especially pleased to see so
many young people who embody

00:01:14.874 --> 00:01:17.377
the energy and optimism
of today's Africa.

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.077
Hello!

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.879
Thank you for being here.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:23.483
(applause)

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:32.192
I stand before you
as a proud American.

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:34.527
I also stand before you
as the son of an African.

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:37.363
(applause)

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:47.240
Africa and its people helped
to shape America and allowed

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.542
it to become the great
nation that it is.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:53.546
And Africa and its people
have helped shape who I am

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.282
and how I see the world.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:02:00.954
In the villages in Kenya
where my father was born, I

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:04.991
learned of my ancestors, and
the life of my grandfather,

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:10.763
the dreams of my father, the
bonds of family that connect

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:15.435
us all as Africans
and Americans.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:17.737
As parents, Michelle and I
want to make sure that our

00:02:17.737 --> 00:02:21.741
two daughters know their
heritage -- European and

00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:25.211
African, in all of its
strengths and all of

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.780
its struggle.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.416
So we've taken our daughters
and stood with them on the

00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:35.555
shores of West Africa, in
those doors of no return,

00:02:35.555 --> 00:02:38.591
mindful that their ancestors
were both slaves and

00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:41.494
slave owners.

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:44.998
We've stood with them in
that small cell on Robben

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:49.369
Island where Madiba showed
the world that, no matter

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:52.205
the nature of his physical
confinement, he alone was

00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:54.007
the master of his fate.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.076
(applause)

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.053
For us, for our children,
Africa and its people teach

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:12.125
us a powerful lesson -- that
we must uphold the inherent

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:14.494
dignity of every
human being.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:21.734
Dignity -- that basic idea
that by virtue of our common

00:03:21.734 --> 00:03:26.239
humanity, no matter where we
come from, or what we look

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.744
like, we are all born equal,
touched by the grace of God.

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:33.146
(applause)

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:34.480
Every person has worth.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.715
Every person matters.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.651
Every person deserves to be
treated with decency

00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:40.887
and respect.

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.592
Throughout much of history,
mankind did not see this.

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:53.266
Dignity was seen as a virtue
reserved to those of rank

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:56.536
and privilege,
kings and elders.

00:03:59.005 --> 00:04:01.841
It took a revolution of the
spirit, over many centuries,

00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.777
to open our eyes to the
dignity of every person.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.815
And around the world,
generations have struggled

00:04:08.815 --> 00:04:13.119
to put this idea into
practice in laws

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.121
and in institutions.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.892
So, too, here in Africa.

00:04:21.694 --> 00:04:24.964
This is the cradle of
humanity, and ancient

00:04:24.964 --> 00:04:27.967
African kingdoms were home
to great libraries

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.969
and universities.

00:04:31.738 --> 00:04:37.543
But the evil of slavery took
root not only abroad, but

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.545
here on the continent.

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.684
Colonialism skewed Africa's
economy and robbed people of

00:04:44.684 --> 00:04:46.686
their capacity to shape
their own destiny.

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.791
Eventually, liberation
movements grew.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:56.295
And 50 years ago, in a great
burst of self-determination,

00:04:56.295 --> 00:05:00.400
Africans rejoiced as foreign
flags came down and your

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.567
national flags went up.

00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:03.803
(applause)

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:09.842
As South Africa's Albert
Luthuli said at the time,

00:05:09.842 --> 00:05:12.245
"the basis for peace and
brotherhood in Africa is

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:14.681
being restored by the
resurrection of national

00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:17.950
sovereignty and
independence, of equality

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.952
and the dignity of man."

00:05:23.022 --> 00:05:27.326
A half-century into this
independence era, it is long

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:31.030
past time to put aside old
stereotypes of an Africa

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.966
forever mired in
poverty and conflict.

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:38.271
The world must recognize
Africa's extraordinary progress.

00:05:38.271 --> 00:05:40.573
Today, Africa is one of the
fastest-growing regions in

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:41.941
the world.

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:44.410
Africa's middle class is
projected to grow to more

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.178
than one billion consumers.

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:49.315
(applause)

00:05:49.315 --> 00:05:51.784
With hundreds of millions
of mobile phones, surging

00:05:51.784 --> 00:05:58.891
access to the Internet,
Africans are beginning to

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:01.294
leapfrog old technologies
into new prosperity.

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.767
Africa is on the move, a
new Africa is emerging.

00:06:10.636 --> 00:06:13.106
Propelled by this progress,
and in partnership with the

00:06:13.106 --> 00:06:16.976
world, Africa has achieved
historic gains in health.

00:06:16.976 --> 00:06:23.683
The rate of new HIV/AIDS
infections has plummeted.

00:06:23.683 --> 00:06:26.252
African mothers are more
likely to survive childbirth

00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:29.255
and have healthy babies.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:33.226
Deaths from malaria have
been slashed, saving the

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:37.063
lives of millions
of African children.

00:06:37.063 --> 00:06:41.033
Millions have been lifted
from extreme poverty.

00:06:41.033 --> 00:06:43.569
Africa has led the world in
sending more children to school.

00:06:45.938 --> 00:06:49.142
In other words, more and
more African men, women and

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.477
children are living with
dignity and with hope.

00:06:51.477 --> 00:06:55.515
(applause)

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:58.618
And Africa's progress
can also be seen in the

00:06:58.618 --> 00:07:02.588
institutions that bring
us together today.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:04.590
When I first came to
Sub-Saharan Africa as a

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.893
President, I said that
Africa doesn't need

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:09.228
strongmen, it needs
strong institutions.

00:07:09.228 --> 00:07:13.099
(applause)

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:15.935
And one of those
institutions can be the

00:07:15.935 --> 00:07:18.204
African Union.

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:20.873
Here, you can come together,
with a shared commitment to

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:23.576
human dignity
and development.

00:07:23.576 --> 00:07:26.445
Here, your 54 nations pursue
a common vision of an

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:28.614
"integrated, prosperous
and peaceful Africa."

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:33.886
As Africa changes, I've
called on the world to

00:07:33.886 --> 00:07:35.721
change its
approach to Africa.

00:07:35.721 --> 00:07:40.092
(applause)

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:43.830
So many Africans have told
me, we don't want just aid,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.799
we want trade that
fuels progress.

00:07:46.799 --> 00:07:49.268
We don't want patrons, we
want partners who help us

00:07:49.268 --> 00:07:51.270
build our own
capacity to grow.

00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:55.274
(applause)

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:57.543
We don't want the indignity
of dependence, we want to

00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:01.013
make our own choices and
determine our own future.

00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:03.482
As President, I've worked
to transform America's

00:08:03.482 --> 00:08:06.552
relationship with Africa
-- so that we're truly

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:08.688
listening to our African
friends and working

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:12.124
together, as equal partners.

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:15.595
And I'm proud of the
progress that we've made.

00:08:15.595 --> 00:08:19.765
We've boosted American
exports to this region, part

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:23.870
of trade that supports jobs
for Africans and Americans.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:26.339
To sustain our momentum --
and with the bipartisan

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.808
support of some of the
outstanding members of

00:08:28.808 --> 00:08:31.410
Congress who are here today
-- 20 of them who are here

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.981
today -- I recently signed
the 10-year renewal of the

00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:35.548
African Growth and
Opportunity Act.

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:36.749
(applause)

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:37.717
And I want to
thank them all.

00:08:37.717 --> 00:08:39.819
Why don't they stand very
briefly so you can see them,

00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:41.020
because they've done
outstanding work.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.056
(applause)

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:55.001
We've launched major
initiatives to promote food

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:59.505
security, and public health
and access to electricity,

00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:01.774
and to prepare the next
generation of African

00:09:01.774 --> 00:09:05.011
leaders and entrepreneurs
--investments that will help

00:09:05.011 --> 00:09:07.580
fuel Africa's rise
for decades to come.

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:14.153
Last year, as the Chairwoman
noted, I welcomed nearly 50

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:16.555
African presidents and prime
ministers to Washington so

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:18.958
we could begin a new
chapter of cooperation.

00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.928
And by coming to the African
Union today, I'm looking to

00:09:21.928 --> 00:09:24.797
build on that commitment.

00:09:24.797 --> 00:09:27.700
I believe Africa's rise
is not just important for

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:31.370
Africa, it's important
to the entire world.

00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:35.141
We will not be able to meet
the challenges of our time

00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:38.044
-- from ensuring a strong
global economy to facing

00:09:38.044 --> 00:09:41.614
down violent extremism, to
combating climate change, to

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:44.583
ending hunger and extreme
poverty -- without the

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:47.787
voices and contributions
of one billion Africans.

00:09:47.787 --> 00:09:50.756
(applause)

00:09:52.758 --> 00:09:59.265
Now, even with Africa's
impressive progress, we must

00:09:59.265 --> 00:10:01.934
acknowledge that many of
these gains rest on a

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.936
fragile foundation.

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:08.174
Alongside new wealth,
hundreds of millions of

00:10:08.174 --> 00:10:12.345
Africans still endure
extreme poverty.

00:10:12.345 --> 00:10:17.049
Alongside high-tech hubs of
innovation, many Africans

00:10:17.049 --> 00:10:19.418
are crowded into shantytowns
without power or running

00:10:19.418 --> 00:10:22.121
water -- a level of poverty
that's an assault

00:10:22.121 --> 00:10:24.123
on human dignity.

00:10:25.391 --> 00:10:28.294
Moreover, as the youngest
and fastest-growing

00:10:28.294 --> 00:10:31.063
continent, Africa's
population in the coming

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:34.567
decades will double to some
two billion people, and many

00:10:34.567 --> 00:10:36.936
of them will be
young, under 18.

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:41.440
Now, on the one hand, this
could bring tremendous

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.609
opportunities as these
young Africans harness new

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:47.146
technologies and ignite
new growth and reforms.

00:10:49.248 --> 00:10:53.552
Economists will tell you
that countries, regions,

00:10:53.552 --> 00:10:56.455
continents grow faster
with younger populations.

00:10:56.455 --> 00:11:04.263
It's a demographic edge and
advantage -- but only if

00:11:04.263 --> 00:11:07.566
those young people
are being trained.

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:09.969
We need only to look at the
Middle East and North Africa

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:14.106
to see that large numbers of
young people with no jobs

00:11:14.106 --> 00:11:21.680
and stifled voices can fuel
instability and disorder.

00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:24.116
I suggest to you that the
most urgent task facing

00:11:24.116 --> 00:11:28.154
Africa today and for
decades ahead is to create

00:11:28.154 --> 00:11:29.955
opportunity for this
next generation.

00:11:29.955 --> 00:11:32.992
(applause)

00:11:37.163 --> 00:11:40.032
And this will be an
enormous undertaking.

00:11:40.032 --> 00:11:44.003
Africa will need to generate
millions more jobs than it's

00:11:44.003 --> 00:11:45.137
doing right now.

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:49.075
And time is of the essence.

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:51.377
The choices made today will
shape the trajectory of

00:11:51.377 --> 00:11:54.980
Africa, and therefore, the
world for decades to come.

00:11:57.383 --> 00:12:01.420
And as your partner and your
friend, allow me to suggest

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.422
several ways that we
can meet this

00:12:03.422 --> 00:12:05.424
challenge together.

00:12:06.959 --> 00:12:09.128
Africa's progress will
depend on unleashing

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:13.466
economic growth -- not just
for the few at the top, but

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:16.969
for the many, because an
essential element of dignity

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:17.770
is being able to
live a decent life.

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:21.273
(applause)

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:24.043
That begins with a job.

00:12:24.043 --> 00:12:27.913
And that requires
trade and investment.

00:12:27.913 --> 00:12:30.549
Many of your nations have
made important reforms to

00:12:30.549 --> 00:12:33.185
attract investment -- it's
been a spark for growth.

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:38.324
But in many places across
Africa, it's still too hard

00:12:38.324 --> 00:12:44.763
to start a venture, still
too hard to build a business.

00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:46.966
Governments that take
additional reforms to make

00:12:46.966 --> 00:12:50.503
doing business easier will
have an eager partner in the

00:12:50.503 --> 00:12:51.170
United States.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:54.340
(applause)

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:57.610
And that includes reforms to
help Africa trade more with

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.247
itself -- as the Chairwoman
and I discussed before we

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:03.983
came out here today --
because the biggest markets

00:13:03.983 --> 00:13:07.153
for your goods are
often right next door.

00:13:07.153 --> 00:13:11.390
You don't have to just look
overseas for growth, you can

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.292
look internally.

00:13:13.292 --> 00:13:16.262
And our work to help Africa
modernize customs and border

00:13:16.262 --> 00:13:19.865
crossings started with the
East African Community --

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:21.867
now we're expanding
our efforts across the

00:13:21.867 --> 00:13:23.869
continent, because it
shouldn't be harder for

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:26.272
African countries to trade
with each other than it is

00:13:26.272 --> 00:13:28.507
for you to trade with
Europe and America.

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:33.245
(applause)

00:13:33.245 --> 00:13:34.346
Now, most U.S.

00:13:34.346 --> 00:13:37.950
trade with the region is
with just three countries --

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:42.821
South Africa, Nigeria and
Angola -- and much of that

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:45.624
is in the form of energy.

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:47.626
I want Africans and
Americans doing more

00:13:47.626 --> 00:13:51.764
business together in more
sectors, in more countries.

00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:53.866
So we're increasing trade
missions to places like

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:58.070
Tanzania, Ethiopia
Mozambique.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.072
We're working to help more
Africans get their

00:14:00.072 --> 00:14:02.441
goods to market.

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:04.743
Next year, we'll host
another U.S.-Africa Business

00:14:04.743 --> 00:14:07.580
Forum to mobilize billions
of dollars in new trade and

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.416
investment -- so we're
buying more of each other's

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:13.319
products and all
growing together.

00:14:13.319 --> 00:14:16.789
Now, the United States isn't
the only country that sees

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:19.124
your growth as
an opportunity.

00:14:19.124 --> 00:14:21.260
And that is a good thing.

00:14:22.461 --> 00:14:25.164
When more countries invest
responsibly in Africa, it

00:14:25.164 --> 00:14:28.801
creates more jobs and
prosperity for us all.

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:33.405
So I want to encourage
everybody to do business

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:36.575
with Africa, and African
countries should want to do

00:14:36.575 --> 00:14:38.777
business with every country.

00:14:41.347 --> 00:14:45.484
But economic relationships
can't simply be about

00:14:45.484 --> 00:14:48.454
building countries'
infrastructure with foreign

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:51.790
labor or extracting
Africa's natural resources.

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:54.460
Real economic partnerships
have to be a good deal for

00:14:54.460 --> 00:14:57.763
Africa -- they have to
create jobs and capacity

00:14:57.763 --> 00:14:58.197
for Africans.

00:14:58.197 --> 00:15:01.400
(applause)

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:05.804
And that includes the point
that Chairwoman Zuma made

00:15:05.804 --> 00:15:10.309
about illicit flows with
multinationals -- which is

00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:12.311
one of the reasons that
we've been a leading

00:15:12.311 --> 00:15:15.781
advocate, working with the
G7, to assist in making sure

00:15:15.781 --> 00:15:19.418
that there's honest
accounting when businesses

00:15:19.418 --> 00:15:21.520
are investing here in
Africa, and making sure that

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:26.859
capital flows are
properly accounted for.

00:15:26.859 --> 00:15:30.596
That's the kind of
partnership America offers.

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:36.602
Nothing will unlock Africa's
economic potential more than

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:37.970
ending the cancer
of corruption.

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:39.905
(applause)

00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:42.808
And you are right that it
is not just a problem of

00:15:42.808 --> 00:15:45.177
Africa, it is a problem of
those who do business

00:15:45.177 --> 00:15:46.812
with Africa.

00:15:46.812 --> 00:15:49.815
It is not unique to Africa
-- corruption exists all

00:15:49.815 --> 00:15:52.184
over the world, including
in the United States.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:56.455
But here in Africa,
corruption drains billions

00:15:56.455 --> 00:15:59.425
of dollars from economies
that can't afford to lose

00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:02.594
billions of dollars --
that's money that could be

00:16:02.594 --> 00:16:07.566
used to create jobs and
build hospitals and schools.

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:09.868
And when someone has to pay
a bribe just to start a

00:16:09.868 --> 00:16:14.039
business or go to school, or
get an official to do the

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:17.943
job they're supposed to be
doing anyway -- that's not

00:16:17.943 --> 00:16:18.610
"the African way."

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.512
(applause)

00:16:20.512 --> 00:16:23.682
It undermines the dignity of
the people you represent.

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:29.588
Only Africans can end
corruption in their countries.

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:35.260
As African governments
commit to taking action, the

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:38.097
United States will work
with you to combat illicit

00:16:38.097 --> 00:16:41.567
financing, and promote good
governance and transparency

00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:42.568
and rule of law.

00:16:42.568 --> 00:16:46.105
And we already have strong
laws in place that say to U.S.

00:16:46.105 --> 00:16:50.008
companies, you can't engage
in bribery to try to get

00:16:50.008 --> 00:16:54.313
business -- which not
all countries have.

00:16:54.313 --> 00:16:56.315
And we actually enforce
it and police it.

00:16:56.315 --> 00:17:01.954
And let me add that criminal
networks are both fueling

00:17:01.954 --> 00:17:05.023
corruption and threatening
Africa's precious wildlife

00:17:05.023 --> 00:17:07.526
-- and with it, the tourism
that many African economies

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:08.527
count on.

00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.562
So America also stands with
you in the fight against

00:17:10.562 --> 00:17:12.965
wildlife trafficking.

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:14.099
That's something that
has to be addressed.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.268
(applause)

00:17:16.268 --> 00:17:22.674
But, ultimately, the most
powerful antidote to the old

00:17:22.674 --> 00:17:27.713
ways of doing things is this
new generation of African youth.

00:17:27.713 --> 00:17:31.450
History shows that the
nations that do best are the

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:33.619
ones that invest in the
education of their people.

00:17:33.619 --> 00:17:36.522
(applause)

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:43.896
You see, in this information
age, jobs can flow anywhere,

00:17:43.896 --> 00:17:46.565
and they typically will
flow to where workers are

00:17:46.565 --> 00:17:49.735
literate and highly
skilled and online.

00:17:49.735 --> 00:17:53.172
And Africa's young people
are ready to compete.

00:17:53.172 --> 00:17:58.510
I've met them -- they are
hungry, they are eager.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:00.946
They're willing
to work hard.

00:18:00.946 --> 00:18:02.948
So we've got to
invest in them.

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:06.218
As Africa invests
in education, our

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:10.155
entrepreneurship programs
are helping innovators start

00:18:10.155 --> 00:18:14.293
new businesses and create
jobs right here in Africa.

00:18:14.293 --> 00:18:16.695
And the men and women in
our Young African Leaders

00:18:16.695 --> 00:18:19.932
Initiative today will be the
leaders who can transform

00:18:19.932 --> 00:18:22.167
business and civil society
and governments tomorrow.

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:28.173
Africa's progress will
depend on development that

00:18:28.173 --> 00:18:33.045
truly lifts countries from
poverty to prosperity --

00:18:33.045 --> 00:18:38.684
because people everywhere
deserve the dignity of a

00:18:38.684 --> 00:18:40.686
life free from want.

00:18:42.187 --> 00:18:45.090
A child born in Africa today
is just as equal and just as

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:49.828
worthy as a child born in
Asia or Europe or America.

00:18:49.828 --> 00:18:52.598
At the recent development
conference here in Addis,

00:18:52.598 --> 00:18:55.267
African leadership helped
forge a new global compact

00:18:55.267 --> 00:18:58.103
for financing that
fuels development.

00:18:58.103 --> 00:19:00.973
And under the AU's
leadership, the voice of a

00:19:00.973 --> 00:19:03.208
united Africa will help
shape the world's next set

00:19:03.208 --> 00:19:07.246
of development goals, and
you're pursuing a vision of

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:11.216
the future that you
want for Africa.

00:19:11.216 --> 00:19:13.886
And America's approach to
development -- the central

00:19:13.886 --> 00:19:16.955
focus of our engagement with
Africa -- is focused on

00:19:16.955 --> 00:19:19.925
helping you build your own
capacity to realize that vision.

00:19:22.327 --> 00:19:25.364
Instead of just shipping
food aid to Africa, we've

00:19:25.364 --> 00:19:27.699
helped more than two million
farmers use new techniques

00:19:27.699 --> 00:19:32.604
to boost their yields, feed
more people, reduce hunger.

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:35.173
With our new alliance of
government and the private

00:19:35.173 --> 00:19:37.576
sector investing billions
of dollars in African

00:19:37.576 --> 00:19:39.778
agriculture, I believe we
can achieve our goal and

00:19:39.778 --> 00:19:42.114
lift 50 million
Africans from poverty.

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:47.119
Instead of just sending aid
to build power plants, our

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.421
Power Africa initiative
is mobilizing billions of

00:19:49.421 --> 00:19:52.057
dollars in investments from
governments and businesses

00:19:52.057 --> 00:19:54.059
to reduce the number of
Africans living

00:19:54.059 --> 00:19:56.595
without electricity.

00:19:56.595 --> 00:19:59.197
Now, an undertaking of this
magnitude will not be quick.

00:19:59.197 --> 00:20:00.465
It will take many years.

00:20:00.465 --> 00:20:02.434
But working together,
I believe we can bring

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:05.704
electricity to more than 60
million African homes and

00:20:05.704 --> 00:20:08.540
businesses and connect more
Africans to the global economy.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:13.378
(applause)

00:20:13.378 --> 00:20:16.615
Instead of just telling
Africa, you're on your own,

00:20:16.615 --> 00:20:19.084
in dealing with climate
change, we're delivering new

00:20:19.084 --> 00:20:23.088
tools and financing to more
than 40 African nations to

00:20:23.088 --> 00:20:26.291
help them prepare and adapt.

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:30.329
By harnessing the wind and
sun, your vast geothermal

00:20:30.329 --> 00:20:33.966
energy and rivers for
hydropower, you can turn

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:37.736
this climate threat into
an economic opportunity.

00:20:37.736 --> 00:20:40.973
And I urge Africa to join
us in rejecting old divides

00:20:40.973 --> 00:20:44.309
between North and South so
we can forge a strong global

00:20:44.309 --> 00:20:46.645
climate agreement
this year in Paris.

00:20:46.645 --> 00:20:49.181
Because sparing some of the
world's poorest people from

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:53.585
rising seas, more intense
droughts, shortages of water

00:20:53.585 --> 00:20:56.888
and food is a matter of
survival and a matter of

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:58.890
human dignity.

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:03.195
Instead of just sending
medicine, we're investing in

00:21:03.195 --> 00:21:06.865
better treatments and
helping Africa prevent and

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:08.867
treat diseases.

00:21:10.335 --> 00:21:12.304
As the United States
continues to provide

00:21:12.304 --> 00:21:15.407
billions of dollars in the
fight against HIV/AIDS, and

00:21:15.407 --> 00:21:18.210
as your countries take
greater ownership of health

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.979
programs, we're moving
toward a historic

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:24.883
accomplishment -- the first
AIDS-free generation.

00:21:24.883 --> 00:21:30.288
(applause)

00:21:30.288 --> 00:21:33.959
And if the world learned
anything from Ebola, it's

00:21:33.959 --> 00:21:37.663
that the best way to prevent
epidemics is to build strong

00:21:37.663 --> 00:21:40.966
public health systems that
stop diseases from spreading

00:21:40.966 --> 00:21:42.267
in the first place.

00:21:42.267 --> 00:21:44.903
So America is proud to
partner with the AU and

00:21:44.903 --> 00:21:47.806
African countries
in this mission.

00:21:47.806 --> 00:21:51.176
Today, I can announce that
of the $1 billion that the

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:54.146
United States is devoting
to this work globally, half

00:21:54.146 --> 00:21:56.214
will support efforts
here in Africa.

00:21:56.214 --> 00:22:02.054
(applause)

00:22:02.054 --> 00:22:04.656
I believe Africa's progress
will also depend on

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:10.228
democracy, because Africans,
like people everywhere,

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:13.532
deserve the dignity of being
in control of their own lives.

00:22:13.532 --> 00:22:19.037
(applause)

00:22:19.037 --> 00:22:21.973
We all know what the
ingredients of real

00:22:21.973 --> 00:22:24.276
democracy are.

00:22:24.276 --> 00:22:28.180
They include free and fair
elections, but also freedom

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:33.485
of speech and the press,
freedom of assembly.

00:22:33.485 --> 00:22:34.820
These rights are universal.

00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:36.621
They're written into
African constitutions.

00:22:36.621 --> 00:22:42.227
(applause)

00:22:42.227 --> 00:22:45.864
The African Charter on Human
and Peoples Rights declares

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:48.934
that "every individual
shall have the right to the

00:22:48.934 --> 00:22:52.270
respect of the dignity
inherent in a human being."

00:22:54.506 --> 00:22:59.678
From Sierra Leone, Ghana,
Benin, to Botswana, Namibia,

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:04.149
South Africa, democracy
has taken root.

00:23:04.149 --> 00:23:07.085
In Nigeria, more than 28
million voters bravely cast

00:23:07.085 --> 00:23:10.355
their ballots and power
transferred as it should

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:10.922
-- peacefully.

00:23:10.922 --> 00:23:14.526
(applause)

00:23:14.526 --> 00:23:20.632
Yet at this very moment,
these same freedoms are

00:23:20.632 --> 00:23:22.634
denied to many Africans.

00:23:25.003 --> 00:23:27.873
And I have to proclaim,
democracy is not just

00:23:27.873 --> 00:23:28.907
formal elections.

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:31.176
(applause)

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:44.222
When journalists are put
behind bars for doing their

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:47.392
jobs, or activists are
threatened as governments

00:23:47.392 --> 00:23:48.894
crack down on
civil society -

00:23:48.894 --> 00:23:52.931
(applause)

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:55.033
-- then you may have
democracy in name, but not

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:55.834
in substance.

00:23:55.834 --> 00:24:00.605
(applause)

00:24:00.605 --> 00:24:03.375
And I'm convinced that
nations cannot realize the

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:06.645
full promise of independence
until they fully protect the

00:24:06.645 --> 00:24:08.647
rights of their people.

00:24:09.848 --> 00:24:12.250
And this is true even for
countries that have made

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:14.286
important democratic
progress.

00:24:16.922 --> 00:24:19.724
As I indicated during
my visit to Kenya, the

00:24:19.724 --> 00:24:23.795
remarkable gains that
country has made with a new

00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:27.999
constitution, with its
election, cannot be

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:32.037
jeopardized by restrictions
on civil society.

00:24:32.037 --> 00:24:36.107
Likewise, our host,
Ethiopians have much to be

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:40.579
proud of -- I've been amazed
at all the wonderful work

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:43.782
that's being done here --
and it's true that the

00:24:43.782 --> 00:24:46.618
elections that took place
here occurred without violence.

00:24:46.618 --> 00:24:49.287
But as I discussed with
Prime Minister Hailemariam,

00:24:49.287 --> 00:24:51.289
that's just the
start of democracy.

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:55.360
I believe Ethiopia will not
fully unleash the potential

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.798
of its people if journalists
are restricted or legitimate

00:24:59.798 --> 00:25:02.634
opposition groups can't
participate in the

00:25:02.634 --> 00:25:03.635
campaign process.

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:06.304
And, to his credit, the
Prime Minister acknowledged

00:25:06.304 --> 00:25:09.474
that more work will need to
be done for Ethiopia to be a

00:25:09.474 --> 00:25:11.509
full-fledged,
sustainable democracy.

00:25:11.509 --> 00:25:13.511
(applause)

00:25:16.248 --> 00:25:19.651
So these are conversations
we have to have as friends.

00:25:19.651 --> 00:25:23.388
Our American democracy
is not perfect.

00:25:25.757 --> 00:25:27.459
We've worked for
many years --

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:29.027
(applause)

00:25:29.027 --> 00:25:34.165
-- but one thing we do is
we continually reexamine to

00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:37.068
figure out how can we make
our democracy better.

00:25:37.068 --> 00:25:39.771
And that's a force of
strength for us, being

00:25:39.771 --> 00:25:44.442
willing to look and see
honestly what we need to be

00:25:44.442 --> 00:25:49.748
doing to fulfill the promise
of our founding documents.

00:25:49.748 --> 00:25:54.619
And every country has to
go through that process.

00:25:54.619 --> 00:25:57.589
No country is perfect, but
we have to be honest, and

00:25:57.589 --> 00:26:05.196
strive to expand freedoms,
to broaden democracy.

00:26:05.196 --> 00:26:07.599
The bottom line is that when
citizens cannot exercise

00:26:07.599 --> 00:26:10.602
their rights, the world has
a responsibility to speak out.

00:26:10.602 --> 00:26:14.072
And America will, even if
it's sometimes uncomfortable -

00:26:14.072 --> 00:26:15.707
(applause)

00:26:15.707 --> 00:26:18.877
-- even when it's sometimes
directed toward our friends.

00:26:18.877 --> 00:26:21.046
And I know that there's some
countries that don't say

00:26:21.046 --> 00:26:21.713
anything -

00:26:21.713 --> 00:26:22.981
(laughter)

00:26:22.981 --> 00:26:26.918
-- and maybe that's easier
for leaders to deal with.

00:26:26.918 --> 00:26:28.720
(laughter)

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.523
But you're kind of stuck
with us -- this is how we are.

00:26:31.523 --> 00:26:32.557
(applause)

00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:34.259
We believe in these things
and we're going to keep on

00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:37.262
talking about them.

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:40.165
And I want to repeat, we do
this not because we think

00:26:40.165 --> 00:26:43.134
our democracy is perfect, or
we think that every country

00:26:43.134 --> 00:26:45.537
has to follow
precisely our path.

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:47.539
For more than two centuries
since our independence,

00:26:47.539 --> 00:26:49.541
we're still working on
perfecting our union.

00:26:49.541 --> 00:26:51.543
We're not immune
from criticism.

00:26:51.543 --> 00:26:53.845
When we fall short of our
ideals, we strive to do better.

00:26:53.845 --> 00:26:58.249
(applause)

00:26:58.249 --> 00:27:00.885
But when we speak out for
our principles, at home and

00:27:00.885 --> 00:27:06.291
abroad, we stay true to our
values and we help lift up

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:08.293
the lives of people
beyond our borders.

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:10.028
And we think
that's important.

00:27:10.028 --> 00:27:15.433
And it's especially
important, I believe, for

00:27:15.433 --> 00:27:19.471
those of us of African
descent, because we've known

00:27:19.471 --> 00:27:21.473
what it feels like to be
on the receiving

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:22.774
end of injustice.

00:27:22.774 --> 00:27:25.176
We know what it means to
be discriminated against.

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:26.177
(applause)

00:27:26.177 --> 00:27:28.179
We know what it
means to be jailed.

00:27:31.316 --> 00:27:36.554
So how can we stand by when
it's happening to somebody else?

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:38.957
I'll be frank with you, it
can't just be America that's

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:40.792
talking about these things.

00:27:40.792 --> 00:27:42.961
Fellow African countries
have to talk about these things.

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:47.165
(applause)

00:27:47.165 --> 00:27:50.268
Just as other countries
championed your break from

00:27:50.268 --> 00:27:55.440
colonialism, our nations
must all raise our voices

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.243
when universal rights
are being denied.

00:27:58.243 --> 00:28:01.446
For if we truly believe
that Africans are equal in

00:28:01.446 --> 00:28:05.617
dignity, then Africans have
an equal right to freedoms

00:28:05.617 --> 00:28:07.619
that are universal -- that's
a principle we all

00:28:07.619 --> 00:28:08.653
have to defend.

00:28:08.653 --> 00:28:10.255
(applause)

00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:13.258
And it's not just a Western
idea; it's a human idea.

00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:22.500
I have to also say that
Africa's democratic progress

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:26.504
is also at risk when leaders
refuse to step aside when

00:28:26.504 --> 00:28:27.305
their terms end.

00:28:27.305 --> 00:28:36.948
(applause)

00:28:36.948 --> 00:28:41.886
Now, let me be honest with
you -- I do not understand this.

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:48.226
(laughter)

00:28:48.226 --> 00:28:52.163
I am in my second term.

00:28:52.163 --> 00:28:54.866
It has been an extraordinary
privilege for me to serve as

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:57.102
President of the
United States.

00:28:57.102 --> 00:29:00.605
I cannot imagine a greater
honor or a more interesting job.

00:29:03.208 --> 00:29:05.210
I love my work.

00:29:06.578 --> 00:29:09.013
But under our Constitution,
I cannot run again.

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:11.749
(laughter and applause)

00:29:11.749 --> 00:29:16.554
I can't run again.

00:29:16.554 --> 00:29:18.656
I actually think I'm a
pretty good President -- I

00:29:18.656 --> 00:29:19.691
think if I ran I could win.

00:29:19.691 --> 00:29:21.326
(laughter and applause)

00:29:21.326 --> 00:29:27.198
But I can't.

00:29:27.198 --> 00:29:33.438
So there's a lot that I'd
like to do to keep America

00:29:33.438 --> 00:29:36.241
moving, but the
law is the law.

00:29:36.241 --> 00:29:40.078
(applause)

00:29:40.078 --> 00:29:43.648
And no one person
is above the law.

00:29:43.648 --> 00:29:45.650
Not even the President.

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:52.724
(applause)

00:29:52.724 --> 00:29:54.726
And I'll be honest with you
-- I'm looking forward to

00:29:54.726 --> 00:29:55.493
life after being President.

00:29:55.493 --> 00:29:57.295
(laughter)

00:29:57.295 --> 00:29:59.497
I won't have such a big
security detail all the time.

00:29:59.497 --> 00:30:01.299
(laughter)

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:03.434
It means I can
go take a walk.

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:05.436
I can spend time
with my family.

00:30:05.436 --> 00:30:07.972
I can find other
ways to serve.

00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:09.374
I can visit
Africa more often.

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:16.314
(applause)

00:30:16.314 --> 00:30:18.516
The point is, I don't
understand why people want

00:30:18.516 --> 00:30:20.018
to stay so long.

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:24.489
(laughter)

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:25.857
Especially when they've
got a lot of money.

00:30:25.857 --> 00:30:29.427
(laughter and applause)

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:45.677
When a leader tries to
change the rules in the

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:49.414
middle of the game just to
stay in office, it risks

00:30:49.414 --> 00:30:53.851
instability and strife --
as we've seen in Burundi.

00:30:53.851 --> 00:30:55.587
(applause)

00:30:55.587 --> 00:31:01.226
And this is often just a
first step down a perilous path.

00:31:03.294 --> 00:31:06.030
And sometimes you'll hear
leaders say, well, I'm the

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.599
only person who can hold
this nation together.

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:09.867
(laughter)

00:31:09.867 --> 00:31:12.737
If that's true, then that
leader has failed to truly

00:31:12.737 --> 00:31:13.838
build their nation.

00:31:13.838 --> 00:31:16.307
(applause)

00:31:16.307 --> 00:31:21.079
You look at Nelson Mandela
-- Madiba, like George

00:31:21.079 --> 00:31:24.849
Washington, forged a lasting
legacy not only because of

00:31:24.849 --> 00:31:26.985
what they did in office, but
because they were willing to

00:31:26.985 --> 00:31:29.020
leave office and transfer
power peacefully.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.056
(applause)

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:40.598
And just as the African
Union has condemned coups

00:31:40.598 --> 00:31:44.435
and illegitimate transfers
of power, the AU's authority

00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:46.604
and strong voice can also
help the people of Africa

00:31:46.604 --> 00:31:49.440
ensure that their leaders
abide by term limits and

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.441
their constitutions.

00:31:50.441 --> 00:31:51.442
(applause)

00:31:51.442 --> 00:31:53.444
Nobody should be
president for life.

00:31:53.444 --> 00:31:58.049
And your country is better
off if you have new blood

00:31:58.049 --> 00:31:59.050
and new ideas.

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:00.051
(applause)

00:32:00.051 --> 00:32:02.720
I'm still a pretty young
man, but I know that

00:32:09.994 --> 00:32:13.464
somebody with new energy and
new insights will be good

00:32:13.464 --> 00:32:14.632
for my country.

00:32:14.632 --> 00:32:17.502
(applause)

00:32:17.502 --> 00:32:19.604
It will be good for yours,
too, in some cases.

00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:26.844
Africa's progress will also
depend on security and peace

00:32:26.844 --> 00:32:29.113
-- because an essential part
of human dignity is being

00:32:29.113 --> 00:32:31.115
safe and free from fear.

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:37.755
In Angola, Mozambique,
Liberia, Sierra Leone, we've

00:32:37.755 --> 00:32:42.894
seen conflicts end and
countries work to rebuild.

00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:46.464
But from Somalia and Nigeria
to Mali and Tunisia,

00:32:46.464 --> 00:32:50.335
terrorists continue to
target innocent civilians.

00:32:50.335 --> 00:32:53.771
Many of these groups claim
the banner of religion, but

00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:56.441
hundreds of millions of
African Muslims know that

00:32:56.441 --> 00:32:57.742
Islam means peace.

00:32:57.742 --> 00:32:59.243
(applause)

00:32:59.243 --> 00:33:07.752
And we must call groups like
al Qaeda, ISIL, al-Shabaab,

00:33:07.752 --> 00:33:10.788
Boko Haram -- we must call
them what they are -- murderers.

00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:14.092
(applause)

00:33:17.261 --> 00:33:20.465
In the face of threats,
Africa -- and the African

00:33:20.465 --> 00:33:22.967
Union --has shown
leadership.

00:33:22.967 --> 00:33:25.670
Because of the AU force
in Somalia, al-Shabaab

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.940
controls less territory and
the Somali government is

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.075
growing stronger.

00:33:31.075 --> 00:33:34.212
In central Africa, the
AU-led mission continues to

00:33:34.212 --> 00:33:36.214
degrade the Lord's
Resistance Army.

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:40.852
In the Lake Chad Basin,
forces from several nations

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:43.221
-- with the backing of the
AU -- are fighting to end

00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:46.557
Boko Haram's
senseless brutality.

00:33:46.557 --> 00:33:48.960
And today, we salute all
those who serve to protect

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.496
the innocent, including
so many brave

00:33:51.496 --> 00:33:53.498
African peacekeepers.

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:57.568
Now, as Africa stands
against terror and conflict,

00:33:57.568 --> 00:34:01.072
I want you to know that the
United States stands with you.

00:34:01.072 --> 00:34:03.574
With training and support,
we're helping African forces

00:34:03.574 --> 00:34:04.575
grow stronger.

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:07.512
The United States is
supporting the AU's efforts

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:10.214
to strengthen peacekeeping,
and we're working with

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:13.117
countries in the region to
deal with emerging crises

00:34:13.117 --> 00:34:15.686
with the African Peacekeeping Rapid Response Partnership.

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:20.458
The world must do
more to help as well.

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:22.827
This fall at the United
Nations, I will host a

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:25.563
summit to secure new
commitments to strengthen

00:34:25.563 --> 00:34:28.132
international support for
peacekeeping, including here

00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:29.734
in Africa.

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:33.104
And building on commitments
that originated here in the

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:36.107
AU, we'll work to develop a
new partnership between the

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:39.477
U.N. and the AU that can provide
reliable support for AU

00:34:39.477 --> 00:34:41.879
peace operations.

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:44.615
If African governments and
international partners step

00:34:44.615 --> 00:34:48.386
up with strong support, we
can transform how we work

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:50.488
together to promote security
and peace in Africa.

00:34:53.224 --> 00:34:55.359
Our efforts to ensure our
shared security must be

00:34:55.359 --> 00:34:57.528
matched by a commitment
to improve governance.

00:34:57.528 --> 00:34:59.530
Those things are connected.

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:03.901
Good governance is one of
the best weapons against

00:35:03.901 --> 00:35:06.971
terrorism and instability.

00:35:06.971 --> 00:35:08.973
Our fight against terrorist
groups, for example, will

00:35:08.973 --> 00:35:13.544
never be won if we fail
to address legitimate

00:35:13.544 --> 00:35:16.681
grievances that terrorists
may try to exploit, if we

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:19.484
don't build trust with all
communities, if we don't

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:22.420
uphold the rule of law.

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.422
There's a saying, and I
believe it is true -- if we

00:35:24.422 --> 00:35:26.791
sacrifice liberty in the
name of security, we risk

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:27.625
losing both.

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:34.198
(applause)

00:35:34.198 --> 00:35:38.236
This same seriousness of purpose is needed to end conflicts.

00:35:38.236 --> 00:35:40.338
In the Central African
Republic, the spirit of

00:35:40.338 --> 00:35:42.874
dialogue recently shown by
ordinary citizens must be

00:35:42.874 --> 00:35:46.644
matched by leaders committed
to inclusive elections and a

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:49.213
peaceful transition.

00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:51.215
In Mali, the comprehensive
peace agreement

00:35:51.215 --> 00:35:53.484
must be fulfilled.

00:35:53.484 --> 00:35:55.620
And leaders in Sudan must
know their nation will never

00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:58.422
truly thrive so long as they
wage war against their own

00:35:58.422 --> 00:36:00.591
people -- the world will
not forget about Darfur.

00:36:00.591 --> 00:36:05.363
In South Sudan, the joy of
independence has descended

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:07.398
into the despair
of violence.

00:36:07.398 --> 00:36:12.703
I was there at the United
Nations when we held up

00:36:12.703 --> 00:36:16.841
South Sudan as the promise
of a new beginning.

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:22.713
And neither Mr. Kiir, nor
Mr. Machar have shown, so

00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:25.816
far, any interest in sparing
their people from this

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:29.420
suffering, or reaching
a political solution.

00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:33.090
Yesterday, I met with
leaders from this region.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.427
We agree that, given the
current situation, Mr. Kiir

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:40.031
and Mr. Machar must reach an
agreement by August 17th --

00:36:40.031 --> 00:36:42.033
because if they do not, I
believe the international

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:45.036
community must raise the
costs of intransigence.

00:36:45.036 --> 00:36:48.506
And the world awaits the
report of the AU Commission

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:50.741
of Inquiry, because
accountability for

00:36:50.741 --> 00:36:53.177
atrocities must be part
of any lasting peace in

00:36:53.177 --> 00:36:54.445
Africa's youngest nation.

00:36:54.445 --> 00:36:57.148
(applause)

00:37:00.318 --> 00:37:02.887
And finally, Africa's
progress will depend on

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:05.723
upholding the human rights
of all people -- for if each

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:10.828
of us is to be treated with
dignity, each of us must be

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:15.433
sure to also extend that
same dignity to others.

00:37:18.169 --> 00:37:20.504
As President, I make it a
point to meet with many of

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:21.706
our Young African Leaders.

00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:24.709
And one was a young
man from Senegal.

00:37:24.709 --> 00:37:26.877
He said something wonderful
about being together with so

00:37:26.877 --> 00:37:30.081
many of his African
brothers and sisters.

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:34.752
He said, "Here, I have met
Africa, the [Africa] I've

00:37:34.752 --> 00:37:36.821
always believed in.

00:37:36.821 --> 00:37:38.322
She's beautiful.

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:40.024
She's young.

00:37:40.024 --> 00:37:42.460
She's full of talent and
motivation and ambition."

00:37:44.795 --> 00:37:46.664
I agree.

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:50.301
Africa is the beautiful,
talented daughters who are

00:37:50.301 --> 00:37:52.236
just as capable
as Africa's sons.

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:53.604
(applause)

00:37:53.604 --> 00:37:56.107
And as a father, I believe
that my two daughters have

00:37:56.107 --> 00:38:00.244
to have the same chance
to pursue their dreams as

00:38:00.244 --> 00:38:05.416
anybody's son -- and that
same thing holds true for

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.283
girls here in Africa.

00:38:06.283 --> 00:38:08.219
(applause)

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:11.222
Our girls have to
be treated the same.

00:38:11.222 --> 00:38:13.624
We can't let old traditions
stand in the way.

00:38:16.527 --> 00:38:19.096
The march of history shows
that we have the capacity to

00:38:19.096 --> 00:38:22.299
broaden our moral
imaginations.

00:38:22.299 --> 00:38:25.436
We come to see that some
traditions are good for us,

00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:29.707
they keep us grounded, but
that, in our modern world,

00:38:29.707 --> 00:38:31.709
other traditions
set us back.

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:37.014
When African girls are
subjected to the mutilation

00:38:37.014 --> 00:38:41.819
of their bodies, or forced
into marriage at the ages of

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:47.058
9 or 10 or 11 --
that sets us back.

00:38:47.058 --> 00:38:48.125
That's not a good tradition.

00:38:48.125 --> 00:38:48.793
It needs to end.

00:38:48.793 --> 00:38:55.199
(applause)

00:38:55.199 --> 00:38:58.803
When more than 80 percent
of new HIV cases in the

00:38:58.803 --> 00:39:01.505
hardest-hit countries are
teenage girls, that's a

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:03.507
tragedy; that sets us back.

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:07.812
So America is beginning a
partnership with 10 African

00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:12.750
countries -- Kenya, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mozambique, South

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:17.021
Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania,
Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe

00:39:17.021 --> 00:39:19.223
-- to keep teenage girls
safe and AIDS-free.

00:39:19.223 --> 00:39:20.224
(applause)

00:39:20.224 --> 00:39:23.327
And when girls cannot go
to school and grow up not

00:39:23.327 --> 00:39:29.300
knowing how to read or write
-- that denies the world

00:39:32.103 --> 00:39:36.674
future women engineers,
future women doctors, future

00:39:36.674 --> 00:39:40.644
women business owners,
future women presidents --

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:42.113
that sets us all back.

00:39:42.113 --> 00:39:43.114
(applause)

00:39:43.114 --> 00:39:46.484
That's a bad tradition --
not providing our girls the

00:39:46.484 --> 00:39:49.820
same education as our sons.

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:53.124
I was saying in Kenya,
nobody would put out a

00:39:53.124 --> 00:39:56.861
football team and then
just play half the team.

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:57.461
You'd lose.

00:39:57.461 --> 00:39:58.629
(applause)

00:39:58.629 --> 00:40:06.237
The same is true when it
comes to getting everybody

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:07.238
and education.

00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:13.144
You can't leave half the
team off -- our young women.

00:40:13.144 --> 00:40:15.646
So as part of America's
support for the education

00:40:15.646 --> 00:40:18.582
and the health of our
daughters, my wife,

00:40:18.582 --> 00:40:21.051
Michelle, is helping to lead
a global campaign, including

00:40:21.051 --> 00:40:23.354
a new effort in Tanzania
and Malawi, with a simple

00:40:23.354 --> 00:40:27.491
message -- Let Girls Learn
-- let girls learn so they

00:40:27.491 --> 00:40:29.059
grow up healthy and
they grow up strong.

00:40:29.059 --> 00:40:30.060
(applause)

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:31.762
And that will be
good for families.

00:40:31.762 --> 00:40:34.331
And they will raise smart,
healthy children, and that

00:40:34.331 --> 00:40:36.567
will be good for every
one of your nations.

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:42.006
Africa is the beautiful,
strong women that these

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:45.342
girls grow up to become.

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:47.444
The single best indicator
of whether a nation will

00:40:47.444 --> 00:40:49.113
succeed is how it
treats its women.

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:54.451
(applause)

00:40:54.451 --> 00:40:58.189
When women have health care
and women have education,

00:40:58.189 --> 00:41:00.424
families are stronger,
communities are more

00:41:00.424 --> 00:41:05.329
prosperous, children do
better in school, nations

00:41:05.329 --> 00:41:07.631
are more prosperous.

00:41:07.631 --> 00:41:09.633
Look at the amazing African
women here in this hall.

00:41:09.633 --> 00:41:11.569
(applause)

00:41:11.569 --> 00:41:18.742
If you want your country to
grow and succeed, you have

00:41:18.742 --> 00:41:19.743
to empower your women.

00:41:19.743 --> 00:41:22.513
And if you want to empower
more women, America will be

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:23.013
your partner.

00:41:23.013 --> 00:41:24.114
(applause)

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:29.553
Let's work together to stop
sexual assault and

00:41:29.553 --> 00:41:31.455
domestic violence.

00:41:31.455 --> 00:41:34.625
Let's make clear that we
will not tolerate rape as a

00:41:34.625 --> 00:41:36.093
weapon of war
-- it's a crime.

00:41:36.093 --> 00:41:37.428
(applause)

00:41:37.428 --> 00:41:41.165
And those who commit
it must be punished.

00:41:41.165 --> 00:41:43.167
Let's lift up the next
generation of women leaders

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:46.403
who can help fight injustice
and forge peace and start

00:41:46.403 --> 00:41:49.940
new businesses and create
jobs -- and some might hire

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:50.507
some men, too.

00:41:50.507 --> 00:41:56.347
(laughter)

00:41:56.347 --> 00:42:03.854
We'll all be better off when
women have equal futures.

00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:06.123
And Africa is the beautiful
tapestry of your cultures

00:42:06.123 --> 00:42:08.592
and ethnicities and
races and religions.

00:42:08.592 --> 00:42:14.131
Last night, we saw this
amazing dance troupe made up

00:42:14.131 --> 00:42:19.970
of street children who had
formed a dance troupe and

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.773
they performed for the
Prime Minister and myself.

00:42:22.773 --> 00:42:27.111
And there were 80 different
languages and I don't know

00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.112
how many ethnic groups.

00:42:28.112 --> 00:42:31.215
And there were like 30
different dances that were

00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:32.216
being done.

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:34.218
And the Prime Minister was
trying to keep up with --

00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:34.852
okay, I think that one is --

00:42:34.852 --> 00:42:37.021
(laughter)

00:42:37.021 --> 00:42:43.327
-- and they were moving fast.

00:42:43.327 --> 00:42:46.130
And that diversity here in
Ethiopia is representative

00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:48.165
of diversity all
throughout Africa.

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:51.335
(applause)

00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:53.504
And that's a strength.

00:42:53.504 --> 00:42:56.674
Now, yesterday, I had the
privilege to view Lucy --

00:42:56.674 --> 00:42:58.809
you may know Lucy -- she's
our ancestor, more than 3

00:42:58.809 --> 00:42:59.343
million years old.

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:05.182
(applause)

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:09.053
In this tree of humanity,
with all of our branches and

00:43:09.053 --> 00:43:13.691
diversity, we all go
back to the same root.

00:43:13.691 --> 00:43:17.394
We're all one family --
we're all one tribe.

00:43:20.497 --> 00:43:23.667
And yet so much of the
suffering in our world stems

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:27.538
from our failure to remember
that -- to not recognize

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:28.472
ourselves in each other.

00:43:28.472 --> 00:43:31.342
(applause)

00:43:31.342 --> 00:43:35.579
We think because somebody's
skin is slightly different,

00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:39.483
or their hair is slightly
different, or their

00:43:39.483 --> 00:43:43.287
religious faith is
differently expressed, or

00:43:43.287 --> 00:43:46.523
they speak a different
language that it justifies

00:43:46.523 --> 00:43:48.792
somehow us treating
them with less dignity.

00:43:50.894 --> 00:43:54.164
And that becomes the source
of so many of our problems.

00:43:54.164 --> 00:43:56.233
And we think somehow that
we make ourselves better by

00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:58.669
putting other people down.

00:43:58.669 --> 00:44:02.272
And that becomes the source
of so many of our problems.

00:44:02.272 --> 00:44:05.876
When we begin to see other
as somehow less than

00:44:05.876 --> 00:44:09.713
ourselves -- when we
succumb to these artificial

00:44:09.713 --> 00:44:14.051
divisions of faith or sect
or tribe or ethnicity --

00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:18.956
then even the most awful
abuses are justified in the

00:44:18.956 --> 00:44:23.394
minds of those who are
thinking in those ways.

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:26.663
And in the end, abusers lose
their own humanity, as well.

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:33.237
(applause)

00:44:33.237 --> 00:44:36.440
Nelson Mandela taught us,
"to be free is not merely to

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.576
cast off one's chains,
but to live in a way that

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:42.913
respects and enhances
the freedom of others."

00:44:42.913 --> 00:44:44.381
Every one of us is equal.

00:44:44.381 --> 00:44:45.616
Every one of us has worth.

00:44:45.616 --> 00:44:47.084
Every one of us matters.

00:44:47.084 --> 00:44:49.720
And when we respect the
freedom of others -- no

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.322
matter the color of their
skin, or how they pray or

00:44:52.322 --> 00:44:55.059
who they are or who they
love -- we are all more free.

00:44:55.059 --> 00:44:56.293
(applause)

00:44:56.293 --> 00:45:02.966
Your dignity depends on my
dignity, and my dignity

00:45:02.966 --> 00:45:08.172
depends on yours.

00:45:08.172 --> 00:45:10.941
Imagine if everyone had that
spirit in their hearts.

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:12.509
Imagine if governments
operated that way.

00:45:12.509 --> 00:45:18.115
(applause)

00:45:18.115 --> 00:45:20.617
Just imagine what the world
could look like -- the

00:45:20.617 --> 00:45:22.619
future that we could
bequeath these young people.

00:45:26.323 --> 00:45:28.325
Yes, in our world, old
thinking can be a

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:29.326
stubborn thing.

00:45:29.326 --> 00:45:31.995
That's one of the reasons
why we need term limits --

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:34.832
old people think old ways.

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:36.567
And you can see my grey
hair, I'm getting old.

00:45:36.567 --> 00:45:38.435
(laughter)

00:45:40.620 --> 00:45:43.000
The old ways
can be stubborn.

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:45.442
But I believe the human
heart is stronger.

00:45:45.442 --> 00:45:46.977
I believe hearts can change.

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:50.047
I believe minds can open.

00:45:50.047 --> 00:45:51.048
That's how change happens.

00:45:51.048 --> 00:45:54.084
That's how societies
move forward.

00:45:54.084 --> 00:45:58.689
It's not always a straight
line -- step by halting step

00:45:58.689 --> 00:46:01.525
-- sometimes you go forward,
you move back a little bit.

00:46:01.525 --> 00:46:05.095
But I believe we are
marching, we are pointing

00:46:05.095 --> 00:46:08.699
towards ideals of
justice and equality.

00:46:08.699 --> 00:46:13.137
That's how your nations won
independence -- not just

00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:15.339
with rifles, but with
principles and ideals.

00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:16.540
(applause)

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.543
That's how African Americans
won our civil rights.

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:21.645
That's how South Africans --
black and white --

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:23.647
tore down apartheid.

00:46:24.781 --> 00:46:26.783
That's why I can stand
before you today as the

00:46:26.783 --> 00:46:28.685
first African American
President of the United States.

00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:31.455
(applause)

00:46:36.026 --> 00:46:37.461
New thinking.

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:40.364
Unleashing growth that
creates opportunity.

00:46:40.364 --> 00:46:43.901
Promoting development that
lifts all people out of poverty.

00:46:43.901 --> 00:46:47.704
Supporting democracy that
gives citizens their say.

00:46:47.704 --> 00:46:51.508
Advancing the security and
justice that delivers peace.

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:55.746
Respecting the human
rights of all people.

00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:58.215
These are the keys to
progress -- not just in

00:46:58.215 --> 00:47:00.584
Africa, but
around the world.

00:47:00.584 --> 00:47:03.954
And this is the work
that we can do together.

00:47:03.954 --> 00:47:05.989
And I am hopeful.

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:08.992
As I prepare to return home,
my thoughts are with that

00:47:08.992 --> 00:47:11.895
same young man from Senegal,
who said: Here, I have met

00:47:11.895 --> 00:47:14.198
Africa, the [Africa]
I've always believed in.

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:16.833
She's beautiful and
young, full of talent and

00:47:16.833 --> 00:47:18.835
motivation and ambition.

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:22.706
To which I would simply add,
as you build the Africa you

00:47:22.706 --> 00:47:25.976
believe in, you will have no
better partner, no better

00:47:25.976 --> 00:47:28.111
friend than the United
States of America.

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.146
(applause)

00:47:29.146 --> 00:47:30.981
God bless Africa.

00:47:30.981 --> 00:47:32.416
God bless the United
States of America.

00:47:32.416 --> 00:47:33.116
Thank you very
much, everybody.

00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:34.551
Thank you.

00:47:34.551 --> 00:47:35.986
(applause)
