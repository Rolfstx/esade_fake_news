I'M GOING TO HELL BECAUSE I
DON'T BELIEVE IN HIM.

00:01:14.174 --> 00:01:16.976
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I AM GOING TO HELL
BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE IN IT.

00:01:16.976 --> 00:01:21.714
JUST BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE IN HELL
DOESN'T MEAN YOU WON'T GO, YOU

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.150 align:start size:88% position:13%
PROBABLY WILL BECAUSE I'M A

SO WHAT-- WELL, I GOT NO
GUARANTEE I'M GOING TO HEAVEN.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.834
ONLY ONE PERSON IS GUARANTEED
ENTRANCE INTO HEAVEN.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:41.201 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; WHO IS THAT.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:44.637

WAS HANGING NEXT TO KLEIST WHO

00:01:44.637 --> 00:01:47.707
SAID THIS VERY DAY SHALL YOU BE
WITH ME IN PARADISE.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.944
THAT IS WHAT HE SAID, KLEIST,
BOOM, TBAIF HIM A STAMP,

VALIDATED HIS PARKING RIGHT

&gt;&gt; BUT WASN'T KLEIST GOD IN A
DIFFERENT FORM.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:59.152
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BOTH GOD AND MAN,
YEAH.

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:03.790
&gt;&gt; BUT HE, GOD WAS JESUS, WASN'T
HE.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.892 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THREE PERSONS IN
ONE GOD, YEAH.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:06.159 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; RIGHT.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:07.961 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THE BED ROCK OF
WESTERN CIVILIZATION.

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:13.433 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; SO HE-- SO HE KNEW HE WAS
SENDING HIMSELF TO EARTH TO DIE

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.702 align:start size:88% position:13%
FOR OUR SINS AND THEN GO TO
HEAVEN.

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:19.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, BECAUSE HE
SEES ALL TIME AT ONCE.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:24.177
&gt;&gt; SOUNDS A BIT FAR FETCHED TO
ME.

00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:24.477 align:start size:88% position:13%
(LAUGHTER).

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.745 align:start size:88% position:13%

&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S RIGHT.

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:50.003 align:start size:88% position:13%
THAT'S WHY MY GOD IS GREATER
THAN EVERY OTHER GOD.

&gt;&gt; Stephen: PART OF THE WORLD,

WHY WOULD I DO THAT.

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:44.924

THE DAYS OFF IN BETWEEN, YEAH.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:07.213 align:end position:100%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU HAVEN'T DONE
THE STANDUP TOUR IN SEVEN YEARS,

00:04:07.213 --> 00:04:08.248 size:88% position:44%
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:04:08.248 --> 00:04:11.517
&gt;&gt; SEVEN YEARS IF YOU DON'T
COUNT THE GOLDEN GLOBES, WHICH

00:04:11.517 --> 00:04:11.851 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU SHOULDN'T.

00:04:11.851 --> 00:04:14.153 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I DO HAVE
QUESTIONS ABOUT THAT IN A

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:16.155
MINUTE, WE'LL GET BACK TO THAT.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:16.489 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; OKAY, SURE.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.059
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO WHY GO BACK TO
IT AFTER SEVEN YEARS IN.

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:22.228
&gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT, I ALWAYS
THOUGHT STANDUP WAS THE FIRST

00:04:22.228 --> 00:04:25.598 align:start size:88% position:13%
THING I DID, AS A WRITER,
DIRECTOR OR ACTOR.

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.133
AND IT ALWAYS GOT PUSHED BACK.

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:28.134
I'VE GOT MORE IMPORTANT THINGS.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:30.470 align:end position:100%
BUT NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME I
THINK IT IS THE FAVORITE THING I

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.670 align:start size:88% position:13%
DO.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.840 size:88% position:56%
IT IS SUCH A PRIVILEGE THAT
PEOPLE ARE COMING OUT TO SEE

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.007 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU.

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:40.079
YOU CAN SAY ANYTHING YOU WANT.

00:04:40.079 --> 00:04:41.247
THERE ARE NO RESTRICTIONS, IT'S
JUST YOUR OWN MORALITY AND

00:04:41.247 --> 00:04:42.515
10,000 STRARYNGS IT IS A REAL
PRIVILEGE.

00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:44.484
AND I THINK I'M FINALLY A GOODS
STANDUP.

00:04:44.484 --> 00:04:46.352
AND THAT SOUNDS WEIRD AND
EVERYBODY THAT CAME TO SEE ME

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.988
BEFORE THERE, YOU'RE NOT GETTING
YOUR MONEY BACK.

00:04:48.988 --> 00:04:52.225
BUT I'M SAYING NOW, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK IT IS, I THINK IT

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:55.995
IS SEVEN YEARS OFF, AND I SORT
OF MISS IT.

00:04:55.995 --> 00:05:00.233

AND I'M NOT A MANIAC.

00:05:04.804 --> 00:05:06.773
I DON'T GO OUT TO OFFEND, THAT'S
TOO EASY.

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:10.243
BUT YOU JUST, IT JUST HAPPENS.

00:05:10.243 --> 00:05:12.245

THAT OFFENDS YOU?

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.880
&gt;&gt; EVERYTHING OFFENDS ME.

&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT'S FANTASY, WHAT
DID YOU MEAN, WHAT'S WRONG WITH

IT'S NOT WINE ANY MORE.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.180
&gt;&gt; IT'S NOT WINE ANY MORE.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:17.356
I'M ABSOLUTELY OFF MY [BLEEP] ON
THE BLOOD OF CHRIST.

00:09:17.356 --> 00:09:21.060 align:start size:88% position:13%
(LAUGHTER)
(APPLAUSE).

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:24.430

YOU HAVE DONE A GREAT JOB.

00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:37.176 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'M HOSTING THE EMMYS IN THE
FALL.

00:09:37.176 --> 00:09:40.012 align:start size:88% position:13%
YOU CAN GIVE ME ANY ADVICE--
(APPLAUSE)

00:09:40.012 --> 00:09:44.617
OTHER THAN, LIKE OTHER THAN LIKE
PISSING OFF EARN IN THE ROOM OR

00:09:44.617 --> 00:09:46.919
SHOULD DO YOU THAT, IS IT A GOOD
THING TO DO?

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:51.924
&gt;&gt; I DON'T TRY TO, BUT AGAIN, I
THINK WHEN YOU DO THOSE THINGS,

00:09:51.924 --> 00:09:54.393
WITH THE GOLDEN GLOBES I HAVE A
CHOICE AS A COMEDIAN, DO I

00:09:54.393 --> 00:09:57.630
PANDER TO 200 PEOPLE IN THE ROOM
OR THE 200 MILLION PEOPLE

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.931
WATCHING AROUND THE WORLD.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:09:59.899 align:start size:88% position:13%
AND THERE IS NO CONTEST, YOU
KNOW.

00:09:59.899 --> 00:10:01.934
I PLAY IT FOR THE AUDIENCE AT
HOME.

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.636 align:start size:88% position:13%
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT WINNING
AWARDS.

00:10:03.636 --> 00:10:06.305
I'M THE FAT GUY AT HOME ON THE
COUCH, DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

00:10:06.305 --> 00:10:09.175
SO I SORT OF-- I DON'T-- I'M NOT
THAT NASTY.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:13.245
BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE EMMY
VOTE IS THEN BECAUSE I'M UP FOR

00:10:13.245 --> 00:10:19.885
EMMY CONSIDERATION FOR-- LIFE ON
THE ROAD, BEST TV MOVIE AND BEST

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:20.186 align:start size:88% position:13%
TELEVISION.

00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:25.458 size:88% position:56%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ARE YOU A VOTER.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:26.292
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK THEY ASKED ME
TO VOTE.

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.126
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HAVE YOU EVER WON
AN EMMY.

00:10:27.126 --> 00:10:27.393 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:10:27.393 --> 00:10:28.427

AUTOMATICALLY IN TO VOTE.

00:10:28.427 --> 00:10:29.095
&gt;&gt; I HAVE WON TWO BUT I LOST 21.

00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:29.895 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OH, WOW.

&gt;&gt; THAT'S TERRIBLE-- .

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:31.797 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT IS PRETTY
BAD.

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:34.133
&gt;&gt; THAT IS A TERRIBLE BATTING
AVERAGE.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.501
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, WOW.

00:10:35.501 --> 00:10:37.436
I THOUGHT WERE YOU TALENTED, I
DIDN'T KNOW.

00:10:37.436 --> 00:10:40.640
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW, I THINK
IT'S A BIG JOKE.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.945
THEY'RE LIKE COME TO L.A. YOU
ARE GOING TO WIN, AM I?

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:46.112 align:start size:88% position:13%
NOU.

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:49.181
&gt;&gt; Stephen: LOUIS C.K.

00:10:49.181 --> 00:10:49.982 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; I THINK FUN-- .

00:10:49.982 --> 00:10:52.118 align:start size:88% position:13%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU CAN DRINK AT
THE GOLDEN GLOBES.

00:10:52.118 --> 00:10:53.352 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; THAT'S THE THING.

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:56.255
THE GOLDEN GLOBES IS PROBABLY
BETTER TO BE AT THAN HOST THAT

00:10:56.255 --> 00:10:58.024
BECAUSE YOU ARE GETTING DRUNK
AND YOU DON'T CARE.

00:10:58.024 --> 00:11:02.795
WHEREAS THE EMMYS THEY ARE ALL
SITTING THERE AND BUT THEY ARE

00:11:02.795 --> 00:11:06.132
SOBER SO IT IS GOOD TO PERFORM
AT BUT-- WHEN I'M UP FOR EMMYS

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:08.034
WHICH IS EVERY YEAR, I DON'T WIN
THEM.

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:10.102
BUT THEY SAY DO YOU WANT TO HAND
ONE OUT.

00:11:10.102 --> 00:11:12.838
AND I ALWAYS SAY YES BECAUSE I
KNOW THERE WILL BE A BREAK AND I

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.207
WILL GET BACKSTAGE AND HAVE A
BEER.

00:11:15.207 --> 00:11:16.642
BECAUSE IT IS THREE HOURS
WITHOUT A BEEF WATCHING IT.

00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:20.713
SO BASICALLY, BLOOD OF CHRIST,
THAT'S ALL I SAY-- SAY,.
