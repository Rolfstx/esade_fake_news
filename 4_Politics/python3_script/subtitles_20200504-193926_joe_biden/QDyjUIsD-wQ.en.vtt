00:00:01.468 --> 00:00:02.402
The President:
Hello, Chicago!

00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:07.807
(Applause.)

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.442
It's good to be home!

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.711
(Applause.)

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:14.848
Thank you, everybody.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:17.784
Thank you.

00:00:17.784 --> 00:00:19.886
(Applause.)

00:00:19.886 --> 00:00:30.964
Thank you so much.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:31.798
Thank you.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:39.105
(Applause.)

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:55.522
All right, everybody sit down.

00:00:55.522 --> 00:00:58.258
(Applause.)

00:00:58.258 --> 00:00:59.192
We're on live TV here.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:01:01.761
I've got to move.

00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:10.470
(Applause.)

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:30.490
You can tell that I'm a lame duck

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.225
because nobody is
following instructions.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:33.393
(Laughter.)

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:35.061
Everybody have a seat.

00:01:35.061 --> 00:01:43.169
(Applause.)

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:45.004
My fellow Americans --

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:54.781
(applause)

00:01:54.781 --> 00:02:00.119
-- Michelle and I have been
so touched by all the well

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.190
wishes that we've received
over the past few weeks.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.761
But tonight, it's my
turn to say thanks.

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:11.364
(Applause.)

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:14.701
Whether we have seen eye-to-eye or

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:20.640
rarely agreed at all, my
conversations with you,

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.776
the American people,
in living rooms and in

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:31.317
schools, at farms, on
factory floors, at diners

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:35.288
and on distant military
outposts -- those

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:39.359
conversations are what
have kept me honest, and

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:44.197
kept me inspired,
and kept me going.

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:47.534
And every day, I have
learned from you.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:50.069
You made me a better
President, and you made me

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.771
a better man.

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.173
(Applause.)

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:56.175
So I first
came to Chicago when I was

00:02:56.175 --> 00:02:58.645
in my early 20s.

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:02.549
And I was still trying
to figure out who I was,

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.585
still searching for a
purpose in my life.

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:10.023
And it was a neighborhood
not far from here where I

00:03:10.023 --> 00:03:12.692
began working with church
groups in the shadows of

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:16.629
closed steel mills.

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.632
It was on these streets
where I witnessed the

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:23.336
power of faith, and the
quiet dignity of working

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:26.339
people in the face of
struggle and loss.

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.240
Audience: Four more years!

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.608
Four more years!

00:03:28.608 --> 00:03:31.644
Four more years!

00:03:31.644 --> 00:03:32.745
The President:
I can't do that.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:33.813
Audience: Four more years!

00:03:33.813 --> 00:03:34.981
Four more years!

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:46.192
Four more years!

00:03:46.192 --> 00:03:48.328
The President: This is
where I learned that

00:03:48.328 --> 00:03:51.764
change only happens when
ordinary people get

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.901
involved and they get
engaged, and they come

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:59.706
together to demand it.

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:00.907
After eight years as your

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:04.444
President, I still believe that.

00:04:04.444 --> 00:04:07.580
And it's not
just my belief.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.285
It's the beating heart of
our American idea -- our

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:16.823
bold experiment in
self-government.

00:04:16.823 --> 00:04:21.260
It's the conviction that
we are all created equal,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.731
endowed by our Creator
with certain unalienable

00:04:24.731 --> 00:04:28.935
rights, among them life,
liberty, and the

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.971
pursuit of happiness.

00:04:31.971 --> 00:04:35.074
It's the insistence that
these rights, while

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:40.279
self-evident, have never
been self-executing; that

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:45.018
We, the People, through
the instrument of our

00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:51.891
democracy, can form
a more perfect union.

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:55.795
What a radical idea.

00:04:55.795 --> 00:05:01.234
A great gift that our
Founders gave to us: The

00:05:01.234 --> 00:05:03.970
freedom to chase our
individual dreams through

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:09.275
our sweat and toil and
imagination, and the

00:05:09.275 --> 00:05:13.246
imperative to strive
together, as well, to

00:05:13.246 --> 00:05:18.284
achieve a common
good, a greater good.

00:05:18.284 --> 00:05:22.622
For 240 years, our
nation's call to

00:05:22.622 --> 00:05:26.826
citizenship has given work
and purpose to

00:05:26.826 --> 00:05:29.028
each new generation.

00:05:29.028 --> 00:05:30.663
It's what led patriots
to choose republic over

00:05:30.663 --> 00:05:37.303
tyranny, pioneers to trek
west, slaves to brave that

00:05:37.303 --> 00:05:41.541
makeshift railroad
to freedom.

00:05:41.541 --> 00:05:43.342
It's what pulled
immigrants and refugees

00:05:43.342 --> 00:05:46.446
across oceans and
the Rio Grande.

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:47.280
(Applause.)

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.449
It's what pushed women to reach

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.384
for the ballot.

00:05:51.384 --> 00:05:58.057
It's what powered
workers to organize.

00:05:58.057 --> 00:06:02.962
It's why GIs gave their
lives at Omaha Beach and

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:09.335
Iwo Jima, Iraq
and Afghanistan.

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:13.172
And why men and women from
Selma to Stonewall were

00:06:13.172 --> 00:06:15.508
prepared to give
theirs, as well.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:20.346
(Applause.)

00:06:20.346 --> 00:06:25.952
So that's what we mean when we say

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:29.088
America is exceptional --
not that our nation has

00:06:29.088 --> 00:06:32.158
been flawless from the
start, but that we have

00:06:32.158 --> 00:06:35.461
shown the capacity to
change and make life

00:06:35.461 --> 00:06:41.400
better for those
who follow.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.372
Yes, our progress
has been uneven.

00:06:46.372 --> 00:06:49.142
The work of democracy
has always been hard.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:51.878
It's always been
contentious.

00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:55.515
Sometimes it's
been bloody.

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:59.352
For every two steps
forward, it often feels we

00:06:59.352 --> 00:07:03.322
take one step back.

00:07:03.322 --> 00:07:07.126
But the long sweep of
America has been defined

00:07:07.126 --> 00:07:10.963
by forward motion, a
constant widening of our

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:16.636
founding creed to embrace
all and not just some.

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:30.316
(Applause.)

00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:35.021
If I had told you eight years ago that

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:37.089
America would reverse a
great recession, reboot

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:41.227
our auto industry, and
unleash the longest

00:07:41.227 --> 00:07:43.362
stretch of job creation in
our history --

00:07:43.362 --> 00:07:48.768
(applause)

00:07:48.768 --> 00:07:51.904
-- if I had told you that
we would open up a new

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:54.807
chapter with the Cuban
people, shut down Iran's

00:07:54.807 --> 00:07:58.878
nuclear weapons program
without firing a shot,

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:01.781
take out the mastermind of
9/11 --

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:05.318
(applause)

00:08:05.318 --> 00:08:06.552
-- if I had told you that we

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:11.090
would win marriage equality, and secure the right to

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:13.326
health insurance for another 20

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.862
million of our fellow
citizens --

00:08:15.862 --> 00:08:23.903
(applause)

00:08:23.903 --> 00:08:27.607
-- if I had told you all
that, you might have said

00:08:27.607 --> 00:08:33.079
our sights were set
a little too high.

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:34.747
But that's what we did.

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:39.085
(Applause.)

00:08:39.085 --> 00:08:42.521
That's what you did.

00:08:42.521 --> 00:08:46.225
You were the change.

00:08:46.225 --> 00:08:49.862
You answered people's
hopes, and because of you,

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:54.066
by almost every measure,
America is a better,

00:08:54.066 --> 00:08:56.769
stronger place than it
was when we started.

00:08:56.769 --> 00:09:09.715
(Applause.)

00:09:09.715 --> 00:09:13.286
In 10 days, the world will witness a

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:15.154
hallmark of our democracy.

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:16.455
Audience: Nooo --

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:19.091
The President: No, no, no, no,

00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:24.397
no -- the peaceful
transfer of power from one

00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:26.332
freely elected
President to the next.

00:09:26.332 --> 00:09:32.705
(Applause.)

00:09:32.705 --> 00:09:34.974
I committed to President-elect Trump that

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:36.976
my administration would
ensure the smoothest

00:09:36.976 --> 00:09:39.612
possible transition, just
as President

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:41.914
Bush did for me.

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:45.351
(Applause.)

00:09:45.351 --> 00:09:49.255
Because it's up to all of us to

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:53.292
make sure our government can
help us meet the many

00:09:53.292 --> 00:09:58.397
challenges we still face.

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:00.666
We have what we
need to do so.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:03.169
We have everything we need
to meet those challenges.

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:07.673
After all, we remain the
wealthiest, most powerful,

00:10:07.673 --> 00:10:11.877
and most respected
nation on Earth.

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:16.048
Our youth, our drive, our
diversity and openness,

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:20.920
our boundless capacity for
risk and reinvention means

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:26.492
that the future
should be ours.

00:10:26.492 --> 00:10:31.297
But that potential will
only be realized if

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:34.667
our democracy works.

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:37.336
Only if our politics
better reflects the

00:10:37.336 --> 00:10:39.772
decency of our people.

00:10:39.772 --> 00:10:43.376
(Applause.)

00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:46.746
Only if all of us, regardless of

00:10:46.746 --> 00:10:51.817
party affiliation or particular
interests, help restore

00:10:51.817 --> 00:10:55.755
the sense of common
purpose that we so badly

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:58.257
need right now.

00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:01.694
That's what I want to
focus on tonight: The

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:05.031
state of our democracy.

00:11:05.031 --> 00:11:13.739
Understand, democracy does
not require uniformity.

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.341
Our founders argued.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.009
They quarreled.

00:11:17.009 --> 00:11:19.912
Eventually they
compromised.

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:23.516
They expected us
to do the same.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:30.156
But they knew that
democracy does require a

00:11:30.156 --> 00:11:36.629
basic sense of solidarity
-- the idea that for all

00:11:36.629 --> 00:11:41.067
our outward differences,
we're all in this

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:43.803
together; that we
rise or fall as one.

00:11:43.803 --> 00:11:51.677
(Applause.)

00:11:51.677 --> 00:11:53.045
There have been moments throughout

00:11:53.045 --> 00:12:01.487
our history that threatens
that solidarity.

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:02.855
And the beginning of this
century has been one

00:12:02.855 --> 00:12:06.392
of those times.

00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:11.130
A shrinking world, growing
inequality; demographic

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.300
change and the specter of
terrorism -- these forces

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.236
haven't just tested
our security and our

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:20.239
prosperity, but are
testing our democracy,

00:12:20.239 --> 00:12:22.541
as well.

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:24.677
And how we meet these
challenges to our

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:29.115
democracy will determine
our ability to educate our

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.717
kids, and create good
jobs, and protect

00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:33.986
our homeland.

00:12:33.986 --> 00:12:40.960
In other words, it will
determine our future.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.595
To begin with, our
democracy won't work

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.396
without a sense that
everyone has

00:12:44.396 --> 00:12:48.234
economic opportunity.

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:50.236
And the good news is that
today the economy

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:52.505
is growing again.

00:12:52.505 --> 00:12:55.307
Wages, incomes, home
values, and retirement

00:12:55.307 --> 00:12:58.444
accounts are all
rising again.

00:12:58.444 --> 00:12:58.978
Poverty is falling again.

00:12:58.978 --> 00:13:06.152
(Applause.)

00:13:06.152 --> 00:13:08.087
The wealthy are paying a fairer share

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:10.489
of taxes even as the stock
market shatters records.

00:13:10.489 --> 00:13:16.228
The unemployment rate
is near a 10-year low.

00:13:16.228 --> 00:13:18.397
The uninsured rate has
never, ever been lower.

00:13:18.397 --> 00:13:26.739
(Applause.)

00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:31.310
Health care costs are rising at

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:33.078
the slowest rate in 50 years.

00:13:33.078 --> 00:13:35.614
And I've said and I mean
it -- if anyone can put

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:39.118
together a plan that is
demonstrably better than

00:13:39.118 --> 00:13:40.686
the improvements we've
made to our health care

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:43.856
system and that covers as
many people at less cost,

00:13:43.856 --> 00:13:45.558
I will publicly
support it.

00:13:45.558 --> 00:13:55.501
(Applause.)

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:59.305
Because that, after all, is

00:13:59.305 --> 00:14:03.542
why we serve.

00:14:03.542 --> 00:14:06.879
Not to score points or
take credit, but to make

00:14:06.879 --> 00:14:08.280
people's lives better.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:12.618
(Applause.)

00:14:12.618 --> 00:14:15.588
But for all the real progress

00:14:15.588 --> 00:14:21.794
that we've made, we know
it's not enough.

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:25.397
Our economy doesn't work
as well or grow as fast

00:14:25.397 --> 00:14:27.333
when a few prosper at
the expense of a growing

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:29.835
middle class and ladders
for folks who want to get

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:31.370
into the middle class.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:33.572
(Applause.)

00:14:33.572 --> 00:14:35.040
That's the economic argument.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.377
But stark inequality is
also corrosive to our

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:42.715
democratic ideal.

00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:44.950
While the top one percent
has amassed a bigger share

00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:49.588
of wealth and income, too
many families, in inner

00:14:49.588 --> 00:14:52.958
cities and in rural
counties, have been left

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:57.529
behind -- the laid-off
factory worker; the

00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:59.932
waitress or health care
worker who's just barely

00:14:59.932 --> 00:15:03.202
getting by and struggling
to pay the bills --

00:15:03.202 --> 00:15:05.971
convinced that the game is
fixed against them, that

00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:07.673
their government only
serves the interests of

00:15:07.673 --> 00:15:11.744
the powerful -- that's a
recipe for more cynicism

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:16.782
and polarization
in our politics.

00:15:16.782 --> 00:15:17.783
But there are no quick

00:15:17.783 --> 00:15:20.586
fixes to this long-term trend.

00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:24.723
I agree, our trade should
be fair and not just free.

00:15:24.723 --> 00:15:26.592
But the next wave of
economic dislocations

00:15:26.592 --> 00:15:29.595
won't come from overseas.

00:15:29.595 --> 00:15:31.196
It will come from the
relentless pace of

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:33.565
automation that makes a
lot of good, middle-class

00:15:33.565 --> 00:15:37.503
jobs obsolete.

00:15:37.503 --> 00:15:38.904
And so we're going to have
to forge a new social

00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:42.908
compact to guarantee all
our kids the education

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.410
they need --

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.110
(applause)

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:48.580
-- to give workers the power to unionize for better

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:51.517
wages; to update the

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:54.420
social safety net to
reflect the way we live

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.690
now, and make more reforms
to the tax code so

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.326
corporations and
individuals who reap the

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:03.696
most from this new
economy don't avoid their

00:16:03.696 --> 00:16:05.631
obligations to the country
that's made their

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.099
very success possible.

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:15.941
(Applause.)

00:16:15.941 --> 00:16:17.910
We can argue about how to best

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:21.313
achieve these goals.

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:23.782
But we can't be complacent
about the

00:16:23.782 --> 00:16:27.119
goals themselves.

00:16:27.119 --> 00:16:29.121
For if we don't create
opportunity for all

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:34.526
people, the disaffection
and division that has

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:37.429
stalled our progress will
only sharpen in

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:42.668
years to come.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.837
There's a second threat to
our democracy -- and this

00:16:44.837 --> 00:16:49.441
one is as old as
our nation itself.

00:16:49.441 --> 00:16:51.510
After my election, there
was talk of a

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.114
post-racial America.

00:16:55.114 --> 00:16:59.785
And such a vision, however
well-intended, was

00:16:59.785 --> 00:17:02.888
never realistic.

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:07.159
Race remains a potent and
often divisive force

00:17:07.159 --> 00:17:10.362
in our society.

00:17:10.362 --> 00:17:13.298
Now, I've lived long
enough to know that race

00:17:13.298 --> 00:17:16.702
relations are better than
they were 10, or 20, or 30

00:17:16.702 --> 00:17:18.837
years ago, no matter
what some folks say.

00:17:18.837 --> 00:17:20.739
(Applause.)

00:17:20.739 --> 00:17:25.811
You can see it not just in statistics,

00:17:25.811 --> 00:17:27.045
you see it in the
attitudes of young

00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:31.950
Americans across the
political spectrum.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:35.087
But we're not where
we need to be.

00:17:35.087 --> 00:17:36.655
And all of us have
more work to do.

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:40.225
(Applause.)

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:43.095
If every economic issue is

00:17:43.095 --> 00:17:46.698
framed as a struggle between a
hardworking white middle

00:17:46.698 --> 00:17:54.373
class and an undeserving
minority, then workers of

00:17:54.373 --> 00:17:56.975
all shades are going to be
left fighting for scraps

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:59.044
while the wealthy withdraw
further into their

00:17:59.044 --> 00:18:00.112
private enclaves.

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:13.192
(Applause.)

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:14.092
If we're unwilling to invest in

00:18:14.092 --> 00:18:16.295
the children of immigrants,
just because they don't

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:20.699
look like us, we will
diminish the prospects of

00:18:20.699 --> 00:18:22.768
our own children --
because those brown kids

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:25.637
will represent a larger
and larger share of

00:18:25.637 --> 00:18:26.805
America's workforce.

00:18:26.805 --> 00:18:38.951
(Applause.)

00:18:38.951 --> 00:18:41.553
And we have shown that our

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:45.591
economy doesn't have to be
a zero-sum game.

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:49.428
Last year, incomes rose
for all races, all age

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:56.235
groups, for men
and for women.

00:18:56.235 --> 00:18:58.036
So if we're going to be
serious about race going

00:18:58.036 --> 00:19:01.507
forward, we need to
uphold laws against

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:04.910
discrimination -- in
hiring, and in housing,

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:06.411
and in education, and
in the criminal

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:07.980
justice system.

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.780
(Applause.)

00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.782
That is what our Constitution and our

00:19:10.782 --> 00:19:12.451
highest ideals require.

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:17.956
(Applause.)

00:19:17.956 --> 00:19:21.326
But laws alone won't be enough.

00:19:21.326 --> 00:19:24.429
Hearts must change.

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:26.131
It won't change overnight.

00:19:26.131 --> 00:19:29.167
Social attitudes
oftentimes take

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:30.702
generations to change.

00:19:30.702 --> 00:19:36.275
But if our democracy is to
work in this increasingly

00:19:36.275 --> 00:19:40.846
diverse nation, then each
one of us need to try to

00:19:40.846 --> 00:19:44.449
heed the advice of a great
character in American

00:19:44.449 --> 00:19:46.785
fiction -- Atticus Finch --

00:19:46.785 --> 00:19:47.619
(applause)

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:51.156
-- who said "You never really
understand a person until

00:19:51.156 --> 00:19:54.426
you consider things from
his point of view...until

00:19:54.426 --> 00:20:00.532
you climb into his skin
and walk around in it."

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:03.769
For blacks and other
minority groups, it means

00:20:03.769 --> 00:20:08.106
tying our own very real
struggles for justice to

00:20:08.106 --> 00:20:10.008
the challenges that a lot
of people in this country

00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:14.713
face -- not only the
refugee, or the immigrant,

00:20:14.713 --> 00:20:17.616
or the rural poor, or the
transgender American, but

00:20:17.616 --> 00:20:21.520
also the middle-aged white
guy who, from the outside,

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.791
may seem like he's got
advantages, but has seen

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:28.527
his world upended by
economic and cultural and

00:20:28.527 --> 00:20:31.830
technological change.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:34.066
We have to pay
attention, and listen.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:44.343
(Applause.)

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:45.611
For white Americans, it means

00:20:45.611 --> 00:20:48.113
acknowledging that the
effects of slavery and Jim

00:20:48.113 --> 00:20:50.749
Crow didn't suddenly
vanish in the '60s --

00:20:50.749 --> 00:20:53.952
(applause)

00:20:53.952 --> 00:20:57.022
-- that when
minority groups voice

00:20:57.022 --> 00:20:59.925
discontent, they're not
just engaging in reverse

00:20:59.925 --> 00:21:04.096
racism or practicing
political correctness.

00:21:04.096 --> 00:21:05.797
When they wage peaceful
protest, they're not

00:21:05.797 --> 00:21:08.266
demanding special
treatment but the equal

00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:10.402
treatment that our
Founders promised.

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:23.815
(Applause.)

00:21:23.815 --> 00:21:32.057
native-born Americans, it

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:34.660
means reminding ourselves
that the stereotypes about

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:39.097
immigrants today were
said, almost word for

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:46.738
word, about the Irish, and
Italians, and Poles -- who

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:50.709
it was said we're going to
destroy the fundamental

00:21:50.709 --> 00:21:53.578
character of America.

00:21:53.578 --> 00:21:55.814
And as it turned out,
America wasn't weakened by

00:21:55.814 --> 00:21:59.117
the presence of these
newcomers; these newcomers

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:03.622
embraced this nation's
creed, and this nation

00:22:03.622 --> 00:22:05.190
was strengthened.

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:06.892
(Applause.)

00:22:06.892 --> 00:22:14.232
So regardless of the station that we

00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:18.870
occupy, we all
have to try harder.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:21.373
We all have to start with
the premise that each of

00:22:21.373 --> 00:22:24.543
our fellow citizens loves
this country just as much

00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:28.947
as we do; that they value
hard work and family just

00:22:28.947 --> 00:22:32.551
like we do; that their
children are just as

00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:37.022
curious and hopeful and
worthy of love as our own.

00:22:37.022 --> 00:22:48.066
(Applause.)

00:22:48.066 --> 00:22:52.137
And that's not easy to do.

00:22:52.137 --> 00:22:56.108
For too many of us, it's
become safer to retreat

00:22:56.108 --> 00:22:58.977
into our own bubbles,
whether in our

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:02.914
neighborhoods or on
college campuses, or

00:23:02.914 --> 00:23:06.518
places of worship, or
especially our social

00:23:06.518 --> 00:23:12.791
media feeds, surrounded by
people who look like us

00:23:12.791 --> 00:23:14.159
and share the same
political outlook and

00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:19.197
never challenge
our assumptions.

00:23:19.197 --> 00:23:22.100
The rise of naked
partisanship, and

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.071
increasing economic and
regional stratification,

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:30.208
the splintering of our
media into a channel for

00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:34.913
every taste -- all this
makes this great sorting

00:23:34.913 --> 00:23:39.718
seem natural,
even inevitable.

00:23:39.718 --> 00:23:42.320
And increasingly, we
become so secure in our

00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.024
bubbles that we
start accepting only

00:23:46.024 --> 00:23:48.693
information, whether it's
true or not, that fits our

00:23:48.693 --> 00:23:52.197
opinions, instead of
basing our opinions on the

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:54.099
evidence that
is out there.

00:23:54.099 --> 00:24:03.241
(Applause.)

00:24:03.241 --> 00:24:04.676
And this trend represents a

00:24:04.676 --> 00:24:09.080
third threat to our democracy.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.951
But politics is a
battle of ideas.

00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:14.920
That's how our
democracy was designed.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.489
In the course of a healthy
debate, we prioritize

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:20.859
different goals, and
the different means

00:24:20.859 --> 00:24:23.662
of reaching them.

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:28.099
But without some common
baseline of facts, without

00:24:28.099 --> 00:24:32.971
a willingness to admit new
information, and concede

00:24:32.971 --> 00:24:37.642
that your opponent might
be making a fair point,

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:40.212
and that science and
reason matter --

00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:40.846
(applause)

00:24:40.846 --> 00:24:42.581
-- then we're going to keep talking past

00:24:42.581 --> 00:24:45.917
each other, and we'll
make common ground and

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:47.953
compromise impossible.

00:24:47.953 --> 00:24:53.058
(Applause.)

00:24:53.058 --> 00:24:56.494
And isn't that part of what so often

00:24:56.494 --> 00:25:01.766
makes politics
dispiriting?

00:25:01.766 --> 00:25:04.035
How can elected officials
rage about deficits when

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:07.339
we propose to spend money
on preschool for kids, but

00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.407
not when we're cutting
taxes for corporations?

00:25:09.407 --> 00:25:11.243
(Applause.)

00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:13.745
How do we excuse ethical lapses

00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:16.314
in our own party, but pounce
when the other party does

00:25:16.314 --> 00:25:20.785
the same thing?

00:25:20.785 --> 00:25:24.055
It's not just dishonest,
this selective sorting of

00:25:24.055 --> 00:25:29.561
the facts; it's
self-defeating.

00:25:29.561 --> 00:25:33.064
Because, as my mother used
to tell me, reality has a

00:25:33.064 --> 00:25:34.633
way of catching
up with you.

00:25:34.633 --> 00:25:41.640
(Applause.)

00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.676
Take the challenge of climate change.

00:25:44.676 --> 00:25:47.445
In just eight years, we've
halved our dependence on

00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:50.448
foreign oil; we've doubled
our renewable energy;

00:25:50.448 --> 00:25:52.250
we've led the world to an
agreement that has the

00:25:52.250 --> 00:25:53.785
promise to save
this planet.

00:25:53.785 --> 00:26:04.029
(Applause.)

00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:07.265
But without
bolder action, our

00:26:07.265 --> 00:26:09.200
children won't have time
to debate the existence of

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.936
climate change.

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:14.639
They'll be busy dealing
with its effects: more

00:26:14.639 --> 00:26:18.043
environmental disasters,
more economic disruptions,

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:23.782
waves of climate refugees
seeking sanctuary.

00:26:23.782 --> 00:26:26.985
Now, we can and should
argue about the best

00:26:26.985 --> 00:26:30.055
approach to solve
the problem.

00:26:30.055 --> 00:26:34.693
But to simply deny the
problem not only betrays

00:26:34.693 --> 00:26:41.333
future generations, it
betrays the essential

00:26:41.333 --> 00:26:43.134
spirit of this country --
the essential spirit of

00:26:43.134 --> 00:26:46.871
innovation and practical
problem-solving that

00:26:46.871 --> 00:26:47.739
guided our Founders.

00:26:47.739 --> 00:26:58.616
(Applause.)

00:26:58.616 --> 00:27:02.487
It is that spirit, born of the

00:27:02.487 --> 00:27:07.292
Enlightenment, that made
us an economic powerhouse

00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:10.061
-- the spirit that took
flight at Kitty Hawk and

00:27:10.061 --> 00:27:15.500
Cape Canaveral; the spirit
that cures disease and put

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.070
a computer in
every pocket.

00:27:19.070 --> 00:27:22.907
It's that spirit -- a
faith in reason, and

00:27:22.907 --> 00:27:26.611
enterprise, and the
primacy of right over

00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:30.515
might -- that allowed us
to resist the lure of

00:27:30.515 --> 00:27:38.223
fascism and tyranny during
the Great Depression; that

00:27:38.223 --> 00:27:40.492
allowed us to build a
post-World War II order

00:27:40.492 --> 00:27:44.329
with other democracies, an
order based not just on

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:49.901
military power or national
affiliations but built on

00:27:49.901 --> 00:27:53.838
principles -- the rule of
law, human rights, freedom

00:27:53.838 --> 00:27:55.640
of religion, and speech,
and assembly, and an

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.009
independent press.

00:27:58.009 --> 00:28:10.488
(Applause.)

00:28:10.488 --> 00:28:12.157
That order is now being challenged --

00:28:12.157 --> 00:28:15.527
first by violent fanatics
who claim to speak for

00:28:15.527 --> 00:28:19.964
Islam; more recently by
autocrats in foreign

00:28:19.964 --> 00:28:22.567
capitals who see free
markets and open

00:28:22.567 --> 00:28:25.503
democracies and and civil
society itself as a

00:28:25.503 --> 00:28:29.874
threat to their power.

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:33.745
The peril each poses to
our democracy is more

00:28:33.745 --> 00:28:41.419
far-reaching than a
car bomb or a missile.

00:28:41.419 --> 00:28:45.356
It represents the fear of
change; the fear of people

00:28:45.356 --> 00:28:50.662
who look or speak or pray
differently; a contempt

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:54.499
for the rule of law that
holds leaders accountable;

00:28:54.499 --> 00:28:59.137
an intolerance of dissent
and free thought; a belief

00:28:59.137 --> 00:29:04.109
that the sword or the
gun or the bomb or the

00:29:04.109 --> 00:29:06.878
propaganda machine is the
ultimate arbiter of what's

00:29:06.878 --> 00:29:13.351
true and what's right.

00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:15.286
Because of the
extraordinary courage of

00:29:15.286 --> 00:29:17.522
our men and women in
uniform, because of our

00:29:17.522 --> 00:29:20.325
intelligence officers,
and law enforcement, and

00:29:20.325 --> 00:29:22.794
diplomats who support our
troops --

00:29:22.794 --> 00:29:26.064
(applause)

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:28.933
-- no foreign terrorist
organization has

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:31.903
successfully planned and
executed an attack on our

00:29:31.903 --> 00:29:34.038
homeland these
past eight years.

00:29:34.038 --> 00:29:37.976
(Applause.)

00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:43.314
And although Boston and Orlando and San

00:29:43.314 --> 00:29:49.721
Bernardino and Fort Hood
remind us of how dangerous

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:53.958
radicalization can be, our
law enforcement agencies

00:29:53.958 --> 00:29:56.928
are more effective and
vigilant than ever.

00:29:56.928 --> 00:29:58.830
We have taken out tens of
thousands of terrorists --

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.331
including bin Laden.

00:30:00.331 --> 00:30:05.803
(Applause.)

00:30:05.803 --> 00:30:07.372
The global coalition we're leading

00:30:07.372 --> 00:30:10.608
against ISIL has taken out
their leaders, and taken

00:30:10.608 --> 00:30:12.844
away about half
their territory.

00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:15.213
ISIL will be destroyed,
and no one who threatens

00:30:15.213 --> 00:30:17.015
America will ever be safe.

00:30:17.015 --> 00:30:19.784
(Applause.)

00:30:19.784 --> 00:30:22.921
And to all who serve or have served,

00:30:22.921 --> 00:30:24.989
it has been the honor of
my lifetime to be your

00:30:24.989 --> 00:30:26.858
Commander-in-Chief.

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:29.594
And we all owe you a
deep debt of gratitude.

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:54.519
(Applause.)

00:30:54.519 --> 00:30:55.520
But protecting our way of

00:30:55.520 --> 00:31:00.625
life, that's not just
the job of our military.

00:31:00.625 --> 00:31:07.232
Democracy can buckle
when we give in to fear.

00:31:07.232 --> 00:31:11.069
So, just as we, as
citizens, must remain

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:16.874
vigilant against external
aggression, we must guard

00:31:16.874 --> 00:31:18.977
against a weakening of the
values that make

00:31:18.977 --> 00:31:20.545
us who we are.

00:31:20.545 --> 00:31:23.348
(Applause.)

00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:24.549
And that's why, for the past eight

00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:27.919
years, I've worked to
put the fight against

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:31.222
terrorism on a firmer
legal footing.

00:31:31.222 --> 00:31:33.324
That's why we've ended
torture, worked to close

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:37.161
Gitmo, reformed our laws
governing surveillance to

00:31:37.161 --> 00:31:38.930
protect privacy and
civil liberties.

00:31:38.930 --> 00:31:41.499
(Applause.)

00:31:41.499 --> 00:31:43.801
That's why
I reject discrimination

00:31:43.801 --> 00:31:47.171
against Muslim Americans,
who are just as patriotic

00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:48.039
as we are.

00:31:48.039 --> 00:32:04.989
(Applause.)

00:32:04.989 --> 00:32:16.167
That's why we
cannot withdraw from big

00:32:16.167 --> 00:32:20.772
global fights -- to expand
democracy, and human

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:23.474
rights, and women's
rights, and LGBT rights.

00:32:23.474 --> 00:32:29.681
No matter how imperfect
our efforts, no matter how

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:35.453
expedient ignoring such
values may seem, that's

00:32:35.453 --> 00:32:39.857
part of defending America.

00:32:39.857 --> 00:32:44.462
For the fight against
extremism and intolerance

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:49.634
and sectarianism and
chauvinism are of a piece

00:32:49.634 --> 00:32:52.403
with the fight against
authoritarianism and

00:32:52.403 --> 00:32:57.442
nationalist aggression.

00:32:57.442 --> 00:33:02.046
If the scope of freedom
and respect for the rule

00:33:02.046 --> 00:33:05.583
of law shrinks around the
world, the likelihood of

00:33:05.583 --> 00:33:10.855
war within and between
nations increases, and our

00:33:10.855 --> 00:33:16.594
own freedoms will
eventually be threatened.

00:33:16.594 --> 00:33:18.663
So let's be vigilant,
but not afraid.

00:33:18.663 --> 00:33:20.398
(Applause.)

00:33:20.398 --> 00:33:25.503
ISIL will try
to kill innocent people.

00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:27.972
But they cannot defeat
America unless we betray

00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:30.608
our Constitution and our
principles in the fight.

00:33:30.608 --> 00:33:36.748
(Applause.)

00:33:36.748 --> 00:33:38.750
Rivals like
Russia or China cannot

00:33:38.750 --> 00:33:41.452
match our influence around
the world -- unless we

00:33:41.452 --> 00:33:44.122
give up what we stand for --

00:33:44.122 --> 00:33:45.523
(applause)

00:33:45.523 --> 00:33:47.992
-- and turn ourselves into just
another big country that

00:33:47.992 --> 00:33:54.932
bullies smaller neighbors.

00:33:54.932 --> 00:34:02.940
Which brings me to my
final point: Our democracy

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:06.411
is threatened whenever
we take it for granted.

00:34:06.411 --> 00:34:11.115
(Applause.)

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:15.887
All of us,
regardless of party,

00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:18.723
should be throwing
ourselves into the task of

00:34:18.723 --> 00:34:21.993
rebuilding our
democratic institutions.

00:34:21.993 --> 00:34:26.297
(Applause.)

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:29.267
When voting
rates in America are some

00:34:29.267 --> 00:34:31.803
of the lowest among
advanced democracies, we

00:34:31.803 --> 00:34:33.571
should be making it
easier, not harder,

00:34:33.571 --> 00:34:34.839
to vote.

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:42.046
(Applause.)

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:50.688
When trust in
our institutions is low,

00:34:50.688 --> 00:34:52.890
we should reduce the
corrosive influence of

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:56.227
money in our politics, and
insist on the principles

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:59.163
of transparency and
ethics in public service.

00:34:59.163 --> 00:35:02.133
(Applause.)

00:35:02.133 --> 00:35:05.536
When Congress
is dysfunctional, we

00:35:05.536 --> 00:35:07.939
should draw our
congressional districts to

00:35:07.939 --> 00:35:11.375
encourage politicians to
cater to common sense and

00:35:11.375 --> 00:35:12.810
not rigid extremes.

00:35:12.810 --> 00:35:18.683
(Applause.)

00:35:18.683 --> 00:35:21.419
But remember,
none of this happens

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:29.126
on its own.

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.394
All of this depends on our
participation; on each of

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:33.264
us accepting the
responsibility of

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:37.401
citizenship, regardless of
which way the pendulum of

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:43.774
power happens
to be swinging.

00:35:43.774 --> 00:35:46.043
Our Constitution is a

00:35:46.043 --> 00:35:51.449
remarkable, beautiful gift.

00:35:51.449 --> 00:35:57.655
But it's really just
a piece of parchment.

00:35:57.655 --> 00:36:01.692
It has no power
on its own.

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:04.562
We, the people,
give it power.

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:05.496
(Applause.)

00:36:05.496 --> 00:36:08.432
We, the
people, give it meaning.

00:36:08.432 --> 00:36:10.735
With our participation,
and with the choices that

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:15.439
we make, and the
alliances that we forge.

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:17.174
(Applause.)

00:36:17.174 --> 00:36:18.409
Whether or
not we stand up for

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:19.510
our freedoms.

00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:21.245
Whether or not we respect
and enforce the

00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:23.681
rule of law.

00:36:23.681 --> 00:36:27.652
That's up to us.

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:29.787
America is no
fragile thing.

00:36:29.787 --> 00:36:32.290
But the gains of our long
journey to freedom

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:37.728
are not assured.

00:36:37.728 --> 00:36:40.064
In his own farewell
address, George Washington

00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:43.768
wrote that self-government
is the underpinning of our

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:50.775
safety, prosperity,
and liberty, but "from

00:36:50.775 --> 00:36:55.212
different causes and from
different quarters much

00:36:55.212 --> 00:36:58.516
pains will be taken...to
weaken in your minds the

00:36:58.516 --> 00:37:02.286
conviction of this truth."

00:37:02.286 --> 00:37:06.390
And so we have to preserve
this truth with "jealous

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:10.428
anxiety;" that we should
reject "the first dawning

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:13.531
of every attempt to
alienate any portion of

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:17.668
our country from the rest
or to enfeeble the sacred

00:37:17.668 --> 00:37:19.870
ties" that make us one.

00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:28.879
(Applause.)

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:30.915
America, we
weaken those ties when we

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:32.850
allow our political
dialogue to become so

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:37.421
corrosive that people of
good character aren't even

00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:41.559
willing to enter into
public service; so coarse

00:37:41.559 --> 00:37:46.197
with rancor that Americans
with whom we disagree are

00:37:46.197 --> 00:37:52.236
seen not just as misguided
but as malevolent.

00:37:52.236 --> 00:37:55.106
We weaken those ties when
we define some of us as

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:58.843
more American than others;
when we write off the

00:37:58.843 --> 00:38:06.350
whole system as inevitably
corrupt, and when we sit

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:11.956
back and blame the leaders
we elect without examining

00:38:11.956 --> 00:38:13.991
our own role in
electing them.

00:38:13.991 --> 00:38:25.336
(Applause.)

00:38:25.336 --> 00:38:28.506
It falls to
each of us to be those

00:38:28.506 --> 00:38:31.275
those anxious, jealous
guardians of our

00:38:31.275 --> 00:38:36.180
democracy; to embrace the
joyous task we've been

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:41.318
given to continually try
to improve this great

00:38:41.318 --> 00:38:45.056
nation of ours.

00:38:45.056 --> 00:38:48.993
Because for all our
outward differences, we,

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:54.365
in fact, all share the
same proud title, the most

00:38:54.365 --> 00:39:00.304
important office in a
democracy: Citizen.

00:39:00.304 --> 00:39:03.741
(Applause.)

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:12.083
Citizen. So, you see, that's

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:19.056
what our democracy demands. It needs you.

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:22.159
Not just when there's an
election, not just when

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:26.664
your own narrow interest
is at stake, but over the

00:39:26.664 --> 00:39:30.401
full span of a lifetime.

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:32.136
If you're tired of arguing
with strangers on the

00:39:32.136 --> 00:39:37.108
Internet, try talking with
one of them in real life.

00:39:37.108 --> 00:39:52.056
(Applause.)

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:54.258
If something
needs fixing, then lace up

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:56.026
your shoes and do
some organizing.

00:39:56.026 --> 00:40:00.931
(Applause.)

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:02.733
If you're
disappointed by your

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:05.603
elected officials, grab
a clipboard, get some

00:40:05.603 --> 00:40:08.339
signatures, and run
for office yourself.

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:17.014
(Applause.)

00:40:17.014 --> 00:40:18.916
Show up.

00:40:18.916 --> 00:40:21.986
Dive in.

00:40:21.986 --> 00:40:24.722
Stay at it.

00:40:24.722 --> 00:40:26.357
Sometimes you'll win.

00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:30.361
Sometimes you'll lose.

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:34.231
Presuming a reservoir of
goodness in other people,

00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:37.234
that can be a risk, and
there will be times when

00:40:37.234 --> 00:40:41.605
the process will
disappoint you.

00:40:41.605 --> 00:40:43.941
But for those of us
fortunate enough to have

00:40:43.941 --> 00:40:47.678
been a part of this work,
and to see it up close,

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:50.848
let me tell you, it can
energize and inspire.

00:40:50.848 --> 00:40:58.589
And more often than not,
your faith in America --

00:40:58.589 --> 00:41:02.393
and in Americans --
will be confirmed.

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:04.562
(Applause.)

00:41:04.562 --> 00:41:08.966
Mine sure has been.

00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:12.937
Over the course of these
eight years, I've seen the

00:41:12.937 --> 00:41:16.040
hopeful faces of young
graduates and our newest

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.677
military officers.

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:24.014
I have mourned with
grieving families

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:27.952
searching for answers,
and found grace in a

00:41:27.952 --> 00:41:30.921
Charleston church.

00:41:30.921 --> 00:41:33.457
I've seen our scientists
help a paralyzed man

00:41:33.457 --> 00:41:37.061
regain his sense of touch.

00:41:37.061 --> 00:41:42.399
I've seen wounded warriors
who at points were given

00:41:42.399 --> 00:41:46.170
up for dead walk again.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:48.706
I've seen our doctors and
volunteers rebuild after

00:41:48.706 --> 00:41:53.644
earthquakes and stop
pandemics in their tracks.

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:58.015
I've seen the youngest of
children remind us through

00:41:58.015 --> 00:42:01.051
their actions and through
their generosity of our

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:04.121
obligations to care for
refugees, or work for

00:42:04.121 --> 00:42:12.029
peace, and, above all, to
look out for each other.

00:42:12.029 --> 00:42:15.466
(Applause.)

00:42:15.466 --> 00:42:17.434
So that faith
that I placed all those

00:42:17.434 --> 00:42:20.804
years ago, not far from
here, in the power of

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:25.709
ordinary Americans to
bring about change -- that

00:42:25.709 --> 00:42:27.678
faith has been rewarded
in ways I could not have

00:42:27.678 --> 00:42:30.714
possibly imagined.

00:42:30.714 --> 00:42:33.851
And I hope your
faith has, too.

00:42:33.851 --> 00:42:37.254
Some of you here tonight
or watching at home, you

00:42:37.254 --> 00:42:41.926
were there with us in
2004, in 2008, 2012 --

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:51.168
(applause)

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:52.169
-- maybe you
still can't believe we

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:56.273
pulled this
whole thing off.

00:42:56.273 --> 00:42:57.708
Let me tell you, you're
not the only ones.

00:42:57.708 --> 00:42:59.543
(Laughter.)

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:01.378
Michelle --

00:43:01.378 --> 00:43:31.308
(applause)

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:35.846
-- Michelle LaVaughn Robinson, girl of the South Side --

00:43:35.846 --> 00:43:43.120
(applause)

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.023
-- for the past
25 years, you have not

00:43:46.023 --> 00:43:49.827
only been my wife and
mother of my children, you

00:43:49.827 --> 00:43:51.161
have been my best friend.

00:43:51.161 --> 00:44:00.437
(Applause.)

00:44:00.437 --> 00:44:03.807
You took on a
role you didn't ask for

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:07.945
and you made it your own,
with grace and with grit

00:44:07.945 --> 00:44:10.347
and with style
and good humor.

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:41.979
(Applause.)

00:44:41.979 --> 00:44:43.247
You made the
White House a place that

00:44:43.247 --> 00:44:44.915
belongs to everybody.

00:44:44.915 --> 00:44:45.883
(Applause.)

00:44:45.883 --> 00:44:47.651
And the new
generation sets its sights

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:50.220
higher because it has
you as a role model.

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.356
(Applause.)

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:55.426
So you
have made me proud.

00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:56.760
And you have made
the country proud.

00:44:56.760 --> 00:45:10.140
(Applause.)

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:14.912
Malia and
Sasha, under the strangest

00:45:14.912 --> 00:45:18.682
of circumstances, you have
become two

00:45:18.682 --> 00:45:21.318
amazing young women.

00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:23.353
You are smart and you
are beautiful, but more

00:45:23.353 --> 00:45:26.056
importantly, you are kind
and you are thoughtful and

00:45:26.056 --> 00:45:27.291
you are full of passion.

00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:38.135
(Applause.)

00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:40.137
You wore the
burden of years in the

00:45:40.137 --> 00:45:43.774
spotlight so easily.

00:45:43.774 --> 00:45:47.077
Of all that I've done in
my life, I am most proud

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:48.612
to be your dad.

00:45:48.612 --> 00:45:59.022
(Applause.)

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:00.491
To Joe Biden --

00:46:00.491 --> 00:46:16.140
(applause) --

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.477
the scrappy kid from Scranton who became Delaware's

00:46:20.477 --> 00:46:26.617
favorite son -- you were
the first decision I made

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:29.286
as a nominee, and
it was the best.

00:46:29.286 --> 00:46:33.657
(Applause.)

00:46:33.657 --> 00:46:35.192
Not just because you have been a

00:46:35.192 --> 00:46:38.662
great Vice President, but
because in the bargain, I

00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:41.231
gained a brother.

00:46:41.231 --> 00:46:43.734
And we love you and Jill
like family, and your

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:45.802
friendship has been one
of the great joys

00:46:45.802 --> 00:46:47.037
of our lives.

00:46:47.037 --> 00:46:59.449
(Applause.)

00:46:59.449 --> 00:47:03.353
To my remarkable staff: For

00:47:03.353 --> 00:47:05.422
eight years -- and for
some of you, a whole lot

00:47:05.422 --> 00:47:10.928
more -- I have drawn from
your energy, and every day

00:47:10.928 --> 00:47:15.165
I tried to reflect back
what you displayed --

00:47:15.165 --> 00:47:21.238
heart, and character,
and idealism.

00:47:21.238 --> 00:47:26.143
I've watched you grow up,
get married, have kids,

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:32.449
start incredible new
journeys of your own.

00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:35.052
Even when times got tough
and frustrating, you never

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:38.956
let Washington get
the better of you.

00:47:38.956 --> 00:47:42.759
You guarded
against cynicism.

00:47:42.759 --> 00:47:44.628
And the only thing that
makes me prouder than all

00:47:44.628 --> 00:47:48.465
the good that we've done
is the thought of all the

00:47:48.465 --> 00:47:49.566
amazing things that you're

00:47:49.566 --> 00:47:50.801
going to achieve from here.

00:47:50.801 --> 00:48:02.212
(Applause.)

00:48:02.212 --> 00:48:03.880
And to all of you out there --

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.318
every organizer who moved to an
unfamiliar town, every

00:48:08.318 --> 00:48:12.723
kind family who welcomed
them in, every volunteer

00:48:12.723 --> 00:48:15.058
who knocked on doors,
every young person who

00:48:15.058 --> 00:48:18.662
cast a ballot for the
first time, every American

00:48:18.662 --> 00:48:22.966
who lived and breathed the
hard work of change -- you

00:48:22.966 --> 00:48:25.836
are the best supporters
and organizers anybody

00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:28.972
could ever hope for, and I
will be forever grateful.

00:48:28.972 --> 00:48:30.674
(Applause.)

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:31.975
Because you
did change the world.

00:48:31.975 --> 00:48:34.177
(Applause.)

00:48:34.177 --> 00:48:37.781
You did.

00:48:37.781 --> 00:48:41.118
And that's why I leave
this stage tonight even

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:42.986
more optimistic about
this country than

00:48:42.986 --> 00:48:45.889
when we started.

00:48:45.889 --> 00:48:48.492
Because I know our work
has not only helped so

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:52.763
many Americans, it has
inspired so many Americans

00:48:52.763 --> 00:48:56.833
-- especially so many
young people out there --

00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:58.268
to believe that you can
make a difference --

00:48:58.268 --> 00:48:59.503
(applause)

00:48:59.503 --> 00:49:00.804
-- to hitch
your wagon to something

00:49:00.804 --> 00:49:04.074
bigger than yourselves.

00:49:04.074 --> 00:49:06.343
Let me tell you, this
generation coming up --

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:11.381
unselfish, altruistic,
creative, patriotic --

00:49:11.381 --> 00:49:15.652
I've seen you in every
corner of the country.

00:49:15.652 --> 00:49:17.387
You believe in a fair,

00:49:17.387 --> 00:49:18.755
and just, and inclusive America.

00:49:18.755 --> 00:49:21.058
(Applause.)

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:23.293
You know that
constant change has been

00:49:23.293 --> 00:49:27.264
America's hallmark; that
it's not something to fear

00:49:27.264 --> 00:49:29.032
but something to embrace.

00:49:29.032 --> 00:49:31.201
You are willing to
carry this hard work of

00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:33.970
democracy forward.

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:36.473
You'll soon outnumber all
of us, and I believe as a

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:38.975
result the future
is in good hands.

00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:50.420
(Applause.)

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:54.191
My fellow
Americans, it has been the

00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:55.926
honor of my life
to serve you.

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:57.260
(Applause.)

00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.696
I won't stop.

00:49:59.696 --> 00:50:02.032
In fact, I will be right
there with you, as a

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:09.606
citizen, for all
my remaining days.

00:50:09.606 --> 00:50:11.942
But for now, whether you
are young or whether

00:50:11.942 --> 00:50:15.779
you're young at heart, I
do have one final ask of

00:50:15.779 --> 00:50:19.683
you as your President --
the same thing I asked

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:23.453
when you took a chance
on me eight years ago.

00:50:23.453 --> 00:50:26.923
I'm asking you to believe.

00:50:26.923 --> 00:50:29.359
Not in my ability to bring
about change

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:31.461
-- but in yours.

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:34.531
I am asking you to hold
fast to that faith written

00:50:34.531 --> 00:50:37.634
into our founding
documents; that idea

00:50:37.634 --> 00:50:41.505
whispered by slaves and
abolitionists; that spirit

00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:44.941
sung by immigrants and
homesteaders and those who

00:50:44.941 --> 00:50:50.247
marched for justice; that
creed reaffirmed by those

00:50:50.247 --> 00:50:52.916
who planted flags from
foreign battlefields to

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:56.253
the surface of the moon; a
creed at the core of every

00:50:56.253 --> 00:51:00.257
American whose story is
not yet written:

00:51:00.257 --> 00:51:01.291
Yes, we can.

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:02.592
(Applause.)

00:51:02.592 --> 00:51:04.661
Yes, we did.

00:51:04.661 --> 00:51:05.862
Yes, we can.

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:07.130
(Applause.)

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.931
Thank you.

00:51:07.931 --> 00:51:09.900
God bless you.

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:13.670
May God continue to bless
the United States of America.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:16.940
(Applause.)
