00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.910
Think of nuclear power, and
many imagine the worst.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.680
Atomic bombs, reactors melting
down, radioactive wastes.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.940
There's no denying that the history
of nuclear is fraught, and the

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.190
dramatic and disturbing moments
hard to forget.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.440
But for the most part, nuclear energy
operates out of sight and out of

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.060
mind, generating about 10 percent
of the world's total electricity.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.190
This represents 29 percent of all
the world's low-carbon power and 55

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.440
percent of the United
States' low-carbon power.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.930
Nuclear reactors generate energy day and
night, and produce no greenhouse

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.790
gases. But overall, the growth of
nuclear is slowing in comparison to

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.200
other low-carbon sources like
wind and solar.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.740
By 2050, all 420 nuclear plants
operating today must be replaced.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.640
We're not on a path to get there.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.480
Nuclear power plants are expensive
to build, construction often takes

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.210
longer than expected, and debates over
how to handle radioactive wastes

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.170
rage on. What's more, public opposition
to nuclear power is strong,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.600
especially in the U.S.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.890
But we're in the midst of a
climate crisis, and many energy experts argue

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.550
that despite a contentious history, nuclear has
a key role to play in our

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.160
energy future as a stable,
always available source of power.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.410
As we replace coal, we really do
need another form of what we call

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.680
spinning reserve. You know, large power
plants that when the wind isn't

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.000
blowing or the sun isn't
shining, that power is available.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.670
And nuclear is going to be
the best solution for that.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.340
If you just believe in
arithmetic, you need nuclear.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.460
Some experts are working to
upgrade existing nuclear power technology.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.460
That means designing safer and more
efficient fission reactors, with the

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.570
support of philanthropists
like Bill Gates.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.990
But government labs, private
investors and intergovernmental organizations

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.350
are also devoting vast resources to what
many consider the holy grail of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.240
energy: nuclear fusion.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.670
Good grief, the energy potential
there is just enormous.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.140
The energy that we need is
going to be mastering this fusion.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.520
Nuclear fusion is the same process that
powers our sun and every other

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.610
star in the universe.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.700
And if we can figure out how to
harness that power here on earth, it would

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.010
be a huge game changer.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.420
Nuclear fission was discovered in late
1938 by a pair of German

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.130
researchers. They found out that when
you bombard uranium with neutrons,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.580
the nucleus splits, forming two lighter
isotopes and releasing mass that

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.860
gets converted into energy.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.640
The discovery paved the way for the
development of the atomic bomb in the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.760
United States. And after the infamous
bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.350
concerns over nuclear proliferation spiraled
as the global nuclear

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.490
stockpile grew during the Cold War
between the United States and the

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.590
Soviet Union. But in 1953, President
Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.850
attempted to shift the focus of
nuclear power toward peaceful energy

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.340
generation, and much of the world
started building nuclear power plants

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.500
for civilian use.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.090
Private industry quickly jumped on board,
especially in the United States,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.040
and by 1991, the U.S.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.710
had twice as many operating nuclear
power plants as any other country.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.460
If those all of a sudden went away
and you had to make that electricity

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.920
with fossil fuel, it would be like
doubling the number of cars on the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.520
road. So our 100 nuclear
power plants in the U.S.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.240
are helping us avoid, and have been for
like 50 years, helping us avoid a

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.950
significant amount of
carbon generation.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.040
As of 2019, about 450 reactors
worldwide operate in 31 countries.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.130
And some countries, such as France,
Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine, get

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.300
more than half of their
power from nuclear energy.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.830
But over the decades, a number
of high-profile disasters have stalled the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.690
industry's momentum. In 1979, the
partial meltdown and ensuing radiation

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.650
leak at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania
cost about 1 billion dollars to

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.360
cleanup. The disaster stoked public
fears about nuclear power.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.590
Stricter safety standards
were imposed.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.820
Reactors became more expensive to
build and fewer were built.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.740
Fission is always also quite expensive, and
because of the large amount of

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.930
radioactivity in those machines, people
are scared of it.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.960
So the social acceptance of
fission is not very good.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.550
The nuclear disasters at Chernobyl in
1986 and Fukushima Daiichi in 2011

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.160
led to further scrutiny of the industry,
as concerns mounted over the long

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.000
term effects of
the radiation exposure.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.220
And then there's the battle over
where to store nuclear waste.

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.070
One proposed site, Yucca Mountain in
Nevada, has been hotly contested for

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.110
over 30 years.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.280
Yucca Mountain is unfit as a repository
site for nuclear waste because of

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.390
the impact it would
have on national transportation.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.070
The current state of
the industry remains mixed.

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.890
Countries such as China, India and Russia
are building new reactors at a

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.740
fairly fast clip. But in the United
States, more than one third remain

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.480
unprofitable or face closure.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.650
Frankly, we're rusty.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.520
If you look at countries like China
and Russia, we're being outnumbered by

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.520
30 to 1 on new builds.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.130
Only one new nuclear reactor has
come online in the U.S.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.260
since 1996, as costs and construction
times in developed economies have

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:16.860
spiraled. The typical nuclear plant today
in Europe costs well over 10

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.090
billion dollars and generally takes
10 years to build.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:27.320
The low cost of solar, wind and
in particular natural gas, has meant that

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.800
nuclear not only comes in at a
very expensive proposition, but it also

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.440
means that nuclear is not a
very friendly player in the market.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.570
Next generation fission technologies are much
safer than reactors of the

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.270
past, and some proponents claim
they'll be cheaper too.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.930
The general public may still need
convincing, but one idea has outlasted

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.850
the controversy. The promise that someday,
nuclear fusion will provide a

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:52.860
better alternative.

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.980
Scientists have been researching nuclear
fusion since the 1920s, ever

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.680
since they learned it's
what powers the sun.

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.120
In a fusion reaction, extreme
temperatures and intense pressure cause

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.360
hydrogen atoms to fuse
together, forming helium atoms.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.300
In the process, the atoms lose some
mass which is converted into vast

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.080
amounts of energy. The reaction could produce
four times as much energy as

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.010
nuclear fission and nearly 4 million
times more energy than burning coal

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.180
or gas. Or another way to think about it
is 2 pounds of fusion fuel is the

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.510
same as about fifty five
thousand barrels of oil.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.130
It doesn't contribute
to greenhouse gases.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.160
The fuel is plentiful and can
be found essentially everywhere in the

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.650
world. The radioactivity
would be short-lived.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.750
There's no possibility of a runaway
reaction, so it's an inherently safe

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:46.210
system. But after decades of research
and billions of dollars, scientists

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.170
still have not found a way
to create a sustained fusion reaction.

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.600
That's created a not-so-inside joke among
scientists that fusion is the

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.210
energy source of the future
and always will be.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:01.130
Every time physicists think that fusion
is around the corner, nature

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:07.320
tricks them. That nature resists taking
this large cloud of gas and

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.350
compressing it to the point where you
can get fusion out of it.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:14.700
When I talk to colleagues or like my
parents or family, they make fun of

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.050
me and say, "Oh yeah, you guys said
fusion is going to be coming 50 years

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.430
from now, and that was 50 years ago.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.300
Where are ya?" But some think these
questions and jokes overlook the real

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:24.490
progress that's been made.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:29.410
Although we don't have fusion, over the
last 30, 40 years, the amount of

00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.640
fusion that the prototypes make have increased
by a factor of 10 to the

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.690
four, 10,000 times.

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:37.740
And this is actually a growth rate
similar to the amount of transistors on

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.590
a chip. The challenges is, until you get
to the point where you build that

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.580
first power plant, everybody thinks
you haven't moved very far.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.290
Fusion has traditionally been the purview
of government labs like Lawrence

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:49.490
Livermore and Oak Ridge.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.840
But more recently, a number of private
companies have thrown their hat in

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.770
the ring. This includes General Fusion,
which aims to bring a commercial

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.630
reactor to market in the 2030s.

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:02.560
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is
among the company's investors.

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.480
And then there's the large multinational
effort that's underway in the

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.250
south of France called
the International Thermonuclear Experimental

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:14.180
Reactor, or ITER, the project aims to
create the world's largest and most

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:15.550
powerful fusion reactor.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:20.270
While all of these players are
competing for resources and funding, that

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.320
could actually be a good thing
for the nuclear power industry overall.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:28.560
The success of one company or one
group or one organization actually grows

00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:32.690
the pie. It convinces more people out
in business and in the economy to

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.280
look at fusion as
a viable alternative.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.090
And that attracts more
investment for everybody.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.340
General Fusion, founded in 2002, operates
out of a nondescript office park

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.080
about 20 minutes
outside of Vancouver.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:52.070
Unlike most government labs or
academic institutions, General Fusion is

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:54.240
focused on implementation
over research.

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.260
The company's goal is to build
an electricity-generating fusion reactor in

00:08:58.260 --> 00:08:59.410
the next decade or two.

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.130
Jeff Bezos was an early investor and
the company has now raised over 120

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:08.490
million, with about 90 million coming
from private investment and 30

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:09.860
million from the Canadian government.

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:15.480
General Fusion combines two common
approaches in the industry: Inertial

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.250
confinement, which subjects the fusion fuel
to extremely high pressure for

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.860
a brief amount of time, and
magnetic confinement, which uses modest

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:24.110
pressure for a prolonged time.

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.900
When heated to extreme temperatures, the
fusion fuel becomes a plasma, a

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.360
state of matter similar to gas,
except that it contains charged particles

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.990
that allow it to conduct electricity
and respond to magnetic fields.

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:41.520
Our compressor is going to be a big
sphere about 4 meters across, 15 feet

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:47.220
across on the inside. And into that big
sphere, we are going to put liquid

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.090
metal. And that liquid metal, we're going to
spin around in a circle so it

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:53.120
opens a hole. And into that hole we're
going to put our fuel, which is

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.160
hydrogen gas.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:56.320
It's preheated up to
a few million degrees.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:00.340
And then all around the outside of this
sphere is a big array of pistons

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:01.440
driven by compressed gas.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.940
So they push on the liquid metal and
they collapse the hole with this fuel

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:08.040
trapped inside. And that collapse happens
very quickly and compresses the

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.990
fuel up to fusion conditions.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:14.610
The peak of the compression, the fuel
ignites and gives a fusion reaction.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:16.720
That energy goes into
this liquid metal.

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:20.110
So the liquid metal heats up, you take
this hot liquid metal out, you run

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:22.500
it through a heat exchanger and
you boil water and make steam.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.000
And then the steam drives a turbine to
make electricity and puts it out on

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.220
the grid. And we just keep pulsing
and do that over and over again.

00:10:31.650 --> 00:10:35.150
Right now, General Fusion's main
components, like its plasma injector,

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.960
piston array and fuel
chamber, all exist separately.

00:10:38.630 --> 00:10:42.320
Delage wants to integrate them into
one large demonstration reactor, a

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.660
process he estimates will
take about five years.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:49.330
A space roughly this size would fit a
power plant that would be enough for

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:53.170
a hundred thousand homes. And when
the reactor goes online, Laberge says

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:56.370
it will bring General Fusion's cost
of power into competition with coal

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.180
and renewables like wind and solar.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.630
At 5 cents per kilowatt
hour, it's quite competitive, actually.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.250
Like it is cheaper
than many other things.

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.070
But it's not cheaper
than natural gas.

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.040
Laberge hopes it will eventually become
cheaper though, a likelihood if

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.300
the U.S. decides to
implement a carbon tax.

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.350
The energy market on the planet
is a trillion a year.

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:20.840
And so if we take a sizable chunk of
that, we get a sizable fraction of a

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.580
trillion dollars a year. But some
industry experts believe that private

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:27.950
companies like General Fusion are
being overly optimistic with their

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:32.230
timelines. In the past 10 years, there's
been a lot of small industries

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:36.540
coming in to say we can achieve
fusion in five years, ten years.

00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:38.380
I don't believe it.

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:43.950
I think they've underestimated and not looked
at the full challenge of a

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:47.100
fusion reactor. Nuclear
fusion is hard.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.600
No research group or company has ever
been able to reach the so-called

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:54.330
breakeven point, at which the energy
released from a fusion reaction is

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:57.810
greater than the energy required to heat
the plasma used in the reaction.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:03.220
This is not really
an energy technology.

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:06.290
It is basic research.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.450
Basic research has value.

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:14.310
But to sell this as a technology that
will solve our energy needs in the

00:12:14.310 --> 00:12:16.890
next 20 to 30 years is deceptive.

00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:18.100
We are just not that close.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.970
But basic research is the bread
and butter of Lawrence Livermore National

00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:27.510
Lab. It's been researching fusion since
its establishment in the 1950s.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.800
In 2009, the lab opened the National
Ignition Facility with the goal of

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.030
achieving breakeven and ultimately
igniting a fusion reaction.

00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:37.330
And by ignited we mean
that it can be self-sustaining.

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:42.070
It can propagate throughout all the
fuel that's present in the implosion.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.490
Lawrence Livermore is pursuing
inertial confinement fusion.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:49.480
That is, confining plasma at extremely
high pressure for a very short

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.380
amount of time, using high
energy lasers to do so.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.360
We're standing in what we call our
Target Bay, looking at our target

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:04.420
chamber. The target chamber is a big ball
about 30 feet across, and at the

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:09.030
very center of that ball, we put a
very tiny target about the size of the

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.970
tip of my finger, and we irradiate
that target with one hundred and ninety

00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:17.220
two of the world's
most energetic lasers.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:21.200
Researchers at the National Ignition Facility
and other national labs have

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:24.710
access to enormous computing power,
allowing them to run complex

00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:27.970
simulations that help them understand
the exact conditions necessary to

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.700
reach ignition. And so based on our
best simulations, they say that a

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:37.210
facility of this scale is big enough
to create this runaway reactions, if

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:39.350
everything works nearly ideally.

00:13:39.930 --> 00:13:42.750
But clearly, getting everything to work
perfectly in the real world is

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.380
much harder than it
looks on a screen.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.720
The National Ignition Facility was based
upon the promise of just that,

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.800
ignition. After 10 years of trying,
they haven't gotten anywhere close.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:57.420
And when they fail, they say, "All we
need is a little bit more money and

00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:01.890
time!" And the critics are saying,
"No, there's some fundamental problems

00:14:01.890 --> 00:14:05.430
here." So it could very well
be that neither the well-funded,

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.560
research-oriented national labs nor
the scrappy, goal-oriented startups

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:11.160
are going to solve the fusion puzzle.

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:14.090
It might just take
an international effort.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.220
The ITER project, originally known
as the International Thermonuclear

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:23.240
Experimental Reactor, originated nearly 35
years ago at the Geneva

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:28.260
Superpower Summit. Now China, the
European Union, India, Japan, Korea,

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.770
Russia and the United States are all
working together to build what would

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:35.540
be the world's largest tokamak reactor,
the donut shaped device used for

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.890
magnetic confinement fusion.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:41.790
Currently under construction, ITER's tokamak
reactor will be twice the

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:45.610
size of the current largest machine and
aims to produce 500 megawatts of

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.230
fusion power from 50
megawatts of heating power.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:53.630
I do believe that this is more
challenging than decoding DNA or putting a

00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:58.310
man on the moon. The literal
challenge is beyond today's capacity.

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:02.540
But Henderson says ITER is poised
to surpass previous efforts simply due

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:06.130
to the sheer scale of the
proposed machine, which builds upon already

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:07.510
established technologies.

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.960
Unlike General Fusion's ambitions, the immediate
goal of ITER is not

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:15.180
energy production, though the project does
have an eye towards eventual

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:20.430
commercialization. We'll start building the
actual tokamak itself, which

00:15:20.430 --> 00:15:24.870
is about 20 yards in diameter
and about 20 yards in height.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:32.170
And that device should be completed
around the 2024 period, and then

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:34.980
targeting to go nuclear
in the 2035 period.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:41.370
So by 2040, which seems a long
way, we will have gained all the

00:15:41.370 --> 00:15:45.580
information that allows the next
generations to build demos.

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.150
Henderson hopes that these demos will
achieve ignition, opening the door

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.200
for industrial scale reactors that
generate electricity for the grid.

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.890
And that is literally where
fusion will take off.

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:03.290
It's not in our lifespan, but it
is in our grandkid's or the

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.990
great-great-grandkid's type lifespan.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.970
It's a grand vision, but even if
ITER hits all its targets, how to

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.170
translate that into a commercially
viable reactor remains somewhat

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.750
unclear. That's an
entirely different problem.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:19.420
That'll take another 30
years at best.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.560
And whether the economics works
out is another question.

00:16:23.610 --> 00:16:26.890
Henderson says it's impossible to say
right now what a fusion reactor

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.030
would cost or if the
price point would be competitive.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.100
There is, however, a price
tag on ITER itself.

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.450
And while it's not cheap, it's
not necessarily exorbitant for an

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:36.820
undertaking of this magnitude.

00:16:37.750 --> 00:16:39.560
ITER is going to cost
roughly about 20 billion.

00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:45.810
It cost roughly about 120 billion in
today's money to put Neil Armstrong

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:49.540
on the moon. So we're
a fraction of that cost.

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:55.980
And yet what we're offering is
countless of generations a clean, basically

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:57.050
limitless energy source.

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.160
It's stupid we don't do this.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:02.710
Despite the project's obvious potential,
funding for ITER can be

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:06.120
intermittent and unreliable, as countries
like the United States

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.170
frequently change their contribution levels
in tandem with their election

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:10.720
cycles and energy budgets.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.940
Right now we're pretty much governed by
the electoral 4 year or 2 year

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.280
cycle. We need to
be looking beyond that.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.800
Not everyone thinks fusion is
so integral to our survival.

00:17:24.610 --> 00:17:26.160
Fusion isn't the only game out there.

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.970
Fission is like
fusion's ugly sibling.

00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.660
It's like no one wants
to get involved with it.

00:17:31.710 --> 00:17:36.990
But that is the only technology that
we have outside of solar and other

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:42.900
sorts of renewables, that we can
produce energy without carbon waste.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.520
Public opinion on nuclear fission remains
split, but many within the

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.460
industry say the
controversy is undeserved.

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:53.870
It's controversial for those who
haven't studied it carefully.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.140
For those who have studied
it carefully, it's not.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:18:01.650
You look at mortality rates per unit
of energy produced and nuclear is the

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:06.780
lowest of all. But there is
a fear because of its origins.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.980
Many proponents of nuclear say to look
back at the past to the accidents

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.650
that happened is being naive about
the innovation and evolution of

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.350
technologies. Microsoft's Bill Gates is
one of these proponents.

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.680
He's intent on building safer and
more efficient fission reactors to

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.000
reinvigorate the industry.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.490
In 2006, he founded TerraPower, a
nuclear reactor design company that's

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.970
working on building new
Generation 4 reactors.

00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.150
Most of the operating reactors around
the world today, of which there's

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.810
about 450, are Generation 2.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.370
Generation 3 plants are now being
built out in the U.S.,

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:46.860
in China, in Russia.

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:52.640
Generation 4 plants, they represent
improvements in not just economics,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:54.890
but safety and waste reduction.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.760
So the reactors that we're working on,
they operate not just at lower

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.560
pressures, which should be less expensive
than today's reactors, but they

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.460
operate at higher temperatures.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.370
When you move to those higher
temperatures, you actually get a higher

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:14.290
plant efficiency. Levesque also says
TerraPower's reactors are "walk-away

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.530
safe". That means that during emergencies,
the plant will cool and

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.620
stabilize itself without
an operator present.

00:19:20.850 --> 00:19:24.590
Furthermore, Levesque says the plant produces
80 percent less waste and

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:28.440
requires less uranium enrichment,
allaying proliferation concerns.

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:32.750
But getting new fission technologies off
the ground is an expensive

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:36.610
endeavor, so companies like TerraPower
want government support, both to

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:40.190
build out their tech and to help
them compete with cheaper power sources

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.470
such as natural gas.

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.590
The U.S. government does
this all the time.

00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:47.720
They did it in the case of hydraulic
fracturing, they did it in the case

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.740
of wind and solar, and now
it's time for the U.S.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.160
government to help demonstrate the next
phase of nuclear technology as

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:59.360
well. Levesque estimates that
building TerraPower's first demonstration

00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:03.300
reactor will cost more than a
billion dollars, ideally funded through a

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.630
public-private partnership.

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:10.910
I can't have my grandchildren, let
alone my children, rely on fusion.

00:20:11.260 --> 00:20:15.810
This is something we've got to do
because it's the one major system that

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:20.170
we know we can build. It's a matter
of how perfect we can make it, not

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:25.680
whether it'll work. So
here's where we stand.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.070
Fission proponents want to upgrade
existing nuclear power plants and

00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.340
technologies. Fusion researchers say projects
like General Fusion and ITER

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.290
need more investment from both public and
private sources in order to turn

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.980
nuclear fusion into a reality.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.090
And climate change activists say the
world needs to decarbonize, using the

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:45.590
resources we have now,
before it's too late.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:51.260
We need to turn to fission, turn
to solar, turn to wind, turn to

00:20:51.260 --> 00:20:53.470
geothermal, turn to hydroelectric.

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.360
Do whatever we can to get
off of the carbon addiction.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.640
Then, if the research and investment comes
to bear, we can turn to fusion

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:03.690
to support our
rapidly growing population.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.750
I think fusion is
actually an inevitable thing.

00:21:06.830 --> 00:21:08.200
I think we will solve this problem.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:10.300
The key is to get it
there as fast as possible.

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:13.960
How soon we'll reach this fusion-powered
future remains up for debate.

00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:19.620
The first demonstration will happen in
about 10 years, I would think.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:24.310
By 2060 or 2070, the world is
likely to be largely powered by fusion.

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:28.330
Near the turn of the century, or
maybe even a little bit beyond that.

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.080
I think if the human race is still
around in the year 2500 and we look

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:35.000
back, I would wager that
fusion plants will be there.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.370
However, these estimated timeframes may
rely heavily on how much

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.570
government decides to invest
in fusion power.

00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:43.990
I think the question
is political will.

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:48.580
To what extent are our governments
willing to spend the money to

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.000
investigate these things?

00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:54.220
At this present rate and at this present
level of will, I don't see it

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:58.470
happening. If you were to ask me,
"What is the most challenging thing

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:03.880
about fusion?", I would not say holding
some hot gas at 150 million

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.480
degrees Celsius. I actually
think it's our mentality.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:12.220
We don't think 5, 7,
12 generations down the road.

00:22:12.570 --> 00:22:18.830
A more realistic plan, a portfolio,
is probably to concentrate on various

00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:23.050
renewables and work on
improving standard fission.

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.830
Where there's a will, there's a way.

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.780
And through the process of building a
machine like ITER, as well as

00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:32.130
building a machine like NIF, as well
as building a machine like General

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:37.280
Fusion, we learn so that we can
then apply that to the next time.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:39.910
Yeah, it goes beyond our generation.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.610
But sorry, I don't use
that as an excuse.
