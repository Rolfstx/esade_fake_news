THIS IS NOT ONLY IS IT THE NAME

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:01.521
OF YOUR BOOK, BUT IT ALSO-- IT'S
AN INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO READ A

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:05.024 align:start position:0%
BOOK.

00:02:05.057 --> 00:02:06.292

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:11.430 align:start position:0%
BUT--
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN, IT WILL TAKE YOU TEN

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:12.331 align:start position:0%
MINUTES.

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:12.965

00:02:16.468 --> 00:02:22.308 align:start position:0%
WHAT MESSAGE DO YOU WANT KIDS TO

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:23.843
&gt;&gt; WELL, MY SUCCESS IN LIFE HAS
HAPPENED BECAUSE OF WORDS AND

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.329 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T.

00:02:43.362 --> 00:02:44.197
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THEY MUST GIVE YOU
SOME SORT OF SUPERPOWERS WHEN

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.830 align:start position:0%

SUPREME COURT.

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:46.299 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT IS LEGALESE IF
I EVER HEARD IT.

00:05:24.423 --> 00:05:25.491 align:start position:0%
COME ON, THAT'S NEVER GOING TO
HOLD UP IN A COURT.

00:05:25.524 --> 00:05:26.258 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHY NOT?

00:05:26.292 --> 00:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GET A LAWYER IN
HERE.

00:05:27.092 --> 00:05:28.394 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WHY NOT?

00:05:28.427 --> 00:05:29.495 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YOU'RE-- YOU'RE
RUNNING-- YOU'RE RUNNING A

00:05:29.528 --> 00:05:31.197 align:start position:0%
GAMBLING DEN.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:32.231 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY NOT.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:33.532 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HOW DO WE KNOW THAT
YOU'RE IN CHARGE?

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:34.633 align:start position:0%
I'D LIKE TO SEE SOME RECEIPTS,
PLEASE.

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:40.139 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S EASY FOR ME TO
GIVE YOU.

00:05:40.172 --> 00:05:41.374 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, STEALING
QUARTERS TO FEED YOUR GAMBLING

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:41.941 align:start position:0%
PROBLEM.

00:05:41.974 --> 00:05:43.075 align:start position:0%
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:44.944 size:88% position:44%
YOU SPEND A LOT OF YOUR DAY
MAKING BIG CALLS, ALL RIGHT?

00:05:44.977 --> 00:05:46.212
THERE'S NO BIGGER CALLS THAN
DECIDING WHAT THE CONSTITUTION

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:49.582 align:start position:0%
WILL ALLOW.

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:52.485 align:start position:0%
I'D LIKE YOU TO USE YOUR
JUDICIAL ACUMEN RIGHT NOW TO

00:05:52.518 --> 00:05:53.886 align:start position:0%
MAKE SOME VERY QUICK, VERY SMALL
CALLS.

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OKAY.

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:02.695 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR,
DO ALL DOGS GO TO HEAVEN?

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:08.200 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:13.205
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS IT OKAY TO TALK
A PENNY IF YOU NEVER LEAVE A

00:06:13.238 --> 00:06:13.472 align:start position:0%
PENNY?

00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:14.439 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:06:14.473 --> 00:06:14.706 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS IT EVER OKAY TO
MICROWAVE FISH?

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:15.941 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NO.

00:06:15.974 --> 00:06:16.509 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IF THERE'S SOMETHING
STRANGE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD,

00:06:16.542 --> 00:06:17.710 align:start position:0%
WHO YOU GONNA CALL?

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:19.211 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IF THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD--

00:06:19.244 --> 00:06:25.017 size:78% position:39%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.218 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU MEAN "STRANGE" BY
DANGEROUS FOR MYSELF OR OTHERS,

00:06:26.251 --> 00:06:27.286 align:start position:0%
I WOULD CALL--
&gt;&gt; Stephen: POSSIBLY.

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:28.287 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THE POLICE.

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:29.288 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: POSSIBLY, BUT WHAT
IF IT WAS SPOOKY?

00:06:29.321 --> 00:06:30.923 align:start position:0%
WHAT IF IT WAS SOMETHING SPOOKY
OR OTHERWORLDLY?

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:32.658 align:start position:0%
SOMETHING STRANGE IN YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD.

00:06:32.691 --> 00:06:37.296 align:start position:0%
WHO YOU GONNA CALL?

00:06:37.329 --> 00:06:39.265 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THAT DIDN'T POSE ME AN-- POSE
ANY DANGER TO ME.

00:06:39.298 --> 00:06:40.699 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IT COULD POSE A
DANGER TO YOU IF--

00:06:40.732 --> 00:06:42.368 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEN I STILL MIGHT CALL THE
POLICE.

00:06:42.401 --> 00:06:44.570
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY, WHAT IF THE
POLICE COULDN'T HANDLE THIS

00:06:44.603 --> 00:06:47.239 align:start position:0%
PARTICULAR DANGER?

00:06:47.272 --> 00:06:49.241 align:start position:0%
PERHAPS IF IT WAS AN ETHEREAL OR
SPIRITUAL DANGER?

00:06:49.274 --> 00:06:55.981 align:start position:0%
PERHAPS THERE WERE--
&gt;&gt; AHHH.

00:06:56.014 --> 00:06:56.581 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GHOSTS.

00:06:56.615 --> 00:06:57.416 size:78% position:39%
WHO-- WHO YOU GONNA CALL?

00:06:57.449 --> 00:06:58.050 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S A FASCINATING
QUESTION.

00:06:58.083 --> 00:06:58.850 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ALL OF MINE ARE.

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:03.889 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; AND THE-- AND MOST OF THEM
ARE--

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:08.327 align:start position:0%
WHO WOULD I CALL?

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.029
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHO WOULD YOU CALL?

00:07:10.062 --> 00:07:10.863 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I'D GO GET THE POLICE
FOR SURE.

00:07:10.896 --> 00:07:11.597 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: JUDGES?

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.198 align:start position:0%
OH, YOU'RE THE JUDGE.

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.366 align:start position:0%
I'M SORRY.

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.634
WE ALREADY HAVE A RULING FROM
ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES, RUTH

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:16.101
BADER GINSBURG, ON THIS, PERHAPS
ONE OF THE MOST DIVISIVE ISSUES

00:07:16.134 --> 00:07:28.214 align:start position:0%
IN AMERICA TODAY.

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:29.582
BUT I WANT TO POSE IT TO YOU TO
SEE IF WE HAVE A CONCURRENCE.

00:07:29.615 --> 00:07:31.183 align:start position:0%
JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR, IS A HOT DOG
A SANDWICH?

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:32.518
&gt;&gt; THIS IS NOT FAIR, 'CAUSE I
WATCHED HER INTERVIEW WITH YOU.

00:07:32.551 --> 00:07:34.286 align:start position:0%
AND SHE ASKED--
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, I MEAN, SURELY

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.921 align:start position:0%
YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE'S ORAL
ARGUMENTS.

00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:37.490 align:start position:0%
PERHAPS-- PERHAPS YOU CAN RENDER
YOUR OWN JUDGMENTS.

00:07:37.523 --> 00:07:39.425 align:start position:0%
OR ARE YOU SO INFLUENCED BY RUTH
BADER GINSBURG THAT YOU CAN'T

00:07:39.458 --> 00:07:41.927
HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION, MADAME
JUSTICE, AS NO ONE CALLS YOU?

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.063 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I CAN APPROACH THE
PROBLEM IN A DIFFERENT WAY THAN

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:44.964 align:start position:0%
SHE DID.

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:46.165 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: ALL RIGHT.

00:07:46.198 --> 00:07:52.738
&gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT, MY DEFINITION OF
SANDWICH IS SOMETHING BETWEEN

00:07:52.771 --> 00:07:57.042 align:start position:0%
TWO PARTS OF A BREAD, OR TWO
SLICES OF A BREAD.

00:07:57.075 --> 00:08:03.916
AND UNDER THAT DEFINITION, A HOT
DOG CAN BE, BECAUSE WHETHER THE

00:08:03.949 --> 00:08:05.417 align:start position:0%
BREADS ARE TIED TOGETHER OR NOT
IS IRRELEVANT.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.586
SO I WOULD ANSWER YES, UNDER
THOSE-- UNDER THAT DEFINITION.

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:13.826
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO YOU'RE WILLING
TO SAY HOT DOG IS A SANDWICH.

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; AND, BY THE WAY, I LOVE HOT
DOGS.

00:08:15.094 --> 00:08:16.161
&gt;&gt; Stephen: JUSTICE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR TALKING TO ME TODAY.

00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:16.495 align:start position:0%
CHEERS.

00:08:16.528 --> 00:08:24.637 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SALUD.

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:34.079 align:start position:0%

&gt;&gt; Stephen: ROOM TEMPERATURE.

00:08:34.112 --> 00:08:38.050 align:start position:0%
<i> (  LAUGHTER  )</i>
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BOTH HER BOOKS ARE

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:38.717 align:start position:0%
AVAILABLE NOW.

00:08:38.751 --> 00:08:39.818
THANK YOU, JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR!

00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:43.856 align:start position:0%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET!
