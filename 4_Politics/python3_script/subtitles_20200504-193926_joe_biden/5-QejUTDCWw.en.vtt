00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.090
What you’re about to watch is a Nebula original
meaning it was first released on Nebula—the

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.709
streaming site founded by myself and plenty
of other creators.

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.691
Producing this documentary was an enormous
project which involved flying myself and a

00:00:13.691 --> 00:00:19.400
crew 10,000 miles to one of the most remote
places on earth, and it was entirely funded

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.990
by Curiosity Stream.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.510
That’s because Curiosity Stream has partnered
with Nebula to offer a bundle deal where,

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.560
if you sign up at CuriosityStream.com/Wendover,
you also get a Nebula subscription—easy

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.070
as that.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.149
On there you’ll find loads of other great
originals by independent creators, but for

00:00:36.149 --> 00:01:18.680
now, to the documentary.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.680
It was this precise moment, early on a Saturday
afternoon in October, 2017, that changed the

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.070
course of history for one of the world’s
most remote societies.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.380
This moment that ended 500 years of isolation
from the world—cutting travel time to there

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.400
from six days on a boat to six hours on a
plane.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.460
It was this small moment that changed everything
for the island—an island where the thing

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.330
they need most of all, as much as it might
hurt, is change.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.140
It was this moment that long in the future
will be recognized as the single most consequential

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.240
ever for the island of St Helena.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.230
You’d be forgiven for not knowing exactly
what or where St Helena is.

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.300
It’s not a place that one hears a whole
lot about.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.990
If you have heard of it, that’s likely thanks
to Napoleon.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.840
It’s here, on St Helena, where the infamous
Emperor of France was exiled by the British

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.960
for the six years preceding his death.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.810
Since then, though, the island has been up
to quite a bit.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.040
It’s now home to about 4,500 of the friendliest
people you’ll ever meet.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.660
Walking a block through its capital of Jamestown,
it’s tough to go without saying hi and hello

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.450
a half-dozen times.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.670
Driving past someone without giving a wave—well,
that's practically a crime.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.760
Saints, as its residents are called, are as
proudly British as the come and fly their

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.130
Union Jacks copiously and conspicuously.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.920
The island is, after all, a British Overseas
Territory.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.000
Life on St Helena is quite unlike life in
the UK, though.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.181
They’ve got their own money, their own accents,
their own culture, their own government, but

00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:55.060
most of all, what makes life on St Helena
different is where it is.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.850
The island sits in the same neighborhood as
nothing.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.010
Mainland Africa is 1,100 miles or 1,800 kilometers
to its east.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.550
Mainland South America is about 2,000 miles
or 3,300 kilometers to its west.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.840
London is over 4,600 miles or 7,500 kilometers
to its north.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.099
St Helena’s isolation defines and shapes
it, in absolutely every way—including, perhaps

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:21.750
most consequentially, economically.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.300
You see, St Helena is not a wealthy place.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.510
Its GDP per capita averages just above $12,000,
compared to about $40,000 in the UK.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.430
The issue is that getting people and things
to and from the middle of nowhere costs a

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.580
great deal, so there just aren't too many
industries that can profitably operate on

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.020
a place as tiny and isolated as St Helena.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.370
The Saints have found a few, though.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.750
Beyond the traditional goods and services
sectors that any small community would have,

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.489
St Helena does have exports.

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:01.270
“We have some of the rarest coffee in the
world which sells for, I know, 90, 100 GBP

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.280
in the United Kingdom for just 100 grams.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.140
If we could increase that to some extent,
that would bring revenue to many of the farmers

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.140
on the island.”

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.340
They also sell a good amount of tuna and honey,
but then there’s another sector that capitalizes

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.970
on the islands isolation.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:26.890
“The predominant economy here at the moment
is there is niche tourism--diving, history,

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:32.190
walking tours, birdwatching, those sorts of
things--plus also a growing market of people

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.410
who want to get away from it all.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.760
One week away from the Internet and given
the Internet prices here and that's quite

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.770
easy to achieve if you want to do it.”

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.020
But tourism would be nothing without a means
to get off and on to St Helena Island.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.430
It was only recently that this became something
that the government had to worry about.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.250
In the early days of the island’s human
history, shipping was what brought a population

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.970
to it.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.889
It was the perfect stopping point on the route
from the far east to Europe around the Cape

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.169
of Good Hope—so perfect, in fact, that for
a while the entire island was run by the British

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.470
East India Company.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.840
Eventually, though, the Suez canal opened
and so fewer boats would round the southern

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.330
tip of Africa.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.780
This, of course, diminished St Helena’s
importance, but still, up until the 1970’s,

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.889
the island served as a regular stopping point
for ocean liners traveling between the UK

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.990
and South Africa, meaning there was reliable
link to the outside world.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:31.540
But then, throughout the 20th century, as
air travel grew more popular and profitable,

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:36.740
passenger ocean lines around the world increasingly
struggled to fill their ships and one-by-one

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.620
closed down.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.280
The last shipping line with passenger service
to St Helena collapsed in 1977, leaving the

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.730
island marooned—with no way to get to the
outside world.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.370
The British stepped in, buying a ship for
their overseas territory which would be called

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.610
the RMS St Helena.

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.050
The RMS was part cargo ship, part passenger
ship.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.910
In the front she carried dozens of shipping
containers, acting as the primary supply-line

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.270
for the island, and in the back she was adorned
with pools and bars and sun loungers.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.620
Her regular journey consisted of the five
nights from Cape Town to St Helena, then she

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.199
would continue on to Ascension Island, in
two or three nights, where she would meet

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:19.230
and connect her passengers to one of the bi-weekly
Royal Air Force flights to the UK.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:24.650
This method, via Ascension, allowed travelers
to get from the UK to St Helena in relative

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.240
speed—just four days.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.509
Most, though, took the longer route from South
Africa.

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.949
Locals and tourists alike adored the RMS.

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.850
She was thought of as the perfect transition
from St Helena to the outside world or vice

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:39.850
versa.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.960
She was a legendary, storied vessel, but,
after decades of heavy use shuttling passengers

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.539
to and from the island, in the early 2000’s,
the RMS was getting old and worn and the government

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:53.669
started to think about what would replace
her.

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:58.830
Initial assessments found that replacing the
ship would cost up to $100 million.

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.110
This led to the question: with that kind of
money, was a ship really the best option?

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.729
The answer, it turned out, was probably not.

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.801
After decades of feasibility studies, discussions,
debates, false starts, delays, and bidding,

00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:19.150
a contract was produced, and with a few quick
signatures, life on St Helena would change

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.150
forever.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:22.660
St Helena was getting an airport.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:28.699
“The contract was signed in November 2011,
and that's when Basil Read arrived on the

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:32.370
island to start basically looking at the infrastructure
logistics.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:38.861
They started the first construction or the
first moving of soil.”

00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:44.550
“And obviously they built various roads
up to the airport because they had to get

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.690
the logistics up to the airport.

00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:52.150
That was they had a ship that brought in all
the materials, logistics, all the spares,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:55.190
equipment that had to obviously help to build
an airport.

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.889
So they constructed it over four years.

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:04.330
At the end of 2015, the runway was completed,
most of the terminal buildings were completed

00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:09.920
most of CNS equipment, which is communication
and navigation equipment, was installed and

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.600
the airport was ready for a certification
at the end of October 2015.”

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.490
New airports are rare.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.250
New airports in places that have never had
an airport before are even rarer.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:26.680
Getting an empty husk of an airport certified
and staffed is no easy task.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.389
For this to happen on St Helena, subcontractors
were streaming through the island; there were

00:08:31.389 --> 00:08:36.169
audits upon audits upon audits; staff members
were recruited; locals were trained both on

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:40.289
and off island for jobs like security, immigration,
firefighting, and more; emergency procedures

00:08:40.289 --> 00:08:44.540
were written; public meetings were conducted,
airport vehicles were shipped in; instruments

00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:49.170
were calibrated; beacons and localizers and
obstacle lights were installed; a logo was

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:54.680
designed; calibration flights came in; emergency
drills were conducted; drone laws were codified;

00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:00.230
operational trials were run; and then finally,
in February, 2016, the airport was certified

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:02.110
and ready to open.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:06.510
Commercial flights could start, and St Helena
would achieve its decades long ambition of

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.089
having an air link to the outside world.

00:09:10.089 --> 00:09:12.370
There was just one more step.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:17.040
As one last hurdle of bureaucracy, Comair,
the airline contracted to operate flights

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.250
to St Helena, wanted to perform an implementation
flight, as they called it.

00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:25.430
Essentially, they were to going to fly one
of their planes in to test that everything,

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:29.839
from the instruments to the runway to the
terminal to the fuel system, worked.

00:09:29.839 --> 00:09:34.580
Now, Comair was really the perfect airline
to connect St Helena to the world.

00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:39.279
They’re a British Airways franchisee meaning
they are contracted by British Airways to

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:43.680
operate their regional flights from South
Africa, and therefore fly a number of routes

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.650
around the region under the British Airways
brand.

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:51.540
The plan was for Comair to operate a British
Airways route nonstop from Johannesburg to

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.670
St Helena.

00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:56.860
These flights would seamlessly connect to
other British Airways flights to the two locations

00:09:56.860 --> 00:10:02.459
Saints travel most, Cape Town and London,
as well as with hundreds of other destinations

00:10:02.459 --> 00:10:03.839
around the world.

00:10:03.839 --> 00:10:08.230
With the exception of a direct flight to the
UK, there’s really nothing better St Helena

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:09.510
airport could have wished for.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.640
They just had to do the implementation flight.

00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:19.410
So, on one sunny, nearly cloudless April day
in 2016, a Comair 737 appeared off in the

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.400
distance to the north of St Helena airport
carrying a handful of staff members of the

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:25.820
airline and airport construction company.

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:30.990
It approached, wheels up, in order to perform
a fly-by above the runway, as planned.

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:35.190
After gaining altitude again, it circled back
around in order to make a second and final

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.890
approach.

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:44.450
But then, just seconds away from touchdown,
there was a sort of wobble, then another one,

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:49.050
then once its wheels were just feet above
the runway, the pilots elected to abort the

00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:52.200
landing, go around, and give it another shot.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:57.940
So, the plane circled around again, and, after
some more wobbling, came to a landing—the

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.550
first ever landing of a commercial passenger
jet on the island, even if it wasn’t carrying

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.220
commercial passengers.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.820
St Helena was thrilled.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:11.019
“I’m here with Basil Read’s island director,
Deon De Jager.

00:11:11.019 --> 00:11:15.279
Deon, you just arrived on the first passenger
jet to land here on St Helena.

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.520
Can you describe the experience?

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.060
Uh, great experience.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:24.290
I mean it’s just the cherry on the cake
after the four years work.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:29.170
Friday morning I flew out, on the SA flight,
I went home, spent the weekend with the family,

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:32.400
played golf yesterday, and today I’m back
on the island.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.850
I meant that’s the signs of the times and
that’s the whole reason for the airport

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.360
is to be able to travel back and forth as
you please.”

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.221
“Susan O’Bey and Graham Vest, guys, you
were here to witness the first ever passenger

00:11:46.221 --> 00:11:47.650
jet land on St Helena.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.650
First of all, you, Graham.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:49.710
How does it feel?

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.520
Can you describe the experience?

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:57.320
It was absolutely amazing and I feel really
privileged to be here at this momentous occasion.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:59.330
It really is such a historic event.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:01.390
I feel absolutely wonderful.

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:06.209
I feel proud by everything that’s being
done by you guys on the island.

00:12:06.209 --> 00:12:08.350
And you Susan?

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:09.950
Excited, extremely excited.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:17.649
This is like the culmination of weeks, months,
years of hard work as far back as 2005 and

00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:20.940
we’re really, really proud of everything
that’s been achieved today.”

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:22.130
“This is the first step.

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.150
You know, a plane landing on St Helena.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.300
What does this now mean for tourism on St
Helena.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.560
Well now we’ve got the gateway to get people
here.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.750
Before we had to rely on the ship, the RMS,
coming back and forwards.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.399
This means we can have a steady stream.

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:39.710
At first it’ll be that Saturday flight,
people will get used to and then once that

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.420
starts filling up hopefully we’ll have a
mid-week one and that’s the way we can really

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:47.899
develop tourism and it becomes worth people
investing in—restaurants, bars, other things

00:12:47.899 --> 00:12:49.350
that will help the tourists here.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.110
So, the start of a new era for St Helena.”

00:12:52.110 --> 00:12:58.019
Everyone was ecstatic, but at the time, none
fully understood what had just happened.

00:12:58.019 --> 00:13:05.820
You see, this little wobble, just before landing,
had just derailed the decades-long plan for

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:09.010
St Helena’s new era.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:14.310
That wobble was evidence of wind-shear—a
phenomenon where wind traveling in one direction

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:19.670
meets wind traveling in another direction
and creates a zone of turbulent air.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:23.680
In St Helena’s case, its wind shear was
due to the already strong wind being pushed

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.340
around and rerouted by the enormous cliffs
at the northern end of its runway.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:33.589
When coming in to land an airplane, wind is
already a hassle, but when it quickly shifts,

00:13:33.589 --> 00:13:38.510
as in the case of wind shear, it can be a
lot worse.

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:42.450
The first sign to the general public that
something was wrong was when the St Helena

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.260
Government postponed the long-scheduled airport
opening ceremony, which was planned to be

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.480
presided upon by Prince Andrew.

00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.899
Eventually, it emerged that the solution would
be to land planes from the south as there

00:13:52.899 --> 00:13:58.839
was not a wind-shear issue from this direction,
but this did have its own issues.

00:13:58.839 --> 00:14:03.279
Planes generally like to land into the wind
as this allows them to stop faster on the

00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:07.790
runway, but at the airport, wind almost always
comes from the south meaning planes would

00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:09.780
be landing with a tail-wind.

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.550
In order to successfully land a 737 with a
tail-wind on the length of runway offered

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.149
at St Helena, the 737 would have to be quite
light.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:22.730
It wouldn’t be able to take its full capacity
of passengers or cargo.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:27.519
In fact, it would have to shed so much weight
that the flights would never be commercially

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:33.209
profitable for Comair, even with the planned
subsidies, and so, unceremoniously, it was

00:14:33.209 --> 00:14:38.040
announced that Comair, and therefore British
Airways, would not be running the flights

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.800
to St Helena.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.750
Eventually, the story of St Helena Airport
reached the world.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:47.339
The British tabloids got their hands on it
and ripped it to shreds.

00:14:47.339 --> 00:14:52.600
They called the airport, “embarrassing,”
a “gaffe,” a “folly,” a “farcical

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.060
vanity project.”

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:57.120
Much of what was reported wasn’t even accurate.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.110
Tabloids said it was impossible to land, they
said the airport was closed, neither of which

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.110
was true.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:06.440
In fact, throughout the delay, private and
medevac flights were coming in and out with

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.540
no problem.

00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:12.500
The media latched on to the video of that
Comair Implementation flight and, as one outlet

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.230
called it, the, “terrifying three attempts
it took to land.”

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:21.870
In reality, it was one planned fly-by, one
aborted landing, and one successful landing.

00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:26.330
In the world of commercial aviation, aborted
landings are nothing exceptional.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:31.170
They happen many times a day at airports large
and small all around the world.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:36.080
Most of all, though, the common thread between
all the media reports was the nickname St

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:41.870
Helena Airport received: “the World’s
Most Useless Airport.”

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.640
That was the one that stung.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:49.930
“I think a lot of those sort of initial
label given by the popular media has not helped

00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:50.930
the island.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.779
I think it's totally false, quite frankly.”

00:15:52.779 --> 00:15:57.480
“We knew that it was going to get a lot
of flack over it from the media.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:05.410
We didn't quite appreciate how much it was
going to feature, but it became a lot about

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.320
how bad the British government had done in
investing in this airport on St Helena and

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.040
putting it in the wrong place, essentially.”

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:16.810
“When the bad press hit of St Helena having
this white elephant for an airport, I was

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:23.800
really angry and still to today, in my professional
capacity, we are countering and battling to

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.899
get rid of that negativity.

00:16:26.899 --> 00:16:31.730
It is really bad and people doesn't want to
see the good that is actually happening.”

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:39.580
“Since all of those articles, we've had
to spend a lot of time, I suppose, trying

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:42.589
to sell the island for its positive aspects.”

00:16:42.589 --> 00:16:51.800
“But those things are harder to get through
than the sensationalist stuff that sells papers.”

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.720
“Well, you always have starting out problems,
and what would you expect?

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.140
We are in the middle of the South Atlantic.

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.709
This is the first time for it to happen.

00:17:00.709 --> 00:17:05.769
So you gotta have trial and error and I wish
people would just leave the error now aside

00:17:05.769 --> 00:17:08.949
and look at what is happening as a result."

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:13.209
In order to shrug off that nickname, they
needed, of course, a flight.

00:17:13.209 --> 00:17:15.459
“ So we had to do a lot of research.

00:17:15.459 --> 00:17:20.699
So we commissioned our UK Met office to do
a lot of research on our wind data.

00:17:20.699 --> 00:17:25.489
So we collated a lot of wind data over six
months, twelve months so we could ascertain

00:17:25.489 --> 00:17:29.389
exactly what the conditions were on runway
20 and 02.

00:17:29.389 --> 00:17:33.970
Once we got all that thought into place, then
the secretary government went up with a new

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:39.889
tender looking for an aircraft that could
actually land runway 02, which had a 15 knot

00:17:39.889 --> 00:17:41.210
tail wind component.”

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.640
It was runway 20 that had the wind shear issue,
not runway 02.

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:50.239
These two are, in fact, the same physical
runway, but runway 20 refers to the landing

00:17:50.239 --> 00:17:54.539
coming from the north, runaway 02 refers to
the landing from the south.

00:17:54.539 --> 00:17:59.179
The prevailing winds originate from the south,
so the key to a safe landing was an aircraft

00:17:59.179 --> 00:18:04.179
small enough to stop safely within the length
of the runway even when wind pushes it from

00:18:04.179 --> 00:18:05.460
behind.

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:10.669
That way, if the wind shear from the north
is too bad, it can land from the south.

00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:13.659
The service was not to be subsidized, but
rather underwritten.

00:18:13.659 --> 00:18:17.120
“There isn't a subsidy per passenger.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.509
So SA Airlink, who fly here, they don't get
paid, let's say 10 pounds per passenger per

00:18:21.509 --> 00:18:23.049
flight at all.

00:18:23.049 --> 00:18:28.889
It's very much a commercial service, but if
that commercial service makes a loss, that

00:18:28.889 --> 00:18:33.620
loss is underwritten by DFID in the UK.”

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.479
Two main bidders emerged to operate the flights
to St Helena.

00:18:37.479 --> 00:18:40.879
The first was a company called Atlantic Star
Airlines.

00:18:40.879 --> 00:18:46.649
Founded in 2012—still the early days of
the airport construction process—Atlantic

00:18:46.649 --> 00:18:51.330
Star was created specifically to serve as
an airline for St Helena.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:55.580
Their original plan was to make weekly flights
directly from London to St Helena via some

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.499
midway refueling stop in addition to a weekly
flight to Cape Town.

00:18:59.499 --> 00:19:03.019
It was an ambitious plan, but they were serious
about it.

00:19:03.019 --> 00:19:07.609
The company consisted of seasoned aviation
executives and professionals including a CEO

00:19:07.609 --> 00:19:09.679
who came from British Airways.

00:19:09.679 --> 00:19:13.379
Over time, though, the plan was scaled back
to operating a few charter flights a year

00:19:13.379 --> 00:19:16.629
from London to St Helena via Banjul, in The
Gambia.

00:19:16.629 --> 00:19:18.879
This was going to happen.

00:19:18.879 --> 00:19:23.460
They had an agreement with TUI airlines to
charter a 737, they had announced schedules,

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:28.899
they had set fares, but then, of course, the
airport’s opening was delayed, and these

00:19:28.899 --> 00:19:32.159
flights were all cancelled.

00:19:32.159 --> 00:19:36.889
After some time, in October, 2016, Atlantic
Star came back into the story by chartering

00:19:36.889 --> 00:19:42.299
an Avro RJ1000 to fly to the island and run
a series of test landings—a move the company

00:19:42.299 --> 00:19:46.159
tried to use as evidence of their legitimacy
in the bidding process.

00:19:46.159 --> 00:19:50.919
The proposal was that they would lease an
Avro jet to be based on St Helena as the island’s

00:19:50.919 --> 00:19:51.919
dedicated aircraft.

00:19:51.919 --> 00:19:56.210
Twice a week, they would fly the hour and
a half north to Ascension Island to connect

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.499
with the bi-weekly RAF flights to the UK.

00:19:59.499 --> 00:20:04.019
Having the aircraft based on St Helena would,
according to their bid, be quite the benefit

00:20:04.019 --> 00:20:08.440
for the island considering that it could,
at a moment’s notice, fly medical evacuation

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.979
flights, rather than waiting for a plane to
fly in from South Africa to pick a patient

00:20:11.979 --> 00:20:12.979
up.

00:20:12.979 --> 00:20:15.299
Ultimately, though, the bid failed.

00:20:15.299 --> 00:20:19.729
The other major bid submitted to the St Helena
government was by a South African Airline

00:20:19.729 --> 00:20:21.669
called Airlink.

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:27.359
Their plan was to fly an Embraer E190 jet
to St Helena once-weekly on Saturdays.

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:30.970
The aircraft would fly from Johannesburg to
Windhoek, Namibia, where it would meet another

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.020
service coming in from Cape Town.

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:37.479
This connecting structure was viewed as quite
important since, while much of the Saint diaspora

00:20:37.479 --> 00:20:42.450
is in Cape Town, Johannesburg is the larger
airport and offers more connections.

00:20:42.450 --> 00:20:47.379
From Windhoek, it would then fly the three
hours over the South Atlantic to land in St

00:20:47.379 --> 00:20:48.379
Helena.

00:20:48.379 --> 00:20:50.609
It would then do the same in reverse.

00:20:50.609 --> 00:20:54.409
Included in Airlink’s bid was an agreement
to operate once-monthly charter flights from

00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:58.659
St Helena to Ascension Island as an add-on
to their flight from Johannesburg, giving

00:20:58.659 --> 00:21:04.149
that island, which primarily serves as a military
base for the UK and US, its only regularly-scheduled,

00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:06.590
non-military flight to the outside world.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:10.559
This bid was as close to perfect St Helena
was going to get.

00:21:10.559 --> 00:21:15.730
On July 21st, 2017, the St Helena Government
signed a contract with Airlink and announced

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:20.210
to the world that this tiny, south-Atlantic
outpost was finally getting its connection

00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:21.600
to the world.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.179
St Helena was getting a flight, for real this
time.

00:21:25.179 --> 00:21:29.639
A few months later, just over a year after
that Comair flight had arrived in the skies

00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:33.999
above St Helena, an Airlink Embraer E190 did
the same.

00:21:33.999 --> 00:21:38.890
It was filled with 70 or so journalists, tourists,
and Saints, and soon enough, safely touched

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:43.730
down and was greeted by, well, a big proportion
of St Helena.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:47.070
That was St Helena’s before and after moment.

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:51.970
Once those wheels touched down, St Helena
would never be the same.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:57.190
But once that happened, once the honeymoon
period was over, it was time for St Helena

00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:59.270
to get to work.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.299
Realizing the full potential of the airport
was no easy task.

00:22:03.299 --> 00:22:07.419
Of course the natural environment presented
its own issues, but the true challenge lies

00:22:07.419 --> 00:22:11.659
in the island’s geographic isolation and
political independence, which mean that, in

00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:15.169
all aspects, the airport has to be entirely
self-sufficient.

00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:20.739
They’re not run by some big company, they’re
not part of any national system.

00:22:20.739 --> 00:22:26.299
St Helena Airport is run by St Helena Airport
Limited and, if Gwyneth Howell, its CEO, doesn’t

00:22:26.299 --> 00:22:30.679
know what to do, there’s not really anyone
she can call.

00:22:30.679 --> 00:22:35.370
That means that everything needed to run St
Helena Airport, from administrative to operational,

00:22:35.370 --> 00:22:38.599
has to happen at St Helena Airport.

00:22:38.599 --> 00:22:42.769
It turns out that, even with just one weekly
flight, that’s quite a lot.

00:22:42.769 --> 00:22:47.929
“So, what we have, for example, is in this
room here we have what’s called CNS—so

00:22:47.929 --> 00:22:50.200
communications, navigations, and surveillance.

00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:55.619
So, we have two guys, one who works on the
IT side of things, one who works on the navigation

00:22:55.619 --> 00:23:00.440
aids, and so on, and they’re really crucial
to the running of the airport, you know.

00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:06.200
Without the communications and navigation
systems, without those IT systems in place,

00:23:06.200 --> 00:23:12.230
we wouldn’t be able to land aircraft and
take off aircraft to the airport so that’s

00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:13.830
extremely important.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:19.419
CEO’s office—obviously we need a Chief
Executive Officer for St Helena Airport LTD—and

00:23:19.419 --> 00:23:21.499
then there’s my office next door.

00:23:21.499 --> 00:23:28.649
I’m kind of the CEO’s right hand person
so I will always be there to support them

00:23:28.649 --> 00:23:35.820
but I’m also kind of separate as well as
I’m meant to be there to be the conscience

00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.440
of the company.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.090
To do the thinking, to do the questioning—why
are we doing it like that, could we do it

00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:44.850
another way, could we do it a safer way, could
we do it a better way.

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:46.139
That’s a pretty important role.”

00:23:46.139 --> 00:23:51.541
“So if we carry on this way, actually, this
is an important room to look in.

00:23:51.541 --> 00:23:58.879
It’s the gym and it’s where our FS team
keep fit.

00:23:58.879 --> 00:24:04.789
Being in the firefighting service, it’s
a very physical job so you need to be fit

00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:09.840
all the time and, in fact, there are fitness
levels to be met so the gym is an important

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.710
part of that.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.480
Hello, Bill.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:18.830
Security and because I’m not security cleared
I’m not allowed to go in there even though

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:24.729
I’m, sort of, senior management team there
are still levels of security that some of

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:28.929
us can’t get in to and this is one where
I’m not permitted to go in to, and rightly

00:24:28.929 --> 00:24:29.929
so.”

00:24:29.929 --> 00:24:33.779
“So if you want to follow me down into the
rest of the combined building.

00:24:33.779 --> 00:24:36.719
So, we have a training room.

00:24:36.719 --> 00:24:40.090
There’s an awful lot of training that goes
on for staff.

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:45.299
We need to be accredited in many respects
so there’s a lot of training that goes on—security,

00:24:45.299 --> 00:24:51.149
in particular, but also in firefighting as
well—so there’s our training room.

00:24:51.149 --> 00:24:59.179
Walking on further down, we also have a maintenance
bay, as well, which I’ll briefly open the

00:24:59.179 --> 00:25:03.679
door to and walk in.

00:25:03.679 --> 00:25:09.990
So, the maintenance bay is where we obviously
maintain equipment.

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:14.741
We have a lot of equipment to maintain and
we have an on-site mechanic who does so.

00:25:14.741 --> 00:25:17.269
So we also use it for storage as well.

00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:27.320
So this, for example, is a tow-barless tug
which allows us to tow aircraft if we need

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:32.989
to and other bits of pieces like the toilet
cart and so on.

00:25:32.989 --> 00:25:39.070
So it’s a multi-purpose bay so we use it
for storage and we use it for maintaining

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.320
our vehicles.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:50.059
So, moving along, finally we come to the end,
and it’s the most important room in the

00:25:50.059 --> 00:25:53.600
building because these are the people who
make sure we get paid.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:26:02.119
So, here we have—good afternoon—we have
HR and finance.

00:26:02.119 --> 00:26:11.119
Extremely important to running a small but
compact airport, but nevertheless, there’s

00:26:11.119 --> 00:26:15.499
all the HR and the financial functions that
go with that.”

00:26:15.499 --> 00:26:19.580
In addition to all the administrative functions,
St Helena Airport, while it might need less

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:24.450
of it, needs all the same things that an enormous
airport like Heathrow would need.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.389
A striking example of this is the fire service.

00:26:27.389 --> 00:26:31.809
“ICAO regulation basically states that every
airport has to have some sort of firefighting

00:26:31.809 --> 00:26:37.479
category, it really depends on the movement
of the aircraft within the airfield.

00:26:37.479 --> 00:26:40.940
That is regulation and that is what we have
to provide.”

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.450
“We are always on standby so if there’s
an aircraft emergency right now and we get

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:50.289
the crash alarms going, we can provide a three
minute response to the runway.”

00:26:50.289 --> 00:26:54.419
That’s despite the fact that most days,
there isn’t a single aircraft within hundreds

00:26:54.419 --> 00:26:58.739
of miles of the island, but nonetheless, it’s
what’s required by regulation.

00:26:58.739 --> 00:27:03.729
In addition, even at an airport with thousands
of weekly flights, it’s not as if firefighters

00:27:03.729 --> 00:27:07.919
are responding to fires all that often, which
means that there’s no real reason for those

00:27:07.919 --> 00:27:10.989
airports to have more than one firefighting
crew.

00:27:10.989 --> 00:27:14.989
The result is that an airport like St Helena,
which has one or two commercial flights a

00:27:14.989 --> 00:27:19.299
week, needs firefighting capabilities pretty
similar to an airport like Heathrow, which

00:27:19.299 --> 00:27:20.299
has thousands.

00:27:20.299 --> 00:27:25.159
That’s part of what balloons the cost of
running such a small airport.

00:27:25.159 --> 00:27:29.509
Given the isolation of the island, weather
forecasting is another crucially important

00:27:29.509 --> 00:27:34.190
yet challenging part of what’s needed to
keep the weekly flight reliable and safe.

00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:39.239
The UK Met Office stations meteorologists
on St Helena on more-or-less yearly rotations.

00:27:39.239 --> 00:27:43.529
“Well, after a Saturday flight, so, I usually
have the Sunday and Monday off, so when I

00:27:43.529 --> 00:27:47.109
come in on Tuesday that’s when I first start
looking at what the weather is going to be

00:27:47.109 --> 00:27:50.009
like for the next flight date which is usually
the Saturday.

00:27:50.009 --> 00:27:55.889
As we get nearer to the time I start to do
more detailed forecasts for the airline.

00:27:55.889 --> 00:28:03.519
So, on a Friday I produce a detailed forecast
for their estimated time of arrival on Saturday

00:28:03.519 --> 00:28:09.969
and then I come in at 4:00 on the Saturday
morning and take that forecast and forward

00:28:09.969 --> 00:28:13.839
that to the flight operations.”

00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:17.649
The reason this is so important is so that
they know, when an aircraft is supposed to

00:28:17.649 --> 00:28:22.220
get to St Helena Airport, it’ll be able
to land at St Helena Airport.

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:28.559
“The main problem is, because of the remoteness
of the airfield, there are no nearby diversions

00:28:28.559 --> 00:28:33.839
so they can’t arrive here and spend two
hours circling and then divert to a nearby

00:28:33.839 --> 00:28:34.940
airport.

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:40.190
If they come here then they’ve got to be
99% convinced that they’re going to be able

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:48.159
to land, so I will be looking at, cloud base
and visibility is the main things that stop

00:28:48.159 --> 00:28:51.179
them from landing at St Helena.

00:28:51.179 --> 00:28:57.479
The reason being because of their restrictions
they have to be visual with the airfield before

00:28:57.479 --> 00:28:59.009
they can land.

00:28:59.009 --> 00:29:04.239
So if the cloud base is below 900 feet, then
they won’t be able to see the airfield before

00:29:04.239 --> 00:29:06.089
their decision point.”

00:29:06.089 --> 00:29:09.559
Assuming the airline has that required level
of confidence that the flight will be able

00:29:09.559 --> 00:29:14.339
to successfully land at St Helena, Airlink
will give it clearance to depart from Johannesburg

00:29:14.339 --> 00:29:16.409
at about 9 am local time.

00:29:16.409 --> 00:29:21.850
It’ll then make the two hour flight to Walvis
Bay, Namibia, a more or less regular flight.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:27.159
At Walvis Bay, they’ll refuel the aircraft’s
tanks, giving them about six-hours of flying

00:29:27.159 --> 00:29:30.820
time, but also at the stop, they have to once
again decide whether they’ll be able to

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.719
land at St Helena.

00:29:32.719 --> 00:29:37.779
This time, the level of confidence has to
be higher than it was even in Johannesburg,

00:29:37.779 --> 00:29:42.269
but assuming they are confident, the flight
will take off, climb to altitude, and begin

00:29:42.269 --> 00:29:47.619
its three-hour ocean crossing, but the decisions
still aren’t over.

00:29:47.619 --> 00:29:51.429
Throughout this crossing, the airline will
be continuously evaluating the conditions

00:29:51.429 --> 00:29:55.899
on the island to assure that they will be
able to land and, if they believe they can’t,

00:29:55.899 --> 00:29:58.639
they’ll turn back for Namibia.

00:29:58.639 --> 00:30:03.190
Assuming they continue on, eventually, they
will then approach the island, drop altitude,

00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:07.589
and connect by radio with the airport’s
air traffic controller, but then, even once

00:30:07.589 --> 00:30:12.809
there, if the cloud levels are too low or
the wind is too strong, the plane still won’t

00:30:12.809 --> 00:30:13.809
be able to land.

00:30:13.809 --> 00:30:18.570
“So when they get here and they’re not
able to land on the first attempt to land,

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:23.409
they will do a go-around, they will go into
a holding pattern, and they will wait for

00:30:23.409 --> 00:30:25.739
a few minutes.

00:30:25.739 --> 00:30:31.700
Based on what we have in terms of satellite
image for the weather, it could be ten minutes,

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:35.279
it could be five minutes, it could be as soon
as they go around, when they come back they

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:39.469
can see the runway, and then they’ll be
able to do a landing.”

00:30:39.469 --> 00:30:45.269
“So, in the unlikely event that successful
landing cannot be completed, then the aircraft

00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:46.349
will have to divert.”

00:30:46.349 --> 00:30:50.159
St Helena’s closest diversion point is Ascension
Island.

00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:55.039
It’s about an hour and a half flight north,
so this is likely where any flight would divert

00:30:55.039 --> 00:30:57.349
if landing at St Helena was not possible.

00:30:57.349 --> 00:31:01.389
There they have fuel and facilities so the
Airlink flight could give landing on St Helena

00:31:01.389 --> 00:31:03.489
another shot the day after.

00:31:03.489 --> 00:31:07.909
In the time that St Helena airport has been
open, no commercial flight has ever failed

00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:09.999
landing and had to divert.

00:31:09.999 --> 00:31:15.899
In fact, in the first 10 months of 2019, the
airport didn’t even have a single cancelled

00:31:15.899 --> 00:31:17.119
flight.

00:31:17.119 --> 00:31:22.740
Every Saturday, at about 1:15 pm, at Airlink
Embraer E190 has reliably pierced through

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:27.529
the clouds above St Helena’s airport, ready
to drop off another load of eager tourists

00:31:27.529 --> 00:31:30.149
and wistful locals.

00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:33.639
Saturdays at St Helena airport are an event.

00:31:33.639 --> 00:31:37.929
Despite its tiny size, people start arriving
at the building three to four hours in advance

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:38.929
of the flight.

00:31:38.929 --> 00:31:43.700
While the plane might only seat 96 people,
every flight sees a crowd far larger, as extended

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:48.039
families of every Saint arriving and leaving
seem to show up.

00:31:48.039 --> 00:31:52.379
Just for the flight day, there opens a bank
branch, a gift shop, a luggage wrapping business,

00:31:52.379 --> 00:31:54.809
a cafe, and a restaurant.

00:31:54.809 --> 00:31:58.489
Those not taking the flight will stand in
the check-in hall, looking to see who’s

00:31:58.489 --> 00:32:02.429
leaving, then make their way up to the restaurant
once the passengers pass through security.

00:32:02.429 --> 00:32:07.489
Then, as the time draws near, everyone packs
into the observation deck—far busier than

00:32:07.489 --> 00:32:11.919
that of any of the world’s largest airports—and
look to the left.

00:32:11.919 --> 00:32:16.720
It’s reminiscent of sailors watching to
be the first to see land, but in this case,

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:21.429
it’s Saints trying to be the first to see
their link to the outside world—a world

00:32:21.429 --> 00:32:24.509
that some of them have only seen through screens.

00:32:24.509 --> 00:32:30.409
They try to spot the small metal tube that
represents the link between them and us.

00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:35.610
With patience, the time comes and the Embraer
E190 appears in St Helena’s skies.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:40.529
It makes its approach, usually jostled around
by the consistently inconsistent winds, then

00:32:40.529 --> 00:32:45.589
passes the daunting cliff at the end of the
runway, then glides smoothly into touchdown.

00:32:45.589 --> 00:32:49.119
That’s when the airport truly comes alive.

00:32:49.119 --> 00:32:53.669
Only 75 minutes sits between the scheduled
landing time and the scheduled takeoff time

00:32:53.669 --> 00:32:58.741
each Saturday so, as soon as the aircraft
takes its right turn towards the apron, there

00:32:58.741 --> 00:33:02.309
begins a carefully choreographed dance.

00:33:02.309 --> 00:33:06.049
The aircraft is marshaled in, then first to
approach are the airstairs, followed by the

00:33:06.049 --> 00:33:10.549
ground power unit that gives energy to the
aircraft while it sits powered down.

00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:14.479
While the cleaners approach the aircraft,
the baggage compartment of the aircraft is

00:33:14.479 --> 00:33:19.470
opened, the fuel truck gets into position,
and the first passengers start to disembark.

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:24.149
With certain jobs only needing to happen once
a week, quite a few staff at the airport work

00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:25.459
multiple jobs.

00:33:25.459 --> 00:33:29.129
The firefighters, for example, go straight
from their truck, assuring that the aircraft

00:33:29.129 --> 00:33:31.629
has landed safely, to handling baggage.

00:33:31.629 --> 00:33:35.940
At the back of the aircraft, all the sewage
from the lavatory has to be emptied, and an

00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:40.029
ambulift is used to lift passengers with reduced
mobility on and off.

00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:44.379
The pilots qualified to land at St Helena
are among the most senior and experienced

00:33:44.379 --> 00:33:48.679
at Airlink, which means there are fewer than
ten pilots who work the route.

00:33:48.679 --> 00:33:53.570
Therefore, they visit the island on average
about once a month, but, since the aircraft

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:58.389
only stays there for just over an hour, have
never seen more of the island than the airport.

00:33:58.389 --> 00:34:03.200
During their time on the island, though, they’ll
perform a safety inspection of the plane and

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.070
then, soon enough, it’ll be time to load
up.

00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:11.540
Boarding the 96 or fewer passengers doesn’t
take long, and quickly, the door will close,

00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:14.839
the stairs will pull away, and the aircraft
will taxi back to the runway.

00:34:14.839 --> 00:34:19.609
It will take a turn to the north, roll its
way down to the end of the runway, turn around,

00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:24.190
then thunder down St Helena’s spotlessly
clean piece of pavement to take off on its

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:27.159
four and a half hour trip back to Johannesburg.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:32.990
With that, the clock starts ticking again
as the airport preps for its next 75 minutes

00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:37.569
in the spotlight, and then everyone makes
their way to their homes or hotels, starting

00:34:37.569 --> 00:34:42.409
their next week of isolation from the world.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:46.240
Of course the Saints love the airport while
they’re at it, when they’re standing in

00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:50.129
the observation deck watching the plane fly
off, destined for Johannesburg in a quick

00:34:50.129 --> 00:34:51.779
four and a half hours.

00:34:51.779 --> 00:34:55.929
For those that have lived their entire lives
on St Helena, the prospect of getting to South

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.180
Africa in a matter of hours still seems like
magic.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:04.220
Once people go home, though, the question
that comes up frequently in conversation is:

00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:05.220
was it worth it?

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:12.049
“2013 and 2014, when they were building
the airport, was a big, significant boom for

00:35:12.049 --> 00:35:19.730
St Helena--the amount of people that were
in and out of the island, a lot of St Helenians

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:26.230
saw an airplane for the first time in their
life, the economy was actually thriving.

00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:31.770
So it was a build up to what was the airport
going to bring for saying to Helena.”

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:36.930
“I would say people expected the airport
to bring quite significant change.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:42.950
Now, whether that those expectations were
reasonable is something that is perhaps debatable.”

00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:48.450
“The once a week flight is ok, but at the
end of the day, if you bring it in a plane

00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:56.460
which can carry potentially 90 passengers,
that's not enough to be able to generate a

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:59.369
significant increase in the footfall on St
Helena.”

00:35:59.369 --> 00:36:03.940
“I think there's an expectation that the
service perhaps isn't delivering what it should,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:13.829
but I think we also have to take into account
the fact that we're still a relatively untested

00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:19.819
market both for tourists and also for potential
investors.”

00:36:19.819 --> 00:36:23.230
Looking at the graphs, the airport has had
some effect.

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:30.450
In the 12 months after its opening, 3,337
people arrived on the island by plane.

00:36:30.450 --> 00:36:35.880
That’s compared to just 2,616 passengers
who had arrived the previous 12 months on

00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:37.099
the RMS.

00:36:37.099 --> 00:36:43.330
In the airport’s second year of operations,
4,188 passengers arrived via the airport,

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:47.750
which certainly is a measurable improvement,
although overall visitor arrivals to the island

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:52.019
stayed about the same as there was a period
of overlap between the start of flights and

00:36:52.019 --> 00:36:53.730
the end of RMS service.

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:58.609
It’s tough to measure the true success of
the airport yet, just two years into service,

00:36:58.609 --> 00:37:03.200
but what’s sure is that there has been no
tourism explosion.

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.390
Flights are expensive, infrequent, and indirect
for everyone but South Africans, and this

00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:12.140
has kept the island a niche destination.

00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:16.349
The island certainly had to hurry up and wait,
as, while the first flight might have been

00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:20.260
the impetus for change, it certainly didn’t
change everything overnight.

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:24.529
Evacuation Flight - 2.5 minutes
Success, for St Helena Airport, however, cannot

00:37:24.529 --> 00:37:26.760
be measured solely by visitor numbers.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:32.839
It can also be measured in lives—the number
of lives this solitary piece of pavement has

00:37:32.839 --> 00:37:33.839
saved.

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:38.549
“So I, uh, I was in my last trimester…
fairly normal pregnancy up until the last

00:37:38.549 --> 00:37:41.240
bit when my blood pressure spiked.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:49.750
So the concern was preeclampsia and they decided
that I needed an emergency caesarean.

00:37:49.750 --> 00:38:00.450
So Eli was born about four weeks earlier than
than expected.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:12.070
We had him around half six Wednesday evening,
and he had a bit of a restless night.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:19.490
Breathing wasn't so good, although that was
to be expected because of the C-section.

00:38:19.490 --> 00:38:27.670
The next morning the midwife came in and she
said, no, breathing wasn't normal, and they

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:32.900
decided to put him on the ventilator and have
him assessed.

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:44.910
So they did so many tests and he had respiratory
distress syndrome and about like eleven-ish

00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:53.799
on Thursday night, Dr. Kevin O'Brian and Helen
Lawrence came in to our room to say that you

00:38:53.799 --> 00:38:57.660
say that he would need to be Medevacd.

00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:08.720
The RMS was on its last journey to the UK,
so our reaction was, how do we get him out?

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:15.660
And then we we were told that they had already
decided to get a medevac flight in.”

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:21.619
Two days after Eli was born, on a Friday afternoon,
a small jet from a South African medical evacuation

00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:26.480
company touched down at St Helena Airport,
representing only the fourth arrival by a

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:29.079
fixed wing aircraft to the island.

00:39:29.079 --> 00:39:33.210
The team spent the afternoon evaluating Eli’s
condition, and then early the following morning,

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:37.760
him and his mother, Patrice, were transferred
by ambulance to the airport and brought onto

00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760
the jet.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:43.310
After a quick four hours crossing the South
Atlantic, they touched down in Cape Town,

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:49.040
and by 2pm local time arrived at Vincent Pallotti
Hospital, with all the facilities Eli needed,

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.250
just about five hours after leaving the hospital
in St Helena.

00:39:52.250 --> 00:39:57.549
“If it wasn't for the airport then I really
doubt that Eli would have made it.

00:39:57.549 --> 00:40:03.869
It would have been a long wait for the RMS
to come down, like another month, and then

00:40:03.869 --> 00:40:05.390
the week’s travel to Cape Town.

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:07.779
He probably wouldn't have made it.

00:40:07.779 --> 00:40:10.869
Waiting for the month for the ship to actually
get there.

00:40:10.869 --> 00:40:17.849
So no, without the airport, I don't think
Eli would have survived.”

00:40:17.849 --> 00:40:20.799
Today, Eli is a perfectly healthy young boy.

00:40:20.799 --> 00:40:27.010
He’s one of the handful of Saints who quite
directly owe their lives to the airport.

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:32.160
Isolation is dangerous, and St Helena’s
hospital just isn’t equipped to handle advanced

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.440
medical conditions.

00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:39.369
Before the airport, that medical risk just
came with the territory and in some cases,

00:40:39.369 --> 00:40:45.460
survival was down to luck—the luck of where
the RMS was on its voyage schedule.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:50.070
One can’t easily argue against anything
that saves lives, no matter the cost, but

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:53.829
the truth is that, when the British government
spent their hundreds of millions of dollars

00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:59.289
to build St Helena Airport, they had more
than the humanitarian benefits in mind.

00:40:59.289 --> 00:41:04.710
In the two years since its opening, the airport
has brought change, but it has not yet fundamentally

00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:11.440
transformed what St Helena is.“I think that
the potential for the island is actually really,

00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:19.960
really quite strong, but I think, as with
all emerging destinations, it's going to take

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.960
a while.

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:27.869
What I think is worrying, though, is that
for a lot of people, it's how long will that

00:41:27.869 --> 00:41:28.869
while be?

00:41:28.869 --> 00:41:32.529
Is it going to be five years, 10 years, 20
years?

00:41:32.529 --> 00:41:34.059
Nobody really knows.”

00:41:34.059 --> 00:41:38.029
Long-term, the airport’s ambition is, of
course, to grow the island’s economy.

00:41:38.029 --> 00:41:42.180
The UK’s Department for International Development
conducted a business case for the airport

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:47.490
way back in 2010, and developed a tourism
growth estimate for St Helena based on how

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:51.890
other similar islands fared in the industry
after improving their access.

00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:57.890
This model, starting at about 1,000 tourists
per year in 2016, projected growth to 30,000

00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:02.589
yearly tourists by 2042—a number that has
been subject to intense scrutiny everywhere

00:42:02.589 --> 00:42:06.720
from the Saint Helena dinner table to the
Parliament of the United Kingdom.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.029
The data show, though, that accounting for
the one-year delay in the airport’s opening,

00:42:11.029 --> 00:42:15.670
current visitor arrivals are exactly on target
for this growth.

00:42:15.670 --> 00:42:19.940
What that means is that the airport project
is not doomed from the start.

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:24.390
What will determine its success is what’s
to come, and the Christmas 2019 season is

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:28.029
bringing something promising—sold-out flights.

00:42:28.029 --> 00:42:32.910
The holidays are by far the most popular season
for travel to St Helena and with that, in

00:42:32.910 --> 00:42:37.359
the months of December, January, and February,
Airlink has added Tuesday flights from Cape

00:42:37.359 --> 00:42:40.140
Town—a first for the island.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:45.190
In addition, there’s another promising sign:
in their first year of operation, the flights

00:42:45.190 --> 00:42:49.300
actually turned a small profit for Airlink.

00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:54.309
Longer term, the island has ambitions for
an even more extensive network of flights.

00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:58.359
One goal would be to get a route to a South
American city like Recife to allow for a more

00:42:58.359 --> 00:43:00.650
direct route from the Americas.

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:04.130
Technically, this would be plenty feasible
as it’s only a four-hour flight.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:07.119
Commercially, though, that’s another question.

00:43:07.119 --> 00:43:11.370
Also on the wishlist is a roundtrip flight
to Namibia to tap into their large tourism

00:43:11.370 --> 00:43:12.370
market.

00:43:12.370 --> 00:43:17.519
However, the largest tourist demographic for
the island by far is British, and so the crown

00:43:17.519 --> 00:43:20.950
jewel of routes would be to the UK.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:26.609
Since before the airport even opened there’s
been talk of a route to London via Cape Verde.

00:43:26.609 --> 00:43:29.720
Right now, though, these are all just dreams.

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:34.630
An airline would only take the enormous risk
of starting a route to St Helena if it proved

00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:36.630
not only commercially viable, but successful.

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:40.950
That has not happened yet.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.460
The next couple years for St Helena are crucial.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:49.150
As the number of successfully completed flights
ticks up, data will prove whether they’re

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:54.619
sticking to this line—the line that will
determine whether St Helena will survive economically

00:43:54.619 --> 00:43:56.579
into the far future.

00:43:56.579 --> 00:44:01.029
If they stick to it, they’re in for an economic
renaissance.

00:44:01.029 --> 00:44:05.609
If they start to fall below it, there’s
little hope for any sort of self-sufficiency,

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:10.150
meaning the island will remain at the mercy
of the UK’s budgetary allocations.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:15.311
St Helena was never supposed to change overnight
and the airport was never supposed to be a

00:44:15.311 --> 00:44:17.079
magic cure-all.

00:44:17.079 --> 00:44:22.460
The airport is a tool for change, not the
impetus of change itself.

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:27.691
For the island to fundamentally change, it
has to sell itself to the world.

00:44:27.691 --> 00:44:32.250
It has to one-by-one convince people to come
to it, to invest in it, to take a risk on

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:36.440
a place that’s competing with an entire
world of options.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:41.400
Time has proven that St Helena airport is
not, “the World’s Most Useless Airport.”

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:47.200
It has rather proven that it has the potential
to become the world’s most useful airport.

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:52.490
An airport that could save lives, revitalize
an economy, and connect a forgotten dot on

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:54.329
the map to the rest of it.

00:44:54.329 --> 00:44:58.670
An airport that could rescue an island from
falling into the same fate of so many like

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:04.390
it—crumbling into irrelevance as its people
are slowly drawn to the urban world—so now

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:18.210
that the island has their tool, all they have
to do is use it.

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:24.049
As I mentioned at the start, this entire project
was made possible thanks to Curiosity Stream.

00:45:24.049 --> 00:45:30.099
They covered all the enormous production expenses
including flying a team to St Helena and all

00:45:30.099 --> 00:45:34.599
they asked in return was for us to mention
the bundle deal they’re running with Nebula—the

00:45:34.599 --> 00:45:39.119

of other great creators and where this documentary

00:45:39.119 --> 00:45:41.420
originally released.

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:47.010
