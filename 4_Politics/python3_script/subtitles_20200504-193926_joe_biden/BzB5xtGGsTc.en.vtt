 Hello everyone, we are Wendover Production and thank Squarespace for sponsoring this show

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:16.269
 Last time I talked about why the speed of the passenger plane stalled, I focused on the supersonic Concorde 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:21.269
 But what I didn’t talk about in the last issue is that even if the operation of Concord is unsuccessful 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:27.229
 But it still has a major impact on today’s civil aviation operations 

00:00:27.229 --> 00:00:32.029
 Please allow me to come to the airlines one by one without earning money in economy class 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.970
 The real profit comes from high-end cabins such as 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.880
 British Airways flies from London Heathrow Airport to Washington Dulles Airport 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:48.020
 The airline's 777 airliner has 224 seats 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.980
 An economy class ticket from March 15th to 22nd is worth $876 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.360
 It means that if the economy class is sold out 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:08.880
 A round trip economy class total income of 106,872 USD 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.710
 The same flight's high-end economy class price is 2633 USD 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.020
 Revenue of cabin is USD 105,320 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.840
 The 40-seat premium economy class makes more money than the entire economy class 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:38.040
 Coming to 48 seats in the business class with a unit price of $6723 can bring in income of $322,704 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:48.530
 A total of 14 seats in the first class can bring in income of $8715 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:54.049
 So the 14 seats in the front are more profitable than the 122 seats in the back 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:59.859
 High-end economic business and first-class three high-end cabins add up 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:08.009
 A total of $55,034 in revenue means that 45% of passengers contributed 84% of revenue 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.190
 I want to draw your attention to 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.430
 There is no airline in the world that can earn $500,000 by flying a transatlantic route 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.690
 Otherwise, you have to count your money 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.890
 The reason for the high price of this route is 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.050
 This is a direct flight between popular cities in two high-income countries 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.900
 Of course, most passengers fly cheaper connecting routes 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.280
 For example, if you depart from Stockholm and take the British Airways 777 to London via London 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.210
 Economy class drops to US$392 high-end economy US$1150 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:00.040
 The official business is $3025 first-class $5564 but the income share is basically the same 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.310
 The bulk of income still comes from a small number of passengers 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.370
 This British Airways 777 aircraft cabin layout is more focused on high-end cabins 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.900
 Because British Airways mainly do high-end travel 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.630
 Even so, two-thirds of airlines’ revenues come mainly from three high-end segments 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.880
 But this is not always the case when civil aviation is still in its infancy 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.520
 There is no difference in cabin class, all seats are high-end seats 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.380
 It’s not that the plane at that time was very luxurious. 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.710
 It’s that flying is so expensive 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.360
 Just like Virgin Galactic’s space sightseeing trips are not divided by cabin 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.800
 Because space itself is already a luxury experience 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.990
 If one day of space travel civilians subdivision will definitely appear 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.421
 But until one mode of transportation can be reduced to the price range acceptable to ordinary people 

00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:02.360
 It's a first-class round-trip flight from New York to London in the 1950s 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:10.540
 Valued at $675, adjusted for inflation, approximately $6800 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.819
 Similar to today's first-class price 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.150
 The people in the front row have changed almost before and now, but the passengers in the back row 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.710
 The history of the development of aviation classes is not how airlines upgrade their cabin class 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.290
 It’s that they reduce costs so that more and more people can travel by plane 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.840
 At the same time, this is also an intuitive embodiment of economic theory 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:42.080
 Airlines sell the same product to different people at different prices 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.000
 No matter what class of airline you provide, 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.190
 The transportation service from point A to point B is different from the experience during transportation 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.100
 Air travel first appeared in the 40s and 50s 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.290
 A considerable proportion of airline revenue comes from the U.S. Postal Service’s airmail business 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.251
 These are usually red-eye flights that fly overnight and stop at many places 

00:05:04.251 --> 00:05:09.040
 Although it is mainly for mail transportation, these aircraft also retain some passengers 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.630
 For example, the price of first class can buy direct flights from New York to Chicago 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:18.350
 In Economy Class, you can only depart from Pittsburgh and Cleveland at 2:00 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.540
 Although the price is cheaper, the flight time is longer 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.010
 But the experience on the plane is basically the same 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:32.940
 It was not until 1952 that airlines began to charge different fares on the same flight 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:39.680
 For example, a airline company's New York and London route standard ticket is 395 US dollars, and a tourist ticket is 270 US dollars. 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.770
 Flights and planes are the same and the only difference is the ticket 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.820
 Travel tickets must be purchased in advance and cannot be returned 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.121
 You have to take the flight so the name suggests 

00:05:54.121 --> 00:05:59.550
 Travel tickets are aimed at tourists. Travelers usually make travel plans in advance 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.840
 They will take the planned flight so time flexibility is not important 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:10.050
 Full-price standard tickets are designed for business travelers 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:14.590
 Business travelers generally don’t have to buy their own tickets, they are paid by the company 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:19.440
 So they are not sensitive to the fare 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.430
 Business travel usually requires flexible time, they often buy tickets at the last minute 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.310
 Common situation is to buy tickets at the counter one hour before departure 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.370
 Full-price tickets are designed to pass the fare for this situation 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:38.520
 Aviation Division divided the market into two parts according to people's willingness to pay 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.320
 This is the only difference pricing mechanism for the next ten years 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:51.940
 Then three major events happened between 1969 and 1978 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.960
 Boeing 747 makes first flight to Concorde 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.560
 Civil aviation industry reforms allow airlines to use 747 space and Concord gimmicks to test high-end travel 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.380
 Previous civil aviation fares were subject to government regulation 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:12.800
 It is difficult for airlines to price by cabin 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:17.901
 Airlines can freely set prices after deregulation 

00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:21.960
 But at first, the difference is that some airlines will be more comfortable in the first class 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.300
 Because more and more business people turn to buy travel tickets 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.680
 Airline companies began to realize that it is necessary to improve the experience of business people who buy full-price tickets 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.990
 Distinguish them from those who buy discounted tickets 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.180
 At first it was just a simple break 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.820
 Full-price tickets first, discount tickets next 

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:50.020
 Then some airlines will remove the middle seat 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:54.290
 Finally, the airline company installed luxury seats and interiors 

00:07:54.290 --> 00:08:00.370
 Except for individual ones, most airlines do not have first class 

00:08:00.370 --> 00:08:04.520
 They focus on the mid-range passenger Concorde will become the choice of wealthy people travel 

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:09.520
 Ordinary airliners serve ordinary people 

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.300
 At least they thought so at first. I said in the last video 

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:19.040
 Concorde finally failed tragically 

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.050
 Those who canceled first-class airlines because of Concord started 

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:29.800
 Slowly resume first class in subsonic aircraft but until today 

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:35.830
 Only six airlines flying transatlantic routes have set up first class 

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:41.599
 Facing the Concorde competition in the sixties and seventies 

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:46.980
 Airlines have made great efforts to optimize business class 

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.880
 If there is no such breakthrough innovation in aviation technology 

00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:55.231
 But the new trend is that the first class is slowly disappearing again 

00:08:55.231 --> 00:09:00.330
 This is the seat map of Etihad Airways A380 

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:05.360
 Land per capita in economy class 0.35m² Land per capita in business class 0.94m² 

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.500
 First class per capita 3.25m² 

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:17.320
 Economy round trip fare from Abu Dhabi to New York is USD 1253 

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:24.750
 Business Class USD 6140 First Class USD 14128 means 

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:32.080
 Economy Class land price US$332 per square foot Business Class land price US$605 per square foot 

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.800
 First-class land price of $403 per square foot crowded economy class seats 

00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:42.710
 Very different from the business class seats that can lie flat 

00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:47.930
 But the difference between first class and business class is more spacious and more refined catering 

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:52.040
 It is difficult for airlines to convince passengers to take first class because the experience is basically the same 

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:57.560
 The cost of operating first class is significantly higher 

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.950
 So more and more airlines choose to cancel first class 

00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:06.310
 Use more profitable business class to replace flights where only airlines have tried business class 

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:11.540
 But no airline has so much high-end demand to fill up seats 

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:17.370
 So passengers in Economy Class are only used by airlines to fill up their seats 

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:22.730
 So passengers in Economy Class are only used by airlines to fill up their seats 

00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.670
