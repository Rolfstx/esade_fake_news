Welcome to the "West Wing

00:00:03.033 --> 00:00:05.734
everything that's happening at 
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:07.367
This week, big news!

00:00:07.367 --> 00:00:09.900
President Obama announces that
American service members have

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.533
killed Osama bin Laden.

00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:13.600
The President:
Justice has been done.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.300
Narrator:
Even as the President spoke about this historic milestone,

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.133
he also dealt with domestic issues like creating jobs,

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:21.734
reforming immigration policy and reaching out to communities

00:00:21.734 --> 00:00:24.433
in the South devastated by recent tornadoes.

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:27.333
The Teacher of the Year and the
Prince of Wales also stopped by.

00:00:27.333 --> 00:00:30.967
That's April 29th to May 5th,
or "A Good Day for America!"

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:33.367
The President:
As a country we will never 
tolerate our security

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:36.767
being threatened, nor
stand idly by when our people

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:38.133
have been killed.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.834
Narrator: On
Friday, April 29th, the 
President and Mrs. Obama

00:00:40.834 --> 00:00:43.800
visited Tuscaloosa, Alabama, 
to view damage from deadly

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.734
tornadoes and meet with Governor
Bentley and other state and

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:50.767
local officials and families
affected by the horrific devastation.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:51.867
The President:
Hey, y'all!

00:00:51.867 --> 00:00:52.867
Mr. McGee:
Hey, how you doin'?

00:00:52.867 --> 00:00:53.867
The President:
Was this your home, sir?

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:55.367
Mr. McGee:
Yes, sir.

00:00:55.367 --> 00:00:56.500
The President:
I'm so sorry for your loss.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.367
Good to see you.

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:00.734
Narrator:
The President also
visited Holt Elementary School

00:01:00.734 --> 00:01:05.066
to see relief efforts in action
and to thank first responders.

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:08.133
Debbie Crawford:
I'll have food and water 
over there for those

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:09.233
that need it.

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:12.667
We've been gone from here,
you know, in 48 hours,

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:15.633
we've been gone about four hours
is all since we've been here.

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:17.367
President:
Well, you ought to be tired, huh?

00:01:17.367 --> 00:01:18.600
Debbie Crawford:
I'm a little tired.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.533
The President:
We can't bring those who 
have been lost back.

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:25.567
They're alongside
God at this point.

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:30.367
We can help maybe a little bit
with the families dealing with

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:33.800
the grief of having
a loved one lost.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.200
But the property damage,
which is obviously extensive,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.367
that's something that we
can do something about.

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:45.033
Narrator:
Later on his way to Miami to 
deliver a commencement address,

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:47.467
the First Family
stopped in at Cape Canaveral.

00:01:47.467 --> 00:01:48.834
Though the final
mission of the U.S.

00:01:48.834 --> 00:01:51.867
Space Shuttle Endeavour was
delayed for technical reasons,

00:01:51.867 --> 00:01:54.633
they were able to take a look at
Space Shuttle Atlantis and meet

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:56.800
the astronauts who would
have gone on the mission.

The President:
Most time in space.

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.333
This guy?

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:05.033
He's a young guy.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:07.767
He's still got his hair!

the President stressed to 
students the focus and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.166
determination necessary to
succeed in the next phase of life.

00:02:17.166 --> 00:02:20.934
Bystander:
It's okay to pull it up and over, 
if you would.

00:02:20.934 --> 00:02:22.633
The President:
You guys don't really know, do you!

00:02:22.633 --> 00:02:24.100
(laughter)

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.100

is vital to America

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.233
reclaiming the highest proportion 
of college graduates

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.600

I have to say that as Commander

prouder of our
men and women in uniform.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.633

during the course of this 
year that have brought us

00:05:08.934 --> 00:05:11.934
together as an American family,
whether it was the tragedy in

Tucson or most recently our
unified response to the terrible

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:20.734

sacrifice on September 11th.

00:07:04.633 --> 00:07:07.066
The President:
Those guys took those 
extraordinary risks going into

00:07:07.066 --> 00:07:12.533
Pakistan that they
were doing it in part because of

00:07:12.533 --> 00:07:15.333
the sacrifices that were
made in this station.

00:07:15.333 --> 00:07:19.900

Beautiful school.

00:07:44.333 --> 00:07:45.467
It's up in Manoa.

00:07:45.467 --> 00:07:46.000
Up in the mountains.

I will definitely do that.

Tell them the foundation 
of all my success was

00:07:53.834 --> 00:07:55.500
Neolani School.

I will repeat that many times over.

00:07:57.033 --> 00:07:58.667
