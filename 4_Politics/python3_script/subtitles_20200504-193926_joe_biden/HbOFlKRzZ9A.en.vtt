00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.130
Culminating in multiple life sentences, the
Chris Watts case is one of the more horrific

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.870
and senseless murder cases of the last decade.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.260
So what led to the murder of Watts' wife,
two daughters, and unborn son?

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.759
In August 2018, Chris Watts made a televised
plea for the safe return of his missing wife,

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:24.310
Shanann Watts, and their two daughters; 4-year-old
Bella and 3-year-old Celeste, also known as

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.159
Cece; after the three were reported missing
by a family friend.

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:30.009
Chris told Denver7 in an interview:

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.620
"I hope that she's somewhere safe right now
and with the kids."

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.800
Sadly, only two days after the interview,
bodies thought to belong to Shanann and the

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.039
children were discovered by police at Chris'
former place of employment, Anadarko Petroleum

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:45.039
Company.

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.160
Bella and Celeste's remains were reportedly
located in crude oil tanks, while Shanann,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.609
who was 15 weeks pregnant, was found in a
shallow grave on the property.

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.710
Chris was arrested one day before the remains
were recovered, and he confessed to killing

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.999
Shannan in anger after allegedly witnessing
her strangle their two kids.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:07.670
In a video released by the 19th Judicial District
Attorney’s Office, Chris stated:

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:17.710
"My babies are gone, and I put hands around
my wife’s neck and did that same thing."

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.439
In a sworn affidavit, Chris claimed that his
wife's alleged killings of the girls happened

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.780
after he told Shanann that he wanted a separation.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.119
Prosecutors charged him with nine felonies,
including three counts of first-degree murder.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.950
But in a shocking twist, Chris pled guilty
to all of the murder charges, including those

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.080
of the children, on November 6th, 2018, just
months after he'd pointed the finger at Shanann.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.479
He was eventually sentenced to three consecutive
life terms for his unimaginable crimes.

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.640
But just when you thought you'd heard the
entire tragic story of the Watts family case,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.700
in February 2019 the convicted killer gave
a full confession detailing the horrific crimes.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.320
One of the devastating questions about this
case rests on whether Bella and Celeste Watts

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.050
were already dead when Shanann Watts arrived
home from a business trip in Arizona.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.470
All we know for sure is this: On the night
of August 13th, 2018, Shanann was dropped

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.680
off at her home around 2 a.m, by a friend,
Nickole Atkinson.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.360
According to court documents, prosecutors
believe it's possible that she and her daughters

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.000
died sometime between August 12th and August
13, 2018.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.480
This timeline suggests Chris Watts possibly
harmed his daughters before Shanann arrived

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480
home.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.840
We'll probably never know exactly what happened
that night, but Chris clarified the timeline

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.489
when he spoke with investigators from jail
in February 2019.

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.630
Chris claimed that, after arguing with Shanann
about their marriage, he strangled her to

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.630
death.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.830
According to The Coloradan, Bella supposedly
woke up during the commotion and asked:

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.220
"What's wrong with mommy?"

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.580
Chris said he then placed the girls and Shanann's
body into his truck, drove approximately 45

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.340
minutes to his worksite, and killed the girls
one by one after burying his wife in a shallow

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.340
grave.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.060
He claimed to have smothered Cece first, then
Bella, who supposedly pleaded for her life

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.360
before she was killed.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.850
Of course, there's always the possibility
Chris fabricated these new details given his

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.320
history with lying.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.170
But there's no denying the scenario wrecked
Shanann's family, as Shanann's brother, Frank

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.790
Rzueck Jr., told Dr. Phil McGraw in March
2019:

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.310
"It's worse than we even thought.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.860
We thought the worst was what we heard already,
you know?"

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.650
Considering Shanann was 15 weeks pregnant
at the time of her death, it's reasonable

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.549
for people to wonder why Chris wasn't charged
with killing his unborn son, who they reportedly

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.180
were to name Nico.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.380
The explanation?

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.780
Colorado doesn't have fetal homicide laws
in place, which means authorities weren't

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.330
able to include Nico on its victim list.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.490
A total of 38 states recognize unborn children
in murder cases, while eight states, Colorado,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:58.220
Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, New Mexico,
Oregon, and Wyoming, have laws against harming

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.220
pregnant women.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.340
Prosecutors in Colorado, where Shanann and
her daughters were murdered, charged Chris

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.640
with the unlawful termination of a pregnancy
in accordance with state law.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.770
Additionally, some might argue that charging
Chris with an additional death wouldn't affect

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.710
his punishment, since he's already serving
three consecutive life sentences in prison,

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:20.300
meaning there is no possible chance for parole.

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.510
Before Chris Watts pleaded guilty to the murders,
it looked like his defense team was preparing

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.810
to place the blame on Shanann Watts.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.810
Want proof?

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.190
According to the Washington Post, Chris' lawyers
filed a motion for investigators to swab the

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.650
girls' necks and hands for possible DNA evidence.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.130
Additionally, the defense requested that a
DNA expert of their choosing be present during

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.010
the collection process, as reported by CNN.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.270
The defense was likely trying to back up Chris'
past claim that Shanann had strangled their

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.120
daughters to death following a fight about
their marriage.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.380
But likely to Chris' chagrin, the judge denied
all of the defense's requests.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.280
According to CNN, the ruling stated:

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.880
"The court cannot order the prosecution and/or
coroner how to conduct their investigation."

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.130
After the release of the joint law enforcement
interview of Chris in February 2019, during

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.420
which he confessed to killing his daughters
in addition to his wife, Shanann's loved ones

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.670
expressed relief that her name was finally
cleared.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:21.540
Rzucek family attorney Stephen Lambert told
Southern Colorado NBC affiliate KOAA News

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:22.540
5:

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.590
"These tapes put to rest any kind of that
speculation, and that Shanann's memory can

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.810
be put to rest as a loving mother and a caring
wife."

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.690
One of Chris' possible motives involves financial
struggles, a common source of tension between

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.930
married couples.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:42.450
Chris and Shanann filed for bankruptcy in
June 2015, after they bought their $400,000

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.830
house in Colorado, according to CNN.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:50.060
The two were reportedly $70,000 in debt, a
total they racked up thanks to student loans

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:51.710
and credit card purchases.

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:58.880
Their savings appeared to be a total of $9.51
in one account and $864 in a joint checking

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:59.880
account.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.470
Although Shanann reportedly made $80,000 a
year, it's possible Chris was concerned about

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.300
the cost of another child.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.790
This alleged motive, however, has not been
confirmed.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.030
Another potential motive?

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:12.210
Chris' alleged affair.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.130
Denise Mowder, a former prosecutor and an
associate professor of criminology and criminal

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.000
justice at MSU Denver, theorized that Chris
allegedly murdered his family in order to

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.150
live an unencumbered life with his rumored
mistress.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.170
Mowder told Denver7:

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:31.750
"I think he had a vision of another life with
this other woman, carefree, no responsibilities."

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.410
Chris denied these theories, however, claiming
he felt rage after Shanann supposedly threatened

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:37.770
to take their kids away.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.240
"I didn't want to do this, but I did it,"
he plainly told investigators in February

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.800
2019, in audio transcribed by The Coloradan.

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.340
There are a few discrepancies in Chris Watts'
version of what happened the night of August

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.390
13th, 2018, something the public is well aware
of by now.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.370
But what many people don't know is that Chris
allegedly lied about Shanann Watts' whereabouts

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.680
from the very beginning.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.370
Nickole Atkinson, the friend who was reportedly
the last to see Shanann alive, said she knew

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:11.160
something was wrong when Chris was supposedly
evasive about where his wife went on the morning

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.510
of her disappearance.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:16.570
Atkinson, who was concerned after Shanann
missed an important pregnancy checkup, opened

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.200
up about her bizarre exchange with Chris.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.690
She told Good Morning America:

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.850
"He just kept saying that he didn't know where
she was and that she was on a playdate.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:27.190
But he couldn't give us the name of the friend."

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:28.300
Atkinson continued:

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.820
"I knew he had something to do with it the
day I was at his house with him, but I didn't

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:35.070
want to think that."

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:39.020
Chris Watts was allegedly having an affair
with a co-worker at the time he murdered his

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.020
family.

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.950
The disturbing detail came to light in Chris'
arrest affidavit, in which police claimed

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.430
they found evidence of his cheating following
an investigation.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:52.880
The co-worker Chris supposedly had an affair
with, who reportedly cooperated with the investigation,

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.590
was later identified as Nicho Kessinger.

00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:01.610
In addition to Kessinger, an unnamed man took
to HLN's Crime &amp; Justice with Ashleigh Banfield

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:06.690
in August 2018 to claim he carried on a relationship
with Chris for ten months.

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:10.780
The alleged lover said he met Chris online,
and that they parted ways sometime in March

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:14.470
or April 2018, as reported by Us Weekly.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:18.390
But multiple news outlets couldn't confirm
the man's account, and it's not clear if police

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.360
investigated his allegations.

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.580
What is obvious?

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:25.710
Many people weren't happy that the show's
host, Ashleigh Banfield, went ahead with the

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:28.910
interview given the lack of corroborating
details.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:33.810
Whether Shanann Watts knew about Chris' alleged
affairs or not, the answer isn't clear.

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:37.450
Shanann's friend Nickole Atkinson said in
an interview with ABC News:

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.570
"There was speculation [about an affair],
but she didn't want to believe that either...He

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.110
wasn't being the loving Chris that he normally
was.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.930
He wasn't touching or hugging or doing stuff
like that.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:51.130
And he wasn't being as attentive to the girls
as he normally is."

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:54.560
Murder suspects are often portrayed in an
unflattering light.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:59.010
Whether they're a loner or are emotionally
disturbed or angry, there's typically something

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:01.870
off about someone who is accused of a violent
crime.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:06.820
But in the case of Chris Watts, this stereotype
doesn't seem to fit.

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:12.970
"My Daddy is a hero, he helps me grow up strong."

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.990
One high school friend, for instance, couldn't
believe the Watts she knew had been charged

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:17.990
with murder.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.390
Former classmate Brandi Smith told the Daily
Beast:

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:25.110
"Most of our conversations that I recall were
about music and things like that...I was a

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.190
bit of an outcast and he kinda just seemed
to understand me."

00:09:28.190 --> 00:09:31.260
Then there's Lance Alfonso, who played football
with Watts.

00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.670
He revealed to the Daily Beast:

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.960
"I've never seen him ever get angry at anybody,
even on the football field."

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.340
Of course, a lot can change between high school
and adulthood, and you can never know what's

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:44.880
truly going on inside another person's head.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.710
One of the most haunting and poignant aspects
of the Watts murder case is Shanann Watts'

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:51.160
social media presence.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.870
Shanann's Facebook account features countless
photos of the mom happily posing with Chris

00:09:55.870 --> 00:10:00.110
Watts and their two daughters, as well as
snaps of the couple enjoying romantic vacations

00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:01.110
together.

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:04.690
Translation: Shanann and Chris' lives seemed
picture perfect.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:08.640
Given the tragic events that occurred, it's
fair to wonder if Shanann and Chris might

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.420
have been putting on a front for the outside
world.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:16.180
A neighbor named Melinda Phillips suggested
as much in an interview with People, recalling

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:21.120
a, quote, "argument" she witnessed between
the two earlier in the summer of 2018.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:25.250
"Their body language was really angry, and
they were just fighting back and forth...He

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.740
was gesturing [with] his hands and they were
shaking their heads, and it was definitely

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.740
an argument."

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:33.330
But things took a strange turn when Shanann
and Chris supposedly caught Phillips' eye

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:34.810
mid-fight.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:35.810
Phillips claimed:

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.620
"They caught my eye and suddenly, everything
changed...They stopped being so angry, and

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:41.490
they started talking a lot more calmly.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:43.270
He even gave her a hug.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:46.370
Mind you, this was in the space of 30 seconds
to a minute."

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.370
Phillips added,

00:10:47.370 --> 00:10:50.690
"From a full-blown fight to hugs in less than
a minute, it was incredible."

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:56.700
Shanann Watts' younger brother, Frank Rzucek
Jr., took to Facebook shortly after Chris

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:00.890
Watts' arrest to express his rage and sadness
about the situation.

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.420
According to a screenshot obtained by The
Sun, he wrote:

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.920
"I just want to know why.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:10.410
My precious family my one and only sibling,
my sister Shanann, 2 adorable nieces Bella

00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:15.690
and Celeste and her soon to be found out unborn
son Niko...I just want 30 seconds alone with

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:17.080
that heartless psychopath.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.640
May Satan have mercy on his soul."

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.110
But Chris wasn't Frank's only target.

00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:27.440
He also went after investigators for supposedly
taking too long to arrest Shanann's husband.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.440
Frank wrote:

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.930
"The cops drug their feet.

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.030
He was the only one with them and backed his
truck into the garage.

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:36.180
Doesn't take a genius to know who was suspect.

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:40.300
My blood is boiling and the pain and anger
and sadness I have in my heart."

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:43.300
Frank ended his post with a message for Chris,
saying:

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:47.890
"Nothing absolutely nothing would get in my
way of taking away his life like he did mine

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.720
and my ENTIRE FAMILY."

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:54.060
Cops arrested Chris two days after Shanann
was reported missing, but it's likely Shanann's

00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:59.530
brother was frustrated that authorities didn't
take Chris into custody the same day.

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:04.900
Other than investigators' jailhouse interview
with Chris Watts in February 2019, the convicted

00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.760
killer hasn't spoken out.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:12.650
That is, until first-time author Cherlyn Cadle
published a book in September 2019 detailing

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:17.590
her written correspondence and prison visits
with Chris, titled, Letters from Christopher:

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:20.790
The Tragic Confessions of the Watts Family
Murders.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.490
Many shocking claims were made in the book,
which Cadle reviewed during a November 2019

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:30.090
appearance on Dr. Oz, where she alleged Chris
confessed to smothering his daughters before

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:31.560
killing Shanann Watts.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.490
And then after Chris murdered Shanann, Bella
and Celeste Watts supposedly woke up.

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:40.680
This version of events contradicts Chris'
claim to police that the only time he harmed

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.550
the girls was at the worksite where the bodies
were found.

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:47.060
Additionally, Chris changed his story about
acting on impulse.

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.350
In a letter to Cadle, he supposedly wrote:

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:54.630
"August 12th when I finished putting the girls
to bed, I walked away and said, 'That's the

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.480
last time I'm going to be tucking my babies
in."

00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:59.020
Chillingly, the quote continues:

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.780
"I knew what was going to happen the day before."

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:05.310
Although the book is compelling, these revelations
might be inaccurate.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:09.750
Cadle's book, according to multiple reviews
on Goodreads, was supposedly riddled with

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:11.920
grammatical errors and misinformation.

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.510
What's more?

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:16.650
Authorities haven't confirmed her findings.

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:21.310
After Shanann Watts and her daughters were
reported missing, Chris Watts' secrets quickly

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:22.910
began to unravel.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:27.300
And one of those secrets might have been what
blew the case wide open, at least according

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.500
to Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:35.180
In an Investigation Discovery special about
Chris' mistress coming forward with details

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:37.070
about their affair, Rourke said:

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:42.380
"Nichol Kessinger turned out to have information
that I can best describe as being a bombshell."

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.980
Although this might seem obvious, it wasn't
only telling because it showed Chris was seemingly

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.361
intent on starting a new life, it was big
because it painted the picture of him as a

00:13:51.361 --> 00:13:52.750
habitual liar.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:57.180
And if Chris lied about Kessinger (he denied
the infidelity to investigators at first),

00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:59.410
then what else might he be hiding?

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:02.810
As it turns out, Chris was supposedly lying
to Kessinger, too.

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:07.010
In police recordings from the same Investigation
Discovery special, Kessinger said:

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.870
"He informed me that he did have two kids,
that he was currently in the process of a

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:15.480
separation from his wife...As far as I knew,
that was becoming pretty finalized."

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.360
Shanann Watts' family was under no obligation
to speak out about their tragic losses, but

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:25.770
they bravely decided to share their story
with Dr. Phil McGraw in March 2019.

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:31.070
A lot of revelations were made during the
episode, including Shanann's mother, Sandy

00:14:31.070 --> 00:14:36.029
Rzucek's, story about communicating with Shanann,
Celeste, and Bella after their deaths.

00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:38.380
On the Dr. Phil show, Sandy explained:

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:42.520
"I felt my daughter's spirit the moment she
died."

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.250
She claimed she somehow knew that something
had happened.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.660
"I swear to God I knew.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.430
I woke up Frankie, I woke up the whole house.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:51.250
I said, 'Something's wrong with Shanann.'"

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:54.790
Not only that, but the bereaved mom said she
spoke with Shanann directly.

00:14:54.790 --> 00:15:00.330
"That night I was laying in bed, and I just
felt a presence and I heard my daughter.

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:06.060
I felt her, and I heard her say, 'I love you
mommy and I'm sorry.'

00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.080
She told me she was at peace."

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.870
Bella, as Sandy recalled, came to her and
happily said:

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.490
"I can go to Walt Disney World anytime I want.'

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:15.020
And I said, that's right, Bella."

00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:19.279
Whether you believe Sandy's account or not,
it's clear she loved her family dearly.

00:15:19.279 --> 00:15:23.060
Our hearts go out to her and the rest of Shanann's
loved ones.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:27.610
In such a disturbing case as the Watts family
murders, sometimes the horrific details can

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:30.089
overshadow the people who worked the case.

00:15:30.089 --> 00:15:34.680
It was powerful when Frederick police Detective
Dave Baumhover, the lead detective on the

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.750
Watts case, spoke to The Denver Post in August
2019 about struggling with post-traumatic

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.970
stress disorder.

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:42.090
He shared with the outlet:

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:45.830
"It's like when you're a kid and you go on
the wrong carnival ride and all you want to

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.620
do is get off...But you can't.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.089
You have no choice until the ride shuts off."

00:15:50.089 --> 00:15:55.420
As Baumhover told the outlet, he stopped working
in March 2019 after interviewing Chris Watts

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.610
in prison for his full confession.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:01.990
It's unclear if he has since returned to law
enforcement, but he sounded unsure about his

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.100
professional future in the candid conversation.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.210
Detective Baumhover stated:

00:16:06.210 --> 00:16:10.720
"I have a hard time dealing with the probability
that my career is ended, and not the way that

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:13.660
I wanted it to...Some days you feel defeated."

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:18.980
Colorado Bureau of Investigation agent Tammy
Lee had a similar reaction, once breaking

00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:20.940
down sobbing in a hair salon.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:23.620
Lee told The Denver Post about her pain, saying:

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:27.390
"I felt like I knew them...I've been to many
homicides of children.

00:16:27.390 --> 00:16:28.690
This one was different."

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:33.350
Baumhover and Lee, along with others, spoke
out to draw awareness to mental health services

00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:35.600
for law enforcement.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.790
Many people were shocked when Chris Watts
confessed to murdering his family on November

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:44.690
6, 2018, almost three months after he pleaded
not guilty to the charges.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:49.110
So, why did Chris finally admit to his alleged
involvement in the slayings?

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:53.110
His plan of action reportedly shifted when
prosecutors said they wouldn't seek the death

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.040
penalty if he confessed to the terrifying
crimes.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.170
Shanann Watts' mother reportedly approved
the idea.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:03.190
Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke
shared that she said to him:

00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:08.150
"He made the choice to take those lives, I
do not want to be in the position of making

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:09.150
the choice to take his."

00:17:09.150 --> 00:17:12.429
Chris reportedly knew the odds were against
him if the case went to trial.

00:17:12.429 --> 00:17:13.680
A source told People:

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.260
"There was physical evidence and his own words
that would convict him...His story didn't

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.260
work.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:20.260
He got angry."

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:21.260
The source also claimed that:

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:22.550
"He didn't want to plead guilty.

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.150
But he really had no choice, considering the
evidence.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.530
It took a little bit of time for him to come
around, but he did."

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:32.511
Rourke expressed relief that Shanann's name
was cleared in the murders of Bella and Celeste

00:17:32.511 --> 00:17:33.511
Watts.

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:35.090
NBC News reported that Rourke stated:

00:17:35.090 --> 00:17:41.020
"The spotlight that he tried to shine on Shanann
falsely, incorrectly and, frankly, a flat-out

00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:42.710
lie has been corrected."

00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:43.710
He added,

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:46.920
"The spotlight shines directly where it belongs:
on him."
