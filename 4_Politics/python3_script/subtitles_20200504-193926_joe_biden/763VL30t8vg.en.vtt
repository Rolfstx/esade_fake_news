00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
 (Guitar music) 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.540
 Hi, everybody 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.800
 Good job 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.840
 This is eggplant 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.440
 Korean eggplant ga-ji 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.720
 We are going to do gaji-namul now 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.340
 Steamed eggplant 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.300
 Steamed eggplant is my favorite side dish 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.100
 First of all 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.180
 We want to steam this 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.560
 And this is my steamer 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.540
 then 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.240
 I poured two glasses of water into it 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.480
 This is a steamer stand, I will put it in 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.960
 Then close the lid 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.640
 Let the water boil 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.700
 About five minutes, I let it boil two glasses of water, it will boil quickly 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.100
 Here are three, I will use them 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.840
 About a pound 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.760
 Here 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.340
 I want to clean them quickly 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.780
 Then cut about two and a half inches long 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:12.740
 like this 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.760
 When the water starts to boil, we have to steam it 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.500
 It’s rolling now, let’s steam it 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.940
 Open this 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.380
 At the same time, let us prepare 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.760
 Our seasoning 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.660
 Three garlic 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.780
 I sometimes mentioned 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.140
 Whenever I make this steamed eggplant 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.740
 I will use a lot of garlic 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.060
 Because when I was young, I heard my grandma telling my aunt 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.820
 "Oh, 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.640
 When you make steamed eggplant, 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.960
 You must use some garlic. " 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.460
 I heard this 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:04.200
 then 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.880
 "Okay, this garlic is very important, it will make it more delicious." 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.040
 Then two shallots 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.920
 We want it 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.500
 Put in 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.260
 Here 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.940
 This is my chopsticks, a chopsticks 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.900
 Five minutes later, I will poke them 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.600
 And see if it's easy 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.700
 If this 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.260
 If it is cooked too long, it will be mushy 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.020
 If this is not cooked, it will not taste good 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.580
 So look at this 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.440
 Poke in easily 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.500
 Like this, this is done 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.540
 I want to take them out 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.280
 like this 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.220
 Let them cool here 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.660
 It's really hot 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.660
 Be careful, you know 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.240
 I can handle very hot things 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.060
 Except this one 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.960
 this is 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.160
 Really really hot 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.300
 At the same time, we make this sauce together 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.260
 Chopped garlic and shallot 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.400
 Then we need to add something salty 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.760
 One tablespoon 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.340
 soy sauce 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.820
 If you are a vegetarian 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.060
 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.280
 So a total of four teaspoons 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.500
 You can use soy sauce, then the vegetarian version 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.500
 But today 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.980
 I will use a little fish sauce 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.000
 Because fish sauce makes it special 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.800
 Fish sauce 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.000
 A teaspoon 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.060
 The reason why I add fish sauce is 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.460
 Fish sauce will have a heavier taste 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.580
 Make it taste like Korean soy sauce soup 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.080
 Fermented soy sauce soup 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.580
 And one teaspoon of chili flakes 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.520
 Stir well 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.180
 sesame oil 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.520
 About two teaspoons 

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.860
 Then, tear them 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.660
 If this is hot 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.900
 You can dip your fingers like this 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.400
 like this 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.100
 A bite of tablets 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.200
 So, hot 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.420
 I want to dip my fingers like this 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.480
 If you tear them by hand, it’s delicious 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.600
 Okay, complete 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.300
 I'm going to mix them together now 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.280
 Smells so good 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.060
 Sesame oil and garlic 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.560
 then 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.480
 Homemade roasted sesame 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.160
 Crumble this sesame 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.780
 Between fingers 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.680
 Smells really good 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.940
 About one tablespoon 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.340
 Ah, very good 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.840
 Beautiful 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.500
 Let me try 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.480
 eat first 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.100
 Ok 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.720
 Soft, sweet, juicy 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.800
 And sesame oil and garlic 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.720
 This is all the taste of some special seasoning in Korea 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.100
 It's all together 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.880
 very delicious 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.240
 I like the taste of eggplant when they are steamed 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.740
 Not very greasy 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.420
 Today, we did gaji-namul 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:36.620
 Korean steamed eggplant and sauce 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:38.100
 Enjoy my recipe 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:39.500
 see you later 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.920
 worship!
