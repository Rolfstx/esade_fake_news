00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.950
Very few things in this country
galvanize public opinion like someone

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:14.450
trying to mess around with people's
preferences in the bedroom.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.410
I'm talking of course about what they watch on
late-night television, and NBC found that

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.730
out a few months ago when Conan O'Brien,
the newly installed host of The Tonight

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.380
Show, quit after the network announced it
was going to push the Tonight Show into

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.029
tomorrow, and to give its traditional
timeslot back to O'Brien's predecessor

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.310
Jay Leno. It triggered a lot of bad
publicity for NBC, an outpouring of

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.480
public support for Conan and some of the
best late-night jokes in a decade.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.130
Conan walked away with a 32 million
dollar settlement and a new cable show,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.050
and NBC did its best to push him into
oblivion, legally prohibiting him from

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.219
saying anything false or disparaging
about the network, and from giving

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:00.829
interviews or appearing on television
until...now. If you're wondering what

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.860
happened to Conan O'Brien and what he
thinks about all of this, you're about to find out.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.600
So what's with the beard?

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.060
The first day that I woke up and was no

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.909
longer the host of The Tonight Show, I
remember the first thought I had is

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:21.619
"I am NOT shaving" and that was my small
victory. Oh okay so I lost The Tonight

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:25.040
Show but I'll show them...
I'll stop shaving.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.600
This has been quite a year

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.935
Yeah......that's it we're done this was a
lot of fun.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.760
This year has been

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.760
is still incomprehensible to me the
amount of stuff that's happened in my

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.520
life in the last year is... it's gonna
take me a long time to process it.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.520
After leaving the Tonight Show in January and hanging out at his home

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.020
trying to figure out what he was going to do with the rest of his life,

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.575
he decided the best therapy would be to get out of the house and back to work.

00:02:01.575 --> 00:02:04.900
He assembled a lot of his old staff, opened a Twitter account,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.060
"That's the tweet",

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.460
And began planning

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.459
nationwide comedy tour
something that he had never done before

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.786
and one of the few things he was allowed
to do contractually

00:02:13.786 --> 00:02:14.286
"See how things play out"

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.970
We met up with him in Seattle.
You must have been miserable the

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.814
last couple of months.

00:02:19.814 --> 00:02:24.090
I went through
some stuff and got very depressed at

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.250
times you know it was like a marriage
breaking up suddenly violently quickly

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.760
and I was just trying to figure out what
happened.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.600
When we started putting this tour together,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.360
I started to
feel better almost immediately and then

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.380
this, there's no better antidote to what
I've just been through then to do this every night.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.140
"Ladies and Gentlemen..."

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.000
"I'll see you in a little bit." "Ok"

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.120
Why don't you go?

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.680
No stop!

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.600
You go! I can't do it!

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.600
"CONAN O'BRIEN!"

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.680
You know doing this tour though this is
a huge milestone for me

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.310
This is the first time anybody has ever paid to see me can you believe that

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:18.700
yeah oh they they paid to make me go
away (laughs)

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.700
"On the Road Again"

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.190
The legally prohibited from being funny on television tour has boosted his

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.510
confidence, kept him relevant, and
provided an outlet for him to explore

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.370
his anger, disappointment, and anxiety
with mostly self-deprecating humor my

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.100
"My Own Show Again...I just can't wait to have my own show again..."

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:47.000
"I'd even take a primetime show that's on at ten anything to have my own show again"

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.810
After forty performances in thirty two cities in the US and Canada, the tour will wind up next month

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.760
at Radio City Music Hall in New York,
right next door to NBC's corporate headquarters

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.249
where this whole late-night
Fiasco was cooked up.

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:02.530
I just want to say

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.250
I couldn't be happier, you were the only
choice, you were the perfect choice you

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.960
have been an absolute gentleman in
private

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.920
"Conan Rocks"

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:10.640
in the press

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.575
I agree Conan rocks. Good luck next week my friend.

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:14.000
Jay thank you for everything

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.460
Less than one year after Jay Leno handed The Tonight Show off to Conan O'Brien,

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:28.300
NBC decided to cancel Leno's disastrous primetime show and move him back into his old time period at 11:35 Eastern.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.500
Conan's "Tonight Show", which was losing badly in the ratings to David Letterman,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.800
was to be bumped back to 12:05 the next morning.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.370
Was it in the back of your mind that,
"look, if I don't do that well they could just...

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.380
just pop Leno back in?"

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.760
I'm a paranoid person and I think I'm the kind of

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.460
person that can come up with lots of
negative scenarios but I remember

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.580
thinking that seemed like a...that
was a stretch even for me.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:00.700
What followed were some unpleasant discussions with NBC's West Coast brass.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.360
It just felt like tthe tone went very quickly from

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.340
"take your time we understand this is a tough decision"

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:09.270
To (hits his chair and snaps fingers)

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.240
you know "Let's go".

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.070
You know and that
probably helped me a little bit feel

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.670
like "you know what, this environment
doesn't feel right, and I've been with these

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:26.030
people a long time and I don't like... I
really don't like the way this is going."

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:35.020
And when it started to get toxic, and I
started to feel that I'm not sure these

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.400
people even really want me here let's
just...let's just...I can't do it.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.000
Do you think they wanted you to leave?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.040
Uhhh yeah that's crossed my mind

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:55.000
I don't know how thought-out this whole
thing was, but if they wanted me to leave

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.380
it worked.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.840
This is just really really hard for him it was watching someone's heart broken.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.800
Liza O'Brien, Conan's wife, was one of his main

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.100
confidants and closest advisors during
the debacle

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.400
Did you approve of everything that he
did?

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.820
100% yeah.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.400
You thought he should have left?

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:16.920
Absolutely.

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.000
What do you think of the way he was treated by NBC?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.390
From my perspective it
felt like they never really gave him the

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:28.940
job, that they said "we're going to give
you this job in five years", and they kept

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.790
him with the company and they they you
know he said "I won't go anywhere else

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:35.690
and I'll keep working for you and I'm in
it for the long haul" and it felt like

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.430
they they lost their nerve to really
make a change and that was too bad

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:44.090
It was a shame because it would have been great to see what he could have done if

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.592
he had had their full support and had
some more time.

00:06:46.592 --> 00:06:47.300
You've got this

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.960
non-disparagement agreement...

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.680
Do you have a copy because I haven't read it in a while

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:57.820
I keep one in my wallet (laughs)

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.820
It'd be funny

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.733
anytime people come up to me

00:07:00.733 --> 00:07:04.970
"hey so what's the deal with uh
with Jay Leno" hold on a second

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.280
He's a fine and good man...There we go put that away.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.240
Can I assume that this interview

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.020
would take a different tenor if that
agreement did not exist?

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.520
No it I don't think it would. The biggest thing people come up and say to me

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:19.949
in gas stations and restaurants

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:22.349
I have so many people say
this to me

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:26.789
"Hey partner you got screwed" I don't and I
always tell them no I didn't, I didn't

00:07:26.789 --> 00:07:31.220
get screwed. I'm fine, it just it didn't
work out.

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:32.520
Oh you did get screwed

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:33.600
You think I got screwed?

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.500
Well I think most people think you got screwed,

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.820
I mean Jay Leno thinks you got screwed, Jay Leno thinks he got screwed

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:41.000
 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.240
How did he get screwed? (laughs)

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.765
Explain that part to me...I'm sorry

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:55.710
Jay's got The Tonight Show, I have a beard,

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:02.580
and an inflatable bat and I'm touring city to
city. Who can say who can say who won and who lost?

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.400
I'm laughing because crying would be sad.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.820
Has Jay
reached out to you?

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.140
No

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.580
No calls?

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.310
No I do not

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:14.345
I do not think I will be hearing
from him.

00:08:14.345 --> 00:08:16.440
We should get him in here

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.338
Is he gonna be a surprise walk-on?

00:08:19.338 --> 00:08:20.190
No no no
Okay

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:25.020
But we can call if you know his number or we and I'm sure he'd come over.

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.520
He may have caller ID he won't pick up

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.800
I think Leno would say "look I was riding

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:37.829
high I was number one and I was still
number one when I left and Conan made

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:42.270
this deal with NBC and NBC said okay Jay
we're gonna take you off the air in five

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.899
years regardless of whether you're
number one or number two or what"

00:08:45.899 --> 00:08:52.290
I think he felt like he was forced out by
NBC at a time when he was a strong

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:55.940
number one and was pushed out the door

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.920
mm-hmm mm-hmm

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.500
That's his argument.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.240
It's hard for me to
get inside his head and argue his side

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.920
of this whole thing.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:12.500
I was...here's what
I can say; I'm happy with my decision

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.580
I sleep well at night

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.480
and I you know...

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:22.300
hope he's happy with his decision.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:24.500
Do you think that Jay lobbied for this?

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.460
I don't know but...

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.200
what I know is what happened

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.500
which is that he went and
took that show back

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:37.500
Do you believe he acted honorably during all of this?

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.200
(groans)

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:45.340
I don't...I don't think I can answer that

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.220
I don't think...

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:53.240
I can just tell you maybe

00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:56.160
how I would have handled it, and I would
do it differently.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.340
You wouldn't have come back on the "Tonight Show"? If I had surrendered The Tonight Show and handed

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:04.657
it over to somebody publicly and wish
them well

00:10:04.657 --> 00:10:07.040
and then I don't would not

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.540
have come back six months
later...but that's me you know.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.140
Everyone's got their own you know way of doing
things.

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.900
What would you have done?

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.140
Done something else go someplace else I mean
that's just me...

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:25.940
He is equally disappointed with NBC the company where he worked most of his adult life and

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:31.560
with NBC Universal Chief Jeff Zucker who he has known since they were classmates at Harvard.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.420
Has Zucker called you?

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:35.020
No.

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.470
You haven't talked to Zucker since this

00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:38.800
offer was made to you?

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.700
That's right.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.170
You know at some point I'm sure I'm gonna

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.360
bump into these people...

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.340
and you know I'm
not sure we're going to be have our arms

00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.600
around each other and drinking beer and
singing old Irish fight songs

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.100
because I don't think they know any

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:07.400
You know I...I wish, this is gonna sound crazy, I do wish these people well.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.673
Jeff Zucker
was quoted as saying

00:11:09.673 --> 00:11:12.800
"At the end of the day, the viewers voted,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.100
and they didn't like Conan as the host of "The Tonight Show".

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.700
...Can I take back what I just said?

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.680
You take issue with that?

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:27.240
In my opinion, I don't think that's fair nor 
accurate, but he's entitled to his opinion

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:34.560
I think for anyone to say that
the results were in after six months

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.800
that doesn't ring true to me.

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.000
Oh they
said that the for the first time in

00:11:40.010 --> 00:11:43.240
history that "The Tonight Show" was losing
money

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.000
I don't see how that's...I honestly

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.360
don't see how that's possible.
it's really not possible. It isn't possible.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.740
Did you expect NBC to give you
more of a chance?

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:04.840
Absolutely...I...yes

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.300
Do you feel like it was a failure?

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:11.440
My Tonight Show?
No. Absolutely not.

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.740
Conan does agree with NBC's comments that it was a business decision motivated by money,

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:22.260
and he acknowledges that Leno had the more expensive contract and would have been even harder to let go.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.460
Some people have
reported that that NBC would have had to

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:27.480
pay him 150 million dollars?

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.340
mm-hmm yeah  
So if you look at it that way and you're

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:37.730
working at...let's say...I don't know you're
working for General Electric and you

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:46.220
tell them you know "there's 'this' to make
that guy go away or there's 'this'....

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:53.540
That decision is probably pretty clear
and I think in my gut I honestly believe

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:58.910
...everybody knows, that's what
happened, they did what they had to do,

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.940
and ok I get it
and the only thing I take exception to

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:09.380
is subsequently people saying "Well you
know Conan was losing money and you know

00:13:09.380 --> 00:13:14.120
actually he was murdering cats" What? Whatever.

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.660
Last month Conan finally pulled the
trigger on his future raising some

00:13:17.660 --> 00:13:22.700
eyebrows by signing on to do an 11
o'clock show for the cable channel TBS

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.160
and not with a broadcast network

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.350
Oh I do
not look down my nose at cable and I

00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:32.090
think anyone who does isn't paying
attention to television these days.

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:35.990
Because it is...this world is changing
very quickly.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:40.070
You got 30 million dollars that you
didn't have before you've got a very

00:13:40.070 --> 00:13:46.309
lucrative
new gig on TBS which has a...an audience

00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:46.920
that...

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.560
Very young audience.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.660
...custom-made for
you...it wasn't all bad?

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.980
That's the point I

00:13:53.989 --> 00:14:01.519
keep making. It's crucial to me that
anyone seeing this take they take

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.040
anything away from this it's

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:10.600
I'm fine, I'm doing great, I hope people still find

00:14:10.609 --> 00:14:15.409
me comedically absurd and ridiculous and
I and I don't regret anything.

00:14:15.409 --> 00:14:19.519
I and I don't regret anything. I do believe...

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:27.829
...and this might be my Catholic
upbringing or Irish magical thinking but

00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:31.099
I think things happen for a reason. I
really do

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:32.620
I thought the Lutherans believed that?

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:37.280
Oh my god...it is Lutherans. Okay

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:41.100
I believe that if I experience any joy in
life, I'll go to hell

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.180
That's what I believe.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.780
 

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.260
But you get my point

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:49.780
"They threw me out"

00:14:49.780 --> 00:14:52.020
"It happened fast"

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:54.360
"They said please don't let the door

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.700
"...hit your freckled Irish ASS."

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.460
"I hung around the house eating frosting from a jar"

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:03.500
"I got really into "Gossip Girl"

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.500
and sleeping in my car!"

00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.700
"Yes I'll survive!" "Yes I'll survive!"

00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:14.220
They kinda tried to kill me, but I made it out alive!"

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.600
"I've got all my life to live, I'VE GOT SO MANY SHOWS TO GIVE"

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.320
I'll survive! I will survive!

00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:33.700
I WILL SUUURRRRVVVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIVVVVVEEEEEE! :)
