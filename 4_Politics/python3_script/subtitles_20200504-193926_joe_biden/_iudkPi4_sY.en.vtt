00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:23.830 align:start position:0%
thing or no and for me it's simple to
 

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.190 align:start position:0%
thing or no and for me it's simple to

thought I was tough I'm kind of a
 

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:57.629 align:start position:0%
thought I was tough I'm kind of a
tender-hearted<00:28:54.489><c> character</c><00:28:55.389><c> and</c><00:28:55.659><c> and</c><00:28:56.320><c> I</c><00:28:57.279><c> was</c>

00:28:57.629 --> 00:28:57.639 align:start position:0%
tender-hearted character and and I was
 

00:28:57.639 --> 00:28:59.669 align:start position:0%
tender-hearted character and and I was
skipped<00:28:57.909><c> a</c><00:28:57.999><c> grade</c><00:28:58.029><c> and</c><00:28:58.479><c> I</c><00:28:58.869><c> was</c><00:28:59.109><c> small</c><00:28:59.379><c> for</c><00:28:59.589><c> my</c>

skipped a grade and I was small for my
 

00:28:59.679 --> 00:29:03.269 align:start position:0%
skipped a grade and I was small for my

00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%

00:29:07.109 --> 00:29:07.119 align:start position:0%
tough in the standard sense because I
 

00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:09.509 align:start position:0%
tough in the standard sense because I
was<00:29:07.359><c> small</c><00:29:07.659><c> and</c><00:29:07.869><c> because</c><00:29:07.989><c> I'd</c><00:29:08.229><c> been</c><00:29:08.409><c> put</c><00:29:08.889><c> ahead</c>

00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:09.519 align:start position:0%
was small and because I'd been put ahead
 

00:29:09.519 --> 00:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
was small and because I'd been put ahead

00:29:15.719 --> 00:29:15.729 align:start position:0%
at sports and that was kind of a problem
 

00:29:15.729 --> 00:29:17.849 align:start position:0%
at sports and that was kind of a problem
I<00:29:16.059><c> I</c><00:29:16.210><c> did</c><00:29:16.690><c> something</c><00:29:17.019><c> about</c><00:29:17.109><c> that</c><00:29:17.229><c> when</c><00:29:17.559><c> I</c><00:29:17.619><c> got</c>

00:29:17.849 --> 00:29:17.859 align:start position:0%
I I did something about that when I got
 

00:29:17.859 --> 00:29:21.089 align:start position:0%
I I did something about that when I got

00:29:25.529 --> 00:29:25.539 align:start position:0%

00:29:25.539 --> 00:29:27.269 align:start position:0%
kids but that was partly because most of

sort of off the radar entirely and so
 

00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:35.789 align:start position:0%

and maybe that was a certain amount of

00:29:40.769 --> 00:29:40.779 align:start position:0%
