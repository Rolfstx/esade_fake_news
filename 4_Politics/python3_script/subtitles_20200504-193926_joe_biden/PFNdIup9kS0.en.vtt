Designing and building a tiny house on wheels as a couple can be a real challenge

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.120
There's a lot of cooperation and compromise that goes into creating a space that can work

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.189
Well for both parties today

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.299
we've traveled to the Blue Mountains to visit a tiny house built by a couple who thanks to some wonderful teamwork have created themselves an

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.789
amazing home

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.040
Hi Lisa, right. How you doing? Good. Thank you guys to meet you get a met. How's it go? Mate? Good. Thanks. This home is

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.069
Absolutely stunning. It is very sleek. Stylish and modern, isn't it? Thank you now. Absolutely

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.889
I want to talk about the home but first let's talk about the land that you're on because this is something very special

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.809
Isn't it? Yeah, it's 16 acres and yeah, basically goes down to a creek

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.409
There's a little swimming hole down there and back up the other side of that Ridge there

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.669
So yeah, it's nice and secluded and how did you come to be on this property?

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.969
Basically about ten years ago, maybe eight years ago

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.819
there was a big bushfire that came through this area and

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.960
Burnt down a lot of the homes in this street and and in this area so we scored this block out of it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.560
basically

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.920
And then this area that you've built onto the house as well creates a really lovely space outdoors to enjoy it all doesn't it?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.160
Yeah

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:37.719
I think it's pretty important with tiny living to be able to expand outside and get that bit more use out of it

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.139
You know, can you get people over knurl in the tiny house? It's very cramped. You need to come out you can spread out

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.269
Yeah, not to mention. It's a nice view. You mean on a sunny day. It's really nice out here now

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.130
Let's talk about the tiny house. As far as Tiny's go. It is not very small

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.380
Is it I guess as far as Tiny's go, you know, it's a lot smaller than my full-sized house that I came from

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.189
But yeah, it's pretty lofty. What size is it?

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.639
the floor is nine meters long by

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.999
2.5 meters wide but because of the rakes on either end the roof is a couple of meters longer

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.890
Yeah, the height is four point three on that side to the bottom

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.109
Burying there's the chimney to take into account and some are multiple stuff

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.769
But yeah

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:28.479
I think one of the things in our loft we wanted to be able to stand up and walk around

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.929
Because we didn't want yeah, I'd have to crawl in or or anything like that

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.940
So I'm happy with it anyway

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.720
And now talk to me about the style of the house because it is really interesting how you've created this entirely black exterior

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.349
I guess it is a bit stark, but I just like black

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.800
and

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.829
I think it actually kind of blends into the valley. Like there's a few black features obviously from the file

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.240
And yeah, I think it kind of suits it and it looks quite striking here

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.339
So I think you've done a really good job with that. Thank you

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.770
What was it that actually inspired you to build a tiny house on wheels. That was me

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.000
I've been obsessed for a while watching reality TV shows about tiny houses. Googling them Instagram Facebook

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.369
You name it, you know hooking him up

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.339
Sort of wanted to build one or at least buy one at some stage and then I met Matt. So now I have one say

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.860
We met online

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.480
It was one

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.799
evening at the pub with my best friend and she wanted to play with my phone and my online dating apps and

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:36.490
It sort of sparked from there. We had a date at a very seedy pub. Yeah, that was her idea. Yep

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.700
I needed to get away play music. Yeah, yeah a

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.520
Station. Yep, and

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.390
Yeah, she really just wouldn't shut up about these tiny houses and I really hadn't seen much about them

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.510
But she's showing me all these Instagram accounts and I thought I didn't really think much of it at the time

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.209
but ya know she kept on about it, so

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.839
Yeah, once I've been - it seemed achievable, you know, and I do like a challenge so I thought no give it a go

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.660
What's the worst that can happen, you know throw a bunch of stuff out?

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:16.359
Yeah, it's so I guess I convinced you to build a tiny house build me. It's not here's actually hmm. Yeah, she did

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:21.429
Give me full full disclosure. I even gave him quite some time to bail out

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.659
No laying in bed and I said, are you sure you want to do this? I?

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.540
Absolutely positive you want to do this after the trailer was born. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.380
Once the frame was on that was it

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.649
And now this project was done as a DIY build wasn't it? Yeah majority of it

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.440
I did myself or with some help from friends and colleagues and stuff. So yeah, they did hate a lot of it, but I

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.539
You know in the end, I think everyone's pretty proud of it and you have a background in construction, don't you?

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.270
Yeah, I do run a bathroom and kitchen

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.419
renovation company and so a lot of it was sort of

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.079
Ideas that I'd seen around or things that I'd really wanted to try out, but I couldn't get anyone to go for so, okay

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.539
Yeah, I thought I'll do it myself, you know

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.289
Now before we go inside, I want to talk about the contraption at the back of the house, which I noticed walking down

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.300
What on earth is that?

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.229
that is my

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:22.508
Custom-designed cat Ron it seems simple when I first began doing it

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:26.499
But definitely had to lean on the notes to give me a hand with it

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:34.419
basically, I've got these two cats and they're my children and I didn't want anything to happen to them moving to the bush or I

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.180
Didn't want dead birds on my bed

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:38.900
and

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.829
Also, I didn't want the key litter inside because it's too small. So yeah works. Well, they love it actually

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:48.729
What a great idea. That is very clever

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.589
Well, can we take a look inside the house and check out what you've done on the inside? Let's do it. All right

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.590
Thank you very much after you

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.970
This is absolutely stunning you really do notice the extra height in here, don't you? Yeah you do

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.749
Now the design in here is really interesting and quite beautiful

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:20.739
I really love all the artistic features that you've put in this light feature at the top here is really special

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.769
Isn't it? Yeah, it's fun. Yeah good. Oh really a couple of lights fairy lights and some plants me

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.759
I did get it up there by myself somehow which was a challenge

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.880
But yeah

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.649
I think it came out pretty well for a couple of old rusty sheets of Steel Westover it certainly did and

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.159
Now tell me about the lounge area that we're in right now. This is very spacious

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.239
Yeah, one of the things that we just like to sort of lay on the couch and watch TV of the most most evenings

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:56.500
So we definitely wanted a full-sized couch, but we had to make it because we couldn't find anything with decent storage

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:58.099
so

00:06:58.099 --> 00:07:03.729
Yeah, I traded my couch from my other house to my sister and she made these cushions for us

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:08.408
And yeah, the kitchen guys made the drawers pull out and everything. So yeah

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:14.769
Definitely no compromise on the size of the TV here. No, no compromise. There was a bigger one intended

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.749
But well, there was a compromise exactly. I only bring my larger one, but

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:26.349
In truth. Yeah, even this is potentially like pushing it for being too big. Yeah, I can admit

00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:33.369
Yeah, and lots of room for a book storage and a few knickknacks as well

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:33.820
Yeah

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.929
Just bits and pieces some of my favorite some of the ones you can't really go past cookbooks

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:45.009
University textbooks those sorts of things and then the rest they're all giving away or put in storage or loaned out, you know

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.200
And you are studying at University at the moment

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.800
I am I'm doing a bachelor's degree in Indigenous Studies through the University of South Australia

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:53.590
And you've got plenty of space to study in here. Yeah

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:57.970
so most of the time we watch telly down here and we have a loft I

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:02.560
Can go and study and just take some noise-cancelling headphones me. Everything's good

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:11.200
Fantastic, and now this over here is that your cat door it certainly is those little suckers come up a shoot out

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:17.110
Through the side of the couch and then out this door just here and 2:00 in the morning when they go in and out flat

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:23.319
Out it's pretty entertaining that is such a clever idea. And then you've got a really nice wood fire here as well

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:30.760
Yeah hasn't been cold enough yet to really get it going. But we did one test runs and it yeah, it's pretty great

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:36.039
Yeah, and then the kitchen this is very spacious

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.799
Absolutely, no compromises in here other know we wanted a full size kitchen in here

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.750
I came from a very small house with no kitchen and Matt came from a very big house

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:52.299
We've quite a large kitchen. So it sort of meet in the middle. You've even got these spectacular marble bench tops

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:56.290
Now, this is something you do not often see in a tiny house. No, definitely not

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.729
Yeah, I think I potentially would have just done it in timber if I could do it again

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:06.880
I just gotta get some used to you know, designing things that way so yeah, I'm stoked for them though

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:11.079
Absolutely now, can you walk me through the design and the features in this kitchen?

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.870
Yeah, so we have a full size stone

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:19.719
We've got a full size microwave and oven and afraid to be asleep. And then we've got our Butler sink

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.840
We've got our pots and pans in there

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.420
dishwasher I

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.570
Don't necessarily know what's in that drawer. They skirt

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:32.180
His glasses glasses and tea towels in there and help away top away and then we could elect crockery

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:37.279
Things like that upstairs and I really like how you've managed to build a lot of the appliances into the stairs

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.220
Yeah, we've noticed a quite a few tiny houses

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:46.610
Sort of in and around that have their storage in their stairs and all something that we thought would be good for us

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.400
You know

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:51.110
we have pantry in these sort of four drawers and then we've got our

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:57.920
extra stairs that do have more storage in them for knickknacks and bits and pieces and again the lighting in this space is very

00:09:58.200 --> 00:09:59.930
Well done. Yeah. Thank you

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:03.799
We wanted a bit of understand lighting when you get up at 4 o clock in the morning

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.599
You do want to be able to get down the stairs. So that's one. It also doesn't wake the person still in bed

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.649
And then moving over here what is going on with these mirrors?

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.010
There are wardrobes right? She's in hers

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.039
Hey good lots of hanging storage

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.770
And then we've got a bunch of drawers

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:27.079
which open up all on soft clothing so you can slam a wall much as you like and

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:29.690
then we let's take a

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:34.999
Walk in wardrobe light now that really does give you both quite a lot of closet storage, doesn't it? Yeah, we do

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.840
It means we've got 1h, and we're not fighting over hanging space or anything like that and mine is obviously more messy

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.030
That's not paranoid about mine

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:50.389
Quite a clever idea doing that as well and sort of having that as a transition between the bathroom and the living space

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:55.579
Yeah, definitely means you're not sort of walking straight into a kitchen. You've got a bit of something in between

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:04.399
Absolutely, and now I have to ask you about the floors because this is really beautiful how you've done this transition from the timber floors

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.280
And to the tiles this must have taken forever

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.330
Yeah

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:13.490
It did so first step was the Tyler doing his bed

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:19.519
and he basically tiled it flat and chiseled them all the ones that I marked and then the next step was the

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.480
carpenter and I

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:27.529
Making up paper templates and jigsaw hang out the timber to fit so I don't think he'd do it again in a hurry

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:29.720
But I'm happy with the way it worked out. I

00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:36.619
Bit, I mean you can see how much work has gone into that, but it really is a very artistic result

00:11:36.620 --> 00:11:38.280
So well done on that

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:43.049
and then behind us is your bathroom and wow, this is very

00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:44.890
impressive

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:47.280
It is definitely a feature of the house

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:52.770
Yeah something I definitely had to try and get right building bathrooms for a living. So

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:59.760
Yeah few ideas in here. I've always wanted to sort of try but the raked wall was a challenge and yeah

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.419
I love a double shower. Just someone our mind each day

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:10.409
Yeah, I never thought I would see a tiny house with a double shower. You know, the only one who said that

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.919
That is really impressive now

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.390
Obviously the home is a little bit bigger

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.379
But you've definitely given a priority of space here in the bathroom heaven here

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.739
You do actually spend a lot of time in here surprisingly

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.710
You know you get dressed in here you get undressed in here

00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:32.999
you have a shower you often in front of the mirrors doing whatever shaving or

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:40.260
Whatever. So you need it sort of a nice space and somewhere that we can both be in at the same time lots of mirrors

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:44.580
In here as well lots of mirrors. These are actually storage as well so you can open them up

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.609
That's he's in hers again means they're not sort of in each other's spaces a tiny house often you are saying

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.650
If we sort of keep things separate like that

00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:58.079
Then we're not gonna sort of clash in any way and then you've got a flushing toilet in here. We have a flushing toilet

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.150
Yes. Yeah, we used the existing septic so we didn't have to do a composting toilet

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:10.530
Much to lose his disappointment because she really wanted one but there was no way I was gonna do that. So

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.440
Yeah, definitely a flushing toilet

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:19.349
Well, I guess it had to be some compromise this somewhere you did get the tiny house after all do you get the tiny house?

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:23.339
So yeah, I'm happy fair enough and then should we check out the upstairs?

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.890
Absolutely

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:30.689
Now it's really interesting to me how you have divided up the loft areas into two different

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:34.530
Sections and then been able to connect them via this walkway here

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:42.120
Yeah, we made our master loft. Obviously. It's a king-sized bed in it with two little side tables

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.839
There's not a whole lot of room beside the bed thing. You can squeeze in and out

00:13:45.839 --> 00:13:49.349
You still have to shimmy down the bed to get in and out of the bed. That's okay

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:53.190
I think having a walkway makes this can loft a lot more usable

00:13:53.440 --> 00:14:00.359
Just having to get your mates to get up a ladder or maybe your mom or whatever. Some people probably wouldn't make it so

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.820
Yeah, I think overall makes that a lot more usable space here as well

00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:10.919
This is where you really notice the extra height and it's not that much extra height

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.459
But it's enough to enable you to stand before you get into bed

00:14:14.459 --> 00:14:19.169
And it really just makes this whole area feel so much more spacious

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:20.130
Yeah

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:26.880
it does mattaniah particularly tall but being able to stand up was really important in our design rather than

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:34.019
Somewhat feeling like they're just an additional space. I think it really makes this feel like a second floor to the place

00:14:34.019 --> 00:14:36.019
So, yeah, absolutely

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.579
I mean, I'm six foot four and I can almost

00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:44.939
Stand up in here without touching my head. And in fact when I'm under the skylight, I absolutely can do that

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:49.229
Yeah, so it really goes to show there's a lot of extra room that has been created in this

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.019
The roof windows as well

00:14:52.570 --> 00:14:58.439
What a great feature in here. I mean, it's lovely how you've extended them along the entire line of the roof

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:03.839
So you've always got a very dynamic view of the changing sky, don't you? Yeah, you do at nighttime

00:15:03.839 --> 00:15:07.078
It's really lovely. You can see them stars during the day

00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:11.339
It does create a bit of an oven, but we'd have put the blinds on so it's not so bad

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.919
But yeah, it really creates a lot of extra space. You don't feel so enclosed now

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.149
You've been living in the tiny house for four months is the home living up to your expectations

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:23.579
Absolutely. Yeah

00:15:23.579 --> 00:15:28.649
I came from a small house. So it was the transition was pretty easy for me coming from a bigger house

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:33.149
Yeah, it did take me some convincing to sort of wrap my head around the idea at first

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.420
but I can genuinely say I don't miss anything from my

00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:39.420
large normal house

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:43.260
Designing it and building it together was a fun thing to do as well, you know

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:48.839
Yeah, I'm sure we learnt a lot about each other in that process. So yeah, we did good

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.010
Well, and I think one of the things that you've done really well is in the design of this house

00:15:53.010 --> 00:15:53.680
you've

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.739
obviously really taken a lot of

00:15:56.019 --> 00:15:58.739
consideration into what your individual needs are and the things that were

00:15:58.810 --> 00:16:02.609
Important to both of you and combine them to make sure that they were present in this home

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.769
That was the whole idea is like if you are going to move in together

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:13.179
You do need to make sure that you both have spaces that are specifically for you or that you specifically need

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.959
So yeah, it's important. Even if it means you have to end up with a flushing toilet

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.390
Even if it means I've done it with a flushing toilet

00:16:20.450 --> 00:16:27.009
No, no place is perfect. No, that's right. And now can we talk about the budget not including the land?

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:31.389
What was the cost of realizing this home? That's a good question?

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:34.540
I did not add up every sort of nickel and dime

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.769
There were a few favors and stuff in there and a lot of that I did myself

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:42.579
So, yeah, I think it probably worked out around

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.440
eighty

00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.440
Ninety thousand or something like that

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:54.190
I think eighty thousand dollars is a remarkable budget and obviously that also does reflect that you've put a lot of Labor into it yourself

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:57.370
And no doubt a few boxes of beer in the process

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:04.239
So the tiny house is pretty much a dream come true now

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:11.739
I'm gonna find something else to want and come true for you. Yeah, it's an achievement for me. Yeah

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.480
We love the space

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.930
we've only been here a couple months four months, but

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.809
With making it out

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.380
Now, I think it's starting to feel like home

00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:31.509
Yeah, it's actually being really nice just being able to be in the space finally finishing the space off. And yeah

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.610
I can't really imagine wanting any more house

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:42.220
No more house, isn't it? This is all you need. This is all we're getting. Yeah, the design of this home is absolutely

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:48.309
Beautiful. I can really see how much love and attention you have poured into the construction of this home

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:55.629
The features are beautiful. The land that it sits on is truly spectacular. Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful home with me

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:58.030
Thank you. Thank you. Thanks for coming. My pleasure

00:17:58.030 --> 00:18:03.369
I am so very impressed with the quality of design that's gone into this house

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.790
Every inch has been incredibly well thought-out

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:12.640
Met and Lisa both knew exactly what they wanted in a home and they've worked hard to make it happen

00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:19.570
And the result is this a beautiful modern and very functional home that is perfectly meeting both of their needs

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.780
You
