to<00:00:31.890><c> get</c><00:00:31.980><c> home</c><00:00:32.189><c> but</c><00:00:32.369><c> let's</c><00:00:32.489><c> get</c><00:00:32.700><c> cracking</c>

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 align:start position:0%
to get home but let's get cracking
 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.900 align:start position:0%
to get home but let's get cracking
because<00:00:33.090><c> we've</c><00:00:33.420><c> got</c><00:00:33.540><c> about</c><00:00:33.750><c> well</c><00:00:34.290><c> probably</c><00:00:34.910><c> 12</c>

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 align:start position:0%
because we've got about well probably 12

because we've got about well probably 12
minutes<00:00:36.300><c> is</c><00:00:36.420><c> my</c><00:00:36.600><c> talk</c><00:00:36.870><c> maybe</c><00:00:37.110><c> might</c><00:00:37.410><c> go</c><00:00:37.590><c> for</c><00:00:37.770><c> 15</c>

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
minutes is my talk maybe might go for 15
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.670 align:start position:0%
minutes is my talk maybe might go for 15
so<00:00:39.059><c> don't</c><00:00:39.390><c> panic</c><00:00:39.600><c> if</c><00:00:39.809><c> that</c><00:00:39.960><c> thing</c><00:00:40.170><c> goes</c><00:00:40.320><c> over</c>

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
so don't panic if that thing goes over
 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.959 align:start position:0%
so don't panic if that thing goes over
so<00:00:42.200><c> here</c><00:00:43.200><c> we</c><00:00:43.320><c> go</c><00:00:43.469><c> the</c><00:00:43.680><c> mathematics</c><00:00:44.280><c> of</c><00:00:44.460><c> weight</c>

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 align:start position:0%
so here we go the mathematics of weight
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.569 align:start position:0%
so here we go the mathematics of weight
loss<00:00:45.210><c> well</c><00:00:45.960><c> let</c><00:00:46.079><c> me</c><00:00:46.110><c> start</c><00:00:46.350><c> with</c><00:00:46.440><c> this</c><00:00:46.680><c> last</c>

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 align:start position:0%

that's<00:02:44.540><c> where</c><00:02:44.780><c> I</c><00:02:44.810><c> go</c>

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's where I go
 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.520 align:start position:0%
that's where I go
well<00:02:46.940><c> basically</c><00:02:47.120><c> you</c><00:02:47.570><c> burn</c><00:02:47.750><c> it</c><00:02:47.930><c> up</c><00:02:48.020><c> as</c><00:02:48.170><c> energy</c>

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 align:start position:0%
well basically you burn it up as energy
 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.370 align:start position:0%
well basically you burn it up as energy
darkness<00:02:48.980><c> is</c><00:02:49.220><c> energy</c><00:02:49.610><c> heat</c><00:02:49.940><c> energy</c><00:02:50.060><c> burnt</c><00:02:50.930><c> in</c>

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 align:start position:0%
darkness is energy heat energy burnt in

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.750 align:start position:0%
energy yeah you got me there I'm not
quite<00:03:01.100><c> sure</c><00:03:03.550><c> mmm</c>

that's what fat is kind of made out of
 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.980 align:start position:0%
that's what fat is kind of made out of

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 align:start position:0%
is not fat
 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.200 align:start position:0%

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:26.210 align:start position:0%
so how does that become fat well it
 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.150 align:start position:0%
so how does that become fat well it
doesn't<00:06:26.570><c> just</c><00:06:27.110><c> like</c><00:06:27.290><c> that</c><00:06:27.500><c> it</c><00:06:27.590><c> becomes</c><00:06:27.860><c> sugar</c>

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't just like that it becomes sugar

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519 align:start position:0%
metabolize that sugar well then it's

water now if you pour it onto a balloon
 

00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
water now if you pour it onto a balloon
the<00:10:44.070><c> balloon</c><00:10:44.100><c> does</c><00:10:44.610><c> not</c><00:10:44.820><c> pop</c><00:10:45.120><c> which</c><00:10:45.839><c> is</c>

oxygen turns into a liquid at minus 183
 

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.070 align:start position:0%
oxygen turns into a liquid at minus 183
so<00:10:56.490><c> the</c><00:10:56.730><c> oxygen</c><00:10:57.210><c> in</c><00:10:57.330><c> the</c><00:10:57.360><c> balloon</c><00:10:57.630><c> is</c><00:10:57.780><c> turning</c>

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.080 align:start position:0%
so the oxygen in the balloon is turning
 

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:01.910 align:start position:0%

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
go check that with the hydrogen's
 

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:28.669 align:start position:0%
go check that with the hydrogen's
because<00:16:27.929><c> they're</c><00:16:28.079><c> gonna</c><00:16:28.170><c> go</c><00:16:28.350><c> out</c><00:16:28.439><c> with</c><00:16:28.529><c> some</c>

00:16:28.669 --> 00:16:28.679 align:start position:0%
because they're gonna go out with some
 

00:16:28.679 --> 00:16:30.859 align:start position:0%
because they're gonna go out with some
hydrogen<00:16:29.069><c> and</c><00:16:29.399><c> now</c><00:16:29.879><c> I</c><00:16:29.910><c> can</c><00:16:30.389><c> figure</c><00:16:30.569><c> out</c><00:16:30.660><c> the</c>

00:16:37.369 --> 00:16:37.379 align:start position:0%
my fat so there's the totals and now
 

00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
my fat so there's the totals and now
we've<00:16:37.559><c> just</c><00:16:37.589><c> got</c><00:16:37.829><c> to</c><00:16:37.920><c> divide</c><00:16:38.160><c> it</c><00:16:38.279><c> by</c><00:16:38.399><c> the</c><00:16:38.459><c> total</c>

00:16:39.079 --> 00:16:39.089 align:start position:0%
we've just got to divide it by the total

we've just got to divide it by the total
total<00:16:39.720><c> and</c><00:16:39.869><c> you</c><00:16:40.589><c> get</c><00:16:41.149><c> 84%</c><00:16:42.149><c> will</c><00:16:43.019><c> go</c><00:16:43.139><c> out</c><00:16:43.230><c> as</c>

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:43.350 align:start position:0%
total and you get 84% will go out as
 

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:46.189 align:start position:0%
total and you get 84% will go out as

00:16:52.189 --> 00:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
big fat question 84% of fat is exhaled
 

00:16:52.199 --> 00:16:54.859 align:start position:0%
big fat question 84% of fat is exhaled
16%<00:16:52.889><c> is</c><00:16:52.980><c> excreted</c><00:16:53.459><c> as</c><00:16:53.639><c> water</c><00:16:53.939><c> somehow</c><00:16:54.569><c> it</c><00:16:54.749><c> can</c>

00:16:54.859 --> 00:16:54.869 align:start position:0%
16% is excreted as water somehow it can
 

00:16:54.869 --> 00:16:57.340 align:start position:0%
16% is excreted as water somehow it can

00:16:57.350 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
be in your urine and your feces sweat
that<00:16:58.350><c> means</c><00:16:59.059><c> that</c><00:17:00.059><c> 10</c><00:17:00.480><c> kilograms</c><00:17:01.170><c> of</c><00:17:01.379><c> fat</c>

00:17:01.759 --> 00:17:01.769 align:start position:0%
that means that 10 kilograms of fat
 

00:17:01.769 --> 00:17:05.210 align:start position:0%
that means that 10 kilograms of fat
