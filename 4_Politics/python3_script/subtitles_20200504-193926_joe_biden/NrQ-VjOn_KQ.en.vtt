00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:02.070
 President Obama: Hello. 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.030
 (applause) 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.010
 good afternoon. 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.027
 To have the opportunity to talk to you all in Shanghai, 

00:00:13.027 --> 00:00:16.060
 I am deeply honored. 

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:21.047
 I want to thank President Yang of Fudan University, 

00:00:21.047 --> 00:00:24.030
 Thanks for his hospitality and warm welcome. 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.003
 I also want to thank our excellent ambassador 

00:00:28.003 --> 00:00:32.063
 Hong Bopei, he represents the profound relationship between our two countries 

00:00:32.063 --> 00:00:34.077
 And mutual respect. 

00:00:34.077 --> 00:00:37.057
 I don't know what he said just now, but I hope he said it well. 

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:40.090
 (laughter) 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.060
 I’m going to make an opening statement today, 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.047
 But what I really want to do is answer 

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:50.070
 Questions, not only answer the questions raised by the students present, 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.050
 At the same time also answer some questions raised from the Internet, 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.057
 These questions were asked by some students 

00:00:59.057 --> 00:01:02.060
 Ambassador He Hongbopei proposed it on his behalf. 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.070
 Sorry, my Chinese is not as good as yours 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:13.017
 English, but I look forward to this opportunity to talk to you. 

00:01:13.017 --> 00:01:15.063
 This is my first visit to China, 

00:01:15.063 --> 00:01:20.070
 I am very excited to see your magnificent country. 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.043
 In Shanghai, we have seen the development of global attention 

00:01:23.043 --> 00:01:28.007
 Towering buildings, 

00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:31.087
 Busy streets, entrepreneurial dynamics. 

00:01:31.087 --> 00:01:35.053
 These are all signs that China has stepped into the 21st century. 

00:01:35.053 --> 00:01:40.010
 I also look forward to seeing us 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.057
 Historic site with a long history in China. 

00:01:43.057 --> 00:01:47.057
 I will be in Beijing tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, 

00:01:47.057 --> 00:01:51.027
 Hope to have a chance to see the spectacular Forbidden City 

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:53.087
 And the miraculous Great Wall. 

00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:57.027
 Indeed, this is a rich history, 

00:01:57.027 --> 00:02:00.047
 A country full of confidence in the hope of the future. 

00:02:00.047 --> 00:02:05.027
 The same is true of the relationship between our two countries. 

00:02:05.027 --> 00:02:08.080
 no doubt, 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.047
 Shanghai is a city of great significance in the history of US-China relations. 

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:18.023
 It is here that the "Shanghai Communique" issued 37 years ago 

00:02:18.023 --> 00:02:21.037
 Opened the governments and peoples of our two countries 

00:02:21.037 --> 00:02:24.017
 Get in touch with a new chapter of communication. 

00:02:24.017 --> 00:02:27.040
 However, the link between the United States and this city and this country 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.077
 It can be traced back to a farther past, until the early days of American independence. 

00:02:32.077 --> 00:02:37.053
 In 1784, George Washington, our founding father 

00:02:37.053 --> 00:02:39.097
 Presided over the launching ceremony of the "Chinese Queen". 

00:02:39.097 --> 00:02:43.047
 This boat headed to the coast of China, 

00:02:43.047 --> 00:02:47.003
 Seek business with the Qing Dynasty. 

00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:49.043
 Washington wants to see this American flag-flagged ship heading for 

00:02:49.043 --> 00:02:53.050
 Around the world, forging new bonds with countries like China. 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.063
 This is the usual American wish-- 

00:02:55.063 --> 00:02:57.093
 Hope to reach a new horizon, 

00:02:57.093 --> 00:03:02.020
 Establish new and mutually beneficial partnerships. 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:04.057
 In the next two centuries, 

00:03:04.057 --> 00:03:07.070
 The torrent of history has made our relations 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.077
 Going in many different directions, 

00:03:10.077 --> 00:03:13.093
 But even in the turbulent years, 

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:19.023
 The people of the two countries have also seized the opportunity to develop deep, even extraordinary relationships. 

00:03:19.023 --> 00:03:22.030
 For example, the American people will never forget, 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.043
 During World War II, American pilots were shot down over China, 

00:03:25.043 --> 00:03:29.060
 Chinese citizens risk losing everything 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.083
 Take care of them. 

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:34.060
 Chinese veterans who participated in World War II are still warmly welcomed 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.077
 American veterans who revisited 

00:03:37.077 --> 00:03:41.067
 They once fought there to help China be liberated from occupation. 

00:03:41.067 --> 00:03:44.090
 Nearly 40 years ago, a simple table tennis game 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:48.007
 Brought about the thawing of relations between the two countries, 

00:03:48.007 --> 00:03:52.003
 Let us establish another relationship between our two countries. 

00:03:52.003 --> 00:03:54.090
 This contact is surprising, but it has contributed to its success, 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.097
 Because despite the many differences between us, 

00:03:57.097 --> 00:04:02.057
 But our common humanity and common curiosity can emerge from it. 

00:04:02.057 --> 00:04:05.060
 As an American table tennis player recalled his visit to China: 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.013
 "The people there are just like us... this country and the United States 

00:04:09.013 --> 00:04:12.047
 There are many similarities and differences. " 

00:04:12.047 --> 00:04:15.050
 Needless to say, this little opportunity brought 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.013
 The advent of the "Shanghai Communique" eventually led to the United States and China 

00:04:19.013 --> 00:04:24.033
 Established formal diplomatic relations in 1979. 

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:28.063
 Please see how much progress we have made in the next 30 years. 

00:04:28.063 --> 00:04:32.010
 In 1979, the US-China trade volume 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:40.007
 About 5 billion US dollars, today, the annual trade volume has exceeded 400 billion US dollars. 

00:04:40.007 --> 00:04:44.040
 Trade affects the lives of the two peoples in many ways, 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.067
 Many components in American computers 

00:04:47.067 --> 00:04:50.090
 And the clothes we wear are imported from China, 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.020
 We export to China the machinery your industry needs. 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.090
 This kind of trade can create more jobs on both sides of the Pacific, 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.023
 Let our people live a higher quality life. 

00:05:01.023 --> 00:05:03.010
 As demand tends to balance, 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.007
 The scope of prosperity will be further expanded. 

00:05:07.007 --> 00:05:09.087
 In 1979, political cooperation between the United States and China 

00:05:09.087 --> 00:05:13.070
 Mainly based on competitors faced by both parties 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.060
 Soviet Union. 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.023
 Now we enjoy a positive, constructive and comprehensive relationship, 

00:05:19.023 --> 00:05:23.070
 For us on the key global issues of our time 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.037
 Opening the door to partnership 

00:05:27.037 --> 00:05:31.040
 These issues include: economic recovery and clean energy development, stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.070
 And the effects of climate change, in Asia and around the world 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.027
 Promote peace and security. 

00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:42.003
 All these issues are the content of my meeting with President Hu tomorrow. 

00:05:42.003 --> 00:05:44.050
 The content of the talks with Chairman Hu. 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.067
 In 1979, the contact between our two peoples was very limited. 

00:05:49.067 --> 00:05:53.097
 Today, we saw the curiosity of the table tennis players 

00:05:53.097 --> 00:05:58.040
 Has become a bond in many fields, 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.063
 Number of Chinese students in the United States 

00:06:01.063 --> 00:06:06.070
 Ranked second, and among American students, 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.047
 The number of people learning Chinese has increased by 50%. 

00:06:10.047 --> 00:06:15.060
 There are nearly 200 friendly cities in our two countries that connect our communities. 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:20.093
 U.S. and Chinese scientists collaborate on new research and discoveries. 

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:24.013
 And Yao Ming is just a sign that our two peoples love basketball. 

00:06:24.013 --> 00:06:27.083
 Regrettably, I cannot watch this trip 

00:06:27.083 --> 00:06:32.050
 The game of the Shanghai Sharks. 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.073
 The relationship between our two countries has been accompanied by a period of positive change, 

00:06:34.073 --> 00:06:39.000
 This is not accidental. 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.080
 China has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.023
 This achievement is unprecedented, 

00:06:46.023 --> 00:06:49.057
 At the same time, China is also playing a bigger role in global issues. 

00:06:49.057 --> 00:06:52.047
 While the United States promoted the end of the cold war, 

00:06:52.047 --> 00:06:55.003
 The economy has also grown, 

00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:59.000
 The people's living standards have improved. 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.007
 There is a famous saying in China: 

00:07:02.007 --> 00:07:05.017
 "Know the old and know the new." 

00:07:05.017 --> 00:07:09.037
 Of course, we have also encountered setbacks and challenges in the past 30 years, 

00:07:09.037 --> 00:07:14.000
 Our relationship is not without differences and difficulties. 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.017
 However, the concept of "we must be opponents" is not doomed 

00:07:19.017 --> 00:07:21.077
 -This is not the case when looking back. 

00:07:21.077 --> 00:07:24.017
 Thanks to our cooperation, 

00:07:24.017 --> 00:07:29.007
 Both the United States and China are more prosperous and safer. 

00:07:29.007 --> 00:07:32.010
 We have seen that we 

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:36.090
 Common interests and mutual respect to achieve what can be achieved. 

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.033
 However, the success of this contact depends on 

00:07:39.033 --> 00:07:43.063
 Understanding depends on continuing open and open dialogue, 

00:07:43.063 --> 00:07:48.023
 Understand and learn from each other. 

00:07:48.023 --> 00:07:52.083
 As the American table tennis player mentioned earlier-- 

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:55.033
 As people, we have many things in common, 

00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:58.060
 But there are some differences between our two countries. 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.053
 I think every country must plan its own direction. 

00:08:02.053 --> 00:08:07.060
 China is an ancient country with a profound culture. 

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.080
 The United States is relatively young, 

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.013
 Its culture consists of immigrants from many different countries 

00:08:14.013 --> 00:08:17.073
 And the founding program that guides my country’s democratic system 

00:08:17.073 --> 00:08:20.030
 Formed. 

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.097
 These programs set forth a simple and clear vision of human affairs, 

00:08:23.097 --> 00:08:27.007
 And contains some core principles- 

00:08:27.007 --> 00:08:29.080
 Whether men and women are born equal, 

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.063
 All enjoy certain basic rights; 

00:08:32.063 --> 00:08:35.007
 The government should reflect public opinion, 

00:08:35.007 --> 00:08:39.030
 And respond to the wishes of the people; business should be open, 

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:43.047
 Information should flow freely; 

00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:48.090
 Judicial protection should come from the rule of law rather than the rule of man. 

00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:51.033
 Of course, our history is not without 

00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:53.030
 Difficult chapter. 

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.077
 In many ways, for a long time, 

00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:59.030
 We must achieve our commitment to all people through struggle, 

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:04.053
 Create a more perfect union. 

00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:07.043
 We have fought a very painful Civil War, 

00:09:07.043 --> 00:09:11.030
 Liberate part of our population from slavery. 

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.073
 Women have the right to vote, 

00:09:14.073 --> 00:09:17.070
 Labor wins the right to organize, 

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:20.023
 Immigrants from all over the world are fully accepted- 

00:09:20.023 --> 00:09:22.053
 These were all achieved after a period of time. 

00:09:22.053 --> 00:09:25.063
 African Americans still live in isolation and inequality even after they are free, 

00:09:25.063 --> 00:09:28.097
 They worked tirelessly 

00:09:28.097 --> 00:09:32.047
 Only then will we win the full and equal rights. 

00:09:32.047 --> 00:09:34.037
 None of this has been easy. 

00:09:34.037 --> 00:09:37.090
 However, due to our firm belief in these core principles, 

00:09:37.090 --> 00:09:43.050
 We have made progress, and these principles have guided us through the darkest storm. 

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:46.037
 This is why Lincoln can stand up in the Civil War 

00:09:46.037 --> 00:09:49.097
 And announced that this is a test one 

00:09:49.097 --> 00:09:53.080
 A country conceived in freedom, "faithful to the principle of equality in life" 

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.093
 Whether the struggle can last forever. 

00:09:57.093 --> 00:10:00.073
 This is why Dr. Martin Luther King was able to stand on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, 

00:10:00.073 --> 00:10:03.080
 Require our country to practice its beliefs 

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.057
 True meaning. 

00:10:06.057 --> 00:10:10.013
 This is why immigrants from China to Kenya 

00:10:10.013 --> 00:10:13.093
 Be able to settle on our country's land; 

00:10:13.093 --> 00:10:18.097
 Why everyone who seeks opportunities can get opportunities; 

00:10:18.097 --> 00:10:22.093
 Why do people like me who have encountered difficulty in voting in certain parts of the United States less than 50 years ago, 

00:10:22.093 --> 00:10:26.050
 Can now serve as the president of this country. 

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:29.023
 That’s why the United States has been around the world for these core principles 

00:10:29.023 --> 00:10:31.083
 And shouted loudly. 

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:35.027
 We do not seek to impose any political system on any other country, 

00:10:35.027 --> 00:10:41.090
 But we also don’t think the principles we advocate are 

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.053
 Unique to our country. 

00:10:45.053 --> 00:10:48.050
 Freedom of expression and religious belief—— 

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:51.087
 Freedom of access to information and political participation 

00:10:51.087 --> 00:10:54.037
 We believe that these freedoms are universal rights, 

00:10:54.037 --> 00:10:56.043
 Everyone deserves it, 

00:10:56.043 --> 00:10:58.080
 Including minorities and religious minorities, 

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:03.080
 Whether it is in the United States, China or any other country. 

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:08.003
 It is the respect and guidance of universal rights that guides 

00:11:08.003 --> 00:11:10.073
 The United States is open to other countries, 

00:11:10.073 --> 00:11:13.013
 Respect various cultures, 

00:11:13.013 --> 00:11:15.057
 Committed to compliance with international law, 

00:11:15.057 --> 00:11:18.060
 And have faith in the future. 

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:22.017
 These are all things you should know about the United States. 

00:11:22.017 --> 00:11:26.000
 I also know that China has a lot to learn. 

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.083
 Look around this great city—— 

00:11:28.083 --> 00:11:32.033
 Look around this hall-I am sure that our two countries 

00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:34.050
 There is one very important thing in common, 

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:37.037
 That is our belief in the future. 

00:11:37.037 --> 00:11:42.003
 Neither the United States nor China wants to be satisfied with what has been achieved and halts. 

00:11:42.003 --> 00:11:44.020
 Although China is an ancient country, 

00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:47.067
 But you are obviously full of confidence and ambition for the future 

00:11:47.067 --> 00:11:50.050
 And make the younger generation better than this generation 

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.000
 More determined to act. 

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.007
 We not only admire China’s growing economy, 

00:11:55.007 --> 00:11:57.053
 Also appreciate your extremely extraordinary efforts in scientific research- 

00:11:57.053 --> 00:12:00.087
 From the infrastructure you build to the technology you use, 

00:12:00.087 --> 00:12:04.090
 All reflect this effort. 

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:08.007
 China is now the world's largest Internet user — 

00:12:08.007 --> 00:12:10.070
 This is why we are very happy to use the Internet as the event 

00:12:10.070 --> 00:12:12.087
 Part of the reason. 

00:12:12.087 --> 00:12:16.037
 This country currently has the world’s largest mobile phone network, 

00:12:16.037 --> 00:12:19.017
 It is investing in development that can sustain sustainable growth, 

00:12:19.017 --> 00:12:22.003
 New energy that can cope with climate change 

00:12:22.003 --> 00:12:24.037
 I look forward to tomorrow in this vital area 

00:12:24.037 --> 00:12:29.003
 Deepen the cooperation between the two countries. 

00:12:29.003 --> 00:12:32.030
 However, most importantly, 

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:35.060
 I see the future of China in you-the wisdom, dedication and dreams of the younger generation 

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.010
 Will play a huge role in shaping the 21st century. 

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.077
 I have said it many times, and I believe our world is 

00:12:41.077 --> 00:12:44.080
 Closely connected. 

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.067
 The work we do, the prosperity we build, 

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:51.017
 The environment we protect, and the safety we seek-- 

00:12:51.017 --> 00:12:53.063
 All of this is common. 

00:12:53.063 --> 00:12:57.027
 Given this interconnectedness, in the 21st century, 

00:12:57.027 --> 00:13:02.073
 Power should no longer be a zero-sum game; 

00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:05.047
 The successful development of a country should not be at the expense of other countries. 

00:13:05.047 --> 00:13:08.070
 This is why the United States firmly stated that we do not seek 

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:10.067
 Contain China's rise. 

00:13:10.067 --> 00:13:13.077
 On the contrary, we welcome China to become a strong, prosperous, 

00:13:13.077 --> 00:13:17.030
 Successful members-one from you 

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.073
 Among the rights, strength and creativity of every Chinese 

00:13:19.073 --> 00:13:24.003
 China gaining power. 

00:13:24.003 --> 00:13:28.047
 Go back to the old sentence mentioned earlier-look back. 

00:13:28.047 --> 00:13:31.027
 We know that big powers choose cooperation rather than confrontation 

00:13:31.027 --> 00:13:33.077
 Will bring greater benefits. 

00:13:33.077 --> 00:13:35.070
 This is a lesson that mankind has continuously learned, 

00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:40.017
 There are many examples in the history of relations between our two countries. 

00:13:40.017 --> 00:13:44.030
 I am convinced that cooperation must go beyond cooperation between governments. 

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.050
 Cooperation must be rooted in our people— 

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.070
 Rooted in our joint research, our business activities, 

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:54.007
 What we have learned, and even our sports. 

00:13:54.007 --> 00:13:57.033
 These bridges must be made by young people like you 

00:13:57.033 --> 00:14:00.060
 Constructed together with young Americans. 

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.070
 Therefore, I am happy to announce that the United States is preparing 

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.017
 Number of U.S. students who will study in China 

00:14:06.017 --> 00:14:08.093
 A substantial increase to 100,000. 

00:14:08.093 --> 00:14:11.073
 This exchange is a clear commitment to establishing links between our two peoples, 

00:14:11.073 --> 00:14:15.007
 There is no doubt that you will help decide 

00:14:15.007 --> 00:14:17.007
 The fate of the 21st century. 

00:14:17.007 --> 00:14:19.047
 I fully believe that for the United States, the best messenger 

00:14:19.047 --> 00:14:22.073
 There is nothing like our young people. 

00:14:22.073 --> 00:14:25.043
 Because they are as talented and energetic as you 

00:14:25.043 --> 00:14:29.027
 Full of optimism about the history chapter to be written. 

00:14:29.027 --> 00:14:33.093
 So let this move be the next step in our steady search for cooperation, 

00:14:33.093 --> 00:14:37.057
 Such cooperation is beneficial to our two countries and the entire world. 

00:14:37.057 --> 00:14:40.033
 If you can get a little inspiration from today’s dialogue, 

00:14:40.033 --> 00:14:45.010
 I hope that is committed to continuing this dialogue in the future. 

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:46.067
 Thank you very much. 

00:14:46.067 --> 00:14:49.037
 Now I hope to answer some questions from all of you. 

00:14:49.037 --> 00:14:50.057
 thank you very much. 

00:14:50.057 --> 00:14:59.000
 (applause) 

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.047
 I just want to 

00:15:00.047 --> 00:15:02.030
 (President Obama touches the microphone) 

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:04.053
 Make sure this goes smoothly. 

00:15:04.053 --> 00:15:08.027
 By the way, this is a type of direct dialogue in the United States 

00:15:08.027 --> 00:15:10.077
 Very common traditional practice. 

00:15:10.077 --> 00:15:14.070
 What we have to do is- 

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:16.000
 If you want to ask a question, 

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.080
 Just raise your hand. 

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.063
 I will call you. 

00:15:20.063 --> 00:15:24.033
 I will alternately answer questions from the audience 

00:15:24.033 --> 00:15:28.040
 Proposed by the students 

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.073
 Problems from the Internet, 

00:15:30.073 --> 00:15:33.037
 Also, I think Ambassador Hong Bopei may mention one 

00:15:33.037 --> 00:15:39.000
 Questions we collected through the embassy website. 

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.040
 Let's get started, let's take a look first- 

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.097
 Let me take this approach: first call a boy, then a girl, 

00:15:44.097 --> 00:15:49.007
 Then-take turns so that everyone thinks fair. 

00:15:49.007 --> 00:15:50.007
 Ok? 

00:15:50.007 --> 00:15:53.053
 First of all, I would like to ask this young lady in the front row to ask questions. 

00:15:53.053 --> 00:15:57.010
 Please wait for the microphone to speak, so that everyone can hear it. 

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:58.073
 What's your name? 

00:15:58.073 --> 00:16:01.033
 Student on site: My name is... 

00:16:01.033 --> 00:16:03.033
 I am a student of Fudan University. 

00:16:03.033 --> 00:16:07.097
 Since 1985, Shanghai and Chicago have become sister cities, 

00:16:07.097 --> 00:16:11.033
 The two cities conducted economic, political and cultural 

00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:14.020
 A wide range of exchange activities. 

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.093
 So what steps will you take to deepen 

00:16:17.093 --> 00:16:22.010
 This close relationship between the US and Chinese cities? 

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.067
 Shanghai will host the World Expo next year. 

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:28.083
 Will you take your family to visit the Expo? 

00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:29.083
 Thank you. 

00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:31.033
 President Obama: Thank you very much for raising this question. 

00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:34.077
 Before I came here, I was having lunch with the mayor of Shanghai, 

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:40.043
 He told me that he and the city of Chicago-- 

00:16:40.043 --> 00:16:44.010
 My hometown-has an excellent relationship, 

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:46.030
 He has visited the city of Chicago twice. 

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:50.030
 I think it is very good to communicate between cities. 

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:54.053
 One of the contents of my discussion with the Mayor of Shanghai is, 

00:16:54.053 --> 00:16:59.060
 How the two cities can learn from each other on the clean energy strategy, 

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:05.060
 Because one of the problems linking China and the United States is: 

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:10.043
 As the population grows and concerns about climate change, 

00:17:10.043 --> 00:17:16.050
 How can we reduce the carbon footprint of our two countries. 

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:20.057
 Obviously, in the United States and many developed countries, 

00:17:20.057 --> 00:17:24.073
 Calculated by population and average per person, 

00:17:24.073 --> 00:17:28.003
 They use energy compared to the energy used by everyone here in China 

00:17:28.003 --> 00:17:29.003
 Much more. 

00:17:29.003 --> 00:17:31.077
 But as China grows and develops, it will also use 

00:17:31.077 --> 00:17:32.067
 More energy. 

00:17:32.067 --> 00:17:36.023
 Therefore, both countries are eager to find new strategies. 

00:17:36.023 --> 00:17:41.060
 We talked about public transportation 

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.070
 And Shanghai is developing excellent track lines. 

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:46.037
 I think we are in Chicago 

00:17:46.037 --> 00:17:49.097
 And the United States can learn from the excellent high-speed rail projects being built 

00:17:49.097 --> 00:17:52.073
 Learn something. 

00:17:52.073 --> 00:17:56.037
 In the US, I think we are learning 

00:17:56.037 --> 00:17:58.013
 Build using less energy, 

00:17:58.013 --> 00:17:59.083
 Buildings with higher energy efficiency. 

00:17:59.083 --> 00:18:02.040
 And I know, as far as Shanghai is concerned-I came to see it all the way 

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.060
 So many cranes and so many new buildings under construction, 

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.043
 It’s very important that we start to absorb these new technologies, 

00:18:08.043 --> 00:18:14.080
 This will make each building in terms of lighting, 

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:17.077
 Energy-saving in terms of heating. 

00:18:17.077 --> 00:18:19.073
 So I think this is a learning from each other 

00:18:19.073 --> 00:18:21.040
 Great opportunity. 

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:25.047
 I know that clean energy will become the 

00:18:25.047 --> 00:18:28.043
 A main focus- 

00:18:28.043 --> 00:18:30.030
 I learned this from the mayor of Shanghai. 

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:33.007
 So I will be happy to attend. 

00:18:33.007 --> 00:18:37.003
 I still can't determine my future schedule; 

00:18:37.003 --> 00:18:40.043
 But I am very happy that at the Shanghai World Expo 

00:18:40.043 --> 00:18:44.070
 There will be a wonderful American Pavilion. I heard that there are expected to be 

00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:47.007
 As many as 70 million people came to visit. 

00:18:47.007 --> 00:18:50.070
 So here will be crowded, and it will be very exciting. 

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:54.023
 Chicago has held two World Expos in history, 

00:18:54.023 --> 00:18:58.077
 The two World Expos have brought great impetus to the city. 

00:18:58.077 --> 00:19:02.047
 I am sure that the same situation will appear here in Shanghai. 

00:19:02.047 --> 00:19:03.070
 Thank you. 

00:19:03.070 --> 00:19:06.050
 (applause) 

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:09.073
 Let's choose a question from the online questions. 

00:19:09.073 --> 00:19:14.050
 Please introduce yourself, in case... 

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:20.000
 Translation: I speak Chinese first, then English, okay? 

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
 President Obama: Okay. 

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.087
 From the online question: I am... 

00:19:25.087 --> 00:19:28.010
 From Shanghai...University. 

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.007
 The question I mentioned comes from the Internet. 

00:19:32.007 --> 00:19:33.053
 I want to thank Mr. President 

00:19:33.053 --> 00:19:36.060
 Visit China during the first year of your tenure, 

00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:40.063
 Exchange opinions with us in China. 

00:19:40.063 --> 00:19:43.053
 I want to know what your visit to China brings to China, 

00:19:43.053 --> 00:19:47.067
 What will you bring back 

00:19:47.067 --> 00:19:49.013
 United States? 

00:19:49.013 --> 00:20:16.077
 (Translation for President Obama) 

00:20:16.077 --> 00:20:17.063
 President Obama: Okay. 

00:20:17.063 --> 00:20:19.047
 Ok…… 

00:20:19.047 --> 00:20:23.003
 (applause) 

00:20:23.003 --> 00:20:30.020
 The main purpose of my visit is to deepen my understanding 

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:33.067
 China and China's outlook for the future. 

00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:37.067
 I have had many meetings with President Hu. 

00:20:37.067 --> 00:20:40.097
 We jointly participated in the response to the economic and financial crisis 

00:20:40.097 --> 00:20:44.007
 G20 meeting. 

00:20:44.007 --> 00:20:48.057
 We held consultations on a wide range of topics. 

00:20:48.057 --> 00:20:53.040
 But I think the United States continues to deepen 

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.043
 Understanding of China is very important, 

00:20:55.043 --> 00:20:58.027
 Just as China needs to continue to deepen 

00:20:58.027 --> 00:21:01.060
 Learn about the United States. 

00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:05.097
 As for my hope from this meeting 

00:21:05.097 --> 00:21:09.033
 Or what have you seen from this visit, 

00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:11.090
 In addition to taking this excellent opportunity to visit the Forbidden City and the Great Wall, 

00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:15.027
 And meet with everyone here-these are the main contents- 

00:21:15.027 --> 00:21:16.093
 (Microphone echo) 

00:21:16.093 --> 00:21:21.010
 Oh – these are all, but apart from the mentioned, 

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.003
 I also intend to discuss an important point with Chairman Hu, 

00:21:25.003 --> 00:21:28.007
 That is what Ambassador Hong Bopei said earlier, 

00:21:28.007 --> 00:21:32.087
 There is no consensus between the United States and China, 

00:21:32.087 --> 00:21:37.053
 It is impossible to overcome many global challenges. 

00:21:37.053 --> 00:21:40.080
 Let me give a specific example, 

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:45.030
 This is the issue of climate change we just talked about. 

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:50.050
 The United States and China are the two largest greenhouse gas emission and carbon emission countries in the world. 

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:55.050
 This emission causes the earth to warm up. 

00:21:55.050 --> 00:22:02.070
 As I said earlier, the United States, as a highly developed country, 

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:08.003
 Per capita energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions 

00:22:08.003 --> 00:22:13.060
 Much higher than China. 

00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:16.097
 On the other hand, China is growing faster, 

00:22:16.097 --> 00:22:19.030
 More population. 

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:25.027
 Therefore, unless our two countries are willing to 

00:22:25.027 --> 00:22:28.040
 Take key steps, 

00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:31.057
 Otherwise, we cannot solve this problem. 

00:22:31.057 --> 00:22:38.013
 At the Copenhagen conference scheduled for December, 

00:22:38.013 --> 00:22:44.057
 World leaders will work hard to find a plan that will enable us all to make 

00:22:44.057 --> 00:22:47.080
 Different commitments, 

00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.060
 Differentiate the obligations undertaken by countries 

00:22:49.060 --> 00:22:53.000
 Obviously, because there are so many poor people in China, 

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.093
 Therefore, it is not necessary to take exactly the same actions as the United States- 

00:22:55.093 --> 00:23:01.010
 However, in planning how to reduce greenhouse gases, 

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:05.093
 All of us should assume certain obligations. 

00:23:05.093 --> 00:23:09.067
 This example illustrates what I hope to see in this meeting- 

00:23:09.067 --> 00:23:13.023
 I will exchange ideas with Chairman Hu, 

00:23:13.023 --> 00:23:16.083
 Discuss how the United States and China can play a leading role together. 

00:23:16.083 --> 00:23:20.033
 Because, I can tell you that other countries in the world will 

00:23:20.033 --> 00:23:22.013
 Waiting for us. 

00:23:22.013 --> 00:23:24.040
 They will observe our actions. 

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.080
 If they think the United States and China are not taking this issue seriously, 

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.093
 Then they will not take it seriously. 

00:23:32.093 --> 00:23:39.017
 This is the leadership responsibility that our two countries now shoulder. 

00:23:39.017 --> 00:23:43.017
 My hope is that through more and more discussions and dialogues, 

00:23:43.017 --> 00:23:46.063
 We are able to show the world more of us in many of these 

00:23:46.063 --> 00:23:49.017
 Leadership on key issues. 

00:23:49.017 --> 00:23:50.013
 good or not? 

00:23:50.013 --> 00:23:52.070
 Okay, here is... 

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.030
 (applause) 

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:56.020
 Now it’s boys’ turn, 

00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.050
 right? 

00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:07.090
 Let me ask this guy a question. 

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:11.083
 let me- 

00:24:11.083 --> 00:24:14.047
 Audience: Good afternoon, Mr. President. 

00:24:14.047 --> 00:24:18.010
 I come from Tongji University. 

00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:23.020
 I want to quote a sentence from Confucius: 

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:30.047
 "Have friends come from afar". 

00:24:30.047 --> 00:24:34.077
 There is a famous saying in The Analects 

00:24:34.077 --> 00:24:38.060
 And different. 

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.037
 China advocates a harmonious world. 

00:24:41.037 --> 00:24:50.003
 We know that the United States has formed a culture characterized by diversity, 

00:24:50.003 --> 00:24:56.073
 What measures will your government take to build a 

00:24:56.073 --> 00:25:01.053
 A diverse world composed of different cultures? 

00:25:01.053 --> 00:25:07.067
 What measures will you take to respect other countries 

00:25:07.067 --> 00:25:09.030
 Different cultures and history? 

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:14.053
 What can we do in the future? 

00:25:14.053 --> 00:25:17.043
 President Obama: This is a very good point. 

00:25:17.043 --> 00:25:21.077
 One of the advantages of the United States is that we have a very 

00:25:21.077 --> 00:25:23.017
 Diversified culture. 

00:25:23.017 --> 00:25:27.003
 We have people from all over the world. 

00:25:27.003 --> 00:25:34.077
 Therefore, it is not clear what Americans look like. 

00:25:34.077 --> 00:25:39.050
 Taking my own family as an example, my father is from Kenya, 

00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:42.060
 My mother is from Kansas, 

00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.093
 In the Midwest of the United States. 

00:25:44.093 --> 00:25:48.093
 My sister is half of Indonesian descent and she married another Chinese 

00:25:48.093 --> 00:25:51.097
 Canadian. 

00:25:51.097 --> 00:25:56.090
 Therefore, we Obama 

00:25:56.090 --> 00:25:59.080
 The gathering of the whole family is like the United Nations. 

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.007
 (laughter) 

00:26:02.007 --> 00:26:05.050
 And this is where the power of America lies, 

00:26:05.050 --> 00:26:08.090
 Because it means that we are from different cultures, 

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:11.090
 Different diets and different thoughts, 

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:15.050
 This makes our society more vibrant. 

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:23.017
 At the same time, every country 

00:26:23.017 --> 00:26:28.020
 The interconnected world has its own culture, its own history and 

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:29.087
 Own tradition. 

00:26:29.087 --> 00:26:34.037
 Therefore, I think the important thing for the United States is that it cannot 

00:26:34.037 --> 00:26:39.053
 What I think is good for us will definitely give 

00:26:39.053 --> 00:26:41.083
 Others bring benefits. 

00:26:41.083 --> 00:26:48.033
 We are treating 

00:26:48.033 --> 00:26:50.083
 The attitude of other countries should be modest. 

00:26:50.083 --> 00:26:54.090
 But I must state that, as I said in the opening remarks, 

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:59.073
 We do think that some basic principles 

00:26:59.073 --> 00:27:04.023
 Is common to all people, 

00:27:04.023 --> 00:27:06.047
 Regardless of cultural background. 

00:27:06.047 --> 00:27:15.013
 For example, at the United Nations, we are very active 

00:27:15.013 --> 00:27:21.040
 Working hard to ensure children around the world 

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:27.020
 All enjoy certain basic rights— 

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:31.040
 If the child is exploited, 

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.077
 If they are forced to do child labor, 

00:27:34.077 --> 00:27:40.017
 Although before 

00:27:40.017 --> 00:27:43.067
 In many countries, including the United States, such things may have happened, 

00:27:43.067 --> 00:27:48.010
 But all countries in the world should now develop to 

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:53.073
 The extent to which children can be treated in a better way than in the past. 

00:27:53.073 --> 00:27:56.040
 This is a universal value. 

00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:00.020
 I believe 

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:02.020
 The same is true of the attitude towards women. 

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:05.037
 I came to the mayor before coming here 

00:28:05.037 --> 00:28:08.040
 Had lunch and had very interesting discussions, 

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:13.030
 He told me that now in Chinese universities 

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:17.030
 There are many professional school girls actually 

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:22.040
 There are more than boys, and their study is very good. 

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:27.097
 I think this is an excellent indicator of progress, 

00:28:27.097 --> 00:28:32.030
 Because looking at developments around the world, you will see, 

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:37.020
 One of the most important indicators of the success of a country’s development, 

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:42.007
 Is the education of girls in the country and 

00:28:42.007 --> 00:28:44.027
 The treatment enjoyed by women. 

00:28:44.027 --> 00:28:48.080
 And those who can use women’s ingenuity and energy, 

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.000
 And a country that can provide them with a good education, 

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.027
 It usually has better economic development than those countries that do not. 

00:28:56.027 --> 00:28:59.073
 Of course, different cultures have a relationship between men and women 

00:28:59.073 --> 00:29:02.097
 May have different attitudes, 

00:29:02.097 --> 00:29:06.070
 But I think the American view is that 

00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:11.093
 We must declare the rights of women all over the world. 

00:29:11.093 --> 00:29:17.050
 If we see women being oppressed in some societies, 

00:29:17.050 --> 00:29:20.020
 No chance, 

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:25.017
 Or be subjected to violence, we will cry out loud. 

00:29:25.017 --> 00:29:28.047
 Some people may not agree with us, 

00:29:28.047 --> 00:29:31.050
 We can start a dialogue on this. 

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.057
 But we think it is necessary 

00:29:33.057 --> 00:29:36.063
 Abide by our philosophy and values. 

00:29:36.063 --> 00:29:38.033
 We do this, 

00:29:38.033 --> 00:29:40.077
 When we do this, we must be humble and must realize 

00:29:40.077 --> 00:29:46.030
 We are not perfect ourselves, and we still have to make progress on many issues. 

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.027
 If you ask American women, they will tell you, 

00:29:49.027 --> 00:29:54.060
 There are men who have a role in women’s society 

00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:56.070
 Still holding old ideas. 

00:29:56.070 --> 00:30:01.047
 Therefore, we cannot say that we have solved all the problems, 

00:30:01.047 --> 00:30:04.010
 But we believe that these universal ideas must be 

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:07.090
 And scream out these universal values. 

00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:08.097
 Ok? 

00:30:08.097 --> 00:30:09.070
 Ok. 

00:30:09.070 --> 00:30:20.003
 The following question is to be answered via the Internet. 

00:30:20.003 --> 00:30:22.077
 Questioner on behalf of netizens: Hello, Mr. President. 

00:30:22.077 --> 00:30:25.087
 I am very honored to be here to meet you personally. 

00:30:25.087 --> 00:30:26.063
 President Obama: Thank you. 

00:30:26.063 --> 00:30:29.057
 On behalf of netizen questioner: My name is...I am from Shanghai 

00:30:29.057 --> 00:30:31.060
 International...University. 

00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:36.000
 I will read a question to you selected from the Internet, 

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.050
 This question was raised by a Taiwanese. 

00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:47.007
 When asking questions, he said: I am from Taiwan, 

00:30:47.007 --> 00:30:50.027
 Now doing business on the mainland. 

00:30:50.027 --> 00:30:53.063
 Due to cross-strait relations 

00:30:53.063 --> 00:30:58.037
 In recent years, it has continued to improve, and my business on the mainland is doing very well. 

00:30:58.037 --> 00:31:03.063
 So when I heard someone in America 

00:31:03.063 --> 00:31:09.063
 To propose-when we continue to sell weapons to Taiwan, 

00:31:09.063 --> 00:31:13.013
 I started to feel very worried. 

00:31:13.013 --> 00:31:18.097
 I am worried that this will damage the relationship between the two sides of the strait. 

00:31:18.097 --> 00:31:23.010
 Therefore, Mr. President, 

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:28.060
 I want to know if you support improving cross-strait relations. 

00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:32.017
 Of course, although this question was raised by a businessman, 

00:31:32.017 --> 00:31:36.033
 But all young Chinese students are actually very concerned about this issue, 

00:31:36.033 --> 00:31:40.077
 So we especially want to know your position on this issue. 

00:31:40.077 --> 00:31:41.067
 Thank you. 

00:31:41.067 --> 00:31:42.070
 President Obama: Thank you. 

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:48.037
 (applause) 

00:31:48.037 --> 00:31:54.043
 I have always made it clear that this government 

00:31:54.043 --> 00:31:58.037
 Fully support the one-China policy, 

00:31:58.037 --> 00:32:03.020
 The three joint communiqués released decades ago 

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:07.040
 Our stated relationship with the People’s Republic of China and 

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:11.093
 Our relationship with Taiwan. 

00:32:11.093 --> 00:32:17.023
 We do not want to change this policy and this policy. 

00:32:17.023 --> 00:32:21.040
 I am very happy to see the tension easing 

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:25.023
 Improved relations with the two sides of the strait, 

00:32:25.023 --> 00:32:33.010
 And I very much look forward to and hope that we can continue to see 

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:41.077
 Taiwan and the rest of China 

00:32:41.077 --> 00:32:48.030
 Significantly improve the relationship when solving many of these problems. 

00:32:48.030 --> 00:32:52.010
 I think that in the US foreign policy, 

00:32:52.010 --> 00:32:57.027
 Also included in the policy to China, 

00:32:57.027 --> 00:33:04.060
 Always seek is through dialogue and 

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:08.007
 Negotiate a solution to the problem. 

00:33:08.007 --> 00:33:11.020
 We always think this is a better way. 

00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:15.093
 And I think that the economic and trade links that are being established in this area 

00:33:15.093 --> 00:33:20.067
 Helps relieve a lot 

00:33:20.067 --> 00:33:28.007
 Before you were born, even before I was born, the tension was formed. 

00:33:28.007 --> 00:33:32.010
 But some people still look back when considering these issues, 

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.063
 Instead of looking to the future. 

00:33:35.063 --> 00:33:38.033
 I prefer to look to the future. 

00:33:38.033 --> 00:33:41.000
 Like I just said, I think the business relationship is being established 

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.037
 When people think they can 

00:33:44.037 --> 00:33:48.060
 When doing business to make money, there are some factors that make their ideas very clear, 

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.087
 Don’t worry too much about ideology. 

00:33:51.087 --> 00:33:54.077
 I think this area has already begun to undergo this change, 

00:33:54.077 --> 00:33:58.010
 And we very much support this process. 

00:33:58.010 --> 00:33:59.083
 Ok, 

00:33:59.083 --> 00:34:02.047
 It’s girls’ turn, isn’t it? 

00:34:02.047 --> 00:34:03.093
 This is it. 

00:34:03.093 --> 00:34:05.047
 Yes. 

00:34:05.047 --> 00:34:10.030
 Wait a minute, let's—oh, sorry, they took the microphone back here. 

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.047
 Let me ask you the next question again. 

00:34:12.047 --> 00:34:15.070
 Please say that I will come here later. please say. 

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:17.020
 please say. 

00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.093
 Yes, please. 

00:34:18.093 --> 00:34:21.063
 Thank you. 

00:34:21.063 --> 00:34:23.013
 President Obama: I will ask you questions later. 

00:34:23.013 --> 00:34:25.073
 President Obama: I will ask you questions later. I will call her first, then you. 

00:34:25.073 --> 00:34:26.093
 please say. 

00:34:26.093 --> 00:34:28.010
 Q: Okay, thank you. 

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:34.077
 Mr. President, I am a student of Shanghai Jiaotong University. 

00:34:34.077 --> 00:34:41.093
 I would like to ask one about Nobel 

00:34:41.093 --> 00:34:44.000
 The issue of the peace award. 

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.010
 In your opinion, the main reason why you won the Nobel Peace Prize 

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:48.097
 What is it? 

00:34:48.097 --> 00:34:55.087
 It will give you more responsibility 

00:34:55.087 --> 00:35:00.070
 And pressure to promote world peace? 

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:10.093
 It will do you 

00:35:10.093 --> 00:35:13.053
 Does the idea of ​​dealing with international affairs matter? 

00:35:13.053 --> 00:35:14.063
 thank you very much. 

00:35:14.063 --> 00:35:15.063
 President Obama: Thank you. 

00:35:15.063 --> 00:35:18.053
 This question is well mentioned. 

00:35:18.053 --> 00:35:22.027
 I must say that no one is better than me 

00:35:22.027 --> 00:35:25.007
 He was even more surprised to win the Nobel Peace Prize. 

00:35:25.007 --> 00:35:32.043
 This is of course an honor. I don’t think my award is truly deserved, 

00:35:32.043 --> 00:35:39.053
 Based on the glorious history of past winners. 

00:35:39.053 --> 00:35:46.000
 I can only humbly accept this fact, 

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:54.070
 That is, it is the American people who moved the committee 

00:35:54.070 --> 00:35:59.030
 And the kind that not only changed America, 

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:04.073
 And the possibility of changing the US policy towards the world. 

00:36:04.073 --> 00:36:08.040
 So I think, in a certain way, although they awarded me this award, 

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:15.030
 But I am just a symbol, which represents us in dealing with international affairs 

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.027
 Efforts to change practices. 

00:36:19.027 --> 00:36:23.040
 As for the burden I feel, 

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:30.057
 It is indeed a great honor for me to assume the presidency. 

00:36:30.057 --> 00:36:34.080
 Whenever I complain about too much work, 

00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:38.053
 My wife always reminds me: "You did this job voluntarily." 

00:36:38.053 --> 00:36:40.070
 (laughter) 

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:43.057
 So you-there is a saying- 

00:36:43.057 --> 00:36:45.073
 I don’t know if there is a similar proverb in China—— 

00:36:45.073 --> 00:36:47.037
 But we Americans will say, "You made the bed, 

00:36:47.037 --> 00:36:50.013
 You have to sleep on it. " 

00:36:50.013 --> 00:36:53.017
 The general idea is that you should be careful when making a wish, 

00:36:53.017 --> 00:36:56.090
 Because you may really do what you want. 

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:01.027
 We all promote 

00:37:01.027 --> 00:37:04.047
 The obligation of world peace. 

00:37:04.047 --> 00:37:08.003
 This is not always easy. 

00:37:08.003 --> 00:37:12.050
 The world still exists for many centuries 

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.093
 Unresolved conflicts. 

00:37:14.093 --> 00:37:21.057
 Look at the Middle East, some wars and conflicts 

00:37:21.057 --> 00:37:27.073
 It is based on the argument thousands of years ago. 

00:37:27.073 --> 00:37:29.093
 In many places around the world, such as 

00:37:29.093 --> 00:37:33.023
 Africa, there are still some difficult to solve 

00:37:33.023 --> 00:37:37.060
 Ethnic and tribal conflicts. 

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:41.013
 Obviously, as the President of the United States, 

00:37:41.013 --> 00:37:44.063
 One of the duties is to serve as the commander of the armed forces, 

00:37:44.063 --> 00:37:49.087
 And my first priority is to protect the American people. 

00:37:49.087 --> 00:37:54.077
 Due to the "9.11" attack and terrorist attacks around the world 

00:37:54.077 --> 00:37:57.080
 Causing casualties to innocent people, 

00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:02.073
 My responsibility is to ensure that we 

00:38:02.073 --> 00:38:05.077
 Eradicate these terrorist organizations, 

00:38:05.077 --> 00:38:10.013
 And cooperate with other countries to solve 

00:38:10.013 --> 00:38:13.027
 Such violence. 

00:38:13.027 --> 00:38:16.073
 However, although I don’t think we can completely 

00:38:16.073 --> 00:38:20.053
 Eliminate violence between countries or nations, 

00:38:20.053 --> 00:38:25.040
 I still think we can definitely reduce violence between peoples 

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.097
 Through dialogue, 

00:38:27.097 --> 00:38:35.010
 Exchange of opinions and promotion 

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:38.040
 Understanding between nations and cultures. 

00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:46.030
 Especially today, if only one person detonates 

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:49.050
 A bomb can cause massive destruction, 

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:55.043
 Therefore, we have worked harder than ever to advance the strategy for promoting peace. 

00:38:55.043 --> 00:38:59.083
 Technology can be a powerful tool for the benefit of mankind, 

00:38:59.083 --> 00:39:03.067
 But it also allows a few people 

00:39:03.067 --> 00:39:06.067
 There is an opportunity to take advantage and cause great damage. 

00:39:06.067 --> 00:39:13.007
 So I sincerely hope that when I meet with President Hu 

00:39:13.007 --> 00:39:17.083
 And the continuous exchanges between the two sides, the United States and China can 

00:39:17.083 --> 00:39:24.033
 Work together to reduce the conflicts that are occurring. 

00:39:24.033 --> 00:39:32.000
 However, we have to do this, and when we use the army, we also need to think, 

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.040
 Because we are such a powerful country, 

00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.013
 So we must always reflect on our actions, 

00:39:39.013 --> 00:39:44.003
 Examine our motives and our own interests, 

00:39:44.003 --> 00:39:49.017
 Make sure we don’t just 

00:39:49.017 --> 00:39:53.040
 Because no one can stop us from using armed forces. 

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:56.097
 One of the responsibilities of a great country is to 

00:39:56.097 --> 00:40:01.010
 Act responsibly in the international community. 

00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:07.063
 I hope the United States and China 

00:40:07.063 --> 00:40:12.027
 Ability to work together to create a reduction 

00:40:12.027 --> 00:40:14.013
 International norms of global conflict. 

00:40:14.013 --> 00:40:15.090
 it is good. 

00:40:15.090 --> 00:40:17.027
 how about it? 

00:40:17.027 --> 00:40:20.060
 (applause) 

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:23.050
 I will ask my ambassador to ask questions, I think he 

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:27.017
 There is a website through the embassy 

00:40:27.017 --> 00:40:29.020
 Questions. 

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.097
 This is a selected question, I think it’s up to us 

00:40:32.097 --> 00:40:36.003
 It was selected by the members of the American Journalist Group, so-- 

00:40:36.003 --> 00:40:37.007
 Ambassador Hong Bopei: Yes. 

00:40:37.007 --> 00:40:40.053
 And it’s no surprise: "In a network of 350 million netizens, 

00:40:40.053 --> 00:40:44.037
 60 million blogging countries, 

00:40:44.037 --> 00:40:47.050
 Have you heard of firewalls? " 

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:52.017
 Second, "Should we be able to use Twitter freely?"—— 

00:40:52.017 --> 00:40:53.027
 This is the problem. 

00:40:53.027 --> 00:41:01.013
 President Obama: First of all, let me say that I have never used Twitter. 

00:41:01.013 --> 00:41:06.027
 I noticed that young people are busy with these electronic things. 

00:41:06.027 --> 00:41:12.063
 My fingers are not working properly on the phone. 

00:41:12.063 --> 00:41:15.057
 However, I believe in technology, 

00:41:15.057 --> 00:41:21.033
 I believe in the openness of information exchange. 

00:41:21.033 --> 00:41:27.060
 I thought that the more freely the information exchanged, 

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.020
 The stronger the society, 

00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:37.000
 Because citizens of all countries in the world can 

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.047
 Accountability to your government. 

00:41:40.047 --> 00:41:44.047
 They will start to think independently, 

00:41:44.047 --> 00:41:46.063
 Thereby generating new ideas, 

00:41:46.063 --> 00:41:49.033
 Encourage creativity. 

00:41:49.033 --> 00:41:57.037
 Therefore, I have always been a supporter of the public use of the Internet. 

00:41:57.037 --> 00:42:02.053
 I strongly support unregulated information. 

00:42:02.053 --> 00:42:04.073
 This is also part of the American tradition I just said, 

00:42:04.073 --> 00:42:08.077
 I recognize different countries 

00:42:08.077 --> 00:42:10.017
 There are different traditions. 

00:42:10.017 --> 00:42:12.040
 I can tell you that in the United States, 

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:16.050
 The free internet we have 

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:23.077
 In other words, unlimited internet access is a source of our strength, 

00:42:23.077 --> 00:42:26.003
 I think it should be encouraged. 

00:42:26.003 --> 00:42:28.083
 I should tell you, I should be honest, 

00:42:28.083 --> 00:42:31.077
 As the President of the United States, 

00:42:31.077 --> 00:42:36.050
 Sometimes I wish the information was not spread so freely, 

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:39.030
 Because then i won't always hear 

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:42.070
 Others criticized me. 

00:42:42.070 --> 00:42:49.087
 I think people are natural-they will think when they are in power, 

00:42:49.087 --> 00:42:53.043
 How can that person say me that way, 

00:42:53.043 --> 00:42:56.070
 Or, that is irresponsible, and so on. 

00:42:56.070 --> 00:43:01.097
 However, the fact is that because the information in the United States is 

00:43:01.097 --> 00:43:04.080
 Free to communicate, many people in the United States criticized me, 

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.023
 Say I have everything, 

00:43:08.023 --> 00:43:12.050
 I actually think this makes our democratic system stronger, 

00:43:12.050 --> 00:43:17.003
 Also made me a better leader because this approach forced me to listen 

00:43:17.003 --> 00:43:19.050
 Those opinions that I don’t want to hear, 

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:24.043
 Forced me to examine what I did every day, 

00:43:24.043 --> 00:43:28.050
 See if i 

00:43:28.050 --> 00:43:31.043
 I did my best for the American people. 

00:43:31.043 --> 00:43:35.093
 I think the Internet has become this kind of citizen participation 

00:43:35.093 --> 00:43:39.060
 More powerful tools. 

00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:45.050
 In fact, one of the reasons I can be elected president, 

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:48.047
 It is because we can mobilize like you through the Internet 

00:43:48.047 --> 00:43:50.060
 Young people's participation. 

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:54.030
 At the beginning, no one thought we could win because we did not 

00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:57.087
 The support of the person with the most financial resources, 

00:43:57.087 --> 00:44:01.033
 Nor is there the most powerful political broker. 

00:44:01.033 --> 00:44:03.070
 But through the Internet, people have a passion for our campaign, 

00:44:03.070 --> 00:44:08.013
 They started to organize, 

00:44:08.013 --> 00:44:14.007
 Gatherings, arranging campaigns, events and gatherings, 

00:44:14.007 --> 00:44:18.090
 Finally it became a real bottom-up movement, 

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:21.053
 So that we can do well. 

00:44:21.053 --> 00:44:24.023
 And this is not just the case for government and political affairs, 

00:44:24.023 --> 00:44:26.017
 The same is true for business. 

00:44:26.017 --> 00:44:33.047
 Think about it, a company like Google, only 20 years ago-- 

00:44:33.047 --> 00:44:38.063
 Less than 20 years ago, from two 

00:44:38.063 --> 00:44:42.010
 The idea of ​​someone no bigger than you. 

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:45.010
 At the time it was a technology project. 

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.063
 But suddenly, because of the Internet, 

00:44:46.063 --> 00:44:51.087
 They can create a business for the world 

00:44:51.087 --> 00:44:54.007
 New industries that bring change. 

00:44:54.007 --> 00:45:00.017
 So, if it were not for the freedom and openness of the Internet, 

00:45:00.017 --> 00:45:04.057
 There will be no Google. 

00:45:04.057 --> 00:45:10.063
 Therefore, I strongly support not to use the Internet, 

00:45:10.063 --> 00:45:15.003
 Restrictions are imposed on Internet access and information technologies such as Twitter. 

00:45:15.003 --> 00:45:17.087
 The more open we are, the more able to communicate, 

00:45:17.087 --> 00:45:20.017
 This will also help bring the world together. 

00:45:20.017 --> 00:45:21.097
 Think about it-when I think of my daughter 

00:45:21.097 --> 00:45:26.027
 When Maria and Sasha, they were 11 years old and 8 years old, 

00:45:26.027 --> 00:45:29.040
 They can surf the Internet from their room, 

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.070
 Travel to Shanghai. 

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:36.003
 They can go to any place in the world, they can learn to understand 

00:45:36.003 --> 00:45:39.010
 Anything they want to know. 

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:44.003
 What a power they have. 

00:45:44.003 --> 00:45:47.050
 I think this helps to advance what we just talked about 

00:45:47.050 --> 00:45:48.050
 That kind of understanding. 

00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:53.020
 As I said earlier, technology always has a downside. 

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.077
 It also means that terrorists can 

00:45:56.077 --> 00:45:59.083
 Organize online in ways that may not have been possible in the past 

00:45:59.083 --> 00:46:03.050
 Extremists can mobilize. 

00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:06.073
 Therefore, there are some costs for opening up, 

00:46:06.073 --> 00:46:08.027
 This cannot be denied. 

00:46:08.027 --> 00:46:13.017
 However, I believe that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages, 

00:46:13.017 --> 00:46:15.070
 It’s better to stay open. 

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:17.080
 This is the part of me that has internet on this forum 

00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.000
 The reason for being happy. 

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:20.080
 May I? 

00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:23.020
 I will answer two more questions, 

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:30.043
 I think the next question comes from a man, does he? 

00:46:30.043 --> 00:46:34.000
 Yes, right here. 

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:40.083
 Give you the microphone. 

00:46:40.083 --> 00:46:46.007
 Audience: First of all, I want to say that I am very honored to stand here 

00:46:46.007 --> 00:46:47.093
 Ask you a question, 

00:46:47.093 --> 00:46:54.047
 I think my luck is so good, your speech is so clear, 

00:46:54.047 --> 00:46:59.033
 I don't need such a headset. 

00:46:59.033 --> 00:47:01.013
 (laughter) 

00:47:01.013 --> 00:47:03.007
 My question is this. 

00:47:03.007 --> 00:47:09.060
 My name is... I am a student of the School of Management of Fudan University, 

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.033
 I want to ask you this question- 

00:47:12.033 --> 00:47:18.097
 Someone has already asked you about a certain aspect of the Nobel Peace Prize, 

00:47:18.097 --> 00:47:24.083
 I don’t want to ask the same question again, 

00:47:24.083 --> 00:47:30.000
 I want to ask: to win such a high honor 

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.093
 It is very difficult. 

00:47:34.093 --> 00:47:38.057
 I want to know, we all want to know, 

00:47:38.057 --> 00:47:41.007
 How did you get it? 

00:47:41.007 --> 00:47:47.067
 What kind of university education do you get, 

00:47:47.067 --> 00:47:53.087
 Help you get such an honor? 

00:47:53.087 --> 00:48:01.033
 We are all curious, 

00:48:01.033 --> 00:48:07.060
 We would like to invite you to share your university education experience, 

00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:09.080
 In order to embark on the road to success. 

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:13.087
 President Obama: First, I want to tell you, I don’t know 

00:48:13.087 --> 00:48:20.057
 There is a syllabus or course that can guide you to win the Nobel Peace Prize. 

00:48:20.057 --> 00:48:21.047
 (laughter) 

00:48:21.047 --> 00:48:24.083
 So I cannot guarantee you. 

00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:28.017
 But I think the secret to success is actually 

00:48:28.017 --> 00:48:30.007
 You are already practicing. 

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:33.003
 There is no doubt that you all work very hard, 

00:48:33.003 --> 00:48:35.040
 You are studying hard, 

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.027
 You are curious, 

00:48:37.027 --> 00:48:43.030
 You are willing to think about new ideas and think for yourself. 

00:48:43.030 --> 00:48:48.093
 You know, the most motivating winner I have encountered now, 

00:48:48.093 --> 00:48:56.013
 Not only those who are willing to work very hard, 

00:48:56.013 --> 00:49:01.010
 And always improve their own people, 

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:04.050
 They are constantly exploring new ideas, 

00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:11.073
 Instead of just sticking to the rules. 

00:49:11.073 --> 00:49:15.070
 Of course, the road to success varies, 

00:49:15.070 --> 00:49:19.073
 Some of you will enter government agencies; 

00:49:19.073 --> 00:49:22.067
 Some may want to be teachers or professors; 

00:49:22.067 --> 00:49:26.030
 Some people may want to enter the business world. 

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:30.013
 But I think no matter what field you enter, 

00:49:30.013 --> 00:49:39.000
 If you can continuously improve yourself, 

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.050
 If you do not do your best, you will never be satisfied, and keep asking new questions 

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:44.050
 "Can I still do it in different ways?" 

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:48.010
 Whether in the field of science and technology or art, 

00:49:48.010 --> 00:49:53.010
 "Is there a new solution to the problem that no one has thought of?" 

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:56.077
 I think such people can usually 

00:49:56.077 --> 00:49:58.090
 Outstanding. 

00:49:58.090 --> 00:50:00.057
 I have one last suggestion, 

00:50:00.057 --> 00:50:05.093
 This advice has benefited me a lot, 

00:50:05.093 --> 00:50:08.043
 That is the successful people I admire most, 

00:50:08.043 --> 00:50:11.087
 They are not just thinking about themselves, but also considering 

00:50:11.087 --> 00:50:15.023
 Things beyond personal scope. 

00:50:15.023 --> 00:50:18.000
 They want to contribute to society. 

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.090
 They hope for their own country, their own nation, 

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:24.057
 Contribute to your own city. 

00:50:24.057 --> 00:50:29.033
 They hope to produce beyond 

00:50:29.033 --> 00:50:32.003
 Influence outside of your personal life. 

00:50:32.003 --> 00:50:36.057
 I think many of us will be busy making money for ourselves, 

00:50:36.057 --> 00:50:39.067
 Buy a good car, buy a comfortable house—— 

00:50:39.067 --> 00:50:42.017
 All of these are important, 

00:50:42.017 --> 00:50:46.017
 But those who really have a permanent impact on the world 

00:50:46.017 --> 00:50:48.067
 It is because they have lofty ideals. 

00:50:48.067 --> 00:50:51.033
 They asked themselves: How can I help more people avoid hunger? 

00:50:51.033 --> 00:50:55.013
 How can I help children who have not gone to school to receive education? 

00:50:55.013 --> 00:51:00.057
 How can I help resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner? 

00:51:00.057 --> 00:51:04.000
 I think only such a person can end up 

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.020
 Have a major impact on the world 

00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:08.060
 I believe that as long as young people like you 

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:11.077
 Keep working hard, 

00:51:11.077 --> 00:51:13.007
 Can have such an impact. 

00:51:13.007 --> 00:51:13.097
 how about it? 

00:51:13.097 --> 00:51:16.043
 Ok, this is the last question, unfortunately, 

00:51:16.043 --> 00:51:18.027
 time flies. 

00:51:18.027 --> 00:51:22.097
 Finally answer a netizen’s question because I want to make sure 

00:51:22.097 --> 00:51:25.083
 All three of our outstanding students have the opportunity to ask questions. 

00:51:25.083 --> 00:51:29.000
 Questioner on behalf of netizens: Mr. President, it is an honor to ask the last question. 

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.083
 I am a student of Fudan University, 

00:51:31.083 --> 00:51:36.083
 Today I am also a representative of Chinese youth... 

00:51:36.083 --> 00:51:41.007
 I think this is a question from Beijing: 

00:51:41.007 --> 00:51:44.007
 Very concerned about your Afghanistan policy. 

00:51:44.007 --> 00:51:48.057
 He wondered whether terrorism was still 

00:51:48.057 --> 00:51:51.080
 America's biggest security threat? 

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:55.033
 How do you assess military operations in Afghanistan? 

00:51:55.033 --> 00:51:59.053
 Will it evolve into another Iraq war? 

00:51:59.053 --> 00:52:00.073
 Thank you very much. 

00:52:00.073 --> 00:52:02.010
 President Obama: I think this is a very good question. 

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:10.047
 First, I continue to think 

00:52:10.047 --> 00:52:16.070
 The biggest threat to U.S. security 

00:52:16.070 --> 00:52:20.057
 It is a terrorist network like Al Qaeda. 

00:52:20.057 --> 00:52:25.013
 The reason is that although they are few in number, 

00:52:25.013 --> 00:52:30.053
 But they have shown that they have no humanity, 

00:52:30.053 --> 00:52:38.067
 Do not hesitate to kill innocent people. 

00:52:38.067 --> 00:52:46.043
 Thanks to today’s technology, if such an organization 

00:52:46.043 --> 00:52:49.027
 Get weapons of mass destruction-- 

00:52:49.027 --> 00:52:53.020
 For example nuclear weapons, chemical weapons or biological weapons-- 

00:52:53.020 --> 00:52:56.017
 And use it in a city, whether in Shanghai or New York, 

00:52:56.017 --> 00:53:02.070
 A few people can kill tens of thousands 

00:53:02.070 --> 00:53:06.023
 Even hundreds of thousands. 

00:53:06.023 --> 00:53:10.033
 Therefore, this does constitute a great threat. 

00:53:10.033 --> 00:53:13.063
 The reason we first entered Afghanistan is 

00:53:13.063 --> 00:53:17.043
 Because "Al Qaeda" is there, 

00:53:17.043 --> 00:53:20.023
 The Taliban accepted them. 

00:53:20.023 --> 00:53:22.097
 Now they have crossed the Afghan border 

00:53:22.097 --> 00:53:31.020
 Entered Pakistan, but they remained in the area 

00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:34.047
 Networks established with other extremist organizations. 

00:53:34.047 --> 00:53:39.050
 I am convinced that we need to achieve stability in Afghanistan, 

00:53:39.050 --> 00:53:43.057
 To enable the Afghan people to protect themselves, 

00:53:43.057 --> 00:53:48.043
 At the same time as a partner to help weaken 

00:53:48.043 --> 00:53:52.080
 The power of these extremist networks. 

00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:58.000
 Obviously this is a very difficult thing- 

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:03.007
 One of the most difficult decisions in my work is 

00:54:03.007 --> 00:54:06.070
 Order the young people to go to the battlefield. 

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:10.053
 I often have to meet the parents of the fallen officers and soldiers, 

00:54:10.053 --> 00:54:13.087
 Those soldiers can no longer go home. 

00:54:13.087 --> 00:54:18.050
 This is a mental burden for me, 

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:21.030
 I feel sore about it. 

00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:26.050
 Fortunately, our armed forces-- 

00:54:26.050 --> 00:54:28.080
 These young men in the army-- 

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:33.027
 They firmly believe in dedication to the country, 

00:54:33.027 --> 00:54:35.043
 Go to the front voluntarily. 

00:54:35.043 --> 00:54:37.090
 I believe that through a wider alliance, 

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:43.087
 Including our NATO allies 

00:54:43.087 --> 00:54:46.040
 And other allies who contribute — such as Australia — 

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:52.037
 We may help train Afghans to have a functioning government, 

00:54:52.037 --> 00:54:55.040
 Have their own security forces, 

00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:59.040
 Then we can gradually withdraw our troops, 

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:04.057
 Because by then there was no longer a vacuum formed after the Taliban stepped down. 

00:55:04.057 --> 00:55:06.073
 But this is a difficult task, 

00:55:06.073 --> 00:55:08.010
 It's not easy. 

00:55:08.010 --> 00:55:12.080
 I think that to ultimately defeat these terrorist extremists, 

00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.073
 We must understand that this is not just 

00:55:16.073 --> 00:55:19.027
 A military operation. 

00:55:19.027 --> 00:55:23.080
 We also need to know what drives young people into terrorists, 

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:28.040
 Why are they willing to act as suicide bombers. 

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:33.087
 Obviously, there are many different reasons, 

00:55:33.087 --> 00:55:40.087
 This includes distortions of religion, 

00:55:40.087 --> 00:55:44.020
 It makes people mistakenly believe that such violence is justified. 

00:55:44.020 --> 00:55:48.003
 The reason why Pakistan and Afghanistan happened, 

00:55:48.003 --> 00:55:51.060
 One of the reasons is that those young people have no education, 

00:55:51.060 --> 00:55:58.027
 There is no enterprising opportunity, so they are in life 

00:55:58.027 --> 00:56:03.033
 See no way out, which makes them think 

00:56:03.033 --> 00:56:05.027
 That is the only option. 

00:56:05.027 --> 00:56:09.063
 So one of the things we have to do in Afghanistan is 

00:56:09.063 --> 00:56:14.053
 Find ways to train teachers, build schools, 

00:56:14.053 --> 00:56:19.057
 Improve agriculture and give people greater hope. 

00:56:19.057 --> 00:56:28.083
 Doing so will not change the ideas of Usama bin Laden’s, 

00:56:28.083 --> 00:56:34.013
 Their ideology is deeply entrenched, it is to attack the West. 

00:56:34.013 --> 00:56:37.090
 But doing so will change what they want to recruit 

00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:39.063
 young people, 

00:56:39.063 --> 00:56:42.097
 This is important. 

00:56:42.097 --> 00:56:47.050
 In the long run, this is at least as important as any military action we can take, 

00:56:47.050 --> 00:56:49.013
 Even more important. 

00:56:49.013 --> 00:56:50.043
 Ok? 

00:56:50.043 --> 00:56:54.053
 it is good. I feel very happy. 

00:56:54.053 --> 00:56:57.010
 Thank you very much. 

00:56:57.010 --> 00:57:02.017
 First of all, I want to say that I admire each of you for your English level, 

00:57:02.017 --> 00:57:05.077
 Obviously you work hard. 

00:57:05.077 --> 00:57:10.087
 The opportunity to meet you makes me feel 

00:57:10.087 --> 00:57:14.067
 The future of US-China relations is full of hope. 

00:57:14.067 --> 00:57:18.023
 I hope many of you have the opportunity to come to the United States 

00:57:18.023 --> 00:57:20.073
 Travel and visit. 

00:57:20.073 --> 00:57:22.030
 You will be welcomed. 

00:57:22.030 --> 00:57:26.010
 I believe you will find the American people to the Chinese people 

00:57:26.010 --> 00:57:28.017
 Is very enthusiastic. 

00:57:28.017 --> 00:57:33.030
 I am convinced that with you young people 

00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:35.057
 And the young Americans I know, 

00:57:35.057 --> 00:57:39.063
 Our two great nations will continue to prosper, 

00:57:39.063 --> 00:57:44.020
 And help create a more peaceful and secure world. 

00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:46.027
 Therefore, thank you very much. 

00:57:46.027 --> 00:57:47.030
 thank you all. 00:57:47.030,00:00:00.000 (applause)
