00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.859
President Obama:
Good morning, everybody. In times of great

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.269
challenge in our country and around the world,
Americans have always come together to lend

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:15.450
a hand and to serve others and to do what's
right. That's what the American people have

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.540
been doing in recent days with their extraordinary
generosity and contributions to the Haitian

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.110
people. At this moment, we're moving forward
with one of the largest relief efforts in

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:32.960
our history -- to save lives and to deliver
relief that averts an even larger catastrophe.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.170
The two leaders with me today will ensure
that this is matched by a historic effort

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.390
that extends beyond our government, because
America has no greater resource than the strength

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.060
and the compassion of the American people.
We just met in the Oval Office -- an office

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.290
they both know well. And I'm pleased that
President George W. Bush and President Bill

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.170
Clinton have agreed to lead a major fundraising
effort for relief: the Clinton Bush Haiti

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.409
Fund. On behalf of the American people, I
want to thank both of you for returning to

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:14.700
service and leading this urgent mission. This
is a model that works. After the terrible

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.359
tsunami in Asia, President Bush turned to
President Clinton and the first President

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:25.450
Bush to lead a similar fund. That effort raised
substantial resources for the victims of that

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.130
disaster -- money that helped save lives,
deliver aid, and rebuild communities. And

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.850
that's exactly what the people of Haiti desperately
need right now. Every day that goes by, we

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.829
learn more about the horrifying scope of this
catastrophe -- destruction and suffering that

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.340
defies comprehension. Entire communities buried
under mountains of concrete. Families sleeping

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.299
in the streets. Injured desperate for care.
Many thousands feared dead. That's why thousands

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.549
of American personnel -- civilian and military
 -- are on the scene working to distribute

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.249
clean drinking water and food and medicine,
and thousands of tons of emergency food supplies

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:13.819
are arriving every day. It will be difficult.
It is an enormous challenge to distribute

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.180
this aid quickly and safely in a place that
has suffered such destruction. That's what

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.420
we're focused on now -- working closely with
our partners: the Haitian government, the

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.200
United Nations, and many organizations and
nations -- friends from Argentina and France,

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.230
from Dominican Republic and Brazil, and countries
all around the world. And Secretary Hillary

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.540
Clinton will be in Haiti today to meet with
President PrÃ©val and continue our close coordination

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.540
with his government. But we also know that
our longer-term effort will not be measured

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.480
in days and weeks; it will be measured in
months and even years. And that's why it's

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.439
so important to enlist and sustain the support
of the American people. That's why it's so

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.239
important to have a point of coordination
for all the support that extends beyond our

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:10.159
government. Here at home, Presidents Bush
and Clinton will help the American people

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.650
to do their part, because responding to a
disaster must be the work of all of us. Indeed,

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.390
those wrenching scenes of devastation remind
us not only of our common humanity but also

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.689
of our common responsibilities. This time
of suffering can and must be a time of compassion.

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:33.689
As the scope of the destruction became apparent,
I spoke to each of these gentlemen, and they

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:40.489
each asked the same simple question: How can
I help? In the days ahead they'll be asking

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:47.109
everyone what they can do -- individuals,
corporations, NGOs, and institutions. And

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:55.680
I urge everyone who wants to help to visit
www.clintonbushhaitifund.org.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.239
We're fortunate to have the
service of these two leaders.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.409
President Bush led America's response to the
Asian tsunami, aid and relief that prevented

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.349
even greater loss of life in the months after
that disaster. And his administration's efforts

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:16.349
to fight against HIV/AIDS in Africa treated
more than 10 million men, women, and children.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.750
As President, Bill Clinton helped restore
democracy in Haiti. As a private citizen,

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.630
he has helped to save the lives of millions
of people around the world. And as the United

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.920
Nations special envoy to Haiti, he understands
intimately the daily struggles and needs of

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:37.470
the Haitian people. And by coming together
in this way, these two leaders send an unmistakable

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.940
message to the people of Haiti and to the
people of the world: In these difficult hours,

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.040
America stands united. We stand united with
the people of Haiti, who have shown such incredible

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:55.010
resilience, and we will help them to recover
and to rebuild. Yesterday we witnessed a small

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.750
but remarkable display of that determination
 -- some of you may have seen it -- Haitians

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.500
with little more than the clothes on their
back marched peacefully through a ruined neighborhood,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:10.290
and despite all their loss and all their suffering
they sang songs of faith and songs of hope.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.170
These are the people we're called upon to
help. Those are the hopes that we're committed

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.860
to answering. That's why the three of us are
standing together today. And with that, I

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.860
would invite each President to say a few words.
I'm going to start with President Bush.

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:33.950
President Bush:
I join President Obama in expressing my sympathy

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:41.780
for the people of Haiti. I commend the President
for his swift and timely response to the disaster.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.000
I am so pleased to answer the call to work
alongside President Clinton to mobilize the

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:59.360
compassion of the American people. Like most
Americans, Laura and I have been following

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:07.000
the television coverage from Haiti. Our hearts
are broken when we see the scenes of little

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:15.000
children struggling without a mom or a dad,
or the bodies in the streets or the physical

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:22.270
damage of the earthquake. The challenges down
there are immense, but there's a lot of devoted

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:29.270
people leading the relief effort, from government
personnel who deployed into the disaster zone

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.160
to the faith-based groups that have made Haiti
a calling. The most effective way for Americans

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:42.160
to help the people of Haiti is to contribute
money. That money will go to organizations

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:49.540
on the ground and will be -- who will be able
to effectively spend it. I know a lot of people

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:57.360
want to send blankets or water -- just send
your cash. One of the things that the President

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:04.900
and I will do is to make sure your money is
spent wisely. As President Obama said, you

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:11.780
can look us up on HYPERLINK "http://clintonbushhaitifund.org"
clintonbushhaitifund.org . The Haitian people

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:18.780
have got a tough journey, yet it's amazing
how terrible tragedies can bring out the best

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:26.530
of the human spirit. We've all seen that firsthand
when American citizens responded to the tsunami

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:34.190
or to Katrina or to the earthquake in Pakistan.
And President Clinton and I are going to work

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:39.300
to tap that same spirit of giving to help
our brothers and sisters in the Caribbean.

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:46.300
Toward the end of my presidency, Laura made
a trip down to Haiti to look at the Emergency

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:55.630
Plan for AIDS Relief programs down there.
I remember clearly her coming back and telling

00:07:55.650 --> 00:08:01.440
me about the energy and optimism of the people
of Haiti. There's just an unbelievable spirit

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:08.080
amongst the Haitian people. And while that
earthquake destroyed a lot, it didn't destroy

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.140
their spirit. So the people of Haiti will
recovery and rebuild, and as they do they

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:21.140
know they'll have a friend in the United States
of America. Mr. President, thank you for giving

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.270
me the chance to serve.
President Clinton:

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:32.270
First, I want to thank President Obama for
asking President Bush and me to do this, and

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:44.950
for what I believe has been a truly extraordinary
response on the part of the American government.

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:53.030
Because I've been working down there for nearly
a year as the U.N. special envoy, I've been

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:58.640
in constant touch with our people through
the U.N. on the ground, and you know we lost

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.820
a lot of our people there -- the largest loss
of life in the history of the United Nations

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:10.290
on a single day. The United States has been
there from the beginning. The military has

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:16.710
been great. The response by the State Department
and AID has been great. I just can't say enough

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:23.710
about it. And the people in Haiti know it,
and I'm grateful. Secondly, I'd like to thank

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:31.980
President Bush for agreeing to do this, and
for the concern he showed for Haiti. Before

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:38.130
this happened, my foundation worked with the
PEPFAR people on the AIDS problems in Haiti

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:44.380
and I saw how good they were and what they
did and how many lives they saved. Finally,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:51.380
let me say that -- I don't have to read the
Web site because they did -- but I want to

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:59.050
say something about this. Right now all we
need to do is get food and medicine and water

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:06.050
and a secure place for them to be. But when
we start the rebuilding effort, we want to

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:15.020
do what I did with the President's father
in the tsunami area. We want to be a place

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:21.740
where people can know their money will be
well spent; where we will ensure the ongoing

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:28.740
integrity of the process. And we want to stay
with this over the long run. My job with the

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.500
U.N. basically is not at all in conflict with
this because I'm sort of the outside guy.

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:41.130
My job is to work with the donor nations,
the international agencies, the business people

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.870
around the world to try to get them to invest
there, the nongovernmental organizations,

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:50.270
the Haitian diaspora community. I believe
before this earthquake Haiti had the best

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:55.480
chance in my lifetime to escape its history
 -- a history that Hillary and I have shared

00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:01.850
a tiny part of. I still believe that. The
Haitians want to just amend their development

00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:05.750
plan to take account of what's happened in
Port-au-Prince and west, figure out what they

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:10.770
got to do about that, and then go back to
implementing it. But it's going to take a

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:17.770
lot of help and a long time. So I'm just grateful
that President Bush wants to help, and I've

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:26.220
already figured out how I can get him to do
some things that he didn't sign on for. (laughter)

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:35.130
Again, I have no words to say what I feel
like. When you -- I was in those hotels that

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:42.680
collapsed. I had meals with people who are
dead. The cathedral church that Hillary and

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:49.680
I sat in 34 years ago is a total rubble. But
what these men have said is true: It is still

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:57.690
one of the most remarkable, unique places
I have ever been. And they can escape their

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:03.660
history and build a better future if we do
our part. And President Obama, thank you for

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:10.160
giving us a chance to do a little of that.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:15.190
President Obama:
Well, these gentlemen are going to do an extraordinary
job, but really what they're going to be doing

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:22.190
is just tapping into the incredible generosity,
the ingenuity, the can-do spirit of the American

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:29.670
people in helping our neighbors in need. So
I want to thank each of them not only for

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:35.589
being here today but what I know is going
to be an extraordinary effort. I want to make

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:40.870
sure that everybody got that Web site one
more time. Obviously we're just standing it

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:53.450
up, but it will immediately give people a
means to contact our offices --

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:58.820
www.clintonbushhaitifund.org.
And I just want to amplify one thing that

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:05.820
was said. We were talking in the back. In
any extraordinary catastrophe like this, the

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:12.980
first several weeks are just going to involve
getting immediate relief on the ground. And

00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:18.930
there are going to be some tough days over
the next several days. People are still trying

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:25.930
to figure out how to organize themselves.
There's going to be fear, anxiety, a sense

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:33.670
of desperation in some cases. I've been in
contact with President PrÃ©val. I've been

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:38.140
talking to the folks on the ground. We are
going to be making slow and steady progress,

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:44.450
and the key now is to -- for everybody in
Haiti to understand that there is going to

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:51.450
be sustained help on the way. But what these
gentlemen are going to be able to do is when

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:58.480
the news media starts seeing its attention
drift to other things but there's still enormous

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:06.230
needs on the ground, these two gentlemen of
extraordinary stature I think are going to

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:12.640
be able to help ensure that these efforts
are sustained. And that's why it's so important

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:16.250
and that's why I'm so grateful that they agreed
to do it. Thank you, gentlemen.
