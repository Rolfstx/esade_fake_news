00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:05.672
Before our main story tonight,

00:00:05.772 --> 00:00:07.139
I'd like to do something
a little different

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.442
and just quickly tell you
about a beloved icon

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.344
of my childhood,
and it's this man...

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:14.647 line:0%
WOMAN:<i> For 20 years he made
 the dreams of young people</i>

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:15.915 line:0%
<i> come true,</i>

00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:19.218 line:0%
<i> with his hugely popular</i>
Jim'll Fix It<i> program.</i>

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:22.021 line:0%
<i> Best known for his
 trademark jewelry,</i>

00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:25.858 line:0%
<i> track suits, tinted glasses,
 and Havana cigar.</i>

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:27.192
Now, I know it's
hard to believe,

00:00:27.293 --> 00:00:29.328
but that bizarre looking man,
Jimmy Savile,

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:30.797
was a national hero.

00:00:30.897 --> 00:00:33.299
We named places for him,
we gave him a knighthood,

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:35.368
we even put up
this statue of him,

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:36.836
even though it clearly looks
more like

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.338
a cheese sculpture
of George Carlin

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:39.873
-that someone left in the sun.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:42.108
Now, he had a show called
<i> Jim'll Fix It,</i>

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:43.610
where he basically
granted wishes.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.179
And like many British kids,
I actually wrote to him.

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:47.180
I asked him

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.048
to make me the mascot
for Liverpool football club,

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:50.350
and he never wrote back.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:53.486
Which I'm actually glad about,
because after he died,

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.655
Britain began to find out
who he really was.

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.223
And the truth was horrific.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.126
He's gone from a much loved
entertainer,

00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:02.028
and respected charity
fundraiser,

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:04.764
to a man described by
Scotland Yard

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:06.465
as a predatory sex offender.

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:08.467 line:0%
<i> Jimmy Savile's headstone
 was here</i>

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:10.103 line:0%
<i> for less than three weeks.</i>

00:01:10.336 --> 00:01:13.739 line:0%
<i> His epitaph read,
 "It was good while it lasted."</i>

00:01:13.839 --> 00:01:14.841
Oh!

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:16.910
That is an unsettling thing

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.377
to have written
on his gravestone.

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:20.880
Although to be fair,
nearly every famous epitaph

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:23.849
would sound horrifying written
on a sex offender's gravestone.

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:27.319
From Dean Martin's "Everybody
loves somebody sometime,"

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:29.922
to Rodney Dangerfield's
"There goes the neighborhood."

00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:31.491
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-You know, funny, funny.

00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:32.925
But if he'd been
a sex offender,

00:01:33.125 --> 00:01:34.126
not so much.

00:01:34.426 --> 00:01:36.729
The point is, Savile's
headstone was taken down,

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.866
as was that sign,
and that creepy statue,

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:41.768
because once we found out
that he was a monster,

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:43.636
we accepted it was
no longer appropriate

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:45.070
to publicly glorify him.

00:01:45.304 --> 00:01:47.639
Which actually brings us
to our main story tonight...

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.841
the Confederacy.

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:51.444
America's tracksuit
sex offender.

00:01:51.544 --> 00:01:53.712
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-Now, in recent years,

00:01:53.812 --> 00:01:56.816
there has been a robust debate
over Confederate symbols.

00:01:56.916 --> 00:02:00.420 line:0%
From flags being taken down,
to statues being removed,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.688 line:0%
to the white nationalist
rallies in Charlottesville.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.423
Both the one that
ended in violence in August,

00:02:04.523 --> 00:02:06.659
and another that happened
just last night.

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.395
So as this debate is clearly
not going away,

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:11.630
we wanted to take a look
at some of the arguments.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.466
Because you don't
have to look hard

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:15.200
to find people very upset

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:17.870
at the idea of Confederate
statues being taken away.

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.505 line:0%
You can't change history.

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:23.443 line:0%
You can't pick and choose
what you decide is history.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:24.810 line:0%
I think they oughta
just leave 'em alone

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.646 line:0%
and leave 'em
where they are, you know.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:27.713 line:0%
They're part of history.

00:02:27.813 --> 00:02:30.383 line:0%
I just don't think
we can erase our history.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:33.052 line:0%
It may not represent
the best idea...

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.922 line:0%
that anybody ever came up with.

00:02:36.856 --> 00:02:39.792 line:0%
But nevertheless,
it's part of our history.

00:02:39.892 --> 00:02:42.495 line:0%
And, uh,
I think it should stay there.

00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.297
You know what,
I'll give him this, he is right

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:46.198
that the Confederacy
and everything that came with it

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.101
is, to put it mildly,
"not the best idea...

00:02:49.201 --> 00:02:50.702
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-anybody ever came up with."

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.872
Because that of course
is making grilled cheese

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.607
on a toaster turned sideways.

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:57.076
That is a billion-dollar idea

00:02:57.176 --> 00:02:58.944
that is also
completely worthless.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:00.713
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-But they're also right

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:01.781
about one thing.

00:03:01.881 --> 00:03:03.682
We should
remember our history,

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:05.217
so tonight, let's do that.

00:03:05.317 --> 00:03:08.087
And let's look at the unique
heritage of these symbols.

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.223
Starting with the fact
that there are a lot more

00:03:10.323 --> 00:03:11.491
than you might expect.

00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:13.126 line:0%
REPORTER:
<i>The Southern Poverty Law Center</i>

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:17.129 line:0%
<i> found some 1,500 Confederate
 memorials across the country.</i>

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:20.699 line:0%
<i> More than 700 of them
 are statues and monuments,</i>

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.035 line:0%
<i> and ten U.S. military bases</i>

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:25.305 line:0%
<i> are named for
 Confederate officers.</i>

00:03:25.405 --> 00:03:26.405
Think about that.

00:03:26.805 --> 00:03:29.775
There are U.S. military bases
named for Confederate officers.

00:03:29.875 --> 00:03:33.245
And they were the enemy.
They killed U.S. soldiers.

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:35.147
That's like finding out that
Nancy Kerrigan

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:37.516
-named her child Tonya Harding.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.753
Why would you do that?
That's a weird choice.

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:45.224
And tributes to the Confederacy
are everywhere in the South,

00:03:45.324 --> 00:03:47.660
and notably some
in the North too.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.929
And that map doesn't include
kitschy ways

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:52.865
that the Civil War is presented,
like at this family restaurant:

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.735
ANNOUNCER:
<i> Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede</i>

00:03:55.835 --> 00:03:58.737
<i> brings a rip roaring
 taste of America to life.</i>

00:03:58.838 --> 00:04:01.974
<i> Dixie's Stampede
 is a musical extravaganza</i>

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:03.409
<i> of sight and sound.</i>

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.579
<i> Centered around a friendly
 North-South rivalry,</i>

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.582
<i> friendly servers bring
the delicious four course feast</i>

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:10.816
<i> right to you.</i>

00:04:10.916 --> 00:04:12.685
<i> Including a whole
 rotisserie chicken,</i>

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:15.655
<i> and all the Pepsi, iced tea,
 or coffee you like.</i>

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:18.524
Yes. That is
a Confederate soldier

00:04:18.625 --> 00:04:21.427
serving a small child
all the Pepsi she likes.

00:04:21.527 --> 00:04:22.762
Which is still remarkably

00:04:22.862 --> 00:04:25.130
only Pepsi's second worst
ad campaign.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.465
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING
AND CHEERING)

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:30.536
And the thing is if you grew up
with experiences like that,

00:04:30.636 --> 00:04:33.572
it can seem like the Civil War
is just a friendly rivalry.

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:36.108
A fun, colorful part
of U.S. history.

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:39.145
But that omits the key fact
about the Civil War.

00:04:39.245 --> 00:04:42.715
The Confederacy was fighting for
the preservation of slavery.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.150
And that's not my opinion,
that is just a fact.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.286
There are many ways
that we know this.

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:49.288
Slavery is mentioned in
multiple state's

00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:50.957
declarations of secession

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:52.191
with Mississippi saying,

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.226
"Our position
is thoroughly identified

00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:56.295
with the institution
of slavery."

00:04:56.396 --> 00:04:58.598
The Confederate Constitution
contains a clause

00:04:58.698 --> 00:05:00.399
enshrining slavery forever.

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:02.334
And then there's the speech
Alexander Stephens,

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:05.003
the Confederate vice president
gave in 1861,

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:07.573
in which he articulated
the basic principles

00:05:07.673 --> 00:05:08.808
for the Confederate nation.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.343
ALEXANDER STEPHENS:
<i> Its foundations are laid.</i>

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:14.013
<i> Its cornerstone rests upon
 the great truth</i>

00:05:14.113 --> 00:05:16.548
<i> that the Negro is not
 equal to the white man.</i>

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:19.919
<i> That slavery, subordination
 to the superior race,</i>

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:22.488
<i> is his natural and
 normal condition.</i>

00:05:23.055 --> 00:05:26.893
Wow. Subordination to
the superior race.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:28.728
That is explicit.

00:05:28.828 --> 00:05:31.463
If the Confederacy was not
about slavery,

00:05:31.563 --> 00:05:33.232
somebody should really
go back in time

00:05:33.332 --> 00:05:35.467
and tell the fucking
Confederacy that.

00:05:35.567 --> 00:05:37.603
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
-And yet, remarkably,

00:05:37.703 --> 00:05:40.239
many people think the Civil War
was over something else.

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:42.608
REPORTER 2:<i> When people
were asked, "What do they think</i>

00:05:42.708 --> 00:05:45.078
<i> the main cause
 of the Civil War is?"</i>

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:49.081
<i> 48% said,
 "Mainly about states' rights."</i>

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:52.485
<i> Only 38% said,
 "Mainly about slavery."</i>

00:05:52.585 --> 00:05:54.853
<i> Nine percent said "both."</i>

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:56.822
And that is amazing.

00:05:56.922 --> 00:06:00.760
Only 38% thought the Civil War
was mainly about slavery.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.494
In other words,
look to your left,

00:06:02.594 --> 00:06:03.796
now look to your right,

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:06.498
statistically all three of you
live in a country

00:06:06.598 --> 00:06:08.734
where only 38% percent of people

00:06:08.834 --> 00:06:11.370
-think the Civil War
was mainly about slavery.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:14.907
And on that "states' rights"
argument, for the record,

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:18.211
the Southern states were
ardently pro-states' rights.

00:06:18.311 --> 00:06:20.579
But with some
glaring exceptions.

00:06:20.679 --> 00:06:22.547
Notably, when Northern states

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:25.184
passed laws to help protect
runaway slaves,

00:06:25.284 --> 00:06:26.852
the South wanted
the federal government

00:06:26.952 --> 00:06:28.887
to override those states laws.

00:06:28.987 --> 00:06:30.822
So, they loved states' rights,

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:33.558
as long as they were
the right states' rights.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:36.529
The wrong states' rights
would be states' wrongs,

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.430
wrongs which would
need to be righted

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:41.300
by the right states' rights--
look, to put it really simply,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.968
they just wanted to
own black people,

00:06:43.068 --> 00:06:44.903
-and they didn't much care how.
-(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:06:45.003 --> 00:06:45.971
That's a fact!

00:06:46.272 --> 00:06:49.542
But that's a very hard fact
for some people to accept.

00:06:49.642 --> 00:06:51.143
Especially if a member
of your family

00:06:51.243 --> 00:06:52.377
fought for the Confederacy.

00:06:52.477 --> 00:06:55.014
And sometimes,
the understandable desire

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:58.050
to want to distance
your relative from that cause

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:00.286
can lead to people
distorting the cause itself.

00:07:00.386 --> 00:07:01.687
Just watch as one man

00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:03.722
at a community meeting
in North Carolina

00:07:03.822 --> 00:07:05.458
defended a Confederate statue

00:07:05.558 --> 00:07:07.259
by talking about
his family history.

00:07:07.793 --> 00:07:11.030
My great grandfather
was a Confederate soldier.

00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:13.465
And I was proud of that.

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:16.702
Because my opinion of his fight

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:20.072
was for his rights.

00:07:20.572 --> 00:07:22.175
I don't know what
his rights were.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:23.175
I wasn't there.

00:07:23.809 --> 00:07:26.145
He was dead long before
I came along.

00:07:26.946 --> 00:07:30.015
But I'm really concerned
about our monument.

00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:31.484

00:07:32.585 --> 00:07:36.755
It reminds me that I got
a little rebel in me.

You know, we all want to
kind of be independent.

00:07:40.726 --> 00:07:44.397
We all have a little
rebel in us, even the ladies.

It is hard to know
the motivations

of any individual soldier.

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:02.581
What we do know is that
again, collectively,

00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.617
they were fighting to preserve
the institution of slavery.

00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:07.920
And I do get, honestly,
I honestly get

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:10.722
wanting a more comfortable
history for your family.

you can't invent

a more comfortable history
for your country.

00:08:15.227 --> 00:08:18.464
Because you would be erasing
the actual painful experiences

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:19.798

And the news clip
actually cut out there,

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:22.027
but we were so intrigued to
find out what his response was

00:09:22.127 --> 00:09:23.395
we tracked it down.

00:09:23.495 --> 00:09:26.899

you're going to be surprised.

-My family was!

-They were poor,

It is comments like that one

00:09:48.854 --> 00:09:50.289
that landed this guy
on the cover of

(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.830
And look, that-- that is clearly
an intense example.

00:09:57.930 --> 00:10:00.499
But denial of this painful
part of history

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:01.967
can take many forms.

00:10:02.234 --> 00:10:04.203
Look at PBS's
<i> Finding Your Roots,</i>

00:10:04.303 --> 00:10:06.171

celebrities' family histories,

00:10:07.706 --> 00:10:09.474
and he often finds some shit.

00:10:09.774 --> 00:10:12.110
Famously, Ben Affleck
pulled strings

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:13.979
to get the show
to remove all references

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:15.413
to his slave-owning ancestors.

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:16.916
And though he later apologized,

00:10:17.016 --> 00:10:19.251
that impulse right there
is not good.

00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:21.220
Because it sanitizes history.

00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.221
And while there is no
easy way to respond

00:10:23.322 --> 00:10:25.191
to learning that kind of
horrible information,

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:27.960

how one relative of his died.

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:33.632

just try not to live a life

comes from Larry David,

a real one-two punch.

my great-grandfather

00:11:16.008 --> 00:11:17.343
fought for the South?

In the Civil War?

Larry David
is not responsible

00:11:55.981 --> 00:11:57.183
for what his ancestors did.

00:11:57.283 --> 00:11:58.249
None of us are.

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:00.786

because I'm English.

(LAUGHING CONTINUES)

00:12:07.225 --> 00:12:10.729
But-- but we do have to reckon
personally, and as a country

00:12:10.829 --> 00:12:12.230
with what our heritage means.

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.467
You can't ignore it like Batman,

00:12:14.567 --> 00:12:16.168
you can't say
it's something else

00:12:16.268 --> 00:12:17.837
like town meeting Santa,

00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:20.005
you've got to actively,
painfully,

00:12:20.105 --> 00:12:21.473
come to grips with slavery,

00:12:21.573 --> 00:12:23.642
and the lasting benefits
and disadvantages

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:24.609
that if conferred.

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:26.545
In ways that, frankly,
we haven't yet.

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:30.081
And that actually brings us back
to Confederate monuments,

00:12:30.181 --> 00:12:32.050
because there is
something about them that

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:34.954
that symbolizes our reluctance
to have that conversation

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:37.056
and that is the dates
that they went up.

00:12:37.156 --> 00:12:38.957
Because while some
initial memorials

00:12:39.057 --> 00:12:42.194
were built mainly in cemeteries,
shortly after the Civil War,

00:12:42.394 --> 00:12:45.263

much, much later.

of the years that
they were dedicated shows,

00:12:58.443 --> 00:13:01.413
there was a big spike
from 1900 to 1920

00:13:01.513 --> 00:13:03.682
as white southerners were
re-asserting their dominance

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:05.450
through things like
Jim Crow laws,

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:08.454
uh, with another spike in the
50s and 60s

00:13:08.554 --> 00:13:10.822
as the Civil Rights Movement
was gaining steam,

00:13:10.922 --> 00:13:12.291
so those statues weren't so much

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:14.326
commemorating
recently fallen dead,

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:16.862
as sending

to African-Americans.

00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:22.400

what statues are often for.

"We love freedom."

00:13:24.837 --> 00:13:25.837
This one says,

"The most notable thing

-it was... "About yay big."

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:46.392
But... look, for some
Confederate statues though,

00:13:46.492 --> 00:13:49.628
for some Confederate statues
the intent is crystal clear.

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:51.597
In that town meeting
from before,

00:13:51.697 --> 00:13:52.898
the statue that
they were debating

00:13:52.998 --> 00:13:55.734
was this one, which went up
in 1914

00:13:55.967 --> 00:13:59.071
and a leader of
that county's chapter of the KKK

00:13:59.405 --> 00:14:01.273
gave a speech at its dedication,

00:14:01.373 --> 00:14:03.175
calling the occasion
an opportunity

00:14:03.275 --> 00:14:05.711
"To recall the achievements
of the great and good

00:14:05.811 --> 00:14:07.880

00:14:08.113 --> 00:14:11.149
Which, again, is pretty
on-the-nose right there.

00:14:11.249 --> 00:14:13.118
And the largest
Confederate memorial,

00:14:13.218 --> 00:14:15.254
the carving on Stone Mountain
in Georgia,

00:14:15.354 --> 00:14:18.523
is located where the
20th century KKK was born.

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:21.126
It depicts
three Confederate leaders

00:14:21.326 --> 00:14:24.730
on horseback, and
it was completed in 1972,

00:14:24.963 --> 00:14:26.898
so that means
there is color footage

00:14:26.998 --> 00:14:28.000

00:17:16.768 --> 00:17:17.969

-(LAUGHING CONTINUES)
-And-- and look,

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:24.008
there are clearly people
deserving of statues

00:17:24.108 --> 00:17:25.643
who were imperfect humans.

00:17:25.744 --> 00:17:28.112
And sometimes our standards
change over time,

00:17:28.212 --> 00:17:29.414
which can then get tricky,

00:17:29.514 --> 00:17:31.082
because you're judging
historical figures

00:17:31.182 --> 00:17:32.017
by modern standards.

00:17:32.117 --> 00:17:33.852
But for many
Confederate monuments,

00:17:34.119 --> 00:17:37.189

well after the Civil War,

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:38.357

So, any city that decides
to keep a statue of him

00:18:23.302 --> 00:18:25.670
should at the very least
add a speech bubble saying,

perhaps the first step
