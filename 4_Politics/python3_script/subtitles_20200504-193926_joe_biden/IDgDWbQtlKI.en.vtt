00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:07.680
 I am not discussing what happened ten years ago but about what happened five years ago: 

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:13.280
 Five years ago, things here were really scary. 

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:16.800
 Drought, high temperature, strong wind. 

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:22.320
 The dry soil was easily blown away by the wind. 

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:30.400
 They set up a plan so that we can move to another area. 

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.600
 The land became fertile again. 

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.000
 There has been tremendous progress in comparison here. 

00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:17.680
 Our fruit trees had withered before, but now they grow again 

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:22.840
 The number of species is even greater than before. 

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.800
 These are indeed very good results. 

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.160
 We now have food security guarantees. 

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:33.760
 Our children can go to school. We have a better life. 

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.880
 We no longer need to ask the government for support and help... 

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.240
 ...Thanks to the changes brought about by the actions implemented 

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:48.880
 The wild animals that once disappeared are back. 

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.480
 Even the leopard is back. 

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:14.960
 I am from that area. 

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.920
 Will he come tomorrow? -Yes, tomorrow; he will come. 

00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:25.320
 People don't understand this project very well. They don't understand why they need this project. 

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:31.680
 They want us to plant trees everywhere. 

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.000
 Even on good fertile land. 

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.280
 Even there. 

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.720
 Okay, what about the next generation? 

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.560
 You cannot eat trees. 

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:13.680
 The purpose of this plan is to put a "hat" on the top of the mountain 

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:17.880
 Wear a "belt" in the middle of the mountainside and "shoes" at the foot of the mountain. 

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.520
 Planting a tree on the top of the mountain can also put a hat on the top of the mountain. 

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.280
 Terraces are like belts in the middle. 

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.560
 A dam also constitutes shoes. 

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.400
 So that everything can grow again... 

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:50.440
 The economy and our lives will improve. 

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:07.080
 You must trim them at the top and place them around the saplings.
