00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:02.900
Passwords are like the
cockroaches of the internet.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.040
They really, despite all of our best
efforts, are very hard to kill off.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.310
And companies have been trying
to do it for years.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.640
The average office worker in the United
States must keep track of between 20

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.430
to 40 different username
and password combinations.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:19.700
With so many passwords to remember, it's no
wonder why many of us use the

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.630
same ones over and over, or have
a running list of passwords saved somewhere

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.790
on our computers, phones or notebooks.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.520
Passwords are a very serious
and expensive security risk.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.710
It's why companies like Microsoft, Apple and
Google are trying to reduce our

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.690
dependence on them. But the question is,
can these companies break our bad

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:45.020
habits? Passwords, by themselves,
are just not that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.340
secure. In a 2015 interview with
John Oliver, Edward Snowden explained just

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.660
how easy it is to
crack a typical password.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.070
Bad passwords are one of the
easiest ways to compromise a system.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.690
For somebody who has a very
common eight character password, it can

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.610
literally take less than a second for
a computer to go through the

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.310
possibilities and pull
that password out.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.260
I think we're going to have a no
passwords future because it just gets rid

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.350
of a lot of problems.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.960
You never know when the bad guy has
your password, at the end of the day.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.540
That's Kevin Mitnick. He's pretty well
known in the hacker community.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.990
I started off many, many years
ago as a black hat hacker.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.090
I wasn't hacking to cause
harm or to make money.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.000
It was all about the intellectual
challenge, curiosity and seduction of

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.630
adventure. And then I pushed the envelope, and
I pushed it so far, I became

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.570
the world's most wanted hacker.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.840
And I was pursued by
federal law enforcement agencies.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.000
And they eventually caught up with me and
I ended up serving five years in

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.400
federal prison. Nowadays, Mitnick says
he's an ethical hacker, assisting

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.080
companies to identify their security
vulnerabilities and helping to fix

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.250
them. And finding your usernames and
passwords, it's much easier than you

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.190
might think. There's a site
out there called weleakinfo.com.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.150
So what weleakinfo is, it's a site
that has aggregated a bunch of data

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.570
breaches. And so what happens is
the data, namely your username and

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.070
passwords that are on these data
breaches, get aggregated because they're

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.170
publicly available.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.170
And there's sites like weleakinfo, that kind
of make it like a Google, where

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.500
you can actually just put in an email
address of yourself or a friend, and

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.430
all the prior data breaches that
contained your username or your email

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.930
address, it actually
reveals the password.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.750
All it takes to find the site is
a quick Google search, and users can get

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.830
access to more than 10,000 data
breaches for as low as $2.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.840
And it's not even the only
website to offer these services.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.680
Simply put, passwords are not fit
for purpose for today's networked economy.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.320
They present challenges to consumers in
the sense that they're either hard

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.560
to remember or they're too easy to
remember, in which case are easier to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.380
mimic and steal. For businesses, they
represent a huge liability, in the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.770
sense that the vast majority of
data breaches are caused by passwords,

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.390
either passwords that slip from an employee
and expose a database or allows

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.400
other bad actors to
get into their systems.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.220
So passwords present challenges
across the board.

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.510
A report that looked at 2,013 confirmed
data breaches found that 29 percent

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.430
of those breaches involved the
use of stolen credentials.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.220
In another study, researchers found that the
average cost of a data breach

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.490
in the U.S. was more than $8 million.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.050
And even when passwords are not stolen,
companies can lose a lot of money

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.600
resetting them. Our research has shown
that the average fully-loaded cost of

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.330
a help desk call to reset a password
is anywhere between $40 or $50 per

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.450
call. Generally speaking, a typical employee
contacts a help desk about

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.210
somewhere between six and ten times
a year on password-related issues.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.550
So if you just do the simple multiplication
of six to ten times times $50

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.070
per call, times the number of
employees in your organization, you're talking

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.800
significantly hundreds of thousands of
dollars or even potentially millions

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.100
of dollars a year. And that's just
really the IT operations costs, that's

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.500
not really factoring necessarily the productivity
cost that gets lost by the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.540
user having to wait for maybe 20
minutes, 30 minutes or even longer to

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.230
actually have the password issue
resolved to their satisfaction.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.560
In large companies like Microsoft, Apple
and Google with upwards of 100,000

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.690
employees each, these costs
can quickly add up.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.120
A former Microsoft executive told CNN in
2018, that the company spends more

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.830
than $2 million dollars each month in
help desk calls, helping people to

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.030
change their passwords.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.980
With the details of our
personal and professional lives increasingly

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.110
residing in the digital realm, those
costs are likely to grow.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:52.210
The first use of the computer password dates
back to the early 1960s at MIT.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:56.650
At the time, computers were these
huge contraptions that could only manage

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.360
the work of one person at a time.

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.500
This limitation frustrated Fernando Corbató, who
came up with the computer

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.520
time sharing system.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.060
CTSS was an operating system which
distributed a computer's processing power

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.590
so that multiple people could
use it at once.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.080
This naturally led to
the issue of privacy.

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.260
So Corbató created the password.

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.310
Ironically, the first computer to use passwords
was also the first one to be

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.400
hacked. One of the researchers in Corbató's
lab found that he needed more

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.450
time to complete his work than
the weekly hours allotted to him.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.420
So he printed out all the passwords stored
on the system, and used them to

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:32.950
log in as his colleagues.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.610
The conventional rules of password
creation adopted by companies, federal

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.150
agencies and universities were attributed to
a document released by the

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.380
National Institute of Standards
and Technology in 2004.

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.110
The documents suggested that users should
have a minimum of eight character

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.650
passwords and that those passwords should
include at least one uppercase

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.270
letter, one lowercase letter, one number
and 1one special character, and be

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:57.310
changed regularly.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:01.780
But in 2017, NIST
rewrote the password rules.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.230
This time, the agency suggested using
long, easy to remember phrases instead

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.730
of crazy characters, and only changing your
password if it might have been

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.440
hacked. Passwords have come a
long way since the 1960s.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.670
With innovations such as fingerprint
readers and face scanning on

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.750
smartphones, verifying your identity now often
goes beyond just entering a

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.860
password. This comes in the form
of two-factor and two-step authentication.

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.780
There's three forms of authentication.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.150
One is what you know, such
as a password or a pin.

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.920
The second thing is what you have.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.630
So possession of a
device in your hands.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.760
And a third means of authentication is
who you are, like a biometric.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:41.050
The password alone is the
highest risk way of authenticating.

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.810
And that that leads to phishing and
data breaches and all the nefarious

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:48.060
things we see on the web today.
Any form of two-factor authentication is

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.730
better than passwords alone. What I want
to note, though, is that not all

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:52.150
two-factor authentication is
created equal.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:57.040
Things like getting SMS messages, so a text
message with a pin code, is both

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.740
inconvenient but also can be spoofed and
is not a foolproof means of second

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:06.570
factor authentication. NIST even restricted
the use of one-time passwords

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.880
being sent over SMS as
a means of two-factor authentication.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.620
For something to be two-factor
versus two-step, the authentication elements

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.530
must come from
two separate categories.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:20.720
An example of two-factor authentication is
withdrawing money from an ATM.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:24.440
First, you insert your bank
card, something that you possess.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:27.170
And then you were asked for
a pin, something that, you know.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.920
Biometrics are the newest form of
authentication and have risen in

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.070
popularity thanks to smartphones that
include fingerprint readers and

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:35.330
face-scanning cameras.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:39.930
Meanwhile, digital assistants like Siri,
Alexa and Google Assistant have

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.010
advanced voice
recognition technologies.

00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:46.590
In fact, a number of banks, including
Chase and Barclays, now allow their

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.860
customers to verify their
identity using voice biometrics.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.260
When customers call in, their voice
is automatically matched to a previously

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:58.010
recorded voiceprint, that's made up of
more than 100 characteristics such as

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.800
pitch, accent and shape of your mouth.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.690
One organization that's been at
the forefront of bringing two-factor

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:09.390
authentication standards to the masses
is the FIDO Alliance.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:14.380
The FIDO Alliance, which stands for,
Fast Identity Online, is a consortium

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.840
of more than 250 companies who are
working together to reduce the industry's

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.470
reliance on passwords by
standardizing two-factor authentication.

00:08:23.390 --> 00:08:27.950
This past year, we've seen FIDO become
a core part of the Android and

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:32.350
Windows operating system, meaning that any Android
7 or later handset or any

00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:36.730
Windows 10 machine can leverage actual
onboard biometrics for that device.

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:40.660
So a fingerprint reader, a face scanner,
whatever it might be, to log in

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:41.730
rather than using passwords.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.140
Other companies that work with the
FIDO Alliance include eBay, Facebook,

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.160
Twitter, PayPal and Bank of America.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.380
Even the U.S. government
has adopted the standard.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.450
FIDO's big advantage over other standards
comes down to where it stores

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:56.900
users' personal information.

00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.400
The core problem with passwords is
that they reside on a server.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.650
The problem with that is that when it
sits on a server, they can be stolen

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.750
by a hacker. Additionally, someone can
impersonate you quite easily, either

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.480
by phishing your credentials or by buying
your credentials off the Dark Web

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:14.740
and then trying to stuff
them into the account.

00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.110
Everything FIDO does is local on the
device, which does a couple of things.

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:20.180
One, it's easier.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.930
But perhaps most important,
it protects your privacy.

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.730
So you can always change
your password if it's hacked.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.780
But you really can't
take your face back.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.110
You can't take your fingerprint back.

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:33.040
So it's very important that companies
that are using biometrics use

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.190
local-match biometrics, meaning match-on-device, which
is what FIDO supports

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:40.530
to protect user privacy and
have enhanced user experience.

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.960
Microsoft has been hinting about getting
rid of the password for years.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.800
Let me move over to my Surface Pro 4.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.540
I don't know if
you noticed what happened.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.930
It recognized that I was just standing
in front of the computer and it

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:57.490
logged me in. And this is
the power of Windows Hello.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.210
Where it does the face recognition
and logs you right in.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:05.100
I mean, think about one of the
biggest issues of security is passwords.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:10.040
So one of the things that we are
working on is a world where passwords are

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:12.760
not going to be the ones
that, you know, get hacked.

00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.630
But you really have other biometrics
that really help us secure our

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.880
computing interfaces.

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:19.970
Microsoft sees 6.5

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:21.900
trillion hacking incidents per year.

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.800
That's why 90 percent of its employees
can now log into the corporate

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.210
network without a password.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.940
We are on a mission
to be password less.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.460
We've built password less
technology into the OS.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:37.270
And we tell customers, of course, that
it's much more secure than actual

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:41.040
passwords because about 70 percent of
phishing attacks today still are

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.850
caused by stolen passwords.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:45.420
So what we've recommended is
that customers use biometrics.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.130
At Microsoft, we use
Windows Hello for business.

00:10:47.130 --> 00:10:49.180
I look at my computer to
log on in the morning.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:52.260
That's how I authenticate. If I'm on
my phone, I'm using my thumbprint.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:55.620
We don't see our passwords anymore because
that is, the user and the

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:57.760
password or the weakest link
in your security system.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.860
Microsoft introduced Windows Hello to customers
in 2015 with its devices

00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:07.260
running Windows 10. Windows Hello allowed
users to ditch the password and

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:10.420
log into their devices with just
their face, fingerprint or pin.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.790
Like FIDO, Microsoft has said it
stores user biometrics on the device

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.910
instead of on a cloud.

00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:20.540
In 2018, Microsoft announced that it
would support logging into Windows 10

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:24.780
with FIDO2 compatible devices, such as
hardware keys made by Yubiko.

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.120
We've been on a mission
to eliminate passwords altogether.

00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:34.740
And, you know, we're focusing on
passwordless log in experience that's both

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:36.660
secure and the user friendly.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.400
And we've seen a lot of success
with our authenticator app for consumer.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:43.910
And so we'll bring that to Azure AD.

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:47.840
Microsoft Authenticator is an app that
allows users to take advantage of

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:52.180
two-factor authentication on any device, not
just those running Windows 10.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:57.340
Alex Simmons, Vice President of Microsoft's
identity division, said in a

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.070
tweet that the company has more than
80 million unique monthly users that

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:02.550
sign in with a passwordless method.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.770
Apple's been encouraging the use of
biometric authentication since it came

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:09.870
out with Touch ID on the
iPhone 5S back in 2013.

00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:14.780
The company called Touch ID the
gold standard for consumer device biometric

00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:18.600
protection until it introduced Face ID
on the iPhone X in 2017.

00:12:18.850 --> 00:12:25.650
And the data for Touch ID has been
1 in 50,000, meaning that the chance that

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.820
a random person could use their fingerprint
to unlock your iPhone has been

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.030
about 1 in 50,000 and it's been great.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:38.630
So what are the similar
statistics for Face ID?1

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:44.620
1 in a 1,000,000. Back in 2016,
Apple also introduced Auto Unlock, a feature

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:49.030
for MacOS. Today, when you first approach
your Mac to use it, the experience

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:53.390
is something like this. You open it
up, you're confronted with a password

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:57.070
field, and you type and then maybe
mistype, and then retype your password,

00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.080
and then you're in and using your Mac.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.290
But you know, for many of us,
we already have a device securely

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:06.850
authenticated to our wrists that already knows
who we are and could tell our

00:13:06.850 --> 00:13:11.600
Mac. And so then, when we open our Mac,
it could be a little bit more like

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:16.800
this. In its guidelines to app
developers, Apple stresses that apps should

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:20.780
support biometric authentication whenever possible
and that apps should only

00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:24.540
ask for a username and password as
a fallback, if the first method fails.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.830
Google has also been working to make
passwords a thing of the past.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:32.890
The company has required its employees
to use physical security keys since

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.700
early 2017, and has seen
a huge reduction in phishing.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.540
In August of 2018, the
company released Titan to consumers.

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:44.600
Titan is a physical key that allows
users to take advantage of two-factor

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.220
authentication on their
computers or smartphones.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.660
In 2019, Google announced that phones running
Android 7 would all come with

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:53.880
a built-in security
key using Bluetooth.

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.880
A few months later, Google extended
that function to iOS devices, meaning

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.930
that iPhone and iPad users could
now use their secondary Android smartphones

00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:06.690
as a security key whenever logging into
their Google accounts on an iOS

00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:11.070
device. While Microsoft's Windows 10
devices and Google's new Android

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:15.400
devices are FIDO2 certified, Apple has been
slower to adopt the standard in

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.800
its products. Even though Touch ID
and Face ID made biometric authentication

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:23.770
the norm for unlocking our phones,
Apple's devices are still not FIDO

00:14:23.770 --> 00:14:26.350
certified. But Apple
is making strides.

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:31.650
Of late, Apple's been supporting FIDO technology
both on iOS and on MacOS.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.300
So the latest versions of their
operating system support FIDO, meaning that

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:38.220
if you're accessing a website that supports
FIDO on an Apple device, you'll

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.940
be able to leverage
FIDO authentication as well.

00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.060
The Department of Justice has also
been moving away from password

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.110
authentication. The agency adopted a
single-sign-on method back in 2017.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:52.920
One of the reasons why passwords persist
is that they are universal, they

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.200
can be used by anyone.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.670
There are no limitations.

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:57.650
There's no special
hardware requirements.

00:14:57.650 --> 00:15:00.190
You don't have to have a certain kind
of phone or certain kind of laptop.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.460
Anyone can use passwords. There are a
few key challenges to really moving

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.490
beyond being dependent on passwords.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.340
One of them is technical, and that's
FIDO has been seeking to address.

00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:14.480
And we've now created the technical
standards that are web standards for

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.940
authentication that does not
depend on passwords.

00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.090
Another challenge is behavioral.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.880
And we've been trained with this
risky way of authenticating using

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:26.300
passwords. We'll have to be untrained to
use simpler, but new mechanisms for

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.080
logging in. So I think there'll be
some behavioral changes that need to take

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.340
place, some education.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:36.190
You know, the good news is these are
changes are for the better and for the

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.760
simpler. And so, we think that people
will embrace these changes at the same

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.170
time as new technologies roll to market
to enable us collectively, on the

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.010
whole, to move beyond passwords.

00:15:46.310 --> 00:15:49.240
Experts say that getting rid of the
password will be a long journey,

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.590
especially when it comes to getting
people to ditch their bad habits.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:56.180
The consumer approaches will
be very much opt-in.

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.240
In other words, if users actually
want strong authentication, companies will

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.190
be able to provide it to them,
but just because it's available, doesn't mean

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:04.340
that every customer is going
to go for it.

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.140
You may now need to start collecting
information about the user like a

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.980
mobile phone number that you need
to use to communicate with them.

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:14.210
And perhaps users don't want to
provide that information or they're

00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:18.950
reluctant to. On the consumer side, I
believe passwords will be slower to

00:16:18.950 --> 00:16:23.290
get rid of. Which also means that
the risk of breaches of consumer sites

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.390
will persist for
the foreseeable future.
