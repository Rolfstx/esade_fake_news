 Translator: Alaa 'Mustafa Auditor: Riyad Almubarak 

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.300
 Well, this is like a police officer - 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.886
 The Baltimore city police officer in particular, is named Robert White. 

00:00:25.886 --> 00:00:27.814
 He gave me this outfit 

00:00:27.814 --> 00:00:31.452
 When he and I became best friends. 

00:00:31.452 --> 00:00:33.251
 But, you know, I met Robert for the first time - 

00:00:33.251 --> 00:00:37.523
 Well, I first heard about Robert White as a teenager, 

00:00:38.173 --> 00:00:40.114
 Then I met him later. 

00:00:40.114 --> 00:00:44.814
 I met him just one month after he was released from prison. 

00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:49.093
 He was in prison, serving a sentence 

00:00:49.093 --> 00:00:54.023
 On charges of assault with the intention of killing two black men, with a gun, 

00:00:54.023 --> 00:00:55.834
 And another punishment - 

00:00:55.834 --> 00:01:01.442
 To plot to bomb a synagogue in Baltimore. 

00:01:01.442 --> 00:01:04.036
 Now, I am a professional musician. 

00:01:04.036 --> 00:01:07.852
 I wander around this country and around the world, playing music. 

00:01:07.852 --> 00:01:12.550
 So how did I end up as a policeman? 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.891
 He worked in the police station 

00:01:15.891 --> 00:01:17.382
 During the day. 

00:01:17.382 --> 00:01:19.584
 But he also had another job, 

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:23.267
 Which requires a different type of uniform. 

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:33.118
 It was the great dragon (leader) of the Ku Klux Klan 

00:01:33.118 --> 00:01:35.002
 Of Maryland. 

00:01:35.002 --> 00:01:36.855
 This is his robe. 

00:01:36.855 --> 00:01:38.470
 This is what I wore 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.994
 When he plotted to blow up the synagogue 

00:01:40.994 --> 00:01:45.415
 When he planned to kill two black men with a gun. 

00:01:51.508 --> 00:01:54.722
 To understand why I own these items, 

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:57.610
 Let's take a small tour of my life. 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.056
 I was born in Chicago in 1958. 

00:02:01.056 --> 00:02:04.221
 At the age of ten, from 1968, 

00:02:04.221 --> 00:02:07.425
 My parents had to move to Belmont, Massachusetts - 

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:09.485
 A suburb of Boston. 

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:13.745
 I was one of two black children in the whole region - 

00:02:13.745 --> 00:02:15.328
 At least in school. 

00:02:15.328 --> 00:02:18.224
 I joined the boy scouts cub at the age of ten 

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:22.145
 Invited by some of my white male friends. 

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:26.368
 We marched from Lexington to Concord 

00:02:26.368 --> 00:02:29.211
 To commemorate Paul Revere's journey. 

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:33.132
 The scout leader allowed me to carry the American flag. 

00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:36.636
 While I was walking like the only black scout on this show, 

00:02:36.636 --> 00:02:39.733
 With Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, Boy Scouts and Cakes - 

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:42.719
 I think the 4-H club was there and some other organization - 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.822
 While I was walking on the street, 

00:02:45.422 --> 00:02:47.469
 Somewhere along the width road, 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:49.463
 I started getting beaten up 

00:02:49.463 --> 00:02:54.590
 With bottles, soda cans, rocks, and debris from the street 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.966
 By a small group of white onlookers mixed with the entire white crowd 

00:03:00.966 --> 00:03:02.554
 on the sidewalk. 

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:06.748
 It was the first time that I had experienced anything of the sort, 

00:03:06.748 --> 00:03:08.492
 And I did not understand. 

00:03:08.492 --> 00:03:12.437
 I thought maybe these people didn't like the scouts. 

00:03:12.437 --> 00:03:15.355
 I didn't realize that I was the only one who was beaten up 

00:03:15.355 --> 00:03:18.846
 Until the scout leader and the other scout leader came quickly 

00:03:18.846 --> 00:03:20.800
 They congregated above me with their bodies 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.002
 And accompanied me out of danger. 

00:03:23.622 --> 00:03:26.432
 They never explained why, although I kept asking, 

00:03:26.432 --> 00:03:29.006
 "Why are they hitting me? Why are they hitting me?" 

00:03:29.006 --> 00:03:31.580
 What did I do wrong? 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.814
 When I got home, 

00:03:33.814 --> 00:03:36.643
 My mom and dad, who were not at the rally, 

00:03:36.643 --> 00:03:39.815
 They were treating my <i>wounds with</i> Mercerchrome for <i>wounds and</i> dressings, and they asked me, 

00:03:39.815 --> 00:03:42.246
 "How did you get down and get all these scratches?" 

00:03:42.246 --> 00:03:43.869
 I told them, "I didn't drop." 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:46.921
 I told them exactly what happened. 

00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:49.397
 For the first time in my life, 

00:03:49.397 --> 00:03:52.046
 My parents sat me at the age of ten, 

00:03:52.046 --> 00:03:54.474
 They explained racism to me. 

00:03:54.474 --> 00:03:57.763
 I had absolutely no idea what they were talking about. 

00:03:57.763 --> 00:04:00.425
 It was inconceivable to me 

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:02.741
 That someone had never seen me, 

00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:04.044
 He never spoke to me, 

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:08.342
 He knew nothing about me at all 

00:04:08.342 --> 00:04:10.759
 He wants to cause me pain for a reason other than this: 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:12.340
 My skin color. 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.780
 So I could not believe my father. 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.980
 But more and more accidents are starting to happen, 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.934
 And I realized that my parents had told me the truth. 

00:04:20.934 --> 00:04:23.512
 I didn't know why people felt that way, 

00:04:23.512 --> 00:04:26.075
 But I realized there were some people who did that. 

00:04:26.075 --> 00:04:30.121
 So at the age of ten, I formed a question on my mind. 

00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:31.402
 That was the question 

00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:36.284
 "How can you hate me when you don't even know me?" 

00:04:37.174 --> 00:04:38.575
 So it arose, 

00:04:38.575 --> 00:04:40.226
 In my teenage years, 

00:04:40.226 --> 00:04:45.248
 Spending a lot of time buying books on black sovereignty, white sovereignty, 

00:04:45.248 --> 00:04:48.129
 The Nazis in Germany, the neo-Nazis here, 

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:50.514
 The Ku Klux Klan, anti-semitism - 

00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:53.555
 Trying to understand that ideology, 

00:04:53.555 --> 00:04:55.710
 Trying to get an answer to my question: 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.790
 "How can you hate me when you don't even know me?" 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.456
 None of these books provided the answer. 

00:05:01.456 --> 00:05:04.336
 So then, in my adult life, 

00:05:04.336 --> 00:05:05.996
 I thought, you know what? 

00:05:05.996 --> 00:05:08.652
 It is better than asking 

00:05:08.652 --> 00:05:11.468
 "How can you hate me when you don't even know me?" 

00:05:11.468 --> 00:05:15.605
 From someone who will join an organization 

00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:22.247
 Whose historical hypothesis hates those who do not look the same 

00:05:22.247 --> 00:05:24.728
 And those who do not believe in what they believe in. 

00:05:24.983 --> 00:05:28.534
 So I had my secretary arranging my band and all that stuff - 

00:05:28.534 --> 00:05:31.056
 I said, "Listen, I want you to have an appointment with this guy. 

00:05:31.056 --> 00:05:32.878
 His name is Roger Kelly. " 

00:05:32.878 --> 00:05:35.174
 You got Mr. Kelly's phone number. 

00:05:35.174 --> 00:05:39.660
 Mr. Kelly is known as the Imperial Magician (governor's position in the organization). 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.411
 Bob White was a huge dragon, meaning the <i>leader of the organization</i> . 

00:05:42.411 --> 00:05:46.187
 The Imperial Magician is the national leader of the Ku Klux Klan. 

00:05:46.187 --> 00:05:48.801
 I was told, "Don't bluff with Mr. Kelly, Daryl. 

00:05:48.801 --> 00:05:50.226
 He will kill you. " 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.170
 But I had to get an answer to my question, 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.242
 And I wish it was not the final answer if I met him. 

00:05:56.252 --> 00:05:59.589
 So Mary was given his phone number and said, 

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:01.189
 Call him. 

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:03.542
 Do not tell him that I am black. 

00:06:04.002 --> 00:06:08.232
 But see if he's sitting and giving your boss an interview - 

00:06:08.232 --> 00:06:10.916
 He wants to discuss the Ku Klux Klan. " 

00:06:10.915 --> 00:06:11.916
 So I did. 

00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:13.671
 Mr. Kelly agreed. 

00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:16.502
 So we booked a hotel room. 

00:06:16.502 --> 00:06:18.645
 Mary and I got there early. 

00:06:18.645 --> 00:06:22.757
 In time, up to the moment, there were knocking on the door. 

00:06:22.757 --> 00:06:25.421
 Mary jumps and runs around the corner, opening the door. 

00:06:25.421 --> 00:06:29.744
 Mr. Kelly walks and his bodyguard. 

00:06:29.744 --> 00:06:33.014
 The bodyguard was armed with a side weapon here on his thighs. 

00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:35.452
 When they saw me, they kinda froze 

00:06:35.452 --> 00:06:37.722
 Because they were expecting a white man. 

00:06:37.722 --> 00:06:40.748
 I stood up and went like this to prove that there is nothing in my hands, 

00:06:40.748 --> 00:06:41.745
 I got close. 

00:06:41.745 --> 00:06:43.752
 So I said, "Hey, Mr. Kelly, I'm Daryl Davis." 

00:06:43.752 --> 00:06:46.064
 I shook my hand, the bodyguard shook my hand. 

00:06:46.064 --> 00:06:48.410
 And I said, "Go ahead, sit down, sit down." 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.616
 Mr. Kelly sat down, 

00:06:50.616 --> 00:06:53.572
 The bodyguard stood carefully to his right. 

00:06:53.572 --> 00:06:56.070
 And we talked - 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:58.906
 They agree on some things, different on other things. 

00:06:58.906 --> 00:07:00.700
 But he told me - 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.402
 He told me that I was not equal. 

00:07:05.132 --> 00:07:07.839
 You are below standard. He was superior. 

00:07:07.839 --> 00:07:13.315
 This was justified and determined by the color of my skin. 

00:07:13.315 --> 00:07:14.649
 I was not there to fight it. 

00:07:14.649 --> 00:07:18.626
 I was there to learn from him: Where does this ideology come from? 

00:07:18.626 --> 00:07:21.266
 Because once you learn where it comes from, 

00:07:21.266 --> 00:07:23.973
 You can then try to figure out how to fix it 

00:07:23.973 --> 00:07:25.696
 And see where you go. 

00:07:25.696 --> 00:07:27.378
 So we kept talking. 

00:07:27.378 --> 00:07:31.770
 Maybe more than an hour in this interview, 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.244
 There is some kind of strange noise in the room, kind like (unknown sound), 

00:07:35.244 --> 00:07:36.744
 We all jumped. 

00:07:36.744 --> 00:07:38.462
 And I popped out my seat. 

00:07:38.462 --> 00:07:40.418
 There was a table between us, 

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:42.622
 I was ready to reach that table 

00:07:42.622 --> 00:07:45.777
 And topple Mr. Kelly and the bodyguard 

00:07:45.777 --> 00:07:50.143
 Because I knew that Mr. Kelly had made this noise. 

00:07:50.143 --> 00:07:52.974
 I didn't know what that noise was; I couldn't distinguish it. 

00:07:52.974 --> 00:07:56.252
 I kept hearing the voice of the person who gave me his number saying: 

00:07:56.252 --> 00:07:59.470
 Daryl, don't fool with Roger Kelly - he will kill you. " 

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.283
 I didn't want to die that day, 

00:08:01.283 --> 00:08:03.689
 But I knew it had made a noise, and I was thinking, 

00:08:03.689 --> 00:08:05.592
 "What did I just do, what did I just say 

00:08:05.592 --> 00:08:07.953
 To make him make some kind of strange noises? " 

00:08:07.953 --> 00:08:11.085
 As you know, I have entered into what you call the survival mode. 

00:08:11.085 --> 00:08:14.080
 In survival mode, people will do one of three things. 

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.247
 Some people, when you fear for your life - 

00:08:16.247 --> 00:08:18.582
 Some people will be nervous and start to vibrate. 

00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:22.198
 You can take a hammer or a racket and hit them on the head, 

00:08:22.198 --> 00:08:25.795
 And they wouldn't fight back - just mm mm mm like this. 

00:08:25.795 --> 00:08:30.966
 This is called paralysis with fear, and it is real. 

00:08:30.966 --> 00:08:32.440
 The second thing that people will do 

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.310
 Is that they will try to escape as quickly as possible 

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.849
 To put a distance between the source of fear and themselves. 

00:08:40.849 --> 00:08:44.430
 This is the best option if you can do that. 

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:47.232
 However, it was not an option for me, 

00:08:47.232 --> 00:08:51.137
 Because you can't get past a bullet in a hotel room. 

00:08:51.137 --> 00:08:53.600
 I was not armed, nor was my secretary. 

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.741
 The only person I know for sure was armed - the bodyguard. 

00:08:56.741 --> 00:08:58.461
 You can see his weapon here. 

00:08:58.461 --> 00:09:01.648
 I didn't know whether Mr. Kelly was carrying a weapon under his jacket or not. 

00:09:01.648 --> 00:09:04.194
 He was wearing a dark blue suit and tie. 

00:09:04.684 --> 00:09:10.859
 The third option is to take a preemptive strike to reduce the risk. 

00:09:10.859 --> 00:09:13.324
 In other words, get them before they get it from you. 

00:09:13.324 --> 00:09:15.137
 So I was about to do it. 

00:09:15.137 --> 00:09:19.651
 When I got out of my seat, I was looking directly at Mr. Kelly's eyes. 

00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:23.391
 I didn't say a word, but my eyes were speaking loudly and clearly. 

00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:27.560
 In fact, my eyes were screaming very loudly, he could hear my eyes. 

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.254
 My eyes were telling him, 

00:09:29.254 --> 00:09:31.646
 "What did you just do?" 

00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:34.653
 Well, Mr. Kelly's eyes had focused on my eyes, 

00:09:34.653 --> 00:09:38.450
 His eyes were silently asking me the same question 

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.628
 While the hand of the bodyguard was on his pistol, 

00:09:40.628 --> 00:09:43.451
 Looking back and forward between me and the Commander of the Klan, like, 

00:09:43.451 --> 00:09:46.015
 "What did you all do just now?" 

00:09:46.015 --> 00:09:49.288
 Well, Mary - I realized what happened. 

00:09:49.768 --> 00:09:54.417
 I filled the ice bucket in the hotel room with snow 

00:09:54.417 --> 00:09:57.250
 And put some soda cans in it to make it cool 

00:09:57.250 --> 00:10:00.904
 To be hospitable and offer Mr. Kelly a drink. 

00:10:00.904 --> 00:10:02.965
 The ice melted 

00:10:02.965 --> 00:10:05.785
 And I went out cascading under the ice, 

00:10:05.785 --> 00:10:07.603
 Then it made the same noise. 

00:10:07.603 --> 00:10:13.547
 We all started laughing at how ignorant we were. 

00:10:13.547 --> 00:10:17.337
 Now, I will not say that this was a moment of learning, 

00:10:17.337 --> 00:10:19.817
 But it was definitely a teaching moment. 

00:10:19.817 --> 00:10:21.568
 And what was taught was this: 

00:10:21.568 --> 00:10:24.150
 All because some "foreigners" - 

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:27.235
 Underline, highlight, and circle the word "foreign" - 

00:10:27.235 --> 00:10:29.787
 The entity that we were ignorant of- 

00:10:29.787 --> 00:10:31.862
 Being a bucket of ice and soda can- 

00:10:31.862 --> 00:10:37.288
 I entered the small comfort zone of Dunya through the noise that it made, 

00:10:37.288 --> 00:10:41.591
 We are all afraid and accusations of each other. 

00:10:41.591 --> 00:10:45.602
 Thus ignorance breeds fear. 

00:10:46.252 --> 00:10:49.139
 We fear those things we do not understand. 

00:10:49.139 --> 00:10:52.592
 If we don't put this fear under control, 

00:10:52.592 --> 00:10:55.968
 This fear, in turn, will generate hatred 

00:10:55.968 --> 00:10:59.087
 Because we hate those things that scare us. 

00:10:59.087 --> 00:11:00.871
 If we don't put this hate under control, 

00:11:00.871 --> 00:11:05.717
 This hatred, in turn, will wreak havoc. 

00:11:05.717 --> 00:11:08.949
 We want to destroy those things we hate. 

00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:11.395
 Why? Because they make us fear. 

00:11:11.395 --> 00:11:12.516
 But guess what? 

00:11:12.516 --> 00:11:15.807
 Perhaps it was harmless, and we were just ignorant. 

00:11:15.807 --> 00:11:20.099
 We saw almost the entire chain unfold until its completion 

00:11:20.099 --> 00:11:24.035
 The bodyguard pulled his gun and shot me and my secretary 

00:11:24.035 --> 00:11:27.782
 Because his job is to protect his boss and protect himself 

00:11:27.782 --> 00:11:32.714
 Or, I attacked and wounded one of them, trying to protect myself or my secretary. 

00:11:32.714 --> 00:11:34.574
 We have seen - 

00:11:34.574 --> 00:11:38.633
 We saw the entire series unfold until its completion 

00:11:38.884 --> 00:11:44.881
 Three months ago in Charlottesville, Virginia, two hours from my place of residence. 

00:11:44.881 --> 00:11:46.934
 Because ignorance was present. 

00:11:46.934 --> 00:11:48.541
 Fear was present, 

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:50.291
 Hatred was present, 

00:11:50.291 --> 00:11:52.691
 The destruction occurred 

00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:57.354
 When a white superior got in his car and tried to crush people 

00:11:57.354 --> 00:12:01.650
 As a result, a young woman named Heather Haier was killed. 

00:12:01.650 --> 00:12:05.169
 So we followed this interview. 

00:12:05.169 --> 00:12:06.957
 No more accidents. 

00:12:07.937 --> 00:12:10.762
 I will invite Mr. Kelly to my home. 

00:12:10.762 --> 00:12:11.958
 He will come to my home. 

00:12:11.958 --> 00:12:13.408
 His bodyguard will attend, 

00:12:13.408 --> 00:12:15.264
 Who would like to sit on the sofa next to him. 

00:12:15.264 --> 00:12:17.168
 Sometimes a bodyguard feels bored, 

00:12:17.168 --> 00:12:19.368
 He pulls his revolver, and turns it that way 

00:12:19.368 --> 00:12:21.427
 While Mr. Kelly and I spoke. 

00:12:21.427 --> 00:12:23.567
 I will invite some of my other friends - 

00:12:23.567 --> 00:12:26.965
 My Jewish friends, my black friends, my white friends, other people - 

00:12:26.965 --> 00:12:30.510
 Just to engage in a conversation with Mr. Kelly. 

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:33.340
 Others, I wanted him to test different people. 

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:34.866
 This continued for a few years. 

00:12:34.866 --> 00:12:36.756
 They didn't invite me to his house, 

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:41.546
 But he would have had dinner or lunch at my table, with me - 

00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:46.040
 This inferior person I consider unequal to him. 

00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.563
 A few years later, 

00:12:47.563 --> 00:12:51.182
 He started coming home to himself - 

00:12:51.182 --> 00:12:54.152
 A national leader in the Ku Klux Klan. 

00:12:54.152 --> 00:12:56.685
 Then he started calling me to his house. 

00:12:56.685 --> 00:12:58.720
 I will see the clan den, 

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.566
 I will take pictures and take notes for my own knowledge and things. 

00:13:03.566 --> 00:13:06.828
 Then he started inviting me to the Klan meetings. 

00:13:06.828 --> 00:13:11.608
 I'm going to these Klan meetings that have a wooden cross 20 or 30 feet - 

00:13:11.608 --> 00:13:15.205
 Two beams tied together, wrapped in burlap. 

00:13:15.205 --> 00:13:19.119
 The burlap was covered in what they call the "Klan cologne". 

00:13:19.119 --> 00:13:21.863
 Known as diesel or kerosene. 

00:13:21.863 --> 00:13:26.181
 And the men of the clans and the women of the clans are in their gowns, covers and flares 

00:13:26.181 --> 00:13:29.672
 Show off in a circle around the cross, 

00:13:29.672 --> 00:13:32.008
 The great dragon or imperial magician would say, 

00:13:32.008 --> 00:13:33.276
 Clan men, stop! 

00:13:33.276 --> 00:13:34.422
 And they all stop. 

00:13:34.422 --> 00:13:36.847
 Then he says: "To God!" They say "to God!" 

00:13:36.847 --> 00:13:38.639
 "For race!" "For race!" 

00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:40.615
 "For the motherland!" "For the motherland!" 

00:13:40.615 --> 00:13:42.532
 Clan men, come close to the cross! 

00:13:42.532 --> 00:13:45.446
 They are all close to the base of the cross. 

00:13:45.446 --> 00:13:47.320
 Clan men, light the cross! 

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.758
 They throw their torch at the feet and move suddenly! 

00:13:50.758 --> 00:13:53.160
 This great cross will be burning. 

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.246
 Here you go - here you are gathered in a meeting with the clan men. 

00:13:57.936 --> 00:14:01.016
 That's a conversation with a Klan <i>member</i> of a meeting. 

00:14:01.016 --> 00:14:03.527
 Here you are gathered with the burning cross. 

00:14:03.527 --> 00:14:06.374
 Now, they will give speeches. 

00:14:06.374 --> 00:14:10.509
 I would like to take more notes and try to accommodate them and try to understand them - 

00:14:10.509 --> 00:14:13.403
 Not because I believe in what they preach, 

00:14:13.403 --> 00:14:18.405
 But I try to learn and understand what is the motive behind it. 

00:14:18.405 --> 00:14:21.892
 So after a while, 

00:14:21.892 --> 00:14:26.970
 CNN heard of this thing and wanted to write a story about me. 

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.260
 Introduce me as a musician. 

00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:30.361
 Know who Mr. Kelly was as the Klan leader. 

00:14:30.361 --> 00:14:33.261
 So they followed me to a meeting. 

00:14:33.261 --> 00:14:36.769
 First, they came to my celebration on Friday night to show what I'm really doing. 

00:14:36.769 --> 00:14:37.852
 Then on Saturday morning, 

00:14:37.852 --> 00:14:41.074
 They followed me to the Clan gathering two hours from my house. 

00:14:41.074 --> 00:14:42.076
 And they told me, 

00:14:42.076 --> 00:14:44.561
 "Do you think Mr. Kelly will even speak to us?" 

00:14:44.561 --> 00:14:46.750
 I said, "I will do better. 

00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:48.388
 When this gathering ends, 

00:14:48.388 --> 00:14:51.402
 I will make Mr. Kelly, the imperial wizard of Klan 

00:14:51.402 --> 00:14:52.405
 Comes to my house, 

00:14:52.405 --> 00:14:55.711
 You can meet the clan leader inside the house of a black man. " 

00:14:55.711 --> 00:14:57.360
 They said, "Oh well." 

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.830
 (Laughter) 

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.326
 So they filmed the gathering. 

00:15:00.326 --> 00:15:01.960
 And when the gathering ended, 

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.616
 I talked to Roger Kelly, and I told him what happened, 

00:15:04.616 --> 00:15:05.621
 He agreed. 

00:15:05.621 --> 00:15:09.733
 He drove without his bodyguards, taking two hours on his way, 

00:15:09.733 --> 00:15:13.341
 He sat in my cellar and gave a CNN interview 

00:15:13.341 --> 00:15:18.286
 This clip was shown every hour for 24 hours worldwide. 

00:15:18.286 --> 00:15:19.823
 I'm going to show you now, 

00:15:19.823 --> 00:15:23.902
 And I want you to pay special attention to what Mr. Kelly says. 

00:15:23.902 --> 00:15:28.648
 He says that although he and I do different things together, 

00:15:28.648 --> 00:15:32.169
 However, those things did not change his views on the clan, 

00:15:32.169 --> 00:15:36.865
 Because his opinions on the clan had been entrenched in his mind for years. 

00:15:36.865 --> 00:15:40.815
 Then he continued to say how he believes in separating the races 

00:15:40.815 --> 00:15:44.887
 Because he thinks that this serves the interests of all races. 

00:15:44.887 --> 00:15:49.492
 But listen to what he says about respect, at the end of the passage. 

00:15:49.492 --> 00:15:50.634
 Please show the clip. 

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:53.631
 (Video) Carl Rochelle: Davis is one of the few African Americans 

00:15:53.631 --> 00:15:56.113
 You will never find you attending the Ku Klux Klan meeting. 

00:15:56.113 --> 00:15:58.382
 More than just attending, it's welcome. 

00:15:58.382 --> 00:16:00.865
 Roger Kelly: I have more respect for this black guy 

00:16:00.865 --> 00:16:02.671
 More than I have white niggers outside. 

00:16:02.671 --> 00:16:04.211
 (screaming) 

00:16:04.211 --> 00:16:06.071
 KR: It was a difficult day for the clan. 

00:16:06.071 --> 00:16:07.029
 They gathered in Maryland 

00:16:07.029 --> 00:16:10.983
 I found many locals reject the message of white separation. 

00:16:10.983 --> 00:16:13.871
 After it's over, Daryl Davis is hanging around behind the scenes 

00:16:13.871 --> 00:16:16.766
 With his friend, Clan magician Roger Kelly. 

00:16:20.566 --> 00:16:24.064
 It is not uncommon for blacks and whites to be friends, 

00:16:24.064 --> 00:16:25.061
 But it is not uncommon 

00:16:25.061 --> 00:16:29.128
 Find a black man and a Klan leader who nicely drink orange soda drinkers 

00:16:29.128 --> 00:16:31.065
 After the Klan gathered. 

00:16:31.065 --> 00:16:34.084
 The relationship started with a book Davis was writing. 

00:16:34.084 --> 00:16:36.956
 His secretary coordinated an interview with Roger Kelly 

00:16:36.956 --> 00:16:39.092
 But she didn't tell him that Davis was black. 

00:16:39.092 --> 00:16:41.174
 Talk and talk more - 

00:16:41.174 --> 00:16:44.468
 Davis learned about the clan, Kelly learned about Davis. 

00:16:44.468 --> 00:16:47.227
 RK: We get to know each other and do different things. 

00:16:47.227 --> 00:16:49.189
 It did not change my views on the clan 

00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:50.529
 Because my views on the clan 

00:16:50.529 --> 00:16:53.182
 It has been deeply ingrained in my mind for years. 

00:16:53.182 --> 00:16:56.548
 KR: Kelly and his Klan friends go to listen to Davis and his band. 

00:16:56.548 --> 00:17:02.125
 (Music) 

00:17:02.305 --> 00:17:04.198
 And Davis goes to their gatherings. 

00:17:04.198 --> 00:17:06.284
 Daryl Davis: I sat in the front row, 

00:17:06.284 --> 00:17:09.590
 And I heard all of the clan men talking. 

00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:12.131
 Some things are agreed upon; Other things I did not do. 

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:15.853
 KR: Davis believes his presence enhances much-needed understanding. 

00:17:15.853 --> 00:17:18.516
 DD: I think hate comes from fear - 

00:17:19.096 --> 00:17:20.542
 Fear of the unknown. 

00:17:20.542 --> 00:17:22.777
 And I think that is all, 

00:17:22.777 --> 00:17:25.344
 Regardless of whether it was a Klan man or something else. 

00:17:25.344 --> 00:17:27.532
 KR: But he has no illusions about the Clan. 

00:17:27.532 --> 00:17:30.419
 If he does, his friend will hurry to free him from illusion. 

00:17:30.419 --> 00:17:32.372
 RK: I believe in separating races. 

00:17:32.372 --> 00:17:34.445
 This is in the interest of all races. 

00:17:34.445 --> 00:17:35.557
 KR: Is it really? 

00:17:35.557 --> 00:17:38.488
 Or that friendship overcame the color barrier? 

00:17:38.488 --> 00:17:40.793
 Listen to Kelly at the Clan meeting. 

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:42.703
 RK: I will follow that man to hell and come back 

00:17:42.703 --> 00:17:46.274
 Because I believe in what he represents and he believes in what I represent. 

00:17:46.274 --> 00:17:47.750
 We do not agree at all, 

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.420
 But at least he respects me to sit down and listen to me, 

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.760
 I respect him for sitting and listening to him, 

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.760
 (screaming) 

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.041
 KR: The strange relationship of KKK and his black friend. 

00:17:58.041 --> 00:18:00.283
 In Washington, I am Carl Rochelle. 

00:18:00.283 --> 00:18:01.726
 CNN, on Sunday morning. 

00:18:01.726 --> 00:18:04.094
 (On stage) Respect is the key. 

00:18:04.094 --> 00:18:06.567
 Sitting and speaking - not necessarily okay - 

00:18:06.567 --> 00:18:09.648
 But respect each other to express their views. 

00:18:09.648 --> 00:18:12.751
 Because of this respect and my desire to listen 

00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:14.786
 And his desire to listen to me, 

00:18:14.786 --> 00:18:16.791
 He ended up leaving the clan, 

00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:19.162
 And here is his robe represented there. 

00:18:19.162 --> 00:18:20.297
 I am a musician, 

00:18:20.297 --> 00:18:22.849
 Not a psychologist or a sociologist. 

00:18:22.849 --> 00:18:26.405
 If you can do that, then anyone here can do it. 

00:18:26.405 --> 00:18:30.400
 Take your time to sit down and talk to your opponents. 

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:32.729
 You will learn something; They will learn something. 

00:18:32.729 --> 00:18:35.964
 When two enemies talk, they don't fight - they talk. 

00:18:35.964 --> 00:18:37.471
 When the conversation stops 

00:18:37.471 --> 00:18:39.569
 The ground becomes fertile for violence. 

00:18:39.569 --> 00:18:41.115
 So keep talking. 

00:18:41.115 --> 00:18:42.382
 thank you very much all. 

00:18:42.382 --> 00:18:44.250
