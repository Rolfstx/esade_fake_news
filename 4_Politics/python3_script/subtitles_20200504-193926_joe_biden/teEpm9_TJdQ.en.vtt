00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.233
The President:
All right, Joe, let's talk

00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:04.867
about cost because -- and now we're not talking about cost

00:00:04.867 --> 00:00:07.266
to families but we're talking about deficit, how much

00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:10.533
respective ideas cost. I think this is a good place

00:00:10.533 --> 00:00:12.700
to talk about Medicare as well because it's been brought

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.433
up several times.
Joe, go ahead.

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:17.467
The Vice President:
Mr. President, I'll try to be

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:19.600
brief. There's a lot to talk about. I'd like to focus it

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.633
though on the deficit, impact on the deficit

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:25.934
which we're all talking about.

00:00:25.934 --> 00:00:29.066
And I must tell you, maybe I've been arount too long, but

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.033
I am always reluctant,

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:34.100
after being here 37 years, to tell people

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.133
what the American people think.

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:40.033
I think it requires a little bit
of humility to be able to know

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:41.900
what the American people think.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.567
But -- and I don't, I can't
swear I do.

00:00:45.567 --> 00:00:47.900
I know what I think, I think I
know what they think, but I'm

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.367
not sure what they think.

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:54.233
And the second point I'd make
is, this probably has an echo --

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:57.767
this is slightly off point, but
this debate about the

00:00:57.767 --> 00:01:00.900
philosophic differences echo the
debate that probably took place

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.066
in the mid-'30s on Social
Security -- it was mandated.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.066
And it was mandated because
everybody knew you couldn't get

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.767
insurance unless everybody was
in the pool.

00:01:10.767 --> 00:01:13.066
And they knew if only some
people were in the pool, what

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.033
would happen is a lot of people
when they got old we would take

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.400
care of them anyway and you'd
have to pay for them.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.166
So it's kind of a -- it's not
the same thing, I'm not making

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:41.967
the exact, but it's the same
philosophic debate that took
00:01:41.967,00:01:26.934
place back in the '30s.

00:01:26.934 --> 00:01:31.600
But, look, I think, if I can lay
out, Mr. President, what I think

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.033
we all agree on, and then figure
out whether as a way to deal

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:38.100
with the deficit end of this --
bending the cost curve, to use a

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.867
phrase you and many others have
used, Mr. President.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:43.567
First of all, everybody agrees
we have the finest docs and the

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:46.533
finest hospitals and the finest
nurses in the world, and we

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:49.367
don't have quite enough of them
but we have the finest.

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:52.533
Everybody also agrees, I got
from this morning but I think we

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:57.433
had before, that Senator Coburn
is right that we waste a heck of

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.633
a lot of money and that
somewhere around a third of all

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:05.867
the dollars we spend on Medicare
is -- goes for nothing useful.

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:11.667
The third thing it seems -- I
assume we can all agree on is

00:02:11.667 --> 00:02:15.700
that over the last decade costs
have doubled for health care in

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.767
America -- costs have doubled
for government-provided health

00:02:18.767 --> 00:02:21.166
care, but everybody's
health care.

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:26.300
And that that meant that right
now everybody knows that that

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.867
wrecks budgets, it wrecks state
budgets, it wrecks family

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:33.233
budgets, it wrecks federal
budgets.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:38.500
Every 35 cents of every dollar
spent on health care is spent by

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.934
the federal government or the
state governments for Medicare

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:45.300
and Medicaid -- 35 cents on the
dollar.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.500
That doesn't count veterans and
other things, just those two.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.100
And so -- and what's happened is
-- on the dollar, on every

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.734
health care dollar.

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:57.333
And so we're facing, all of us
around this table, Democrat and

00:02:57.333 --> 00:03:03.567
Republicans, are facing the fact
that there's $919 billion now

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:07.600
we're spending on Medicare and
the federal portion of Medicaid,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.734
and that if things -- I don't
see any firewall is going to

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:14.033
keep costs from doubling again,
we're going to be talking about

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:23.467
in the year 2019 we're going to
be spending $1.7 trillion

00:03:23.467 --> 00:03:26.667
if we don't do
something to bend that curve.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:31.000
And the fourth point I think we
can agree on is that whether you

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.433
agree how it was arrived at, CBO
has gone out and scored the

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:41.200
various plans as to whether or
not they'd bend the cost curve,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.033
and everybody is acting
in good faith.

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:46.300
John's plan, they've gone out
and points out over 20 years it

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.900
will -- and I don't know if
that's the Republican plan or

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.333
John -- I don't think there's
any one plan that is out there,

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:58.367
but John's plan cuts those costs
by $300 billion over 20 years,

00:03:58.367 --> 00:03:59.900
according to CBO.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.066
The Senate plan cuts it by over
a trillion dollars over 20

00:04:04.066 --> 00:04:07.033
years; $100 billion over 10.

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:11.533
Again, we can argue on the
margins, but the fact is it's

00:04:11.533 --> 00:04:14.467
not just CBO that said this --
you had the Business

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:19.200
Roundtable/Hewitt study that
shows that the Senate plan slows

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:25.500
growth by 15 to 20 percent and
that business costs per employee

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.233
by the year 2019 would be $3,000
less per employee.

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:35.967
Again, it may be wrong -- it may
be wrong-exact amount, it may be

00:04:35.967 --> 00:04:39.900
$3,800, it may be $2,200 -- but
it cuts costs.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:46.867
And so it seems to me that there
is -- and I might add, that in

00:04:46.867 --> 00:04:51.667
the process here, it wasn't part
of the -- specifically part of a

00:04:51.667 --> 00:04:57.133
long-term debt debate, but, you
know, as has been pointed out

00:04:57.133 --> 00:05:04.166
here, we're not cutting Medicare
benefits in this; we're trying

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:06.667
to eliminate the third of the
problem that's a waste.

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:10.667
And as Senator Enzi, who I have
an inordinate amount of respect

00:05:10.667 --> 00:05:13.166
for, points out, he said it'd be
nice if we put some of these

00:05:13.166 --> 00:05:16.734
savings back into Medicare.

00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:19.133
Well, the fact is we do.

00:05:19.133 --> 00:05:23.934
We closed the prescription drug
doughnut hole.

00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:28.400
We provide for preventative care
for seniors because they don't

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.300
have now without a co-pay.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.433
And we also -- it's everyone --
I think most every major study

00:05:36.433 --> 00:05:40.133
agrees that it's going to extend
the life of Medicare trust fund,

00:05:40.133 --> 00:05:46.033
and it changes -- these changes,
the actuarial group pointed out,

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:52.333
would save about $200 on a
premium per Medicare recipient

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:54.200
out there, the people who are
paying.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:01.066
So look -- and the source of how
we do this is getting rid of

00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:06.867
waste, making sure that we don't
overpay insurance companies

00:06:06.867 --> 00:06:11.200
for Medicare Advantage.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:14.867
I want to remind everybody about
Medicare Advantage, because some

00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:17.533
of us around here -- probably
all of us around this table were

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:19.133
here when it got put in.

00:06:19.133 --> 00:06:21.500
What was the rationale for
Medicare Advantage?

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.967
The rationale for Medicare
Advantage a decade ago was that

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:29.867
private insurers could provide
insurance -- better insurance --

00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:32.500
cheaper than the
government can do it.

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.000
They can do it better.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.233
And we said the reason why we're
going to pay them more than what

00:06:37.233 --> 00:06:40.934
they're going to give at the
front end is to incentivize them

00:06:40.934 --> 00:06:43.967
to get into business
of doing it.

00:06:43.967 --> 00:06:46.700
And so we paid them a $1.15

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.500
for every dollar's worth --
what we could have

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.000
bought for a dollar.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.800
We did that -- and it was a
rational thing to try -- we did

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.667
that because we wanted them to
get engaged in the business we

00:06:57.667 --> 00:07:01.066
thought government didn't do as
well as the private sector did.

00:07:01.066 --> 00:07:02.400
Well, here we are.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.934
We're overpaying insurance
companies about 15 cents on the

00:07:05.934 --> 00:07:10.633
buck that we could buy for a
dollar, and we call

00:07:10.633 --> 00:07:12.433
for eliminating that.

00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:17.734
And so the other point I'd make,
Mr. President, is that we're in

00:07:17.734 --> 00:07:23.667
a situation here where at the
end of the day nobody in this

00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:27.133
room -- I don't think anybody in
this room -- is going to say,

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:30.000
you know something, we are
really going to be reforming the

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.767
health care system without
affecting the effect on the

00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:38.100
long-term deficit.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.000
Unless we bend that cost curve,
we're in trouble.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.300
And Mr. President, we can argue,
which we will, about whether or

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.834
not the way you and I want to go
after dealing with the long-term

00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:52.100
debt, whether commissions make
sense, whether or not we're ever

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.834
going to deal with -- this is a
big entitlement,

00:07:55.834 --> 00:07:57.700
this is a big entitlement.

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.800
Medicare -- it exists.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.066
We've got to figure out how to
keep it from bankrupting the

00:08:04.066 --> 00:08:10.867
country without denying seniors
what they're entitled to in a

00:08:10.867 --> 00:08:15.066
nation like ours: decent health
care that provides

00:08:15.066 --> 00:08:15.967
for their needs.

00:08:15.967 --> 00:08:18.667
So I'd like us, Mr. President --
and I'm going to hush -- I'd

00:08:18.667 --> 00:08:22.767
like us to talk about, if we
can, specifically what

00:08:22.767 --> 00:08:24.000
we all agree on.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.700
What do we do about bending the
cost curve?

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.333
What's the best way to do it?

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:32.567
And I yield the floor.

00:08:32.567 --> 00:08:35.433
Representative Boehner:
Mr. President, Mr. Ryan is going

00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:39.600
to open this conversation on
behalf of us.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.300
Representative Ryan:
Look, we agree on the problem

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.233
here, and the problem is health inflation is driving us off

00:08:44.233 --> 00:08:45.767
of a fiscal cliff.

00:08:45.767 --> 00:08:48.934
Mr. President, you said health
care reform is budget reform.

00:08:48.934 --> 00:08:51.300
You're right.
We agree with that.

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.567
Medicare right now has a $38
trillion unfunded liability.

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:57.700
That's $38 trillion in empty
promises to my parents'

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.900
generation, our generation, our
kids' generation.

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.467
Medicaid is growing at 21
percent this year.

00:09:03.467 --> 00:09:05.500
It's suffocating state's
budgets.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.834
It's adding trillions in
obligations that we have no

00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:09.433
means to pay for it.

00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:12.233
Now, you're right to frame the
debate on cost

00:09:12.233 --> 00:09:13.734
and health inflation.

00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:17.367
And in September when you spoke
to us in the well of the House,

00:09:17.367 --> 00:09:20.000
you basically said -- and I
totally agree with this -- "I

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.500
will not sign a plan that adds
one dime to our deficits either

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.600
now or in the future. "

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:28.033
Since the Congressional Budget
Office can't score your bill

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:30.600
because it doesn't have
sufficient detail, but it tracks

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.667
very similar to the Senate bill,
I want to unpack the Senate

00:09:33.667 --> 00:09:35.900
score a little bit.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:39.500
And if you take a look at these
CBO analysis, analysis from your

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.533
chief actuary, I think it's very
revealing.

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:45.200
This bill does not control
costs.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:48.266
This bill does not reduce
deficits.

00:09:48.266 --> 00:09:51.367
Instead this bill adds a new
health care entitlement at a

00:09:51.367 --> 00:09:53.700
time when we have no idea
how to pay for the

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.867
entitlements we already have.

00:09:55.867 --> 00:09:58.233
And let me go through
why I say that.

00:09:58.233 --> 00:10:01.700
The Majority Leader said the
bill scores as reducing the

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.834
deficit $131 billion over the
next 10 years.

00:10:05.834 --> 00:10:07.133
First, a little bit about CBO.

00:10:07.133 --> 00:10:08.767
I work with them
every single day.

00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:11.400
Very good people, great
professionals,

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.133
they do their jobs well.

00:10:13.133 --> 00:10:16.533
But their job is to score what
is placed in front of them.

00:10:16.533 --> 00:10:19.400
And what has been placed in
front of them is a bill that is

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:21.900
full of gimmicks and smoke and
mirrors.

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:23.367
What do I mean when I say that--

00:10:23.367 --> 00:10:27.667
Well, first off, the bill has 10
years of tax increases, about

00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:31.367
half a trillion dollars, with 10
years of Medicare cuts, about

00:10:31.367 --> 00:10:35.367
half a trillion dollars, to pay
for six years of spending.

00:10:35.367 --> 00:10:38.567
Now, what's the true 10-year
cost of this bill in 10 years?

00:10:38.567 --> 00:10:40.533
That's $2. 3 trillion.

00:10:40.533 --> 00:10:42.400
It does a couple of other
things.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.533
It takes $52 billion in higher
Social Security tax revenues and

00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:50.000
counts them as offsets, but
that's really reserved

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.400
for Social Security.

00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.967
So either we're double-counting
them or we don't intend on

00:10:53.967 --> 00:10:55.967
paying those Social Security
benefits.

00:10:55.967 --> 00:11:00.233
It takes $72 billion and claims
money from the CLASS Act --

00:11:00.233 --> 00:11:02.467
that's the long-term care
insurance program.

00:11:02.467 --> 00:11:05.066
It takes the money from premiums
that are designed for that

00:11:05.066 --> 00:11:08.567
benefit and instead counts them
as offsets.

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.800
The Senate Budget Committee
chairman said that this is a

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.266
Ponzi scheme that would make
Bernie Madoff proud.

00:11:14.266 --> 00:11:18.333
Now, when you take a look at the
Medicare cuts, what this bill

00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:21.100
essentially does is treats
Medicare like a piggy bank.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:24.066
It raids a half a trillion
dollars out of Medicare not to

00:11:24.066 --> 00:11:27.100
shore up Medicare's solvency but
to spend on

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.467
this new government program.

00:11:28.467 --> 00:11:32.700
Now, when you take a look at
what this does, it is --

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.433
according to the chief actuary
of Medicare, he's saying as much

00:11:35.433 --> 00:11:38.000
of 20 percent of Medicare's
providers will either go out of

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.166
business or will have to stop
seeing Medicare beneficiaries.

00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:44.400
Millions of seniors who are on
-- who have chosen Medicare

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.767
Advantage will lose the coverage
that they now enjoy.

00:11:47.767 --> 00:11:51.500
You can't say that you're using
this money to either extend

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.600
Medicare solvency and also
offset the

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.100
cost of this new
program.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:56.800
That's double-counting.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.500
And so when you take a look at
all of this, when you strip out

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.633
the double-counting and what I
would call these gimmicks, the

00:12:02.633 --> 00:12:06.934
full 10-year cost of this bill
has a $460 billion deficit.

00:12:06.934 --> 00:12:08.967
The second 10-year
cost of this bill has

00:12:08.967 --> 00:12:11.700
a $1. 4 trillion deficit.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.500
And I think probably the most
cynical gimmick in this bill is

00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.667
something that we all probably
agree on.

00:12:16.667 --> 00:12:19.800
We don't think we should cut
doctors 21 percent next year.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.233
We've stopped those cuts from
occurring every year for the

00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:23.500
last seven years.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:26.266
We all call this here in
Washington the "doc fix.

00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:27.900
" Well, the doc fix, according

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.400
to your numbers cost $371 billion.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:33.000
It was in the first iteration of
all these bills.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.734
But because it was a big price
tag, and it made the score look

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:38.834
bad, made it look like a
deficit, that provision was

00:12:38.834 --> 00:12:42.700
taken out, and it's been going
on as stand-alone legislation.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.200
But ignoring these costs does
not remove them

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.600
from the backs
of taxpayers.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.533
Hiding spending does not reduce
spending.

00:12:50.533 --> 00:12:52.100
And so when you take a look at
all of this,

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:53.233
it just doesn't add up.

00:12:53.233 --> 00:12:56.000
And so let's just -- I'll finish
with the cost-curve.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.934
Are we bending the cost curve
down or are we

00:12:57.934 --> 00:12:59.567
bending the cost curve up?

00:12:59.567 --> 00:13:02.700
Well, if you look at your own
chief actuary at Medicare,

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.100
we're bending it up.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:08.133
He's claiming that we're going
up $222 billion -- adding more

00:13:08.133 --> 00:13:11.133
to the unsustainable fiscal
situation we have.

00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:14.934
And so when you take a look at
this, it's really deeper than

00:13:14.934 --> 00:13:17.834
the deficits or the budget

00:13:17.834 --> 00:13:19.567
gimmicks or the actuarial analysis.

00:13:19.567 --> 00:13:21.967
There really is a difference
between us.

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:23.867
And we've been talking about how
much we agree on different

00:13:23.867 --> 00:13:26.300
issues, but there really is a
difference between us.

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:29.266
And it's basically this: We
don't think the government

00:13:29.266 --> 00:13:31.266
should be in control of all of
this.

00:13:31.266 --> 00:13:33.467
We want people to be in control.

00:13:33.467 --> 00:13:36.166
And that, at the end of the day,
is the big difference.

00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:40.066
Now, we've offered lots of ideas
all last year, all this year,

00:13:40.066 --> 00:13:43.467
because we agree the status quo
is unsustainable.

00:13:43.467 --> 00:13:45.200
It's got to get fixed.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.500
It's bankrupting families.

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.033
It's bankrupting our government.

00:13:48.033 --> 00:13:50.266
It's hurting families with
preexisting conditions.

00:13:50.266 --> 00:13:52.133
We all want to fix this.

00:13:52.133 --> 00:13:55.433
But we don't think that this is
the answer to the solution.

00:13:55.433 --> 00:13:58.400
And all of the analysis we get
proves that point.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.166
Now, I will just simply say this
-- and I respectfully disagree

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:04.700
with the Vice President about
what the American people are or

00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.867
are not saying, or whether we're
qualified

00:14:06.867 --> 00:14:09.333
to speak on their behalf.

00:14:09.333 --> 00:14:12.433
So we are all representatives of
the American people.

00:14:12.433 --> 00:14:13.667
We all do town hall meetings.

00:14:13.667 --> 00:14:15.700
We all talk to our constituents.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.767
And I've got to tell you, the
American people are engaged.

00:14:18.767 --> 00:14:21.266
And if you think they want a
government takeover of health

00:14:21.266 --> 00:14:23.133
care, I would respectfully
submit you're

00:14:23.133 --> 00:14:24.767
not listening to them.

00:14:24.767 --> 00:14:28.767
So what we simply want to do is
start over, work on a clean

00:14:28.767 --> 00:14:32.166
sheet of paper, move through
these issues step by step, and

00:14:32.166 --> 00:14:36.467
fix them and bring down health
care costs and not raise them.

00:14:36.467 --> 00:14:39.133
and that basically the point.

00:14:39.133 --> 00:14:41.233
The President:
I'm going to call

00:14:41.233 --> 00:14:43.433
on Xavier Becerra, but I just

00:14:43.433 --> 00:14:46.033
want to follow up on a couple
points.

00:14:46.033 --> 00:14:47.600
There are some strong
disagreements on the numbers

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:54.467
here, Paul, but I don't want to
get too bogged down.

00:14:54.467 --> 00:15:00.867
First question I have is whether
your side thinks Medicare

00:15:00.867 --> 00:15:03.967
Advantage is working well,
because I think it's important

00:15:03.967 --> 00:15:08.500
just to point out that -- when
we keep on talking about cuts in

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.300
Medicare, what we're really
talking about is what Joe

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.900
alluded to, which is a decision
was made a while back to set up

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:25.200
a system in which Medicare
costs, let's say, a dollar under

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.900
the government program that 80
percent of people still use and

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.967
are perfectly satisfied with and
there's no showing that it's not

00:15:33.967 --> 00:15:35.967
working for them.

00:15:35.967 --> 00:15:39.266
We said we'd give it to private
insurers and we'd give them a

00:15:39.266 --> 00:15:42.033
bonus of a $1. 15

00:15:42.033 --> 00:15:45.133
for every dollar in the
normal plan.

00:15:45.133 --> 00:15:49.166
And it turns out that people
aren't healthier because of that

00:15:49.166 --> 00:15:52.900
extra $15 -- or 15 cents.

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:57.734
It's estimated that it's costing
us about $180 billion over 10

00:15:57.734 --> 00:16:02.166
years and, say, $18 billion a
year.

00:16:02.166 --> 00:16:05.300
And essentially what my proposal
would do, and what the House and

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:09.600
Senate proposals would do, would
say, instead of having the

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:14.867
insurance companies get that
money, let's take that money --

00:16:14.867 --> 00:16:21.100
the savings are between $400
billion and $500 billion a year

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.266
-- and let's devote some of that
money to closing the doughnut

00:16:24.266 --> 00:16:28.133
hole, which has already been
talked about.

00:16:28.133 --> 00:16:34.367
Seniors who need more
prescription drugs than Medicare

00:16:34.367 --> 00:16:37.400
currently is willing to pay for
hit this gap where suddenly

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:39.967
they've got to use it out of
pocket, and they just stop

00:16:39.967 --> 00:16:42.567
taking the drugs, or they break
them in half, or what have you.

00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:43.400
Let's fill that.

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:49.734
That costs around $30 billion a
year, or $300 billion.

00:16:49.734 --> 00:16:54.433
And let's make some other
changes that would result in

00:16:54.433 --> 00:16:58.233
actually the 80 percent of
seniors who aren't in Medicare

00:16:58.233 --> 00:17:00.433
Advantage getting a better deal.

00:17:00.433 --> 00:17:05.467
So we can address some of the
broader issues, but I just want

00:17:05.467 --> 00:17:09.400
to focus on Medicare Advantage
because I haven't seen an

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.500
independent analyst look at this
and say seniors are healthier

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.967
for it or taxpayers are better
off for it.

00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:17.200
That's what we're talking about
reforming.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:23.967
We're not talking about cutting
benefits under the Medicare

00:17:23.967 --> 00:17:28.066
program as is required under
law.

00:17:28.066 --> 00:17:30.700
What we're talking about is
Medicare Advantage.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:35.266
And it may be that some people
here think that it's working.

00:17:35.266 --> 00:17:37.066
I know that there are some
Republicans who are sitting at

00:17:37.066 --> 00:17:38.967
this table who don't think it's
working.

00:17:38.967 --> 00:17:44.600
You can argue and say, okay,
let's not do Medicare Advantage

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.667
and let's not close the doughnut
hole, for example, or there may

00:17:48.667 --> 00:17:50.633
be other ways you want to spend
that money.

00:17:50.633 --> 00:17:53.033
But I just want to establish
whether we've got some agreement

00:17:53.033 --> 00:17:56.300
that the Medicare Advantage
program, which is what we are

00:17:56.300 --> 00:18:01.734
proposing to reform, is actually
not a good deal for taxpayers or

00:18:01.734 --> 00:18:05.300
for seniors, and certainly not a
good deal for the 80 percent of

00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:08.400
seniors who aren't in Medicare
Advantage, because, by the way,

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.767
they're paying an extra premium
of about 90 bucks a year to

00:18:11.767 --> 00:18:15.266
subsidize the 20 percent who are
in Medicare Advantage.

00:18:15.266 --> 00:18:17.066
SENATOR McConnell:
Mr. President, John McCain also

00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:18.867
would like to address that
issue.

00:18:18.867 --> 00:18:20.166
THE PRESIDENT:
I'm sorry, so if

00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:21.934
somebody else wants to address

00:18:21.934 --> 00:18:24.734
SENATOR McCain:
I'd just make one comment.

00:18:24.734 --> 00:18:29.700
Why in the world then would we
carve out 800,000 people in

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:34.033
Florida that would not have
their Medicare Advantage cut?

00:18:34.033 --> 00:18:37.233
Now, I proposed an amendment on
the floor to say everybody will

00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:38.633
be treated the same.

00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:41.567
Mr. President, why should we
carve out 800,000 people because

00:18:41.567 --> 00:18:44.500
they live in Florida to keep the
Medicare Advantage program and

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:45.667
then want to do away with it?

00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:46.166
The President:
I think you make

00:18:46.166 --> 00:18:48.000
a legitimate point.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.433
Senator McCain:
Well, maybe --

00:18:49.433 --> 00:18:50.433
The President:
I thank you.

00:18:50.433 --> 00:18:51.500
Senator McCain:
Thank you very much.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:19:04.967
(Laughter. )

00:19:04.967 --> 00:19:06.066
The President:
I'm going to Xavier -- in

00:19:06.066 --> 00:19:07.934
fairness, I asked a

00:19:07.934 --> 00:19:11.800
question, so I'm going to let
one of the Republicans respond,

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.033
and then I'll go to Xavier.

00:19:15.033 --> 00:19:16.467
Senator Coburn:
You know, the assumption

00:19:16.467 --> 00:19:17.300
-- I think it's

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.500
important for the American
people to hear we have Medicare

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.934
Part D, except no senior
in this country ever

00:19:21.934 --> 00:19:24.367
paid a tax dollar for it.

00:19:24.367 --> 00:19:27.300
And we're talking about filling
a doughnut hole on a program

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.066
that they're already benefiting
from that's going to leave

00:19:30.066 --> 00:19:32.200
$11 trillion in debt for our
children.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.200
I'm not sure the seniors want us
to leave more debt for their

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.600
children to fill a doughnut
hole.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.633
And when we talk about filling
the doughnut hole by taking away

00:19:40.633 --> 00:19:43.767
from people who can't afford to
buy a supplemental policy,

00:19:43.767 --> 00:19:47.066
that's where Medicare Part A
helps poor people in Oklahoma,

00:19:47.066 --> 00:19:51.266
is they get to buy Medicare Part
C -- we never call it Part C,

00:19:51.266 --> 00:19:53.500
but that's what it is -- and
they don't have

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.367
to buy a
supplemental policy.

00:19:55.367 --> 00:19:58.834
So consequently, they get lots
of the benefits that other

00:19:58.834 --> 00:20:01.900
people who have better buying
power in Medicare

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.734
with a
supplemental policy.

00:20:03.734 --> 00:20:07.567
So it's a tradeoff of whether or
not we say, where are we going

00:20:07.567 --> 00:20:08.500
to give the benefits.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.900
What we really should be doing
is saying, we're broke, Medicare

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.633
is broke; we're working and
struggling

00:20:13.633 --> 00:20:15.467
together to try to get there.

00:20:15.467 --> 00:20:17.667
Let's not add new benefits
anywhere, and let's make sure

00:20:17.667 --> 00:20:21.133
the benefits that we have today
get applied more equitably.

00:20:21.133 --> 00:20:22.233
The President:
Well, I think

00:20:22.233 --> 00:20:23.734
that's a legitimate point.

00:20:23.734 --> 00:20:28.100
I would just point out that 80
percent of seniors are helping

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:31.433
to pay in extra premiums
for the 20 percent

00:20:31.433 --> 00:20:35.567
who are in this
Medicare Advantage.

00:20:35.567 --> 00:20:38.900
And it's not means-tested, so
it's not as if the people who

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.100
are in Medicare Advantage are
somehow the poor people who

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.300
can't afford supplementals.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.333
It's pretty random.

00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:47.667
And what we also know is, and I
just want to point this out,

00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:51.400
Tom, $180 billion of it is going
to insurance companies.

00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:53.400
It's not going to seniors.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:55.900
It's going to insurance
companies, including big

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.133
insurance company profits --
without any appreciable

00:21:00.133 --> 00:21:02.333
improvement in health care
benefits.

00:21:02.333 --> 00:21:04.800
That's not a good way for us to
spend money.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.700
I agree with you about the fact
that the prescription drug plan

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:12.600
added to our deficits, because
we didn't pay for it.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.300
And I just have to point out
that didn't

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:15.200
happen under my watch.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.166
That happened under
the previous Congress.

00:21:17.166 --> 00:21:21.100
There's some people -- John is
an example of somebody who was

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.834
true to his convictions and
didn't vote for it.

00:21:23.834 --> 00:21:25.400
Senator Coburn:
I didn't vote for it.

00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:26.767
The President:
But the fact of

00:21:26.767 --> 00:21:29.233
the matter is, is that
that was costly.

00:21:29.233 --> 00:21:30.333
And we do have to
deal with that.

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:33.834
On the other hand, that -- the
problem I don't think is, is

00:21:33.834 --> 00:21:36.033
that we gave seniors
prescription drug benefits.

00:21:36.033 --> 00:21:38.433
I think the problem is, is that
we didn't pay for it.

00:21:38.433 --> 00:21:40.533
And we should try to find a way
to pay for it.

00:21:40.533 --> 00:21:43.133
Taking some of that money out of
Medicare Advantage and putting

00:21:43.133 --> 00:21:46.400
it into that doughnut hole does
pay for it.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.233
I really breached protocol here,
but I thought that was important

00:21:50.233 --> 00:21:51.734
to just get clear.

00:21:51.734 --> 00:21:54.734
We are taking about Medicare
Advantage in terms of where

00:21:54.734 --> 00:21:58.433
these cuts come from, not
Medicare benefits through the

00:21:58.433 --> 00:22:01.834
traditional Medicare Plan. Xavier.

00:22:01.834 --> 00:22:05.033
Congressman Becerra:
Mr. President, thank you very

00:22:05.033 --> 00:22:06.233
much for bringing
us all together.

00:22:06.233 --> 00:22:08.266
And I do want to address
something that my friend, Paul

00:22:08.266 --> 00:22:10.600
Ryan said, because I almost
think that we can't have this

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.834
discussion any further without
addressing something Paul said.

00:22:13.834 --> 00:22:19.667
Paul, you called into question
the Congressional Budget Office.

00:22:19.667 --> 00:22:23.600
Now, we can all agree to
disagree, we could all have our

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:29.000
politics, but if there's no
referee on the field, we can

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.100
never agree how the game should
be played.

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:31.667
Congressman Ryan:
Let me clarify,

00:22:31.667 --> 00:22:32.467
just to be clear.

00:22:32.467 --> 00:22:33.967
Congressman Becerra:
No, no. Let me -- let me

00:22:33.967 --> 00:22:35.367
-- if I could
just finish.

00:22:35.367 --> 00:22:39.734
And so, I think we have to
decide do we believe in the

00:22:39.734 --> 00:22:44.200
Congressional Budget Office or
not, because Paul, you and I

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.300
have sat on the Budget Committee
for years together.

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:51.133
And you have, on any number of
occasions in those years, cited

00:22:51.133 --> 00:22:53.800
the Congressional Budget Office
to make your point, referred to

00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.533
the Congressional Budget
Office's projections

00:22:57.533 --> 00:22:58.867
to make your points.

00:22:58.867 --> 00:23:02.533
And today, you essentially said
you can't trust the

00:23:02.533 --> 00:23:03.767
Congressional Budget Office.

00:23:03.767 --> 00:23:05.100
Congressman Ryan:
No, that is not what I'm saying.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:05.800
Congressman Becerra:
Okay, well,

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:06.400
that was my interpretation.

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.233
Congressman Ryan:
No. Let me be clear.

00:23:07.233 --> 00:23:08.133
Congressman Becerra:
I apologize.

00:23:08.133 --> 00:23:09.033
I apologize if
I misinterpreted --

00:23:09.033 --> 00:23:10.100
Congressman Ryan:
I am not questioning

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:11.033
the quality of the scoring --

00:23:11.033 --> 00:23:11.734
Congressman Becerra:
Paul -- Paul, if I

00:23:11.734 --> 00:23:12.367
could just finish my --

00:23:12.367 --> 00:23:13.633
Congressman Ryan:
-- I'm questioning the

00:23:13.633 --> 00:23:17.033
Congressman Becerra:
I take your point on

00:23:17.033 --> 00:23:18.333
your clarification.
But if I --

00:23:18.333 --> 00:23:19.066
Congressman Ryan:
Let me just

00:23:19.066 --> 00:23:20.100
say it, 10 years of tax

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.800
increases, 10 years of
Medicare cuts to pay for

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.834
six years of spending --

00:23:23.834 --> 00:23:24.433
Congressman Becerra:
Paul, if I could just

00:23:24.433 --> 00:23:25.166
try to make my point.

00:23:25.166 --> 00:23:26.967
Congressman Ryan:
Okay.

00:23:26.967 --> 00:23:28.333
Congressman Becerra:
So then I'm assuming

00:23:28.333 --> 00:23:30.200
then that you do

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.133
believe that the CBO is a
legitimate agency to render

00:23:33.133 --> 00:23:36.000
decisions on spending for the
Congress.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.834
Congressman Ryan:
Xavier, you

00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:37.734
know I believe that.

00:23:37.734 --> 00:23:39.133
Congressman Becerra:
Okay, so then let's

00:23:39.133 --> 00:23:39.767
work with that.

00:23:39.767 --> 00:23:43.367
Because, quite honestly, if we
can't work with CBO numbers,

00:23:43.367 --> 00:23:45.033
we're lost; we're lost.

00:23:45.033 --> 00:23:47.233
Because then we really will get
into a food fight.

00:23:47.233 --> 00:23:55.033
And so, I apologize, Paul, if I
misinterpreted --

00:23:55.033 --> 00:23:55.600
Congressman Ryan:
Yes, look --

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:56.133
Congressman Becerra: -- what I
had heard, I appreciate that we

00:23:56.133 --> 00:23:57.667
left the referee on the field.

00:23:57.667 --> 00:23:58.100
Congressman Ryan:
I'll just simply say --

00:23:58.100 --> 00:23:59.333
Congressman Becerra:
And so if the referee

00:23:59.333 --> 00:24:00.233
is on the field,

00:24:00.233 --> 00:24:01.433
then we have to at least accept
what the referee has said.

00:24:01.433 --> 00:24:07.834
And the referee said that the
bills that are before us reduce

00:24:07.834 --> 00:24:11.667
the deficit, the federal
government's deficit, by over

00:24:11.667 --> 00:24:14.467
$100 billion in the first 10
years.

00:24:14.467 --> 00:24:17.600
The Congressional Budget Office,
the referee -- not political

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:22.767
parties; the referee -- said
that these bills reduce the

00:24:22.767 --> 00:24:26.767
deficit in the succeeding years,
after the first 10 years, by

00:24:26.767 --> 00:24:28.867
over a trillion dollars.

00:24:28.867 --> 00:24:30.467
Now, you're right.

00:24:30.467 --> 00:24:33.500
All the discussion makes it
clear it wasn't easy.

00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:35.533
There are going to be some
savings that we

00:24:35.533 --> 00:24:37.266
extract out of Medicare.

00:24:37.266 --> 00:24:41.033
What we do do in these bills is
try to make the point that as we

00:24:41.033 --> 00:24:44.300
reduce the deficit, we're not
going to put the onus, the

00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:49.533
burden of those cuts on seniors
who receive Medicare.

00:24:49.533 --> 00:24:52.066
We're asking the providers to
stop, as some of my colleagues

00:24:52.066 --> 00:24:57.467
in the Senate said,
over-utilizing or over-spending

00:24:57.467 --> 00:25:01.433
in services, so that we don't
see someone having four

00:25:01.433 --> 00:25:04.500
different X-rays for chest pain.

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.800
And so what we're trying to do
is figure out the ways to reduce

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.066
the costs without
impacting benefits.

00:25:10.066 --> 00:25:13.834
In fact, that's how in these two
bills that the Senate and House

00:25:13.834 --> 00:25:17.700
passed, we were actually able to
close the doughnut hole for

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.934
prescription drug coverage in
Medicare and still extract,

00:25:21.934 --> 00:25:25.100
according to the CBO, over
$100 billion in savings.

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.533
So, Mr. President, I would just
say the thing that I would love

00:25:28.533 --> 00:25:31.800
for us to get into the details
of, in terms of those deficit

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.867
reductions that are made is the
fact that we do it while putting

00:25:36.867 --> 00:25:40.033
the brakes on Medicare
overpayments that went to

00:25:40.033 --> 00:25:43.967
insurance companies, which were
getting reimbursed at greater

00:25:43.967 --> 00:25:48.033
levels than were doctors and
hospitals that relied on a

00:25:48.033 --> 00:25:50.834
traditional Medicare fee for
service, to provide

00:25:50.834 --> 00:25:52.467
services to our seniors.

00:25:52.467 --> 00:25:57.600
We have any number of provisions
that deal with the issue of

00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.333
fraud, which (inaudible) says at
least a total of $60 billion.

00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:03.867
And working with some of our
Republican colleagues, we are

00:26:03.867 --> 00:26:07.967
doing exactly that, going after
the waste that's in the system,

00:26:07.967 --> 00:26:09.734
certainly the fraud.

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:12.834
And that's how we extract the
number of the savings.

00:26:12.834 --> 00:26:17.500
And, finally, perhaps one of the
unsung secrets of what we

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:21.000
learned from listening to
doctors and hospitals and all

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.133
the different providers is that
we can actually do a far better

00:26:24.133 --> 00:26:27.133
job of coordinating care for
people.

00:26:27.133 --> 00:26:30.433
And if you make sure that
someone who walks in the door of

00:26:30.433 --> 00:26:33.233
any one of the great physicians
who are in this room when they

00:26:33.233 --> 00:26:36.533
were practicing and made sure
that we followed them through

00:26:36.533 --> 00:26:40.233
not just that first visit to the
primary care or family doctor,

00:26:40.233 --> 00:26:43.633
but then into the specialist and
then into the hospital and then

00:26:43.633 --> 00:26:47.033
afterwards to perhaps the
nursing home or the home health

00:26:47.033 --> 00:26:50.000
center, that what you do is if
you coordinate the care instead

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.133
of have each provider do just
its share and forget about the

00:26:53.133 --> 00:26:55.700
patient, if you coordinate the
care, you can actually

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:57.734
reduce costs dramatically.

00:26:57.734 --> 00:27:01.000
And that's how we were able to
reduce the costs for Medicare.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.400
That's how we were able to
extract, according to the

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.000
referee on the field, the
Congressional Budget Office,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
over $100 billion in deficit
reduction and over a trillion

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.066
dollars in deficit reduction in
the second 10 years.

00:27:13.066 --> 00:27:15.734
So I believe, Mr. President,
what we have is a chance to

00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:20.633
discuss how we can actually put
this country back on a good

00:27:20.633 --> 00:27:24.900
fiscal track and still do right
by our seniors in Medicare and

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.000
increase the amount of people
who get covered by health

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:33.734
insurance by about 31 million.

00:27:33.734 --> 00:27:34.934
Senator Grassley:
First of all,

00:27:34.934 --> 00:27:37.166
to clarify something, if anybody

00:27:37.166 --> 00:27:41.133
says that Medicare Advantage is
a subsidy going to insurance

00:27:41.133 --> 00:27:44.467
companies, let me say what the
statute says.

00:27:44.467 --> 00:27:50.300
The statute says that 75 -- with
a big differential where it goes

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:54.000
-- 75 percent goes to
beneficiaries and benefits and

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.133
25 percent to the federal
government.

00:28:00.133 --> 00:28:01.100
The President:
I'm sorry, Chuck,

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.333
I just want to make sure -- I

00:28:02.333 --> 00:28:04.433
don't think that's -- that
doesn't sound right to me

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:07.867
because that would mean 100
percent of it is going to either

00:28:07.867 --> 00:28:09.066
benefits or the federal
government, which means the

00:28:09.066 --> 00:28:10.800
insurance companies aren't
making any money there.

00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:12.667
Senator Grassley:
No, 75 percent

00:28:12.667 --> 00:28:14.633
to beneficiaries and benefits

00:28:14.633 --> 00:28:17.600
and 25 percent to the federal
government.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.934
We consider -- I consider CBO
"God" around here because it

00:28:22.934 --> 00:28:25.934
takes 60 votes in the Senate to
overrule them so I'm not

00:28:25.934 --> 00:28:32.834
questioning CBO, but in regard
to what Mr. Ryan said, I want to

00:28:32.834 --> 00:28:40.834
back it up with a quote from a
December 23rd letter from CBO

00:28:40.834 --> 00:28:42.967
about this double accounting:

00:28:42.967 --> 00:28:47.367
"The key point is that the
savings to the health insurance

00:28:47.367 --> 00:28:52.100
trust fund under" the bill
"would be received by the

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:57.100
government only once, so they
cannot be set aside to pay for

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:01.900
future Medicare spending and, at
the same time, pay for current

00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:05.133
spending on other parts of the
legislation."

00:29:05.133 --> 00:29:09.767
Then skip a couple sentences
and say: "To describe the full

00:29:09.767 --> 00:29:14.500
amount of the HI Trust Fund
savings as both" -- with

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:17.233
emphasis upon "both" --
"improving the government's

00:29:17.233 --> 00:29:22.200
ability to pay future Medicare
benefits and financing new

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:28.066
spending outside of Medicare
would essentially double-count a

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:31.767
large share of those savings and
thus overstate the improvement

00:29:31.767 --> 00:29:34.600
in the government's fiscal
position. "

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.633
Now, you can argue about the
exact amount of savings or

00:29:37.633 --> 00:29:41.734
whether there isn't any savings,
but you can't argue that you

00:29:41.734 --> 00:29:45.200
can't count a dollar twice --
you just can't argue that.

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.734
Common sense tells you that.

00:29:48.734 --> 00:29:51.800
You don't even have to have an
accountant tell you that.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.500
Now, I think what we want to
remember here is that there are

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:59.600
consequences to things we do.

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:02.233
You change tax policy and
there's consequences

00:30:02.233 --> 00:30:04.100
to tax policy.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:07.834
You decide you're going to save
money in certain areas --

00:30:07.834 --> 00:30:09.800
there's consequences to that.

00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:12.667
So we have big tax increases.

00:30:12.667 --> 00:30:16.367
I think that without a doubt
when you put tax on labor it's

00:30:16.367 --> 00:30:21.834
harmful and it doesn't do
anything to create employment.

00:30:21.834 --> 00:30:26.900
Both bills hit small business
with higher tax rates -- the

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:32.367
House bill by 33 percent; the
Senate bill by 20 percent.

00:30:32.367 --> 00:30:35.834
The House bill hits small
business harder, obviously; the

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:40.734
Senate bill hits the middle
class harder.

00:30:40.734 --> 00:30:45.834
It's a fact that when you do
these things, you hurt the

00:30:45.834 --> 00:30:51.333
economy because small business
is the machine that brings

00:30:51.333 --> 00:30:54.467
employment in America -- 70
percent of new employment.

00:30:54.467 --> 00:30:57.033
We've got to be careful of how
you treat small business.

00:30:57.033 --> 00:31:01.667
And small business can be -- the
health care needs of small

00:31:01.667 --> 00:31:06.500
business can take -- be taken
care of with these association

00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.934
health plans and other things
that can be done

00:31:09.934 --> 00:31:12.533
to make it beneficial.

00:31:12.533 --> 00:31:14.867
Thirty-five states have
high-risk pools.

00:31:14.867 --> 00:31:19.467
Most of them, 150 percent is the
maximum cost.

00:31:19.467 --> 00:31:25.533
So you can build on those
high-risk pools to take care of

00:31:25.533 --> 00:31:29.900
people that have needs,
particularly those that would be

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:33.633
hit by the mandate and might not
be able to afford the insurance

00:31:33.633 --> 00:31:35.100
without the high costs.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:38.033
The high cost of this
bill comes from

00:31:38.033 --> 00:31:41.433
an unconstitutional mandate.

00:31:41.433 --> 00:31:46.000
It comes from the fact that for
the first time in the 225-year

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.467
history of the country, the
federal government is telling

00:31:49.467 --> 00:31:51.500
you, you got to buy something.

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.834
That just doesn't make sense to
a lot of people at the

00:31:53.834 --> 00:31:55.767
grassroots of the Midwest.

00:31:55.767 --> 00:31:59.100
And if you think I don't listen
to my people, I've had 32 town

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.500
meetings so far this year.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.633
I think I have a good
feeling of what's out

00:32:03.633 --> 00:32:05.233
there at the grassroots.

00:32:05.233 --> 00:32:10.266
Now, we have unrealistic cuts in
here -- not unrealistic from the

00:32:10.266 --> 00:32:13.633
standpoint of the way
CBO scored them.

00:32:13.633 --> 00:32:15.867
Not at all. CBO is
God around here.

00:32:15.867 --> 00:32:17.900
They say -- we give them
policies that are going to save

00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:21.734
X number of dollars, it's going
to save X number of dollars.

00:32:21.734 --> 00:32:24.633
But do you think that we're
going sit around in rural

00:32:24.633 --> 00:32:29.700
America, or even in urban --
downtown urban America, in the

00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.066
poverty parts of the city,
that we're going

00:32:32.066 --> 00:32:34.400
to let hospitals close down?

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:39.567
And they raise the concern about
access to health care.

00:32:39.567 --> 00:32:45.166
No, we aren't going to reduce
benefits for seniors at all.

00:32:45.166 --> 00:32:50.967
But when you put our health care
institutions and our delivery

00:32:50.967 --> 00:32:55.567
system in jeopardy, well, people
-- you're going to promise

00:32:55.567 --> 00:32:57.800
people health care they aren't
going to get.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.900
If you're going to put 14 -- I
don't know whether it was 14 or

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:05.300
18 million people under this
bill -- into Medicaid --

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.700
Medicaid pays about, in my
state, I think

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:10.500
about 60 or so percent.

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:12.500
Medicare pays 80
percent of cost.

00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.233
Doctors don't take Medicaid.

00:33:14.233 --> 00:33:19.100
So you're going to promise 14 to
18 million people in Medicaid

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.367
that they're going to be
covered.

00:33:21.367 --> 00:33:24.266
But if you don't have doctors to
service them, isn't that a

00:33:24.266 --> 00:33:28.500
little bit intellectually
dishonest, to promise something

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.533
that you can't deliver on?

00:33:30.533 --> 00:33:36.500
And so there are these things in
this bill -- Medicare, Medicaid

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.133
cuts that -- I don't see any
future Congress having any more

00:33:41.133 --> 00:33:45.333
guts than we do to close a rural
hospital.

00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:50.133
So I think that you got to take
into consideration -- you've got

00:33:50.133 --> 00:33:53.333
to take into consideration the
consequences of the acts or the

00:33:53.333 --> 00:33:58.367
unproven promises of cuts that
aren't going to materialize.

00:33:58.367 --> 00:34:00.633
That's just the way I see it.

00:34:00.633 --> 00:34:04.600
And working in those 31
meetings, hundreds of hours of

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.066
meetings with Senator Baucus, I
learned a lot about health care.

00:34:08.066 --> 00:34:12.400
Now, we didn't get a bill out of
that bipartisan effort, but I'm

00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:15.867
sure glad I spent all that time
there because I learned a heck

00:34:15.867 --> 00:34:17.967
of a lot about our health care
system that I

00:34:17.967 --> 00:34:20.467
wouldn't have
otherwise known.

00:34:20.467 --> 00:34:21.800
The President:
Thank you, Chuck.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.834
I'm going to go to Kent next.

00:34:23.834 --> 00:34:30.567
I just want to make one point.

00:34:30.567 --> 00:34:35.734
If the notion is, is that we
can't make some hard decisions

00:34:35.734 --> 00:34:39.467
about how entitlements work
because it's just not realistic,

00:34:39.467 --> 00:34:42.667
nobody is going to have the guts
to do it, then we're in big

00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:50.266
trouble, because that means that
the federal budget and state

00:34:50.266 --> 00:34:53.200
budgets and then business
budgets and family budgets are

00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:55.934
all going to be gobbled up by
this thing.

00:34:55.934 --> 00:35:00.834
So I hope that in fact we've got
the courage to

00:35:00.834 --> 00:35:03.133
make some of these changes.

00:35:03.133 --> 00:35:14.600
Now, when I say that Medicare
Advantage is not a useful way

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:18.700
for us to spend tax dollars to
provide health care to seniors,

00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.033
at least the way it's currently
structured, as I said, that's

00:35:22.033 --> 00:35:23.934
not a Democratic idea.

00:35:23.934 --> 00:35:27.367
I mean, there are a whole bunch
of Republican commentators and

00:35:27.367 --> 00:35:30.400
some of the folks who've sat
around this table before who

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.767
suggested that that's probably
right.

00:35:33.767 --> 00:35:36.867
You can make an argument that
whatever savings we get out of

00:35:36.867 --> 00:35:40.667
Medicare Advantage should not go
to filling the

00:35:40.667 --> 00:35:42.133
doughnut hole, for example.

00:35:42.133 --> 00:35:46.467
That's a legitimate argument.

00:35:46.467 --> 00:35:48.100
You can make an argument
that it should go

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.734
just to deficit reduction.

00:35:50.734 --> 00:35:52.367
Those are all legitimate
arguments.

00:35:52.367 --> 00:35:59.800
But my point is that the savings
that are obtained here are from

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:03.000
a program in which insurance
companies are making a lot of

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.867
money but seniors who are in
these kinds of programs are not

00:36:07.867 --> 00:36:11.867
better off, and the 80 percent
of the people who are [not] in

00:36:11.867 --> 00:36:15.967
these programs are paying an
extra 90 bucks a year to

00:36:15.967 --> 00:36:17.934
subsidize the folks
who are in them.

00:36:17.934 --> 00:36:20.100
And that just doesn't seem like
a good deal for

00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.533
them or for the taxpayer.
Kent Conrad.

00:36:23.533 --> 00:36:24.233
Senator Grassley:
Would you give

00:36:24.233 --> 00:36:25.100
me 30 seconds, please?

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.066
The President:
Sure.

00:36:26.066 --> 00:36:29.266
Senator Grassley:
I think we've

00:36:29.266 --> 00:36:31.367
already had it laid out here in

00:36:31.367 --> 00:36:33.400
four or five different ways how
a heck of a lot

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.200
of money could be saved.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.200
And I think that those things
that we can agree

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:41.633
on we ought to
proceed on.

00:36:41.633 --> 00:36:46.200
But I think that it's legitimate
to take into consideration that

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:52.800
if you're going to have program
cuts that CBO says out there in

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:56.734
the second decade could be 15 to
20 percent a year -- that you

00:36:56.734 --> 00:36:59.700
got to have a system left to
serve the people that we're

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.066
promising health insurance to.

00:37:02.066 --> 00:37:03.333
And that's the point I'm making.

00:37:03.333 --> 00:37:03.867
The President:
But what I'm

00:37:03.867 --> 00:37:04.433
saying is, Chuck -- I think it's

00:37:04.433 --> 00:37:04.967
a legitimate point.

00:37:04.967 --> 00:37:10.133
What I'm saying is that on
Medicare Advantage, that does

00:37:10.133 --> 00:37:14.133
not have to do with the concerns
that you've got about hospitals

00:37:14.133 --> 00:37:18.266
or doctors getting properly
reimbursed.

00:37:18.266 --> 00:37:20.500
This is a program that's going
to insurance companies.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:26.834
But I want to make sure that
Kent gets in here, because Kent

00:37:26.834 --> 00:37:28.700
knows something about the budget
as the chairman

00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:30.467
of the Budget Committee. Kent.

00:37:30.467 --> 00:37:31.066
Senator Conrad:
Well, thank you,

00:37:31.066 --> 00:37:32.066
Mr. President.

00:37:32.066 --> 00:37:37.033
Thank you for allowing us to
come and visit about what really

00:37:37.033 --> 00:37:43.433
is the 800-pound gorilla facing
the federal budget, and that is

00:37:43.433 --> 00:37:47.266
the health care accounts of the
United States -- Medicare,

00:37:47.266 --> 00:37:50.066
Medicaid, and the rest.

00:37:50.066 --> 00:37:55.433
What we all know that is true is
the biggest unfunded liability

00:37:55.433 --> 00:37:59.333
of the United States is
Medicare.

00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:05.500
What we all know is true, as the
trustees have told us, Medicare

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.333
is going to go broke in eight
years.

00:38:08.333 --> 00:38:12.667
So the idea that we don't have
to do anything about Medicare is

00:38:12.667 --> 00:38:15.834
utterly disconnected from
reality.

00:38:15.834 --> 00:38:23.066
The idea that we don't have to
find savings in Medicare is an

00:38:23.066 --> 00:38:27.100
admission that we are headed for
a fiscal cliff that we're going

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.734
to go right over.

00:38:28.734 --> 00:38:32.800
And if we really want to
endanger the benefits to people

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:37.467
who are getting Medicare, the
best way to do that is to do

00:38:37.467 --> 00:38:43.667
nothing, because if we do
nothing, we will guarantee that

00:38:43.667 --> 00:38:47.066
Medicare goes broke.

00:38:47.066 --> 00:38:51.533
So together -- we can either do
this together or we can have

00:38:51.533 --> 00:38:53.834
this imposed on us.

00:38:53.834 --> 00:38:56.200
I very much hope we do it
together.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.633
Senator Coburn, and I'm sorry --
did he leave?

00:38:59.633 --> 00:39:03.200
-- I'm sorry that he's not here,
because he said something that I

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.266
thought was one of the most
important comments made here

00:39:06.266 --> 00:39:09.667
today, and something that I
think has gotten way too little

00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:13.633
attention, and that's
the question of

00:39:13.633 --> 00:39:16.500
those who are chronically ill.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:22.633
As we analyzed Medicare, we
found a startling statistic:

00:39:22.633 --> 00:39:28.200
5 percent of Medicare
beneficiaries, 5 percent, use

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:30.567
half of all the money.

00:39:30.567 --> 00:39:32.667
I think Paul knows this well.

00:39:32.667 --> 00:39:36.633
Five percent used 50 percent of
the money.

00:39:36.633 --> 00:39:37.700
Who are they?

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.467
They're the chronically ill,
people who

00:39:40.467 --> 00:39:43.467
have multiple,
serious conditions.

00:39:43.467 --> 00:39:47.066
And I think Dr. Coburn was
really referencing that when he

00:39:47.066 --> 00:39:50.567
talked about the need to better
coordinate their care, because

00:39:50.567 --> 00:39:56.300
we are wasting massive amounts
of money and getting worse

00:39:56.300 --> 00:39:58.967
health care outcomes than we
could if we better

00:39:58.967 --> 00:40:00.467
coordinated their care.

00:40:00.467 --> 00:40:01.700
What do we mean by that?

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.467
A study was done with 20,000
patients.

00:40:05.467 --> 00:40:07.767
They put a care coordinator on
each one of them.

00:40:07.767 --> 00:40:10.300
These are chronically ill
patients.

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:14.467
And what they found was by
coordinating their care -- and

00:40:14.467 --> 00:40:16.800
the first thing they did, by the
way, is go into their kitchen

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:20.033
tables, sit down, get out all
their prescription drugs; on

00:40:20.033 --> 00:40:24.300
average they found they were
taking 16.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:28.567
They found that by looking at
them they could eliminate eight.

00:40:28.567 --> 00:40:31.500
The result was hundreds of
thousands of dollars of savings

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:34.266
per patient, better health care
outcomes.

00:40:34.266 --> 00:40:37.166
You know, I did this with my own
father-in-law

00:40:37.166 --> 00:40:38.934
in his final illness.

00:40:38.934 --> 00:40:41.934
Went to his kitchen table --
didn't know it was his final

00:40:41.934 --> 00:40:44.300
illness -- got out all his
prescription drugs.

00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.433
Sure enough he was taking 16.

00:40:46.433 --> 00:40:48.967
I get on the phone to the
doctor, I go down the list.

00:40:48.967 --> 00:40:52.533
Dr. Coburn, you were out of the
room -- I referenced you because

00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:55.633
you said something that really
triggered a thought in my mind

00:40:55.633 --> 00:40:57.300
that I think is important.

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:02.233
Went down the list of what my
father-in-law was taking

00:41:02.233 --> 00:41:03.633
-- 16 prescription drugs.

00:41:03.633 --> 00:41:05.333
I get on the line to the doctor.

00:41:05.333 --> 00:41:07.834
He says, well, Kent -- I get
down to about the third one --

00:41:07.834 --> 00:41:08.800
he shouldn't be taking that.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.867
He shouldn't have been taking
that the last five years.

00:41:11.867 --> 00:41:13.700
I get a little further down the
list, two drugs.

00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:15.300
He says, well, Kent, he
shouldn't be

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:16.300
taking those two drugs.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.867
They work against each other.

00:41:17.867 --> 00:41:19.934
I said, doc, how does this
happen?

00:41:19.934 --> 00:41:22.967
He said, Kent, it's very simple.

00:41:22.967 --> 00:41:25.500
He has got a heart condition, he
has got a serious lung

00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:31.266
condition, he has got orthopedic
issues, he's got doctors for

00:41:31.266 --> 00:41:33.900
each one of those, he's getting
prescription drugs mail-order,

00:41:33.900 --> 00:41:36.867
he's getting them at the
hospital pharmacy, he's getting

00:41:36.867 --> 00:41:39.000
them down at the beach.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.633
He's sick and confused, his wife
is sick and confused,

00:41:41.633 --> 00:41:45.066
we've got chaos.

00:41:45.066 --> 00:41:49.033
And my conclusion, after all of
these hundreds of hours of

00:41:49.033 --> 00:41:51.834
hearings and meetings with
Senator Grassley and Senator

00:41:51.834 --> 00:41:56.266
Baucus we're part of and Senator
Enzi was, indeed we do.

00:41:56.266 --> 00:41:59.567
We have a system that is
characterized, especially for

00:41:59.567 --> 00:42:01.767
those people, by chaos.

00:42:01.767 --> 00:42:06.934
We can do better, and we really
don't have a choice, because

00:42:06.934 --> 00:42:10.133
we've got a debt now, a gross
debt, 100 percent of our GDP

00:42:10.133 --> 00:42:14.233
headed for 400 percent that
nobody believes is sustainable.

00:42:14.233 --> 00:42:19.734
So I just pray that we find a
way to come together and deal

00:42:19.734 --> 00:42:23.000
with these things seriously,
because if we don't,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.533
we will rue the day.

00:42:25.533 --> 00:42:27.567
The President:
It's a little bit

00:42:27.567 --> 00:42:29.133
-- I might -- I want to make

00:42:29.133 --> 00:42:32.433
sure that we're balancing off
time between Democrats

00:42:32.433 --> 00:42:36.133
and Republicans here.

00:42:36.133 --> 00:42:40.333
And House and Senate, as well.

00:42:40.333 --> 00:42:43.200
John, go ahead.

00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.033
Congressman Boehner:
Mr. President, I'm going to say

00:42:45.033 --> 00:42:47.767
thank you for having us here.

00:42:47.767 --> 00:42:51.166
I think it's been a useful
conversation.

00:42:51.166 --> 00:42:55.300
And as I listened to you open up
this meeting, I thought to

00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:59.467
myself, I don't disagree with
anything that you said at the

00:42:59.467 --> 00:43:02.600
beginning of the meeting, in
terms of the premise

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.600
for why we're here.

00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:06.633
The American families are
struggling with health care.

00:43:06.633 --> 00:43:08.400
We all know it.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.166
The American people want us to
address this

00:43:11.166 --> 00:43:13.333
in a responsible way.

00:43:13.333 --> 00:43:18.033
And so I believe -- do say
thanks for having us all here.

00:43:18.033 --> 00:43:21.166
I think our job, on behalf of
our constituents and on behalf

00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:24.266
of the American people, is to
listen.

00:43:24.266 --> 00:43:28.467
And I spend time in my district,
I spend time in a lot of places.

00:43:28.467 --> 00:43:30.767
I've heard an awful lot.

00:43:30.767 --> 00:43:33.066
And I can tell you the thing
that I've heard more than

00:43:33.066 --> 00:43:35.667
anything over the last six or
seven months is that the

00:43:35.667 --> 00:43:39.734
American people want us to scrap
this bill.

00:43:39.734 --> 00:43:43.233
They've said it loud, they've
said it clear.

00:43:43.233 --> 00:43:48.300
And let me help understand why.

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.333
First thing is we've just talked
-- we've heard from the two

00:43:50.333 --> 00:43:56.233
budget directors about our
fiscal condition.

00:43:56.233 --> 00:43:59.700
We have Medicare that's going
broke.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.900
We have Social Security that's
going broke.

00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.900
We have Medicaid that is
bankrupting not only the federal

00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:07.767
government, but all the states.

00:44:07.767 --> 00:44:11.567
And yet, here we are having a
conversation about creating a

00:44:11.567 --> 00:44:16.600
new entitlement program that
will bankrupt our country.

00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.400
And it will bankrupt our
country.

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:24.834
It's not that we can't do health
insurance reform to help bring

00:44:24.834 --> 00:44:27.467
down costs, to help save the
system.

00:44:27.467 --> 00:44:32.066
This bill -- this 2,700-page
bill will bankrupt our country.

00:44:32.066 --> 00:44:35.367
And secondly, Mr. President, I'd
point out that I think this is

00:44:35.367 --> 00:44:39.066
-- this right here is a
dangerous experiment.

00:44:39.066 --> 00:44:43.467
We may have problems in our
health care system, but we do

00:44:43.467 --> 00:44:46.767
have the best health care system
in the world, by far.

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:51.533
And having a government takeover
of health care, and I truly

00:44:51.533 --> 00:44:55.867
believe that's what this is, is
a dangerous experiment with the

00:44:55.867 --> 00:44:58.033
best health care system in the
world that

00:44:58.033 --> 00:44:59.567
I don't think we should do.

00:44:59.567 --> 00:45:01.900
So why did I bring
this bill today?

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.834
I'll tell you why I brought it.

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:06.633
We have $500 billion in new
taxes here over

00:45:06.633 --> 00:45:08.900
the next 10 years.

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:11.900
At a time when our economy is
struggling, the last thing we

00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:15.500
need to do is to be raising
taxes on the American people.

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:19.233
Secondly, we've got $500 billion
worth of Medicare cuts here.

00:45:19.233 --> 00:45:21.133
I agree with Kent Conrad.

00:45:21.133 --> 00:45:24.266
We need to deal with the problem
of Medicare.

00:45:24.266 --> 00:45:26.400
But if we're going to deal with
the problem with Medicare and

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:29.500
find savings in Medicare, why
don't we use it to extend the

00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:33.433
life of the Medicare program as
opposed to spending that $500

00:45:33.433 --> 00:45:38.166
billion, creating a new
entitlement program?

00:45:38.166 --> 00:45:39.567
But it's not just,
Mr. President,

00:45:39.567 --> 00:45:42.700
the taxes or the Medicare cuts.

00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:45.767
You've got -- you've got the
individual mandate in here,

00:45:45.767 --> 00:45:49.333
which I think is unwise and I do
believe is unconstitutional.

00:45:49.333 --> 00:45:52.700
You've got an employer mandate
in here that says that

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:55.500
employers, you've got to provide
health insurance to the American

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.667
people or you're going to pay
this tax.

00:45:58.667 --> 00:46:02.533
It's going to drive up the cost
of employment at a time when we

00:46:02.533 --> 00:46:05.166
have over 10 percent, or near 10
percent,

00:46:05.166 --> 00:46:07.967
unemployment in America.

00:46:07.967 --> 00:46:10.967
And beyond that, a lot of
employers are going to look at

00:46:10.967 --> 00:46:13.100
this and say, well, I'll pay the
tax.

00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.600
And they're going to dump their
employees into the so-called

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.800
exchange, because in five years,
every American is going to have

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.266
to go to the exchange to get
their health care.

00:46:23.266 --> 00:46:26.867
And who is going to design every
health care bill offered in the

00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:29.400
exchange under this bill?

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:33.033
The federal government is going
to design every single health

00:46:33.033 --> 00:46:35.166
care bill in America within five
years,

00:46:35.166 --> 00:46:40.000
once this bill were to pass.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.166
I could go on and on and on.

00:46:43.166 --> 00:46:46.033
Let me just -- let me just make
one other point.

00:46:46.033 --> 00:46:51.300
I'll save you -- I'll save you
-- for 30 years, we've had a

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:55.567
federal law that says that we're
not going to have taxpayer

00:46:55.567 --> 00:46:58.433
funding of abortions.

00:46:58.433 --> 00:47:00.433
We've had this debate in the
House.

00:47:00.433 --> 00:47:02.433
It was a very serious debate.

00:47:02.433 --> 00:47:05.834
But in the House -- the House
spoke, and the House upheld the

00:47:05.834 --> 00:47:09.767
language we have had in law for
30 years that there will be no

00:47:09.767 --> 00:47:12.333
taxpayer funding of abortions.

00:47:12.333 --> 00:47:17.100
This bill that we have before us
-- and there was no reference to

00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:21.600
that issue in your outline,
Mr. President, begins -- for the

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:24.600
first time in 30 years, allows
for the taxpayer

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:26.600
funding of abortions.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:31.667
So, Mr. President, what we've
been saying for a long time is,

00:47:31.667 --> 00:47:33.133
let's scrap the bill.

00:47:33.133 --> 00:47:36.367
Let's start with a clean sheet
of paper on those things that we

00:47:36.367 --> 00:47:37.934
can't agree on.

00:47:37.934 --> 00:47:41.867
Let's take a step-by-step
approach that will bring down

00:47:41.867 --> 00:47:44.500
the cost of health insurance in
America, because if we bring

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:48.767
down the cost of health
insurance, we can expand access.

00:47:48.767 --> 00:47:51.967
Mr. President, I told you the
day after -- maybe it was the

00:47:51.967 --> 00:47:54.767
day you were sworn in as
President, that I would never

00:47:54.767 --> 00:47:57.133
say anything outside of the room
that I wouldn't

00:47:57.133 --> 00:47:59.367
say inside the room.

00:47:59.367 --> 00:48:01.133
I've been patient.

00:48:01.133 --> 00:48:04.300
I've listened to the debate
that's going on here.

00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:08.300
But why can't we agree on those
insurance reforms

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.600
that we've talked about?

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:11.333
Why can't we come to an
agreement on

00:48:11.333 --> 00:48:13.333
purchasing across state lines?

00:48:13.333 --> 00:48:16.700
Why can't we do something about
the biggest cost driver, which

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:19.700
is medical malpractice and the
defensive medicine

00:48:19.700 --> 00:48:21.600
that doctors practice?

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.934
Let's start with a clean sheet
of paper and we can actually get

00:48:23.934 --> 00:48:26.200
somewhere and we can get it into
law here in

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.433
the next several months.

00:48:28.433 --> 00:48:30.633
The President:
John, the challenge

00:48:30.633 --> 00:48:31.800
I have here -- and

00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:36.200
this has happened periodically
-- is every so often we have a

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:39.400
pretty good conversation trying
to get on some specifics, and

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:44.934
then we go back to the standard
talking points the Democrats and

00:48:44.934 --> 00:48:47.800
Republicans have had for the
last year.

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:51.400
And that doesn't drive us to an
agreement on issues.

00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:55.467
There are so many things that
you just said that people on

00:48:55.467 --> 00:48:59.367
this side would profoundly
disagree with and I would have

00:48:59.367 --> 00:49:06.667
to say, based on my analysis,
just aren't true, that I think

00:49:06.667 --> 00:49:09.834
the conversation would start
bogging down pretty quick.

00:49:09.834 --> 00:49:13.734
Now, we were trying to focus on
the deficit issue.

00:49:13.734 --> 00:49:19.834
And the fact of the matter is,
as we indicated before, that

00:49:19.834 --> 00:49:21.500
according to the Congressional
Budget Office,

00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:25.400
this would reduce the deficit.

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:29.233
Paul has different ideas about
it.

00:49:29.233 --> 00:49:33.667
Other folks may think that there
are better ways of doing it.

00:49:33.667 --> 00:49:39.700
But right now what we're doing
is focusing on the issue of

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:43.133
federal entitlements and whether
we can make some changes.

00:49:43.133 --> 00:49:45.533
I will come back to you I think
at the end of this session to

00:49:45.533 --> 00:49:48.400
answer a range of the questions
that you just asked.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:52.467
Right now what I want to do is
go to Jim Cooper, who I think

00:49:52.467 --> 00:49:58.834
everybody knows cares pretty
deeply about the federal budget.

00:49:58.834 --> 00:50:02.200
He's been championing this for a
very long time.

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.100
Jim, do you want to address some
of the issues that have been

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:07.500
raised in terms of both Medicare
and Medicaid?

00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:09.700
Representative Cooper:
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:14.533
We're all here, we're dressed
up, we're on good behavior, but

00:50:14.533 --> 00:50:17.400
I think folks back home are
wondering how we behave when the

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.367
camera is off.

00:50:20.367 --> 00:50:22.233
The deficit in my opinion is
probably the

00:50:22.233 --> 00:50:24.100
most single issue we face.

00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:26.066
Paul Ryan said it well -- health
inflation is

00:50:26.066 --> 00:50:30.100
driving us off a cliff.

00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:32.467
And I'm kind of intrigued by the
conversation because so far

00:50:32.467 --> 00:50:35.233
we've heard a lot of folks
trying to out-do each other in

00:50:35.233 --> 00:50:39.967
deficit reduction. I welcome that competition.

00:50:39.967 --> 00:50:44.433
Especially if it's backed up
with votes, because it's easy to

00:50:44.433 --> 00:50:48.333
talk tough on this; it's harder
to deliver.

00:50:48.333 --> 00:50:50.367
I personally like Senator
McCain's suggestion -- let's get

00:50:50.367 --> 00:50:53.233
rid of all the special deals.

00:50:53.233 --> 00:50:56.133
That's just a starting point.

00:50:56.133 --> 00:50:59.900
Paul Ryan is right again and Tom
Coburn is right when they point

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:04.066
out that we're probably wasting
a third of medical spending.

00:51:04.066 --> 00:51:09.367
Medicare alone is $37 trillion
in the hole.

00:51:09.367 --> 00:51:12.100
And that means for all the folks
who want to talk tough and not

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:17.300
vote tough -- that's not good
enough.

00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:20.700
It means that for all the folks
who want to do this next year or

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:24.233
next decade or leave it to their
successor --

00:51:24.233 --> 00:51:28.900
that's not good enough.

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:32.100
We've had some examples of how
we've behaved recently -- a

00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:36.333
wonderful bipartisan measure,
the Conrad/Gregg bill,

00:51:36.333 --> 00:51:38.934
completely bipartisan for years
and a bipartisan,

00:51:38.934 --> 00:51:41.033
fiscal responsibility commission.

00:51:41.033 --> 00:51:45.800
Was brought up for a vote in the
Senate; we had the 60 votes, but

00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:49.900
only 53 people showed up for
work.

00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:52.367
Seven people who had been
original co-sponsors of that

00:51:52.367 --> 00:51:57.166
measure suddenly got different
ideas when the

00:51:57.166 --> 00:51:59.400
moment of truth came.

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:03.400
So, Mr. President, I'm thankful
you appointed a presidential

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:06.800
fiscal responsibility commission
with Alan Simpson and Erskine

00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:11.700
Bowles, to try to force us as a
Congress and force the nation to

00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:13.400
address these fundamental
problems.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:18.233
Because if you love Medicare,
you need to act to save it fast.

00:52:18.233 --> 00:52:23.867
Every day matters.

00:52:23.867 --> 00:52:27.133
A report will come out issued by
the Treasury Department -- it's

00:52:27.133 --> 00:52:29.734
come out every year; it will
come out in the next few days --

00:52:29.734 --> 00:52:32.300
it's the only report that uses
real accounting to describe

00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:36.800
America's fiscal problems, and
the news is not pretty.

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.033
It will reaffirm what's been
discussed here about Medicare

00:52:39.033 --> 00:52:43.600
and Medicaid and other vital
American programs being deeply

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.400
in the hole.

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.800
And the opportunity of cost for
delay is extraordinary.

00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:51.633
So we can face these problems,
Mr. President, we can solve them

00:52:51.633 --> 00:52:55.400
with political will, but the
talking points won't do it.

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.967
We've got to acknowledge the
real questions.

00:52:57.967 --> 00:53:00.100
And as every businessperson in
America knows, if you can't

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.900
measure it, you can't manage it.

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:04.867
And too many people in the
federal government are refusing

00:53:04.867 --> 00:53:08.166
to measure it, much less take
the tough

00:53:08.166 --> 00:53:10.333
votes that are required.

00:53:10.333 --> 00:53:13.333
Because the reason we have a
Medicare Advantage program,

00:53:13.333 --> 00:53:16.133
Mr. President, as you know, is
in 2003 when the other party was

00:53:16.133 --> 00:53:18.700
completely in charge of
everything here, we passed a

00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:20.633
program that as has been pointed
out was almost completely

00:53:20.633 --> 00:53:26.600
unfunded and added $8 trillion
in one bill to

00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.300
our children andgrandchildren.

00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:32.567
Now, these benefits, if offered,
should be paid for.

00:53:32.567 --> 00:53:35.233
So this is a challenge for
everybody in both parties

00:53:35.233 --> 00:53:37.433
because nobody's hands
are clean in this.

00:53:37.433 --> 00:53:39.433
But let's have a new day, a new
beginning --

00:53:39.433 --> 00:53:41.000
I think we could do this.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.500
And this bill is a great place
to start, because if you don't

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:46.600
think this bill reduces the
deficit enough according to CBO,

00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.734
vote for more savings.

00:53:49.734 --> 00:53:53.734
If you want to reform Medicare
some more, vote for it -- don't

00:53:53.734 --> 00:53:55.834
just talk a good game.

00:53:55.834 --> 00:53:58.400
So I hope the American people
are watching because -- and

00:53:58.400 --> 00:53:59.633
they're going to be watching
after the

00:53:59.633 --> 00:54:01.266
cameras are turned
off, too.

00:54:01.266 --> 00:54:03.767
And I'm thankful you called this
meeting because this is a moment

00:54:03.767 --> 00:54:07.266
of truth for our country, and
together

00:54:07.266 --> 00:54:11.133
we can solve this
problem.

00:54:11.133 --> 00:54:13.033
The President:
I want to see if

00:54:13.033 --> 00:54:14.900
there are any Republicans who want to speak.

00:54:14.900 --> 00:54:16.400
I still have Dick Durbin.

00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:17.266
Senator McConnell:
Mr. President,

00:54:17.266 --> 00:54:19.033
I think John McCain.

00:54:19.033 --> 00:54:21.667
Senator Mccain:
Thank you, Mr. President.

00:54:21.667 --> 00:54:24.500
I say to my friend from North
Dakota, none of us want to do

00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:27.200
nothing -- but we do want to
start over.

00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.934
And we've just had a discussion
about the 800,000 carveout and

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:34.667
all of the other special deals
and special interests that were

00:54:34.667 --> 00:54:38.567
included in this bill, which is
more than offensive.

00:54:38.567 --> 00:54:42.734
But I want to talk about one
specific issue on deficit

00:54:42.734 --> 00:54:46.867
reduction and that is medical
malpractice reform.

00:54:46.867 --> 00:54:49.967
Last year, Mr. President, you
said when you spoke to the

00:54:49.967 --> 00:54:52.800
Congress you asked your
distinguished Secretary of

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:57.133
Health and Human Services to
look at ways that we could

00:54:57.133 --> 00:55:00.066
address the issue and then again
this year -- and I pay close

00:55:00.066 --> 00:55:01.800
attention to all of your
speeches.

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.767
The President:
Thank you.

00:55:03.767 --> 00:55:04.834
That's more than Michelle does.

00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:07.200
(laughter)

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:09.767
Senator McCain:
And the point is

00:55:09.767 --> 00:55:12.633
that we don't have
to go very far.

00:55:12.633 --> 00:55:15.934
There's two examples right now
of medical malpractice reform

00:55:15.934 --> 00:55:17.133
that is working.

00:55:17.133 --> 00:55:19.967
One is called California and the
other is called Texas.

00:55:19.967 --> 00:55:23.367
I won't talk about California
because we Arizonians hate

00:55:23.367 --> 00:55:25.567
California because they've
stolen our water.

00:55:25.567 --> 00:55:26.233
(laughter)

00:55:26.233 --> 00:55:30.867
But the fact is that
Texas has established a $750,000

00:55:30.867 --> 00:55:36.367
cap for non-economic damages;
caps doctors at $250,000;

00:55:36.367 --> 00:55:39.900
hospitals at $250,000; and any
additional institution,

00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:45.934
$250,000; and patients harm to a
finding of medical malpractice

00:55:45.934 --> 00:55:47.734
are not subject to any
limitations on

00:55:47.734 --> 00:55:50.300
recoveries for economic losses.

00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.066
And I hope you'll examine it.

00:55:52.066 --> 00:55:54.100
But an important aspect of what
they've done

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.433
in Texas is the following.

00:55:56.433 --> 00:55:58.667
Lawsuit filings are down.

00:55:58.667 --> 00:56:02.300
Defensive medicine increases
annual medical

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.533
costs by 10 percent.

00:56:04.533 --> 00:56:08.533
They've saved -- physicians
recruitment is up.

00:56:08.533 --> 00:56:12.367
In the last two years 6,945 new
physicians have been licensed --

00:56:12.367 --> 00:56:16.166
a 65 percent increase from two
years preceding their reforms;

00:56:16.166 --> 00:56:19.567
31 percent increase in
recruitment of rural

00:56:19.567 --> 00:56:21.266
emergency medicine physicians.

00:56:21.266 --> 00:56:24.967
Amarillo lost 26 physicians in
the two years preceding the

00:56:24.967 --> 00:56:27.567
legislation; has gained 37.

00:56:27.567 --> 00:56:30.166
The largest malpractice
insurance company in the state

00:56:30.166 --> 00:56:34.033
slashed its premiums by 35
percent, saving doctors some

00:56:34.033 --> 00:56:37.300
$217 million over four years.

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:39.934
There are now over 30 companies
competing for business.

00:56:39.934 --> 00:56:41.667
It's already there.

00:56:41.667 --> 00:56:45.667
Now all we have to do is enact
this into legislation and it's

00:56:45.667 --> 00:56:47.200
already been proven.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:51.033
So I don't think we have to
experiment around.

00:56:51.033 --> 00:56:53.867
There are two states that have
proven that you can enact

00:56:53.867 --> 00:56:58.100
medical malpractice reform and
you can have great savings and

00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:01.066
provide health care providers
with the incentives they need.

00:57:01.066 --> 00:57:03.400
And I would just like to finally
mention one other thing.

00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:05.367
There's an issue that's
overhanging this entire

00:57:05.367 --> 00:57:07.567
conversation -- we all know what
it is.

00:57:07.567 --> 00:57:11.767
It's whether the Majority Leader
of the Senate will impose the

00:57:11.767 --> 00:57:14.800
"reconciliation," the 51 votes.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.867
Now, having been in the majority
and the minority -- I prefer the

00:57:18.867 --> 00:57:22.967
majority -- I understand the
frustration that the majority

00:57:22.967 --> 00:57:27.734
feels when they can't get their
agenda through, and it's real

00:57:27.734 --> 00:57:31.100
and I understand it and I have
some sympathy.

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:34.100
But I remember, and I think you
do too, Mr. President, the last

00:57:34.100 --> 00:57:38.800
time when there was a proposal
that we Republicans in the

00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.834
majority would adopt a 51-vote
majority on the issue of the

00:57:43.834 --> 00:57:45.667
confirmation of judges.

00:57:45.667 --> 00:57:48.700
There was a group of us that got
together, said, no, that's not

00:57:48.700 --> 00:57:52.467
the right way to go because that
could deal a fatal blow to the

00:57:52.467 --> 00:57:54.667
unique aspect of the United
States Senate,

00:57:54.667 --> 00:57:57.000
which is a 60 vote majority.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.467
And then we came to an agreement
and it was brought to a halt.

00:58:01.467 --> 00:58:06.400
If a 51 vote reconciliation is
enacted on one-sixth of our

00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.467
gross national product, never
before has there been -- there

00:58:10.467 --> 00:58:15.100
has been reconciliation, but not
at the level of an issue of this

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:18.900
magnitude and I think it could
harm the future of our country

00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.800
and our institution, which I
love a great deal,

00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:23.233
for a long, long time.

00:58:23.233 --> 00:58:23.700
The President:
Okay.

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:26.500
Let me just address two of the
points that you've made and then

00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:28.100
I'm going to turn to Dick.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:31.266
This issue of reconciliation has
been brought up.

00:58:31.266 --> 00:58:37.667
Again, I think the American
people aren't always all that

00:58:37.667 --> 00:58:42.500
interested in procedures inside
the Senate.

00:58:42.500 --> 00:58:47.734
I do think that they want a vote
on how we're going to move this

00:58:47.734 --> 00:58:54.200
forward, and I think that most
Americans think that a majority

00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:56.967
vote makes sense.

00:58:56.967 --> 00:59:02.300
But I also think that this is an
issue that could be bridged if

00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:06.900
we can arrive at some agreement
on ways to move forward.

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:11.567
Medicare -- or the issue of
malpractice that you brought up,

00:59:11.567 --> 00:59:14.500
I've already said that I think
this is a real issue.

00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.900
I disagree with John Boehner
that -- John, when you say that

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.166
it's the single biggest driver
of medical inflation, that's

00:59:20.166 --> 00:59:22.300
just not the case.

00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:26.000
The Congressional Budget Office
took a look at the proposal

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:30.433
you've got for medical
malpractice and estimates that

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:35.934
the government system would save
about $50 billion over 10 years,

00:59:35.934 --> 00:59:39.467
which is $5 billion a year --
which is real money but

00:59:39.467 --> 00:59:43.567
understand that we've got a $2
trillion system.

00:59:43.567 --> 00:59:46.133
Let's assume that you
extrapolate that into

00:59:46.133 --> 00:59:48.033
the private marketplace.

00:59:48.033 --> 00:59:51.867
Say it's another $5 billion or
another $10 billion.

00:59:51.867 --> 00:59:56.266
It's still a small portion of
our overall

00:59:56.266 --> 00:59:58.467
health inflation problems.

00:59:58.467 --> 01:00:03.266
But having said that, it's still
something that I care about and

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.300
I've said I care about it.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:09.166
Now, not only have I asked
Kathleen to initiate some pilot

01:00:09.166 --> 01:00:14.767
programs at the state level, but
there are some examples of

01:00:14.767 --> 01:00:19.066
legislation that I actually
would be interested in pursuing.

01:00:19.066 --> 01:00:24.533
Tom Coburn, you and Richard Burr
have talked about incentivizing

01:00:24.533 --> 01:00:30.934
and allowing states to
experiment much more vigorously

01:00:30.934 --> 01:00:35.800
with ways to reduce frivolous
lawsuits, to pursue settlements,

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:37.867
to reduce defensive medicine.

01:00:37.867 --> 01:00:39.900
That's something I'd like
to see if we could

01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.400
potentially get going.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:48.400
So I might not agree to what
John Boehner has proposed, and

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:52.667
it's interesting that I think
I've heard a lot today about how

01:00:52.667 --> 01:00:56.767
we shouldn't have Washington
impose on the states ideas,

01:00:56.767 --> 01:01:00.367
except when it comes to the
ideas that you guys like, in

01:01:00.367 --> 01:01:05.300
which case it's fine to override
what states are doing.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:07.500
There seems to be a little bit
of a contradiction on this, but

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:10.967
I think there may be a way of
doing it that allows states to

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:14.467
tackle this issue in a very
serious way.

01:01:14.467 --> 01:01:17.400
And I'd be interested in working
with you, John, and working with

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.467
Tom to see if we can potentially
make that happen -- if we can

01:01:21.467 --> 01:01:28.967
arrive at a package that also
deals with the other drivers of

01:01:28.967 --> 01:01:30.734
health care inflation that are
so important.

01:01:30.734 --> 01:01:32.367
Now, we're running out of time.

01:01:32.367 --> 01:01:36.200
I've got Dick Durbin, and then
what we're going to just do is

01:01:36.200 --> 01:01:41.200
go into coverage and that will
-- I know that Henry and John

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:44.934
and Charles have been interested
in talking about it, and frankly

01:01:44.934 --> 01:01:47.500
is something that we haven't
spoken a lot about lately and

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.767
that is a whole bunch of people
who just don't have health care.

01:01:49.767 --> 01:01:51.533
Go ahead, Dick.

01:01:51.533 --> 01:01:53.500
Senator Durbin:
Mr. President,

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.600
I've been biding my time

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:55.567
throughout this entire meeting.

01:01:55.567 --> 01:01:57.700
I thank you for inviting us on

01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.000
the issue of medical
malpractice.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.100
Before I was elected to
Congress,

01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:02.367
I worked in a courtroom.

01:02:02.367 --> 01:02:06.000
For years I defended doctors and
hospitals, and for years I sued

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.867
them on behalf of people who

01:02:07.867 --> 01:02:09.433
were victims of medical
malpractice.

01:02:09.433 --> 01:02:11.800
So I've sat at both tables in a
courtroom.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.033
At least many years ago, I think
I kind of understood this area

01:02:15.033 --> 01:02:16.834
of the law better than some.

01:02:16.834 --> 01:02:20.100
But I listen time and again as
our friends on the other side,

01:02:20.100 --> 01:02:22.233
when they're asked what are the
most important things you can do

01:02:22.233 --> 01:02:24.700
when it comes to our health care
system in America, the first

01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.867
thing they say is medical
malpractice -- it's the first

01:02:26.867 --> 01:02:30.166
thing they say; today it was the
first thing that was said.

01:02:30.166 --> 01:02:32.600
The point that's been made by
the President is if we do

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:35.967
believe the Congressional Budget
Office when Orrin Hatch asked

01:02:35.967 --> 01:02:40.700
them how much will we save if we
implement the Republican plan on

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:42.767
medical malpractice
from the House,

01:02:42.767 --> 01:02:45.934
they said $54 billion
over 10 years.

01:02:45.934 --> 01:02:49.333
Five-point-four billion a year
is a lot of money, except in the

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:52.400
context of a $2. 5 trillion bill

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.667
that we pay each
year for health care.

01:02:54.667 --> 01:02:58.867
It represents one-fifth of 1
percent of the amount of money

01:02:58.867 --> 01:03:01.834
we spend each year on health
care.

01:03:01.834 --> 01:03:04.533
The Congressional Budget Office
said something else.

01:03:04.533 --> 01:03:07.533
They said, and as you lose
accountability for what the

01:03:07.533 --> 01:03:13.333
doctors and hospitals are doing,
more people will die -- 4,800 a

01:03:13.333 --> 01:03:15.467
year, according to the
Congressional Budget Office's

01:03:15.467 --> 01:03:17.734
reference to this study.

01:03:17.734 --> 01:03:20.967
Now, the Institute of Medicine
tells us 98,000 people a year

01:03:20.967 --> 01:03:23.767
die in America because of
medical malpractice.

01:03:23.767 --> 01:03:25.734
I think there are things that we
have put in

01:03:25.734 --> 01:03:27.567
this bill to change that.

01:03:27.567 --> 01:03:30.567
Most of you have heard of this
Dr. Gawande.

01:03:30.567 --> 01:03:31.333
We've read him.

01:03:31.333 --> 01:03:32.900
I've talked to him on the phone.

01:03:32.900 --> 01:03:36.433
His checklist manifesto is a
very basic approach to reducing

01:03:36.433 --> 01:03:39.633
medical errors, which is what we
should be focused on.

01:03:39.633 --> 01:03:41.300
And I want to say,
Mr. President, I think what you

01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.333
and the Secretary have done is
the right thing -- incentivizing

01:03:44.333 --> 01:03:49.033
states to find innovative ways
to reduce medical errors and

01:03:49.033 --> 01:03:52.367
reduce those lawsuits that
should not be filed.

01:03:52.367 --> 01:03:55.734
But let me tell you what,
limiting the recovery for pain

01:03:55.734 --> 01:03:59.734
and suffering for someone who is
entitled -- entitled, because

01:03:59.734 --> 01:04:01.767
they are innocent
victims to be paid --

01:04:01.767 --> 01:04:05.066
isn't eliminating junk lawsuits.

01:04:05.066 --> 01:04:08.166
I will tell you that as far as
the President is concerned, in

01:04:08.166 --> 01:04:09.667
his neighborhood there is a
great hospital,

01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:11.367
which I will not name.

01:04:11.367 --> 01:04:15.834
And at this hospital, a woman
went in for a simple removal of

01:04:15.834 --> 01:04:19.200
a mole from her face, and under
general anesthesia, the oxygen

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:22.166
caught fire, burning her face.

01:04:22.166 --> 01:04:25.300
She went through repeated
surgeries, scars, and deformity.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:27.266
Her life will never be the same.

01:04:27.266 --> 01:04:30.200
And you are saying that this
innocent woman is only entitled

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:32.333
to $250,000 in pain and
suffering.

01:04:32.333 --> 01:04:34.100
I don't think it's fair.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:35.800
Our jury system makes that
decision.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:37.567
And the states -- 30 of them --

01:04:37.567 --> 01:04:39.100
have made a decision
on what to do.

01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:41.333
If you were asked a basic
question, over the last 20

01:04:41.333 --> 01:04:44.633
years, has the number of paid
malpractice claims in America

01:04:44.633 --> 01:04:47.467
doubled or been cut in half?

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:48.934
If you listened to most people,
you'd say they must have

01:04:48.934 --> 01:04:52.633
doubled. No. According to the Kaiser Foundation,

01:04:52.633 --> 01:04:53.667
they've been cut in half.

01:04:53.667 --> 01:04:57.266
Oh, but how about the money
that's being paid for

01:04:57.266 --> 01:04:58.467
these malpractice claims?

01:04:58.467 --> 01:05:00.767
Clearly, that's going through
the roof. No.

01:05:00.767 --> 01:05:04.734
Between 2003 and 2008, the total
amount paid for malpractice

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.600
claims in America
was cut in half,

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.800
from $8 billion to $4 billion.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.166
This is an important issue.

01:05:11.166 --> 01:05:12.066
I don't dispute it.

01:05:12.066 --> 01:05:14.367
And I think we have treated it
as an important issue.

01:05:14.367 --> 01:05:18.533
But to make it the overriding
issue, is to I think really

01:05:18.533 --> 01:05:21.000
trivialize some of the other
things that should be part

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.266
of this conversation.

01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:24.133
I have been asked to speak about
deficit reduction.

01:05:24.133 --> 01:05:27.467
I will not, other than to say
one general thing.

01:05:27.467 --> 01:05:30.433
When I hear my friend, John
Boehner, say that we have the

01:05:30.433 --> 01:05:33.734
best health care in the world, I
don't dispute it for a moment.

01:05:33.734 --> 01:05:36.633
If I were sick, this is the
country I want to be in -- with

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:40.100
these doctors, these hospitals,
and these medical professionals.

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:44.266
But step back for a second and
look at who we are in this room.

01:05:44.266 --> 01:05:48.700
As was said many years ago, the
law in its majestic equality

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:51.166
forbids both the wealthy
and the poor

01:05:51.166 --> 01:05:53.367
from sleeping under
bridges.

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:56.533
When it comes to the wealthy and
health care, per capita we're

01:05:56.533 --> 01:05:58.367
the wealthiest people in
America.

01:05:58.367 --> 01:06:01.667
The Federal Employees Health
Benefit program, administered by

01:06:01.667 --> 01:06:04.667
the federal government, setting
minimum standards for the health

01:06:04.667 --> 01:06:07.433
insurance that we enjoy as
individuals and want for our

01:06:07.433 --> 01:06:10.100
families is all we're asking for
in this bill

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.233
for families across
America.

01:06:12.233 --> 01:06:14.467
If you think it's a socialist
plot and it's wrong, for

01:06:14.467 --> 01:06:15.767
goodness sakes, drop out of the

01:06:15.767 --> 01:06:18.467
Federal Employees
Health Benefit program.

01:06:18.467 --> 01:06:20.433
But if you think it's good
enough for your family,

01:06:20.433 --> 01:06:22.433
shouldn't our health insurance
be good enough

01:06:22.433 --> 01:06:24.033
for the rest of
America?

01:06:24.033 --> 01:06:25.467
That's what it gets down to.

01:06:25.467 --> 01:06:27.266
Why have this double standard?

01:06:27.266 --> 01:06:28.867
Tom Harkin is right.

01:06:28.867 --> 01:06:32.633
Why do we continue to
discriminate against people,

01:06:32.633 --> 01:06:35.967
when we know that each one of us
is only one accident or one

01:06:35.967 --> 01:06:40.133
diagnosis away from being one of
those unfortunate few who can't

01:06:40.133 --> 01:06:42.300
afford or can't find health
insurance?
