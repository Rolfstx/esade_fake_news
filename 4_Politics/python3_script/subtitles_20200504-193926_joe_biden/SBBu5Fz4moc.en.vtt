I am desperate and do
not know what to do.

00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:38.505
Do it for them.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.442
Do it for people who are
really scared right now,

00:00:42.442 --> 00:00:43.843

of their own.

00:00:43.843 --> 00:00:45.178

rules, who have done all

00:00:45.178 --> 00:00:47.013
the right things.

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:48.281

00:00:48.915 --> 00:00:54.587
Let's get this done.

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.105
Somebody knows where
Alonya Sanchez is?

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:16.443

Female Speaker: Yeah so
it will be about forty

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:39.826
minutes, then you will
have fifteen minutes of

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:40.960
calls, then the talks.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.829
Male Speaker: What do you
think they're going to do -

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.964
The President: You guys
could have had some popcorn.

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:49.235
(laughter)

00:03:10.156 --> 00:03:10.924
The President: I want to
thank my outstanding Vice

00:03:10.924 --> 00:03:13.960
President, Joe Biden.

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.562
And my wonderful secretary
of Health and Human

00:03:15.562 --> 00:03:19.265
Services Kathleen Sebelius

00:03:19.265 --> 00:03:21.634
on this issue.

00:03:21.634 --> 00:03:24.170
I want to thank the many
staffers in congress, and

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:27.640
my own incredible staff
in the White House.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.810
Who have worked tirelessly
over the past year to give

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.280
Americans of all walk
of life, towards reform

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.150
package finally worthy of
the people we were sent

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.154
here to serve.

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:43.790
All right, the
party's upstairs.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.259
Whenever you got people
running up, and someone

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:47.994
else can come with me now.

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:52.131
(talking simultaneously)

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:04.177
Multiple Speakers:
(cheering)

00:04:04.177 --> 00:04:06.012
The President: Nancy
Ann, Nancy Ann.

00:04:06.012 --> 00:04:11.317
Multiple Speakers:
(cheering)

00:04:11.317 --> 00:04:12.752
The President: That
does not work as well.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.954
(laughter)

00:04:14.954 --> 00:04:18.358
I am not going to ruin
a good party with long speech.

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:25.465
So many of you guys have
worked so hard during the

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:27.767
course of this year
under incredibly

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:29.235
adverse circumstances.

00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:32.538
Your families have,
you know, shared the

00:04:32.538 --> 00:04:33.906
sacrifices with you.

00:04:33.906 --> 00:04:35.008
You are all
younger than me.

00:04:35.008 --> 00:04:35.975
(laughter)

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:38.945
So you can work on three
hours sleep, but I cannot.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:42.348
So I am going to start
retiring you guys can stay

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:43.249
as long as you want.

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.652
All right, thank you guys.

00:04:45.652 --> 00:04:48.187
(applause)

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:24.624
The Vice President: Hey
Al, how are you doing buddy?

00:05:24.624 --> 00:05:25.925
Male Speaker: I am doing
fine Mr. Vice President.

00:05:25.925 --> 00:05:26.659
How are you?

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:27.293
The Vice President:
Good to see you.

00:05:27.293 --> 00:05:27.894
I'm well.

00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:28.294
How are you?

00:05:28.294 --> 00:05:29.328
Good to see you.

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:31.030
So it really is 220 pages.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.231
Male Speaker:
Yeah, it's --

00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:33.833
The Vice President:
599 pages.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:34.567
I'm just joking.

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:36.803
Male Speaker: Well it's --
in this format it

00:05:36.803 --> 00:05:40.306
is 906 pages.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:41.908
The Vice President: All
right, I like big bills.

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:43.309
You what I mean,
I am a Democrat.

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.212
Male Speaker: Here you go.

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:46.913
The Vice President:
All right.

00:05:46.913 --> 00:05:47.513
Male Speaker: That's it.

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:48.781
Female Speaker: Woohoo.

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.818
The Vice President: Tell
you what, I never thought

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:53.920
being president's second I
would get to sign a bill.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.054
(laughter)

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:56.456
Male Speaker: Yes you do.

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:57.390
There are perks.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:58.858
The Vice President: My
Lord Al this thing is -

00:05:58.858 --> 00:05:59.492
Male Speaker: Want
to sign them all?

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:03.162
The Vice President:
Yeah, no.

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:04.664
Male Speaker: Greetings.

00:06:04.664 --> 00:06:05.832
Female Speaker: Holy cow.

00:06:05.832 --> 00:06:06.466
Male Speaker: Yes.

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.134
(laughter)

00:06:08.134 --> 00:06:09.068
Female Speaker: That's
the biggest one yet.

00:06:09.068 --> 00:06:09.769
Male Speaker: Yeah it's -

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:10.269
Female Speaker:
Here we go.

00:06:10.269 --> 00:06:10.903
Male Speaker:
-- pretty large.

00:06:10.903 --> 00:06:11.904
Male Speaker: There it is.

00:06:11.904 --> 00:06:13.206
Female Speaker:
Here it is.

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:33.092
The President:
What's going on?

00:06:33.092 --> 00:06:34.594
Let's do this.

00:06:34.594 --> 00:06:35.595
(talking simultaneously)

00:06:47.373 --> 00:06:50.610
I've got to sign it 22 times. That's a lot of pens man.

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.411
(talking simultaneously)

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:57.483
Male Speaker: Ladies and
Gentleman please take your

00:06:57.483 --> 00:07:09.362
seats the program
is about to begin.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.665
The President: The reason
we made history today was

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:13.833
because of you guys.

00:07:13.833 --> 00:07:20.173
And, you know, I -- this
place is kind of a bubble,

00:07:20.173 --> 00:07:22.675
and one of the ways I
remind myself of why I

00:07:22.675 --> 00:07:26.746
ran, and why this is
important is to be able to

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:30.016
read the letters, or
emails, or meet people at

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:32.785
town halls who tell me
stories all the time about

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:35.221
what they are
going through.

00:07:35.221 --> 00:07:38.090
And sometimes the stories
are heartbreaking, you

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:43.930
know, because as powerful
as it seems the President

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:47.266
is, you know, you can't
solve these things

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:48.501
overnight sometimes.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:50.837
So, you know, you will get
a letter from somebody who

00:07:50.837 --> 00:07:53.172
just lost their job, or is
about to lose their house

00:07:53.172 --> 00:07:55.875
and you want nothing more
than to be able to help them.

00:07:55.875 --> 00:08:01.047
And you can't do it as
fast as you want, or as

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:08.321
immediately as you would
like, but if you stay with

00:08:08.321 --> 00:08:10.823
it every once in a while
you actually get something

00:08:10.823 --> 00:08:13.259
that helps some folks, and
it might not even help

00:08:13.259 --> 00:08:16.128
them tomorrow, but it will
help them a year from now

00:08:16.128 --> 00:08:18.631
or five years from now.

00:08:18.631 --> 00:08:19.899
And, you know that's --
Male Speaker: It

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:20.733
will help our kids --

00:08:20.733 --> 00:08:21.367
The President:
Yeah, it will help -

00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:21.901
Male Speaker: And
our grandkids.

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.069
The President: -- our
kids and our grandkids.

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:27.773
And that's really what
this is all about, so this

00:08:27.773 --> 00:08:29.008
really was your day.

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:33.412
You know, I know it may
sound corny, but I

00:08:33.412 --> 00:08:34.113
really believe it.

00:08:34.113 --> 00:08:36.282
That if it were not for
you just telling your

00:08:36.282 --> 00:08:38.651
stories, and letting
yourselves be heard that

00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:42.655
we would not have been
able to overcome so

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.757
much of the resistance
to get it done.

00:08:44.757 --> 00:08:47.093
So, you should pat
yourselves on the back.

00:08:47.093 --> 00:08:48.261
All right.

00:08:48.261 --> 00:08:51.731
Okay, I am going to write
this note for you, myself.
