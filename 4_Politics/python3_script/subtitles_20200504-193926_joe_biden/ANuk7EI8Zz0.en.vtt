00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 align:start position:0%
particular hospital where he probably
 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.990 align:start position:0%
particular hospital where he probably
would<00:03:34.380><c> have</c><00:03:34.500><c> had</c><00:03:34.650><c> access</c><00:03:34.890><c> to</c><00:03:35.310><c> those</c><00:03:35.430><c> meds</c><00:03:35.760><c> and</c>

so it didn't seem weird it wasn't like
 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.590 align:start position:0%
so it didn't seem weird it wasn't like

it was you know he's not a carpenter he
 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.150 align:start position:0%
it was you know he's not a carpenter he
would've<00:03:41.880><c> had</c><00:03:41.970><c> that</c><00:03:42.030><c> but</c><00:03:42.450><c> the</c>

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 align:start position:0%
would've had that but the
 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
would've had that but the
syringes<00:03:44.030><c> didn't</c><00:03:44.360><c> seem</c><00:03:44.570><c> super</c><00:03:45.470><c> weird</c><00:03:45.770><c> but</c>

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 align:start position:0%
