00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.552
- Massive, massive, Antonov 124 Ruslan.

00:00:03.552 --> 00:00:05.890
(dramatic music)

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.870
So we're going to go inside the Antonov.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.393
It looks like it's ready
to take the cargo soon.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.940
Let's go upper deck and
take a look at the cockpit.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.410
Quite a challenge to come
up those set of stairs.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.113
I've never seen a huge cockpit
like this, unbelievable.

00:00:25.248 --> 00:00:26.248
- Volga 2612

00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:30.183
from East Midlands to Toulouse.

00:00:30.183 --> 00:00:32.410
- It's like a passenger cabin inside

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.890
a cargo plane Antonov 124.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.590
Who use ear plugs if you're
an AvgGeek on the Antonov?

00:00:39.302 --> 00:00:43.063
- [Tower] Volga 2612, Runway
Two Seven, clear to take off.

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:46.270
- Now off on entry 27, happy flying.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.103
(intercom chatter in Russian)

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:54.202
(engines roar)

00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:57.923
- I think my AvGeek really came out today.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.560
(dramatic music)

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.230
Massive, massive Antonov 124
Ruslan freighter just arrived.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.130
400 tonne of freighter behind me,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.710
and today I'm very lucky to document

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.310
the whole loading experience,

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.307
and then going to fly on this Antonov 124.

00:01:54.307 --> 00:01:57.057
(dramatic music)

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.043
So we're going to go inside
the Antonov, follow me.

00:02:13.228 --> 00:02:15.811
(engines whir)

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.270
It's actually empty.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.930
It looks like it's ready
to take the cargo soon.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.690
Design of the plane is
being self-sufficient

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.250
when the plane arrive at any destination,

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.500
doesn't need additional infrastructures.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.490
They have all these plywood here,

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.767
and you can see all these tubes

00:02:32.767 --> 00:02:35.420
used for loading, offloading.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.620
And I can see some tyres.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.090
Check out how many spare tyres,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.040
one, two, three, four, five, six.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.280
Everything is carried in
the plane just in case

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.630
they need additional
support, everything is here.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.910
It's unbelievable, isn't it?

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.560
Vladimir here just joined me.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.080
He's the head of the load planning here.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.870
He's going to explain to us
what exactly is happening.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.726
How many crew here usually
doing the loading and unloading?

00:03:01.726 --> 00:03:04.560
- [Vladimir] We have a
six-people flight crew,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.850
and we have a seven-people technical crew.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.550
All these guys are licenced engineers.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.090
This crew is capable to repair aircraft,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.720
find problems and rectify them
in any airport of the world.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.530
- And then you can load from the front

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:21.990
or you can also load from the back.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.400
- Yeah, from the back we
load with a crane system

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.630
and we can drive large
vehicle from the rear.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.703
- [Sam] Ah, you can drive big
cars, big vehicles inside.

00:03:32.703 --> 00:03:34.270
- Outside of the lorries.
- Right.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.050
- Now we open front ramp,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.450
and aircraft will be shortened

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.897
of three degrees to the tarmac.

00:03:41.897 --> 00:03:44.060
- [Sam] Oh, so this
whole thing can go flat?

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.620
- [Vladimir] It will be flat, yeah.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.090
And then, at front of aircraft,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:48.590
we will be use extension ramp.

00:03:51.217 --> 00:03:54.467
(energetic rock music)

00:04:14.563 --> 00:04:17.580
And at the moment our
loadmaster, Konstantin,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.340
instal an extension ramp,
levelling it using laser,

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:24.670
because we have to instal extension ramp

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.080
in aircraft floor in
absolutely one surface,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.980
without any bend.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.740
Normally, these feet
of great pieces of ramp

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.598
should stay on the ground, on the tarmac,

00:04:35.598 --> 00:04:38.090
but for load special things we instal them

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.630
on the ramp supports.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.620
And then extension ramp will be built

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.700
at front of aircraft, the same angle.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.950
(energetic rock music)

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.510
- So while they're setting
up to load the cargo

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:58.010
let's go upper deck to
take a look at the cockpit.

00:05:04.738 --> 00:05:06.680
I never climbed to a cockpit like this.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.700
This is quite a challenge
to come up a set of stairs

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.059
just to get up, Upper Deck here.

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.892
Ha, oof!

00:05:14.653 --> 00:05:17.610
Unbelievable, unbelievable cockpit.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.250
Six men operating this Antonov 124.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.030
It's a huge office.

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.830
I've never seen a huge cockpit like this

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.532
Unbelievable.

00:05:27.532 --> 00:05:30.282
(dramatic music)

00:05:45.304 --> 00:05:47.450
- This aircraft was designed in 1970s,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.023
and this aircraft still modern aircraft.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.040
Even that time,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.910
they designed control
for aircraft fly-by-wire.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.760
- [Sam] Wow, in the
design 1970s, fly-by-wire.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.323
- Yeah, but it's absolutely reliable.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.450
Very good aircraft control system.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.450
And, of course, our airline
working on modernise aircraft.

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:14.330
And you see here, new
multifunctional display

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.080
to help pilots to control aircraft.

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:21.080
To see navigation we instal new radar.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.740
It's better quality and more suitable

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:25.990
for international flight.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.510
And you see when they sit in here

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.680
you are at the altitude of 10 metres.

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.724
- Yeah, one of the highest
cockpits in the plane, I guess.

00:06:33.724 --> 00:06:36.307
(sombre music)

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.350
- Navigator workstation.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.000
We have here navigation computer,

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.630
navigational equipment,
multifunctional display,

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.863
long-range navigation system.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.180
Another navigation computer using GPS.

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.180
And it use GPS and Russian
navigation system as well.

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.660
This is chief flight engineer.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.086
His responsibility is engine
systems, hydraulic systems,

00:07:10.086 --> 00:07:12.900
air conditioner system, fire system.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.566
He has his own computer,
allowing him to control

00:07:17.566 --> 00:07:20.963
almost everything on this aircraft.

00:07:20.963 --> 00:07:23.770
This position is flight engineer

00:07:24.641 --> 00:07:26.870
of electric system.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:31.870
His responsibility is
energy, electric, batteries.

00:07:32.447 --> 00:07:33.740
And these flight engineer

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:36.460
actually normally change their positions.

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.580
One flight one chief
engineer, and another flight

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:41.264
another chief engineer, actually,

00:07:41.264 --> 00:07:43.000
it's a very good specialist.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.510
It's a workstation for radio operator.

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:48.110
His responsibility is to
communicate with the ground

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.220
with the air traffic controller.

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.680
To keep frequencies requires he has

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.980
all the required radio equipment
on his or her position.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.240
- Oh-ho!

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:02.953
Behind the cockpit here I can
see this is our crew rest.

00:08:02.953 --> 00:08:05.870
I can see very cosy here,
you can sit down, right?

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:07.020
Yeah.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.513
- Yes, and we have a compartment.

00:08:10.357 --> 00:08:14.060
Two crew compartments
for the rest of the crew.

00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:15.710
And sometimes we have on aircraft

00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:18.820
one-half crew to extend working hours.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:22.360
And people can really have good rest here,

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.320
and drink tea, coffee, prepare some food.

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.260
- It's like train seats, isn't it?

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.610
- Yeah, and do you see
it's a seat number three?

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:33.443
- Uh-huh.

00:08:34.544 --> 00:08:36.080
Oh!
- Watch.

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.540
- [Sam] You have more seats up there!

00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:40.102
Ah, so one person can sit here.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:42.150
- Yes, yes, you can sleep here.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:45.750
- Yeah, so you can have six beds really.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.160
Very cool, very cosy.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.190
I also like the colours,

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.900
I like the flowers actually, obviously.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.607
My mother is a fan of these. (laughs)

00:08:52.607 --> 00:08:54.138
- But actually, now we are entering

00:08:54.138 --> 00:08:57.351
to the forward technical compartment.

00:08:57.351 --> 00:09:00.563
And in this compartment
located many, many systems.

00:09:00.563 --> 00:09:04.630
Fuel support, electric
system, inertial system

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.640
And as well we have here fire system.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:09.883
Belongs with fire gas

00:09:12.083 --> 00:09:13.761
for emergency.

00:09:13.761 --> 00:09:16.186
This equipment is actually a reducer

00:09:16.186 --> 00:09:19.335
that is retracting flaps when we fly

00:09:19.335 --> 00:09:23.752
to make aircraft in landing
or takeoff configuration.

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:28.220
- It's really eye-opening
to see the crew rest

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.310
right behind cockpit,
such a big crew rest.

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.540
Avionics at the back, and
incredible, just incredible,

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.477
built in the '70s like this.

00:09:36.477 --> 00:09:39.740
And one more interesting
thing, look at the plane.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.660
You can see through from
the front to the back.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.480
There's not many planes that can do that,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.090
and this is quite a unique feature.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:50.130
It's unbelievably complex operation.

00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.070
Now you see behind me
the crane has arrived.

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:55.487
The crane will be helping
to bring the cargo

00:09:55.487 --> 00:09:58.433
to get loaded into the front door.

00:09:58.433 --> 00:10:01.683
(energetic rock music)

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:08.940
So the crane now has
started to load the cargo.

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:10.620
Shortly we'll load into the aircraft,

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.050
but we're not allowed to see the cargo.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.880
We're not allowed,
actually, to film the cargo.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:16.840
It's very sensitive item.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.060
Typically on the An-124
it carry oversize cargo

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:23.360
such as generators,
such as aircraft engine,

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:27.260
satellites, mobile hospital
for humanitarian purposes.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.393
Also the oversize haul cargo.

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:40.320
So I just found out today the Antonov

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.320
is taking 21 tonnes of fuel
for the flight to Toulouse.

00:10:45.327 --> 00:10:48.577
(energetic rock music)

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.140
- Just looking around the aeroplane

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:57.340
and checking condition of engines.

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.733
Surface of landing gears.

00:11:00.653 --> 00:11:03.570
(speaking Russian)

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.653
- Today we are preparing for flight.

00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:37.613
Volga 2612 from East Midlands to Toulouse.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.890
- Cruising level, it
will be two niner zero.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:46.170
And speed,

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.283
approximately 700 kilometres per hour.

00:11:50.397 --> 00:11:54.000
Today we expect full powers for takeoff.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.830
- Is this an easy aeroplane to fly

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.910
or it's very difficult to fly Antonov 124?

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:02.073
- For me it's easier type of aircraft.

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:05.971
- Compared with Boeing.
- Compared with Boeing!

00:12:05.971 --> 00:12:08.056
- Compared with Boeing, yeah.
(Sam laughs)

00:12:08.056 --> 00:12:11.389
(crew speaking Russian)

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:20.216
- When the startup procedure is completed,

00:12:20.216 --> 00:12:23.620
the sign will be in green.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.280
Nose gear is on the locked

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:29.560
in the ground position.

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.975
- Green light.
- Green light will be.

00:12:31.975 --> 00:12:35.225
(energetic rock music)

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.601
- This is the tow bar for the Antonov 124,

00:12:53.601 --> 00:12:55.920
and later we'll be using this
to push back the aircraft.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.370
- Oh look, I've been
told this equipment here,

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:03.034
this is the world's biggest
tow bar for any aircraft.

00:13:03.034 --> 00:13:06.284
(energetic rock music)

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:23.990
We're going to take off soon,

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.790
but however, the back door remain open

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:28.840
because they're going to put a tow bar.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.090
Once the plane's towed and pushed back

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:33.100
they going to put a tow bar back in.

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.490
And now I'm actually going
to sit in a hidden place,

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.510
which is the cabin crew rest,

00:13:38.510 --> 00:13:41.420
which is actually here, above me there.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.110
So it's 10-meter high where it is.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.703
A complete separate
compartment to the cockpit.

00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.830
This is the aft cabin crew rest.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.953
Wow, this is hidden, look at this!

00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.100
It's like a passenger
cabin inside a cargo plane

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.063
Antonov 124, this is quite cosy here.

00:14:10.235 --> 00:14:13.485
(energetic rock music)

00:14:23.518 --> 00:14:25.580
And then this is actually
a loadmaster station.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.150
You can actually listen, too,

00:14:27.150 --> 00:14:29.320
but only if you understand Russian.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.170
You can listen to the
communications in between.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:35.660
And actually I found many,
many interesting things.

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.030
This one here is for shoeshine,

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.410
so you can sit here and do your shoes.

00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:44.610
Get rid of all your dust
on your shoes, very cool.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.143
And this is for your jacket,

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.810
get rid of all your stuff on the jacket.

00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:53.110
So while you're sitting down,
this is the entertainment.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.643
Shoeshine or jacket
shine, which one you like?

00:14:57.582 --> 00:15:00.558
- [Tower] Volga 2612,
stand one zero seven,

00:15:00.558 --> 00:15:03.322
push approved to face east.

00:15:03.322 --> 00:15:04.600
- [Crewman] Pushback
has now been approved,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.540
facing east, Volga 2612.

00:15:07.766 --> 00:15:10.433
(engines whine)

00:15:16.174 --> 00:15:18.424
Volga 2612 request startup.

00:15:20.291 --> 00:15:22.880
- [Tower] Volga 2612, start approved

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.272
and I have your clearance
when you're ready to copy.

00:15:25.272 --> 00:15:26.105
- [Crewman] Startup approved,

00:15:26.105 --> 00:15:29.930
and we are ready to copy
clearance, Volga 2612.

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:32.383
- [Tower] Volga 2612 cleared to Toulouse,

00:15:32.383 --> 00:15:33.917
that was a three November departure,

00:15:33.917 --> 00:15:36.490
squawk zero five seven seven.

00:15:36.490 --> 00:15:39.494
- [Crewman] Volga 2612 request taxi.

00:15:39.494 --> 00:15:42.500
- [Tower] Volga 2612, minimum power.

00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.816
Leave Gate One via
Foxtrot, taxi initially.

00:15:45.816 --> 00:15:48.706
Hold at point Alpha Seven
for Runway Two Seven.

00:15:48.706 --> 00:15:52.039
Tune into nine nine four hertz Brussels.

00:15:55.302 --> 00:15:57.969
(engines whine)

00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:05.970
- I was keeping these earplugs,

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.170
but who use earplugs if you're
an AvGeek on the Antonov?

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.423
The noiser, the better.

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:16.170
These guys were loading the plane.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.240
Now they're going back,
changing their shorts.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.040
It's like coming back home.

00:16:20.040 --> 00:16:22.140
This is like their second home in the sky.

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.910
- [Tower] Volga 2612,
behind the landing inbound

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.430
one four five via Alpha One.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:31.530
Line up and wait, Runway Two Seven behind.

00:16:32.695 --> 00:16:35.843
Volga 2612 in to report
ready for departure.

00:16:35.843 --> 00:16:37.041
- [Crewman] Calling in
ready for departure,

00:16:37.041 --> 00:16:37.958
Volga 2612.

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:42.708
(engines hum)

00:16:44.973 --> 00:16:48.390
(engine pitch increases)

00:16:50.417 --> 00:16:53.890
- This is a very typical
Antonov move on the runway.

00:16:53.890 --> 00:16:56.900
Start to rev up the engine slowly,

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.010
slowly accelerating about four minutes,

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.180
then we will go.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.500
And it's raining as
hell outside right now.

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.410
You can't see anything
here, you can only hear

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:08.320
the engine and the
vibration and the noise.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.280
- [Tower] Volga 2612, Runway Two Seven,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.982
clear to take off, wind one
eight two degrees, four knots.

00:17:14.982 --> 00:17:18.399
(engine pitch increases)

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:23.333
- Here we go!

00:17:29.081 --> 00:17:31.970
- [Tower] Now up on Entry
Two Seven, happy flying.

00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:35.803
(intercom chatter in Russian)

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:44.603
(engines roar)

00:17:49.712 --> 00:17:52.962
(energetic rock music)

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:08.860
- Crew is very tired
because they've been working

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:12.440
since 7 a.m., like eight hours of work.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.180
Now, you know, it's very warm in the cabin

00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.020
and it's better to take a nap.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:20.000
So it's really, really a weird experience

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.590
during the trip here
that there's no window,

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:24.660
you can't see, but you feel the boom

00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:27.340
and sometimes there's a
bit of shaking, turbulence,

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.220
up and down, a little bit vibration.

00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.213
You can think about it
as a Jumbo upper deck,

00:18:32.213 --> 00:18:35.440
a 747, pretty similar, this is quite cosy.

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.180
Or you can think about
even you're in a spaceship,

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.280
something, a military aeroplane.

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.700
I think my AvGeek really came out today.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.880
You can see I'm so much more excited

00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:47.190
when I'm seeing the plane
and flying the plane.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:49.110
I've been up since 5 a.m. this morning,

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:52.510
but now it's about 5 p.m., 12 hours later.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:55.010
(engines hum)

00:18:56.693 --> 00:18:59.943
(energetic rock music)

00:19:05.666 --> 00:19:07.650
We got mac and cheese,

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.143
sausage casserole, Cajun beef.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:16.770
This is the main course,
heated up in the oven.

00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:24.580
The food tastes pretty good
on Volga-Dnepr Airline.

00:19:32.752 --> 00:19:35.430
- [Tower] Volga 2612, bonsoir.

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:37.720
Continue descent, flight
level one four zero,

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.420
proceeding to north one eight two.

00:19:40.506 --> 00:19:42.650
Expect level of entering
ILS one four eight.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.383
- [Crewman] Expecting ILS
approach one four eight,

00:19:44.383 --> 00:19:46.960
descent at level one four zero,

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.877
Volga 2612.

00:19:51.097 --> 00:19:53.087
- It's coming down.

00:19:53.087 --> 00:19:55.670
(engines roar)

00:20:03.052 --> 00:20:05.302
(rumbling)

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.840
We just landed, that
landing was so smooth.

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.033
Although we're in a tube, we
can't see it, but I love it.

00:20:15.138 --> 00:20:17.020
It was feeling like raw aviation.

00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:20.030
This plane, designed in 1970s

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.710
when pollution was not a problem,

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:24.230
fuel barrels not a problem,
noise is not a problem.

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.470
It's just raw aviation,
incredible experience,

00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.900
I certainly just really, really enjoyed.

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:31.950
This made my day, or this made my year.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:33.100
Thumbs up.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:35.370
Vladimir, thank you for giving me

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.610
the Antonov 124 experience.

00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:40.230
I hope you guys keep
transporting heavy-lift cargo

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:43.350
and keep flying the
Antonov Ruslan in the sky.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.410
- Yeah, thank you very
much for your best wishes.

00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:46.585
Is our thank you.

00:20:46.585 --> 00:20:49.252
(engines whine)

00:20:51.147 --> 00:20:52.830
- We just arrived at Toulouse,

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:54.750
but the crew have to stay behind

00:20:54.750 --> 00:20:57.550
because they got to spend
hours offloading again.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.020
So my hat's off to the crew

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.940
for their dedication and hard work.

00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:03.820
If you asked me what's
flying on Antonov 124 like,

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.150
I'm going to tell you there's
nothing quite like it.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:07.510
It's incredible.

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:11.498
It reminds me why I love
about aviation so much.

00:21:11.498 --> 00:21:13.498
It's a great experience.

00:21:16.288 --> 00:21:18.371
(whoosh)

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.290
(ding)
(pop)
