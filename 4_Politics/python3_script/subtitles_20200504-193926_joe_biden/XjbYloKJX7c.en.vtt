00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.080
To, from, or through China, more than half
a billion passengers fly each year.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.630
By 2035, that number is expected to be 1.3
billion.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.650
It is one of the fastest growing aviation
markets in the world, is home to what is believed

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.160
to be the future busiest airport in the world,
and is expected to soon surpass the US to

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.160
become the single largest aviation market
in the world.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.690
Last year, a new aircraft was delivered to
a Chinese airline every 21 hours.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.989
That’s $35 billion worth of aircraft purchased
in a single year.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.890
All of this, however, represents a considerable
problem for the world’s largest aircraft

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:48.890
manufacturer—Boeing.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.199
You see, the reason China is a problem for
Boeing is also part of the reason why China

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.559
is already such an enormous market for them.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.829
While the US is resoundingly Boeing’s number
one customer, at least partially propped up

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.250
by government defense contracts, China safely
holds the number two spot.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.520
Excluding North America, China, in fact, singlehandedly
earns Boeing more money than every continent

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.520
in the world.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.060
Now, not only is China a fierce battle-ground
between Boeing and Airbus, even if Boeing

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.670
has a slight overall edge in market share,
but the company now also faces a trifecta

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.150
of issues potentially hindering its future
dominance in this ultimately crucial aviation

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.380
market.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.780
The first of these issues has to do with Boeing
brand new yet beleaguered airplane—the 737

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.810
MAX.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.270
Prior to the MAX’s grounding, China was,
by a wide margin, the largest operator of

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.500
this airplane.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.450
Its airlines had a total of 97 MAX’s while
US’ airlines, representing the second largest

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.700
customer group, only had a total of 72.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.290
This is an aircraft particularly well-suited
to China’s geography.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.890
With a number of smaller, secondary or tertiary
cities, China’s airlines are increasingly

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.310
focused on developing non-stop flights bypassing
the major hubs of Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.000
or fights to lower demand cities outside of
China.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.960
This is especially true given the huge number
of smaller airlines operating in China who

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.700
have established themselves by setting up
hubs in some of the country’s smaller cities

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.040
whose populations more recently started the
transition into the country’s middle and

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.109
upper classes than those of the country’s
tier one cities.

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.819
Of course, flying to or from these smaller
cities means lower demand for seats, however,

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.909
the longer-range, smaller-capacity capability
of the 737 MAX perfectly suits this mission.

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:31.060
That allowed Chinese airlines to set up, in
an economical manner, flights like Jinan to

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.209
Singapore, Guangzhou to Lahore, Ürümqi to
Bangkok, or Hangzhou to Hotan—all five or

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.180
six hours flights with minimal demand.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.469
The 737 MAX was an aircraft perfectly suited
for China and Boeing knew it.

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.519
This suitability and focus was demonstrated
by Boeing’s decision to set-up an aircraft

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.730
completion center in Zhoushan, China.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.680
While aircraft would continue to be primarily
assembled in Renton, Washington, they would

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.999
be flown over to Zhoushan without the interiors
completed.

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:01.120
In Zhoushan, their seats, overhead bins, and
basically the entire rest of their interiors

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.909
would be installed by Chinese workers in this
Chinese factory.

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.829
Having a ground presence in China would appease
the government, and by extension airlines,

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.239
and the hope was that this would help convince
them to buy Boeing jets considering that their

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.560
purchase provided Chinese jobs.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.550
This was especially necessary considering
that Airbus already had an even more extensive

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.599
final assembly line in the country for its
competing a320 jets.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.930
Given the MAX’s suitability, though, Chinese
airlines bought an enormous number of these

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:27.930
planes.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.319
In addition to the 97 already delivered, Chinese
airlines had almost 500 of them on order but

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.379
then, of course, the MAX crashed, and then
it crashed again.

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.580
China’s Civil Aviation Administration, eager
to maintain the country’s recent streak

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.409
of aviation safety, quickly grounded the MAX
after its second crash making China the first

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:47.689
country to do so.

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:52.730
This was a rather shocking move as historically,
every country’s aviation regulator more

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.370
or less just followed the lead of the American
FAA in these decisions.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.799
It was thought that, if the FAA said it was
safe, it was safe, an in this case, the FAA

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:06.389
initially asserted their confidence in Boeing’s
737 MAX and chose not to ground it immediately.

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.769
Now in the aftermath of this, the grounding
of the MAX has presented Beijing with three

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:11.769
gifts.

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.870
First, especially in the case of the state-owned
airlines and leasing companions, the Chinese

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.160
have a much stronger negotiating position
than before with Boeing as the company works

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.420
to regain the momentum it had before.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.940
Prices, which typically vary widely from airline
to airline and deal to deal, could end up

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.940
lower.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.840
Secondly, China’s three largest airlines,
which are all state-owned, are asking Boeing

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.680
for compensation for the grounding of their
jets.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.919
By extension, this is essentially the Chinese
government, the very one that holds the keys

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.120
to the Chinese aviation market, asking Boeing
for compensation and, if Boeing doesn’t

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.280
comply in what is possibly largely a symbolic
move, the Chinese government could decide

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.400
to reduce future Boeing orders, potentially
in favor of Airbus.

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.120
While Boeing is seemingly setting itself up
to offer compensation to airlines affected

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.560
by the MAX’s grounding, whatever it gives
to the Chinese airlines, however favorable

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.240
the company is with them, they will have to
match this precedent for their compensation

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.280
with every other of the world’s affected
airlines.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.960
What could end up the most formidable MAX
challenge, though, is that the Chinese aviation

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.069
regulator has now established itself as a
leader.

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:19.310
It was them who made that first decision to
ground the jet that started the domino effect

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.500
of other national regulators grounding the
MAX.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.660
Considering China’s regulator now successfully
flexed their muscle in this space, the American

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:30.690
FAA, which has deep links to Boeing and has
allowed Boeing to essentially self-certify

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.750
certain aspects of their new aircraft, has
lost some prowess in its role as, in a sense,

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.680
“the world’s aviation regulator.”

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.379
Therefore, not only will China’s regulator
likely take a more independent route in re-certifying

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.069
the MAX once its issues are resolved, it will
also possibly feel free to make its own independent

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:50.259
decisions on the airworthiness of future aircraft.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:53.180
This is a precedent that should have Boeing
concerned.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.050
Now, a smaller but significant second issue
for Boeing is the ongoing trade-war between

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.190
the US and China.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.860
While Boeing has not yet encountered clear
implications from this trade-war, some speculate

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.000
that the company could be used as a pawn.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.770
You see, China’s three largest airlines—China
Southern, China Eastern, and Air China—are

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.909
all majority government owned and therefore
their orders can be used as a sort of political

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:15.909
tool.

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:19.810
To date, these three airlines’ fleets are
slightly weighted towards Airbus planes, despite

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.330
the country’s airlines as a whole on average
having a slight preference towards Boeing,

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.349
but they still do operate a significant number
of Boeing planes.

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:31.680
While Boeing is not, of course, a state-owned
company, they are the US’ largest exporter

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.760
and a major American employer and therefore
the US government and Department of Commerce

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.699
works hard to prop them up.

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:42.180
As the largest international market for Boeing,
China has the keys to either help or hurt

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.650
America’s economy through how many planes
it decides to order.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.530
In the height of the US-China trade war, in
March, 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:56.600
announced a massive $35 billion order of 300
Airbus aircraft by China’s state-owned aircraft

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.600
leasing company.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:01.849
While you can never know for sure, this certainly
was viewed as a move at least partially intended

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:04.180
to send a message to the US.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:09.180
Meanwhile, since the beginning of the trade-war,
there has been a noticeable lack of significant

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:11.790
Boeing aircraft orders by Chinese airlines.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.669
These, however, are most all fairly short-term
threats.

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:19.970
The trade-war will pass, the 737 MAX will
take the skies again, but what is perhaps

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.750
Boeing’s largest problem is still to come.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.380
Their largest threat is that China is building
their very own plane.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.680
It’s being built by the Commercial Aircraft
Corporation of China or COMAC.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.380
Now, to recap, in the commercial jet aircraft
manufacturing space, there’s of course Boeing

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.439
and Airbus, then there’s Embraer, which
is in a joint venture with Boeing, and Bombardier,

00:07:39.439 --> 00:07:41.900
who’s flagship C-series program was bought
by Airbus.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.569
Therefore, Boeing and Airbus control an enormous
majority of the industry.

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:51.120
Aside from that, the only major unaligned
aircraft series is the Bombardier CRJ regional

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.650
jet who’s manufacturing rights are in the
process of being bought by Mitsubishi.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.300
There’s then the Russian United Aircraft
Corporation producing a small number of Ilyushin,

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.349
Tupolev, and Sukhoi jets and an even smaller
number of commercial jets produced the the

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:05.210
Ukrainian Antonov company.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:08.719
These Russian and Ukrainian aircraft tend
to mostly be bought and operated by Russian

00:08:08.719 --> 00:08:13.740
and Ukrainian airlines, so, in terms of global
aircraft competition against Boeing and Airbus

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.499
there really is none.

00:08:15.499 --> 00:08:17.210
It is the textbook duopoly.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.229
COMAC, however, could break that.

00:08:20.229 --> 00:08:24.610
It may surprise some to hear that there are
already COMAC aircraft flying in China’s

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.610
skies—the ARJ21.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:31.550
This small, 78 passenger jet was COMAC’s
first significant foray into commercial aircraft

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:35.750
manufacturing and it has been, to put it bluntly,
a disaster.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:41.200
When it was first announced in 2002, the aircraft
was supposed to take the skies in 2005.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:46.190
In reality, though, the first prototype wasn’t
completed until 2007, the first test-flight

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:51.630
didn’t happen until 2008, and then after
delay upon delay upon delay, the first commercial

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.630
flight didn’t happen until 2016.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.720
Since then, the issues have not let up.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.910
The aircraft was plagued with reliability
and capability issues and, to date, only fourteen

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:03.600
are in commercial service.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.480
Now, it would be quite reasonable to question
why this aircraft could threaten Boeing especially

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.640
considering that Boeing doesn’t even develop
an aircraft in a similar size to the ARJ21.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.560
The answer is that it doesn’t.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:21.649
The aircraft that should make Boeing nervous
is this—the Comac C919.

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:25.860
Worth noting is that Boeing is actually in
a joint venture with COMAC for its final-delivery

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:30.000
plant in Zhoushan, but that certainly doesn’t
stop the companies from competing.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.089
Just by looking at this plane you can tell
it’s built to compete directly with Airbus’

00:09:34.089 --> 00:09:36.279
a320 and Boeing’s 737.

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:40.490
It’s designed to carry pretty much the exact
same number of passengers and it even uses

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:47.250
the same engines at the a320neo and 737 MAX,
but let’s be clear, the c919 is not the

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.870
a320 or 737.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:54.260
It’s a brand new aircraft by a brand-new
aircraft manufacturer and it’s abnormal

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.810
for even Airbus or Boeing’s new aircraft
introductions to go smoothly.

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.180
Designing aircraft is difficult.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.810
The c919 is still in its testing phase so
its true performance and reliability statistics

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:11.160
are not yet verifiably known, however, in
all honesty, the success of this plane has

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.790
less to do with its actual capability than
probably any other plane in the world.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:21.269
The success of this plane has to do with whether
the Chinese government decides it will be

00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:22.540
successful.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:28.079
Of China’s eight largest airlines, just
one, Hainan Airlines, is not government owned.

00:10:28.079 --> 00:10:33.149
China’s government holds the keys to hundreds
or thousands of aircraft orders—why would

00:10:33.149 --> 00:10:35.970
it order from anyone but itself?

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:40.940
Unsurprisingly, quite a few of the C919’s
orders to date have come from Chinese state-owned

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.110
airlines and aircraft leasing companies.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.029
Its only non-Chinese order came from GE’s
aircraft leasing division—possibly as a

00:10:47.029 --> 00:10:51.270
vote of confidence considering the C919 uses
GE engines.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:56.370
The real test on whether the C919 is actually
a good plane will come once it enters commercial

00:10:56.370 --> 00:11:00.920
service, its reliability and capability is
exhibited to the world, and foreign airlines

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.290
consider whether they want to order it.

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.420
With China’s expertise in low-cost, high-tech
manufacturing, it could possibly prove a low-cost

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:14.529
alternative to the a320 or 737 which has had
some airlines intrigued—most visibly Ryanair

00:11:14.529 --> 00:11:19.380
who’s CEO said he would be seriously interested
in the aircraft if a 200 seat variant was

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.380
developed.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:24.250
China also has increasing geopolitical power,
especially in pockets of Africa which also

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:28.519
have fast developing aviation markets, and
this could translate to a number of politically

00:11:28.519 --> 00:11:32.260
aligned countries choosing to buy and operate
COMAC planes.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.790
Overall, the real challenge to Boeing is the
opportunity.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.209
If they miss the opportunity to become a dominant
player in the world’s future largest aviation

00:11:40.209 --> 00:11:45.150
market, they could have trouble maintaining
their position as the world’s largest aircraft

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:46.150
manufacturer.

00:11:46.150 --> 00:11:50.110
Being number one means that staying number
one is the expectation, not the goal, and

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:55.970
so the Chinese market, while it is an opportunity,
is also a requirement.

00:11:55.970 --> 00:12:00.500
Now, in a similar vein, anyone who’s been
number one in anything knows that staying

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.550
there requires continuous improvement.

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.279
That means that no matter if you’re at the
beginning of your career or if you’re already

00:12:06.279 --> 00:12:09.170
at the top, you know that you should be constantly
improving yourself.

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:13.670
Part of the way that I make sure I’m always
doing that is by using Skillshare.

00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:17.970
Their courses are a great way to quickly and
simply learn new skills.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.750
For example, for anyone that has to do presentations,
whether it be at school or work, I’d highly

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:27.170
recommend the Skillshare original called,
“Presentation Essentials: How to Share Ideas

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:28.820
That Inspire Action.”

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.029
Presentation seems like a simple thing, but
there are actually so many nuances to it that

00:12:33.029 --> 00:12:37.190
can really make the difference between an
ineffective and effective presentation.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:41.720
This is just one of the more than 25,000 classes
you can take with Skillshare, all of which

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:47.760
you can access for free for two months by
signing up at skl.sh/wendover7 and then, after

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.199
that, their annual pricing works out to less
than $10 a month.
