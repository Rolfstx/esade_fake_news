00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.769
The President: Thank you.

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:03.970
Everybody, please
have a seat.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:06.439
We've got some
work to do here.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.807
(laughter)

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:11.344
This is not all
fun and games.

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:14.247
Welcome to the White
House, everybody.

00:00:14.247 --> 00:00:18.985
Today, we celebrate
extraordinary Americans who

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:27.026
have lifted our spirits,
strengthened our union,

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:29.996
pushed us toward progress.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:35.535
I always love doing this
event, but this is a

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:38.905
particularly
impressive class.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:44.611
We've got innovators
and artists.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:48.748
Public servants, rabble
rousers, athletes, renowned

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.157
character actors -- like
the guy from Space Jam.

00:00:57.157 --> 00:00:59.192
(laughter)

00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:14.340
We pay tribute to those
distinguished individuals

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.044
with our nation's highest
civilian honor -- the

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:20.947
Presidential
Medal of Freedom.

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:23.450
Now, let me tell you a
little bit about each of them.

00:01:25.585 --> 00:01:28.288
First, we came close to
missing out on Bill and

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:32.459
Melinda Gates'
incredible partnership.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:35.762
Because apparently Bill's
opening line was, "Do you

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.865
want to go out two weeks
from this coming Saturday?"

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:40.867
(laughter)

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.643
He's good with
computers, but --

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.979
(laughter)

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.749
Fortunately, Melinda
believes in second chances.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.651
And the world is
better for it.

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:02.222
For two decades, the Gates
Foundation has worked to

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:06.793
provide lifesaving medical
care to millions -- boosting

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:09.562
clean water supplies,
improving education for our

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:13.800
children, rallying
aggressive international

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.872
action on climate change,
cutting childhood mortality

00:02:18.872 --> 00:02:20.206
in half.

00:02:20.206 --> 00:02:22.008
The list could go on.

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:25.245
These two have donated more
money to charitable causes

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:27.247
than anyone, ever.

00:02:28.548 --> 00:02:31.751
Many years ago, Melinda's
mom told her an old saying:

00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:35.622
"To know that even one life
has breathed easier because

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:39.692
you lived -- that is
success." By this and just

00:02:39.692 --> 00:02:43.396
about any other measure, few
in human history have been

00:02:43.396 --> 00:02:50.203
more successful than these
two impatient optimists.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:54.173
Frank Gehry has never let
popular acclaim reverse his

00:02:54.173 --> 00:02:57.710
impulse to defy convention.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.180
"I was an outsider from the
beginning," he says, "so for

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.553
better or worse, I thrived
on it." The child of poor

00:03:06.553 --> 00:03:09.689
Jewish immigrants, Frank
grew up in Los Angeles, and

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:11.724
throughout his life he
embraced the spirit of a

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:14.961
city defined by
an open horizon.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:17.263
He's spent his life
rethinking shapes and

00:03:17.263 --> 00:03:23.369
mediums, seemingly the force
of gravity itself; the idea

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:28.074
of what architecture could
be he decided to upend --

00:03:28.074 --> 00:03:30.643
constantly repurposing every
material available, from

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:34.714
titanium to a
paper towel tube.

00:03:34.714 --> 00:03:36.883
He's inspiring our next
generation through his

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:40.286
advocacy for arts
education in our schools.

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:44.190
From the Guggenheim, to
Bilbao, to Chicago's

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.393
Millennium Park -- our
hometown -- to his home in

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:50.163
Santa Monica, which I
understand caused some

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:51.364
consternation among
his neighbors --

00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:52.799
(laughter)

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.035
- Frank's work teaches us
that while buildings may be

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:58.371
sturdy and fixed to the
ground, like all great art,

00:03:58.371 --> 00:03:59.539
they can lift our spirits.

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:03.843
They can soar and
broaden our horizons.

00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:07.313
When an undergraduate from
rural Appalachia first set

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:09.983
foot on the National Mall
many years ago, she was

00:04:09.983 --> 00:04:13.753
trying to figure out a way
to show that "war is not

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:16.789
just a victory or a loss,"
but "about individual

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:20.660
lives." She considered how
the landscape might shape

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.364
that message, rather than
the other way around.

00:04:24.364 --> 00:04:26.699
The project that Maya Lin
designed for her college

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.735
class earned her a B+ --

00:04:28.735 --> 00:04:30.570
(laughter)

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.872
-- and a permanent place
in American history.

00:04:32.872 --> 00:04:35.308
(laughter)

00:04:35.308 --> 00:04:39.312
So all of you B+
students out there.

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:42.081
(laughter)

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.884
The Vietnam Veterans
Memorial has changed the way

00:04:44.884 --> 00:04:48.554
we think about monuments,
but also about how we think

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:53.226
about sacrifice, and
patriotism, and ourselves.

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:55.895
Maya has given us more than
just places for remembering

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:58.398
-- she has created places
for us to make new memories.

00:04:58.398 --> 00:05:03.369
Her sculptures, chapels, and
homes are "physical act[s]

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:06.039
of poetry," each reminding
us that the most important

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.841
element in art or
architecture is human emotion.

00:05:11.444 --> 00:05:14.080
Three minutes before
Armstrong and Aldrin touched

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.984
down on the moon, Apollo
11's lunar lander alarms

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:22.455
triggered -- red and yellow
lights across the board.

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:24.424
Our astronauts didn't
have much time.

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:27.627
But thankfully, they
had Margaret Hamilton.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:32.532
A young MIT scientist -- and
a working mom in the '60s --

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:35.201
Margaret led the team that
created the onboard flight

00:05:35.201 --> 00:05:38.538
software that allowed the
Eagle to land safely.

00:05:38.538 --> 00:05:40.740
And keep in mind that,
at this time, software

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.042
engineering wasn't
even a field yet.

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:45.812
There were no textbooks to
follow, so, as Margaret

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:50.550
says, "There was no choice
but to be pioneers."

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.685
Luckily for us, Margaret
never stopped pioneering.

00:05:52.685 --> 00:05:57.256
And she symbolizes the
generation of unsung women

00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:00.693
who helped send
humankind into space.

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:03.863
Her software architecture
echoes in countless

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:05.732
technologies today.

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:07.900
And her example speaks of
the American spirit of

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.003
discovery that exists in
every little girl and little

00:06:11.003 --> 00:06:14.574
boy who know that somehow,
to look beyond the heavens

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:16.843
is to look deep within
ourselves -- and to figure

00:06:16.843 --> 00:06:19.779
out just what is possible.

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:24.250
If Wright is flight and
Edison is light, then Hopper

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:26.853
is code.

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:32.225
Born in 1906, Rear Admiral
Grace Murray Hopper followed

00:06:32.225 --> 00:06:36.729
her mother into mathematics,
earned her PhD from Yale,

00:06:36.729 --> 00:06:39.832
and set out on a long
and storied career.

00:06:39.832 --> 00:06:43.836
At age 37, and a full 15
pounds below military

00:06:43.836 --> 00:06:47.807
guidelines, the gutsy and
colorful Grace joined the

00:06:47.807 --> 00:06:52.111
Navy and was sent to work on
one of the first computers,

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:55.915
Harvard's "Mark One." She
saw beyond the boundaries of

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:58.885
the possible, and invented
the first compiler, which

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:01.554
allowed programs to be
written in regular language

00:07:01.554 --> 00:07:04.924
and then translated for
computers to understand.

00:07:04.924 --> 00:07:07.593
While the women who
pioneered software were

00:07:07.593 --> 00:07:10.930
often overlooked, the most
prestigious award for young

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.500
computer scientists
now bear her name.

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:17.870
From cell phones to cyber
command, we can thank Grace

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.606
Hopper for opening
programming to millions more

00:07:20.606 --> 00:07:24.443
people, helping to usher
in the information age and

00:07:24.443 --> 00:07:29.582
profoundly shaping
our digital world.

00:07:29.582 --> 00:07:30.616
Speaking of really
smart people --

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.385
(laughter)

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:35.188
-- in the summer of 1950, a
young University of Chicago

00:07:35.188 --> 00:07:36.823
physicist found himself

00:07:36.823 --> 00:07:40.326
at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:42.728
Dick Garwin was there, he
said, because Chicago paid

00:07:42.728 --> 00:07:48.868
its faculty for nine months
but his family ate for 12.

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:51.537
So by the next summer,
Dick had helped create the

00:07:51.537 --> 00:07:53.072
hydrogen bomb.

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:56.042
And for the rest of his
life, he dedicated himself

00:07:56.042 --> 00:07:59.245
to reducing the
threat of nuclear war.

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:02.281
Dick's not only an architect
of the atomic age.

00:08:02.281 --> 00:08:04.784
Ever since he was a
Cleveland kid tinkering with

00:08:04.784 --> 00:08:07.286
his father's movie
projectors, he's never met a

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.422
problem he didn't
want to solve.

00:08:09.422 --> 00:08:14.994
Reconnaissance satellites,
the MRI, GPS technology, the

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:19.198
touchscreen all bear
his fingerprints.

00:08:19.198 --> 00:08:22.869
He even patented a "mussel
washer" for shellfish --

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:26.639
which I haven't used.

00:08:26.639 --> 00:08:27.707
The other stuff I have.

00:08:27.707 --> 00:08:34.180
(laughter)

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:38.317
Where is he?

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:40.453
Dick has advised nearly
every President since

00:08:40.453 --> 00:08:43.422
Eisenhower -- often
rather bluntly.

00:08:43.422 --> 00:08:46.759
Enrico Fermi -- also a
pretty smart guy himself --

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:48.794
is said to have called Dick
"the only true genius" he

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.563
ever met.

00:08:50.563 --> 00:08:52.665
I do want to see
this mussel washer.

00:08:52.665 --> 00:08:55.935
(laughter)

00:08:55.935 --> 00:08:58.437
Along with these scientists,
artists, and thinkers, we

00:08:58.437 --> 00:09:00.673
also honor those who have
shaped our culture from the

00:09:00.673 --> 00:09:02.708
stage and the screen.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:06.879
In her long and
extraordinary career, Cicely

00:09:06.879 --> 00:09:09.382
Tyson has not only succeeded
as an actor, she has shaped

00:09:09.382 --> 00:09:11.717
the whole course history.

00:09:11.717 --> 00:09:15.321
Cicely was never the
likeliest of Hollywood stars.

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:17.556
The daughter of immigrants
from the West Indies, she

00:09:17.556 --> 00:09:20.426
was raised by a hardworking
and religious mother who

00:09:20.426 --> 00:09:23.729
cleaned houses and forbade
her children to attend

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:25.097
the movies.

00:09:25.097 --> 00:09:27.099
But once she got her
education and broke into the

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:30.336
business, Cicely made a
conscious decision not just

00:09:30.336 --> 00:09:32.471
to say lines,
but to speak out.

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:34.473
"I would not accept roles,"
she said, "unless they

00:09:34.473 --> 00:09:38.311
projected us, particularly
women, in a realistic light,

00:09:38.311 --> 00:09:41.814
[and] dealt with us as human
beings." And from "Sounder,"

00:09:41.814 --> 00:09:45.785
to "The Trip to Bountiful,"
to "The Autobiography of

00:09:45.785 --> 00:09:48.955
Miss Jane Pittman," Cicely's
convictions and grace have

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:53.459
helped for us see the
dignity of every single

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.461
beautiful member of
the American family.

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.129
And she's just gorgeous.

00:09:57.129 --> 00:10:02.835
(laughter and applause)

00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:06.839
Yes, she is.

00:10:06.839 --> 00:10:12.311
In 1973, a critic wrote of
Robert De Niro, "This kid

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:17.416
doesn't just act -- he takes
off into the vapors." And it

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:20.653
was true, his
characters are iconic.

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:25.224
A Sicilian father
turned New York mobster.

00:10:25.224 --> 00:10:27.793
A mobster who runs a casino.

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:29.195
A mobster who needs therapy.

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:32.999
(laughter)

00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.000
A father-in-law who is
scarier than a mobster.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.068
(laughter)

00:10:36.068 --> 00:10:38.237
Al Capone -- a mobster.

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:43.976
(laughter)

00:10:43.976 --> 00:10:48.247
Robert combines dramatic
precision and, it turns out,

00:10:48.247 --> 00:10:52.151
comedic timing with his
signature eye for detail.

00:10:52.151 --> 00:10:55.287
And while the name De Niro
is synonymous with "tough

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:58.090
guy," his true gift is the
sensitivity that he brings

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.658
to each role.

00:10:59.658 --> 00:11:02.061
This son of New York artists
didn't stop at becoming one

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:04.196
of the world's
greatest actors.

00:11:04.196 --> 00:11:07.066
He's also a director, a
philanthropist, co-founder

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:09.435
of the Tribeca
Film Festival.

00:11:09.435 --> 00:11:11.670
Of his tireless preparation
-- from learning the

00:11:11.670 --> 00:11:16.208
saxophone to remaking his
body -- he once said, "I

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:19.912
feel I have to earn the
right to play a part." And

00:11:19.912 --> 00:11:23.783
the result is honest and
authentic art that reveals

00:11:23.783 --> 00:11:25.751
who we really are.

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:30.356
In 1976, Lorne Michaels
implored the Beatles to

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:32.091
reunite on his
brand new show.

00:11:32.091 --> 00:11:36.228
In exchange, he
offered them $3,000.

00:11:36.228 --> 00:11:37.229
(laughter)

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:42.234
And then he told them they
could share it equally, or

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:46.405
they could give
Ringo a smaller cut.

00:11:46.405 --> 00:11:48.974
(laughter)

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:51.243
Which was early proof that
Lorne Michaels has a good

00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:53.412
sense of humor.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:56.515
On Saturday Night Live, he's
created a world where a band

00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:59.885
of no-names become
comedy's biggest stars.

00:11:59.885 --> 00:12:02.922
Where our friends the
Coneheads, and cheerleaders,

00:12:02.922 --> 00:12:05.991
and land sharks, and
basement deadbeats, and

00:12:05.991 --> 00:12:10.863
motivational speakers, and
an unfrozen caveman lawyer

00:12:10.863 --> 00:12:15.000
show up, and Tom Hanks
is on "Black Jeopardy."

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:25.010
(laughter)

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:30.649
After four decades, even in
this fractured media culture

00:12:30.649 --> 00:12:34.286
that we've got, SNL remains
appointment viewing; a

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:38.357
mainline into not just our
counterculture but our

00:12:38.357 --> 00:12:43.662
culture; still a challenge
to the powerful, especially

00:12:43.662 --> 00:12:45.664
folks like me.

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:49.301
And yet even after all these
years, Lorne jokes that his

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:52.838
tombstone should bear just
a single word that's often

00:12:52.838 --> 00:13:01.113
found in the show's
reviews -- "uneven."

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:04.850
(laughter)

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:06.352
As a current U.S. Senator

00:13:06.352 --> 00:13:08.854
would say: Doggone
it, Lorne - that's why

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:11.991
people like you.

00:13:11.991 --> 00:13:17.096
He produced a Senator, too,
that's pretty impressive.

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:21.066
Ellen DeGeneres has a way
of making you laugh about

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:25.538
something rather
than at someone.

00:13:25.538 --> 00:13:27.673
Except when I danced on her
show -- she laughed at me.

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:29.308
(laughter)

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:31.277
But that's okay.

00:13:31.277 --> 00:13:36.649
It's easy to forget now,
when we've come so far,

00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:41.754
where now marriage is equal
under the law -- just how

00:13:41.754 --> 00:13:46.091
much courage was required
for Ellen to come out on the

00:13:46.091 --> 00:13:50.963
most public of stages
almost 20 years ago.

00:13:50.963 --> 00:13:54.233
Just how important it
was not just to the LGBT

00:13:54.233 --> 00:13:57.336
community, but for all of us
to see somebody so full of

00:13:57.336 --> 00:14:01.173
kindness and light, somebody
we liked so much, somebody

00:14:01.173 --> 00:14:05.611
who could be our neighbor or
our colleague or our sister

00:14:05.611 --> 00:14:08.681
challenge our own
assumptions, remind us that

00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:11.917
we have more in common than
we realize, push our country

00:14:11.917 --> 00:14:14.687
in the direction of justice.

00:14:14.687 --> 00:14:17.456
What an incredible
burden that was to bear.

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:18.924
To risk your
career like that.

00:14:18.924 --> 00:14:21.794
People don't do
that very often.

00:14:21.794 --> 00:14:24.029
And then to have the
hopes of millions on

00:14:24.029 --> 00:14:26.732
your shoulders.

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:30.135
But it's like Ellen says:
W all want a tortilla chip

00:14:30.135 --> 00:14:32.137
that can support the
weight of guacamole.

00:14:35.007 --> 00:14:39.878
Which really makes no sense
to me, but I thought would

00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:44.083
brighten the mood, because I
was getting kind of choked up.

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:52.057
(laughter)

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:56.128
And she did pay a price --
we don't remember this.

00:14:56.128 --> 00:14:58.063
I hadn't remembered it.

00:14:58.063 --> 00:15:02.868
She did, for a pretty long
stretch of time --

00:15:02.868 --> 00:15:06.438
even in Hollywood.

00:15:06.438 --> 00:15:11.443
And yet, today, every day,
in every way, Ellen counters

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:18.217
what too often divides us
with the countless things

00:15:18.217 --> 00:15:21.520
that bind us together --
inspires us to be better,

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.522
one joke, one
dance at a time.

00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:31.797
When The Candidate wins his
race in the iconic 1972 film

00:15:31.797 --> 00:15:34.633
of the same name, which
continues, by the way, for

00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:37.202
those of you who haven't
seen it, and many of you are

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:42.174
too young -- perhaps the
best movie about what

00:15:42.174 --> 00:15:46.211
politics is
actually like, ever.

00:15:46.211 --> 00:15:49.581
He famously asks his
campaign manager the

00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:52.885
reflective and revealing
question: "What do we do now?"

00:15:54.953 --> 00:15:57.056
And like the man he played
in that movie, Robert

00:15:57.056 --> 00:16:02.194
Redford has figured it out
and applied his talent and

00:16:02.194 --> 00:16:05.264
charm to achieve success.

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:08.901
We admire Bob not just for
his remarkable acting, but

00:16:08.901 --> 00:16:12.304
for having figured
out what to do next.

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.807
He created a platform for
independent filmmakers with

00:16:14.807 --> 00:16:17.309
the Sundance Institute.

00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:19.411
He has supported our
National Parks and our

00:16:19.411 --> 00:16:22.781
natural resources as
one of the foremost

00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:25.451
conservationists
of our generation.

00:16:25.451 --> 00:16:27.853
He's given his unmatched
charisma to unforgettable

00:16:27.853 --> 00:16:31.523
characters like Roy Hobbs,
Nathan Muir, and of course

00:16:31.523 --> 00:16:34.193
the Sundance Kid,
entertaining us for more

00:16:34.193 --> 00:16:35.828
than half a century.

00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.664
As an actor, director,
producer, and as an

00:16:38.664 --> 00:16:42.701
advocate, he has not stopped
-- and apparently drives so

00:16:42.701 --> 00:16:45.637
fast that he had breakfast
in Napa and dinner in Salt Lake.

00:16:45.637 --> 00:16:46.638
(laughter)

00:16:46.638 --> 00:16:50.976
At 80 years young, Robert
Redford has no plans

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.978
to slow down.

00:16:54.146 --> 00:16:56.248
According to a recent
headline, the movie, Sully

00:16:56.248 --> 00:16:57.616
was the last straw.

00:16:57.616 --> 00:16:59.885
We should never
travel with Tom Hanks.

00:16:59.885 --> 00:17:01.453
(laughter)

00:17:01.453 --> 00:17:05.324
I mean, you think about, you
got pirates, plane crashes,

00:17:05.324 --> 00:17:11.797
you get marooned in airport
purgatory, volcanoes --

00:17:11.797 --> 00:17:14.166
something happens
with Tom Hanks.

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.667
(laughter)

00:17:15.667 --> 00:17:19.538
And yet somehow, we can't
resist going where he wants

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.106
to take us.

00:17:21.106 --> 00:17:23.876
He's been an accidental
witness to history, a crusty

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:28.947
women's baseball manager, an
everyman who fell in love

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:30.649
with Meg Ryan three times.

00:17:30.649 --> 00:17:33.118
(laughter)

00:17:33.118 --> 00:17:36.088
Made it seem natural to have
a volleyball as your

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:37.089
best friend.

00:17:37.089 --> 00:17:41.059
From a Philadelphia
courtroom, to Normandy's

00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:43.962
beachheads, to the dark
side of the moon, he has

00:17:43.962 --> 00:17:48.700
introduced us to America's
unassuming heroes.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:51.036
Tom says he just saw
"ordinary guys who did the

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:53.505
right thing at the right
time." Well, it takes one to

00:17:53.505 --> 00:17:57.276
know one, and "America's
Dad" has stood up to cancer

00:17:57.276 --> 00:17:58.544
with his beloved wife, Rita.

00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:01.780
He has championed our
veterans, supported space

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.983
exploration, and the truth
is, Tom has always saved his

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:07.319
best roles for real life.

00:18:07.319 --> 00:18:10.656
He is a good man -- which is
the best title you can have.

00:18:12.658 --> 00:18:16.628
So we got innovators,
entertainers -- three more

00:18:16.628 --> 00:18:21.567
folks who've dedicated
themselves to public service.

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:24.870
In the early 1960s,
thousands of Cuban children

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:27.206
fled to America, seeking an
education they'd never get

00:18:27.206 --> 00:18:28.974
back home.

00:18:28.974 --> 00:18:32.077
And one refugee was
15-year-old named Eduardo

00:18:32.077 --> 00:18:36.114
Padron, whose life changed
when he enrolled at Miami

00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:37.983
Dade College.

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:40.252
That decision led to a
bachelor's degree, then a

00:18:40.252 --> 00:18:43.522
Master's degree, then a PhD,
and then he had a choice --

00:18:43.522 --> 00:18:45.524
he could go into corporate
America, or he could give

00:18:45.524 --> 00:18:47.226
back to his alma mater.

00:18:47.226 --> 00:18:49.962
And Eduardo made his choice
-- to create more stories

00:18:49.962 --> 00:18:52.097
just like his.

00:18:52.097 --> 00:18:56.635
As Miami Dade's President
since 1995, Dr. Padron has

00:18:56.635 --> 00:18:59.438
built a "dream factory" for
one of our nation's most

00:18:59.438 --> 00:19:04.109
diverse student bodies --
165,000 students in all.

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:08.313
He's one of the world's
preeminent education leaders

00:19:08.313 --> 00:19:10.682
-- thinking out of the
box, supporting students

00:19:10.682 --> 00:19:13.852
throughout their lives,
embodying the belief that

00:19:13.852 --> 00:19:17.856
we're only as great
as the doors we open.

00:19:17.856 --> 00:19:21.126
Eduardo's example is one we
all can follow -- a champion

00:19:21.126 --> 00:19:23.896
for those who strive for the
same American Dream that

00:19:23.896 --> 00:19:25.898
first drew him
to our shores.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.671
When Elouise Cobell first
filed a lawsuit to recover

00:19:32.671 --> 00:19:35.007
lands and money for her
people, she didn't set out

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:36.008
to be a hero.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:38.076
She said, "I just
wanted...to give justice to

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:43.916
people that didn't have it."
And her lifelong quest to

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:47.953
address the mismanagement
of American Indian lands,

00:19:47.953 --> 00:19:50.856
resources, and trust funds
wasn't about special

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:53.125
treatment, but the equal
treatment at the heart of

00:19:53.125 --> 00:19:54.893
the American promise.

00:19:54.893 --> 00:19:56.962
She fought for almost 15
years -- across three

00:19:56.962 --> 00:20:00.899
Presidents, seven trials, 10
appearances before a federal

00:20:00.899 --> 00:20:02.034
appeals court.

00:20:02.034 --> 00:20:05.270
All the while, she traveled
the country some 40 weeks a

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.240
year, telling the
story of her people.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.475
And in the end, this
graduate of a one-room

00:20:10.475 --> 00:20:13.712
schoolhouse became
a MacArthur Genius.

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:17.583
She is a proud daughter of
Montana's Blackfeet Nation.

00:20:19.585 --> 00:20:22.554
Reached ultimately a
historic victory for all

00:20:22.554 --> 00:20:24.756
Native Americans.

00:20:24.756 --> 00:20:28.026
Through sheer force of will
and a belief that the truth

00:20:28.026 --> 00:20:31.997
will win out, Elouise Cobell
overcame the longest odds,

00:20:31.997 --> 00:20:35.000
reminding us that fighting
for what is right is always

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.635
worth it.

00:20:36.635 --> 00:20:41.440
Now, every journalist in the
room, every media critic

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.376
knows the phrase Newt
Minow coined: the "vast

00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:48.580
wasteland." But the two
words Newt prefers we

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:51.283
remember from his speech to
the nation's broadcasters

00:20:51.283 --> 00:20:55.454
are these: "public
interest." That's been the

00:20:55.454 --> 00:20:59.391
heartbeat of his life's work
-- advocating for residents

00:20:59.391 --> 00:21:02.260
of public housing, advising
a governor and Supreme Court

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.697
justice, cementing
presidential debates as our

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:09.701
national institution,
leading the FCC.

00:21:09.701 --> 00:21:11.870
When Newt helped launch
the first communications

00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:14.239
satellites, making
nationwide broadcasts

00:21:14.239 --> 00:21:17.676
possible -- and eventually
GPS possible and cellphones

00:21:17.676 --> 00:21:20.445
possible -- he predicted it
would be more important than

00:21:20.445 --> 00:21:21.980
the moon landing.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.350
"This will launch ideas into
space," he said, "and ideas

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:29.888
last longer than people." As
far as I know, he's the only

00:21:29.888 --> 00:21:33.892
one of today's honorees who
was present on my first date

00:21:33.892 --> 00:21:34.626
with Michelle.

00:21:34.626 --> 00:21:38.964
(laughter)

00:21:38.964 --> 00:21:42.467
Imagine our surprise when we
saw Newt, one of our bosses

00:21:42.467 --> 00:21:50.342
that summer, at the movie
theater -- Do the Right Thing.

00:21:50.342 --> 00:21:52.511
So he's been vital to
my personal interests.

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:55.380
(laughter)

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.783
And finally, we honor five
of the all-time greats in

00:21:57.783 --> 00:21:59.785
sports and music.

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:04.690
The game of baseball has a
handful of signature sounds.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:07.693
You hear the
crack of the bat.

00:22:07.693 --> 00:22:11.730
You got the crowd singing in
the seventh inning stretch.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.701
And you've got the
voice of Vin Scully.

00:22:15.701 --> 00:22:18.603
Most fans listen to a game's
broadcast when they can't be

00:22:18.603 --> 00:22:19.705
at the ballpark.

00:22:19.705 --> 00:22:22.674
Generations of Dodger fans
brought their radios into

00:22:22.674 --> 00:22:26.078
the stands because you
didn't want to miss one of

00:22:26.078 --> 00:22:28.714
Vin's stories.

00:22:28.714 --> 00:22:31.283
Most play-by-play announcers
partner with an analyst in

00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:34.086
the booth to chat
about the action.

00:22:34.086 --> 00:22:39.925
Vin worked alone and
talked just with us.

00:22:39.925 --> 00:22:45.163
Since Jackie Robinson
started at second base, Vin

00:22:45.163 --> 00:22:49.267
taught us the game and
introduced us to its players.

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:51.937
He narrated the improbable
years, the impossible

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:56.141
heroics, turned contests
into conversations.

00:22:56.141 --> 00:22:58.577
When he heard about this
honor, Vin asked with

00:22:58.577 --> 00:23:01.913
characteristic humility,
"Are you sure?

00:23:01.913 --> 00:23:05.684
I'm just an old baseball
announcer." And we had to

00:23:05.684 --> 00:23:11.123
inform him that to Americans
of all ages, you are

00:23:11.123 --> 00:23:13.892
an old friend.

00:23:13.892 --> 00:23:18.430
In fact, I thought about him
doing all these citations,

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:24.436
which would have been very
cool, but I thought we

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:26.271
shouldn't make him sing
for his supper like that.

00:23:26.271 --> 00:23:28.807
(laughter)

00:23:28.807 --> 00:23:31.610
"Up next" --

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:41.286
(laughter)

00:23:41.286 --> 00:23:45.557
Here's how great Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar was: 1967, he

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:50.629
had spent a year dominating
college basketball, the NCAA

00:23:50.629 --> 00:23:53.031
bans the dunk.

00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:55.934
They'd didn't say it was
about Kareem, but it was

00:23:55.934 --> 00:23:57.169
about Kareem.

00:23:57.169 --> 00:24:00.572
(laughter)

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:05.377
When a sport changes its
rules to make it harder just

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:07.979
for you, you
are really good.

00:24:07.979 --> 00:24:17.088
(laughter and applause)

00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:19.991
And yet despite the rule
change, he was still the

00:24:19.991 --> 00:24:22.027
sport's most
unstoppable force.

00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:26.064
It's a title he'd hold for
more than two decades,

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:30.569
winning NBA Finals MVPs a
staggering 14 years apart.

00:24:30.569 --> 00:24:31.770
(someone sneezes)

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:32.337
Bless you.

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:33.839
(laughter)

00:24:33.839 --> 00:24:39.344
And as a surprisingly
similar-looking co-pilot,

00:24:39.344 --> 00:24:42.781
Roger Murdoch, once said in
the movie, Airplane -- I

00:24:42.781 --> 00:24:45.150
mean, we've got some great
actors here --

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.484
Space Jam, Airplane.

00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:50.021
(laughter)

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:53.825
He did it all while dragging
Walton and Lanier up and

00:24:53.825 --> 00:24:55.227
down the court
for 48 minutes.

00:24:55.227 --> 00:25:00.866
But the reason we honor
Kareem is more than just a

00:25:00.866 --> 00:25:04.903
pair of goggles
and the skyhook.

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:07.839
He stood up for his Muslim
faith when it wasn't easy

00:25:07.839 --> 00:25:10.475
and it wasn't popular.

00:25:10.475 --> 00:25:12.777
He's as comfortable sparring
with Bruce Lee as he is

00:25:12.777 --> 00:25:16.615
advocating on Capitol
Hill or writing with

00:25:16.615 --> 00:25:19.918
extraordinary eloquence
about patriotism.

00:25:19.918 --> 00:25:22.654
Physically, intellectually,
spiritually -- Kareem is

00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:25.457
one-of-a-kind -- an American
who illuminates both our

00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:28.360
most basic freedoms and
our highest aspirations.

00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:34.833
When he was five years old,
Michael Jordan nearly cut

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:36.468
off his big toe with an axe.

00:25:36.468 --> 00:25:37.469
(laughter)

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:41.139
Back then, his handles
needed a little work.

00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:48.313
But think -- if things had
gone differently, Air Jordan

00:25:48.313 --> 00:25:50.315
just might never
have taken flight.

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:51.316
(laughter)

00:25:51.316 --> 00:25:55.787
I mean, you don't want to
buy a shoe with one toe missing.

00:25:55.787 --> 00:25:57.255
(laughter)

00:25:57.255 --> 00:26:01.259
We may never have seen him
switch hands in mid-air

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:02.727
against the Lakers.

00:26:02.727 --> 00:26:05.563
Or drop 63 in the Garden.

00:26:05.563 --> 00:26:07.465
Or gut it out
in the flu game.

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:09.434
Or hit "the shot" three
different times -- over

00:26:09.434 --> 00:26:12.203
Georgetown, over
Ehlo, over Russell.

00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:14.906
We might not have seen
him take on Larry Bird in

00:26:14.906 --> 00:26:21.212
H-O-R-S-E or lift up the
sport globally along with

00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:23.014
the Dream Team.

00:26:23.014 --> 00:26:26.651
Yet MJ is still more than
those moments; more than

00:26:26.651 --> 00:26:30.322
just the best player on the
two greatest teams of all

00:26:30.322 --> 00:26:39.097
time -- the Dream Team and
the Chicago '96 Bulls.

00:26:39.097 --> 00:26:42.200
He's more than a logo, more
than just an Internet meme.

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:48.340
(laughter)

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:51.142
More than just a charitable
donor or a business owner

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:53.611
committed to diversity.

00:26:53.611 --> 00:26:56.881
There is a reason you call
someone "the Michael Jordan

00:26:56.881 --> 00:27:01.519
of" -- Michael Jordan of
neurosurgery, or the Michael

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:06.891
Jordan of rabbis, or the
Michael Jordan of outrigger

00:27:06.891 --> 00:27:12.330
canoeing -- and they know
what you're talking about.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.533
Because Michael Jordan
is the Michael Jordan

00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:16.534
of greatness.

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:21.139
He is the definition of
somebody so good at what

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:25.310
they do that everybody
recognizes them.

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:28.146
That's pretty rare.

00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:31.182
As a child, Diana Ross loved
singing and dancing for

00:27:31.182 --> 00:27:33.151
family friends --
but not for free.

00:27:33.151 --> 00:27:35.353
(laughter)

00:27:35.353 --> 00:27:38.656
She was smart enough
to pass the hat.

00:27:38.656 --> 00:27:41.493
And later, in Detroit's
Brewster housing projects,

00:27:41.493 --> 00:27:44.696
she met Mary Wilson
and Florence Ballard.

00:27:44.696 --> 00:27:47.298
Their neighbor, Smokey
Robinson, put them in front

00:27:47.298 --> 00:27:53.405
of Berry Gordy -- and the
rest was magic -- music history.

00:27:53.405 --> 00:27:55.907
The Supremes earned a
permanent place in the

00:27:55.907 --> 00:27:58.510
American soundtrack.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:02.280
Along with her honey voice,
her soulful sensibility,

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:07.185
Diana exuded glamour and
grace that filled stages

00:28:07.185 --> 00:28:10.855
that helped to shape
the sound of Motown.

00:28:10.855 --> 00:28:12.857
On top of becoming one
of the most successful

00:28:12.857 --> 00:28:17.362
recording artists of all
time, raised five kids --

00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:22.167
somehow found time to earn
an Oscar nomination for acting.

00:28:22.167 --> 00:28:26.438
Today, from the hip-hop that
samples her, to the young

00:28:26.438 --> 00:28:30.075
singers who've been inspired
by her, to the audiences

00:28:30.075 --> 00:28:34.012
that still cannot get enough
of her -- Diana Ross's

00:28:34.012 --> 00:28:39.284
influence is
inescapable as ever.

00:28:39.284 --> 00:28:43.888
He was sprung from a
cage out on Highway 9.

00:28:43.888 --> 00:28:49.060
A quiet kid from Jersey,
just trying to make sense of

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.963
the temples of dreams and
mystery that dotted his

00:28:51.963 --> 00:28:56.901
hometown -- pool halls,
bars, girls and cars, altars

00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:58.303
and assembly lines.

00:28:58.303 --> 00:29:01.606
And for decades, Bruce
Springsteen has brought us

00:29:01.606 --> 00:29:05.343
all along on a journey
consumed with the bargains

00:29:05.343 --> 00:29:08.446
between ambition and
injustice, and pleasure and

00:29:08.446 --> 00:29:12.484
pain; the simple glories
and scattered heartbreak of

00:29:12.484 --> 00:29:15.453
everyday life in America.

00:29:15.453 --> 00:29:18.256
To create one of his biggest
hits, he once said, "I

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:21.826
wanted to craft a record
that sounded like the last

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:24.963
record on Earth...the last
one you'd ever need to hear.

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:29.567
One glorious noise...then
the apocalypse." Every

00:29:29.567 --> 00:29:32.737
restless kid in America was
given a story: "Born to

00:29:32.737 --> 00:29:36.141
Run." He didn't stop there.

00:29:36.141 --> 00:29:38.443
Once he told us about
himself, he told us about

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:39.444
everybody else.

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:42.380
The steelworker in
"Youngstown." The Vietnam

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:46.784
Vet in "Born in the
USA." The sick and the

00:29:46.784 --> 00:29:50.455
marginalized on "The Streets
of Philadelphia." The

00:29:50.455 --> 00:29:52.724
firefighter carrying the
weight of a reeling but

00:29:52.724 --> 00:29:56.561
resilient nation on "The
Rising." The young soldier

00:29:56.561 --> 00:30:00.498
reckoning with "Devils
and Dust" in Iraq.

00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:04.536
The communities knocked down
by recklessness and greed in

00:30:04.536 --> 00:30:08.206
the "Wrecking Ball." All of
us, with all our faults and

00:30:08.206 --> 00:30:11.776
our failings, every color,
and class, and creed, bound

00:30:11.776 --> 00:30:14.812
together by one defiant,
restless train rolling

00:30:14.812 --> 00:30:18.316
toward "The Land of Hope
and Dreams." These are all

00:30:18.316 --> 00:30:21.486
anthems of our America; the
reality of who we are, and

00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:24.889
the reverie of
who we want to be.

00:30:24.889 --> 00:30:27.759
"The hallmark of a rock
and roll band," Bruce

00:30:27.759 --> 00:30:31.396
Springsteen once said, is
that "the narrative you tell

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:34.532
together is bigger than
anyone could have told on

00:30:34.532 --> 00:30:38.169
your own." And for decades,
alongside the Big Man,

00:30:38.169 --> 00:30:41.906
Little Steven, a Jersey girl
named Patti, and all the men

00:30:41.906 --> 00:30:45.143
and women of the E Street
Band, Bruce Springsteen has

00:30:45.143 --> 00:30:48.313
been carrying the rest of us
on his journey, asking us

00:30:48.313 --> 00:30:52.717
all "what is the work for
us to do in our short time

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:55.353
here." I am the President.

00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:56.120
But he is The Boss.

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.056
(laughter)

00:30:58.056 --> 00:31:02.927
And pushing 70, he's still
laying down four-hour live

00:31:02.927 --> 00:31:06.664
sets -- if you have been
at them, he is working.

00:31:06.664 --> 00:31:10.902
"Fire-breathing rock 'n'
roll." So I thought twice

00:31:10.902 --> 00:31:13.571
about giving him a medal
named for freedom because we

00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:17.842
hope he remains, in his
words, a "prisoner of rock

00:31:17.842 --> 00:31:20.345
'n' roll" for years to come.

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:24.916
So, I told you, this is
like a really good class.

00:31:24.916 --> 00:31:25.917
(laughter)

00:31:25.917 --> 00:31:27.919
Ladies and gentlemen, I want
you all to give it up for

00:31:27.919 --> 00:31:30.788
the recipients of the 2016
Presidential Medal of Freedom.

00:31:30.788 --> 00:31:42.200
(applause)

00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:49.774
It is a good group.

00:31:49.774 --> 00:31:56.514
All right.

00:31:56.514 --> 00:31:59.284
Now we actually got
to give them medals.

00:31:59.284 --> 00:32:02.987
So please be patient.

00:32:02.987 --> 00:32:05.356
We are going to have my
military aide read

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:07.458
the citations.

00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:10.328
Each one of them will come
up and receive the medals,

00:32:10.328 --> 00:32:12.263
and then we'll wrap
up the program.

00:32:12.263 --> 00:32:12.864
Okay.

00:32:12.864 --> 00:32:15.400
Let's hit it.

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:17.001
Military Aide:
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:19.270
(applause)

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:44.062
An iconic basketball player
who revolutionized the sport

00:32:44.062 --> 00:32:46.798
with his all-around play and
signature skyhook, Kareem

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:50.301
Abdul-Jabbar is a 19-time
All-Star, a 6-time world

00:32:50.301 --> 00:32:53.838
champion, and the leading
scorer in NBA history.

00:32:53.838 --> 00:32:56.140
Adding to his achievements
on the court he also left

00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:59.043
his mark off of it,
advocating for civil rights,

00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:02.780
cancer research, science
education, and social justice.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.882
In doing so, Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar leaves a

00:33:04.882 --> 00:33:08.119
towering legacy of
compassion, faith, and

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:10.555
service to others -- a
legacy based not only on the

00:33:10.555 --> 00:33:12.957
strength and grace of his
athleticism, but on the

00:33:12.957 --> 00:33:15.426
sharpness of his mind and
the size of his heart.

00:33:15.426 --> 00:33:18.196
(applause)

00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:06.844
her life defying the odds
and working on behalf

00:34:06.844 --> 00:34:07.879
of her people.

00:34:07.879 --> 00:34:10.548
As a young woman, she was
told that she wasn't capable

00:34:10.548 --> 00:34:12.016
of understanding accounting.

00:34:12.016 --> 00:34:14.719
So she mastered the field --
and used her expertise to

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:17.455
champion a lawsuit whose
historic settlement has

00:34:17.455 --> 00:34:19.624
helped restore Tribal
homelands to her beloved

00:34:19.624 --> 00:34:22.260
Blackfeet Nation and
many other Tribes.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:25.396
Today, her tenacious and
unwavering spirit lives on

00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:28.065
in the thousands of people
and hundreds of Tribes for

00:34:28.065 --> 00:34:31.202
whom she fought and in all
those she taught to believe

00:34:31.202 --> 00:34:34.238
that it is never too late to
right the wrongs of the past

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.640
and help shape
a better future.

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.676

(applause)

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:16.714
In a career spanning three
decades, Ellen DeGeneres has

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:19.150
lifted our spirits and
brought joy to our lives as

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:22.487
a stand-up comic, actor,
and television star.

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:25.323
In every role, she reminds
us to be kind to one another

00:35:25.323 --> 00:35:28.860
and to treat people as each
of us wants to be treated.

00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:32.430
At a pivotal moment, her
courage and candor helped

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.966
change the hearts and minds
of millions of Americans,

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.602
accelerating our Nation's
constant drive toward

00:35:37.602 --> 00:35:39.637
equality and
acceptance for all.

00:35:39.637 --> 00:35:42.340
Again and again, Ellen
DeGeneres has shown us that

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.510
a single individual can make
the world a more fun, more

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:49.080
open, more loving place --
so long as we

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.048
"just keep swimming."

00:35:51.048 --> 00:35:53.484

Niro has delivered some of

00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:36.761
screen's most memorable
performances, cementing his

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:38.963
place as one of the most
gifted actors of

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:40.298
his generation.

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:43.134
From "The Godfather Part II"
and "The Deer Hunter" to

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:46.070
"Midnight Run" and "Heat,"
his work is legendary for

00:36:46.070 --> 00:36:47.672
its range and depth.

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:09.246
use their talents and
resources to tackle the

00:39:09.246 --> 00:39:10.848
world's greatest challenges.

00:39:10.848 --> 00:39:13.084
From helping women and girls
lift themselves and their

families out of poverty
to empowering young minds

00:39:15.519 --> 00:39:18.322
across America, they have

(applause)

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:20.851
Never limited by
conventional materials,

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:24.088
styles, or processes, Frank
Gehry's bold and thoughtful

00:40:24.088 --> 00:40:26.490
structures demonstrate
architecture's power to

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:29.794
induce wonder and
revitalize communities.

00:40:29.794 --> 00:40:32.196
A creative mind from an
early age, he began his

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:34.965
career by building imaginary
homes and cities with scrap

00:40:34.965 --> 00:40:37.635
material from his
grandfather's hardware store.

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:39.637
Since then, his work
continues to strike a

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:41.639
balance between
experimentation and

00:40:41.639 --> 00:40:44.275
functionality, resulting in
some of the 20th century's

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:45.509
most iconic buildings.

She broke barriers in
founding her own software

00:41:54.712 --> 00:41:57.681
businesses, revolutionizing
an industry and inspiring

00:41:57.681 --> 00:42:00.517
countless women to
participate in STEM fields.

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:03.454

revealed the character of
America, as well as his own.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:59.543
Portraying war heroes, an
astronaut, a ship captain, a

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:02.980
cartoon cowboy, a young man
growing up too fast, and

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.883
dozens of others, he's
allowed us to see ourselves

00:43:05.883 --> 00:43:09.286
-- not only as we are,
but as we aspire to be.

00:43:09.286 --> 00:43:12.356
On screen and off, Tom Hanks
has honored the sacrifices

00:43:12.356 --> 00:43:15.926

Nation, called on us all to

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:18.762
think big and to believe,
and inspired a new

00:43:18.762 --> 00:43:22.466

Rear Admiral Grace Murray
Hopper found her calling early.

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:10.314

She invented the first
compiler, or translator, a

00:44:27.197 --> 00:44:29.833
fundamental element of
our now digital world.

00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:32.236

From the courts in
Wilmington, Chapel Hill, and

00:45:50.013 --> 00:45:53.584
Chicago to the owner's suite
he occupies today, his life

00:45:53.584 --> 00:45:56.487
and example have inspired
millions of Americans to

00:45:56.487 --> 00:45:58.088

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:49.907
introspection, and humility.

00:46:49.907 --> 00:46:52.543

Her pieces have changed the
landscape of our country and

00:47:01.385 --> 00:47:04.087
influenced the dialogue of
our society -- never more

00:47:04.087 --> 00:47:06.390
profoundly than with her
tribute to the Americans who

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:10.227
fell in Vietnam by cutting
a wound into the Earth to

00:47:10.227 --> 00:47:12.529

bar for those who follow.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:22.032
As one of his show's
signature characters would

00:48:22.032 --> 00:48:24.201

American people, his
dedication to serving and

00:49:13.450 --> 00:49:16.153
empowering the public is
reflected in his efforts to

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:19.022

his staunch commitment to
the power of ideas and

00:49:26.263 --> 00:49:29.299

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:31.268
influential role
in our society.

the United States to pursue

influence prove that success
need not be determined by

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:43.974
our background, but by our
dedication to others and our

00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:47.377
passion for creating America
that is as inclusive as it

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:48.445
is prosperous.

vital social, political, and

00:51:28.218 --> 00:51:29.486
historical themes.

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:32.222
His lifelong advocacy on
behalf of preserving our

00:51:32.222 --> 00:51:35.525

an enduring legacy as his

00:51:35.525 --> 00:51:38.395
award-winning films, as will
his pioneering support for

00:51:38.395 --> 00:51:40.664
independent filmmakers
across America.

found time to teach us
about life and love while

00:54:05.742 --> 00:54:09.479
chronicling routine plays
and historic heroics.

00:54:09.479 --> 00:54:11.915
In victory and in defeat,

reverberated through the
bleachers, across the

00:54:13.984 --> 00:54:16.786

He is an American treasure
and a beloved storyteller,

00:54:19.856 --> 00:54:22.292

00:55:02.899 --> 00:55:05.268
(applause)

00:55:14.110 --> 00:55:17.313
As a songwriter, a
humanitarian, America's Rock

00:55:17.313 --> 00:55:19.315
and Roll laureate, and
New Jersey's greatest

00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:21.685
ambassador, Bruce
Springsteen is, quite

00:55:21.685 --> 00:55:22.919
simply, The Boss.

00:55:22.919 --> 00:55:24.354
(laughter)

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:26.189
Through stories about
ordinary people, from

00:55:26.189 --> 00:55:28.858
Vietnam veterans to steel
workers, his songs capture

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:31.628
the pain and the promise of
the American experience.

00:55:31.628 --> 00:55:34.597

performances that have
rocked audiences for decades.

00:55:40.136 --> 00:55:43.373
With empathy and honesty, he
holds up a mirror to who we

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:46.910
are -- as Americans chasing
our dreams, and as human

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:48.912
beings trying to
do the right thing.

00:55:48.912 --> 00:55:50.914
There's a place for everyone
in Bruce

00:55:50.914 --> 00:55:52.115

For sixty years, Cicely
Tyson has graced the screen

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:47.971
and the stage, enlightening
us with her groundbreaking

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:51.741
characters and calls to
conscience, humility, and hope.

00:56:51.741 --> 00:56:54.210
Her achievements as an
actor, her devotion to her

00:56:54.210 --> 00:56:57.113
faith, and her commitment to
advancing equality for all

00:56:57.113 --> 00:57:00.250
Americans-especially women
of color -- have touched

00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.752
audiences of multiple
generations.

00:57:02.752 --> 00:57:05.255
From "The Autobiography
of Miss Jane Pittman," to

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:09.993
"Sounder," to "The Trip to
Bountiful," Cicely Tyson's

00:57:09.993 --> 00:57:12.629
performances illuminate the
character of our people and

00:57:12.629 --> 00:57:14.831
the extraordinary
possibilities of America.

00:57:14.831 --> 00:57:17.634
(applause)

00:57:52.101 --> 00:57:58.107
The President: So, just on a
personal note, part of the

00:57:58.107 --> 00:58:02.679
reason that these events are
so special to me is because

00:58:02.679 --> 00:58:07.917
everybody on this stage
has touched me in a very

00:58:07.917 --> 00:58:13.122
powerful, personal way --
in ways that they probably

00:58:13.122 --> 00:58:15.225
couldn't imagine.

00:58:15.225 --> 00:58:18.027
Whether it was having been
inspired by a song, or a

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:31.507
game, or a story, or a film,
or a monument, or in the

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:33.376
case of Newt Minow
introducing me to Michelle --

00:58:33.376 --> 00:58:36.946
(laughter)

00:58:36.946 --> 00:58:44.654
-- these are folks who have
helped make me who I am and

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:50.159
think about my presidency,
and what also makes them

00:58:50.159 --> 00:58:52.695
special is, this is America.

00:58:52.695 --> 00:58:58.635
And it's useful when you
think about this incredible

00:58:58.635 --> 00:59:03.907
collection of people to
realize that this is what

00:59:03.907 --> 00:59:06.509
makes us the greatest
nation on Earth.

00:59:06.509 --> 00:59:07.176
Not because of what we --

00:59:07.176 --> 00:59:09.112
(applause)

00:59:19.389 --> 00:59:23.927
Not because of our
differences, but because, in

00:59:23.927 --> 00:59:27.263
our difference, we find
something common to share.

00:59:27.263 --> 00:59:29.365
And what a glorious
thing that is.

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:32.969
What a great gift
that is to America.

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:37.040
So I want all of you
to enjoy the wonderful

00:59:37.040 --> 00:59:40.310
reception that will be
taking place afterwards.

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.112
Michelle and I have to get
back to work, unfortunately,

00:59:43.112 --> 00:59:44.514
but I hear the food
is pretty good.

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:45.748
(laughter)

00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:49.118
And I would like all of you
to give one big rousing

00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:53.556
round of applause to our
2016 honorees for the

00:59:53.556 --> 00:59:56.492
Presidential
Medal of Freedom.

00:59:56.492 --> 00:59:57.360
Give it up.

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:58.861
(applause)
