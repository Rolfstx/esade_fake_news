00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.210
If you've ever eaten a hamburger at a fast-food restaurant,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.570
White Castle deserves at least some of the credit.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.750
White Castle is a fast-food chain with a small footprint in

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.370
the Midwest and Northeast.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.730
It's famous for small, cheap burgers and its appearance in the

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.860
movie "Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle."

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.100
But you might not know that White Castle is widely thought of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.580
as the first fast-food hamburger chain in the United States.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.210
It also played a key role in making the hamburger synonymous

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.380
with American cuisine.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.720
An American classic, White Castle Slider, doesn't get any

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.140
better. White Castle started in 1921 in Wichita Kansas,

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.160
decades before McDonald's or Burger King opened.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.810
By 1961, it says it was the first fast-food hamburger chain to

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.510
sell over a billion burgers in the U.S.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.780
But odds are, there isn't even a White Castle in your

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.550
neighborhood. As of 2019, White Castle has around 370

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.840
locations in 13 states, a practically unchanged store count

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.220
for the last 20 years.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.090
Compared to big fast-food chains, White Castle's footprint is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.020
tiny. So why is it that with a highly loyal customer base and

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.410
a nearly 30-year head start on the competition, White Castle

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.380
hasn't become a global fast-food chain like McDonald's or

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.650
Burger King. Why did the chain stay small?

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.240
White Castle has remained a family-owned, privately held

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.490
company since it started in 1921.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.500
Fry cook Walter Andersen started a food stand in 1916, that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.660
grew to four successful but small hamburger stands in Wichita

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.050
Kansas. As legend has it, one day while Anderson was still a

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.410
short-order cook in a local Wichita diner, he got frustrated

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.930
that the meatballs he was cooking stuck to the grill, so he

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.430
smashed one with his spatula.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.460
Customers loved the resulting thin patties, which were also

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.040
faster to cook, meaning that he could sell more of them.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.150
In 1921, Anderson met insurance and real estate businessman

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.100
Edgar Waldo "Billy" Ingram.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.000
The two partnered and Ingram rebranded Anderson's business as

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.180
White Castle. Almost 100 years later, Ingram's great

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.280
granddaughter is now running White Castle.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.910
Before White Castle, hamburgers had a negative reputation in

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.170
the early 20th century.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.830
Famous exposes published in that era raised public suspicion

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.740
of unsanitary practices in the ground meat industry.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.730
Ingram knew changing the public's mind about ground beef was

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.710
integral to White Castle's success.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.010
That's why every aspect of the first White Castles were

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.640
designed with cleanliness in mind--even down to the name.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.810
"White" signified purity and cleanliness and "Castle"

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.790
represented strength and stability.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.870
And it worked--White Castle grew quickly expanding throughout

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.670
the Midwest in the 1920s.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.120
White Castle played a key role in making the hamburger an

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.780
acceptable part of the American diet which helped pave the way

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.800
for other rivals.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.580
Before White Castle, many burgers sold at fairs and outside

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.910
factories were just meatballs placed between slices of bread.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.510
The flat patties and buns made popular by White Castle set the

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.190
stage for the modern burger.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.630
White Castle grew rapidly in the 1920s and even weathered the

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.300
Great Depression in the '30s because its founders streamlined

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.330
the business, which included buying out Anderson's half of the

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.510
company and relocating its headquarters to its geographic

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.400
center in Columbus Ohio.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.780
But when the U.S. entered World War 2 in 1941, White Castle

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.050
suffered from food shortages and labor scarcity that hindered

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.200
its growth. White Castle's profits fell significantly.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.110
In 1954, Burger King was founded.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.400
A year later, in 1955, the first McDonald's opened in

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.670
Illinois. Through franchising, these companies grew to be

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.940
national and then international brands in a matter of decades.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.910
A White Castle historian called McDonald's the only

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.480
"life-and-death threat to White Castle" because its system was

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.280
faster and extremely popular.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.810
For the 25 years after McDonald's emerged as a competitor,

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.950
White Castle grew â€”but slowly.

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.430
Over time, its footprint actually shrank--from having

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.620
restaurants in 14 cities in 1930 but only 10 cities by 1979.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.490
In the 1980s, despite being much smaller than rival national

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.150
chains, White Castle reclaimed its position as a leading fast

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.570
food hamburger chain, expanding to about 300 restaurants in

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.420
new markets. The bulk of its restaurants have remained in the

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.710
Midwest and Northeast.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.970
Its U.S. sales in fiscal year 2018 were $556.1

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.560
million.

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.750
For comparison, McDonald's U.S.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.560
revenue was nearly 14 times that, at about $7.7

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.940
billion.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.180
But that's exactly what White Castle's founder intended.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.660
White Castle didn't franchise or go public, two mechanisms

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.060
that fueled the expansion of other fast-food chains.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.480
Without pressure from shareholders or franchisees, White

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.570
Castle has had more freedom to experiment than a corporation

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.210
that has to show profits and growth every quarter.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.480
Founder Billy Ingram also held out on franchising because he

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.720
wanted to keep complete control over every aspect of the

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.690
business, right down to the type of porcelain the original

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.860
white castles were built with.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.990
There are certainly other models out there.

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.560
That would allow you to grow faster but you have to give up

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.970
control and you have to give up the ownership of the customer

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.950
and the ownership of the team member and that's just not

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.090
something that we have ever really been interested in doing.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.220
And so each generation--we're in the fourth generation now--

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.890
has really, you know, certainly studied all the different

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.280
models and we still keep coming back to that this model has

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.850
worked well for us for almost 100 years and that we believe

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.080
it's a good model for us to continue into the future.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.430
But it's traditional expansion strategy might be changing.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.490
White Castle is now showing signs that it's ready to expand

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.540
beyond the Midwest.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.060
Starting in 2014, White Castle has set its sights west--moving

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.840
away from its Midwestern stronghold.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.830
White Castle has had a strong presence in cities like Chicago

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.880
and St. Louis. Now it's taking on Las Vegas and Scottsdale,

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:01.900
Arizona. It has multiple stores in Las Vegas, and open one in

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.850
Arizona in October 2019.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.810
The Las Vegas locations, the first of which opened in 2015,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.790
represent a shift for the company.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:13.210
After more than 90 years of refusing to franchise in the

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:16.720
United States, White Castle partnered with its first licensee

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.820
ever to open stores in Las Vegas.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.090
The licensee got White Castle prime real estate on the Las

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:23.830
Vegas strip in the Casino Royale.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.050
There's another family business that's based there and they

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.320
reached out to us and our standard response is always no, we

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.660
don't franchise, we don't license.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.040
They were so persuasive and so compelling.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.620
And we realized they shared a lot of the same values in terms

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:39.180
of being a family-owned business.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:42.120
And when they told us they could get us a presence on the Las

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.530
Vegas Strip at a really, really highly visible location, we

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.600
thought as we change from third generation and fourth

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.570
generation leadership, why not try something new.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.170
But White Castle says this relationship is the exception, not

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:58.170
the rule. The company doesn't plan to use licensing as a model

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:59.310
for growth in the future.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:03.600
We have chosen to do all of our stores company-owned so we

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.980
don't grow as fast as other brands, we're very purposeful

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.870
about where we want to grow.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:13.620
You won't see us opening 100 in one year.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.710
But you will see us being very very thoughtful about where we

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:17.970
open and when we open.

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.970
These expansions actually come as White Castle's overall

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.560
footprint has grown smaller.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:27.600
From 2009 to 2013, it closed net 44 stores, as it shutters

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.070
less profitable restaurants.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.040
But its total revenue has stayed roughly flat over those 10

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.520
years, hovering between $540 million to $5645 million, so the

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:33.700
restaurants the company has kept open are more profitable.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.770
We have definitely closed some locations as time has gone on.

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:48.860
Some of the locations we had in the 1930s and 1940s just

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.900
aren't as viable in terms of how many people live in that area

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.080
or what changes have been made to local walkways and

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.810
expressways that have been built. You know, a mile away, there

00:07:57.810 --> 00:07:59.850
aren't as many cars going by as they were.

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.680
So we've been able to steadily grow revenue and meet our

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:07.800
targets as we reimagine the landscape a little bit.

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:12.960
In 2009 White Castle's 418 restaurants had average sales per

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.340
restaurant of $1.3

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:17.370
million dollars. That's an important indicator in the

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:21.540
restaurant industry. Fast forward to fiscal year 2018, and

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:24.630
thanks in part to its small footprint, menu innovation and

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:28.770
price increases, White Castle sales per unit were up nearly 14

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:31.920
percent. White Castle says it's growing very intentionally and

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.330
choosing new markets carefully.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.570
In the past, White Castle expanded by entering a city en

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:40.170
masse, opening between five and 10 locations in a new city.

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:43.940
In the 80s and 90s, White Castle expanded to four new markets

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.600
at once--Philadelphia, Kansas City, Nashville and Dayton.

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.150
They weren't successful. White Castle didn't adapt its

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.940
operating model to fit the individual cities and it poured too

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.640
much money into setting up new stores and building the supply

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.670
chain. White Castle realized that flooding a new market with

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.530
lots of restaurants wasn't working.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:04.230
Opening lots of stores at once was expensive.

00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.920
So we've been more selective and thought about the restaurant

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.340
growth as; hey let's find locations that really can be just

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.890
really, really ultra successful and great locations, easy to

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.510
find and kind of, you know, their own oasis in new markets

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:25.140
especially. Having lots of stores close together also led to

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:28.050
another common problem: cannibalizing sales.

00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:30.960
The big brands try to get in and dominate a market and go in

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:35.370
and have the ability to get on media and have enough locations

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:37.380
to support that media spend.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.690
And I think with White Castle, because it's such a unique

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.930
brand and it is a destination because of the types of products

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:47.910
and the way people use it, that they're less inclined to have

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.840
to do that. You know, penetration in markets doesn't hurt but

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.150
I don't think it's critical for every brand particularly if

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:55.400
you're more of a destination.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.290
White Castle wouldn't say which state it would expand to next,

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:01.380
but they did share with CNBC that it's always considering new

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.480
markets--even internationally.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.160
White Castle opened two restaurants in Shanghai in 2017

00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:10.620
through a partnership with a Chinese private equity firm.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:14.280
It was White Castle's first entrance into China, a popular

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.980
destination for American chains looking to expand.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.200
Basically the way they describe it is a really well-run

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:25.580
private equity group in China approached them.

00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:29.730
They had a love for the brand they had really good ideas and

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.920
White Castle said, why not?

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.910
They had really nothing to lose and it's a pretty good

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.000
opportunity for the company if it works out.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:41.490
White Castle's presence in Shanghai has grown to four stores

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.890
as of October 2019.

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.650
White Castle leadership says the stores have steadily grown in

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:50.370
sales and exceeded expectations, but wouldn't give specifics.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.310
This isn't the first time White Castle has tried to expand

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.120
internationally. In the 80s and 90s, White Castle tried--and

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.400
failed--to open stores abroad.

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:02.700
By 1989 White Castle had opened six restaurants in Japan.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.760
It also opened six more restaurants across Malaysia and

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.430
Singapore to beef up the company's presence in Asia.

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.760
But the expansion stopped and the stores closed just a few

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.660
years after opening due to low demand.

00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:17.610
In looking at the failure what we realize is we weren't

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.180
strategic about it that really we were opportunistic so

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:24.300
someone came to us and said they were interested from a

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.400
different country and it seemed like they had good resources.

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:29.820
We said yes without really thoughtfully discerning whether we

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:30.830
might be successful there or not.

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.050
One mistake White Castle made in its attempt to expand abroad

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.750
was that it didn't take enough time to research local tastes

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:37.970
and customize its menu.

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:39.630
A menu that works in the U.S.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.330
doesn't always work in international markets.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:45.420
With the Shanghai restaurants that opened in 2017, White

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.400
Castle tailored its menu to local tastes.

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:50.370
Customers can get a Peking duck slider made with duck breast

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.270
slices and cucumber or a Mapo Tofu beef slider, in addition to

00:11:54.270 --> 00:11:56.760
the same classic sliders available in the U.S..

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:59.880
CNBC went to one of White Castle's restaurants in Shanghai to

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.290
see how the American chain was resonating with locals.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:36.660
It's too soon to say whether White Castle will catch on in

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.020
China. But one thing is clear -- in China, White Castle

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:42.420
doesn't have the low cost reputation that has helped it

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.410
succeed in the States.

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:48.780
In 1987 White Castle started selling some of its menu items in

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.990
retail stores. At the time this was unprecedented.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.750
It was one of the first restaurant brands ever to try it.

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:58.170
Retail remains one big difference between White Castle and its

00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:59.550
competitors like McDonald's.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.240
Those chains don't sell their burgers in the freezer aisle.

00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.920
Retail has been a huge boon for business.

00:13:05.130 --> 00:13:08.010
Retail sales make up about 20 percent of White Castle's total

00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:10.860
sales and that number is growing.

00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.070
According to euromonitor estimates, in 2018, the retail

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.410
business had sales of one hundred and ninety nine million

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:20.550
dollars. That's a 40 percent increase from 2013.

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:23.430
It's rank in the frozen ready meals category is also on the

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:27.120
rise. Plus, it's been huge for building brand awareness.

00:13:27.630 --> 00:13:30.090
The company says by offering its products in grocery stores

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.630
across the U.S., Canada and military bases, White Castle has

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.020
become a national, not just regional brand.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.600
Outside of the retail business, White Castle has also used

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.390
unique marketing and branding strategies to spread its name

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.470
across the country.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.190
It is, after all, the restaurant that agreed to be featured as

00:13:47.190 --> 00:13:51.210
a destination for hungry stoners in the 2004 classic, Harold

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.130
and Kumar Go To White Castle.

00:13:53.130 --> 00:13:55.920
While some brands might have avoided association with a movie

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.880
about stoners and marijuana, White Castle embraced the film.

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:02.310
It helped White Castle connect to a new generation of

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:05.430
customers -- and the company told CNBC that sales hit an

00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.280
all-time record the week after the movie was released.

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.520
White Castle continues to embrace this image as a late-night

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.220
stop. We made a conscious decision to be open 24 hours and to

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.550
be there for all of our customers morning noon or night.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.060
So sometimes that's when someone's just ended work on a shift.

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.380
Sometimes it's after a night out with friends and we haven't

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.500
ran away from that at all.

00:14:25.890 --> 00:14:28.740
Its cameo in Harold and Kumar is just one example of the

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.350
company's eccentric marketing strategies.

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:34.710
White Castle has tried selling wine pairings with its sliders

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.440
and offers table service dinners for Valentine's Day.

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:40.710
It was the first fast food chain to sell the Impossible burger

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.560
and worked with Wu Tang Clan to produce a series about the hip

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.230
hop group eating the vegan sliders in space.

00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.680
You find your niche from a marketing and branding perspective

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.210
and then you go with it, strong.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:55.710
It's fun and different and kind of kitschy and not taking

00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:57.240
themselves too seriously.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.180
The marketing and retail strategies seem to have worked.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.330
White Castle is at the top of the list in the burger "cult"

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.000
status which measures devotion to a brand.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.180
It beats out McDonald's in and out and Burger King in that

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.270
category, which shows that its fans are highly loyal to the

00:15:12.270 --> 00:15:14.130
point of fanaticism.

00:15:14.130 --> 00:15:17.820
In 2014, Time magazine deemed the two by two inch White Castle

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:21.120
Slider the most "influential burger of all time."

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.870
White Castle may rank high in hamburger loyalty but it falls

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.630
short in customer service ratings, ranking behind the big

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:29.820
burger brands.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.860
Family-owned businesses have a high rate of failure, with

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.800
about 70 percent of family owned businesses failing or being

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.140
sold before the second generation takes over.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:40.830
Just 10 percent make it to third generation leadership.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.440
That is one of the reasons why White Castle, now entering its

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.650
fourth generation of leadership, is so unique.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:50.250
White Castle's current CEO, Lisa Ingram, became the president

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:55.050
of White Castle in 2013 and took over as CEO in 2016 after her

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:56.070
father stepped down.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.820
Ingram says her legacy at White Castle will be innovation and

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:03.540
cultural change. How do we become a more nimble organization,

00:16:03.570 --> 00:16:07.160
how do we experiment more, how do we have fun more.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.500
How do we embrace, you know, who we are more.

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:14.220
And how do we do it in a way that's inclusive and allows all

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.310
of our team members to feel like they're a part of something

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.510
really fun and really big.

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:23.010
Ingram represents a shift for White Castle â€” she has an MBA in

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.130
operations from The Ohio State University and worked in the

00:16:26.130 --> 00:16:28.560
tech industry at large companies before joining the family

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.130
business. She broke from tradition by hiring three executives

00:16:32.130 --> 00:16:34.920
from outside of White Castle to join her leadership team.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.830
Ingram's experience working for other businesses made her

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.170
realize the company needed leaders with fresh eyes.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.270
That's always a real challenge.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:44.610
I think with family businesses because family business can be

00:16:44.610 --> 00:16:45.630
very insular.

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:49.470
And you can listen to a lot of people that have been around

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.610
for a long time, and they offer great insight and you want to

00:16:53.610 --> 00:16:55.550
make sure that you never lose that.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:57.350
One of the things that I have done though.

00:16:57.870 --> 00:17:00.990
Having worked outside in other industries and in other

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:04.410
companies, I really felt like we needed to have some outside

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:06.360
voices at the table as well.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:10.710
And so three of my executive team, I hired from the outside,

00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:14.520
which we did not do a lot of previously and they have brought

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.350
a very different perspective which is fabulous.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.250
White Castle's sales at U.S.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:20.920
restaurants are up about eight percent since Ingram was

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:23.140
appointed to company president in 2013.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:25.810
She took over as CEO in 2016.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.990
Yeah I think she represents all the things you want to see in

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.200
the restaurant industry. She represents leadership.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.360
Someone who went out and did things outside of the restaurant

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.670
industry and got executive leadership training and education.

00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:42.400
White Castle doesn't share much financial information but

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.370
company leadership says it has three goals to reach by its

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:49.540
100th birthday in 2021 â€” being a best place to work hitting

00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:52.450
one billion dollars in revenue and hitting a specific profit

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:56.110
goal. As it expands domestically and internationally, it's

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.660
clear that White Castle thinks it has quite a lot of room to

00:17:58.660 --> 00:17:58.960
grow.
