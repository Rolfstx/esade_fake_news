00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.360
THE 
BOEING 787.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.360
SOLD AS A "DREAMLINER".

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:34.430
Jim McNerney: A once in a decade if not once
in a generation achievement of human ingenuity.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.980
FOR AIRLINES IT'S CHEAP TO FLY.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.830
FOR PASSENGERS IT OFFERS UNPARALLELED
COMFORT.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.830
"wow"

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.329
FOR BOEING IT PROMISED WINDFALL PROFITS.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.270
PRESIDENT OBAMA: The Dreamliner is the plane
of the future.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.210
BUT AL JAZEERA DISCOVERS A DARK SIDE TO THE
DREAMLINER:

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.309
STAN SORSCHER: unimaginable that we could
be three years late, have a fleet grounding,

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.280
have fires on the airplane.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.130
OUR INVESTIGATION FINDS BOEING ALTERED ITS
OWN QUALITY STANDARDS

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.390
COLE: They're shortchanging the engineering
process to meet a schedule.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.050
WE UNCOVER A WHISTLEBLOWER FIRED AS HE FOUGHT
FOR SAFETY:

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.590
WOODS: There's no doubt there are bad repairs
going out the door on the 787 aircraft.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:32.220
WE GO BEHIND CLOSED DOORS, ONTO THE FACTORY
FLOOR, TO REVEAL A WORLD BOEING KEEPS SECRET.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:54.020
UC WORKER VIDEO: I wouldn't fly on one of
these planes…

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:06.880
Because I see the quality of the fu**ing sh*t
going down

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.819
around here.

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.739
TITLE: "BROKEN DREAMS: THE BOEING 787"
JANUARY 16TH, 2013.

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.500
TAKAMATSU, JAPAN - A BRAND-NEW BOEING 787
DREAMLINER MAKES AN EMERGENCY LANDING.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:22.130
PASSENGERS KNEW THE PLANE WAS IN TROUBLE:
AOYA KAZUNORI/passenger: I looked outside

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.650
and saw white smoke.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.940
That's when I realised the danger.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.760
KEN'ICHI KAWAMURA/passenger: The burning plastic
smell got worse.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.880
/ I thought we were going to crash.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:44.960
TAKEUCHI KOJI/Fireman: On closer inspection,
we observed a blue box that had expanded in

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.320
size.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.349
THE BLUE BOX WAS ONE OF THE DREAMLINER'S TWO
LITHIUM ION BATTERIES –THE MOST POWERFUL

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:52.960
- AND RISKY - EVER PERMITTED

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.010
ON A COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.860
Newsreader: It's just the latest in a string
of embarrassments for Boeing's state of the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.580
art aircraft.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.470
NINE DAYS EARLIER A DREAMLINER BATTERY HAD
CAUGHT FIRE IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.770
TWO BATTERY FAILURES IN LESS THAN TWO WEEKS.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.400
NEWS BITE: Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways
and Japan Airlines have grounded their fleets

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.850
of Boeing 787

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.850
Dreamliners.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.510
JAPAN AIRLINES AND ANA HAD BEEN THE FIRST
TO FLY THE DREAMLINER - NOW THEY BECAME THE

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.430
FIRST TO CANCEL ALL FLIGHTS.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.100
NEWS BITE: Breaking news.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.720
The United States Federal Aviation…

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.560
WITHIN 24 HOURS, THE U.S. SAFETY REGULATOR,
THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION, GROUNDED

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560
THE 787.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.530
NEWS BITE: All 50 of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliners
have now been grounded…

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.650
THE REST OF THE WORLD FOLLOWED.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.830
NO BOEING FLEET HAD EVER BEEN FORCED FROM
SERVICE.

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:57.990
BUT ON JANUARY 17, 2013, THE DREAM WAS OVER.

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.880
I'M WILL JORDAN.

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.900
FOR A YEAR, MY TEAM AND I HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATING
THE DREAMLINER.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.680
IT'S THE BOEING COMPANY'S BIG BET ON THE FUTURE…

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.510
A PLANE CREATED TO SAVE FUEL, IMPROVE COMFORT,
AND BOOST PROFITS.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.560
AND ONE BUILT IN A NEW WAY - DESIGNED AND
MANUFACTURED BY SCORES OF COMPANIES AROUND

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.570
THE GLOBE.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:36.350
THE COMPANY THAT MAKES THE BATTERY IS GS YUASA,
BASED IN KYOTO.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.270
WE WANTED THEM TO TELL US WHAT HAD GONE SO
WRONG.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.650
SOUND: Security Guard in Japanese.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.270
Will: Al Jazeera.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:48.900
Guard: Al Jazeera.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.160
We wonder whether you might be able to do

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160
an interview?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160
THEY REFUSED.

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.880
SPOKESWOMAN: We have a contract with Boeing
so we can't, we can't tell any comments to

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:59.880
you.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.350
THE BATTERY IS ONLY ONE PART OF THE DREAMLINER'S
COMPLEX ELECTRICAL SYSTEM.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.910
THERE'S ALSO A CHARGER, MADE AT A FACTORY
THOUSANDS OF KILOMETRES AWAY.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:14.120
WHAT HAPPENED THERE, SHOWS BOEING LEARNT YEARS
AGO JUST HOW DANGEROUS A LITHIUM ION BATTERY

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.130
COULD BE.

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.960
IN TUCSON, ARIZONA, WE TRACKED DOWN MICHAEL
LEON – AN ELECTRICAL TECHNICIAN.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.710
MICHAEL LEON / Former Securaplane technician:
I've been working electronics since I was

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.720
17 years old, and I joined

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:38.960
the paratroopers and I was assigned to an
electronics battalion of the 82nd airborne.

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:46.330
LEON: this is the first time I've been here
since, since 2007.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.330
It's hard to believe that this is what's left
of a

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.639
three story engineering structure.

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.660
ON A NOVEMBER MORNING IN 2006, LEON AND DOZENS
OF OTHER WORKERS CLOCKED IN AT SECURAPLANE

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.300
- THE COMPANY THAT MAKES

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.290
THE BATTERY CHARGER.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:11.430
LEON: I started a pot of coffee then I went
into my lab and started working on my battery

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.350
charging unit.

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.600
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:21.120
LEON: …and there was a very loud explosion
and all of a sudden I was lying on the floor

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.930
and there it was coming out

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.200
the side of this battery.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:27.740
It was about that big, and it wasn't like
fire.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.060
It looked like a jet afterburner, like

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:35.520
jet exhaust.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.320
THE PROTOTYPE BATTERY SECURAPLANE WAS USING
TO TEST ITS CHARGER HAD EXPLODED.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:47.600
KIRK WINES / Former Securaplane technician:
I heard a very loud series of metallic rattling

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.600
bangs.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.680
A kind of

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:51.680
shhhhhh.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.300
And just this jet of steam.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:59.170
LEON: The fire was literally rolling up the
walls around me and, and on the ceiling, I

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:00.460
could just see it eating up

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:02.910
all around me…

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:09.330
WINES: I know if that had happened on board
an aircraft, there, there would be no chance

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:16.290
of survival.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:21.110
IT WAS THE BIGGEST CHEMICAL FIRE IN TUCSON'S
HISTORY.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:26.479
A TEN THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT, THREE-STOREY STRUCTURE,
BURNT TO THE GROUND.

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:32.330
RICHARD LUKSO / Securaplane founder: …after
my building burned down, after that they realized

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.070
very emphatically

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:43.889
the danger of this chemistry.

00:07:43.889 --> 00:07:48.259
RICHARD LUKSO KNOWS WELL THE CHEMISTRY OF
THE DREAMLINER BATTERY.

00:07:48.259 --> 00:07:50.340
BOEING CHOSE THE MOST POWERFUL THERE IS…

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:52.259
BUT ALSO THE MOST VOLATILE.

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:56.889
LUKSO:
they went to lithium cobalt which is way up

00:07:56.889 --> 00:07:59.249
here as far as danger.

00:07:59.249 --> 00:08:03.240
LUKSO STEPPED DOWN AS SECURAPLANE PRESIDENT
JUST BEFORE THE FIRE.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:08.389
HE STARTED A NEW COMPANY TO MAKE LITHIUM ION
BATTERIES FOR BUSINESS JETS.

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:13.080
LUKSO WAS A TRUE BELIEVER IN THE TECHNOLOGY.

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.509
THEN HE BEGAN TESTING.

00:08:14.509 --> 00:08:23.919
BULLET TEST VIDEO: Two, 3.3 amp hour series
battery pack bullet test.

00:08:23.919 --> 00:08:32.659
LUKSO WENT BEYOND EVEN THE LATEST INDUSTRY
GUIDELINES - GOING SO FAR AS TO FIRE BULLETS

00:08:32.659 --> 00:08:34.099
INTO BATTERIES, TO SEE IF

00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:36.940
THEY COULD BE MADE SAFE FOR MILITARY APPLICATIONS.

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.130
(BATTERY WALK/TALK) LUKSO: Yeah.

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:46.269
You could run the test that you feel that
you need to meet the requirements to

00:08:46.269 --> 00:08:53.910
be safe, but you also need to have a conscience
that's going to tell you I want to do the

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:56.860
extreme."

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:02.180
IN THE END, TESTING WITH A CONSCIENCE, LUKSO
COULDN'T MAKE THE BATTERIES MEET THE REQUIREMENTS.

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:05.160
HIS NEW COMPANY FAILED.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.110
LUKSO: …we became proficient in destroying
batteries.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:13.660
And, and the more we learned about it, the
worst it got.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.660
I

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:16.809
mean, oh, my God, we kept digging and digging.

00:09:16.809 --> 00:09:20.110
We were saying I wonder what the rest of the
guys are doing.

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:21.110
Well,

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.990
I guess we knew.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:30.980
BY REST OF THE GUYS HE MEANS BOEING.

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.639
AND THEY WERE TESTING TO A WEAKER STANDARD…

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:42.370
ONE WRITTEN BY THE FAA SPECIFICALLY FOR THE
DREAMLINER.

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.709
IT'S THE FAA'S JOB TO REGULATE AIR SAFETY.

00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:50.980
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING AIRPLANES, THE
FAA DELEGATES OVERSIGHT ALMOST COMPLETELY

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.380
TO THE AIRCRAFT

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.529
MANUFACTURERS.

00:09:54.529 --> 00:10:00.189
WHEN IT COMES TO THE BATTERY AND BEYOND, BOEING
LARGELY POLICES ITSELF.

00:10:00.189 --> 00:10:02.660
THE BATTERIES PASSED BOEING'S TESTS.

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:07.680
IN LINE WITH THE FAA RULES, BOEING SAID THE
787 BATTERIES WOULD VIRTUALLY NEVER CATCH

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.889
FIRE ON BOARD AN AIRCRAFT.

00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:14.550
THEN, THEY FAILED TWICE IN JUST NINE DAYS.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:18.079
BOEING HAS NOT UNCOVERED THE ROOT CAUSE OF
THE FAILURES.

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:26.449
IT FOUND A WORK AROUND: A STRONG STEEL CASE,
MORE INSULATION, AND AN EXHAUST FOR NOXIOUS

00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:27.449
FUMES.

00:10:27.449 --> 00:10:31.319
SINNETT: …any fire will be impossible because
there's not enough oxygen to support combustion.

00:10:31.319 --> 00:10:34.389
BUT SEVERAL LEADING SCIENTISTS HAVE THEIR
DOUBTS.

00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:39.329
DONALD SADOWAY / MIT: I don't think it's a
sufficient fix / Even inside that steel box

00:10:39.329 --> 00:10:41.319
with all of its

00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:48.170
fortifications, all of the elements are still
there for fire.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:53.899
DESPITE NOT KNOWING THE ROOT CAUSE, AMERICA'S
SAFETY REGULATOR, THE FAA, WAS SATISFIED.

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:59.179
AND IN APRIL 2013, THE DREAMLINER WAS BACK.

00:10:59.179 --> 00:11:02.759
BUT THIS STORY GOES FAR BEYOND A BURNING BATTERY.

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:05.360
IT BEGINS AT BOEING ITSELF.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.360
"This is it.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:14.690
The first American commercial jet capable
of economical transatlantic service.

00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.380
The Boeing 707 jet

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.380
clipper.

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.800
SINCE ITS CREATION IN SEATTLE NEARLY A CENTURY
AGO, BOEING HAD DEVELOPED A REPUTATION AS

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.670
A WORLD-CLASS ENGINEERING

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.950
COMPANY.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:32.389
BUT IN 1997 BOEING CHANGED.

00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:37.329
IT MERGED WITH COMPETITOR, MCDONNELL DOUGLAS.

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:40.810
TWO COMPANIES WITH TWO VERY DIFFERENT BUSINESS
MODELS.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:48.569
STAN SORSCHER / Former Boeing engineer: the
merger was all about transforming our successful

00:11:48.569 --> 00:11:51.059
culture and business

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:55.059
model into the same business model that McDonnell
Douglas had used unsuccessfully.

00:11:55.059 --> 00:11:58.629
ABW-002 / 1:05
ABOULAFIA: you basically shortchange engineering,

00:11:58.629 --> 00:12:01.059
you stop doing aggressive new product developments;
you run the

00:12:01.059 --> 00:12:02.920
business for cash.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.699
THE NEW BOEING MOVED ITS HEADQUARTERS FROM
SEATTLE, THE ONLY HOME THE COMPANY HAD EVER

00:12:07.699 --> 00:12:12.249
KNOWN, TO CHICAGO.

00:12:12.249 --> 00:12:22.139
IT BEGAN SLASHING INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH,
IN ORDER TO CUT COSTS AND MAXIMISE WALL STREET

00:12:22.139 --> 00:12:23.139
RETURNS.

00:12:23.139 --> 00:12:28.569
CYNTHIA COLE / Former Boeing engineer: I felt
it was wrong, I felt it was going to take

00:12:28.569 --> 00:12:31.049
the company in the wrong

00:12:31.049 --> 00:12:37.310
direction and I thought that quality would
suffer and the integrity of the product would

00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:38.310
suffer.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:47.420
KEVIN SANDERS / Former Boeing manager: I feel
that that legacy and that history and that

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.120
competence has been

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:54.430
hijacked by a bunch of corporate thugs.

00:12:54.430 --> 00:13:00.959
BY 2003, IT WAS TIME TO LAUNCH A NEW PLANE.

00:13:00.959 --> 00:13:05.930
BUT BOEING'S NEW BOARD WAS RELUCTANT TO INVEST
THE BILLIONS NEEDED.

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:12.819
DOMINIC GATES / Seattle Times: The board made
it clear that they wanted this plane made

00:13:12.819 --> 00:13:14.369
for less money.

00:13:14.369 --> 00:13:15.369
They

00:13:15.369 --> 00:13:21.239
wanted it made for $5 billion and they wanted
partners to come in and pay the rest.

00:13:21.239 --> 00:13:24.660
ABW-002/ 9:35
Richard Aboulafia: It's expensive.

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:26.432
So how do you make that happen?

00:13:26.432 --> 00:13:28.119
Well, you promise them that you can do it
for

00:13:28.119 --> 00:13:33.199
less / and then worry about the consequences
later.

00:13:33.199 --> 00:13:36.980
BOEING CAME UP WITH A PLAN TO SAVE ITSELF
MONEY.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:40.989
IT WOULD PUSH THE COSTS ONTO ITS MAJOR SUPPLIERS.

00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:48.149
BOEING WOULD CALL THEM PARTNERS – AND THEY
WOULD DESIGN AND PAY FOR THE PARTS THEY BUILT.

00:13:48.149 --> 00:13:51.319
BOEING'S JOB WOULD BE TO ASSEMBLE THE PLANE.

00:13:51.319 --> 00:13:58.319
GATES: It was almost as if at times you thought
Boeing executives believed, well, maybe they

00:13:58.319 --> 00:13:59.319
could sit in Chicago

00:13:59.319 --> 00:14:03.179
and have / other companies / do things, and
they would just rake in the money somehow

00:14:03.179 --> 00:14:04.850
by putting it all together

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:10.209
and putting a Boeing sticker on it at the
end.

00:14:10.209 --> 00:14:25.829
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE, BOEING ROLLED OUT THE DREAMLINER
ON SUNDAY JULY THE 8TH 2007, 7-8-7.

00:14:25.829 --> 00:14:33.290
Tom Brokaw: Airlines with us today have made
a big commitment to Boeing and to this airplane.

00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:34.290
So far they have

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:36.329
ordered 677 of them.

00:14:36.329 --> 00:14:44.260
ABOULAFIA: I think in a lot of ways, July
8, 2007 was one of the more magical moments

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.779
I've seen in the industry…

00:14:45.779 --> 00:14:51.279
Brokaw: Watching us live around the world,
broadcasting I'm told in 45 countries in 9

00:14:51.279 --> 00:14:53.689
languages for the premier of

00:14:53.689 --> 00:14:58.339
this very exciting Boeing 787 Dreamliner.

00:14:58.339 --> 00:15:05.980
GATES: We were all inside the factory with
artificial lighting, big stage, Tom Brokaw,

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.290
huge screens…

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:09.519
Then they

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:13.670
opened the doors of this giant assembly bay…

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:17.470
ABOULAFIA: And in rolls this beautiful, beautiful
aircraft.

00:15:17.470 --> 00:15:24.240
GATES: And there it is, sitting in the sun
and we all stream outside and we all touch

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.899
it and none of us noticed.

00:15:27.899 --> 00:15:28.899
Smile!

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:33.550
ABOULAFIA: And I'm reassured by the executives
involved that it's going to fly within two

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:34.550
months.

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.550
One, two, three.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:39.410
JON OSTROWER / Wall Street Journal
What I realized walking around it is that

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:47.309
you could look up in the wheel well and you
could see daylight.

00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:54.769
GATES: We learned that the whole thing was
a sham.

00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:59.709
MIKE BAIR / 787 Program Manager: Beautiful
isn't it?

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:00.939
Absolutely beautiful…

00:16:00.939 --> 00:16:05.339
GATES: They rolled out this fake airplane.

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:08.489
OSTROWER: I realized the doors were made of
plywood.

00:16:08.489 --> 00:16:13.779
GATES: This plane that we were admiring was
completely a shell inside

00:16:13.779 --> 00:16:18.829
JAMES MCNERNEY / BOEING CEO: None of this
would be possible, of course, without exceptional

00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:19.829
leadership.

00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:24.759
ABOULAFIA: There's only two conclusions you
can draw: You have executives there who are

00:16:24.759 --> 00:16:26.590
either lying, in which

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:29.519
case they are completely clueless because
they are going to get caught in two months,

00:16:29.519 --> 00:16:30.519
or you have a complete

00:16:30.519 --> 00:16:35.339
disconnect between the people who are working
on the plane, the engineers, and the executives

00:16:35.339 --> 00:16:36.399
who are saying this.

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:43.589
MCNERNEY: And so to each and every member
of the 787 global team, I say, 'Thank you,

00:16:43.589 --> 00:16:45.299
congratulations, and keep up

00:16:45.299 --> 00:16:46.490
the great work.'

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:54.459
SANDERS: More than any other single event
it was the big lie, and it was a statement

00:16:54.459 --> 00:16:56.389
that the Boeing Company is

00:16:56.389 --> 00:17:03.919
now all about the big lie.

00:17:03.919 --> 00:17:10.339
THE DAY AFTER THE ROLLOUT, WALL STREET PUSHED
BOEING STOCK TO A TEN YEAR HIGH.

00:17:10.339 --> 00:17:18.250
BUT IT WAS ALL ABOUT TO UNRAVEL, AS REVEALED
IN BOEING'S INVESTOR CALLS.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:28.932
Hello and welcome to our quarterly update
on the 787 program.

00:17:28.932 --> 00:17:31.110
SEPTEMBER 2007: BOEING ANNOUNCES ITS FIRST
DELAY.

00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:34.282
MIKE BAIR: It's not a failure in how the airplane
goes together.

00:17:34.282 --> 00:17:37.930
It's just a really complicated puzzle."

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:45.760
OCTOBER 2007: THE THREE-MONTH DELAY BECOMES
SIX MONTHS.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.400
JIM MCNERNEY: We wish we didn't have to do
this.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:54.050
New kinds of innovation present challenges
and we're doing our

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:55.520
best to meet them.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.470
OCTOBER 2009: SIX MONTHS BECOMES TWO YEARS
OF DELAYS.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:05.600
JIM MCNERNEY: We know that we can and must
do better.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.420
And I'm confident that despite our setbacks
we will get the

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:14.714
787 through the flight test program and into
the hands of our customers.

00:18:14.714 --> 00:18:18.770
GATES: It just kept getting worse and worse
and it seemed unbelievable.

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:22.060
You have to understand, this was

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:23.060
unprecedented.

00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.810
There had never been a Boeing delay in a Boeing
program.

00:18:25.810 --> 00:18:31.570
ABOULAFIA: The sequence of events looked an
awful lot like a catastrophe rather than just

00:18:31.570 --> 00:18:36.490
a manageable series of

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:40.140
delays.

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.850
THE DREAMLINER BUSINESS STRATEGY WAS BACKFIRING.

00:18:44.850 --> 00:18:50.180
DESIGNED TO SAVE SO MUCH MONEY, IT WAS COSTING
BOEING BILLIONS.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:55.370
GATES: The outsourcing plan failed very badly.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:58.140
/ All these different suppliers who were going
to / build these

00:18:58.140 --> 00:19:10.110
major sections couldn't actually do it.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:15.900
TO FIX THE DREAMLINER, BOEING DISPATCHED HUNDREDS
OF QUALITY INSPECTORS TO STRUGGLING SUPPLIERS

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.900
AROUND THE GLOBE

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:20.550
INCLUDING TO ITS PARTNER ALENIA - IN SOUTHERN
ITALY.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:26.740
Riccardo Busca / Alenia plant manager: We
are just working through the final part of

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:27.740
the process.

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:33.070
ALENIA WOULD TAKE ON THE TASK OF CONSTRUCTING
THE BODY OF THE PLANE - NOT WITH ALUMINIUM

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.070
PANELS…

00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:35.070
BUT WITH COMPOSITE

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.130
PLASTIC BARRELS.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:45.510
THE MAIN OBJECTIVE: TO LOSE WEIGHT, SAVING
FUEL AND MAKING THE 787 CHEAPER TO RUN.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:51.200
BUT NO ONE HAD EVER MADE ANYTHING LIKE THIS
BEFORE, NOT BOEING, AND ESPECIALLY NOT ALENIA.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.200
Busca: There is nothing comparable with that
on the market.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.830
Will: there's nothing built like this.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:03.770
BOEING'S QUALITY INSPECTORS HAVE ONE OVERRIDING
PRIORITY, TO MAKE SURE THE JOB IS DONE CORRECTLY.

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:11.290
IN 2009, WHEN INSPECTORS FOUND FLAWS IN PARTS
MADE IN THIS ALENIA PLANT, THEY ORDERED WORK

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:12.300
TO STOP.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:19.030
A YEAR LATER, IN ALENIA'S OTHER FACTORY THEY
AGAIN FOUND SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND AGAIN THEY

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:20.940
ORDERED WORK TO STOP.

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:26.190
BUT THIS TIME, MANAGERS OVERRULED THE QUALITY
INSPECTORS.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:32.530
THIS INTERNAL BOEING DOCUMENT, FROM 2010,
REVEALS EXECUTIVES ORDERED ALENIA TO "CONTINUE

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:33.740
WITH FABRICATION…

00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:34.740
WITHOUT

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:35.740
DELAY."

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.140
DONATO AMOROSO / ALENIA COO: We followed at
the time the procedure to stop but with the

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.770
help of a Boeing specialist

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:45.390
at the time and while we were in the disapproved
condition they took responsibility for approving

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:46.420
the quality and

00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:51.030
we will continue to work in engineering at
the time the product.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:57.390
IN THIS SEPARATE MEMO, OBTAINED BY AL JAZEERA,
BOEING STATES THAT "SCHEDULE MAY REQUIRE DEVIATIONS

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.390
TO THE PREFERRED

00:20:58.390 --> 00:21:00.040
QUALITY PROCESS".

00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.690
WE RECEIVED THE MEMOS FROM AN ENGINEER WHO,
LIKE MANY WE SPOKE WITH, WAS AFRAID TO APPEAR

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:06.990
ON CAMERA.

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:08.501
SO HE ANSWERED MY QUESTIONS BY EMAIL.

00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:09.501
SOURCE: They changed basic engineering principles
to meet schedule…

00:21:09.501 --> 00:21:10.501
We all protested.

00:21:10.501 --> 00:21:38.039
…Would you fly on a plane that you knew
was built with major flaws?

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:44.280
THE QUALITY ENGINEER TOLD US DEVIATING FROM
THE PROCESS COMPROMISED SAFETY.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.470
ALENIA AND BOEING SAID IT DID NOT.

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:48.580
CYNTHIA COLE: 6,7,8,9,10…

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.320
SO I BROUGHT THE MEMO TO THE FORMER PRESIDENT
OF BOEING'S ENGINEERS UNION.

00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.810
Cynthia Cole: So My name is Cynthia Cole,
C-y-n-t-h-i-a.

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:58.240
Last name is C-o-l-e.

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:05.741
CYNTHIA COLE SPENT 32 YEARS AT THE COMPANY
BUT NEVER ON THE DREAMLINER PROGRAMME, SO

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:07.760
SHE HAD NEVER SEEN THIS MEMO

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.170
BEFORE.

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:19.460
COLE: The program schedule may require deviation
to the preferred process.

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:20.870
See?

00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:21.920
That one sentence right there,

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:28.750
that one fragment of the sentence / You know,
you don't change your quality process for

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.960
schedule.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960
You make quality

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.250
happen in the schedule.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:39.100
// They're shortchanging the engineering process
to meet a schedule and they're not even

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:43.290
allowing quality control to do their job and
their telling them this is how it's going

00:22:43.290 --> 00:22:44.290
to be.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:45.290
// I don't see how

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:50.050
these people who write these things and agree
to these things, you know, and the signatures

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:51.440
down here, how they

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:52.490
sleep at night.

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.170
I just don't get it.

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.860
How can you do that?

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.730
// As an engineer I find that reprehensible.

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:05.440
Male Voice: How does it make you feel as a
flyer?

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.140
Oh, yeah.

00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.290
I'm not flying on a 787.

00:23:08.290 --> 00:23:10.460
That just makes, you know…

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.330
Because I've been kind of avoiding flying
on a 787

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:17.950
and seeing this, I would definitely avoid
flying on a 787.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:25.350
TEASE: IN PART TWO – INSIDE A BOEING 787
PLANT, WORKERS REVEAL THEY FEAR TO FLY THE

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:34.330
PLANE THEY BUILD.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:49.880
IF THE DREAMLINER REPRESENTS BOEING'S FUTURE,
THEN I'VE COME TO THE PLACE WHERE THAT FUTURE

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.690
WILL BE BUILT.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:24:02.510
IN THIS ASSEMBLY PLANT IN CHARLESTON, SOUTH
CAROLINA.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:12.250
I'VE BEEN CALLED TO A MEETING WITH A MAN WHO
WORKS INSIDE THE PLANT.

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:16.360
HE'S TAKING A HUGE RISK EVEN TALKING TO ME.

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:23.920
SOURCE: It's been eating me alive to know
what I know, and have no avenue, no venue

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.610
to say anything.

00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:29.800
AT HIS REQUEST, WE USED A DIFFERENT VOICE.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:37.200
SOURCE: 300 souls on the plane / their lives
/ it's bigger than me.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.400
WE HAD SEEN REPORTS OF BAD WORKMANSHIP IN
THE PLANT.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.020
BUT THE MAN CLAIMED THE PROBLEMS GO FAR DEEPER.

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:49.980
SOURCE: With all the problems reported on
the 787 / there's 90 percent that's getting

00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.310
swept away…hushed up.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:54.310
/ It's

00:24:54.310 --> 00:25:01.820
an iceberg.

00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:09.390
SOURCE: The people that actually work on it
are the biggest problem.

00:25:09.390 --> 00:25:12.130
// there is / an uneducated, under-skilled

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:16.400
and uncaring staff that are building these
planes and I'm not the only one that feels

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.730
that way.

00:25:17.730 --> 00:25:23.640
AND HE WAS PREPARED TO PROVE IT, WEARING A
CAMERA INSIDE THE PLANT TO RECORD WHAT SOME

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.280
WORKERS SAID ABOUT THE

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.460
DREAMLINER.

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:40.580
UC PLANT WORKER 1: … They hire these people
off the street dude.

00:25:40.580 --> 00:25:50.000
Working, fucking flipping burgers for a living
or

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.710
making sandwiches at subway…

00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:59.090
SOURCE: You can't have somebody from McDonald's
do heart surgery.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:01.780
/ That's trusting somebody with your life.

00:26:01.780 --> 00:26:03.210
That's what we're doing here.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:12.150
UC PLANT WORKER 2: The thing about it is,
they don't realize the seriousness of putting

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:13.830
something together and

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.060
putting it together right.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:25.000
Because if this fucker breaks, it can't come
over to the curb, it's gonna come down.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.150
SOURCE: I've seen a lot of things that should
not go on at an airplane plant… / people

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:31.430
talking about doing drugs,

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:32.430
looking for drugs…

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:33.430
UC PLANT WORKER 3: It's all coke and, um,
painkillers and, what's the other one…

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.880
You can get weed here, you can get

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.700
some really good weed here.

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.880
SOURCE: Really, like in the plant?

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.970
WORKER 3: Yeah.

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.250
SOURCE: Like there's somebody who has it right
now?

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:47.160
I could walk up to them and just…

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:51.530
WORKER 3: No, I don't know if they have it
right here.

00:26:51.530 --> 00:26:53.720
You've got to place your order.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.900
SOURCE: You gotta place your order.

00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:01.510
SOURCE: I have never seen anybody or heard
of anybody having to take a random urinalysis.

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.010
As far as I know random

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:04.910
drugs tests just don't happen.

00:27:04.910 --> 00:27:08.470
UC PLANT WORKER 2: they don't drug test nobody.

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.050
SOURCE: I know they don't.

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:17.500
WORKER 2: There's people that go out there
on lunch and smoke one up.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:19.100
SOURCE: Do they?

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.230
WORKER 2: Hell yea.

00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.430
SOURCE: You know for a fact.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:26.560
WORKER 2: Hell yeah.

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:32.450
WHEN BOEING FIRST ANNOUNCED THE 787, BACK
IN 2003, NOBODY EVER DREAMT IT WOULD HAVE

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.150
BEEN ASSEMBLED ANYWHERE BUT

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.140
WASHINGTON STATE.

00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.950
THE ONE PLACE BOEING HAD ALWAYS MADE ITS COMMERCIAL
AIRCRAFT.

00:27:41.950 --> 00:27:46.200
BUT NEW BOEING WAS PLAYING BY NEW RULES.

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:53.700
SO IT DID SOMETHING IT HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
- AUCTIONED OFF FINAL ASSEMBLY TO THE HIGHEST

00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:54.930
BIDDER.

00:27:54.930 --> 00:27:59.450
DOMINIC GATES: They were going to hold a competition
for it.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:02.680
/ A state against state, nationwide competition,

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.780
where to build this plane.

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:13.340
I ran to my editor after I put the phone down,
I think it was 5:00, and I said, "You're

00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:14.513
not going to believe this.

00:28:14.513 --> 00:28:17.640
They're not necessarily going to build it
here."

00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:23.520
WASHINGTON STATE WON, BUT ONLY BY GIVING BOEING
WHAT WAS THEN A RECORD THREE BILLION DOLLARS

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.309
IN TAX BREAKS.

00:28:25.309 --> 00:28:26.380
"Power!

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:28.530
Union Power!

00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:30.670
Union Power!

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:32.820
Union Power!"

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:39.690
FIVE YEARS LATER, BOEING'S MACHINISTS WALKED
OFF THE JOB AFTER CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS STALLED.

00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:47.390
THE STRIKE COST BOEING BILLIONS AND ADDED
TO THE DREAMLINER'S DELAYS.

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:52.590
BOEING STOCK WAS IN A FREEFALL, AMID A GLOBAL
ECONOMIC CRISIS.

00:28:52.590 --> 00:29:00.360
GATES: … that strike / really enraged the
top executives at Boeing.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:04.570
And so / early in 2009 they made it very

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:09.980
clear that they wanted a second assembly line
somewhere else.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.510
THAT TURNED OUT TO BE SOUTH CAROLINA.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:19.730
THE STATE OFFERED CHEAP LAND AND LABOR … CLOSE
TO ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN SUPPORT…

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:21.950
AND NO UNIONS.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:30.990
GATES: The decision to build the second 787
assembly line in Charleston, South Carolina/

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:32.220
was made because of the

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.910
strike in 2008.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.830
/ They wanted to do it there because they
wanted to weaken the union, and they did.

00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:40.860
SORSCHER: It kind of has a shameless feel
to it, right?

00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:44.450
It's very manipulative and not very hometown.

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:45.450
That's not

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:50.920
the way you treat your people in your community,
unless they're not in your community, unless

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.170
you see them as a

00:29:52.170 --> 00:29:58.970
source of gains to be extracted.

00:29:58.970 --> 00:30:04.150
BUT FOR BOEING, LEAVING BEHIND A WORLD-CLASS
UNION WORKFORCE FOR THE GREENER PASTURES OF

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:06.190
NON-UNION CHARLESTON WOULD

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:08.150
COME AT A PRICE.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:20.810
WORK IN THE PLANT IS SIGNIFICANTLY BEHIND
SCHEDULE AND PLAGUED BY PRODUCTION ERRORS.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:33.061
Repair worker: I seen some crazy stuff, ya
know, putting fasteners and just beatin' the

00:30:33.061 --> 00:30:34.061
shit out of em to get em

00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:35.061
to go in the hole.

00:30:35.061 --> 00:30:37.560
SOURCE: I know of one customer / They'll no
longer accept planes from Charleston due to

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.830
quality issues.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:40.830
They will

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:44.300
only accept final assembly done in Everett,
Washington.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:48.880
SOURCE: Everyday when you go to work, not
only are you doing your job, but you are looking

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.000
at the previous job to

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.680
see if someone has messed something else up
on that and chose not to tell anyone.

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.480
UC PLANT WORKER 4: That machine malfunctioned
in there.

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.170
Fucked those holes up.

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:02.130
And they just went ahead and filled

00:31:02.130 --> 00:31:03.130
them.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:08.470
And I've gone ahead and told managers about
that and nothing has been done.

00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:09.470
Nothing.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:14.050
TO BE SURE EVERYTHING IS DONE CORRECTLY AND
THE PLANE IS SAFE, BOEING HAS QUALITY ASSURANCE

00:31:14.050 --> 00:31:15.050
INSPECTORS

00:31:15.050 --> 00:31:19.020
PAINSTAKINGLY CHECK EVERY STEP OF THE WORK.

00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:24.211
BUT IN SOUTH CAROLINA, THIS INSPECTOR SAYS
HE ONLY SIGNS OFF ON FINISHED JOBS.

00:31:24.211 --> 00:31:25.211
UC PLANT WORKER 5: Here you will do the whole
job and we just final it.

00:31:25.211 --> 00:31:28.260
You know and I'm supposed to verify that

00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:33.640
oh, you checked the hole, you did the sealant,
you put in the fastener.

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.560
I never saw all that.

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.100
But I'm supposed to

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:39.790
final it and say that it's good.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:42.480
That's one of the problems I have.

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.400
SOURCE: you think Everett's better?

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:50.930
UC PLANT WORKER 2: I think Everett will do
what's right, to make the plane right because

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:52.850
of the union, they have

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:53.850
to.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:58.230
/ Here everybody is being pushed to meet this
fucking schedule regardless of quality.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:08.590
Will: which do you think is the priority then,
schedule or quality?

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:15.880
SOURCE: Schedule.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:22.210
IF IT'S A CONSTANT BATTLE BETWEEN QUALITY
AND SCHEDULE, WE FOUND ONE CASUALTY - 100'S

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:23.250
OF KILOMETERS FROM SOUTH

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.200
CAROLINA -- IN MISSISSIPPI.

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:38.670
JOHN WOODS / Former Boeing engineer: My name
is John Woods, I'm an aerospace engineer.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:41.480
I worked for General

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:49.150
Electric, Lockheed, Boeing.

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:56.050
JOHN WOODS SPENT A CAREER IN THE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED
FIELD OF AEROSPACE COMPOSITES.

00:32:56.050 --> 00:33:02.220
BOEING HIRED WOODS KNOWING HE HAD QUALIFIED
PSCHIATRIC CONDITIONS - ATTENTION DEFICIT

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:04.650
DISORDER, OBSESSIVE

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.330
COMPULSIVE DISORDER, AND MILD DEPRESSION.

00:33:07.330 --> 00:33:13.660
HIS JOB WAS TO WRITE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO
REPAIR PARTS DAMAGED DURING THE MANUFACTURING

00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:14.660
PROCESS.

00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:24.890
WOODS: It's my job to make sure that that
aircraft is safe.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:29.760
WOODS SAYS WHEN HE TRIED TO ENFORCE QUALITY
STANDARDS IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA PLANT HE WAS

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:31.870
BERATED BY HIS BOSSES.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:42.860
WOODS: In a couple of meetings, there were
several, a group of managers screaming at

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.330
me to dumb down my work

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:46.330
instruction.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:49.350
// saying, you have to remove requirements
from your work instructions.

00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:54.030
It's going to take too much

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:55.490
time.

00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:01.400
WOODS SAYS HE WITNESSED DAMAGED PARTS BEING
IGNORED, PAPERED OVER AND HIDDEN FROM VIEW.

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:06.530
WOODS: There's no doubt there are bad repairs
going out the door on the 787 aircraft.//

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:07.809
I am worried that sooner

00:34:07.809 --> 00:34:20.350
or later, there's going to be a structural
failure on the fuselage.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:25.089
WOODS APPEALED TO BOEING'S HUMAN RESOURCES
DEPARTMENT CLAIMING HE WAS BEING HARASSED

00:34:25.089 --> 00:34:27.519
FOR DOING HIS JOB.

00:34:27.519 --> 00:34:33.009
INSTEAD OF COMING TO HIS DEFENSE, BOEING MANAGERS
PUT WOODS UNDER REVIEW.

00:34:33.009 --> 00:34:35.369
WEEKS LATER, THEY FIRED HIM.

00:34:35.369 --> 00:34:38.929
WOODS: I'll never forget this.

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:45.829
The day before I was terminated, I was telling
my brother how proud I was to be

00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:48.089
working at Boeing.

00:34:48.089 --> 00:34:49.599
It's true.

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:55.639
WOODS: So instead of saying thanks for doing
a good job, because I thought I was doing

00:34:55.639 --> 00:34:57.859
what I was supposed to be

00:34:57.859 --> 00:34:59.039
doing.

00:34:59.039 --> 00:35:06.950
/ I had to leave in shame really.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:22.529
I was embarrassed for my own family.

00:35:22.529 --> 00:35:28.599
HE STILL HAD NOT LOST FAITH IN THE SYSTEM.

00:35:28.599 --> 00:35:35.599
HE TURNED TO THE FAA - FILING A WHISTLEBLOWER
COMPLAINT.

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:40.119
THE DOCUMENT ALLEGED SEVEN SERIOUS VIOLATIONS
IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA PLANT.

00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:44.490
MARY SCHIAVO / Former Inspector General, USDOT:
So I've gotten to the page where they reached

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:45.650
their conclusions

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:50.430
and their discussion and what they found is,
of all the allegations, all but one of them

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:51.430
they could not

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:55.589
substantiate and the one that they could substantiate,
they asked Boeing to fix it.

00:35:55.589 --> 00:35:56.920
Boeing said, "Okay, we fixed

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.920
it."

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.529
And then they closed the investigation.

00:35:59.529 --> 00:36:01.299
That's pretty much how they all go.

00:36:01.299 --> 00:36:03.930
I've seen this so many times.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:19.069
Woods in coffee shop: "thank you"
SCHIAVO: I always tell people, when they call

00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:22.109
me, they call me up with information and they
say, "Well, I have all

00:36:22.109 --> 00:36:23.910
this information about this dangerous situation.

00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:25.309
Should I blow the whistle?"

00:36:25.309 --> 00:36:27.180
I said, "Well, you know, not unless

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:33.089
you have a private trust fund or another job
to go to because you'll have a problem earning

00:36:33.089 --> 00:36:34.089
a living."

00:36:34.089 --> 00:36:45.520
WOODS: I had to maximize all my credit cards
to survive, to support the family.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:49.020
There was a lot less money for the

00:36:49.020 --> 00:37:00.819
kids, for college and everything else.

00:37:00.819 --> 00:37:09.690
/ It shouldn't be this hard to do the right
thing.

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:17.230
WHEN WE LOOKED AT WOODS' FAA COMPLAINT, WE
NOTICED A FAMILIAR NAME -- ALI BAHRAMI.

00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:21.869
HE WAS THE FAA'S MAN IN CHARGE OF THE DREAMLINER.

00:37:21.869 --> 00:37:29.329
IN 2011, THREE YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE, BOEING
CELEBRATED FINAL APPROVAL FOR THE 787 TO FLY.

00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:32.470
AND IT WAS BAHRAMI WHO SIGNED THE ORDER.

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:39.700
Fancher at Certification Party: "Thanks also
in recognition for Ali Bahrami, manager of

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.119
the FAA's transport

00:37:41.119 --> 00:37:42.519
airplane directive.

00:37:42.519 --> 00:37:46.220
Ali …"
IT WAS BAHRAMI WHO SIGNED OFF ON THE DREAMLINER

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:48.010
BATTERIES.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:53.739
AND AFTER TWO FAILED AND THE FAA GROUNDED
THE DREAMLINER … IT WAS BAHRAMI WHO SIGNED

00:37:53.739 --> 00:37:56.730
IT BACK INTO THE AIR.

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:00.210
SHORTLY AFTER THAT HE RETIRED FROM THE FAA.

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:06.431
TWO WEEKS LATER BAHRAMI WAS HIRED AS VICE-PRESIDENT
OF THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRIES ASSOCIATION, WHICH

00:38:06.431 --> 00:38:07.431
LOBBIES ON

00:38:07.431 --> 00:38:09.960
BEHALF OF BOEING.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:15.680
ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS HE DID WAS TO APPEAR
BEFORE CONGRESS TO CALL FOR GREATER SELF-REGULATION

00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.079
FOR COMPANIES LIKE

00:38:17.079 --> 00:38:18.079
BOEING.

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:22.299
Ali Bahrami / Congressional hearing: ‘We
urge the FAA to allow greater use of delegation,

00:38:22.299 --> 00:38:23.339
not only to take full

00:38:23.339 --> 00:38:29.690
advantage of industry expertise, but to increase
the collaboration that improves aviation safety."

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:30.690
MR.

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:33.200
BAHRAMI DECLINED OUR INTERVIEW REQUEST.

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.229
SCHIAVO: One day you're regulating the airline
and the next day you're working for it.

00:38:38.229 --> 00:38:40.239

You can't possibly be tough on the industry

00:38:40.239 --> 00:38:43.859
that you're regulating because you'll never
get that plum job after you

00:38:43.859 --> 00:38:44.859
leave.

00:38:44.859 --> 00:38:48.420
The regulators at the FAA will rarely cross
Boeing.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:51.920
They simply won't.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.670
IT'S THE WASHINGTON INFLUENCE GAME - AND BOEING
IS A MASTER.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:39:02.000
LAST YEAR, THE COMPANY HAD OVER 100 REGISTERED
LOBBYISTS, 78 OF THEM WERE FORMER GOVERNMENT

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.130
WORKERS.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.339
THREE WERE FORMER MEMBERS OF CONGRESS.

00:39:06.339 --> 00:39:11.769
BOEING CHIEF EXECUTIVE JIM MCNERNEY IS CHAIRMAN
OF PRESIDENT OBAMA'S EXPORT COUNCIL.

00:39:11.769 --> 00:39:17.089
THE PRESIDENT'S FORMER CHIEF OF STAFF CAME
FROM BOEING'S BOARD, AS DID HIS SECOND COMMERCE

00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:18.749
SECRETARY.

00:39:18.749 --> 00:39:24.441
AS SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY CLINTON HELPED
BROKER A 3.7 BILLION DOLLAR SALE OF BOEING

00:39:24.441 --> 00:39:25.720
PLANES TO A RUSSIAN

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.720
AIRLINE.

00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.560
EVEN PRESIDENT OBAMA BOASTS THAT HE WORKS
FOR BOEING.

00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:36.549
OBAMA AT BOEING EVENT: "So I tease 'J' ever
time I see him.

00:39:36.549 --> 00:39:39.280
I say, "I deserve a gold watch because I'm
selling your

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.280
stuff all the time."

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:48.320
"J" IS JIM MCNERNEY.

00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.950
IT'S CLEAR WHAT BOEING GETS FROM THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT.

00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:54.690
WHAT'S NOT SO CLEAR IS WHAT IT GIVES BACK.

00:39:54.690 --> 00:40:01.520
SCOTT KLINGER / Think tank analyst: Boeing
paid no taxes in 2013, no federal income taxes.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.520
/ That's not a unique

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:03.520
year.

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.680
Over the last 12 years, they claimed over
$1.6 billion in federal tax refunds even though

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.680
they reported $43

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.680
billion in U.S. profits.

00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:15.779
43 BILLION DOLLARS IN PROFIT.

00:40:15.779 --> 00:40:25.160
BUT NONE OF THAT COMES FROM THE DREAMLINER,
WHICH HAS COST BILLIONS AND IS YEARS AWAY

00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.960
FROM MAKING MONEY.

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:34.140
ALL OF BOEING'S COMMERCIAL PROFIT COMES FROM
OLDER AIRCRAFT – THOSE CREATED PRIOR TO

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.390
THE DREAMLINER, PRIOR TO JIM

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:39.479
MCNERNEY, AND PRIOR TO THE MERGER.

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:46.220
IT HAS BEEN THE TOP EXECUTIVES AND LARGEST
STOCK HOLDERS WHO HAVE BENEFITTED MOST.

00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:51.289
KLINGER: Boeing's CEO, Jim McNerney, made
$27.5 million in 2012.

00:40:51.289 --> 00:40:53.749
That was enough to pay the salaries of the

00:40:53.749 --> 00:40:58.640
president of the United States, the vice president,
the 15 cabinet secretaries, the nine Supreme

00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.640
Court justices,

00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:04.309
the seven joint chiefs of staff, and all 100
U.S. senators.

00:41:04.309 --> 00:41:11.849
MCNERNEY IS SET TO RETIRE WITH A PENSION OF
CLOSE TO 250 THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH.

00:41:11.849 --> 00:41:17.849
JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS 2013, BOEING DEMANDED
PENSION CUTS FROM ITS UNION MACHINISTS.

00:41:17.849 --> 00:41:23.210
SHANNON RYKER / Boeing machinist: For Jim
McNerney to be earning a pension at approximately

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.210
a quarter of a

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:31.749
million dollars per month and think that it's
okay for him to take my $2200 a month pension

00:41:31.749 --> 00:41:32.779
is outrageous.

00:41:32.779 --> 00:41:33.779
It's

00:41:33.779 --> 00:41:36.749
absolutely outrageous.

00:41:36.749 --> 00:41:42.210
BACK IN SOUTH CAROLINA, OUR UNAUTHORIZED TOUR
WITH BOEING'S NEW WORKFORCE IS COMING TO A

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.210
CLOSE.

00:41:43.210 --> 00:41:45.200
THERE'S ONLY ONE QUESTION LEFT TO ASK.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:47.200
SOURCE: Would you fly on one?

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.200
WORKER: um… no.

00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.200
SOURCE: You won't fly on one?

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:53.869
WORKER: Noooooo
SOURCE: Would you fly on one of these planes?

00:41:53.869 --> 00:41:55.530
WORKER: I've thought about it?

00:41:55.530 --> 00:42:00.859
I thought about it… no not really
SOURCE: Would you fly on one of these mother

00:42:00.859 --> 00:42:01.859
f**kers?

00:42:01.859 --> 00:42:02.859
WORKER: Probably not.

00:42:02.859 --> 00:42:04.859
SOURCE: Would you fly on one of these?

00:42:04.859 --> 00:42:06.200
WORKER: Yeah it's sketchy.

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.200
SOURCE: Sketchy?

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:11.200
Yeah I probably would, but I kind of have
a death wish too.

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.210
(laugh)
OUR SOURCE ASKED FIFTEEN OF HIS CO-WORKERS

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:17.849
IF THEY'D FLY ON THE DREAMLINER.

00:42:17.849 --> 00:42:20.749
TEN SAID NO.

00:42:20.749 --> 00:42:29.430
UC WORKER 2: I wouldn't fly on one of these
planes (shaking his head).

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:30.500
SOURCE: You wouldn't?

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.560
Why wouldn't you?

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:32.630
WORKER 2: Huh?

00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:34.050
SOURCE: Why wouldn't ya?

00:42:34.050 --> 00:42:38.819
WORKER 2: Because I see the quality of the
fucking shit going down around here.

00:42:38.819 --> 00:42:41.079
"Hi Mr. Loftis, Will Jordan"
"I'm sorry, Will?"

00:42:41.079 --> 00:42:44.880
"Will Jordan"
WORKERS WHO FEAR TO FLY THE PLANE THEY BUILD…

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:49.029
QUALITY PROCESS APPARENTLY LOOSENED TO SPEED
UP SCHEDULE…

00:42:49.029 --> 00:42:51.650
WORKERS FIRED AFTER MAKING SAFETY ALLEGATIONS…

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.270
WE NEEDED ANSWERS FROM BOEING.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:43:00.259
Larry Loftis: Right now we're at a very exciting
point in time, we have brought our production

00:43:00.259 --> 00:43:01.339
rate up to 10

00:43:01.339 --> 00:43:06.319
airplanes a month, faster than any airplane
in aviation history and to the highest level

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:07.550
of any wide-body airplane

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:08.550
in aviation history.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:11.809
Will Jordan: There's a couple of documents
I want to show you here.

00:43:11.809 --> 00:43:16.450
I SHOWED HIM THE DOCUMENTS SUGGESTING BOEING
HAD CHANGED QUALITY PROCEDURES AND OVERRULED

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:18.470
INSPECTORS TO SPEED UP

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:19.520
PRODUCTION.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.430
MR LOFTIS WAS NOT MANAGER OF THE 787 PROGRAMME
IN 2010, WHEN THE MEMOS WERE WRITTEN.

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:26.710
Larry Loftis: OK I am not familiar with this
document.

00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:31.789
Will Jordan: Former Boeing engineers have
told us that these represent Boeing essentially

00:43:31.789 --> 00:43:33.970
putting schedule ahead of

00:43:33.970 --> 00:43:34.970
quality.

00:43:34.970 --> 00:43:38.000
Short-changing the engineering process to
meet a schedule.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.030
Is that something you recognize?

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:45.410
Larry Loftis: The number one focus that we
have at Boeing is ensuring the continued safe

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:46.499
airworthiness of an

00:43:46.499 --> 00:43:51.630
airplane, the integrity of the airplane and
the quality of the airplane going out.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:58.140
Will Jordan: We've also heard directly from
workers inside your South Carolina plant.

00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.700
They paint a grim picture

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:00.700
really of things there.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.170
They say the workforce isn't up to the job.

00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:08.359
Larry Loftis: I'm extremely confident in the
quality of the workforce in Boeing South Carolina.

00:44:08.359 --> 00:44:12.990
Will Jordan: The Boeing workers at South Carolina
don't share that confidence.

00:44:12.990 --> 00:44:14.160
Here's what some of them said.

00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.160
…
Paul Lewis: Guys, Guys, Guys.

00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.109
I'm gonna just call a halt here for a second.

00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:20.820
Can you turn the camera off for a

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:21.820
secon?

00:44:21.820 --> 00:44:23.470
Cameraman: Why would we need to turn the camera
off?

00:44:23.470 --> 00:44:24.530
What's the problem?

00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:28.119
AND THEN, BOEING'S COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR
STOPPED THE INTERVIEW.

00:44:28.119 --> 00:44:32.740
Paul Lewis: So who are these employees that
you're speaking to in South Carolina that

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:33.920
are making these points?

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.660
Will Jordan: I can't, Obviously I can't tell
you who these employees are, but they are

00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:39.869
Boeing workers who assemble

00:44:39.869 --> 00:44:41.239
the planes that you build.

00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:44.089
Paul Lewis: Well I'm not sure it's appropriate
here and now.

00:44:44.089 --> 00:44:49.710
Will Jordan: Well I'm assuming the buck stops
with the Boeing Commercial Airplanes management

00:44:49.710 --> 00:44:51.400
and so the most

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.229
senior managers are the ones to answer this.

00:44:54.229 --> 00:44:58.430
We're here with the head of the 787 programme.

00:44:58.430 --> 00:44:59.700
/ And we have these

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:03.440
things that you need to hear and you need
to provide a response to.

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:08.430
Paul Lewis: We have not had a chance to review
this or craft a proper response.

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:14.509
Paul Lewis: Larry, Larry, can you step out
for a second?

00:45:14.509 --> 00:45:15.509
Larry: OK but, as I do.

00:45:15.509 --> 00:45:19.339
I have the highest degree of confidence in
the production system we have, with the

00:45:19.339 --> 00:45:28.480
employees we have at the Boeing company and
our supply chain.

00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.309
Thanks.

00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:35.650
BOEING ANSWERED OUR QUESTIONS IN WRITING,
DENYING IT COMPROMISES SAFETY OR QUALITY.

00:45:35.650 --> 00:45:40.589
IT SAID OUR INTERVIEW WAS HOSTILE, UNPROFESSIONAL
AND IN THE WORST TRADITIONS OF TABLOID-STYLE

00:45:40.589 --> 00:45:42.559
TELEVISION NEWS.

00:45:42.559 --> 00:45:47.480
THE COMPANY SAID IT WAS CONFIDENT THAT ITS
BATTERY FIX PREVENTS FAILURES.

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:53.710
BOEING SAYS IT USES ONE, COMMON, FAA-APPROVED
QUALITY SYSTEM FOR THE 787 IN EVERETT AND

00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:55.180
CHARLESTON.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:46:00.369
BOEING NOTED ITS MEMO STATED IT DID NOT SIGNIFY
AUTHORISATION TO SHIP PARTS THAT DON'T MEET

00:46:00.369 --> 00:46:02.869
QUALITY REQUIREMENTS.

00:46:02.869 --> 00:46:07.549
BOEING SAID IT DRUG TESTS IN LINE WITH COMPANY
POLICY AND APPLICABLE LAW.

00:46:07.549 --> 00:46:12.910
THE COMPANY DENIES ANY CUSTOMER HAS SAID THEY
WILL ONLY TAKE PLANES FROM EVERETT.

00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:21.749
AS FOR JOHN WOODS, BOEING SAYS HIS SAFETY
CLAIMS HAVE "NO MERIT".

00:46:21.749 --> 00:46:24.249
TORONTO.

00:46:24.249 --> 00:46:31.749
MAY 18, 2014.

00:46:31.749 --> 00:46:36.519
AIR CANADA CELEBRATES THE DELIVERY OF ITS
FIRST 787.

00:46:36.519 --> 00:46:40.130
THIS IS THE MODERN MARKETING REALITY OF THE
DREAMLINER.

00:46:40.130 --> 00:46:44.559
AIR CANADA EXEC: Today represents a huge milestone
for Air Canada.

00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:46.529
We've been waiting a long time for this

00:46:46.529 --> 00:46:47.529
airplane.

00:46:47.529 --> 00:46:52.729
It's going to allow us to grow in unprecedented
ways.

00:46:52.729 --> 00:46:56.170
PASSENGER: Because when you were eating before
where did you put your iPad?

00:46:56.170 --> 00:46:59.749
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Well I think our passengers
are going to be very receptive of some of

00:46:59.749 --> 00:47:00.749
the new amenities.

00:47:00.749 --> 00:47:01.880
PASSENGER: I just wanna see how for it goes
back.

00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.119
PASSENGER: The windows are huge.

00:47:03.119 --> 00:47:07.680
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: We are just excited because
we really genuinely love this aircraft.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.670
REPORTER: Is there anything else you wanna
add?

00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:11.780
AIR CANADA PILOT: Uh, no we're very, very
happy.

00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:15.509
REPORTER: From a seating point of view how
is it different?

00:47:15.509 --> 00:47:18.089
REPORTER: Are there more restrooms?

00:47:18.089 --> 00:47:21.210
BUT IS THERE ANOTHER REALITY?

00:47:21.210 --> 00:47:23.930
ONE REVEALED BY A BURNING BATTERY.

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:26.220
BY THE WORDS OF THE WORKERS WHO BUILD THE
PLANES.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.470
UC WORKER: We're not building them to fly,
We're building them to sell.

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:30.729
You know what I'm saying?

00:47:30.729 --> 00:47:35.989
BY BOEING'S APPARENT CHANGES TO ITS OWN QUALITY
PROTOCOL.

00:47:35.989 --> 00:47:40.700
BOEING SAYS THE 787 HAS NO MORE PROBLEMS THAN
PREVIOUS MODELS.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:45.670
THE FAA SAYS THERE'S NEVER BEEN A SAFER TIME
TO FLY.

00:47:45.670 --> 00:47:49.869
THE DREAMLINER IS THE FASTEST-SELLING PLANE
IN THE WORLD.

00:47:49.869 --> 00:47:53.980
ONE DAY WE MAY ALL FIND OURSELVES ON BOARD.

00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:57.609
WHEN WE DO, WE WILL TRUST BOEING HAS PUT QUALITY
FIRST;

00:47:57.609 --> 00:48:06.410
WE WILL TRUST THE REGULATORS HAVE BEEN RIGOROUS;
ULTIMATELY, WE WILL TRUST THE PLANE IS SAFE.
