00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:12.020
 Hello all! Today we're going to make an easy easy, simple, simple, but delicious recipe. 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.980
 We call it Oh-mochi, a marinated choice. We'll be using the Korean dressing. 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.300
 It's like salad. 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.480
 With this young man. English choice. 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.540
 I just took it out of the fridge and washed it. 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.320
 That's why it's still cold and fresh 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.857
 It's just like making kimchi. There are many different ways to make this om-mochi. 

00:00:35.857 --> 00:00:40.824
 Today, however, Oh-Mochi is my favorite, several years ago during my trip to Kapchita 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.600
 I made this everywhere. 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.960
 All my readers from Europe and Asia loved it. 

00:00:49.305 --> 00:00:52.025
 Everyone was surprised, how easy. 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.380
 Just like salad and mix everything together, boom. 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.719
 So let's make this video short, let's see! 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.980
 Cut this longitudinally. 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.840
 Wow, what a beautiful color, juicy. 

00:01:10.664 --> 00:01:13.244
 Fresh smell, cucumber. 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.240
 Chop it thin and tilted 

00:01:25.976 --> 00:01:27.736
 Onions, by about a quarter cup. 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.600
 Cut it like this. 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.040
 Then add it here. 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.080
 Green onions one number. 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.060
 Chop it. 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.520
 Then we need garlic. 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.580
 The cutting is over. 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.000
 And then we need to add some spice in here 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.380
 Let's start with soy sauce. 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.400
 I will use two tablespoons of soy sauce. 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:17.380
 two 

00:02:17.922 --> 00:02:20.621
 Two teaspoons of Korean hot pepper flakes 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.600
 We love two 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.500
 This is sesame oil, two teaspoons. One, two. 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.880
 Sesame seeds, two teaspoons. 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.580
 This is optional, but I use a teaspoon of sugar. 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.420
 Doesn't it look great? 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.320
 Let's mix! 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.600
 Very beautiful and shiny. 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.000
 Keep stirring until the sugar dissolves. 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:59.500
 very good. 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:01.140
 is over. 

00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:07.876
 You can make it easily, you have some Korean ingredients and an option 

00:03:08.064 --> 00:03:11.664
 In the fridge just cut it and mix it, that is. 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.400
 It smells so good, everyone loves it. 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.300
 Sesame oil smells really good. 

00:03:25.055 --> 00:03:26.095
 Let me taste it! 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.740
 Hmmmm! 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.460
 (Teeth grinding sound) 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.760
 Mmm! 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:44.830
 Tasty! 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.480
 The cucumber is crunchy, sweet, slightly salty and plenty of sesame oil and garlic flavor 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.140
 This is my favorite side option dish 

00:03:53.314 --> 00:03:57.474
 When you make a grill, this will be the best side dish 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.020
 Because it's just a small hot boost 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.840
 Everyone will love this so it will receive a lot of compliments 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.940
 Enjoy my recipe, see you next time, bye-bye.
