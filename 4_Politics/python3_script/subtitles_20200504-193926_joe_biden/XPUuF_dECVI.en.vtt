00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.540
With our knowledge of torque...
calm down.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.560
With our knowledge of torque
and angular momentum,

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.300
we can now attack rolling
objects which roll down a slope.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.300
For instance, the following...
I have here a cylinder

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.320
or it could be a sphere,
for that matter,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.740
and this angle is beta.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.620
I prefer not to use alpha

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.460
because that's angular
acceleration,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.440
and there is
this friction coefficient

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.500
with the surface, mu,

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.360
and this object
is going to roll down

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.700
and you're going to get
an acceleration

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.840
in this direction, a.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.260
And I will evaluate
the situation

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.000
when we have pure roll.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.080
That means the object is not
skidding and is not slipping.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.000
What is pure roll?

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:11.480
If here is an object, the
cylinder is here with radius R,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.660
and I'm going to rotate it
like this

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:20.600
and roll it in this direction,
the center is called point Q.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.140
Once it has made a complete
rotation,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.780
if then the point Q has moved
over a distance 2pi R,

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.180
then we call that pure roll.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.820
When we have pure roll,
the velocity of this point Q,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.620
and the velocity of
the circumference,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.780
if you can read that--
I'll just put a c there--

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.380
are the same.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.000
In other words, vQ is then
exactly the same

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.860
as v circumference, and v
circumference is always omega R.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.040
This part always holds,
but for pure roll, this holds.

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.240
You can easily imagine that
if there is no friction here,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.560
that the object could be
standing still,

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.900
rotating like crazy,
but Q would not go anywhere.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.240
So then we have skidding
and we have slipping

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.280
and then we don't have
the pure roll situation.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.780
If the object is skidding
or slipping,

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.760
then the friction must always
be a maximum here.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.760
If the object is in pure roll,

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.940
the friction could be
substantially less

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.700
than the maximum
friction possible.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.900
Now I would like to calculate
with you the acceleration

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.920
that a cylinder would obtain.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.100
When it pure rolls
down that slope,

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.800
it has mass M, it has length l
and it has radius R.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.920
And I would like you to use
your intuition

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.140
and don't be afraid
that it's wrong.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.540
I'm going to roll down
this incline two cylinders.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.320
They're both solid,
they have the same mass,

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.860
they have the same length but
they're very different in radii

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.560
and I'm going to have a race
between these two.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.500
Which one will reach
the bottom first?

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.000
So I repeat the problem.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.220
Two cylinders, both solid,
same length, same mass,

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.800
but one has a larger radius
than the other.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:23.940
There's going to be a race.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.160
We're going to roll them down,
pure roll.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.240
Which one will will?

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.920
Win win?

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.000
Will win?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.480
Who thinks that the one with
the largest radius will win?

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.800
Who thinks the large with the
smallest radius will win?

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.120
Who thinks there will be
no winner, no loser?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.180
Wow, your intuition is
better than mine was.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.340
We'll see how it goes.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.480
Keep in mind what your vote was

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.200
and you will see it come out
very shortly.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.800
Okay, let's put all the forces
on this object that we know.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.620
This one is Mg.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.880
And we're going to decompose
that into one a longer slope,

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.780
which is Mg sine beta, and one
perpendicular to the slope.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.860
We have done that
a zill... zillion times now.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.500
And this one
equals Mg cosine beta.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.100
Then there is right here
a normal force,

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.260
and the magnitude of that normal
force is Mg cosine beta,

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.340
so there is no acceleration
in this direction

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.540
and then we have a frictional
force here

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.760
for which I will write F of f.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.560
There is an angular velocity
at any moment in time, omega,

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.980
which will change
with time, no doubt.

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.000
And then this center point Q,
which is the center of mass,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.700
is going to get a velocity v

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:56.220
and that v will also change
with time.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.560
And the v of the point Q
which changes with time

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.580
is v of the circumference,

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.200
because that is the condition
of pure roll.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.420
That equals omega R.

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.000
This is always true, but this is
only true when it is pure roll.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.920
I take the time derivative.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:18.760
The derivative of the velocity
of that point Q

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.000
is, per definition,
its acceleration,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.500
so I get a equals omega dot
times R,

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.240
and that equals alpha R,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.440
alpha being the angular
acceleration.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.100
So this is the condition
for pure roll.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.960
Now I'm going to take the torque
about point Q.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.960
When I take the torque
about point Q,

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.200
N has no effect because it goes
through Q,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.740
and g has no effect
because it goes through Q,

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.720
so there's only one force
that adds to the torque.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.360
If this radius is R,
the magnitude is RF

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:57.580
and the direction is
in the blackboard.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:00.000
But I'm only interested
in the magnitude for now,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.860
so I get R times
the frictional force.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.160
This must be I alpha,

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.920
I being the moment of inertia
for rotation about this axis

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:19.860
through point Q, times alpha,
but I can replace alpha by a/R.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.720
So I get the moment of inertia
about Q times a/R.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.420
And this is my first equation,

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.780
and I have as an unknown
the frictional force,

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.160
and I have as an unknown a,
and so I cannot solve for both.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.840
I need another equation.

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:38.960
The next equation that I have
is an obvious one,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.840
that is Newton's second law:
f = MA.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.520
For the center of mass,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.000
I can consider all the mass
right here at Q.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.240
We must have f = MA.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.480
And so M times the acceleration
of that point Q,

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.700
which is our goal, by the way,

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:05.160
equals this component,
equals Mg sine beta.

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.460
That is the component downhill.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.420
And minus Ff,
the frictional force,

00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:13.140
which is the component uphill,

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.560
and this is
my equation number two.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.260
Now I have two equations
with two unknowns.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.220
So I can solve now.

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.000
I can eliminate Ff and I will
substitute for Ff in here

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.160
this quantity divided by R.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:35.720
And so I get Ma equals
Mg sine beta

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.120
minus moment of inertia
about point Q,

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.060
times a divided by R squared.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:46.060
And now notice that
I've eliminated F of f,

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.740
and so now I can solve for a.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.060
So I'm going to get...
I bring the a's to one side.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:08:01.040
So I get a times M plus moment
of inertia divided by R squared

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:11.000
equals Mg sine beta,
and a now we have.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.260
I multiply both sides
with R squared.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:21.500
I get MR squared g sine beta
upstairs,

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:27.500
and downstairs I get MR squared
plus the moment of inertia

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.420
about that point Q.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:32.920
This is my result, and
all I have to put in now

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.440
is the moment of inertia
of rotation about that axis.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.880
I want to remind you, though,

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:45.340
that it is only true if we have
a situation of pure roll.

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:47.940
So we can now substitute
in there

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:53.740
the values that we have
for a solid cylinder.

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.840
If we have a solid cylinder,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:02.120
then the moment of inertia
about this axis

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.720
through the center of mass,
which I've called Q,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.920
equals 1/2 MR squared.

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.240
And if I substitute that
in here,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:15.720
notice that all my M's...
MR squares go away.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.000
I get 1 + 1/2, which is 1 1/2.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.160
Upside down becomes 2/3.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:28.360
So a = 2/3 times g
times the sine of beta.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.960
There is no M, there is no l
and there is no R.

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.860
So if I have two cylinders,

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.500
solid cylinders
with totally different mass,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:40.060
totally different radii,
totally different length

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:42.760
and they have a race,
neither one wins.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.740
Very nonintuitive.

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:47.480
Every time that I see it
I find it kind of amazing.

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.420
Notice that everything
disappears.

00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:52.580
M, R and l disappear.

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.660
So those of you who said
that if I take two cylinders

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.180
with the same mass,
different radii,

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.580
those of you who said that there
is no winner, there is no loser,

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.480
they were correct.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.220
But even more amazing is that
even the mass you can change.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:09.000
You can change anything as long
as the two cylinders are solid.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.700
That's what matters.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:16.400
So if we take a hollow cylinder,

00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:19.240
then the moment of inertia
about this axis

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:22.000
through the center of mass,
through Q, if this...

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.880
if really most of the mass
is really at the surface,

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.060
then it's very close
to MR squared,

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:31.800
and then the acceleration--

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.200
if I substitute in here
MR squared,

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:39.780
I get a 2 there-- equals
1/2 times g times sine beta.

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.320
So this acceleration
is less than this one.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.880
So the hollow cylinder will lose

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.560
in any race against a solid
cylinder regardless of mass,

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.820
regardless of radius,
regardless of length.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.440
And I want to show that to you.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:04.340
We have a setup here and I'll
try to show that to you also

00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:07.120
on the screen there,

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.060
but for those of you
who are sitting close,

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:11.760
it's probably much better

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:15.700
that you just look at the
demonstration right here.

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:22.780
I have here... ooh.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.620
Uh-uh.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:28.140
I have here to start with a very
heavy cylinder made of brass

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.180
and this one is made
of aluminum.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.540
They have very different masses,
same radii, same length.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.880
Should make no difference.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:38.300
There should be no winner,
there should be no loser.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.000
I'm going to start them off
at the same time.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.260
I hope you can see that there.

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.660
This is... this is
the starting point.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.220
Can lower it a little.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.680
I will count down three to zero,

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:52.480
and then you can see
that they reach the bottom

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.200
almost at the same time.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.580
So very different in mass.

00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:58.300
The mass difference is
at least a factor of three.

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.000
All other dimensions
are the same.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.300
Three, two, one, zero.

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.160
Completely in unison.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.800
Not intuitive for me.

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:13.000
Now I have one that has
a very small radius

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:13.860
compared to this one.

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:16.000
This is a sm... small
aluminum rod.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.480
Maybe you can see it here,
television.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.260
This is way more heavy,
almost 30 times heavier.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:22.280
Should make no difference.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.820
As long as it's solid,
should make no difference.

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.000
No winner, no loser.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.460
Radii are different,
masses are different.

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.060
Should make no difference.

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:35.440
Okay?

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.900
Here we start the race.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.320
Three, two, one, zero.

00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:42.940
And they hit the bottom
at the same time.

00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:46.140
But now here I have
a hollow one,

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.140
and you better believe it,
that it's hollow.

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.280
So now all the mass is
at the circumference,

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.680
and now it takes more time.

00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:57.740
Now the acceleration as you w...
as you will see,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.280
is half times g sine beta; 
in the other case it was 2/3.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.100
And you may want to think
about it tonight,

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:05.600
why this one takes more.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.600
It has to do, of course,
with the moment of inertia,

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:12.740
but again, it's independent
of mass, radius and length.

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.840
So it's purely a matter
of geometry.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.620
This one is going to be
the loser,

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.680
and this one, regardless
of mass or length,

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:21.600
is going to be the winner.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.420
So you see them.

00:13:22.420 --> 00:13:23.840
One is hollow, one is not.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:26.940
This is very light; 
this is very heavy.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.260
I'll put the hollow one
on your side.

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.000
Three, two, one, zero.

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:45.500
The hollow one lost
and even fell on the floor.

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.780
Yeah, I find these things
always quite amazing,

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.600
that nature works this way,

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:55.000
and I'm impressed
that most of you

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.440
or many of you had
the right intuition

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.080
when they said it would make
no difference

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:03.000
for the two solid cylinders.

00:14:06.540 --> 00:14:12.140
We now come to the most
nonintuitive part of all of 8.01

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:16.300
and arguably perhaps the most
difficult part in all of physics

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.660
and that has to do
with gyroscopes.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:22.860
And I really urge you to pay
a lot of attention

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.300
and not even
to miss ten seconds,

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:28.740
because you're going to see some
mind-boggling demonstrations

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:31.340
which are so incredibly
nonintuitive

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:34.260
that unless you have followed
the steps that lead up to it,

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.440
you won't have any idea
what you're looking at.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.520
It will be fun, it will be cute,

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.820
but it won't do anything
for you.

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.820
Imagine that you and I
go in outer space.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:47.740
No gravity.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.480
We're somewhere in outer space

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.200
and we have
this bicycle wheel there.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.860
And I'm going to put a torque
on this bicycle wheel

00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:59.140
in this direction, so I'm going
to put my right hand towards you

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.360
and my left hand away from you.

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:02.800
And I'll do that
for a short amount of time

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:05.320
and I'll let it go.

00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:07.060
It's obvious
what's going to happen.

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:12.000
This wheel is going to spin like
this forever and ever and ever.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.860
I've given it a little torque.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.480
That means if there's torque,

00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:17.540
there's a change
of angular momentum.

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:20.660
The angular momentum change
must be torque times delta t.

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.960
And so I do this and let it go

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.220
and it will rotate about this
axis forever and ever and ever.

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:27.520
Simple, right?

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.800
Okay.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.920
Now I'm going to torque it
in this direction.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.840
So we're in outer space,
wheel is standing still

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.600
and all I do is do this
and I let it go.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.620
Then it will rotate forever
and ever and ever and ever

00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:42.880
in this direction.

00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.440
That's clear.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.340
Now comes
the very nonintuitive part.

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:52.680
Now I'm going to give it
a spin in your direction

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.260
and now again I'm going
to torque like this.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:15:58.340
What will now happen?

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:00.000
You will say...
or you might say.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.200
I'm not accusing you
of anything.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.960
You might say, well, you give
the wheel a spin

00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:10.800
so this... the wheel will
probably continue to spin

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.360
and you do this, so maybe
what you're going to see is

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.880
that it will rotate like this
as it did before

00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:21.660
and in the same time
the wheel will be spinning.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.160
But that cannot be

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:26.920
because if the wheel would be
spinning like this,

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.000
then the angular momentum
of the spinning wheel is

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.480
in this direction.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.280
And if I would give it a twist

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.340
and if it would continue to spin
and it would rotate like this,

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:40.300
then this spin angular momentum
would go around like this

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.640
and that cannot be because
there's no torque on the system,

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.360
because once I let go,
there is no longer any torque.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:48.680
So it is not possible
for the wheel to keep rotating,

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.380
and as a result of this torque
that I give it,

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:52.880
that it simply goes around.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.560
That is not possible.

00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:59.440
How is nature going to deal
with that?

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.080
I'll show you that
on a view graph.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.800
It's very nonintuitive
what will happen.

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:12.000
And we will then also... I
will also demonstrate it to you.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.260
So here is the situation

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.360
precisely as I described it
to you.

00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.540
You are, as an observer,
in this direction.

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:21.960
This is the direction of 26.100.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.560
So you are viewing the wheels
like this.

00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.300
They're spinning towards you.

00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:30.420
That's what I will do shortly
and that's what I implied now.

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:33.220
This is my right hand
and this is my left hand.

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:35.780
The separation between
my height... right and left hand

00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:37.320
is little "b."

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.800
So the torque that I apply
is bF,

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.740
is this arm, so to speak,
times this force.

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:47.140
And the force is perpendicular
to the arm.

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.640
I apply a torque for a certain
amount of time-- delta t.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.720
When I do that, I apply,
I add angular momentum

00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.620
in this direction.

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.300
But the wheel was spinning in...
in... in this direction.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.440
You see it.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.000
And so the angular momentum
of spin of the wheel

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.940
is in this direction.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.880
I add angular momentum in this
direction and you see that here.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.900
So this was originally the spin
angular momentum of the wheel.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.900
I torque for time delta t,

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:18.100
and so I add angular momentum
like this.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.000
And then I stop.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.400
I only torque for a short amount
of time and I stop.

00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.880
That means after I have stopped,

00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:28.000
the angular momentum
of the system as a whole

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000
can no longer change

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.840
because there's no torque
on the system,

00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:33.620
and the only way that nature now
can solve that problem is

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.760
to tilt this wheel in the way
I've indicated here,

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.000
and to make it spin
in this direction

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.880
and it will stand still.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:45.180
In other words, I hold it
in my hand, the wheel--

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:51.580
I will get it--
I give it a spin.

00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:57.860
I hold it in my hand,
I spin it towards you...

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:00.000
and I'm going to put
my right hand towards you

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.700
and my left hand away from you.

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.800
The spin angular momentum
is now in this direction,

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.800
so I'm going to give
it a torque like so.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:08.820
That means up.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:09.920
And what will the wheel do?

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.120
The wheel will do this.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:13.160
Very nonintuitive.

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.180
Watch it.

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:16.620
Isn't that strange?

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.620
You wouldn't expect that.

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.760
I will do it again.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.360
I'm going to torque by pushing
my hand towards you,

00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:25.080
and the wheel does something
completely unexpected.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.680
It simply tilts.

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.400
If I torque
the other way around,

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.220
then the torque, of course,
will make it flip like this.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.480
I'll give it a little bit more
spin angular momentum,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.740
so now I move my left hand
towards you,

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.680
and my right hand towards me,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.000
and then I expect that the wheel
will do this.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.000
And that's what it does.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.860
Extremely nonintuitive.

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:50.800
These torques applied
to a spinning wheel

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.900
always do something
that you don't expect.

00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:57.340
However, there is one thing
that always helps me

00:19:57.340 --> 00:20:00.220
in terms of guiding me

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:03.220
and that is
you can always predict

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:10.120
that the spin angular momentum
will always move

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:16.920
in the direction of the torque,

00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.700
which is this external torque
that I applied.

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.340
Let's go over that again.

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:26.700
We have here the spin angular
momentum that you saw.

00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.780
It was pointing
in this direction.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:33.580
And I applied the torque
in this direction, the vector.

00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:35.660
And what does
the spin angular momentum do?

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.760
It goes in the direction
of the torque.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.020
And then when I stop
with my torque,

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.760
then of course nothing
changes anymore,

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.340
and so what happens is
this wheel tilts.

00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:52.120
But notice that L, the spin
angular momentum, has moved

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.240
from here to here.

00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.040
And I was torqueing
in this direction,

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.200
so it moved towards the torque.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:04.980
If you have digested this,
then you can test yourself now.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.060
Now we have the same wheel.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:10.340
I'm going to rotate it
in exactly the same direction,

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:14.700
but now I'm not going to torque
like this, in the Z direction,

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.040
or like this,
in the minus-Z direction.

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.480
Now I'm going to do this.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:23.100
Or I'm going to do this.

00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:27.680
Try now to really concentrate
on what I just taught you.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.720
And try to give an answer
to the following question.

00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:32.260
The wheel is rotating.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.480
I hold it in my hand and I'm
going to torque it like this

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.900
so that the torque factor is
in your direction.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:42.920
Angular momentum goes like this,
torque is like this.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:46.100
What will the angular momentum
vector do?

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:52.460
Move in the direction
of... of the torque.

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:53.460
What will the angular...

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.900
what will the spin angular
momentum vector then do

00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:58.700
if the torque is
in this direction?

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.260
It will do this.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.580
It's going to move
in the horizontal plane.

00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:06.720
Very nonintuitive,
but that's what it will do.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.840
And I will show that to you.

00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:14.460
I'm going to spin this wheel.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:16.500
I'm going to spin it with
a high angular momentum,

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.420
high spin angular momentum.

00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:21.820
And then I'm going to sit
on this stool

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.540
and I'm going to torque
exactly as you see

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:24.700
on the picture on the right.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.880
I'm going to torque like this.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.220
And as long as I torque it
like this,

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.040
that spin angular momentum
wants to go around

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:33.880
in the horizontal plane.

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.820
And when I torque
the other way around,

00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:39.760
it will go back
in the horizontal plane.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.360
I'm going to torque exactly
as you see on the picture there.

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.460
Are you ready?

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:10.300
I stop the torque; 
nothing happens.

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.480
I torque backwards; 
I keep torqueing.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.120
I keep torqueing.

00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:13.920
I feel it in my hand.

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.080
I really have to push.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.280
I keep torqueing.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.000
And I stop torqueing
and it stops.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.900
The angular momentum vector

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.000
is chasing, so to speak,
the torque.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.720
Is that nonintuitive?

00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.840
Very nonintuitive?

00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.380
It's also dangerous sometimes.

00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.960
We call this motion of the
stool, and in this case,

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:44.440
the motion of the spinning
wheel, we call that precession.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.240
So you apply a torque
to a spinning wheel.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:54.940
Then what you obtain
is a precession.

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:58.540
I can show you the precession
in another way

00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:03.320
which is, in fact,
very intriguing.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:10.740
Suppose I have here a string,
a rope, like we have there.

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:16.840
And I stick into that rope,
I attach to the rope this wheel,

00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:20.020
just like so.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.760
And I let it go.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.280
Well, we all know
what will happen.

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.960
Pffft, clunk.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.460
It's clear.

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.540
All right.

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:33.200
But now I'm going to spin it
before I let it go.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.960
So here at the bottom, at this
point P, there is a loop.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.400
And here is the... the axis of
rotation of the bicycle wheel

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:48.020
which is solid brass,
it's a solid piece,

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.840
and I give that a length
little "r,"

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:52.560
not to be confused
with capital "R,"

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:57.740
which is the radius
of the bicycle wheel.

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:04.320
So this is capital R.

00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.320
And it can rotate about this
here reasonably freely.

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.900
I call that center point Q

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:17.540
and let this be the part of
the wheel that is on your side.

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.960
I'm trying to make you see it a
little bit three-dimensionally.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:26.040
Suppose now I give it a spin
in this direction.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.940
Omega s.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.800
"S" stands for "spin."

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.260
In what direction is now
the spin angular momentum?

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.480
Use your hands, your thumbs.

00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:36.960
Spinning in this direction.

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:38.500
Yeah.

00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:41.820
Spinning this direction, angular
momentum is in this direction.

00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:45.760
That's a spin angular momentum.

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.920
L spin.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:55.380
Well, there is a force
on this system, Mg,

00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:58.980
and that force is
in this direction.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:03.180
It has a mass M,
the bicycle wheel,

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.380
and it has a radius,
capital "R,"

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:09.200
and this part is little "r."

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:15.620
So relative to point P,
there is a torque

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.800
and the torque is R times Mg.

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.380
This is 90 degrees
so the cross product is nice.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.240
The sine of the angle is one.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:28.760
So the torque relative to point
P is r times M times g.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:32.760
In what direction
is that torque?

00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.260
R cross F.

00:26:34.260 --> 00:26:37.660
In what direction
is that torque?

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:41.140
Use your hands, thumbs,
whatever you want.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.660
You think in this direction?

00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:44.780
I disagree.

00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:45.340
I disagree.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:51.820
R cross F is...
you must be kidding.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.720
In the blackboard.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.260
It's not out of the blackboard; 
it's in the blackboard.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:59.600
R cross F is in the blackboard.

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.720
There is a torque
in this direction.

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:06.680
Nature, gravity
provides that torque.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.900
What will the spin angular
momentum do?

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:13.140
It's going to move in the
direction of the torque.

00:27:13.140 --> 00:27:15.080
It's going to chase the torque.

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:18.960
So what will it do if the
angular momentum is here?

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.800
What will it do?

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.300
It will do this.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:27.320
And as it moves, the torque
will always be perpendicular

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.920
to the plane
through the string and r.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.320
You can just see that
for yourself why that is.

00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.920
At this very moment when angular
momentum is like this,

00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:39.600
the torque is in the blackboard
because it's r cross F.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.160
But when I'm here, this r
has changed position,

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.920
and always remains perpendicular
to the wheel.

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.460
So the torque
will also change direction

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.200
and so this angular momentum,

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.000
spin angular momentum
will keep chasing the torque

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.220
and start to rotate freely.

00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.540
That is exactly what I was doing
when I was sitting on the stool,

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.540
except that I had to apply that
torque in my hands like this.

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:06.080
It's exactly the same direction.

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.840
I had to apply it all the time,

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.580
and when I stopped,
the precession stopped.

00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.160
Here, however, the torque
will never stop

00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:16.960
because this Mg
will always be there,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.300
and I will show that
to you shortly.

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.600
You may say, "You must be crazy

00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:30.700
"because you're violating
Newton's second law, f = MA.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.120
"This object got to fall.

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.640
"There's only one force
on that object.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.460
"f = MA.

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.200
"How can it not?

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:40.100
The center of mass must fall
with acceleration g."

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:41.100
Aha.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:43.460
There is not just one force
on that object.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.260
What do you think is here?

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:50.460
The tension in this cable, T,
will be exactly Mg.

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:57.740
And so the net, the sum of all
forces on that object is zero.

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:02.160
There is no net force on that
wheel but there is a net torque,

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.880
and that's why
it's going to precess.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:05.580
If there had been a net force,

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.280
then indeed
it would also go down,

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.300
if this force
were larger than this.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.020
So nature is very clever,

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:16.420
the way that it deals with these
rather difficult problems.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.140
Before I will show you
this demonstration

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:23.580
by spinning this wheel and then
hanging it there in that rope,

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:25.280
um, I want to mention

00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:29.740
that the angular frequency
of the precession,

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:31.240
which should never be confused

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.980
with the angular frequency
of spinning,

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.860
is derived for you... it's only
a three- or four-minute job,

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:43.220
on page 344 in your book.

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.220
Now, I will not derive it here
but what comes out of it,

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:48.860
that it is the torque

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.500
which is the one that we have
here in this case,

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.160
divided by
the spin angular momentum.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:01.460
That gives you the frequency
of the precession.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:07.580
In our case, for our bicycle
wheel, it is rMg

00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.680
and the spin angular momentum
of this wheel,

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:15.560
if it is rotating with angular
velocity omega of s,

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.400
would be I times omega.

00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:20.280
Remember, l is I times omega
of a spinning wheel.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.780
So I have here I
rotating about point Q--

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:29.400
this is the axis of rotation--
times omega of the spin.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.260
This is the spin
and this is the precession.

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.800
And then the period
of precession

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.720
would be 2pi divided
by omega precession.

00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.520
Let's take a look
at that equation

00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:45.800
and see whether that sort
of intuitively makes sense.

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:51.160
First of all, if you increase
the torque, the upstairs,

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:54.140
then it says that the precession
frequency will increase.

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:55.860
That makes sense to me

00:30:55.860 --> 00:31:00.240
because the torque is persuading
the angular momentum

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.440
to follow it.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.100
So the torque is persuading the
spin angular momentum to change.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.720
Well, if the torque is stronger
then it is more powerful,

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.140
so you expect
that the precession frequency

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.000
will be higher.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.540
However, if the spin angular
momentum is very powerful,

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:22.720
then the spin angular momentum
says, "Sorry, torque,

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.660
I'm not going to go as fast
as you want me to go."

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.800
So when you increase that spin
angular momentum in the wheel,

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:30.300
it is also intuitive

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:35.980
that the precession frequency
will go down.

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:40.300
As the wheel spins,
it has spin angular momentum,

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:43.040
but as it precesses around
like this,

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:46.380
there will also be angular
momentum in this direction

00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:49.380
because it's rotating like this.

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:51.680
Therefore there is
a total angular momentum

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:56.980
which is
the vectorial sum of the two.

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:00.060
This equation will only hold

00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:03.960
as long as the spin angular
momentum is really dominating

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.700
the total angular momentum

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.140
and you can see that
immediately,

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:11.560
because suppose you make
the spin angular momentum zero,

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.320
that it is not spinning at all.

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.220
Do you really think

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.380
that the precession frequency
will be infinitely high?

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.960
Of course not.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:20.400
So this only holds in situations

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:24.100
where the spin angular momentum
is way, way larger

00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:30.020
than the angular momentum that
you get due to the precession.

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.340
So there are restrictions.

00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.840
When the... when the wheel
comes to a halt,

00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.700
when it's no longer rotating,
you better believe it,

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.120
then the thing will go clunk.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.600
There's no longer
the precession mode.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.140
For our bicycle wheel,

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:50.920
to get a feeling for how long
the precession will take,

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:55.820
uh, we can substitute
the numbers in there,

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:56.800
our bicycle wheel,

00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:00.100
the... the... the rod,
the brass rod, little r

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.340
has a length of 17 centimeters,

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:08.920
and the... the radius
of the bicycle wheel

00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:15.000
is about 29 centimeters.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.440
And let me make the assumption

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.940
that all the mass of the bicycle
wheel is at the circumference,

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.140
which is not very accurate,
but it's close to that.

00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:25.980
I mean, there are
some spokes here,

00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:27.980
but let's assume
that everything is here,

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.420
so then the moment of inertia is
MR squared.

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:39.440
Well, if now you take
a frequency of five hertz,

00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.740
spin frequency,

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:46.920
you can calculate now omega
of the spin frequency.

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.780
Omega equals 2pi
times the spin frequency.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:55.700
And so I know now I can
substitute that in there,

00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.700
so I get an omega precession

00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:03.860
now equals rMg
times the moment of inertia.

00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:07.280
I assume that all the mass is
at the circumference,

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.260
an approximation,
so we get MR squared

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:14.740
and then we get omega S,
which we have here.

00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:17.120
We lose the M, and so we get

00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:23.040
rg divided by omega s
times R squared.

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:29.120
That is the angular frequency
of the precession,

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:35.120
and the period of the precession
is 2pi divided by omega

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:38.400
and you find then for the period
of the precession

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.100
about ten seconds.

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:45.440
So if I gave it a spin frequency
of five hertz

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:47.880
with these dimensions
and with this approximation

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.180
that all the mass is
at the circumference,

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:54.360
you would expect that it would
precess around very gently

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.760
in about ten seconds.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:59.020
But I have very little control
over that frequency,

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:01.160
so it is possible
I gave it seven hertz,

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.580
it's possible
I gave it three hertz.

00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:05.740
But I will do what I can.

00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.040
I'll actually give it
the maximum one that I can.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:12.580
That is always guaranteed
success.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.580
Where is the wheel?

00:35:13.580 --> 00:35:17.580
The wheel is here.

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:23.000
So we'll spin it up
and then we'll put it in here.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.400
Notice the way I'm spinning it.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:31.000
I'm holding it away from me now
and going to change it

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.260
and do it differently next.

00:35:53.900 --> 00:35:56.240
And there it goes.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.480
About ten seconds.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.240
Isn't that amazing?

00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:08.080
And it rotates,
seen from below, clockwise.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.000
Now it's going this way and I'm
going to redo the experiment,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.820
changing the direction
of rotation,

00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.040
and then it will go
the other way around.

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:17.500
And now the angular momentum
is rotating like this,

00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:20.020
is pointing here.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:23.260
Spin angular momentum
is pointing like this,

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:26.000
torque is like this,

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.140
and so the spin angular momentum
is changing that...

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:28.980
chasing that torque.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:29.980
I am the spin angular momentum.

00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:31.080
I am the torque.

00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:31.960
This is the torque.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.800
It's chasing it.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:38.980
All right.

00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.800
So I have this in my right hand.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:43.080
That's all right.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:51.420
And now I will... so
when I spin it up, that's right.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.560
So let me now change
the direction.

00:36:54.560 --> 00:37:00.660
I'm turning it over and
I'm going to spin it up again.

00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:27.360
Angular momentum is now
in this direction.

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.600
See, it's turning
the other way around.

00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:30.440
Angular momentum is
in this direction.

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.980
Torque is now towards me.

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:36.180
Angular momentum is chasing
the torque.

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.900
I've changed the direction
of the spin angular momentum.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.940
I've not changed the direction
of the torque,

00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.600
and now it is rotating, as seen
from below, counterclockwise.

00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.740
Before,
it was rotating clockwise.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.960
If I can increase the torque

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:53.580
by putting some weight here
on the axle, I have this...

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.820
this actually extends,
in our case,

00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:59.120
and I can put some weight
on here,

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:01.680
then I actually add
to the torque

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:04.960
and then you will see
that it's... it goes faster.

00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:07.040
The precession frequency
goes up.

00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.600
So I will put some weight
on there.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:35.880
So let it first go around,
which was roughly ten seconds,

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:39.300
roughly calculated,

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:43.260
and now I'm going to put
two kilograms here at the end.

00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:45.320
And now you will see
an instantaneous increase

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.140
in the precession frequency.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.900
You see it goes much faster now.

00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:53.340
I take it off and then it goes
back to its roughly ten seconds.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:56.340
So what I have done is
I have increased this torque

00:38:56.340 --> 00:38:58.280
but not at the expense of M,

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.120
because the reason why
the M cancels is

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.280
because the moment of inertia
has an M in it,

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.200
but if I just hang
this object on it,

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.560
that doesn't change
the moment of inertia

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.720
of the spinning wheel.

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.540
None of this is intuitive.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.440
None of this
is intuitive.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:26.240
You can do all of this
with a $5 toy gyro.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.240
And I want to show this to you.

00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.060
This is my toy gyro.

00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:28.860
I have it in my office.

00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.600
It's great fun.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:34.660
And this toy gyro is doing
exactly the same thing

00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.200
that this is doing.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:44.380
Let me show you
the toy gyro first.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.820
Toy gyro.

00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:49.560
Oh, yeah.

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.440
Here is a toy gyro.

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.440
Can you see it?

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:58.700
Maybe I should make it
a little darker here.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.020
Can you see my toy gyro?

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.520
Yeah?

00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:07.120
I'm going to spin it

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.120
and then I'm going to hang it
exactly the same way

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.360
that that was hanging.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.200
I'm going to spin it,

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:13.420
for those who are
sitting close-- whoosh--

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.460
and then putting it horizontally
and hanging it in a string,

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:20.840
and you'll see exactly
the same thing is happening.

00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:45.780
And now through friction,
of course,

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:51.540
all this fun ultimately
comes to a halt.

00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.760
I have something
very special for you,

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:56.620
or I may have something
very special for you.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:04.120
That depends on my helper
who is here behind the scenes.

00:41:04.120 --> 00:41:04.940
I hear him.

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.280
He's there.

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.280
Great.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.900
Did you get full speed?

00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:22.040
I'm going to the airport
and get a little tired

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.580
and ask one of my friends
to help me.

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.280
Would you please help me
and...

00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:31.240
just carry this suitcase
for me around?

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:36.240
Pick it up, walk around
a little, make some turns.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.820
Turn the other way around,
please.

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.780
(laughter)

00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:43.140
STUDENT:
What the hell?

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:45.060
LEWIN:
What the hell, yeah.

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:45.780
Exactly.

00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:48.160
What are you doing, man?

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.940
You're behaving so strangely.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:51.940
Make some more turns, man.

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:57.300
We've got to go the...
we've got to catch the plane.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.800
It doesn't quite do what you
think it will be doing, right?

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.500
So in here, you've guessed it.

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.760
STUDENT:
Big spinning wheel or something.

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:06.860
LEWIN:
Spinning wheel.

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.500
And when you do this,
you put a torque on it

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:13.120
and it does exactly what
you least expect: it flips up.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.820
Isn't that fun?

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:15.320
Yeah.

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.100
You may get arrested

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.560
when you go to Logan Airport
with this suitcase.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.560
Thank you very much.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.680
It's great.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.360
Spinning objects have
a stabilizing effect.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:41.600
If you take a bicycle wheel,
and we have one,

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:47.540
and I put it here and I do
nothing, it will fall.

00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:49.540
No one is surprised.

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:55.460
However, if I give it a little
spin, then it doesn't fall.

00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.460
Why?

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:58.460
Because it has angular momentum.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.640
It has spin angular momentum.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.100
And so it doesn't fall.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.200
And it is not only
a bicycle wheel.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.260
Look.

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.960
Nicely stable.

00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.300
Not only with a bicycle wheel.

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:13.860
You take... you take a quarter
and you put a quarter like this

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.160
on your desk.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.880
You bet your life it will fall.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.200
Roll it; it becomes stable.

00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:24.760
You give it spin angular
momentum, it becomes stable.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.760
Take a top.

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:31.380
You put a top on the table,
falls over.

00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:36.520
You twist it, you give it spin,
and the top is stable.

00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:43.500
So spin angular momentum has the
property of stabilizing things.

00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.440
And you will see that addressed
in one of your assignments,

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:51.960
when I want you to address that
quantitatively.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.060
This is the basic idea behind
inertial guidance systems.

00:43:56.060 --> 00:44:00.100
In inertial guidance systems,
you have a spinning wheel,

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:00.940
at least in the days

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:04.720
that the guidance systems
had mechanical wheels.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.860
but that spinning wheel is
mounted in such a way

00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:15.220
that you cannot put a torque
on the axis of rotation

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.340
of the spinning wheel.

00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:17.340
That's the way it's mounted.

00:44:17.340 --> 00:44:23.080
We call that
three-axle-gimbaled gyros.

00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:26.800
So the moment that you put
a torque on it,

00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:30.360
the housings-- in this case, the
yellow and the black housing--

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.360
will start to rotate,

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:33.400
and you never managed
to get that torque

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.900
on the spinning wheel.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:38.840
You never get it
on... on this axis.

00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.440
And therefore,
if now you put it on your boat

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.180
or you put it in a plane,
or a missile for that matter,

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:48.960
if you can never put a torque
on the spinning wheel

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.220
and if the angular momentum
for spin is in this direction,

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:54.720
it will stay there forever
and ever,

00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.200
assuming that we have
no frictional losses.

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:02.340
And if then the plane turns,

00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.940
the direction of the spin
angular momentum

00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:05.600
will not change,

00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.460
but what will happen
of course is

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.860
that this yellow frame
will rotate

00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.000
or this black frame will rotate.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.700
And in these bearings here
are shaft encoders,

00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:20.480
and they sense that the rotation
that the outer housing makes

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:24.360
in order to keep this thing
pointing at the same direction.

00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.920
And that signal is being fed
back to the automatic pilot

00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:29.680
and that keeps the plane flying

00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.180
in the direction
that you want to.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:33.920
So you use, as a reference
all the time,

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.480
the spin angular momentum
of your gyro,

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:39.800
which is now mounted
in such a way

00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.540
that you cannot put
a torque on it,

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.540
even when the plane changes
direction,

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:46.660
and I want to show that to you.

00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:29.620
Okay, this is the direction
of my spin angular momentum

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.840
and I'm the airplane
and I'm going to fly.

00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:38.920
Look at that
spin angular momentum.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.700
It has no respect for me.

00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:47.240
It stays in the same direction
no matter how I fly.

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.640
And the arrow signals
that come from the bearings

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:56.880
of the yellow housing
and the black housing,

00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.300
those arrow signals are fed back
to the automatic pilot

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:06.380
and so the plane will stay
on course.

00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.740
Now what I can do for you

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:14.200
to come to a final test
on your thinking,

00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:17.900
this wheel is suspended
in such a way

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.260
that there is
no gravitational torque on it

00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.900
like there was here.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:27.140
But I can put a torque on it

00:47:27.140 --> 00:47:31.140
by simply putting some weights
on the axis.

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:32.980
And what do you think
will happen now

00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.820
if I put some weight here
on the axis?

00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:38.300
So the wheel is spinning,

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:40.700
but now I'm going to put
a torque on it here.

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:42.600
It is spinning
in this direction.

00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:47.540
Angular momentum is pointing
straight at me, away from you.

00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:50.060
I'm going to put a torque
on like this,

00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.280
put a little weight there.

00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.960
Torque will be
in this direction.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.820
What will the spin
angular momentum do?

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:57.180
Torque is in this direction;

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.460
spin angular momentum's
in this direction.

00:47:59.460 --> 00:48:03.200
Spin angular momentum
will start to chase the torque.

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:06.880
Watch it.

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.600
There it goes.

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.040
The spin angular momentum
is chasing the torque.

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.720
You see exactly the same thing
that I've shown you before.

00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:22.360
And if I make the torque higher,

00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:25.520
then the precession frequency
will go up.

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:29.000
See, it stops now immediately
when I take it off.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.140
Put it back on again.

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:33.200
Continues.

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.960
Put more on it.

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:38.680
Goes way faster.

00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:42.640
What happens now if I put
the weight on this side?

00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.460
So I change the direction
of the torque.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:49.280
If I put it on this side,
torque is now in this direction,

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.780
spin angular momentum is
in this direction.

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:53.300
It's going to reverse direction.

00:48:53.300 --> 00:48:55.920
There we go.

00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:58.100
And you see it does.

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:01.080
Amazingly nonintuitive.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.460
If you have problems with this,
you're not alone.

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:07.220
See you Wednesday.
