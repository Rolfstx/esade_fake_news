00:00:00.176 --> 00:00:03.770
 (Chopping) (music) 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.956
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:04.956 --> 00:00:07.545
 Today we will be doing chap ji 

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:11.284
 Chap Ji Hye is a translucent soft noodle with meat 

00:00:11.284 --> 00:00:14.721
 Fried mushrooms and vegetables. 

00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:17.400
 Doesn't this look delicious and nutritious? 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.992
 Yeah. 

00:00:17.992 --> 00:00:20.003
 If you have a great event soon 

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:21.527
 And I made this dish. 

00:00:21.527 --> 00:00:23.214
 You will be of interest to many. 

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:24.417
 You will be famous. 

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:27.390
 Years ago, I uploaded the video of how Chap Ji works, 

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:30.025
 But today, I'm going to make a small amount. 

00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:32.604
 First, let's season the meat. 

00:00:32.604 --> 00:00:34.135
 This is a loin steak. 

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.702
 But if you are a vegetarian, you can skip this step, 

00:00:37.702 --> 00:00:39.581
 And use a lot of mushrooms. 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:52.938
 I use beef but you can use another meat. 

00:00:52.938 --> 00:00:56.330
 Soak dried shiitake mushrooms in water for two hours. 

00:00:57.508 --> 00:00:58.199
 So. 

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.743
 The fungus is very wide, 

00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:04.259
 So I'll cut it into slices ... 

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:06.931
 So. 

00:01:14.653 --> 00:01:16.389
 So, if you are vegan, 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:18.639
 Just add more shiitake mushroom. 

00:01:21.382 --> 00:01:23.914
 Then we put mushrooms on the meat. 

00:01:25.323 --> 00:01:26.508
 We cut this. 

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:35.512
 And also garlic clove. 

00:01:40.034 --> 00:01:41.772
 We add it here. 

00:01:41.772 --> 00:01:45.401
 Sugar, you can use white or brown sugar 

00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:46.922
 Ground black pepper. 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.136
 Two teaspoons of soy sauce. 

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.380
 A teaspoon of sesame oil. 

00:01:58.291 --> 00:01:59.188
 And mix. 

00:02:00.702 --> 00:02:02.089
 It smells like polo (Korean dish). 

00:02:05.493 --> 00:02:07.452
 Soo keep this in the fridge 

00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:09.665
 While I prepare other ingredients. 

00:02:14.944 --> 00:02:15.797
 Egg yolk. 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.114
 And the egg whites. 

00:02:20.018 --> 00:02:22.041
 Just a little salt. 

00:02:23.106 --> 00:02:26.648
 You can do the same with egg whites, too. 

00:02:26.648 --> 00:02:29.120
 You make it like a white sheet like this. 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.365
 It can be used, 

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:32.541
 But the yolk is yellow. 

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:34.438
 It is beautiful and highlights its color. 

00:02:34.438 --> 00:02:36.353
 I always make a yellow paper. 

00:02:41.008 --> 00:02:44.219
 Wipe the oil 

00:02:44.236 --> 00:02:47.911
 So that only a thin layer is covered. 

00:02:47.917 --> 00:02:49.728
 Let's put out the fire. 

00:02:56.202 --> 00:02:58.391
 So, there is no heat now. 

00:02:58.391 --> 00:02:59.589
 The pan is hot. 

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:02.332
 With the rest of the heat, we cook the egg. 

00:03:05.726 --> 00:03:07.418
 Turn it like this. 

00:03:08.505 --> 00:03:10.002
 Very beautiful color. 

00:03:10.002 --> 00:03:12.991
 Both sides are yellow. 

00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:14.102
 Matured. 

00:03:16.503 --> 00:03:17.805
 Leave it cool. 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.295
 This is spinach. 

00:03:41.988 --> 00:03:44.638
 My final layer will be here, 

00:03:44.638 --> 00:03:46.866
 A very important bowl today. 

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:49.665
 So, whenever I finish cooking part, 

00:03:49.665 --> 00:03:50.906
 I will put it here. 

00:03:50.906 --> 00:03:53.455
 First, we start with spinach. 

00:03:55.084 --> 00:03:57.170
 I cleaned the spinach. 

00:04:01.617 --> 00:04:05.993
 About 30 seconds to a minute we allow it to cook. 

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:08.618
 Okay, I'll let the water boil. 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.060
 Then squeeze the water. 

00:04:26.323 --> 00:04:30.151
 Then we add some soy sauce. 

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:31.463
 And sesame oil. 

00:04:35.282 --> 00:04:36.610
 And these noodles. 

00:04:36.621 --> 00:04:37.588
 Look at its size. (Laughter) 

00:04:37.588 --> 00:04:39.962
 Made with sweet potato starch. 

00:04:39.962 --> 00:04:40.904
 You can buy it easily 

00:04:40.904 --> 00:04:43.396
 From any Korean grocery. 

00:04:43.396 --> 00:04:45.447
 Or you can use cellophane noodles. 

00:04:45.447 --> 00:04:47.678
 When you cook it it becomes very transparent. 

00:04:47.685 --> 00:04:50.374
 Like glass and soft. 

00:04:50.374 --> 00:04:54.245
 This is what makes this dish so special. 

00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:56.133
 I will use 4 ounces (about 113 grams). 

00:05:05.534 --> 00:05:09.589
 Okay, after a minute, we're stirring. 

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:14.673
 And here we are (Laughter) 

00:05:16.322 --> 00:05:19.592
 I will cut the types of vegetables. 

00:05:19.592 --> 00:05:21.471
 Cut it about two inches (about 5 cm). 

00:05:24.431 --> 00:05:27.224
 If this white part is wide, 

00:05:27.224 --> 00:05:28.717
 You can cut it in two 

00:05:28.717 --> 00:05:31.618
 But today its thickness is good. 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.958
 Two or three green onions. 

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:35.269
 And onion. 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.424
 Onions are very delicious. 

00:05:42.424 --> 00:05:45.790
 I will use about a cup. 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.467
 White fungus, we cut the base 

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:52.364
 And cut it into thin slices. 

00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:01.615
 I will cut these red things 

00:06:01.615 --> 00:06:04.846
 Carrots and red capsicum, 

00:06:04.846 --> 00:06:07.047
 But only red peppers can be used. 

00:06:07.047 --> 00:06:09.243
 Or just carrots. 

00:06:14.636 --> 00:06:15.960
 About three quarters of a cup. 

00:06:29.045 --> 00:06:31.855
 We get rid of this inner part. 

00:06:37.492 --> 00:06:39.579
 Cut this well, beautiful isn't it? 

00:06:39.579 --> 00:06:40.468
 Red color. 

00:06:40.468 --> 00:06:43.472
 I will use this simple amount. 

00:06:43.472 --> 00:06:44.595
 Do not throw them away. 

00:06:44.609 --> 00:06:47.001
 Cut them and use them with fried rice. 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:52.357
 And now the two good ones, Ki Ran Ji Dan, let's cut it. 

00:06:58.158 --> 00:07:00.395
 The slicing mission is over. 

00:07:01.752 --> 00:07:05.639
 Exactly seven minutes later, I check fate. 

00:07:06.772 --> 00:07:07.522
 this is. 

00:07:08.491 --> 00:07:09.055
 (swallowing) 

00:07:12.317 --> 00:07:13.665
 The noodles are soft. 

00:07:15.255 --> 00:07:16.120
 Cook it well. 

00:07:17.117 --> 00:07:18.220
 very hot. 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.820
 These noodles are quite long. 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.885
 So I will cut it. 

00:07:28.483 --> 00:07:29.190
 So. 

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:38.063
 Well, this is our true bowl. 

00:07:38.063 --> 00:07:41.006
 Everything is ready, we'll put it here. 

00:07:41.006 --> 00:07:42.680
 I will use sesame oil. 

00:07:44.099 --> 00:07:44.951
 soy sauce. 

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:47.755
 small spoon. 

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:49.934
 And a teaspoon of sugar. 

00:07:49.938 --> 00:07:51.131
 And mix. 

00:07:56.075 --> 00:08:00.637
 If you are going to work a lot, you can do this in another bowl. 

00:08:00.637 --> 00:08:03.015
 But today we do a small amount, 

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:06.337
 So I use one bowl, everything, like this. 

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:16.711
 Add some oil. 

00:08:18.866 --> 00:08:20.013
 Onions. 

00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:22.770
 And green onions. 

00:08:28.928 --> 00:08:30.790
 And a little salt. 

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.719
 Transfer until the white part withers 

00:08:40.732 --> 00:08:42.777
 Of onions and green onions. 

00:08:42.777 --> 00:08:45.523
 Onions become transparent. 

00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:51.788
 You do not need to wash these. 

00:08:51.788 --> 00:08:53.720
 We start the fire again. 

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.451
 A little oil. 

00:08:59.413 --> 00:09:01.181
 And this time we put mushrooms. 

00:09:06.831 --> 00:09:09.281
 Also a little salt. 

00:09:14.173 --> 00:09:15.980
 And when mushrooms are cooked, 

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.602
 It glitters and softens like this. 

00:09:22.183 --> 00:09:23.867
 We transfer it to the bowl. 

00:09:29.837 --> 00:09:31.150
 Then, red things. 

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:33.956
 The islands first. 

00:09:39.281 --> 00:09:41.324
 Fifteen seconds. 

00:09:41.324 --> 00:09:43.222
 Then add the red pepper. 

00:09:47.265 --> 00:09:48.056
 Well done. 

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.809
 And do not forget about meat and mushrooms. 

00:10:00.756 --> 00:10:03.603
 Shiitake mushrooms are also spiced 

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:06.504
 In a balsamic dressing sauce. 

00:10:06.504 --> 00:10:09.040
 When we cook this it tastes really like ... 

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.228
 Texture is like a plum (Korean dish), 

00:10:11.228 --> 00:10:15.758
 We must fry it until the pink flesh disappears 

00:10:15.758 --> 00:10:17.757
 The mushrooms are also ripe 

00:10:17.757 --> 00:10:20.193
 It becomes mushy and shiny. 

00:10:26.696 --> 00:10:29.776
 I will use a large garlic clove. 

00:10:32.959 --> 00:10:33.631
 So. 

00:10:37.463 --> 00:10:39.906
 Soy sauce and sugar. 

00:10:39.906 --> 00:10:42.404
 1 tablespoon of soy sauce. 

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:47.907
 Tablespoon of sugar. 

00:10:47.908 --> 00:10:49.132
 Ground black pepper. 

00:10:50.148 --> 00:10:51.243
 This is black pepper. 

00:10:53.237 --> 00:10:54.834
 I want to add a lot 

00:10:54.834 --> 00:10:58.114
 Because black pepper makes it so delicious. 

00:10:58.114 --> 00:10:59.858
 And more sesame oil. 

00:11:14.616 --> 00:11:16.984
 (Swallow) 

00:11:18.654 --> 00:11:19.453
 Fabulous. 

00:11:20.524 --> 00:11:21.384
 Tasty. 

00:11:23.685 --> 00:11:26.142
 And then sesame seeds. 

00:11:28.461 --> 00:11:31.015
 Crunchy sesame seeds. 

00:11:31.027 --> 00:11:32.179
 This egg. 

00:11:32.179 --> 00:11:33.765
 I will add it here. 

00:11:35.137 --> 00:11:36.887
 My God, isn't it beautiful! 

00:11:51.765 --> 00:11:53.621
 And more sesame seeds. 

00:11:55.455 --> 00:11:56.393
 Fabulous! 

00:11:59.301 --> 00:12:00.250
 You guys! 

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.584
 I really wish I could share it with you. 

00:12:02.595 --> 00:12:03.547
 It is enough for four people. 

00:12:03.547 --> 00:12:05.741
 And if you're hungry, two people are enough. (Laughter) 

00:12:05.741 --> 00:12:08.361
 Let me give it a try, Al-Chubbaji. 

00:12:08.361 --> 00:12:10.226
 Today we did the simulation together. 

00:12:11.871 --> 00:12:12.578
 OK. 

00:12:21.824 --> 00:12:22.999
 In all your health! 

00:12:26.536 --> 00:12:28.092
 (swallowing) 

00:12:33.763 --> 00:12:34.840
 Tasty! 

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:35.657
 Sweet. 

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.539
 The noodles slip into my mouth. 

00:12:38.539 --> 00:12:40.425
 Tastier than usual. 

00:12:41.677 --> 00:12:44.035
 (swallowing) 

00:12:44.046 --> 00:12:44.815
 Ummm. 

00:12:44.815 --> 00:12:46.444
 (swallowing) 

00:12:46.444 --> 00:12:48.141
 Sometimes people ask me, 

00:12:48.141 --> 00:12:50.190
 “Oh Mang Chi, when you do the analogy, 

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.994
 Why not fry all things together 

00:12:52.994 --> 00:12:54.076
 Instead of frying everything alone. 

00:12:54.076 --> 00:12:57.079
 "Why do you say everything alone?" 

00:12:57.079 --> 00:13:00.406
 Each ingredient needs a different cooking time, (in order to preserve the colors of the ingredients) 

00:13:00.412 --> 00:13:03.836
 So we need to prepare each part separately. 

00:13:03.861 --> 00:13:07.680
 One bit of chagabi contains a lot of flavors and textures. 

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.798
 Whenever people make this dish for big parties, 

00:13:10.798 --> 00:13:12.420
 Always executed quickly. 

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.422
 Especially when you go to parties where food is available all the time, 

00:13:14.422 --> 00:13:17.129
 You make your plate but nobody touches it, 

00:13:17.129 --> 00:13:18.669
 And you feel embarrassed, 

00:13:18.669 --> 00:13:21.928
 But Al-Shabbaji is very popular, I promise. 

00:13:21.928 --> 00:13:25.016
 Do it and share it with your family. 

00:13:25.016 --> 00:13:28.549
 Or your friends, co-workers, and all the people (Laughter), we agreed. 

00:13:28.549 --> 00:13:29.940
 I hope you enjoyed my recipe. 

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.207
 See you next time. 

00:13:31.214 --> 00:13:32.477
 Bye. 

00:13:32.477 --> 00:13:37.147
 (Music)
