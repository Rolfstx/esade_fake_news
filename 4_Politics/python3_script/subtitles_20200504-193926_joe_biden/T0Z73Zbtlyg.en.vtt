00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.060
You are watching ColdFusion TV.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.240
Hi. Welcome to another ColdFusion video.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.760
In previous ColdFusion videos, we've often seen the success stories

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.340
of some of the largest and most influential companies.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.360
But what about the other side?

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.560
What about the blunders?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.020
missed opportunities,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.420
and utter disasters that in turn,

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.200
brought some companies to ruin.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.740
Well today, you're in luck,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.680
because here are six of such stories.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.420
let's get straight into it.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.660
Number six:

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.380
Kodak had the first digital camera back in 1977.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.400
Whenever technology changes the landscape of an industry,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.920
there are some businesses that adapt and thrive,

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.440
And others that continue to do the same old thing, until it's too late.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.040
For Kodak,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.740
who fell behind, due to the advent of the digital camera,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.420
the situation was a little different.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.440
Kodak actually patented the first digital camera back in 1977.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.920
It was one that used magnetic cassette

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.340
to store images of about 100 kilobytes.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.380
However,

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.660
Over the coming years,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.860
Kodak made so much money off of film,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.660
That they let the new technology gather dust, not realizing its potential.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.540
The company continued to focus on traditional film cameras

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.300
Even it was clear that the market was moving towards digital.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.360
When Kodak finally gone to the digital market,

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.920
They were selling cameras at a loss

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.020
and still couldn't make up enough sales to catch up to those competitors,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.640
which have seen the potential of digital cameras early on.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.060
Currently,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.820
Kodak is losing over two hundred million dollars a year.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.520
The lesson learned:

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.000
In the world of business,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.560
always keep an eye on the market,

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.560
and be responsive to future trends.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:47.720
if not,

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.080
it cost you everything.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.760
Number five:

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.940
Excite could have bought Google for less than one million dollars.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.500
The year is 1999,

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.520
and Excite was the number two search engine, behind Yahoo.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.140
Google back then was a nobody.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.400
The new kid on the block.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.700
It was in this setting, back in '99,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.700
That Larry Page,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.080
offered to sell Google to Excite for $750,000

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.200
according to Excite's CEO at the time, George Bell,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.000
The $750,000 deal was 1% of Excite's worth,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.880
So financing wasn't an issue.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.100
The hiccup came when Larry insisted

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.420
That if the sale went ahead,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.140
Excite was to replace all of its search technology with Google's.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.620
George of Excite, thought that this was too much, and refused the offer.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.620
Excite was eventually bought by Ask Jeeves (now Ask.com) in 2004.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.060
At the time,

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.900
Ask had less than 2% search market share.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.580
Google, currently now known as Alphabet

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.560
processes a billion search results everyday.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.200
They currently have around $147 billion in assets,

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.200
which is more than 196,000 times what Excite would have payed for them.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.500
Ouch.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.340
Number four:

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.660
Blockbuster Video turns down the opportunity to buy Netflix.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.720
The mid-80s to late 90s, where when VHS was king.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.980
The problem back then,

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.220
was that VHS tapes would cost upwards of $97 per movie.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.320
For this reason,

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.480
video rental stores, like Blockbuster

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.980
came in to fill in that gap.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:24.800
They were the perfect solution,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.120
and became a regular part of weekend plans

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.940
for hundreds of millions around the globe.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:58.820
[Blockbuster Commercial]

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.940
Eventually,

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.100
online video streaming services, like Netflix, Hulu and even Putlocker

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.520
destroyed the old video rental business model.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.160
Ironically,

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.620
In the year 2000,

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.140
Netflix proposed that it would handle Blockbuster's online component

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.360
and Blockbuster could host Netflix as an in-store component,

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:18.960
thus eliminating the need to mail DVD's,

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.320
which was Netflix's business model at the time.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.320
According to an interview with former Netflix CEO, Barry McCarthy

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.260
Blockbuster just laughed Netflix out of their office.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.300
But, that's not the end of their story.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.780
By 2007,

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.780
Blockbuster was well on the right track.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.860
They had an internet movie component,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.920
that was steamrolling over Netflix.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.300
Netflix was struggling,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.160
and their upper management wanted to sell the company to blockbuster to save face.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.740
Blockbuster's growth was very strong at the time, so they turned down the offer.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.440
In a strange twist later that year,

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.840
there was a boardroom dispute over Blockbuster,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.520
that saw a change of CEO.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.780
The new CEO was James Keyes (formerly of Seven-Eleven)

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.660
He came in with the wrong mindset,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.740
and thought that Blockbuster should be a retail business instead of an entertainment one.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.920
Because of this,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.080
He didn't see the value of an online component.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.500
Huge mistake.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.760
Within eighteen months,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.180
The new CEO had lost Blockbuster 85% of the company's value.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.540
And within three years, Blockbuster was filing for bankruptcy.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.860
Blockbuster went belly-up, and Netflix went on to thrive.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:22.280
Since then,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.440
Netflix is behind such original shows such as: House of Cards, BoJack Horseman, and Daredevil.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.200
With 83 million subscriptions worldwide,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.900
Netflix has altered the way many view the entertainment.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.560
Number three:

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.720
A grade school math error cost NASA $125 million.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.100
Before the advent of Google,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.020
did you ever get frustrated with the conversions from feet to meters?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.460
Inches to centimeters?

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.640
Did you find it difficult?

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.860
Well, you're in good company.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.440
As it turns out,

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.200
a similar math problem hindered some of the greatest minds in the western world.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.600
In 1999,

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.380
A Mars orbiter, that Lockheed-Martin designed for NASA

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.040
was lost in space due to a simple math error,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.480
in where the engineers at Lockheed used Imperial measurements while the NASA employees used metric ones.

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:13.000
The mismatch led to the thrusters not recieving vital navigation information,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.980
which caused the 125 million dollar spacecraft to malfunction.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.460
The probe was forever lost while trying to get into orbit around Mars

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.760
after a 286-day journey.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.100
There were numerous occasions where the errors should have been caught,

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.860
but, it wasn't.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.660
Number two:

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.820
Nokia outright refusing to use Android.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:35.100
Nokia.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.900
One of the most iconic brands of the 20th century

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.800
and even up to the first decade of the 21st century.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:44.860
The company had about 51% market share on the mobile phone industry

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.620
at their peak in 2007.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.580
But now, they're a shell of their former selves.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.640
A fond, but distant memory for many.

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.420
The start of the company's fall from grace can be attributed to one moment in 2010,

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.700
when Nokia CEO Anssi Vanjoki snobbed his nose up at the idea of using Google's Android software.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.180
You see, at the time, Nokia had their own operating system called Symbian.

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.660
After the release of the iPhone in 2007,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.180
the software development team at Nokia realized that there was a threat.

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.040
So they split into two.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.760
One team tried to revamp Symbian,

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:22.720
and the other team created an entirely new operating system named MeeGo.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.340
The problem was,

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.400
that the two teams were battling for resources from Nokia's top executives.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.720
So in essence,

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.900
there was an internal struggle within the company.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.380
It was so bad, that whenever Nokia was dealing with outside stakeholders,

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.240
like chip manufacturers for example,

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.600
there was so much squabbling within the company,

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.620
that it took the better part of the year to make a decision on anything.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.760
in the tech world, that's way too long.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.440
Competitor innovation waits for no one.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.420
The logical solution, in hindsight of course, was Android.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:58.560
Nokia could have used the open software platform, combine it with their in-house hardware,

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:01.200
to quickly make up for lost time, at minimal cost.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.420
Instead,

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:05.460
Nokia CEO at the time decided to skip on Android,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:09.220
calling it a short term solution likening the move to, Quote:

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.320
"Pissing in your pants in winter to keep warm."

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.740
Nokia kept on working on their own software efforts,

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.640
throwing $5 billion a year of  R&amp;D at the problem, but no avail.

00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.200
As time went on,

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:28.620
The iPhone and Android handsets dominated the market until Nokia's mobile division was left in the dust.

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.400
not long after this, in 2013,

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.960
the Nokia division brand was salvaged by Microsoft for scraps.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.800
Microsoft couldn't make the once legendary company stay afloat either,

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.300
Wasting $8 billion before killing the Nokia mobile brand.

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.720
Moral of the story,

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.100
Move with innovation, and don't let your pride cloud your judgement.

00:08:49.700 --> 00:08:51.700
But wait a second, there is a twist here.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.680
Nokia, the company from Finland,

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:59.660
is said to be returning in 2016, after signing an exclusive agreement with HMD Global.

00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.180
HMD Global is a new company, also based in Finland.

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:08.300
The deal will see the creation of Nokia brand mobile phones and tablets for the next 10 years.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.940
So, I'll see how this one plays out.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:13.840
Number One:

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.920
Xerox, yes the printer company

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:20.820
hand one of the greatest inventions in computing history to Apple.

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:26.260
Imagine having one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century in your hands

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:29.580
and giving it away because you didn't understand what you are holding.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.120
Xerox did just that with the Xerox Alto.

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.300
The Xerox Alto was an experimental computer from 1973,

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.480
created at Xerox's Research Center.

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.020
The Alto was way ahead of it's time.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:45.820
It was the first modern desktop PC, as we recognize them today.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.740
It had a mouse, windows, file managers, and

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.500
it can copy and paste, delete and move files,

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:54.240
It had icons, menus, graphics,

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:58.280
and even a Local Area Network, that connected all the computers together.

00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.540
The idea was to mimic an office desk, but on a screen.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.860
A paperless office of the future.

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.920
Absolutely revolutionary for 1973.

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.660
What the Xerox Alto was demonstrating

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:09.380
was the first Graphical User Interface, or GUI, in a desktop computer.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.740
For those of you not familiar with this time in computing technology,

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:17.720
This is how a typical computer from the late 1970s looked and functioned.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.200
Before GUI's, to do absolutely anything to a computer

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.800
you needed to type commands in lines of text.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.180
If you mistyped anything, that was too bad.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.200
The computer would just spit out an error, saying that it didn't understand.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:10.820
Pointing and clicking on a graphical object was a foreign idea.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:16.940
Thousands of Xerox Alto's were built at the Research Center, but never sold.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.680
Only used heavily in Xerox's offices and at a few universities.

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:25.300
The Xerox upper management did not understand what they had,

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:29.200
the managers just couldn't see, the vision of what the computer of the future will be.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:33.700
But, a man named Steve Jobs did know what the future of the computer could be.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.920
And Xerox handed it straight to him.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.440
Here's how it went down:

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.600
Xerox at the time, needed a way to make their experimental technologies, like the Alto cheaper.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.760
They saw Apple pumping out their Apple II's for a cheap price.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:54.620
So in 1979, they invited Steve Jobs over to their research institute, to see if they could help reduce the cost of production.

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:58.140
The deal saw Xerox gain a million shares of Apple's stock

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.180
In exchange for Steve Jobs was getting the inside information

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:05.160
for everything cool and revolutionary that was going on at the PARC Center.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:11.260
Nobody actually checked with the guys at the research center, but the Apple Business Development Team signed off the deal anyway.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:18.140
The following is from Larry Lester, a Xerox Research Center scientist, and an eyewitness to when Steve Jobs was handed everything.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:22.420
Lester: So, during that demo... uh,

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.640
Steve again got very excited, he was pacing around the room and

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:34.240
occasionally looked at the screen. He was  mostly just looking and then reacting, and taking it all in and trying to process it.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.200
And uh,

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.280
and one point, he said you still not showing us everything.

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.800
And the meeting paused,  and there was some phone calls, and okay, we gonna show you more.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.260
But, Jobs was there going:

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.360
"What is going on here? You're sitting on a goldmine!"

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.960
"Why aren't you doing something with this technology?"

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.420
"You could change the world!"

00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.420
And,

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.000
There were his buddies, who would trying to, you know arrange a negotiation of some kind.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.040
We're tying to quiet him down

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.960
[audience laughs]

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.520
Don't be so excited.

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:10.380
But he was, he was really clear to him that we were never really gonna do anything with this.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:15.720
Ah, the irony was when they left, we'd still showed them like 1% of what PARC was doing.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:25.100
But it was enough, that it got really excited and decided that they were gonna retarget the LISA to be something like what they seen in terms of GUI,

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.540
they fell in love with the mouse,

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:29.220
and uh, that changed everything.

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:31.960
And 7 months after that, I was working at Apple.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.020
Jobs: And,

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:34.520
within

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.300
you know, ten minutes,

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.280
It was obvious to me that all computers would work like this, someday.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:44.960
Basically, they were copier heads, and just had no clue about, uh a computer, what it can do.

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.860
And so they just grabbed the feet from the greatest victory in the computer industry.

00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:54.180
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry today.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.720
The graphical approach to the computer appealed to the human mind

00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:02.320
because commands were now replaced with movements and objects.

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.680
So, it felt natural,

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.620
Typing lines of text was now a thing of the past.

00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:11.720
The ideas from the Alto would heavily influence the Apple LISA,

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.280
whose technology trickles down to the Macintosh,

00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.220
which influenced Microsoft Windows.

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.460
Both of which, were the eventual ancestors to the manner in which our phones operate today.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.480
An the sad thing is Xerox never gets mention for any of this.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.740
Anyway, that's the end of the video.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.600
Those were 6 huge blunders by some top companies.

00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:35.760
I hoped you liked it, give it a thumbs up if you did,

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.980
Also, as another point,

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:47.960

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:51.700
So, if you are a Patreon, you can take part and suggesting what the next video's gonna be.

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:57.040
Thanks again guys, This has been Dagogo, you have been watching ColdFusion, and I'll see you again soon next video.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.420
Cheers and have a good one.

00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.600
ColdFusion. It's new thinking.
