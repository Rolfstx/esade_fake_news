00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.120
Embassies are the vessels through which diplomacy
is conducted.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.090
They are the physical manifestations of countries
abroad are they are crucial tools in the field

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:16.880
of international relations.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.700
These can range in size from tiny, like the
UK embassy in Mongolia which only has a handful

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.160
of staff, to enormous, like the US embassy
in Baghdad—a complex physically as large

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.470
as the Vatican City which reached a peak of
16,000 staff during the Iraq War.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.280
Big, influential countries will have embassies
to almost every other country—the US, for

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.100
example, has diplomatic missions to every
UN recognized country in the world except

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.850
St Kitts and Nevis, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica,
St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Grenada,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.719
Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Bhutan, and North Korea.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.780
Smaller, less influential countries, on the
other hand, might only have a few embassies—Tuvalu,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.230
for example, only has diplomatic missions
to New Zealand, Fiji, Taiwan, the European

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.030
Union in Belgium, and the United Nations in
New York.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.360
You see, there are embassies to non-state
organizations—namely the UN and EU.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.899
You can even have embassies to agencies of
the UN—there’s one US diplomat in Rome

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.820
with the lengthy title of, “United States
Ambassador to the United Nations Agencies

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.460
for Food and Agriculture.”

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.810
Even traditionally closed off countries like
North Korea have representation abroad.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.960
The DPRK has embassies in some quite western
countries like Germany, Sweden, and the UK

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.060
and these three countries also each have embassies
in North Korea.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.119
Now, part of the way these embassies can exist
in even the most different and opposing of

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.120
countries is because of how they are codified
in international law.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.479
Every UN member state except for South Sudan,
Palau, and the Solomon Islands has signed

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.229
the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.590
This sets out a number of laws on how embassies
work.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.770
Perhaps the most significant and well known
is Article 22—“The premises of the mission

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.149
shall be inviolable.”

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.840
Unless invited by the ambassador or their
government, any representative of the host

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.679
country’s government—be it a police officer,
government official, member of the military,

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:04.640
or even firefighter—cannot enter the embassy.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.220
This, of course, is how Julian Assange stayed
in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London for seven

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.220
years.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.940
He entered in 2012 when he was wanted in the
UK for extradition to and subsequent arrest

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.170
in Sweden.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.480
Assange stayed in the embassy while his request
for Ecuadorian political asylum was reviewed

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.490
and, once it was granted, normally the next
step would be to go to Ecuador.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.030
Outside the embassy, though, waited British
police and so he would therefore have been

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.170
arrested if he ever left.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.590
In the end, though, after seven years inside,
it was the British police that arrested Assange

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:40.450
as the Ecuadorians decided Assange had overstayed
his welcome and invited the police inside.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.770
The Vienna convention also lays out a few
other important rules for embassies—the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.150
diplomats and the embassy are exempt from
all taxes in the host country; the diplomats

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.130
are allowed free movement around the host
country; an embassy can have diplomatic couriers

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.520
carrying diplomatic bags which cannot be seized
or searched; diplomats are granted diplomatic

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.700
immunity; the residences of diplomats are
also treated as an extension of the embassy

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.840
and cannot be entered without permission;
diplomats cannot work or earn a profit when

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.510
in their host country except for with the
embassy; and then there are plenty of other

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.170
even more minor rules
Now, one big misconception about embassies

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.640
is that this is an embassy.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.620
It’s not, this is a chancery—the building
in which an embassy is located.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.510
The, “embassy” is not the building, its
the group people that work inside the building.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.440
It is the group of workers that represent
the country abroad.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.160
Another big misconception about embassy buildings
are that they are the sovereign territory

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.980
of the country they represent.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.060
This is not the case.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.760
It is also not they case that embassy buildings
are in a state of extraterritoriality—that

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.410
local laws don’t apply there as would be
the case in the United Nation headquarters

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.640
or on many foreign military bases.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.930
In the case of embassy buildings, it’s not
that the laws of the host country don’t

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.040
apply there, it’s just that many of the
people that make up the embassy, the diplomats,

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.720
cannot be prosecuted for violating those laws
and those that enforce the law, the police,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.030
can’t enter.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.930
Now, diplomats almost always follow the rules
of their host country as failing to do so

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.750
would be unproductive for the very nature
of their job, but when they don’t, this

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.820
can have serious implications.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.410
As an example, in April 1984, two students
in Tripoli, Libya were hung for publicly opposing

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:15.410
Gaddafi.

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.680
In response, a protest was formed by a major
political opposition group outside the Libyan

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.180
embassy in London.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.260
On order from Gaddafi, an individual inside
the embassy building fired into the crowd

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.800
with a machine gun, wounding eleven.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.710
One of those wounded was Yvonne Fletcher,
a young policewoman, who later died in the

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.010
hospital from her injuries.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.470
Within 10 minutes of the shots going off,
the embassy building was surrounded by British

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.200
police, blocking anyone from going in or out.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.480
Once it had been confirmed through forensic
autopsy that the shots did indeed come from

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.160
the embassy, negotiations began.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.980
The British tried to get permission to enter
the embassy building.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.810
You see, only some, but not all of the 30
people in the building were diplomats meaning

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.540
that some, if they were found to have committed
the crime, could be arrested for it.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.720
The Libyans, however, would not grant access.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.750
Therefore, after five days of surrounding
the embassy, the British severed diplomatic

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.240
relations with Libya, giving them another
week to leave the embassy and country.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.620
This, you see, is what countries can do when
diplomats misbehave.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.060
They can’t go into the embassy building,
they can’t arrest diplomats, but they can

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.120
kick them out of their country.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.560
After this incident, diplomatic relations
between the two countries didn’t normalize

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.889
for decades and, even today, in 2019, the
case is still actively under investigation

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:32.070
and its quite possible an arrest could happen
in the future.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.580
Normally, though, embassies are more concerned
with building diplomacy.

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.700
Typically, but not always, embassies are headed
up by an ambassador.

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:44.210
Sometimes, though, there are lapses where
one goes without an ambassador for a period

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.280
of time and other times, a country might choose
to recall their ambassador as a sign of displeasure.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.800
Now, the job of ambassador is tough to define.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.210
In the simplest since, an Ambassador is there
to represent their country but what that entails

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.480
varies wildly from person to person and post
to post.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.780
There’s often a perception that all that
ambassadors do is schmooze and booze but,

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.780
to be honest, that’s part of the job.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.200
They’re there to build and maintain relationships
with those that can help their country—politically,

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.270
economically, or otherwise.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:17.950
That’s just part of diplomacy which is what
the embassy’s job as a whole is.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.310
This can be direct diplomacy, where the ambassador
might meet directly with a head of state,

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:23.970
or soft diplomacy.

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.780
Soft diplomacy can be things like China sending
pandas to foreign zoos, the US funding scholarships

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:32.630
for foreign students, or France setting up
a branch of the Louvre in Abu Dhabi.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:37.060
They are more subtle ways that a nation can
curry public favor with another.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.230
On a smaller scale, embassies will often have
a portion of staff dedicated to promoting

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:44.530
and exhibiting the art and culture of their
country in the region.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.970
You’ll often see embassies financially supporting
and sponsoring concerts of their country’s

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:50.040
music, for example.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:54.680
Now, in addition to these ways of representing
one’s country, the embassy also represents

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.370
its homeland through its actual building.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.740
As the public face of one country in another,
it’s got to look the part.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.130
For example, some of the world’s most impressive
and important embassies are in Washington,

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:10.010
DC given that nearly every nation has a diplomatic
mission there.

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.130
The Chinese embassy building was designed
by the children of I.M. Pei, a Chinese-American

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:18.440
regarded as one of the world’s greatest
architects, and evokes the same sense of clean,

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.350
contemporary grandeur and opulence common
with the greatest buildings back in the People’s

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:26.200
Republic itself while still adhering to Feng
Shui principles.

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.889
Just down the street there’s the embassy
building of the United Arab Emirates—a perhaps

00:07:29.889 --> 00:07:34.310
even more opulent structure clearly incorporating
aspects of Islamic Architecture.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.250
This building seems to purposefully command
a presence with its open sightline from the

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.910
street allowing one to look in and up.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.479
Then there’s this section of the British
Embassy complex nearby—a structure resembling

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:47.350
an old English Country Manor.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.500
While countries like China and UAE might be
more focused on pushing their modern image

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.850
as newly wealthy nations, countries like the
UK might draw more attention to their long

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.050
and storied past.

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:02.350
There’s then the whole realm of the architecture
of American embassy complexes themselves.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:06.760
With necessity, after countless attacks on
its embassies through history, the architecture

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.729
and design of American embassy buildings evokes
security.

00:08:10.729 --> 00:08:16.550
Whether its the one in Berlin, Beijing, Bern,
or Bangkok, they all have the look of a compound.

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.910
They’re mostly modern, innovative designs,
a conscious choice to associate these values

00:08:20.910 --> 00:08:25.910
to the nation’s image, but they’re still
mostly hidden behind tall walls and fences.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.790
There are still some, though, mostly in places
where security is less of a concern, reflecting

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:34.090
the earlier architectural style of the US
such as the Georgian House of the US Embassy

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:38.519
in Canberra, Australia—a building that would
look right at place in the American south.

00:08:38.519 --> 00:08:42.529
But when embassies are in certain places their
buildings can’t just be compound-style.

00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:45.310
They have to be compounds.

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:49.540
As the physical representations of countries,
embassies are the clearest targets for those

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:52.269
wishing to send a message to a country.

00:08:52.269 --> 00:08:57.100
During wars, though, there is often more work
than ever for embassies to do in a country.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:01.990
This is why, as mentioned earlier, the US
embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, ballooned to over

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.600
16,000 staff during the Iraq War.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:08.630
The embassy building was built in the Green
Zone—a highly fortified area along the Tigris

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.129
River in Baghdad.

00:09:10.129 --> 00:09:14.790
This area, guarded by soldiers and walls more
than nine feet or three meters tall, was and

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:18.529
still is home to much of the international
presence in Baghdad.

00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:24.410
That included embassies of countries like
the US, UK, and Australia, but also some companies.

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:28.639
War is big business and the Green Zone was
home to small field headquarters for many

00:09:28.639 --> 00:09:33.189
large, international engineering, construction,
and private military firms contracted to help

00:09:33.189 --> 00:09:34.259
in the war.

00:09:34.259 --> 00:09:38.559
That is to say, the Green Zone was primarily
home to a large group of civilians working

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:41.790
in Iraq which is why it was so heavily guarded.

00:09:41.790 --> 00:09:46.059
Given the security threat, the US embassy
there was built to be entirely self sufficient.

00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:51.360
It has its own generators, its own wells,
its own water filtration plant, its own sewage

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.259
plant, its own fire station, it even has its
own internet uplink to circumvent the Iraqi

00:09:56.259 --> 00:09:57.259
network.

00:09:57.259 --> 00:10:01.269
It has its own phone network—both wired
and wireless—which both operate pretty much

00:10:01.269 --> 00:10:05.709
as if they were in the US—they use the area
codes of New York and Virginia.

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:09.991
Unlike in most cities where embassy staff
just live in normal housing in the city, this

00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:13.550
embassy has its own block of fortified apartments.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:17.209
Even during the thick of the war, the embassy
compound had its own swimming pool, tennis

00:10:17.209 --> 00:10:21.619
courts, fitness center, department store,
nail salon, and movie theatre.

00:10:21.619 --> 00:10:25.929
Topping it off is a helicopter pad—used
to get the ambassador and other top diplomats

00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:29.480
around the country when they don’t want
to confront the dangers of below.

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.230
The diplomats serving as part of the US embassy
in Baghdad do get another perk in addition

00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:38.929
to the pool and tennis courts and movie theatre
and everything else—they get more money.

00:10:38.929 --> 00:10:43.779
You see, when working in the US foreign service,
and its often similar when working for other

00:10:43.779 --> 00:10:47.890
countries’ foreign service, you essentially
get more money the more foreign a place you

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:48.890
go.

00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.149
If you’re serving pretty much anywhere in
North America, Western Europe, Australasia,

00:10:52.149 --> 00:10:55.509
and a few other assorted countries, you get
no bonus.

00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:59.389
If you serve in a place that has an extreme
climate, poor quality of healthcare, high

00:10:59.389 --> 00:11:03.509
crime, high pollution, or has any other factor
that makes it more difficult to live there

00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:08.339
as a foreigner, you get hardship pay which
is a bonus that ranges anywhere from 5% to

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:09.709
35%.

00:11:09.709 --> 00:11:15.300
That 5% rate includes places like Costa Rica,
the Bahamas, Malta, and Bulgaria while the

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:21.480
35% rate is reserved for places like the Central
African Republic, Somalia, Libya, Syria, Iraq,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.420
Afghanistan, and Pakistan.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:26.839
That rate of hardship pay can also vary within
a country.

00:11:26.839 --> 00:11:31.689
For example, if you served at the US consulate
in Dubai you’d only get a 5% bonus while

00:11:31.689 --> 00:11:34.559
serving at the US embassy in Abu Dhabi would
get you 10%.

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:39.350
There are also some places that, well, just
don’t seem all that hard to live in but

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:44.319
do earn you hardship pay such as Ponta Delgada,
Portugal, a well-known vacation destination.

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:47.430
This is likely only included because of its
isolation.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:51.220
On top of hardship pay, you can also get an
additional bonus if you serve in a place that

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:52.410
is deemed dangerous.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:58.089
For example, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, gets you
15% while places like Tripoli, Damascus, Kabul,

00:11:58.089 --> 00:12:01.329
Baghdad, and Juba will get you a 35% bonus.

00:12:01.329 --> 00:12:06.600
So, in a place like Baghdad, you get a 70%
bonus just for the hardship and danger you

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.009
put yourself through.

00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:12.399
This is how they get people to work at even
the harshest of postings without forcing them.

00:12:12.399 --> 00:12:16.100
On top of these two, there are also some other
bonuses based off things like high cost of

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:18.989
living, difficulty in staffing the post, and
more.

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:24.410
Now, in the modern age, some have questioned
whether embassies still have a purpose.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:29.649
100 years ago they very much had a purpose
as communication was difficult, travel was

00:12:29.649 --> 00:12:33.690
slow, and countries therefore needed someone
on the ground who could speak on their behalf

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:36.120
to others at a moment’s notice.

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:40.639
Nowadays, though, messages can be relayed
instantaneously through a whole host of means

00:12:40.639 --> 00:12:42.180
so what’s the point?

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.720
Well, ambassadors are not messengers.

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.949
Ambassadors are representatives.

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:51.160
They are there not only to work for their
country within political systems, but also

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.509
to promote it to the public as to increase
travel and trade with their country.

00:12:55.509 --> 00:13:00.179
Many argue, in fact, that these small, personal
relationships of our world’s diplomats tying

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:06.670
together countries of hundreds of millions
or billions are more important now than ever.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:10.389
If you want to work in the foreign service,
the US State Department has an extensive reading

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:14.379
list of books that will help to get the knowledge
you need no matter which country you’re

00:13:14.379 --> 00:13:15.379
from.

00:13:15.379 --> 00:13:18.970
One book on there that I found quite interesting
was, “Blink: The Power of Thinking Without

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:20.649
Thinking,” by Malcolm Gladwell.

00:13:20.649 --> 00:13:24.709
The book is all about how the unconscious
brain works in making decisions with very

00:13:24.709 --> 00:13:25.779
limited info.

00:13:25.779 --> 00:13:30.369
Blink, like so many other books, is available
as an audiobook on Audible so you can listen

00:13:30.369 --> 00:13:32.269
to it wherever and whenever.

00:13:32.269 --> 00:13:36.759
I find that listening to books helps me fit
in a lot more in and it helps make things

00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:39.499
like cleaning or commuting a lot more fun.

00:13:39.499 --> 00:13:46.489
Best of all, you can sign up for free at audible.com/wendover
or text, “wendover” to 500-500 and download

00:13:46.489 --> 00:13:51.380
Blink, or any other audiobook for free in
addition to two Audible originals also for

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:51.849
free.
