00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.820
- How is the food catering loaded on to the
world's biggest aeroplane behind me?

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.080
What an interesting process in the kitchen
here!

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.740
- Sam, we wash 14,000 glasses a day here.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.580
- [Sam] Ooh!

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:14.500
Wow!

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.620
- Welcome to our show kitchen.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.700
- They're going to show me what kind of food
I will get on board.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.760
- [Both] Welcome aboard Singapore Airlines.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:30.590
Lunch is ready!

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.980
- I am going to try out the Western option
designed by chef Dennis.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.180
- Kung Pao chicken.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.180
- Ooh.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.580
- Oh no!

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.160
First time in to a catering truck.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.160
This is the chilled appetiser.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.470
He makes 300 pillows a day.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.530
I think that for the cabin cleanliness here,
you know, you can tell that Singapore Airlines

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.230
have done a lot of work behind the scenes.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.260
Guys, this is heavy.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.880
This is almost 30 kilograms.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.940
Today, I've taken a field trip out here to
the airport to learn and watch how the food

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.780
catering is loaded on to the world's biggest
aeroplane behind me, an A380.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.000
- And now that the safety procedures are done,
now the driver will get up and open the door

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.380
and change the trolleys.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.290
- Wow, first time in to a catering truck.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.280
You have to climb up really high up here.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.260
Isn't this amazing?

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.360
There's an elevator that can go up to the
aeroplane door level.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.750
Not bad - we should use this catering truck
for aeroplane spotting as well because you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.400
can go up and down, like a lift!

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.180
(Knocking)

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.120
They only have one hour to load
up the whole A380, so everything has to be

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.720
arranged in a perfect order to be able to go
in and out readily.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.870
This is the passage - now that the catering
truck has reached the second door, we can

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.370
come inside like this.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.820
This is how they offload and load the new
catering.

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.580
- Now they are first loading the new, fresh
laundry and linen.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.420
- And now he's also removing the old dirty
ones back.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.340
- Yeah.
- I see.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.380
So now you can see the cabin here.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.251
Singapore Airlines - very clean I must say.

00:02:57.251 --> 00:03:01.840
They remove all the dirty covers and during
the turnaround, they put fresh ones on.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.270
I don't think that every airline is doing
this, honestly, but I think that, in terms

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.330
of cabin cleanliness here, you know, you can
tell that Singapore Airlines has done a lot

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.860
of work behind the scenes here.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.720
And this is the chilled appetiser in this
cart.

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.620
This is going to the galley.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.020
Let me give you a hand.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.600
Food, going inside.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.700
What's this inside here?

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.320
What's this cold pack here?

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.320
Ice?
- Ice.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.280
- Oh, just ice.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.320
And I'm taking out all the trash.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320
Guys, this is heavy.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.720
This is almost 30 kilograms.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.540
This is such an interesting experience.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.690
I love this kind of work because I get to
see what's behind all of the preparation and

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.049
of course I'm just here for acting, pretending
to help out, but still, I learn a lot.

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:57.350
- Sam, in total, we loaded 14 on the upper
deck and 25 on the lower deck.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:58.350
- Now we're complete.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.350
- Yep.

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.069
- Quick - that was less than a one hour turnaround.

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.300
- Yes, I can teach you.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.300
- Yeah?

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.600
- First, there's a unit, there's a unit...
- From where?

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.580
Ah here, from here.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.540
Ah nice!

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.840
I mean, I love this pillow.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.360
Look at how nice the pillow is - the pillow
is plush.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.580
Economy class in Singapore airlines - good
pillow!

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.260
But imagine this man here - he makes 300 pillows
a day.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.879
After one hour of hard work, what a transformation.

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:27.080
Everything is just like brand new.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.580
Everything here just feels so fresh.

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.200
- Welcome to Gate Gourmet, Zurich.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.159
We're going to give you a behind the scenes
tour in our facility where we produce up to

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:49.969
65,000 meals a day.

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:50.969
- Come on, let's go.

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:51.969
- [Sam] Let's go!

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:57.439
- So Sam, this is our goods receiving area
where we decant most of our products.

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:05.090
We make a security check and a quality check
here before items are loaded in to these grey

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.830
bins and stored away in our dry store.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:15.500
So here we start our washing process for all
the incoming materials from the airlines.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.979
- The interesting thing about this conveyor
belt is that all the trays and the plates

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:31.613
go this way and all the garbage goes up there,
so what an interesting process that goes on

00:05:31.613 --> 00:05:32.680
in the kitchen here!

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.229
- Okay Sam, so here on the clean side of the
three and a half minutes washing, the equipment

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:44.119
comes out clean and washed, disinfected by
temperature and by chemicals.

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:45.119
- Wow!

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.080
- We wash it with chemicals and with hot water.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.400
- All done by machine in three and a half
minutes!

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:51.900
- No hand washing!

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.539
Sam, we wash 14,000 glasses a day and all
of them need to be spotless.

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.980
- Let me have a look.

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.660
Yeah, I can see from top to bottom.

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:03.669
Spotless.

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.659
And how many do you break every day, here?

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:07.960
- Oh, we can't say but it's not that many.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.960
- I didn't see you guys.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.960
You guys are either here or behind.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.229
- I knew I was going to meet you here some
day.

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:13.229
- Yeah.

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.719
- We're going to make one video so you will
see it on YouTube soon!

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:21.659
- So, not only does the glassware and the
china need to be washed but also the trolleys

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:23.649
are cleaned and disinfected.

00:06:23.649 --> 00:06:25.949
- Sam, do you know what this is here?

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:31.149
These are all the oven racks, we call them,
where we place the meals for later in the

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:32.180
oven in the aircraft.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:36.480
And they are also washed - they are very clean,
very washed and sanitised.

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.680
- [Sam] So now we are going to the kitchen.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.119
That's why we're doing this, right?

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.080
- Yes, correct.
- Okay, got it.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:42.119
How many times do you do this everyday?

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.000
- I can do that up to twenty times.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.880
- Ooh, it smells very nice actually.
- This is the hot kitchen.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.780
- It smells nice.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.480
- One of our biggest constraints here is consistency.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:03.120
In order to get every meal cooked the same, we have invented CRA - coordinated recipe assembly.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.220
We do this collectively.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.620
So if you look at this trolley, we have a
sheet here where everything is weighed for the recipe.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:16.980
The chef has the recipe and he can look at
it - he knows what he needs to cook and for how many.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:22.460
And in order to keep this assembly, this trolley
is all ready for the chef.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.040
So the chef is getting the trolley and then
he can start, basically, cooking.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:28.440
- [Sam] This is a boiler, right, this is a
boiler?

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.919
- This is a boiler.

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:30.919
- I see, for boiling the vegetables?

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.620
- Yes, you can boil, you can braise.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.920
You can also slow cook - it's a multi-functional
tool.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:44.220
Everything is still done very conventionally
like in any other kitchen you can find.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.800
- This is rare.
- That is correct.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.760
- Why is it like that?

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:51.120
- They are only colouring it here - afterwards,
you will see, that it will go in to the oven

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.160
where we sear it.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:59.120
- From the chicken breast which you just saw
being fried, we produce about 1000-1200 every day.

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.399
- So this is where we cook everything - you
saw the chicken just now.

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.600
After it's cooked, it's put in here.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.180
A cooked and chilled process.

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:10.720
- [Sam] Aah.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.880
In here they are chilling, yeah.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.080
Woah!

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.560
- [Manager] And what is this?

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.480
It is danger!

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.420
- [Sam] Danger?
- Chilli powder.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.650
Sam, one of the things that we are very proud
of in this kitchen is that we still have a

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:39.020
dedicated patisserie.

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:43.090
We still make our desserts and cakes in-house.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.340
Come on - can you smell it?

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:49.980
Still hot.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.360
- Ooh.

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.180
- Look at it.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.440
- Oh, crumble.

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:54.240
- Crumble with rhubarb.

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.400
- Wow!

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.960
Guys, I wish you could smell it through the
camera!

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.160
This is for...

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.630
What is this?

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.480
- (He speaks foreign language)

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.500
- Okay, so this is the base for the cake.

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.000
Now that we have seen the cooking, we have
to see the preparation and here we see the

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.110
dishing out and the preparation for the next
flight.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.220
- Okay, this is the packing here, the assembly.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.640
- We call it "making a pack."

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.390
Are you hungry?

00:09:22.390 --> 00:09:23.390
- Very hungry.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:25.150
You are ensuring consistency in the weight.

00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:26.150
- Correct.

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:27.150
- More or less the same, right?

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.150
Every single plate.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.150
- No, every...

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.150
- Has to be exactly the same?

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:31.230
- It has to be exactly the same.

00:09:31.230 --> 00:09:32.230
- Wow.

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:33.690
- Right, this is your rhubarb cake.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.690
Look at it.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:36.040
It's like in the bakery.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.070
- So this is the final product?

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.120
- That's the final product.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.120
- Ooh.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.600
- And now it will go in to the bowl.

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.260
- Look at this.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:45.080
Oh my God.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.010
This is the crab with the asparagus.

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:48.320
I love it.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.420
And you have to pick the good one, right?
- [Woman] Yes.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.140
- Yeah.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:01.460
- Sam, one thing I wanted to show you - what
we are really proud of and what we do here

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:08.410
- is bringing people in to the work life again,
in to the system, people who had maybe a burn-out,

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.860
who have left the workforce and who are slowly
returning.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.470
We have a dedicated area here for them.

00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:18.580
They are doing lighter duties - they do, for
instance, cutlery packing, checking the cutlery

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:23.780
- that it is clean, that it is packed and
with a napkin inside and collecting all of those items.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:28.680
Those people are special to us because we
become like a family.

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:33.500
We work together as a family and we are proud
to help them actually come back in to the workforce.

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.260
80 people who help us to make 65,000 passengers happy each day.

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.400
- Welcome back to Singapore Airlines.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:57.240
I just came on board and the flight's really,
really full but I was very lucky - at check in,

00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:01.620
I was able to get one of the bulkhead
seats; 91 Delta.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.060
Yeah, it sounds scary.

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:04.860
91 - all the way at the back.

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:05.860
And this is a bulkhead seat.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:09.050
You have unlimited leg room.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:12.940
So I was really, really happy with this seat
here and, of course, I'm looking forward to

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.420
seeing all of the catering later.

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.420
- Would you like to have any chicken or beef
saute?

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:29.300
- Chicken saute please.

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.040
- Sure, certainly.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:35.720
- The first course is the famous Singapore
Airlines saute.

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:42.040
I just love the peanut sauce on the saute.

00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.580
- [Both] Welcome on board Singapore Airlines.

00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:50.800
Lunch is ready!

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.160
- I am going to try out the Western option
designed by chef Dennis and also the Asian

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.800
option designed by chef CK.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.030
Let's see which one is better.

00:12:00.030 --> 00:12:03.759
So this is the dish that I was watching Chef
Dennis make yesterday.

00:12:03.759 --> 00:12:04.759
- Hi Sam.

00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.100
Welcome to our show kitchen.

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:08.900
- Ooh.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.020
- It's slow cooked veal cheek.

00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:11.020
- Veal cheek.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.290
- This is really, really specific for the
Swiss.

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:18.080
This (mumbles), breast, veal cheek.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:19.140
- So you like this kind of...

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:19.960
And it's very soft.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:21.620
It must be...
- Very soft.
- ...Very tender.

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.000
- Very tender and the sauce is intensive.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.680
Cut around.

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:30.420
- Aah.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.120
So you've taken all of these middle bits out.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.120
- Correct.

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.120
- Right.

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:35.120
Okay.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.640
Making it smooth - nice.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Woah.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.100
- This is the part that we use for the slow
cooked veal cheek.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:52.310
- Let me tell you; it was this big and it
reduced to this.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.310
- Yes.

00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:54.310
- Look at this size difference.

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.090
So now you put the artichoke in the...

00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:57.900
- In the vacuum bag.
- ...Vacuum bag.

00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:06.220
- And then together with the really tasty
vegetable stock and give the flavour to the artichoke.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:11.980
This step is really important to cook it through
because, otherwise, if you have air inside,

00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:13.460
then it's not working.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:21.660
We remove 100% of the air and we have only
the stock and the artichokes in the bag.

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:22.640
- Wow.

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.200
- Just the stock and the artichokes.
- Look at this.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.280
- Oh, this is a boiler.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.240
This is 85 degrees.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.620
- Correct, you can see here.

00:13:27.620 --> 00:13:28.240
- Aha.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:35.180
- Just so you know, I love my job because
I can do a lot for different customers.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:40.000
Great menus and millions of people can taste
it on the aircraft.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.820
- [Sam] That plating was so beautiful.

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:48.160
The meat's very tender but to be honest, there's
lots and lots of vegetables.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:50.520
I'm not used to so many vegetables.

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:51.560
It might not be my kind of dish.

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.880
Cooking Kung Pao chicken.

00:13:58.180 --> 00:13:59.180
Vinegar.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.840
- [Chef] And then basically, we just simmer
it.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.400
- Oh, in Cantonese, we would say that this
is Lo Tao.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.840
And this is thickening with the starch.

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.840
Okay.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.720
- It's moulding to the...
- Yeah.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.520
- ...Consistency that we want.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.420
- Kung Pao is (mumbles) advise.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.300
- You can tell that it's fully cooked now
and then we're going to start putting the sauce in.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:23.700
- Cashew nuts at the end.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.840
Yeah, here, Kung Pao chicken coming up.

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:26.850
Ooh.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:27.850
Oh no!

00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:28.850
I'm so sorry!

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.450
I'm going to clean it up and then I'm going
to eat it like that.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:32.780
I'm so sorry.

00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:34.191
- Yeah, I think that we'll put the rice on
top.

00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:36.790
- Let's put the rice on top and eat it like
this.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:43.580
- I see that you enjoyed your Kung Pao chicken
rather than (mumbles).

00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:45.620
- Okay, I think that it was a tight race.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.430
Both were very good but I think that I do
have a personal preference.

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:50.690
The Asian dish came out a little bit better
for me.

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:51.690
- Better for you.

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.690
- As a personal preference, yeah.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:53.690
Thank you very much.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:55.730
- It's good to know that you enjoyed your
meal, Mr Chui.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.140
- Thank you so much for spoiling me.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:01.320
Only on Singapore Airlines do you get to choose
two main courses instead of one.

00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.400
- It's my pleasure.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.060
- Thanks so much.
