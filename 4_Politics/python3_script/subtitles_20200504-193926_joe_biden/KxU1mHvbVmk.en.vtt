there and we had to run our heater so
that's<00:11:56.810><c> why</c><00:11:57.350><c> we</c><00:11:57.500><c> use</c><00:11:57.620><c> so</c><00:11:57.800><c> much</c><00:11:57.829><c> propane</c><00:11:58.190><c> if</c><00:11:58.519><c> it</c>

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's why we use so much propane if it

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:48.620 align:start position:0%
we were doing nine dollars a day so that
 

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.350 align:start position:0%
we were doing nine dollars a day so that
brought<00:13:48.800><c> down</c><00:13:49.010><c> our</c><00:13:49.220><c> overall</c><00:13:49.700><c> overall</c><00:13:50.060><c> cost</c>

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
brought down our overall overall cost
 

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
brought down our overall overall cost
and<00:13:50.780><c> I</c><00:13:51.170><c> do</c><00:13:51.440><c> say</c><00:13:51.740><c> nine</c><00:13:51.920><c> dollars</c><00:13:52.220><c> a</c><00:13:52.250><c> day</c><00:13:52.490><c> but</c><00:13:52.670><c> that</c>

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:52.850 align:start position:0%
and I do say nine dollars a day but that
 

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.060 align:start position:0%
and I do say nine dollars a day but that
is<00:13:52.880><c> not</c><00:13:53.150><c> computed</c><00:13:53.660><c> into</c><00:13:53.810><c> our</c><00:13:54.050><c> campground</c><00:13:54.560><c> so</c>

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:55.070 align:start position:0%
is not computed into our campground so
 

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:56.710 align:start position:0%
is not computed into our campground so
technically<00:13:55.550><c> that</c><00:13:55.640><c> was</c><00:13:55.880><c> another</c><00:13:56.150><c> free</c><00:13:56.480><c> month</c>

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
technically that was another free month
 

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
technically that was another free month
because<00:13:56.930><c> that's</c><00:13:57.140><c> computed</c><00:13:57.680><c> in</c><00:13:58.010><c> our</c><00:13:58.610><c> fuel</c><00:13:59.000><c> and</c>

00:13:59.200 --> 00:13:59.210 align:start position:0%
because that's computed in our fuel and
 

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:01.240 align:start position:0%
because that's computed in our fuel and
our<00:13:59.270><c> propane</c><00:13:59.660><c> costs</c><00:13:59.990><c> and</c><00:14:00.170><c> then</c><00:14:00.710><c> staying</c><00:14:01.010><c> on</c>

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:01.250 align:start position:0%
our propane costs and then staying on
 

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:03.220 align:start position:0%
our propane costs and then staying on
military<00:14:01.760><c> campgrounds</c><00:14:02.420><c> we</c><00:14:02.570><c> stayed</c><00:14:02.840><c> shorter</c>

00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:03.230 align:start position:0%
military campgrounds we stayed shorter
 

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.830 align:start position:0%
military campgrounds we stayed shorter
we<00:14:03.320><c> helped</c><00:14:03.620><c> a</c><00:14:03.860><c> couple</c><00:14:04.400><c> of</c><00:14:04.550><c> months</c><00:14:04.970><c> here</c><00:14:05.660><c> and</c>

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
