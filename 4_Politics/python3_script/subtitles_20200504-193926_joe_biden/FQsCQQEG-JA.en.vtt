00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:09.033
 (dramatic instrumental music)

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:13.033
 NARRATOR: Plague,
 influenza, Ebola,

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:16.167
 the most contagious and
 deadly diseases in the world

00:00:16.267 --> 00:00:19.400
 could be on our
 doorstep overnight.

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.801
Would we recognize the symptoms?

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:25.634
 Can we treat the disease or
 even keep it from spreading?

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:26.400
 The margin of error,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.734
 zero.

00:00:29.834 --> 00:00:32.501
 At stake for the medical
 team, their own lives,

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.334
 the safety of their families

00:00:34.434 --> 00:00:36.267
 and the community
 where they live.

00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:40.033
An elite group at a Nebraska
hospital, faced the real thing.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:41.467
 This was not a drill.

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:43.267
 The lessons learned treating

00:00:43.367 --> 00:00:45.300
 three different
 patients with Ebola

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.601
 reshaped high-risk emergency
 medicine nationwide.

00:00:49.701 --> 00:00:52.968
 The crisis passed, but
 a question remains.

00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:55.767
 Are we ready for what
 comes After Ebola?

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:59.300
 (dramatic instrumental music)

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.868
 (easygoing instrumental music)

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:13.801
DR. ALI KHAN: Nature is
experimenting 24 hours a day,

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:17.300
seven days a week,
365 days a year,

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.634
so it's a little bit of a
Frankenstein-type picture

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:23.000
that nature runs continuously,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.701
and we're never sure what
the new bug is going to be.

00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:29.467
We have to be prepared for that.

00:01:30.968 --> 00:01:33.234
 NARRATOR: Do an Internet
 search for recent new coverage

00:01:33.334 --> 00:01:36.334
 of pandemic or
 infectious disease

00:01:36.434 --> 00:01:38.300
and you will find recent stories

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.734
 about a high-risk outbreak
 somewhere in the world.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:44.267
 Science can identify
 a virus quickly,

00:01:44.367 --> 00:01:46.767
 but the world
 remains vulnerable.

00:01:46.868 --> 00:01:50.000
 Avian flu, smallpox, cholera,

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.601
 new strains of tuberculosis.

00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:55.567
DR. KHAN: I don't need to point
to some hypothetical disease

00:01:55.667 --> 00:01:56.634
in the future.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:58.667
I'll point to Zika and
say "We're not ready."

00:01:58.767 --> 00:01:59.901
Clearly, we're not ready.

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:01.734
NURSE: So, before
that patient gets here,

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:02.767
we need to have--

00:02:02.868 --> 00:02:04.033
DR. KHAN: There's a
lot of work that needs

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:07.167
to happen in hospitals and
in public health departments

00:02:07.267 --> 00:02:10.400
to make sure we are ready
for the next pandemic.

00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:12.267
 (sirens blaring)

00:02:12.367 --> 00:02:14.300
 (camera clicking)

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.734
 NARRATOR: Then came Ebola.

00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:18.434
 A unique set of
 circumstances gave

00:02:18.534 --> 00:02:20.567
 the University of
 Nebraska Medical Center

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:23.567
 the extraordinary opportunity
 to encounter face-to-face

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:26.033
 patients infected with one

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:27.567
of the world's most frightening

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:30.300
and highly infectious diseases.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.901
 This became, in a
 sense, a dress rehearsal

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.334
 for the worst-case scenario.

00:02:37.167 --> 00:02:38.300
DR. PHIL SMITH: What
do you think we'll get?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.534
It wouldn't be the
first one we'll get.

00:02:39.634 --> 00:02:41.334
If we get one, which one
would you rather get.

00:02:41.434 --> 00:02:44.000
Somebody piped up and
said, "I really hope

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.801
"we don't get Ebola 'cause
that's the worst of the worst."

00:02:46.901 --> 00:02:48.667
NURSE: When you're docking,
the only things

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:50.801
you take off yourself
are your gloves

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:52.868
and your respiratory protection.

00:02:52.968 --> 00:02:54.234
 NARRATOR: A special
 unit on the campus

00:02:54.334 --> 00:02:56.267
 of the University of
 Nebraska Medical Center

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:58.634
 spent 10 years
 preparing for patients

00:02:58.734 --> 00:03:01.567
 with dangerous,
 highly-contagious diseases.

00:03:01.667 --> 00:03:03.534
 REPORTER: This is
 the deadliest outbreak

00:03:03.634 --> 00:03:05.167
 of Ebola on record.

00:03:05.267 --> 00:03:07.601
 FEMALE REPORTER:
 Ebola infections will
 double every three weeks.

00:03:07.701 --> 00:03:10.234
 MALE REPORTER: In a city of a
 million, almost 50 new cases

00:03:10.334 --> 00:03:12.534
 are reported every day.

00:03:12.634 --> 00:03:14.601
 NARRATOR: In 2014,
 the Ebola virus swept

00:03:14.701 --> 00:03:16.501
 through West Africa.

00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.968
 More than 11,000
 people died in Guinea,

00:03:20.067 --> 00:03:22.901
 Sierra Leone,
 Liberia and Nigeria.

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:24.968
 REPORTER: Has this
 meeting to discuss

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:26.267
 the Ebola outbreak.

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:27.534
 MALE REPORTER: This Ebola
 thing is not under control.

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:28.968
We're not being told the truth.

00:03:29.067 --> 00:03:30.868
 MAN: Most of those
 who get it will die

00:03:30.968 --> 00:03:32.234
 through uncontrolled--

00:03:32.334 --> 00:03:34.334
DR. KHAN: Without a doubt
people are afraid.

00:03:34.434 --> 00:03:37.167
If you look at Ebola,
there's no treatment,

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:39.567
and there's no vaccine
for the most part.

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:41.767
That's a scary situation.

00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:44.501
 NARRATOR: By late summer,
 the United States government

00:03:44.601 --> 00:03:47.334
 felt Americans infected
 with the hemorrhagic fever,

00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:50.467
 should be brought to this
 country for medical care.

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:53.033
 Emory University
 in Atlanta received

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.434
 the first Ebola patients
 ever treated in the US.

00:03:56.534 --> 00:03:59.133
 At the time, only three
 hospitals in America

00:03:59.234 --> 00:04:03.501
 had facilities able to safely
 contain and treat the disease.

00:04:03.601 --> 00:04:08.033
Emory, the National Institute of
Health in Washington DC

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:11.334
 and the Nebraska
 Biocontainment Unit.

00:04:11.434 --> 00:04:12.434
ROB McCARTNEY: Hey, good
afternoon everybody.

00:04:12.534 --> 00:04:14.934
We are following breaking
news of national import

00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:16.200
in Omaha at this hour.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.667
BRANDI PETERSEN: We are live
at the Nebraska Medical Center.

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:19.167
Doctors are holding
a news conference

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:22.100
to discuss an American
doctor with the Ebola virus

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.267
coming to the Nebraska
Medical Center.

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:25.801
DR. SMITH: I'll never forget I
was walking down the hallway

00:04:25.901 --> 00:04:28.868
with Angela Hewlett, the
Associate Medical Director,

00:04:28.968 --> 00:04:30.968
and my phone goes off.

00:04:31.067 --> 00:04:32.601
It said State Department.

00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:34.601
I thought, "Well, here we go."

00:04:34.701 --> 00:04:36.400
And they said, "We
like your unit.

00:04:36.501 --> 00:04:37.701
"In fact, we like it so
much that we're going

00:04:37.801 --> 00:04:39.334
"to send an Ebola
patient to you."

00:04:39.434 --> 00:04:41.334
DR. ANGELA HEWLETT:
We started saying, "Well,
what do we need to do now?"

00:04:41.434 --> 00:04:44.801
And it involved a very
quick array of phone calls

00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:46.968
and talking with the
Health Department

00:04:47.067 --> 00:04:49.467
and the rest of the
Biocontainment Unit
leadership team.

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.634
 NARRATOR: The
 Nebraska isolation unit

00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:55.701
 was a creation of the
 University of Nebraska.

00:04:55.801 --> 00:04:58.501
 The privately managed
 hospital, Nebraska Medicine,

00:04:58.601 --> 00:05:01.834
 and the state's Department
 of Health and Human Services.

00:05:01.934 --> 00:05:04.801
DR. SMITH: We say that for
activation, it's kind of like

00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:06.100
a safely deposit box.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200
You need two keys.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.501
The State Health Department
and the hospital.

00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:12.734
 NARRATOR: State
 health officials agreed.

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:16.267
 It was time to open the unit
 to accept its first patient.

00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:17.868
JENNIFER ROBERTS-JOHNSON:
It was a little bit surreal,

00:05:17.968 --> 00:05:19.767
more than a little
intimidating, I think.

00:05:19.868 --> 00:05:21.868
And it was definitely
invigorating in the sense

00:05:21.968 --> 00:05:24.934
that I think our team said,
"Okay, we're activating.

00:05:25.033 --> 00:05:26.167
"We're going to do this work.

00:05:26.267 --> 00:05:27.467
"We're going to work
through this problem."

00:05:27.567 --> 00:05:29.267
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:05:29.367 --> 00:05:31.167
DR. THOMAS SAFRANEK: And
we needed to do so in a way

00:05:31.267 --> 00:05:33.133
where the healthcare
providers themselves

00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:37.133
weren't jeopardized and
that was the real advantage

00:05:37.234 --> 00:05:39.767
that the University of Nebraska
Medical Center provided.

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.300
 NARRATOR: Patient
 one, Dr. Richard Sacra,

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.300
 a medical missionary
 based in Liberia.

00:05:46.067 --> 00:05:49.000
 He apparently contracted
 Ebola delivering a baby.

00:05:50.434 --> 00:05:52.834
 With the Ebola virus
 engulfing his body,

00:05:52.934 --> 00:05:57.100
 the US government arranged the
 airlift to Omaha, Nebraska.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.834
DR. SMITH: We didn't know
exactly when they would come,

00:05:59.934 --> 00:06:01.801
but I remember
getting another call

00:06:01.901 --> 00:06:03.701
late in the evening from
the State Department saying

00:06:03.801 --> 00:06:05.701
"Wheels up in Monrovia."

00:06:05.801 --> 00:06:06.801
 (jet taking off)

00:06:06.901 --> 00:06:10.634
 (dramatic instrumental music)

00:06:10.734 --> 00:06:12.033
DR. SMITH: That meant the
patient's in the air

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:14.501
and there's no turning back.

00:06:14.601 --> 00:06:16.267
DR. HEWLETT: There was
definitely a physical reaction.

00:06:16.367 --> 00:06:18.801
Yeah, there was a little
bit of fast heartbeat,

00:06:18.901 --> 00:06:20.467
a little bit of
all that going on.

00:06:20.567 --> 00:06:23.167
DR. SMITH:
I tingled from head to foot.

00:06:23.267 --> 00:06:26.834
It's almost something
that's hard to believe.

00:06:26.934 --> 00:06:28.901
We were ready for it, but
when it actually happened,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.100
you say, "Wow, this is an
amazing event, historic event."

00:06:34.767 --> 00:06:36.400
 NARRATOR: The
 biocontainment team included

00:06:36.501 --> 00:06:39.400
 two dozen doctors,
 10 lab workers,

00:06:39.501 --> 00:06:43.300
 six respiratory therapists,
 five patient care technicians,

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.100
 and 22 nurses.

00:06:46.033 --> 00:06:48.033
ANGELA VASA: I got the text,
and we actually have a system

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:50.367
that sends you a text
message that says

00:06:50.467 --> 00:06:53.033
"NBU activation,
this is not a drill."

00:06:53.133 --> 00:06:55.534
And so, I read it
and it read it again.

00:06:55.634 --> 00:06:58.367
BETSY FLOOD:
I was almost relieved the
first time I was going in

00:06:58.467 --> 00:07:00.234
because, you know,
you think about it.

00:07:00.334 --> 00:07:01.601
You think about it.

00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:02.968
You practice it
and you know what,

00:07:03.067 --> 00:07:04.801
and so, I was almost
like "Okay, thank God.

00:07:04.901 --> 00:07:07.033
"We're just going to
do this now," you know?

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:08.968
SHELLY SCHWEDHELM: We just
were like, "Let's go."

00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:12.400
So, we brought our team in
again, and said, "He's coming.

00:07:12.501 --> 00:07:15.200
"Probably be here in 48 hours."

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.601
I wanted today to maybe
have 20 minutes or so

00:07:17.701 --> 00:07:19.534
and answer any questions.

00:07:19.634 --> 00:07:23.300
I wanted to make sure we had
every detail taken care of

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.467
and they felt
confident and safe.

00:07:26.567 --> 00:07:29.501
I remember saying that
"we'd trained for 10 years

00:07:29.601 --> 00:07:33.634
"for this moment and these
were our fellow Americans.

00:07:33.734 --> 00:07:35.200
"And if we aren't
going to seize this,

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.367
"than really everything
we've done has been for naught."

00:07:39.467 --> 00:07:41.367
 (jet plane flying past)

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:42.868
DR. HEWLETT: When the plane
actually touched down,

00:07:42.968 --> 00:07:45.834
I was in the biocontainment
unit already with my team.

00:07:45.934 --> 00:07:47.934
DR. SMITH:
We were all in the unit,

00:07:48.033 --> 00:07:51.167
and we were watching
it on television.

00:07:51.267 --> 00:07:53.400
At that time, the
nurses were ready.

00:07:53.501 --> 00:07:55.868
We knew which people were
going to be in the first shift.

00:07:55.968 --> 00:07:57.934
The physicians were all there,

00:07:58.033 --> 00:08:00.133
and then we knew we
had about 30 minutes

00:08:00.234 --> 00:08:01.901
to get things ready.

00:08:03.434 --> 00:08:04.267
 FEMALE REPORTER:
 And breaking news now

00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:05.601
 at 6:19 on First News.

00:08:05.701 --> 00:08:08.667
 An American doctor
 with Ebola is in Omaha.

00:08:08.767 --> 00:08:10.100
 MALE REPORTER:
 This is a live look

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:11.968
 at the Nebraska Medical
 Center where Dr. Richard Sacra

00:08:12.067 --> 00:08:13.200
 will be treated.

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:14.567
 He landed at Bellevue's
 Offutt Air Force Base

00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:16.033
 in the past half hour.

00:08:16.133 --> 00:08:17.267
 NARRATOR: Plans for
 getting the patient

00:08:17.367 --> 00:08:19.767
 across town and safely
 inside the hospital

00:08:19.868 --> 00:08:24.734
 fell to John Lowe, the unit's
 infection control specialist.

00:08:24.834 --> 00:08:26.567
JOHN-MARTIN LOWE: It was an
incredibly unique experience,

00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:28.400
so it happened very
early in the morning.

00:08:28.501 --> 00:08:29.634
It was still dark out,

00:08:29.734 --> 00:08:31.601
and it had been
raining all night.

00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:33.067
 NARRATOR: There were
 no cameras on the ground

00:08:33.167 --> 00:08:36.801
 to record the transfer
 from jet to ambulance.

00:08:36.901 --> 00:08:39.834
LOWE: The plane arrived
shortly after we did

00:08:39.934 --> 00:08:41.200
at Offutt Air Force Base.

00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.033
It parked out on the tarmac

00:08:43.133 --> 00:08:46.167
and we had a military
security vehicle escort,

00:08:46.267 --> 00:08:48.534
the Omaha Fire Ambulance.

00:08:48.634 --> 00:08:50.767
My role and responsibility
is that if anything

00:08:50.868 --> 00:08:53.267
is done differently than
how it was anticipated,

00:08:53.367 --> 00:08:54.200
gonna stop it.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.467
So, I was watching
incredibly intently

00:08:57.567 --> 00:08:59.200
all of the different movements

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.400
of our personnel and the patient

00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:03.567
to make sure everything
was going as planned

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:05.100
and looking for anything
that I felt like

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:08.100
we would need to stop and
address before we went further.

00:09:09.234 --> 00:09:12.100
KATE BOULTER:
I was standing at the bottom
of the stairs looking up,

00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.901
and the patient came to
the door of the aircraft.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.267
And I just remember
thinking, "Why am I here?"

00:09:20.367 --> 00:09:23.501
You know, I did not have
to be the one doing this.

00:09:23.601 --> 00:09:25.701
As the patient came
down the stairs

00:09:25.801 --> 00:09:29.267
and we got him onto the
gurney, that's what be became.

00:09:29.367 --> 00:09:30.501
He became my patient.

00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:32.100
I'm a nurse.

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.234
I'm going to take care of him,

00:09:33.334 --> 00:09:35.567
and that's what it was.

00:09:35.667 --> 00:09:38.300
 (ambulance beeping)

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.667
 NARRATOR: The City of Omaha
 emergency medical technicians

00:09:40.767 --> 00:09:42.300
 knew the danger.

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.033
 The slightest contact
 with body fluids

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:46.601
 could be a fatal proposition.

00:09:46.701 --> 00:09:49.300
 For months, they drilled
 anticipating the transport

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.467
 of high-risk patients from
 one hospital to another.

00:09:53.567 --> 00:09:55.334
 (gurney legs going up)

00:09:55.434 --> 00:09:58.033
 Dr. Sacra's arrival from
 West Africa provided

00:09:58.133 --> 00:10:01.901
 an unexpected twist,
 delivery by jet.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.701
 In a matter of days,
 the fire department

00:10:03.801 --> 00:10:07.267
 drew up plans to get the
 patient safely off the plane.

00:10:07.367 --> 00:10:11.100
 (dramatic instrumental music)

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.100
 (air traffic conversation)

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.968
LOWE:
Having a patient flown

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:18.467
into the air force base

00:10:18.567 --> 00:10:21.100
was a little bit different
than what we had anticipated

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.801
from a hospital-to-hospital
transfer

00:10:22.901 --> 00:10:23.734
within the Omaha Metro.

00:10:25.334 --> 00:10:28.901
The motorcade was overseen
by Nebraska State Patrol.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.767
This was essentially
the same motorcade

00:10:30.868 --> 00:10:32.300
and same protocol that they used

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:34.067
when the President came to Omaha

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:37.767
to help move the President
through the community quickly.

00:10:37.868 --> 00:10:39.267
 MALE REPORTER: And we take
 a live look right now

00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:41.567
 at the transportation
 looks like from Bellevue.

00:10:41.667 --> 00:10:43.200
LOWE: If you're familiar
with the highway

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:44.868
that runs from Bellevue to Omaha

00:10:44.968 --> 00:10:46.634
at about 8:00 in the morning,

00:10:46.734 --> 00:10:49.300
it can get pretty congested.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.200
The quickest trip from
Offutt Air Force Base

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.667
to the medical
center I've ever had.

00:10:53.767 --> 00:10:55.167
 NARRATOR: Inside
 the ambulance,

00:10:55.267 --> 00:10:58.133
 Dr. Sacra remained in his
 protective suit on the gurney,

00:10:58.234 --> 00:10:59.767
 delirious from the drugs used

00:10:59.868 --> 00:11:02.601
 to calm him from the flight.

00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:03.968
BOULTER: I did see his eyes.

00:11:04.067 --> 00:11:05.467
I could see that, you know,

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:07.634
he was very thankful to be here.

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:10.701
We had a conversation where
I welcomed him to Nebraska

00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:13.167
and told him that we
were going to take

00:11:13.267 --> 00:11:15.734
the best care that
we could of him.

00:11:15.834 --> 00:11:17.701
 FEMALE REPORTER: We can
 see line of vehicles

00:11:17.801 --> 00:11:19.234
 coming down the street now.

00:11:19.334 --> 00:11:21.634
ROBERTS-JOHNSON:
There were a number of us
sort of on a conference call

00:11:21.734 --> 00:11:24.634
that morning watching
it unwind on TV,

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:27.767
and I think we were
basically saying to ourselves

00:11:27.868 --> 00:11:30.868
"Please let this go how
it was planned to go."

00:11:30.968 --> 00:11:32.734
DR. SAFRANEK: We think
they've done everything right,

00:11:32.834 --> 00:11:36.968
but it's trust but be
careful and monitor.

00:11:37.067 --> 00:11:38.501
And that was our
role in public health

00:11:38.601 --> 00:11:40.200
to make sure that those
healthcare workers

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.701
who go back home every night

00:11:42.801 --> 00:11:46.467
aren't at risk to the
broader community.

00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:49.033
LOWE: We didn't
see a great deal of press

00:11:49.133 --> 00:11:52.100
from our motorcade
until we got down here

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.567
to 42nd and Emily where
there was a whole line

00:11:55.667 --> 00:11:59.467
of cameras and press
recording the transport.

00:11:59.567 --> 00:12:00.801
So, that's when it really
started to sink in,

00:12:00.901 --> 00:12:03.234
that all eyes were
on this process.

00:12:03.334 --> 00:12:08.567
 (music and helicopter sounds)

00:12:08.667 --> 00:12:11.300
DR. HEWLETT: Everyone was kind
of quiet and doing their job.

00:12:13.667 --> 00:12:15.434
And the patient rolled in

00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:18.868
and went to the designated
room, and then the work began.

00:12:20.334 --> 00:12:21.467
 NARRATOR: Why here?

00:12:21.567 --> 00:12:23.734
 Why this hospital
 in Omaha, Nebraska?

00:12:23.834 --> 00:12:26.701
It was the largest
biocontainment unit in America.

00:12:26.801 --> 00:12:27.567
 How did it get here?

00:12:29.067 --> 00:12:31.434
 After the September 11
 attacks brought fears

00:12:31.534 --> 00:12:34.868
 of bioterrorism, America
 needed hospitals able

00:12:34.968 --> 00:12:37.267
 to cope with an
 outbreak of smallpox,

00:12:37.367 --> 00:12:39.434
 or who knows what.

00:12:39.534 --> 00:12:43.000
 Dr. Smith believed if UNMC
 got federal and state funds

00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:46.934
 for bioterrorism, the
 unit's mission could expand

00:12:47.033 --> 00:12:48.901
 to care for patients
 with a variety

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.567
 of highly contagious diseases.

00:12:51.667 --> 00:12:53.601
 (fan blowing)

00:12:53.701 --> 00:12:55.033
DR. PHIL SMITH: there you can
see the fan, this is the kind

00:12:55.133 --> 00:12:56.934
of air that blows inside the...

00:12:57.033 --> 00:12:58.167
Well they're all diseases with

00:12:58.267 --> 00:13:01.501
a very high mortality
rate, 50% to 90%.

00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:04.934
They're diseases
generally like Ebola,

00:13:05.033 --> 00:13:08.100
for which there's no vaccine
and there's no treatment,

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.467
so they're incurable.

00:13:09.567 --> 00:13:12.000
And thirdly, they're contagious.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.400
Those three factors
are the things

00:13:13.501 --> 00:13:16.334
that in general put the diseases
on the most wanted list.

00:13:17.367 --> 00:13:19.033
DR. ANGELA HEWLETT: The
biocontainment units has things

00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:20.133
that are a little bit different

00:13:20.234 --> 00:13:21.434
than a regular hospital room,

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:23.133
things like
engineering controls,

00:13:23.234 --> 00:13:25.701
special airflow and
things like that

00:13:25.801 --> 00:13:27.701
to try to keep infectious
diseases inside

00:13:27.801 --> 00:13:29.901
of the care facility as opposed

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.634
to letting them into
the outside world.

00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:32.901
 (door closing)

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.634
 (beeping)

00:13:34.734 --> 00:13:38.300
DR. SMITH: We want the air to
be sucked in, pull the germs in

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.467
and not let them get out
into the community.

00:13:41.567 --> 00:13:42.901
It senses that there's a leak--

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.868
 NARRATOR: No one could
 predict what disease

00:13:44.968 --> 00:13:46.434
 might present itself.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.634
 Some spread by way
 of bodily fluids.

00:13:48.734 --> 00:13:51.968
 Others transmit by air.

00:13:52.067 --> 00:13:53.934
 There's no telling what
 equipment might be needed

00:13:54.033 --> 00:13:55.834
 in any of the five rooms.

00:13:55.934 --> 00:13:58.501
 It's bare bones by design.

00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:00.267
BOULTER: What makes it
different when we have a patient

00:14:00.367 --> 00:14:03.167
and we go in, is that
everybody knows their roles.

00:14:03.267 --> 00:14:05.534
NURSE: So, all of that
happens in one fell swoop.

00:14:05.634 --> 00:14:07.267
 NARRATOR: The high-risk
 nature of the work

00:14:07.367 --> 00:14:09.767
 demanded special
 skills and a staff

00:14:09.868 --> 00:14:11.934
with a particular frame of mind.

00:14:12.033 --> 00:14:14.033
DR. HEWLETT:
Biocontainment units
also have specialized staff

00:14:14.133 --> 00:14:16.868
so that have trained teams
of nurses and physicians

00:14:16.968 --> 00:14:19.601
who do a lot of
drills and training

00:14:19.701 --> 00:14:21.734
in order to take
care of the patients

00:14:21.834 --> 00:14:23.634
with highly infectious diseases.

00:14:23.734 --> 00:14:25.868
We're all volunteer
staff which is different

00:14:25.968 --> 00:14:27.133
than regular hospital.

00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:28.601
You obviously
volunteer for your job

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.067
if you're applying for a job.

00:14:30.167 --> 00:14:32.467
But, in our situation,
just because you work here

00:14:32.567 --> 00:14:34.334
at UNMC doesn't necessarily
mean that you'll be part

00:14:34.434 --> 00:14:36.167
of our biocontainment unit team.

00:14:36.267 --> 00:14:38.200
You have to actually want
to be part of the team.

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.200
DR. SMITH: By the end of that
nine years,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.734
we had the hardcore
biocontainment geeks,

00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:45.167
if you want to say it that way,

00:14:45.267 --> 00:14:48.434
 (music)

00:14:48.534 --> 00:14:50.734
and that's what
helped us be ready.

00:14:50.834 --> 00:14:53.801
 NARRATOR: The rooms,
 the staff, the planning,

00:14:53.901 --> 00:14:55.400
 that was all in place.

00:14:55.501 --> 00:14:59.400
Year after year, the only thing
lacking were the patients.

00:14:59.501 --> 00:15:00.934
DR. SMITH: 'Cause I
know there were times

00:15:01.033 --> 00:15:03.167
when the hospital was
full, we had to divert

00:15:03.267 --> 00:15:04.534
people to other hospitals.

00:15:04.634 --> 00:15:05.801
They were saying, "Why
are we just letting

00:15:05.901 --> 00:15:08.033
"this 10-bed unit sit there?"

00:15:08.133 --> 00:15:12.501
DR. DAN JOHNSON: Dr. Smith put
his foot down about 100 times

00:15:12.601 --> 00:15:15.467
saying "We need
to keep this unit.

00:15:15.567 --> 00:15:18.534
"We are going to
need it, trust me."

00:15:18.634 --> 00:15:21.334
DR. SMITH: To their credit,
they had the long vision

00:15:21.434 --> 00:15:23.334
and they could see the
global trends and

00:15:23.434 --> 00:15:24.801
the fact that
this is something

00:15:24.901 --> 00:15:26.767
that could be very
useful if there were

00:15:26.868 --> 00:15:28.901
an outbreak down the line.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.934
 NARRATOR: Down
 the line was now.

00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:33.434
The federal government requested
the Nebraska Medical Center

00:15:33.534 --> 00:15:34.801
 activate the unit.

00:15:34.901 --> 00:15:39.067
 (gentle piano music)

00:15:39.167 --> 00:15:41.200
DR. JOHNSON: I remember
watching our first patient wheel

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.567
into the unit, and I
thought, "I am now engaging

00:15:44.667 --> 00:15:47.734
"in the treatment of
someone who has a disease

00:15:47.834 --> 00:15:50.467
"that is almost
sure to kill him."

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:52.067
 NARRATOR: Dr. Daniel
 Johnson spent most

00:15:52.167 --> 00:15:55.667
 of his time in the UNMC
 intensive care unit.

00:15:55.767 --> 00:15:57.334
 He didn't have the
 years of training

00:15:57.434 --> 00:15:59.300
 in biocontainment procedures.

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:02.133
 In fact, he'd been
 recruited only days earlier

00:16:02.234 --> 00:16:04.801
 when it was clear his
 skillset would benefit

00:16:04.901 --> 00:16:06.234
 the treatment of Rick Sacra.

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:09.067
DR. JOHNSON: I was getting
put into a suit

00:16:09.167 --> 00:16:13.367
that I had only ever seen
either on the news or in movies.

00:16:13.467 --> 00:16:17.467
In the moments leading up
to going into the room,

00:16:17.567 --> 00:16:21.067
I did have a little wave
of fear and anxiety.

00:16:21.167 --> 00:16:23.300
DR. HEWLETT: I helped
him get his gear on

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.934
and we had a little talk
right before he walked

00:16:25.033 --> 00:16:26.801
into the biocontainment unit.

00:16:26.901 --> 00:16:29.734
I just said, "Go in there
and do what you do every day.

00:16:29.834 --> 00:16:31.534
"Just be extra careful."

00:16:31.634 --> 00:16:34.367
 NARRATOR: For this patient,
 inserting a standard IV

00:16:34.467 --> 00:16:35.701
 was impossible.

00:16:35.801 --> 00:16:38.634
 Sacra arrived so
 dehydrated, the medical team

00:16:38.734 --> 00:16:41.434
feared his veins would collapse.

00:16:41.534 --> 00:16:43.234
DR. HEWLETT: This
is actually a large catheter

00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:46.434
that goes into the neck, into
one of the veins in the neck,

00:16:46.534 --> 00:16:48.467
and the reason we have to do is

00:16:48.567 --> 00:16:49.968
because we wanted to be able

00:16:50.067 --> 00:16:53.234
to deliver those medications
quickly and efficiently.

00:16:53.334 --> 00:16:55.734
 NARRATOR: This would
 be Dr. Sacra's lifeline.

00:16:55.834 --> 00:17:00.467
 For Dr. Johnson, a routine
 procedure became perilous.

00:17:00.567 --> 00:17:03.167
 Damaging the jugular vein
 had deadly consequences

00:17:03.267 --> 00:17:04.367
 for everyone.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:08.200
 (heavy breathing)

00:17:08.300 --> 00:17:10.167
DR. JOHNSON: It was the walk
down the hallway , (chuckles)

00:17:10.267 --> 00:17:12.734
it was actually more
nerve racking than anything
else.

00:17:12.834 --> 00:17:15.734
The fight or flight
response is off the charts.

00:17:15.834 --> 00:17:17.334
As soon as I walked in the room

00:17:17.434 --> 00:17:21.601
and saw a human being there
who needed my help, I was fine.

00:17:21.701 --> 00:17:23.067
DR. SMITH: When
someone was drawing blood,

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:25.501
we were all looking in
on our video system.

00:17:25.601 --> 00:17:29.267
Everybody would just stop and
keep their fingers crossed.

00:17:29.367 --> 00:17:32.434
DR. HEWLETT: Holding my breath,
wringing my hands and my gloves,

00:17:32.534 --> 00:17:33.801
doing everything like that.

00:17:33.901 --> 00:17:35.968
But I'll tell you, it
went off very well.

00:17:36.067 --> 00:17:39.601
DR. JOHNSON: One of the nurses
and I both had inches of sweat.

00:17:39.701 --> 00:17:42.267
It was up above our
ankle within our suit

00:17:42.367 --> 00:17:44.701
when we walked out of the
room for the first procedure.

00:17:44.801 --> 00:17:46.300
There's actually
a photograph of me

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.801
right after I've
taken my suit off,

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:52.968
and I am drenched and I've
just got two thumbs up

00:17:53.067 --> 00:17:54.300
with a huge smile on my face.

00:17:55.067 --> 00:17:56.534
DR. HEWLETT: It
was a nice moment.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.801
BETSY FLOOD: Dr. Smith and
Shelly told us

00:17:59.901 --> 00:18:02.200
that everything
was going to good.

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.334
We had prepared for this.

00:18:03.434 --> 00:18:04.701
We knew what we were doing,

00:18:04.801 --> 00:18:06.934
and they said this kind of calm

00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:09.200
that it's kind of like,
"Well, okay, they say

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.200
"it's all going to be okay.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:11.267
"I'll be good.

00:18:11.367 --> 00:18:12.100
"We know what we're doing.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:12.934
"We're smart.

00:18:13.033 --> 00:18:14.100
"We've practiced.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:14.868
"Let's go."
MORGAN SHRADER:
We bought into it.

00:18:14.968 --> 00:18:16.000
FLOOD: Right, we bought into it.

00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:16.801
 (laughing)

00:18:18.868 --> 00:18:20.467
 NARRATOR: Staying safe
 begins with the layout

00:18:20.567 --> 00:18:22.267
 of the unit itself.

00:18:22.367 --> 00:18:25.267
 With five specialized
 rooms, up to 10 patients

00:18:25.367 --> 00:18:27.334
 can be treated at once.

00:18:27.434 --> 00:18:30.701
 Caring for this single
 case of Ebola meant rooms

00:18:30.801 --> 00:18:34.067
 were available to keep
 medical supplies close at hand

00:18:34.167 --> 00:18:36.734
 and provide space
 for biohazard waste

00:18:36.834 --> 00:18:39.167
 waiting to be sterilized.

00:18:39.267 --> 00:18:40.934
 An onsite lab was added later.

00:18:42.267 --> 00:18:43.634
BOULTER: The unit's
kind of an L-shape.

00:18:43.734 --> 00:18:44.834
You've got your nurses station

00:18:44.934 --> 00:18:47.067
and then it goes
up a long corridor.

00:18:47.167 --> 00:18:49.701
We have a line, and
that line marked

00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:52.701
the difference between
clean and warm.

00:18:52.801 --> 00:18:55.133
The hot zones, of course,
were the patient rooms.

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:56.667
ANGELA VASA: When we say the hot
zone is the patient room,

00:18:56.767 --> 00:18:59.100
that's where the highest
burden of viral load

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.234
is most likely to be present.

00:19:01.334 --> 00:19:02.667
The warm zone is
where you're going

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.334
to take off your equipment,
and then the cold zone

00:19:05.434 --> 00:19:07.501
is where you would say there's
the least likely chance

00:19:07.601 --> 00:19:10.133
that you're going to be
exposed to the virus.

00:19:10.234 --> 00:19:12.400
There are behaviors that are
restricted to every zone,

00:19:12.501 --> 00:19:14.267
and that's to help
decrease the risk

00:19:14.367 --> 00:19:15.767
of cross-contamination.

00:19:16.634 --> 00:19:19.701
 NARRATOR: The safe operation
 of the biocontainment unit

00:19:19.801 --> 00:19:22.534
 relies on a set of protocols.

00:19:22.634 --> 00:19:25.667
 Standard operating procedures
 guiding every doctor,

00:19:25.767 --> 00:19:27.968
 nurse, and technician.

00:19:28.067 --> 00:19:30.300
NURSE: Tuck inner
cape into suit.

00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.467
 NARRATOR: Nurses rotate
 on four-hour shifts,

00:19:32.567 --> 00:19:34.501
 always with a backup.

00:19:34.601 --> 00:19:36.300
SHELLY SCHWEDHELM: When our
people went into the room

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.000
and we always wanted
a second person

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.501
in personal protective equipment

00:19:40.601 --> 00:19:42.968
that if the caregivers in
the room needed something,

00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:47.133
that person could quickly
step in and be ready to go.

00:19:47.234 --> 00:19:49.467
 (Putting on hazmat
 suite and gloves)

00:19:49.567 --> 00:19:51.601
 (machine whirring and beeping)

00:19:51.701 --> 00:19:55.767
KATE BOULTER: So, PPE stands for
personal protective equipment,

00:19:55.868 --> 00:20:00.534
 (putting on protective gear)

00:20:00.634 --> 00:20:02.767
and that's everything
from gloves, masks,

00:20:02.868 --> 00:20:07.567
respirators, gowns, hoods,
visors, all of those things.

00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:09.000
And what that's going
to do is put a barrier

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.601
between you and the infection.

00:20:13.133 --> 00:20:14.601
When we opened and
we were looking

00:20:14.701 --> 00:20:17.667
at what policies were
there for one thing,

00:20:17.767 --> 00:20:21.100
putting on and taking off
PPE, there wasn't any.

00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:25.167
And we had to develop that
right from the beginning.

00:20:25.267 --> 00:20:27.534
 NARRATOR: In Africa,
 healthcare workers responding

00:20:27.634 --> 00:20:30.701
 to the Ebola crisis
 died at alarming rates,

00:20:30.801 --> 00:20:32.701
 in part because
 doctors and nurses

00:20:32.801 --> 00:20:35.601
removed gloves and gowns in ways

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:38.267
 that put them in contact
 with the very virus

00:20:38.367 --> 00:20:40.667
 killing their patients.

00:20:40.767 --> 00:20:43.834
BOULTER: We decided we needed
to develop strict policies,

00:20:43.934 --> 00:20:47.601
protocols on how to
put on the PPE safely,

00:20:47.701 --> 00:20:49.467
meaning you were going
to be completely covered.

00:20:49.567 --> 00:20:51.367
And then, more
importantly, you were going

00:20:51.467 --> 00:20:55.033
to get it off in a way that you
didn't contaminate yourself.

00:20:55.133 --> 00:20:56.000
VASA: You want to make sure

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.634
that you have everything covered

00:20:57.734 --> 00:21:00.834
that could transmit any
kind of Ebola virus to you,

00:21:00.934 --> 00:21:03.634
any mucous membranes,
eyes, nose, mouth,

00:21:03.734 --> 00:21:05.968
lungs 'cause we breathe in.

00:21:07.667 --> 00:21:10.467
 NARRATOR: Donning is the
 word for putting on the gear.

00:21:10.567 --> 00:21:13.934
 Taking off the gear
 is known as doffing.

00:21:14.033 --> 00:21:15.400
NURSE: So, you're going
to kind of turn

00:21:15.501 --> 00:21:16.634
to make is easier for
you, like do one shoulder

00:21:16.734 --> 00:21:19.667
turn back, do another
shoulder, turn back.

00:21:19.767 --> 00:21:22.334
SCHWEDHELM: There's a very
significant sequence

00:21:22.434 --> 00:21:25.267
to taking it off so
that you make sure

00:21:25.367 --> 00:21:29.801
that you go from
most contaminated to
least contaminated.

00:21:29.901 --> 00:21:31.667
DR. HEWLETT: You come out of a
room and you've just been seeing

00:21:31.767 --> 00:21:33.434
a patient with Ebola,
the last thing you want

00:21:33.534 --> 00:21:34.901
to think about is did I remember

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.968
to put that step
in the right order.

00:21:37.067 --> 00:21:38.501
And so, we take that element out

00:21:38.601 --> 00:21:40.367
and we have a person who's
been outside the room

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:42.801
who actually directs
every move you make.

00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:44.400
VASA: That's the most
vulnerable point

00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:46.934
in the entire care continuum.

00:21:48.767 --> 00:21:50.634
 NARRATOR: In simulations,
 newcomers to the team

00:21:50.734 --> 00:21:53.801
 learn the sequences
 designed to keep them safe.

00:21:53.901 --> 00:21:57.834
 Disposable boots come off
 first to avoid tracking.

00:21:57.934 --> 00:22:00.834
 Feet shift to different
 zones on a mat

00:22:00.934 --> 00:22:02.901
 to avoid recontamination.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.934
 Helpers carefully peel away
 hoods to avoid spatter.

00:22:07.033 --> 00:22:08.567
 The three pairs
 of gloves come off

00:22:08.667 --> 00:22:10.467
 in a specific sequence.

00:22:10.567 --> 00:22:13.200
 (removing tape and gloves)

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:14.467
NURSE: That will happen.

00:22:14.567 --> 00:22:15.968
That will happen
in real life too,

00:22:16.067 --> 00:22:17.767
so what you want to
do is take a minute,

00:22:17.868 --> 00:22:20.334
pause, reset,
troubleshoot through it.

00:22:20.434 --> 00:22:22.901
DR. SMITH: We taught people
stop, assess the risk,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.968
get help, take your time.

00:22:25.067 --> 00:22:28.901
Nothing is worth
putting yourself in
increased jeopardy for.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.133
 NARRATOR: Comfort with
 the safety rituals allowed

00:22:31.234 --> 00:22:34.734
 the medical team to focus
 on Dr. Sacra's recovery.

00:22:34.834 --> 00:22:37.133
DR. SMITH: Well, he was
ill and we knew he was very ill

00:22:37.234 --> 00:22:39.868
between the fact that he
was somewhat delirious,

00:22:39.968 --> 00:22:42.167
although his vital
signs were stable.

00:22:42.267 --> 00:22:44.467
And after the physical
exam, it was obvious he was

00:22:44.567 --> 00:22:48.133
not at death's door,
but he was quite sick.

00:22:48.234 --> 00:22:50.367
And then, we drew
laboratory work,

00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:53.200
and his laboratory work
was way out of whack.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:54.767
 NARRATOR: Out of
 whack, in this case,

00:22:54.868 --> 00:22:57.400
 meant Dr. Sacra's inadequate
 electrolyte levels

00:22:57.501 --> 00:23:00.834
 caused the convulsions,
 nausea and diarrhea

00:23:00.934 --> 00:23:02.667
 racking his body.

00:23:02.767 --> 00:23:04.400
 Dr. Smith explained
 to reporters,

00:23:04.501 --> 00:23:08.100
 even if a cure was elusive,
 routine medicine could cope

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:09.567
 with the symptoms.

00:23:09.667 --> 00:23:11.434
DR. SMITH: There is a feeling
amongst the clinicians

00:23:11.534 --> 00:23:13.367
that treat these
patients that if you

00:23:13.467 --> 00:23:15.400
can get fluids into them early

00:23:15.501 --> 00:23:17.767
and balance their electrolytes,

00:23:17.868 --> 00:23:19.234
you can prevent some
of the complications.

00:23:19.334 --> 00:23:21.434
But, even that's
just a supposition,

00:23:21.534 --> 00:23:23.934
but that makes a lot of sense.

00:23:24.033 --> 00:23:26.167
 NARRATOR: Smith consulted
 with doctors around the world

00:23:26.267 --> 00:23:28.033
 and found reason
 to be encouraged.

00:23:28.133 --> 00:23:31.300
 Reducing the fever and
 dehydration allowed

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.634
 a body to heal and
 fight the virus.

00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:36.701
 Ebola need not be
 a death sentence.

00:23:36.801 --> 00:23:39.100
MORGAN SHRADER: This is just
manageable, flu-like symptoms.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:41.501
We can do this.

00:23:41.601 --> 00:23:43.567
And so, within the
first 12-hour shift

00:23:43.667 --> 00:23:46.901
or 14-hour shift, we had
overcome a lot of challenges

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.200
that I think addressed
right away and moved on.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:51.334
KATE BOULTER: It was new
territory everywhere really

00:23:51.434 --> 00:23:52.868
because you know, we
had learned lessons

00:23:52.968 --> 00:23:56.100
so were looking at what could
we learn from past events.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.167
 NARRATOR: Two American
 medical missionaries,

00:23:58.267 --> 00:24:01.400
 stricken with Ebola, had
 been airlifted out of Africa

00:24:01.501 --> 00:24:03.567
 to Emory University.

00:24:03.667 --> 00:24:06.133
 The hospital had its
 own isolation ward

00:24:06.234 --> 00:24:09.567
where highly infectious diseases
could be safely treated.

00:24:09.667 --> 00:24:11.434
 Both were cured.

00:24:11.534 --> 00:24:13.667
 (people applauding)

00:24:13.767 --> 00:24:16.801
DR. KENT BRANTLY:
Today is a miraculous day.

00:24:16.901 --> 00:24:21.234
I'm thrilled to be
alive, to be well.

00:24:21.334 --> 00:24:23.000
 NARRATOR: One survivor,
 Dr. Kent Brantly,

00:24:23.100 --> 00:24:24.601
 was a friend of Sacra's.

00:24:24.701 --> 00:24:27.834
 He donated 800 CC's
 of his own plasma

00:24:27.934 --> 00:24:30.100
 because research
 showed antibodies

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:33.400
 in the blood of people
 recovering from some diseases

00:24:33.501 --> 00:24:36.000
 can help fight off viruses.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:39.534
DR. SMITH: The convalescent
plasma, it was taking blood

00:24:39.634 --> 00:24:41.367
from patients recovered
and has antibodies

00:24:41.467 --> 00:24:43.567
is a very safe
treatment modality,

00:24:43.667 --> 00:24:46.501
so we felt very confident
giving it to Dr. Sacra.

00:24:47.934 --> 00:24:50.501
 NARRATOR: Approval for
 testing experimental drugs

00:24:50.601 --> 00:24:52.567
 on humans can take years.

00:24:52.667 --> 00:24:54.901
 For Ebola, the medical
 team in Nebraska

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.400
 got fast-track emergency
 clearance from the government.

00:24:58.501 --> 00:25:00.667
 Ultimately, it
 wasn't clear if any

00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:03.167
 of the drugs helped
 contain the virus

00:25:03.267 --> 00:25:04.667
 inside Dr. Sacra.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.133
DR. ALI KHAN: We now know that
without sophisticated drugs,

00:25:10.234 --> 00:25:12.434
we can take down the
number of people who die

00:25:12.534 --> 00:25:15.667
from eight in 10 to
maybe four in 10,

00:25:15.767 --> 00:25:18.267
or something like that
just with good management

00:25:18.367 --> 00:25:19.968
of the fluids you give them,

00:25:20.067 --> 00:25:22.501
the minerals you put
back into their body.

00:25:22.601 --> 00:25:24.601
So, that's been a great message.

00:25:24.701 --> 00:25:26.300
 (gentle instrumental music)

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.100
 NARRATOR: In biocontainment,
 the patient's room

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:31.100
 becomes a tiny
 self-enclosed world.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.801
 Visitors, including Rick
 Sacra's wife Debbie,

00:25:33.901 --> 00:25:36.200
 could only visit by
 way of a video feed

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:38.267
 at the nurses station.

00:25:38.367 --> 00:25:40.334
 The staff found ways
 to make small talk

00:25:40.434 --> 00:25:43.133
 through plastic shields.

00:25:43.234 --> 00:25:44.567
ANGELA VASA: You know,
initially I think it's hard

00:25:44.667 --> 00:25:46.901
because I attribute a
lot of my interaction

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.601
with patients with touch.

00:25:48.701 --> 00:25:52.133
And you don't have that
human touch in this case.

00:25:52.234 --> 00:25:53.567
But, I don't know
if it was because

00:25:53.667 --> 00:25:55.367
of the situation
that we were in,

00:25:55.467 --> 00:25:59.267
you got very close
to these patients.

00:25:59.367 --> 00:26:01.234
BETSY FLOOD: We are their
human interaction,

00:26:01.334 --> 00:26:02.868
and so we spend a
lot of time doing,

00:26:02.968 --> 00:26:05.968
you know, therapeutic
communication.

00:26:07.667 --> 00:26:10.868
DR. JOHNSON: I think when he
was eating normally,

00:26:10.968 --> 00:26:13.367
and when he started
to be bored (chuckles)

00:26:13.467 --> 00:26:15.067
of being in the
biocontainment unit,

00:26:15.167 --> 00:26:17.567
there was a sense of relief.

00:26:17.667 --> 00:26:19.267
DR. HEWLETT: Because so much was
unknown about this disease,

00:26:19.367 --> 00:26:20.667
when we started to see

00:26:20.767 --> 00:26:21.868
even those little
increments of improvement,

00:26:21.968 --> 00:26:23.634
we got very excited.

00:26:23.734 --> 00:26:25.634
 NARRATOR: The Centers
 for Disease Control required

00:26:25.734 --> 00:26:29.067
 two separate blood tests
 verifying virus loads

00:26:29.167 --> 00:26:31.501
low enough to ensure no one else

00:26:31.601 --> 00:26:33.901
 would contract the fever.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.434
DR. HEWLETT: We were waiting
on the lab work,

00:26:35.534 --> 00:26:38.434
and when we got word that the
viral loads were negative,

00:26:38.534 --> 00:26:41.534
when that happened,
there was a lot of joy,

00:26:41.634 --> 00:26:42.767
a lot of excitement.

00:26:42.868 --> 00:26:43.968
I'm smiling just
thinking about it.

00:26:44.067 --> 00:26:45.200
I was thinking about
back to that day

00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:46.734
because he was waiting.

00:26:46.834 --> 00:26:48.467
You know, Dr. Sacra,
he's a physician.

00:26:48.567 --> 00:26:49.901
He knew what was
going on with him.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:50.767
He was feeling better.

00:26:50.868 --> 00:26:52.000
He was ready.

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:52.934
He was ready to
get out of there.

00:26:53.033 --> 00:26:53.601
He was ready to see his family.

00:26:54.534 --> 00:27:01.634
 (gentle instrumental music)

00:27:01.734 --> 00:27:03.634
 NARRATOR: 25 days
 after tests confirmed

00:27:03.734 --> 00:27:07.801
 he had the disease, Rick and
 Debbie Sacra were reunited.

00:27:07.901 --> 00:27:10.033
 (gentle instrumental music)

00:27:10.133 --> 00:27:15.300
(people cheering and applauding)

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:20.467
DR. RICK SACRA: God has used
you to restore my life to me.

00:27:22.167 --> 00:27:24.701
I am so grateful.

00:27:26.634 --> 00:27:29.300
I would like to request
a continued outpouring

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.367
of prayer and practical
help for the people

00:27:32.467 --> 00:27:33.934
of West Africa.

00:27:34.033 --> 00:27:37.434
Though my crisis has reached
a successful end here,

00:27:37.534 --> 00:27:40.267
unfortunately the
Ebola crisis continues

00:27:40.367 --> 00:27:42.300
to spin out of control.

00:27:43.767 --> 00:27:45.200
 NARRATOR: The
 lessons learned inside

00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.200
 the Nebraska Biocontainment
 Unit would be tested again.

00:27:52.434 --> 00:27:56.334
 A disease anywhere can
 be a disease everywhere.

00:27:56.434 --> 00:27:59.167
 As international air
 travel becomes common,

00:27:59.267 --> 00:28:02.167
 emergency room crews
 anywhere in America

00:28:02.267 --> 00:28:06.400
 could encounter exotic,
 highly-infectious diseases.

00:28:07.567 --> 00:28:09.667
DR. HEWLETT: Before 2014, a
lot of facilities

00:28:09.767 --> 00:28:12.501
just didn't have
these things in place.

00:28:12.601 --> 00:28:14.234
They just weren't
ready to take care

00:28:14.334 --> 00:28:15.701
of these kind of patients.

00:28:15.801 --> 00:28:18.234
SCHWEDHELM: I was getting a
lot of emails from people out

00:28:18.334 --> 00:28:21.000
in the world and the
community across the nation

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:23.367
asking, "What's your
protocol for this?

00:28:23.467 --> 00:28:24.868
"How do we do this?"

00:28:24.968 --> 00:28:27.234
 BILL KELLY: How many times
 were you asked "Is it safe

00:28:27.334 --> 00:28:28.067
 "for the rest of us?"

00:28:28.968 --> 00:28:30.634
SCHWEDHELM: Too many to count.

00:28:32.167 --> 00:28:34.367
REPORTER:
How confident do you feel?

00:28:34.467 --> 00:28:36.200
SHELLY SCHWEDHELM: I feel very
confident in our unit,

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.667
and in our team and our staff.

00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:40.367
I think there was
tremendous fear

00:28:40.467 --> 00:28:43.100
that somebody was going
to show up in their place

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.534
and they really didn't
have the understanding

00:28:45.634 --> 00:28:48.267
or knowledge to know what to do.

00:28:48.367 --> 00:28:50.400
 NARRATOR: Well-founded
 fears, as it turned out.

00:28:50.501 --> 00:28:52.334
REPORTER: The first person to
have been diagnosed

00:28:52.434 --> 00:28:54.734
with Ebola in the
United States has died

00:28:54.834 --> 00:28:56.467
in a Texas hospital.

00:28:56.567 --> 00:28:59.667
 NARRATOR: Thomas Eric Duncan,
 a Liberian visiting Dallas

00:28:59.767 --> 00:29:02.534
 was sent home from a
 hospital emergency room

00:29:02.634 --> 00:29:04.634
 after complaining
 of a high fever.

00:29:04.734 --> 00:29:07.667
 His travel history should
 have been a red flag.

00:29:07.767 --> 00:29:09.334
REPORTER: Duncan
carried the deadly virus

00:29:09.434 --> 00:29:11.501
from his home in
Liberia, but did not show

00:29:11.601 --> 00:29:14.834
any symptoms when he arrived
in the US on September 20th.

00:29:14.934 --> 00:29:16.701
 NARRATOR: He returned
 to the same hospital

00:29:16.801 --> 00:29:18.801
 presenting all the
 symptoms of Ebola

00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:21.100
 and died within days.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.334
REPORTER: There was already
a high level of anxiety

00:29:23.434 --> 00:29:25.901
among many Americans,
and the death in Texas

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.567
only fans the Ebola fears.

00:29:28.667 --> 00:29:30.000
 NARRATOR: Two nurses
 on his treatment team

00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:31.467
 contracted the virus.

00:29:31.567 --> 00:29:32.734
 Both survived.

00:29:34.133 --> 00:29:37.000
KATE BOULTER:
A lot changed as well
after what happened in Texas

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.467
when the nurses got sick.

00:29:39.567 --> 00:29:42.934
Then there was a
lot more interest.

00:29:43.033 --> 00:29:45.334
REPORTER: But, US health
workers aren't satisfied.

00:29:45.434 --> 00:29:48.801
They say the government
needs to do more.

00:29:48.901 --> 00:29:50.367
HEALTH CARE WORKER: We've
been told a lot of things

00:29:50.467 --> 00:29:51.801
that have been wrong.

00:29:51.901 --> 00:29:53.167
We've been lied to.

00:29:53.267 --> 00:29:55.901
BETSY FLOOD: And I remember
when that poor Dallas nurse

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.167
came down with Ebola, you know,

00:29:58.267 --> 00:30:00.400
that brought up a lot
of interesting feelings.

00:30:00.501 --> 00:30:03.734
This poor woman didn't have
the resources that we did.

00:30:03.834 --> 00:30:07.167
 (sirens blaring)

00:30:07.267 --> 00:30:09.734
NARRATOR: Just as the
unsettling news broke in Dallas,

00:30:09.834 --> 00:30:11.534
 the US State
 Department requested

00:30:11.634 --> 00:30:13.501
 the Nebraska Medical
 Center prepare

00:30:13.601 --> 00:30:17.501
 for a second American
 infected with Ebola.

00:30:17.601 --> 00:30:21.601
 Barely two weeks had passed
 since Dr. Sacra's release.

00:30:21.701 --> 00:30:23.868
SPOKESMAN: Our patient arrived
in his room a few hours ago

00:30:23.968 --> 00:30:26.434
directly from West
Africa and is now--

00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:29.133
 NARRATOR: Photographer
 Ashoka Mukpo fell ill

00:30:29.234 --> 00:30:31.100
 in Liberia while on assignment

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.868
 covering the Ebola
 outbreak for NBC News.

00:30:34.968 --> 00:30:37.334
DIANE MUKPO: He's enormously
relieved to be here.

00:30:37.434 --> 00:30:40.067
Of course, it's still
quite frightening.

00:30:40.167 --> 00:30:42.367
 NARRATOR: The biocontainment
 unit assumed all along

00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:44.767
there would be more Ebola cases.

00:30:44.868 --> 00:30:47.734
 In the days before
 admitting this new patient,

00:30:47.834 --> 00:30:50.067
 they continued to
 review procedures

00:30:50.167 --> 00:30:53.901
 and refine the protocols from
 changes in protective gear

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.934
 to how to unclog a toilet
 that becomes a biohazard.

00:30:58.033 --> 00:30:59.901
SCHWEDHELM: This is really
typical of this team.

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:02.200
I can't tell you how
many times we've really

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:04.634
made small adjustments
in our how to get

00:31:04.734 --> 00:31:08.801
a specimen safely out of
the room and to the lab.

00:31:09.968 --> 00:31:11.267
 NARRATOR: A small
 change was a big deal

00:31:11.367 --> 00:31:14.167
 when it came to getting
 lab results faster.

00:31:14.267 --> 00:31:16.334
 When drawn from
 an Ebola patient,

00:31:16.434 --> 00:31:20.501
 blood instantly becomes
 a high-level biohazard.

00:31:20.601 --> 00:31:21.901
The State of Nebraska maintains

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.100
 a high security
 testing laboratory

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:27.100
 on the campus of
 the medical center.

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.601
 (beeping and door opening)

00:31:29.701 --> 00:31:31.901
BOULTER: Took at least 40
minutes between drawing the lab

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.167
and getting it there
to begin the analysis.

00:31:36.267 --> 00:31:38.834
We changed that
process very quickly.

00:31:38.934 --> 00:31:40.667
 NARRATOR: By the time
 the second patient arrived,

00:31:40.767 --> 00:31:43.467
 the med center had arranged
 for the biocontainment unit

00:31:43.567 --> 00:31:47.100
 to set up a temporary lab
 in an unused patient room.

00:31:48.567 --> 00:31:49.701
DR. PETER IWEN:
Look at the news that came out

00:31:49.801 --> 00:31:51.467
with the nurses in Dallas.

00:31:51.567 --> 00:31:54.467
I mean, we really had
no room for error,

00:31:54.567 --> 00:31:57.934
and that was a caution
that we were taking.

00:31:58.033 --> 00:32:00.234
 NARRATOR: Lab Director Pete
 Iwen found little precedence

00:32:00.334 --> 00:32:02.868
 or guidance from the
 Centers for Disease Control

00:32:02.968 --> 00:32:04.801
 for safe-handling
 of the samples.

00:32:05.767 --> 00:32:09.400
DR. IWEN:
They, quite frankly, didn't
have it all in writing either.

00:32:09.501 --> 00:32:11.033
So, it was kind of like, okay,

00:32:11.133 --> 00:32:14.133
I would call an emergency
operation center

00:32:14.234 --> 00:32:15.634
and say, "I need guidance on how

00:32:15.734 --> 00:32:18.734
"to do this particular sample
or how to run this sample."

00:32:18.834 --> 00:32:21.367
Process it, you know, in
the laboratory safely.

00:32:21.467 --> 00:32:24.200
And quite frankly,
what I got response was

00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:25.667
"We'll get back to you."

00:32:25.767 --> 00:32:27.400
They didn't have
the information.

00:32:27.501 --> 00:32:29.834
So, we were involved
in the process

00:32:29.934 --> 00:32:32.534
of writing protocols
on how to do this.

00:32:32.634 --> 00:32:35.000
BILL KELLY: On the fly?
DR. IWEN: On the fly.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:37.667
 NARRATOR: In the movies,
 heroes treating a pandemic

00:32:37.767 --> 00:32:40.767
 wear sturdy high-tech
 biohazard suits,

00:32:40.868 --> 00:32:43.234
sterilized in chemical showers.

00:32:43.334 --> 00:32:46.767
 The truth, in this unit,
 most personal protective gear

00:32:46.868 --> 00:32:48.801
 gets thrown away.

00:32:48.901 --> 00:32:52.367
 The garbage infected with
 Ebola accumulated quickly.

00:32:52.467 --> 00:32:55.968
 Day after day, 1,000
 pounds per patient.

00:32:56.067 --> 00:32:58.467
FRANK FREIHAUT: In general, it
was probably four or five times

00:32:58.567 --> 00:33:02.601
the normal daily waste
coming out of an ICU room.

00:33:02.701 --> 00:33:06.167
 (opening autoclave door)

00:33:06.267 --> 00:33:08.634
 NARRATOR: Hospitals
 routinely use an autoclave,

00:33:08.734 --> 00:33:11.033
 a method of high-pressure
 steam cleaning

00:33:11.133 --> 00:33:13.434
 to sterilize equipment.

00:33:13.534 --> 00:33:15.067
 Here, it also decontaminates

00:33:15.167 --> 00:33:17.901
 the dangerous
 garbage left behind.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.367
 (closing autoclave door)

00:33:19.467 --> 00:33:22.267
 Efficiencies learned after
 treating the first patient

00:33:22.367 --> 00:33:24.767
 allowed the team to
 reduce the amount of waste

00:33:24.868 --> 00:33:27.234
 by hundreds of pounds.

00:33:27.334 --> 00:33:29.901
 Safe-handling
 remained a constant.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.467
FREIHAUT: It was clean
stored in the hot zone,

00:33:32.567 --> 00:33:33.400
several steps there,

00:33:33.501 --> 00:33:34.934
and then it would be wiped again

00:33:35.033 --> 00:33:36.868
and brought up to the warm zone

00:33:36.968 --> 00:33:38.701
where somebody in the full PPE

00:33:38.801 --> 00:33:40.934
that's running the
autoclave could then get it

00:33:41.033 --> 00:33:42.734
and cleanly get it
to the autoclave,

00:33:42.834 --> 00:33:46.834
and then run through the
steps of the autoclave.

00:33:49.467 --> 00:33:51.868
 NARRATOR: Mundane routines
 become life and death matters

00:33:51.968 --> 00:33:53.234
 in the unit.

00:33:53.334 --> 00:33:54.968
The medical team stayed healthy

00:33:55.067 --> 00:33:57.601
 as a second Ebola
 patient left their care

00:33:57.701 --> 00:33:59.868
 to celebrate his recovery.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.901
ASHOKA MUKPO: When I first came
in, you know Dr. Smith,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.267
I looked up at him and I said

00:34:04.367 --> 00:34:05.734
"Am I going to make it?"

00:34:05.834 --> 00:34:07.767
He goes, "We don't know a
whole lot about this disease."

00:34:07.868 --> 00:34:09.834
 (laughing)

00:34:09.934 --> 00:34:12.033
 NARRATOR: Once again,
 the treatment cycle worked,

00:34:12.133 --> 00:34:14.834
 hydration and
 appropriate medication.

00:34:14.934 --> 00:34:17.501
 Blood tests from
 Ashoka Mukpo confirmed

00:34:17.601 --> 00:34:20.834
 he was Ebola-free
 in just 20 days,

00:34:20.934 --> 00:34:23.934
 five days sooner
 than Rick Sacra.

00:34:24.033 --> 00:34:25.133
DR. PHIL SMITH: We feel
we learned some things

00:34:25.234 --> 00:34:27.100
about the natural
course of the disease

00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:30.100
and how to intervene,
and we're applying

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.634
what we've learned
to the new patient.

00:34:32.734 --> 00:34:34.467
 NARRATOR: Even as
 a cure seemed elusive,

00:34:34.567 --> 00:34:36.567
 the lessons learned
 from the treatment

00:34:36.667 --> 00:34:39.501
 of patients in Nebraska
 and at Emory University

00:34:39.601 --> 00:34:43.300
 seemed to improve the overall
 health of the patients

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.701
 making it possible
 to survive Ebola.

00:34:46.801 --> 00:34:48.534
DR. KHAN: The care
in Africa was influenced

00:34:48.634 --> 00:34:50.901
by the care here because
we learned very quickly

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.067
how much fluids
we should be giving,

00:34:53.167 --> 00:34:54.667
what type of fluids
we should be giving.

00:34:54.767 --> 00:34:56.901
What sort of electrolytes
we should be monitoring.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.067
So, that was easily
transferable.

00:35:00.167 --> 00:35:01.400
 NARRATOR:
 Successful models used

00:35:01.501 --> 00:35:03.968
 to care for the
 American patients proved

00:35:04.067 --> 00:35:05.434
 to be of little value
 in the treatment

00:35:05.534 --> 00:35:07.200
 of Dr. Martin Salia.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.200
 NARRATOR: Dr. Salia served
 in missionary hospitals

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.367
 throughout his
 career as a surgeon.

00:35:19.467 --> 00:35:22.601
 In 2014, he was
 Chief Medical Officer

00:35:22.701 --> 00:35:25.467
 at the Kissy United
 Methodist Hospital

00:35:25.567 --> 00:35:27.234
 in his native Sierra Leone.

00:35:27.334 --> 00:35:28.801
 (beep)

00:35:28.901 --> 00:35:30.834
As the Ebola epidemic worsened,

00:35:30.934 --> 00:35:33.834
 the lifesaving surgeries
 he routinely performed

00:35:33.934 --> 00:35:36.434
 became dangerous, even heroic.

00:35:50.734 --> 00:35:52.067
 NARRATOR: A few weeks
 after that interview,

00:35:52.167 --> 00:35:54.300
 Dr. Salia contracted Ebola.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.467
 A delayed diagnosis gave the
 virus a 13-day headstart.

00:35:58.567 --> 00:36:01.834
 (jet landing)

00:36:01.934 --> 00:36:03.501
REPORTER: We were told
transporting him took longer

00:36:03.601 --> 00:36:06.767
because of how critically
ill Dr. Martin Salia is.

00:36:06.868 --> 00:36:09.501
He was physically unable
to walk off the plane

00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:11.234
and we don't even know--
JOHN-MARTIN LOWE:
As soon as you hear

00:36:11.334 --> 00:36:13.634
that someone's not going
to walk off a plane,

00:36:13.734 --> 00:36:15.000
when the other patients
you have received

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:16.834
have walked off a
plane, you understand

00:36:16.934 --> 00:36:19.133
that the situation is different.

00:36:19.234 --> 00:36:21.167
 NARRATOR: Every aspect
 of the patient's care

00:36:21.267 --> 00:36:22.701
 would be more challenging.

00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:24.934
 Every procedure
 would be more risky

00:36:25.033 --> 00:36:26.767
 for the medical team.

00:36:26.868 --> 00:36:30.000
DR. DAN JOHNSON:
I was his main ICU physician,

00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:33.300
so I admitted him with
Dr. Hewlett and Dr. Smith.

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.601
And I spent, at one point,
30-some hours in a row

00:36:38.701 --> 00:36:41.367
in the unit with
the nursing staff

00:36:41.467 --> 00:36:43.834
and the other team
members trying

00:36:43.934 --> 00:36:46.467
to turn him for the better.

00:36:46.567 --> 00:36:48.634
DR. ANGELA HEWLETT: He was very
sick, not only in person,

00:36:48.734 --> 00:36:50.767
but also on paper,
in his lab work.

00:36:50.868 --> 00:36:53.667
And we knew that it
was going to be a real,

00:36:53.767 --> 00:36:55.200
a real uphill battle.

00:36:55.300 --> 00:36:56.834
DR. JOHNSON: We applied
every possible therapy

00:36:56.934 --> 00:36:58.534
to every problem that he had,

00:36:58.634 --> 00:37:02.400
just the way we do in the
regular intensive care unit.

00:37:02.501 --> 00:37:04.100
Nothing was held
back because he was

00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.567
in the biocontainment unit.

00:37:06.667 --> 00:37:09.501
DR. HEWLETT: It was too late,
and we battled.

00:37:09.601 --> 00:37:12.267
And by battle, I mean,
it was a real battle

00:37:12.367 --> 00:37:13.868
and I've seen a lot of
patients in the ICU.

00:37:13.968 --> 00:37:16.767
I do that routinely
as part of my job,

00:37:16.868 --> 00:37:20.000
but he was incredibly sick.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:21.267
And at those last few hours,

00:37:21.367 --> 00:37:22.767
we knew that we weren't winning.

00:37:22.868 --> 00:37:26.234
DR. JOHNSON: And it was clear
that after some period of time,

00:37:26.334 --> 00:37:29.067
his body was just,
it had shut down.

00:37:29.167 --> 00:37:30.634
His body couldn't go on anymore.

00:37:30.734 --> 00:37:33.434
The disease had overwhelmed him,

00:37:33.534 --> 00:37:40.334
and it was an
absolutely awful feeling

00:37:41.467 --> 00:37:43.901
when I realized that
we needed to stop.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.534
That he had died.

00:37:45.634 --> 00:37:47.067
And anything more
that we did to him

00:37:47.167 --> 00:37:50.834
was not ethical or humane.

00:37:52.267 --> 00:37:55.467
And I remember looking at him

00:37:59.267 --> 00:37:59.367
and just taking
his hand. (crying)

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.367
It was particularly
difficult because

00:38:08.467 --> 00:38:10.133
he was an amazing person.

00:38:10.234 --> 00:38:28.634
 (solemn instrumental music)

00:38:28.734 --> 00:38:32.167
DR. JOHNSON: The next step
though was to tell my team,

00:38:32.267 --> 00:38:34.467
everybody in the room.

00:38:34.567 --> 00:38:38.234
"Everybody listen,
don't do anything

00:38:38.334 --> 00:38:41.501
"that's going to compromise
your own health and safety."

00:38:41.601 --> 00:38:44.567
We were going to follow
those protocols perfectly

00:38:44.667 --> 00:38:47.901
so that no one in this room
ends up with this disease.

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.834
DR. HEWLETT: We watched how
terrible this disease is.

00:38:49.934 --> 00:38:51.234
We saw it in person.

00:38:51.334 --> 00:38:54.334
And I think that Dr.
Johnson did an excellent job

00:38:54.434 --> 00:38:56.367
of just taking a
step back and saying

00:38:56.467 --> 00:39:00.400
"All this is happening and
we all want to grieve."

00:39:00.501 --> 00:39:01.334
"We all wanted to.

00:39:01.434 --> 00:39:02.634
"But, we need to also remember

00:39:02.734 --> 00:39:04.167
"that we need to be careful."

00:39:04.267 --> 00:39:06.534
BETSY FLOOD: That's
one of everybody's goal

00:39:06.634 --> 00:39:08.434
as a healthcare worker
when someone dies,

00:39:08.534 --> 00:39:10.834
to give them that
grace and dignity.

00:39:10.934 --> 00:39:13.968
DR. HEWLETT:
And patients that die from
Ebola are very infectious.

00:39:14.067 --> 00:39:15.767
That's part of the
reason that this disease

00:39:15.868 --> 00:39:17.968
was rapidly
transmitted in Africa

00:39:18.067 --> 00:39:19.734
was during that burial process.

00:39:19.834 --> 00:39:21.367
And after patients had died,

00:39:21.467 --> 00:39:23.267
people contaminating themselves

00:39:23.367 --> 00:39:26.167
and getting sick
from that process.

00:39:26.267 --> 00:39:29.000
 NARRATOR: The process,
 disposing of human remains,

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.734
 put a crucial safety
 procedure to the test

00:39:31.834 --> 00:39:34.901
 for the first time at
 the medical center.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.567
 It became a unique mixture
 of ritual and caution.

00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:41.334
ANGELA VASA: Yes, we did
have to follow CDC guidelines

00:39:41.434 --> 00:39:44.601
and our own protocol
to package the remains,

00:39:44.701 --> 00:39:46.400
but we had the support
of our institution

00:39:46.501 --> 00:39:47.767
to go above and beyond that.

00:39:47.868 --> 00:39:49.234
To take the time.

00:39:49.334 --> 00:39:52.601
BOULTER: We wrap our patient
in their bedding first.

00:39:52.701 --> 00:39:55.667
And then, when we go to put
them into the mortuary bags,

00:39:55.767 --> 00:39:58.767
we even put the pillow
behind their head.

00:39:58.868 --> 00:40:00.467
 NARRATOR: At every
 stage, the medical team

00:40:00.567 --> 00:40:03.167
 swabs surfaces with bleach.

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:05.234
 The deceased is
 placed between sheets

00:40:05.334 --> 00:40:09.934
 of special watertight material
 to contain any biohazard.

00:40:10.033 --> 00:40:12.701
Every edge is heat-sealed twice.

00:40:13.968 --> 00:40:15.834
 A separate crew in
 protective gear helps

00:40:15.934 --> 00:40:17.868
 transfer the body
 through the doorway

00:40:17.968 --> 00:40:21.334
 into the warm zone and
 a third containment bag

00:40:21.434 --> 00:40:24.434
 before being prepared
 for cremation.

00:40:25.634 --> 00:40:27.000
VASA: And then, to be able
to provide those ashes

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:28.934
back to the family, I
think that that was really

00:40:29.033 --> 00:40:30.901
a relief for the family.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.200
And I think that,
for us, that's where

00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:35.934
it was such an
intense experience

00:40:36.033 --> 00:40:38.601
because we knew
the type of person

00:40:38.701 --> 00:40:40.100
that we were treating.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.834
And I think that we really
felt it very intensely

00:40:41.934 --> 00:40:44.234
because we were not able to help

00:40:44.334 --> 00:40:48.100
this particular person
survive the disease.

00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.234
 (dramatic instrumental music)

00:40:51.334 --> 00:40:52.734
SUE HUNTER: We didn't
think Ebola was going

00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:55.434
to be in the State of Nebraska.

00:40:55.534 --> 00:40:58.033
It brought it home real hard.

00:40:58.133 --> 00:41:02.033
You always think someone
else will handle that.

00:41:02.133 --> 00:41:04.033
 (zipper closing)

00:41:04.133 --> 00:41:05.601
 NARRATOR: The big
 lessons for emergency crews

00:41:05.701 --> 00:41:08.567
 and hospitals across Nebraska
 and across the country,

00:41:08.667 --> 00:41:11.267
 planning and practice
 can improve the odds

00:41:11.367 --> 00:41:13.634
 of keeping safe
 the medical teams

00:41:13.734 --> 00:41:16.634
 and the people out
 in the community.

00:41:16.734 --> 00:41:18.934
 (music and siren)

00:41:19.033 --> 00:41:20.934
 EMT: Midwest Medical
 to Saint Elizabeth,

00:41:21.033 --> 00:41:24.467
 we are transporting
 an Ebola patient.

00:41:24.567 --> 00:41:26.801
 DISPATCHER: What's
 your ETA Midwest Medical?

00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:28.968
 EMT: 10 minutes.

00:41:29.067 --> 00:41:31.801
NURSE: Midwest encoded that
they were 10 minutes away

00:41:31.901 --> 00:41:35.167
with an Ebola patient,
but no other details.

00:41:35.267 --> 00:41:37.367
 EMT 1: He's got diarrhea.

00:41:37.467 --> 00:41:38.667
 EMT 2: And fluid in his lungs.

00:41:38.767 --> 00:41:40.367
 EMT 1: Could have
 fluid in his lungs.

00:41:40.467 --> 00:41:41.200
NURSE: Okay.

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:45.067
 (ambulance driving in)

00:41:45.167 --> 00:41:46.968
NURSE: Okay, so let's get our
areas marked appropriately

00:41:47.067 --> 00:41:49.801
so we have our cold
zone marked off.

00:41:49.901 --> 00:41:53.434
 (beeping)

00:41:53.534 --> 00:41:55.300
 WOMAN ON LOUDSPEAKER:
 Attention all house staff,

00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.767
 this is an infectious
 disease exercise.

00:41:59.868 --> 00:42:02.734
 Command center has
 been activated.

00:42:03.901 --> 00:42:05.234
DR. THOMAS SAFRANEK: It's
taking the worst-case scenario

00:42:05.334 --> 00:42:07.934
and learning off of that,
and it's almost like

00:42:08.033 --> 00:42:09.634
if you can deal with
that, you're going

00:42:09.734 --> 00:42:11.467
to be fine with many
of these other ones.

00:42:12.534 --> 00:42:13.701
 NARRATOR: For
 years, medical centers

00:42:13.801 --> 00:42:15.968
 used realistic drills
 to test their ability

00:42:16.067 --> 00:42:18.634
 to cope with a mass
 casualty tornado,

00:42:18.734 --> 00:42:20.334
 or a school bus crash.

00:42:20.434 --> 00:42:22.400
 (coughing)

00:42:22.501 --> 00:42:25.501
 NARRATOR: Since Ebola, many
 hospitals stage test runs

00:42:25.601 --> 00:42:29.434
 for staff who might encounter
 a highly-infectious disease.

00:42:29.534 --> 00:42:31.901
 Surprise complications
 expose flaws

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.033
 in training or equipment.

00:42:34.133 --> 00:42:37.901
 Honest input from staff
 helps improve the system.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.634
SUE HUNTER: We know Ebola may
not hit, but there may be

00:42:39.734 --> 00:42:41.767
another infectious
disease of something

00:42:41.868 --> 00:42:44.234
that the practice
and the information

00:42:44.334 --> 00:42:47.200
that we learn from that,
we'll be able to apply.

00:42:48.367 --> 00:42:49.367
DR. HEWLETT:
The things that we had done,

00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:50.901
it doesn't make any sense for us

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.167
to do this in a silo and to
just work it out on our own

00:42:54.267 --> 00:42:56.667
and not tell anybody else,
because other centers

00:42:56.767 --> 00:42:59.000
may encounter these
types of patients.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:00.267
DR. PHIL SMITH:
The care and coordination

00:43:00.367 --> 00:43:02.400
of highly-infectious
disease patients

00:43:02.501 --> 00:43:04.701
and related procedural training.

00:43:04.801 --> 00:43:06.300
My name is Phil Smith.

00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:09.234
I'm Medical Director of
the Biocontainment Unit

00:43:09.334 --> 00:43:12.067
and welcome you to
our program today.

00:43:12.167 --> 00:43:13.534
 NARRATOR: In the months
 following the treatment

00:43:13.634 --> 00:43:15.634
of the Ebola patients in the US,

00:43:15.734 --> 00:43:18.701
 there was a tremendous
 demand for information.

00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:20.501
 Healthcare professionals
 hoped to benefit

00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:24.868
from the lessons learned during
these rare high-risk cases.

00:43:24.968 --> 00:43:26.167
DR. HEWLETT: Other
facilities have to be ready

00:43:26.267 --> 00:43:27.767
to take care of these patients,

00:43:27.868 --> 00:43:29.934
and we were very willing
to share our learnings,

00:43:30.033 --> 00:43:32.667
our learnings clinically,
our learnings operationally

00:43:32.767 --> 00:43:35.267
with everyone who was
willing to listen.

00:43:36.367 --> 00:43:38.767
SCHWEDHELM:
Truly, one of the barriers
identified was, you know,

00:43:38.868 --> 00:43:40.300
"I've been doing
this for 20 years.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.501
"It's never happened to me."

00:43:42.601 --> 00:43:43.968
 NARRATOR: Sometimes
 the most basic lessons

00:43:44.067 --> 00:43:46.267
 became the most essential.

00:43:46.367 --> 00:43:48.400
SCHWEDHELM: It doesn't have to
be all the bells and whistles

00:43:48.501 --> 00:43:51.133
that we had, but
you need to know how

00:43:51.234 --> 00:43:54.367
to wear proper personal
protective equipment.

00:43:54.467 --> 00:43:57.834
I think I would just say
basic PPE and solid screening.

00:43:57.934 --> 00:44:00.567
Two things that could
help us the most.

00:44:00.667 --> 00:44:02.868
WOMAN: I'm not
feeling very well.

00:44:02.968 --> 00:44:05.067
 NARRATOR: That
 second piece, screening,

00:44:05.167 --> 00:44:07.334
 being alert for
 what might be coming

00:44:07.434 --> 00:44:10.000
through the emergency room door.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.334
WOMAN: My chest really hurts
and I have a bad cough.

00:44:13.434 --> 00:44:15.801
 NARRATOR: In most cases,
 the Biocontainment Unit

00:44:15.901 --> 00:44:19.067
 would get some warning
 before a case arrives.

00:44:19.167 --> 00:44:21.801
 Any other hospital
 never knows for sure.

00:44:21.901 --> 00:44:25.734
 The consequences of
 misdiagnosing that one case

00:44:25.834 --> 00:44:27.934
 of Ebola at the
 hospital in Dallas

00:44:28.033 --> 00:44:30.934
 became a cautionary tale
 heard around the world.

00:44:32.501 --> 00:44:34.100
SUE HUNTER: Prior to all
this, if someone had presented

00:44:34.200 --> 00:44:36.167
with some of those
symptoms who we check

00:44:36.267 --> 00:44:37.801
into our emergency
room, they've gone back

00:44:37.901 --> 00:44:39.033
to the emergency room.

00:44:39.133 --> 00:44:42.400
And then, if we truly
had something like this,

00:44:42.501 --> 00:44:45.167
we could have shut down
the emergency room.

00:44:45.267 --> 00:44:47.567
And that would create
quite a problem,

00:44:47.667 --> 00:44:49.601
so we've learned a lot.

00:44:51.934 --> 00:44:54.467
 NARRATOR: Before the
 Ebola crisis subsided,

00:44:54.567 --> 00:44:57.968
 the Federal Centers for
 Disease Control, the CDC,

00:44:58.067 --> 00:45:00.434
 updated guidelines for
 checking in patients

00:45:00.534 --> 00:45:02.634
 at hospitals and clinics.

00:45:02.734 --> 00:45:03.868
NURSE: Have you been outside
of the United States

00:45:03.968 --> 00:45:06.067
in the last 21 days.
 WOMAN: No, I have not.

00:45:06.167 --> 00:45:07.634
NURSE: No.

00:45:07.734 --> 00:45:10.000
DR. BRADY BEECHAM: The
CDC gives us some guidance
about questions to ask

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.400
and often it has to do
with have you traveled

00:45:12.501 --> 00:45:13.868
outside of the United States?

00:45:13.968 --> 00:45:17.534
Have you received
routine immunizations?

00:45:17.634 --> 00:45:20.701
Because it is hard to tell
just by looking at somebody.

00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:22.901
 NARRATOR: That woman with
 a fever might have returned

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.567
 from Sierra Leone where
 Ebola remains a threat,

00:45:26.667 --> 00:45:28.868
 or contracted Zika
 from a mosquito bite

00:45:28.968 --> 00:45:31.601
 during a church
 mission trip to Haiti.

00:45:31.701 --> 00:45:35.033
 Or picked up tuberculosis
 from a visiting relative.

00:45:35.133 --> 00:45:37.000
DR. BEECHAM: In a community like
Lexington where we have lots

00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:38.501
of people that
are moving around,

00:45:38.601 --> 00:45:41.267
the temptation is to say,
"Alright, we have a lot

00:45:41.367 --> 00:45:42.634
"of immigrants."

00:45:42.734 --> 00:45:45.167
Naturally, we consider
ourselves to be at higher risk.

00:45:45.267 --> 00:45:46.801
And while that may
be true, it's also

00:45:46.901 --> 00:45:49.133
a more specific
conversation with somebody

00:45:49.234 --> 00:45:50.934
about where have you traveled?

00:45:51.033 --> 00:45:52.434
Those are the kind of
things that help us

00:45:52.534 --> 00:45:55.367
as much as looking at
somebody's nationality.

00:45:55.467 --> 00:45:56.501
 NARRATOR: Just
 how bad could it get

00:45:56.601 --> 00:45:59.033
 if it all goes wrong?

00:45:59.133 --> 00:46:01.567
MODERATOR: And today,
we have you all in one room

00:46:01.667 --> 00:46:04.734
and we're finally to the
point where we are going

00:46:04.834 --> 00:46:09.467
to exercise that pandemic
really impacting your community.

00:46:09.567 --> 00:46:12.667
 NARRATOR: In Dawson County,
 a fictional epidemic drill

00:46:12.767 --> 00:46:15.834
 organized by a regional
 public health cooperative

00:46:15.934 --> 00:46:18.400
 revealed how quickly
 an influenza outbreak

00:46:18.501 --> 00:46:21.767
 could undermine
 community institutions.

00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:26.567
LADY: Oh,
this is our school nurse.

00:46:26.667 --> 00:46:28.067
 NARRATOR: They
 started the exercise

00:46:28.167 --> 00:46:31.100
 by randomly picking names of
 crucial real-world characters

00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.968
 lost to the flu.

00:46:33.067 --> 00:46:35.801
 Those too ill or already dead.

00:46:35.901 --> 00:46:38.400
DR. SAFRANEK:
The problem is this,
when the healthcare workers

00:46:38.501 --> 00:46:40.634
start coming down with
this, and you take

00:46:40.734 --> 00:46:43.100
a disease like influenza
where we're all

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:45.200
co-mingling out there
in the community,

00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.968
your healthcare
worker may have a risk

00:46:47.067 --> 00:46:50.567
of picking the disease up
in the course of their job.

00:46:50.667 --> 00:46:53.067
PARTICIPANT 1: The clinic is
flooded because we've lost

00:46:53.167 --> 00:46:54.968
at least two of the
people at the front desk

00:46:55.067 --> 00:46:56.834
and one of our providers.

00:46:56.934 --> 00:46:58.367
PARTICIPANT 2:
So, they're saying I don't
want to wait in line.

00:46:58.467 --> 00:46:59.834
It's like listen, you will wait

00:46:59.934 --> 00:47:01.834
if you're healthier than
the person in front of you.

00:47:01.934 --> 00:47:03.801
DR. SAFRANEK: When you
workforce at the facilities

00:47:03.901 --> 00:47:07.133
is decimated, then
you're really straining

00:47:07.234 --> 00:47:08.868
your care provision resources,

00:47:08.968 --> 00:47:10.567
so it's a major problem.

00:47:10.667 --> 00:47:12.300
DR. BEECHAM: We would
implement our protocols

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.033
to try to keep people
as safe as possible

00:47:14.133 --> 00:47:15.868
and separated from each other.

00:47:15.968 --> 00:47:17.601
 NARRATOR: What is happening
 outside the hospital

00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:21.267
 starts to strain the very
 fabric of the community.

00:47:21.367 --> 00:47:23.067
MALE PARTICIPANT 1: Law
enforcement being down.

00:47:23.167 --> 00:47:26.767
They've called in all
available off-duty, retired,

00:47:26.868 --> 00:47:30.534
possible using security
guards for local facilities.

00:47:30.634 --> 00:47:32.167
ALLISON FIKE: So, it brings out
questions that you need

00:47:32.267 --> 00:47:34.133
to be answered by your staff,

00:47:34.234 --> 00:47:37.300
your administration,
you yourself.

00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:38.801
What if I was sick?

00:47:38.901 --> 00:47:40.267
Who's going to fill my position

00:47:40.367 --> 00:47:42.300
and know as much
as I need to know

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:45.234
to fulfill that
requirement and to have

00:47:45.334 --> 00:47:49.067
the information that they need
to continue down the road.

00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:52.234
PARTICIPANT 2:
So, this baby is dying if we
don't take immediate action.

00:47:52.334 --> 00:47:54.634
Will you call Lifeflight and
see if they can still take her?

00:47:54.734 --> 00:47:57.701
MALE PARTICIPANT 2: I do think
this is influenza-related,

00:47:57.801 --> 00:48:01.968
so we need to proceed with
caution with the family.

00:48:02.067 --> 00:48:03.901
FIKE: By us going
exercises like this,

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.300
making people aware that we are
planning for the unexpected.

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:08.767
Will it ever happen?

00:48:08.868 --> 00:48:10.501
We don't know, but at
least when it does happen,

00:48:10.601 --> 00:48:14.234
we have something to go
off of rather than nothing.

00:48:14.334 --> 00:48:17.434
MALE PARTICIPANT 1: The
funeral homes are already
getting inundated.

00:48:17.534 --> 00:48:20.567
Refrigerated vehicles
are being ordered

00:48:20.667 --> 00:48:22.734
to come in to house the dead.

00:48:23.834 --> 00:48:25.601
 NARRATOR: The fictional
 outbreak in Dawson County

00:48:25.701 --> 00:48:29.801
 mirrored a historic
 calamity from 100 years ago.

00:48:29.901 --> 00:48:32.901
 Spanish influenza killed
 on a massive scale

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.634
 in Nebraska, across America,
 and across the world.

00:48:37.734 --> 00:48:39.667
DR. BEECHAM:
From what we know from 1918,

00:48:39.767 --> 00:48:41.801
they talk about
huge death rates,

00:48:41.901 --> 00:48:45.167
death among old people,
death among pregnant people.

00:48:45.267 --> 00:48:47.734
I mean, imagine young,
health pregnant women

00:48:47.834 --> 00:48:50.367
suddenly dying of the flu.

00:48:50.467 --> 00:48:51.968
I think it would be a
really frightening event

00:48:52.067 --> 00:48:53.634
because it's not just
people getting sick,

00:48:53.734 --> 00:48:55.501
it's people dying and
young people dying,

00:48:55.601 --> 00:48:57.367
young healthy people.

00:48:58.734 --> 00:48:59.934
 NARRATOR: Visit a
 cemetery of a certain age

00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.300
 anywhere in America
 and graves of the dead

00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:07.667
 from the winter of 1918
 can easily be found.

00:49:07.767 --> 00:49:09.968
 The death toll worldwide
 may have exceeded

00:49:10.067 --> 00:49:12.267
 50 million people.

00:49:13.067 --> 00:49:14.767
DR. THOMAS SAFRANEK:
That was a respiratory spread.

00:49:14.868 --> 00:49:17.801
Anybody within three feet
of somebody who had it

00:49:17.901 --> 00:49:19.267
was at risk.

00:49:19.367 --> 00:49:22.467
That was probably, I would
say, worse than Ebola

00:49:22.567 --> 00:49:24.601
in terms of its virulence.

00:49:24.701 --> 00:49:26.300
The combination of its virulence

00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.367
and its ease of communicability.

00:49:29.467 --> 00:49:30.901
 NARRATOR: Public
 health experts consider

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.033
 a lethal strain of the flu
 the most likely scenario

00:49:34.133 --> 00:49:36.734
 for a modern killer pandemic.

00:49:36.834 --> 00:49:39.834
 A rogue strain of the
 flu could present itself

00:49:39.934 --> 00:49:41.067
 anywhere in the world.

00:49:42.334 --> 00:49:47.200
DR. KHAN: 750,000 Americans died
a century ago from influenza.

00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:49.400
Influenza could be really bad.

00:49:49.501 --> 00:49:51.567
I mean, it is our
biggest concern

00:49:51.667 --> 00:49:55.067
about what a pandemic
could look like.

00:49:55.167 --> 00:49:57.334
 BILL KELLY: Modern medicine,
 couldn't happen again?

00:49:57.434 --> 00:50:00.434
 DR. KHAN: (laughing) Sorry.

00:50:01.434 --> 00:50:02.367
It makes me laugh.

00:50:02.467 --> 00:50:04.467
 (solemn instrumental music)

00:50:04.567 --> 00:50:08.601
DR. KHAN: It's a big fallacy to
think that modern medicine

00:50:08.701 --> 00:50:10.834
would protect us completely

00:50:10.934 --> 00:50:13.601
from the next
influenza pandemic.

00:50:13.701 --> 00:50:20.167
 (solemn instrumental music)

00:50:20.267 --> 00:50:23.334
 (dispatcher instructions
 over loudspeaker)

00:50:23.434 --> 00:50:25.634
 NARRATOR: Two years after
 Ebola came to Nebraska,

00:50:25.734 --> 00:50:27.667
 the Omaha Fire
 Department received word

00:50:27.767 --> 00:50:30.133
 from the Biocontainment
 Unit, a new round

00:50:30.234 --> 00:50:34.434
 of patients would be
 delivered by jet from Liberia.

00:50:34.534 --> 00:50:35.634
JOHN-MARTIN LOWE:
So, what I want to do is I want

00:50:35.734 --> 00:50:38.968
to pull together the
drivers and the medics.

00:50:39.067 --> 00:50:41.968
 NARRATOR: Patients arrived
 one at a time in 2014,

00:50:42.067 --> 00:50:43.834
 delivered weeks apart.

00:50:43.934 --> 00:50:46.767
 This time, three Americans
 contracted the disease

00:50:46.868 --> 00:50:49.234
 within days of each
 other and needed

00:50:49.334 --> 00:50:52.601
 to be airlifted out
 of Africa, immediately.

00:50:52.701 --> 00:50:56.534
DR. PAUL SCHENARTS: Patient
number one's a 34-year-old
male, 125 kilos.

00:50:56.634 --> 00:50:59.667
Fever, weakness, renal
failure, liver failure,

00:50:59.767 --> 00:51:01.434
respiratory distress.

00:51:01.534 --> 00:51:03.033
 NARRATOR: Three
 separate ambulance crews

00:51:03.133 --> 00:51:04.968
 will be dispatched
 to the airport.

00:51:05.067 --> 00:51:07.234
DR. SCHENARTS: We don't do IV's
and we don't do crazy stuff.

00:51:07.334 --> 00:51:09.634
Alright, they're
rarely doing CPR.

00:51:09.734 --> 00:51:11.868
With this disease,
that person's dead,

00:51:11.968 --> 00:51:14.334
so no sense making
things worse for us

00:51:14.434 --> 00:51:17.300
in an unsuccessful attempt.

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:19.133
 NARRATOR: This is,
 however, a drill organized

00:51:19.234 --> 00:51:22.300
 by the US Department of
 State and the medical center.

00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:24.868
DR. SAFRANEK: One size doesn't
fit all, but if you're doing

00:51:24.968 --> 00:51:27.000
a really good job on
rehearsing and planning

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:29.968
and dealing with one
event, it gives you

00:51:30.067 --> 00:51:31.868
the comfort level
and the confidence

00:51:31.968 --> 00:51:33.934
that you can deal
with different events

00:51:34.033 --> 00:51:36.601
that have different kinds of
disease transmission scenario.

00:51:36.701 --> 00:51:38.934
 (cutting plastic)

00:51:39.033 --> 00:51:40.234
EMT: Perfect.

00:51:40.334 --> 00:51:41.467
 NARRATOR:
 Ambulances delivering

00:51:41.567 --> 00:51:43.834
 highly infectious
 patients are wrapped

00:51:43.934 --> 00:51:45.801
 in industrial-weight
 plastic sheeting.

00:51:45.901 --> 00:51:47.434
 (cutting plastic)

00:51:47.534 --> 00:51:49.934
LOWE: We're trying to mitigate
the risk of contamination

00:51:50.033 --> 00:51:54.434
of that ambulance and
we're trying to make sure

00:51:54.534 --> 00:51:57.334
that any cleaning of
that ambulance is good,

00:51:57.434 --> 00:51:59.801
so that if we put that
ambulance back into service,

00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:02.801
we know beyond a shadow of
a doubt that it's clean.

00:52:02.901 --> 00:52:04.767
 NARRATOR: Before
 2014, only a handful

00:52:04.868 --> 00:52:07.367
 of first responders
 prepared plans

00:52:07.467 --> 00:52:09.534
 for these unusual cases.

00:52:09.634 --> 00:52:11.434
 The guidelines, tested
 in the real world

00:52:11.534 --> 00:52:15.167
 by UNMC and Emory
 University became the bible

00:52:15.267 --> 00:52:17.834
 for emergency
 medical responders.

00:52:17.934 --> 00:52:20.567
 (sirens blaring)

00:52:20.667 --> 00:52:22.601
DR. ALI KHAN: It's now
fair to say, a year later,

00:52:22.701 --> 00:52:25.100
that we didn't infect any
of our healthcare workers

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.033
and we definitely did
not infect our community.

00:52:28.133 --> 00:52:30.067
And not only did we
not infect anybody,

00:52:30.167 --> 00:52:32.634
but we actually sort
of blazed the trail

00:52:32.734 --> 00:52:36.501
on how can you take
care of patients safely

00:52:36.601 --> 00:52:38.501
but also take care of them.

00:52:38.601 --> 00:52:40.634
And this is brand new.

00:52:40.734 --> 00:52:42.100
 NARRATOR: Many of
 the lessons learned

00:52:42.200 --> 00:52:44.767
 will soon be shared inside
 a new training center

00:52:44.868 --> 00:52:46.667
 on the med center's campus.

00:52:46.767 --> 00:52:49.367
UNMC SPOKESMAN: So, we have
two separate quarantine units.

00:52:49.467 --> 00:52:51.701
 NARRATOR: With $24
 million in federal funds,

00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:54.601
 the National Center for
 Health Security plans

00:52:54.701 --> 00:52:56.601
 to use high-tech
 training methods

00:52:56.701 --> 00:52:59.634
 to the benefit of American
 government researchers

00:52:59.734 --> 00:53:03.934
 and medical teams struggling
 to contain a pandemic.

00:53:04.033 --> 00:53:05.801
UNMC SPOKESMAN:
In addition to the quarantine,

00:53:05.901 --> 00:53:09.434
we'll have an entire
biocontainment unit

00:53:09.534 --> 00:53:11.434
that's simulated here
with state-of-the-art

00:53:11.534 --> 00:53:13.234
training opportunities.

00:53:13.334 --> 00:53:15.534
 (people talking)

00:53:15.634 --> 00:53:17.067
 NARRATOR: Word came
 that the jet carrying

00:53:17.167 --> 00:53:19.901
 the simulated Ebola
 patients would be arriving

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:20.667
 within minutes.

00:53:20.767 --> 00:53:21.834
 (putting on protective gear)

00:53:21.934 --> 00:53:24.300
 For some of the
 paramedics, this marked

00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:27.534
 their first experience donning
 personal protective gear

00:53:27.634 --> 00:53:29.100
 under pressure.

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:32.334
EMT: We have about 10
minutes before we need to leave.

00:53:32.434 --> 00:53:34.033
 NARRATOR: For EMT's,
 testing the procedures

00:53:34.133 --> 00:53:37.234
 and learning the risks of
 highly-infectious diseases

00:53:37.334 --> 00:53:39.801
 can determine how
 comfortable they'd be

00:53:39.901 --> 00:53:42.701
 volunteering for these
 hazardous assignments.

00:53:42.801 --> 00:53:44.167
LOWE: I think that that
helps us when we go out

00:53:44.267 --> 00:53:47.067
and ask someone to presumably

00:53:47.167 --> 00:53:51.234
put their own wellness at risk
by entering this environment.

00:53:51.334 --> 00:53:52.400
 (closing ambulance doors)

00:53:52.501 --> 00:53:53.901
That they're able to
make that decision

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.801
in an informed manner
based on science.

00:53:58.033 --> 00:54:00.067
 NARRATOR: The three
 patients arrive from Liberia

00:54:00.167 --> 00:54:02.968
 in a specially
 outfitted Boeing 747

00:54:03.067 --> 00:54:05.934
 chartered from a private
 medical transport service.

00:54:07.267 --> 00:54:09.801
 The weather provided a
 real-life slap in the face

00:54:09.901 --> 00:54:12.367
 that computer models and
 conference room discussions

00:54:12.467 --> 00:54:14.534
 can never duplicate.

00:54:14.634 --> 00:54:17.334
 Bitterly cold,
 40-mile-an-hour winds ripped

00:54:17.434 --> 00:54:20.667
 protective masks from
 the faces of the EMT's.

00:54:20.767 --> 00:54:23.334
 The elevator platform
 shook and rattled

00:54:23.434 --> 00:54:25.400
 as it delivered
 patients from the plane

00:54:25.501 --> 00:54:27.167
 to ambulances below.

00:54:28.534 --> 00:54:30.000
 Even in extreme circumstances,

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:33.000
crews stuck to their protocols.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.133
LOWE: That would allow us to
test the full spectrum

00:54:35.234 --> 00:54:38.467
of protocols down to
the minute detail.

00:54:38.567 --> 00:54:41.100
Recognize things that
we felt could be changed

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.534
and done better.

00:54:42.634 --> 00:54:44.000
And we'd make those changes
and in the next year,

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.634
for that big
full-scale exercise,

00:54:45.734 --> 00:54:46.901
we would test those.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.300
So we had a number of
years of doing that.

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.167
 NARRATOR: When the University
 of Nebraska Medical Center

00:54:51.267 --> 00:54:54.133
 Biocontainment Unit opened,
 the team had no clue

00:54:54.234 --> 00:54:56.367
which killer virus would emerge.

00:54:56.467 --> 00:54:59.100
 They can't possible
 predict the next disease.

00:55:00.501 --> 00:55:01.901
DR. PHIL SMITH:
And we didn't know.

00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.167
We didn't back off
on our preparations

00:55:04.267 --> 00:55:06.200
and I'm really glad we didn't.

00:55:06.300 --> 00:55:08.400
But, I think that
there's a good chance

00:55:08.501 --> 00:55:11.167
that during the next 10 years

00:55:11.267 --> 00:55:13.467
that they'll be a disease
that will transferred

00:55:13.567 --> 00:55:15.400
up to the biocontainment unit.

00:55:15.501 --> 00:55:16.968
 NARRATOR: As the
 last patient was loaded

00:55:17.067 --> 00:55:20.400
 into an ambulance, a team
 member in a biohazard suit

00:55:20.501 --> 00:55:22.934
 walked down the
 airplane's stairway

00:55:23.033 --> 00:55:26.467
 carefully wiping down the
 railing with disinfectant.

00:55:26.567 --> 00:55:28.734
 Details mattered here.

00:55:28.834 --> 00:55:32.467
 The details need to matter
 in hospitals, big and small.

00:55:32.567 --> 00:55:35.367
 Every city and county
 in America has a chance

00:55:35.467 --> 00:55:39.701
 to prepare for whatever
 arrives after Ebola.

00:55:39.801 --> 00:55:42.868
The question is, are they ready?

00:55:42.968 --> 00:55:45.267
DR. KHAN: We have tons of work
to do in our communities

00:55:45.367 --> 00:55:48.534
to try to make sure that not
just community hospitals,

00:55:48.634 --> 00:55:51.100
but public health
systems are prepared

00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:53.033
for the next pandemic.

00:55:58.234 --> 00:56:02.067
