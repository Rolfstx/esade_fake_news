00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.430
Airplane food used to
look like this.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.210
And this.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.260
But now can look
something like this.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:18.080
For many people economy class used
to mean soggy pasta, rubbery eggs

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.600
and dried out chicken.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.320
For a time, U.S.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.880
airlines even stopped serving free
meals altogether in economy class.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.550
But in 2019 U.S.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.780
airlines posted their tenth straight
year of profitability and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.070
premium and economy cabins are seeing
more food options than ever

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.460
before. At Delta, American and
United, airlines work with celebrity

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.870
chefs to help craft their menus for
people sitting at the front of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.190
the plane. Passengers are a lot
pickier than they used to be.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.650
There seem to be a lot more vegans.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.080
There seem to be a lot where
people who are looking for high protein

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.570
and low carb and gluten free
and airlines are getting those requests

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.750
and they're trying to change
their menus to follow that.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.470
In 2018, almost 2.8

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.000
million people flew in
and out of U.S.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.960
airports every day an almost
five percent increase from 2017.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.680
Those extra travelers have forced airlines
to rethink not only their

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.460
menus, but also the way
they deliver meals to passengers.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.260
With more people traveling than ever
before, how do airlines make

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.380
meals for thousands of people
and what are the costs?

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.240
Airlines in the U.S. started
flying in the early 1920's.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.010
At the time, airplane engines were
noisy and planes faced heavy winds

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.960
flying at low altitude.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.150
To provide comfort for weary
passengers airlines offered food.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.550
Some airlines had contracts with
local restaurants who supplied food

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.590
for flights on a regular basis.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.270
Others made stops mid-flight at restaurants
on the ground en route to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.650
their final destination.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.550
It was much more common to, for
example, fly from New York to Chicago

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.300
and land in the middle at a
small airport and make sure that the

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.090
small airport had some
kind of restaurant open.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.220
And so this is where
the passengers would be fed.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.720
In the 1930s, airline
meals started to evolve.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.770
In 1930, United Airlines
became the first U.S.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.830
carrier to enlist the
help of flight attendants.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.180
The stewardesses doubled as registered
nurses who passed out snacks

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.570
while also helping passengers
who became airsick.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.030
In 1936, United opened its
first flight kitchen in Oakland,

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.500
California, serving hot meals including
fried chicken and scrambled

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.100
eggs. But it was a slow service
because, in fact, a flight attendant

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.990
was there more as a nurse to help
you deal with your fright of being

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.630
in the air or not feeling well
after having eaten on the ground.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.900
The Boeing 247, unveiled in 1933, was
considered by many to be the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.940
first modern air passenger plane.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.310
The planes seated 10 passengers and had
a cruising speed of 155 miles

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.440
per hour. At the time, everyone
on the plane flew first class.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.640
The vast majority of passengers
were wealthy, male and mostly

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:23.900
business executives.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.250
Technical improvements during World War
II allowed airlines to fly

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.680
bigger planes longer distances.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.740
By the late 1940's, propeller planes flew
50 to 60 people at a time.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.470
You're not going to have a movie,
you're not going to have music, so

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.000
what are you going to do for these,
say, on average, 12 to 18 hours

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.700
that a transatlantic flight
is going to take?

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.950
Of course, the answer
is drink and food.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.350
For some, the 1950's and 60's were
seen as the Golden Age of air

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.270
travel. At the front of the
plane, airlines offered champagne and

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.380
lobster thermidor.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.610
Food was served on white
tablecloths and fine China.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.780
But for the masses, the introduction
of jet engines in the late

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.620
1950's launched the era
of the economy class.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.290
The 1950's announced
a class divide.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.600
This is when you
start seeing plastic wear.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.340
In the early 60's, airline catering
was still generally part of the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.780
airline operations.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.580
Airlines relied on local airport
restaurants or local airport hotels.

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.660
But with an increase in passengers,
carriers struggled to keep up

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.370
with demand. In the late 60's
and early 70's, more airlines either

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.540
started their own in-house catering
businesses or outsourced the work

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.240
to third-party private
catering companies.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.170
Historians say meals were
reportedly good but dry.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.820
Food was cooked on or near
the airport to preserve freshness and

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.030
avoid contamination.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:00.230
With the launch of the Boeing 747
in 1970, planes could now carry up

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.120
to 500 passengers forcing airlines and
flight attendants to feed even

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.260
more passengers.

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.050
The 1970's brought about other
sweeping changes for the airlines.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.640
Rising fuel costs from two separate
oil crises gave carriers eager to

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.940
cut costs an incentive to
trim their food budgets.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:25.550
And the Airline Deregulation Act of
1978 gave legacy carriers a new

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.130
competitor - low-cost airlines.

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:32.490
Budget airlines allowed travelers to buy
tickets for as little as $25

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.980
making passengers pay extra for
soft drinks and snacks.

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.080
Cost cutting continued into the
1980's when American Airlines CEO

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.550
Robert Crandall famously removed an olive
from every salad in first

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:51.360
class saving the carrier
$40,000 in 1987.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.080
It's in the details.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.230
Are you going to include three
cherry tomatoes in that salad that

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.840
you're serving to economy class or
can they do with two cherry

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.300
tomatoes? That's laughable from our
vantage point but when you're

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.840
trying to serve 400 passengers and
the big flying metal tube, that's

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.160
going to make a
difference for the accountants.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:10.570
In the early 2000's airline faced

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.750
falling profits following the 9/11
terrorist attacks and the SAR's

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.420
epidemic. From 2001 through 2005.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.450
U.S. carriers lost a record $60
billion, according to Airlines for

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.040
America, an industry, trade
and lobbying group.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.860
To save money many
airlines stopped serving meals.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.620
Airline meals had actually
gone out of fashion.

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.290
The airlines stopped serving them when
they were in these dire

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.430
financial straits after 9/11, there were
a series of bankruptcies and

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.610
then followed by a series of mergers
and airlines were looking to cut

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:44.930
costs wherever they could.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.240
But by 2019, U.S.

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.100
airlines posted their tenth
year of profitability.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:55.280
In order to compete for those
economy class passengers many airlines

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.080
brought the free meal back.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:03.800
One of the biggest challenges airline
chefs face is how do you

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.490
prepare hot meals for
thousands of people simultaneously?

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:09.830
The answer, it takes an army.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:14.990
Emirates flight catering located at Dubai
Airport makes an average of

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.800
225,000 meals a day
for over 500 flights.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.440
To get the job done it requires
a culinary team of more than 11,000

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.170
people, including 1,800 chefs.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.600
The facility operates 24 hours a
day, 365 days a year.

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.680
Darren Bott is Emirates Airline
vice president of catering.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:40.970
Emirates spends more than a billion
dollars a year around the world

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.430
on food and beverage,
a ccording to Bott.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.960
Because of the size and scope of
who we are, we're running in excess

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.730
of 7,000 menus a year.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:54.560
The whole exercise takes minimum of
12 months, really from start to

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:58.160
finish to to start from creating
new dishes in that concept

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:02.310
development facilitate to ultimately getting
those onboard in flight.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:06.770
Because Dubai is in the desert, almost
all the food used in the

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:08.360
kitchen has to be imported.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:13.760
Fruits and vegetables come from Europe,
berries from the US, beef and

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.830
lamb comes from Australia, and
poultry comes from South America.

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.570
Meal production starts roughly 48
hours prior to take off.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:27.010
In addition to a bakery, a butchery
and a vegetable prep area, the

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:31.780
facility also has a Japanese, an
Indian and a Middle Eastern kitchen.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.300
In 2018, Emirates Flight Catering
customers consumed 110 million

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:43.810
meals, including 1,400 tons of potatoes,
72 million bread rolls, 61

00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:47.530
tons of strawberries and
188 tons of salmon.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.420
Every raw materials principally imported, which
is a massive and very

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.630
complicated supply chain
and logistics challenge.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:00.700
Once meals are cooked, they are plated,
placed in a cart, put into

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.700
refrigerated vehicles and then
loaded onto the plane.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:09.850
A fully loaded A380 can hold anywhere
from 40 to 60 airline meal

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:13.000
carts weighing more than
nine metric tons.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.380
Airline catering is an almost $6
billion business in the U.S.,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.950
according to IBISWorld, a
market research firm.

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:29.360
While a few airlines like
United Airlines have some in-house

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.590
catering, most meals are provided
by third party airline catering

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.630
companies. In the U.S.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.850
LSG Sky Chefs, Gate Gourmet and Flying
Food Group are three of the

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:45.020
biggest operators and have kitchens on
or near airports around the

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.830
country. Together, they make up
nearly half of the U.S.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.260
airline catering market.

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:55.880
In 2019 L SG Sky Chefs
had estimated revenue in the U.S.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.130
of $1.6

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:03.360
billion, Gate Gourmet had estimated
revenue of $714 million and

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.850
Flying Food Group had estimated
revenue of $490 million dollars.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.660
They are all private but from what
the companies have revealed to the

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.430
public - In the U.S.,

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.570
LSG Sky Chefs had estimated
net income of $61.5

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:24.060
million in 2019, Gate Gourmet had
estimated net income of $61.2

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:30.050
million and Flying Food Group had
estimated operating income of $29.8

00:10:30.050 --> 00:10:31.550
million.

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.410
Airlines face a number of hurdles getting
hot meals to customers - no

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.040
open flames on a plane means
everything has to be reheated.

00:10:40.970 --> 00:10:42.140
Another big problem?

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.190
Your tastebuds are dulled at
high altitudes, meaning your perception

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.470
of saltiness and sweetness drops.

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:53.930
So, your plane food probably tastes
more bland than it actually is.

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.350
Let's look at how United
the sole major U.S.

00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.250
carrier to handle its catering
in-house designs its menus.

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:05.420
United distributes more than 50
million meals a year.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:09.830
Menu design can be anything from
redesigning the breakfast service to

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.280
redeveloping United's first class
Polaris dinner service.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.360
Gerry Gulli is one of
United Airlines two top chefs.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:22.220
He manages more than 2,500 catering
employees and works with a team

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.240
of design chefs from United and
chefs from their partners at Gate

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.790
Gourmet and LSG Sky Chefs.

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:33.020
Over the course of several days,
the chef's test different recipes

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:38.040
and tweak them. We test everything
and put it through how it's

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.990
actually going to be
handled on the plane.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:43.340
We just don't want to come up
with some great new fancy ideas.

00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:46.820
We just want to make sure that
the outcome is going to be executed

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:48.350
the way we want it
day in and day out.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.640
The team also takes into
account feedback from customers, flight

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.950
attendants and their
data analytics team.

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:58.430
Anything that happens on an
airplane can immediately become viral.

00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.640
You serve a bad meal and it's going
to be on Instagram, it's gonna be

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.300
on Twitter. So airlines sort of
don't want that embarrassing PR.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.450
Singapore Airlines produces about 40
million meals per year.

00:12:10.450 --> 00:12:15.290
To keep its offerings fresh the
carrier changes its menu weekly on

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:18.680
regional flights and monthly
on international flights.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.520
We rely on expertise of the local
caterers to advise us what fruit

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.030
and vegetables in season, what fish is
great this month and then we

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.650
map that out over the
course of the year.

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:32.360
Despite those efforts, airlines like
Singapore still face logistical

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:36.740
challenges. It can take up to seven
weeks to get some lettuce and

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:40.030
fruits into the kitchen
for Singapore Airlines.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:44.600
In 2019 the carrier expanded its
farm-to-plane initiative for one of

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.160
the world's longest flights.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:50.450
The 19-hour journey from Newark
to Singapore sources, leafy greens

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:55.010
and vegetables from Aerofarms, an indoor
vertical farm located in a

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:58.400
former warehouse near Newark
Airport in New Jersey.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.210
AeroFarms is a private
urban agricultural company.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:04.700
We grow without sun, without soil.

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:07.820
Instead of sun we use
LED's - light-emitting diode's.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:11.660
Instead of soil, we use a cloth
growth media that's made out of 100

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.070
percent recycled materials.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:17.750
A eroFarms claims it has over 300
times the productivity of a normal

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:20.210
farm because of the
fast crop cycles,

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:23.810
the fully-controlled environment and
the stacks of plants.

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:28.040
We harvest the vegetables and the leaf
green at eight o'clock in the

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.520
morning and those leaf greens on the
flight at eight o'clock the next

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:36.720
day. But while U.S.

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.980
airlines are making billions labor union
leaders say many of the

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.050
airline caterers in the U.S.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.670
who prepare first class meals for
American, Delta and United are

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:49.870
struggling to make ends meet.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:54.690
In November 2019 thousands of
airline catering workers demonstrated

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.190
at about 15 U.S.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:59.940
airports calling for better wages
and affordable health care,

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:04.620
according to Unite Here, a union
that represents 20,000 workers in

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.390
the airline catering industry.

00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:10.090
Airline catering kitchens
are factories.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.070
There's workers preparing
that food.

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:13.930
There's workers plating that food.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:16.570
There's workers loading that
up into that cart.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:20.440
More than half of the workers at
two of the nation's biggest airline

00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:26.050
catering companies, LSG Sky Chefs and
Gate Gourmet earn less than $15

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:29.310
an hour and struggle to pay
for their company's expensive health

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:31.760
care, according to Unite Here.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.730
And airlines aren't just
facing labor issues.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:39.250
With more people flying cabin waste has
also become a top concern for

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.450
airline execs.

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:45.400
It is estimated that the airline
industry produced almost 6 million

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:50.380
tons of cabin waste in 2017
costing the airlines almost a billion

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:53.170
dollars, according to the IATA.

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.860
Twenty percent of that waste was
made up of untouched food and

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:02.120
drinks. But despite these issues,
the in-flight catering business is

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.190
expected to grow at a rapid clip.

00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:10.820
T he global
airline catering business

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:13.540
could surge to more than $9.5

00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.260
billion by 2026, according to
a study by Fact.MR

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.930
a market research company. And with
the number of travelers expected

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:22.910
to double by 2037, premium and
economy cabins could see even more

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.740
food options in the future.
