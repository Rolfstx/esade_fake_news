00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:27.630
 please sit down. welcome everybody. for 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.310
 I have to apologize for dragging everyone here at such a rare moment. But as far as I know, this matter 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.699
 Need urgent treatment. In fact, if it is so urgent, it may be 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.449
 Solved a few weeks ago. But that was sprinkling milk under the bridge. 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:45.219
 So why didn't anyone tell me what they think? Just like me 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.110
 As mentioned earlier, Mr. Tuld, if you compare the numbers at the top of page 13... 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.449
 Jared, it's too early. Just talk to me in simple English. 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.520
 Ok. Actually, I want to 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.930
 Talk to those who put them together. Mr. Sullivan, is it? Does he speak English? 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.360
 Mr? I want to 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.049
 Talk to an analyst who stumbled upon this chaotic situation. 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.479
 of course. That is Peter Sullivan. Right here. 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:11.140
 Oh, Mr. Sullivan, you are here. Good morning. Maybe you can tell me 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:18.240
 Your thoughts. Also, please speak with young children or golden retrievers as much as possible. 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.380
 Not my brain attracted me. I can assure you. 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.150
 Sir, you may or may not know, 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.130
 Sir, here I am 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.750
 Mr. Rogers, a partner in the MBS Risk Assessment and Management Office, works. please. 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.900
 Relax. stand up. 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:47.590
 Tell us in a clear voice. What is the nature of the problem? 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.490
 Ok. As you know, in the past 36 to 40 months, the company has 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.920
 Start packaging new MBS products, these products will be several different grades 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.670
 The classifications are combined to form a tradable security. 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.990
 As I imagined, this is very profitable. 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.330
 I have got. The company is currently 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.640
 Every day is engaged in a lot of this business. 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.950
 Now the question, I think, why do we come here tonight, 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.480
 This is about a month for our company to get it right 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.569
 The placement of these products presents challenges from the perspective of risk management. 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.129
 And, Mr. Sullivan, what is the challenge? We must hold these assets on our books 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.110
 The time is longer than our ideal situation. Yes. 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.989
 But the key factor here is that these are essentially collateral. 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.879
 Therefore, this allows us to extend leverage far beyond 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.700
 What you may be willing or allowed to do in any other situation, 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.410
 Thereby promoting the risk situation without causing any danger signals. 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.999
 Now...thank you, Mr. Sullivan. sit down. I guess what your report is saying, then here 

00:02:55.999 --> 00:03:00.930
 give me some advice. I guess what it says is, consider 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.400
 Yes, it should be said that the rough road, we have been in the past week or so, 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.549
 Before that number of brilliant colleagues got online, you must come up with 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:16.219
 Without considering what is happening today, it will become more meaningful. Actually, no 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:18.400
 What happened today but 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.519
 What has happened in the past two weeks. So, you mean 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.730
 Has this happened? Kind of. Kind of. 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:34.140
 And, Mr. Sullivan, what does your model say, what does this mean for us here. 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.299
 Okay, that's where the projection becomes. but... 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.469
 You are talking to me, Mr. Sullivan. Ok sir 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:52.939
 If these assets are only reduced by 25% and stay on our account, 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:04:01.140
 Then the loss will be greater than the current market value of the entire company. 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:11.949
 So what you want to tell me is that the music is about to stop, we 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:16.430
 Will be left 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:29.400
 The biggest odorous excrement in the history of capitalism. Mr. Chairman, I am not sure I will say this. 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:36.560
 But let me clarify. Using your analogy, this model shows 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:43.220
 It’s music, so to speak, just slow down. As you said, if the music stops, then 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.530
 This model will not even approach that situation. 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:57.031
 The situation will be worse. Mr. Sullivan, let me tell you something. 

00:04:57.031 --> 00:05:01.620
 Do you want to know why I sit in this chair with everyone? 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:10.250
 I mean, why can I make big money? Yes. I am here for a reason, a reason. 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.950
 I guess music here 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:23.590
 From now on a week, a month, what might be done in a year. That's it. That's it. 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:34.560
 Standing here tonight, I am afraid I have heard nothing. 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:58.700
 Just silence. So now that we know that the music has stopped, 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:06.370
 What should we do? Mr. Cohen? Ms. Robertson? I'm afraid I think this is what you should 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:13.840
 Where to intervene. Lord knew that we had enough to rely on Mr. Sullivan tonight. 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:24.990
 What do you think of us? since 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.740
 What will I tell you from the first day you enter my office? There are three ways to make a living 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:36.680
 , First of all to become smarter, 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.040
 Now, I don't cheat. And, although I want to think that we 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.022
 There are some very smart people in this building, but make sure 

00:06:45.022 --> 00:06:58.771
 Being the first one is really easy. All sold. Nowadays. Sam, is that possible? Yes but 

00:06:58.771 --> 00:07:02.750
 How much does it cost? I want to pay. true? 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:10.360
 I agree. Where will this go back? everywhere. 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:19.639
 Sam, I don’t think you seem to understand what your boy is saying. 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:29.770
 If I did you, what would you do? 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.420
 You call traders to attend their normal 6.30 meeting because they will know 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.540
 The ending of these two ways. You will have to throw a bone at them, 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.110
 There is also a big bone. Then you have to 

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.040
 Out of the storm. 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.890
 There is no swap. It's nothing. 10.15 Complete 40%. By 11.00, all your transactions must be cancelled because 

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:50.900
 At lunchtime, everything will end. 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.170
 If you are lucky, by 2.00, you will sell for 65 cents. 

00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:58.000
 Then the Fed will be here, lifting your ass and trying to slow you down. 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.730
 Ramesh? They will slow you down. They cannot stop you. 

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.510
 sell to you. But John, even 

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:13.000
 We managed to do this, that is to say, the real question is, 

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.590
 Who do we sell this product to? We have been until recently 

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:20.500
 People who have been selling it for two years, and who else can buy it. 

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:28.270
 However, John, if you do this, you will stifle the market for many years. ended. 

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.540
 And you are selling something you know has no value. 

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:40.270
 We are selling to willing buyers at current fair market prices. So that we can survive. 

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:45.620
 You will never sell anything to anyone again. I know. 

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:50.120
 - you do? - you do? This is it! 

00:08:50.120 --> 00:09:00.249
 I tell you. This is it. Now it is 4.00 

00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:09.160
 Jared, you must decompose before 5:00 and make a plan. 

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:14.790
 Does anyone else know about this step by step? 

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:17.149
 Eric Dale. where is he? 

00:09:17.149 --> 00:09:25.160
 From today, he no longer works in the company. We have been trying to find him. 

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.110
 -Camello- yes 

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:46.959
 Call me Eric Dale before 6:30. carry out. We will meet here in an hour. Sam, let's talk.
