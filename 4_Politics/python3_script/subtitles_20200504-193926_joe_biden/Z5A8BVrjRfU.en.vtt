00:00:00.467 --> 00:00:02.736
[applause]

00:00:06.473 --> 00:00:08.475
MICHELLE NHUCH: I know
you're not clapping for me.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:15.215
But anyway, on behalf of the
MIT Center for International

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.817
Studies, I'm Michelle,
Director of Public Programs,

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:23.255
and would like to welcome you
to today's Starr Forum, which

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:27.693
I'm delighted to see that
everyone got the memo.

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:30.663
First, however, I'd like to
mention a few housekeeping

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:31.764
items.

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:33.900
We have several
upcoming events that we

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.534
hope you're able to attend.

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:37.870
The most recent one
will be on April 6th,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.306
with the former
Foreign Secretary

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.709
of the UK, Jack Straw.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.445
He will speak on Brexit,
Europe, and Trump.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:55.488
Yes, we've got a whole lot of
good events in store for us.

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:59.125
On April 11th, we have an
event on Digital Innovation

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:03.195
and Africa, which will explore
the consequences of Africa's

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.764
leap-frog into new technologies.

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:08.100
And on April 12th,
we have a book talk

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.736
with Ambassador Celso Amorim.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:14.207
He's Brazil's former Minister
of Foreign Relations.

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:18.477
His book is entitled Acting
Globally, Memoirs of Brazil's

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:20.813
Assertive Foreign Policy.

00:01:20.913 --> 00:01:23.115
Details for these
talks and others

00:01:23.215 --> 00:01:25.118
are available on our
website, or you can pick up

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.520
a flyer on your way out.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.790
Today's talk will conclude
with a Q&amp;A from the audience.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.992
For those asking
questions, we really

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:36.062
need you to line
up behind the mics.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.865
We also ask that you
are considerate of time

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:41.700
and of others who
want to ask questions,

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.104
because this is a question
and answer session, not

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:46.773
a personal statement session.

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:55.215
[applause]

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:03.022
Finally, it's truly an
honor to introduce a man who

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:04.891
needs no introduction.

00:02:04.991 --> 00:02:07.793
Please join me in
welcoming Noam Chomsky.

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:10.797
[applause]

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:28.480
NOAM CHOMSKY: First question,
as always, is can you hear me?

00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:30.616
Yeah, OK.

00:02:30.716 --> 00:02:34.220
For quite a few years,
I've been intrigued

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.223
by an interesting
debate that took place

00:02:37.323 --> 00:02:44.363
about 25 years ago between
two great scientists, Carl

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:47.500
Sagan, Ernst Mayr.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.670
They were discussing
the likelihood

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.343
of finding extraterrestrial
intelligent life.

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.612
And Sagan, who looked at
it from the point of view

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:04.717
of an astrophysicist,
calculated the number of planets

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:08.454
more or less like Earth and
concluded that the chances

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.522
are quite high.

00:03:10.622 --> 00:03:14.193
Mayr, looking at
it as a biologist,

00:03:14.293 --> 00:03:19.298
said, look, we have
only one test case,

00:03:19.398 --> 00:03:24.036
namely Earth, which has had
about 50 billion species.

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:28.540
And we can raise
the question what

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.845
are the criteria for
biological success

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:37.717
on Earth, with 50
billion cases to look at.

00:03:37.817 --> 00:03:42.321
And he pointed out that there
is a striking regularity.

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:47.493
The species that are successful,
a lot of them around,

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:53.032
basically, are those that
mutate quickly like bacteria,

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:56.969
or those that have a
fixed niche like beetles,

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.072
and they just stay there
no matter what happens.

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:04.110
And as you move up the scale
of what we call intelligence,

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.879
biological success declines.

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.048
So there are not many mammals.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:12.051
There are very few apes.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:13.752
The only reason
there's a lot of cows

00:04:13.852 --> 00:04:16.188
is because we domesticate them.

00:04:16.288 --> 00:04:19.892
But by and large,
biological success

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:23.929
declines as
intelligence increases.

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:28.834
Humans look like an exception,
but that's a statistical blip--

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:33.172
just a tiny moment of
evolutionary time--

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:36.408
last couple thousand
years, actually.

00:04:36.508 --> 00:04:40.078
So his conclusion is
that, I'll quote him,

00:04:40.179 --> 00:04:44.049
"The history of life on
Earth refutes the claim

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:48.587
that it is better to be
smart than to be stupid."

00:04:48.687 --> 00:04:50.790
What it shows, in fact,
is it's much better

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.126
to be stupid than smart.

00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:54.760
That's the conclusion.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.532
He also points out that the
average lifespan of a species

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.867
is about 100,000 years.

00:05:01.967 --> 00:05:03.969
We've doubled it.

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:06.205
We're about 200,000,
and so we're

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:10.309
a little beyond the
expected extinction point.

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:14.213
Well, that's the question
I want to consider today.

00:05:14.313 --> 00:05:17.583
Is it better to be
smart than stupid?

00:05:17.683 --> 00:05:22.287
It was addressed recently by
a very good Indian writer.

00:05:22.387 --> 00:05:27.326
Amitav Ghosh has a book called
The Great Derangement, Climate

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:30.330
Change and the Unthinkable.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.134
And in fact, our failure
to address the most awesome

00:05:35.234 --> 00:05:38.103
challenge of human history--

00:05:38.203 --> 00:05:41.107
with the possible exception
of nuclear weapons--

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:46.079
is indeed a true derangement,
and painful evidence

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:49.915
for the plausibility
of Mayr's thesis

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:53.385
that it's better to
be stupid than smart.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:57.156
Well, these are the two
existential challenges

00:05:57.256 --> 00:06:01.627
that overwhelm anything
else, completely overshadow

00:06:01.727 --> 00:06:03.562
all other discussions.

00:06:03.662 --> 00:06:06.365
And their severity
and their imminence

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:10.836
is illustrated graphically
by the famous Doomsday

00:06:10.937 --> 00:06:15.274
Clock of the Bulletin
of American Scientists.

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:21.214
It was initiated in 1947, right
at the dawn of the Nuclear Age.

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:28.687
In 2015, and again in 2016,
the hand was moved forward.

00:06:28.787 --> 00:06:30.957
Midnight means we're finished.

00:06:31.057 --> 00:06:35.261
The hand was moved forward
to three minutes to midnight.

00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:37.730
That's the closest it
had been to midnight

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.267
since the early 1980s, when
there was a major war scare

00:06:42.367 --> 00:06:45.037
in the early Reagan years.

00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:48.507
The reasons that they gave
were the mounting threat

00:06:48.607 --> 00:06:52.444
of nuclear war and the failure
to deal with climate change.

00:06:52.545 --> 00:06:55.247
I'll quote-- what they
said is, "At the time,

00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:59.918
the probability of global
catastrophe is very high,

00:07:00.018 --> 00:07:04.856
and the actions needed to
reduce the risks of disaster

00:07:04.956 --> 00:07:07.359
must be taken very soon."

00:07:07.459 --> 00:07:10.262
That was 2016.

00:07:10.362 --> 00:07:14.200
At the outset of the
Trump term, they found--

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.770
I'm quoting-- "the danger
to be even greater,

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.172
the need for action
more urgent."

00:07:20.272 --> 00:07:24.210
And they moved the clock to two
and a half minutes to midnight.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.777
The clock is ticking.

00:07:25.877 --> 00:07:27.947
Global danger looms.

00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:33.352
That's the closest to
terminal disaster since 1953,

00:07:33.452 --> 00:07:39.625
when the United States and
Russia exploded their H-bombs.

00:07:39.725 --> 00:07:42.961
There is an important
difference between these two

00:07:43.061 --> 00:07:45.297
existential threats.

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:50.803
If by some miracle, we
escape nuclear disaster--

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:54.607
and anyone who looks
at the shocking record

00:07:54.707 --> 00:07:58.810
will realize that it's a miracle
that we've gotten this far--

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:02.848
but if by some miracle,
we do escape, at least

00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:06.619
we know in principle
how to end the plague,

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:09.155
get rid of the scourge.

00:08:09.255 --> 00:08:10.956
Global warming is different.

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:12.858
It's inexorable.

00:08:12.958 --> 00:08:15.995
We might pass a point
of no return, when

00:08:16.095 --> 00:08:18.464
the damage that
we've done is simply

00:08:18.564 --> 00:08:20.699
uncontrollable, irreversible.

00:08:20.799 --> 00:08:23.702
And it might not be far off.

00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:30.275
The human species is, right
now, undertaking an experiment

00:08:30.375 --> 00:08:34.446
to determine the answer
to Ernst Mayr's question,

00:08:34.546 --> 00:08:37.917
is it better to be
smart than stupid?

00:08:38.017 --> 00:08:42.021
And what I'd like to
do now is to examine

00:08:42.121 --> 00:08:47.393
the course of the experiment,
just by picking a few dates.

00:08:47.493 --> 00:08:50.495
So let's start with today--

00:08:50.596 --> 00:08:53.465
could be any day, but
we'll start with today.

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:57.236
If you looked at this
morning's newspapers,

00:08:57.336 --> 00:09:01.506
you see a report on how
we're dealing with the two

00:09:01.606 --> 00:09:04.075
existential crises.

00:09:04.176 --> 00:09:07.946
One on the nuclear
threat, Christopher Ford,

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:12.285
the National Security Council
Senior Director for Weapons

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.220
of Mass Destruction and
Counter-proliferation under

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.490
the Trump Administration--

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:22.794
he advises that we should
reconsider the unrealistic goal

00:09:22.894 --> 00:09:25.764
of a world without
nuclear weapons that

00:09:25.864 --> 00:09:30.069
has been advocated, among
others, by extremist

00:09:30.169 --> 00:09:35.107
peaceniks like Henry
Kissinger, George Shultz, Sam

00:09:35.207 --> 00:09:38.177
Nunn, and William Perry.

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:41.947
And the reason for abandoning
this unrealistic goal

00:09:42.047 --> 00:09:47.319
of these utopians is Russia's
increased aggressiveness,

00:09:47.419 --> 00:09:49.788
which is, incidentally,
a charge that's

00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:52.525
dismantled quite effectively
in the current issue

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:56.795
of a radical rag that's
worth reading now and then,

00:09:56.895 --> 00:10:01.133
Foreign Affairs, the main
establishment journal.

00:10:01.233 --> 00:10:05.871
On global warming today, this
morning, the National Snow

00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:10.208
and Ice Data Center
reports that the Arctic

00:10:10.308 --> 00:10:16.148
has less sea ice at winters
end now than ever before.

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:20.886
That means more dark ocean,
hence more absorption

00:10:20.986 --> 00:10:22.721
of solar energy, more warming.

00:10:22.821 --> 00:10:25.123
And we're in a feedback loop.

00:10:25.223 --> 00:10:27.225
You know what that means.

00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:30.963
The mean temperature
for November

00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:33.865
was 23 degrees above normal.

00:10:33.965 --> 00:10:36.569
And at some points in the
last couple of months,

00:10:36.669 --> 00:10:40.939
it went to more than 35
degrees warmer than normal.

00:10:41.039 --> 00:10:44.176
That's today's good news.

00:10:44.276 --> 00:10:49.180
Let's go back to yesterday,
quote from The Washington Post.

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:51.416
Water temperatures at
the surface of the Gulf

00:10:51.516 --> 00:10:56.454
of Mexico and near south
Florida are on fire.

00:10:56.554 --> 00:11:01.960
They spurred a historically warm
winter from Houston to Miami.

00:11:02.061 --> 00:11:05.197
In the Gulf, the average
sea surface temperature

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:09.467
never fell below 73 degrees over
the winter for the first time

00:11:09.568 --> 00:11:10.836
on record.

00:11:10.936 --> 00:11:16.275
Galveston, Texas has tied or
broken an astonishing 33 record

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:20.846
highs since November 1st,
while neighboring Houston had

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:23.081
its warmest winter on record.

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:26.151
Both cities have witnessed
precious few days

00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:34.026
with below normal temperatures
since late fall, and on and on.

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:36.862
I apologize if this
is unfair, but I

00:11:36.962 --> 00:11:41.433
can't refrain from quoting
one of the comments

00:11:41.533 --> 00:11:44.636
by a reader on this news report.

00:11:44.736 --> 00:11:48.641
He says, "The Republicans
have all this under control.

00:11:48.741 --> 00:11:53.145
The plan is to have Jeff
Sessions and Ted Cruz's dad

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:56.414
stand at the shoreline
with Bibles in hand.

00:11:56.514 --> 00:12:00.852
As the sky darkens
and the water rises,

00:12:00.952 --> 00:12:04.289
they will raise their left
hand, holding the Bible,

00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:07.425
and command the seas to settle.

00:12:07.526 --> 00:12:12.364
And if that fails, Plan
B is to run like hell,

00:12:12.464 --> 00:12:13.265
and to blame Obama."

00:12:16.569 --> 00:12:20.773
[applause]

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:21.873
Couldn't say it better.

00:12:21.973 --> 00:12:23.209
It's a classic.

00:12:23.309 --> 00:12:28.013
And it captures the spirit
of the times very accurately.

00:12:28.113 --> 00:12:30.815
There was a second
report yesterday

00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:34.320
in the business press,
Bloomberg Businessweek.

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.789
The headline was, "The
Oil Boom is Back."

00:12:37.889 --> 00:12:39.190
And I'll quote it.

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.928
"The number of oil and gas rigs
drilling in the United States

00:12:43.028 --> 00:12:45.864
has almost doubled
since bottoming out

00:12:45.964 --> 00:12:50.936
at the lowest level in more
than 75 years of records.

00:12:51.036 --> 00:12:53.973
While two dozen nations
are coordinating

00:12:54.073 --> 00:12:59.344
to cut oil production and rein
in the global supply glut,

00:12:59.444 --> 00:13:02.881
US producers are moving
in the opposite direction.

00:13:02.981 --> 00:13:05.317
Over the last four
months, output

00:13:05.417 --> 00:13:09.188
increased by half a
million barrels a day.

00:13:09.288 --> 00:13:12.424
And if that rate of
expansion continues,

00:13:12.524 --> 00:13:17.228
the shale boom will break new
production records by summer.

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:22.101
The US now produces 9
million barrels a day.

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:25.771
We are way in the lead.

00:13:25.871 --> 00:13:31.477
This illustrates a very crucial
fact of current history.

00:13:31.577 --> 00:13:36.481
The world outside the United
States is taking steps--

00:13:36.581 --> 00:13:39.318
halting steps, but steps--

00:13:39.418 --> 00:13:45.290
towards facing the existential
challenge to survival.

00:13:45.391 --> 00:13:48.693
Meanwhile, the United
States, virtually alone,

00:13:48.793 --> 00:13:54.499
is racing towards destruction
with enthusiasm and dedication,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.536
which is quite a
remarkable fact.

00:13:57.636 --> 00:13:59.304
Now of course, the
oil industry has

00:13:59.404 --> 00:14:02.074
plenty of help in
helping and moving

00:14:02.174 --> 00:14:07.045
as quickly as it can to
destroy chances for survival.

00:14:07.145 --> 00:14:12.817
The IMF reports that the
fossil fuel industry extracts

00:14:12.918 --> 00:14:17.590
a $700 billion annual
taxpayer subsidy, which

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.326
is not in the crosshairs
of Mike Mulvaney, I'm sure.

00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:24.129
And the industry
doesn't take chances.

00:14:24.229 --> 00:14:30.803
In 2016, it spent $117 million
in campaign contributions

00:14:30.903 --> 00:14:35.306
while fielding 720
lobbyists in Washington

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:38.577
to make sure that
Congress gets the message.

00:14:38.677 --> 00:14:40.479
And apparently it does.

00:14:40.579 --> 00:14:42.814
There's a recent
Washington Post article

00:14:42.915 --> 00:14:46.484
which reports that many
Republicans in Congress

00:14:46.584 --> 00:14:50.889
do recognize the severe
threat of climate change.

00:14:50.989 --> 00:14:54.793
But they won't talk about it
because of funding pressures

00:14:54.893 --> 00:14:57.129
from the fossil fuel industry.

00:14:57.229 --> 00:15:02.233
That's particularly true
since Citizens United opened

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:05.637
the floodgates even
wider for a flood

00:15:05.737 --> 00:15:08.306
of corporate political
funding, which

00:15:08.406 --> 00:15:11.610
means you toe the corporate
line or you're out.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:13.945
Well, that's yesterday.

00:15:14.045 --> 00:15:18.817
These reports are quite
typical of the daily fare.

00:15:18.917 --> 00:15:23.088
Pick almost any day,
you find similar things.

00:15:23.188 --> 00:15:26.158
Let's continue to
review the experiment

00:15:26.258 --> 00:15:28.160
that humans are undertaking.

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:33.031
I'll just pick a few recent
dates from the last few months.

00:15:33.131 --> 00:15:35.401
So start with November 8th.

00:15:35.501 --> 00:15:39.471
That was an important day in
history for several reasons.

00:15:39.571 --> 00:15:43.041
Several events took
place on November 8th.

00:15:43.141 --> 00:15:46.245
One of them was very important.

00:15:46.345 --> 00:15:49.314
Second one was
extremely important,

00:15:49.414 --> 00:15:52.817
and the third was
absolutely astonishing.

00:15:52.917 --> 00:15:57.922
The very important one was the
election in the United States.

00:15:58.022 --> 00:16:01.126
Plenty of coverage of that, so
I don't have to talk about it.

00:16:01.226 --> 00:16:05.797
The extremely important
one took place in Morocco.

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:11.603
In Morocco on November
8th, about 200 countries

00:16:11.703 --> 00:16:17.609
were gathering in what's
called COP22, the International

00:16:17.709 --> 00:16:22.781
Conference under
UN auspices, to try

00:16:22.881 --> 00:16:25.050
to deal with the problem
of global warming.

00:16:27.919 --> 00:16:31.390
The goal of the conference
was to put some teeth

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:36.961
into the Paris negotiations
the year before, COP21,

00:16:37.061 --> 00:16:39.131
December 2015.

00:16:39.231 --> 00:16:43.802
That conference had aimed to
establish a verifiable treaty.

00:16:43.902 --> 00:16:46.871
But it couldn't do
it for one reason--

00:16:46.971 --> 00:16:48.440
the Republican
Congress would not

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.176
accept any binding commitments.

00:16:51.276 --> 00:16:55.247
So therefore, the world had
to settle for something less,

00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:57.683
namely informal agreements.

00:16:57.783 --> 00:17:00.986
And COP22 in
Marrakesh, Morocco was

00:17:01.086 --> 00:17:03.588
supposed to carry this forward.

00:17:03.689 --> 00:17:06.858
Well, on November 8th,
the conference began.

00:17:06.958 --> 00:17:10.796
On November 8th, the World
Meteorological Association

00:17:10.896 --> 00:17:13.798
delivered a report
which, in their words,

00:17:13.898 --> 00:17:18.603
confirms that 2016 was the
warmest year on record--

00:17:18.703 --> 00:17:21.907
a remarkable 1.1
degrees Centigrade

00:17:22.007 --> 00:17:25.310
above the pre-industrial
period, sharply

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.047
above the previous record
set the year before,

00:17:29.148 --> 00:17:32.617
and in fact approaching
the desired limit that

00:17:32.717 --> 00:17:37.589
was set in Paris as the goal,
and other dire reports which

00:17:37.689 --> 00:17:38.890
I won't read.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:41.026
But you can pick them up on
the internet, if you want.

00:17:41.126 --> 00:17:44.128
That was the World
Meteorological Association.

00:17:44.229 --> 00:17:47.399
But then the deliberations
essentially ended.

00:17:47.499 --> 00:17:51.036
The election results came
in from the United States.

00:17:51.136 --> 00:17:53.972
The conference
essentially stopped--

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:55.240
nothing more to discuss.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:57.543
The only question
was whether it would

00:17:57.643 --> 00:18:02.681
be possible to salvage
anything from the wreckage,

00:18:02.781 --> 00:18:05.317
with the world's most
important country--

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:10.655
the richest, most powerful
country in world history--

00:18:10.755 --> 00:18:13.425
having all three
branches of government

00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:16.394
committed to racing
to destruction.

00:18:16.494 --> 00:18:18.130
What could be done?

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:19.664
And there was some hope.

00:18:19.764 --> 00:18:24.369
They looked at one country as
the possible savior, namely

00:18:24.469 --> 00:18:25.837
China.

00:18:25.937 --> 00:18:29.707
That was November 8th, the
extremely important event

00:18:29.807 --> 00:18:31.176
on November 8th.

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:34.913
The conference went on, but
concluded without issue.

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:39.317
Well, the third event was
absolutely astonishing,

00:18:39.417 --> 00:18:42.187
namely, the leader
of the free world

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:44.890
is leading the
world to disaster.

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:48.360
The world is looking
to China to save it.

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:50.228
And what's the reaction?

00:18:50.328 --> 00:18:53.598
Silence-- not a word about it.

00:18:53.698 --> 00:18:56.568
Pick up the newspapers
on November 9th,

00:18:56.668 --> 00:19:02.140
listen to BBC on November 9th
and the days that followed,

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.075
and you'll see
nothing about this.

00:19:04.175 --> 00:19:07.312
Here's one of the most
astounding events in history--

00:19:07.412 --> 00:19:11.149
the world's most powerful
country, most powerful country

00:19:11.249 --> 00:19:13.886
in history,
extraordinary advantages,

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:18.157
incomparable, racing to
lead the world to disaster,

00:19:18.257 --> 00:19:21.126
and the world is hoping
that maybe China can somehow

00:19:21.226 --> 00:19:22.760
save us.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.697
Can you think of an events
like that in history?

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.765
Not a word about it.

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:32.003
That's the astonishing
fact of November 8th.

00:19:32.103 --> 00:19:33.838
That's November 8th.

00:19:33.938 --> 00:19:38.877
Let's move forward to March
1st, talk about both the world

00:19:38.977 --> 00:19:40.745
and the United States.

00:19:40.845 --> 00:19:42.981
In the world, a
study was released

00:19:43.081 --> 00:19:47.118
showing that tens of thousands
of miles of permafrost

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:51.222
in Northwest Canada are
rapidly melting, along

00:19:51.322 --> 00:19:56.127
with accelerating decline of
permafrost in Alaska, Siberia,

00:19:56.227 --> 00:19:57.729
and Scandinavia.

00:19:57.829 --> 00:19:59.364
And it pointed out
that this could

00:19:59.464 --> 00:20:04.469
lead to massive, huge
release of greenhouse gases--

00:20:04.569 --> 00:20:08.206
CO2 and methane-- which
is accelerated, of course,

00:20:08.306 --> 00:20:11.476
by the unprecedented
Arctic heatwave

00:20:11.576 --> 00:20:14.713
which gets radically
worse every year.

00:20:14.813 --> 00:20:16.381
That's the world.

00:20:16.481 --> 00:20:21.052
In the United States, the Trump
administration, on March 1st,

00:20:21.152 --> 00:20:23.555
decided to help
the process along

00:20:23.655 --> 00:20:27.092
by rescinding the so-called
Methane Rule which

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:32.430
limits release of methane from
oil and gas drilling sites

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:34.065
on federal lands.

00:20:34.166 --> 00:20:37.835
So that's a way of
accelerating the oil boom,

00:20:37.935 --> 00:20:42.340
and increasing the flow of
methane into the atmosphere.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.577
Methane is a far more
dangerous than CO2,

00:20:45.677 --> 00:20:48.346
even though it's short lived.

00:20:48.446 --> 00:20:50.616
There was also, on
March 1st, announcements

00:20:50.716 --> 00:20:54.786
of sharp cuts in the
Environmental Protection Agency

00:20:54.886 --> 00:20:59.224
staff and programs, and also
an edict banning research.

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:01.726
We don't want to learn
about these things.

00:21:01.826 --> 00:21:03.561
That was March 1st.

00:21:03.661 --> 00:21:06.764
Let's turn to March 16th.

00:21:06.864 --> 00:21:11.202
The world-- a new study
was released on the damage

00:21:11.302 --> 00:21:15.740
to the Great Barrier Reef, one
of the world's greatest living

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.612
structures, which is damage
that's quite intensifying.

00:21:20.712 --> 00:21:22.914
And the report said
that it's by far

00:21:23.014 --> 00:21:27.819
the most widespread and damaging
of recent mass bleaching

00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:34.359
of coral reefs since 1998, with
wide-ranging disastrous effects

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.260
that most of you know about.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.262
Well, that was the world.

00:21:38.362 --> 00:21:43.268
The United States on March 16th,
the Trump budget was released.

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:47.405
Environmental Protection
Agency is virtually dismantled.

00:21:47.505 --> 00:21:52.176
It's now pretty much
run by Senator Inhofe

00:21:52.276 --> 00:21:54.212
and his associates.

00:21:54.312 --> 00:21:57.883
Inhofe, for years, has been
the leading climate change

00:21:57.983 --> 00:21:59.784
denier in the Senate.

00:21:59.884 --> 00:22:02.320
He is an extreme fundamentalist.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:08.926
And his position is that if God
is warming the Earth, so be it.

00:22:09.026 --> 00:22:12.764
It would be sacrilegious to
interfere with God's will.

00:22:12.864 --> 00:22:15.299
That's the view in
the most powerful,

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:19.437
advanced, sophisticated
country in the world.

00:22:19.537 --> 00:22:21.406
And that's the least of it.

00:22:21.506 --> 00:22:24.309
For action and
research on climate,

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:27.211
the EPA is actually
a small actor.

00:22:27.311 --> 00:22:31.249
Far more important is
the Department of Energy.

00:22:31.349 --> 00:22:34.318
It's now in the
hands of a guy who

00:22:34.419 --> 00:22:36.421
had decided to get rid
of it a couple of years

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:40.258
ago, before he learned that
it controls nuclear weapons.

00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:44.462
So we'd better keep
it, but not entirely.

00:22:44.563 --> 00:22:48.400
The Office of Science,
according to the budget,

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.535
in the Department of
Energy, is scheduled

00:22:50.635 --> 00:22:53.271
to lose $900 million dollars.

00:22:53.371 --> 00:22:56.174
That's nearly 20% of its budget.

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:59.944
Its $300 million
ARPA energy program

00:23:00.044 --> 00:23:02.547
is eliminated completely.

00:23:02.647 --> 00:23:07.819
That's along with deep cuts in
research programs at the EPA

00:23:07.919 --> 00:23:12.223
and the NOAA, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric

00:23:12.323 --> 00:23:16.795
Administration, and also a 5%
cut to NASA's earth science

00:23:16.895 --> 00:23:18.429
budget.

00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:23.801
The budget generally
is of unusual savagery,

00:23:23.901 --> 00:23:29.040
even for the Paul Ryan wing of
the Republican establishment,

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:31.542
which is effectively
running the show now

00:23:31.642 --> 00:23:37.649
behind the Trump/Spicer/Twitter
facade that's designed to grab

00:23:37.749 --> 00:23:40.184
the headlines every day.

00:23:40.284 --> 00:23:43.255
The budget, if you look
at it, is a vicious attack

00:23:43.355 --> 00:23:45.490
on the working
class and the poor,

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.226
and lavishes even more
gifts on the wealthy

00:23:49.326 --> 00:23:50.895
and the corporate sector.

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:54.666
And along with a process
which can only describe,

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:58.703
I think, as the
talibanization of America

00:23:58.803 --> 00:24:03.341
in accord with the Bannon,
Sessions DeVos ideal

00:24:03.441 --> 00:24:06.811
of a society which
they've described based

00:24:06.911 --> 00:24:11.349
on Judeo-Christian tradition
of white supremacy,

00:24:11.449 --> 00:24:15.686
destruction of the humanities,
arts, public schooling,

00:24:15.786 --> 00:24:18.557
and on the side,
medical research.

00:24:18.657 --> 00:24:20.358
That's the goal
towards which we're

00:24:20.459 --> 00:24:24.695
aiming at home while we
race towards destruction

00:24:24.795 --> 00:24:27.065
internationally.

00:24:27.165 --> 00:24:30.968
Practically every issue
of science journals

00:24:31.068 --> 00:24:34.372
provides more grim forecasts.

00:24:34.472 --> 00:24:36.841
Those of you who read
the science journals

00:24:36.941 --> 00:24:39.043
regularly are
familiar with this.

00:24:39.144 --> 00:24:42.881
So one recent paper in
Atmospheric Chemistry

00:24:42.981 --> 00:24:48.219
and Physics by James Hansen
and 18 other scientists

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:52.223
carries out a comparison
between today's climate

00:24:52.323 --> 00:24:56.294
and the climate of
120,000 years ago, which

00:24:56.394 --> 00:25:00.598
had approximately the same
temperatures or slightly

00:25:00.698 --> 00:25:03.000
warmer temperatures than today.

00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.904
That led, 120,000 years
ago, to a sea level

00:25:07.004 --> 00:25:13.644
rise of 20 to 30 feet, when much
of the polar ice disintegrated.

00:25:13.745 --> 00:25:17.916
The paper predicts in
the near future killer

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:21.653
storms stronger than
any in modern times,

00:25:21.753 --> 00:25:25.356
disintegration of large
parts of the polar ice sheets

00:25:25.456 --> 00:25:28.493
leading to melting
of huge glaciers.

00:25:28.593 --> 00:25:33.097
That's taking place rapidly,
especially in the Antarctic,

00:25:33.197 --> 00:25:34.999
where it's the most dangerous.

00:25:35.099 --> 00:25:38.370
And they predict a rise
of sea sufficient to begin

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.839
drowning the world's
coastal cities

00:25:41.939 --> 00:25:44.175
before the end of the century.

00:25:44.275 --> 00:25:47.945
Hansen says we're in danger
of handing young people

00:25:48.045 --> 00:25:52.383
a situation that's out of their
control, with precipitous rises

00:25:52.483 --> 00:25:56.087
in sea level not too
far down the road,

00:25:56.187 --> 00:25:58.723
other dire consequences.

00:25:58.823 --> 00:26:01.759
There are other studies that
indicate that climate change is

00:26:01.859 --> 00:26:06.397
occurring faster than at
any time over the last 100

00:26:06.498 --> 00:26:10.568
million years, by some
estimates far faster.

00:26:10.668 --> 00:26:15.172
Last year, as you probably
know, atmospheric CO2

00:26:15.272 --> 00:26:20.611
passed the symbolic level of
400 particles per million.

00:26:20.711 --> 00:26:23.481
That's considered a
crucial danger point.

00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:26.083
That's the first time
in four million years,

00:26:26.183 --> 00:26:29.554
and possibly irreversible.

00:26:29.654 --> 00:26:34.058
That's only a small sample
of many such reports.

00:26:34.158 --> 00:26:38.195
They're constantly in the
major science journals,

00:26:38.296 --> 00:26:40.698
sometimes making
it to the media.

00:26:40.798 --> 00:26:44.602
Meanwhile, the Republican
wrecking machine

00:26:44.702 --> 00:26:49.941
is systematically dismantling
the institutions that offer

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:53.378
some hope for decent survival.

00:26:53.478 --> 00:26:55.313
And it's not just Trump.

00:26:55.413 --> 00:26:59.184
It's the whole Republican
Party leadership

00:26:59.284 --> 00:27:03.455
at the national level, also
much of the local level.

00:27:03.555 --> 00:27:06.657
And so in North Carolina, for
example, a couple of years

00:27:06.758 --> 00:27:09.427
ago, there was a
scientific study

00:27:09.527 --> 00:27:13.097
commissioned by the Coastal
Resources Commission.

00:27:13.197 --> 00:27:17.868
And it estimated that the sea
level will rise by 39 inches

00:27:17.968 --> 00:27:20.204
by the end of the century.

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:23.675
There was a response by
the Republican-run state

00:27:23.775 --> 00:27:25.076
legislature.

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:29.446
They passed a law that barred
state and local agencies

00:27:29.546 --> 00:27:34.152
from developing regulations or
planning documents anticipating

00:27:34.252 --> 00:27:36.120
a rise in sea level--

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:38.189
rational reaction.

00:27:38.289 --> 00:27:42.326
There was a pretty good comment
on it by Stephen Colbert.

00:27:42.426 --> 00:27:45.463
He said, this is a
brilliant solution.

00:27:45.563 --> 00:27:48.399
If your science gives you
a result you don't like,

00:27:48.499 --> 00:27:51.302
pass a law saying the
result is illegal--

00:27:51.402 --> 00:27:53.438
problem solved.

00:27:53.538 --> 00:27:59.077
That captures quite well the
mentality of the Republican

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:01.079
Party leadership.

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:06.117
A few years ago, Bobby Jindal,
the Republican governor

00:28:06.217 --> 00:28:09.988
who succeeded in
sinking Louisiana

00:28:10.088 --> 00:28:12.289
even deeper into the abyss.

00:28:12.389 --> 00:28:16.027
He warned Republicans that
they are becoming what

00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:18.696
he called "the stupid party."

00:28:18.796 --> 00:28:23.802
The respected conservative
political analyst Thomas Mann

00:28:23.902 --> 00:28:28.206
and Norman Ornstein of the
right-wing American Enterprise

00:28:28.306 --> 00:28:29.407
Institute--

00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:33.144
they describe the party
or maybe the former party

00:28:33.244 --> 00:28:36.748
as a radical insurgency
that has abandoned

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:39.150
parliamentary democracy.

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:42.186
Perhaps a simpler
characterization

00:28:42.286 --> 00:28:46.724
is the utterly outrageous
charge that they

00:28:46.824 --> 00:28:50.528
are the most dangerous
organization in human history,

00:28:50.628 --> 00:28:54.198
dedicated to the prospect
to ending the prospects

00:28:54.298 --> 00:28:56.267
for human survival.

00:28:56.367 --> 00:29:00.404
That is outrageous, no doubt,
but the more interesting

00:29:00.504 --> 00:29:02.340
question is whether it's wrong.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.943
I leave that to
you to think about.

00:29:06.043 --> 00:29:13.984
I already mentioned Paris
2015, COP21, Marrakesh 2016.

00:29:14.084 --> 00:29:17.488
Those are two crucial examples.

00:29:17.588 --> 00:29:22.927
The 2016 primary campaign
was quite remarkable

00:29:23.027 --> 00:29:29.133
in many respects, primarily
those that weren't discussed,

00:29:29.233 --> 00:29:32.737
namely the attitude
of the candidates

00:29:32.837 --> 00:29:37.175
to climate change, which barely
got a word of commentary.

00:29:37.275 --> 00:29:41.779
Every single candidate
denied that what is happening

00:29:41.879 --> 00:29:47.251
is happening, with the exception
of the sensible moderates

00:29:47.351 --> 00:29:50.988
like Jeb Bush, who
said it's uncertain,

00:29:51.088 --> 00:29:53.057
but we don't have
to do anything,

00:29:53.157 --> 00:29:57.261
because we're producing more
natural gas thanks to fracking,

00:29:57.361 --> 00:30:00.431
or John Kasich, who
was supposed to be

00:30:00.531 --> 00:30:03.134
the adult in the
room, who did at least

00:30:03.234 --> 00:30:07.171
agree that global warming
is probably happening.

00:30:07.271 --> 00:30:08.939
He's Governor of Ohio.

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:12.143
He said, we're going
to burn coal in Ohio,

00:30:12.243 --> 00:30:14.545
and we're not going
to apologize for it.

00:30:14.645 --> 00:30:17.448
That's the sensible guy.

00:30:17.548 --> 00:30:21.118
As far as the media were
concerned, they ignored it.

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:24.255
There was almost nothing
mentioned about this.

00:30:24.355 --> 00:30:27.458
After all, it's only
the most important issue

00:30:27.558 --> 00:30:29.327
in human history.

00:30:29.427 --> 00:30:31.696
And you can't really
blame the media

00:30:31.796 --> 00:30:33.931
for this, because
they're following

00:30:34.031 --> 00:30:39.470
a concept of objectivity that's
taught in journalism schools.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:44.275
Objectivity means
reporting accurately

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:49.414
what's going on within the
Beltway in Washington circles.

00:30:49.514 --> 00:30:53.183
So you got to report accurately
what they're saying there.

00:30:53.283 --> 00:30:55.186
If you talk about
something else,

00:30:55.286 --> 00:30:59.023
it's bias or opinion
or something.

00:30:59.123 --> 00:31:01.425
But it's not genuine reporting.

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:04.328
So since what's going
on within the Beltway--

00:31:04.428 --> 00:31:06.597
including the Democrats,
incidentally--

00:31:06.697 --> 00:31:13.036
is denial or ignoring, or in
the case of the Republicans,

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:16.040
flatly denying what's
happening is happening,

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.609
then you don't report
it, because it's not

00:31:18.709 --> 00:31:19.443
within the Beltway.

00:31:19.543 --> 00:31:21.111
It's not objective.

00:31:21.211 --> 00:31:24.382
Well, even a sea
level rise that's

00:31:24.482 --> 00:31:27.518
much more limited than
what's anticipated

00:31:27.618 --> 00:31:30.287
is going to inundate
coastal cities,

00:31:30.387 --> 00:31:33.524
and more significantly,
coastal plains

00:31:33.624 --> 00:31:38.595
like in Bangladesh, where there
will soon be tens of millions

00:31:38.695 --> 00:31:43.367
of people fleeing, probably
in the fairly near future.

00:31:43.467 --> 00:31:47.071
These are flat plains which are
going to be inundated, and many

00:31:47.171 --> 00:31:48.539
more later.

00:31:48.639 --> 00:31:53.577
That's going to make today's
refugee issue a tea party.

00:31:53.678 --> 00:31:57.581
The chief environmental
scientist in Bangladesh

00:31:57.682 --> 00:32:00.651
says that these migrants
should have the right

00:32:00.751 --> 00:32:04.455
to move to the countries from
which all these greenhouse

00:32:04.555 --> 00:32:07.124
gases are coming.

00:32:07.224 --> 00:32:11.629
Millions should be able to
go to the United States.

00:32:11.729 --> 00:32:15.266
That just fits the current
mood in what has long

00:32:15.366 --> 00:32:19.203
been the richest and safest
country in the world,

00:32:19.303 --> 00:32:22.973
and also the most terrified.

00:32:23.073 --> 00:32:25.009
And those who think
it's better in Europe

00:32:25.109 --> 00:32:27.945
can turn to a
recent poll showing

00:32:28.045 --> 00:32:33.217
that a majority of Europeans
want a total ban on immigration

00:32:33.317 --> 00:32:36.353
from Muslim-majority countries.

00:32:36.453 --> 00:32:39.657
So the idea is first,
we destroy them.

00:32:39.757 --> 00:32:44.561
Then, we punish them for
trying to escape from the ruins

00:32:44.661 --> 00:32:46.063
that we've created.

00:32:46.163 --> 00:32:47.632
And we have a name for it.

00:32:47.732 --> 00:32:50.300
We call it a refugee crisis.

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:54.004
Well, thousands of
people, desperate people,

00:32:54.104 --> 00:32:56.407
drowned in the
Mediterranean fleeing

00:32:56.507 --> 00:33:00.511
from Africa, where Europe has
a certain history with which

00:33:00.611 --> 00:33:03.347
you're not unfamiliar.

00:33:03.447 --> 00:33:06.784
The same is true of the United
States and Central America,

00:33:06.884 --> 00:33:09.687
of course, and the Middle East.

00:33:09.787 --> 00:33:13.224
And in fact, the
so-called refugee crisis

00:33:13.324 --> 00:33:18.963
is actually a serious, severe
moral and cultural crisis

00:33:19.063 --> 00:33:20.798
in the West.

00:33:20.898 --> 00:33:26.270
Well, these two existential
crises are related.

00:33:26.370 --> 00:33:29.173
The Himalayan
glaciers are melting.

00:33:29.273 --> 00:33:32.609
And in the
not-too-distant future,

00:33:32.709 --> 00:33:35.847
that could threaten
the water supplies

00:33:35.947 --> 00:33:41.018
in South Asia, which are already
at dangerously low levels.

00:33:41.118 --> 00:33:43.788
So 300 million
people in India are

00:33:43.888 --> 00:33:48.526
reported to lack adequate
drinking water right now.

00:33:48.626 --> 00:33:52.296
That could very
easily spark conflict

00:33:52.396 --> 00:33:58.669
between India and Pakistan,
two nuclear-armed states

00:33:58.769 --> 00:34:02.774
constantly at the
brink of nuclear war.

00:34:02.874 --> 00:34:05.343
Right now, in
fact, a nuclear war

00:34:05.443 --> 00:34:08.112
would destroy
India and Pakistan,

00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:10.715
but much worse than that,
could very well lead

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:14.385
to nuclear winter, meaning
global famine, which

00:34:14.485 --> 00:34:19.156
pretty much ends organized
human life on Earth,

00:34:19.256 --> 00:34:22.259
which is not very removed,
if you think it through.

00:34:22.359 --> 00:34:25.596
Well, that leads us
to one final date

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:28.532
to look at, one of the
most important dates

00:34:28.633 --> 00:34:33.037
of human history, namely
the end of World War II.

00:34:33.137 --> 00:34:37.774
It was a moment of joy,
but also of horror,

00:34:37.875 --> 00:34:40.644
with the dawn of
the Nuclear Age.

00:34:40.744 --> 00:34:46.417
I can remember very well my
own feelings on August 6--

00:34:46.517 --> 00:34:51.222
horror at the events and
their constant implications,

00:34:51.322 --> 00:34:55.192
their import, and astonishment
that so few people seemed

00:34:55.292 --> 00:34:58.796
to care about it, either about
the enormity of what had just

00:34:58.896 --> 00:35:04.568
happened, or about the fact
that we had entered into what

00:35:04.668 --> 00:35:09.407
will be the final era
of human existence,

00:35:09.507 --> 00:35:13.845
the Nuclear Age, the moment
when human intelligence had

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:18.348
succeeded in developing the
means to instantaneously

00:35:18.448 --> 00:35:20.451
destroy us all.

00:35:20.551 --> 00:35:26.757
1947, shortly after, the
Doomsday Clock was instituted.

00:35:26.857 --> 00:35:30.727
And the hand was set then at
seven minutes to midnight.

00:35:30.827 --> 00:35:34.232
We're now, remember,
at two and a half.

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:39.804
Well, we have not only entered
the Nuclear Age, but also

00:35:39.904 --> 00:35:45.175
the so-called Anthropocene,
a new geological epoch

00:35:45.275 --> 00:35:49.146
in which human activity
is dramatically

00:35:49.246 --> 00:35:52.115
changing the environment.

00:35:52.216 --> 00:35:55.786
There have been debates
about the proper date

00:35:55.886 --> 00:35:58.722
for the inception
of the Anthropocene,

00:35:58.822 --> 00:36:03.527
but the World Geological
Society has made its decision.

00:36:03.627 --> 00:36:08.698
It settled on 1950 as the
beginning of the Anthropocene.

00:36:08.799 --> 00:36:11.601
That's partly because
of radioactive elements

00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:14.438
that were dispersed
across the planet

00:36:14.538 --> 00:36:18.108
by the nuclear bomb tests
and other consequences

00:36:18.208 --> 00:36:22.979
of human action, including the
sharp increase in greenhouse

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.114
emissions.

00:36:24.214 --> 00:36:27.150
So the Nuclear Age
and the Anthropocene

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:29.253
basically coincide.

00:36:29.353 --> 00:36:34.825
These are epics of the
post-world War II period.

00:36:34.925 --> 00:36:39.697
We are also now well into what's
called the sixth extinction.

00:36:39.797 --> 00:36:42.966
It's expected to be similar
to the fifth extinction that

00:36:43.066 --> 00:36:48.239
was 66 million years ago,
when a huge asteroid hit

00:36:48.339 --> 00:36:52.810
the Earth, destroyed
75% of species,

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:55.646
ended age of the dinosaurs.

00:36:55.746 --> 00:36:58.849
It opened a way
for small mammals

00:36:58.949 --> 00:37:03.888
to survive, and to expand, and
evolve, and ultimately become

00:37:03.988 --> 00:37:07.524
us about 200,000 years ago.

00:37:07.624 --> 00:37:12.396
For a long time, humans
had fairly limited impact.

00:37:12.496 --> 00:37:15.900
But by now, in the
post-war period,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.836
we've succeeded in
becoming the next asteroid,

00:37:19.936 --> 00:37:23.740
destroying species
at an enormous rate,

00:37:23.841 --> 00:37:27.511
perhaps ourselves not
too far in the distance.

00:37:27.611 --> 00:37:31.048
There are careful studies
of species extinction,

00:37:31.148 --> 00:37:32.849
and they have some
interesting results.

00:37:32.949 --> 00:37:35.920
They show that
this extinction is

00:37:36.020 --> 00:37:40.457
different from its predecessors
in an interesting respect.

00:37:40.557 --> 00:37:43.961
The earlier ones
were species-neutral.

00:37:44.061 --> 00:37:46.831
Species just disappeared
across the board.

00:37:46.931 --> 00:37:48.498
This one is different.

00:37:48.598 --> 00:37:51.968
It's mostly larger animals
that are disappearing

00:37:52.068 --> 00:37:53.771
disproportionately.

00:37:53.871 --> 00:37:57.808
And that actually runs through
the history of proto-humans,

00:37:57.908 --> 00:38:01.111
our human ancestors,
early human ancestors,

00:38:01.211 --> 00:38:03.580
back around a million years.

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:06.684
As they expanded
their territory,

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:09.252
large mammals declined.

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:14.024
And of the many species
closely related to us,

00:38:14.125 --> 00:38:18.929
only one survives, which
raises some questions

00:38:19.029 --> 00:38:21.165
that you might ponder.

00:38:21.265 --> 00:38:26.637
And that includes the
lingering question Ernst Mayr--

00:38:26.737 --> 00:38:29.373
is it better to be
smart than stupid?

00:38:29.473 --> 00:38:32.742
Now, we have a few years
to answer this question--

00:38:32.843 --> 00:38:33.844
not many.

00:38:33.944 --> 00:38:35.713
So how are we answering it?

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:39.616
Well, one step was George
W Bush's abrogation

00:38:39.717 --> 00:38:46.556
of the ABM Treaty
followed now under Obama--

00:38:46.656 --> 00:38:48.291
Bush and now Obama--

00:38:48.391 --> 00:38:54.665
followed by ABM installations
right near the Russian border,

00:38:54.765 --> 00:38:59.769
allegedly for defense against
non-existent Iranian nuclear

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.072
missiles.

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:04.775
You can believe that if you
believe the tooth fairy,

00:39:04.875 --> 00:39:06.844
which Russia doesn't.

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:11.281
They have good reason to regard
it as a first-strike weapon.

00:39:11.382 --> 00:39:14.484
Strategic analysts
understand missile defense

00:39:14.584 --> 00:39:17.554
to be on all sides.

00:39:17.654 --> 00:39:22.559
The next step was offering
NATO membership to Ukraine.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:26.864
Ukraine is the Russian
geostrategic heartland.

00:39:26.964 --> 00:39:28.665
That was George
Bush, but the efforts

00:39:28.765 --> 00:39:32.536
have been pursued by
Obama and Clinton.

00:39:32.636 --> 00:39:36.640
The Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty

00:39:36.741 --> 00:39:40.143
would at least end
nuclear tests, which would

00:39:40.243 --> 00:39:42.580
be a considerable step forward.

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.982
But it can't go into
force until it's

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:48.252
ratified by the few holdouts.

00:39:48.352 --> 00:39:53.256
Three are crucial-- the nuclear
weapon states that refuse

00:39:53.356 --> 00:39:54.925
to ratify it--

00:39:55.025 --> 00:39:58.596
China, Israel, and
the United States.

00:39:58.696 --> 00:40:02.432
The major nuclear
powers, US and Russia,

00:40:02.532 --> 00:40:04.634
which have overwhelming
preponderance

00:40:04.734 --> 00:40:08.405
of nuclear weapons, are both
expanding and modernizing

00:40:08.505 --> 00:40:11.275
their arsenals in
quite dangerous ways.

00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:14.077
That includes
tactical nukes that

00:40:14.177 --> 00:40:17.614
can be scaled down
to battlefield use

00:40:17.714 --> 00:40:22.786
under low-level
command, could easily

00:40:22.886 --> 00:40:26.323
lead to a very rapid escalation
if there were any conflict.

00:40:26.423 --> 00:40:29.393
And any conflict between
Russia and the United States

00:40:29.493 --> 00:40:32.296
is essentially
terminal for everyone.

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.564
That's pretty obvious.

00:40:34.664 --> 00:40:39.002
The flashpoints are
becoming more serious.

00:40:39.102 --> 00:40:41.005
Right at the Russian border--

00:40:41.105 --> 00:40:44.841
notice, the Russian border,
not the Mexican border--

00:40:44.941 --> 00:40:47.911
that's a fact worth considering.

00:40:48.011 --> 00:40:52.416
And it's a result
of expansion of NATO

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:55.686
right after the collapse
of the Soviet Union.

00:40:55.786 --> 00:40:59.890
This was in violation
to verbal promises

00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.327
to Mikhail Gorbachev,
verbal promises

00:41:03.427 --> 00:41:06.196
that NATO would not expand.

00:41:06.296 --> 00:41:08.899
The phrase was "one
inch to the east."

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:10.367
That meant East Germany.

00:41:10.467 --> 00:41:13.370
Nobody was thinking
about anything beyond--

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:17.374
that NATO would not expand
one inch to the east

00:41:17.475 --> 00:41:22.246
if Gorbachev agreed to
unification of Germany.

00:41:22.346 --> 00:41:26.883
And a unified
Germany joining NATO,

00:41:26.983 --> 00:41:31.888
a hostile military alliance, is
a pretty remarkable concession

00:41:31.988 --> 00:41:36.159
in the light of the history
of the past half century, when

00:41:36.259 --> 00:41:40.931
Germany alone had practically
wiped Russia out two times.

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:44.701
Well, that was the
agreement, but verbal.

00:41:44.801 --> 00:41:49.172
NATO at once expanded
to East Germany,

00:41:49.272 --> 00:41:53.577
then beyond under Clinton,
right to the Russian border.

00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:59.350
There is recent archival
work by a University of Texas

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.618
young historian,
Joshua Schifrinson,

00:42:01.718 --> 00:42:05.055
that was published in the MIT
journal International Security,

00:42:05.155 --> 00:42:06.890
worth looking up.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:11.495
He very strongly suggests
that President Bush--

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:14.497
number one, the statesman Bush--

00:42:14.597 --> 00:42:17.500
and Secretary of
State James Baker,

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.269
who were the negotiators--

00:42:19.369 --> 00:42:22.338
strongly suggests they
were consciously deceiving

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:25.776
Gorbachev, pretending to
make an agreement which

00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:28.545
they intended to violate,
and were very careful not

00:42:28.645 --> 00:42:30.213
to put anything on paper.

00:42:30.313 --> 00:42:32.516
So when Gorbachev
complained, he was

00:42:32.616 --> 00:42:35.218
told it was just a
gentleman's agreement.

00:42:35.319 --> 00:42:38.855
And the unstated
implication was,

00:42:38.955 --> 00:42:42.459
if you're stupid
enough to believe

00:42:42.559 --> 00:42:44.094
in a gentleman's
agreement with us,

00:42:44.194 --> 00:42:46.463
it's your problem, not ours.

00:42:46.563 --> 00:42:49.466
Well, Gorbachev did
propose a vision

00:42:49.566 --> 00:42:54.538
of what he called a common
European home, Brussels

00:42:54.638 --> 00:42:59.943
to Vladivostok, security system
with no military alliances.

00:43:00.043 --> 00:43:02.946
That's a fading dream.

00:43:03.046 --> 00:43:06.649
George Kennan and
other senior statesmen

00:43:06.750 --> 00:43:11.488
had warned right away
that NATO expansion is

00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:14.691
what they called "a
tragic mistake, policy

00:43:14.791 --> 00:43:16.860
error of historic proportions."

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.395
That's Kennan.

00:43:18.495 --> 00:43:23.466
And it's now leading to
rising and serious tensions

00:43:23.566 --> 00:43:28.405
on the traditional invasion
route through which Russia

00:43:28.505 --> 00:43:33.176
was virtually destroyed
twice during the past century

00:43:33.276 --> 00:43:35.712
by Germany alone.

00:43:35.812 --> 00:43:40.150
The risk of terminal
nuclear war is not slight.

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:42.085
And that's one of
the two reasons

00:43:42.185 --> 00:43:45.689
why the hand of
the Doomsday Clock

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:49.627
is moving so close to midnight.

00:43:49.727 --> 00:43:55.198
With some justice, European
historian Richard Sakwa

00:43:55.298 --> 00:43:58.802
writes that NATO's
prime concern now

00:43:58.902 --> 00:44:03.640
is to manage the risks created
by its existence, which

00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.042
is quite accurate, I think.

00:44:06.142 --> 00:44:11.315
And it bears on Ernst
Mayr's conclusions.

00:44:11.415 --> 00:44:14.818
That's how we're dealing
with one of the two crises.

00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:16.186
What are the others?

00:44:16.286 --> 00:44:17.587
How about global warming?

00:44:17.687 --> 00:44:19.689
Well, we're answering
Mayr's question

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:24.728
by unilateral withdrawal
from the world's efforts

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:27.063
to address the crisis--

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:30.967
not just withdrawal, but
replacing their efforts

00:44:31.067 --> 00:44:34.371
with a dedicated
race to the precipice

00:44:34.471 --> 00:44:39.943
even more rapidly, by sharp
increases in fossil fuel use--

00:44:40.043 --> 00:44:44.314
that includes coal-- and
refusing the promised subsidies

00:44:44.414 --> 00:44:48.218
to poorer countries to
develop renewable energy,

00:44:48.318 --> 00:44:52.356
and dismantling the
regulatory apparatus

00:44:52.456 --> 00:44:57.594
so that profits can boom,
along with threats to survival.

00:44:57.694 --> 00:45:02.899
And we can't stress too strongly
the enormity of the fact

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.003
that the United States
is alone in the world

00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:09.540
in this respect
since November 8th,

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:14.044
and the no less astonishing
fact that this extraordinary

00:45:14.144 --> 00:45:19.416
development barely registers
in the so-called information

00:45:19.516 --> 00:45:20.484
system.

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:24.020
Should have regular
screaming headlines,

00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.456
and be the most
prominent issue in

00:45:26.556 --> 00:45:29.626
the academic and
intellectual world, which

00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:34.264
is more evidence about
the great derangement.

00:45:34.364 --> 00:45:39.169
And no less astonishing
is the fact that,

00:45:39.269 --> 00:45:42.005
while the richest
and most powerful

00:45:42.105 --> 00:45:47.043
country in world history,
with incomparable advantages,

00:45:47.143 --> 00:45:52.916
is leading the effort to
intensify the likely disaster--

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:57.120
while that's happening, efforts
to avert the catastrophe

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:03.727
are being led worldwide by what
we call primitive societies--

00:46:03.827 --> 00:46:09.132
the First Nations in Canada,
tribal and aboriginal societies

00:46:09.233 --> 00:46:10.367
elsewhere.

00:46:10.467 --> 00:46:13.703
So for example, Ecuador,
which has a large indigenous

00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:18.208
population sought aid
from European countries,

00:46:18.308 --> 00:46:23.113
rich European countries to allow
it to keep its oil reserves

00:46:23.213 --> 00:46:25.915
underground where
they ought to be,

00:46:26.015 --> 00:46:30.653
even at a cost of
considerable profit.

00:46:30.753 --> 00:46:33.724
The aid was refused.

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:38.428
Ecuador revised its
constitution in 2008

00:46:38.528 --> 00:46:41.465
to include what are called
the "rights of nature

00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:43.733
having intrinsic worth."

00:46:43.833 --> 00:46:47.471
Same in Bolivia with
an indigenous majority.

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:50.006
And quite generally,
the countries

00:46:50.106 --> 00:46:53.443
with large and
influential indigenous

00:46:53.543 --> 00:46:56.880
populations are well
in the lead in seeking

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.383
to preserve the planet.

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.751
While the countries
that have driven

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:05.756
indigenous populations
to extinction or extreme

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:10.494
marginalization are racing
towards destruction,

00:47:10.594 --> 00:47:14.664
which is perhaps something
more to think about.

00:47:14.764 --> 00:47:20.036
Outside of the world center of
devastation and destruction,

00:47:20.136 --> 00:47:24.541
which is right here, some
things are being done--

00:47:24.641 --> 00:47:28.111
not enough by any means,
but not negligible,

00:47:28.211 --> 00:47:31.448
and an indication
of what can be done.

00:47:31.548 --> 00:47:36.853
So Denmark is aiming to reach
100% renewable electricity

00:47:36.953 --> 00:47:42.091
within 20 years, and
in all sectors by 2050.

00:47:42.191 --> 00:47:46.162
Germany, which is the most
successful state capitalist

00:47:46.262 --> 00:47:50.900
economy, has tripled renewable
energy for electricity

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.971
in the past decade, aims to
increase it by almost half

00:47:55.071 --> 00:48:01.444
by 2025, more than 80% by
2050, and by then, to have

00:48:01.545 --> 00:48:07.350
reduced greenhouse gas
reductions to 80% or 90%

00:48:07.450 --> 00:48:09.653
of 1990 levels.

00:48:09.753 --> 00:48:12.456
China, which is still
a huge polluter,

00:48:12.556 --> 00:48:17.093
is well in the lead in
production of solar panels,

00:48:17.193 --> 00:48:21.064
and also development of
advanced solar technology.

00:48:21.164 --> 00:48:25.034
It claims to be phasing
out coal plants.

00:48:25.134 --> 00:48:28.604
In the United States,
Hawaii passed a law

00:48:28.705 --> 00:48:31.808
mandating that all the
state's electricity will

00:48:31.908 --> 00:48:37.013
come from renewable
sources no later than 2045.

00:48:37.114 --> 00:48:40.817
And right here, several
Massachusetts Democrats

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:45.855
have filed a bill that's SD
1932 if you want to look it up,

00:48:45.955 --> 00:48:49.960
which requires that the
state use a 100% renewable

00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.964
energy by 2035, and
mandates elimination

00:48:55.064 --> 00:48:59.302
of all fossil fuels
in the state by 2050--

00:48:59.402 --> 00:49:01.971
so 100% renewables.

00:49:02.072 --> 00:49:06.075
San Diego is the
first large city

00:49:06.176 --> 00:49:12.181
to have a plan to run on
100% renewable energy,

00:49:12.281 --> 00:49:17.787
and cut greenhouse gas
emissions in half by 2035.

00:49:17.887 --> 00:49:20.223
And that's, incidentally,
a bipartisan effort.

00:49:20.323 --> 00:49:25.795
The Republican Mayor endorsed
the climate action plan

00:49:25.895 --> 00:49:30.099
that was unanimously approved
by the Democrat-controlled city

00:49:30.199 --> 00:49:32.001
council in December.

00:49:32.101 --> 00:49:35.105
That's San Diego.

00:49:35.205 --> 00:49:38.909
And in fact, at a period
when the federal government

00:49:39.009 --> 00:49:43.079
is in the hands of
bulls in the china shop,

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:47.150
states and cities can
still do quite a lot.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:52.021
And the federal government could
also do so, in the right hands.

00:49:52.121 --> 00:49:54.858
So one of Hillary
Clinton's programs

00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:59.229
was to shift all households
to total renewable

00:49:59.329 --> 00:50:01.064
energy in four years.

00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:04.267
It's quite feasible--
would create

00:50:04.367 --> 00:50:07.537
many jobs, along
with weatherization

00:50:07.637 --> 00:50:10.740
and other forms of conservation.

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:13.376
And federal regulations
in recent years

00:50:13.477 --> 00:50:17.747
have had some positive
effects, unfortunately,

00:50:17.847 --> 00:50:23.219
counterbalanced by support for
greater fossil fuel production.

00:50:23.319 --> 00:50:26.723
There's a final assessment
by the Obama administration

00:50:26.823 --> 00:50:29.025
that was published in
Science, the journal

00:50:29.125 --> 00:50:31.460
Science a couple of months ago.

00:50:31.561 --> 00:50:38.435
It reports that in 2015,
total energy consumption

00:50:38.535 --> 00:50:43.606
was 2.5% lower than
it was in 2008,

00:50:43.706 --> 00:50:47.277
while the economy grew by 10%.

00:50:47.377 --> 00:50:50.080
Now the reduction is
by no means enough,

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:55.619
but it does remind us that
growth is not, in itself,

00:50:55.719 --> 00:50:57.520
a menace to the environment.

00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:00.590
It depends on what
kind of growth.

00:51:00.690 --> 00:51:06.029
So for example, development of
a rational mass transportation

00:51:06.129 --> 00:51:09.932
system, or development
of renewable energy,

00:51:10.032 --> 00:51:15.238
or growth in education and R&amp;D--

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:16.372
that's growth.

00:51:16.473 --> 00:51:20.443
And it can all improve
prospects for addressing

00:51:20.543 --> 00:51:25.415
the crises, while also
significantly improving lives.

00:51:25.515 --> 00:51:29.686
The Obama assessment reports
that about 2.2 million

00:51:29.786 --> 00:51:34.357
Americans are employed in
the design, installation,

00:51:34.457 --> 00:51:38.394
manufacture of energy efficiency
products and services,

00:51:38.494 --> 00:51:42.064
as compared with half
that number employed

00:51:42.164 --> 00:51:44.433
in the production
of fossil fuels

00:51:44.534 --> 00:51:48.138
and their use for
electric power generation.

00:51:48.238 --> 00:51:51.708
And the current oil boom,
which I mentioned earlier,

00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:56.613
creates almost no jobs, because
it's almost all automated.

00:51:56.713 --> 00:52:01.117
Again, it's nowhere near
enough, but not insignificant,

00:52:01.217 --> 00:52:05.321
and more important, an
indication of what can be done.

00:52:05.421 --> 00:52:08.157
And there's good
reason to think it can.

00:52:08.257 --> 00:52:12.395
Harvey Michaels is Research
Director of Energy Management

00:52:12.495 --> 00:52:15.599
at Sloan School here.

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:18.735
He's shown, I
think persuasively,

00:52:18.835 --> 00:52:24.974
how ambitious but feasible
measures beyond those now

00:52:25.074 --> 00:52:29.279
contemplated internationally--
that's internationally apart

00:52:29.379 --> 00:52:31.915
from the Republican US--

00:52:32.015 --> 00:52:34.450
such measures
could meet the goal

00:52:34.550 --> 00:52:39.088
of keeping global temperatures
below 2 degrees Centigrade.

00:52:39.188 --> 00:52:41.925
That's considered the
major danger point.

00:52:44.627 --> 00:52:48.565
Ernie Moniz, now back at
MIT, has produced figures

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:53.670
about declining costs for
clean energy technologies

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:55.805
that lead him to
conclude, I'll quote him,

00:52:55.905 --> 00:53:00.610
that "Climate change may have
inspired the energy revolution,

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:05.882
but price makes it Inevitable,"
and maybe even in time,

00:53:05.982 --> 00:53:08.618
at least with enough effort.

00:53:08.718 --> 00:53:12.054
Replacing fossil fuels
by renewable energy

00:53:12.154 --> 00:53:13.389
is the major issue.

00:53:13.489 --> 00:53:15.525
But it's not the only one.

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:19.596
The UN Economic
Program summarizing

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:23.833
recent scientific studies
estimates that industrial meat

00:53:23.933 --> 00:53:28.838
production contributes
about 10% to 25%

00:53:28.938 --> 00:53:32.074
of total greenhouse
gas emissions--

00:53:32.174 --> 00:53:37.981
not so much CO2 as methane and
nitric oxide, both greenhouse

00:53:38.081 --> 00:53:39.382
gases.

00:53:39.482 --> 00:53:41.817
The variation in the
estimates depends on

00:53:41.917 --> 00:53:46.489
whether the figures take
into account deforestation

00:53:46.589 --> 00:53:51.694
and other land use changes
associated with livestock.

00:53:51.794 --> 00:53:56.332
Livestock is about 80% of
agricultural emissions.

00:53:56.432 --> 00:54:00.803
This is mostly industrial
meat production, which

00:54:00.903 --> 00:54:03.372
is quite vicious, as you know.

00:54:03.473 --> 00:54:05.808
It's designed to
maximize profit,

00:54:05.908 --> 00:54:10.080
with animals treated
as efficient production

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.149
elements-- awful
effects on animals,

00:54:13.249 --> 00:54:18.655
but also a significant increase
in greenhouse gas emissions.

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:21.491
Actually, pre-capitalist
animal agriculture

00:54:21.591 --> 00:54:24.560
didn't have those problems.

00:54:24.660 --> 00:54:29.165
Quote from the UN report,
"Under natural conditions,

00:54:29.266 --> 00:54:31.734
which were maintained
for thousands of years

00:54:31.834 --> 00:54:34.737
and still widely exist
around the world,

00:54:34.837 --> 00:54:37.707
there is a closed
circular system,

00:54:37.807 --> 00:54:40.377
in which some animals
feed themselves

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:44.246
from landscape types which
would otherwise be of little use

00:54:44.347 --> 00:54:45.548
to humans.

00:54:45.648 --> 00:54:49.385
They thus convert energy
stored in plants into food,

00:54:49.486 --> 00:54:52.288
while at the same time
fertilizing the ground

00:54:52.388 --> 00:54:53.889
with their excrements.

00:54:53.989 --> 00:54:58.127
Although not an intensive form
of production, this coexistence

00:54:58.227 --> 00:55:01.864
and use of marginal
resources was, and still

00:55:01.964 --> 00:55:05.468
is in some regions,
an efficient symbiosis

00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:09.539
between plant life and
animal life and human needs."

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:13.676
But the capitalist industrial
production and profit

00:55:13.776 --> 00:55:17.414
maximization has
changed all that.

00:55:17.514 --> 00:55:21.217
I mentioned that with the
federal government now turned

00:55:21.317 --> 00:55:26.722
into a wrecking machine, states
and cities can do quite a lot.

00:55:26.822 --> 00:55:30.159
And that same is true
for every one of us.

00:55:30.259 --> 00:55:34.864
There are major issues of
education and organizing

00:55:34.964 --> 00:55:36.832
that have to be faced.

00:55:36.933 --> 00:55:40.303
And again, some of these
are unique to the United

00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:43.139
States in the developed world.

00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:47.443
One of them is the extraordinary
power in the United States

00:55:47.543 --> 00:55:50.513
of fundamentalist
religious doctrines.

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:54.517
So about 40% of the
population dismiss

00:55:54.617 --> 00:55:59.021
the threat of global warming
on religious grounds.

00:55:59.121 --> 00:56:03.125
They regard it as either
certain or highly probable

00:56:03.226 --> 00:56:06.228
that within a few
decades, the Second Coming

00:56:06.328 --> 00:56:09.199
will put an end to the problem.

00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:12.701
Well it's important to
remember in this connection

00:56:12.801 --> 00:56:17.373
that the United States is a
kind of a cultural outlier

00:56:17.473 --> 00:56:19.375
in some respects.

00:56:19.475 --> 00:56:23.212
Prior to the Second World
War, the United States

00:56:23.312 --> 00:56:26.215
was by far the most
powerful economy,

00:56:26.315 --> 00:56:32.422
but it was not a major center of
scientific or general culture.

00:56:32.522 --> 00:56:35.491
So if you wanted to be a
physicist, you'd go to Germany.

00:56:35.591 --> 00:56:37.861
If you wanted to be
a writer and artists,

00:56:37.961 --> 00:56:40.029
go to Paris, and so on.

00:56:40.129 --> 00:56:44.100
I had personal experience
with the residue of this when

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.470
I was appointed to MIT in 1955.

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:49.872
One of the teaching
assignments was

00:56:49.972 --> 00:56:55.411
to help scientists and engineers
fake their way through reading

00:56:55.511 --> 00:56:58.014
exams in French and German.

00:56:58.114 --> 00:57:01.451
That was a residue of the
fact that before the war,

00:57:01.551 --> 00:57:04.854
that's where the
scientific literature was.

00:57:04.954 --> 00:57:07.490
It took a while for
this to be phased out.

00:57:07.590 --> 00:57:10.493
By that time, it was
almost all in English.

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:14.063
But by 1950s, it
was an anachronism.

00:57:14.163 --> 00:57:16.832
The changes are very
real, but they've affected

00:57:16.932 --> 00:57:18.168
only part of the country.

00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:25.274
Much of the population
is still pretty much

00:57:25.374 --> 00:57:28.044
where it was pre-World War II.

00:57:28.144 --> 00:57:31.580
And that's a major task
for the educational system.

00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.449
And the prospects
right now, at least,

00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:40.023
don't look good, not with
the DeVos, Sessions, Bannon

00:57:40.123 --> 00:57:42.758
conception of education.

00:57:42.858 --> 00:57:46.262
The Trump administration
has to do something

00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:51.234
for its huge evangelical
popular base.

00:57:51.334 --> 00:57:54.737
That involves driving the
United States even farther

00:57:54.837 --> 00:57:58.107
off the spectrum
of the modern world

00:57:58.207 --> 00:58:03.546
with the talibanisation
project that's now under way.

00:58:03.646 --> 00:58:06.115
There are major
challenges, no doubt.

00:58:06.215 --> 00:58:08.817
There are also quite
a few rays of hope.

00:58:08.917 --> 00:58:10.986
I mentioned some of
the measures that

00:58:11.087 --> 00:58:14.457
are being taken by
state, local governments,

00:58:14.557 --> 00:58:17.560
even national governments
around the world

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:20.162
to address the crises--

00:58:20.262 --> 00:58:25.134
not enough, but not negligible,
indication of what's possible.

00:58:25.234 --> 00:58:28.137
And there are other
reasons for optimism.

00:58:28.237 --> 00:58:31.207
One of them has just
been reported by,

00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:33.809
of all places, Fox News.

00:58:33.909 --> 00:58:38.614
They ran a poll on popularity
of political figures.

00:58:38.714 --> 00:58:44.553
And in first place, by a huge
margin, was Bernie Sanders--

00:58:44.653 --> 00:58:49.125
even more among the young, who
are the hope of the future.

00:58:49.225 --> 00:58:53.029
There are ample opportunities,
but you have to grasp them.

00:58:53.129 --> 00:58:57.667
And all of this takes us back
to Ernst Mayr's question,

00:58:57.767 --> 00:59:00.903
is it better to be
smart than stupid?

00:59:01.004 --> 00:59:04.440
It's a question for you
to ponder, and like it

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:09.245
or not, for you to answer, and
without too much of a delay.

00:59:09.345 --> 00:59:10.245
Thanks.

00:59:10.346 --> 00:59:13.216
[applause]

00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:50.286
MICHELLE NHUCH: [inaudible]
mics for your questions.

00:59:56.125 --> 00:59:57.059
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:59:57.159 --> 00:59:59.895
Thank you very much,
Professor Chomsky.

00:59:59.995 --> 01:00:03.632
With all these sort
of existential crises,

01:00:03.732 --> 01:00:07.603
if you were to put
yourself in the body

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:11.774
of a 20-something-year-old
growing up today,

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:15.444
how would that shape your
life decisions with these two

01:00:15.544 --> 01:00:16.445
crises?

01:00:16.545 --> 01:00:17.513
NOAM CHOMSKY: If I
was 20 years old?

01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:18.948
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:19.048 --> 01:00:20.349
NOAM CHOMSKY:
Pretty much the way

01:00:20.449 --> 01:00:27.356
I did when I was, what
was it, 16 years old

01:00:27.456 --> 01:00:31.593
on August 6th, 1945.

01:00:31.693 --> 01:00:35.164
I happened to be a junior
counselor in a summer camp.

01:00:35.264 --> 01:00:39.101
And the news was reported
in the morning, broadcast

01:00:39.201 --> 01:00:40.502
to everyone--

01:00:40.602 --> 01:00:44.406
atomic bomb wiped out Hiroshima.

01:00:44.506 --> 01:00:47.409
Everyone went on to
their next activity--

01:00:47.509 --> 01:00:51.447
a baseball game or
whatever it was.

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:52.581
I didn't know how to react.

01:00:52.681 --> 01:00:55.518
I just left, and went
off into the woods,

01:00:55.618 --> 01:00:57.553
sat there for a
couple hours thinking,

01:00:57.653 --> 01:00:59.388
what does all this mean?

01:00:59.488 --> 01:01:02.224
And afterwards I
decided, look, you just

01:01:02.324 --> 01:01:04.393
have to devote
your life to this.

01:01:04.493 --> 01:01:08.230
And I think that we're
in a worse situation now.

01:01:08.330 --> 01:01:10.265
And there's plenty
that can be done.

01:01:10.365 --> 01:01:11.834
The opportunities
are far greater

01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:14.203
now than they were
in the past, thanks

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:19.041
to what's been done by people
like you in earlier years,

01:01:19.141 --> 01:01:21.276
like MIT, say.

01:01:21.376 --> 01:01:25.681
You could never get an audience
like this 20 or 30 years ago.

01:01:25.781 --> 01:01:30.653
In fact, in the 1960s, MIT was
a very conservative campus.

01:01:30.753 --> 01:01:33.923
Almost nothing was going on.

01:01:34.023 --> 01:01:36.825
About a dozen
undergraduates just

01:01:36.925 --> 01:01:39.662
changed the place
enormously, and it's

01:01:39.762 --> 01:01:41.797
been very different ever since.

01:01:41.897 --> 01:01:44.266
And that's happened
all around the country,

01:01:44.366 --> 01:01:48.170
which means that you have a
legacy that you can build on--

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:51.407
plenty of challenges, but
plenty of opportunities.

01:01:51.507 --> 01:01:53.843
And the question is, do you
decide to grasp them or not?

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.614
AUDIENCE: So thank you.

01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:00.616
I'm wondering, Noam,
how much emphasis

01:02:00.717 --> 01:02:04.019
you would place on the
possibility of finding

01:02:04.119 --> 01:02:06.121
solutions addressing
the problems

01:02:06.221 --> 01:02:08.725
you've laid out,
outside the framework

01:02:08.825 --> 01:02:11.660
of the current political
system in the United States?

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.228
And how much emphasis
you would give

01:02:13.328 --> 01:02:20.403
to the necessity of taking
this political system

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:23.139
head on and changing it?

01:02:23.239 --> 01:02:25.541
And what do you
think we need to do

01:02:25.641 --> 01:02:28.877
to change the system to
open up the possibilities

01:02:28.977 --> 01:02:30.446
that you're talking about?

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:31.814
NOAM CHOMSKY:
Well, I think there

01:02:31.914 --> 01:02:34.884
are good grounds for
changing the nature

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:37.520
of the political system
pretty radically.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:42.124
I mean, a system of organization
of production, let's say--

01:02:42.224 --> 01:02:43.592
just keeping to that--

01:02:43.692 --> 01:02:48.297
which is geared towards
profit maximization,

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:52.968
not use, is inherently
destructive.

01:02:53.068 --> 01:02:56.338
A system of institutional
organization

01:02:56.438 --> 01:03:02.778
in which the basic functioning
institutions are totalitarian,

01:03:02.878 --> 01:03:07.449
like a business,
top-down control.

01:03:07.550 --> 01:03:09.851
You fit somewhere in it,
take orders from above.

01:03:09.952 --> 01:03:12.588
Given below at the
bottom, you rent yourself.

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:18.427
That's inherently, I
think, humanly and socially

01:03:18.527 --> 01:03:19.628
destructive.

01:03:19.728 --> 01:03:22.131
So there's plenty of
changes that could be made.

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:23.699
And we can think about them.

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:27.603
And in fact, you can try to
build within the existing

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:34.543
society pieces of what might
be a more democratic and humane

01:03:34.643 --> 01:03:35.978
future society.

01:03:36.078 --> 01:03:37.546
It's even being done.

01:03:37.646 --> 01:03:40.916
But you can't change the
political system radically

01:03:41.016 --> 01:03:44.353
unless the great mass
of the population

01:03:44.453 --> 01:03:50.225
comes to a recognition that
we're in a situation where

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:54.597
the changes that have to
be made can't be made,

01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:57.099
and will be resisted
within the current system.

01:03:57.199 --> 01:03:59.167
And we're nowhere near that.

01:03:59.267 --> 01:04:03.272
So I don't think the question
arises as a practical question.

01:04:03.372 --> 01:04:07.109
It does arise as a question
to have in mind in choosing

01:04:07.209 --> 01:04:08.878
tactics and strategies.

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:14.683
AUDIENCE: Hi, Professor.

01:04:14.783 --> 01:04:17.019
So as we all leave this
lecture hall today,

01:04:17.119 --> 01:04:19.721
what do you want us to
take away from your talk?

01:04:19.821 --> 01:04:23.259
I mean, I know you left us
this one question to ponder

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.827
about, but beyond that?

01:04:25.927 --> 01:04:28.097
And the reason, in
the last few months,

01:04:28.197 --> 01:04:30.732
there have been many
talks on climate change

01:04:30.832 --> 01:04:33.135
on the political climate here--

01:04:33.235 --> 01:04:36.772
speakers including former
Secretary of State John Kerry

01:04:36.872 --> 01:04:41.744
and also a Nobel Laureate, Mario
Molina who discovered CFCs.

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:45.915
But beyond discussions,
in terms of actions,

01:04:46.015 --> 01:04:49.885
what do you want all of us,
and also people watching

01:04:49.985 --> 01:04:52.822
through Facebook, to do?

01:04:52.922 --> 01:04:56.592
I came from a city called
Duisburg in Germany.

01:04:56.692 --> 01:05:00.963
And it used to be part of the
heartland of the German coal

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:05.734
and steel industries until
recent past couple of years

01:05:05.834 --> 01:05:10.672
ago, they implemented new energy
policies to basically shut down

01:05:10.772 --> 01:05:14.677
all these factories that were
harming the environment to such

01:05:14.777 --> 01:05:16.512
a radical degree.

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:21.016
And even though it practically
crippled the German economy

01:05:21.116 --> 01:05:25.354
in terms of coal and steel
production, ultimately,

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:29.325
the environment benefited
a lot from that.

01:05:29.425 --> 01:05:30.492
NOAM CHOMSKY: From benefit--

01:05:30.592 --> 01:05:32.060
AUDIENCE: From the
energy policies

01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:36.398
that crippled the economic force
which was coming from the steel

01:05:36.498 --> 01:05:39.702
and coal industries in Germany,
in West Germany, near the Rhine

01:05:39.802 --> 01:05:41.203
[inaudible].

01:05:41.303 --> 01:05:42.805
But here in America,
even though we're

01:05:42.905 --> 01:05:45.240
having so many
discussions about what can

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:46.475
we do in terms of the economy.

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:47.709
NOAM CHOMSKY: What can we do?

01:05:47.809 --> 01:05:48.510
Lots of things.

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:52.048
AUDIENCE: I feel like we have--

01:05:52.148 --> 01:05:53.648
it's more of a
question of balance.

01:05:53.749 --> 01:05:55.850
How much do we want to
sacrifice of our economy

01:05:55.951 --> 01:05:57.753
in order to save
the environment?

01:05:57.853 --> 01:06:01.523
But then some of us, it's
just not a matter of action,

01:06:01.623 --> 01:06:04.059
but more of a matter of
discussing things and talking

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:04.994
about it.

01:06:05.094 --> 01:06:08.396
And I just--

01:06:08.496 --> 01:06:11.500
I guess the question is--

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.968
NOAM CHOMSKY: What can we do?

01:06:13.068 --> 01:06:15.104
AUDIENCE: Exactly, what is the
bigger point of your lecture?

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:16.572
other than to ponder
this question?

01:06:16.672 --> 01:06:18.674
NOAM CHOMSKY: So you people
here, what can you do?

01:06:18.774 --> 01:06:19.775
All sorts of things--

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:22.511
I just mentioned, in
fact, a number of them.

01:06:22.611 --> 01:06:25.114
Say, for example,
the bill that's

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:29.117
pending in the Massachusetts
state legislature.

01:06:29.217 --> 01:06:33.355
If it was passed, it
could have a big impact.

01:06:33.455 --> 01:06:37.259
It could put the
state on a direction

01:06:37.359 --> 01:06:41.596
in the near future
towards a 100% renewable

01:06:41.696 --> 01:06:45.434
energy, which San Diego's
already moving towards.

01:06:45.534 --> 01:06:50.973
And San Diego is not exactly
a bastion of liberalism.

01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:53.108
If that can be done there,
it can be done here.

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:54.910
But it's not going to
happen unless there's

01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:56.712
plenty of pressure for it.

01:06:56.812 --> 01:07:01.250
I think there are three
legislators who put it through,

01:07:01.350 --> 01:07:03.318
and virtually nothing
is known about it.

01:07:03.418 --> 01:07:06.689
So one thing that people
can do, out of thousands,

01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:10.091
is try to work to get
measures like that

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:12.894
passed, not only in the
state, but even in, say,

01:07:12.994 --> 01:07:15.697
Cambridge, like San Diego.

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:19.067
Another thing you can do
is move very directly.

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:22.538
Even simple things like
replacing light bulbs

01:07:22.638 --> 01:07:26.408
with LED bulbs has a
pretty significant impact

01:07:26.508 --> 01:07:28.777
on energy production.

01:07:28.877 --> 01:07:31.947
And that can be done.

01:07:32.047 --> 01:07:34.449
To do it on a
significant scale takes

01:07:34.549 --> 01:07:36.218
organization and activism.

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:37.653
But that's one thing you can do.

01:07:40.889 --> 01:07:46.195
As I mentioned, the most popular
candidate and political figure

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:49.598
in the country happens to be
Bernie Sanders, overwhelmingly

01:07:49.698 --> 01:07:51.266
among young people.

01:07:51.366 --> 01:07:56.471
That popularity-- he calls
his opposition a revolution.

01:07:56.571 --> 01:07:59.808
But that's an indication
of how far the country has

01:07:59.908 --> 01:08:01.643
shifted to the right.

01:08:01.743 --> 01:08:04.112
In fact, his policies
would have been

01:08:04.212 --> 01:08:07.249
quite acceptable to Eisenhower.

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:10.886
In fact, if you go back and
read Eisenhower's comments

01:08:10.986 --> 01:08:14.757
on the New Deal, he said
anyone who questions

01:08:14.857 --> 01:08:18.293
New Deal policies doesn't
belong in the political system.

01:08:18.393 --> 01:08:21.029
That's just about
everybody by now,

01:08:21.129 --> 01:08:24.967
except Sanders is calling
for New Deal policies.

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:27.202
Eisenhower's comments
on the significance

01:08:27.302 --> 01:08:33.709
of unions, labor unions, are
almost unimaginable today,

01:08:33.809 --> 01:08:34.844
but correct.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.846
And that's the
right wing in 1950s.

01:08:37.946 --> 01:08:41.883
So yes, we can shift the
spectrum back to the days

01:08:41.983 --> 01:08:46.922
when social democratic policies
were considered legitimate,

01:08:47.022 --> 01:08:48.990
and you can go way beyond that.

01:08:49.090 --> 01:08:52.061
There is an election
coming up in 2018.

01:08:52.161 --> 01:08:54.763
The Democrats, among
their failures,

01:08:54.863 --> 01:08:57.999
have been essentially
the Obama Democrats,

01:08:58.099 --> 01:09:00.302
basically destroyed the party.

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:02.938
There's nothing,
almost nothing left

01:09:03.038 --> 01:09:06.074
except at the
presidential level.

01:09:06.174 --> 01:09:08.710
The Greens have
the same fallacy.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:11.980
They've focused on
the presidential,

01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.684
the quadrennial extravaganza,
haven't built the party

01:09:15.784 --> 01:09:17.819
at the local level--

01:09:17.919 --> 01:09:22.591
school boards, state
legislature, city councils,

01:09:22.691 --> 01:09:24.994
governors, the
whole system, which

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:27.863
has to be in place if
anything's going to happen.

01:09:27.963 --> 01:09:30.031
The Koch brothers
understood this.

01:09:30.131 --> 01:09:32.034
The right wing
has understood it,

01:09:32.134 --> 01:09:36.338
and in fact, built such a
system even on a minority base.

01:09:36.438 --> 01:09:40.241
Hasn't been done on a majority
base, but it certainly can be.

01:09:40.342 --> 01:09:44.046
There's the beginnings
of establishing, say,

01:09:44.146 --> 01:09:50.185
cooperatives, or
worker-owned enterprises,

01:09:50.285 --> 01:09:52.921
run by their own members.

01:09:53.022 --> 01:09:54.723
These are things that
not only can be done,

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.692
but are being done.

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:59.561
There's a whole range
of possibilities

01:09:59.661 --> 01:10:05.134
that can be pursued
if you choose them,

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:06.268
if you choose to do it.

01:10:06.368 --> 01:10:08.037
There's just no
shortage of things.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.342
AUDIENCE: It's an immense
pleasure to listen to you.

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:16.177
I'm a little bit
off topic, but I

01:10:16.277 --> 01:10:20.081
don't think I will have a
chance ever to ask you that.

01:10:20.181 --> 01:10:22.518
What do you think
about the meddling,

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:26.755
the Kremlin in our election?

01:10:26.855 --> 01:10:28.223
NOAM CHOMSKY: Sorry,
I didn't hear.

01:10:28.323 --> 01:10:29.191
Could anybody--

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:30.992
AUDIENCE: The
meddling of Russia,

01:10:31.092 --> 01:10:35.330
the Kremlin, in
our 2016 election.

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:36.565
NOAM CHOMSKY: I'm sorry, but--

01:10:39.234 --> 01:10:40.102
I don't--

01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:42.204
AUDIENCE: The
meddling of Russia,

01:10:42.304 --> 01:10:44.039
allegedly, in our election.

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:47.709
NOAM CHOMSKY: Oh, the meddling
of Russia in our elections.

01:10:47.809 --> 01:10:51.045
That has most of the world
cracking up in laughter.

01:10:51.146 --> 01:10:54.783
[applause]

01:10:54.883 --> 01:10:58.787
Literally, suppose
every charge is correct.

01:10:58.887 --> 01:11:02.223
Let's say the most severe
charges are correct.

01:11:02.323 --> 01:11:04.493
That's not even a
joke as compared

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:06.427
with what we do constantly.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:10.766
[applause]

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:13.034
Just take a minor example--

01:11:13.134 --> 01:11:15.771
what we do with
Russian elections.

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:21.709
In the early '90s, when
Yeltsin was Clinton's favorite,

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:28.483
he was supposed to be
the hope for the future.

01:11:28.584 --> 01:11:34.522
When he destroyed the
parliament and overthrew

01:11:34.623 --> 01:11:37.626
the formal democratic
system, he was strongly

01:11:37.726 --> 01:11:39.694
supported by the United States.

01:11:39.794 --> 01:11:43.165
In 1996, when he was
extremely unpopular--

01:11:43.265 --> 01:11:48.136
for pretty good reasons,
because the shock treatment,

01:11:48.236 --> 01:11:53.542
the sort of free market policies
imposed by American advisers,

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:57.212
just wiped out the economy
and led to the death

01:11:57.312 --> 01:11:58.479
of millions of people.

01:11:58.579 --> 01:12:00.348
It was highly destructive.

01:12:00.448 --> 01:12:03.351
It led to the rise of the
oligarchs, many of them

01:12:03.451 --> 01:12:07.823
former apparatchiks in
the Communist system

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:09.691
who stole the resources.

01:12:09.791 --> 01:12:11.426
It was a total disaster.

01:12:11.526 --> 01:12:13.728
And Yeltsin was
the symbol of it.

01:12:13.828 --> 01:12:17.232
Clinton moved in quite openly.

01:12:17.332 --> 01:12:19.334
There was nothing
secret about it--

01:12:19.434 --> 01:12:23.138
very openly, with everything
from loans to advice

01:12:23.238 --> 01:12:26.041
to direct involvement
to try to make sure

01:12:26.141 --> 01:12:28.410
that our fair-haired boy won.

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:31.046
That's 1996.

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.882
And these are minor examples.

01:12:33.982 --> 01:12:35.283
The kind of thing
we do constantly

01:12:35.383 --> 01:12:38.853
is just overthrow
the government,

01:12:38.953 --> 01:12:41.489
institute a military
dictatorship, and not

01:12:41.589 --> 01:12:43.424
in the distant past.

01:12:43.525 --> 01:12:48.330
It just happened under
Obama, 2009 in Honduras.

01:12:48.430 --> 01:12:51.266
There was a mildly
reformist government.

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:58.473
The tiny elite of super-rich who
run the country didn't like it.

01:12:58.573 --> 01:13:01.043
He was kicked out
in a military coup.

01:13:01.143 --> 01:13:04.213
The United States is one of
the very few countries that

01:13:04.313 --> 01:13:09.451
supported it, and claim that
the election taken place

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:12.888
under military dictatorship
was legitimate.

01:13:12.988 --> 01:13:15.123
That's basically
supporting a military coup

01:13:15.223 --> 01:13:17.225
to overthrow a
parliamentary government.

01:13:17.326 --> 01:13:19.995
Is that meddling
in the election?

01:13:20.095 --> 01:13:24.533
You know it just goes
on and on like this.

01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:26.968
So as I say, this is just
making the United States kind

01:13:27.068 --> 01:13:30.472
of a laughingstock in the world,
even if every single charge

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:31.606
is correct.

01:13:31.706 --> 01:13:33.008
Most of them have no basis.

01:13:35.209 --> 01:13:35.944
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:13:39.014 --> 01:13:40.849
AUDIENCE: So the silence
in the media right now

01:13:40.949 --> 01:13:44.052
regarding climate change, an
existential threat to humanity,

01:13:44.152 --> 01:13:45.486
is pretty deafening.

01:13:45.586 --> 01:13:47.522
And you provide an
explanation for that

01:13:47.622 --> 01:13:49.057
in your book,
Manufacturing Consent--

01:13:49.157 --> 01:13:50.692
that there are
certain filters that

01:13:50.792 --> 01:13:54.429
limit the range of acceptable
political discourse.

01:13:54.529 --> 01:13:56.965
I'm wondering, though-- it seems
like in this recent election

01:13:57.065 --> 01:13:58.567
cycle that maybe
some of those filters

01:13:58.667 --> 01:14:02.136
are being circumnavigated by
increased use of the internet

01:14:02.236 --> 01:14:05.741
and more democratic
social mass media.

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:07.409
Do you think that the
election of Trump,

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:10.044
the insurgent primary
of Bernie Sanders,

01:14:10.144 --> 01:14:13.482
and the sudden outcry from major
media outlets about fake news

01:14:13.582 --> 01:14:16.752
and the end of truth are a
sign that maybe this propaganda

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:17.919
system is breaking down?

01:14:18.019 --> 01:14:19.954
And if so, what does
that mean for the ability

01:14:20.054 --> 01:14:21.657
to sort of break the
silence regarding

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:24.392
these existential
threats that we face?

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:26.728
NOAM CHOMSKY: I think
that's very important.

01:14:26.829 --> 01:14:29.698
If you take a look at
the Sanders campaign,

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:33.535
it really hasn't been discussed
as much as it should be,

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:36.338
but it was a pretty
astonishing achievement.

01:14:36.438 --> 01:14:40.875
I mean, for well over a
century, American elections

01:14:40.976 --> 01:14:44.346
have been pretty much
bought, and the evidence

01:14:44.446 --> 01:14:46.314
is just overwhelming.

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:48.917
The person who's done
most of the work on this

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:53.921
is Tom Ferguson, political
scientist at UMass,

01:14:54.021 --> 01:14:56.858
Boston, used to be at MIT.

01:14:56.958 --> 01:15:01.630
He's got a book called
Golden Rule, which

01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:08.102
studies the role just simply
of campaign funding on outcome

01:15:08.202 --> 01:15:13.308
of elections and policies going
way back into the 19th century,

01:15:13.408 --> 01:15:15.477
right through the
New Deal, and so on.

01:15:15.577 --> 01:15:18.112
And it's startling results.

01:15:18.212 --> 01:15:21.015
He has a recent paper that
came out a couple of months

01:15:21.115 --> 01:15:26.354
ago looking at congressional
elections from about 1980

01:15:26.454 --> 01:15:31.326
up to the present, and just
comparing campaign funding

01:15:31.426 --> 01:15:33.027
with electability.

01:15:33.127 --> 01:15:34.996
It's kind of like
a straight line.

01:15:35.096 --> 01:15:40.235
You don't get results like
that in the social sciences.

01:15:40.335 --> 01:15:41.903
And it's nothing new.

01:15:42.003 --> 01:15:46.908
I mean, back in 1895, there
was a great campaign manager

01:15:47.008 --> 01:15:48.810
then named Mark Hanna.

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:52.280
And he was asked once,
what's necessary to run

01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:55.683
a successful political campaign?

01:15:55.783 --> 01:15:58.620
And he said, well,
you need two things.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.223
The first one is money,
and I've forgotten

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:04.392
what the second one is.

01:16:04.492 --> 01:16:06.194
That was 1895.

01:16:06.294 --> 01:16:08.396
It's gotten way
more extreme since,

01:16:08.496 --> 01:16:10.965
and by now, it's out of sight.

01:16:11.065 --> 01:16:15.803
After over a century of
this, somebody comes along

01:16:15.903 --> 01:16:17.939
who nobody ever heard of.

01:16:18.039 --> 01:16:21.843
He uses a scare
word, "socialist."

01:16:21.943 --> 01:16:26.147
He has no funding, nothing
from the corporate sector,

01:16:26.247 --> 01:16:29.017
and nothing from wealthy people.

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:32.954
Immediate totally against him,
almost either ridiculing of

01:16:33.054 --> 01:16:34.289
or dismissing him.

01:16:34.389 --> 01:16:37.492
He would easily have won the
Democratic Party nomination,

01:16:37.592 --> 01:16:41.363
if it hadn't been for the party
shenanigans to keep him out.

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:43.565
That's a pretty
amazing development.

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:47.435
And what it shows is that
the institutions are--

01:16:47.535 --> 01:16:50.505
they look powerful,
but they collapse

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:53.842
as soon as the population
becomes engaged.

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:56.377
They're basically very weak.

01:16:56.477 --> 01:17:00.816
Actually, that's an insight that
goes back hundreds of years.

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:04.752
One of the first modern
works on politics

01:17:04.852 --> 01:17:08.990
is by David Hume, the
great philosopher founder

01:17:09.090 --> 01:17:10.858
of classical liberalism.

01:17:10.958 --> 01:17:16.064
He has a study called First
Principles of Government.

01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:19.767
And he opens it by saying
that there's a strange paradox

01:17:19.867 --> 01:17:21.236
in governments.

01:17:21.336 --> 01:17:27.175
He says, in every government,
whether military run,

01:17:27.275 --> 01:17:30.912
more-or-less popular like
England at the time, he says,

01:17:31.012 --> 01:17:32.680
there's a strange thing.

01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:35.416
People obey their rulers.

01:17:35.516 --> 01:17:36.884
And why do they?

01:17:36.985 --> 01:17:41.222
Because power is in the
hands of the governed.

01:17:41.322 --> 01:17:43.892
And if they want,
they can take it.

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:47.996
And he says, by what
miracle is this achieved?

01:17:48.096 --> 01:17:50.932
He says, only by
control of opinion.

01:17:51.032 --> 01:17:53.769
If you can make people feel
that they're powerless,

01:17:53.869 --> 01:17:57.572
and everything's futile,
and they can't do anything,

01:17:57.672 --> 01:17:59.841
OK, then they'll obey.

01:17:59.941 --> 01:18:02.343
If not, they don't have to obey.

01:18:02.443 --> 01:18:07.849
And that's much more true in
pretty free countries like ours

01:18:07.949 --> 01:18:10.418
than, say, a military
dictatorship.

01:18:10.518 --> 01:18:12.887
But the paradox is real.

01:18:12.987 --> 01:18:16.324
And it's in people's
hands to overcome it.

01:18:16.424 --> 01:18:19.961
And the Sanders campaign is one
dramatic illustration of that.

01:18:20.061 --> 01:18:22.897
And what you say about
alternative media--

01:18:22.997 --> 01:18:26.000
it can be, too, if
it's properly done.

01:18:26.100 --> 01:18:28.069
Also affects the major
media, because they

01:18:28.169 --> 01:18:30.171
have to respond to it.

01:18:30.271 --> 01:18:35.443
So the institutional structure
is basically quite weak,

01:18:35.543 --> 01:18:39.213
and can easily be changed.

01:18:39.313 --> 01:18:41.149
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:18:41.249 --> 01:18:43.351
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:18:43.451 --> 01:18:48.522
I want to be hopeful about
our major institutions,

01:18:48.622 --> 01:18:52.727
our systems of governance, and
higher education in particular,

01:18:52.827 --> 01:18:56.364
and its ability to grapple
with the immense challenge

01:18:56.464 --> 01:19:00.635
of climate change and its like.

01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:02.237
But sometimes I
wonder if we really

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:05.173
need something
dramatically different.

01:19:05.273 --> 01:19:07.375
When I think about higher
education, the world

01:19:07.475 --> 01:19:12.847
that I live in, mostly, do you
think that there's completely

01:19:12.947 --> 01:19:14.682
new structures or
approaches that we

01:19:14.782 --> 01:19:17.652
should be trying to create
in order to deal with this?

01:19:17.752 --> 01:19:20.889
Because incrementalism
maybe isn't doing so hot.

01:19:23.624 --> 01:19:29.296
NOAM CHOMSKY: I think any of us
could sit down at a coffee shop

01:19:29.397 --> 01:19:33.301
and think of much better
ways to run the world--

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:36.304
better institutions,
more democratic ones,

01:19:36.404 --> 01:19:38.473
more just ones, and so on.

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:42.110
But thinking of that
doesn't really help.

01:19:42.210 --> 01:19:46.381
You have to get the great
mass of the population

01:19:46.481 --> 01:19:48.416
to be committed to creating it.

01:19:48.516 --> 01:19:51.686
And you can do
that incrementally.

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:55.523
You have to work within
the system that exists.

01:19:55.623 --> 01:19:57.192
You can do a lot of
things within it.

01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:59.794
You can have a
vision of the future

01:19:59.894 --> 01:20:05.366
which people can take as a
guideline for further action.

01:20:05.466 --> 01:20:12.006
And maybe, as I mentioned
before, you can construct

01:20:12.107 --> 01:20:15.710
institutions of a future
society within this one,

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:20.614
like cooperatives, for example,
like worker-owned enterprises.

01:20:20.714 --> 01:20:25.553
If they would extend, they would
change the society enormously.

01:20:25.653 --> 01:20:28.523
And those are things
that arise constantly,

01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:31.659
if you're willing to
grasp the opportunity.

01:20:31.759 --> 01:20:36.263
So take, say, the 2008 crash.

01:20:36.363 --> 01:20:37.932
One of the things
that happened then,

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:40.068
which was pretty
interesting, was

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:42.603
that the government essentially
nationalized the auto

01:20:42.704 --> 01:20:44.238
industry--

01:20:44.338 --> 01:20:46.173
basically just bailed it out.

01:20:46.273 --> 01:20:47.942
It was going to disappear.

01:20:48.042 --> 01:20:50.511
So the government,
meaning the taxpayer,

01:20:50.611 --> 01:20:52.881
bought out the auto industry.

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:54.515
And then there were
a couple of choices

01:20:54.615 --> 01:20:56.217
that could have been made.

01:20:56.317 --> 01:21:00.621
One choice is the one that
was made without discussion--

01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:04.526
namely, to turn it back
to the former owners,

01:21:04.626 --> 01:21:09.330
maybe new faces, but pretty
much same banks, and so on.

01:21:09.430 --> 01:21:11.900
So essentially turn it
back to the former owners

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.635
and have it go on doing
exactly what it was doing--

01:21:14.735 --> 01:21:16.370
producing cars.

01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:18.439
There was another possibility--

01:21:18.539 --> 01:21:20.341
turn it over to the workforce.

01:21:20.441 --> 01:21:22.843
Let them run it
democratically, and have

01:21:22.943 --> 01:21:25.146
it produce what
the society needs,

01:21:25.246 --> 01:21:29.550
which is not more cars, but
rational mass transportation.

01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:31.952
That was another possibility.

01:21:32.052 --> 01:21:34.021
But in order for it
to be implemented,

01:21:34.121 --> 01:21:37.325
you had to have mass
popular support for it.

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:41.196
There was essentially
none, so it didn't happen.

01:21:41.296 --> 01:21:43.598
And things like that
happen even right locally

01:21:43.698 --> 01:21:45.332
in this neighborhood.

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:48.770
A couple of years ago,
there was a small plant

01:21:48.870 --> 01:21:53.308
in the Taunton suburb
of Boston, which

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:58.579
was quite successful-- a plant
making sophisticated parts

01:21:58.679 --> 01:22:00.648
for aircraft.

01:22:00.748 --> 01:22:04.185
It wasn't making enough profit
for the multinational who

01:22:04.285 --> 01:22:06.520
owned it to keep it
going, so they decided

01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:08.423
to put it out of business.

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:14.128
The union, progressive union,
UE, offered to buy the plant

01:22:14.228 --> 01:22:16.798
and have it run by
the workforce, which

01:22:16.898 --> 01:22:18.299
probably would have
been profitable

01:22:18.399 --> 01:22:20.001
for the multinational.

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:24.439
But for class reasons, they
don't like that kind of thing.

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:28.709
If there had been popular
support, they could have won.

01:22:28.809 --> 01:22:31.345
There wasn't any,
so they didn't win.

01:22:31.445 --> 01:22:33.714
Things like that are
happening all the time.

01:22:33.814 --> 01:22:37.385
These could lead to major
changes in the society.

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:39.220
Are they incremental?

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:43.257
In a sense, but their
long-term consequences

01:22:43.357 --> 01:22:45.826
could be very, very great.

01:22:45.926 --> 01:22:48.929
And that's true of
all kinds of things.

01:22:49.029 --> 01:22:50.031
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:52.834
Let's go grab some of
those opportunities.

01:22:52.934 --> 01:22:55.270
MICHELLE NHUCH: I think we have
time for one more question.

01:22:58.106 --> 01:22:59.340
AUDIENCE: Hi, everyone.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.543
I have [inaudible]
question for everybody

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:02.677
who is here, actually.

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:04.145
Thank you so much.

01:23:07.147 --> 01:23:11.152
The first question is, how many
of you have a car in this room?

01:23:11.252 --> 01:23:12.353
NOAM CHOMSKY: Sorry?

01:23:12.453 --> 01:23:14.556
AUDIENCE: How many of you
have a car in this room?

01:23:17.892 --> 01:23:20.862
And how many of you run your
car at least five minutes

01:23:20.962 --> 01:23:22.731
to warm up while
you're getting ready?

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:30.538
How many of you use
paper or plastic plates?

01:23:30.638 --> 01:23:35.209
And how many of you replace
their cell phones every year?

01:23:35.309 --> 01:23:37.945
So being environment
friendly requires being

01:23:38.045 --> 01:23:40.448
aware of mistakes that we do.

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:42.850
And I would like to
remind everyone here--

01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:46.754
change only comes in baby
steps of people who care.

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:49.190
Let's show that we care
about the environment.

01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:53.328
And let's rethink about what
we buy and what we spend on.

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:57.465
[applause]

01:23:57.565 --> 01:23:58.800
NOAM CHOMSKY: I'm sorry.

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:03.237
MICHELLE NHUCH: There was no
question, I guess, for you.

01:24:03.337 --> 01:24:05.874
On behalf of the Center
for International Studies,

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:08.742
I would like to thank everyone
for attending this event.

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:11.211
And please join me in
thanking Noam Chomsky.

01:24:11.312 --> 01:24:11.913
[applause]

01:24:12.013 --> 01:24:13.982
NOAM CHOMSKY: Thank you.
