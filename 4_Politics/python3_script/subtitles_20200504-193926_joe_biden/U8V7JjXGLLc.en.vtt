00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:00.750
All right.

00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:05.700
We're back with the governor
of New York, Andrew Cuomo.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.520
So you had a meeting with
the president last week.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.130
Let's hear how that went.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.060
Swimmingly.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.480
All right.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.250
You don't even need to--

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:20.750
The--

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.290
Go ahead.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.480
President and I don't have a
warm and fuzzy relationship.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.320
He's not much a
fan of my politics,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.690
and we have been going back
and forth for many years now.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.170
And that's OK.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.870
But we sat down.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.610
We had a meeting
about this issue

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.820
of testing, which is going to
be very important going forward.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.090
Nobody really understands it.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.400
Nobody's really done it before.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.552
We have to bring this testing to
a scale that's been unheard of.

00:00:49.552 --> 00:00:51.260
And there's been a
lot of back and forth.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.427
Does the federal government?

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:55.260
Do the state governments
do it, et cetera.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.410
And in truth, we
both have to do it,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.670
because we both have
responsibilities.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.480
So I wanted to just
sit down with them

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.120
and sort of figure
out, how do we do it?

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.970
Who does it?

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:06.720
What do I do?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.060
What do you do?

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.460
And let's just cut
to the chase on this.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.250
And it was actually
a good conversation.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.410
And look, credit
where credit is due.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.900
I know that the
president's people--

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.700
I'm not their biggest--

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.080
they're not my biggest fan.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.110
And that's OK.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.420
But we actually did what we
were supposed to do, Ellen.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.610
And I think that's important,
because nobody really

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.710
cares what the president
thinks about me

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.900
or what I think about
the president, right?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.930
Who cares about all these
emotions and politics and all

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:39.860
this stuff?

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:40.890
Just do your job.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.960
Do your job.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.310
So that's what we did.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.770
And we have a good
template going forward.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.620
We're going to work to
double the number of tests

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.000
in this state, which is a big
deal, because the testing is

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.590
the only matrix you
have to move forward.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.650
When do you reopen?

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.840
How fast do you reopen?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.550
Where do you reopen?

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.000
The only gauge you have
as you go through this

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.470
is if you're testing and
you're actually watching what

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.630
happens to the infection rate.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.600
So as you're moving
towards reopening,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.790
are you moving that
infection rate?

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.350
Are more people
getting infected?

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.820
To do that, you
have to do testing.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.550
So it was a productive meeting.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.310
And we have a gameplan.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.860
And I think we have a game
plan not just for New York,

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.300
but for California and
all the other states.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.760
Yes, because you
can say you're going

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.590
to have all that testing
in, you know, one state,

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.190
but then another state opens
early like Georgia or Florida

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.980
or these people that want
to start opening businesses.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.260
What happens when
these people decide

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.380
to travel to another state
that we have stayed home?

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.680
So it's just dangerous
to allow that to happen

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.810
if people come to us.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.040
Yeah, there's no doubt about it.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.880
And that's why we try to
operate-- in the Northeast,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.190
we're operating with seven
states as part of one coalition

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.080
precisely for that reason.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.000
If Connecticut does something--

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.877
if Connecticut
opens its beaches,

00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:16.460
all the New Yorkers will go to
Connecticut to go to the beach,

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.210
right?

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:18.950
So you have to coordinate.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.530
And we have about seven states
that are working together

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.270
to coordinate.

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.680
And California is coordinating
with the neighboring states,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.180
because people are so desperate
to get out and do things,

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.580
that they will go
to the next state.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.900
All right, we'll take a break.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.030
More with the
governor after this.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.030
All right, we're back
with Governor Cuomo.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.652
Can I say that I
am a Cuomosexual?

00:03:43.652 --> 00:03:45.110
You know that that's
going around--

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.960
that people are saying
they're Cuomosexuals?

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.860
Yeah, I think
that's a good thing.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.090
I don't think it's a bad thing.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.183
It's not a bad thing.

00:03:54.183 --> 00:03:55.350
People are in love with you.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.490
It started with Trevor Noah.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.200
And but not only--

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.030
but it includes
your brother, Chris.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.860
Both Cuomos, I enjoy
both of you very much.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.730
Yes, but you enjoy me more.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.560
Didn't you say that earlier?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.490
Yes.

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.990
Yes.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.365
Yes, I can say that right now
because I'm talking to you,

00:04:16.365 --> 00:04:20.589
but then when I'll talk to
him, I'll say he's my favorite.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.850
I know you have this competition
with who the mother loves more,

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:26.440
and I understand all that.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.970
But you're both charming.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:28.960
You're both adorable.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.590
Now, you've obviously
already had this relationship

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:33.580
that's adorable.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.190
But do you think this has
brought you closer together

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.280
because he contracted COVID-19?

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.780
No.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.110
You can't be closer than I
am with my brother Chris.

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.230
We have been all our lives.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.600
He's my best friend--

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.790
my little best friend.

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.250
But we have a very
special relationship.

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.150
I just felt bad during that
whole coronavirus thing.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.890
One of the peculiar
hellish facts--

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.870
he's sick, his wife gets sick,
he has the kids in the house,

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.060
and I can't even go to help.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.130
That's one of the
bizarre things here.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.190
So I have my brother's sick.

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:17.730
And whatever they say, well,
you're young, don't worry.

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:19.140
Yeah, but you still worry.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.540
And he had it, and I couldn't
even get close to him.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.060
And nobody could go over
to the house to help.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.890
It really is so miserable, this
situation, in so many ways.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.240
But he's better.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.820
He's good.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.400
His wife is better.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.950
Now his son has it,
which is what happens.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.600
It just works its way
through the family.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.130
But no, we had a little--

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.100
and, look, talk about guts.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:53.640
The day he got diagnosed with
it, he went on air that night.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.370
And that took real guts.

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.190
I don't care how strong
you are, they call you up

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.670
and they say, you tested
positive for coronavirus,

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:05.880
you have to have some
butterflies in your stomach.

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.620
And he went right on
the air that night,

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.110
and I think he did a great
public service, because he

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.030
shared it with people.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:14.940
He took the mystery off it.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.200
And he showed what it was
like every step of the way.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.420
And we actually had
some fun with it.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:24.120
So it all worked.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.020
Thank god.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.610
Yeah, it really did.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.030
It worked in a way that
it made it, obviously,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.060
more personal when you know
somebody or somebody that you

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:35.980
watch and you feel like you
have a relationship with them.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.860
And you could see
the pain in his eyes.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.360
You could see when he had fever.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.040
He just looked so sick.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:46.470
And anyway, I just think
that you're amazing.

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:51.900
When you run for president, I
will be behind you all the way,

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:56.040
because that's going to be
exciting to watch you run.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.320
And--

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.270
No pressure.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:01.800
No comment.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.342
You're supposed to
say something now.

00:07:03.342 --> 00:07:04.650
No comment.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.190
I'm governor of the great state
of New York, and I'm happy.

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.690
All right.

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.600
Well, I do think that that
will happen at some point.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.840
And I think that'll be a great
thing when it does happen.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.640
Thank you so much
for all you're doing.

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.890
Thanks for taking the
time to talk to me.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.550
And send my love to
your little brother,

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.940
and tell him I'm very happy he's
feeling better-- and my love

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:29.970
to the family.

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:30.470
Thank you.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:31.178
Thank you, Ellen.

00:07:31.178 --> 00:07:32.390
Thank you very much.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:33.800
Pleasure to be with you.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.500
All right.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.160
Thanks, nice to be with you too.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.790
And my love to the boyfriend.

00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.260
Stop there.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:42.935
Hi, I'm Andy.

00:07:42.935 --> 00:07:45.560
Ellen asked me to remind you to
subscribe to her channel so you

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.170
can see more awesome videos,
like videos of me getting

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:51.800
scared or saying embarrassing
things like ball-peen hammer--

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.590
and also some videos of
Ellen and other celebrities,

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:56.150
if you're into
that sort of thing.
