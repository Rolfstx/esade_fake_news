00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.567
The Presdient:
Thank you, John, for
the gracious introduction.

00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:12.834
To Mike and Eric, thank you for
hosting me. Thank you to all of
you for receiving me.

00:00:12.834 --> 00:00:17.867
It is wonderful to be here. I
want to also acknowledge Mark

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:20.800
Strand, president of the Congressional Institute.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.767
To all the family
members who are here and
who have to put up

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:28.800
with us for an elective office
each and every day, thank you,
because I know that's tough.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.000
(applause.)

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.500
I very much am appreciative of not only the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.133
tone of your introduction, John,
but also the invitation that you
extended to me.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:46.433
You know what they say, "Keep
your friends close, but visit

00:00:46.433 --> 00:00:48.700
the Republican Caucus
every few months."

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.834
(laughter.)

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:58.133
Part of the reason I accepted
your invitation to come here was
because I wanted to speak

00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:03.000
with all of you, and not just to
all of you. So I'm looking
forward to taking your questions

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.567
and having a real conversation
in a few moments. And I hope
that the conversation we begin

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:13.700
here doesn't end here; that
we can continue our dialogue
in the days ahead.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.233
It's important to me
that we do so.

00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:18.734
It's important to you, I think,
that we do so.

00:01:18.734 --> 00:01:23.166
But most importantly, it's
important to the American
people that we do so.

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:29.900
I've said this before, but I'm a
big believer not just in the
value of a loyal opposition,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:36.767
but in its necessity. Having
differences of opinion, having
a real debate about matters

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:47.200
for our country, it's absolutely
essential. It's only through the
process of disagreement

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.400
and debate that bad ideas get
tossed out and good ideas get
refined and made better.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.100
And that kind of vigorous back
and forth -- that imperfect but
well-founded process, messy

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.467
as it often is -- is at the heart of our democracy.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.033
That's what makes us the greatest nation in the world.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:08.400
So, yes, I want you to
challenge my ideas,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.266
and I guarantee you that
after reading this
I may challenge a few of yours.

00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:15.333
(laughter.)

00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:17.900
I want you to stand up for
your beliefs, and knowing this

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.600
caucus, I have no
doubt that you will.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.333
I want us to have a constructive debate.

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:27.867
The only thing I don't want --
and here I am listening to the
American people,

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:32.734
and I think they don't
want either -- is for
Washington to continue

00:02:32.734 --> 00:02:38.834
being so Washington-like.

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:50.467
I know folks, when we're in town
there, spend a lot of time
reading the polls and looking

00:02:50.467 --> 00:02:52.367
at focus groups and interpreting
which party has the upper hand
in November and in 2012

00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:57.033
and so on and so on and so on.
That's their obsession.

00:02:57.033 --> 00:03:02.066
And I'm not a pundit. I'm just a
President, so take it for what
it's worth.

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:08.300
But I don't believe that the American people want us to
focus on our job security.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.967
They want us to focus on their job security.

00:03:09.967 --> 00:03:21.900
(applause.)
I don't think they
want more gridlock.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.867
I don't think they
want more partisanship.

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:27.300
I don't think they want more
obstruction.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.967
They didn't send us to
Washington to fight each other
in some sort of political

00:03:32.967 --> 00:03:37.500
steel-cage match to see who comes out alive.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.100
That's not what they want. They
sent us to Washington to work

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.467
together, to get things done,
and to solve the problems that
they're grappling with every

00:03:44.467 --> 00:03:46.333
single day.

00:03:46.333 --> 00:03:49.200
And I think your
constituents would want to

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.867
know that despite the fact it
doesn't get a lot of attention,
you and I have actually

00:03:54.867 --> 00:03:59.367
worked together on a number of
occasions. There have been times
where we've acted in

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:04.500
a bipartisan fashion. And I want
to thank you and your Democratic
colleagues for reaching

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.667
across the aisle.

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:09.567
There has been, for example,
broad support for putting in
the troops necessary

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:17.233
in Afghanistan to deny al Qaeda
safe haven, to break the
Taliban's momentum, and to train

00:04:17.233 --> 00:04:19.100
Afghan security forces.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.033
There's been broad support
for disrupting, dismantling,
and defeating al Qaeda.

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:26.767
And I know that we're all
united in our admiration
of our troops.

00:04:26.767 --> 00:04:35.867
(applause.)
So it may be useful for the international audience right now

00:04:35.867 --> 00:04:40.000
to understand -- and
certainly for our enemies to
have no doubt -- whatever

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.867
divisions and differences may
exist in Washington, the United
States of America stands

00:04:44.867 --> 00:05:06.333
as one to defend our country.
(applause.)

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:08.500
It's that same spirit of
bipartisanship that made

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.166
it possible for me
to sign a defense contracting

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:16.734
reform bill that was cosponsored
by Senator McCain and members of
Congress here today.

00:05:16.734 --> 00:05:20.500
We've stood together on behalf
of our nation's veterans. Together we passed

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.800
the largest increase in the VA's
budget in more than 30 years and

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.000
supported essential veterans' health care reforms

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.533
to provide better access and
medical care for those who
serve in uniform.

00:05:31.533 --> 00:05:33.834
Some of you also joined Democrats in supporting

00:05:33.834 --> 00:05:38.867
a Credit Card Bill of Rights and
in extending unemployment
compensation to

00:05:38.867 --> 00:05:41.433
Americans who are out of work.

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:44.700
Some of you joined us in
stopping tobacco companies from targeting

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.000
kids, expanding opportunities
for young people to serve our
country, and helping responsible

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:59.500
homeowners stay in their homes.
So we have a track record of working together.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.300
It is possible.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:08.567
But, as John, you mentioned, on
some very big things, we've seen
party-line

00:06:08.567 --> 00:06:13.200
votes that, I'm just going to be
honest, were disappointing.
Let's start with our efforts

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.266
to jumpstart the economy
last winter, when we were
losing 700,000 jobs a month.

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:22.100
Our financial system teetered on the brink of collapse and

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.133
the threat of a second Great Depression loomed large.

00:06:26.133 --> 00:06:31.633
I didn't understand then, and
I still don't understand, why
we got opposition in

00:06:31.633 --> 00:06:38.166
this caucus for almost $300
billion in badly needed tax cuts
for the American people, or

00:06:38.166 --> 00:06:43.233
COBRA coverage to help Americans
who've lost jobs in this
recession to keep the health

00:06:43.233 --> 00:06:49.100
insurance that they desperately
needed, or opposition to putting
Americans to work laying

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:53.633
broadband and rebuilding roads
and bridges and breaking ground
on new construction projects.

00:06:53.633 --> 00:07:01.967
There was an interesting headline in CNN today:
"Americans disapprove of

00:07:01.967 --> 00:07:06.066
stimulus, but like
every policy in it."

00:07:06.066 --> 00:07:08.600
And there was a poll that showed
that if you broke it down into

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.467
its component parts, 80 percent
approved of the tax cuts,

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:13.066
80 percent approved of the infrastructure,

00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:17.834
80 percent approved of the
assistance to the unemployed.

00:07:17.834 --> 00:07:27.867
Well, that's what the Recovery
Act was. And let's face it, some
of you have been at the

00:07:27.867 --> 00:07:31.000
ribbon-cuttings for some of
these important projects in your
communities. Now, I understand

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.500
some of you had some philosophical differences
perhaps on the just the concept

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:41.667
of government spending, but, as I recall,

00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:47.133
opposition was declared before
we had a chance to actually meet and exchange ideas.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:50.400
And I saw that as
a missed opportunity.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:55.633
Now, I am happy to report this
morning that we saw another sign
that our economy is moving

00:07:55.633 --> 00:07:57.033
in the right direction.

00:07:57.033 --> 00:08:03.066
The latest GDP numbers show that
our economy is growing by almost 6 percent --

00:08:03.066 --> 00:08:08.800
that's the most since 2003.
To put that in perspective,
this time last year,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.600
we weren't seeing positive job
growth; we were seeing the

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.500
economy shrink by
about 6 percent.

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:19.500
So you've seen a 12
percent reversal during
the course of this year.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:24.934
This turnaround is the biggest
in nearly three decades -- and it didn't happen by accident.

00:08:24.934 --> 00:08:27.967
It happened -- as economists,
conservative and liberal,

00:08:27.967 --> 00:08:32.500
will attest -- because of some
of the steps that we took.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:39.133
And by the way, you mentioned a
Web site out here, John -- if
you want to look at what's

00:08:39.133 --> 00:08:42.934
going on, on the Recovery Act,
you can look on recovery.gov --
a Web site, by the way,

00:08:42.934 --> 00:08:50.133
that was Eric Cantor's idea.
Now, here's the point. These are serious times,

00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:55.100
and what's required by all of us
-- Democrats and Republicans --
is to do what's right for

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:01.133
our country, even if it's not
always what's best for our
politics.

00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:05.533
I know it may be heresy to say
this, but there are things
more important

00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:08.500
than good poll numbers.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.333
And on this no one can accuse me of not living by my principles.

00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:13.967
(laughter.)

00:09:13.967 --> 00:09:15.533
A middle class that's back on

00:09:15.533 --> 00:09:23.200
its feet, an economy that lifts
everybody up, an America that's
ascendant in the world

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:28.100
-- that's more important than
winning an election. Our future
shouldn't be shaped by

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:33.800
what's best for our politics;
our politics should be shaped by
what's best for our future.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.266
But no matter what's happened in
the past, the important thing
for all of us is to

00:09:37.266 --> 00:09:39.533
move forward together.

00:09:39.533 --> 00:09:43.000
We have some issues right
in front of us on which I believe we should

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.767
agree, because as successful as
we've been in spurring new
economic growth, everybody

00:09:48.767 --> 00:09:54.200
understands that job growth has been lagging.
Some of that's predictable.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:00.600
Every economist will say jobs are a lagging indicator, but
that's no consolation

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.633
for the folks who are

00:10:02.633 --> 00:10:06.166
out there suffering right now.
And since 7 million Americans
have lost their jobs in

00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:09.567
this recession, we've got to
do everything we can to
accelerate it.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:15.200
So, today, in line with what I
stated at the State of the
Union, I've proposed a new jobs

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.633
tax credit for small business.
And here's how it would work.
Employers would get a tax

00:10:20.633 --> 00:10:27.700
credit of up to $5,000 for every
employee they add in 2010.
They'd get a tax break for

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:34.934
increases in wages, as well. So,
if you raise wages for employees
making under $100,000,

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:36.900
we'd refund part of your payroll

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:42.900
tax for every dollar you
increase those wages faster
than inflation.

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.000
It's a simple concept.
It's easy to understand.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.400
It would cut taxes for more than 1 million small businesses.

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.200
So I hope you join me.
Let's get this done.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:57.266
I want to eliminate the capital
gains tax for small business
investment, and take some

00:10:57.266 --> 00:11:02.166
of the bailout money the Wall
Street banks have returned and
use it to help community

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:07.433
banks start lending to small
businesses again. So join me. I
am confident that we can do

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:12.467
this together for the American
people. And there's nothing in
that proposal that runs

00:11:12.467 --> 00:11:18.834
contrary to the ideological
predispositions of this caucus.
The question is: What's going

00:11:18.834 --> 00:11:25.433
to keep us from getting this
done? I've proposed a modest fee
on the nation's

00:11:25.433 --> 00:11:30.800
largest banks and financial
institutions to fully recover
for taxpayers' money that they

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:37.500
provided to the financial sector
when it was teetering on the
brink of collapse.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:42.600
And it's designed to discourage
them from taking reckless risks
in the future.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.433
If you listen to the American
people, John, they'll tell you
they want their money back.

00:11:48.433 --> 00:11:52.467
Let's do this together, Republicans and Democrats.

00:11:52.467 --> 00:11:55.066
I propose that we close tax loopholes that

00:11:55.066 --> 00:11:59.400
reward companies for shipping
American jobs overseas, and
instead give companies greater

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.200
incentive to create jobs
right here at home --
right here at home.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.633
Surely, that's something that
we can do together, Republicans
and Democrats.

00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:12.500
We know that we've got a
major fiscal challenge

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.500
in reining in deficits that have
been growing for a decade, and
threaten our future.

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:21.633
That's why I've proposed a
three-year freeze in
discretionary spending

00:12:21.633 --> 00:12:24.500
other than what we need for national security.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:29.767
That's something we should do
together that's consistent with
a lot of the talk both

00:12:29.767 --> 00:12:32.667
in Democratic caucuses and Republican caucuses.

00:12:32.667 --> 00:12:36.900
We can't blink when it's time to actually do the job.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.066
At this point, we know that the budget surpluses

00:12:40.066 --> 00:12:46.900
of the '90s occurred in part
because of the pay-as-you-go
law, which said that, well,

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:52.834
you should pay as you go and
live within our means, just like
families do every day.

00:12:52.834 --> 00:12:55.533
Twenty-four of you voted for that, and I appreciate it.

00:12:55.533 --> 00:12:58.967
And we were able to pass it
in the Senate yesterday.

00:12:58.967 --> 00:13:01.333
But the idea of a bipartisan fiscal commission

00:13:01.333 --> 00:13:06.266
to confront the deficits in the
long term died in the Senate the
other day.

00:13:06.266 --> 00:13:10.967
So I'm going to establish such a commission by executive
order and I hope that you

00:13:10.967 --> 00:13:13.233
participate, fully

00:13:13.233 --> 00:13:20.266
and genuinely, in that effort,
because if we're going to
actually deal with our deficit

00:13:20.266 --> 00:13:24.967
and debt, everybody here knows
that we're going to have to do
it together,

00:13:24.967 --> 00:13:27.533
Republican and Democrat.

00:13:27.533 --> 00:13:34.500
No single party is going to
make the tough choices involved on its own.

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:39.967
It's going to require all of us
doing what's right for the
American people.

00:13:39.967 --> 00:13:44.333
And as I said in the State of
the Union speech, there's not
just a deficit of dollars in

00:13:44.333 --> 00:13:46.033
Washington, there is a
deficit of trust.

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:48.967
So I hope you'll support my
proposal to make all
congressional

00:13:48.967 --> 00:13:53.633
earmarks public before
they come to a vote.

00:13:53.633 --> 00:13:55.500
And let's require
lobbyists who exercise such

00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:02.000
influence to publicly disclose
all their contacts on behalf of
their clients, whether they are

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:08.133
contacts with my administration
or contacts with Congress.
Let's do the people's business

00:14:08.133 --> 00:14:14.233
in the bright light of day, together, Republicans
and Democrats.

00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:20.400
I know how bitter and
contentious the issue of health
insurance reform has become.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.500
And I will eagerly look at the
ideas and better solutions on
the health care front.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:32.000
If anyone here truly believes our health insurance system
is working well for people, I

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000
respect your right to say so, but I just don't agree.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.900
And neither would millions of
Americans with preexisting

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.867
conditions who can't get
coverage today or find out that
they lose their insurance just

00:14:42.867 --> 00:14:45.767
as they're getting
seriously ill.

00:14:45.767 --> 00:14:48.667
That's exactly when
you need insurance.

00:14:48.667 --> 00:14:51.000
And for too many people,
they're not getting it.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.200
I don't think a system is
working when small businesses

00:14:54.200 --> 00:15:01.834
are gouged and 15,000 Americans
are losing coverage every single
day; when premiums have

00:15:01.834 --> 00:15:08.633
doubled and out-of-pocket costs
have exploded and they're poised
to do so again.

00:15:08.633 --> 00:15:13.467
I mean, to be fair, the status
quo is working for the insurance
industry, but it's not working

00:15:13.467 --> 00:15:14.200
for the American people.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:20.834
It's not working for our federal
budget. It needs to change.

00:15:20.834 --> 00:15:27.667
This is a big problem, and all
of us are called on to solve it.
And that's why, from the start,

00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:32.533
I sought out and supported ideas
from Republicans. I even talked
about an issue that has been

00:15:32.533 --> 00:15:36.700
a holy grail for a lot of you,
which was tort reform, and said
that I'd be willing to work

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:42.133
together as part of a comprehensive package
to deal with it.

00:15:42.133 --> 00:15:44.900
I just didn't get
a lot of nibbles.

00:15:44.900 --> 00:15:49.734
Creating a high-risk pool for uninsured folks

00:15:49.734 --> 00:15:52.433
with preexisting conditions,
that wasn't my idea, it was
Senator McCain's.

00:15:52.433 --> 00:15:56.633
And I supported it, and it got incorporated into our approach.

00:15:56.633 --> 00:16:01.900
Allowing insurance companies to sell coverage across state lines to add choice and competition

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.066
and bring down costs for businesses and consumers

00:16:05.066 --> 00:16:10.133
-- that's an idea that some of
you I suspect included in this
better solutions; that's

00:16:10.133 --> 00:16:17.200
an idea that was incorporated
into our package. And I support
it, provided that we do it hand

00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.000
in hand with broader reforms
that protect benefits and
protect patients and protect

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.533
the American people.

00:16:22.533 --> 00:16:24.667
A number of you have suggested creating pools

00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:28.300
where self-employed and small businesses could
buy insurance.

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.100
That was a good idea.
I embraced it.

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.600
Some of you supported efforts to
provide insurance to children
and let kids remain

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:40.533
covered on their parents'
insurance until they're 25 or
26. I supported that.

00:16:40.533 --> 00:16:42.300
That's part of our package.

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.600
I supported a number
of other ideas, from incentivizing wellness

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.100
to creating an affordable catastrophic insurance

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.400
option for young people that came from Republicans

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:54.467
like Mike Enzi and Olympia Snowe
in the Senate, and I'm sure from
some of you as well.

00:16:54.467 --> 00:17:00.533
So when you say I ought to be
willing to accept Republican
ideas on health care, let's be

00:17:00.533 --> 00:17:06.600
clear: I have. Bipartisanship --
not for its own sake but

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:12.900
to solve problems -- that's what
our constituents, the American
people, need from us right now.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.567
All of us then have a choice to
make. We have to choose whether
we're going to be politicians

00:17:17.567 --> 00:17:22.667
first or partners for progress;
whether we're going to put
success at the polls ahead of

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:29.533
the lasting success we can
achieve together for America.
Just think about it for a while.

00:17:29.533 --> 00:17:34.600
We don't have to put it up for a
vote today. Let me close by
saying this. I was not elected

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:41.567
by Democrats or Republicans, but
by the American people. That's
especially true because the

00:17:41.567 --> 00:17:49.166
fastest growing group of
Americans are independents. That
should tell us both something.

00:17:49.166 --> 00:17:54.867
I'm ready and eager to work with anyone who is willing to proceed in a spirit of goodwill.

00:17:54.867 --> 00:18:00.533
But understand, if we can't
break free from partisan
gridlock, if we can't move past

00:18:00.533 --> 00:18:06.033
a politics of "no," if resistance supplants

00:18:06.033 --> 00:18:11.533
constructive debate,
I still have to meet my responsibilities as President.

00:18:11.533 --> 00:18:16.433
I've got to act for the greater
good - because that, too, is a commitment that I have made.

00:18:16.433 --> 00:18:20.467
And that's -- that, too,
is what the American people sent me to Washington to do.

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:25.467
So I am optimistic.
I know many of you individually.

00:18:25.467 --> 00:18:32.900
And the irony, I think, of our
political climate right now is
that, compared to other

00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:34.066
countries, the differences

00:18:34.066 --> 00:18:43.800
between the two
major parties on most issues is
not as big as it's represented.

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:49.033
But we've gotten caught up in
the political game in a way
that's just not healthy.

00:18:49.033 --> 00:18:52.033
It's dividing our country in
ways that are preventing us from
meeting the challenges

00:18:52.033 --> 00:18:54.967
of the 21st century.

00:18:54.967 --> 00:18:58.900
I'm hopeful that the
conversation we have today can
help reverse that.

00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:03.066
So thank you very much. Thank
you, John. (applause.)

00:19:03.066 --> 00:19:11.834
Now I'd like to open
it up for questions.

00:19:11.834 --> 00:19:16.033
Congressman Pence:
The President has agreed

00:19:16.033 --> 00:19:17.600
to take questions and members
would be encouraged to raise
your hand while you

00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:21.033
remain in your seat.
(laughter.)

00:19:21.033 --> 00:19:27.567
The chair will take the prerogative to make
the first remarks.

00:19:27.567 --> 00:19:29.934
Mr. President, welcome back to the House Republican
Conference.

00:19:29.934 --> 00:19:31.100
Mr. President:
Thank you.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:31.500
Congressman Pence:
[Off microphone.] We are

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:40.667
pleased to have you return.
(Inaudible) a year ago -- House
Republicans said then we

00:19:40.667 --> 00:19:46.266
would make you two promises.
Number one, that most of the
people in this room and their

00:19:46.266 --> 00:19:49.800
families would pray for you and
your beautiful family just about
every day for the

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.100
next four years.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:54.467
And I want to assure you we're keeping that promise.

00:19:54.467 --> 00:19:55.667
Mr. President:
I appreciate that.

00:19:55.667 --> 00:19:56.467
Congressman Pence:
[off microphone] Number

00:19:56.467 --> 00:20:04.266
two, our pledge to you, Mr.
President, was that door is
always open. And we hope the

00:20:04.266 --> 00:20:14.266
(inaudible) of our invitation
that we (inaudible). Mr.
President, several of

00:20:14.266 --> 00:20:16.100
us in this conference

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:21.000
yesterday on the way into
Baltimore stopped by the
Salvation Army homeless facility

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.667
here in Baltimore.

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:26.967
I met a little
boy, an African American boy, in
the 8th grade, named David

00:20:26.967 --> 00:20:33.333
Carter, Jr. When he heard that I
would be seeing you today his
eyes lit up like I had

00:20:33.333 --> 00:20:40.700
never seen. And I told him that
if he wrote you a letter I'd
give it to you, and I have.

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:48.967
But I had a conversation with
little David, Jr. and David, Sr.
His family has been struggling

00:20:48.967 --> 00:20:52.266
with the economy. [On
microphone.] His dad
said words to me,

00:20:52.266 --> 00:21:00.400
Mr. President, that I'll never
forget. About my age and he said
-- he said, Congressman,

00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:09.900
it's not like it was when we
were coming up. He said, there's
just no jobs.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:19.367
Now, last year about the time
you met with us, unemployment
was 7.5 percent in this country.

00:21:19.367 --> 00:21:24.000
Your administration, and your
party in Congress, told us that
we'd have to borrow more than

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:32.967
$700 billion to pay for a
so-called stimulus bill. It was
a piecemeal list of projects

00:21:32.967 --> 00:21:39.567
and boutique tax cuts, all of
which was -- we were told -- had
to be passed or unemployment

00:21:39.567 --> 00:21:45.300
would go to 8 percent, as your
administration said. Well,
unemployment is 10 percent now,

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:51.100
as you well know, Mr. President;
here in Baltimore it's
considerably higher.

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:58.467
Now, Republicans offered a
stimulus bill at the same time.
It cost half as much as the

00:21:58.467 --> 00:22:02.900
Democratic proposal in Congress,
and using your economic analyst
models, it would have

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:11.900
created twice the jobs at half
the cost. It essentially was
across-the-board tax relief,

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.667
Mr. President.
Now we know you've come to Baltimore today

00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:22.066
and you've raised this tax
credit, which was last promoted
by President Jimmy Carter.

00:22:22.066 --> 00:22:29.300
But the first question I would
pose to you, very respectfully,
Mr. President, is would you

00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:37.300
be willing to consider embracing
-- in the name of little David
Carter, Jr. and his dad,

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.600
in the name of every struggling
family in this country -- the
kind of across-the-board

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:48.200
tax relief that Republicans have
advocated, that President
Kennedy advocated, that

00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:51.934
President Reagan
advocated and that has
always been the means of

00:22:51.934 --> 00:22:56.033
stimulating broad-based
economic growth?

00:22:56.033 --> 00:23:06.033
The President:
Well, there was a lot packed into that question.

00:23:06.033 --> 00:23:09.433
(laughter.)
First of all, let me say I
already promised that I'll be

00:23:09.433 --> 00:23:15.633
writing back to that young man
and his family, and I appreciate
you passing on the letter.

00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:16.967
Speaker:
Thank you.

00:23:16.967 --> 00:23:17.967
The President:
But let's talk

00:23:17.967 --> 00:23:22.800
about just the jobs
environment generally.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:23.667
You're absolutely

00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:40.200
right that when I was sworn in
the hope was that unemployment
would remain around 8 [percent],

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:43.000
or in the 8 percent range. That
was just based on the estimates
made by both conservative

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.500
and liberal economists, because
at that point not all the data
had trickled in.

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:56.433
We had lost 650,000 jobs in
December. I'm assuming you're
not faulting my policies for

00:23:56.433 --> 00:24:07.567
that. We had lost, it turns out,
700,000 jobs in January, the
month I was sworn in.

00:24:07.567 --> 00:24:08.834
I'm assuming it wasn't my

00:24:08.834 --> 00:24:15.734
administration's policies that
accounted for that. We lost
another 650,000

00:24:15.734 --> 00:24:21.767
jobs the subsequent month,
before any of my policies had
gone into effect.

00:24:21.767 --> 00:24:25.266
So I'm assuming that wasn't
as a consequence of

00:24:25.266 --> 00:24:31.100
our policies; that doesn't
reflect the failure of the
Recovery Act.

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:39.500
The point being that what
ended up happening was that the
job losses from this recession

00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:47.100
proved to be much more severe --
in the first quarter of last
year going into the second

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:55.500
quarter of last year -- than
anybody anticipated. So I mean,
I think we can score political

00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:02.300
points on the basis of the fact that we underestimated
how severe the job

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.467
losses were going to be.

00:25:04.467 --> 00:25:08.767
But those job losses took place
before any stimulus, whether it

00:25:08.767 --> 00:25:12.767
was the ones that you guys have proposed or the ones that we proposed,

00:25:12.767 --> 00:25:15.066
could have ever taken
into effect.

00:25:15.066 --> 00:25:16.600
Now, that's just
the fact, Mike, and

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.734
I don't think anybody would dispute that.

00:25:18.734 --> 00:25:23.000
You could not find an economist
who would dispute that.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.533
Now, at the same time, as I mentioned, most economists -- Republican and Democrat,

00:25:30.533 --> 00:25:32.900
liberal and conservative
-- would say that had it

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:41.200
not been for the stimulus
package that we passed, things
would be much worse.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:54.533
Now, they didn't fill a 7
million hole in the number of
people who were unemployed.

00:25:54.533 --> 00:25:57.800
They probably account for
about 2 million, which
means we still have 5

00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.667
million folks in
there that we've

00:25:59.667 --> 00:26:08.767
still got to deal with. That's a
lot of people. The package that
we put together at the beginning

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:13.800
of the year, the truth is, should have reflected
-- and I believe reflected what

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.600
most of you would say are
common sense things.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:25.667
This notion that this
was a radical package is
just not true.

00:26:25.667 --> 00:26:31.166
A third of them were tax
cuts, and they weren't -- when
you say they were "boutique"

00:26:31.166 --> 00:26:39.767
tax cuts, Mike, 95 percent of
working Americans got tax cuts,
small businesses got tax cuts,

00:26:39.767 --> 00:26:42.533
large businesses got help
in terms of their
depreciation schedules.

00:26:42.533 --> 00:26:43.533
I mean, it was a pretty

00:26:43.533 --> 00:26:49.133
conventional list of tax cuts. A
third of it was stabilizing
state budgets.

00:26:49.133 --> 00:26:55.967
There is not a single person in
here who, had it not been for
what was in the stimulus

00:26:55.967 --> 00:27:01.033
package, wouldn't be going home
to more teachers laid off, more
firefighters laid off, more

00:27:01.033 --> 00:27:10.300
cops laid off. A big chunk of it
was unemployment insurance and
COBRA, just making sure that

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:15.734
people had some floor beneath
them, and, by the way, making
sure that there was enough

00:27:15.734 --> 00:27:21.700
money in their pockets that
businesses had some customers.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:28.133
You take those two things out,
that accounts for the majority
of the stimulus package.

00:27:28.133 --> 00:27:37.500
Are there people in this room
who think that was a bad idea? A
portion of it was dealing

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:46.633
with the AMT, the alternative
minimum tax -- not a proposal of
mine; that's not a consequence

00:27:46.633 --> 00:27:53.900
of my policies that we have a
tax system where we keep on
putting off a potential tax hike

00:27:53.900 --> 00:28:00.433
that is embedded in the budget
that we have to fix each year.
That cost about $70 billion.

00:28:00.433 --> 00:28:04.700
And then the last portion of it
was infrastructure which, as I
said, a lot of you have gone to

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:11.400
appear at ribbon-cuttings for the same projects
that you voted against.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.367
Now, I say all this not to
re-litigate the past, but it's
simply to state that the

00:28:16.367 --> 00:28:20.066
component parts

00:28:20.066 --> 00:28:25.967
of the Recovery Act are
consistent with what many of you
say are important things

00:28:25.967 --> 00:28:29.200
to do -- rebuilding our infrastructure, tax
cuts for families and

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:32.200
businesses, and making

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:37.667
sure that we were providing
states and individuals some
support when the

00:28:37.667 --> 00:28:40.333
roof was caving in.

00:28:40.333 --> 00:28:47.700
And the notion that I would
somehow resist doing something
that cost half as much but

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:55.233
would produce twice as many jobs
-- why would I resist that?
I wouldn't. I mean, that's

00:28:55.233 --> 00:29:08.367
my point, is that -- I am not an
ideologue. I'm not. It doesn't
make sense if somebody

00:29:08.367 --> 00:29:15.533
could tell me you could
do this cheaper and get
increased results that

00:29:15.533 --> 00:29:17.533
I wouldn't say, great.

00:29:17.533 --> 00:29:21.934
The problem is, I couldn't
find credible economists
who would back up

00:29:21.934 --> 00:29:25.200
the claims that you just made.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:30.934
Now, we can -- here's what I know going forward, though.

00:29:30.934 --> 00:29:34.400
I mean, we're talking --
we were talking about the past.

00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:37.867
We can talk about
this going forward.

00:29:37.867 --> 00:29:45.100
I have looked at every
idea out there in terms of
accelerating job growth to match

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.700
the economic growth that's
already taken place. The jobs
credit that I'm discussing right

00:29:50.700 --> 00:29:57.967
now is one that a lot of people
think would be the most
cost-effective way for

00:29:57.967 --> 00:30:02.834
encouraging people to
pick up their hiring.

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:07.433
There may be other ideas
that you guys have;

00:30:07.433 --> 00:30:10.433
I am happy to look at them and
I'm happy to embrace them.

00:30:10.433 --> 00:30:13.000
I suspect I will embrace
some of them.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.467
Some of them I've
already embraced.

00:30:16.467 --> 00:30:19.867
But the question I think
we're going to have

00:30:19.867 --> 00:30:26.400
to ask ourselves is, as we move
forward, are we going to be
examining each of these issues

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:34.900
based on what's good for the
country, what the evidence tells
us, or are we going to

00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:43.633
be trying to position ourselves
so that come November we're able
to say, "The other party,

00:30:43.633 --> 00:30:46.000
it's their fault."

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.767
If we take the latter
approach then we're probably
not going to get much

00:30:48.767 --> 00:30:52.433
agreement. If we take the
former, I suspect there's going
to be a lot of overlap.

00:30:52.433 --> 00:30:53.233
All right?

00:30:53.233 --> 00:30:57.333
Speaker:
Mr. President, will you consider
supporting across-the-board tax

00:30:57.333 --> 00:31:00.800
relief, as President
Kennedy did?

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.300
The President:
Here's what I'm going to do,

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:06.533
Mike. What I'm going to do is
I'm going to take a look at what
you guys are proposing.

00:31:06.533 --> 00:31:16.767
And the reason I say this,
before you say, "Okay," I think
is important to know -- what

00:31:16.767 --> 00:31:22.767
you may consider
across-the-board tax cuts could
be, for example, greater

00:31:22.767 --> 00:31:31.266
tax cuts for people who are
making a billion dollars.

00:31:31.266 --> 00:31:35.867
I may not agree to a tax
cut for Warren Buffet.

00:31:35.867 --> 00:31:43.934
You may be calling for an
across-the-board tax cut for the
banking industry right now.

00:31:43.934 --> 00:31:49.867
I may not agree to that.
So I think that we've got to look at what

00:31:49.867 --> 00:31:55.333
specific proposals you're
putting forward, and -- this is
the last point I'll make --

00:31:55.333 --> 00:31:59.467
if you're calling for just
across-the-board tax cuts, and
then on the other hand saying

00:31:59.467 --> 00:32:05.367
that we're somehow going to
balance our budget, I'm going to
want to take a look at your math

00:32:05.367 --> 00:32:14.100
and see how that works, because
the issue of deficit and debt is
another area where

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:18.667
there has been a tendency for
some inconsistent statements.

00:32:18.667 --> 00:32:21.867
How's that? All right?

00:32:21.867 --> 00:32:28.967
Congressman Ryan:
Thank you. Mr. President, first off, thanks

00:32:28.967 --> 00:32:31.900
for agreeing to accept our invitation here.

00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:34.567
It is a real pleasure and honor to have you with us here today.

00:32:34.567 --> 00:32:37.633
The President:
Good to see you. Is this your crew right here, by the way?

00:32:37.633 --> 00:32:41.433
Congressman Ryan:
It is. This is my daughter Liza, my son Charlie and Sam, and

00:32:41.433 --> 00:32:42.033
this is my wife Janna.

00:32:42.033 --> 00:32:42.767
The President:
Hey, guys.

00:32:42.767 --> 00:32:43.734
Congressman Ryan:
Say hi, everybody.

00:32:43.734 --> 00:32:50.300
(laughter.)
I serve as a ranking
member of the budget

00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.633
committee, so I'm going to
talk a little budget if you
don't mind.

00:32:52.633 --> 00:32:54.300
The spending bills that
you've signed into

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:59.266
law, the domestic
discretionary spending has
been increased by 84 percent.

00:32:59.266 --> 00:33:04.100
You now want to freeze
spending at this elevated
beginning next year.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:05.600
This means that total

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:11.266
spending in your budget would
grow at 3/100ths of 1 percent
less than otherwise.

00:33:11.266 --> 00:33:18.033
I would simply submit that we
could do more and start now.

00:33:18.033 --> 00:33:19.467
You've also said that you want
to take a scalpel to the budget
and go through it line by line.

00:33:19.467 --> 00:33:21.233
We want to give you
that scalpel.

00:33:21.233 --> 00:33:23.533
I have a proposal with my home
state senator, Russ

00:33:23.533 --> 00:33:28.467
Feingold, bipartisan proposal,
to create a constitutional
version of the line-item veto.

00:33:28.467 --> 00:33:36.233
(applause.)

00:33:36.233 --> 00:33:38.567
Problem is, we can't even get
a vote on the proposal.

00:33:38.567 --> 00:33:42.400
So my question is, why not start
freezing spending now, and would
you support a line-item

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:46.934
veto in helping us get a
vote on it in the House?

00:33:46.934 --> 00:33:49.934
The President:
Let me respond to
the two specific questions,

00:33:49.934 --> 00:33:53.734
but I want to just push
back a little bit

00:33:53.734 --> 00:33:57.300
on the underlying premise
about us increasing
spending by 84 percent.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:04.133
Now, look, I talked to
Peter Orszag right

00:34:04.133 --> 00:34:10.000
before I came here, because I
suspected I'd be hearing this --
I'd be hearing this argument.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.100
The fact of the matter is, is
that most of the increases in
this year's budget, this

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:22.000
past year's budget, were not as
a consequence of policies that
we initiated but instead

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:29.200
were built in as a consequence
of the automatic stabilizers
that kick in because of

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.667
this enormous recession.

00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:35.333
So the increase in the budget for this past year was actually

00:34:35.333 --> 00:34:43.066
predicted before I was even
sworn into office and had initiated any policies.

00:34:43.066 --> 00:34:47.367
Whoever was in there, Paul --
and I don't think you'll dispute
that -- whoever was in

00:34:47.367 --> 00:34:53.300
there would have seen those same
increases because of, on the one
hand, huge drops in

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:58.133
revenue, but at the same
time people were hurting
and needed help.

00:34:58.133 --> 00:35:00.767
And a lot of these things happened automatically.

00:35:00.767 --> 00:35:08.567
Now, the reason that I'm not proposing the

00:35:08.567 --> 00:35:16.700
discretionary freeze take into
effect this year -- we prepared
a budget for 2010, it's

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:24.066
now going forward -- is, again,
I am just listening to the
consensus among people who

00:35:24.066 --> 00:35:34.000
know the economy best. And what
they will say is that if you
either increase taxes or

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.367
significantly lowered spending
when the economy remains
somewhat fragile, that that

00:35:41.367 --> 00:35:48.300
would have a destimulative
effect and potentially you'd see
a lot of folks losing business,

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:51.200
more folks potentially
losing jobs.

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.734
That would be a mistake when the
economy has not fully taken off.

00:35:56.734 --> 00:36:02.433
That's why I've proposed to do
it for the next fiscal year. So that's point number two.

00:36:02.433 --> 00:36:07.166
With respect to the line-item veto, I actually

00:36:07.166 --> 00:36:12.333
-- I think there's not a President out there
that wouldn't love to have it.

00:36:12.333 --> 00:36:15.834
And I think that this is an area
where we can have a serious
conversation.

00:36:15.834 --> 00:36:20.600
I know it is a
bipartisan proposal by
you and Russ Feingold.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:27.367
I don't like being held
up with big bills that
have stuff in

00:36:27.367 --> 00:36:32.333
them that are wasteful but I've
got to sign because it's a
defense authorization bill

00:36:32.333 --> 00:36:37.867
and I've got to make sure that
our troops are getting the
funding that they need.

00:36:37.867 --> 00:36:42.734
I will tell you, I would love
for Congress itself to show
discipline on both

00:36:42.734 --> 00:36:45.500
sides of the aisle.

00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:51.567
I think one thing
that you have to acknowledge,
Paul, because you study this

00:36:51.567 --> 00:36:55.166
stuff and take it pretty
seriously, that the earmarks
problem is not unique to one

00:36:55.166 --> 00:36:57.333
party and you end up
getting a lot of

00:36:57.333 --> 00:37:01.467
pushback when you start going
after specific projects of

00:37:01.467 --> 00:37:08.633
any one of you in your districts, because
wasteful spending is usually

00:37:08.633 --> 00:37:11.467
spent somehow outside
of your district.

00:37:11.467 --> 00:37:13.467
Have you noticed that? The spending in your district tends

00:37:13.467 --> 00:37:20.567
to seem pretty sensible.
So I would love to see more restraint within

00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:24.533
Congress. I'd like to work on
the earmarks reforms that I
mentioned in terms of putting

00:37:24.533 --> 00:37:28.633
earmarks online, because I think
sunshine is the best
disinfectant.

00:37:28.633 --> 00:37:32.667
But I am willing to have a
serious conversation on the
line-item veto issue.

00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:35.934
Congressman Ryan:
I'd like to walk you through that, because

00:37:35.934 --> 00:37:37.000
we have a version we
think is constitutional.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
The President:
Let me take a look at it.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:41.333
Congressman Ryan:
I would simply say that automatic stabilizer

00:37:41.333 --> 00:37:43.500
spending is mandatory
spending.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.266
The discretionary
spending, the bills

00:37:45.266 --> 00:37:51.367
that Congress signs that
you sign into law, that has increased 84 percent.

00:37:51.367 --> 00:37:57.700
The President:
We'll have a longer debate on the budget numbers, all right?

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:03.600
Congressman Pence:
Shelley Moore Capito,
West Virginia.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.700
Congresswoman Mato:
Thank you, Mr. President, for
joining us here today.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:08.500
As you said in the
State of the Union

00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:11.934
address on Wednesday, jobs and
the economy are number one.

00:38:11.934 --> 00:38:15.667
And I think everyone in this room, certainly I, agree with you on that.

00:38:15.667 --> 00:38:17.233
I represent the
state of West Virginia.

00:38:17.233 --> 00:38:18.467
We're resource-rich.

00:38:18.467 --> 00:38:20.900
We have a lot of coal and
a lot of natural gas.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:24.166
But our -- my miners and the folks who are working and

00:38:24.166 --> 00:38:26.800
those who are unemployed are
very concerned about some of

00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:30.800
your policies in these areas:
cap and trade, an aggressive

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:34.967
EPA, and the looming prospect of higher taxes.

00:38:34.967 --> 00:38:37.934
In our minds, these are job-killing policies.

00:38:37.934 --> 00:38:41.700
So I'm asking you if
you would be willing

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:46.800
to re-look at some of
these policies, with a high
unemployment and the unsure

00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:50.133
economy that we have now, to assure West Virginians that you're listening.

00:38:50.133 --> 00:38:52.867
The President:
Look, I listen all
the time, including to

00:38:52.867 --> 00:39:01.100
your governor, who's somebody
who I enjoyed working with a lot
before the campaign and

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:06.233
now that I'm President. And I
know that West Virginia
struggles with unemployment, and

00:39:06.233 --> 00:39:14.166
I know how important coal is to
West Virginia and a lot of the
natural resources there.

00:39:14.166 --> 00:39:19.834
That's part of the reason why
I've said that we need a
comprehensive energy policy that

00:39:19.834 --> 00:39:25.700
sets us up for a long-term
future. For example, nobody has
been a bigger promoter

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:32.600
of clean coal technology than I
am. Testament to that, I ended
up being in a whole bunch

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:38.767
of advertisements that you guys
saw all the time about investing
in ways for us to burn

00:39:38.767 --> 00:39:47.233
coal more cleanly. I've said
that I'm a promoter of
nuclear energy,

00:39:47.233 --> 00:39:53.000
something that I think over the
last three decades has been
subject to a lot of

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.133
partisan wrangling and ideological wrangling.

00:39:56.133 --> 00:39:59.500
I don't think it makes
sense. I think that that has

00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:04.100
to be part of our energy mix.
I've said that I am supportive
-- and I said this two nights

00:40:04.100 --> 00:40:08.400
ago at the State of the Union --
that I am in favor of increased
production.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:17.033
So if you look at the ideas that
this caucus has, again with
respect to energy, I'm for

00:40:17.033 --> 00:40:24.266
a lot of what you said you are
for. The one thing that I've
also said, though,

00:40:24.266 --> 00:40:28.667
and here we have a serious
disagreement and my hope is we
can work through these

00:40:28.667 --> 00:40:31.533
disagreements -- there's
going to be an effort

00:40:31.533 --> 00:40:35.967
on the Senate side to do so on a
bipartisan basis -- is

00:40:35.967 --> 00:40:43.266
that we have to plan for the
future. And the future is that
clean energy -- cleaner

00:40:43.266 --> 00:40:52.533
forms of energy are going to be
increasingly important, because
even if folks are still

00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:56.767
skeptical in some cases about
climate change in our politics

00:40:56.767 --> 00:41:01.066
and in Congress, the world is not skeptical about it.

00:41:01.066 --> 00:41:04.533
If we're going to be
after some of these big
markets, they're

00:41:04.533 --> 00:41:08.066
going to be looking to see, is
the United States the one that's

00:41:08.066 --> 00:41:09.333
developing clean
coal technology?

00:41:09.333 --> 00:41:16.767
Is the United States developing
our natural gas resources in the most effective way?

00:41:16.767 --> 00:41:22.633
Is the United States the one
that is going to lead in
electric cars?

00:41:22.633 --> 00:41:23.734
Because if we're not

00:41:23.734 --> 00:41:26.100
leading, those
other countries are
going to be leading.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:33.600
So what I want to do is work
with West Virginia to figure out
how we can seize that future.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.100
But to do that, that means
there's going to have to
be some transition.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:45.433
We can't operate the coal industry in the United
States as if we're still in the

00:41:45.433 --> 00:41:48.166
1920s or the 1930s or the 1950s.

00:41:48.166 --> 00:41:54.633
We've got to be thinking what
does that industry look like
in the next hundred years.

00:41:54.633 --> 00:41:55.700
And it's going to
be different.

00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:57.800
And that means there's going to be some transition.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:05.433
And that's where I think a
well-thought-through policy of
incentivizing the

00:42:05.433 --> 00:42:08.700
new while recognizing

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:14.233
that there's going to be a
transition process -- and we're
not just suddenly putting the

00:42:14.233 --> 00:42:18.834
old out of business right away
-- that has to be something that
both Republicans and

00:42:18.834 --> 00:42:22.367
Democrats should be able
to embrace.

00:42:22.367 --> 00:42:31.000
Congressman Pence:
Jason Chaffetz, Utah.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.467
Congressman Chaffetz:
Thank you, Mr. President.
It's truly an honor.

00:42:33.467 --> 00:42:35.166
The President:
Great to be here.
Congressman Chaffetz

00:42:35.166 --> 00:42:40.500
And I appreciate you being
here. I'm one of 22 House
freshmen. We didn't create

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:49.200
this mess, but we are here to
help clean it up. You talked a
lot about this deficit of trust.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.400
There's some things that have
happened that I would appreciate
your perspective on,

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:57.734
because I can look you in the
eye and tell you we have not
been obstructionists.

00:42:57.734 --> 00:43:01.567
Democrats have the House and Senate and the presidency.
And when you stood up before the

00:43:01.567 --> 00:43:06.033
American people multiple times
and said you would broadcast the
health care debates

00:43:06.033 --> 00:43:08.533
on C-SPAN, you didn't.

00:43:08.533 --> 00:43:12.033
And I was disappointed, and I
think a lot of Americans were
disappointed.

00:43:12.033 --> 00:43:15.033
You said you weren't going to
allow lobbyists in the
senior-most positions

00:43:15.033 --> 00:43:16.333
within your administration,

00:43:16.333 --> 00:43:22.100
and yet you did. I applauded you
when you said it -- and
disappointed when you didn't.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:26.000
You said you'd go line by line
through the health care debate
-- or through the health

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:31.066
care bill. And there were six of
us, including Dr. Phil Roe, who
sent you a letter and said,

00:43:31.066 --> 00:43:34.734
"We would like to take you up on
the offer; we'd like to come."
We never heard a letter,

00:43:34.734 --> 00:43:38.834
we never got a call. We were
never involved in any of those
discussions.

00:43:38.834 --> 00:43:43.333
And when you said in the House
of Representatives that you were
going to tackle earmarks --

00:43:43.333 --> 00:43:46.734
in fact, you didn't want to have
any earmarks in any of your
bills -- I jumped up out of

00:43:46.734 --> 00:43:51.467
my seat and applauded you.
But it didn't happen.

00:43:51.467 --> 00:43:55.066
More importantly, I want to talk about moving forward, but if
we could address --

00:43:55.066 --> 00:43:58.066
The President:
Well, how about --
Congressman Chaffetz:

00:43:58.066 --> 00:43:59.600
-- I would certainly
appreciate it.

00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.467
The President:
That was a long list, so --
(laughter) -- let me respond.

00:44:02.467 --> 00:44:12.633
Look, the truth of the matter is
that if you look at the health
care process -- just over

00:44:12.633 --> 00:44:19.066
the course of the year --
overwhelmingly the majority of
it actually was on C-SPAN,

00:44:19.066 --> 00:44:20.100
because it was taking place

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:24.133
in congressional hearings
in which you guys were participating. I mean,

00:44:24.133 --> 00:44:33.200
how many committees were there
that helped to shape this bill?
Countless hearings took place.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:37.600
Now, I kicked it off, by the way, with a meeting

00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:45.500
with many of you, including your
key leadership. What is true,
there's no doubt about it, is

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:54.700
that once it got through the
committee process and there were
now a series of meetings taking

00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:58.934
place all over the Capitol
trying to figure out how to get
the thing together -- that

00:44:58.934 --> 00:45:04.200
was a messy process. And I take
responsibility for not having
structured it in a way where

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:14.233
it was all taking place in one
place that could be filmed. How
to do that logistically

00:45:14.233 --> 00:45:20.500
would not have been as easy as
it sounds, because you're
shuttling back and forth between

00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:26.233
the House, the Senate,
different offices, et cetera,
different legislators.

00:45:26.233 --> 00:45:28.700
But I think it's a
legitimate criticism.

00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.533
So on that one, I take responsibility.

00:45:31.533 --> 00:45:39.166
With respect to earmarks, we didn't have earmarks
in the Recovery Act.

00:45:39.166 --> 00:45:44.066
We didn't get a lot of credit
for it, but there were no
earmarks in that.

00:45:44.066 --> 00:45:50.200
I was confronted
at the beginning

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.367
of my term with an omnibus
package that did have a lot of
earmarks from Republicans and

00:45:53.367 --> 00:45:58.133
Democrats, and a lot of
people in this chamber.
And the question was

00:45:58.133 --> 00:45:59.000
whether I was going to

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.433
have a big budget fight, at a
time when I was still trying to
figure out whether or

00:46:02.433 --> 00:46:09.033
not the financial system was
melting down and we had to make
a whole bunch of emergency

00:46:09.033 --> 00:46:16.266
decisions about the economy. So
what I said was let's keep them
to a minimum, but I couldn't

00:46:16.266 --> 00:46:18.734
excise them all.
Now, the challenge I guess I would have for

00:46:18.734 --> 00:46:32.600
you as a freshman, is what are
you doing inside your caucus to
make sure that I'm not the

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:37.600
only guy who is responsible for
this stuff, so that we're
working together, because this

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:45.467
is going to be a process?
When we talk about earmarks, I think all of

00:46:45.467 --> 00:46:49.667
us are willing to acknowledge
that some of them are perfectly
defensible, good projects;

00:46:49.667 --> 00:46:50.200
it's just they haven't

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.300
gone through the regular
appropriations process in the full light of day.

00:46:53.300 --> 00:46:58.333
So one place to start is to
make sure that they are at least
transparent, that everybody

00:46:58.333 --> 00:47:06.533
knows what's there before we
move forward. In terms of
lobbyists, I can stand

00:47:06.533 --> 00:47:08.734
here unequivocally

00:47:08.734 --> 00:47:14.734
and say that there has not
been an administration who was
tougher on making

00:47:14.734 --> 00:47:21.266
sure that lobbyists

00:47:21.266 --> 00:47:24.100
weren't participating in
the administration than any
administration that's

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:24.367
come before us.

00:47:24.367 --> 00:47:26.700
Now, what we did was, if there were lobbyists

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:31.266
who were on boards and commissions that were
carryovers and their term hadn't

00:47:31.266 --> 00:47:32.900
been completed,

00:47:32.900 --> 00:47:36.367
we didn't kick them off. We
simply said that moving forward
any time a new slot opens,

00:47:36.367 --> 00:47:40.967
they're being replaced.
So we've actually been very consistent in

00:47:40.967 --> 00:47:49.700
making sure that we are
eliminating the impact of
lobbyists, day in, day

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:50.967
out, on how this

00:47:50.967 --> 00:47:55.967
administration operates. There
have been a handful of waivers
where somebody is highly

00:47:55.967 --> 00:48:03.533
skilled -- for example, a doctor
who ran Tobacco-Free Kids
technically is a

00:48:03.533 --> 00:48:05.066
registered lobbyist;

00:48:05.066 --> 00:48:09.467
on the other end, has more
experience than anybody in
figuring out how kids don't get

00:48:09.467 --> 00:48:12.800
hooked on cigarettes.
So there have been a couple of instances like

00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:20.900
that, but generally we've been very consistent
on that front.

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:31.300
Congressman Pence:
Marsha Blackburn, Tennessee.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:31.934
Congressman Blackburn:
Thank you, Mr. President,
and thank you for

00:48:31.934 --> 00:48:36.100
acknowledging that we have
ideas on health care because,
indeed, we do have ideas, we

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:42.133
have plans, we have
over 50 bills, we have
lots of amendments that

00:48:42.133 --> 00:48:43.367
would bring health

00:48:43.367 --> 00:48:48.333
care ideas to the forefront. We
would -- we've got plans to
lower cost, to change purchasing

00:48:48.333 --> 00:48:53.834
models, address medical
liability, insurance
accountability, chronic and

00:48:53.834 --> 00:48:55.600
preexisting conditions,

00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:04.033
and access to affordable care
for those with those conditions,
insurance portability, expanded

00:49:04.033 --> 00:49:13.567
access -- but not doing it with
creating more government, more
bureaucracy, and more cost

00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:18.934
for the American taxpayer.
And we look forward to
sharing those ideas

00:49:18.934 --> 00:49:25.800
with you. We want to work with
you on health reform and making
certain that we do it in

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:31.266
an affordable, cost-effective
way that is going to reduce
bureaucracy, reduce government

00:49:31.266 --> 00:49:38.700
interference, and reduce costs
to individuals and to taxpayers.
And if those good ideas

00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:43.467
aren't making it to you, maybe
it's the House Democrat
leadership that is an impediment

00:49:43.467 --> 00:49:44.533
instead of a conduit.
But we're concerned also
that there are some

00:49:44.533 --> 00:49:47.367
lessons learned from public
option health care plans that
maybe are not being heeded.

00:49:47.367 --> 00:50:03.667
And certainly in my state of
Tennessee, we were the test case
for public option health

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:11.967
care in 1994, and our Democrat
government has even cautioned
that maybe our experiences

00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:18.066
there would provide some lessons
learned that should be heeded,
and would provide guidance

00:50:18.066 --> 00:50:25.700
for us to go forward. And as you
said, what we should be doing is
tossing old ideas out,

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:32.900
bad ideas out, and moving
forward in refining good ideas.
And certainly we would

00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.333
welcome that opportunity.

00:50:34.333 --> 00:50:38.667
So my question
to you is, when will we look

00:50:38.667 --> 00:50:45.900
forward to starting anew and
sitting down with you to put all
of these ideas on the

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:52.500
table, to look at these lessons
learned, to benefit from that
experience, and to produce

00:50:52.500 --> 00:51:00.967
a product that is going to
reduce government interference,
reduce cost, and be fair to

00:51:00.967 --> 00:51:10.667
the American taxpayer?
(applause.)

00:51:10.667 --> 00:51:12.800
The President:
Actually, I've
gotten many of your ideas.

00:51:12.800 --> 00:51:17.734
I've taken a look at them,
even before I was handed this.

00:51:17.734 --> 00:51:25.033
Some of the ideas we have embraced in our package.

00:51:25.033 --> 00:51:27.834
Some of them are
embraced with caveats.

00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:30.066
So let me give you an example.

00:51:30.066 --> 00:51:34.867
I think one of the proposals
that has been focused on by the
Republicans as a way to

00:51:34.867 --> 00:51:36.967
reduce costs is allowing

00:51:36.967 --> 00:51:42.934
insurance companies
to sell across state lines. We actually include

00:51:42.934 --> 00:51:49.200
that as part of our approach.
But the caveat is, we've got
to do so with some

00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:50.333
minimum standards,

00:51:50.333 --> 00:51:57.033
because otherwise what happens
is that you could have insurance
companies circumvent

00:51:57.033 --> 00:52:05.633
a whole bunch of state regulations about basic
benefits or what have you,

00:52:05.633 --> 00:52:07.033
making sure that

00:52:07.033 --> 00:52:15.767
a woman is able to get
mammograms as part of preventive
care, for example. Part of what

00:52:15.767 --> 00:52:21.700
could happen is insurance
companies could go into states
and cherry-pick and just get

00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:28.533
those who are healthiest and
leave behind those who are least
healthy, which would raise

00:52:28.533 --> 00:52:34.900
everybody's premiums who weren't
healthy, right?

00:52:34.900 --> 00:52:37.500
So it's not that many of these
ideas aren't workable, but

00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.834
we have to refine them to make
sure that they don't just end up
worsening the situation

00:52:41.834 --> 00:52:45.800
for folks rather than
making it better.

00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:50.433
Now, what I said at the
State of the Union

00:52:50.433 --> 00:52:57.433
is what I still believe: If you
can show me -- and if I get
confirmation from health

00:52:57.433 --> 00:53:05.433
care experts, people who know
the system and how it works,
including doctors and nurses

00:53:05.433 --> 00:53:12.500
-- ways of reducing people's
premiums; covering those who do
not have insurance; making it

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:21.900
more affordable for small
businesses; having insurance
reforms that ensure people have

00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:25.533
insurance even when they've got
preexisting conditions, that
their coverage is not dropped

00:53:25.533 --> 00:53:31.767
just because they're sick, that
young people right out of
college or as they're entering

00:53:31.767 --> 00:53:37.100
in the workforce can still get
health insurance -- if those
component parts are things that

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:45.567
you care about and want to do,
I'm game. And I've got -- and
I've got a lot of these ideas.

00:53:45.567 --> 00:53:51.233
The last thing I will say,
though -- let me say this about
health care and the health

00:53:51.233 --> 00:53:58.266
care debate, because I think it
also bears on a whole lot of
other issues. If you look

00:53:58.266 --> 00:54:06.567
at the package that we've
presented -- and there's some
stray cats and dogs that got

00:54:06.567 --> 00:54:10.200
in there that we were
eliminating, we were in the
process of eliminating.

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:14.433
For example,

00:54:14.433 --> 00:54:26.200
we said from the start that it
was going to be important for us
to be consistent in saying

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:31.934
to people if you can have your
-- if you want to keep the
health insurance you got, you

00:54:31.934 --> 00:54:36.233
can keep it, that you're not
going to have anybody getting in
between you and your doctor

00:54:36.233 --> 00:54:40.934
in your decision making.
And I think that some of
the provisions that got

00:54:40.934 --> 00:54:42.800
snuck in might

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.500
have violated that pledge.
And so we were in the
process of scrubbing

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:54.100
this and making sure that it's
tight. But at its core, if you
look at the basic proposal

00:54:54.100 --> 00:55:01.800
that we've put forward: it has
an exchange so that businesses
and the self-employed can

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:08.000
buy into a pool and can get
bargaining power the same way
big companies do; the insurance

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:14.033
reforms that I've already
discussed, making sure that
there's choice and competition

00:55:14.033 --> 00:55:18.200
for those who don't have
health insurance.

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:23.166
The component parts of this
thing are pretty similar to what

00:55:23.166 --> 00:55:29.000
Howard Baker, Bob Dole, and
Tom Daschle proposed at the

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.834
beginning of this
debate last year.

00:55:31.834 --> 00:55:36.734
Now, you may not agree with Bob
Dole and Howard Baker, and,

00:55:36.734 --> 00:55:40.300
certainly you don't agree
with Tom Daschle on much,

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:43.600
but that's not a radical bunch.

00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:47.734
But if you were to listen
to the debate and, frankly,

00:55:47.734 --> 00:55:50.667
how some of you went
after this bill,

00:55:50.667 --> 00:55:57.000
you'd think that this thing
was some Bolshevik plot.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.066
No, I mean, that's how you guys
- (applause) -- that's how you

00:56:00.066 --> 00:56:01.533
guys presented it.

00:56:01.533 --> 00:56:05.900
And so I'm thinking
to myself, well,

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:15.367
how is it that a plan that is
pretty centrist -- no, look,

00:56:15.367 --> 00:56:18.533
I mean, I'm just saying,
I know you guys disagree,

00:56:18.533 --> 00:56:24.367
but if you look at the
facts of this bill,

00:56:24.367 --> 00:56:29.400
most independent observers would
say this is actually what many

00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:34.033
Republicans -- is similar to
what many Republicans proposed

00:56:34.033 --> 00:56:39.300
to Bill Clinton when he was
doing his debate on health care.

00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:44.934
So all I'm saying is, we've got
to close the gap a little bit

00:56:44.934 --> 00:56:49.367
between the rhetoric
and the reality.

00:56:49.367 --> 00:56:52.000
I'm not suggesting that we're
going to agree on everything,

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.834
whether it's on health care
or energy or what have you,

00:56:54.834 --> 00:56:59.900
but if the way these issues
are being presented by the

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:07.900
Republicans is that this is some
wild-eyed plot to impose huge

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.867
government in every
aspect of our lives,

00:57:10.867 --> 00:57:13.300
what happens is you guys then
don't have a lot of room to

00:57:13.300 --> 00:57:15.633
negotiate with me.

00:57:15.633 --> 00:57:18.667
I mean, the fact of the matter
is, is that many of you,

00:57:18.667 --> 00:57:22.333
if you voted with the
administration on something,

00:57:22.333 --> 00:57:27.734
are politically vulnerable
in your own base,

00:57:27.734 --> 00:57:30.600
in your own party.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:33.734
You've given yourselves very
little room to work in a

00:57:33.734 --> 00:57:37.233
bipartisan fashion because
what you've been telling your

00:57:37.233 --> 00:57:42.166
constituents is, this guy is
doing all kinds of crazy stuff

00:57:42.166 --> 00:57:44.633
that's going to destroy America.

00:57:44.633 --> 00:57:48.633
And I would just say that we
have to think about tone.

00:57:48.633 --> 00:57:52.233
It's not just on your side, by
the way -- it's on our side,

00:57:52.233 --> 00:57:53.166
as well.

00:57:53.166 --> 00:57:56.100
This is part of what's
happened in our politics,

00:57:56.100 --> 00:57:59.033
where we demonize the other side
so much that when it comes to

00:57:59.033 --> 00:58:04.400
actually getting things
done, it becomes tough to do.

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.667
Mike.

00:58:06.667 --> 00:58:08.467
Congressman Pence:
Dr. Tom Price from Georgia,

00:58:08.467 --> 00:58:10.967
and then we'll have one more
after that if your time permits,

00:58:10.967 --> 00:58:11.867
Mr. President.

00:58:11.867 --> 00:58:13.066
The President:
You know, I'm having fun.

00:58:13.066 --> 00:58:14.533
(laughter.)

00:58:14.533 --> 00:58:14.967
Congressman
Pence: Okay.

00:58:14.967 --> 00:58:15.800
The President:
This is great.

00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:16.567
(applause.)

00:58:16.567 --> 00:58:20.900
Congressman Pence:
So are we.

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.000
Congressman Pence:
Mr. President, thank you.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.266
I want to stick on the
general topic of health care,

00:58:25.266 --> 00:58:27.834
but ask a very
specific question.

00:58:27.834 --> 00:58:30.934
You have repeatedly said, most
recently at the State of the

00:58:30.934 --> 00:58:35.433
Union, that Republicans have
offered no ideas

00:58:35.433 --> 00:58:37.734
and no solutions.

00:58:37.734 --> 00:58:39.200
In spite of the fact --

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:40.233
The President:
I don't think I said that.

00:58:40.233 --> 00:58:46.166
What I said was, within the
context of health care -- I

00:58:46.166 --> 00:58:47.533
remember that
speech pretty well,

00:58:47.533 --> 00:58:50.834
it was only two days ago --
(laughter) -- I said I welcome

00:58:50.834 --> 00:58:52.433
ideas that you might provide.

00:58:52.433 --> 00:58:54.400
I didn't say that you
haven't provided ideas.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.100
I said I welcome those
ideas that you'll provide.

00:58:57.100 --> 00:58:59.533
Congressman Pence:
Mr. President, multiple times,

00:58:59.533 --> 00:59:02.467
from your administration, there
have come statements that

00:59:02.467 --> 00:59:04.567
Republicans have no
ideas and no solutions.

00:59:04.567 --> 00:59:07.867
In spite of the fact that we've
offered, as demonstrated today,

00:59:07.867 --> 00:59:11.166
positive solutions to all
of the challenges we face,

00:59:11.166 --> 00:59:13.967
including energy and the
economy and health care,

00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:17.066
specifically in the area of
health care -- this bill,

00:59:17.066 --> 00:59:19.967
H.R.3400, that has more
co-sponsors than any health care

00:59:19.967 --> 00:59:23.567
bill in the House, is a bill
that would provide health

00:59:23.567 --> 00:59:27.667
coverage for all Americans;
would correct the significant

00:59:27.667 --> 00:59:31.500
insurance challenges of
affordability and preexisting;

00:59:31.500 --> 00:59:33.367
would solve the
lawsuit abuse issue,

00:59:33.367 --> 00:59:35.633
which isn't addressed
significantly in the other

00:59:35.633 --> 00:59:38.500
proposals that went through
the House and the Senate;

00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:41.433
would write into law that
medical decisions are made

00:59:41.433 --> 00:59:44.033
between patients and
families and doctors;

00:59:44.033 --> 00:59:48.200
and does all of that without
raising taxes by a penny.

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:52.667
But my specific question
is, what should we tell our

00:59:52.667 --> 00:59:57.367
constituents who know that
Republicans have offered

00:59:57.367 --> 01:00:01.200
positive solutions to the
challenges that Americans face

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.467
and yet continue to hear out of
the administration that

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:05.100
we've offered nothing?

01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:10.133
The President:
Tom, look, I have to say
that on the -- let's

01:00:10.133 --> 01:00:11.433
just take the
health care debate.

01:00:11.433 --> 01:00:14.100
And it's probably not
constructive for us to try to

01:00:14.100 --> 01:00:21.734
debate a particular bill --
this isn't the venue to do it.

01:00:21.734 --> 01:00:27.266
But if you say, "We can offer
coverage for all Americans,

01:00:27.266 --> 01:00:31.734
and it won't cost a penny,"
that's just not true.

01:00:31.734 --> 01:00:36.867
You can't structure a bill where
suddenly 30 million people have

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:42.600
coverage, and it costs nothing.

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:47.333
If -- Congressman Pence:
Mr. President,

01:00:47.333 --> 01:00:49.200
can I -- and I understand that
we're not interested in debating

01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.066
this bill, but what should we
tell our constituents who know

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:55.400
that we've offered these
solutions and yet hear from the

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:59.233
administration that we
have offered nothing.

01:00:59.233 --> 01:01:01.700
The President:
Let me -- I'm using
this as a specific

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.233
example, so let me
answer your question.

01:01:03.233 --> 01:01:06.600
You asked a question;
I want to answer it.

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:10.200
It's not enough if
you say, for example,

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:17.667
that we've offered a health care
plan and I look up -- this is

01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:22.800
just under the section that
you've just provided me,

01:01:22.800 --> 01:01:29.934
or the book that you just
provided me -- summary of GOP

01:01:29.934 --> 01:01:34.967
health care reform bill: The
GOP plan will lower health care

01:01:34.967 --> 01:01:38.433
premiums for American families
and small businesses,

01:01:38.433 --> 01:01:42.133
addressing America's number-one
priority for health reform.

01:01:42.133 --> 01:01:46.166
I mean, that's an idea
that we all embrace.

01:01:46.166 --> 01:01:48.700
But specifically
it's got to work.

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:54.300
I mean, there's got to be a
mechanism in these plans that I

01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.033
can go to an independent
health care expert and say,

01:01:58.033 --> 01:02:02.300
is this something that
will actually work,

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.567
or is it boilerplate?

01:02:06.567 --> 01:02:12.567
If I'm told, for example, that
the solution to dealing with

01:02:12.567 --> 01:02:15.934
health care costs
is tort reform,

01:02:15.934 --> 01:02:20.433
something that I've said I am
willing to work with you on,

01:02:20.433 --> 01:02:27.600
but the CBO or other
experts say to me, at best,

01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:31.000
this could reduce health care
costs relative to where they're

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.800
growing by a couple
of percentage points,

01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.367
or save $5 billion a year,
that's what we can score it at,

01:02:40.367 --> 01:02:45.633
and it will not bend the cost
curve long term or reduce

01:02:45.633 --> 01:02:50.767
premiums significantly -- then
you can't make the claim that

01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:54.467
that's the only thing
that we have to do.

01:02:54.467 --> 01:03:00.734
If we're going to do multi-state
insurance so that people can go

01:03:00.734 --> 01:03:03.967
across state lines, I've got to
be able to go to an independent

01:03:03.967 --> 01:03:09.533
health care expert,
Republican or Democrat,

01:03:09.533 --> 01:03:13.700
who can tell me that this won't
result in cherry-picking of the

01:03:13.700 --> 01:03:20.333
healthiest going to some and the
least healthy being worse off.

01:03:20.333 --> 01:03:25.133
So I am absolutely committed
to working with you on these

01:03:25.133 --> 01:03:31.967
issues, but it can't just be
political assertions that aren't

01:03:31.967 --> 01:03:36.800
substantiated when it comes to
the actual details of policy.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.033
Because otherwise, we're going
to be selling the American

01:03:39.033 --> 01:03:41.500
people a bill of goods.

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.300
I mean, the easiest thing for me
to do on the health care debate

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:51.700
would have been to tell people
that what you're going to get is

01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:56.433
guaranteed health insurance,
lower your costs,

01:03:56.433 --> 01:03:59.600
all the insurance reforms; we're
going to lower the costs of

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:06.600
Medicare and Medicaid and it
won't cost anybody anything.

01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.000
That's great politics,
it's just not true.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.333
So there's got to be some test
of realism in any of these

01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:16.567
proposals, mine included.

01:04:16.567 --> 01:04:17.867
I've got to hold
myself accountable,

01:04:17.867 --> 01:04:21.500
and guaranteed the American
people will hold themselves --

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.300
will hold me accountable if what
I'm selling doesn't

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.500
actually deliver.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.166
Congressman Pence:
Mr. President,

01:04:29.166 --> 01:04:32.667
a point of clarification, what's
in the Better Solutions book are

01:04:32.667 --> 01:04:35.000
all the legislative proposals
that were offered --

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:35.600
The President:
I understand that.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.400
I've actually read your bills.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:38.300
Congressman Price:
throughout 2009.

01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.033
The President:
I understand.

01:04:39.033 --> 01:04:41.000
Congressman Price:
And so, rest assured the
summary document you

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.333
received is backed up by
precisely the kind of detailed

01:04:44.333 --> 01:04:48.200
legislation that Speaker Pelosi
and your administration have

01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:50.600
been busy ignoring
for 12 months.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.333
The President:
Well, Mike -- well, hold on, hold on a second.

01:04:52.333 --> 01:04:54.734
No, no, no, no.

01:04:54.734 --> 01:04:57.166
Hold on a second, guys.

01:04:57.166 --> 01:05:04.000
(applause.) You know, Mike,
I've read your legislation.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.834
I mean, I take a look at this
stuff -- and the good

01:05:07.834 --> 01:05:09.567
ideas we take.

01:05:09.567 --> 01:05:13.734
But here's -- here's the thing
-- here's the thing that I guess

01:05:13.734 --> 01:05:17.867
all of us have to be mindful
of, it can't be all or nothing,

01:05:17.867 --> 01:05:22.767
one way or the other.

01:05:22.767 --> 01:05:26.767
And what I mean by that is this:
If we put together a stimulus

01:05:26.767 --> 01:05:30.700
package in which a third of it
are tax cuts that normally you

01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:39.667
guys would support, and support
for states and the unemployed,

01:05:39.667 --> 01:05:43.200
and helping people stay on COBRA
that your governors certainly

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:46.367
would support --
Democrat or a Republican;

01:05:46.367 --> 01:05:48.266
and then you've got
some infrastructure,

01:05:48.266 --> 01:05:50.066
and maybe there's some things
in there that you don't like in

01:05:50.066 --> 01:05:53.066
terms of infrastructure, or you
think the bill should have been

01:05:53.066 --> 01:05:55.700
$500 billion instead of $700
billion or there's this

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:59.967
provision or that provision
that you don't like.

01:05:59.967 --> 01:06:06.800
If there's uniform opposition
because the Republican caucus

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:14.900
doesn't get 100 percent or
80 percent of what you want,

01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:17.800
then it's going to be
hard to get a deal done.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:22.533
That's because that's
not how democracy works.

01:06:22.533 --> 01:06:27.934
So my hope would be that we can
look at some of these component

01:06:27.934 --> 01:06:32.200
parts of what we're doing and
maybe we break some of them up

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:34.400
on different policy issues.

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:41.600
So if the good congressman from
Utah has a particular issue on

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:45.133
lobbying reform that he
wants to work with us on,

01:06:45.133 --> 01:06:48.066
we may not able to agree on
a comprehensive package on

01:06:48.066 --> 01:06:51.200
everything but there may be some
component parts that

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.867
we can work on.

01:06:52.867 --> 01:06:57.500
You may not support our
overall jobs package,

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:02.600
but if you look at the tax
credit that we're proposing for

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.500
small businesses right now, it
is consistent with a lot of what

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:09.100
you guys have said in the past.

01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.133
And just the fact that it's my
administration that's proposing

01:07:12.133 --> 01:07:14.800
it shouldn't prevent
you from supporting it.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:15.867
That's my point.

01:07:15.867 --> 01:07:16.700
Congressman Pence:
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:21.300
Peter Roskam from the
great state of Illinois.

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:22.300
The President:
Oh, Peter is an
old friend of mine.

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.200
Congressman Roskan:
Hey, Mr. President.

01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.500
The President:
Peter and I have had
many debates.

01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.667
Congressman Roskan:
Well, this won't be one.

01:07:27.667 --> 01:07:30.934
Mr. President, I heard echoes
today of the state senator that

01:07:30.934 --> 01:07:34.266
I served with in Springfield and
there was an attribute and a

01:07:34.266 --> 01:07:38.900
characteristic that you had that
I think served you well there.

01:07:38.900 --> 01:07:46.266
You took on some very
controversial subjects -- death penalty reform -- you and I --

01:07:46.266 --> 01:07:46.834
The President:
Sure.

01:07:46.834 --> 01:07:47.600
We worked on it together.

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:48.433
Congressman Roskan:
-- negotiated on.

01:07:48.433 --> 01:07:49.700
You took on ethics reform.

01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:51.033
You took on some big things.

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:54.533
One of the keys was you
rolled your sleeves up,

01:07:54.533 --> 01:07:58.533
you worked with the other party,
and ultimately you were able to

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:01.300
make the deal.

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.934
Now, here's an observation.

01:08:02.934 --> 01:08:08.166
Over the past year, in my view,
that attribute hasn't been in

01:08:08.166 --> 01:08:09.233
full bloom.

01:08:09.233 --> 01:08:13.667
And by that I mean, you've
gotten this subtext of House

01:08:13.667 --> 01:08:17.834
Republicans that sincerely want
to come and be a part of this

01:08:17.834 --> 01:08:20.667
national conversation
toward solutions,

01:08:20.667 --> 01:08:24.633
but they've really been
stiff-armed by Speaker Pelosi.

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:26.700
Now, I know you're not in
charge of that chamber,

01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:31.166
but there really is this dynamic
of, frankly, being shut out.

01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:35.734
When John Boehner and Eric
Cantor presented last February

01:08:35.734 --> 01:08:38.000
to you some substantive
job creation,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.066
our stimulus alternative,
the attack machine began to

01:08:42.066 --> 01:08:44.900
marginalize Eric -- and we can
all look at the articles -- as

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:48.266
"Mr. No," and there was this pretty dark story, ultimately,

01:08:48.266 --> 01:08:51.333
that wasn't productive and
wasn't within this sort of

01:08:51.333 --> 01:08:53.967
framework that you're
articulating today.

01:08:53.967 --> 01:08:55.967
So here's the question.

01:08:55.967 --> 01:08:58.633
Moving forward, I think all of
us want to hit the reset

01:08:58.633 --> 01:09:00.834
button on 2009.

01:09:00.834 --> 01:09:02.233
How do we move forward?

01:09:02.233 --> 01:09:06.567
And on the job creation
piece in particular,

01:09:06.567 --> 01:09:09.567
you mentioned Colombia,
you mentioned Panama,

01:09:09.567 --> 01:09:11.166
you mentioned South Korea.

01:09:11.166 --> 01:09:15.500
Are you willing to work
with us, for example,

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.667
to make sure those
FTAs get called,

01:09:17.667 --> 01:09:20.867
that's no-cost job creation?

01:09:20.867 --> 01:09:24.367
And ultimately, as you're
interacting with world leaders,

01:09:24.367 --> 01:09:27.400
that's got to put more arrows in
your quiver, and that's a very,

01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:29.367
very powerful tool for us.

01:09:29.367 --> 01:09:32.633
But the obstacle is, frankly,
the politics within the

01:09:32.633 --> 01:09:35.066
Democratic caucus?

01:09:35.066 --> 01:09:36.467
The President::
Well, first of all,

01:09:36.467 --> 01:09:41.033
Peter and I did work together
effectively on a

01:09:41.033 --> 01:09:42.200
whole host of issues.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.934
One of our former colleagues is
right now running for governor,

01:09:45.934 --> 01:09:50.300
on the Republican
side, in Illinois.

01:09:50.300 --> 01:09:51.633
In the Republican
primary, of course,

01:09:51.633 --> 01:09:53.700
they're running ads of him
saying nice things about me.

01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:57.166
Poor guy.

01:09:57.166 --> 01:10:05.066
(laughter.) Although that's
one of the points that
I made earlier.

01:10:05.066 --> 01:10:07.700
I mean, we've got to be careful
about what we say about each

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:10.867
other sometimes, because it
boxes us in in ways that makes

01:10:10.867 --> 01:10:12.800
it difficult for us
to work together,

01:10:12.800 --> 01:10:17.266
because our constituents
start believing us.

01:10:17.266 --> 01:10:20.033
They don't know sometimes this
is just politics what you guys

01:10:20.033 --> 01:10:26.633
-- or folks on my
side do sometimes.

01:10:26.633 --> 01:10:33.433
So just a tone of civility
instead of slash and
burn would be helpful.

01:10:33.433 --> 01:10:38.000
The problem we have sometimes is
a media that responds only to

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.166
slash-and-burn-style politics.

01:10:41.166 --> 01:10:42.834
You don't get a lot of
credit if I say, "You know,

01:10:42.834 --> 01:10:45.166
I think Paul Ryan is a pretty
sincere guy and has

01:10:45.166 --> 01:10:46.433
a beautiful family."

01:10:46.433 --> 01:10:49.133
Nobody is going to run
that in the newspapers.

01:10:49.133 --> 01:10:53.734
Speaker: (Inaudible.)
(laughter.)

01:10:53.734 --> 01:10:56.066
The President:
And by the way, in case he's going to get a Republican

01:10:56.066 --> 01:11:01.433
challenge, I didn't mean it.

01:11:01.433 --> 01:11:05.133
(laughter.) Don't
want to hurt you, man.

01:11:05.133 --> 01:11:12.100
(laughter.) But
on the specifics,

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:20.567
I think both sides can take
some blame for a sour climate
on Capitol Hill.

01:11:20.567 --> 01:11:25.867
What I can do maybe to help is
to try to bring Republican and

01:11:25.867 --> 01:11:29.367
Democratic leadership together
on a more regular basis with me.

01:11:29.367 --> 01:11:34.233
That's, I think, a
failure on my part,

01:11:34.233 --> 01:11:37.900
is to try to foster better
communications even if

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.600
there's disagreement.

01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:44.133
And I will try to see if we
can do more of that this year.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:48.166
That's on the sort
of the general issue.

01:11:48.166 --> 01:11:50.767
On the specific issue
of trade, you're right,

01:11:50.767 --> 01:11:55.967
there are conflicts within and
fissures within the

01:11:55.967 --> 01:11:57.233
Democratic Party.

01:11:57.233 --> 01:12:00.967
I suspect there are probably
going to be some fissures within

01:12:00.967 --> 01:12:02.900
the Republican Party, as well.

01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:10.734
I mean, you know, if you went
to some of your constituencies,

01:12:10.734 --> 01:12:15.100
they'd be pretty suspicious
about it, new trade agreements,

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:19.367
because the suspicion is
somehow they're all one way.

01:12:19.367 --> 01:12:22.033
So part of what we've been
trying to do is to make sure

01:12:22.033 --> 01:12:27.133
that we're getting the
enforcement side of this tight,

01:12:27.133 --> 01:12:30.834
make sure that if we've got a
trade agreement with China or

01:12:30.834 --> 01:12:33.100
other countries, that they are
abiding with it -- they're not

01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:39.300
stealing our intellectual
property or making sure that

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:44.700
their non-tariff barriers are
lowered even as ours
are opened up.

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:48.433
And my hope is, is that we can
move forward with some of these

01:12:48.433 --> 01:12:52.066
trade agreements having built
some confidence -- not just

01:12:52.066 --> 01:12:54.767
among particular
constituency groups,

01:12:54.767 --> 01:12:57.533
but among the American people
-- that trade is going to be

01:12:57.533 --> 01:13:01.667
reciprocal; that it's not just
going to be a one-way street.

01:13:01.667 --> 01:13:04.233
You are absolutely right
though, Peter, when you say,

01:13:04.233 --> 01:13:08.333
for example, South Korea
is a great ally of ours.

01:13:08.333 --> 01:13:12.467
I mean, when I visited there,
there is no country that is more

01:13:12.467 --> 01:13:18.433
committed to friendship on
a whole range of fronts
than South Korea.

01:13:18.433 --> 01:13:22.834
What is also true is that the
European Union is about to sign

01:13:22.834 --> 01:13:26.400
a trade agreement
with South Korea,

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:29.133
which means right at the moment
when they start opening up their

01:13:29.133 --> 01:13:34.266
markets, the Europeans might
get in there before we do.

01:13:34.266 --> 01:13:37.600
So we've got to make sure that
we seize these opportunities.

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.200
I will be talking more
about trade this year.

01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.633
It's going to have to be trade
that combines opening their

01:13:44.633 --> 01:13:48.367
markets with an
enforcement mechanism,

01:13:48.367 --> 01:13:50.133
as well as just
opening up our markets.

01:13:50.133 --> 01:13:53.100
I think that's something that
all of us would agree on.

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:56.567
Let's see if we can execute it
over the next several years.

01:13:56.567 --> 01:14:00.900
All right, is that it?

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.633
Congressman Pence: Jeb
Hensarling, Texas.

01:14:02.633 --> 01:14:05.033
And that will be
it, Mr. President.

01:14:05.033 --> 01:14:07.867
The President:
Jim [sic] is
going to wrap things up?

01:14:07.867 --> 01:14:09.100
Congressman Pence:
Yes, sir.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:09.867
The President:
All right.

01:14:09.867 --> 01:14:10.734
Congressman Hensarling:
Jeb, Mr. President.

01:14:10.734 --> 01:14:11.800
The President:
How are you?

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.800
Congressman Hensarling:
I'm doing well.

01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:16.533
Mr. President, a year ago I had
an opportunity to speak to you

01:14:16.533 --> 01:14:18.066
about the national debt.

01:14:18.066 --> 01:14:21.133
And something that you and I
have in common is we both have

01:14:21.133 --> 01:14:22.367
small children.

01:14:22.367 --> 01:14:25.567
The President:
Absolutely.

01:14:25.567 --> 01:14:27.300
Congressman Hensarling:
And I left that
conversation really

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:31.133
feeling your sincere commitment
to ensuring that our children,

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:36.967
our nation's children, do not
inherit an unconscionable debt.

01:14:36.967 --> 01:14:40.767
We know that under current law,
that government -- the cost of

01:14:40.767 --> 01:14:44.367
government is due to grow from
20 percent of our economy to 40

01:14:44.367 --> 01:14:48.867
percent of our economy, right
about the time our children are

01:14:48.867 --> 01:14:53.700
leaving college and
getting that first job.

01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:57.033
Mr. President, shortly after
that conversation a year ago,

01:14:57.033 --> 01:15:02.266
the Republicans proposed a
budget that ensured that

01:15:02.266 --> 01:15:05.467
government did not grow beyond
the historical standard of 20

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:07.834
percent of GDP.

01:15:07.834 --> 01:15:13.767
It was a budget that actually
froze immediately non-defense

01:15:13.767 --> 01:15:16.200
discretionary spending.

01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:21.867
It spent $5 trillion less than
ultimately what was enacted into

01:15:21.867 --> 01:15:27.600
law, and unfortunately, I
believe that budget was ignored.

01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.600
And since that
budget was ignored,

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:35.367
what were the old annual
deficits under Republicans have

01:15:35.367 --> 01:15:40.533
now become the monthly
deficits under Democrats.

01:15:40.533 --> 01:15:44.066
The national debt has
increased 30 percent.

01:15:44.066 --> 01:15:46.934
Now, Mr. President, I know you
believe -- and I understand the

01:15:46.934 --> 01:15:50.700
argument, and I respect the view
that the spending is necessary

01:15:50.700 --> 01:15:53.433
due to the recession; many
of us believe, frankly,

01:15:53.433 --> 01:15:55.600
it's part of the problem,
not part of the solution.

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.967
But I understand and
I respect your view.

01:15:57.967 --> 01:16:01.266
But this is what I don't
understand, Mr. President.

01:16:01.266 --> 01:16:06.433
After that discussion, your
administration proposed a budget

01:16:06.433 --> 01:16:10.767
that would triple the national
debt over the next 10 years --

01:16:10.767 --> 01:16:13.100
surely you don't believe 10
years from now we will still be

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:17.467
mired in this recession -- and
propose new entitlement spending

01:16:17.467 --> 01:16:25.033
and move the cost of government
to almost 24.5 percent
of the economy.

01:16:25.033 --> 01:16:28.567
Now, very soon, Mr. President,
you're due to submit
a new budget.

01:16:28.567 --> 01:16:29.934
And my question is --

01:16:29.934 --> 01:16:31.333
The President:
Jeb, I know there's a question in there somewhere,

01:16:31.333 --> 01:16:32.767
because you're making a
whole bunch of assertions,

01:16:32.767 --> 01:16:35.667
half of which I disagree with,
and I'm having to sit here

01:16:35.667 --> 01:16:36.734
listening to them.

01:16:36.734 --> 01:16:38.500
At some point I know you're
going to let me answer.

01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:40.000
All right.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:40.533
Congressman Hensarling:
That's the question.

01:16:40.533 --> 01:16:43.400
You are soon to submit a
new budget, Mr. President.

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.000
Will that new budget,
like your old budget,

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.533
triple the national debt and
continue to take us down the

01:16:49.533 --> 01:16:52.900
path of increasing the cost of
government to almost 25 percent

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.200
of our economy?

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:55.800
That's the question,
Mr. President.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:56.967
The President:
Jeb, with all due respect,

01:16:56.967 --> 01:17:00.166
I've just got to take this last
question as an example of how

01:17:00.166 --> 01:17:04.066
it's very hard to have the kind
of bipartisan work that we're

01:17:04.066 --> 01:17:08.266
going to do, because the whole
question was structured as a

01:17:08.266 --> 01:17:16.967
talking point for
running a campaign.

01:17:16.967 --> 01:17:21.166
Now, look, let's talk about
the budget once again,

01:17:21.166 --> 01:17:24.900
because I'll go through
it with you line by line.

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:28.433
The fact of the matter is, is
that when we came into office,

01:17:28.433 --> 01:17:32.266
the deficit was $1.3 trillion.

01:17:32.266 --> 01:17:35.834
-- $1.3 [trillion.] So when you
say that suddenly I've got a

01:17:35.834 --> 01:17:39.934
monthly budget that is higher
than the -- a monthly deficit

01:17:39.934 --> 01:17:43.200
that's higher than the annual
deficit left by the Republicans,

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:49.500
that's factually just not true,
and you know it's not true.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:57.266
And what is true is that we came
in already with a $1.3 trillion

01:17:57.266 --> 01:18:01.400
deficit before I
had passed any law.

01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:06.700
What is true is we came in with
$8 trillion worth of debt over

01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:08.567
the next decade -- had nothing
to do with anything

01:18:08.567 --> 01:18:11.400
that we had done.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:16.100
It had to do with the fact that
in 2000 when there was a budget

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:23.533
surplus of $200 billion, you had
a Republican administration and

01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:29.834
a Republican Congress, and we
had two tax cuts that

01:18:29.834 --> 01:18:31.700
weren't paid for.

01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:34.734
You had a prescription drug plan
-- the biggest entitlement plan,

01:18:34.734 --> 01:18:38.700
by the way, in several decades
-- that was passed without it

01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:41.567
being paid for.

01:18:41.567 --> 01:18:51.300
You had two wars that were
done through supplementals.

01:18:51.300 --> 01:18:55.133
And then you had $3 trillion
projected because of the lost

01:18:55.133 --> 01:18:59.100
revenue of this recession.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.567
That's $8 trillion.

01:19:00.567 --> 01:19:05.300
Now, we increased it by a
trillion dollars because of the

01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:08.433
spending that we had to
make on the stimulus.

01:19:08.433 --> 01:19:11.533
I am happy to have any
independent fact-checker out

01:19:11.533 --> 01:19:14.967
there take a look at your
presentation versus mine in

01:19:14.967 --> 01:19:18.400
terms of the accuracy
of what I just said.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:25.266
Now, going forward,
here's the deal.

01:19:25.266 --> 01:19:27.433
I think, Paul, for example,
head of the budget committee,

01:19:27.433 --> 01:19:33.300
has looked at the budget and
has made a serious proposal.

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:34.900
I've read it.

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.700
I can tell you what's in it.

01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:40.166
And there are some ideas in
there that I would agree with,

01:19:40.166 --> 01:19:43.500
but there are some ideas that
we should have a healthy debate

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.300
about because I don't
agree with them.

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:48.467
The major driver of our
long-term liabilities,

01:19:48.467 --> 01:19:51.533
everybody here knows, is
Medicare and Medicaid and our

01:19:51.533 --> 01:19:53.033
health care spending.

01:19:53.033 --> 01:19:55.100
Nothing comes close.

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:57.500
Social Security we could
probably fix the same way Tip

01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:00.133
O'Neill and Ronald Reagan sat
down together and they could

01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:01.400
figure something out.

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.734
That is manageable.

01:20:02.734 --> 01:20:07.000
Medicare and Medicaid --
massive problem down the road.

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.500
That's where -- that's going to
be what our children have to

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:12.400
worry about.

01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:17.367
Now, Paul's approach -- and
I want to be careful not

01:20:17.367 --> 01:20:25.000
simplifying this, because I know
you've got a lot of detail in

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.133
your plan -- but if I
understand it correctly,

01:20:28.133 --> 01:20:33.500
would say we're going to provide
vouchers of some sort for

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.834
current Medicare recipients at
the current level --

01:20:35.834 --> 01:20:36.633
Congressman Ryan:
No.

01:20:36.633 --> 01:20:38.333
The President:
No?

01:20:38.333 --> 01:20:39.567
Congressman Ryan:
People 55 and above --

01:20:39.567 --> 01:20:40.800
The President:
Fifty-five and --
well, no, I understand.

01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:42.266
I mean, there's a
grandfathering in,

01:20:42.266 --> 01:20:45.000
but just for future
beneficiaries, right?

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:47.133
That's why I said I didn't want
to -- I want to make sure that

01:20:47.133 --> 01:20:49.200
I'm not being unfair
to your proposal,

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:51.667
but I just want to point
out that I've read it.

01:20:51.667 --> 01:20:59.500
And the basic idea would be that
at some point we hold Medicare

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:04.066
cost per recipient constant as
a way of making sure that that

01:21:04.066 --> 01:21:10.000
doesn't go way out of whack,
and I'm sure there are some
details that --

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.633
Congressman Ryan:
We drew it as a
blend of inflation

01:21:11.633 --> 01:21:14.834
and health inflation, the point
of our plan is -- because

01:21:14.834 --> 01:21:18.533
Medicare, as you know, is a $38
trillion unfunded liability --

01:21:18.533 --> 01:21:21.100
it has to be reform for younger
generations because it won't

01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.800
exist because it's
going bankrupt.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.166
And the premise of
our idea is, look,

01:21:25.166 --> 01:21:27.633
why not give people the same
kind of health care plan we here

01:21:27.633 --> 01:21:29.400
have in Congress?

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.266
That's the kind of reform
we're proposing for Medicare.

01:21:31.266 --> 01:21:32.100
(applause.)

01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:32.633
The President:
No, I understand.

01:21:32.633 --> 01:21:33.300
Right, right.

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:37.700
Well, look, as I said before,
this is an entirely

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:40.066
legitimate proposal.

01:21:40.066 --> 01:21:46.500
The problem is twofold: One
is that depending on how it's

01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:52.900
structured, if recipients are
suddenly getting a plan that has

01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:57.000
their reimbursement
rates going like this,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:00.367
but health care costs are
still going up like that,

01:22:00.367 --> 01:22:05.667
then over time the way we're
saving money is essentially by

01:22:05.667 --> 01:22:10.533
capping what they're getting
relative to their costs.

01:22:10.533 --> 01:22:13.934
Now, I just want to point out --
and this brings me to the second

01:22:13.934 --> 01:22:18.100
problem -- when we made a very
modest proposal as part of our

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:22.867
package, our health
care reform package,

01:22:22.867 --> 01:22:26.133
to eliminate the subsidies going
to insurance companies for

01:22:26.133 --> 01:22:37.467
Medicare Advantage, we were
attacked across the board,

01:22:37.467 --> 01:22:43.133
by many on your aisle,
for slashing Medicare.

01:22:43.133 --> 01:22:43.900
You remember?

01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:46.800
We're going to start cutting
benefits for seniors.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:50.900
That was the story that was
perpetrated out there -- scared

01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:54.433
the dickens out of
a lot of seniors.

01:22:54.433 --> 01:22:59.000
No, no, but here's my point.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.900
If the main question is going to
be what do we do about Medicare

01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:11.900
costs, any proposal that
Paul makes will be painted,

01:23:11.900 --> 01:23:15.734
factually, from the perspective
of those who disagree with it,

01:23:15.734 --> 01:23:19.133
as cutting benefits
over the long term.

01:23:19.133 --> 01:23:21.433
Paul, I don't think
you disagree with that,

01:23:21.433 --> 01:23:26.900
that there is a political
vulnerability to doing anything

01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:28.500
that tinkers with Medicare.

01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:31.533
And that's probably the biggest
savings that are obtained

01:23:31.533 --> 01:23:32.867
through Paul's plan.

01:23:32.867 --> 01:23:35.367
And I raise that not because
we shouldn't have a series

01:23:35.367 --> 01:23:37.367
discussion about it.

01:23:37.367 --> 01:23:40.133
I raise that because we're not
going to be able to do anything

01:23:40.133 --> 01:23:44.900
about any of these entitlements
if what we do is characterized,

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.734
whatever proposals are put out
there, as, well, you know,

01:23:47.734 --> 01:23:50.667
that's -- the other party
is being irresponsible;

01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:57.033
the other party is trying to
hurt our senior citizens;

01:23:57.033 --> 01:24:01.533
that the other party
is doing X, Y, Z.

01:24:01.533 --> 01:24:06.667
That's why I say if we're going
to frame these debates in ways

01:24:06.667 --> 01:24:11.600
that allow us to solve them,
then we can't start off by

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.200
figuring out, A,
who's to blame; B,

01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:20.467
how can we make the American
people afraid of the other side.

01:24:20.467 --> 01:24:24.100
And unfortunately, that's how
our politics works right now.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:26.467
And that's how a lot of
our discussion works.

01:24:26.467 --> 01:24:30.467
That's how we start off --
every time somebody speaks in

01:24:30.467 --> 01:24:32.233
Congress, the first
thing they do,

01:24:32.233 --> 01:24:35.400
they stand up and all the
talking points -- I see Frank

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.934
Luntz up here
sitting in the front.

01:24:36.934 --> 01:24:39.834
He's already polled it,
and he said, you know,

01:24:39.834 --> 01:24:43.300
the way you're really going to
-- I've done a focus group and

01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:46.900
the way we're going to really
box in Obama on this one or make

01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:49.433
Pelosi look bad on that one
-- I know, I like Frank,

01:24:49.433 --> 01:24:53.500
we've had conversations
between Frank and I.

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:56.200
But that's how we operate.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:25:01.433
It's all tactics, and
it's not solving problems.

01:25:01.433 --> 01:25:03.867
And so the question is, at what
point can we have a serious

01:25:03.867 --> 01:25:08.533
conversation about Medicare
and its long-term liability,

01:25:08.533 --> 01:25:12.300
or a serious question about --
a serious conversation about

01:25:12.300 --> 01:25:15.633
Social Security, or a serious
conversation about budget and

01:25:15.633 --> 01:25:20.567
debt in which we're not simply
trying to position

01:25:20.567 --> 01:25:22.033
ourselves politically.

01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:23.633
That's what I'm
committed to doing.

01:25:23.633 --> 01:25:27.533
We won't agree all the
time in getting it done,

01:25:27.533 --> 01:25:29.367
but I'm committed to doing it.

01:25:29.367 --> 01:25:30.433
Congressman Ryan:
Take one more?

01:25:30.433 --> 01:25:31.967
The President:
You know, I've already
gone over time.

01:25:31.967 --> 01:25:38.767
But I'll be happy to take your
question, Congressman, offline.

01:25:38.767 --> 01:25:40.400
You can give me a call.

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.533
All right, thank you, everybody.

01:25:41.533 --> 01:25:42.400
God bless you.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.000
God bless the United
States of America.

01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:44.467
Thank you, everybody.

01:25:44.467 --> 01:25:46.033
(applause.)
