00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.850
They said you are the highest moneymaker

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.188
Mafia boss outside of alpha point you were making six to eight

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.599
milliliter

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.599
aspired to be made

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.979
I was 17 years old my dad drew a 50 year prison sentence my best friend was walking in Philomath

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.250
But the setup was bad. Yeah, I'll be honest what I might have gotten killed

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.349
So there's a lot of people I sit down with and I meet but

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.700
Michael I have to tell you you're you're one of the most fascinating people that I've been looking forward to sitting down with

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270
And you had Nicky eyes

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.329
and Mikey franchisee

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.099
When you hear about the modern day not even a modern day

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:52.129
You know the movie Godfather everybody has a poster and you watch the movie, and you hear about Michael Corleone

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.139
And you think is there really a character like that you pretty much are the real-life

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.059
Michael Corleone leaper say of that story right so it's exciting to be sitting out with you appreciate you for

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.080
Making the time and welcoming us to your place here well

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.279
Thank you, and I have been compared obviously to to Michael

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.820
I think it's a good comparison at times because Al Pacino he played a terrific role in that movie

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.600
yeah, and there is a certain flow that I watch in the movie with them, and I see with you where the

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.569
Mannerisms, it's amazing how close that is

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020
With the mannerisms that you have on the way you speak

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.509
So let's get right into it if you don't know Michael Franzese II let me give you some stats. Here's the best way to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.320
Open it up. So you'll know who we're sitting down with so in

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.730
1986

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.049
Fortune magazine November 10th Fortune magazine there's an article

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.520
saying the 50 biggest mafia bosses right and

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.430
And when you go through this

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.219
The part in here that's fascinating to me is the following they have you down on 18th place

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:07.279
Right and then they had John Gotti at 13, so you look at this and you say well

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.860
You're 18 Gotti is 13, and then you have Anthony

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.099
Salerno at first and you have some of these other name Persico, Carmine Persico you work with very closely for many years

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.650
Salvatore Santoro some of these names that people know about the part that I looked at

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.080
Michael there is not a single person on this list where there starts with the number three except for you

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.410
Gadi was 46 you were 35

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.070
So we're not just talking about somebody who made it to the high level of the Colombo family the five families the Colombo family yourself

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.460
You did it at 35 years old? How was it being raised into that environment in that family?

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.430
I would say I had a good role model as far as

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.800
you know my dad being a real person of substance in that life and

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.810
You know I love my father. He was he was everything to me growing up and

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.390
You know he was an important figure there

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.490
And it's not that I tried to emulate him

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.109
Patrick because I never thought I would be part of that life growing up. You know I had different thoughts

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.710
I was gonna. You know I was an athlete. I was going to school. I was going to be a doctor

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.339
But once I made a decision to get into that life

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.550
I had as far as I was concerned the best guy in the world to

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.850
Model myself after and that was my dad, I learned a lot from him directly watching all the things that was taking place

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.940
Yeah, just the way. He carried himself. You know the way people

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.510
Respected him the respect that he had for my mother

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.609
And and my sisters and just the way he carried himself you know and he was a man's man

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.990
And you know from the time I was five years old my father drummed it into my head

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.700
You know Michael you have to be a man's man

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.240
That's the standard in

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.600
Life you have to live up to he in many ways form the person that that I became later on in life

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.950
Yeah, it's so much street credit that you can tell if somebody did something to you

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.950
And they knew who your dad was there was a line like you couldn't mess with it

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.950
How was it being raised in that environment? Well it was different. You know I always tell the story I was an athlete and

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:09.000
Baseball was really my sport and my dad would never miss a game. No matter what he was doing mob business legit business

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.380
I'd be playing ball. He'd show up

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.700
He'd always come to the field late, and he'd pull up in a big black Cadillac or a black Lake

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.039
And he'd get out of the car dressed sharp in a suit

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.339
And he'd always have five or six guys with him because he never traveled alone

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.219
And I'd be up to bat and they'd walk out on the field the umpire would take one look at him and never call strike

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.540
Three on me, so I mean it had his advantages you know being Sonny Franzese his son

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.730
You know he he was just a great father

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.099
You know and obviously I knew there was something different about him, but my dad never spoke about it now

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.929
It's really never so you didn't really know fully. What was taking place never from him

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.930
I knew because he was such a high-profile figure that we lived in an environment

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.540
Where law enforcement was around us all the time and he was?

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.909
under surveillance from five or six different agencies from the feds right down to all the state and locals

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.540
So they would Park cause around our house and follow us wherever we went

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.579
and you know I viewed them at that time as the enemy because I viewed my dad is my hero and

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.750
So I knew who he was I obviously read the papers he had a lot of press

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:16.889
And I observed things, but never from his mouth. He would never bring it into the house for in the house

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.449
We were just the family that didn't exist isn't that interesting yeah door six areas

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.450
I'd like to touch up on here with you

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.829
One is story on how that life was to how the game because you wrote a book

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.259
I'll make you an offer you cannot refuse the game between

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.419
What you have to experience now similar that is on the corporate side? I think there's a lot to be learned from the entrepreneurs who?

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.320
Watch this I do how to identify consigliere

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.089
I really want to stay on that because what it means to be a conciliar II how do you identify that it's a very?

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.869
Fascinating way you talk about it in the book

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.350
Human nature, you know how do you read through the BS?

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.989
And how do you read through some people that are trying to take advantage of you? What are some of the things that you saw?

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.699
And then some side questions about characters and then some fun questions at the end

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:03.300
I will go through

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.940
So why don't we get into it as far as?

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:13.949
When you knew and you said I want to get in how did you get into the whole you know family?

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.930
I want to become a made man. How did that whole experience take place with you you know Patrick?

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.660
I never aspired to be a made man

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.420
You know I was on a different path in life

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.369
but I was 17 years old when my dad drew a 50 year prison sentence and

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:34.559
Went off to serve his federal time and I sat with my dad

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:40.470
I visited him in the federal jail before they shipped him off to the penitentiary and he said to me Michael

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.899
I'm innocent I didn't commit this crime. It was alleged to have masterminded a nationwide string of bank robberies

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.760
He said I never knew the witnesses

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:54.089
I'm not a bank robber the witnesses were all drug addicts junkies and one thing I knew my dad hated anything to do with drugs

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.310
My whole life. He preached against her

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:59.910
He would make up stories about drug addicts to scare me never to take drugs

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:02.969
So I knew he would never bother with people like this so I believed him

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:07.109
And when he went away joe columbo the boss of our family who we were close with

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.710
he kind of took me under his wing because my dad was his underboss and

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:15.510
I started to meet a lot more of my dad's friends. You know and they were influencing me Mike. You know

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:16.590
What are you doing going to school?

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:22.500
I was a pre-med student at that time shortly after that you know if you don't help you father out. He's gonna die in prison

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.020
So I went to see him in Leavenworth

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.900
And I said that I'm not going to school you're gonna die in here if I don't help

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:31.529
He didn't want that. I mean he kind of argued. No. I want you to go to school get an education

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.369
I said dad. It's too late my mind is made up and he said to me

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:36.810
He said if you're gonna be on the street

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:41.549
then I want you on the street the right way in his mind the right way was to become a member of his life and

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:45.359
He proposed me at that point for membership into the life

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.990
And you know the interesting thing Pat

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:51.660
My father even at that point never told me what the life was about

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:57.959
You know you're not supposed to talk about that life with anybody outside of it, and he wouldn't violate that policy even with me

00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.830
It's on something my dad's a good soldier

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:04.859
He just said go home somebody would be in touch with you do whatever you're told. It was kind of on the job training and

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:09.840
two weeks later I sat with the boss, and you know he ran things down for me and

00:08:10.419 --> 00:08:13.049
Told me what to expect and for the next year and a half

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:16.620
I was kind of a recruit where I kind of learned the life had to do anything

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.820
I was told to do to prove myself worthy, and then Halloween night

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:25.380
1975 is one it was formally inducted into that life you remembered vividly

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:26.940
Vividly yeah

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:32.159
And how was what was that process like was there ritual was there an experience you had to go through very very

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:38.249
Solemn ceremony very serious six of us walked into a room individually towards midnight that night

00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:43.559
It was a very secure setting obviously I walked into a room the boss was seated ahead of like a horseshoe

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:50.520
configuration the underboss in the console area to his left and right all of our capo regimes our captains alongside of them, and I

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:53.880
Walk down the aisle stood in front of the boss. I held out my hand

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:59.760
He took a knife right here cut my finger some blood dropped on the floor. This is a blood oath. I cupped my hands

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.760
He took a picture of a saint Catholic Baltic Cod put it on hands eluded a flame

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.890
It didn't hurt it would burn quickly

00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:11.799
It was just symbolic and he said tonight Michael Franzese you are born again and to a new life until of course

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.459
I know stir this thing of ours

00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:16.209
violate what you know about this life betray your brothers

00:09:16.209 --> 00:09:21.759
And you will die and burn in hell like this Saint is burning in your hands. Do you accept yes?

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.700
I do and that's it. That's the ritual. That's

00:09:26.029 --> 00:09:26.920
wart and sweet

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:32.950
But extremely serious now there was six of you the six of us we went in individually you take it alone

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.120
Got it

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:39.729
And then out of these six apparently you're the only one that's alive so all that they're all dead

00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:43.450
One of them died in natural causes every one of them were murdered Wow

00:09:43.970 --> 00:09:46.600
So why are you still here?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.640
You know because if you if you read the story and you you you you put yourself out there

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.300
And it's not like you went in you

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:59.500
Ratted people out or you became an informant there's nothing there that people will say even some of the guys that

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.089
Were upset that you stepped away. They don't call you Informer. They just say you know

00:10:04.089 --> 00:10:08.739
It's impressive to see that he was able to make it and we're proud of them even some of your enemies are saying good things

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.849
About you what how did you how was that process for you never hear somebody?

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:17.170
Survive when they leave the family how did that happen with you? Well you know Patrick?

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:23.020
I don't I didn't have any grand plan because there's no blueprint to walk away from that life

00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:25.449
not enter a program and survive and

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:30.940
You know I'm only saying this because it's a fact. I don't know of anybody else that has done that successfully

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.180
Especially at the level that I reached because I was at a pretty high level

00:10:34.339 --> 00:10:37.809
You know I didn't know how it was gonna work out. I knew that when I walked away

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.500
People are gonna be upset you don't walk away from that life

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.209
You're not allowed to renounce it, and I had a lot of trouble as a result, but you know

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:48.399
For me, there's two sides of this

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:51.039
There's a spiritual side obviously I'm a person of faith

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:55.149
and the bottom line for me is I believe God had a different plan and a purpose for my life and

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:57.290
over the past 20 years

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:03.190
I've seen more evidence of that and I'm very secure with that. It's God's plan but aside from that

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:07.510
You know I realized that God never throws you into the fire without preparing you first

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.339
So I spent 20 years in that life at a very high level and I was a good student of the life

00:11:12.339 --> 00:11:18.259
I observed in our why and I I reached a certain level there, so I knew I had to make changes

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:21.830
You know one of the horrors about that life, and I don't know if you know this

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:26.539
But you might be in trouble in serious trouble your best friend walks you into a room

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:32.960
You don't walk out again and unfortunately I've experienced that in my life with other people and so I said okay

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:38.810
They're not gonna walk me into a room. They're gonna have to work to get me. I move out of New York

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:43.219
I would have never made it in New York. I move way out across the country to California

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.239
It's one thing to try to walk somebody into the room. It's another thing to send a hit squad

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.929
to try to get somebody who knows what's going on and

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:58.190
I never put a house in my name no utilities. I I never went to any nightclubs bad place for me

00:11:58.190 --> 00:12:02.599
I know who hangs out there somebody sees me. They make a call to New York. They want to be a hero

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:07.430
I walk in a parking lot boom. I'm gone. I stop creating patterns in my life

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:12.680
I never went to the same restaurant every Tuesday night, and never walked my dog every morning at seven o'clock

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.719
So if somebody was scoping me they had a they had a tough time in figuring out where I was and I was very

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.130
Disciplined in that very disciplined because I never sell my former associates short

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:26.059
It was very capable guys there, and then what happened I

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:28.459
Just outlasted everybody

00:12:28.459 --> 00:12:32.959
I mean who went to jail who got killed we had a big war in our family in the early 90s about

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.739
13 guys got killed another 20 or something went to jail for life

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:43.039
And I just outlasted everybody and you know the major thing for me was that I never testified against anybody

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.690
I didn't send anybody to prison

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:48.380
I didn't put anybody in trouble had I done that it would have been a lot worse

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:51.200
It would have been a lot worse because some people had

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.919
Personal feelings against me because when I left you know look

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.349
I was making a lot of money a lot of people were earning with me

00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.779
And when you shut that off people get upset and they resented that you know especially my boss at the time

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:08.200
but the fact that he didn't hurt anybody over a period of time that really went my favor and

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.319
Listen you know there's no guarantees

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.950
You know I'm still careful when I go to a certain place. He'll feel today

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:21.189
Oh, yeah, really so the level of paranoia is not gone. It's not paranoia, and I you know it's not a macho thing

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:24.429
I don't want you to think that but I just feel very secure

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:29.469
But you know look God doesn't tell you to be stupid. I can't go back to Brooklyn say hey guys

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:33.100
I'm moving back into a book or you know it would be like thumbing my nose at that face

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:39.399
So I don't do that, but you know listen. I'm a speaker. I'm out in front of thousands of people every week

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:44.200
I've signed books for hundreds of people. I don't know who's on that book line. You know you never know you know

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:45.220
I'm not a kid anymore

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:50.950
You know God has blessed me with with good things in my life, and I think I'll be around for a while longer

00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.660
But if not I mean, what could you do I mean?

00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:57.370
That's that's how I look at things it it seems Michael that you're very result

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:03.099
I mean when I when when speaking to you there's none of it that you're uncomfortable which was fascinating but

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:09.370
Talking about numbers. I don't know if everybody really knows. What kind of numbers you were bringing in the numbers

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:14.409
I read about you were making six to eight mil awake six to eight million per week

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.269
and you were selling a half a billion dollars of gas per month and

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:22.390
They said you are the highest moneymaker

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:25.900
mafia boss outside of Al Capone I mean

00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.970
There's a lot of people that are making money with you

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:35.110
How did that happen people think that mob guys sit around and their social clubs and we start to target different?

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:39.250
Businesses well we're going to take that over. I'm going to do this normally doesn't happen that way

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.539
What happens is people come to us people would come to me with all sorts of deals?

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.580
And it was mostly guys that came inside their company that had a way to make some money

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:50.889
And they figure they can do with me I can protect them

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.349
I can finance and we have strengths you know all that and

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.980
That's how this happened in the gas business some guy came to me at a very small

00:14:57.590 --> 00:15:03.340
Gasoline operation, and he said you know I have a way to defraud the government out of tax on every gallon of gasoline

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.450
was attractive to me because at that time I didn't like the government and

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.979
You know my targets back then were always bigger companies

00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:16.599
I didn't go after small the list of companies they CLA you didn't go out there

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.719
No, I didn't go after so I figure the ones that can afford it nope

00:15:21.309 --> 00:15:23.769
And the government was a huge company so

00:15:24.379 --> 00:15:29.889
what happened he had a couple of other wise guys that were kind of trying to extort him in his business and

00:15:29.989 --> 00:15:34.059
I was able to solve that for him, and then we went into business together

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.829
And I'll tell you how it happened

00:15:35.829 --> 00:15:40.178
I I put somebody with him because I didn't know him that well, and I said I'm gonna put this fellow with you

00:15:40.179 --> 00:15:43.539
We're gonna see exactly what you got going on and we'll try to figure this out

00:15:44.059 --> 00:15:45.910
Well the guy put with him was a butcher

00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:50.230
He was my butcher big guy at a scar across the top of his said big Vinny

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:55.839
We called him, so he's coming home every Saturday. He would bring meat to my house right so this Saturday

00:15:55.839 --> 00:15:59.229
He pulls up, and he's got this big box on his shoulder and I said

00:15:59.389 --> 00:16:02.709
What do you don't want all that meat are we having a party or something? I don't know about it

00:16:02.709 --> 00:16:05.409
He says hey chief at a meat. I said what is it?

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:09.489
He's to come on in the kitchen we go in the kitchen he puts the Box down. He opens it up

00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:15.638
$280,000 he said, that's the first week steak in the gas business and

00:16:16.369 --> 00:16:21.789
Long story short he really got my attention at that point I grew that 280 into

00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:30.399
At times almost eight million dollars a week bring it her week her will get down and basically you know devised the scheme

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.089
built upon what that little germ of an idea that he had and

00:16:34.699 --> 00:16:38.889
We were defrauding the government out of tax on every gallon of gasoline it was 20 to 40

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:44.798
Cents depending where you were located the government couldn't figure it out. We had a very efficient scheme put together

00:16:44.799 --> 00:16:46.329
They just couldn't figure it out

00:16:46.329 --> 00:16:50.859
We were always one step at it, and is this part of a whole Rico story

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.039
Which was you know? What kind of link to that where?

00:16:54.949 --> 00:16:57.669
corporation after corporation after corporation and then last one

00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:58.869
He would follow bankruptcy

00:16:58.869 --> 00:17:05.408
And this this was figured out on how to avoid paying the taxes which allowed you to kind of compete against your marketplace

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:10.779
So you had guys that were buying a million gallons all of us under buying two three then they're doing ten million

00:17:11.419 --> 00:17:14.799
Gallons from you, and you're one of the biggest vendors to them better

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:21.219
We would you're not even middle east don't know from Texas. You know you're Italian doing this. I had probably 300 gas stations

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:22.730
We had branded and non-branded

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:25.539
Stations and what we would do is. Let's say it was a Mobil station

00:17:25.539 --> 00:17:27.549
I'm just picking that out because we dealt with a show

00:17:27.949 --> 00:17:32.289
And we go to a station say how much you paying for a gallon of gas? It's not paying a dollar now

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:36.819
How would you like to pay 95 cents the five cents is big sake boys? He said great?

00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:40.809
I said I'll tell you what you do you how many gallant how many loads a week you're getting from mobile

00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:45.729
Oh, we're getting six all right by three from them by three from us. We'll deliver in the middle of the night

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:50.530
We'll save you that by the end of the day. They wanted to deliver. They wanted us to service them ball

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:53.109
They didn't want to buy anything from opal anymore. I said you can't do that

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.750
You got to keep you a brand nobody can compete with us

00:17:55.750 --> 00:18:02.260
And if we bought a couple of gas stations like I remember one incident there were four gas stations on the corner big ones

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.699
We bought one of them, and I went to the other three and I said now. Here's the deal I

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.589
Said I'm gonna be the lowest guy in a corner. I said if you sell for 95

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.439
I'm gonna sell for 92 if you sell from 92

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.970
I'm gonna go down to 80 until I put you all out of business, so let's keep it at a certain level

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.230
and we don't have to compete told them that so there was a regulator number that we're doing with so no one's I

00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.309
Said if you guys stay at this number you'll be fine if you try to compete with me

00:18:27.309 --> 00:18:32.109
I'm gonna knock you out because you can't compete with me and pretty soon. They were all buying for me anyway

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.620
They'll never be anything like that again. I don't know if I read this right

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:38.439
I saw you talk about it where one of the guys you did business with

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:45.910
was this the oil guy who for eight years tracked everything that you were doing who was actually the guy that ended up becoming the

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:52.150
Informant that gave me formation either. You know stop the entire operation yeah, he was my partner. He's passed away now

00:18:52.309 --> 00:18:58.089
We never had an ill word and seven years that we were together my kids called him uncle Larry

00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:01.689
His kids called me uncle Michael, but the whole time. I was his meal ticket

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:07.900
because he knew if he ever got in trouble that I was a guy that they would want so he kept a

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.160
Diary on me

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:15.670
He testified against me in one case a big case would rudy giuliani, and I did me and I was acquitted so the jury still

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:22.059
Didn't believe him you're making all the family's money now. They're all kind of happy about you, but at the same time

00:19:22.059 --> 00:19:27.879
You know you're there as well. What happened when all of a sudden you were growing a little too fast

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.859
What kind of threats did you start seeing at that point where there's some people that were power people saying wait a minute?

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:34.790
I don't like this guy having this much power

00:19:34.790 --> 00:19:38.199
Yeah, you know what happened. I had a couple of things against me number one

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.330
I was a younger guy and the older guys tend to resent you

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.919
You know you're young you're doing all this you're making all this money and that comes with the territory

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.740
He can't help that you try to deal with it as best you

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.339
Can you know you're not flaming that fire so to speak, but it happens?

00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:55.370
And then you know I had teamed up with the Russians

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:59.329
I had all the Russian mob guys in Brighton Beach Brooklyn were all my partners

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:02.419
And they were pretty big crew and I think it was Newsday

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.649
Publication out in Long Island had written a story that I was becoming so powerful

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:09.500
I was gonna break away from the Colombo's and start my own family

00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:15.200
No truth to it whatsoever was like a fairy tale fiction made up, but it got into people's heads

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:20.660
and you know my boss started to question some of the Russian guys and

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.919
Something started to happen like that and I knew it so I was on my guard about it

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.550
You know my father

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:31.130
And I discussed it my dad was always in and out of jail on parole so when he was out. We talked about these things

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:35.720
But I knew I had to watch myself. You know it comes with the territory

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.679
What was the one event that happened where you're kind of like listen?

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:45.169
I got a started taking a look at what's going on with me was it Joey Columbo story was at the Castellano

00:20:45.170 --> 00:20:48.740
What God he did to him or what was it what you're like listen?

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:51.919
I'm gonna start paying a little bit more attention on what's going on the marketplace right now

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:56.029
you know it wasn't that it was it was an incident that I had personally with my boss when they

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.850
they basically walked me into that room and

00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:06.559
really, put me on the hot seat because there was a story that said that I would I had stole two billion dollars from the

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:11.330
Government, and I'm handing a family two million dollars a week, and so I mean I got questioned

00:21:11.330 --> 00:21:14.000
You know what I'm saying two billion dollars Michael. I said hey

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.550
My answer was when they write about everybody else. It's a lie when they're writing about me all of a sudden

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:23.389
It's the truth I said come on man. I'm giving you guys all this money. You don't have to do anything

00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:29.300
I'm taking care of everything. You know I put nobody in trouble nobody's on the line here if anybody goes down

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:32.840
It's going to be me and my crew I said well. What's going on here

00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.500
You know so I got a little upset about it, and then I was talking to the boss

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.750
And you don't lose your head with the boss, but I got al angry

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.299
And then I had a I have told myself down a little bit

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:47.269
you know on it and but that put me on the alert, and I said, you know I got to really watch myself here because

00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:51.200
You know mistakes here you pay dearly for in life

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:56.210
And I kind of just like I said put me really on my guard yeah, I'll be honest her

00:21:56.210 --> 00:21:58.489
I thought it was I thought I might have gotten killed that night

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:04.129
You know did the set up was bad my best friend was walking me until Roma was a it was a room in Brooklyn

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.570
I'll be honest with ya

00:22:05.570 --> 00:22:11.840
You know I had a walk out of the car and into that house and base that basement apartment. It's probably a 30 yard walk

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:18.290
that was either the longest or the shortest welcome Wow I mean I as I speak now I

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.630
Can hear the crickets chirping?

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.030
And I can remember the smell of the flowers

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:26.660
Alone because you know Petro gallant someone you think you're gonna meet your maker

00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:31.820
and I was in a religious guy at that point you start to pray and I was I was nervous I

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:35.270
Tried not to show it because I said hey if this is it this is it

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:39.080
You kind of get conditioned to them yes, but uh yeah, that was the night

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:46.129
And I didn't appreciate it years later now because you have you hear stories that your father was involved, and he wasn't involved

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.160
How do you feel about that whole situation?

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:53.359
Where was your dad really kind of saying let's find out if Michael is really making this money

00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.960
And I'm not you know we're not getting a piece of it. How did you respond to that at that time?

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.199
I think my dad kind of threw me under the bus a little bit that night

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.679
He you know he went in separately and I was told that he didn't defend me

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.509
He just kind of backed off and said hey if my son is stealing he does everything. I don't do anything

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:14.390
I was I'm on parole. He handles everything and knows on bad terms at that time. No we want a great term

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:20.030
Well it really hurt you know because I said man it kind of gave me really pause because I said you know

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.080
If this life can separate father and son what do we really have here?

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:24.660
I never

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:30.200
said anything to him because you know again in that life you learned to keep things quiet until you were at the right time and

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:34.250
But it really put me on notice that I got to really be careful

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.960
I was very disappointed in him I didn't it didn't change my love for him or anything

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.449
But I was extremely I was really disappointed it really hurt

00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:45.050
How do you from a moment like that that's it? That's a big scar?

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.440
This is a man that grew up you need to be a man's man from five years old

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.629
You know he's shaping you into who you are, and he's coming through James. He's always at your game

00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:58.059
How do you from that moment trust anybody else and not believe that?

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:04.720
You know at some moment somebody could turn um is that the faith part that completely changed it that brought the peace?

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.940
It did you know I?

00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:10.630
Understand my father. I know he's really a product of that life

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:16.780
And I kind of understood even though I didn't appreciate it. I know my dad still loved me. It wasn't anything like that

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:21.130
It's very hard to explain to anybody else so I gave my wife has a real problem with this

00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:26.140
She says you know you know how do you forgive that I used to tell her you don't don't worry about it

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:31.059
It's okay, and you know we have this special bond between us, and I understand the life

00:24:31.059 --> 00:24:35.589
I'm a product of who but it was still disappointing because I would have never done that to him

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:40.390
But I'll tell you what I almost thanked him for it now because I'll tell you this Patrick

00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:42.640
I met my wife two years after that and

00:24:43.309 --> 00:24:46.149
That's when I made the decision to walk away from that life

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.570
But if this innocent incident didn't happen with my dad

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:54.220
I don't think I would have ever walked away Wow I think that was God's Way of

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:59.229
Separating me from this bond or this hold that my dad had on me

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:03.640
so I'd look back and I said actually it was a good thing because I

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:10.719
Don't think I would have walked away. It's amazing. How you process it that way. I mean. I don't know who

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:16.449
Can sit there and go through that and not think of a different way, but the way you're processing his demand that

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.850
Did this to give your life?

00:25:18.850 --> 00:25:23.319
Maybe a second chance type of a situation very interesting so and now he's 100 years old

00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:30.250
You know you were telling me. You know he had a surgery recently. He's doing good. He's still sharp. He thinks he's gonna

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.250
Live a long time which is great

00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:34.479
He still talks to me like I'm part of that life

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:42.609
He's unbelievable reminiscing and telling old stories that you remember Michael, Oher. Yes, you know I always say this look

00:25:43.309 --> 00:25:45.548
My dad did a lot of rough things in his life

00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:48.189
So did I I went to jail for crime that I was guilty of but?

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:53.230
You know that particular crime that he did 38 years in prison for he was innocent off

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:57.549
And I'll take that to my grave real awe hundred percent. I investigated that case

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:03.819
Spoke to every witness they recanted that testimony we gave him why detective test proved they lied at the trial

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:11.180
The FBI was complicit and turning them against my dad. It was a bad case. She was framed thousand percent people say well

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.599
You know he got away with so much. That's not how our system supposed to work

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:17.839
They have enough tools and weapons the government to get people the right way

00:26:18.030 --> 00:26:22.910
They're not supposed to do that no matter what or who you are because they're they do it against the bad guys one day they

00:26:22.910 --> 00:26:26.959
Can do it against the good guys if it suits them so I always say tell people look

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:32.749
You wouldn't want my dad's life in the last 50 years that man suffered did 38 years in prison

00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.699
My sister died of an overdose of drugs while he was away my brother was a drug addict

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.090
my brother actually

00:26:39.090 --> 00:26:46.220
turned against my father went into the witness protection program and testified against him and got him thrown back in jail my kid brother I

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:49.009
Mean my father was destroyed over there

00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:54.140
You know my mom passed away in the last years before she passed away

00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.020
I

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.530
Can only describe their relationship as ugly?

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:03.830
She blamed him for everything on 33 years without a husband she blamed him for everything that went down so I mean the guy's suffered

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:10.580
Tremendously and I have a real heart for that. You know. I love my dad and we patched things up. You know it's amazing how?

00:27:11.130 --> 00:27:13.130
You know people said I'd never have a relationship

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:19.490
With him again that you know when I walked away and God has brought it full circle, and I found out one thing Patrick

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:26.540
You have to give children or children want to love their parents you got to give him a real recent not to love their parents

00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.280
Powerful absolutely, I'm just thankful that we have this relationship again

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:37.399
So Sparks restaurants famous for you know Paul Castellano is where he got shot outside by

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:44.600
John Gotti and that whole relationship, how was possible Castellano was he really just a money business guy

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:48.530
I knew Paul I didn't know him well because she was a boss I was young at that time

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.300
but I was in his company quite a bit, and I did have an incident with him and

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.949
Quite honestly you know the word on him on the street was not great

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:02.780
I don't think he had a lot of real friends on the streets especially any other families. I know in our family

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:04.790
They didn't talk well about him

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:06.230
more of a business guy

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:11.689
You know that kind of a thing I think people think that maybe he didn't earn the position that he had because he was so

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:13.140
Close to car loan

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.780
Carlo gave him that spot you know it went down with Gotti

00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:21.449
I mean it was it was either him or Gotti at that point and John made the move and you know in our life

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:23.860
There's no election process

00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:29.729
You know if you're gonna take over you're gonna take over the hard way you don't rival a boss and look for votes

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:35.369
You rival a boss by eliminating. You know look money is always at the root of just about everything there

00:28:35.370 --> 00:28:39.359
You know if you were good you make people earn people like you. That's the bottom line

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.770
You know and if they don't like it

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:46.829
they'll tolerate you because you're earning with them, but he was kind of known to be a greedy guy, and he didn't fit the the

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:53.820
Profile of the real mob boss in a way, you know God. He doesn't make that move on his own

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.740
He kind of solicits people

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:59.549
Hey, what do you think he tries to get some support that if this would have happened

00:28:59.549 --> 00:29:01.410
You know how are people gonna react?

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:06.209
So he kind of knew how it was gonna work out if he took him out every time you had a running with them

00:29:06.210 --> 00:29:11.699
You've had obviously many run-ins with them. You've done a couple sit downs with them. How was Gaudi like personality-wise?

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.100
Why did he have this you know?

00:29:14.650 --> 00:29:18.809
Larger-than-life story the nowhere near the kind of money you brought him

00:29:18.809 --> 00:29:20.559
What made him that special?

00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:26.249
Well, you know he was he fit the Hollywood profile so to speak and he had the look you had the mannerisms

00:29:26.890 --> 00:29:32.280
You know one thing. I will say about John. I happen to like him. You know socially a lot of fun

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.790
We were going a club give me a lot of fun, and he was a good guy to be around

00:29:36.429 --> 00:29:38.789
business he didn't really understand business and

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:44.669
And it was a nightmare dealing with him in that respect because one thing about Gotti in his mind

00:29:44.669 --> 00:29:49.169
He always tried to come out on top he can never be a loser never so it's very hard to negotiate

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:53.850
And do anything you had to make him think that he won. Even if you were winning

00:29:53.919 --> 00:29:56.369
It was the only way to get around and get something at him

00:29:56.370 --> 00:29:59.189
So you had to kind of have that mentality going in with him

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.919
But I was very difficult to deal with in that regard

00:30:01.919 --> 00:30:07.859
I respected him because he made no bones about who he was yeah. I'm a gangster. I'm a mobster. I love this thing

00:30:07.919 --> 00:30:11.069
That's all I am and that's all I ever want to be it was public about that

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:16.320
It was public about it and that was it you know people say he destroyed the life. He didn't destroy the life

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:18.179
I mean we all destroyed the life

00:30:18.179 --> 00:30:20.969
You know the government just won up to us with their

00:30:21.159 --> 00:30:28.259
technology with the laws with the informants they had I remember reading this what you said when you went to prison didn't bother you

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:32.940
When he went to prison he got bullied in prison my father taught me something

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:37.320
They should Mike when you go into prison remember three things three words that are gonna. Take you

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:40.229
Make you have an easy go of it with other guys

00:30:40.779 --> 00:30:44.129
Remember to say please. Thank you and excuse me

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:49.859
You know because you bump into somebody excuse me, you know yes somebody please may

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.069
I have this you don't cut in front of people on a line because

00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.859
Everybody that so many guys rather

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.229
I should say that got no respect on the street

00:30:58.539 --> 00:31:02.219
Want to get all the respect in there because they're putting on a show for everybody else

00:31:02.559 --> 00:31:09.119
So little silly things become major things got it so you can't throw your weight around now. You can't take any nonsense

00:31:09.909 --> 00:31:13.799
But you know people have to understand you may be the silent type, but don't mess with me

00:31:13.799 --> 00:31:15.000
And I'm not gonna disrespect

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.689
You don't disrespect me and John carried himself differently paid the price

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:22.649
And I know a few guys that did that so business you wrote this book

00:31:22.649 --> 00:31:27.389
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse when I read books. You know leave my mark and write down

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:33.299
I made so many marks in this that was just in it's a it's a small book. You know what I'm amazed

00:31:33.299 --> 00:31:37.439
I will tell you if you haven't read this book you have to read this book

00:31:37.570 --> 00:31:40.860
It was in oh nine, which social media wasn't around

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:45.689
I hope we can make this book become a phenomenon because I think every entrepreneur

00:31:47.289 --> 00:31:50.219
Salesperson leader must read this book so make a list of it

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.490
We'll put a link on the bottom for you to get as well. You linked it between

00:31:54.309 --> 00:32:00.959
Business and the Mafia life that you went through and you talked a lot of a lot of different parts of it

00:32:01.570 --> 00:32:05.010
Tell me about the sit-down which was obviously very big

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:10.799
in the in the business you were in and sit down to us, maybe we go into a boardroom and

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:16.049
You know we're Center negotiating with our investors, or you know you know Advisory Board whatever it is

00:32:16.179 --> 00:32:18.179
How was sit down like for you guys?

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:23.880
Well, it was it was the basis or the the format in which we resolved everything

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.419
I mean anytime we had a resolve a business dispute

00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:31.118
Something more serious. We did it at a sit-down as we called it

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:35.888
It's funny because my publisher after they read that chapter. They don't have any more meetings then the

00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:39.939
Whole place doesn't sit down these were high-level

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:44.950
Very sophisticated meetings believe it or not and we had certain rules

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:49.809
You know if you're a made guy, and you're at a sit-down you had to be respectful

00:32:50.179 --> 00:32:55.778
no matter what the situation was in other words if I'm a made guy, and I'm arguing something and

00:32:56.389 --> 00:33:03.338
I'm lying and you know I'm lying you can't call me a liar if you call me a liar you lose the argument automatically

00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:09.399
you have to figure out a way to make people know that you're wrong that this guy is wrong, and I'm right and

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:14.109
The old time was very tactful at this you know they would try to get you into a trap

00:33:14.109 --> 00:33:19.838
Or you would just say something and you're done. It's all over so you had to really learn how to

00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:27.519
Respectfully get your point across and you had to know the mentality of the personality of the person going in well

00:33:27.519 --> 00:33:30.728
You don't defeat him these old-timers were smart. You know they were cagey

00:33:30.759 --> 00:33:35.829
I had so many of these because it was like every day in my life when I was in the gas business

00:33:35.830 --> 00:33:40.089
I had somebody trying to take over somebody trying to get in because you know in New York

00:33:40.129 --> 00:33:45.549
There's a lot of us and we were constantly engaging with one another on different matters

00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:50.949
And I had a big crew so the guys are my crew got in trouble at it sit down one other bit was constant business

00:33:51.169 --> 00:33:55.388
so you learn how to carry yourself there, and it really helped me in my

00:33:56.299 --> 00:34:00.038
negotiation skills in business it really helped because

00:34:00.739 --> 00:34:04.659
Going in I would figure out what I wanted what I would settle for

00:34:05.629 --> 00:34:10.689
And I would keep you know I learned one thing it's always great to let the other person talk

00:34:11.210 --> 00:34:15.010
Let them talk let them just keep talking throw out a word that gets from a little bit

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:19.719
and he'll talk more and as he's talking you can kind of figure out his mentality as

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:22.479
personality what you can get out of them what you can't get out of them and

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:25.929
It helped me a lot in negotiating deals later on

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.190
And you know sometimes you may be the smartest person in the room

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:32.179
And you don't want anybody to know that

00:34:32.179 --> 00:34:35.979
You just want to keep quiet like you don't know anything let them think they're smarter than you

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:40.000
And there's other times when you're not the smartest person in the room

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.189
But you want people to think you are so you have to learn how to have that skill

00:34:45.619 --> 00:34:49.899
Were you a big reader because what you just said is art of war right so you know when you're strong

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:53.619
You know you got to show that you're weak when you're weak

00:34:53.619 --> 00:35:00.098
You got to act strong, so were you one that's I mean obviously. I you read Machiavelli Prince. That was kind of the Bible for

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:05.470
The family right, but were you always reading no, I wasn't a big reader honestly

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:10.480
I became a reader in prison did I have a lot to do, but no it's just something I developed I think

00:35:11.150 --> 00:35:16.299
Along the way one real talent that helped me a skill or two number one

00:35:16.299 --> 00:35:21.038
I recognized a good deal because I got a lot of stuff thrown at me and I recognized

00:35:21.039 --> 00:35:26.679
what was good and what wasn't going to work, and that's important because you can waste your time with stuff all day long and

00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:28.960
Secondly was I always say

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.349
I knew how to put the right people in the right place and

00:35:32.809 --> 00:35:38.079
Get them and motivated them to do the work properly my mantra always was at that time

00:35:38.079 --> 00:35:43.629
do what you do best and delegate the rest and then make sure they do the job and

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:46.000
That always worked for me until today

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.389
You know there's things that I'm just not good at and I don't even try to do them

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:53.890
I don't want to be bothered with it, but I'll get somebody's gonna do them see it a whole lot better. Oh, yeah

00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:58.899
Yeah, I had to so who was the best guy you saw to sit down were you every time you went there

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.109
You know he was gonna be able to sit down you either learned a lot from him

00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:04.109
Or you knew this was not gonna be an easy one

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.130
Yeah, well God he was tough

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:06.680
I mean

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:11.079
You know you knew going in you had just outsmart him and let him think he want

00:36:11.079 --> 00:36:12.760
But you get out of there with what you really do

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:17.770
Oh, yeah, Wow yeah, you know I had to deal with him long story showed me sounds silly

00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:21.520
but it wasn't at the time we had a big flea market a swap meet and

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:26.169
there were two partners there one of them was an accountant legitimate guy and

00:36:27.260 --> 00:36:29.260
he was my guy and

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:32.559
There was another guy that he was partners with that was kind of a street guy

00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:38.048
And they couldn't get along and the kid was stealing out of the market so the guy came to me so I threw the kid

00:36:38.049 --> 00:36:42.029
Out of them I said you can't come back you're done. We're taking it over well

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:46.469
He runs to John and John says he gets in touch with me smite

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.630
This kid belongs to me and half the market is mine

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:52.289
I said John the guy didn't even know who you were he ran to you now all of a sudden

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:56.759
You know him your whole life. You know. That's what happens in that life, so I have a big sit-down and

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:01.680
We can't get along and I said I told my guys that you're never gonna get along with this guy

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:05.670
And I'm never gonna get along with John in this market. I said so we have to do something either

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.690
We're gonna buy him out

00:37:06.690 --> 00:37:13.110
Or he's gonna buy us and so I knew at the time that he would never stand for me buying him out

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:18.959
Never pride yeah pride, so I had to I had to have him buy me out

00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.960
But if I told him to buy me out he wouldn't buy me out

00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:25.559
So I went in then we sat down at Sir John. I'm buying you out and the first words

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.130
It's like I knew it you don't buy me out. I bought you out. I said no. I'm buying it

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:33.209
We went back finally I gave in I said I buy me out. You know she buys me out

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:36.870
You know we get out. We share the money or whatever three months later

00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:41.459
The market went down it closed because I knew what they were gonna do now who got the better end of the deal

00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:45.839
I don't know cuz I know what I got who knows how much he got what he busted the market out

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.870
But it worked out better that way, but you know he thought he won

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:51.509
You know he could tell everybody he got me out of the market and meanwhile

00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:54.360
I got what I wanted so that's how you had to deal with him

00:37:54.570 --> 00:38:01.199
Very interesting anybody else that was very good to sit down. That was a different approach than him. You know I sat down, Castellano

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:05.250
He was rough you know he was small business

00:38:05.250 --> 00:38:09.419
But you know he's a boss so he can throw his weight around a little bit more and you had to be

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:11.140
mindful of that you know

00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:15.329
But you had to be respectful and just hold your ground you know and but he was good

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.289
It was really good. I sat down with Fat Tony Salerno was the boss of the Genovese family

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:25.679
I like Tony a lot. You know. I really like to really respected him. He was very good the old time was good younger guys

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:27.970
Not so much

00:38:27.970 --> 00:38:30.630
But you know I had an advantage. I mean oh he said my father

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.569
You know early on was my mentor so he kind of

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:38.400
He kind of gave me clues as to how to how to go in and win and he was good 35

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.689
It's like you were the LeBron James of the era right. I mean you were the youngest guy. I mean, it's

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.900
11 years is the difference to the second-youngest guy

00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:50.399
And that's guy and you're doing it at 35 sitting with these powerful guys negotiating Michael

00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:54.750
How was compensation figured out okay 40 cents? I'm bringing half a billion gallons

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.710
six to eight million a week

00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:04.649
how is the money spread so the soldiers you know and then you got how was that spread is was there a

00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:11.039
Arrangement that was everyone knew how the numbers will be a 10% you or five percent or twenty percent here

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:14.429
or would everything vary and nothing was really a

00:39:15.310 --> 00:39:21.929
Steady number that would always be there. I had my own formula, and I discussed it with my father, and we came to this conclusion

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.540
If it was it was legitimate deal

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:29.310
I didn't have to give anybody anything was my deal like I had a couple of automobile dealerships

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:29.820
I had a movie

00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:35.639
I had a lot of stuff legitimately that was mine, so if you if you started and nobody else helped you start

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.250
It's 100 percent you or it's mine, and you don't have to share any of it

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:40.140
No unless I took him at his upon God

00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:46.980
It gave me money if God ever no it was totally my God my legit stuff was mine the street stuff was different like

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:52.620
when I when I first got involved with the gas business, and I knew what I had I want to see my boss I

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.939
Said to him. I said jr.. I'm on to something this Persico

00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:02.490
I said I'm gonna show you more money than you ever seen before and he said we don't do drugs

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:08.189
I says not drugs. You know I'm not into that I said I'm into the gas business. I said, but here's the deal

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:10.470
I don't need you to do anything but

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:17.759
When other families learn of what we have everybody's gonna want to get involved. I said as soon as that happens

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:21.600
We're gonna blow it. I said you've got to keep this within the family

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.689
I said if we have an argument you got to make me win

00:40:25.090 --> 00:40:29.159
You got to make me win don't play politics nothing you do that for me

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.990
and I'll show you more money than you ever saw before and he said show me and

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:40.290
I'm starting to bring him every week all you had to do is sit back and ask him for anything, right?

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.260
But every time we had to sit down. I had to win now

00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:48.870
I'm bringing him two million dollars a week that buys a lot of loyalty and my formula was if I

00:40:49.150 --> 00:40:56.129
Brought the deal in and I didn't need anything from you you got 25 percent of anything 25 percent goes back to the family

00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.550
Got it

00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:01.350
If I needed you in some way like money from you or whatever

00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:06.539
that was different than when maybe you know maybe of my full partner Elliott everything was a

00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.359
25% 25% was my deal and I was a captain so there was nobody between me and you

00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:15.330
So I gave it to him like if I was a soldier

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:19.170
I'd have to give it to my captain my captain then would give it to him, and they'd work it out once

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:25.109
You're a captain you only report up right? There's nobody directly to the boss you talked about consigliere right counselor

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:28.440
I can tell you I am where I'm at right now because I've had

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:34.259
Some amazing advisors in my life. I can't even we're talking about deadly earlier. We talked my certain

00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.440
You know Tom and some of these other guys that have affected my life

00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:43.349
How do you know who is a concealed area where you can open up with like in your world?

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:47.610
That's a big part of your life in your business, so how do you identify one and?

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:54.090
When do you know this is gonna be the guy that I'm gonna go to the console area is an official position in our life

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:59.999
there was a coroner made man or four there's one kansui area in every family and

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:08.160
The console Gary his official position is that he is the liaison between the men and the boss?

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:14.940
In other words in that life. We're told this everybody is equal you may be the boss, but you're still equal

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:20.069
You don't have better rights than the soldier. We're all made guys. We're all equal. You just happen to have a different position

00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:21.300
You're in control

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:26.279
But we're equal you can't you can't violate a soldier's right either

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.360
so if a soldier has a

00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:34.829
Problem maybe with the boss or something he's supposed to go to the console Gary and the console area straightens it out with the boss

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:38.279
That's in theory. How it is in practice

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:42.509
It doesn't work that way because the boss appoints the console area

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.030
and

00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:46.019
If you have a problem with the boss and you go to the console area

00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:51.270
you're probably going to get killed or get in trouble so you never said anything to the console you ever it was kind of a

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.819
nonsense position you know and

00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:56.140
usually it was it was a

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.370
guy that the boss

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:03.059
Respected that you know he would want things off of and they discuss things together and figure out what they have to do in any

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:06.060
Situation you didn't have an individual considered

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:11.700
But I obviously the guy that I trusted the most and talked with was my dad if I had something that I thought I needed

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:14.579
Advice with I talked her I was immediately I was it

00:43:14.579 --> 00:43:17.939
It's good to have that one person there that you could go to and say look

00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:20.579
You know especially my dad cause he knew the life shoulder sir well

00:43:20.579 --> 00:43:24.119
What made a very good conciliate so if you were to say here's?

00:43:25.209 --> 00:43:28.499
What makes a very good conciliate? What would you say it was?

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:35.579
Wisdom he had another life. He had it have good discernment. You know. Uh you know how to figure things out

00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:37.829
He should be a cool tempered guy

00:43:38.469 --> 00:43:39.489
and

00:43:39.489 --> 00:43:44.399
He should be sincere you know and not have his own personal agenda

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:51.089
That's important, but that's rare. Tell me it's rare in that like there's so much politics that goes on there

00:43:51.219 --> 00:43:52.930
You really had to be careful

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:56.339
What was the benefit of being a consigliere it's a high position?

00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:03.180
You know it's it's I mean the underboss in the country area. We're kind of equal really really

00:44:04.359 --> 00:44:09.568
Wow so that that much of a respected position so let's transition to human nature

00:44:09.569 --> 00:44:10.299
you know

00:44:10.299 --> 00:44:16.139
what were what were some of the things that you learned where you would go and have a sit-down or you'd meet with people and

00:44:16.239 --> 00:44:18.929
You would say I don't know if I feel comfortable with this guy

00:44:18.930 --> 00:44:22.379
I don't know if I trust this guy I feel comfortable trust in this guy was there a

00:44:22.839 --> 00:44:24.579
methodology that you eventually put together

00:44:24.579 --> 00:44:31.198
Or was it still an intuition type of thing when you were reading people it was more intuitive

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.989
I would say because everybody was so different

00:44:34.719 --> 00:44:39.629
Obviously if you had experience with somebody more than once then you know all right. I know I'm up

00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:44.430
I'm in for with this guy, but it was more intuitive because again with me I

00:44:45.130 --> 00:44:48.719
had so many you know with so many different people and

00:44:49.509 --> 00:44:54.748
III pretty well knew you know when you you start to get some experience in that life you know right away

00:44:54.749 --> 00:44:57.539
You know when somebody's out to get you and so to speak

00:44:57.539 --> 00:45:01.799
You know they're looking to you know not make things turn out for you well

00:45:01.799 --> 00:45:05.189
you know you just deal with it because that would have some probably a

00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:10.109
Person who ends up becoming a boss in that world you have to be very good in human nature

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:13.709
you know you've got to be able to figure it out and see who's

00:45:14.769 --> 00:45:19.139
even if you have a sit down you're sinner you're looking at this guy saying that guy's not on my side this guy's armed I

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:23.160
Said that guy's in the middle this guy there was a lot of that probably going on all the time

00:45:23.289 --> 00:45:27.059
Yeah, you know you know the problem though with that life. You know that life is like

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:34.919
it's like a wheel turning around and the guy that's on the bottom today can end up being on the top tomorrow and

00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:38.219
You always had to be mindful of that so

00:45:38.859 --> 00:45:41.129
For instance you know in Gatti's case

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:48.060
You know he could add a soldier close to him that was nobody really and then all of a sudden God

00:45:48.060 --> 00:45:50.060
He's the boss and how this guy becomes somebody

00:45:50.589 --> 00:45:53.099
So a guy that you didn't have much respect for

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.399
Now you better respect God, so

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:01.260
Because of that you always tried to treat people the very way yeah

00:46:01.260 --> 00:46:05.399
There is you never know you know where that guy's gonna be the next day or the next week

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.170
And then he's got it in for you

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:08.920
And then you got a problem that is that is very

00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:13.319
Interesting when you think about that because you that guy comes up the influence is gonna be with him, right

00:46:13.630 --> 00:46:17.880
So let's transition into some interesting character so Rudy Guiliani

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:23.069
Right he keeps coming up right and he wants to clean house as you want is what he wants to do

00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:29.249
Rudy says a guy who wrote a book man of honor Marathon Man on on

00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:31.859
Who's the person thought oh okay?

00:46:31.859 --> 00:46:33.300
So he writes the book

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.879
And then he gives the blueprint

00:46:36.339 --> 00:46:41.519
To them to know what the rico game was and he puts that together

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:45.599
And they had the best FBI agent at that time some guy named Lindley or Lynn

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:49.260
You know that he knew how to go and create an informants?

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:54.119
And he goes and figures out with the Green Reaper the Scarfo I think

00:46:54.970 --> 00:46:58.649
So how is that really true that anymore okay?

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.760
Don't believe any of that

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:06.599
I mean Giuliani says that the reason he he was in he had a position in Washington DC in the Department of Justice and

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.060
His story was that

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.180
Joe Bonanno wrote this book and

00:47:12.640 --> 00:47:17.849
He being an italian-american Giuliani was so insulted by this book because he made

00:47:18.099 --> 00:47:22.769
The Mafia out to be like a family like it was a very legitimate great thing

00:47:22.770 --> 00:47:27.359
and he wasn't so insulted by a Giuliani that he had a clean house because of it and

00:47:27.430 --> 00:47:32.460
That's why he came to New York and became the US Attorney there so he could attack the mob and clean house

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:40.360
I don't know if I believe that I think he was an opportunistic guy and being a US attorney in Manhattan is an extremely prestigious

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:42.260
position and

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:43.850
He picked

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:49.269
Our guys to go after and build his career at that point in time, and he did a great job of it

00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:51.580
I mean, let's face it. He has that repetition till today

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.549
Yeah
I mean he was very capable at what he did

00:47:54.740 --> 00:48:01.180
The racketeering the RICO statute had been on the books for over ten years when Rudy came in but nobody ever used it

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:06.640
He learned or he saw how to use it effectively and he started using it against us

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:13.180
And it was designed to be used against us but nobody ever did it and it's an it's extremely difficult law to to

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:18.850
Navigate around I mean I had three Rico indictments to me. I mean I think it's an

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:22.809
Unconstitutional law, but it's a law and nevertheless it's on the books so you live with it

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.489
But uh, you know he just was determined to make his name on us guys

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:34.060
And he did did you ever have a one-on-one running with them? I had one well in the courtroom today. I was

00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:38.499
He indicted me on a big RICO case and the day of my arraignment

00:48:38.570 --> 00:48:40.570
I had he was giving me bail

00:48:40.570 --> 00:48:44.529
And he came up to me and he said Frances if I convict you on this case

00:48:44.530 --> 00:48:48.759
I'm gonna give you double what your father got you got to get a hundred years, and that's the kind of time

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:50.760
they'll give it told me straight out and

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:54.670
I said Rudy I beat you guys three times. They're ready

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:59.139
Let's go for round four I told him you know that's kind of arrogant back then

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:04.749
But uh, you know I was on 12 for several months and I was as a lead defendant

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:09.219
And I was acquitted in that case some of my code events are convicted

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:13.090
I got 30 years, so he I would have probably got at least 50 if I lose that case

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:19.749
So to say that I won that case was a blessing as an understand why I'd still be in prison Wow

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.290
What do you think about Rudy today? What do you feel like when you see Rudy today on TV?

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:29.080
I mean Sun News was on so when you watch TV, and you see him. What how do you?

00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:33.940
How do you look at him when you you know? I don't know I'm okay with him. I mean it's not personal

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:36.700
You know I actually saw him one time he actually

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:39.489
He said some good things about me later on

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.860
Because when I was walking away from that life most of the people in government said ads a fraud

00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:46.069
He's not really walking away

00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:51.229
And he's pulling a scam over the government like he didn't a gas business everybody said that but Rudy said you know what?

00:49:51.569 --> 00:49:56.899
He's pretty smart guy, and he knows this life is on the run, and I think his walking away may be genuine

00:49:57.329 --> 00:50:01.579
He said that early on with your with you was within the night. Yeah, it was yeah

00:50:01.579 --> 00:50:04.399
I was in the it was in the early nineties. Yeah

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:08.869
He came and he said that there interesting for him to say, but listen. He's a very capable guy

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:14.209
No question about it. I will tell you this. I thought it was a great mayor in New York

00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.670
Yeah, really, did he did a lot for that city

00:50:17.789 --> 00:50:20.689
Without a doubt so I mean I can't knock his

00:50:21.599 --> 00:50:24.768
You know his abilities. He was he was good at what he did

00:50:25.559 --> 00:50:28.969
He says a big part of it was something about his dad. You know and his dad said?

00:50:29.549 --> 00:50:31.369
We can't be bullied in New York

00:50:31.369 --> 00:50:33.949
and that was his inspiration which I'm like wow what and

00:50:34.049 --> 00:50:39.768
What a thing to remember for your dad to instill there you get down much and drive to want to go against the five families

00:50:40.289 --> 00:50:44.599
That's that that's got to be a chip on his shoulder to want to do something. Well. No I

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:47.240
Mean, it's a good narrative

00:50:47.369 --> 00:50:51.919
But if you're gonna make your name in New York, you're gonna make it two ways you're going after Wall Street

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.430
Are you going after the mob? That's it and he chose both?

00:50:57.029 --> 00:50:59.659
Let's face it. I mean he got Boesky and he got

00:51:00.299 --> 00:51:02.479
What's his name the other big guy oh?

00:51:03.509 --> 00:51:09.229
Gosh forget Milken. He got milk in and he got us. He got us all so I mean you know

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:14.119
But I'll tell you what I owe a lot to him, and he doesn't even realize this

00:51:14.849 --> 00:51:16.680
when I was on trial

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:24.169
ayuh Rizzo my guest business partner had become an informant they were creating the case against me in the gas business and

00:51:24.569 --> 00:51:26.689
I ERISA was the star witness

00:51:27.329 --> 00:51:31.818
well when Giuliani found out that they had this big witness against me and

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:39.259
I was on trial he wanted that witness to testify against me the problem was I Rizzo didn't really know anything about that case

00:51:39.660 --> 00:51:42.410
But there was a big dispute. I found out afterwards

00:51:43.019 --> 00:51:48.589
Between East and district and Giuliani over getting iya Rizzo to testify because the Eastern District didn't want to give him up

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:52.879
That was their guy. You know it is the government. Anyhow Giuliani's got a lot of juice

00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:55.730
He wins we put our original on the stand okay?

00:51:56.190 --> 00:52:00.149
And we crucify him up there destroyed him on the stand okay

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:00.840
Jury

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:03.269
Didn't believe might get acquitted what happens now

00:52:03.700 --> 00:52:08.369
Now the government is scared because I just beat their main witness against me in the gas case

00:52:08.619 --> 00:52:11.339
They're ready to throw him out of the witness protection for a while

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.279
That's what gave me the leverage to negotiate

00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:18.959
the deal that I got because they were afraid I was going to beat him again because I had won four cases now I

00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.590
know they call John a Teflon down, but I won four cases two and

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:27.090
And the Giuliani case was a big loss for them, and if you look back

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:29.340
That was the only case that ended up in an acquittal

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:32.759
He convicted everybody we were the only ones whether it was an acquittal

00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:39.989
So that gave me the leverage to go in and make the deal in Eastern District and only I say only get ten years

00:52:40.210 --> 00:52:45.119
Because that was a bonus back, then I only get ten years. They were given everybody fifty and on you got ten

00:52:45.119 --> 00:52:46.050
I got ten

00:52:46.050 --> 00:52:52.169
That's amazing compared to some of the other stories you hear about I'll tell you this I believe if I resort in testifying the Giuliani

00:52:52.170 --> 00:52:54.600
Case and I beat him yeah, they wouldn't have made the deal with me

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:58.860
They would have taken me to trial because it was the gas business they figured they had me Wow you're gonna

00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:04.379
Put me away forever, but they got scared how much would you have gone through thirty five fifty? It was easy easy

00:53:05.109 --> 00:53:07.139
Fifty minute really yeah

00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:09.910
Patrick they were given guys a hundred

00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:14.700
150 years Wow and I'm saying I'm the youngest that already you're gonna go on a three hundred years

00:53:15.340 --> 00:53:21.059
unbelievable, it would have crucified me when you have time to think and really analyze the way life go and you look back and I

00:53:21.060 --> 00:53:24.239
Said man all these negatives turned into a positive for me

00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.270
They gave me breaks that I didn't realize were happening at that time

00:53:27.609 --> 00:53:32.669
You know it's a big part of my faith when I talk to people I said you know that the misery that you're going through

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:40.080
Now might be the blessing for you later on I said it happened in my life in more than one situation. You know my father

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:47.460
Okay, betraying me that later broke that tie that got me out of that life because everybody I know either dead or in prison for

00:53:47.460 --> 00:53:49.460
the rest of their lives everybody

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:54.119
So how is that gonna walk? Well I had a major bull's-eye on my back. They weren't gonna. Let me go

00:53:54.579 --> 00:54:01.229
No way is unbelievable story right there like by itself. That's an unbelievable story so Rudy Guiliani. You know will be fun

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:03.380
It'd be fun to

00:54:04.510 --> 00:54:06.989
Be at a sit-down with you

00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:11.940
Rudy and just hearing the conversations now, you're what huh I would love

00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:16.589
First thing I tell Rudy no idea. I'm the only guy to beat you. Yeah, I

00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.680
Started off like that put him right on it

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.160
So let some characters

00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:28.769
You know couple characters that I'm curious about if you ever had a running with did you ever have any business with Roy : I?

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:31.150
Did how?

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:36.180
How was it his personality because you hear Roy Cohen the influence would trump?

00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:42.809
And you know he was working with the five families and everybody trusted him because he wasn't leaking any information to anybody

00:54:43.299 --> 00:54:47.249
You know the story that he had in the court many years ago that you read about all the time

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:54.479
So who how was Roy : he was respected if I'll tell you my major Roy Cohn incident. I get indicted in

00:54:55.359 --> 00:54:57.359
the Giuliani case

00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:03.029
Roy reaches out to me go to his office. I go see him. He said I heard about the case

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:06.449
he says I didn't get your indictment squashed a

00:55:07.029 --> 00:55:12.299
Patrick nobody gets an indictment squash not in the federal level not when you're a target like me. I said, okay

00:55:12.299 --> 00:55:17.849
I just what do you want? He said I won 250 grand he says and I'll make it go away I

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.059
Said I'll tell you what I said

00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:25.319
I'm calculating I got to go to trial this and that I lose you know

00:55:25.319 --> 00:55:29.369
I'm gonna go I said, I'll put a million dollars in escrow

00:55:30.250 --> 00:55:33.149
Okay, when the indictment is squash take the whole million

00:55:34.029 --> 00:55:38.249
Because I knew it wasn't it happening. He's well. You know it doesn't work that way I see look

00:55:38.250 --> 00:55:42.239
That's how I work it. I some given you four three times in my four times of money

00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.899
I said I'm put in escrow. Take it squash the indictment you got it

00:55:46.509 --> 00:55:48.430
That was the end of that

00:55:48.430 --> 00:55:54.000
It's trying to beat me yeah, you know because then they come up with another issue. That's right says and we never trusted our lawyers

00:55:54.730 --> 00:55:57.929
Never try even the lives even ones we loved we ate it well

00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:02.519
You know you got he apparently had a great lawyer, but you Scott you know I'm talking every scholar

00:56:02.519 --> 00:56:08.379
I knew Bruce well was he so he also people didn't trust them either you trust him to a point right because it's money

00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:13.509
It's my fees per hour and the whole you never you never ever ever admit it to your lawyer

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:16.780
No matter how much you trust him that you were guilty was Roy trusted

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:21.100
No really, no seriously. He was yeah

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.550
Let me tell you something about their life, and I don't mean this to be

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:31.570
Anybody that wasn't a made guy. It could have been the president's or the Pope if you're not a made guy. You're a sucker

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:39.219
Everybody was on the same level and Roy Cohen if you could use him you used him. What did we trust him hell no?

00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:43.959
Bruce Cutler we're using everything else, but you don't trust them 100%

00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:47.199
I mean, that's just the way we dealt with them that makes sense

00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:52.209
So was Joey Gallo really the guide that you know that killed?

00:56:52.210 --> 00:56:56.350
You know Joe Joey Gallo was the guy that did it was it vacinated

00:56:56.350 --> 00:57:01.329
It wasn't him personally so of course he had the yeah, but he was behind that yeah

00:57:01.330 --> 00:57:05.590
that was verified everybody know that it was it was Nicky black as

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:12.490
feared of a man as they paint him out to be no okay, you know I

00:57:13.070 --> 00:57:18.850
Got along well with Nicky. I'll tell you one story though. I went into his he had a bar and

00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.939
he was brutal guy I got tired and

00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.729
Some guy owed him money, and I went it back with him

00:57:24.730 --> 00:57:29.199
He said Nick might come over here, and he was breaking the guys hands and everything like that. Just guy out of money

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:32.379
You know and I said Nicky come on man

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:36.160
You know I was a guy gonna pay if you break his hands game and go to work you know after

00:57:36.770 --> 00:57:44.080
You know, but but no he wasn't you gotta you gotta understand something to you know bond John Gotti was feared by everybody

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:46.690
John talked a lot but

00:57:47.180 --> 00:57:49.690
We all were capable of doing what we had to do

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:55.570
You know we we were only in fear if we did something wrong, and we knew we had to be afraid

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.680
but

00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.680
Because you throw your chest out

00:57:59.960 --> 00:58:04.629
You're no more capable than I am in other words if I if I got an order to kill you

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:09.370
I'm gonna kill you. I don't care who you are. I have to otherwise my life is at stake so

00:58:10.010 --> 00:58:16.360
We didn't fear people in that way, but you know there's people you don't want to cause like jr. My boss

00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:20.139
He was a treacherous guy. I don't want to cross him because I

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:25.060
Know what's gonna happen? He that bad. I mean you're like you're you read about him is like

00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.409
They call him the snake. I mean he was a he was a treacherous guy

00:58:29.410 --> 00:58:34.270
I mean I liked him don't get me wrong. I got along with him, but I knew I knew not to mess with him

00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:38.740
So we all had that kind of a fear you know what I mean

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:43.750
Don't don't mess because you may walk in the room and not walk out. What made Capone special that well

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:46.090
You know in the in the community was it anything

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:52.029
Significant that because they put you in Capone in the same league for the most money made right so listen

00:58:53.150 --> 00:58:56.410
What they always said and I believe it to be that the guest business?

00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:59.770
Was the most money that we had seen since the days of prohibition?

00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:05.799
Now we're not adjusting for inflation sure but so I mean he was an earner he had

00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:11.859
He caught it lucky like I did. I guess you know I found the gas tax at that time there was prohibition

00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:16.299
And he he found the right deal, and he was able to capitalize on it so

00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:19.300
When it comes on to sports?

00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:25.300
Do you think you know the whole P pros story and all these things you hear about back in the days, okay?

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:27.430
You think a lot of it still happens today?

00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:29.860
as far as as far as

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:33.399
Hey, make sure you don't win by 11

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:38.260
You know make sure you you know don't pitch the game like this you do this

00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:40.689
I know what happens a lot in a high school in the college level

00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:43.870
Do you think it still happens at the highest level in the pros?

00:59:43.870 --> 00:59:50.140
I don't believe so because the salaries now that these guys make you know they can afford to lose

00:59:50.900 --> 00:59:55.960
They'll pay their bets. They'll pay their debts. You know back in my day was different story

00:59:56.540 --> 01:00:00.699
You know I bookmakers working for me, and we had a lot of athletes gambling with us

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:05.470
And I remember bookmakers calling me up. Hey Mike so-and-so is into me for 25 grand should I cut him off?

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:09.699
I said why would you cut him off all you're doing is writing an entry on a piece of paper?

01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:14.860
I said get leverage let him get into you for 250 grand and then bring him to me

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:17.800
The higher the loss the more leverage you got over together

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:23.080
You know because they didn't have that kind of money back then now 250 grand had paid off. What's the big deal?

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:29.259
Nothing, no let me look Michael. Jordan is a legendary degenerate gambler, and I'm not calling him personally

01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:33.760
I'm just calling his gambling sure sure yeah the guy can lose a million dollars a week in one face

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:38.029
Yeah
You know show I mean there's him and there's some controversy behind him with the whole

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:43.460
What happened to his dad you remember that whole thing but was it was it not in and Stern told him to step away?

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:45.380
But I mean I don't know the story behind it

01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:50.989
But I I definitely believe because I was working with the NBA at that point in time, and they told him to get away

01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:53.450
That's who anyone you definitely believe 100%

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:57.500
I believe that and he went and played baseball for a year just to get let things die down

01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:03.380
And then he came back you know yeah, I mean that's that was the inside talk at that time

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:08.569
I read both sides, and I'm like you know it's kind of convincing. I just don't know for me to say that but

01:01:09.690 --> 01:01:16.880
You hear some high credible sources saying that you know that this took place last few things here before we wrap up so

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:21.679
You got a new project coming up. I literally got an email a week ago. I said hey did you know Michael got?

01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:26.209
casted for a movie with Tom Hanks, and you know with

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.230
Katarina

01:01:28.230 --> 01:01:33.830
Radivoje average from you know, Croatia, or you know the movies gonna be in Croatia. It's a fifty million dollar budget

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.110
This all of a sudden

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:38.270
You know I had a movie

01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:39.810
I had a role in a movie

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:42.259
Recently called let there be light with

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:48.140
Kevin Sorbo and the long story short how that happened the writer is a good friend of mine he roped me into the and then

01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:50.359
He said Mike I want you to play the part

01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:53.269
I had no intention of doing it, but I ended up doing it

01:01:53.270 --> 01:02:00.890
it was an ex-mob guy who became a pastor big stretch big stretch for me write those, but basically playing myself, but

01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.330
You know I'm involved with a fella by name of Tom Creole and Tom is

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:08.870
He goes after black money black money meaning

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.239
Money that's used to finance terrorist groups and

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:18.109
Money, that's used to go after Christian

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:22.940
You know martyrs, I mean to martyr Christians, and he and I kind of working together

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:27.140
And he's he created a film a game rather called

01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:32.330
Gosh, I forget. Eva's something the game right and they're creating a movie out of the game

01:02:32.330 --> 01:02:36.860
And I think they spoke to Tom Hanks, and he wants to be in it. Let me tell you about this movies

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:41.120
It's it's a it's an early project so who knows if it'll ever ever come to pass

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:46.250
But yes they want me to play the role, and I said look because of the cause I'll be involved with it

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:47.030
I'm not an actor

01:02:47.030 --> 01:02:50.999
I don't tend to be an actor, but I guess if the right thing comes up

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:58.140
And it works for you doing so I do know that you had some experience with movies in the past that you you know

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:00.839
Had somebody that work with you that you know you

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:04.319
funded some movies a quarter million dollars that led to another half a million dollars, so

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:07.109
There are some stories about what are you working on nowadays?

01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:10.620
What are some projects you're working on nowadays a couple of things are real exciting

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:15.989
hi, my main project right now is I'm doing a stage show in Las Vegas and

01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:20.850
It's the history of the mob in Las Vegas set to music and dance

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:26.279
It's a musical Wow and we're telling the whole history of the mob from the 1950s

01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:32.639
Okay, when they got involved and actually created Vegas right through the 80s when they kind of were pushed out

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:39.119
And I'm gonna narrate it actually on stage and a little bit of my story's gonna be interspersed in that the way

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.940
We've designed it, but it's a really cool project. I'm very excited about it's gonna appear at the Plaza downtown

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:47.730
We have a marketing

01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:52.350
Arrangement with the mob museum, that's a that's a big museum downtown and now Vegas

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:56.339
Have a relationship with them there and it's going to premiere in May of next year

01:03:56.530 --> 01:04:01.590
so I have that and I've got two television projects one is a

01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:04.110
scripted series called American royalty

01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:09.390
And that is the history of the mob in New York from the 50s right through the mid 70s

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:12.180
And we're going to tell the story of the five families

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:19.799
And I'm really excited about the project cuz I'm with a great company and they put together a great showrunner and writer which got

01:04:20.020 --> 01:04:23.219
You know tremendous credits, and I think that's gonna go next year

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:29.370
and I'm doing a true-crime unscripted show that's called a mafia democracy and

01:04:30.010 --> 01:04:31.330
basically

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:39.120
The theme of the show is that we're going to highlight cases where the government was complicit in framing somebody

01:04:40.030 --> 01:04:41.140
and

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.970
We're gonna be holding the government accountable

01:04:42.970 --> 01:04:48.540
In cases like that the first case that we're gonna highlight in the first season is my father's case Wow

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:52.829
We're gonna tell that whole story. I believe one in six episode does he know about it

01:04:52.930 --> 01:04:59.219
He does and I said to him dad for 50 years. You've been complaining that you've been framed

01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:03.449
I believe he a lot of people believe you, but you never want to talk about it on camera

01:05:03.670 --> 01:05:06.420
I said I'm going to do this show I said it

01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:09.659
But you have to get on camera and all you have to say is I was framed

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:15.000
I'm gonna ask you some questions, and you got to cooperate. You know what he says to me these let me ask my lawyer I

01:05:15.609 --> 01:05:18.269
Said dad you don't have a lawyer. I gave you a lawyer

01:05:18.270 --> 01:05:22.619
I said your lawyers gonna say yes, so you got to commit to me that you're going to do it so he committed

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:25.108
He said yes, that's cool. He's never been on account

01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:28.289
My dad has never said a word to the press has never been interviewed

01:05:28.329 --> 01:05:32.309
So this would be the first time the oldest made guy in America

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.970
Okay

01:05:32.970 --> 01:05:37.829
is finally gonna be on camera and say some things and I said you don't have to admit who you are what you did or

01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:41.789
What you were involved in I'm gonna get him to do that anyway, but uh yeah

01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:44.699
He's agreed and III think it's important you know again

01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:48.659
When people understand I'm not anti-government. I'm not anti law-enforcement

01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:53.550
I have many friends in law enforcement my brothers in Christ in full enforcement

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:59.159
And I tell people I have five daughters when they walk down the street. I expect blunt force them to spell heck down

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:03.839
Yeah, I'm a friend to law enforcement, but what I don't like is when they go rogue

01:06:03.839 --> 01:06:06.809
And they frame people and they put people who are in they destroy lives

01:06:06.910 --> 01:06:10.349
They have enough weapons and tools to play by the rules and go

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:16.050
And go and get people the right way and most good people in law enforcement feel the same way

01:06:16.079 --> 01:06:20.429
So I'm not you know. I'm not going against them, but to me. It's an exciting series

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:23.669
It's kind of like you know John Walsh in America's Most Wanted

01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:27.869
He had a personal stake in this and I'm gonna host that series

01:06:27.869 --> 01:06:29.869
it looks like they wanted to do that and

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:34.319
Hopefully that'll be a success and I'll have the right impact and I be honest we Patrick

01:06:34.319 --> 01:06:38.999
I don't think has ever been a time in my lifetime. Where a show like this would be more relevant

01:06:39.819 --> 01:06:41.849
Then dealing with government

01:06:41.849 --> 01:06:46.799
It's not great to I know it's not no it's not and you kind of talked about in the end of your book

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:49.739
You know if there's anything I would say when you buy the book

01:06:50.319 --> 01:06:53.369
I'll make you an offer you can refuse the last chapter

01:06:53.770 --> 01:06:59.609
Really gets into your beliefs about the government and politics and all that which I think it's very fascinating

01:07:00.130 --> 01:07:05.190
Maybe we can talk about that on another time, but guys again. If you haven't read the book go buy the book

01:07:05.190 --> 01:07:09.929
We'll put a link on the bottom Michael. Thank you so much for opening Thank You electric appreciation. Thank you

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.920
you
