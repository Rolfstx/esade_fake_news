00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.950
Hello friends! Three years ago I
installed a bear-proof door on my log

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.200
cabin that I'm building in the remote
location of Karelia the door has a

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.340
time-tested design with a couple of
interesting design ideas that are worth

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.400
mentioning here a few words for my
first-time viewers I've been developing

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.369
my log cabin camp in the northern forest
away from people and roads since 2014

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.350
during our short summer we have White
Nights so I could accomplish a lot even

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.739
in the span of one month summer vacation
here are a few examples of what I was

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.440
able to build here in five years I made
this primitive fire-carved log furniture

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.680
using trees downed by a severe storm I
built dam and a small pond with a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.050
step-down ladder at the local stream
built a hybrid tent / bed from

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.460
recycled materials such as this
PET rope cut from plastic bottles

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:12.750
I also made a storage dome for slabs and
boards using sticks and stretch film in

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.159
addition I cleaned the campsite from
fallen trees which I recycled for my

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.189
log cabin construction I decided to
build my cabin without chopping down a

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.729
single live tree using a round notch
reinforced with a square peg also known

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.799
as the saddle cope many of the downed
trees were huge

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:42.420
which is why my cabin was atypically
built from extra-thick logs the roof was

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.520
built from halved logs with a polymer
underlayment installed under the sod to

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.799
protect the roof members from moisture
and UV light some of my other bushcraft

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.409
projects didn't get into this footage
but I will leave the links below let's

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.060
get back to the door story while
installing the bottom logs I drilled a

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.619
mortise for the door's bottom wooden
hinge and the upper mortise was drilled

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.770
a year later so now we need a door with
two rounded build-in tenons

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.730
that will act as primitive hinges to
complete the set two years ago I cut

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.280
narrow boards using a primitive sawmill
jig made from two jointed boards and a

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.810
couple of screws
however these boards are too narrow for

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.660
my door design I wanted to make it bear-proof using only two extra wide boards

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.720
that milled and dried last summer
I even bought a more powerful chainsaw

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.750
with a longer guide bar to be able to
milll extra wide slabs before milling

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.330
slabs I resharpened an original crosscut chain to 10 degrees using my

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.100
improvised vise made from a stump
besides acquiring a better chainsaw for

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:12.000
the task
I made a sawmill similar to the Logosol or Alaskan Mill however I realized
the jig will not work well for the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.490
boards required width as my Stihl MS260 couldn't handle even smaller than

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:26.130
needed logs that's okay though as I know
how to cut slabs freehand it is time to

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:33.570
go to the place where I found a huge
dried pine my traditional packframe

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.610
made from pine planks a bird cherry
branch and a rope cut from the bottle

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.950
will help me to bring my tools food and
video equipment to the site in one trip

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.410
I highly recommend you to make or buy a
packframe if you do similar activities

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.900
in the woods
I found this dried pine last summer not

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.090
far from my camp the bottom section has
started to rot but the rest of the trunk

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.060
is still intact and dry it is quite
dense to

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.360
it is not difficult to cut a branchless
tree trunk all you have to do is to cut

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.549
out a deep wedge on one side and make a
partial straight cut a little higher on

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.340
the opposite side of the trunk then you
simply hammer in a wedge into the

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.880
straight cut this is one of the easiest
and safest ways to cut down a tree

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.639
however if the tree is asymmetrical in
shape or has a lot of its branches on

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:40.130
one side you will might need to use a
different method I dropped this dried

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.620
pine on a few skinny logs that I laid
out in advance this way it will be easier

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.590
to mill the door slabs later I have two
doorways in my cabin so I need to cut

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.830
four wide slabs for two doors I cut the
slabs longer than needed as you can

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.130
always cut them shorter naturally dried
northern pine is called "Kelo" in

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.950
Finnish because it is considered to be
valuable in natural circumstances very

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:16.990
old pine trees usually die while
standing and then slowly dry for years

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.539
"Kelo" logs and slabs are fairly dense and
don't crack as they lose wood stresses

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:31.340
during natural drying processes over the
years while standing vertically the core

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.100
of the "Kelo" is light while the sapwood
is colored gray by fungus that lived

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:43.970
there during the drying process the
fungus has been dead in it for years and

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:50.180
you can safely use this slab for
construction I actually kind of like

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.880
it's golden-grayishglow when you apply
oil on it you can tell that the "Kelo"

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:03.139
board is very old and has seen a lot
during its lifespan all of the "Kelo's"

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.930
sap has fully crystallized by now making
the wood extra dense which means you

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.660
have to resharpen your carpentry tools
more frequently

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.690
I have shown how to effectively cut a
log into boards without any sawmill

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:23.610
attachments in one of my previous videos
I will leave a link to it below in case

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.280
you wanted to see it in more detail for
now I will just say this it is easier

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.840
and faster to cut large slabs with the
bottom tip of your chainsaw using

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:39.210
swinging motions than when using mini
sawmill attachments this free-handed

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:44.720
slab cutting technique is three times
faster and takes half the amount of gas

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:54.750
those are the numerical facts I was able
to measure okay

00:06:54.750 --> 00:07:01.620
the last slab is milled and I can now
check their quality and geometry all four

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.600
slabs passed my quality control and now it
is time to take them back to the camp

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:13.980
closer to my log cabin I put the glove
under the slab to cushion my shoulder

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:21.840
and started to make my way back while
carrying the slab I couldn't help to be

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:28.890
glad that the "Kelo" wood is so dry and
comparatively light also I was happy

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:34.260
that this log was located right in the
trail that I cleared a few years ago so

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.320
I didn't have to struggle through shrubs
or a typical Karelian rocky terrain

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:47.280
those soothing thoughts were giving me
needed strength and again a few good

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.320
words about my trusty packframe after
feeling pretty tired from carrying the

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.240
first slab I decided to carry the rest
of them using my packframe's upper arch

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.730
as a back support this unusual carrying
technique is a lot more ergonomic

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:09.780
spreading the slab's weight evenly on my
arms and shoulders there was another log

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:15.360
section from the same tree that I wanted
to mill into slabs but I had to leave it

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:21.960
to rot there because my Stihl MS 260 failed me the next day look at

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.480
what happened to its cylinder-piston group
Stihl service told me I was using a bad

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.490
fuel mixture but they couldn't explain
to me why the same fuel mixture poured

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:39.060
from one tank didn't do any damage to my
20 year old Stihl MS 180 I wonder if

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:44.640
the real reason is that the new MS 260
was made in Brazil while my trusty MS

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:50.550
180 was still made in the USA two
decades ago there is no time to get

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:56.240
upset though I need to make a temporary
woodworking bench under the open sky I

00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.620
just milled a horizontal surface on a
fallen tree and stretched a tent above

00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:07.280
it to get an all-weather temporary
woodworking shop with a steady workbench

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:13.140
while making my door with round tenon
hinges I decided to cut out the round

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:19.380
tenons first this way the large board
is cut to its size and it is easier to

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:25.710
shift it around on my workbench I took
my time to the layout job because there

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.630
was only one chance to do it right I
don't have spare dried boards of that

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:36.870
size laying around this is when the
carpenter's mantra "Measure twice cut once"

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:43.410
really came in handy I made a couple of
precise cuts and carefully shaped the

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:49.710
round tenon this slab got noticeably
lighter there will be two tenons on the

00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:56.580
door so I shaped the second tenon in
the same way the second board just

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:01.500
needed to be cut to size to tightly fit
the doorway that was installed into the

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:09.030
cabin two years ago this old 
inexpensive hand plane is still doing a

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:16.170
decent job in smoothing the slab ideally
a jointer plane would be better but

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:22.680
it was too heavy to bring it here so I
will have to work with what I have it is

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:28.290
a pleasure to make shavings with a hand
plane arguably it is the most classical

00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:35.160
woodworking activity out of them all now
we can shape the square tenons using a

00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:41.000
handsaw a chisel 
and a hammer note the tenons are 52

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.150
millimeters (two inches) in diameter while
this slab is 80 millimeters (three in a

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:53.630
quarter) each tenon is cut asymmetrically
to be flush with the inner side of the

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:58.880
door such asymmetry is needed to
maximize the door's range of motion and

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:06.950
to prevent air drafting okay both door
tenons / hinges are cut and we can join

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:14.720
both boards together my new two and a
half inch wide (6 cm) chisel

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.880
would have come in handy now but I still
managed to do a decent job with a small

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:33.800
chisel back then I cut the angled sides
of the sliding dovetail joint using a

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:40.550
regular hacksaw I know it is not an
ideal saw to make such cuts but again

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:44.260
I used what I had at my disposal

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:51.050
it is raining but everything is dry in
my woodworking shop thanks to the canopy

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:57.589
stretched over and I can start to fit my
sliding dovetail joint I rubbed a piece

00:11:57.589 --> 00:12:02.089
of charcoal on the plank and it will
show where the plank is getting tight

00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:11.690
inside the sliding dovetail all you have
to do is to use a sharp chisel to

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:15.800
slightly remove the marked area and
methodically repeat the procedure till

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:22.940
you achieve the desired fit chiseling is
a simple but tedious work that I kind of

00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.650
welcome in such times when it is raining
outside and I can't really do any other

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:33.500
projects at the camp or in the woods of
course it is not necessary to have such

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:37.520
a perfect joint fit in the log cabin's
door but since I'm enjoying this process

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.770
and I have time why not

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:47.890
when I finished fitting the horizontal
door rails I rounded over the door's back

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:56.860
edge the rounded edge will allow the
door to open all the way note it is

00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:02.350
important not to remove too much of the
door's material as it could result in creating a

00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:07.530
gap between the door and the doorway in the
closed position

00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:11.770
okay the rain finally stopped and I can
take the hinged

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:17.770
board to the log cabin and try it on I
would say the slab lost almost half of

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:22.930
its weight by feel through the whole
process or perhaps I was too excited to

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:29.200
start the door fitting I tried the board
in the doorway many times each time

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:34.800
making small adjustments to the wooden
hinges but it was an enjoyable activity

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:40.120
I've never seen doors with build-in wooden
hinges before which is why even a

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.430
partial success would have made me happy

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.410
as a continues the door fitting process I
grew to like its primitive and reliable

00:13:50.410 --> 00:13:56.350
design even anymore when you come to
knock on such a door you could instantly

00:13:56.350 --> 00:14:02.560
tell that people who live in the house
are hardly superficial in order to do

00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:07.210
the full installation of the door with
built-in wooden hinges I had to lift a

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:11.290
large sum of weight
this included the doorway's head along

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:16.630
with the whole roof that is made of logs
and halved logs plus the weight of the wet

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:25.210
sod as you probably guessed I used two
wedges to accomplish this task the wedges

00:14:25.210 --> 00:14:31.540
have to be strong so I made them from
the oiliest branches that I could find

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:38.230
I will be honest I enjoyed that
fidgeting process and even thought to

00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:42.990
myself that perhaps the second door
should be a double door like in a saloon

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:50.139
but maybe I watched too many Westerns
back in the day I owe you an explanation as to

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:56.620
why I'm making two doors in my log cabin
and why they open outside some will say

00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:02.259
they need to open inwards especially in
this area where snow can block in the door

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:07.980
from outside why do you think I made
them open outwards nevertheless?

00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:15.130
talk to me in the comments below I'd
like to hear your version I probably

00:15:15.130 --> 00:15:19.329
tired you with my comments by now so I
will let you watch the rest of the

00:15:19.329 --> 00:15:23.130
fitting process without them

00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:53.870
okay now we can assemble two slabs and
two rails into the door to avoid gaps I

00:17:53.870 --> 00:18:01.640
decided to plane matching grooves and
put a spline in between the boards I've

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:07.480
never used a plough plane before but I
like cutting long grooves with it a lot

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:13.370
a plough plane is a very simple tool it's
literally a chisel-like cutter affixed

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:18.830
in a jig at an angle plus an adjustable
side rail if you leave the side rail in

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:23.419
the same position and make two long
grooves in both boards they will

00:18:23.419 --> 00:18:29.750
inevitably match like a mirror image
okay now I will make short perpendicular

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:35.270
splines to install them into the
corresponding grooves at that stage I

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:39.590
had some difficulties because my
makeshift workbench was not specialized

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:45.280
enough for the task and I was using a
ratchet strap to hold down a short plank

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:51.950
this is when I decided to make a shaving
horse the next season here is a little

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:56.990
preview how it was made the next summer
if there is enough interest in my

00:18:56.990 --> 00:19:02.200
audience I will make a separate video
about the shaving horse

00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:08.669
but let's get back to the door project I
finally have all of the necessary door

00:19:08.669 --> 00:19:14.220
members in place and it is time to put
it all together if I had made any

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:19.500
mistakes in my calculations I would have
to make another door as the doorway is

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:24.659
already installed but the careful
measuring and layout paid off and this

00:19:24.659 --> 00:19:31.200
door turned out to be nearly perfect in
its dimensions the assembly process is

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.820
fairly straightforward and I will let
you watch it while enjoying the sounds

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:42.929
of pure bushcrafting I will only add
that I reinforced the rails with dowels

00:19:42.929 --> 00:19:48.179
and made sure there is an adequate gap
between the door and doorway to

00:19:48.179 --> 00:19:54.390
compensate for seasonal wood expansion
and contraction this is Max Egorov from

00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:59.460
Saint Petersburg Russia if you liked
this video perhaps you could share it

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:05.610
with your friends let good people
watch good videos p.s. I only produce

00:20:05.610 --> 00:20:10.890
one or two videos max a month and if you
don't want to miss new content like this

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:15.390
subscribe and click the notification
bell to stay up to date with all of the

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:20.730
latest content due to new youtube's
recommendation algorithm its

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:26.760
notifications  have become more erratic
and unstable otherwise I hope to see

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.929
back on Advoko MAKES...
