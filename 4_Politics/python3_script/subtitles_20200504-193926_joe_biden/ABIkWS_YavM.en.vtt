00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:13.020
The global petroleum industry lives and dies
by the price of oil.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.580
This number—a gauge of the average amount
paid for a barrel, 42 gallons, or 159 liters—is

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.410
responsible for enormous shifts in the field.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.970
Shifts that lead to the rise of some nations,
and the fall of others.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.300
Shifts that change where and how people get
their energy.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.199
That’s because, just because there’s more
or less one global price, there are innumerable

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:42.460
different production costs depending on where
and how the oil is extracted.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.920
One country’s barrel of oil can cost dozens
of times more than another’s, but then even

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.100
within the same country the costs are not
the same.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.260
It’s more of a curve.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.229
A given country’s cost looks more or less
like this.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:01.089
At a lower level of production, the average
overall cost to produce a barrel of oil would

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:07.350
be a certain amount but then, as total production
increases, that average per-barrel cost also

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.960
increases up until a point where the curve
turns into a nearly vertical line, because

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.170
a country’s production capacity has been
reached.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.430
This is because oil is found in plenty of
different places.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.910
Sometimes it’s found under a big empty field
near a major road, but sometimes its found

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.240
under thousands of feet of ocean nowhere near
the coast.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.650
Between these two, it’s pretty easy to understand
where it would be more expensive to extract.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.530
On that national cost curve, though, one must
also put a horizontal line.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.630
That’s the oil price.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.470
If the price is here, then it makes sense
to produce up to that amount of oil.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.020
Any more and a barrel of oil would cost more
to produce than what it sells for.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.610
If the oil price moves up, though, then it
makes sense to increase production even when

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.460
it raises the cost per barrel, and that’s
what happened for most of the last fifty years.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.780
The oil price rose, with some up and down,
from $20 in 1973 to a peak of over $140 in

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.780
2008.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.890
Throughout that time, as long as an oil company
could find a way to produce a barrel of oil

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.930
for less than the current price, they were
guaranteed a profit.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.530
That’s what brought them from the field
to the ocean.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.660
Offshore oil rigs are inherently a higher-cost,
higher-risk method of oil extraction, but

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.500
the oceans are, of course, home to a huge
proportion of the world’s oil reserves so,

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.030
if there are no more low-cost oilfields on
land, that’s where the companies go.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.959
Before starting operations, though, these
companies need to decide exactly where to

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:43.959
go.

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.209
Now, usually, oil platforms are installed
where there are already plenty of other platforms

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.940
such as in the Persian Gulf, the Gulf of Mexico,
or the North Sea.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.330
They cluster together.

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.439
Within these areas, though, they need to determine
which exact spot has the greatest potential

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.870
for oil extraction, so geologists conduct
surveys using ships and satellite imagery.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.969
Once that spot is selected, a rig will be
towed to its location and installed.

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.950
Once they’re put in location, offshore oil
platforms often don’t move for years—they’re

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.999
intended for long-term operation in a single
spot.

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:21.620
Despite this, though, they operate quite differently
from ships.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.639
Usually, those working onboard have a shift
of 12 hours a day, every day, for a period

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:31.169
of two or three weeks, followed by two or
three weeks off onshore.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.000
Keeping those work hours dense means that
fewer people onboard are not working at a

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.150
given time, which means that less space is
needed for accommodations.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.950
But of course, this pattern means that there’s
quite a lot of back and forth between shore

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.099
and rig.

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:47.599
For that, they use helicopters.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.439
This is actually one of the largest commercial
applications of helicopters and huge companies

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.779
have emerged, especially in the past few decades,
to serve offshore oil rigs.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:04:02.120
For example, Bristow Aviation, one of the
largest, has a fleet of almost 500, mostly

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.559
used to make these offshore flights.

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:09.529
The North Sea oil field is primarily linked
with Aberdeen, Scotland, onshore, at least

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.309
for its UK-owned or operated platforms.

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:17.019
Aberdeen airport—a primarily regional airport
that only has commercial passenger flights

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:23.000
to a couple dozen European destinations—happens
to be the world’s busiest heliport.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.010
About 100 large helicopters take off from
here each day, mostly flying out to the North

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:29.140
Sea.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.710
But Aberdeen is also linked to the oil fields
another way.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.280
It serves as a hub for the ships that service
the rigs.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.130
Now, especially in the North Sea, oil makes
its way from the rigs to shore by undersea

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.570
pipeline, so there isn’t a need to bring
much back, but they do need to be frequently

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.940
replenished with supplies—both for the humans,
and the rig’s operations.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.790
That’s the job of platform supply vessels,
which are essentially mini, short-range, flexible

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.140
cargo ships.

00:04:56.140 --> 00:05:01.070
Aberdeen Harbor is always abuzz with activity,
filing up these vessels, to keep the hundreds

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.870
of offshore platforms themselves supplied.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:09.090
Onboard, there are essentially three types
of jobs: production, those directly involved

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.360
with the extraction and processing of oil,
maintenance, those who keep the facilities

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.290
and equipment in working order, and service,
those who cook or clean or care for the rest

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:19.290
of the crew.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.300
There’s always a focus, within the companies
operating these platforms, to minimize the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.940
numbers of people working actually onboard
as much as possible.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.740
It’s expensive first to transport and supply
these workers, and then their salaries are

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.560
also considerably higher than typical onshore
salaries in the petroleum industry.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.420
An average offshore salary in the UK is around
60 or 70 thousand dollars—nearly double

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.310
the national average wage.

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.830
Therefore, most management and high-level
decisions are made by workers back onshore

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.340
who video conference in to the platforms to
coordinate.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.350
Workers onboard are, for the most part, strictly
operational.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.820
On the inside, these platforms look a lot
like ships.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.770
The rooms are small and the recreation areas
are sparse.

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.540
There isn’t, after all, much down-time given
the long hours while onboard.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.810
The platforms are more or less self-sufficient.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:14.400
Even though they’re usually within a couple
hundred miles of shore, ships only resupply

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:20.370
sporadically and helicopter flights are expensive,
so water and electricity are produced onboard.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.110
As you would image, the rigs themselves are
also hugely expensive to build.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:31.530
That’s because, what you see, the platform,
is only a small component of the overall structure.

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.481
With all designs, there’s hundreds or thousands
of feet of undersea drilling equipment, but

00:06:36.481 --> 00:06:39.140
with some, there’s far more.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.970
Certain platforms are floating, anchored to
the ocean floor, but others are rather massive

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:45.800
undersea towers.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.160
The tallest in existence is the Petronius
platform which has almost 2,000 feet or 600

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.680
meters of undersea towering to support the
platform itself.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.440
This made it, until the opening of the Burj
Khalifa in 2010, the tallest free-standing

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.380
structure in the world.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:05.890
The development, construction, and installation
costs of this platform were therefore about

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.390
$500 million.

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:13.280
And, in fact, those costs are completely typical,
if not low.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.700
Plenty of platforms cost far closer to a billion
dollars.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:23.130
So, the question that oil companies are now
beginning to pose would be: is it worth it?

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.910
Well, there’s the short-term answer to that
question and there’s the long-term answer.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.280
In the short-term, the answer is definitively
no.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.630
At the time of writing, in April 2020, oil
prices are hovering in the 20s of dollars

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:41.450
per barrel—artificially lowered by a price
war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, and naturally

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.080
lowered by a drop in demand due to the COVID-19
pandemic.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:50.000
There likely is not a single offshore oil
platform in the world turning a profit at

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.400
those prices.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.460
Places like the North Sea, which have particularly
high costs due to their workforce coming from

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.200
relatively high-wage countries like Scotland,
England, and Norway, have seen their output

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.820
reduced since oil reached a peak price up
until 2014.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.570
It’s just far cheaper to buy oil from onshore
production facilities.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:14.710
So, in the year of 2020, oil platforms just
don’t make sense.

00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:19.820
In the longer term, though, oil platforms
could turn a profit, and that’s why they’re

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.820
kept around.

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.870
In a high-price oil environment, there likely
isn’t enough onshore capacity to fulfill

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:31.310
demand and so these offshore platforms are
how oil companies fulfill demand to increase

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.310
profits.

00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:36.990
There’s much less short-term flexibility
with offshore platforms than on-shore installations,

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:42.120
so typically the oil platforms are kept running,
in the medium-term, and then in the short-term

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.580
onshore production is scaled more to demand.

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:49.420
But there are long-term costs that oil companies
might not have fully previously considered

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:53.610
when offshore production first began at a
large scale decades ago.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:59.160
This was all realized with the BP Deepwater
Horizon platform’s explosion and subsequent

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.630
oil spill in 2010.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:06.180
Almost 5 million barrels spilled out into
the Gulf of Mexico.

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.860
The full economic and environmental costs
are still not fully realized, a decade later,

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:15.930
and they certainly far eclipse the costs borne
by BP itself, but the company spent about

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.340
$65 billion cleaning up and settling claims
related to the incident, and their market

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:22.490
value dropped by about $60 billion.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:25.940
That’s equivalent to about two to three
years of their profit.

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.550
And it’s not like the Deepwater Horizon
will be the last oil spill.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:35.320
There might have been reforms, and there might
be more attention, but oil spills are just

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.510
a byproduct of the business.

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.570
The immense cost they impose on both the companies
responsible, and the areas they alter will

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.920
not go away.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.740
Even without considering their immense environmental
cost, to the company, oil platforms have emerged

00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.730
as high-risk, low-reward alternatives to onshore
extraction methods.

00:09:55.730 --> 00:10:01.720
That’s not a desirable combination by itself,
and its coupled with widespread public sentiment

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.370
against offshore drilling.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:08.779
That’s a losing combination, for everyone,
and for that reason, there really hasn’t

00:10:08.779 --> 00:10:13.080
been any expansion in the industry in the
past decade and a half.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.660
The world has been producing about 20 million
barrels of oil from offshore sources per day

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:22.790
since about 2005, despite oil demand increasing,
and yet there’s little evidence that this

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:26.400
will ramp up in the future in a free-market
environment.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:30.860
The only reason it might is if governments
artificially prop up this production method

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:34.110
in order to ensure their oil needs are fulfilled
domestically.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:39.160
That’s possible in a place like the UK,
with vast offshore production but very limited

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.760
onshore, but with the recent decline in North
Sea oil, it’s not a future that oil companies

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:48.089
themselves are likely interested in pursuing.

00:10:48.089 --> 00:10:52.690
This isn’t some great win for the environment,
though—onshore extraction is hardly better

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:57.470
than offshore—but it does mean that, in
the current oil environment, the makeup of

00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:04.310
who, how, and where the world gets its energy
is changing ever faster.

00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:09.000
The story of the Deepwater Horizon explosion
and spill is a fascinating one, and there’s

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.110
a great book that goes into immense detail
of the saga the workers on the platform went

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.500
through to save lives and escape in its first
hours.

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.710
It’s called Fire on the Horizon, and it
gives a fantastic glimpse into the perils

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:23.060
of such a job.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.120
Like many great stories, it is available as
an audiobook on Audible, so that means that,

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:33.681

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:39.420
If that doesn’t sound like your thing, though,
and you’re a sci-fi fan like me, I would

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.430
wholeheartedly recommend Recursion by Blake
Crouch.
