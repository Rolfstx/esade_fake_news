Hey everybody say hi. Say hi. Oh, you can't say hi

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.460
She is a hat

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.320
You have to take a leap of faith in yourself no matter what

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.199
It is in life like take that leap of faith and know that you can do whatever you want to do. I

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.349
Was in a really really really bad place and I got friends to friend request from Chris on Facebook

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.870
And I was like what the heck I'm never gonna meet him

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.439
except a one thing led to another and

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.009
Eight years later. We have two kids

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.539
We live in Colorado and he's the best thing and that has ever happened to me and because of my health challenges

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.070
Because I got so sick. I let him in and

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.639
He only knew me at that time. He knew me at my worst and he accepted me

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.100
You know through

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.959
Your vows like through sicknesses and everything. He's been there

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.119
He was the one that let me lay on him and fall asleep for three and a half hours on his lap while he had

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.990
a pee

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.199
He is the best thing that has ever

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.470
Ever happened to me. So but that being said

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.500

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.099
Know that deep down like in your heart that there's a purpose

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.809
There's a reason for everything. We may not understand it at the time

Really digging deep in me. It could be

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:28.050
Four to six weeks since if and how they have all their little stories, they don't know outside

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.370

Anything that I haven't asked that you think I should know it was just odd or something you thought was weird

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.219
I wouldn't think anything is weird from over there because

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:11.069
Normally you Hadley ever see anyone go in come out now. I saw his Charlie yesterday

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:24.159

Was at the great truck or truck was that there was his regular truck big truck

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.229
Okay, can you speak up just a little bit so the recorder I know you're tired and you're stressed

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:16.839
And we won't be here any longer than we have to be that you've already had a conversation with people before

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:23.109
You came here on your own free will to talk to us. We picked you up and at your request and brought you here you

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:27.939
Can get up and leave at any time. You don't have to talk to us if there's a question

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.650
You don't want to answer don't answer it

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:33.939
if you don't want to talk anymore, just tell me I want to tell me I want to leave and

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.479
I'm kind of in the way of the door, but you're not being

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.460
You're not being

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.270
Interrogated as a criminal suspect we're here to understand

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:48.459
your relationship with Chris and what you know about Chris and his family and

00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:57.520
Events relating to Chris Watts. Okay. So let's just start with like a timeline of your

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:00.830
Getting to know

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:07.240
Chris how you guys met where you met all those things. Let's just run and I'm not gonna ask you specific questions with us

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.299
I think it's necessary. I'll let you just tell me your story

00:20:10.419 --> 00:20:14.349
I think it's a little bit easier that way so I just want to know how you met him where you met him

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:16.350
How long you guys were dating?

00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:38.599
To measure the flow through your body during the test

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:02.329
Let's look back for the math. Oh, sorry

00:21:05.159 --> 00:21:06.470
Man

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:11.209
What that does is obviously detect motion and movement in your body

00:21:11.490 --> 00:21:14.899
So that how important it will be that you remain completely still during the testing

00:21:15.809 --> 00:21:20.898
If you move your little toe yeah, you know, it's lifting weight of everything happens from your core

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.260
You move your little toe our suit and a register online on my iPad. So it's very very sensitive

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:31.760
so that's how important to be a feeling completely still so what we call a

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.370
Directed line rektage test, okay

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.130
My chair over here

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.280
so obviously a director by factor test and it gets you a

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:46.680
Indication that it probably wanting to lie on the practice. I'm sorry. I don't want you to lie yet

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.499
I will tell you what at that point that I want you to lie, okay?

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:58.109
How many numbers you get into paper for which what's been named three? I want you to write the number three online works missing

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.420
Okay correctly use your right or your left hand

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.560
Are you right-handed?

00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.560
Right, okay

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:09.520
Pretty good

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.739
Okay a lot of time. Hmm. So this is the door to my practice head

00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.540
So what that means is I'm going to ask you if you row every single number on this piece of paper

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.170
Okay, so I want you to be truthful to all the numbers

00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:24.989
But I want you to like when I asked you if you wrote the number three

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.820
You really did write the retrieve that I want you to say no that you did not want you to lie to me. Okay?

00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.909
Okay, so during the trust me I'm gonna leave this right here. You need to look in the area of this clipboard

00:22:36.010 --> 00:22:41.640
you can't look side to side up down wherever Chris wants to look you don't have the six a online or three but you're gonna

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.430
Be looking

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:45.359
Visually in this general area right here. Okay, so

00:22:51.490 --> 00:22:55.829
I will tell you when the test is going to begin and then I will tell you where the test is going to end

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:06.640
You

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:16.429
The test is about to begin please remain still

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.749
Regarding this number URL and piece of paper. Did you write the number one?

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.200
Did you write the number two

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:31.429
Did you write the number three No

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:58.330
Did you write to number four no

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:24.489
Did you write the number five No

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.799
This portion of the test is complete please remain still I take the instrument out of

00:26:00.429 --> 00:26:03.089
Operational Valley and feel

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:10.679
The gray noise remember to lie and everything I was awesome those

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.819
So you always be a really bad liar

00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:19.710
have people told you that before like the thing you tell a lie, like they can tell like on your face that

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:22.620
Because it's shaking you lied to them over three

00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:27.059
Like I know if you heard me cooking and like turn down the sensitivity because you're starting to go off the page

00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:33.269
So that is what I need to see as the pellagra fer because that telling me that you know, what's wrong to tell a lie

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:39.899
And you're actually having a significant reaction when you lie, so that it's awesome. So thank you for being a liar

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.599
Thing that's a good thing. We don't want to because liars. So, thank you for being a horrible liar

00:26:47.049 --> 00:26:49.409
he doesn't have a wedding ring on his finger and

00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:56.069
Every time I talked to him, he didn't tell me that he was in a relationship. He didn't mention his kids right away either

00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:02.309
And then one day and he told me that he had two kids I was like that's pretty cool

00:27:03.130 --> 00:27:08.189
And they're talking about his kid that sounded like a sarcastic. Um, no, I thought it was kind of cute

00:27:08.190 --> 00:27:11.669
I was like, oh, he's a dad. It was like right around Father's Day, too

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:16.230
Because we don't have it on tape we discussed prior to turning the tape on

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:19.140
on

00:27:19.179 --> 00:27:22.798
Tuesday, which would have been the 14th of August you

00:27:23.710 --> 00:27:28.199
Had read some newspaper articles on the 13th from the 14 that regarded this case

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.589
Yeah, almost I had a conversation with Chris at some point during the day on Monday

00:27:32.530 --> 00:27:33.820
and on Tuesday

00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:38.429
Because of what you found specifically what you said was and I'm telling them he put words in your mouth

00:27:38.429 --> 00:27:40.499
but you found out that his

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.360
Wife was pregnant

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:50.760
Yes, and you did not know that prior and you found that out via the newspaper articles, and that caused you

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:58.249
Well, I just realized that he was lying to me and I was like well if you can lie to me about this what else

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:03.320
He lying to me about and it made me realize that maybe his wife was in danger at that point and it was day 2

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.330
- and she still wasn't home

00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:11.089
Tonight we have someone who claims to be from Chris Watts past

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:19.219
Chris Watts recent past and we are not going to show you this person because he wants to continue his life without

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:26.599
Consequences for speaking out in this case, but we are going to let him tell his part of how he connects to this story

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.560
This is a story that we have to be honest with you

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:36.109
We can't independently verify but it is a story that could be extremely telling as we try to figure out

00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:38.780
What happened in the Watts family?

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:46.459
This is a man who claims to be Chris Watts former lover and he joins me now live sir. Can you hear me? Okay, I

00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.690
count

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.899
Some of the stuff you're talking about. It's pretty hard to believe

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.530
And we're getting to the point where we're wondering if you're wasting your time

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.699
I mean, is there a question or I mean?

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:10.050
I don't know how you want me to respond that I didn't know what else you want me to

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:13.770
These are the challenges getting them, right

00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.849
You told us that you watched a video over and over

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:26.010
Okay, so we know that you're aware of everything that's out there and all you've talked about are things that anyone else knows you haven't

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:29.040
Brought forth any information you're having sex with a guy in this car

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:34.649
You don't know anything about him other than what the public knows about. Okay, he took $60 from him

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:38.040
You yourself admitted boutique home

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.950
And so now we're wondering if you're a hooker

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.300
Who maybe blew a guy who?

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:49.439
Was a murderer and maybe feels guilty about it or maybe feels like you're going to get in trouble about it. I don't know

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.600
What's going on with you? But I don't know why you're here tonight

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:04.109
So you just you already said but you remove the text messages I don't even all of his stuff because he lied to me

00:30:04.110 --> 00:30:07.229
I mean, that's what it was. It was it was a hurt. That made me

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:13.470
Delete it. And then it was the lie that made me start questioning everything else

00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:17.100
He'd been telling me for the last few days and that's when you decided to come forward. Yes

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:23.310
So just for context. Yeah, when people delete stuff off phones, usually we go

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.060
He he

00:30:30.250 --> 00:30:31.800
He lied to me. It just hurt

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.579
Like I had never felt like he never lied to me before and it was a big lie

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:39.960
I mean telling somebody that you're in the midst of a divorce and then you

00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:47.729
Have a wife that has a 15 week old baby on the way is a

00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:55.949
Huge huge thing and I was very taken back and I was just it was hurt. And so at that point I just I

00:30:57.550 --> 00:31:04.889
Like deleted it I had it I had a few more quick things to say to him and then I just

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:08.759
Got rid of him. That's literally what I did. I just cut him out of my life

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:14.099
It would honestly been like a bad breakup kind of thing. Like if none of this other stuff would have happened

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:17.939
That's what it would have been that would have been end of it. The information was not destroyed

00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:21.329
because there was anything in there that would help be

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:28.410
Harmful to you or potentially to Chris at this point, but harmful to you in particular. That's not what you do know

00:31:31.150 --> 00:31:33.150
Excuse my language this guy's an asshole

00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:38.849
So I'm getting it rid of it and I'm getting this stuff off my phone that was like me kicking him out of my life

00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:43.769
And then like I said, and then realizing that he lied that was when I was like, okay

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:49.199
Maybe his family is in danger and they're not coming back and they're not staying with a friend

00:31:50.950 --> 00:31:55.020
Okay, you let me know when you're ready begin during this part of time

00:31:55.020 --> 00:32:01.619
I want you to hug me from the back of the chair. Okay, not looking up downward side to side anything like that was

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:04.619
Your mom. No, it's getting race you

00:32:05.409 --> 00:32:12.359
Onto the clipboard go now. So your area of selfish is going to be like in this area. Okay. Yes. All right. You ready?

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.630
okay, so

00:32:16.090 --> 00:32:18.270
This is about to begin it remains still

00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:28.770
Regarding Shannon's disappearance you intend to answer all of the questions truthfully. Yes

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:35.549
Your first thing Christopher yes

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:42.669
Did you forgive me Tasha man's disappearance

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:54.479
Were you born in 1985? Yes

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:07.130
Are you lying about the last time you saw sugar no

00:33:15.570 --> 00:33:17.570
Do you know where she is now?

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.339
This portion the test is complete Sushma shall I take an instrument out of operation

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:38.789
Did he ever tell you that he loved you? Yes, he did. Did you ever tell him the same a couple times?

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:47.130
Now we're standing that today because that made those thoughts may have changed for you but on let's go

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:55.440
One Sunday into Monday or Monday. Did you did you still love him on those days? I think it was something where as I

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:59.460
said it a few times and I meant it but he

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:05.279
definitely felt the urge to say it to me a lot more than I did to him because it was just all very new to

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.940
Me and I was like take your time with this like you don't need to

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.790
To like rush that you know, like I remember when he was in, North Carolina

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:18.479
and he was like trying to patch things up with his wife and he told me he loved me and I was like

00:34:18.970 --> 00:34:20.740
don't say that to me like

00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:24.180
Please go try to fit and I mean that not might even be in that text to it's like don't

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:27.029
don't like don't say those words to me and

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:30.870
Then go try to make peace with your wife and lay in bed with another woman

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:33.809
Like just don't do that and I was like, it's not that I don't

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.600
Appreciate what you're saying to me. It's like just

00:34:38.830 --> 00:34:41.160
It just didn't sit right for me, you know

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:47.339
So I just feeling was like an insecurity where he had to say that to you. I don't know. I think he he like

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.949
Looking back at all this now I don't think he was trying to fix things with her

00:34:52.950 --> 00:34:59.430
so saying I love you to me seemed like probably something that he genuinely meant like I love this woman and

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.939
Regardless of where he was gonna end up that night

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:23.450
Clear

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.460
Testimony here, you know that

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:28.730
He did not match the polygraph test. Sure, okay

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:34.639
So now we need to talk about what actually happens thankfully here probably ready to do that. I

00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:42.409
Didn't lie to you on that polygraph, I promise Chris understo I

00:35:43.829 --> 00:35:45.829
Fell for me take a deep breath. I

00:35:47.369 --> 00:35:49.369
Want you to take a deep breath right now

00:35:56.250 --> 00:36:00.709
We're not we're not here to play games we're not here to do any of that. We just want to know what happened

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:04.909
So, can you start a new beginning to tell us what happened?

00:36:06.089 --> 00:36:10.489
Everything that I've told you I cannot lie on this polygraph I am

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:16.010
How much I get I tell you right now like it's not

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.500
An option right now. We cannot you do not ask why I don't know. I know you're being set this shows

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:26.479
That's why I'm a nation in issue right now the issue right now is what happened to Cheyenne?

00:36:27.359 --> 00:36:29.359
Ella and Celeste

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.960
This is where this is where the rubber meets the road with courage

00:36:34.170 --> 00:36:36.740
Like don't let this continue any longer, please

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:40.520
I'm not trying to hide anything. Continue. I

00:36:41.250 --> 00:36:43.250
want them back whole of like

00:36:44.220 --> 00:36:51.230
But you know, they're not coming back home. We're confused as to why you're not taking care of your beautiful children

00:36:53.039 --> 00:36:55.249
I'm on site area right now, right?

00:36:59.030 --> 00:37:01.030
They're bad

00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:03.609
We're for that

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:08.349
Chris right. Now your dad's outside across the country - hello, okay

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:14.259
We know that something happened to all three of them, but I want to know

00:37:14.839 --> 00:37:19.449
If something happened to these baby girls first that you had to take into your own hands

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:22.179
and deal with you're the queen of that portion and

00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:27.729
Maybe they're cleaned up after Shannon or you make the mistake and I

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:32.950
want to believe that maybe I ended it and you felt compelled to

00:37:34.369 --> 00:37:36.608
Fix this though should end it look bad

00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.660
That's what I that's what I want to believe

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:46.479
But I don't know you're not telling me that so makes me think the worst like

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.889
Did you I did not turn on three anomaly class your internship

00:37:52.819 --> 00:37:56.049
What if she Manziel tell us Chris

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:05.169
Chicks are crazy my daughters of us to do you want to bring him in here the

00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:11.440
Bike flew across the country and crashed him. How about this?

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:16.749
If we bring it down in here, would you please tell them what happened? I

00:38:20.569 --> 00:38:23.798
Come out here for like five hours and I'm like

00:38:24.799 --> 00:38:26.089
Absolutely

00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:27.859
before we get in

00:38:27.859 --> 00:38:29.859
tengo el dorado

00:38:29.900 --> 00:38:33.879
Well, I don't know that you want to get out there because there's a lot of people will go through the halls

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.109
Should we bring them in here?

00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:38.030
Don't step out

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:40.030
Well, how about this?

00:38:41.059 --> 00:38:44.709
If we bring in your dad, will you promise me he'll talk?

00:38:50.079 --> 00:38:52.079
The things you need

00:38:58.349 --> 00:39:04.488
Hey Christopher you have a how much timing you okay Kurt he was an Erica. Yes

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.660
Was no longer

00:39:12.989 --> 00:39:16.819
And this polygraph failed it

00:39:18.569 --> 00:39:21.169
Is a regional I should women anything

00:39:22.619 --> 00:39:24.619
They know I had a fair

00:39:25.619 --> 00:39:29.629
And then they know I can't think about that

00:39:31.349 --> 00:39:33.679
The ocean will tell them what's going on

00:39:35.489 --> 00:39:37.489
Really thing one

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:49.339
Protector what I want to protect their you don't want retirement she hurt

00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:58.480
And one of our New Yorker

00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.960
Shamino folks is the total death

00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.159
Most attention Joker

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.260
Not just this

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.940
screech

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:20.240
Going to be all the bodies off is on

00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:29.540
And you know what that I myself and nothing else to do

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:57.679
After days of searching and hoping for the best possible outcome

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:03.170
Yesterday Chris Watts the father and husband of those missing was arrested on suspicion of murder

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:08.269
And shortly after a body believed to be that of Shannon Watts was located nearby

00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:57.439
So what I would like to do is explain the procedures that we're going to use

00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:04.010
Regarding this sentencing hearing. Let me first say that I realize that the sentencing hearing is emotional for

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.800
many of us and

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.580
I

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:14.509
Expect that your behavior in the courtroom both in this courtroom and the overflow courtroom is appropriate

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:21.199
if the court determines that your demeanor behavior while in the court during the hearing is not

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:26.930
Appropriate I have advised the deputies that I will be asking you to be escorted out of the courtroom. So please

00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:29.960
Be mindful of your demeanor

00:43:30.750 --> 00:43:32.750
during the sentencing hearing

00:43:33.090 --> 00:43:37.279
So these are the procedures that we are going to use for the sentencing hearing

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:42.020
First the prosecution will have an opportunity to present evidence

00:43:43.410 --> 00:43:48.289
Once the prosecution finishes the defense will have an opportunity to present evidence

00:43:50.830 --> 00:43:52.830
Then if there are any

00:43:54.280 --> 00:44:01.019
Victims under the Victims Rights Act including Cindy and Ronnie Ronnie watts that have not been called by the prosecution or the defense

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:03.280
or any other

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:05.729
defined victims under the Victims Rights Act

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:11.790
They will have an opportunity to make a statement to the court as it relates to their rights under the Victims Rights Act

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.400
Good morning, mr. Risley. Good morning

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:29.560
I'd like to say to the corset

00:44:33.140 --> 00:44:38.349
Jana Bella and Nico 11 caring people that loves life

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:42.069
Did love being around people who loved him

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:45.849
They all said they always had good times

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:52.180
This is the first time they went to the beach this year and they'd loved it

00:44:53.960 --> 00:45:01.869
But god only knows what happened that night life will never be the same without seeing it it's less than Eko

00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.460
Had all their lives to live

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:10.180
They were taken by a heartless woman

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.229
This is the heartless one the evil monster

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:20.049
Who dare you take the lives of my daughter Shannon Bella Celeste and Nico. I

00:45:20.690 --> 00:45:25.719
Trusted you to take care of them and not kill them and they also trusted you

00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:31.779
The heartless monster and then you take them out like trash

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:35.140
You disgust me

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.360
They were loving and caring people

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:40.779
You may have taken their bodies from me

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.100
but you will never

00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.100
Take the love they had for me

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.609
They loved us more than you will ever know

00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.089
Because you know what? Look you don't know what love is

00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:57.399
Because if you did you would not have killed them you monster

00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.489
Thought you would get away with this. I

00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:06.789
Don't know how the cameras do not lie. You carry them out like trash

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.640
of the house

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.890
Yes

00:46:11.890 --> 00:46:13.890
I seen the videotape

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:22.540
You buried my my daughter Shannon and Nikko in a shallow grave and then you put balance the less in huge containers of crude oil

00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.080
You heartless monster?

00:46:25.370 --> 00:46:27.370
you have

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.759
You have to live with this vision every day of your life

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.719
And I hope you see that every time you close your eyes at night. Oh

00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:39.219
I forgot you have no heart or feelings or love

00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:45.670
Let me tell you something. I will think of them every day of my life and I love them every day of my life

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:48.790
Prison is too good for you

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:53.950
This this is hard to say, but may God have mercy on your soul. I

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.209
Hope you enjoy your new life. It's nothing like the one you have out here

00:46:58.910 --> 00:47:00.999
May the courts have no mercy on you

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:05.229
It's hard every day. It hurts in so many ways. I

00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:12.670
Have heard people say that you're not a monster. No, you are not you're an evil monster

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.009
Thank you, love you Shannon bail and you go

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:20.680
Love you pop up and dip

00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:24.219
and one other thing and Shin says

00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:29.980
She is super excited for justice today, thank you

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Your Honor Frankie Bruce of jr

00:47:39.369 --> 00:47:43.979
He has asked me to read his statement before him but he would like to stand with me if that's okay

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:47.699
Of course you went from being my brother. My sister's protector

00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:53.010
One of the most loved people in my family to someone I will spend the rest of my life trying to understand

00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:55.769
What gave you the right to put your hands on a woman?

00:47:55.839 --> 00:48:02.459
Let alone my best friend my beloved sister your daughters and your son. Why weren't they enough for you?

00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:07.740
In the blink of an eye, you took away my whole world the people that mattered to me the most

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:13.229
Everything in my life. I loved your children. They trusted you they loved you

00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:16.199
They looked up to you because you promised to keep them safe

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:18.990
Instead you turned on your family

00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:24.509
My blood is boiling as I write these last words because they are the last you will ever hear from me

00:48:24.510 --> 00:48:28.379
I can't even think of the right words to describe the betrayal and the hate I feel

00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:33.119
And to be honest, you aren't even worth the time and effort. It takes to put my pen to this paper

00:48:33.849 --> 00:48:37.889
There isn't a day that goes by that. I don't cry for my family. They were my whole world

00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.940
All I do is ask myself. Why why would you do this?

00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:47.039
You don't deserve to be called a man. What kind of person slaughters the people that love them the most?

00:48:47.619 --> 00:48:49.589
Did you really think you would get away with this?

00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:54.359
Did you really think that this was your best option to throw away your family like they were garbage?

00:48:54.970 --> 00:48:59.970
They deserve better and you know it I hope you spend the rest of your life staring at the ceiling every night

00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:02.160
Being haunted by what you've done

00:49:02.619 --> 00:49:07.529
None of us deserve this hearing my mother and father cry themselves to sleep in this hotel room

00:49:08.200 --> 00:49:15.000
Causes me anguish that as we onwards I can't describe how this feels how badly my heart is breaking for my poor parents

00:49:15.460 --> 00:49:20.819
We trusted you you have taken away my family from this earth, but you can never take them from my heart

00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:26.069
You took away my privilege of being an uncle to the most precious little girls I've ever known

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.770
I will never hear the words uncle Frankie again

00:49:29.290 --> 00:49:31.499
But you will never be called dad again either

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:37.739
You'll never be able to put your hands on another woman. Let alone my best friend my beloved sister and your son

00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:40.879
I just can't comprehend how they weren't enough for you

00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:44.959
Shan and Bella and CeCe loved you more than anyone you were their hero

00:49:45.390 --> 00:49:48.230
How could you destroy the people who loved them the most I?

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:52.129
Pray that you never have a moment's peace or a good night's rest in the cage

00:49:52.130 --> 00:49:54.619
You'll spend every day of your life in a cage

00:49:54.619 --> 00:49:57.558
You are privileged to live in because my family isn't evil like you

00:49:58.049 --> 00:50:02.299
We begged the district attorney to spare your life despite because despite everything

00:50:02.519 --> 00:50:05.179
We believe that no one has the right to take the life of another

00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:07.910
even so even someone like you I

00:50:09.029 --> 00:50:10.339
Feel sorry for your family

00:50:10.339 --> 00:50:13.159
I know the pain that they must feel knowing that they can't hug you

00:50:13.619 --> 00:50:17.119
Because that's how my mother father and I feel every time we cry for our family

00:50:18.029 --> 00:50:21.439
Nothing hurts more than watching or hearing my family weep for their loved ones

00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.500
I just wish that I could tell that that you would tell the truth

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:28.219
but I know that that is asking for more than you are capable of I

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:32.299
Stayed up all night writing this statement. I don't sleep because of you

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:34.849
My life will never be the same because of you

00:50:34.849 --> 00:50:40.068
But at least my conscience is clear I get to live free but I can't say the same for you. I

00:50:40.619 --> 00:50:46.159
Haven't slept in two days because I've been anxiously waiting for this moment the moment I get to tell you how I feel

00:50:46.529 --> 00:50:48.529
how this has affected my family and I

00:50:49.019 --> 00:50:51.679
My family and I can finally grieve after today

00:50:52.049 --> 00:50:58.189
If anything we will come out of this stronger today than we were before and we will continue to pray for your family sincerely

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:00.190
Frankie Rousseff

00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:05.009
My name is Sandra psycho Shannon's mother I

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:09.119
Wanted to say thank you for this moment. I

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.300
Wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who has prayed

00:51:12.850 --> 00:51:17.399
For our beloved family once in gifts cards to us from all over the world

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:21.000
I know God will put the evil people where they need to be

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.679
So want to take the time to thank the town of Frederick?

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:31.379
Greeley FBI the DA's office the CBI

00:51:32.050 --> 00:51:34.050
for exceptional work

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:36.420
We thank Nicole

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:37.930
Atkinson

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:40.980
Shannon's neighbor Nathan and his family

00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:45.989
To me. They're our heroes. They really they really are god bless

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:55.590
God makes no mistakes on who he puts in. Your life marriage is about love trust and friendship and unity

00:51:57.250 --> 00:51:59.580
We married for sickness and health to death do us part

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:06.479
Our daughter Shannon loved you with all of her heart your children loved you to the moon and back

00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:09.210
Shanna's family was her world

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:11.820
Shannon put a crown on your head

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.020
but unfortunately

00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:17.159
The day that you took their life God removed that crown

00:52:18.370 --> 00:52:20.910
We loved you like a son we trusted you

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:28.380
Your faithful life trusted you your children adored you and they also trusted you

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:33.120
Your daughter Bella Marie sang a song proudly

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:37.320
And I don't know if you got to see it, but it was daddy. You're my hero. I

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:44.279
Have no idea who gave you the right to take their lives

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:51.540
But I know

00:52:51.670 --> 00:52:56.639
God and his mighty angels were there at that moment to bring them home to paradise

00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:00.300
God gives us free will

00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:08.430
So not knowing did you take the family for your family and for you took your own life I

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:13.890
Want the world to know that our daughter and her children were so loved by us

00:53:14.710 --> 00:53:18.269
There will always be protected by God and his mighty angels. I

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:21.930
Did one death for you because that's not my right

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:26.070
Your life is between you and God

00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.190
Now and I pray that he has mercy for you

00:53:30.070 --> 00:53:32.070
from Shannon's mother

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:35.549

Thank You Jana

Your Honor that's all the witnesses that I had intended on calling and I know that a court addressed this during the procedural

00:53:51.940 --> 00:53:55.800
Posture I'm aware that mr. And mrs. Watts would also like to address the court

00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:57.150
I would certainly invite the court

00:53:57.150 --> 00:54:03.420
If you want at this point to call upon them or we can certainly do it after any evidence that the defense has as well

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:07.470

But if they do not get written out their statements and asked me to finish for them second, that would be fine

00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.930
We thank you for the opportunity and the recognition under the victim Bill of Rights

00:55:17.050 --> 00:55:20.400
we come today as the grandparents and the

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:25.920
Parent of the daughter and children whose life was taken in this case

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.460
We are not here to ask for leniency

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.760
we are not in any way condoning or

00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.750
tolerating

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:38.549
The crime that has occurred and the pain that has been caused

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:41.200
we join

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:47.069
In our daughter-in-law and grandchildren's family and saying this should never have happened

00:55:48.190 --> 00:55:50.579
This is not condone about

00:55:51.550 --> 00:55:54.990
This is something that we will never get over

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.680
We appreciate the consideration

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:05.459
That everyone has paid most especially the families that have lost everyone

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.770
We appreciate that they begged for

00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:12.420
Christopher's life

00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:18.409
We agree and echo what they have said that it is not his place to take anyone's life

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:22.760
Nor would it be our place as a community to take his life?

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:29.930
So we thank you for the opportunity and for every consideration and effort that's been put out

00:56:30.450 --> 00:56:36.649
The prosecution in this case has in fact respected the victim Bill of Rights. They took the time to

00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:43.400
Explain that the information that my clients had at the time that they were interviewed was not correct

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:45.660
They were misinformed

00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:47.610
They were searching for answers

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:52.670
they were not intending to cause any pain to anyone and they appreciate that the

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:58.190
prosecution answered their questions and gave them the time and the respect and the

00:56:58.530 --> 00:57:05.749
Consideration so that they could tell this court and everyone in this community that the interview content was not their message

00:57:06.210 --> 00:57:09.619
That they accept that their son has done this

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:12.710
That they accept that he chose to plead guilty

00:57:13.770 --> 00:57:19.189
That he sought and requested their consent and agreement for a life sentence

00:57:19.890 --> 00:57:21.630
they

00:57:21.630 --> 00:57:26.359
Appreciate that. He has given the opportunity to serve that life sentence. It is his responsibility

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:31.819
it is his sentence and it is not enough to make up for

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:34.550
What has done?

00:57:34.590 --> 00:57:38.150
We understand and we join the family and that we have questions

00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:45.739
We don't know how such a thing could possibly happen or that a man that was responsible for raising his children and protecting his wife

00:57:46.110 --> 00:57:48.030
Would take the steps that he did

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:54.349
and that he would disregard their bodies and the love that he had for them and they had for him and everyone else and

00:57:54.480 --> 00:58:00.740
take the gestures and put this community through the investigation and the discovery and the

00:58:01.170 --> 00:58:06.290
Responsibility of bringing justice, we do not understand that. We do not think it was appropriate

00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:11.329
We cannot begin to think that an explanation will ever justify it

00:58:12.710 --> 00:58:16.000
my clients indicate that they understand that a

00:58:16.849 --> 00:58:21.519
Full opportunity for a confession with all of the responsibility and accountability

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:28.179
Has not occurred when they support the family and the request that that happened if not today

00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:33.369
At an appropriate time in an appropriate manner so that everyone can have peace

00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:40.419
to understand to the best of their ability the details that they need and to have their questions answered and

00:58:40.849 --> 00:58:44.798
By giving this opportunity of a life sentence. We hope that he

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:51.459
Embraced at that moment that had the death penalty been pursued there would not have been an opportunity

00:58:51.980 --> 00:58:56.799
to be accountable and to give a full confession and had the death penalty been sought

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:03.549
Counsel would have fought for his life. The prosecutors would have been engaged in a multiple year battle

00:59:03.980 --> 00:59:05.960
The families would have been torn apart

00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:11.559
This community would have had to subsidize it and endure it and we have so much

00:59:11.809 --> 00:59:14.409
respect and gratefulness that that did not happen

00:59:15.859 --> 00:59:17.750
We would strongly encourage

00:59:17.750 --> 00:59:24.669
Christopher Watts to give that full confession in the tone and in the timing that he thinks is appropriate with the guidance of his counsel

00:59:24.859 --> 00:59:31.869
we feel that it would be appropriate and helpful to ease the pain and the suffering but we also say

00:59:32.299 --> 00:59:36.099
We don't think that there's anything that he can say that will ever

00:59:36.650 --> 00:59:38.420
account for his behavior

00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.420
There's nothing that can be done

00:59:40.609 --> 00:59:44.289
to cure the harm he has caused and he has

00:59:45.410 --> 00:59:49.569
the responsibility to serve his sentence with dignity and

00:59:50.270 --> 00:59:57.189
With regard for everyone and to spend every breath that he has left in an atonement for what he has done

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.520
Cindy watts

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:13.710
My name is Cindy watts, I am the grandmother of two beautiful granddaughters Bella Marie Celeste Katherine watts

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:20.039
I am also the mother of Christopher watts who I will be directing most of my statement to

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:25.170
First I'd like to begin by recognizing the absolute horror of this crime

01:00:25.570 --> 01:00:31.559
And acknowledging the devastating loss except both the Rousset family as well as our family have faced

01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:39.180
Our families have been irreparably broken by the needless deaths of Shannon Bella CC and Miko

01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.720
This is something we will never get over

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:50.129
We will always mourn the loss of our family and in that we are united in our grief. I

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:56.099
Am still struggling to understand how and why this tragedy occurred? I

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:03.360
May never be able to understand and accept it but I pray for a peace and healing for all of us

01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:06.900
now to my son Christopher I

01:01:08.110 --> 01:01:11.279
Have known you since the day you are born into this world

01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:17.789
I've watched you grow from a quiet and sweet curious child

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.819
who Bella reminded me so much of

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:27.389
Joy, a young man who worked hard in sports and later mechanics to achieve her goals

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:33.210
You're a good friend brother father and son you

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:35.470
have a

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:39.720
We have loved you from the beginning and we still love you now

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.500
This might be hard for some to understand

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:52.260
How I can sit here under these circumstances and tell you although we are heartbroken

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.119
Although we can't imagine what could have led us to this day

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:00.030
But we love you

01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:02.280
Maybe you can't believe it either

01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:09.419
As the Lord said in Jeremiah three 31, I have loved you with an everlasting

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.890
love therefore

01:02:11.890 --> 01:02:16.020
I have continued my faithfulness to you and you

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:21.059
as your mother Chris I have always loved you and I still do I

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:26.190
Hate what has happened your father and sister and I are struggling to understand why

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:32.010
But we will remain faithful as your family just as God remains faithful

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:36.030
Because of his unconditional love for love for us

01:02:36.910 --> 01:02:38.910
We love you

01:02:47.930 --> 01:02:50.559
If I could read the mr. Waadt statement

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:57.909
My name is Ronnie watts and I'm the grandfather of Bella Celeste Niko watts

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.640
Honey, I'm the father of Shannon

01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:04.930
I am the father of Christopher watts as well

01:03:05.719 --> 01:03:10.479
And one of the most important things I've done in my life is to raise my children and to watch

01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:12.969
as they started their own families, I

01:03:13.999 --> 01:03:17.649
Spent many years coaching Little League and talking to my son

01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:23.169
Taking him to the races and sharing my love and knowledge of cars with him

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.769
He was just as involved with his girls. I

01:03:27.469 --> 01:03:30.639
Believe he loves his girls. I know he does

01:03:31.460 --> 01:03:35.679
This tragedy has impacted my family in so many ways

01:03:36.319 --> 01:03:38.319
Beyond losing my precious grandchildren

01:03:38.869 --> 01:03:40.869
our beloved daughter-in-law

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:43.690
we are forced to question everything we

01:03:44.239 --> 01:03:49.389
Still don't have all the answers and I hope one day Christopher you can help us

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:52.690
Chris I

01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:56.710
want to talk to you as a father and son you

01:03:58.369 --> 01:04:00.140
Are here today

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.089
accepting responsibility

01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:04.629
but I want to tell you this now I

01:04:05.749 --> 01:04:07.519
Love you

01:04:07.519 --> 01:04:13.929
Nothing will ever change that and I want you to find peace and today is your first step

01:04:15.049 --> 01:04:19.959
the Bible says if we confess our sins God is faithful and just

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.660
And will forgive us

01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:31.299
Chris I forgive you and your sister forgives you and we will never abandon you and we love you

01:04:31.729 --> 01:04:33.729
dad

01:04:34.909 --> 01:04:37.479
So thank you for the opportunity to address the court

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:54.709
Your Honor there are no words to adequately describe the unimaginable tragedy that brings us before this court today

01:04:55.920 --> 01:05:00.020
By my comments. I'm not even going to try to express the horror the pain

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:06.829
Or the suffering that the defendant has caused to these families to this community and to all who were a part of this investigation

01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.980
However, I do want to spend a few minutes

01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:14.030
Sharing with the court the details of the crime has so far

01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:17.929
You've only had an opportunity to review the affidavit and a few facts here and there

01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:21.770
that have been offered to the court in the motions and pleadings that have been filed the

01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:30.889
Questions that have screamed out to anyone who will listen since August 13th of 2018 are why and how

01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:33.980
Why did this have to happen?

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:39.530
How could a seemingly normal husband and father annihilate his entire family for what?

01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:46.760
these are the questions that only one individual in this courtroom or on this planet knows the answers to I

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:50.839
Fully expect we will not receive the answers to these questions today

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:53.990
Normally will we at any point in the future? I?

01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:58.849
Don't expect that. He will ever tell the truth about what truly happened or why

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:03.829
even if he did there is no rational way that any human being

01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:08.359
Could find those answers acceptable responses to such horrific questions

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:11.839
The best we can do is try to piece together some kind of understanding

01:06:12.270 --> 01:06:16.039
From the evidence that is available to us and the evidence tells us this

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:20.870
The defendant coldly and deliberately ended four lives

01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:23.130
Not in a fit of rage

01:06:23.130 --> 01:06:27.109
Not by way of accident but in a calculated and sickening manner

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:33.289
Xi9 was 34 years old. She had married the defendant in November of 2012

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:39.710
Over the weekend leading up to August 13th. She had been at a work conference in Phoenix, Arizona and

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:42.920
returned home in the early morning hours of August 13th

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:49.760
We know that she got home about 1:45 in the morning the doorbell camera on their home shows her arriving back home

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.760
from the airport

01:06:52.890 --> 01:06:57.950
Shortly thereafter at least according to the defendant. They had a what he referred to as an emotional

01:06:58.590 --> 01:07:03.680
Conversation about the state of their marriage and about what their lives would look like going forward

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:08.299
What was said during that emotional conversation only he knows?

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:16.099
What we do know is that shortly after that the defendant strangled her to death with his own hands

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:23.420
We know that he slowly took her life the morning of August 13th

01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:31.010
We know that this was not done in an uncontrolled vengeful manner that he tried to describe to agents from CBI and the FBI

01:07:31.590 --> 01:07:34.430
If that were the case, you would expect to see

01:07:35.370 --> 01:07:39.650
vicious horrible bruising about her neck shoulders and face

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:43.250
You would expect to see the hyoid bone in her neck broken

01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:50.179
You would expect to see some kind of defensive wounds on his body as she struggled and fought for her own life

01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:54.079
None of those are present

01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:57.020
The only injuries that were on Shannon's body

01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:04.730
Were one set of finger or bruising what appeared to be fingernail or finger mark bruising to the right side of her neck

01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:12.980
We know that our experts will tell us that it takes two to four minutes to strangle someone to death manually with their own hands

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:19.100
the horror that she felt is the man that she loved wrapped his hands around her throat and

01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:22.400
Choked the life out of her must have been unimaginable

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.550
Even worse what must Bella age for and

01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:31.460
Celeste age three

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:37.969
Must have experienced her thought is their father the one man on this planet who was supposed to nurture and protect them

01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:40.730
was snuffing out their lives

01:08:42.090 --> 01:08:44.539
They both died from smothering

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:51.680
Let me say that again the man seated to my right smothered his daughters

01:08:54.420 --> 01:09:01.270
Why imagine the horror in Bella's mind as her father took her last last breaths away

01:09:03.860 --> 01:09:07.809
Your honor understand very clearly Bella fought back for her life

01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:16.449
The frenulum the connective tissue between her upper lip and her gum had an inch and a half. Excuse me a centimeter and a half

01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:18.980
laceration

01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.980
She bit her tongue

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:23.320
multiple times before she died

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:28.959
She fought back for her life as her father smothered her

01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:33.550
Celeste had no such injuries

01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:40.660
In fact, she had no external injuries at all. But according to the medical examiner, she was smothered nonetheless

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:50.019
The defendant then methodically and calmly loaded their bodies into his work truck

01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:53.800
Not in a hasty hasty or disorganized way

01:09:54.770 --> 01:09:56.950
He was seen from the neighbors doorbell camera

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:00.040
Backing his truck into the driveway

01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:06.580
Going back and forth into the house and back out to the truck three different times

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.520
one time for each of their bodies

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.709
He then drove them away from their family home one final time

01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:19.119
Intent on hiding any evidence of the crimes that he had just committed

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:27.340
In one final sign of callousness for his wife his daughters and their unborn son and their remains

01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:31.120
He drove them to a location that he thought no one would ever find them

01:10:31.730 --> 01:10:34.750
To one of the oil tank batteries with which he was so familiar

01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:37.390
He knew this was safe

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:39.580
He had texted a co-worker the night before

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.690
Saying I'll head out to that site. I'll take care of it

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.060
He had carefully insured that he would be alone in the middle of the plains

01:10:49.490 --> 01:10:55.030
To secrete away the remains of his family in a place that he hoped. They would never be found

01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:59.080
in one final measure of disrespect for the family

01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:04.840
he once had he ensured that they would not be together even in death or he so he thought

01:11:05.870 --> 01:11:07.870
He disposed of them in different locations

01:11:09.190 --> 01:11:13.169
He buried Shanon and Nico in a shallow grave away from the oil tanks

01:11:14.679 --> 01:11:18.359
Bella and Celeste were thrown away in the oil tanks at this facility

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:22.710
Different tanks. So these little girls wouldn't be together in death

01:11:25.510 --> 01:11:27.510
Imagine this Your Honor

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:34.110
This defendant took those little girls and put them through a hatch at the top of an oil tank

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:36.750
eight inches in diameter

01:11:39.699 --> 01:11:44.069
Bella had scratches on her left buttocks from being shoved through this hole a

01:11:45.219 --> 01:11:48.118
Tuft of blond hair was found on the edge of one of these hatches

01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:54.119
The defendant told investigators that Bella's tank seemed emptier than CeCe's

01:11:54.730 --> 01:11:56.349
because of the sound

01:11:56.349 --> 01:11:58.349
That the splashes made

01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:00.360
These were his daughters

01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:08.969
Significantly when his co-workers arrived at the tank battery later that morning to a person they all described him as acting completely

01:12:09.130 --> 01:12:11.130
Normally, it was a normal workday

01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:19.799
Even while his daughter sank in the oil and water not far away from him and then his efforts at deception truly began

01:12:21.070 --> 01:12:26.250
We've all seen the emotionless interviews that the defendant gives to the local media

01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:33.210
Asking for help in locating his family. We watched as he claimed that the house was empty without them and

01:12:33.849 --> 01:12:38.038
That he hoped that they were somewhere safe and he just wanted them to come home

01:12:38.889 --> 01:12:42.929
He told investigators that they were at home sleeping when he left for work that morning and that

01:12:43.539 --> 01:12:48.209
Shannon had told him that he was she was taking the girls to a friend's house for the day

01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:54.329
What is striking about this case your honor beyond the horrors that I've already described to you

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:58.440
Is the number of collateral victims that he created by his actions?

01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:05.940
While he stood in front of TV cameras asking for the safe return of his family scores of law enforcement officers neighbors

01:13:06.579 --> 01:13:08.579
friends and family scoured the area

01:13:10.449 --> 01:13:17.939
Fretted for their safe return they texted him begging for any information and sending him their best wishes all the while

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.940
He hid what he had done

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:22.720
The list of indirect victims does not end there

01:13:23.150 --> 01:13:28.660
think of the firefighters and the Colorado State Patrol hazmat experts who had to Don protective suits and

01:13:29.330 --> 01:13:33.850
Who were called upon to pull Bella and Celeste out of those oil tanks?

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.479
Or the coroner employees who had to conduct these autopsies

01:13:38.330 --> 01:13:43.390
Or the victim assistance who franked frantically attempted to ease the suffering of those affected

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.600
All of this your honor for what?

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:49.360
Why?

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:51.550
Why did this have to happen

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:56.620
His motive was simple your honor he had a desire for a fresh start

01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:04.899
To begin a relationship with a new love that overpowered all decency and feelings for his wife his daughters and unborn son

01:14:06.050 --> 01:14:12.730
While Shanon texted the defendant over and over again in the days and weeks leading up to her death attempting to save her marriage

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:16.839
the defendant secreted pictures of his girlfriend into his phone and

01:14:17.660 --> 01:14:21.910
Searched and texted excuse me texted her at all hours of the night

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:30.070
While Shannon sent the defendant self hoped self-help and relationship counseling books one of which ironically enough was thrown in the garbage

01:14:31.670 --> 01:14:37.089
He was searching the internet for secluded vacation spots to take his new love in researching jewelry

01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:41.410
And while Shannon took the girls to visit family in, North Carolina

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:45.700
The defendant went to car museums and the sand dunes with his new girlfriend

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:52.929
The stark contrast between the subjects of their internet and text content is absolutely stunning

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:57.970
Even the morning after he killed them and disposed of their bodies

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:00.640
He made several phone calls

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.920
One was to the school

01:15:02.989 --> 01:15:04.989
Where the girls were supposed to start?

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:10.779
Telling the school that he would that the girls would not be coming to school any more that they were being unenrolled

01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:17.140
Presumably to give him some more time before long for law enforcement notification about them going missing

01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:21.160
He contacted a realtor

01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:27.249
To start discussing the selling of his house and he texted with his girlfriend about their future

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:36.860
None of this answers the questions of why however if he was this happy and wanted a new start get a divorce

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:42.050
You don't annihilate your family and throw them away like garbage

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:50.150
Why did Niko Celeste Bella and Shannon have to lose their lives in order for him to get what he wanted?

01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:55.369
Your Honor justice demands the maximum sentence under the agreement reached by the parties

01:15:55.770 --> 01:16:01.760
as you will recall the agreement calls for life sentences as to Shannon, Bella and Celeste and

01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:04.490
all of those to run consecutively to one another

01:16:05.190 --> 01:16:12.590
it also calls for the count of unlawful termination of a pregnancy as to Nikko to run consecutively to counts 1 2 &amp; 3 I

01:16:13.830 --> 01:16:17.420
Would suggest that the extreme aggravation present in the defendants conduct?

01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:21.110
And is that the efforts that I have described?

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:26.030
Mandate that the sentences for count seven eight and nine the tampering with the deceased human body

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:31.159
Each be the maximum of 12 years and that those sentences run consecutively to one another

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:34.340
It is very clear that each of these acts

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.420
Excuse me

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:40.849
that these were not the subject of one act but each oil tank that he walked up with his daughter's bodies and

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:44.209
The hole that he dug for his wife and unborn son

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:46.820
mandate and mandatory consecutive sentence

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:51.470
It's been alluded to this morning

01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:57.229
But the defendant was certainly eligible for the death penalty in this case under the existing law in the state of Colorado

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:02.749
as you heard Shannon's family strongly opposed my office seeking the death penalty and

01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:06.410
Being bound to the groom of the criminal justice system for the next several decades

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:11.330
That's in large part as you've heard why we have reached the agreement that we have

01:17:12.690 --> 01:17:17.780
Four lives were lost at the hands of the defendant on August 13th for reasons that we will never fully

01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.880
Understand nor will we know in?

01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:28.249
The end the rusik family was much more merciful towards him than he was towards his wife his daughters and his unborn son

01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:31.789
prison for the remainder of his life is

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.189
Exactly where he belongs for murdering his entire family. Thank you

01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.620
One days while the cost for restitution I am your honor, please

01:17:57.220 --> 01:17:58.860
Good morning Your Honor mr

01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:04.920
Watts has asked us to share this morning that he is devastated by all of this and although he

01:18:05.290 --> 01:18:12.120
Understands that words are hollow at this point. He is sincerely sorry for all of this. Thank you

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:20.939
Showing mercy on mr. Watts is understood. I

01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.540
Respect that decision to

01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:28.620
Request that the district attorney not seek the death penalty in this case

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:31.530
And so the court is going to accept

01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:34.860
This plea bargain under the circumstances

01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:38.800
Words that come to mind when I hear

01:18:40.190 --> 01:18:45.610
The evidence in this case are a senseless crime and

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:50.019
Viciousness of the crime and

01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:59.200
equally aggravating in this court's determination is the despicable act of

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.010
disposing of the bodies in the manner in which they were

01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:06.010
Done in this case

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:11.199
I've been a judicial officer now for starting my seventeenth year and

01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:14.110
I

01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:17.559
Could objectively say that this is

01:19:20.030 --> 01:19:22.030
Perhaps the most

01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:30.039
Inhumane and vicious crime that I have handled out of the thousands of cases that I have seen and

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.770
Nothing less than a maximum sentence

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:45.210
Would be appropriate and anything less than the maximum incentives would depreciate the seriousness of this offense

01:19:48.190 --> 01:19:51.480
So the court is going to sentence mr. Watts as follows

01:19:52.420 --> 01:19:54.690
With regard to count number one

01:19:55.510 --> 01:19:58.800
Murder in the first degree as it relates to shin and Watts

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:06.510
The court has got a sentence. You served to a life sentence in a Colorado Department of Corrections

01:20:07.540 --> 01:20:09.540
followed

01:20:10.150 --> 01:20:13.049
With no possibility of parole

01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:18.180
And that is going to run consecutively to

01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:21.449
All but counts three and four

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:26.639
With regard to count two as it relates to murder in the first degree

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:34.289
With Bella the court is going to sentence you to life in the Colorado Department of Corrections

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:37.229
with no possibility of parole

01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:44.459
With regard to count number three the court is going to sentence you as it relates to

01:20:45.100 --> 01:20:51.900
Celeste it's a life in the Colorado Department of Corrections with no possibility of parole

01:20:53.140 --> 01:21:00.360
With regard to counts four and five relating to Bella and Celeste as a different

01:21:00.730 --> 01:21:05.040
Theory of first-degree murder the court is going to sentence you to life

01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:08.519
in the Colorado Department of Corrections and

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:14.660
Legally those sentences must run concurrently as different theory of first-degree murder

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:18.830
Recognizing

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:27.260
The unlawful termination of pregnancy for the unborn child that's has been named eco

01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:35.269
The court absolutely believes that the maximum sentence of 48 years would be appropriate to run

01:21:35.670 --> 01:21:37.670
consecutive to the other charges

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:44.510
with an additional mandatory parole period of three years SF forth by statute

01:21:46.560 --> 01:21:49.999
With regard to count number seven as a relates

01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:57.769
To tampering with a deceased body as well as counts eight and nine each a class three felony

01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:00.380
the court is going to impose a

01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:08.540
Maximum sentence of twelve years each for those temps to run consecutively to the other accounts

01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:12.289
The court is going to one of that

01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:19.490
Statutory fees be paid in court cost the courts anagram of the prosecution 91 days

01:22:20.550 --> 01:22:23.659
to file a notice of restitution

01:22:24.810 --> 01:22:26.100
and

01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:28.130
That will be the sentence of the court

01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:30.949
We will

01:22:30.949 --> 01:22:33.189
Shortly be in recess I would

01:22:34.159 --> 01:22:36.429
respectfully ask the parties that

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:44.589
You remain in your seat. There is a plan by the deputies on allowing people to exit the courtroom

01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:46.590
so please remain seated until

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.530
you are

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:52.270
authorized to leave the courtroom based on the direction of the

01:22:53.239 --> 01:22:54.500
deputies

01:22:54.500 --> 01:23:02.439
Deputies I would respectfully ask that take this defendant into custody and have serve the rest of his life in the Department of Corrections

01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:05.290
We are

01:23:12.639 --> 01:23:17.719
Please right. I

01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:27.110
Don't know many of you

01:23:32.130 --> 01:23:34.130
Should see
