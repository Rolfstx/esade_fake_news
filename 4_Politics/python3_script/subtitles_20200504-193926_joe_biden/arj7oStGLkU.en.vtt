00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:14.015
 When I was in university .. 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.913
 My major was government work 

00:00:16.937 --> 00:00:19.399
 Which means I have to write a lot of papers, 

00:00:19.423 --> 00:00:21.471
 Now when any ordinary student writes a paper 

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:23.868
 His schedule looks almost like this .. 

00:00:23.892 --> 00:00:25.043
 as you see.. 

00:00:25.067 --> 00:00:26.724
 (Laughter) 

00:00:26.748 --> 00:00:28.575
 Work is slow at first, 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.567
 But you accomplish enough during the first week 

00:00:30.591 --> 00:00:32.422
 Because it makes you see heavy days coming 

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:34.603
 She looks productive and cute. 

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:35.829
 (Laughter) 

00:00:35.853 --> 00:00:38.124
 And I hope to do this the same way, 

00:00:38.148 --> 00:00:39.342
 This is how the plan will be .. 

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:41.856
 I will start writing the schedule to get started, 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.374
 Then it is time to write .. 

00:00:44.398 --> 00:00:46.339
 And I end up like this! 

00:00:46.363 --> 00:00:48.733
 (Laughter) 

00:00:48.757 --> 00:00:50.900
 And this happens on every paper I write .. 

00:00:51.638 --> 00:00:55.520
 Until I was asked to write a 90-page graduation thesis, 

00:00:55.544 --> 00:00:57.831
 A paper we're supposed to be working on all year round! 

00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:01.474
 For a sheet like this, my regular work schedule was not an option. 

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:02.899
 Because the project was so huge 

00:01:02.923 --> 00:01:04.076
 I started planning for the project, 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.305
 And I decided that the schedule should look something like this. 

00:01:07.781 --> 00:01:09.233
 This is how the year will pass .. 

00:01:09.257 --> 00:01:11.224
 I will start with the easy and light work, 

00:01:11.248 --> 00:01:13.566
 Then I will increase the effort a little in the middle of the year, 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.216
 At the end of the year, I will work to the best of my ability. 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.679
 It will be very easy as a stair climb, step by step. 

00:01:17.703 --> 00:01:19.765
 How difficult can stair climbing be? 

00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:21.552
 Not a big deal, right? 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.900
 But the funniest thing happened to me .. 

00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:26.235
 In the first months, 

00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:27.958
 It came and went quickly, 

00:01:27.982 --> 00:01:29.567
 I could not do anything. 

00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:31.440
 So I decided to change my plan a little .. 

00:01:31.464 --> 00:01:32.631
 (Laughter) 

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:33.814
 Then ... 

00:01:33.838 --> 00:01:35.720
 (Laughter) 

00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:38.528
 But in fact, the middle of the year went by quickly, 

00:01:38.552 --> 00:01:40.734
 I didn't write a word. 

00:01:40.758 --> 00:01:42.593
 It is now here! 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.076
 Shrinking two months for one month .. 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.725
 Then to two weeks .. 

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.058
 And one day I woke up, 

00:01:49.724 --> 00:01:52.343
 And only three days left for delivery !! 

00:01:53.502 --> 00:01:55.433
 And I haven't written any word yet, 

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:57.516
 So I did the only thing I could do, 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.147
 I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours, 

00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:02.447
 She continued for two whole days without sleep. 

00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:05.040
 And people should not stay up two days without sleep, 

00:02:06.373 --> 00:02:08.366
 I ran to the university, 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.876
 In slow motion I turned the paper over 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.956
 Exact date! 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.004
 I thought I had accomplished everything. 

00:02:14.028 --> 00:02:15.587
 A week later, I got in touch, 

00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:17.097
 It was a call from the university. 

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:19.396
 They asked: "Are you Tim Urban?" 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.888
 She answered, "Yes." 

00:02:20.912 --> 00:02:23.252
 They said: "We must discuss with you about your thesis." 

00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:24.531
 I said, "Okay." 

00:02:25.468 --> 00:02:26.690
 They said .. 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.126
 "It is the best thesis we have ever seen!" 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.855
 (Laughter) 

00:02:32.014 --> 00:02:34.704
 (clap) 

00:02:36.945 --> 00:02:38.247
 In fact, this did not happen. 

00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:40.409
 (Laughter) 

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:43.056
 It was a very bad thesis. 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.354
 (Laughter) 

00:02:45.378 --> 00:02:49.478
 I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you thought: 

00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.407
 "This guy is amazing!" 

00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:52.779
 (Laughter) 

00:02:52.803 --> 00:02:54.470
 No, no, it was very bad 

00:02:55.343 --> 00:02:58.751
 Anyway, today I am a writer and blogger on the Internet .. 

00:02:58.775 --> 00:03:00.518
 I write on a blog called "Wait But Why?" 

00:03:00.542 --> 00:03:04.278
 Two years ago, I decided to write about procrastination and postponement 

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:07.586
 My actions have always baffled non-bad guys around me and why I postpone my business 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.298
 So I wanted to explain to those and the world what is going on in me 

00:03:11.322 --> 00:03:13.429
 The heads of those who shun and postpone their actions, 

00:03:13.453 --> 00:03:14.893
 And why are we like this? 

00:03:14.917 --> 00:03:16.073
 I had a theory that said 

00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:18.952
 The minds of the missionaries are really 

00:03:18.976 --> 00:03:20.933
 Different from other people 

00:03:21.698 --> 00:03:23.889
 To test this, I found a lab that allowed me 

00:03:23.913 --> 00:03:26.345
 Using an MRI machine to photograph my brain 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:29.024
 Another man's brain does not postpone his work 

00:03:29.048 --> 00:03:30.483
 To compare them, 

00:03:30.507 --> 00:03:32.708
 And I brought the pictures with me for viewing today by yourself, 

00:03:32.732 --> 00:03:36.269
 Now I want you to take a closer look to see if there is a difference. 

00:03:36.293 --> 00:03:38.607
 I know that not all of you are experts, 

00:03:38.631 --> 00:03:40.894
 And it's not clear, but just look, okay? 

00:03:40.918 --> 00:03:43.046
 So here is the image of the brain that is not postponed, 

00:03:43.835 --> 00:03:46.109
 (Laughter) 

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:47.284
 And now .. 

00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:49.639
 Here is a picture of my brain. 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.006
 (Laughter) 

00:03:55.713 --> 00:03:57.277
 There is a difference . 

00:03:57.904 --> 00:04:00.292
 Both minds contain (rational decision-maker) 

00:04:00.316 --> 00:04:01.968
 But the procrastinator's mind 

00:04:01.992 --> 00:04:04.978
 Also contains (instant fun monkey) 

00:04:05.002 --> 00:04:07.304
 Now, what does this mean for the poor? 

00:04:07.328 --> 00:04:09.769
 It means that everything is okay until this happens .. 

00:04:09.793 --> 00:04:12.415
 Man: "This is the perfect time to get the job done." Monkey: "No!" 

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:15.372
 So (logical decision maker) will do 

00:04:15.396 --> 00:04:17.292
 With something useful and productive. 

00:04:17.316 --> 00:04:19.266
 But the monkey does not like the plan, 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.798
 The monkey takes the wheel and says: 

00:04:20.822 --> 00:04:23.703
 Why not read the full Wikipedia page 

00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:25.863
 About the scandal of Nancy and Tonya (actresses) because I am 

00:04:25.887 --> 00:04:28.018
 I just remembered that this happened! 

00:04:28.042 --> 00:04:29.058
 (Laughter) 

00:04:29.082 --> 00:04:30.240
 Then .. 

00:04:30.264 --> 00:04:31.527
 (Laughter) 

00:04:31.551 --> 00:04:33.589
 Then we will go to the fridge 

00:04:33.613 --> 00:04:36.479
 Let's see if anything changes 10 minutes ago. 

00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:39.141
 Next, we will enter the YouTube vortex that begins 

00:04:39.165 --> 00:04:42.415
 With videos about Richard Feynman (scientist) talking about magnets 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.155
 And it ends after a very long time with watching interviews 

00:04:45.179 --> 00:04:47.059
 With Justin Bieber's mother (singer) .. 

00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:49.271
 (Laughter) 

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:51.058
 Monkey: "All this will take time, 

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:54.584
 There is no room to do anything today. 

00:04:54.608 --> 00:04:55.771
 "Sorry!" 

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:56.960
 (Laughter) 

00:04:58.325 --> 00:05:01.694
 Now, what's going on here! 

00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:06.172
 This monkey does not look like the person you want 

00:05:06.196 --> 00:05:07.450
 Leader behind the rudder. 

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.419
 He lives totally at the present moment. 

00:05:09.443 --> 00:05:12.271
 He has no memory of the past and no knowledge of the future. 

00:05:12.295 --> 00:05:13.992
 He only cares about two things: 

00:05:14.016 --> 00:05:15.699
 "Easy and fun." 

00:05:16.338 --> 00:05:19.430
 In the animal world, this works perfectly. 

00:05:19.454 --> 00:05:20.662
 If you are a dog, 

00:05:20.686 --> 00:05:24.257
 And you did nothing but easy and fun, 

00:05:24.281 --> 00:05:25.446
 You are successful by all accounts! 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.381
 (Laughter) 

00:05:27.405 --> 00:05:28.691
 And for the monkeys, 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.063
 Humans are just another type of animal. 

00:05:32.087 --> 00:05:36.593
 They eat, sleep and multiply. 

00:05:36.617 --> 00:05:38.903
 Which would be natural in primitive times. 

00:05:38.927 --> 00:05:41.777
 However, if you do not notice, we are not in those times 

00:05:41.801 --> 00:05:45.934
 We are in a developed and civilized time, and the monkey does not know what this means. 

00:05:45.958 --> 00:05:48.239
 That is why it is in our head 

00:05:48.263 --> 00:05:50.628
 (Logical decision maker), 

00:05:50.652 --> 00:05:53.679
 That gives us abilities that no other animal can do, 

00:05:53.703 --> 00:05:55.624
 We can imagine the future, 

00:05:55.648 --> 00:05:57.400
 We can see the full picture 

00:05:57.424 --> 00:05:58.774
 And we can make long term plans .. 

00:05:58.798 --> 00:06:01.281
 The decision maker takes all of this into account, 

00:06:02.138 --> 00:06:03.829
 And he wants us to do just what it looks like 

00:06:03.853 --> 00:06:06.801
 Right and logical to do now .. 

00:06:06.825 --> 00:06:08.214
 Sometimes it seems to do something 

00:06:08.238 --> 00:06:10.267
 Logical and fun at the same time, 

00:06:10.291 --> 00:06:12.442
 Like attending a dinner or going to sleep, 

00:06:12.466 --> 00:06:14.294
 Or enjoy in free time. 

00:06:14.318 --> 00:06:15.768
 That is why there is an overlap between logical and interesting. 

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:17.536
 Sometimes they get along, 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.382
 At other times, it seems more logical 

00:06:20.406 --> 00:06:24.008
 To work on something difficult and not fun 

00:06:24.032 --> 00:06:25.572
 For the greater benefit. 

00:06:25.596 --> 00:06:27.485
 And here is the conflict. 

00:06:28.017 --> 00:06:29.332
 For the procrastinator, 

00:06:29.356 --> 00:06:31.865
 This conflict always ends in the same way, 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.609
 Which makes him spend most of his time in the orange region, 

00:06:35.633 --> 00:06:39.960
 A fun, easy and completely separate area from the Logic Circle. 

00:06:39.984 --> 00:06:42.263
 I call it (the dark games park). 

00:06:42.287 --> 00:06:43.911
 (Laughter) 

00:06:43.935 --> 00:06:47.063
 Now, (Dark Game Park) is a place 

00:06:47.087 --> 00:06:50.279
 You all know it, good shoppers. 

00:06:50.892 --> 00:06:52.696
 A place where leisure activities occur 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.030
 In no time, really free time. 

00:06:56.418 --> 00:06:58.308
 The fun you have in the (dark games park) 

00:06:58.332 --> 00:07:00.815
 It is not real fun, because it is totally undeserved 

00:07:00.839 --> 00:07:04.054
 And the atmosphere around you is full of guilt, unhappiness, anxiety and self-loathing 

00:07:04.078 --> 00:07:06.196
 All the feelings of beautiful hairdressers .. 

00:07:06.703 --> 00:07:10.179
 The question when the monkey is behind the wheel is: 

00:07:10.203 --> 00:07:13.796
 How does the massif transport himself to the blue zone, 

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.101
 An area where less fun and easier things happen but much more important .. 

00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:22.162
 Well, it turns out that whoever postpones his business has a guardian king, 

00:07:22.186 --> 00:07:25.394
 Someone always watches and looks at him 

00:07:25.418 --> 00:07:26.848
 In the darkest and darkest moments .. 

00:07:26.872 --> 00:07:28.967
 A person called (The Monster of Dread) 

00:07:28.991 --> 00:07:32.069
 (Laughter) 

00:07:34.386 --> 00:07:39.246
 Now (the monster of dread) is sleeping most of the time .. 

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:43.172
 But he wakes up suddenly, when any deadline is too close 

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:45.241
 Or there is a risk of embarrassment in front of people 

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:47.776
 Or losing a job, or any frightening consequence .. 

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:51.972
 And the most important thing is that it is the only thing that scares the monkey. 

00:07:51.996 --> 00:07:56.574
 Now, this monster has come into contact with my life recently, 

00:07:56.598 --> 00:07:59.844
 Because TED conference officials contacted me six months ago 

00:07:59.868 --> 00:08:01.889
 And let me talk about it. 

00:08:01.913 --> 00:08:04.341
 (Laughter) 

00:08:07.058 --> 00:08:08.965
 Of course I said: Yes, my dream has always been that 

00:08:08.989 --> 00:08:12.794
 I speak at TED in the past 

00:08:12.818 --> 00:08:16.790
 (Laughter) 

00:08:16.814 --> 00:08:20.511
 (clap) 

00:08:24.203 --> 00:08:26.172
 Amidst all this enthusiasm, 

00:08:26.196 --> 00:08:29.497
 The decision maker was thinking about something else. 

00:08:29.521 --> 00:08:32.069
 He used to say: "Are we clear about what we just agreed to? 

00:08:32.093 --> 00:08:35.342
 Do we know what will happen one day in the future? 

00:08:35.366 --> 00:08:37.633
 We should sit down and prepare the speech right now. 

00:08:37.657 --> 00:08:40.922
 The monkey said: I completely agree with you, but what do you think about opening Google Maps? 

00:08:40.946 --> 00:08:44.106
 We zoom in to the bottom of India and explore it 

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:47.751
 For two and a half hours until we reach the top of India, 

00:08:47.775 --> 00:08:49.753
 In order to educate ourselves about this country. " 

00:08:49.777 --> 00:08:54.212
 (Laughter) 

00:08:55.149 --> 00:08:56.634
 This is what we did that day. 

00:08:56.658 --> 00:08:59.328
 (Laughter) 

00:09:00.604 --> 00:09:04.500
 It turned 6 months to 4, then to 2, then to one month .. 

00:09:04.524 --> 00:09:07.619
 TED decided to announce the speakers at the conference, 

00:09:07.643 --> 00:09:10.255
 When I opened the site, I found a picture of my face 

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:11.635
 Staring at me. 

00:09:11.659 --> 00:09:13.259
 And guess who woke up? 

00:09:13.283 --> 00:09:16.398
 (Laughter) 

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.880
 (The dread monster) is losing his mind .. 

00:09:19.904 --> 00:09:22.650
 In a few seconds, the system turned chaos. 

00:09:22.674 --> 00:09:25.120
 (Laughter) 

00:09:27.511 --> 00:09:30.612
 And the monkey rose - remember, the monkey is afraid of the dread monster - 

00:09:30.636 --> 00:09:31.794
 He climbed up to the tree! 

00:09:31.818 --> 00:09:32.969
 And finally, 

00:09:32.993 --> 00:09:35.589
 (Logical Decision Maker) was able to receive the helm 

00:09:35.613 --> 00:09:37.331
 And I was able to start working on the lecture 

00:09:37.355 --> 00:09:39.643
 Now (the dread monster) represents 

00:09:39.667 --> 00:09:43.148
 All sorts of crazy behavior among the messengers, 

00:09:43.172 --> 00:09:45.506
 Like how I could spend two weeks 

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:49.374
 All sorts of actions on writing one sentence in my thesis, 

00:09:49.398 --> 00:09:52.169
 Then miraculously, the words constantly come in 

00:09:52.193 --> 00:09:55.289
 Two days to write 8 pages! 

00:09:56.385 --> 00:09:59.367
 This whole case with the three characters, 

00:09:59.391 --> 00:10:01.411
 This is the supermarket system. 

00:10:02.096 --> 00:10:05.521
 Not beautiful, but in the end, it works. 

00:10:05.545 --> 00:10:09.607
 And this is what I decided to write on the blog two years ago 

00:10:09.631 --> 00:10:12.602
 And when I wrote, I was amazed by the responses, 

00:10:12.626 --> 00:10:14.779
 Thousands of messages I received, 

00:10:14.803 --> 00:10:17.580
 Of all kinds of people, from all over the world, 

00:10:17.604 --> 00:10:19.342
 They do all kinds of jobs. 

00:10:19.366 --> 00:10:22.332
 They included nurses, bankers, painters, and engineers 

00:10:22.356 --> 00:10:24.678
 And many many doctoral students, 

00:10:24.702 --> 00:10:26.703
 (Laughter) 

00:10:26.727 --> 00:10:29.015
 And all of them said they write saying the same thing: 

00:10:29.039 --> 00:10:30.991
 "I have the same problem." 

00:10:31.015 --> 00:10:34.844
 What surprised me was the contrast between the lightness of speech 

00:10:34.868 --> 00:10:36.963
 That you wrote and the weight of these letters, 

00:10:36.987 --> 00:10:40.070
 These people were writing very frustrated 

00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:42.856
 What did procrastination do to them in their lives, 

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.280
 What did this monkey do to them? 

00:10:46.902 --> 00:10:49.868
 And when I thought about it, I said to myself: 

00:10:49.892 --> 00:10:53.004
 If procrastination was working, what would happen? 

00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:55.514
 Why are these people so frustrated? 

00:10:55.538 --> 00:10:58.836
 It turns out that there are two types of procrastination, 

00:10:59.987 --> 00:11:02.821
 Everything I talked about today, all the examples, 

00:11:02.845 --> 00:11:03.996
 They all have a deadline. 

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.318
 And when there are deadlines, 

00:11:05.342 --> 00:11:08.267
 , The delay effect is contained and pressed in the short term 

00:11:08.291 --> 00:11:10.204
 Because (the monster of panic) interferes .. 

00:11:10.228 --> 00:11:12.282
 But there is another kind of delay. 

00:11:12.306 --> 00:11:14.793
 Type occurs in circumstances without a deadline. 

00:11:14.817 --> 00:11:17.507
 For example, if you want to start a freelance business, 

00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:19.944
 Something in art, or a pioneering business. 

00:11:19.968 --> 00:11:23.493
 These works have no deadlines at first, because nothing happened at all. 

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:25.761
 While if you go out and start working hard 

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:27.411
 To gain some activity to do other work. 

00:11:27.435 --> 00:11:30.513
 There is also a lot of important work outside of your business 

00:11:30.537 --> 00:11:32.142
 It does not include deadlines. 

00:11:32.166 --> 00:11:35.431
 Such as visiting your family or sports and taking care of your health, 

00:11:35.455 --> 00:11:36.859
 Working to develop your relationships, 

00:11:36.883 --> 00:11:39.564
 Or break bad relationships .. 

00:11:39.588 --> 00:11:44.736
 Now, if the master’s way was the only way to end these difficult things 

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:46.645
 It is by (dread monster), there is a problem, 

00:11:46.669 --> 00:11:49.469
 Because in all these important works that do not contain deadlines 

00:11:49.493 --> 00:11:51.121
 The monster will not appear. 

00:11:51.145 --> 00:11:52.597
 He has no appointment to wake up to. 

00:11:52.621 --> 00:11:55.319
 So, the effect of the delay will not be contained 

00:11:55.343 --> 00:11:57.083
 Thus, these actions will continue and extend forever. 

00:11:57.953 --> 00:12:00.693
 This is the type of long-term procrastination 

00:12:00.717 --> 00:12:03.798
 He who does not see nor speaks much about him 

00:12:03.822 --> 00:12:06.723
 Like the first type: fun, short term and with deadlines. 

00:12:06.747 --> 00:12:09.850
 Usually, people of the second type suffer calmly and privately. 

00:12:10.816 --> 00:12:11.970
 And this procrastination may be a source 

00:12:11.994 --> 00:12:15.729
 Great for long-term sadness and remorse. 

00:12:16.576 --> 00:12:19.448
 And I thought: That's why these people are writing to me, 

00:12:19.472 --> 00:12:21.974
 Therefore, they are in such bad condition. 

00:12:21.998 --> 00:12:24.742
 Not because they are aiming for a specific project, 

00:12:24.766 --> 00:12:28.187
 But because of that long-term delay that made them look spectators, 

00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:30.250
 Sometimes, for their lives themselves .. 

00:12:30.594 --> 00:12:33.576
 Their frustration does not come from the failure to fulfill their dreams, 

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.689
 Rather, they could not pursue it from the ground up. 

00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:40.896
 As I read the letters, a kind of inspiration came to me: 

00:12:42.182 --> 00:12:45.582
 I don’t think that someone is postponing their actions, 

00:12:45.979 --> 00:12:49.215
 That's right, I think you are all miserable. 

00:12:49.898 --> 00:12:51.812
 Of course, you may not be messy .. 

00:12:51.836 --> 00:12:53.186
 Like each other. 

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:54.739
 (Laughter) 

00:12:54.763 --> 00:12:58.079
 Some of you may be on good terms with your appointments and stick to them. 

00:12:58.103 --> 00:13:00.627
 But remember: The Secret Monkey's Trick is 

00:13:00.651 --> 00:13:02.491
 When there is no deadline. 

00:13:03.249 --> 00:13:05.281
 Now, I want to show you one last thing .. 

00:13:05.305 --> 00:13:07.678
 I call this: (life schedule) 

00:13:08.352 --> 00:13:12.631
 Each square represents a week in the life of 90 years, 

00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:14.934
 There doesn't seem to be much of it .. 

00:13:14.958 --> 00:13:17.932
 Especially since we used a lot of them before 

00:13:18.607 --> 00:13:23.739
 I think we all need to take a deep look at this schedule. 

00:13:24.977 --> 00:13:27.990
 And we must really think about what we postpone, 

00:13:28.014 --> 00:13:31.379
 Because each of us has something to delay in his life 

00:13:32.782 --> 00:13:35.812
 We must remain wary of the instant fun monkey, 

00:13:37.455 --> 00:13:39.947
 This is a job for all of us. 

00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:42.969
 And because there aren't that many boxes in the table, 

00:13:42.993 --> 00:13:45.283
 This is a job that you should start from today. 

00:13:45.307 --> 00:13:48.307
 Mmm, maybe not today but ... 

00:13:48.331 --> 00:13:49.972
 (Laughter) 

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:51.146
 As you know , 

00:13:51.576 --> 00:13:52.726
 Sometime soon ... 

00:13:53.393 --> 00:13:54.602
 Thank you . 

00:13:55.876 --> 00:14:00.224
 clap
