00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.462
 In my childhood, 

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:17.485
 My family had no dogs. 

00:00:18.354 --> 00:00:21.320
 The rest of the children in the area owned dogs. 

00:00:21.813 --> 00:00:23.915
 So I asked my father one day, 

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:26.336
 Why don't we get a dog? 

00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:28.927
 He said: 

00:00:29.832 --> 00:00:33.346
 "Because they used dogs against us," 

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:38.306
 He meant that the Nazis used dogs 

00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:41.644
 To attack and intimidate my family, 

00:00:41.664 --> 00:00:43.461
 My dad and grandmother, 

00:00:43.481 --> 00:00:48.386
 During the three years we spent in Nazi concentration camps. 

00:00:50.523 --> 00:00:53.935
 We also had no German car - 

00:00:53.965 --> 00:00:57.545
 Neither "Volkswagen" nor "Mercedes" or "BMW". 

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:01.030
 My father used to call her "Nazi Cars". 

00:01:02.924 --> 00:01:04.323
 Last summer, 

00:01:04.343 --> 00:01:08.912
 I was standing at "Hertz", a car rental center in Berlin, 

00:01:09.413 --> 00:01:11.477
 When the employee said to me: 

00:01:12.527 --> 00:01:15.603
 "Very sorry, Mr. Rosen, 

00:01:15.623 --> 00:01:18.343
 We don't own the car you booked. " 

00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:20.538
 Then I was disappointed. 

00:01:20.863 --> 00:01:23.449
 I follow the employee: "But don't worry, Mr. Rosen, 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.939
 I have very good news. 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.494
 I have a car with a sun roof, big and cushioned by the skin 

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.713
 It is a luxury car. 

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:40.724
 Let me review the Mercedes-Benz available to you. " 

00:01:41.924 --> 00:01:43.344
 And I thought .. 

00:01:43.864 --> 00:01:46.475
 "It looks like it will be an exciting trip 

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:49.444
 To where I will go with this car. " 

00:01:50.022 --> 00:01:55.183
 I will tell you where I got that car at the end of my words. 

00:01:55.455 --> 00:01:59.362
 First, let me tell you why I went to Germany 

00:01:59.382 --> 00:02:01.051
 And what I learned there. 

00:02:02.263 --> 00:02:07.793
 I went to Germany last summer, with 20 other people from the United States, 

00:02:07.823 --> 00:02:12.451
 A very distinct group; From a county governor and prosecutor 

00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:14.806
 And several prominent academics, 

00:02:14.836 --> 00:02:18.218
 Conservative activists, progressive activists, 

00:02:18.248 --> 00:02:20.634
 And the head of a non-profit organization, 

00:02:20.654 --> 00:02:22.294
 And several reporters. 

00:02:22.324 --> 00:02:25.575
 And the TV news program "60 Minutes", 

00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:28.538
 A convicted fighter from Detroit. 

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:30.802
 As a big and happy family. 

00:02:30.832 --> 00:02:32.189
 (Laughter) 

00:02:33.324 --> 00:02:38.535
 Germany has a very low crime rate 

00:02:38.565 --> 00:02:41.189
 Prison rates as well, 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.770
 That is, a very low percentage of their citizens occupy prisons. 

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.475
 and the opposite, 

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:51.135
 Murder rates in the United States 

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:56.385
 Nine times its counterpart in Germany, 

00:02:56.415 --> 00:03:02.823
 The prison rate was ten times that of Germany. 

00:03:03.193 --> 00:03:08.964
 In the United States, we spend more than $ 50 billion annually on prisons, 

00:03:08.994 --> 00:03:12.670
 Of these, over 9 billion annually are in California alone. 

00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:16.444
 In fact, California is one of sixteen states 

00:03:16.464 --> 00:03:21.064
 There are more prisoners than university students. 

00:03:21.795 --> 00:03:26.297
 About $ 50,000 a year to house one person in prison. 

00:03:26.674 --> 00:03:29.096
 Which of you in the year of graduation, 

00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:32.156
 He knows the cost of going to university, 

00:03:32.186 --> 00:03:33.597
 Total costs, 

00:03:33.627 --> 00:03:36.240
 It could be something of $ 50,000 a year 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.598
 Or even more. 

00:03:40.714 --> 00:03:43.397
 I really know that everyone here will graduate, 

00:03:44.167 --> 00:03:48.204
 But 6 out of every 100 American men 

00:03:48.224 --> 00:03:51.416
 He graduated from high school, not university 

00:03:51.446 --> 00:03:54.706
 He will spend a year in prison before he reaches thirty. 

00:03:55.306 --> 00:03:57.035
 For those who did not graduate from high school, 

00:03:57.055 --> 00:04:02.065
 28 out of 100 will spend a year in prison before reaching the age of thirty. 

00:04:02.364 --> 00:04:05.756
 For the African-American man who did not graduate from high school 

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:09.506
 68 percent .. 68 out of 100, 

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:13.539
 He will spend a year in prison before he reaches thirty. 

00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:19.004
 However, the situation was not as it is now in the United States. 

00:04:20.196 --> 00:04:25.725
 That's our prison rates from 1925 until about 1975, 

00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:29.176
 The “prison rate” is an elegant word for reference 

00:04:29.212 --> 00:04:34.645
 The percentage of those who are in custody or imprisonment? 

00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:40.195
 And you will see that from 1952 to 1975, that fifty year period, 

00:04:40.225 --> 00:04:43.159
 The average is about 100 per hundred thousand. 

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:45.447
 It is a very stable rate. 

00:04:45.477 --> 00:04:48.345
 Something rises at 1940, 

00:04:48.365 --> 00:04:49.694
 Then it goes down a little bit, 

00:04:49.714 --> 00:04:51.876
 But it's a fairly constant rate. 

00:04:52.195 --> 00:04:57.390
 But something dramatic happens in the mid-seventies until today, 

00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:02.176
 And you'll see that from the mid-1970s until now, 

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:06.515
 The prison rate jumps to where it is today, 

00:05:06.545 --> 00:05:10.362
 At about 700 per hundred thousand 

00:05:10.382 --> 00:05:15.184
 At seven times, the percentage increase by 700%. 

00:05:15.766 --> 00:05:19.358
 Now, to put all this into context, 

00:05:19.388 --> 00:05:22.102
 Ask: What about other countries? 

00:05:22.132 --> 00:05:23.556
 OK, 

00:05:23.576 --> 00:05:26.609
 When comparing ourselves to other democracies, 

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.172
 With the democracies of the first nations of the world, 

00:05:29.202 --> 00:05:32.647
 Our prison rate is beyond normal, 

00:05:32.667 --> 00:05:34.136
 as you see. 

00:05:34.156 --> 00:05:36.177
 We are the highest in stages. 

00:05:36.207 --> 00:05:40.536
 All other European countries, as well as Australia and Canada 

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:42.917
 Much lower than our rates. 

00:05:42.947 --> 00:05:44.979
 And as you can see, Germany - 

00:05:45.009 --> 00:05:46.896
 Maybe around ten - 

00:05:46.916 --> 00:05:49.866
 Slightly less than nine times the rate of imprisonment in our country. 

00:05:51.837 --> 00:05:56.084
 So, a research study was prepared by the National Academy of Sciences, 

00:05:56.104 --> 00:05:57.466
 In 2014, 

00:05:57.496 --> 00:06:02.596
 It was concluded that the growth in prison rates in our country 

00:06:02.626 --> 00:06:04.456
 Over the past forty years 

00:06:04.486 --> 00:06:08.446
 Historically unprecedented, and unique worldwide. 

00:06:09.446 --> 00:06:11.435
 Historically unprecedented; 

00:06:11.925 --> 00:06:13.295
 Because.. 

00:06:13.685 --> 00:06:15.573
 See where we have been for fifty years! 

00:06:15.803 --> 00:06:17.859
 So it is unprecedented for us - 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:20.816
 This is not the approach we have taken in this country - 

00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:23.876
 But it is also universally unique. 

00:06:23.906 --> 00:06:26.386
 When comparing ourselves to other countries, 

00:06:26.416 --> 00:06:31.438
 We imprison much more people than them. 

00:06:31.878 --> 00:06:33.137
 right Now.. 

00:06:35.365 --> 00:06:36.716
 sound.. 

00:06:37.476 --> 00:06:40.947
 It is with the prison rate in our country 

00:06:40.977 --> 00:06:43.527
 Who rose, rose, and rose .. 

00:06:43.557 --> 00:06:47.210
 The crime rate decreased, decreased, decreased .. 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.556
 Now, some will say: 

00:06:48.586 --> 00:06:53.266
 "Oh ...! Well, the reason for the continuing drop in crime 

00:06:53.306 --> 00:06:57.845
 Attributed to the continuous rise of our prison rates. 

00:06:57.875 --> 00:06:59.987
 See ...!? The reason is clear. 

00:07:00.027 --> 00:07:03.466
 The reason for the decrease in crime is that we have become strict 

00:07:03.486 --> 00:07:05.610
 And we sent a lot of people to prison, 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.886
 And prisons made us harsher, 

00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:09.827
 And we made the sentence longer, 

00:07:09.857 --> 00:07:11.618
 We did not release people under conditions, 

00:07:11.648 --> 00:07:12.936
 This gave people a lesson. 

00:07:12.956 --> 00:07:15.166
 So, crime rates have decreased. " 

00:07:16.026 --> 00:07:20.417
 This is a simple and straightforward argument. 

00:07:20.447 --> 00:07:24.860
 Marvel at the strict Western mentality. 

00:07:25.667 --> 00:07:29.478
 And remember! When you try to convince people of something - 

00:07:29.508 --> 00:07:33.198
 A simple argument that people can understand - 

00:07:33.228 --> 00:07:36.105
 You go half way to persuade them. 

00:07:36.125 --> 00:07:37.967
 If people can understand something, 

00:07:37.997 --> 00:07:41.437
 They will tend to be more convinced than if they do not understand it. 

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:43.194
 Now, the problem with this argument, 

00:07:43.214 --> 00:07:47.817
 And it's one very small problem associated with this idea, 

00:07:47.847 --> 00:07:49.590
 It is completely incorrect. 

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:57.157
 We came to this; Due to the crime 

00:07:57.192 --> 00:08:02.866
 It is not just about specific city or country trends. 

00:08:02.896 --> 00:08:06.577
 But he crossed the whole western world and crossed the developed world, 

00:08:06.607 --> 00:08:08.806
 Europe, Australia, Canada .. 

00:08:08.826 --> 00:08:13.076
 Crime seems to have changed in parallel since the Middle Ages, 

00:08:13.106 --> 00:08:18.065
 We know this from all discovered records. 

00:08:18.085 --> 00:08:19.278
 It seems .. 

00:08:19.302 --> 00:08:24.926
 That from about the middle of the nineteenth century until the fifties and sixties, 

00:08:24.956 --> 00:08:28.509
 Crime has died in cities all over the world. 

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:33.099
 From that time, from the 1960s until the late 1990s, the crime increased: 

00:08:33.129 --> 00:08:37.967
 Real estate tenure and violent crime rose across the western world. 

00:08:37.987 --> 00:08:41.708
 But from the 1990s until today, 

00:08:41.738 --> 00:08:46.776
 Crime decreased across Europe, Australia, Canada, and the United States. 

00:08:46.796 --> 00:08:49.454
 I fell in all of those places. 

00:08:49.827 --> 00:08:51.210
 right Now, 

00:08:52.217 --> 00:08:54.905
 Let's take a look at our northern neighbor, Canada. 

00:08:55.356 --> 00:08:57.556
 An optional reason for Canada, for example - 

00:08:57.586 --> 00:09:00.036
 Although I can use any other country in Europe - 

00:09:00.066 --> 00:09:02.077
 Is that we share a common border with Canada, 

00:09:02.977 --> 00:09:05.776
 And we think Canadians are almost like us, 

00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:07.337
 But a little nicer - 

00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:09.917
 I think this is the stereotype of Canadians. 

00:09:09.947 --> 00:09:11.652
 So, if you look here, 

00:09:11.682 --> 00:09:16.218
 This is a comparison of theft rates in the United States and Canada, 

00:09:16.238 --> 00:09:19.988
 You will notice that the rates are somewhat higher 

00:09:20.018 --> 00:09:22.727
 In the early nineties in both countries 

00:09:22.747 --> 00:09:24.227
 Then it starts to fall 

00:09:24.257 --> 00:09:28.312
 To rates not seen before in either country until the 1960s 

00:09:28.342 --> 00:09:31.387
 Thefts have decreased in both countries. 

00:09:31.787 --> 00:09:33.248
 And also murders. 

00:09:33.278 --> 00:09:34.528
 But our rates are higher. 

00:09:34.558 --> 00:09:36.758
 We have more robberies, more murders; 

00:09:36.788 --> 00:09:38.318
 Rates in Canada are at a lower curve. 

00:09:38.348 --> 00:09:40.340
 But you will see the same pattern. 

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.519
 Again, in the early 1990s, 

00:09:42.539 --> 00:09:45.228
 There is an increase in homicide rates - 

00:09:45.248 --> 00:09:47.929
 Killing any object is a type of murder. 

00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:50.169
 Then starting in the nineties, and in both countries, 

00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:54.940
 It drops again to rates not seen since the 1950s and 1960s. 

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:56.232
 So, in another word, 

00:09:56.252 --> 00:09:58.124
 In the United States and Canada, 

00:09:58.154 --> 00:10:01.703
 The crime was in the sixties, seventies, eighties and early nineties 

00:10:01.733 --> 00:10:03.021
 Rise in both countries, 

00:10:03.041 --> 00:10:04.151
 The crime has risen, 

00:10:04.181 --> 00:10:06.831
 Then it started to decline in both countries. 

00:10:06.861 --> 00:10:08.912
 But why has crime decreased? 

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:10.691
 Well, you might say in the United States, 

00:10:10.711 --> 00:10:14.672
 "It decreased because, as you can see, we became harsher and put more people in prison." 

00:10:14.702 --> 00:10:18.233
 But what did Canada do to lower its rates? 

00:10:19.143 --> 00:10:20.421
 This is what we did. 

00:10:20.441 --> 00:10:22.443
 Our prison rates are higher. 

00:10:22.473 --> 00:10:26.692
 We dealt with pushing more people to prison and for longer periods. 

00:10:27.991 --> 00:10:30.212
 Our rates of incarceration of persons are much higher. 

00:10:30.242 --> 00:10:31.493
 What did Canada do? 

00:10:31.523 --> 00:10:32.538
 nothing. 

00:10:32.558 --> 00:10:35.861
 The same as they have done for the past hundred years. 

00:10:35.891 --> 00:10:39.480
 And what's interesting about Canada is that their prison rates, 

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:42.200
 About 100 people among every hundred thousand - 

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.436
 wait a moment! Where have we heard this number before? 

00:10:44.466 --> 00:10:50.353
 Those were our averages between 1925 and 1975, 

00:10:50.373 --> 00:10:54.476
 Therefore, it appears that what affects crime rates is attributable to 

00:10:54.503 --> 00:10:58.806
 More than just the number of people we put in prison. 

00:10:58.836 --> 00:11:01.475
 Two years ago, New York University Law School, 

00:11:01.495 --> 00:11:05.265
 She came up with a comprehensive and documented study, 

00:11:05.295 --> 00:11:09.474
 They found the crime rate correlation with three things. 

00:11:09.494 --> 00:11:10.475
 number one: 

00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:14.996
 Increasing prison rates and sending more people to prison for longer periods, 

00:11:15.026 --> 00:11:17.553
 It has little impact on crime rates. 

00:11:17.573 --> 00:11:19.167
 number two: 

00:11:19.197 --> 00:11:20.537
 Improving the work of the police, 

00:11:20.567 --> 00:11:24.175
 Better use of data to identify forensic sources, 

00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:27.537
 She played a significant role in reducing crime rates. 

00:11:27.567 --> 00:11:28.667
 And number three: 

00:11:28.697 --> 00:11:31.057
 Certain socio-economic factors 

00:11:31.087 --> 00:11:33.335
 She played a big role in reducing crime rates, 

00:11:33.375 --> 00:11:34.975
 These factors are: 

00:11:35.015 --> 00:11:36.675
 Longer life expectancy for the population, 

00:11:36.705 --> 00:11:38.356
 A lower average number of family members, 

00:11:38.386 --> 00:11:41.394
 Low consumption of alcohol. 

00:11:41.708 --> 00:11:42.780
 So, 

00:11:43.304 --> 00:11:49.654
 Let's move away from politics and statistics. 

00:11:49.654 --> 00:11:52.676
 To describe what you saw in Germany. 

00:11:54.323 --> 00:11:57.713
 Germany's prisons are completely different from US prisons. 

00:11:58.193 --> 00:12:01.087
 First, it is much smaller, 

00:12:01.117 --> 00:12:04.576
 The largest prison in Germany is the Tegel prison, in Berlin. 

00:12:04.596 --> 00:12:06.796
 It includes 1200 guests. 

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:09.270
 Most German prisons are much smaller, 

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.150
 It contains between 300 to 500 guests. 

00:12:13.473 --> 00:12:16.721
 On the contrary, American prisons are very large; 

00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:22.334
 The largest of which is New York's Rikers Island prison, with more than 14,000 inmates. 

00:12:22.844 --> 00:12:27.165
 The prison in Angola, in Louisiana, has more than 5,000 inmates. 

00:12:27.195 --> 00:12:31.349
 And in California, if your car takes about an hour and a half to the north to Saint Quentin, 

00:12:31.369 --> 00:12:32.948
 3,500 guests. 

00:12:32.968 --> 00:12:37.056
 And if you drive an hour and a half south to the Soledad government prison, 

00:12:37.076 --> 00:12:38.677
 3,600 guests. 

00:12:38.707 --> 00:12:40.889
 More and more .. 

00:12:42.434 --> 00:12:47.221
 Second, German prisoners wear their personal clothes. 

00:12:48.137 --> 00:12:50.392
 Just as you are dressed! 

00:12:52.057 --> 00:12:54.105
 And cook their own meals, 

00:12:54.118 --> 00:12:58.114
 And they have enormous freedom of movement during the prison. 

00:12:58.617 --> 00:13:00.108
 On the contrary, 

00:13:00.128 --> 00:13:04.128
 American prisoners, we all know they are wearing a uniform, 

00:13:04.158 --> 00:13:07.337
 They are locked inside their cells most of the day, 

00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:11.647
 They eat their meals in huge canteens. 

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.974
 German prisoners have their own cells, 

00:13:18.037 --> 00:13:20.025
 Terms of the phone, 

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.844
 And their personal bathroom, too. 

00:13:24.129 --> 00:13:27.009
 Let's take a look at Heidering prison. 

00:13:27.049 --> 00:13:29.648
 It is the most recent newly built prison in Germany. 

00:13:29.668 --> 00:13:31.937
 It was built in 2013. 

00:13:31.967 --> 00:13:34.430
 You see, there's a barbed wire on the outside. 

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:36.020
 It appears as a detainee. 

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.278
 This is one of the cellars inside it. 

00:13:39.298 --> 00:13:42.275
 This is only a place where everyone walks in prison 

00:13:42.295 --> 00:13:43.998
 To move from one place to another. 

00:13:44.028 --> 00:13:45.910
 As you can see, natural sunlight enters it. 

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.609
 And it has a touch of beauty in design and style. 

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:51.948
 The pictures I show are exactly what prison looks like 

00:13:51.968 --> 00:13:53.268
 When we lost it in the summer 

00:13:53.298 --> 00:13:56.598
 So if you think: "Oh my God! It's so clean, 

00:13:56.628 --> 00:13:59.460
 It looks cleaner than this upper school, " 

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.677
 (Laughter) 

00:14:00.697 --> 00:14:03.749
 This is exactly how it looked when we saw it. 

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:07.838
 Again, high and natural lighting, 

00:14:07.868 --> 00:14:09.814
 A lot of light enters it. 

00:14:12.838 --> 00:14:17.348
 These are the rooms in which individuals live. 

00:14:17.378 --> 00:14:21.368
 There is something like a balcony on each floor, 

00:14:21.398 --> 00:14:25.876
 Several balconies that prisoners can go to inhale some fresh air. 

00:14:25.896 --> 00:14:28.404
 The only difference, yes, is the presence of bars 

00:14:28.434 --> 00:14:32.542
 So that no one tries to jump or escape. 

00:14:32.562 --> 00:14:34.038
 But it's totally fun, 

00:14:34.058 --> 00:14:35.689
 It has a lot of green grass, 

00:14:35.689 --> 00:14:38.138
 Frankly it seems 

00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:41.748
 Also a small campus 

00:14:41.778 --> 00:14:44.580
 More than a detainee. 

00:14:46.519 --> 00:14:48.270
 This is a hallway. 

00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:51.087
 The doors on both sides are the location of the cells. 

00:14:51.117 --> 00:14:55.248
 And I'll take you into a dungeon here. 

00:14:56.439 --> 00:15:00.419
 This is what a typical dungeon looks like. 

00:15:00.449 --> 00:15:02.018
 It is not great; 

00:15:02.038 --> 00:15:04.299
 About 100 square feet; 

00:15:04.329 --> 00:15:07.679
 They told us its square meter system, 

00:15:07.709 --> 00:15:09.731
 That the Americans don't know, 

00:15:09.761 --> 00:15:11.651
 But it's about 100 square feet. 

00:15:11.681 --> 00:15:12.934
 And you will see 

00:15:13.798 --> 00:15:15.088
 There is a little - 

00:15:15.668 --> 00:15:18.089
 A sleeping mattress will be placed on that side, 

00:15:18.119 --> 00:15:19.116
 Small mattress. 

00:15:19.136 --> 00:15:20.928
 There is an office and a phone, 

00:15:20.958 --> 00:15:22.942
 And a window until sunlight runs out. 

00:15:22.972 --> 00:15:24.179
 There is also space, 

00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:27.330
 A part has a bathroom and a washbasin. 

00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.659
 Last summer, President Obama visited a federal prison. 

00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:36.338
 He went to the Federal Reserve "El-Reno" in Oklahoma, 

00:15:36.358 --> 00:15:40.967
 He saw prison cells there, and they are about this big. 

00:15:40.997 --> 00:15:45.722
 The difference is that with those cells, two or three guests are supposed to be seated 

00:15:45.752 --> 00:15:48.166
 Whereas in Germany, only one. 

00:15:48.186 --> 00:15:51.409
 Violence in prisons in Germany is much lower 

00:15:51.439 --> 00:15:53.169
 From American prisons, 

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:58.307
 This is partly because everyone lives in their own cell. 

00:15:58.327 --> 00:16:01.030
 Now - some of you will go to university next year - 

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:02.817
 The size of this dungeon 

00:16:02.837 --> 00:16:06.457
 It is the same size as the university dorm room I have lived in 

00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:08.328
 When I was at the University of California. 

00:16:08.358 --> 00:16:12.550
 Maybe the room was a little bit bigger, 

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:14.460
 But two of us were staying there. 

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.859
 But there is a big difference between two students at the university, 

00:16:17.879 --> 00:16:21.310
 One is very organized and the other is messy, 

00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:25.740
 Between a murderer and a rapist, they share a cell this size, right ?! 

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.968
 Manage this! 

00:16:26.988 --> 00:16:28.078
 So, 

00:16:28.718 --> 00:16:29.868
 right Now, 

00:16:31.178 --> 00:16:35.129
 There are places designated for dining on each floor. 

00:16:35.149 --> 00:16:36.932
 And there is a kitchenette here, 

00:16:36.962 --> 00:16:38.927
 We asked the German prison staff: 

00:16:38.957 --> 00:16:40.534
 "These kitchens, 

00:16:40.909 --> 00:16:42.329
 Does she have knives? 

00:16:42.359 --> 00:16:44.859
 Do they have bowls and fries? 

00:16:44.889 --> 00:16:47.729
 Are there dangerous and deadly weapons 

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:49.340
 According to the American perspective? " 

00:16:49.370 --> 00:16:51.908
 And the German officer said: 

00:16:51.928 --> 00:16:55.001
 "Absolutely, I mean this ... everything they cook in." 

00:16:55.480 --> 00:17:00.227
 A completely different view of what a guest should have. 

00:17:00.247 --> 00:17:04.408
 The German vision is trying to get people to live in prison 

00:17:04.438 --> 00:17:06.889
 In the same way that they will live outside it 

00:17:06.919 --> 00:17:09.789
 They will need to cook their own meals 

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:11.824
 So let's get them to do it here. 

00:17:12.372 --> 00:17:14.501
 And that's a picture of another scene. 

00:17:14.831 --> 00:17:16.125
 right Now, 

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.780
 Interesting information about German prisons! 

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.279
 every year, 

00:17:24.039 --> 00:17:28.701
 If the inmate gets psychological treatment 

00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:31.220
 And he goes to the lessons he is supposed to attend, 

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.390
 And practicing vocational training, 

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:35.949
 He does all the things that are supposed to be done in prison 

00:17:35.969 --> 00:17:40.800
 He is allowed to leave prison for several hours, or even on a full night, 

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.367
 Without regard to the crime he committed. 

00:17:43.671 --> 00:17:49.379
 And every year, there are hundreds of thousands of prison exits, 

00:17:49.399 --> 00:17:51.210
 What we call here is "exit permission." 

00:17:51.659 --> 00:17:55.629
 And we ask, among every hundreds of thousands of departures, 

00:17:55.659 --> 00:17:58.060
 "How many times does a guest not return? 

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.750
 How many times do they commit a crime while abroad? 

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:05.329
 And the answer: between all those departures every year, 

00:18:05.349 --> 00:18:11.538
 0.3% of the prisoners do not return or commit a crime while they are abroad. 

00:18:11.568 --> 00:18:13.925
 Three in a thousand! 

00:18:14.711 --> 00:18:17.949
 There is no such thing in the United States. 

00:18:17.969 --> 00:18:20.814
 There are four types of prisons in Germany 

00:18:21.854 --> 00:18:26.809
 They do not call it "light guard", "medium", and "extreme". 

00:18:26.829 --> 00:18:30.110
 They believe that naming an institution “maximum security” 

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.320
 Will lead to violence between prisoners each other, and between them and prison staff, 

00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:38.327
 Because they are going to the utmost guard, everyone must be rude. 

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:39.970
 So they have institutions 

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.409
 Where prisoners serve sentences of five years or more, 

00:18:44.429 --> 00:18:48.620
 And institutions for those who spend five years or less. 

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:50.947
 And institutions for events - 

00:18:50.967 --> 00:18:54.468
 So, if you committed a crime when you were eighteen or younger, 

00:18:54.498 --> 00:18:56.749
 Whoever goes to a juvenile institution, 

00:18:56.779 --> 00:18:59.499
 He will spend his entire sentence there. 

00:18:59.529 --> 00:19:02.469
 So most people are in juvenile institutions 

00:19:02.499 --> 00:19:05.205
 In the early twenties. 

00:19:05.225 --> 00:19:09.179
 The Germans want to separate the younger convicts 

00:19:09.209 --> 00:19:11.948
 About the older, very dangerous 

00:19:11.968 --> 00:19:16.858
 In order for younger convicts not to become more serious criminals. 

00:19:16.888 --> 00:19:20.489
 And number four, they have something called "open prisons." 

00:19:20.519 --> 00:19:22.289
 The open prison is where you go 

00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:26.400
 If you have six months or less at the end of your sentence, 

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:31.198
 In these institutions, you are encouraged to leave the prison during the day 

00:19:31.218 --> 00:19:33.484
 To search for a job or housing, 

00:19:33.504 --> 00:19:36.183
 And you just have to come back at night. 

00:19:36.679 --> 00:19:39.158
 People working in German prisons 

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:42.377
 Very different from those working in American prisons. 

00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:45.975
 It is very difficult to get a job as a reformist employee in Germany. 

00:19:45.995 --> 00:19:50.021
 Less than 10% of the applicants are accepted. 

00:19:50.041 --> 00:19:54.320
 It's as hard as admission to the University of California, Berkeley, or something. 

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.529
 To have a job like that. 

00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:59.719
 Rehabilitation takes two years of training. 

00:19:59.749 --> 00:20:05.348
 Most of their training is in social counseling and rehabilitation. 

00:20:05.728 --> 00:20:10.120
 Some of them may be in physical control; As a kind of technique. 

00:20:10.150 --> 00:20:14.230
 German prison institutions, as I reviewed Heidering prison 

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.289
 Nice places to work out. 

00:20:16.309 --> 00:20:19.938
 They are clean, and the staff eat the same food as prisoners, 

00:20:19.958 --> 00:20:24.118
 The atmosphere in prisons is largely calm. 

00:20:24.148 --> 00:20:27.253
 It is free from anger and gossip. 

00:20:29.168 --> 00:20:31.752
 The question is, why? 

00:20:32.662 --> 00:20:35.270
 The first article in the German constitution states: 

00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.568
 Human dignity is inviolable. 

00:20:37.588 --> 00:20:41.931
 Protecting and respecting it is the duty of all state authorities. " 

00:20:41.961 --> 00:20:45.229
 The most important thing of all, number one 

00:20:45.249 --> 00:20:47.260
 In the German constitution, 

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.115
 Adopted by the German Supreme Court, 

00:20:50.135 --> 00:20:52.760
 Every cell was given a cell, 

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:54.729
 No solitary confinement, 

00:20:54.749 --> 00:20:56.379
 No death penalty, 

00:20:56.419 --> 00:20:59.629
 All persons are eligible for police release. 

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:05.668
 Certainly, the German constitution did not come out of nowhere. 

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:08.651
 I wanted to show a picture of "Chaka Senghor". 

00:21:08.681 --> 00:21:11.933
 Convicted of murder from Detroit who came with us on this trip. 

00:21:11.943 --> 00:21:15.779
 He was released, and is doing very well. 

00:21:15.799 --> 00:21:19.009
 He spent seven and a half years in solitary confinement 

00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:20.899
 In "Michigan" prison. 

00:21:21.849 --> 00:21:26.079
 German employees think that this is as cruel and almost as torture 

00:21:26.109 --> 00:21:29.350
 They were amazed that he had not completely lost his mind. 

00:21:32.010 --> 00:21:34.309
 Now, I am talking to you 

00:21:35.069 --> 00:21:37.099
 After I reviewed the German constitution 

00:21:37.129 --> 00:21:40.139
 That constitution was written in 1949 

00:21:40.169 --> 00:21:44.230
 During the period that Germany was occupied by the United States, Britain, and France 

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:45.890
 After the Second World War. 

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.799
 Written in "Holocaust" 

00:21:48.829 --> 00:21:50.910
 After what the government of Germany did, 

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:53.060
 So, it is not surprising 

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:57.669
 "Respect for human dignity" was number one. 

00:21:58.011 --> 00:22:01.520
 After I finished my week long trip there, 

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.019
 I installed Mercedes-Benz, 

00:22:04.539 --> 00:22:06.802
 And I started driving towards Bergen Belsen. 

00:22:07.332 --> 00:22:11.550
 The car started talking to me in German and giving me instructions. 

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.840
 I do not speak German, 

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.671
 I was not comfortable receiving instructions in German. 

00:22:16.701 --> 00:22:19.818
 Especially since I was going to Bergen Belsen. 

00:22:19.848 --> 00:22:23.090
 I arrived there after about three hours. 

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:27.179
 My father and grandmother were in Bergen Belsen 

00:22:27.199 --> 00:22:32.350
 From January 1945 until the fifteenth of April 1945. 

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:35.190
 This was the third camp where they were arrested. 

00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:38.608
 They entered two former camps in Poland. 

00:22:38.628 --> 00:22:41.300
 By the time Bergen Belsen arrived in 1945 

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.381
 There were 60,000 people and 10,000 dead bodies - 

00:22:45.821 --> 00:22:47.349
 Dead people - 

00:22:48.259 --> 00:22:51.321
 In an area of ​​less than 0.2 square miles. 

00:22:51.351 --> 00:22:55.625
 Less than half the size of this campus. 

00:22:55.651 --> 00:23:00.368
 So, they didn't need people who were aiming to kill people. 

00:23:00.388 --> 00:23:04.285
 Thousands of diseases such as typhoid and fever have killed thousands of them. 

00:23:04.305 --> 00:23:08.641
 Even after Britain liberated the camp in April 1945, 

00:23:08.671 --> 00:23:11.569
 10,000 people died in the following month. 

00:23:11.599 --> 00:23:12.842
 In March 1945, 

00:23:12.872 --> 00:23:17.369
 At the same time that my dad and grandmother were there, 

00:23:17.399 --> 00:23:20.670
 Annie Frank and her sister Margot, you may have heard about them, 

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.140
 They died in March 1945. 

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.125
 I got there to camp. 

00:23:25.494 --> 00:23:27.891
 There are some pictures of what the camp looked like. 

00:23:27.921 --> 00:23:29.940
 The British completely burned it 

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.681
 To get rid of the diseases that were there. 

00:23:32.711 --> 00:23:36.884
 There were some memorials that were inaugurated there. 

00:23:37.263 --> 00:23:39.830
 I met Dr. Brend Horsman. 

00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.891
 He is the chief archive of Bergen Belsen, 

00:23:41.921 --> 00:23:44.520
 I had contacted him before I came. 

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.960
 He is almost my age 

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:48.665
 Not a Jew .. He lived near the camp. 

00:23:49.052 --> 00:23:52.162
 And I had sent him information about my family. 

00:23:52.192 --> 00:23:56.171
 I spent about half the day with him, and the other half I was walking, 

00:23:56.201 --> 00:23:58.691
 He was able to tell me the records 

00:23:58.721 --> 00:24:01.402
 Kept by the English army and the Jewish committee 

00:24:01.432 --> 00:24:03.700
 For those who survived. 

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:09.139
 The name of the Jewish Records Committee was in Hebrew, 

00:24:09.159 --> 00:24:14.149
 Which often translates to "Holocaust survivors" 

00:24:14.179 --> 00:24:15.679
 Or something. 

00:24:15.709 --> 00:24:17.711
 But the Hebrew word is more severe. 

00:24:17.741 --> 00:24:19.820
 It means "counted remains". 

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.161
 And in the recordings 

00:24:21.191 --> 00:24:25.918
 I saw the original name of my father and grandmother, 

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:27.300
 Memory and heritage! 

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:32.380
 I walked around the camp for about four hours. 

00:24:35.710 --> 00:24:39.878
 Such heights are found throughout the camp. 

00:24:39.908 --> 00:24:45.330
 Tens of thousands of people were buried beneath it. 

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:49.667
 I did not go to Germany to forget or forgive, 

00:24:50.109 --> 00:24:51.523
 I did not, 

00:24:51.941 --> 00:24:53.464
 But I went to learn. 

00:24:54.179 --> 00:24:58.751
 How did a country do all these atrocities 

00:24:58.791 --> 00:25:01.591
 To rebuild itself so quickly 

00:25:01.621 --> 00:25:06.956
 To become one of the most enlightened countries on crime and punishment? 

00:25:08.422 --> 00:25:11.152
 If Dostoyevsky was right when he said: 

00:25:11.182 --> 00:25:17.760
 "A society's degree of civilization can be calculated by entering its prisons." 

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:21.054
 How much do we prepare? 

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.711
 I learned from my visit to prisons 

00:25:27.751 --> 00:25:31.692
 And speak to repair personnel, and convicted criminals 

00:25:31.722 --> 00:25:38.041
 And walking through a quiet spacious field of mass graves 

00:25:39.662 --> 00:25:42.860
 The world may be disappointing 

00:25:44.171 --> 00:25:46.152
 But it can be fixed 

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:51.975
 Because we are all created with human dignity. 

00:25:52.940 --> 00:25:54.242
 Thank you 

00:25:54.272 --> 00:25:56.030
 (clap)
