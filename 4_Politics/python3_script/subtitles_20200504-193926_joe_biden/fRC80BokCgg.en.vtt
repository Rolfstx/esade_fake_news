00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
and so it's kind of through a process of
 

00:10:09.279 --> 00:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
and so it's kind of through a process of

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:11.830 align:start position:0%
elimination that we'd take a theory if

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:13.750 align:start position:0%
we could disprove it then we knew we
 

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.390 align:start position:0%
we could disprove it then we knew we
could<00:10:13.900><c> set</c><00:10:14.110><c> it</c><00:10:14.230><c> aside</c><00:10:14.320><c> and</c><00:10:14.560><c> move</c><00:10:14.770><c> on</c><00:10:15.040><c> to</c><00:10:15.279><c> the</c>

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
could set it aside and move on to the
 

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.329 align:start position:0%
could set it aside and move on to the
next<00:10:15.520><c> theory</c><00:10:15.970><c> got</c><00:10:16.720><c> it</c><00:10:16.870><c> great</c><00:10:17.800><c> do</c><00:10:17.980><c> you</c><00:10:18.070><c> mind</c><00:10:18.250><c> if</c>

00:10:18.329 --> 00:10:18.339 align:start position:0%
next theory got it great do you mind if
 

00:10:18.339 --> 00:10:19.829 align:start position:0%
next theory got it great do you mind if

they got all the characters up and you
 

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
they got all the characters up and you

kind of trying to figure out how you got
 

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:34.790 align:start position:0%
kind of trying to figure out how you got
to<00:10:33.580><c> the</c><00:10:33.640><c> bottom</c><00:10:33.880><c> of</c><00:10:33.940><c> who</c><00:10:34.060><c> killed</c><00:10:34.240><c> oh</c><00:10:34.420><c> yeah</c>

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of who killed oh yeah
 

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of who killed oh yeah
let's<00:10:35.800><c> go</c><00:10:35.980><c> to</c><00:10:36.040><c> the</c><00:10:36.130><c> other</c><00:10:36.279><c> oh</c><00:10:36.400><c> yeah</c>

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.150 align:start position:0%
let's go to the other oh yeah
 

00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:39.030 align:start position:0%
let's go to the other oh yeah
so<00:10:37.720><c> Greg</c><00:10:37.960><c> I</c><00:10:38.140><c> want</c><00:10:38.320><c> to</c><00:10:38.410><c> take</c><00:10:38.529><c> a</c><00:10:38.560><c> different</c><00:10:38.950><c> angle</c>

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
so Greg I want to take a different angle
 

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.950 align:start position:0%
so Greg I want to take a different angle
with<00:10:39.340><c> this</c><00:10:39.490><c> because</c><00:10:39.700><c> I</c><00:10:39.850><c> think</c><00:10:39.970><c> this</c><00:10:40.180><c> gives</c><00:10:40.600><c> the</c>

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
with this because I think this gives the
 

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
with this because I think this gives the
audience<00:10:41.110><c> a</c><00:10:41.500><c> better</c><00:10:41.680><c> visual</c><00:10:42.100><c> to</c><00:10:42.220><c> kind</c><00:10:42.430><c> of</c><00:10:42.550><c> see</c>

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:42.730 align:start position:0%
audience a better visual to kind of see
 

00:10:42.730 --> 00:10:44.430 align:start position:0%
audience a better visual to kind of see
how<00:10:42.850><c> everybody's</c><00:10:43.540><c> connected</c><00:10:44.020><c> to</c><00:10:44.110><c> each</c><00:10:44.200><c> other</c>

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
how everybody's connected to each other
 

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.530 align:start position:0%
how everybody's connected to each other
so<00:10:44.710><c> if</c><00:10:44.920><c> you</c><00:10:45.610><c> can</c><00:10:45.820><c> kind</c><00:10:46.029><c> of</c><00:10:46.089><c> walk</c><00:10:46.300><c> us</c><00:10:46.330><c> through</c>

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:46.540 align:start position:0%
so if you can kind of walk us through
 

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.210 align:start position:0%
so if you can kind of walk us through
what<00:10:46.839><c> we</c><00:10:47.020><c> know</c><00:10:47.200><c> here</c><00:10:47.529><c> is</c><00:10:47.680><c> obviously</c><00:10:48.130><c> it</c>

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:48.220 align:start position:0%
what we know here is obviously it
 

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
what we know here is obviously it

01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:10.170 align:start position:0%
