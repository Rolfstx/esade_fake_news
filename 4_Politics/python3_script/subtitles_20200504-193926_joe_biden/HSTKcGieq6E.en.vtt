Good evening and welcome to the Commonwealth Club of California you can find us online at Commonwealth Club org on

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.429
Facebook and Twitter and on our YouTube channel, I'm Robert Rosenthal

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.349
board member of the Center for Investigative Reporting and your moderator for the program

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.309
I'm now pleased to introduce our special guest David Kay Johnson

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.129
Pulitzer Prize winning journalist founder of DC report org and author of the new book

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.948
It's even worse than you think what the Trump administration

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.799
Is doing to America and some of you may have read the book that he did last summer in summer of?

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
2016 the making of Donald Trump

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.860
tonight we're meeting where constitutional crisis actually may be brewing in Washington over the

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.889
publication or the release tomorrow of the secret report from the Nunez committee

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.050
So while there's tweets distract us and dysfunction acrimony?

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.879
Investigations and attempts to undermine investigations are dominating the news headlines

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:30.819
President Trump's administration is radically changing the policies removing regulations and recreating programs that have defined

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.290
American politics and effect, you know and its effect on all of us for many years

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.909
In his first year the Trump administration's efforts to defund Obamacare repeal LGBT protections in the workplace

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.810
imposed tax cuts and deport undocumented immigrants

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.430
Have significantly impacted millions of Americans all while the the media and the mainstream media has struggled to keep up

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.049
Beyond the tweets firing scandals and indictments how will Trump's policy agenda continue to affect our lives

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.740
David Kay Johnson has many of the answers to that

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.859
David's career in journalism goes back to when he was 18 years old and was recruited by the San Jose Mercury News

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.410
Because it was reporting for two small weekly papers in Santa Cruz at age 19 the mercury hired him as a steep staff writer

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:28.029
Over the next four decades David's award-winning investigations appeared in that paper the Detroit Free Press the Los Angeles Times

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.750
The Philadelphia Enquirer where I first met David where we worked 30 years ago

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.790
And the New York Times, so I just say one thing between the two of us

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.269
We just were talking we probably have a hundred years of experience in

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.210
Journalism and you still have black hair yeah

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.390
It's just genetics

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:56.070
His coverage of tax issues in the New York Times from 1995 to 2008 exposed so many tax dodges and tax cheats

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.870
That one law professor called David the quote de facto chief tax

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.390
enforcement officer of the United States

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.010
David first met

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.549
Donald Trump 30 years ago when he was a reporter at the Philadelphia Inquirer and covering Atlantic City and the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.570
Casinos he was working in the business department I was city editor then

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.889
And he made a name for himself even then but since that time he has been chronicling Donald Trump's personal life business dealings

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.570
From his casinos to his marriages and beyond which leads to our discussion today

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.570
So David

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.540
You're not shy I can tell you that

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:39.899
Which is one of the air marks of a great reporter take us back to when you first met Donald Trump

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.929
And your impressions of him from 1988 and what were you covering? Well I had left the LA Times where?

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.070
I had spent several years exposing Daryl gates in the LAPD

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.139
it was the first person to do that in various other folks that made me a pariah to some of the editors and the

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.279
Philadelphia Inquirer was willing to take on my idea that casino gambling was going to spread all across

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.309
America because of a US Supreme Court decision which it did

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.070
so I arrived in Atlantic City and right after Memorial Memorial Day and

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.050
a couple days later

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.160
I meet Donald Trump

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.429
And we just have a very brief meeting and I get to observe him for about a half an hour

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.470
And as I'm standing there I go

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.410
That's PT Barnum

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.580
Come see the Fiji mermaid

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.259
And

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.859
Donald was the big story in length city had two casinos

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.960
And he was the only colorful character among the owners there were lots of wonderful rogue characters

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.210
I wrote about in my first book temples of chance

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.380
About the casino industry, but Donald was the dominant figure and so I went to prepare for my first interview with him

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.309
And one of the owner of one of the other casinos says Donald. I'm not think I'm not there's Mariners. Oh

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.509
Come on. He owns two casinos running me doesn't know a thing about that business

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:01.249
And then I go to the government regulators from the state of New Jersey, and they go

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.519
Donald is not what we call an operator

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:08.119
Now I talk to his own guys who it turns out

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.339
They're real. Happy to talk they don't like Donald and they say yeah, Donald

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.679
Not only doesn't know how to run the business doesn't anything about it

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.030
But he's messing up the business because he's always just give me money. Give me money. Give me money, so

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.599
I gotta meet Donald for the first long interview

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:29.089
and I gave him four questions all of which had false statements in them and

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:31.909
in each case Donald

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:40.159
Accepted my falsehood and build it into the answer you know and I was suddenly thinking because I'd been in LA just weeks before

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:45.199
He's your boyfriend leaving you does your husband really love you. We're California psychics

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.880
He it was just like that. He's a con artist who's feeding you what he thinks you want to hear

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.430
and that from then on

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.609
Okay, that's what you got to do. You got to treat him as a con artist?

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:03.719
So I tonight usually in these format is David

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.200
There's a talk

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.010
but I'm gonna read from the book on and off because I

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.939
There's things in this book which I recommend everyone to read it's not always fun to read I have to admit it. It was quite

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.179
disquieting in a lot of ways and

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.290
David's written. I don't know how many stories and books about Donald Trump

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.959
But he's also have you ever been sued by him were threatened

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:26.940
Oh, he's been threatened to sue me for about 29 to 30 years. I've known him and

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.340
Why don't well I'll just read this paragraph and Trump is this is Trump

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.910
Has also lived a life of thumbing his nose at conventions and law enforcement learning lessons as a boy from his father Fred

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.170
Whose business partner was an associate of the Gambino and Genovese crime families?

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:49.679
He has long been in deep with mobsters domestic and foreign along with corrupt union bosses and assorted, swindlers

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:57.029
Trump even spent years deeply entangled with it with a major international drug trafficker who like many of the others enjoyed their

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:01.380
Mutually lucrative arrangements now I know you've written in great detail

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.440
but you know if you hear that I mean there's a lot of allegations in there and but

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.410
Like that every fact in there comes from public documents. It's not opinion

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:20.999
Public documents and in this book in the prior book. There's a total of about 65 or 70 pages of source notes and

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:27.750
For example the cocaine trafficker Joseph wexel mom he was a twice convicted felon. He was a mob associate

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:34.619
when Donald got his first casino in the summer of 1984 he needed helicopters to bring high rollers in and

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:41.969
There were a number of casino companies providing helicopters to the casinos companies with long experience in aviation

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.120
Donald goes to this firm

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:50.549
run by wexel Bob and his brother, which has almost no finances, and what it does came from

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.730
subsidies from the city from the state of New Jersey

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.109
He enters into a strange contract with em and rinsed them in apartment in New York City under strange circumstances

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:06.029
They go bankrupt they go bankrupt again

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:14.760
They're on the third version of the company Donald's still using them and then one day Joe excellent is arrested by the DEA and

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.639
He confesses in October of 1985 so a little over a year after first casino open

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.379
to bringing cocaine and marijuana from Colombia to

00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:31.920
Florida to Cincinnati and it's a little unusual to see this in his confession

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:37.410
He confessed to personally handing the drunk handling the drugs. He would take

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:41.760
Keys of cocaine and he would load them into cars and mules would drive them north

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.889
Donald Trump is told about this as a casino owner. He should have cut his ties right there

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:49.290
you're not allowed to concern with people like this I

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:51.810
Don't keeps doing business with him

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:55.170
He writes a letter

00:08:55.570 --> 00:09:02.549
Jo Wexler mom is a credit to the community. He's a stand-up guy who shouldn't serve any time in prison and then the case

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:08.880
to sentence him gets transferred from federal court in Cincinnati, Ohio

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:11.580
not to Florida where

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.210
Wexler Baum had a home not to New York City where he had a home

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.289
But to the New Jersey federal court room of a newly appointed

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.940
relatively newly appointed federal judge Mary Ann Trump Barry

00:09:26.170 --> 00:09:29.459
Now imagine for Mobile you're the chief judge in New Jersey

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.670
And a judge comes down the hall and says listen

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:37.529
I have to recuse myself from this case because my husband works for none'll he flies this man's

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:42.899
Helicopters all the time and by the way he not has even been the pilot for me when I'm flying in

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:50.879
Donald's personal helicopter the Ivana then the terror that would strike in your heart about what if reporters find out we've got a federal

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.749
judge flying around in a drug confessed drug traffickers helicopter

00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:03.989
If any of you heard this story, I told it as often as I could during the campaign

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.680
PBS edited all of it out

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.780
New York Times called up editors couldn't get it in the paper. I got it in foreign newspapers

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.239
I have foreign TV crews come to my house in Rochester, New York

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:17.460
But couldn't get it out even though

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:23.489
It's public record Donald wrote the letter Donald wrote LeMay Kane when he was asked by the casino authorities about it

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.980
He denied writing the letter

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.399
Then they came back with the letter, and he goes. Oh, well. That's my signature, but I don't remember writing the letter

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.400
This is the man with the world's greatest memory

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:35.630
and

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:42.769
The official record of their report on it doesn't ask the AI doesn't say anymore. He just acknowledged. He signed the letter

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:49.309
What is the obvious next question you would ask about why would you sign a letter like that that could cost you your very lucrative?

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.850
licenses for at that point two casinos and

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.080
They didn't ask the question

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.280
and

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.280
I think the obvious

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.399
Question is are you in business with this guy?

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:07.220
Is he your partner? Are you sending him a signal? Don't worry? I'll never rat you out to law enforcement

00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:09.600
Be cool

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:15.409
Because that's what exactly what I believe who's doing so one of the things with David and you're hearing this tremendous

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:20.569
Encyclopedic knowledge around this and the reason I asked he's never been sued because most of his

00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:26.360
It's fact-based and on the record oh no my hat my two houses if if I didn't have that done solid

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:31.759
And I mean talk about I mean one of the things you all should just glancing here. I think in your other books

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:38.840
You've talked about more, but and I will say in this trail, but the bet cement and in New York concrete concrete

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.010
Trump Tower

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:45.860
58 stories not the 68 Donald claims he sort of has an issue about how long things are

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.430
Was one of the first high-rise buildings built with country

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.659
most of the New York high-rises are steel girder construction

00:11:57.660 --> 00:12:00.110
that's become common now, but it was not then and

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:08.209
The key to building a 58 storey concrete building is the reliability of the delivery of the cement it's got to leave the factory

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.840
It's got to be ready

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.480
It's got have only been mixed for a certain number of minutes

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:18.019
And it's got to be poured which means that the Teamsters Union which controls the gate at the construction site has

00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.329
Enormous economic power over you

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.390
They can really mess up your building

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.830
so

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:31.879
Donald had very good relationships because he bought his cement from a company called ans concrete

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:39.889
Ans concrete was owned by Fat Tony Salerno and Paul Castellano the heads of the two biggest and most vicious mob families

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.100
in New York

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.300
So and if you got the Jena vases and the Gambino's with you, you know you're okay

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:53.570
later there was the one of the big racketeering cases where Giuliani brought and

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:58.819
It's the one that resulted in Salerno and a bunch of others going to prison for life or Salerno died

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:07.850
the prosecutor when the convictions came in said that they had successfully stopped the most single the most vicious criminal organization in

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:09.850
the history of the United States and

00:13:10.199 --> 00:13:17.389
One of the charges was the concrete provided to another Donald Trump building Trump Plaza on East 61st Street

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:26.930
One that there's a series of questions here about taxes, and you you were leaked I think last March

00:13:28.589 --> 00:13:30.589
Something that came in the mail

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:35.029
But what y'all wrecked my postman didn't even know it sold, and you know one of the things David

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:40.939
I won the Pulitzer Prize in 2001 when he worked for the New York Times first look at the US tax code

00:13:41.009 --> 00:13:44.659
He's an expert as I alluded to in the introduction so why has it been

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.709
Impossible or up to this point getting his taxes

00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:52.669
Well Donald has guarded his taxes with extraordinary

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:58.250
Care and secrecy the only things that have come out were, New Jersey Casino

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:03.110
Rican troll report from the 70s it covered five years two years three years that he paid

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.289
What would be basically normal taxes for a rising young?

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:08.670
person whose income is growing and

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:15.050
Then two years or his income went negative the last year four point three million dollars of negative income and he paid no income taxes

00:14:15.899 --> 00:14:18.979
There were three summary pages of his

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.300
1995

00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.750
New Jersey, Connecticut and New York

00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:30.110
State income taxes that came out, and then I got in the mail my mailman Rick

00:14:32.459 --> 00:14:33.839
The

00:14:33.839 --> 00:14:35.160
2005

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:42.529
tax return just the form 1040 the first two pages, but there's a great deal of revelatory material in there if you understood taxes and

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:51.619
The reason Donal that works to hide these it comes out of two tax trials he was taught tried twice for tax fraud

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:55.370
civilly not criminally and lost both cases and

00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:03.709
In these trials over his 1984 tax return remember. He just opened Trump Tower and his casino, so his income had just exploded

00:15:04.589 --> 00:15:08.779
He filed what's called a Schedule C. It's what I file as a freelance writer

00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:12.199
That's what many independent consultants and businesses file

00:15:12.389 --> 00:15:17.508
He showed this much income zero and over six hundred thousand dollars of expenses

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.489
So auditors from the state of New York in the city of New York said excuse me well

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.629
We'd like to see the books and records

00:15:23.629 --> 00:15:29.839
Please show us receipts evidence that these this money was spent them that it was reasonable and necessary to earn it the income

00:15:30.839 --> 00:15:36.198
Donal doesn't have any but he tells jack Mitnick his tax lawyer had done this his and his father's taxes for years

00:15:36.199 --> 00:15:37.889
And he's also a CPA

00:15:37.889 --> 00:15:39.889
to take it to trial

00:15:40.949 --> 00:15:42.949
well at trial

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:47.179
Jack Mitnick is shown by Judge Gregory telling of the city of New York the only

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:51.500
Tax return the city has the one that was stamped is received. It's a photocopy and

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.079
Mitnick looks at the return and says that's my under oath

00:15:57.389 --> 00:16:02.719
that's my signature, but neither I nor my firm prepared that tax return I

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.709
Don't know how much better evidence of fraud you need them that

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:12.500
But judge Tillman said in view of the fact that they couldn't find the original. He would waive the penalties the

00:16:13.439 --> 00:16:18.739
state court judge slapped him with the maximum penalties for the same set of facts and

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:25.639
Donald's tax returns, I have no doubt it will show tax fraud, and they'll show

00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:33.319
dubious expenses of all kinds I I'm the shadow IRS commissioner if you follow a shadowing Trump on Twitter and

00:16:33.629 --> 00:16:37.369
like the British have a shadow cabinet or the shadow cabinet and I

00:16:38.279 --> 00:16:39.750
tweeted about

00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:45.919
Gee did did Donald take a reasonable and necessary business seduction for the hundred and thirty thousand dollars of hush money

00:16:46.649 --> 00:16:48.649
storming the annuals

00:16:50.490 --> 00:16:52.490
So do you think

00:16:52.589 --> 00:16:59.419
I'm we're in Calhoun, San Francisco, so the questions are not they're coming from one direction but

00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:03.379
Excuse me. I was born here. Yeah, that's true Christmas Eve

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.669
Do you think Muller is I mean the question of not only

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:16.300
The business dealings and Russian investments in Trump's real estate in the you know the last ten years before he bran right?

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:22.869
which Muller have access to the tax returns and what do you think he's looking at I Muller has the tax returns and

00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:25.810
you know that because it's simply the way a

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:31.540
Competent prosecutor operates and Muller is as good as it gets so there's no privacy issues with that

00:17:31.540 --> 00:17:33.609
No, not at all. No here. This is a law enforcement investigation

00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:38.680
There's a procedure you have to go through and there's paperwork and Pat things you have to do to get the tax returns

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.759
But absolutely he has the tax returns, but tax returns are just the starting point

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:45.760
It's the books and records behind them that matter

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:50.499
That Donald has a habit first of all when he was in business at the end of each month

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.500
He would tear up and throw away his calendar

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.360
So you could always say, I don't know there was a meeting. I don't remember

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:57.410
secondly

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:02.739
the city of New York went to audit his first big project the Grand Hyatt Hotel

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:06.490
He'd been paying about 2.6 million dollars a year annually as

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:11.619
In lieu of rent because of the profits of the hotel and all of a sudden one year. He paid less than

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:17.349
$600,000 so the auditors say we'd like to see the books and records. No you can't see them

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:20.199
They get a ruling yes, we can see them

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:26.170
They show up. Well. You can't see him today. They show up. Oh it turns out that a water main broke

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:33.040
The auditors find out that there's an electronic backup in Chicago, so they go to Chicago

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.359
Oh somebody last night was saving everything and they accidentally erased the records

00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:45.190
Well ultimately they actually find the records no water damage in a storage building in New Jersey

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:51.880
That's the kind of extent that he goes to to hide while he's lying and denied

00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:56.709
So you probably know as much as anybody about his career in life

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:03.610
But and when we're in the book you I think you wrote he's remarkably agile at doing as he chooses and getting away with it

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:06.969
How do you explain that I mean well?

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:11.739
Why doesn't anything stick okay the vast majority of people who commit murders?

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:14.830
Have never get arrested

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:18.550
And the only time to the project some years ago only

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.879
percent of homicides over 10 years in LA County were

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:27.160
Solved the solution to a crime simply means the detectives on the case have persuaded their

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.840
Supervisors that they know who did it even though they can't make the case to arrest them that person

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.490
and

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:39.009
Secondly Donald is very good at compromising people he beat for grand jury investigations

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:43.990
One and and this goes to the Joe exil bomb questions that weren't asked

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:46.220
He was not thoroughly

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:51.879
Investigated for a casino license every casino owner other than Donald got up to 18 months of scrutiny

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:54.370
New Jersey sent detectives all over the world

00:19:54.830 --> 00:20:02.350
You know they went to Lisbon Spain to look up records you had to produce every address. You'd ever lived at your entire life

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:08.289
I mean intense expensive scrutiny and you paid for this by the way. He managed to get a five month investigation

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:15.879
That was not thorough. They didn't even know about two of the grand jury investigations till the last moment which alone should have disqualified him

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.330
but once the state of New Jersey didn't just

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:25.779
Give him a license after a hearing once he became the only person as a casino owner

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:31.779
Recommended for a licensed by the state of New Jersey the bureaucratic imperative took hold

00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:36.159
If they were to ask him the question I did about Joe Buck's album

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:42.010
If they were to dig into a lot of other things that he did that would make him unqualified to hold a casino license

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:48.099
They would have to admit that they were wrong in the beginning and they were never prepared to do that

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:52.480
So he basically is stable and it's continuing

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.039
I guess you could argue to get away with it even tonight, and we'll see what happens if these documents are released

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.680
a lot of the questions are

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:07.210
Can you imagine an impeachment process and how does that unfold if you were from your vanity?

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:08.900
I've thought this through pretty thoroughly

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:14.050
I was lucky when Bob and I were young but I actually got a little piece of the Watergate story

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.840
from Lansing, Michigan of all places

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:25.480
There's no good ending to this story when Donald leaves the White House the country will get beyond this

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.610
I don't want you to get depressed. We'll get past this we we got through the civil war we got through Andrew Jackson

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.260
You know we got through the White House screen burned

00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.010
We'll get through this

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.650
but

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:41.629
Donald's leaving the White House the 25th amendment only works on a voluntary basis or everybody knows the president got shot as with Reagan

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.640
It's not going to happen

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:50.239
There will be no impeachment unless the Democrats have control of the house in the Senate and the Senate remember

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.240
they have to have a two-thirds majority to

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.260
convict

00:21:54.990 --> 00:22:02.449
If that happens and they impeach Trump and remove him from office even if it's a charge among many

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:05.239
If the Russians are a charge

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.740
Can and he's a beneficiary therefore Vladimir Putin's

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.809
interference can Mike Pence be made President of the United States because he would also be a

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:22.130
beneficiary of Putin's interference if he is removed you're immediately going to face the problem that our

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:24.979
former Baltimore resident and local native

00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:28.489
Nancy Pelosi becomes president of the United States

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:35.030
And you can imagine that there will be people in the streets screaming coup d'etat and if this has happened

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:39.259
I believe the only way to deal with it is that Nancy or whoever else is the speaker has to say

00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.189
I'm a caretaker president. Oh nothing to do with the election. This is going to be low-key

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.400
You know much more Jerry Ford than Jerry Ford was

00:22:47.309 --> 00:22:51.829
If Donald is voted out either in a Republican primary in

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:57.380
2020 because clearly some Republicans aren't against him or by the general election

00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:05.390
Donald will scream bloody murder that it was rigged and how do we know that because he says that he won the popular vote and

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:08.809
That it was rigged and that's why Hillary had the votes

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.390
If he's removed from office

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:19.309
whether by the voters or impeachment Donald I believe will spend the rest of his life traveling the country fomenting violence and

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:26.719
Revolution because and why am I confident of that when he was trying to get people to vote for him to win people over

00:23:27.059 --> 00:23:30.859
They beat that guy up. I'll pay your legal bills beat that one up

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:36.380
I'll pay your leak which he'd never do but if he's willing to do that when he's looking for votes after he's been

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.780
Humiliated there would be no can holding him back at all on

00:23:42.299 --> 00:23:46.479
This stuff so if they're going to do this I believe if you're going to impeach him

00:23:47.150 --> 00:23:52.840
Then you have to do it with the plan that you're going to indict him try them getting convicted and imprisoned

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:58.149
Now there there's no reason we can't indict a sitting president. There is a Justice Department

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.590
Regulation that says we can't do it

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.270
So that's why I think that would be

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:06.999
Impeachment and then criminal and there's lots and lots of crimes Donald who's committed lots of them

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.310
And by the way tax fraud is one in which the statute of limitations as with murder doesn't run out

00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.600
That's cheery

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:23.530
Let's go get a drink

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:26.330
So

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:28.299
Let's play out the scenario at the moment

00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:30.459
we're in and we actually may be in you know not a

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:36.520
Historic or you know a Saturday night massacre what the FBI director a trump appointee made clear yesterday

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:44.410
That the document they're apparently going to release tomorrow is inaccurate flawed and really totally inappropriate

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.770
What if he resigns what do you see unfolding?

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:51.910
Well, it's you need to understand. Why this document is so important and here

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:56.559
We are journalists searching may be a document should be put in the record which is sort of contrary to where he would be

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:01.870
But the one of the problems with it is that this doctrine was put out in the record it may well signal to

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.880
Friendly governments stop giving us information, and who were the first people to alert our government that there appeared to be very

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.929
inappropriate

00:25:11.929 --> 00:25:18.908
Communications going on between people around Trump and the Russians well. It was the Dutch the British the Australians and probably others

00:25:18.909 --> 00:25:20.750
Those are the ones we know about

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:28.089
Why would the Israelis trust us to give us information after Donald Trump went and gave the information to the Russian Foreign Minister and?

00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:30.730
the Russian ambassador to Washington DC

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:38.260
Christopher ray trump's appointee spent four years as a federal prosecutor in 13 years defending

00:25:38.929 --> 00:25:44.589
White-collar criminals. He made the year or maybe it's 14 or 15 months before I took office

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:49.449
on very nice living representing the big banks for white-collar crimes

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.330
17 million dollars

00:25:55.429 --> 00:25:57.429
He is faced with a real serious problem

00:25:58.789 --> 00:26:02.229
FBI agents are no doubt. I don't talk to any of them

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.559
I've known lots of FBI just what I'm talking about today the FBI Union but the

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:14.500
Association former officers has complained about this and this denigration of the FBI and the FBI is not perfect

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.589
I mean we all know they can tell pro. Do I need to say more but?

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:20.799
overall it is an

00:26:20.929 --> 00:26:24.548
absolute jewel of the United States government and

00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:28.329
Christopher ray is faced with the problem of if I resign

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:33.189
I no longer have any influence whatsoever and God knows who's going to be in there next

00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:35.799
Mccabe is now gone

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:41.559
The organization has leadership there are very sensitive counterintelligence and other investigations

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:45.610
That need leadership at the top to move forward

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.150
And yet if he doesn't resign

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:57.069
He's being implicit in saying it's okay to do these things and by the way the vote by the House Intelligence Committee

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.940
to release this report

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.940
There was a second vote

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:02.780
to deny

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:04.990
allowing the Democrats to issue a

00:27:05.540 --> 00:27:12.520
Critique of that document he's had every nothing like an area has ever happened. Which that'll get leaked at some point

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:18.669
Hopefully but probably actually probably not I mean first of all as you know in criminal investigations all the leaks you see

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.790
They never come from law enforcement unless they've made a mistake

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:28.059
They come from the defense and and often its defense lawyers. We may never see in the paper

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:33.279
You know some clerk somewhere some low-level person his lawyer may say well

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.810
You know I've got this stuff, and I want to sort of up my place with some journalists and and leak something

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:44.380
So you're out there sort of amongst the little bucks to find those things at the tip of the spear is someone who I?

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.100
Guess this has a certain point of view about Donald Trump

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:52.659
How how much information you sort of getting is coming to you now that is credible

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.230
Or you get tips and leads frequently every day every ten minutes

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.970
I get people who emailed me every day with all sorts of interesting theories

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:06.580
That indicate they don't understand the law or a lot of paranoid delusion with ones

00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:15.490
You know and I always publish my home address and telephone number even when I had little children at home, and I was writing about

00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.010
heavyweight criminals

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:23.080
Never caused a problem, but it did get me stories from time to time like the Trump tax return

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.049
Which I suspect Donald sent, or had sent to me

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:33.130
How do you believe it as Donald has a long history of leaking material about himself and in?

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:39.460
2016 on July 31st and August 1st of 2016 the New York Post on its favorite newspaper

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:44.769
ran really sleazy pictures of Melania

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.140
She and another woman

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:52.310
Naked on a mattress pressed up against a wall. It has a sheet over it

00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:59.479
Lighting like years before yes. Oh yeah, yeah these were shot 20 years ago, and they are but I mean this is not art

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:07.940
Okay, these are just sleazy porn and the New York Post publishes these things and then the post runs the story

00:29:07.940 --> 00:29:12.169
Saying you know they asked the Trump campaign what they thought about it was like it's okay. We're cool

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:19.909
That tells you that Donald was the one who either directly or indirectly put the pictures out there he gets off on that

00:29:20.150 --> 00:29:22.190
It's Melania talking to you no

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.550
I don't think she's talking to Donald much either. Yeah

00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.170
Yeah, yeah, but you raised the issue of what I think about Donald let me be clear

00:29:33.170 --> 00:29:35.690
I find Donald to be endlessly fascinating

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:41.029
The reason I've kept files on them all this year just as they did Daryl gates the police chief in LA until he died Barron

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.369
Hilton the hotelier who's still alive?

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:51.229
And Jack Welch of GE who gave up all his retirement perks after I explained their economics and some other people is I went these

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:53.030
People were important they're gonna come back in the future

00:29:53.030 --> 00:29:54.000
And I'm gonna

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.570
Keep track of them and keep files on them and pay attention to what they're doing and every one I followed his paid off

00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:04.519
well he also is a it's a subject for a journalist and I

00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:11.029
Understand exactly we're talking about because he is fascinating yeah and great story, but he's also and you allude to this in the book

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.619
Not that you I don't think it's fair to say respect him, but you acknowledge. He has a certain

00:30:15.690 --> 00:30:18.320
I'll say this genius or oh yeah

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:21.110
tapped into something and evidently

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:27.139
That has really captured a certain audience not here. Well now you're obtaining now

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:32.869
You're under the painful part of this. Yeah, Donald Trump's economic platform came out of a trilogy of books that I wrote

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:38.180
Perfectly legal and what party are you registered to vote Republican, okay?

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.100
registers a set up I

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:47.360
Wrote a book. I wrote perfectly legal, which John Kerry stopped his campaign for president for three days to read this probably way lost

00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:54.769
About taxes free lunch about subsidies if you know that Walmart builds its stores with your tax dollars. That's because of my work and

00:30:55.380 --> 00:31:02.300
The fine print which was about restraint of trade monopolies and in 2012 I went around saying somebody runs for president on this platform

00:31:02.300 --> 00:31:08.720
They're gonna get elected because the bottom 90 percent of Americans are making less income this year on average than they were in

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.760
1967 and

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:18.229
They're some of them are living in economic Terror the bottom half and all you've got to do is articulate how the government is

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:23.510
Making the rich richer and the rest of you worse off and what does Donald say for too long?

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:28.459
Washington has been taking care of itself and wall street and not you

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:34.219
And I know he watched me on TV because I talked to people he told about this so in some ways

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:36.220
There's a little irony in all of this

00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.320
It's my fault

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:43.580
So yeah you may be the answer his mother's team talked to you

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:45.870
know

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:51.140
Now that mean that you never get leaks from the prosecution you never do I don't mean leaks I mean

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:55.549
No, I mean no reason for me to talk to him, and they're people ask me does

00:31:55.550 --> 00:31:58.700
He come to me there isn't anything I have he a subpoena power reason leave me well

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.880
You've also worked great deal of for public records they told ya yeah

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.709
and and I mean they may well have you know went and check things or in books of mine or something and then said let's

00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:12.260
Go get these records. That's what Glen Glen Simpson. Who did the GPS report in the Chris?

00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:17.449
Mr.. Steel dossier, you know I talked to Glen I know him and he said yeah

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:19.460
one of the first things he did was read my books and

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:25.459
Took leads out of them. You know just getting back to the your cheery scenario

00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.780
but

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:31.610
Basically, I think what you're also saying is that his past is never gonna catch up to him

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:36.860
Well, I think it may now. I mean, I think that's why he wants to he wants Moeller out of there because

00:32:38.010 --> 00:32:41.659
Muller is doing a thorough job and Muller took the 17

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:46.460
Former prosecutors he got to come back to the government

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:50.689
They all walk away from million-dollar up to I guess seventeen million dollar jobs to earn

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:53.630
$190,000 or so as a federal prosecutor

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.980
And they decided we're gonna go create a new law firm. You know Muller and partners

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:03.890
They blow away every other white-collar defense firm in the country. He has a really stellar team of people

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:08.180
One of the issues and it's alluded to it a lot of the questions

00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.120
But it's this sort of the

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:15.079
Distraction or in especially around the tweets and this that was call it the if you want to call it a soap opera the ongoing

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.420
drama

00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.670
Happening up here, and it's almost

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:21.990
I think tactical and George Lake has written a lot about that and I cite him in the book and

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:27.090
But what the book really goes into deeply and it's not fun to read is the dismantling

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:30.720
Right so when we get into a little bit now and and even today

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:34.559
This is current, but it ties into the theme of your book

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.750
the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was basically going to be dismantled

00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:46.199
And I think Mulvaney announced that today and some of the language coming out, and I thought maybe we can talk about something contemporary

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:51.779
It's actually happening, which this dis agency looks at has oversight basically protecting all of us especially

00:33:52.450 --> 00:33:58.769
Lower-income minorities against fraud and how much their they pay in their loans, and there's been many cases

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:02.970
Where companies have overcharged them, and if you're white you're paying a lot less, but

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:09.810
Well veiny actually said is that his view and the agency's view is

00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.010
To get the regulator's off the neck of the people meaning the companies

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:17.880
and serve their views right their needs so

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:23.040
This pattern is something you go chapter and verse and maybe you can talk about oceans the Clean Water Act

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:28.110
I mean and what you're seeing happening well what you're seeing in the team Trump. Do it's not Donald

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:32.759
He spends about five hours a day playing president and by the way during the campaign. He said you know well

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.709
I'm not gonna be the president. I'm gonna appoint somebody to do the job. He literally said that during the campaign

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:42.390
at the the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau which was

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:48.420
Elizabeth Warren's baby, and I've known Elizabeth for thirty years, and I find considered her the finest public servant

00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:50.420
I have ever met in my life

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:54.180
incredibly thoughtful and dedicated and opened the eyes up of

00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:59.189
Washington and a lot of other people to things they didn't know about bankruptcy in America, and how the law works

00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:07.019
That agency has won back about four times the amount of money it costs to run it

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:12.540
I mean, that's you would think gee we should put more money into this. This is an effort. That's really doing good things

00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:20.670
But of course it's winning back that money by taking it back from banks like Warren Buffett's Wells Fargo Bank that were out ripping people

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:22.670
off

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:29.879
So they want to get rid of that, and it's indicative of the pattern of what they're doing when Trump said we've eliminated all regulations

00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:34.260
Well, I used to teach regulatory law I'm not a lawyer, but for eight years

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:39.270
they taught regulatory law at Syracuse University in the third year honors law students and

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:47.280
They're not fixing regulations that have gotten out of time they're going in and saying oh

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:51.239
You're the beautiful clean coal companies

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.349
we're going to just remove all the

00:35:53.349 --> 00:35:59.849
Regulations that deal with that ugly nasty dirty coal that causes people to get cancer and asthma and heart disease and let you just do

00:35:59.849 --> 00:36:02.159
Whatever you want with your beautiful clean coal

00:36:03.309 --> 00:36:05.729
We're going to not enforce the Clean Water Act

00:36:06.250 --> 00:36:12.149
We're going to allow electric utilities after they have burned coal, and they have this toxic residue

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.760
to continue doing the early

00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:21.960
ninth 20th century practice of you spray it with water until it flows you put it in a slurry pond and

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:25.889
You build those ponds typically next to rivers where people get their drinking water

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:30.869
And you may remember in the news in the last few years some of those dikes broke and there were rivers where people had to

00:36:30.869 --> 00:36:33.929
Drink bottled water for weeks or months and all the fish were killed

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:36.970
the

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:41.549
at the OSHA the Occupational Health and Safety Administration

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:50.159
They stopped posting press releases designed to shame companies that through bad practices killed a worker

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:55.410
We wrote about that a DC report they then put them back up, and I can't prove causality

00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:00.839
But that's the timeline and then they stopped doing it again, then they stopped posting death

00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:07.650
4,800 people a year are killed on the job, and they would put up you know the person when it happened etcetera

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.200
August 17th last one was up

00:37:10.539 --> 00:37:13.559
So then you go and say well, how about the statistical data?

00:37:13.559 --> 00:37:18.778
You know how many people were crushed how many were electrocuted etc etc. You can't have that

00:37:19.809 --> 00:37:23.548
They are withdrawing from the record of these things at the EPA

00:37:23.549 --> 00:37:31.259
I tell a story of the woman named Betsy Sutherland who can talk because she took retirement she was also retirement age who was

00:37:31.809 --> 00:37:34.349
deeply involved with Clean Water Act enforcement

00:37:35.140 --> 00:37:36.819
Scott Pruitt's

00:37:36.819 --> 00:37:41.639
Subordinates the people I call political termites because you don't see them there working in the background

00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.460
Ordered that and protoid them to write very very detailed multi hundred page report

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:54.270
Giving every single weakness if they went to court or tried to enforce the law against polluters

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.520
every detail they possibly new and

00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:04.020
being bureaucrats they followed the orders they were given they wrote these very detailed reports scott pruett who locks the

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:10.379
Outer area the outer outer area towards his office and requires any employee who is summoned to empty their pockets

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.610
including their

00:38:12.610 --> 00:38:14.470
cell phone

00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:16.470
Comes to a meeting

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.490
It's a one-way conversation

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:23.459
Occasionally Pruett or one of his people will say, I'm sorry I didn't catch that word that kind of question

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:25.829
And then they took all the information and left

00:38:27.130 --> 00:38:30.480
Well, we don't literally know what they did with it because they won't tell us

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.719
But I would guess there's a very good chance that this particular

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.169
Report is at the US Chamber of Commerce and all the big coal companies

00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:43.020
So it's a huge amount of information in this book and it and again sort of stunning

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:46.500
I think maybe depending on your political points of view

00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:52.260
But how do you imagine this sort of all being conveyed I mean if you want to talk about Scott Pruett?

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:56.429
I mean, it's it's outrageous really what what you lay out in the book and a lot of that's been out there

00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.599
But you know nothing is this gonna stick you see this translated into

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:03.700
specific

00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:07.919
Tactics that really can change the political dialogue, and you looked or the midterms

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:11.309
Or as well, just too much for people to understand well

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:14.430
That's part of the problem is how is the public can respond to this?

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:16.619
I mean one of the things a lot of people have is Trump fatigue

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:21.750
And I've had many people in the radio shows and things I've been doing who call in who go

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:26.280
I know more than I want to know about Trump, and I try to say to them yeah

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.499
but you know about the fall drawl and the

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:33.000
tweets and the racism and the palace intrigues you don't know what he's doing to you and

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:40.740
I think people in specific interest groups and areas have to arouse people's interest about what's happening here

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.710
You know we have a lot fewer deaths from asthma

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:49.889
Cancer and heart disease than we would otherwise have because Richard Nixon signed the clean air and the clean water acts

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:52.590
and we had enforced them and

00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.110
We have fewer worker deaths

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:59.789
We have been doing a not as good as we could but a reasonably good job of over time

00:40:00.130 --> 00:40:02.789
Dealing with worker deaths and injuries on the job

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:09.059
Underfunded OSHA, but got better clearly if you're a marginal employer, you know well

00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:13.830
Maybe I'll follow the best safety practices, and maybe I'd like to buy about this summer

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.179
And the cost of killing a workers minimal to a significant corporation

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:23.490
Well what the Clean Water Act is being undone yes about that do you want to talk about?

00:40:23.490 --> 00:40:26.580
What's happening with that and what you think might that should be a bipartisan issue?

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:29.640
I mean you want your kids drinking the water laced with cadmium

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.239
It's real simple if you do well you know fine

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:38.429
Did you know and all your dealings with with the president and mr.?

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:41.669
Trump over the years Donald Donald as you call him

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:46.979
Have you gotten under his skin that you're aware of or of the book? Can I borrow the book?

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.569
Here, so I'm worked up here over the back quote Donald gave us a blurb on

00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:54.550
the back of the book

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:59.550
He didn't mean to give us a blurb to be clear. I know the reporter is a weird dude

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.590
Who's been following me for 25 years so obviously? He hasn't done well

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:11.669
He's been following me in a negative fashion for 25 years always a hit, and I'm president so he hasn't done a very good job

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.260
What was I don't disagree with him on that

00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:23.939
What was the contrast of that comment after I got Donald's tax return and the White House authenticated it, and they also did something

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:27.330
That's one of the most disreputable things you can do as a PR person

00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:31.860
Before my story was posted a DC report and right after that I went on Rachel Maddow

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:36.989
But we broke the story Sean Spicer gave copies of it to all the newspaper and TV reporters

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:43.649
You just don't do that in public relations with somebody story. It's considered just about as bad as knows Bob's agreeing with you here

00:41:44.170 --> 00:41:45.370
and

00:41:45.370 --> 00:41:50.099
The next day he went on Tucker Carlson, who is the new Bill O'Reilly and his

00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:56.969
tax return was 153 million dollars of income 100 million dollar tax shelter that I write about and explained an

00:41:57.460 --> 00:42:01.800
illegal one shutdown by Congress and 49 million dollars of taxable income

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.040
153 million Donal goes on Tucker Carlson says well, you know I made 250 million dollars

00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:13.590
And then there was this hundred million or deduction I got so then it's a hundred and fifty million dollars, man

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:15.690
Can't even keep his own tax returns straight

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.069
So what would be the benefit of his leaking that to you if you think it came with?

00:42:20.530 --> 00:42:23.580
Why it is first of all showed he made a tremendous amount of money?

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:26.100
three million dollars a week

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:29.070
Secondly he paid a lot of taxes by the way most news organizations

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:35.040
Said he paid thirty eight million dollars in taxes because that was the White House press release if they had just looked at the return

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.499
They would know he paid thirty six million dollars in taxes

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:43.950
Reporters often read the press release, and they don't look at the evidence right in front of their eyes

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:50.609
What the reason Donnell wasn't thrilled when I when when the story appeared as I thought?

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:52.890
I think he expected I would write a story saying you made a lot of money

00:42:52.890 --> 00:42:56.460
And you paid a lot of taxes you paid about roughly the rate that I do about twenty four percent

00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.620
Except that

00:42:59.620 --> 00:43:02.880
But for a back up tax called the alternative minimum tax

00:43:03.130 --> 00:43:06.630
How many of you pay the AMT if you know a fair number of people?

00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.989
But for that back up tax he would have paid five million dollars on a hundred and fifty three million

00:43:13.510 --> 00:43:17.430
That's less than three and a half percent and that turns out to be a very important number

00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:21.900
In two thousand five the poorest half of Americans who file tax returns

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:26.310
made three hundred dollars a week not three million a week three hundred dollars a week and

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:31.079
Their average federal tax rate was a little more than three and a half percent

00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:34.530
Donald has called for eliminating the AMT

00:43:35.230 --> 00:43:40.920
That means Donald Trump believes on three million a week that he should be taxed more lightly than

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:44.009
people who make three hundred dollars a week and

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:49.319
when I story emphasize that and I emphasized it on TV and

00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:55.260
Clearly Donald was very upset and of course by the way this portion of the AMT

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.649
He got all of it back to the next year the year after

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:04.289
Because well people like me the AMT that we pay we don't get back if you're in real estate

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.930
It is essentially a refundable tax

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.450
against future

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:11.620
Depreciation

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:13.390
Have any

00:44:13.390 --> 00:44:14.800
future income

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:17.999
Have you ever been approached to like work on a campaign, or as an advisor?

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.289
Or do you think that would you do that? No what juncture I'd be a terrible alter Shabbat

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.350
Not a pot you know but yo you down a politician

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:29.349
But I mean it's working now. I don't do that

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:34.600
I don't I I speak to any but I mean I'll speak to anybody I speak to right-wing groups left-wing groups

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:39.160
I'm the only the only person. I won't do a show on and he calls me a coward is is

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.540
is

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.019
Infowars because alex jones is so crazy

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:51.820
Donald Trump endorses by the way that he's real news not fake news you can go on the internet and watch his 45-minute rant

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:59.650
Interdimensional beings have taken over the elites, but thanks to Infowars it's beginning to come out

00:45:01.910 --> 00:45:06.369
Well he has a big following to which is that we can get into the whole media, and that's really terrifying

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:09.160
You're right huge following you know and that's why?

00:45:09.650 --> 00:45:11.630
Beings don't care in a moment

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:17.650
Where obviously I call the divide the information divide whether you want to call it the media divide and the audience goes where they want?

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:21.760
But Alex Jones does have a huge following Sean Hannity has a huge following

00:45:22.610 --> 00:45:24.640
Have you been on Hannity or would you?

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:29.920
I don't think that Sean Hannity has the courage to put me on his show okay that may get it

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:33.729
Okay, and by the way if you're tweeting do that I also

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:38.350
Shot and I'll say this Sean Hannity doesn't have the courage to put me on live

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:44.110
Fox tapes most of those shows you see when i'm on CNN ABC

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:53.979
MSNBC BBC, which i'm off and on in primetime from my home. Those are all live

00:45:54.770 --> 00:45:59.439
But when I was on Bill, O'Reilly it was taped so he could edit it and make you look the way he wants

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:04.840
Sean Hannity doesn't have the courage to have me on his show live

00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:09.340
And that in itself shows that he's not fair and balanced

00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:12.850
Which let's talk a little bit about the media

00:46:12.850 --> 00:46:16.630
I mean that I mean there's a lot of questions around that and sort of the question of following

00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:20.709
Tweets as it terms in terms of instead of going what you've done in your book

00:46:20.710 --> 00:46:26.020
I know you're fairly critical of what you know. I think mainstream media has done or not done

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:31.330
Well during the campaign there was terrible failure to scrub the candidate

00:46:31.330 --> 00:46:34.029
That's the term in the business for investigating the background

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:38.650
But I actually think the coverage in the White House by the York Times the LA Times knight-ridder

00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:42.939
Politico Bloomberg of Washington Post has been

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:45.440
phenomenal and

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.710
Many of the stories you see they involve

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:53.650
Lots and lots and lots of over weeks going to this person getting from that one teasing out something over here

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:58.509
And then finally being able to pull it together, and I mean it's really serious detective working

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:04.779
I'm I'm mightily impressed by a great deal of it what I mean one of the things that was astonishing to me

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.780
But maybe not so much to you is it

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:11.589
Especially early on and slowed down a little bit with the leaks coming out of the White House. Yeah well

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:17.289
Do you like it that was like when Donald's guys were leaking to me left and right? This is a man who he expects absolute?

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:21.009
Fealty to him it is not only a one-way street

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:25.420
And he tends to hire people who have some

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:29.979
flaw somewhere that they are not going to be as successful somewhere else and and

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.720
He you know he also has this philosophy. That's very important

00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:39.010
Donald wrote in one of the books or someone wrote for him in one of the books

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:43.060
He said in speeches and a number of forums that his life

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:48.850
Philosophy is revenge if someone just declines to do you a favor

00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:54.160
because they think that the ethically can't do so hit him in the face 15 times and

00:47:55.040 --> 00:47:57.040
He says I get pleasure from

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:59.259
destroying the lives of these people and

00:47:59.330 --> 00:48:03.160
He tells about a particular woman who he got rid of and then her marriage fell apart

00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:07.209
And she lost her home, and it made him happier and happier as each of these things happen

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:09.730
This is the man Jerry Falwell calls a fine Christian

00:48:11.570 --> 00:48:14.289
He says that anyone who turns the other cheek

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:16.730
Sermon on the Mount is

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:20.800
A fool an idiot mashach, and he's not using the third word as a redundancy

00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:23.620
He means it in the most vile definition of that it'sh work

00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:29.259
So I'm not surprised people are leaking a lot of place furthermore. This is a White House

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:34.420
he didn't bring a political organization of people who came with him they went out and grabbed people and

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:39.969
They're in the White House pretty heavy experience, and hey there's this reporter, and I can like you know and who knows in the future

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:42.050
Leaked to them something

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:44.350
So you do you think there's any sort of?

00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:50.259
Solution to the divide. I mean I'm not sure how this talk would have gone if we or say in, Missouri

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:56.259
Or a red state and but I mean are you thinking about that I mean the book?

00:48:56.810 --> 00:49:03.009
is really clear it's really clear where you're coming from it's it's it's not heartening to read it and

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:09.250
Yet, it's also not something somebody who likes Trump is probably going to read over, and you'll be discounted as an endeavor

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:13.270
So how do you know when you're dealing with this and thinking about? How do you like bridge this divide?

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:18.310
Which I think we'd all like to try and do it you thinking about that in a solution no

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:18.640
Yeah

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:26.440
I mean there has been a more than 40 year well increasingly well-funded campaign to attack on this journalism in this country

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:30.520
Read her vine who started saying called accuracy in media

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:33.609
Was the key big early player in this?

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:37.839
And I've been the subject of a lot of these attacks over the years

00:49:37.839 --> 00:49:40.659
I mean I've been right in the battlefield with these people and

00:49:41.869 --> 00:49:48.879
I can point to things and say you know you guys wrote this piece that I did this terrible thing and it's that ADA isn't

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.250
what I said and be here's the facts you can read them and

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:58.899
Many of them are people who are not adults their children they you know what the during a child an adult pretty fundamentally is

00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:05.020
Children make true that which they wish to be true. You know as grown-ups. We go boy

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:09.459
Unhappy that's the way it is, but I recognize. That's the way it is and

00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:16.029
We've developed especially with the Internet and the silos where you can be in the neck of chamber

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:20.290
A lot of people who don't want to hear any news that

00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:23.559
Doesn't reconfirm what they believe if you want to know a lot about this

00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:27.459
There's a slim excellent little book by Farhad Manjoo called true enough

00:50:28.220 --> 00:50:30.220
and one of the things like

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:37.359
social psychologists and sociologists and others have found by testing is that if somebody believe something that isn't true and

00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:41.649
They're shown the evidence it isn't true if you're a journalist

00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:45.939
Your training says well. You got to go where the facts go like it or not

00:50:46.099 --> 00:50:52.809
But most people this research shows double down, and they just reject the factual world

00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:58.809
so true enough does a good job very short read of explaining this stuff and

00:50:59.839 --> 00:51:02.619
Part of the problem is that I mean the underlying real?

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.680
This is the America's education system was designed in

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:12.549
the early stages of American dust realizations as we went from an agrarian nation after the Civil War to an industrial nation and

00:51:12.799 --> 00:51:15.639
That system was designed to produce read and write in the mirth

00:51:16.819 --> 00:51:23.979
Metacritic illegals I have had better conversations about economics culture art politics with

00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:29.230
The waiter my wife, and I had in a roadside cafe in Austria

00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:32.480
the chambermaid

00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:36.189
Cleaning my room in Hannes burg South Africa than I've had with

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:40.929
people who are senior executives running for thousand-dollar suits and

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:46.869
it's very troubling to see that we're not teaching these these critical things skills and my friends who are

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:53.409
Immigrants to this country one of my best friends grew up in Siberia because his appearance were on the outs with the Kremlin

00:51:54.730 --> 00:52:01.990
He just marvels at how you know. He just keeps talking about how can Americans not critically think about what's going on and

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:04.420
It's a real problem

00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:09.970
But I don't I think the underlying issue is we have to teach critical thinking skills and stop running an education system to produce drones

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:13.990
Thank you

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:18.999
David can you know in terms of the collusion issues with the campaign?

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.049
But it go much deeper in terms of Russian and this whole question the Putin is

00:52:23.359 --> 00:52:26.139
He taking us through to the best of your knowledge sort of the

00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:32.020
Linkage and the investment of the Russian oligarchs or money especially in real estate

00:52:32.329 --> 00:52:36.219
Let me make a suggestion about how to think about Vladimir Putin and influence

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:39.399
Vladimir Putin believes democracy is a joke

00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.270
He said this repeatedly he has said they want to undermine democracy

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:49.270
The oligarchs who are the biggest criminal gang in the world and he's their head have repeatedly tried to

00:52:49.790 --> 00:52:50.990
Not only

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:58.179
Upset the political and electoral processes and democracies, but they have rate tried to raid the wealth of the West

00:52:58.819 --> 00:53:04.239
The whole Icelandic banks scandal was a Russian scheme to steal the pension wealth of England

00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:11.139
Netherlands if you're Vladimir Putin you think like the people on Sand Hill Road the venture capitalists in Silicon Valley

00:53:11.900 --> 00:53:15.609
You've got all these opportunities to do things to undermine or

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:20.949
Cop promis-- people or develop people who may be unwitting agents lots of opportunities, so

00:53:22.250 --> 00:53:26.560
Out of a thousand you fund a hundred ninety-five of them are a bust they didn't worked out

00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.829
four of them, maybe Carter pages in this group

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:35.919
Provides you with enough to justify the 95 that went nowhere, and then you get Amazon

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:38.800
Donald Trump is vitam repute ins Amazon

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:44.619
and he hit the jackpot and the Russians have been grooming Donald Trump since 1987 when they

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:49.209
provided the Donald Trump and his wife with a trip to Russia and

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:52.450
royally treated them while they were there and

00:53:54.260 --> 00:53:57.879
Donald Trump is not a sophisticated, man. He's not a sophisticated thinker

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:01.700
He's not the kind of guy who would even

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:08.619
Realize he's slowly being sucked in and being compromised and Carter page and you've seen him on TV. I mean talk about a weird, dude

00:54:10.579 --> 00:54:12.470
Carter page

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:16.929
Was involved with two known Russian spies, and I think maybe three

00:54:16.930 --> 00:54:23.500
But two for sure so it's entirely reasonable that the u.s.. Counterintelligence operation is looking at Carter page

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:27.999
What are you doing with these people we know to be spies? Why are you meeting with them?

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:32.919
Why are you doing business with them, and now what are you doing with the Trump campaign and your name Donald Trump's?

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:38.139
You know advisor on international relations even though you don't have any chops for the job

00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:42.579
If you or I were bi counterintelligence guys we'd say yeah

00:54:42.579 --> 00:54:46.689
but follow that very carefully and that's what the newest memo is in part about and

00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:52.510
so the way to think about all this is you know we have an adversary a

00:54:53.780 --> 00:55:00.879
Hostile foreign power that is determined to weaken our position and that certainly did not want Hillary Clinton in the White House somebody

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:04.030
I don't hold any book for she tried to get me fired at the New York Times

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:10.119
But he didn't want her because she would have made him feel

00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:15.609
Enormous pain up to the edge of going to war to get him out of the Crimea. She was very clear about that

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.780
She wasn't gonna go to war over Crimea, but she was going to make him pay

00:55:20.390 --> 00:55:22.390
If he didn't give up Crimea

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.300
And he wants to keep Crimea. He wants his one water port

00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:30.439
So how much I mean in terms of the mother maybe you're where some of these things

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:32.780
But in terms of following the money the old adage

00:55:32.849 --> 00:55:38.659
Where is that going? Everybody could go in terms of showing the relationship the potential for money laundering?

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:41.659
You know a lot of these things have or in the buzz

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:48.200
Or it when Trump Tower opened technically in November 30th of 1983, but really in early 84

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.230
It was one of only two prime

00:55:51.660 --> 00:55:56.089
Residential buildings in New York where anonymous wealth could make a purchase

00:55:56.089 --> 00:56:02.089
you know the city of the state of New York's co-op laws if they had if the South had discovered them the

00:56:02.190 --> 00:56:04.190
civil rights movement have failed

00:56:04.559 --> 00:56:09.769
under those co-op laws you want to buy an apartment in New York City you have to show your tax returns and

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:16.040
You know how your dog barks and everything else before you are allowed to buy into a building

00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:23.089
Trump and Olympia Tower owned by the family of the Anastos family would take

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:27.139
Companies that you know know who they are so you could walk in and say hi

00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:32.150
I'm I I'm a lawyer. I represent a company called snow Inc in the Cayman Islands

00:56:32.250 --> 00:56:38.540
You know it might be a ski lodge in Colorado, and it might be a cocaine cartel in Medellin they don't care

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:40.010
They just say oh, well yes

00:56:40.010 --> 00:56:44.839
And here's how much the apartment is and these were premium prices because you got to hide your identity

00:56:45.299 --> 00:56:47.629
Trump Tower is full of criminals

00:56:47.819 --> 00:56:54.439
It's the most watched building in New York City by Interpol the FBI the New York State Police and has been for years

00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:57.329
and

00:56:57.329 --> 00:57:02.808
gotten so Donald Trump made a lot of money off of selling apartments to these people and when he got in trouble and

00:57:03.329 --> 00:57:06.979
He couldn't pay his bankers, and he told me one day's worth three million dollars

00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:08.980
Just before I revealed he wasn't a billionaire

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:14.780
And you know I said it Donald one point Donald if you're a billionaire pay your bills if you're really a billionaire

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:19.069
Billionaire can't pay his bills because he's not a billionaire

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:26.299
When the banks cut him off except for deutsche bank the preferred bank for russian money laundering

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:32.389
He began to get influxes of capital from russians in various ways

00:57:32.910 --> 00:57:38.270
The most outrageous deal and the easiest to see what was going on is two miles from mar-a-lago

00:57:39.270 --> 00:57:47.119
Some nouveau, riche people, built a house that would make the Texas Oil Barons of the 50s looked like masters of sophisticated taste

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:49.829
I

00:57:49.829 --> 00:57:52.669
Looked at this building and went what hath God wrought?

00:57:53.790 --> 00:57:54.839
and

00:57:54.839 --> 00:57:57.559
He buys it for 40 or 41 million dollars

00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:58.770
in

00:57:58.770 --> 00:58:03.619
2008 Donald declares that an act of God has destroyed the real estate

00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:07.189
Market the market is he says dead in all of America

00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:10.669
He tries to get out of a loan to Deutsche Bank of 40 million dollars

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:15.800
That's coming too and along comes Dmitri rebel of Lev one of the oligarchs

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:23.659
Who pays Donald a hundred million dollars 95 plus a commission that as Donald tells the story for this property?

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:28.849
Well once it becomes an issue, and it would have been a big issue if he had been the state senator or a mayor

00:58:30.359 --> 00:58:35.088
Donald's the cover story. That's put out is that River love love was getting divorced and he's a

00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.909
Multi-billionaire, and he was hiding money from his wife

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:44.060
Now I want you to just imagine you're trying to hide money from your spouse in anticipation of a divorce

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:46.760
Would you go pay two or three times what something is worth?

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:53.270
I mean why not just take a match to your money and burn it up you would buy things at a discount

00:58:53.790 --> 00:58:54.810
and

00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:57.319
They were putting money in Donald's pocket

00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:03.470
One of the sons came back from a conference in Moscow and said the Russians are giving us all the money to buy the golf

00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:04.829
courses

00:59:04.829 --> 00:59:05.760
that was

00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:11.540
2007 so is any of that illegal is that word mothers going do you think tens on what's going on it could be illegal could

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:17.959
Not be illegal. I mean the Trump is so concerned about the answer. I always taught my law students to every question is it depends

00:59:20.220 --> 00:59:21.410
So yes I mean

00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:27.530
I'm sure there's clear going to be clear criminality involving this money laundering deals done in Panama

00:59:27.810 --> 00:59:32.509
Ripping people off the previous book the making of Donald Trump has a lot about these corrupt deals

00:59:32.510 --> 00:59:39.530
And how he ripped various people off and and it isn't just Donald when they were trying to sell condos in

00:59:41.490 --> 00:59:43.260
In Baja, California

00:59:43.260 --> 00:59:48.290
Where to get there, you'd have to drive through Tijuana which is right now one of the most violent cities in America

00:59:48.290 --> 00:59:52.159
I think in the Americas. I think only Tegucigalpa is is more dangerous

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.429
They held an event to encourage people to buy and they want Trump comes and

00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:01.999
To persuade one woman to do the deal she says well

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:06.228
you know I'm getting a unit two maybe I'll come by and borrow a cup of sugar I

01:00:07.259 --> 01:00:09.259
Mean these are polished

01:00:09.479 --> 01:00:11.479
swindlers and drifters

01:00:13.859 --> 01:00:15.859
Well David's point of view is clear

01:00:17.339 --> 01:00:21.228
And I near the end of the book you quote a

01:00:21.749 --> 01:00:27.109
Sociologist named Johnson Knight, and I recommend you all because I was thinking this book went in with something uplifting mm-hmm

01:00:28.769 --> 01:00:33.439
So I'm gonna just this is another sentence she wrote, and then we're getting close to the end here

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.229
But how can here's what you basically go through an imagery?

01:00:36.229 --> 01:00:40.819
And it's you can imagine sitting next to someone like Donald Trump on a plane and your own impressions of him

01:00:40.819 --> 01:00:44.659
And you go through that scenario, but at the end of that scenario. I won't get in all the details

01:00:47.039 --> 01:00:50.569
But you basically say this is after your hearing this Trump

01:00:50.569 --> 01:00:57.919
Speaking use your stranger you would I imagine fear you were to use a trumpian term stuck next to a nutjob until your trip ended

01:00:58.229 --> 01:01:02.959
How can it be that millions of people do not see Trump for what he is an autistic

01:01:03.509 --> 01:01:04.920
ill-informed

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.920
thriving old blowhard

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:10.819
So do you have a I mean? You've thought a lot about this and

01:01:11.369 --> 01:01:16.758
What do you say you know my yeah, but I mean also. This is really and you say this in the book Trump

01:01:16.759 --> 01:01:19.309
It's this Trump, and this release is all about America

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:22.758
And who we are and what we are as a country because again if we were in a different part of the country

01:01:23.999 --> 01:01:29.029
You know the reception would be very different. I mean you're traveling around the United States now

01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:32.539
I I don't know what the audiences are like you're on radio shows but

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:37.339
Why doesn't this stick I mean it is this divide around culture around values?

01:01:38.039 --> 01:01:40.518
About belief and there are many people

01:01:41.219 --> 01:01:46.249
Who think you know as you said, maybe may take those treats and protect him well one of the ways

01:01:46.249 --> 01:01:50.539
I think about it is when you and I were in high school at the same time there were ads

01:01:51.180 --> 01:01:55.789
That if you put this stuff in your hair called Brylcreem the girls would be all over you right

01:01:57.119 --> 01:02:04.369
Sounds absolutely ridiculous right they sold a lot of Brylcreem when my oldest son was about to go to college

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:10.519
They ran the I think I have a tiling right they ran the these ads where if you

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:15.199
I'm from a certain brand of beer in your dormitory the Swedish bikini team would show up a

01:02:16.350 --> 01:02:18.379
particularly absurd idea and

01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:23.569
It sold a lot of that brand to beer people respond to these images

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:29.989
And we're manipulable and so Donald through his TV show sold this image of himself as being this fabulously

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:31.800
fabulously successful

01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.630
businessman and

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:35.810
the media plays a role in this Trump

01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:40.310
He now said I'm worth eight point seven billion ten billion more than ten billion at one point. He said 11 billion

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:46.999
After he became president. He asked if he could file his financial disclosure statement without signing it under penalty of perjury

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:52.129
and when he was told no he filed it, and it's 1.4 billion and

01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:54.869
That's exaggerated, too

01:02:54.869 --> 01:03:01.159
because he lists his Scottish golf courses where he has to report revenues and profit or loss as

01:03:01.890 --> 01:03:07.490
More than 50 million, and he's characterizing as being worth more than a hundred million dollars. They're losing money

01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:10.159
I don't know about you, but I don't think I'd admit

01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:16.639
Gulf course doesn't even have a revenue to justify that kind of price so

01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:23.960
There's a lot of cultural forces at work, but the air zat's experience of television. We haven't fully adapted to

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:26.130
You know Vance Packard?

01:03:26.130 --> 01:03:30.200
1958 we wrote a book the hidden persuaders why do you pick up the red box read the blue box?

01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:32.820
And Donald is a real

01:03:32.820 --> 01:03:38.539
Master of how to get you to look at you know pay attention to this is a living nor that there is no stake

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:44.150
And be fun to have you and Donald Trump on the stage, and we have a surprise guest come on in

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:49.969
But unfortunately we've reached the point in our bargain where this time only one last question

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:54.530
It's the two-minute warning, and here's a question from the audience, which maybe

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:59.300
Lead to a hopeful answer, but potentially a solution and the question is hard to imagine

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:06.950
It's worse than I think but aside from the midterm elections and gubernatorial races. What are the three most important points?

01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:09.950
We need to act upon to counter the damage oh

01:04:10.530 --> 01:04:15.619
I like that well first of all you know I'm a very I'm optimistic among other things

01:04:15.619 --> 01:04:17.989
She can't be the father of eight children and not be optimistic

01:04:20.850 --> 01:04:22.500
Number one

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:27.319
You need to listen to pee people who think Donald was terrific and people who disagree with you

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:29.490
sympathetically

01:04:29.490 --> 01:04:32.449
You know and find out why they believe the things they do

01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:37.399
You don't get anywhere by telling them. They're stupid. They don't know what they're doing

01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:40.729
Many people who support Donald Trump

01:04:40.730 --> 01:04:42.800
You know may not know jack about politics

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.249
but if you were sitting in a and I've done this sat in singing in a

01:04:46.319 --> 01:04:52.009
blue-collar bar in Michigan or Ohio or Western New York where I live dressed in the right attire and

01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:57.829
Something happens on the TV with a sports game. You will see the most incredible analytical skills that work

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.859
Because people are engaged in these things so

01:05:01.290 --> 01:05:08.449
When people over could Jol them make that word part of your life cajole people to think things may be different

01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.540
the second thing is

01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:17.270
Don't just post things on the internet invent act

01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:24.679
Make sure you're registered to vote make sure your family and friends are registered to vote on before Election Day

01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:30.949
arrange to go to some district that is turnable and go help drive people to the polls if

01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:37.249
Enough if they had done that in Wisconsin during the recalls instead of trying to outspend the koch brothers on ads

01:05:37.829 --> 01:05:40.309
Imagine unions trying to outspend the koch brothers on ads

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:46.310
Scott Walker, I don't think would be governor of Wisconsin because at the end of the day, it's only the votes that matter

01:05:46.310 --> 01:05:51.019
but it's more than that you got to get people to vote you can get them to to the polls and

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.470
thirdly

01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:58.789
Start a discussion about what kind of America we want to have

01:05:59.730 --> 01:06:06.290
This country was founded by people who embrace the Enlightenment the idea of reason

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:10.700
and fact and its purpose I believe is to

01:06:11.310 --> 01:06:16.339
Ennoble the human spirit and set it free to see what human beings can be?

01:06:17.099 --> 01:06:22.309
But there's always a tug by people who want to have an authoritarian telling them what to do

01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:25.759
that will extinguish that spirit and

01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:29.569
You want to get people to think about what kind of America?

01:06:29.609 --> 01:06:37.098
Do you want do you want the kind of America where today? You can't walk into a courthouse without being searched and the police have

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.990
my automatic rifles

01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:44.320
Do you want to have an America where we have children reports of children all over the country being?

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:50.710
told go back to Mexico or go back to Egypt or wherever and insulted because of the color of their skin or the

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:52.870
way their hair is and

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000
women being treated the way that

01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:57.670
We've seen after the Billy Bush tape

01:06:58.610 --> 01:07:05.710
Talk about the positive talk about what we can be what we can be what we can be so thank you

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:15.530
Okay

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:24.229
Well said our thanks to David Kay Johnson Pulitzer prize-winning journalist founder of DC report org and

01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:30.709
Author of the new book it's even worse than you think what the Trump administration is doing to America we also
