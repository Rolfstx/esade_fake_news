00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.190
Private jets represent an inconceivable level
of opulence.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.480
If the average American were to spend their
entire year’s salary to charter a Gulfstream

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.490
G550 from New York, they would just barely
make it to Utah, and yet, there’s a class

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.039
of people who use these planes to fly not
just from New York to Utah, but rather routes

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.550
like New York to Beijing.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.340
There’s a class of people who will spend
tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars on

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.290
just one single flight.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.969
Now, there are a few reasons this is strange
beyond just the sheer price of things.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:43.410
Chartering that Gulfstream from London to
Dubai, for example, you’d end up paying

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.270
about $55,000 at rack rate.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.690
Meanwhile, if you were to fly Emirates First
Class, which is just, if not more opulent,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.899
you could fly between the cities twenty times
for the same price.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.969
What’s even stranger about this kind of
expense is that businesses, which are intended

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.719
to maximize profits for their shareholders,
are able to justify this enormous expense

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:03.719
as worthwhile.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.350
So, when is it that paying $8,000 or more
an hour to fly makes money?

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.901
There’s a pretty simple way of figuring
this out.

00:01:11.901 --> 00:01:18.950
Out of the 8,760 hours in a year, the average
CEO works 2,716 of them.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.759
For a CEO that’s paid $1 million a year,
that makes an hour of their time worth $368.

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.689
Among America’s largest companies, though,
the average CEO earns $15.6 million.

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.600
That makes their hour worth $5,750.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.829
For the most part, though, private jets fly
about the same speed as commercial planes

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.350
so when flying a route like London to Dubai,
the time savings come at the airports on each

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.350
end.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.640
It comes from being able to arrive, get on
a plane, and fly—rather than having to navigate

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.689
one’s way through a busy terminal for a
fixed flight time.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.969
But still, flying private versus commercial
from London to Dubai would save, at most,

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.329
about three hours in airport time.

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.530
With the cost of $55,000 for the flight, that
would mean the CEO’s time would have to

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.840
be worth $18,300 per hour.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.340
That wouldn’t be true until they earned
$50 million a year—a salary earned only

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.550
by the upper echelon of CEO’s.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.129
But the truth is that, for the most part,
private jets do not make economic sense when

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.700
flying routes with plenty of commercial service
like London to Dubai.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.410
One of the larger corporate jet fleets out
there belongs to Walmart.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.180
Now, this might come as a surprise considering
that this is a company so focused on keeping

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.190
costs low.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.970
You see, Walmart is headquartered in Bentonville,
AR—a relatively small city of 50,000.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.530
Their airport does have a surprising amount
of service for such a small city with flights

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.140
all the way to Los Angeles and New York, largely
propped up the company’s traffic, but for

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.890
the higher ups, commercial doesn’t cut it.

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.580
That’s why the company has a fleet of 20
corporate jets—the largest of any American

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.580
company.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.250
These are most frequently flown by the company’s
Regional Vice Presidents who are in charge

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.330
of a specific area of the country and will
have to make frequent store visits within

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.340
this region.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.159
The company apparently has a goal that nobody
spends a night away from Bentonville—they

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.180
want as many trips as possible to be day trips.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.480
Now, let’s say that one of these executive
vice presidents needs to take a trip to three

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.590
stores—one in Rock Springs, Wyoming; one
in Spokane, Washington; and the last in Great

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.370
Falls, Montana.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.189
Getting to Rock Springs requires a seven hour
itinerary through Denver that would get this

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.840
executive in at 9:30 pm therefore already
requiring an overnight stop.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.090
Then, the next day, they would do their store
visit in the morning and, as there are only

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.530
two flights a day from Rock Springs, they
would have to wait until 4:50 pm to catch

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.830
a flight back to Denver then another one to
Spokane, getting in at 8:30 pm local time,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.520
therefore requiring another overnight stop.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.250
The next morning they would do their site
visit, but once again, flight schedules dictate

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.020
that the first itinerary to Great Falls would
leave at 5:05 pm through Salt Lake City, getting

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.940
in at 10:04 pm local time, thereby requiring
another overnight stop.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.269
Following the next morning’s store visit,
this executive would catch a noon flight to

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:11.790
Denver and, after a three hour layover, another
to finally get into Bentonville at 8pm.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.070
These three store visits would therefore take
up four whole working days, but what if this

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.770
executive flew private?

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:23.390
Leaving at 9am, the first flight direct to
Rock Springs would take an hour and 45 minutes

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.680
getting in, with the hour’s time change,
at 9:45 am local time.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.620
After a two hour store visit, the plane would
take off again at 11:45 am, flying an hour

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.660
and 15 minutes to Spokane, getting in at noon
local time.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.941
After another two hour store visit, the plane
would take off at 2 pm for a quick 45 minute

00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:45.010
flight to Great Falls, getting in at 3:45
pm local time.

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:49.740
After a final two hours at this store, the
plane would take off its final time at 5:45

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.270
pm bound for Bentonville.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.110
2 hours and 15 minutes of flight time later,
it would land at 9 pm local time, exactly

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:57.630
12 hours after leaving.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:02.590
What was a four day trip on commercial flights
becomes a day trip on private, and that’s

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.480
why Walmart decided private jets are worth
it for them.

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.510
It’s all about valuing the time of their
employees and they’ve determined that, even

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.730
for the relatively low level vice presidents,
their time is valuable enough that it’s

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.380
worth flying them private.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.930
For example, one of the aircraft Walmart owns
and operates is the Learjet 45.

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.410
It costs the company about $4 per mile to
operate this aircraft including crew, fuel,

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.210
insurance, maintenance, and all other variable
costs.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:35.370
Therefore, the 2,900 miles flown on that day-trip
to the north-east would cost them about $11,600.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.910
Saving three days, that places a value of
$3,900 per day which means that, assuming

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.990
the executive onboard works every single one
of the 260 workdays per year, they would have

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.750
to make almost exactly $1 million per year
for this private jet ride to be worth it to

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.910
Walmart—an amount within the realm of possibility
for upper management at such a large company.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.850
Of course, that’s not factoring in the alternative
option’s hotel, food, and airline transport

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.970
costs which would likely sum in the thousands
and it’s also assuming there’s just one

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.970
passenger.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.300
If the plane were to be filled to its maximum
capacity of nine, each passenger would only

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.370
need to be paid $111,000 per year for the
expense to be worth it to the company which

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.310
is less than an average Walmart store manager
makes.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.160
Now, there’s one other case where private
jets can make economic sense over flying commercial.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.750
Let’s say Walmart was looking to expand
into the Philippines.

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:31.500
Flying business class, it would cost a minimum
of $5,000 roundtrip per person, require three

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.660
stops, and take over 26 hours to get from
Bentonville to Manila.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:40.690
Flying private, though, a long range jet like
the Bombardier Global 7500 could make it there

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.870
non-stop, in just 15 hours, carrying 19 of
the company’s top executives.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.740
Since the company does not own this type of
jet, it would likely charter one at a cost

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.530
of about $10,000 an hour, or $150,000 for
the trip.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.840
While the cost of commercial airfare is less
than this, assuming the CEO, who makes $24

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:06.360
million a year, is onboard, the value of the
eleven hours of his time saved is worth $97,000—clearly

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.970
tilting the math in favor of the private jet.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.580
The general phenomenon of globalization has
been great for the private jet market as businesses

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.180
need to travel to far off places like this.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.530
Especially as companies outsource manufacturing
and other operations into developing countries,

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.430
which don't necessary have much air service,
many companies have determined that private

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.530
jets are the best way to get where they need
to go.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:32.830
But despite this, the private aviation industry
was hit hard but the global financial crisis

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.340
and still has not fully recovered.

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:38.990
While part of it was genuine cost cutting,
businesses also wanted to show that they were

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:43.190
doubling down on luxuries by getting rid of
their jets, even if they could make economic

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.680
sense in some cases.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.450
It was all about optics and nowadays, these
jets are coming with poorer and poorer optics,

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:51.970
for good reason.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.970
Private jets are truly horrendous for the
environment.

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:59.800
If one were to fly that Bombardier Global
7500, the one that could make it from Bentonville

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:04.800
to Manila, with just one passenger onboard,
the jet would make it only to South Dakota

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:09.190
before that passenger’s carbon footprint
exceeded that of the average person in one

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.190
year.

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.690
Increasingly, these jets are even being used
for purposes that cannot be justified economically.

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:21.330
Since 2013, there has been about a 10% increase
among Fortune 100 executives of using their

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:24.070
company’s corporate jets for personal, leisure
purposes.

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:29.000
They apparently justify this by saying that,
in case of a work emergency, they might need

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
to get back to the office quickly and commercial
air travel could hinder that.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.810
Firms that include this as a perk for their
executives, according to one set of research,

00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:42.280
under-perform against the market average in
terms of shareholder returns by about 4% each

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.280
year.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.280
Of course, the real reason some companies
might have private jets is not because it

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.490
makes economic sense, because it quite often
doesn’t.

00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:55.490
It’s because the people who decide whether
the firm will use these are the very people

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:56.720
that will use them.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.540
In many instances, the explanation is not
economic, it’s societal.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:06.370
Now, many Wendover Productions viewers are
also probably the type of person who watches

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.540
a lot of documentaries.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.760
If that’s you or if you’d like that to
be you, you should absolutely be subscribed

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.960
to CuriosityStream.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.610
That’s because they have a library of over
2,400 documentaries and non-fiction titles

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.490
that you can watch whenever, wherever.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:26.250
It’s available on the web, Apple TV, Roku,
Android, iOS, and plenty of other platforms.

00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:30.610
One series they have that I would highly recommend
is Innovation Nation with Mo Rocca who looks

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:34.300
at new inventions in each episode and explains
the stories behind them.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.560
This, and the entire rest of CuriosityStream’s
library can be accessed for just $2.99 per
