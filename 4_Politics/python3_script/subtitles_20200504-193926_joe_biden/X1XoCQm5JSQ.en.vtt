00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:06.420
If I had to judge how good technically a chef
is, I probably would ask him to do an omelet.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.380
It is difficult to make a real good omelet
and there are different types of omelets.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.849
I'm going to show you two types of omelets:
a kind of country, French omelet, which is

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.070
basically the way we do it in America, and
then a classic French omelet.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.839
One is not better than the other, it's just
a different technique, a different taste,

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:26.430
a different look that you have in it.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.119
In the first one - I'm doing an omelet with
four eggs, here - In the first one, salt,

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:42.210
a dash of pepper, all I'm going to do is to
stir it well first and cook it so that I have

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.500
fairly large curd of egg, and slightly brown
all around, reaching the look and taste that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.280
we want to do country-like.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.560
A little piece of butter there, and I have
here a beautiful pan because that pan doesn't

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.560
have any corners.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.780
You see, it has a beautiful sway.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.510
It is a non-stick pan, so it's ideal - it's
an omelet pan, actually.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.290
Now notice that my eggs, to start with, I
have no pieces of egg white hanging, so it's

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.840
not like you just stir the eggs back and forth
- you have to go from one hand to the other

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.400
to really break it so that you don't have
any long pieces of egg white, otherwise you

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.810
have those becoming white in the plate, in
the skillet as it cooks.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:32.450
So what we do here, in the country omelet,
let it brown a little bit, see the eggs - the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.300
butter here - will be brown a little bit which
in the classic omelet I don't want to brown.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.170
So clean up your pan good, and here you don't
have to worry too much.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.870
You move it occasionally, to take the large
curd like this, and those large curds replace

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.120
them by liquid.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.420
This will be totally different in the classic
French omelet, where I move the mixture very

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.620
very fast, as fast as I can, to have the smallest
possible curd.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.060
No browning at all, because the browning will
toughen the albumin, and I want something

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.240
very tender and very soft in a classic French
omelet.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.099
In the country style, it's different.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.029
Now, how long do you cook it?

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.950
It's entirely up to you.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.910
You can have it slightly wet in the center.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.120
I like it a bit wet.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.269
I would say that here my omelet is still a
little bit wet here, which is the way I like

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.730
it personally, but I would probably also brown
it just a minute also.

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.790
Then kind of fold it in half like this.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.840
I would, at that point, put maybe a little
piece of extra butter if I want, in the bottom

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.189
here to brown the bottom of my omelet.

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:48.340
And now I'm ready to invert the omelet.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.760
This way here - you change hand, you grab
the handle this way.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.489
You bang it a little bit to make it slide,
and you curl it upside down.

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.280
You have a nice beautifully browned omelet
- this is a country omelet, but you can see

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.859
fairly large curd and all this.

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.499
One way of doing it.

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:09.980
Now for the classic French omelet.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.489
The technique is different.

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.799
First, clean up your plate - your skillet,
rather.

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:16.799
Put it there.

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.540
I have a great amount of heat on that pan,
and this is what I want for an omelet.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.900
And as you see, it is a gas stove, and of
course the gas is going to be much better

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.919
than electric because you want to have the
flame to go around, and a good stove should

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.950
give you a great amount of it for an omelet
as well as a very low setting - a simmer or

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.950
something.

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.699
So here again I have four eggs, in that omelet
this time, I put a little bit of chives, truly

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:47.510
a classic omelet fines herbes - fines herbs
omelet in France, you have chives, parsley,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.739
tarragon and chervil for the classic, but
this is just a chive omelet.

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.510
So you can see here that my pan is hot but
I don't want it as hot as the other one.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.510
So again we put it in there, and now, contrary
to what I did before, just letting the eggs

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:13.730
get into large curds, here with the bowl of
the fork I want to bring this around and stir

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.910
it up as fast as I can.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.280
The smallest possible curd, and at the end
of it, about at the end of it like now, I

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.229
want to bring all of the mixture, I bring
on this side as you can see basically everything

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:33.409
is here - that is instead of having one layer
which I roll like a carpet, everything is

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:34.409
there.

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:39.980
Run my knife around, bring back the lip and
you can see here I want to have a nice, half-moon

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:41.340
shape.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.970
Run this behind to bring back that lip.

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.770
Hit it there which as you can see brings it
up, then push it down.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.319
You want a nice corner, and you don't even
want to brown it further.

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.330
This is the time, between the lips now that
you would want to stuff it, if you have some

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.410
type of stuffing.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.130
We change hand again, bring that this way.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.560
Next, bang it to have it to the edge of the
pan, then invert it to have an omelet.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:17.449
A classic omelet which should be white like
this or pale yellow, just pointed at the end

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.039
like this, smooth without any pleats.

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.849
This is what a classic French omelet is.

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.360
And you can see, quite different than that,
and as I said before, one is not really necessarily

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.810
better than the other.

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.919
It's a different technique and a different
taste.

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.840
The curd are going to be much harder here,
and if I cut this one open to show it to you,

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.289
then you will see that the center of that
omelet is very creamy and very soft and very

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.110
nice, which is the way the classic omelet
should be.
