00:00:02.201 --> 00:00:05.104
We have a very exciting
last talk coming up.

00:00:05.205 --> 00:00:08.775
Dario Gil will take us
into a quantum world.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.611
Dario is the Vice President
of Science and Solutions

00:00:11.711 --> 00:00:16.182
at IBM research, where he
leads over 1,500 engineers that

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.418
are researching in technologies
and physics, math, health

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:22.354
care, life sciences and others.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.057
And while some of
you will think,

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:26.525
a quantum world,
that's too far out,

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.694
I'm very sure Dario
will tell us otherwise.

00:00:28.794 --> 00:00:30.863
So come up here
on stage, please.

00:00:30.964 --> 00:00:32.798
Thank you.

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:34.767
Thank you.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:37.870
I was joking with
Mark that we couldn't

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.608
pick an easier topic to end
the day, on quantum computing.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.344
But I'll try to make it
entertaining, and hopefully

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:48.681
easy to understand.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.051
I'm going to start
with a reference

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:54.520
to this term of beautiful ideas.

00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:58.458
And it came from hosting
a filmmaker about a year

00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:01.961
and a half ago, in the
laboratory I just showed you.

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:05.598
At the TGA Watson Research
Center in Yorktown Heights.

00:01:05.698 --> 00:01:08.101
And he was a filmmaker
that directed

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.770
this documentary called
Particle Fever, that I don't

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.871
know if you've had
a chance to watch,

00:01:12.971 --> 00:01:15.040
but I highly recommend it.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.810
It's about the team
that was pursuing

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.345
the discovery of
the Higgs boson,

00:01:19.445 --> 00:01:22.515
in the largest physics
experiment ever conducted.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.517
And a major
character in the film

00:01:24.617 --> 00:01:27.253
is a professor from Stanford.

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.620
And at the beginning
of the film,

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:31.191
he said something that
really captivated me.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:35.461
He said, "The thing that
differentiates scientists is

00:01:35.561 --> 00:01:41.133
a purely artistic ability to
discern what is a good idea,

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:44.837
what is a beautiful idea,
what is worth spending time

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:48.774
on, and most importantly,
what is a problem that is

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:53.045
sufficiently interesting,
yet sufficiently difficult,

00:01:53.145 --> 00:01:57.617
that it hasn't yet been solved,
but the time for solving it has

00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:59.685
come now." "

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:04.090
So I want to tell you about
this beautiful idea, whose time

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.993
for solving it has come now.

00:02:07.093 --> 00:02:11.363
And that is the possibility
to create quantum computers.

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:13.366
If you look at how
we have created

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.602
the basis of the
information revolution,

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.705
and you trace it back to
other beautiful ideas,

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:21.908
like what Shannon
taught us, to think

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:23.943
about the world of
information abstractly.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:28.380
If you look at an old
punch card and DNA,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.985
we've come to appreciate that
both carry something in common.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:34.086
They carry information.

00:02:34.186 --> 00:02:37.390
And Shannon told us
that this world of bits

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.694
could be decoupled from its
physical implementation.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:43.196
That was really interesting.

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:47.133
But in fundamental
ways, it went too far.

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:50.235
Leaving too much physics out.

00:02:50.335 --> 00:02:57.110
So here is two scientists that
work at IBM Research, Charlie

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.880
Bennett on the right, continues
to work in our laboratory,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.548
And is an IBM fellow.

00:03:02.648 --> 00:03:06.652
And they asked the
question, at the time,

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:11.057
of is there a fundamental
limit to how efficient

00:03:11.157 --> 00:03:14.893
number crunching can
be, computing can be?

00:03:14.994 --> 00:03:17.730
And when they asked that
question as physicists,

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.699
they ended up with a
very surprising answer.

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.402
And they found the
answer to be no.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:25.638
It turns out, that
number crunching can be

00:03:25.738 --> 00:03:28.074
thermodynamically reversible.

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:31.444
These led to an
exploration of, what

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:34.680
is the relationship between
physics and information?

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.315
And there was a
now-famous conference

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:39.084
that was jointly organized
between IBM research and MIT

00:03:39.184 --> 00:03:42.588
at Endicott house,
where this topic was

00:03:42.688 --> 00:03:43.956
explored in more detail.

00:03:44.056 --> 00:03:48.828
And the plenary speaker was
none other than Richard Feynman.

00:03:48.928 --> 00:03:53.198
And Feynman proposed
in that conference,

00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:55.601
that if you wanted
to simulate nature,

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:59.171
we should build a
quantum computer.

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:01.640
And I'm gonna explain
you what that means,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.910
and how it's created, and the
problems that it will solve.

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.781
But first I've got to tell you,
what is a fundamental idea?

00:04:08.881 --> 00:04:10.716
The fundamental
idea, just like we

00:04:10.816 --> 00:04:12.618
have bits in the
classical world, that

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:15.488
can be a zero or a one.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:19.058
In a quantum computer,
you have qubits,

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:22.962
which stands for quantum bits.

00:04:23.062 --> 00:04:24.496
Now, the difference
is that there

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:29.568
can be a zero, a one, or
both at the same time.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.405
That exploits a principle
of quantum physics

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.239
called superposition.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.445
And it sounds weird and
crazy, but it's true.

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:44.350
Now to give you this unease that
you should feel when you talk

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.086
about quantum information,
and quantum computing,

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.555
I'm gonna give you a
very simple example.

00:04:49.655 --> 00:04:52.925
A thought experiment that
also happens to be true.

00:04:53.025 --> 00:04:56.028
So let's imagine that we're
going to solve this problem.

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:58.263
The problem involves,
you have four cards,

00:04:58.363 --> 00:05:02.034
three are identical, one is
different, one is a queen.

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:06.672
We shuffle the cards, and
we put them face down.

00:05:06.773 --> 00:05:09.308
And the problem we're
going to solve together,

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:12.077
is find the queen.

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:14.179
We're going to be
assisted by two computers.

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:18.918
One is a classical computer,
one is a quantum computer.

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:21.287
So what we do, is
we turn them down,

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:24.023
and we load them into memory.

00:05:24.123 --> 00:05:27.560
So we use four memory slots.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.995
The cards are
identical, we put zeros.

00:05:30.095 --> 00:05:32.164
The one that has a
queen, we put a one.

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.233
So in our four slots, we
will have three zeros,

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:36.201
and one is a one.

00:05:36.301 --> 00:05:38.337
We load them on
the two computers.

00:05:38.437 --> 00:05:42.741
Now we has to write a program
to find the queen, find the one.

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:45.945
How would it be
done classically?

00:05:46.045 --> 00:05:48.047
You would go and
pick a random number,

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:49.548
you don't know where it is.

00:05:49.648 --> 00:05:52.384
You go look under that memory
slot, see if it's a one,

00:05:52.484 --> 00:05:54.887
if not, you go to the next
slot, and so on, and so on.

00:05:54.987 --> 00:05:57.757
On average, it would take you
the equivalent of 2 and 1/2

00:05:57.857 --> 00:06:00.659
turns to find it.

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.362
It turns out, that with
a two-qubit quantum

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:05.898
computer for this
problem, you can always

00:06:05.998 --> 00:06:07.567
solve it in one shot.

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.473
So that uneasy feeling
that you have now,

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:19.344
should be an explanation that
quantum computer is not just

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:21.580
about building a
faster computer.

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:24.217
It is building something
that is fundamentally

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:26.352
different than a
classical computer.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:33.926
Now, a way to think about
it, an abstraction of it,

00:06:34.026 --> 00:06:36.562
is that a quantum
computer is always

00:06:36.662 --> 00:06:40.265
going to have a classical
computer next to it.

00:06:40.365 --> 00:06:42.501
They have to go together.

00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:46.372
So you have a classical
set of bits, right?

00:06:46.472 --> 00:06:48.974
The problem that you're
trying to explore.

00:06:49.074 --> 00:06:51.577
And what that quantum computer's
gonna allow you to do,

00:06:51.677 --> 00:06:54.646
is to explore these
exponential number of states.

00:06:54.746 --> 00:06:59.218
These 2 to the n, where n is a
number of qubits that you have.

00:06:59.318 --> 00:07:01.987
So now, we have relatively
small quantum computers,

00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:03.288
with few qubits.

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:05.490
But just think of the
number, that by the time

00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:09.862
you have 50 qubits, you
have 2 to the 50 states.

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:12.732
That's a phenomenally
large number.

00:07:12.832 --> 00:07:15.567
But in the end, after you
explore these number of states,

00:07:15.667 --> 00:07:18.437
you go back to a
classical output.

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:21.207
A string of zeros and
ones, that you interpret

00:07:21.307 --> 00:07:23.943
with a normal computer.

00:07:24.043 --> 00:07:25.777
So why is this interesting?

00:07:25.877 --> 00:07:27.713
And I think in this
audience, I don't

00:07:27.813 --> 00:07:31.150
need to explain in
great detail, you know,

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:33.185
what exponentials mean,
and why 2 to the 50

00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:34.920
is a very large number.

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:37.289
But it's still, I think
it's an interesting way

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:39.391
to communicate
the power of this,

00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:41.827
and I like to map
it to some problems.

00:07:41.928 --> 00:07:44.697
But I like to go after
this apocryphal story

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.832
that actually, IBM
used in the 1960s

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:49.402
to explain to people the
power of exponentials.

00:07:49.502 --> 00:07:51.770
And it had to do
with the person who

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:55.140
invented chess, that goes
to the emperor, and says,

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.276
well here's his wonderful game.

00:07:57.376 --> 00:08:00.713
And asks, what do
you want in return?

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:03.516
And the person who
invented it says,

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:05.651
give me a grain of
rice on the first day,

00:08:05.751 --> 00:08:08.153
for the first square,
and the second day

00:08:08.253 --> 00:08:09.855
you give me twice as much.

00:08:09.955 --> 00:08:14.059
And on the third square, third
day, you give me twice as much

00:08:14.159 --> 00:08:15.428
as the day before.

00:08:15.528 --> 00:08:17.997
And the emperor agrees
promptly that that

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:19.732
seems quite reasonable.

00:08:19.832 --> 00:08:24.670
And after a week you
only have 127 grains.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:27.439
After a month,
you have more rice

00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:29.908
then you'll eat in your
lifetime, for sure.

00:08:30.008 --> 00:08:33.545
But just by the time you get
to the end of the chessboard,

00:08:33.645 --> 00:08:37.516
you have more rice
than Mount Everest.

00:08:37.616 --> 00:08:42.688
So there are a large
number of problems

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:45.558
in the world that have this
characteristic, that they

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:47.926
blow up exponentially.

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:50.296
And a dirty secret in
the world of computing

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:52.665
is that we obviously talk
a lot about all the things

00:08:52.765 --> 00:08:56.268
that computers can solve, and
can solve a lot of things.

00:08:56.368 --> 00:08:58.070
But then, there's
a lot of things

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.205
that computers can not solve.

00:09:00.305 --> 00:09:05.711
And very interestingly, they
cannot solve it now, nor ever.

00:09:05.811 --> 00:09:09.414
And the reason is because they
have this exponential built

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:11.217
into them.

00:09:11.317 --> 00:09:16.988
So take as an example, this
fairly simple equation.

00:09:17.089 --> 00:09:19.191
Factoring.

00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:22.627
So if I have a number,
M, that is made out

00:09:22.728 --> 00:09:26.865
of the multiplication of
two large prime numbers.

00:09:26.965 --> 00:09:31.870
And I only give you M, and
I ask you find me p and q.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:34.873
It turns out, that that
is phenomenally difficult

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:36.241
to solve.

00:09:36.341 --> 00:09:38.077
There's no other way but to
divide it sort of sequentially,

00:09:38.177 --> 00:09:40.045
by prime numbers.

00:09:40.146 --> 00:09:42.347
So in fact, it's
so difficult, we

00:09:42.447 --> 00:09:46.185
use it as the basis
of all encryption.

00:09:46.285 --> 00:09:49.988
But, if you had a very large
universal fault-tolerant

00:09:50.088 --> 00:09:52.792
quantum computer, which
is many, many years away,

00:09:52.892 --> 00:09:55.094
you could solve that
problem in seconds,

00:09:55.194 --> 00:09:58.830
what would take billions of
years in a classical computer.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:01.767
That tells you something
about the power of what

00:10:01.867 --> 00:10:05.070
is going to be possible.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.206
Take chemistry, as a problem.

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:09.708
Because it also has
this characteristic,

00:10:09.808 --> 00:10:13.545
that it blows up exponentially,
if you try to calculate it.

00:10:13.645 --> 00:10:16.348
This equation that you see
here is very interesting,

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.585
because it's predicted
to occur at the ocean

00:10:19.685 --> 00:10:23.555
floor near volcanic
sites, and famously

00:10:23.655 --> 00:10:27.926
has been hypothesized to be the
basis of the formation of life

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:29.761
on Earth.

00:10:29.862 --> 00:10:33.365
But if you take a molecule
like iron sulfide,

00:10:33.465 --> 00:10:36.101
and you try to do relatively
simple calculations

00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:39.004
with a normal
machine, it turns out,

00:10:39.104 --> 00:10:41.907
that we're not very accurate.

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:44.510
And the reason is
that molecules form

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.847
when electron orbitals
overlap, and the calculation

00:10:47.947 --> 00:10:52.117
of each orbital requires a
quantum mechanical calculation.

00:10:52.217 --> 00:10:54.520
So for that simple
molecule, you have

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:59.058
on the order of 76 orbitals,
and two to the power of 76,

00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.726
is intractable with a classical
computer, so we can not

00:11:01.827 --> 00:11:04.129
solve it.

00:11:04.229 --> 00:11:07.466
Again, on this theme of our
assumptions that computers

00:11:07.566 --> 00:11:10.135
solve everything,
but they don't.

00:11:10.235 --> 00:11:12.571
If you look at calculating
for example, the bond

00:11:12.671 --> 00:11:15.741
length of a simple molecule
like calcium monoflouride,

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:18.411
we still get it off
by a factor of two,

00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:22.814
even using the largest
supercomputers in the world.

00:11:22.914 --> 00:11:24.517
To me, this has been
very interesting,

00:11:24.617 --> 00:11:28.287
this recognition of all these
problems we cannot solve.

00:11:28.387 --> 00:11:31.457
It's also true in
optimization problems, that

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:35.060
are the basis of
logistics and routing,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.962
and you know,
portfolio optimisation.

00:11:37.062 --> 00:11:40.465
There's tons and tons of
problems in which at best we

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:43.102
do approximations, but
we're far from optimal,

00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:45.304
because a number of
possibilities is enormous.

00:11:48.206 --> 00:11:52.044
So if there's one message I
want to be able to come across,

00:11:52.144 --> 00:11:54.413
it's that we have these
easy problems, which

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:56.915
is the world where
classical computers fit,

00:11:57.015 --> 00:11:58.984
and the problem it's solved.

00:11:59.084 --> 00:12:02.888
But then there these other
hard problems, that go outside.

00:12:02.988 --> 00:12:04.556
And if you don't
believe that p equals

00:12:04.656 --> 00:12:06.958
np, which I would say the
majority of mathematicians

00:12:07.058 --> 00:12:09.461
don't believe that that is the
case, that those problems are

00:12:09.561 --> 00:12:14.099
hard for a reason, the only
avenue to go and tackle that,

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:17.736
aside from approximations,
will be to the creation

00:12:17.836 --> 00:12:19.337
of quantum computers.

00:12:19.437 --> 00:12:22.341
So where are we?

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:24.977
We believe that small
practical quantum

00:12:25.077 --> 00:12:27.246
computers are going
to be possible,

00:12:27.346 --> 00:12:30.415
and we're building them now.

00:12:30.515 --> 00:12:33.786
It requires reinventing
the whole stack.

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:34.954
The device is different.

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:37.088
It's not the
traditional transistors.

00:12:37.188 --> 00:12:39.057
As an example,
this is the device

00:12:39.157 --> 00:12:40.759
we use for that
quantum computers

00:12:40.859 --> 00:12:45.030
that we create at IBM, based
on superconducting Josephson

00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.265
junctions.

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:48.400
And you're seeing an example
of one of these device,

00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.535
is superconducting device.

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:52.637
And because it's
superconducting,

00:12:52.737 --> 00:12:54.774
you have to cool it.

00:12:54.874 --> 00:12:58.076
So this is what a small
quantum computer looks like.

00:12:58.176 --> 00:13:00.078
What you're seeing
here is something

00:13:00.178 --> 00:13:02.280
called a dilution refrigerator.

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:05.116
And this quantum processor
sits at the bottom

00:13:05.217 --> 00:13:08.487
of this refrigerator,
at the nice temperature

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:10.822
of 15 millikelvin.

00:13:10.922 --> 00:13:13.959
So that is colder
than outer space,

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:16.995
where we have to put this
quantum processor in.

00:13:17.095 --> 00:13:20.866
This is what, for example,
a 16-qubit quantum processor

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.101
looks like.

00:13:22.201 --> 00:13:24.936
And you know, inside,
you see the square

00:13:25.036 --> 00:13:27.806
where the qubits are, and you
see these squiggly lines, which

00:13:27.906 --> 00:13:29.408
is these coupling
resonators that

00:13:29.508 --> 00:13:32.444
allow you to send information
uncoupled to the qubits,

00:13:32.544 --> 00:13:34.579
To send the information.

00:13:34.679 --> 00:13:37.282
This is what the
wiring looks like,

00:13:37.382 --> 00:13:40.585
into the refrigerator going
into a quantum processor.

00:13:40.686 --> 00:13:44.589
There's these coaxial
cables, because the way

00:13:44.689 --> 00:13:47.226
you send information
to a quantum processor,

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:51.130
is through a series of
microwave pulses, that go in,

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.833
and then you're
able to take it out.

00:13:54.933 --> 00:13:58.537
Now, if you look at pictures
of what computers were like,

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:00.538
right, in the '40s
and the '50s, it's

00:14:00.638 --> 00:14:03.241
kind of like where
we are today, right?

00:14:03.342 --> 00:14:05.210
That's what, you know,
quantum computer, that's

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:07.746
the signal processing
required to actually send

00:14:07.846 --> 00:14:09.914
all those signals down
the coaxial cables,

00:14:10.014 --> 00:14:12.517
it looks like that.

00:14:12.617 --> 00:14:14.686
But we've also seen
this movie before,

00:14:14.786 --> 00:14:17.355
in the sense that we know
how much progress we have

00:14:17.455 --> 00:14:19.291
made from those early system.

00:14:19.391 --> 00:14:22.194
And while we don't anticipate
that quantum computers will

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:27.066
be on your phone, because they
require cryogenic cooling,

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.467
we definitely
believe that access

00:14:29.567 --> 00:14:31.637
to quantum computers
in the cloud

00:14:31.737 --> 00:14:35.107
will be something that people
will be able to leverage,

00:14:35.207 --> 00:14:37.609
behind the scenes,
even not knowing.

00:14:37.709 --> 00:14:41.714
Because we believe that,
we created a small quantum

00:14:41.814 --> 00:14:45.316
computer last year, and we
made it available to the world.

00:14:45.417 --> 00:14:48.020
In something called the
IBM Quantum Experience.

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.923
And all of you can go and log
in and have access to this.

00:14:51.023 --> 00:14:51.924
It's available for free.

00:14:52.024 --> 00:14:54.059
It's a 5-qubit machine.

00:14:54.159 --> 00:14:57.095
And since we launched it,
we have over 36,000 users

00:14:57.196 --> 00:14:59.965
from over 100 countries
that have been doing it.

00:15:00.065 --> 00:15:03.602
And 15 scientific
publications have gone on it,

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:06.271
and people are learning how
to program, and to learn

00:15:06.371 --> 00:15:09.575
about this new world, and
what is being created.

00:15:09.675 --> 00:15:11.843
And you can actually
run things on this.

00:15:11.943 --> 00:15:14.779
So I was telling you about
these chemistry problems.

00:15:14.880 --> 00:15:18.617
So this is an example of
the expected theoretical

00:15:18.717 --> 00:15:21.687
calculation, and the actual
calculation, on a small quantum

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:25.424
machine, of hydrogen.
So we're starting

00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:27.292
to solve small problems.

00:15:27.392 --> 00:15:30.995
And what is coming in the years
ahead, in the next few years,

00:15:31.096 --> 00:15:34.299
will be machines that
no classical computer

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:37.101
will be able to emulate.

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:41.673
Because by the time you
have order of 50 qubits,

00:15:41.773 --> 00:15:44.676
think about that, that's
2 to the 50 states.

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:47.713
And no classical machine
will be able to emulate

00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:49.013
what that can do.

00:15:49.113 --> 00:15:50.548
And that is new territory.

00:15:50.648 --> 00:15:53.451
And that's the territory
we're all going to enter.

00:15:53.551 --> 00:15:55.621
And now is the most
interesting part,

00:15:55.721 --> 00:15:58.690
because it'll be the path of
discovery of what we can do,

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:00.959
and what value we can
create, on problems

00:16:01.059 --> 00:16:03.295
we couldn't solve before.

00:16:03.395 --> 00:16:06.665
So I'll close with
Feynman, who proposed

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:10.468
this original idea of creating
these quantum machines.

00:16:10.568 --> 00:16:13.972
In his inimitable
style, he said,

00:16:14.072 --> 00:16:16.875
"Nature isn't classical,
dammit, and if you

00:16:16.975 --> 00:16:19.177
want to make a
simulation of nature,

00:16:19.277 --> 00:16:21.513
you better make it
quantum mechanical,

00:16:21.613 --> 00:16:24.082
and by golly, it is a
wonderful problem, because it

00:16:24.182 --> 00:16:25.984
doesn't look so easy."

00:16:26.085 --> 00:16:27.886
Thank you.
