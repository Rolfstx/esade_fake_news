00:00:00.898 --> 00:00:04.070
(sirens blaring)
(creepy music)

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.090
- This week on BuzzFeed Unsolved,

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:07.170
we cover the case of the Jamison family.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.310
A case that's as odd as it is creepy.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:13.520
There's a lot of weird circumstance
that surround this one.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.957
It's the woods.

00:00:14.957 --> 00:00:15.790
- Ooh.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.330
- There's some images in
here that keep you wonderin'.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.680
- The woods are intriguing.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.100
Last time we were in the
woods was the Keddie cabins.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.000
- Yeah, I didn't like that.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.950
- I didn't care for it.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.890
- Well, let's get into it.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.070
On October 8th, 2009, the Jamison family,

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.790
comprised of Bobby Dale Jamison, age 44,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.570
Sherilyn Leighann Jamison, age 40,

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.490
and their six year-old daughter,
Madison Stormy Star Jamison

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.110
were seen for the last
time before vanishing.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.670
The family, who lived in Eufaula, Oklahoma

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.460
at the time of their disappearance

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.450
was last seen by a man
who lived in the mountains

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.350
in Southeastern Oklahoma.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.620
However, the man told
authorities that he only saw

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.490
the family and nobody else
in the area during that time.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.270
Officially, the Jamisons
were near this area

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.280
to view a 40-acre plot of land

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.920
that they were looking to purchase.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.988
Bizarrely, they planned
to live on that land

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:14.100
in a storage container
that they already owned

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.590
on their current property in Eufaula.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.020
- [Shane] I know a lot
of people who do that.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.970
Tiny houses!

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.320
You've seen the tiny houses movement?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.530
- [Ryan] I don't think they
were the tiny house type.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320
- Well, a storage container is tiny.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.300
They're going to live in it.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.470
- But you're thinking of it--
- Make it their house.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.530
- Being like decked out,
like with beautiful decor,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.429
a cool use of the space.

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:32.262
- Yeah.

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:33.380
- I think this was like, let's throw

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.270
some sleeping bags in
there kind of situation.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.103
- That's it?

00:01:36.103 --> 00:01:37.490
I'm just saying, if
it's nice enough to say,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.050
hey, we're bringing this container

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.684
all the way over from
our old plot of land,

00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:43.051
clearly there was something
about that container

00:01:43.051 --> 00:01:46.240
that was maybe luxurious
or maybe customized, or.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.073
- Okay sure, yeah.

00:01:47.073 --> 00:01:47.906
That's fair.
- Decked out.

00:01:47.906 --> 00:01:48.820
- That's fair. That's fair.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.040
I'll take it.
- Thanks.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.610
- [Ryan] On October 16th, eight days

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.880
after the Jamisons were last seen alive,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.050
the first major discovery
in the case occurred.

00:02:00.487 --> 00:02:02.961
(birds chirping)

00:02:02.961 --> 00:02:07.961
(rustling leaves)
(footsteps)

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.290
Hunters in a remote location in the woods,

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.340
about a quarter mile
away from the Jamisons'

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.050
last known location,
discovered the Jamisons' truck

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.240
abandoned and still locked.

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:25.256
(wind blowing)

00:02:37.297 --> 00:02:39.630
(footsteps)

00:02:41.642 --> 00:02:44.225
(creepy music)

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.580
Inside the truck, investigators
found Bobby's wallet,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.580
Sherilyn's purse, jackets,
a GPS, Bobby's cell phone,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.360
32 thousand dollars cash in a bank bag

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.080
stashed below the driver's seat,

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.770
and finally, the
Jamisons' pet dog, Maisie,

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.140
who was malnourished and
incredibly, still alive.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.360
Bobby's cell phone found in the truck

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.800
contained a photo of his daughter Madison,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.620
which was believed to have been taken

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.340
the day before they disappeared.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.060
One key observation was
that the truck showed

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.620
no evidence of any kind of struggle.

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.480
Former Latimer County
sheriff, Israel Beauchamp,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.310
would eventually state, quote,

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.170
I think they were forced to
stop and got out of the truck

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.992
to meet with someone they recognize.

00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:33.500
And I think they either
left willingly or by force.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.333
End quote.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.390
(gravel crunching)
(creepy music)

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:39.279
- [Shane] Signs that point to them

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:43.810
maybe leaving on their
own accord would be,

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.030
they seem, possibly,
like off-the-grid types.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.560
If they're living in a storage container--

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.020
- [Ryan] Though, if you
were leaving willingly,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.480
why wouldn't you take your dog with you?

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.450
- That's what I'm saying
is against the willingly,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.740
which would make me think
it was against their will,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.740
as if someone had them at gunpoint,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:58.900
maybe they'd leave the dog.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.050
Because you bring that dog with you,

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.030
that's very handy in a survival situation,

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.490
depending on what kind of dog it is.

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.990
- Also, at gunpoint, you're not really

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.090
in the position to make demands.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.120
You can't be like, could
I bring my dog, though.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.170
- What about Maisie?

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.560
- [Ryan] The GPS unit in the
truck indicated that the family

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.060
had been farther up a nearby
hill prior to the location

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.000
where their truck and
belongings were found.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.520
Investigators followed
the GPS coordinates,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.130
and it's there that they found footprints.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.620
One day later, on October 17th,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.970
over 300 people, including
authorities and volunteers,

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.350
formed a large-scale air
and ground search party.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.820
Unfortunately, the leads went cold,

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.860
and the search for the
Jamisons was called off.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.940
Which brings us to the case's second

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.640
major and unfortunate discovery.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.310
On November 16th, 2013--

00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:51.884
(rustling leaves)

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:54.884
(crickets chirping)

00:04:55.747 --> 00:04:58.580
(rustling leaves)

00:05:08.022 --> 00:05:10.605
(creepy music)

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.330
Hunters were out scouting
for deer hunting locations

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.527
in the deep woods, when they stumbled upon

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:22.090
the partial skeletal
remains of three bodies

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.400
of two adults and one child.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.500
The remains were discovered
less than three miles away

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.480
from where the Jamisons had disappeared

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.550
over four years earlier.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.460
The search by officials that followed

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.660
would uncover shoes, bits
of clothing, adult teeth,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:41.220
an adult arm and leg
bones, and bone fragments.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.730
The bones would eventually be confirmed

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.770
as the missing Jamison family.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.150
- I mean, they don't know
how long they were out there?

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.670
- Uh, I guess not because you would think

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.510
they would have found
it in the initial search

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.090
'cause if it was only, it was less

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.649
than three miles away from the truck.

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:59.520
- Though I've said this
before, the wilderness is big.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.740
- The wilderness is big.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:01.630
- The wilderness is big.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.250
You miss things.

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.290
- I guess, but not when
you have a starting point.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.890
A radius of five miles,
anything within that.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.900
- You think maybe they were hiding

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.410
when the search was going on?

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:11.243
- Oh, from people?

00:06:11.243 --> 00:06:13.230
- Maybe might have gone
climbed a tree or something.

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:14.480
- Why would they do that?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.250
The Oklahoman state medical
examiner, Dr. Joshua Lanter,

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.540
reported that a cause and
manner of death were unknown,

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.940
possibly due to the fact that

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:25.430
the skeletal remains weren't complete.

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.530
Lanter stated that there
was no evidence of trauma,

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.570
though it couldn't be fully ruled out

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.620
due to the incomplete remains.

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.320
Lanter could also not rule out disease.

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.080
There was also evidence of
posthumous damage by animals.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.610
Lanter's final report on the case

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.670
states the deaths occurred
under suspicious circumstances.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.040
- I mean, this is a morbid thought

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.160
but I've always thought that it would

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.550
be nice to be given back.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:51.440
- Oh, to the earth?

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.050
Like a recycling kind of thought?

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.883
- Yeah.

00:06:53.883 --> 00:06:56.140
Just have vultures pick
me apart or something.

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.390
- That's--

00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:58.380
- After I die.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.380
I don't want to be like,
oh, I'm feeling old.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.295
Let me go lay out in the sun.

00:07:02.295 --> 00:07:03.128
(Ryan laughs)

00:07:03.128 --> 00:07:05.270
- No, but what I was, when you said that

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.860
I was picturing dying and then my body

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:10.380
slowly and beautifully
decomposing into the ground.

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.260
- I want, no I want animals--
- But you were picturing--

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.371
- To be tearing my meat.

00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:15.330
(Ryan laughs)
Sort of tug of war.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.280
- You want a vulture
picking out your eyeballs?

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.510
- It's kinda neat.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.110
- [Ryan] Other items worth
mentioning from the investigation

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.800
are a missing briefcase and
a missing 22 caliber handgun

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.820
registered to Sherilyn Jamison,

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.290
both of which were never found.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.910
Let's provide some background on

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.650
the two Jamison parents,
Bobby and Sherilyn.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.040
Both Bobby and Sherilyn were not working

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.920
at the time of their
disappearance due to disabilities

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.670
and were receiving disability cheques.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:44.900
Bobby was on disability due
to being in a car accident,

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.697
though one thing worth noting
is that Sherilyn's mother,

00:07:47.697 --> 00:07:51.050
Connie Kokotan, stated
that she did not know

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.150
of any settlement from the car accident

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:56.870
that might explain the 32
thousand dollars in cash

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:58.840
found in the Jamisons' truck.

00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.520
Neither Kokotan nor anybody else

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.410
know where this money came from.

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:05.370
Former sheriff, Israel Beauchamp,

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:08.420
while on the investigation,
stated that there, quote,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.040
doesn't appear to be any
signs that the Jamisons

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.300
were in trouble or looking
to start a new life.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:15.133
End quote.

00:08:15.133 --> 00:08:17.830
One odd wrinkle to the
case was security footage

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:19.900
taken outside the Jamison home.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.070
The footage, according to Daily Mail,

00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:23.910
was from the day that they left

00:08:23.910 --> 00:08:26.664
and showed the couple
making several silent trips

00:08:26.664 --> 00:08:28.524
between the car and their home

00:08:28.524 --> 00:08:31.170
as they methodically packed to leave.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:33.110
They were moving in a
manner that Beauchamp

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.850
described as, quote, trance-like.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:39.220
On the video, sometimes they
would just stop and stare.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:41.610
- If I'm packing all my things

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.480
and I'm getting ready
to leave my life behind,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.570
go off the grid, that's a big commitment.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.403
- Yeah.

00:08:46.403 --> 00:08:47.236
Yeah.

00:08:47.236 --> 00:08:51.390
- So if I'm loading up my
car, like oh boy, this is it,

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.849
I'm probably going to
be a little trance-like.

00:08:52.849 --> 00:08:55.210
And in the middle of it, I might stop.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:56.840
- Have a couple pregnant pauses.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.860
- Look at the sunset.

00:08:57.860 --> 00:08:59.610
Think, what am I doin'?

00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:00.850
What am I doin', man?

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:04.130
- [Ryan] Beauchamp also said,
quote, normally you can go

00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.470
through an investigation and one by one,

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:08.840
start to eliminate certain scenarios.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.040
We haven't been able to
do that in this case.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:14.270
With this family,
everything seems possible.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.110
End quote.

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.630
And with that, let's
get into the theories.

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:18.970
(creepy music)
The first theory is that

00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:21.440
the family simply got lost in the woods

00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:24.070
and died from hypothermia and exposure.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.150
In the days following their disappearance,

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:28.480
the area where the Jamisons were last seen

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.780
experienced heavy rains, albeit not rains

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.820
strong enough to cause their deaths.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.430
A glance at the Farmer's
Almanac for weather reports

00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:38.785
in the area at that
time showed temperatures

00:09:38.785 --> 00:09:41.750
of merely 40 degrees at the coldest.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.580
As a reminder, the bodies were found

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.750
only 2.7 miles from their truck.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:48.578
- If you're two miles away from your car,

00:09:48.578 --> 00:09:51.820
and you go, oh it was
that way, I know that.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.220
If you pick even the
slightest wrong direction,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.070
suddenly, you're way off the mark.

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.830
- Why would they leave their cell phone,

00:09:57.830 --> 00:09:59.440
all their possessions,
things that you could use

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.870
to then get back to your car?

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.510
These do seem like people
that may be wilderness savvy.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.411
- Well, doesn't sound like it if--

00:10:05.411 --> 00:10:07.560
- No, I'm talking about it,
they're looking in that area,

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.600
if they're looking at a plot of land

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.210
to maybe live in a storage container.

00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:11.720
- But they didn't have
anything on 'em, right?

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.710
Did they have compasses,
did they have maps?

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:15.540
- No, and that to me means they didn't

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.530
intend to go on a trip.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.150
- If the little daughter
got spooked by something,

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.990
she started running, they ran after her

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.030
because obviously, holy
shit, our daughter.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.320
- How fast could a daughter run?

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.595
She's gonna run 2.7 miles
before they catch her?

00:10:26.595 --> 00:10:28.810
- I don't know, if she was
trying to get away from 'em.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:30.610
- How fast is this six year-old?

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:32.042
What is she, the fucking Flash?

00:10:32.042 --> 00:10:35.460
The second theory is
that the Jamisons' demise

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.850
was a murder-suicide scenario.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.720
The investigation would
turn up a suspicious letter

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.930
that according to one
report, was 11 pages long

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:46.910
and was found in the
Jamisons' abandoned truck.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.550
The letter is what was
called a hate letter

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.530
written from Sherilyn to Bobby

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:54.280
in which she accused
him of being a hermit.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.800
Another letter that was
said to mention death

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.880
was also found in the family home.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.400
According to former
sheriff Beauchamp, quote,

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.210
they were certainly a
family obsessed with death.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.110
End quote.

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:08.280
However, Sherilyn's mother
has repeatedly stated

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.960
that Bobby and Sherilyn were good parents.

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.660
Quote, like I've said
from the very beginning,

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:15.070
I think somebody killed them.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:17.645
There's just no way
that Bobby and Sherilyn

00:11:17.645 --> 00:11:20.153
would ever let anything happen to Madison

00:11:20.153 --> 00:11:22.760
unless something had been done to them.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.340
You have some marital
disputes, that seems minor.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.060
- [Shane] 11 pages is
a lot of pages, but--

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.250
- [Ryan] Yeah, but if the worst thing

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:30.750
you say in it is you're a hermit.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.583
- [Shane] Yeah.

00:11:31.583 --> 00:11:33.180
- Also, if you're gonna
murder somebody in the woods,

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.561
why bring your daughter with you?

00:11:34.561 --> 00:11:35.680
- Yes.

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.220
Though, if you're murdering
someone, you're probably

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.430
not in the right frame
of mind to begin with.

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:42.570
- I suppose but the mom doesn't think so.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:44.820
Also, it's noteworthy that
the mom lived with them

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.730
for a certain amount of time.

00:11:45.730 --> 00:11:46.563
- Oh, she did.

00:11:46.563 --> 00:11:49.440
- So, she would have
reference of how they behaved.

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.273
- Yeah.

00:11:50.273 --> 00:11:51.750
- [Ryan] Which brings
us to our third theory.

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:53.430
That the Jamisons were murdered

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:58.430
by Bobby Jamison's 67 year-old
father, Bob Dean Jamison.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.617
Earlier in 2009, approximately six months

00:12:01.617 --> 00:12:04.640
before the family
disappeared, Bobby had filed

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.340
a protective order against his father.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.410
Allegedly, Bob had threatened
to kill Bobby and his family

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:16.400
on two separate occasions in
November 2008 and April 2009.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.950
In the petition, Bobby did not detail

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:21.200
how his father had made the threats.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.110
He did write that Bob had,
quote, hit me with his vehicle,

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:27.920
end quote, on November 1st, 2008.

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.102
Bobby also wrote that Bob was
a, quote, very dangerous man

00:12:32.102 --> 00:12:35.450
who thinks he is above the law, end quote.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.520
And that he'd been involved with, quote,

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:41.250
prostitutes, gangs and meth, end quote.

00:12:41.250 --> 00:12:42.153
Doesn't look good.

00:12:42.153 --> 00:12:43.029
- [Shane] That's not good.

00:12:43.029 --> 00:12:43.989
- No.
- That's bad.

00:12:43.989 --> 00:12:47.790
- [Ryan] I mean that
definitely gives motive,

00:12:47.790 --> 00:12:49.860
and it does seem like--

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.466
- [Shane] Seems like the kind
of guy who might do that,

00:12:51.466 --> 00:12:53.080
on account of he threatened to murder--

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.550
- [Ryan] Yeah, it does seem
like this wasn't a case like,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:56.900
oh, I couldn't see this coming.

00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.480
It was, many warnings were given.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.948
Furthermore, Bobby stated
in his petition, quote,

00:13:02.948 --> 00:13:06.610
my entire family is severely
scared for their lives.

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:07.500
End quote.

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.450
And quote, I am in fear
at all times, end quote.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:14.700
Testimonies were given in the
case and a judge dismissed

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:18.170
the protective order on May 18th, 2009.

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:20.680
Bobby Jamison was also in the process

00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:22.480
of suing his father at the time

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.487
of the Jamison family's disappearance.

00:13:24.487 --> 00:13:27.500
The gist of the suit was
that Bobby would sometimes

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.130
work for free at his father's gas station,

00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.100
where half the sales had
been promised to Bobby,

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.450
but were never paid.

00:13:34.450 --> 00:13:37.450
Though, Bobby and Sherilyn
had been described as,

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:41.360
quote, scammers, end quote,
by former sheriff Beauchamp.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.380
As they had also previously sued

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.750
three others in 2005 after a car accident.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:51.750
Moreover Jack Jamison, Bob
Dean's brother and Bobby's uncle,

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:54.913
claimed that Bob Dean was,
quote, disturbed at the time,

00:13:54.913 --> 00:13:57.085
end quote, Jack was, quote, pretty sure

00:13:57.085 --> 00:14:01.320
he was not capable of being
involved in that, end quote.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.040
- [Shane] You wish these stories had

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:04.800
a black and white to 'em.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.633
- [Ryan] Yeah, right?

00:14:05.633 --> 00:14:07.670
Every time you think this
is clear-cut, now this--

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:09.420
- [Shane] You got this poor family,

00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:11.900
they turn up in the woods.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.660
You feel for 'em.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.900
Now suddenly they're casting
doubt upon their characters

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:18.920
because they're, what, they're scammers?

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:19.890
- Apparently--
- They're scammers!

00:14:19.890 --> 00:14:21.040
- [Ryan] According to the sheriff.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.260
That's his opinion.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.740
- And now we can't even trust the sheriff

00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:25.400
because you're casting doubt on him.

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.233
- Well, I don't know.

00:14:26.233 --> 00:14:29.160
I mean, he seems like a
legitimate investigator.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.000
He doesn't have any motive
in this to have a cover-up.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.218
- I hate these stories, Ryan.

00:14:34.218 --> 00:14:35.262
(Ryan laughs)

00:14:35.262 --> 00:14:36.095
- I know.

00:14:36.095 --> 00:14:38.930
Bob Dean died in December 2009.

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:41.300
Jack Jamison, like Sherilyn's mother,

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.840
still suspects that
foul play played a part

00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.070
in the Jamison family's death.

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:49.320
This brings us to our
bizarre fourth theory,

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.676
that the Jamisons were murdered by a cult.

00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:52.030
(creepy music)

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.287
Sherilyn's mother, Connie Kokotan,

00:14:54.287 --> 00:14:55.120
believes the Jamisons were killed

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.720
by a religious cult in
Southeastern Oklahoma.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.680
According to Kokotan,
the cult had a, quote,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.880
hit list, end quote, that Sherilyn was on.

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:08.550
After Investigation
Discovery aired a special

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:11.562
on the Jamison family
on the show Disappeared,

00:15:11.562 --> 00:15:14.020
Sherilyn's close friend, Niki Shenold,

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.264
said she received a phone
call from an anonymous woman.

00:15:15.264 --> 00:15:17.140
(phone dialing)

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.780
This woman reportedly told Shenold

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:22.050
that she'd once been in
a white supremacy group

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.590
that kept a book
containing a list of people

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.390
who'd been problems for them.

00:15:26.390 --> 00:15:29.450
Sometimes, this woman
claimed, if she could remember

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.180
one of the names she had seen,

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.890
she'd go home and look
it up on the Internet.

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:37.530
This had led her to multiple
missing persons cases

00:15:37.530 --> 00:15:40.850
including Sherilyn and Bobby Jamison.

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.777
Shenold said she wasn't sure
what to make of the caller.

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.150
- Cults, I don't know.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:46.950
Cults, cults are out there.

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:49.540
I wouldn't initially
just refute it outright.

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:52.010
- No, it just sounds outrageous,

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:55.520
given everything else and this
seems very par for the course

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:57.110
when it comes to cold cases, right?

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:57.943
- Yeah.

00:15:57.943 --> 00:15:59.157
- And then all of a
sudden, here's this cult.

00:15:59.157 --> 00:16:03.730
A 1993 article in the Oklahoman
stated that a few cults

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:06.217
had sprung up around Eastern Oklahoma,

00:16:06.217 --> 00:16:10.830
though a US marshal named
James Webb had added, quote,

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:14.260
there hasn't been any
activity in a couple of years.

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:15.093
End quote.

00:16:15.093 --> 00:16:16.900
It's also been suggested that

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:18.870
the Jamisons were into witchcraft.

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:19.703
(whispering)

00:16:19.703 --> 00:16:21.980
A quote, witch bible, end quote,

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.253
was reportedly found in the Jamison home.

00:16:24.253 --> 00:16:26.651
(creepy music)

00:16:26.651 --> 00:16:29.484
(papers rustling)

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.690
Though, Niki Shenold claims
that Sherilyn Jamison

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.230
bought the witch bible as a joke.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.220
That being said, their pastor in Eufaula,

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.613
Gary Brandon, claims Bobby confessed

00:16:41.613 --> 00:16:46.100
that he was reading a, quote,
Satanic bible, end quote.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:48.610
Additionally, mysterious
graffiti was found

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:50.100
on the large storage container

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:51.850
kept on the Jamisons' property.

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:54.020
One line read, quote, three cats killed

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.030
to date by people in this area.

00:16:56.030 --> 00:16:58.330
Witches don't like their black cat killed.

00:16:58.330 --> 00:16:59.163
End quote.

00:16:59.163 --> 00:17:01.250
There was a witch bible
found in their house.

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:03.180
Which was written off as a joke, sure.

00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:04.025
But then--

00:17:04.025 --> 00:17:05.150
- [Shane] Funny, funny joke.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.684
- But the husband--
- Ha ha, look at this.

00:17:06.684 --> 00:17:07.580
(laughing)

00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:08.413
A witch bible!

00:17:08.413 --> 00:17:09.450
- [Ryan] But then the husband himself

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:11.460
has admitted he was
reading a Satanic bible,

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:12.899
so obviously it was not a joke.

00:17:12.899 --> 00:17:15.076
- Maybe she brought the witch bible home

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:16.510
and then was like, ha ha!

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:17.840
Witch bible!

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.420
Witch bible, waka waka.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:22.840
And then he was like, ah,
pretty good joke, honey.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:23.930
I'm gonna read that.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.860
- Oh, and then late at
night, when she's sleeping

00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:27.216
he puts on his little--
- And she was like,

00:17:27.216 --> 00:17:28.060
what are you reading?

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:29.400
And he was like, ah!

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.308
Funny book.

00:17:30.308 --> 00:17:32.280
- [Ryan] Sherilyn's mother also reported

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.140
some odd behavior from her daughter.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.580
Quote, she became very illogical.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.770
One day she drove me to Oklahoma City

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:41.810
and dropped me off on the street.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:45.470
She told me, get (beat) out of my car.

00:17:45.470 --> 00:17:47.160
So, I did.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.360
End quote.

00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:50.480
- [Shane] Get (beat) out of my car.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.510
- [Ryan] Yeah, that was
like the T-1000 right there.

00:17:52.510 --> 00:17:53.388
- Get out.

00:17:53.388 --> 00:17:54.221
(Ryan laughs)

00:17:54.221 --> 00:17:55.120
You don't do that to your mother.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.290
- No, I mean and that
could be other factors,

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:59.883
but could it also be because
she was maybe in a daze?

00:17:59.883 --> 00:18:00.716
- Yeah.

00:18:00.716 --> 00:18:02.410
- Your head gets kind of lost in a fog

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:03.990
when you're involved in some
shady business, I suppose.

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:04.823
- Yeah.

00:18:04.823 --> 00:18:06.980
- Also, my mom was the kind of mom who,

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.460
if I said that to her,
first she'd smack me.

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.770
And secondly, I'd have to get out, so.

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.250
- Yeah my mom once stopped the car

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:14.726
and told me and my brother to get out.

00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:15.830
- Oh, shit.
- We said no!

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.680
We're just kidding.

00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.620
We're not fighting.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.400
- What did you do to prompt that response?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.630
- I think we were just
fuckin' hitting each other

00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:24.060
in the backseat or something.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:24.893
- Yeah.

00:18:24.893 --> 00:18:26.820
- You know, classic brother stuff.

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:28.820
- [Ryan] And of course, the main evidence

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:32.040
of strange behavior was the
aforementioned security tape

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.720
where the two Jamison
parents appear to be in a,

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.540
quote, trance-like state, end quote.

00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.830
The Jamisons also reportedly claimed

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:42.033
to have two to four ghosts in their home.

00:18:42.033 --> 00:18:44.616
(creepy music)

00:18:51.816 --> 00:18:54.316
(tap running)

00:18:56.023 --> 00:18:59.625
(electricity shorting out)

00:18:59.625 --> 00:19:02.208
(creepy music)

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:12.010
Father Gary Brandon
even told investigators

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.070
that Bobby Jamison had once called him

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:17.212
asking about, quote,
special bullets, end quote,

00:19:17.212 --> 00:19:20.410
that could be used to shoot spirits.

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.857
- You're not related
to this guy in any way?

00:19:21.857 --> 00:19:22.690
(Ryan laughs)

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:23.544
You looked that up?

00:19:23.544 --> 00:19:24.730
- (laughing) No.

00:19:24.730 --> 00:19:25.563
No.

00:19:25.563 --> 00:19:28.100
But I thought, I don't
know if that belongs

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.380
in the cult theory, maybe
they're in a religious cult

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.150
where they believe that sort of thing.

00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:32.983
- Doesn't matter.

00:19:32.983 --> 00:19:33.830
I'm glad you included it.

00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:35.940
- It does contribute to odd behavior and,

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.880
for the record, I don't
believe in special bullets.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.160
Which brings us to our
fifth and final theory,

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.710
that drugs were involved.

00:19:43.710 --> 00:19:45.800
All of the aforementioned strange behavior

00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:47.883
from the Jamison parents
could be explained

00:19:47.883 --> 00:19:50.200
by the influence of drugs.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.700
There were actually rumors
that the Jamison parents

00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.002
were involved with drugs, and some believe

00:19:55.002 --> 00:19:58.610
that the family was involved
in a drug deal gone awry.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.934
As reported by the Oklahoman in May 2010,

00:20:01.934 --> 00:20:05.460
Sherilyn's mother, who didn't
believe drugs were involved,

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.240
said the couple had been
in financial straits.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.410
Pure speculation here, but
maybe the 32 thousand dollars

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.920
in cash had something to
do with the possible deal,

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:19.370
as it makes no sense how
the Jamisons had that money,

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:22.240
let alone in the car
they disappeared from.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.984
- People didn't know
where the money came from.

00:20:23.984 --> 00:20:24.817
- Mm hm.

00:20:24.817 --> 00:20:26.850
- If they were making
money off of some kind of--

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.200
- It would be off the grid.
- Drug situation.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.753
It would be, they're not keeping,

00:20:29.753 --> 00:20:31.180
they're not taking it to the bank

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.370
and saying, this is from
the meth that I just sold.

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.010
- They're not reporting that to the IRS.

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:35.843
- Right.

00:20:35.843 --> 00:20:37.369
- [Ryan] Police initially suspected drugs

00:20:37.369 --> 00:20:40.000
after viewing the
strange security footage,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.771
but former sheriff Beauchamp
said there was no evidence

00:20:42.771 --> 00:20:47.400
backing up the theory that the
Jamisons used or dealt drugs.

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:50.320
Yet, he also stated he could not rule out

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.530
the possibility that drugs could have been

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:55.130
somehow involved in the disappearance.

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.795
To be fair, many have
pointed out that the Jamisons

00:20:57.795 --> 00:21:00.882
likely would not have taken
6 year-old Madison with them

00:21:00.882 --> 00:21:04.740
if some kind of drug related
event was taking place.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:05.573
That's fair.

00:21:05.573 --> 00:21:06.420
- [Shane] That's fair!

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.750
- [Ryan] I mean, why would you take

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:09.340
your daughter to a drug deal?

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:11.480
- [Shane] Don't do drugs,
don't do drug deals.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.680
Don't take your children
to any of the drugs

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.690
or the drug deals.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.700
- Every time in this case
I think I've come to some

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:20.960
kind of logical conclusion,
I'm sadly mistaken.

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.870
- Would it be easy though
for them to cover up

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:26.810
the evidence of their
involvement with drugs?

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:30.210
What if they were going to,
perhaps, buy some drugs?

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:32.350
In that case, someone
shows up who's allegedly

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.570
going to give them drugs.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:34.800
They've got the money that they're going

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.900
to give to that person.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.674
Though I don't know why that
person didn't take the money.

00:21:37.674 --> 00:21:39.550
- Oh, and there's our
daughter in the backseat.

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.650
- Maybe the person was
like, I'm not doing this.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:43.120
Not with her around.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.320
- So, instead I'm going
to kill all three of you

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:46.153
and leave the money?

00:21:46.153 --> 00:21:47.180
- Maybe just chased 'em.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:50.380
- But I can't wrap my head
around the cash being left there

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:51.510
and then the daughter being there.

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:52.740
That doesn't make any sense.

00:21:52.740 --> 00:21:55.100
- Maybe the person didn't
know the cash was there.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.220
- But they're going to a drug deal,

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.140
of course they would
know the cash is there.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.350
- Maybe they tried
giving them the briefcase

00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:03.380
and they didn't realize they
didn't put the cash in it,

00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:06.880
they hand it over, the guy opens it up

00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:08.670
and he's like, where's the cash?

00:22:08.670 --> 00:22:10.270
And they go, yipes!

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.630
And they run into the woods.

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:13.540
- And then he goes, no
need to check the car.

00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:15.320
- It's like I said, there's
a scary dog in there.

00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.860
- [Ryan] Former sheriff Beauchamp has said

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:19.320
that there were no suspects in the case.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.354
While investigating the disappearance,

00:22:21.354 --> 00:22:23.131
Beauchamp was quoted as saying, quote,

00:22:23.131 --> 00:22:25.167
a lot of investigators would love to have

00:22:25.167 --> 00:22:27.370
as many leads as we do.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.290
The problem is that they point

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.280
in so many different directions.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.490
End quote.

00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:35.310
Perhaps one day, those leads will point

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.210
in one clear direction.

00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:40.950
But for now, the case remains unsolved.
