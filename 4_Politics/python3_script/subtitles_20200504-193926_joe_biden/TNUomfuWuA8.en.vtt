00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.190
17 years ago, an aviation frontier was broken.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.779
Just before noon on March 1, 2001 a Continental
Airlines 777 lifted off from frosty Newark

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.490
Airport across the river from New York City.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.789
It tracked north over the US, then Canada,
then just kept flying north until north became

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.789
south.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.500
It flew south over Russia, then Mongolia,
then mainland China before setting down at

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.410
Chek Lap Kok Airport in Hong Kong after 16
hours.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.250
With that, there was a new longest flight
in the world.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.470
The two cities had never before been connected
by non-stop commercial flights.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:45.190
This was at the time a momentous achievement—all
the business travelers making frequent trips

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.890
between the two financial centers badly wanted
this quicker flight—but you may be surprised

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.020
that such a flight was an achievement so recently.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.590
Nowadays, non-stop New York to Hong Kong flights
are far from exceptional.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.320
Five planes carrying more than 1,000 passengers
total fly non-stop daily between the two cities

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.740
and nowadays, this route doesn’t even crack
the list of the top 20 longest flights in

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.920
the world.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.620
Especially in the past three years, there’s
been a noticeable and dramatic rise in the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.150
number of ultra-long haul flights.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.560
Among the ten longest non-stop flights, the
one on this list that’s existed the longest,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.040
since 2009, is Delta’s daily service from
Johannesburg to Atlanta—the only flight

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.980
by an American airline to South Africa.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.830
In 2016 United started non-stop flights between
San Francisco and Singapore—ending an era

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.290
during which there were no non-stop connections
between the two countries.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.730
Just recently in October, 2018 Philippine
Airlines began flying from Manila to New York

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.810
non-stop on their new a350.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.470
In 2014, Qantas starting flying non-stop in
both directions from Sydney to Dallas—then

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.350
the longest flight in the world.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.770
In early 2018 United added another connection
to down under with their route from Houston

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.780
to Sydney.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.590
Singapore Airlines added another US connection
in November 2018 flying to Los Angeles and

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.800
Emirates has operated the longest nonstop
a380 flight in the world from Dubai to Auckland

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.470
since 2016.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.230
Qantas started the first and currently only
non-stop connection between Australia and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.049
Europe in March, 2018 with their daily dreamliner
service from Perth to London and Qatar operates

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:15.409
what was until recently the longest non-stop
flight from Doha all the way to Auckland.

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.329
Lastly, the longest flight in the world, confidently
beating the runner up by over 500 miles, is

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.250
the newly launched daily Singapore Airlines
flight between Singapore and Newark clocking

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.239
in at 9,534 miles and up to 19 hours of flight
time depending on winds.

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.819
Eight of the ten flights on this list were
launched in the past three years.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.360
While it can be expected that as technology
advances airplane range will get longer, there’s

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.769
been a noticeable acceleration in the addition
of non-stop routes between earth’s furthest

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:43.829
city pairs.

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.020
Like any phenomenon, this has causes and effects.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.890
One factor driving this surge in ultra-long
haul flights is the release of two new planes

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.590
in the past decade—the a350 and 787.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.840
Six of the ten longest routes are flown by
one of these two planes.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.809
Now, planes have existed before that could
fly the routes these fly but they weren’t

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:03.049
as economical.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.450
Singapore Airlines previously flew the world’s
longest flight from Singapore to Newark from

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.950
2004 until 2014 on the a340 but its high fuel
consumption forced them to cancel the route

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:14.220
as soon as oil prices ticked up.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.980
To fly fewer passengers a shorter maximum
distance, an a340 uses 35% more fuel than

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.019
the a350.

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.390
Economics is everything with the world’s
longest routes.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.629
The truth is that flying a non-stop flight
from Singapore to New York uses more fuel

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.499
than flying a stopping service from Singapore
to Tokyo to New York.

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:36.709
Now, this might seem counterintuitive since
planes use far more fuel per minute taking

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.420
off than they do in cruise and flying nonstop
requires one take off instead of two but that's

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.699
failing to consider that it uses fuel to carry
fuel.

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:50.430
With a 777-200, for example, flying 800 nautical
miles will use about 30.6 pounds of fuel per

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.430
mile.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.049
That pounds per mile average decreases up
until reaching a total flight distance of

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.309
about 3,000 nautical miles.

00:03:57.309 --> 00:04:02.540
Beyond that, the pound per mile figure increases
up until 8,000 nautical miles where the aircraft

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.099
would burn 32.2 pounds of fuel per mile flown.

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.231
This is because eventually, the added burn
from flying the extra fuel needed to fly long

00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:13.870
distance overtakes the extra fuel used to
take off.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.109
That means that, with this aircraft, which
is used to fly the daily 8,000 mile Qatar

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.490
flight between Doha and Houston, it would
be more efficient on a fuel consumption basis

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.930
to fly something like Doha to Paris, Paris
to Halifax, and Halifax to Houston rather

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.120
than flying the whole trip in one go.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.419
This is part of the reason why cargo airlines
rarely fly ultra-long haul routes.

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.080
While UPS has plenty enough cargo to support
a non-stop flight between their Louisville

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.949
and Hong Kong hubs and the aircraft that could
fly it in one go, they fly the route with

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.980
a stop in Anchorage partially for fuel saving
reasons.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.020
Of course, any time on the ground is time
that an aircraft could be in the air making

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.650
money so that degrades the savings and that’s
part of why cargo airlines don’t only fly

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.590
in 3,000 mile hops.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:59.180
Time matters for cargo airlines but not nearly
as much as it does for passenger airlines.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.530
Passenger airlines have to deal with people
which are far more sensitive to a few extra

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.139
hours of travel time than boxes.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.520
Non-stop flights are typically more desirable
especially to the business traveller which

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.830
is why airlines will price connecting itineraries
typically higher than non-stop ones even on

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.880
short routes where the cost to the airline
of operating a connecting itinerary is higher

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.780
than that of a non-stop flight.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.169
With higher costs, airlines therefore need
to justify operating non-stop flights instead

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.340
of stopping ones.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.510
Singapore airlines does operate another flight
to New York via Frankfurt with a far larger

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.650
a380 but the non-stop flight is primarily
operated to appeal to the business traveller

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.039
who can pay more.

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:37.670
Often, the routes with enough demand to support
ultra long-haul flights are the ones with

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.650
high business traffic between big, wealthy
cities like Sydney, Singapore, Hong Kong,

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.160
London, and New York.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.260
Even though Hawaii, for example, is one of
the top vacation destinations in the world,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.879
you just don’t see many long-haul flights
to it from places like London because leisure

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.169
travelers are more sensitive to price and
they’d rather pay less to fly via Los Angeles

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.669
rather than on a non-stop from London for
more.

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.860
For this reason, on the a350’s Singapore
Airlines uses to fly to Newark, they didn’t

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.470
even bother including an economy class, the
kind that leisure travelers tend to book.

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.400
They only have premium economy and business
class.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.409
With the lower weight from fewer bags, seats,
and passengers the plane can fly more efficiently

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.120
to the other side of the world and, from the
airlines perspective, they’re not loosing

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.990
out on much since, at the prices they would
have to sell economy seats at to be competitive,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.669
they really wouldn’t be making much money
anyways.

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.729
The higher margins of premium classes give
them a better shot of breaking even on this

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:27.729
flight.

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:30.590
Of course, the other factor contributing to
the rise of these ultra-long haul flights

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.379
is the low cost of fuel.

00:06:32.379 --> 00:06:37.750
Jet fuel prices halved in 2015 and bottomed
out at a cost of only 85 cents per gallon

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.850
in January 2016.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:43.300
Since then prices have steadily risen leading
some to question whether troubled times were

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.270
ahead for the industry but prices again took
a dive in October 2018.

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.400
Overall, over the past four years, prices
are lower than ever and with that fuel represents

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.620
a smaller proportion of an airline’s cost
so it’s proportionally cheaper to fly longer

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.620
distances.

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:02.190
This fluctuation in fuel cost has also contributed
to the rise, and in some cases fall, of long

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:06.159
haul budget airlines such as Norwegian Airlines,
Wow Air, and Primera Air.

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:10.789
So we’ve established the causes of this
proliferation of ultra-long flights but what

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:12.349
are its effects?

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:16.009
One of the busiest long distance flows of
passengers is from Europe to Australia and

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:17.759
New Zealand and vice versa.

00:07:17.759 --> 00:07:21.620
As two areas with close cultural and business
connections plenty of people travel between

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.349
them despite it taking about 24 hours each
way.

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:29.249
Before the turn of the century almost every
major European Airline flew to Australia via

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:34.740
some stopping point like Bangkok, Singapore,
or Hong Kong including Air France, KLM, Lufthansa,

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.330
Alitalia, and British Airways—some with
multiple daily flights.

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:42.680
Today, though, there is only one sole flight
by a European Airlines to Australia—British

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.069
Airways’ once daily flight from London to
Singapore to Sydney.

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:50.400
Meanwhile, Qantas is the only Australian Airline
and Air New Zealand the only Kiwi airline

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.699
to operate services all the way to Europe.

00:07:52.699 --> 00:07:57.540
All the airlines on each end have lost market
share to those in between—the Asian airlines.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.169
In the past few decades airlines like Emirates
and Singapore Airlines have become the most

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:05.129
popular for those traveling between the two
areas as, if you were to fly British Airways

00:08:05.129 --> 00:08:07.810
you would have to start in Sydney and end
in London.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.919
Flying on Emirates, on the other hand, you
can start at any of their six non-stop destinations

00:08:11.919 --> 00:08:16.199
in Australia and New Zealand, connect via
Dubai, and end up at any of their dozens of

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:18.919
European destinations with one stop.

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:23.400
It’s just faster and often cheaper and so,
while British Airways operates seven weekly

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:28.910
flights to Australia, Emirates operates 84
and Singapore 137.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:32.570
Both of these airlines and more including
Cathay Pacific, Etihad, and Qatar Airways

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.970
have become experts in operating connecting
flights between Europe and Australasia.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:40.530
But the reason they’re able to do this is
because you have to stop on these routes anyways—it’s

00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:42.160
too far for non-stop flights.

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.100
Or rather, it used to be.

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:48.770
Since March, 2018, number three on that list
of longest flights is Qantas’ new non-stop

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:50.330
flight from Perth to London.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:53.700
Many were skeptical when this flight launched
that customers would prefer it to a one-stop

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.960
option where they could pay less and stretch
their legs halfway through their trip but

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.870
the data proves otherwise.

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.870
Since launch, 92% of available seats on this
route have been sold.

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:07.200
This is an exceptionally good load factor,
as its called, as Qantas’ average load factor

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.200
for international flights is only 84%.

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.140
For this reason Qantas is strongly considering
launching other non-stop European routes from

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.140
Perth to Paris and Frankfurt.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.780
In addition, other airlines are looking at
starting new non-stop routes from Europe to

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:20.780
Australia.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:24.390
Founder Richard Branson has said that Virgin
Atlantic is looking to start non-stop flights

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:26.790
from London to Perth, “as soon as possible.”

00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:31.061
Turkish Airlines, based in Istanbul, is technically
still a European Airline, even if it’s just

00:09:31.061 --> 00:09:35.180
miles from the border with Asia, and it’s
set to become to first airline to start flying

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.200
non-stop from Europe to Sydney if it follows
through with its announced plans to launch

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.140
these flights in 2019 with its new 787 dreamliners.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.920
While the once daily Qantas flight is doing
little to cut into the Asian carrier’s profits

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.330
right now, if more and more flights start
bypassing the Asian hubs, the major connecting

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.390
airlines could be given a run for their money.

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:56.380
Meanwhile, the race is on to see who will
start flying what is perhaps the most valuable

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:00.890
route in the world that doesn’t yet have
a non-stop connection—Sydney to London.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:03.040
Chance are the first will be Qantas.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.020
A number of years ago, Qantas challenged aircraft
manufacturers Boeing and Airbus to create

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:11.640
a plane that could fly the 21 hour non-stop
flight fully loaded all the way to London.

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.380
The manufacturers are close to delivering
and Qantas has said they will make their decision

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:21.270
between the Airbus a350-1000ULR or Boeing
777-8 by the end of 2019.

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.840
From there, flights would start in 2022 or
2023 not only on the Sydney to London route,

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.660
but also potentially from Melbourne and Brisbane
and to New York and Paris.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:33.970
Being the airline of choice for Australians,
perhaps no airline globally has a better shot

00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.890
at making a 21 hour non-stop flight work than
Qantas.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.720
With the arrival of the newest set of planes,
airlines can now fly as far as 11,000 miles

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.780
non-stop.

00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:48.650
That means that nearly every populated point
on earth can feasibly be connected by non-stop

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:49.650
flights.

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.110
With more technological advancements on their
way, absolutely every point on earth will

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.080
soon be reachable non-stop.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.750
What that means is that the only factors now
restricting the development of ultra-long

00:10:58.750 --> 00:11:01.660
haul flights are economic, not technological.

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:05.810
In many ways, the question of whether this
trend of the proliferation of ultra-long hauls

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.830
is up to the mercy of fuel prices.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.700
If they stay low, we’ll have more and more
18, 19, or 20 hour flights while if they go

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.700
up, you can be sure that airlines will cancel
these routes in droves.

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:19.680
While the planes are not flying any faster,
they’re getting passengers to their destination

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.600
in less time so these new non-stop routes
to the other side of the world are helping

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:27.880
to make the world just a little bit smaller,
one flight at a time.

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:31.070
If you have an idea for a business, whether
it just be just you as a freelancer or the

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:35.480
next Fortune 500 company, one of the first
steps in making an idea reality is setting

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.480
up a website.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.370
No matter what you do, it’s crucial in this
century to have a website and Squarespace

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:44.350
helps you set up a site in as little as minutes
for a reasonable monthly price.

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.040
Their website builder is simple to use and
the customizable designer templates make it

00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.920
nearly impossible to create a bad-looking
website.

00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:55.840

24/7 customer support in case you need help.

Also, on my other channel, Half as Interesting,
I just released a video on the longest duration

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:20.190
non-stop flight to ever exist—the 32 hour
flight Qantas flew from Perth to Sri Lanka

00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:23.120
during WWII in order to reconnect the empire.

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:26.360
Click the annotation on-screen to check that
out and I’ll see you again in two weeks

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.790
with another Wendover Productions video.
