00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.101
Hillary, I have to ask you a
question

00:00:02.134 --> 00:00:04.637
that is--
been plaguing me for a while.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.640
How did you kill
Jeffrey Epstein?

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:09.042
(laughs)

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:11.644
Because you-you...

00:00:11.677 --> 00:00:14.313
-(applause)
-You're not in power,

00:00:14.346 --> 00:00:16.149
but you have all the power.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.550
(laughs)

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:21.487
I-I really need to understand
how you do what you do.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.291
Because you seem to be behind
everything nefarious,

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:29.295
and yet you do not use it
to become president.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.697
-What is the game plan?
-(laughs)

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.700
-Well, Trevor...
-(laughter)

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.102
What is-- What--
But, honestly, though,

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:39.772
what does it feel like being
the boogeyman of the right?

00:00:39.805 --> 00:00:41.107
(stammers)
Well...

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.444
(stammers) It's-it's
a constant surprise to me,

00:00:44.477 --> 00:00:47.280
um, because the things
they say--

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.415
and now, of course,
it's on steroids,

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:51.217
with, uh, being online--

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.219
uh, are so ridiculous,

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:56.889
uh, beyond any imagination
that I could have,

00:00:56.922 --> 00:00:59.225
and yet they are so persistent

00:00:59.258 --> 00:01:03.196
in putting forth these crazy,
uh, ideas and theories.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.033
Honestly, I don't know what
I ever did to get them so upset.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.903
Uh, but a lot of them live

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:14.407
to come up
with these conspiracy,

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.009
uh, theories, and, you know,

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:18.344
I've gotten kind of used to it.

00:01:18.377 --> 00:01:19.946
It's been going on
for a number of years.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.548
Have you-- have you ever thought
of just, like, meeting someone

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.117
who says, like,
"Hillary, you did this,"

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.318
and just looking at them
and being, like,

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.520
-"Yes, I did"?
-(laughs)

00:01:27.553 --> 00:01:29.856
-I mean, there-there must be
a little... -At some point.

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.357
-Right, at some point.
-Yeah, at some point.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.493
It-it becomes so ludicrous
and it becomes so extreme.

00:01:33.526 --> 00:01:35.828
Well, I've had-- I've had--
I've had encounters like that,

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:39.031
-and-and many of my friends have
had because they've... -Wow.

00:01:39.064 --> 00:01:41.567
Yeah. They've called up people
to urge them to,

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.636
like, vote for me
or they've knocked on a door,

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:46.305
and somebody will say, "Oh,
I couldn't do that because..."

00:01:46.338 --> 00:01:48.841
And then they launch into one
of their big conspiracies.

00:01:48.874 --> 00:01:51.344
And I had one friend,
one very dear friend,

00:01:51.377 --> 00:01:53.146
who I literally have known
my entire life,

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.815
and she said she listened
to this ridiculous,

00:01:55.848 --> 00:01:58.050
uh, conspiracy about me.
And she said,

00:01:58.083 --> 00:02:01.320
"You know, I've known her
since we were in sixth grade,

00:02:01.353 --> 00:02:02.788
and none of that is true."

00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:04.390
And this man looked at her
and said,

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:07.393
"But I saw it on the Internet."

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:09.662
But I also think
it's because it is effective.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:11.330
Like, I'll never forget
reading an article

00:02:11.363 --> 00:02:15.401
after the 2016 election
where the reporter interviewed

00:02:15.434 --> 00:02:18.337
someone who had been
an undecided voter.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.672
And he said, you know,
he thought

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.073
my mom had won
all three debates.

00:02:21.106 --> 00:02:23.910
She clearly had a greater
command of the subject matter.

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:26.846
And yet he just kept reading

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.315
that she had murdered
more than 50 people.

00:02:29.348 --> 00:02:31.817
And he said,
somewhat nonchalantly, like,

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.986
"I don't think
that she murdered 50.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.722
-But, like, what if
she murdered two?" -(laughs)

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:40.226
And so you just think-- it's
this, like, constant erosion

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:42.828
-of-of truth and sanity.
-Right.

00:02:42.861 --> 00:02:44.230
But my favorite--

00:02:44.263 --> 00:02:46.699
and the one that I do
secretly hope might be true--

00:02:46.732 --> 00:02:50.036
is that my mother apparently
adopted an alien in 1993.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.205
-(laughs) -And I've
always wanted a sibling.

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:54.407
-(laughs)
-So I hope, maybe,

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.075
-maybe, that one will prove out
at some point. -But, you--

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:57.543
but, you know, Trevor,
it-it's--

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:59.545
You have to laugh at it,
because it's so crazy.

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:01.080
But, on the other hand,

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:03.983
we face a serious problem

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:07.787
of a lot of these falsehoods
and these crazy stories,

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.323
uh, taking on lives
of their own.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:12.525
Uh, not about me
but about everybody

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:14.927
-and particularly anybody
in the public arena. -Right.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.464
And I have been, uh,
very outspoken

00:03:18.497 --> 00:03:20.466
about the decision by Facebook

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:24.337
to allow truly false
political ads to be run.

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.872
I want to applaud Twitter
for announcing

00:03:26.905 --> 00:03:28.474
they were not going to let that,

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:32.311
-uh, go forward. And I hope,
um... -(cheering and applause)

00:03:32.344 --> 00:03:34.480
I really hope
Facebook changes their mind.

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:36.949
Because more than half
the people in America

00:03:36.982 --> 00:03:38.551
get their news from Facebook.

00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:40.286
-And you. I mean, that's
the combination. -Right. Right.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.621
-Yeah. Yeah. -Well, but Fa--
No, but Facebook--

00:03:41.654 --> 00:03:43.489
but Facebook is-is a real issue.

00:03:43.522 --> 00:03:45.958
And we are living in a world
where people no longer know

00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:47.827
what truth is
and don't even agree on it,

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.962
-which-which seems to be
a larger issue. -Mm-hmm.

00:03:49.995 --> 00:03:52.898
You've witnessed
the change in politics

00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:54.433
through many different times.

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.769
Uh, in fact, we're
in an interesting period now

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:59.038
where the country's gearing up
for impeachment.

00:03:59.071 --> 00:04:01.440
-Mm-hmm. -And you are in
an interesting position, where,

00:04:01.473 --> 00:04:04.710
in your life,
you have been literally a part

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:07.446
of every single impeachment
in some way, shape, or form.

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.849
You had
the Watergate investigations

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.417
-that you were a part of.
-Mm. Mm-hmm.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.686
-You then had your husband,
who was impeached. -Mm.

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.689
-And now your political opponent
is getting impeached. -Mm-hmm.

00:04:16.722 --> 00:04:18.157
Do you have
the impeachment touch?

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.026
-Is this, like, a thing?
-(laughs)

00:04:20.059 --> 00:04:22.962
You know, um,
I wasn't part of Andrew Johnson.

00:04:22.995 --> 00:04:25.431
-But, you know, other-other
than that, um... -Yes.

00:04:25.464 --> 00:04:29.302
(stammers) It is a-a strange
perspective to have, um,

00:04:29.335 --> 00:04:32.705
because I was a young lawyer,
uh, investigating Richard Nixon.

00:04:32.738 --> 00:04:36.409
And I am very pleased
that the House today

00:04:36.442 --> 00:04:39.512
is proceeding in such
a deliberative manner.

00:04:39.545 --> 00:04:42.915
Uh, they had that vote,
uh, today about the procedures,

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:45.418
because that's what happened
in 1974.

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:48.087
-Mm-hmm. -At first,
the American people looked at,

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.089
uh, the idea that Nixon
would be impeached

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:53.426
-after he won a massive
landslide in 1972. -Right.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:55.961
And they said, "Well, that-that
doesn't make any sense."

00:04:55.994 --> 00:04:57.897
But as the evidence came out--

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.499
and we were literally working
18 hours a day,

00:05:00.532 --> 00:05:02.702
compiling evidence,
making, you know,

00:05:02.735 --> 00:05:05.705
the legal, uh, arguments,
the constitutional arguments--

00:05:05.738 --> 00:05:09.175
and, finally,
people realized that,

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.711
yeah, obstruction of justice,
abuse of power,

00:05:11.744 --> 00:05:14.313
contempt of Congress
are not what we want

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:16.582
to turn a blind eye to
in our country.

00:05:16.615 --> 00:05:18.084
We need checks and balances.

00:05:18.117 --> 00:05:19.418
It's one of the reasons

00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:22.254
why the rule of law is
at the core of our democracy.

00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:25.291
So, I know the difference, um,

00:05:25.324 --> 00:05:28.928
-about how the House's power
is supposed to work... -Uh-huh.

00:05:28.961 --> 00:05:30.796
'cause I was part
of seeing it work,

00:05:30.829 --> 00:05:32.431
uh, I believe, in the right way.

00:05:32.464 --> 00:05:34.433
One of the people
we profile is Barbara Jordan,

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:37.770
who, if you go to YouTube,
you can see her, uh, speech

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:40.873
when she voted on the articles
of impeachment in 1974,

00:05:40.906 --> 00:05:43.142
with her defense
of the Constitution.

00:05:43.175 --> 00:05:47.012
And so, I'm hoping that now
that this is going to move

00:05:47.045 --> 00:05:48.714
toward public hearings,

00:05:48.747 --> 00:05:50.983
where people can see
these witnesses in person,

00:05:51.016 --> 00:05:53.819
they can be like a juror
themselves trying to decide...

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:57.156
-Right -...uh, that, uh,
the American people will,

00:05:57.189 --> 00:05:59.792
you know, make a very,
uh, careful study

00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:01.327
of what they're being told,

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.996
because the founders
put impeachment

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:05.631
in the Constitution
for a reason.

00:06:05.664 --> 00:06:08.434
Uh, we have a elections,
but in between elections,

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:11.604
if there is behavior
that is undermining our country,

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:13.873
endangering
our national security,

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:17.710
as the allegations here are, uh,
it's an extraordinary remedy,

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:21.046
but one that has to be exercised
in a sober, careful way.

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.048
It's interesting,
because America's in a place

00:06:23.081 --> 00:06:26.886
where it feels like this process
and procedure will be tested

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.789
more than ever before because of
how partisan America has become.

00:06:29.822 --> 00:06:31.857
-Mm-hmm.
-Because of how, you know, toxic

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:33.592
politics in America has become.

00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:35.761
And I-I was interested, Chelsea,
because I've noticed,

00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:38.397
a lot of people have asked you
why you aren't running

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.466
for an open seat in Chappaqua.

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:42.501
You are a resident
of New York State.

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:45.337
There is a seat that is open,
and you have the ability

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.173
to take that seat,
in many people's opinion.

00:06:47.206 --> 00:06:49.074
And you've often said, "No,
there's other young people

00:06:49.107 --> 00:06:50.910
who could take it,"
and everyone said, "Yes."

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:52.878
But you would definitely,
you know, take that seat,

00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:54.713
and you would run with it,
and you've said

00:06:54.746 --> 00:06:56.782
you are interested
in changing people's lives.

00:06:56.815 --> 00:06:58.951
Do you have a hes... hesitancy

00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:00.986
to engage in politics

00:07:01.019 --> 00:07:03.856
because of how your mom has been
treated in her life?

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:07.593
No, uh, because I see her get up
every day and still engage.

00:07:07.626 --> 00:07:10.696
And so, for me, the decision

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:14.633
to not even think about
kind of running for the seat

00:07:14.666 --> 00:07:16.969
that Congresswoman Nita Lowey
will leave,

00:07:17.002 --> 00:07:19.171
uh, at the end of next year,

00:07:19.204 --> 00:07:22.308
is more about an affirmation
of what I'm doing now.

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.109
Um, and I'm thrilled

00:07:24.142 --> 00:07:25.778
that there are already
so many people

00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:27.680
who have thrown their hats
into the ring.

00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:31.550
And I hope that young people
don't kind of see the toxicity

00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:34.019
in this moment
and turn away from it.

00:07:34.052 --> 00:07:36.889
I hope they see it and say,
"I want to change that,

00:07:36.922 --> 00:07:39.258
"and I want to get back
to a place

00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:42.561
"of science
and evidence-based decisions

00:07:42.594 --> 00:07:44.063
"and respect for our democracy

00:07:44.096 --> 00:07:45.698
and respect
for the rule of law."

00:07:45.731 --> 00:07:49.301
So I hope people take it, uh,
perversely, as an opportunity...

00:07:49.334 --> 00:07:51.837
-Right. -...um,
for what must be different,

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.340
and then be part of the change
of doing that.

00:07:54.373 --> 00:07:55.541
You know, because it hasn't...

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:57.076
You know,
it hasn't always been like that.

00:07:57.109 --> 00:08:00.946
We've had partis... partisanship
from the very beginning.

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:04.316
But there's also been a lot
of effort to find common ground.

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:06.452
So, back
to the Nixon impeachment,

00:08:06.485 --> 00:08:09.421
when the articles
of impeachment were voted on,

00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:12.091
members of, uh,
the Republican party

00:08:12.124 --> 00:08:16.161
in the Congress voted
for one, uh, or more of them.

00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:19.231
So, there has been, uh,
many times...

00:08:19.264 --> 00:08:21.233
We write about, uh,
Margaret Chase Smith,

00:08:21.266 --> 00:08:23.702
a Republican woman Senator
from Maine,

00:08:23.735 --> 00:08:25.571
who was the first member
of her party

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:28.774
to stand up to Joseph McCarthy
in the early 1950s.

00:08:28.807 --> 00:08:31.443
So, we've had, not only people,

00:08:31.476 --> 00:08:33.546
but a consensus around

00:08:33.579 --> 00:08:36.081
-what it is we're trying
to protect and cherish. -Mm-hmm.

00:08:36.114 --> 00:08:40.019
And so, I can hope that maybe
there'll be enough people

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.720
who make their decision,

00:08:41.753 --> 00:08:43.989
not on, you know,
protecting the president,

00:08:44.022 --> 00:08:46.759
but protecting the country,
uh, either way they end up.

00:08:46.792 --> 00:08:48.761
It's interesting,
because many of the woman

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:51.430
you've written about in the book
also share one common trait,

00:08:51.463 --> 00:08:53.732
and that is, the obstacles
they had to overcome

00:08:53.765 --> 00:08:55.634
often included being accused
of things

00:08:55.667 --> 00:08:57.836
or being scrutinized in a way

00:08:57.869 --> 00:09:00.706
that was not similar
to the men around them,

00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:02.041
to their male counterparts.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:03.976
How would you respond
to a Trump supporter

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:06.312
if they took the time
to listen to you and said,

00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:08.013
"Hillary,
I don't think it's fair

00:09:08.046 --> 00:09:09.481
"that Trump is gonna be
impeached

00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:11.650
"for getting information
from Ukraine

00:09:11.683 --> 00:09:14.920
"when your team engaged
in Russian information

00:09:14.953 --> 00:09:18.123
"through, uh, you know, the
co... the-the team that worked

00:09:18.156 --> 00:09:19.592
on that side
on the Steele dossier"?

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.427
How do you respond
to that person when they say...

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.629
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. -..."You
engaged in foreign information

00:09:23.662 --> 00:09:25.397
"on a political rival,
Trump did the same.

00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:27.900
-What is the difference?"
-There's a huge difference.

00:09:27.933 --> 00:09:30.502
Um, you know,
if you look at the power

00:09:30.535 --> 00:09:32.605
that the president holds,

00:09:32.638 --> 00:09:35.140
the president is in a position

00:09:35.173 --> 00:09:38.711
to use American leverage
and credibility

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:41.213
to achieve the goals
of our nation.

00:09:41.246 --> 00:09:45.050
So I could imagine. No,
I could imagine a conversation

00:09:45.083 --> 00:09:47.786
where a president would say

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:50.189
to the president of Ukraine,

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:51.690
"You're new at the job.

00:09:51.723 --> 00:09:54.693
"One of the things that has
held you back is corruption.

00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:56.595
"We want to help you
fight corruption,

00:09:56.628 --> 00:09:59.164
"but we want evidence
that you are really dedicated

00:09:59.197 --> 00:10:00.799
-to fighting corruption."
-Right.

00:10:00.832 --> 00:10:02.501
If that's all
that had been said,

00:10:02.534 --> 00:10:03.936
there's nothing wrong with that.

00:10:03.969 --> 00:10:07.906
As secretary of state, I used
to go and visit leaders and say,

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:09.808
"You know,
one of your biggest problems is

00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:11.844
"you've got rampant corruption.

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:14.613
"It's in your family,
it's in your people around you.

00:10:14.646 --> 00:10:15.981
You've got to deal with it."

00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:17.583
But that's not what happened.

00:10:17.616 --> 00:10:21.186
And we now have not only
the whistleblower

00:10:21.219 --> 00:10:24.289
-and the alleged
incomplete transcript. -Mm-hmm.

00:10:24.322 --> 00:10:27.359
We now have a lot of witnesses
who are all saying,

00:10:27.392 --> 00:10:31.196
"This was about helping
the president himself."

00:10:31.229 --> 00:10:33.265
He is acting as the president.

00:10:33.298 --> 00:10:34.867
-He's not a political candidate.
-Right.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:37.236
He is not a private citizen.

00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:38.704
He's the president,
and he said...

00:10:38.737 --> 00:10:39.872
Now works for the United States.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:41.273
He works
for the United States,

00:10:41.306 --> 00:10:44.610
and we don't want
to squander our credibility.

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:48.547
So, if other countries see this,
as they clearly are,

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:51.350
that this president really
could care less about Ukraine,

00:10:51.383 --> 00:10:54.153
could care less whether
it becomes a stable country,

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:55.921
could care less
whether it's able

00:10:55.954 --> 00:10:57.823
to defend itself
against Russia...

00:10:57.856 --> 00:11:00.993
All he wants
is for them to manufacture

00:11:01.026 --> 00:11:04.596
some kind
of damaging information

00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:08.567
about the person he thinks is
his likely opponent, Joe Biden.

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.436
So, there's a huge difference.

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:13.105
I mean, people can gather,
you know, information

00:11:13.138 --> 00:11:15.541
in, you know,
all kinds of different ways,

00:11:15.574 --> 00:11:18.277
but when you combine it
with that quid pro quo

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:21.013
that existed, uh,
in that conversation,

00:11:21.046 --> 00:11:23.015
which has now been verified
repeatedly

00:11:23.048 --> 00:11:25.117
-Mm-hmm.
-by people who were in the room,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:28.887
people who were under pressure
to deprive the Ukrainians

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.523
of military aid so they
could defend themselves...

00:11:31.556 --> 00:11:34.326
(laughs): There's an active war
going on in Eastern Ukraine.

00:11:34.359 --> 00:11:37.629
The Russians
and their proxies are...

00:11:37.662 --> 00:11:40.432
still killing Ukrainians,
and so...

00:11:40.465 --> 00:11:42.468
what this president
has basically done is say:

00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:44.570
"I don't care,
I don't care about any of that,

00:11:44.603 --> 00:11:47.573
I just need some dirt, and I
don't care if you make it up."

00:11:47.606 --> 00:11:49.575
You know,
"In order to get military aid,

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:52.311
you've got to give me something
on Joe Biden and his son."

00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:54.480
It really does seem like
Trump has taken, uh,

00:11:54.513 --> 00:11:57.549
an unconventional approach,
to say the least,

00:11:57.582 --> 00:11:59.051
in international affairs.

00:11:59.084 --> 00:12:00.719
He's been very explicit
in saying,

00:12:00.752 --> 00:12:02.755
"It's America first
and that's all I care about."

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:04.389
Syria has been
an interesting case,

00:12:04.422 --> 00:12:07.226
and-and as a former secretary,
you have the ability

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:09.695
to speak to this
with an in-depth knowledge.

00:12:09.728 --> 00:12:11.897
Trump said,
"I pulled the troops out

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:14.900
because it's time for America
to leave these endless wars."

00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:17.669
Everyone spoke out against Trump
for doing this.

00:12:17.702 --> 00:12:20.172
But it was one of your former
ambassadors, Robert Ford,

00:12:20.205 --> 00:12:23.041
who said at one point that
the alliance with the Kurds

00:12:23.074 --> 00:12:24.810
was never meant to be permanent,

00:12:24.843 --> 00:12:27.279
it was just meant to be
a temporary coming together,

00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:29.281
because both sides wanted
to beat ISIS,

00:12:29.314 --> 00:12:31.250
and they weren't allies
of all time.

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:34.086
What do you think is
the more correct approach, then?

00:12:34.119 --> 00:12:37.856
Look, I-I don't think his real
philosophy is "America first."

00:12:37.889 --> 00:12:39.558
I think it's "Trump first."

00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:43.195
And he judges everything
as to how it will help him.

00:12:43.228 --> 00:12:46.799
And perhaps
he impulsively decided

00:12:46.832 --> 00:12:49.234
that bringing our troops home,

00:12:49.267 --> 00:12:51.236
uh, was good for him
politically,

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:54.239
-Mm-hmm. -and that seems to be
how he is justifying it.

00:12:54.272 --> 00:12:57.576
But let's assume we had,
uh, a president

00:12:57.609 --> 00:13:01.046
who, uh, was interested
in achieving that goal

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:03.048
in a defensible way.

00:13:03.081 --> 00:13:04.583
Here's what could have happened.

00:13:04.616 --> 00:13:08.387
He could very well have said
to the people who know something

00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.690
about Syria, the Kurds,
the Turks and others,

00:13:11.723 --> 00:13:14.193
and said, you know,
"We need to start a process,

00:13:14.226 --> 00:13:18.197
uh, in order to figure out
how we can protect the Kurds"--

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:20.032
who have been our allies.

00:13:20.065 --> 00:13:23.802
Maybe not for all time, but
they sure have been sacrificing

00:13:23.835 --> 00:13:26.371
on behalf of our objective

00:13:26.404 --> 00:13:29.908
to drive the Islamic State
out of Syria.

00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:33.912
And we know they're holding
tens of thousands of prisoners,

00:13:33.945 --> 00:13:35.314
-Right.
-uh, for us.

00:13:35.347 --> 00:13:37.916
So let's not leave them,
uh, to their fates.

00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:40.252
Let's figure out
how we work with the Turks,

00:13:40.285 --> 00:13:42.287
who are worried
about their border.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:44.356
Let's see how we work
with the Kurds.

00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:47.626
Let's use the leverage we have,
because we still have troops

00:13:47.659 --> 00:13:51.430
that are special forces who
are working alongside the Kurds,

00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:54.166
and let's figure out how
we're gonna make this happen,

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:57.402
instead of just waking up
and walking to the South Lawn

00:13:57.435 --> 00:13:58.871
of the White House and say,

00:13:58.904 --> 00:14:00.939
"We're bringing
all our troops home,

00:14:00.972 --> 00:14:02.741
and I've talked
to President Erdogan."

00:14:02.774 --> 00:14:05.344
And since we don't know
what he says on these calls,

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:08.146
for all we know it could be,
"Hey, uh, you know,

00:14:08.179 --> 00:14:10.649
"President Erdogan,
we're gonna take our troops out.

00:14:10.682 --> 00:14:12.718
What do you have on Joe Biden?"

00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:14.119
-We don't know.
-Right.

00:14:14.152 --> 00:14:17.122
And that's what's so frightening
about what's happening,

00:14:17.155 --> 00:14:20.659
-because he has an affinity
for dictators. -Mm-hmm.

00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:24.563
Uh, he's clearly misjudged,
uh, the North Koreans.

00:14:24.596 --> 00:14:28.400
Uh, Kim Jong-un
has been firing missiles

00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:32.271
and obviously not behaving
the way that a meeting

00:14:32.304 --> 00:14:35.974
with the president
should have led him to.

00:14:36.007 --> 00:14:38.310
He clearly does Putin's bidding.

00:14:38.343 --> 00:14:41.546
I mean, Putin could not be
happier to have the Ukrainians

00:14:41.579 --> 00:14:45.183
-Right. -caught up in this
while he continues to, you know,

00:14:45.216 --> 00:14:47.686
eat away at their country
and their sovereignty.

00:14:47.719 --> 00:14:51.390
The Russians have
a huge amount of influence now

00:14:51.423 --> 00:14:53.425
in the Middle East,
because...

00:14:53.458 --> 00:14:57.062
they're right there in, uh,
Syria alongside the Iranians

00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:59.431
and propping up
the Assad government.

00:14:59.464 --> 00:15:02.034
So there's a lot
of moving pieces

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:04.036
on this complex chessboard,

00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:07.906
and I've been
in a White House Situation Room

00:15:07.939 --> 00:15:11.243
where the president
was demanding information,

00:15:11.276 --> 00:15:13.245
not acting on impulse,

00:15:13.278 --> 00:15:15.847
-Right. -where we were running
through different scenarios,

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:19.351
where we had to be
constantly testing our opinions

00:15:19.384 --> 00:15:23.121
against others in order to give
the president the best advice.

00:15:23.154 --> 00:15:25.691
That is not happening
in this White House.

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:28.527
It is, unfortunately, uh...

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.630
unpredictable
about what he will do next.

00:15:31.663 --> 00:15:33.699
So therefore, other countries,

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:36.401
particularly ones
adversarial to us,

00:15:36.434 --> 00:15:38.770
are going around the world
saying, "You can't...

00:15:38.803 --> 00:15:41.573
-you can't count on America
anymore," you know? -Right.

00:15:41.606 --> 00:15:44.776
"Count on us. We'll sell you
arms, not the Americans.

00:15:44.809 --> 00:15:47.546
"We'll make deals with you,
not the Americans.

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:51.249
We'll have investments in your
country, not the Americans."

00:15:51.282 --> 00:15:54.286
And it's a tragedy,
because, um,

00:15:54.319 --> 00:15:56.722
I think we were
really well positioned

00:15:56.755 --> 00:15:58.890
at the end
of the Obama administration

00:15:58.923 --> 00:16:01.493
to keep building
on our leadership,

00:16:01.526 --> 00:16:03.795
and I think that's been,
uh, squandered

00:16:03.828 --> 00:16:05.263
under this president.

00:16:05.296 --> 00:16:07.799
Let me ask you one question
before we wrap it up.

00:16:07.832 --> 00:16:10.202
The Book of Gutsy Women
talks about women

00:16:10.235 --> 00:16:13.038
who have done something amazing
throughout time.

00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:16.375
One thing that we can't deny
has changed throughout time

00:16:16.408 --> 00:16:19.478
has been politics
and the way we see the world.

00:16:19.511 --> 00:16:22.581
I've always been fascinated
as to your relationship.

00:16:22.614 --> 00:16:25.884
You know, you are... you are
your mother's daughter, yes,

00:16:25.917 --> 00:16:28.754
but you are younger than her--
are there ever political ideas

00:16:28.787 --> 00:16:30.489
or, you know,
conversations you have

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:33.592
where you don't agree or you've
changed how you see an idea

00:16:33.625 --> 00:16:35.560
because of your age difference?

00:16:35.593 --> 00:16:38.063
-Yes. (laughs)
-Yes. Absolutely.

00:16:38.096 --> 00:16:40.699
I think, um,
most notably on gay marriage

00:16:40.732 --> 00:16:42.134
and equal marriage rights,

00:16:42.167 --> 00:16:44.436
uh, which is something
that we talked about...

00:16:44.469 --> 00:16:46.171
-extensively...
-Wow.

00:16:46.204 --> 00:16:49.141
um, throughout... years,

00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:52.310
and I'm really grateful
and proud of my mom

00:16:52.343 --> 00:16:56.081
for her shift to being
just a dogged, determined,

00:16:56.114 --> 00:16:58.483
not only supporter but advocate
for equal marriage rights.

00:16:58.516 --> 00:17:00.852
So you were, like, in the house,
and you were like, "Mom...

00:17:00.885 --> 00:17:02.754
you got to get gay rights going.
Come on."

00:17:02.787 --> 00:17:05.157
It's almost, like, a weird fight
to be having with your mom.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:07.926
I'm not... 'Cause, like, I was
like, "I want to go to a party,"

00:17:07.959 --> 00:17:10.028
and you were like, "Mom,
gay people need to get married!"

00:17:10.061 --> 00:17:12.297
-"Go to your room, young lady!"
-(laughter)

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:14.399
That's pretty wild.

00:17:14.432 --> 00:17:15.567
I mean...

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:17.502
-Well, Chelsea was...
-Yes, but hopefully,

00:17:17.535 --> 00:17:19.504
in a nicer tone?

00:17:19.537 --> 00:17:22.974
But Chelsea was, you know,
really one of the strong, uh...

00:17:23.007 --> 00:17:26.478
voices on behalf of, uh,
gay marriage here in New York.

00:17:26.511 --> 00:17:29.514
Um, she, you know,
gave lots of speeches.

00:17:29.547 --> 00:17:32.117
She was part
of a group of leaders

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.419
-Mm-hmm.
-that were advocating for it.

00:17:34.452 --> 00:17:38.056
And, you know, I really respect
and-and listen to her

00:17:38.089 --> 00:17:40.525
about all kinds of things,
and this was something

00:17:40.558 --> 00:17:43.161
that, uh,
made a lot of sense to me,

00:17:43.194 --> 00:17:45.530
especially because she had
such passion about it.

00:17:45.563 --> 00:17:48.266
Well, I'll tell you this,
it is a Book of Gutsy Women

00:17:48.299 --> 00:17:49.801
written by two of the gutsiest.

00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:51.937
-Thank you so much for being
on the show. -Thank you, Trevor.

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:53.438
-Thank you.
-Wonderful having you here.

00:17:53.471 --> 00:17:56.174
-The Book of Gutsy Women
is available now. -(cheering)

00:17:56.207 --> 00:17:59.211
Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Chelsea Clinton, everybody.
