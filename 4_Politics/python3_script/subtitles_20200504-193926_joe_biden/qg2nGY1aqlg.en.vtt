00:00:05.002 --> 00:00:06.503
- Well we've done it.

00:00:06.503 --> 00:00:07.875
We're in Ripper town now.

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.116
- Rip city.

00:00:09.116 --> 00:00:10.454
- This is what the people wanted.

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:11.771
We're gonna bag us a ripper today.

00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:13.480
- We're gonna slap the cuffs on 'em.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.050
- It's been over 100 years.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.447
Who better to solve it than the boys?

00:00:18.447 --> 00:00:21.257
- I mean, if we don't, I'm
hangin' my head in shame

00:00:21.257 --> 00:00:22.412
and I'm never going back to America.

00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:25.041
- We can't go back to the States.

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:27.345
Well, here we go.

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:29.658
- Any of you seen a ripper?

00:00:29.658 --> 00:00:32.008
- This week on Buzzfeed
Unsolved, in our season premiere,

00:00:32.008 --> 00:00:33.648
we investigate Jack the Ripper.

00:00:33.648 --> 00:00:36.297
Perhaps the most infamous
serial killer of all time.

00:00:36.297 --> 00:00:38.589
Hundreds of suspects have
been named for this case

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.452
and it has baffled investigators
and ripperologists alike

00:00:41.452 --> 00:00:43.037
for over 100 years.

00:00:43.037 --> 00:00:45.628
- But it's not gonna baffle the boys.

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:47.409
- Yeah and if we're ripperologists.

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:49.158
- We're unbaffleable.

00:00:49.158 --> 00:00:50.516
- That's not a word.

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:51.662
- I think it's a word.

00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:54.662
- I've done so much research on this one.

00:00:54.662 --> 00:00:57.310
I'm very, very pleased with
the case I'm about to present.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.015
I think I've done it.

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:00.813
- You think this is your white whale?

00:01:00.813 --> 00:01:03.706
- I didn't solve it, but I did a good job.

00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:05.929
- Okay, well you got me all excited.

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:08.483
- [Ryan] The year is 1888.

00:01:08.483 --> 00:01:11.522
The stage, the shadowy
and bog-filled streets

00:01:11.522 --> 00:01:13.409
of the East End of London.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.779
More specifically, the
Whitechapel District,

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:19.781
an area with a proclivity
for violence and crime

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:22.569
amongst the backdrop of poverty.

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:26.471
But suddenly, a string of
murders terrorize the public

00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:28.828
in a way never seen before.

00:01:28.828 --> 00:01:32.691
The culprit, a mad man
with no clear motive.

00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:37.259
The world's most notorious
serial killer, Jack the Ripper.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.005
While most believe the Ripper

00:01:39.005 --> 00:01:41.408
claimed the lives of only five,

00:01:41.408 --> 00:01:44.645
now referred to as "The Canonical Five,"

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:47.023
others believe the
Ripper claimed the lives

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:49.085
of up to 11 women.

00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:52.775
All five of the canonical
victims were prostitutes,

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:55.516
as many women in the Whitechapel District

00:01:55.516 --> 00:01:59.358
had to turn to prostitution
as a way to survive.

00:01:59.358 --> 00:02:02.916
The morbid intrigue is
not a recent development.

00:02:02.916 --> 00:02:04.536
At the time of the murders,

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:07.976
literacy was increasing
amongst the general population.

00:02:07.976 --> 00:02:10.738
The murders were covered in the newspaper

00:02:10.738 --> 00:02:13.725
and the public became
morbidly fascinated by them.

00:02:13.725 --> 00:02:16.375
In the end, the public was so upset

00:02:16.375 --> 00:02:18.885
at the failed attempts
to identify the killer

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:21.380
that the police commissioner
and home secretary

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.467
eventually resigned.

00:02:23.467 --> 00:02:24.300
- [Shane] So was this like,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.346
one of the first instances of like,

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.898
sort of a media frenzy
around something like this?

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:31.424
'Cause this sounds like O.J. or JonBenet.

00:02:31.424 --> 00:02:33.898
- I wonder if they had
true crime shows back then.

00:02:33.898 --> 00:02:35.520
- I don't think they did, Ryan.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.122
- I could see them having
little sock puppets

00:02:37.122 --> 00:02:38.763
like they do in Game of Thrones.

00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:40.157
- Okay, I could see that.

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:41.562
Little puppets, yeah.
- Yeah, little puppets.

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:43.190
- I'm on board with that.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.030
- Also, touching on the
police commissioner,

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.217
I think this is the first time

00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:49.180
I've actually seen a
police commissioner resign

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.581
because he was so upset

00:02:50.581 --> 00:02:53.844
and that makes sense to me
because, I've said this before,

00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:55.314
when there's a serial killer on the loose,

00:02:55.314 --> 00:02:57.121
you really are just playing
cat and mouse with the killer

00:02:57.121 --> 00:02:59.661
and he's just getting out
foxed by him at every corner.

00:02:59.661 --> 00:03:00.630
- It's your whole livelihood.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.864
- That could drive you insane.

00:03:01.864 --> 00:03:03.746
I feel like that would drive me insane.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:07.306
Today, we're gonna cover
the five canonical victims

00:03:07.306 --> 00:03:09.306
and by the end will have examined

00:03:09.306 --> 00:03:11.866
the most suspects we've ever presented

00:03:11.866 --> 00:03:14.202
with eight possible killers.

00:03:14.202 --> 00:03:18.262
Without further ado, let's
jump into the timeline.

00:03:18.262 --> 00:03:22.830
On August 31, 1888 at 3:40 a.m.,

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.347
the body of Mary Ann Nichols was found

00:03:25.347 --> 00:03:27.775
in Buck's Row in Whitechapel.

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:31.840
The body was discovered by
a man named Charles Cross,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.440
who claims he was walking along Buck's Row

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.384
when he noticed a bundle
towards the western end.

00:03:37.384 --> 00:03:39.546
Another man named Robert Paul

00:03:39.546 --> 00:03:41.875
approached the body with Cross.

00:03:41.875 --> 00:03:44.482
Police would eventually
arrive on the scene.

00:03:44.482 --> 00:03:47.217
Mary Ann Nichols was found on her back,

00:03:47.217 --> 00:03:51.715
her throat severely slashed,
and she was disemboweled.

00:03:51.715 --> 00:03:53.925
It was determined she had only been dead

00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:55.625
for about a half hour,

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:58.373
meaning the killer was likely nearby

00:03:58.373 --> 00:04:00.482
when Cross first saw the body.

00:04:00.482 --> 00:04:02.370
- Now how did they, at this point in time,

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.171
I don't know what their
forensics are like,

00:04:04.171 --> 00:04:06.118
how do they know what a half hour is?

00:04:06.118 --> 00:04:07.865
Do they just sort of like..

00:04:07.865 --> 00:04:08.882
- I mean, he just goes over..

00:04:08.882 --> 00:04:10.132
Let's see.

00:04:10.132 --> 00:04:13.269
- That's half hour blood right there.

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:15.075
- Yeah, that's 30 minutes.

00:04:15.075 --> 00:04:16.052
Maybe they had a bloodhound?

00:04:16.052 --> 00:04:17.279
I don't know.

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:19.277
- That's not what bloodhounds--

00:04:19.277 --> 00:04:21.693
- (laughing) I don't know.

00:04:21.693 --> 00:04:25.177
I know bloodhounds are used
to track things, but I--

00:04:25.177 --> 00:04:26.890
- You don't feed them
blood if they don't--

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.965
- You don't feed
bloodhounds bags of blood?

00:04:28.965 --> 00:04:31.589
- You feed a bloodhound some blood

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:33.087
and it barks for every minute.

00:04:33.087 --> 00:04:35.262
- And it goes, "A positive.

00:04:35.262 --> 00:04:36.762
"Universal donor."

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.239
- "Dead for five minutes."

00:04:39.239 --> 00:04:41.407
(laughter)

00:04:41.407 --> 00:04:42.958
- Right now we're at the
site of the first murder.

00:04:42.958 --> 00:04:44.347
This is Mary Ann Nichols.

00:04:44.347 --> 00:04:46.693
They found her at the
western end of Buck's Row,

00:04:46.693 --> 00:04:48.684
which is now Durward Street.

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:49.971
You can kind of see where it was.

00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:52.967
Like, see that building right
there with the white windows?

00:04:52.967 --> 00:04:54.630
We can't go over there 'cause
there's construction now.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.546
- It's a growing city.

00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:58.113
- But just below that and
a little bit towards us,

00:04:58.113 --> 00:05:01.126
she was found in the
gateway of one of the houses

00:05:01.126 --> 00:05:02.310
that lined this street before.

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.554
Kind of similar to these gateways here.

00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:06.623
I mean, it's kind of weird to think

00:05:06.623 --> 00:05:10.792
that they didn't know this
was the first of what would be

00:05:10.792 --> 00:05:13.598
the most infamous serial
killer of all time.

00:05:13.598 --> 00:05:15.464
- One crazy summer.

00:05:15.464 --> 00:05:16.929
(laughter)

00:05:16.929 --> 00:05:19.371
- [Ryan] On September 8, 1888,

00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:23.713
the body of Annie Chapman was
found at 29 Hanbury Street.

00:05:23.713 --> 00:05:27.529
Her body was discovered
by a man named John Davis,

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:31.201
an elderly resident of the
29 Hanbury Street building.

00:05:31.201 --> 00:05:35.318
Her throat was cut and this
time the violence escalated

00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:38.266
in that the murderer took her womb.

00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:42.970
So this is the approximate
location of the second killing.

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.272
Annie Chapman was killed
at 29 Hanbury Street,

00:05:45.272 --> 00:05:48.385
but my sources have told me
that street actually moved.

00:05:48.385 --> 00:05:50.292
29 Hanbury is actually over there,

00:05:50.292 --> 00:05:53.534
but where it approximately
happened, back in the day,

00:05:53.534 --> 00:05:56.011
was around the entrance to Truman Brewery,

00:05:56.011 --> 00:05:57.230
which is right there.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.567
- Imagine the pandemonium.

00:05:59.567 --> 00:06:01.226
- [Ryan] Dr. George Baxter Phillips

00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:04.489
was serving as the divisional
police surgeon at the time

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.904
and proposed the idea

00:06:05.904 --> 00:06:08.094
that the killer had anatomical knowledge

00:06:08.094 --> 00:06:11.539
by the manner in which Annie
Chapman's womb was removed.

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:13.407
That's the first clue, he's a doctor.

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:14.599
Probably.
- Probably.

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.376
- [Ryan] Or has basic
anatomical knowledge.

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:21.111
Later that month on September 27, 1888,

00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.463
the Central News Agency receives a letter

00:06:23.463 --> 00:06:25.281
from the apparent killer.

00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.339
It reads, "Dear Boss,

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:30.569
"I keep on hearing the
police have caught me

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:32.706
"but they won't fix me just yet.

00:06:32.706 --> 00:06:34.754
"I have laughed when they look so clever

00:06:34.754 --> 00:06:37.129
"and talk about being on the right track.

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:40.239
"That joke about Leather
Apron gave me real fits.

00:06:40.239 --> 00:06:42.879
"I am down on whores and
shant quit ripping them

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.583
"till I do get buckled.

00:06:44.583 --> 00:06:46.581
"Grand work the last job was.

00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:48.969
"I gave the lady no time to squeal.

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:50.609
"How can they catch me now?

00:06:50.609 --> 00:06:52.984
"I love my work and want to start again.

00:06:52.984 --> 00:06:55.708
"You will soon hear of me
with my funny little games.

00:06:55.708 --> 00:06:57.428
"I saved some of the proper red stuff

00:06:57.428 --> 00:06:59.603
"in a ginger beer bottle over the last job

00:06:59.603 --> 00:07:02.066
"to write with but it went thick like glue

00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:03.456
"and I can't use it.

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:06.558
"Red ink is fit enough I hope. Ha. Ha.

00:07:06.558 --> 00:07:09.427
"The next job I do I shall
clip the lady's ears off

00:07:09.427 --> 00:07:12.787
"and send to the police officer
just for jolly wouldn't you.

00:07:12.787 --> 00:07:15.529
"Keep this letter back
till I do a bit more work,

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:17.296
"then give it out straight.

00:07:17.296 --> 00:07:18.991
"My knife's so nice and sharp

00:07:18.991 --> 00:07:21.681
"I want to get to work right
away if I get a chance.

00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:22.826
"Good luck.

00:07:22.826 --> 00:07:25.399
"Yours truly, Jack the Ripper.

00:07:25.399 --> 00:07:27.449
"Don't mind giving me the trade name.

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:28.881
"Wasn't good enough to post this

00:07:28.881 --> 00:07:31.262
"before I got all the
red ink off my hands.

00:07:31.262 --> 00:07:32.930
"Curse it. No luck yet.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:36.560
"They say I'm a doctor now. Ha. Ha."

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.339
- [Shane] Hoo, I mean..
What a piece of work.

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:40.569
- [Ryan] Yeah, I--
I gotta give it to him though,

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:42.879
- [Ryan] Jack the Ripper
is a very catchy name.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.826
This guy had a knack for naming things.

00:07:44.826 --> 00:07:45.946
- He knows his brand.

00:07:45.946 --> 00:07:47.626
If this was happening today

00:07:47.626 --> 00:07:50.603
or if social media
existed during this time--

00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:52.032
- Oh, this guy would be a Viner for sure.

00:07:52.032 --> 00:07:52.865
- He'd be a Viner.

00:07:52.865 --> 00:07:57.363
He'd have extensive
hashtags on every post.

00:07:57.363 --> 00:07:59.069
- Instagood.

00:07:59.069 --> 00:07:59.926
Instafood.

00:07:59.926 --> 00:08:01.426
- #Ripped.

00:08:02.342 --> 00:08:03.794
- This letter wasn't released

00:08:03.794 --> 00:08:06.237
to the public until October 1st

00:08:06.237 --> 00:08:09.551
and many believe that it was
fabricated by a journalist,

00:08:09.551 --> 00:08:12.543
but regardless, it made
its way to the papers.

00:08:12.543 --> 00:08:15.433
Once in the eyes of the
public, the name stuck,

00:08:15.433 --> 00:08:17.312
and the killer from that point on

00:08:17.312 --> 00:08:21.255
went by the now famous
moniker, Jack the Ripper.

00:08:21.255 --> 00:08:24.364
Three days later on
September 30 at 1:00 a.m.,

00:08:24.364 --> 00:08:27.457
the body of Elizabeth Stride
was found on Berner Street

00:08:27.457 --> 00:08:29.539
by a man named Louis Diemschutz.

00:08:29.539 --> 00:08:30.932
Only her throat was cut,

00:08:30.932 --> 00:08:34.387
which led police to believe
that the murder was interrupted

00:08:34.387 --> 00:08:36.094
when Diemschutz approached.

00:08:36.094 --> 00:08:37.442
Right now we're walking up on the site

00:08:37.442 --> 00:08:40.948
of the second murder, Elizabeth Stride.

00:08:40.948 --> 00:08:44.027
She was found by a man right around here.

00:08:44.027 --> 00:08:45.587
This is now, I think, a schoolyard.

00:08:45.587 --> 00:08:47.078
Well a lot of people actually question

00:08:47.078 --> 00:08:48.142
whether or not this was the Ripper

00:08:48.142 --> 00:08:51.664
because her throat was cut rather hastily.

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:54.059
None of the other little
tricks that he pulled.

00:08:54.059 --> 00:08:55.558
No disembowelment, none of that stuff.

00:08:55.558 --> 00:08:58.615
Almost as if he was walked
up on and he had to run.

00:08:58.615 --> 00:09:01.376
- Yeah, just, "Oh, gotta
murder this one quickly."

00:09:01.376 --> 00:09:04.196
- Can't do the whole fixin's here.

00:09:04.196 --> 00:09:06.572
It was determined that she
was dead for 30 minutes

00:09:06.572 --> 00:09:09.362
when examined around 1:15 a.m.

00:09:09.362 --> 00:09:13.185
Shockingly, only 45
minutes after the discovery

00:09:13.185 --> 00:09:14.801
of Elizabeth Stride,

00:09:14.801 --> 00:09:18.091
another body was found in Mitre Square,

00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.558
just west of the Stride murder.

00:09:20.558 --> 00:09:22.868
A woman named Catherine Eddowes

00:09:22.868 --> 00:09:26.080
was the second victim in the same night.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.115
Her body was severely
mutilated, including her face.

00:09:30.115 --> 00:09:33.475
Her uterus was removed, as
well as her left kidney.

00:09:33.475 --> 00:09:37.678
So only 45 minutes after the
murder of Elizabeth Stride,

00:09:37.678 --> 00:09:39.631
investigators stumbled upon the body

00:09:39.631 --> 00:09:41.297
of Catherine Eddowes here.

00:09:41.297 --> 00:09:42.330
- Like, right here?

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:43.280
- In this general area.

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.627
There used to be a flowerbed here

00:09:44.627 --> 00:09:47.930
that was kind of, in a way,
served as a memorial for her,

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.668
but this was just, like I said,

00:09:49.668 --> 00:09:52.358
45 minutes after a
murder had just happened

00:09:52.358 --> 00:09:53.998
about 10 to 15 minutes away.

00:09:53.998 --> 00:09:55.115
Walking distance.

00:09:55.115 --> 00:09:59.110
What's weird is that after he
killed Catherine Eddowes here,

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.398
he went back towards the
direction of the first murder.

00:10:02.398 --> 00:10:04.127
- This guy knows how to zag.

00:10:04.127 --> 00:10:06.389
- Either that or he just
knew the police routes.

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:07.542
- I think he's just a zagger.

00:10:07.542 --> 00:10:09.515
- So the body is back there.

00:10:09.515 --> 00:10:12.020
Right now we're walking
somewhat near the path

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.430
that he would have taken away,

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.238
walking east away from the body

00:10:16.238 --> 00:10:17.865
and then we're about to arrive at a site

00:10:17.865 --> 00:10:19.422
where he dropped one of the only clues

00:10:19.422 --> 00:10:22.062
he actually left investigators.

00:10:22.062 --> 00:10:24.344
It's here that police would discover

00:10:24.344 --> 00:10:28.034
one of the few solid
clues in the entire case,

00:10:28.034 --> 00:10:30.377
a piece of Catherine Eddowes apron

00:10:30.377 --> 00:10:32.506
found near the scene of the crime.

00:10:32.506 --> 00:10:34.769
The apron was found by Alfred Long

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:37.977
in the doorway of an apartment
block near Goulston Street,

00:10:37.977 --> 00:10:41.657
a nearby street east of
the Eddowes murder site.

00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:46.197
Near this apron a message was
written in chalk that read,

00:10:46.197 --> 00:10:50.966
"The Juwes are the men that
will not be blame for nothing."

00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:54.510
A sign of the anti-Semitism
that was common in the area.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.123
However, the crucial detail
of this clue is the fact

00:10:58.123 --> 00:11:01.393
that it was found east of
the Eddowes murder site,

00:11:01.393 --> 00:11:04.966
in the direction of Elizabeth
Stride's murder site,

00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:08.619
the murder that occurred
just 45 minutes prior.

00:11:08.619 --> 00:11:11.549
This perplexing decision
could mean that the killer

00:11:11.549 --> 00:11:15.602
willingly entered an area
that was swarming with cops.

00:11:15.602 --> 00:11:18.899
Aside from demonstrating the
killer's evasive abilities,

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:20.719
this could suggest the killer

00:11:20.719 --> 00:11:22.999
lived in this East London area,

00:11:22.999 --> 00:11:25.029
as it possibly explains the motive

00:11:25.029 --> 00:11:27.763
for entering a dangerous situation.

00:11:27.763 --> 00:11:31.235
Later, a postcard is received
by the police department

00:11:31.235 --> 00:11:34.495
dated October 1st and written by someone

00:11:34.495 --> 00:11:38.875
also claiming to be the Ripper
with similar handwriting.

00:11:38.875 --> 00:11:42.541
"I was not codding, dear old
Boss, When I gave you the tip.

00:11:42.541 --> 00:11:45.061
"You'll hear about Saucy
Jacky's work tomorrow.

00:11:45.061 --> 00:11:46.811
"Double event this time.

00:11:46.811 --> 00:11:49.816
"Number one squealed a bit,
couldn't finish straight off.

00:11:49.816 --> 00:11:52.310
"Had not the time to get ears for police.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.989
"Thanks for keeping last letter back

00:11:53.989 --> 00:11:55.574
"till I got to work again.

00:11:55.574 --> 00:11:57.074
"Jack the Ripper."

00:11:58.186 --> 00:12:00.190
This isn't confirmed, but
there is information out there

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:02.613
that this postcard was
received by the press agency,

00:12:02.613 --> 00:12:03.843
or whoever received it,

00:12:03.843 --> 00:12:06.363
the morning after the
night of the double event.

00:12:06.363 --> 00:12:08.253
The thing being there that's strange

00:12:08.253 --> 00:12:12.083
is none of the public knew
about this double event

00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:13.743
because it hadn't been in papers yet.

00:12:13.743 --> 00:12:16.428
Yet this guy was able to
describe what happened in detail.

00:12:16.428 --> 00:12:18.081
- Yeah 'cause they're not runnin' around.

00:12:18.081 --> 00:12:19.368
- No, there's not like--

00:12:19.368 --> 00:12:21.043
- Two people got murdered tonight.

00:12:21.043 --> 00:12:22.981
- There's not Twitter.
Pass it down.

00:12:22.981 --> 00:12:24.379
Yeah, they're not playing
a giant game of telephone

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:25.579
with dixie cups.

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:27.139
There isn't Twitter.

00:12:27.139 --> 00:12:29.392
So it's possible and quite likely

00:12:29.392 --> 00:12:33.580
that if the timing of this is
true, this is Jack the Ripper.

00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:36.528
On the 13th of October in 1888,

00:12:36.528 --> 00:12:39.356
the police spent a week
searching every house

00:12:39.356 --> 00:12:43.161
in the East Densworth
slums, but found nothing.

00:12:43.161 --> 00:12:44.869
On October 16th,

00:12:44.869 --> 00:12:48.390
a man named George Lusk received a letter.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.446
Lusk was the head of the
Mile End Vigilance Committee,

00:12:51.446 --> 00:12:55.499
a group comprised of local
businessmen to assist the police.

00:12:55.499 --> 00:12:58.249
The letter was signed "from hell"

00:12:59.314 --> 00:13:03.067
and it was delivered in a
box with half a human kidney.

00:13:03.067 --> 00:13:04.362
The kidney, at the time,

00:13:04.362 --> 00:13:07.392
was believed to be Catherine
Eddowes' missing kidney.

00:13:07.392 --> 00:13:11.558
However, it was found to be
a prank by a medical student.

00:13:11.558 --> 00:13:13.335
- [Shane] Wait, so the "from hell" letter

00:13:13.335 --> 00:13:14.454
was a medical student?

00:13:14.454 --> 00:13:15.774
That's disappointing.

00:13:15.774 --> 00:13:16.824
- [Ryan] I suppose, yeah.

00:13:16.824 --> 00:13:19.157
- 'Cause I love "from hell."

00:13:20.127 --> 00:13:22.183
Just that as a sign off.

00:13:22.183 --> 00:13:23.153
- From hell.

00:13:23.153 --> 00:13:26.453
- This also demonstrates the
climate surrounding this.

00:13:26.453 --> 00:13:29.793
People weren't like, "This
is the worst thing on Earth."

00:13:29.793 --> 00:13:31.790
- They're like, "Well we
can have fun with this."

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:32.940
- "Wouldn't it be funny--"

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.250
- It's like the Ice Bucket Challenge.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:35.117
(laughter)

00:13:35.117 --> 00:13:37.287
Let's everybody get involved in this.

00:13:37.287 --> 00:13:41.081
- Nearly a month later,
on November 9, 1888,

00:13:41.081 --> 00:13:44.151
the body of the fifth and
final canonical victim,

00:13:44.151 --> 00:13:48.007
Mary Kelly, was found at
13 Millers Court in her bed

00:13:48.007 --> 00:13:51.272
by her landlord's assistant,
who was seeking rent.

00:13:51.272 --> 00:13:54.222
This murder was by far the most gruesome

00:13:54.222 --> 00:13:56.334
as her body was disemboweled

00:13:56.334 --> 00:13:59.334
and "virtually skinned down."

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:01.639
This is the last victim.

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:02.472
It's a little tricky

00:14:02.472 --> 00:14:04.914
because where there used
to be an apartment building

00:14:04.914 --> 00:14:08.816
is now, as you can see, it's
a parking lot or a car park

00:14:08.816 --> 00:14:11.241
so we can't really know
where exactly it was,

00:14:11.241 --> 00:14:13.056
but we know it was near the church.

00:14:13.056 --> 00:14:16.620
We know it was near the Ten Bells Pub.

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:19.249
We could be actually at
the place of residence

00:14:19.249 --> 00:14:21.056
of Jack himself.

00:14:21.056 --> 00:14:24.413
Here's the landlord on
the state of the body.

00:14:24.413 --> 00:14:28.068
"The sight that we saw I
cannot drive away from my mind.

00:14:28.068 --> 00:14:32.537
"It looked more like the work
of a devil than of a man."

00:14:32.537 --> 00:14:34.842
And with that we arrive at the end

00:14:34.842 --> 00:14:38.508
of the five canonical
victims, but as stated before,

00:14:38.508 --> 00:14:41.928
some believe there could
be up to 11 victims.

00:14:41.928 --> 00:14:44.328
With Jack the Ripper's reign of terror,

00:14:44.328 --> 00:14:46.908
one should wonder if
anybody caught a glimpse

00:14:46.908 --> 00:14:50.448
of this monster, and it
would seem that people did.

00:14:50.448 --> 00:14:52.766
When aggregating eyewitness testimonies

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:54.861
of those who believed they saw the Ripper,

00:14:54.861 --> 00:14:57.911
a rough outline of the
killer can be visualized.

00:14:57.911 --> 00:15:02.181
It can be assumed that he was
between 25 to 35 years old,

00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:05.844
roughly 5'5 to 5'7, stocky,

00:15:05.844 --> 00:15:08.840
with a fair complexion, and a mustache.

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.252
Allegedly, he was seen
wearing a dark overcoat

00:15:12.252 --> 00:15:13.551
and a dark hat.

00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:16.083
The Scotland Yard's
Violent Crime Command team

00:15:16.083 --> 00:15:17.773
has said that Jack the Ripper,

00:15:17.773 --> 00:15:20.241
who one could call evil incarnated,

00:15:20.241 --> 00:15:22.816
could be described in appearance as

00:15:22.816 --> 00:15:25.809
"perfectly sane, frighteningly normal,

00:15:25.809 --> 00:15:29.392
"and yet capable of
extraordinary cruelty."

00:15:30.699 --> 00:15:32.119
Sir Melville MacNaughten,

00:15:32.119 --> 00:15:33.189
the Scotland Yard's

00:15:33.189 --> 00:15:36.133
head of the criminal
investigation department in 1903,

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:39.321
had a general suspicion
of who the killer was.

00:15:39.321 --> 00:15:42.208
He knew that the Ripper had
basic knowledge of anatomy,

00:15:42.208 --> 00:15:45.031
possibly a doctor and
in McNaughten's notes

00:15:45.031 --> 00:15:48.338
he had narrowed his list of
suspects down to three names.

00:15:48.338 --> 00:15:49.818
That being said,

00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:52.812
due to the overwhelming
amount of compelling suspects

00:15:52.812 --> 00:15:54.514
and the fact that many feel

00:15:54.514 --> 00:15:57.028
the official three are not the Ripper,

00:15:57.028 --> 00:15:59.896
we're going to examine eight names,

00:15:59.896 --> 00:16:03.246
starting with McNaughten's
three official suspects.

00:16:03.246 --> 00:16:06.636
The first suspect was
Montague Johnson Druitt.

00:16:06.636 --> 00:16:10.448
Druitt was a barrister who may
have had an uncle and cousin

00:16:10.448 --> 00:16:11.845
who were doctors.

00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:13.721
Around the time of his death,

00:16:13.721 --> 00:16:16.286
Druitt may have been around the age of 40

00:16:16.286 --> 00:16:19.501
and supposedly had an interest in surgery.

00:16:19.501 --> 00:16:21.814
Montague possibly lived with his cousin

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:23.255
who was practicing medicine

00:16:23.255 --> 00:16:25.847
close to where the Whitechapel
murderers occurred.

00:16:25.847 --> 00:16:27.325
It also appears that about a month

00:16:27.325 --> 00:16:29.265
before the first canonical murder,

00:16:29.265 --> 00:16:31.300
Montague's mother went insane

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.570
and Montague had written in a note

00:16:33.570 --> 00:16:36.560
that he feared he was also going insane.

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.695
In his notes, McNaughten adds,

00:16:39.695 --> 00:16:41.230
"From private information,

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.580
"I have little doubt
but that his own family

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.780
"suspected this man of being
the Whitechapel murderer;

00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:50.867
"it was alleged that he
was sexually insane."

00:16:50.867 --> 00:16:54.478
After the final murder,
Montague disappeared,

00:16:54.478 --> 00:16:58.835
only to be found dead within
four weeks of the last murder.

00:16:58.835 --> 00:17:02.242
His body was found floating
in the Thames River

00:17:02.242 --> 00:17:05.114
on December 3rd, 1888.

00:17:05.114 --> 00:17:08.090
- I get the sense, this
is only the first suspect,

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.729
but I have a hunch everyone we look at

00:17:10.729 --> 00:17:13.245
is going to have 10 things
that make them sound like

00:17:13.245 --> 00:17:14.880
they are definitely Jack the Ripper

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.350
because London at the time

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.965
sounds like it was full
of insane psychopaths.

00:17:19.965 --> 00:17:22.745
- [Ryan] The second
suspect was Michael Ostrog,

00:17:22.745 --> 00:17:25.224
a Russian doctor and a criminal.

00:17:25.224 --> 00:17:27.439
Ostrog has been in an asylum previously

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:29.230
for homicidal tendencies.

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:32.963
McNaughten notes that Ostrog
couldn't provide a strong alibi

00:17:32.963 --> 00:17:35.170
for his whereabouts during the murders.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:37.513
Ultimately, he was not convicted

00:17:37.513 --> 00:17:39.088
because there wasn't enough evidence

00:17:39.088 --> 00:17:40.605
linking him to the crime.

00:17:40.605 --> 00:17:42.339
- [Shane] How does a
homicidal tendency work?

00:17:42.339 --> 00:17:44.219
You just dabble in murdering someone?

00:17:44.219 --> 00:17:45.559
- [Ryan] Yeah, I don't
know if that's tendencies.

00:17:45.559 --> 00:17:47.197
You either murder someone or you don't.

00:17:47.197 --> 00:17:48.726
I can't imagine there's
a half measure there.

00:17:48.726 --> 00:17:50.388
- [Shane] "He only killed a nanny."

00:17:50.388 --> 00:17:51.435
- [Ryan] Yeah, (wheeze) yeah.

00:17:51.435 --> 00:17:53.553
- [Shane] It was a funny
thing when he was 15.

00:17:53.553 --> 00:17:56.585
- [Ryan] The third suspect
was Aaron Kosminski,

00:17:56.585 --> 00:17:59.298
a Polish and Jewish
resident of Whitechapel,

00:17:59.298 --> 00:18:02.756
who spent some time in an asylum in 1889

00:18:02.756 --> 00:18:04.605
after the last murder.

00:18:04.605 --> 00:18:07.483
Kosminski would actually reside in asylums

00:18:07.483 --> 00:18:10.188
until his death in 1919.

00:18:10.188 --> 00:18:13.268
Kosminski was known for
his hatred towards women,

00:18:13.268 --> 00:18:15.128
particularly prostitutes.

00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:17.958
According to McNaughten, his
appearance matched descriptions

00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:21.138
provided by the police
of a man in Mitre Square,

00:18:21.138 --> 00:18:23.967
which, if you'll recall, was
the night of the double murder,

00:18:23.967 --> 00:18:27.383
where the Ripper likely
zig-zagged between the police.

00:18:27.383 --> 00:18:29.959
Kosminski might be a name
familiar to the public

00:18:29.959 --> 00:18:33.318
due to the fact that recently
his name made headlines

00:18:33.318 --> 00:18:35.988
due to his being featured
in a book entitled,

00:18:35.988 --> 00:18:39.199
"Naming Jack the Ripper."

00:18:39.199 --> 00:18:40.287
In this book,

00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:43.977
Russell Edwards claims that a
shawl purchased at an auction

00:18:43.977 --> 00:18:48.427
contains DNA evidence proving
Kosminski is the killer.

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:50.764
The shawl was bought under the impression

00:18:50.764 --> 00:18:53.409
that it reportedly was at the murder scene

00:18:53.409 --> 00:18:56.041
on the person of Catherine Eddowes,

00:18:56.041 --> 00:18:57.951
the fourth ripper victim.

00:18:57.951 --> 00:19:00.621
Edwards enlisted the help
of molecular biologist

00:19:00.621 --> 00:19:04.226
Jari Louhelainen of Liverpool
John Moores University.

00:19:04.226 --> 00:19:07.112
Edwards and Louhelainen
believed the blood stained shawl

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:09.252
is connected to Catherine Eddowes,

00:19:09.252 --> 00:19:12.743
based off of comparison from
one of Eddowes' descendants.

00:19:12.743 --> 00:19:15.037
They also claim that semen on the scarf

00:19:15.037 --> 00:19:17.774
is linked to relatives of Kosminski.

00:19:17.774 --> 00:19:21.472
With this discovery, many
felt that the case was closed,

00:19:21.472 --> 00:19:23.202
including Edwards.

00:19:23.202 --> 00:19:25.874
Which if it was true, that's
the smoking gun, right?

00:19:25.874 --> 00:19:28.134
- [Shane] You got semen, you got blood.

00:19:28.134 --> 00:19:29.844
- [Ryan] Time to drag his name in the mud?

00:19:29.844 --> 00:19:30.942
- [Shane] Oh, I like that!

00:19:30.942 --> 00:19:32.858
You got the semen, got the blood,

00:19:32.858 --> 00:19:34.473
drag his name on through that mud.

00:19:34.473 --> 00:19:36.039
- [Ryan] There you go.
That's not bad.

00:19:36.039 --> 00:19:38.850
It isn't bad, but let's find
out why we can't do that.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:41.465
"I've got the only piece
of forensic evidence

00:19:41.465 --> 00:19:43.591
"in the whole history of the case.

00:19:43.591 --> 00:19:45.711
"I've spent 14 years working on it,

00:19:45.711 --> 00:19:47.661
"and we have definitely solved the mystery

00:19:47.661 --> 00:19:49.562
"of who Jack the Ripper was.

00:19:49.562 --> 00:19:50.904
"Only non-believers

00:19:50.904 --> 00:19:53.700
"that want to perpetuate
the myth will doubt.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.441
"This is it now - we have unmasked him."

00:19:57.441 --> 00:19:58.386
- [Shane] So he's confident.

00:19:58.386 --> 00:19:59.318
- [Ryan] He's very confident.

00:19:59.318 --> 00:20:00.798
- [Shane] But he's also
spent a bunch of money

00:20:00.798 --> 00:20:02.271
and time on this.

00:20:02.271 --> 00:20:03.776
- I can understand why he's confident.

00:20:03.776 --> 00:20:05.129
He thought he has it from the beginning,

00:20:05.129 --> 00:20:06.931
then he goes to a molecular biologist,

00:20:06.931 --> 00:20:08.901
that guy analyzes it and goes, "Yeah!"

00:20:08.901 --> 00:20:10.284
I'd be gloating like, a fuckload.

00:20:10.284 --> 00:20:11.954
Could you imagine that?

00:20:11.954 --> 00:20:14.482
You just solved one of the
greatest mysteries of all time

00:20:14.482 --> 00:20:16.952
because you got confirmation
that you wanted to hear.

00:20:16.952 --> 00:20:19.688
But much to the chagrin of Mr. Edwards,

00:20:19.688 --> 00:20:21.443
that may not be the case.

00:20:21.443 --> 00:20:23.200
It turns out that the scientist

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.124
may have made a critical
error of nomenclature.

00:20:26.124 --> 00:20:30.284
Summed up, Dr. Louhelainen
identified a mutation in DNA

00:20:30.284 --> 00:20:31.742
on both the scarf

00:20:31.742 --> 00:20:34.776
and in Eddowes' relative
named Karen Miller.

00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:39.329
This mutation was believed
to be named 314.1C,

00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:44.254
a mutation only found
in 1 in 290,000 people,

00:20:44.254 --> 00:20:47.268
making it very likely it was a match.

00:20:47.268 --> 00:20:51.368
However, this identification
was reportedly incorrect

00:20:51.368 --> 00:20:54.288
and was not 314.1C,

00:20:54.288 --> 00:20:57.986
but instead 315.1C,

00:20:57.986 --> 00:21:01.848
which is a mutation shared
by more than 99% of people

00:21:01.848 --> 00:21:03.590
of European descent.

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:07.990
Basically, this DNA
could be anyone if true.

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:10.637
- [Shane] So it went from
being "it's that guy!"

00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:13.030
to "it's one of those million people."

00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.740
- Basically, it was like, "Oh!

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.130
"The blood on the scarf
and Eddowes' descendant

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.940
"had this very, very rare mutation.

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:22.300
"Oh wait, I misnamed the mutation.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:23.643
I"t's actually this other one, which--"

00:21:23.643 --> 00:21:24.856
- Wasn't he wrong?

00:21:24.856 --> 00:21:25.689
- Exactly.

00:21:25.689 --> 00:21:28.407
He hit a wrong keystroke
and then oh, all the sudden,

00:21:28.407 --> 00:21:31.267
99% of European people have this mutation.

00:21:31.267 --> 00:21:34.712
Furthermore, Kosminski's
DNA was linked to the scarf,

00:21:34.712 --> 00:21:36.680
using mitochondrial DNA,

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:39.837
using a subtype that is far from unique.

00:21:39.837 --> 00:21:41.207
Sir Alec Jeffreys,

00:21:41.207 --> 00:21:44.267
who's regarded as the godfather
of DNA fingerprinting,

00:21:44.267 --> 00:21:46.768
has said that this evidence

00:21:46.768 --> 00:21:49.462
"needs to be subjected to peer review.

00:21:49.462 --> 00:21:52.719
"No actual evidence
has yet been provided."

00:21:52.719 --> 00:21:55.066
Further adding fuel to
the fire of skeptics

00:21:55.066 --> 00:21:57.112
is the fact that Dr. Louhelainen

00:21:57.112 --> 00:21:59.072
has yet to publish this finding

00:21:59.072 --> 00:22:01.399
in a peer-reviewed scientific journal

00:22:01.399 --> 00:22:05.619
and has refused to answer
questions to news outlets.

00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:07.935
Thus, making it impossible

00:22:07.935 --> 00:22:10.342
to verify his and Edwards' claims

00:22:10.342 --> 00:22:13.245
and effectively doing quite the opposite.

00:22:13.245 --> 00:22:15.410
- How did Edwards react to this?

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.533
- Could you imagine getting the call?

00:22:17.533 --> 00:22:20.068
Like, this doctor having
to pick up the phone

00:22:20.068 --> 00:22:21.363
and be like, "Oh fuck."

00:22:21.363 --> 00:22:22.395
- Hello.

00:22:22.395 --> 00:22:24.292
- Remember that scarf I told you was a..

00:22:24.292 --> 00:22:25.133
- Why yes.

00:22:25.133 --> 00:22:28.090
The most famous piece of
evidence in the world.

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:29.610
- Yeah, about that.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:33.449
I think my pinky may have hit the five

00:22:33.449 --> 00:22:35.591
when I was tryin' to hit the four

00:22:35.591 --> 00:22:39.256
and it turns out it's kind
of useless and proves nothing

00:22:39.256 --> 00:22:41.901
so all that smack you've
been talkin' in the press

00:22:41.901 --> 00:22:44.666
kind of makes you look like a big fool.

00:22:44.666 --> 00:22:47.280
- I've wasted my life.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.149
- The fourth suspect is the notion

00:22:49.149 --> 00:22:52.113
that Jack the Ripper
was actually a female.

00:22:52.113 --> 00:22:55.663
A theory that ripperologists
call Jill the Ripper.

00:22:55.663 --> 00:22:57.773
This theory was allegedly a hunch

00:22:57.773 --> 00:23:00.433
of famed inspector Abberline, as well.

00:23:00.433 --> 00:23:03.693
The idea that all of the police
were on the hunt for a man

00:23:03.693 --> 00:23:05.702
when they should have
been searching for a woman

00:23:05.702 --> 00:23:07.246
would explain the Ripper being able

00:23:07.246 --> 00:23:09.825
to slip by without suspicion.

00:23:09.825 --> 00:23:11.430
????? pointed out that a midwife

00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:13.780
would have sufficient anatomical knowledge

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.590
and blood on her clothing
would have raised no eyebrows.

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.646
Though, it should be pointed out

00:23:19.646 --> 00:23:23.268
that all eyewitness
testimony points to a man.

00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:24.134
I love this theory.

00:23:24.134 --> 00:23:25.657
I think it makes sense that a woman

00:23:25.657 --> 00:23:28.462
would be able to slide through the crowd

00:23:28.462 --> 00:23:30.892
in a way that all these stupid police,

00:23:30.892 --> 00:23:32.302
not stupid police but police,

00:23:32.302 --> 00:23:35.237
would be able to not pick up on it

00:23:35.237 --> 00:23:37.997
because they're looking
for a man with a mustache.

00:23:37.997 --> 00:23:40.297
Far cry from a midwife covered in blood.

00:23:40.297 --> 00:23:43.097
- Feels a little too Joss Whedon-y for me.

00:23:43.097 --> 00:23:45.528
- Like, what if Jack
the Ripper was a lady?

00:23:45.528 --> 00:23:46.682
- The fifth suspect

00:23:46.682 --> 00:23:49.402
is Prince Albert Victor Christian Edward,

00:23:49.402 --> 00:23:52.032
aka "The Royal Conspiracy."

00:23:52.032 --> 00:23:52.865
- You know how they say

00:23:52.865 --> 00:23:54.554
you never trust someone
with two first names?

00:23:54.554 --> 00:23:56.162
This guy's got four of 'em.

00:23:56.162 --> 00:24:00.174
- So that either doubles that
mistrust or it cancels it out.

00:24:00.174 --> 00:24:01.405
Four names, fuck with me.

00:24:01.405 --> 00:24:02.538
That's what he said.

00:24:02.538 --> 00:24:03.873
- I'm gonna double it.

00:24:03.873 --> 00:24:05.680
- I'm gonna cancel it out.

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.080
- This theory is often scoffed at,

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.878
but is still perpetuated
due to its wild popularity.

00:24:11.878 --> 00:24:14.358
Prince Edward was known to frequent areas

00:24:14.358 --> 00:24:16.164
where the victims were found,

00:24:16.164 --> 00:24:19.377
an activity that led to
him contracting syphilis,

00:24:19.377 --> 00:24:22.184
which some believe drove him to insanity.

00:24:22.184 --> 00:24:24.084
Some posit that this also resulted

00:24:24.084 --> 00:24:27.088
in Albert having a
child with a local woman

00:24:27.088 --> 00:24:28.880
and Queen Victoria demanded

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.634
that everyone who knew of the child

00:24:30.634 --> 00:24:32.517
to be taken care of.

00:24:32.517 --> 00:24:35.504
Some believe that the
insanity spawned by syphilis

00:24:35.504 --> 00:24:37.944
drove him to commit the murders himself.

00:24:37.944 --> 00:24:40.801
Conspiracy theorists believe
he was never discovered

00:24:40.801 --> 00:24:44.565
because royal aids assisted
in covering his identity.

00:24:44.565 --> 00:24:46.795
However, as mentioned before,

00:24:46.795 --> 00:24:50.055
this theory is mostly
regarded as ludicrous

00:24:50.055 --> 00:24:51.866
as there is no substantial evidence

00:24:51.866 --> 00:24:53.915
to indicate its credibility.

00:24:53.915 --> 00:24:55.323
Looking into this,

00:24:55.323 --> 00:24:57.948
it's pretty clear that the
movements of a prince let alone,

00:24:57.948 --> 00:24:59.625
or anybody that the Queen would hire,

00:24:59.625 --> 00:25:01.613
would be able to be tracked,

00:25:01.613 --> 00:25:03.132
but I also do think
they could cover it up.

00:25:03.132 --> 00:25:03.965
I don't know.

00:25:03.965 --> 00:25:06.830
I don't think it's that
strong of a theory,

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:07.859
but it is interesting.

00:25:07.859 --> 00:25:10.349
- I feel like if you've got

00:25:10.349 --> 00:25:12.232
so many things at your disposal.

00:25:12.232 --> 00:25:15.815
If you're a queen you
probably have guards.

00:25:16.783 --> 00:25:17.616
I don't know.

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:18.472
You'd get away with a lot.

00:25:18.472 --> 00:25:20.511
Just grab people off the street.

00:25:20.511 --> 00:25:24.123
- The sixth suspect is famed
painter Walter Sickert,

00:25:24.123 --> 00:25:25.581
a theory mainly posed

00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:28.536
by the successful crime
novelist Patricia Cornwell.

00:25:28.536 --> 00:25:30.986
After making millions on her crime novels,

00:25:30.986 --> 00:25:32.764
Cornwell has devoted her time

00:25:32.764 --> 00:25:35.818
to the pursuit of Sickert as the Ripper.

00:25:35.818 --> 00:25:39.509
In 2001, Cornwell spent 2 million pounds

00:25:39.509 --> 00:25:42.509
buying 32 of Sickert's paintings, letters,

00:25:42.509 --> 00:25:45.849
and even Sickert's writing
desk in one bizarre stunt

00:25:45.849 --> 00:25:48.569
that was described by
art curator Richard Shone

00:25:48.569 --> 00:25:51.215
as "monstrous stupidity."

00:25:51.215 --> 00:25:54.406
Cornwell went full National
Treasure Nicholas Cage

00:25:54.406 --> 00:25:57.376
by cutting up a painting
in search of clues.

00:25:57.376 --> 00:26:00.409
Aside from stunts,
Cornwell rightfully claims

00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:04.217
that Sickert was obsessed with
the Ripper, which was true.

00:26:04.217 --> 00:26:06.837
Sickert referenced the Ripper
in some of his paintings,

00:26:06.837 --> 00:26:10.587
even titling one "Jack
the Ripper's Bedroom."

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:14.074
Cornwell claims one painting
mirrors the body position

00:26:14.074 --> 00:26:16.810
of fifth Ripper victim, Mary Kelly.

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:19.355
She claims another painting
mimics the facial wounds

00:26:19.355 --> 00:26:22.158
of fourth Ripper victim, Catherin Eddowes.

00:26:22.158 --> 00:26:23.858
There are also reportedly accounts

00:26:23.858 --> 00:26:27.470
of Sickert cosplaying as Jack the Ripper.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.479
You realize this is before
cosplay was a thing.

00:26:29.479 --> 00:26:31.165
I don't even know if Halloween
was that big of a thing.

00:26:31.165 --> 00:26:32.048
- [Shane] Are you kiddin' me?

00:26:32.048 --> 00:26:33.640
They had like Carnivale.

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.154
They had Venetian masks.

00:26:35.154 --> 00:26:36.379
They had a whole ton of weird shit back.

00:26:36.379 --> 00:26:38.894
- [Ryan] You don't find it
strange that a grown man

00:26:38.894 --> 00:26:41.258
is dressing up as Jack the Ripper for fun?

00:26:41.258 --> 00:26:42.175
No holiday.

00:26:43.099 --> 00:26:46.778
- This just feels like
when people shame furries.

00:26:46.778 --> 00:26:47.834
Just let 'em live their life.

00:26:47.834 --> 00:26:49.258
If they wanna dress up like a pony--

00:26:49.258 --> 00:26:50.943
- Okay, this is the
furthest thing from a furry.

00:26:50.943 --> 00:26:53.807
A furry is just dressing
up as an a furry creature

00:26:53.807 --> 00:26:55.960
because you have a sexual thing.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.854
- Why are they so muscular all the time?

00:26:57.854 --> 00:26:58.866
- I don't care about that.

00:26:58.866 --> 00:27:00.996
Dressing up as a furry animal is a far cry

00:27:00.996 --> 00:27:02.603
from dressing up as a serial killer.

00:27:02.603 --> 00:27:03.453
- It's fucking weird.

00:27:03.453 --> 00:27:05.226
- It's like a horse with pecs, right?

00:27:05.226 --> 00:27:06.999
- I think you're getting
lost in the furry culture.

00:27:06.999 --> 00:27:07.884
- It's strange.

00:27:07.884 --> 00:27:09.748
- You just said people were shaming them.

00:27:09.748 --> 00:27:12.628
- I'm not shaming it, I
just don't understand it.

00:27:12.628 --> 00:27:14.701
- Cornwell also shoots down the notion

00:27:14.701 --> 00:27:17.278
that Sickert's alibi was
that he was in France

00:27:17.278 --> 00:27:19.078
at the onset of the murders.

00:27:19.078 --> 00:27:22.358
She cites sketches that place
him in London in music halls

00:27:22.358 --> 00:27:24.988
at the time of at least three killings.

00:27:24.988 --> 00:27:28.944
By the way, anybody could sketch anybody.

00:27:28.944 --> 00:27:30.061
That means if I drew a sketch

00:27:30.061 --> 00:27:31.750
of you murdering somebody back in the day,

00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:32.851
I could show up to the police station

00:27:32.851 --> 00:27:33.743
and be like, here it is.

00:27:33.743 --> 00:27:36.583
Here is evidence that
Shane Madej, in cold blood,

00:27:36.583 --> 00:27:38.650
killed this woman dressed as a furry.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.081
- But I feel like you would do that.

00:27:40.081 --> 00:27:41.188
- And they'd be like, "You're right.

00:27:41.188 --> 00:27:42.155
"We've had a lot of reports

00:27:42.155 --> 00:27:43.132
"that Shane Madej is in fact a furry."

00:27:43.132 --> 00:27:44.610
- Slap the cuffs on those hooves.

00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:45.908
(laughter)

00:27:45.908 --> 00:27:48.392
- However, the biggest piece of her case

00:27:48.392 --> 00:27:51.977
is the analysis of forensic
paper expert Peter Bower.

00:27:51.977 --> 00:27:54.537
Bower identified three
of Sickert's letters

00:27:54.537 --> 00:27:56.147
and two of the Ripper's letters

00:27:56.147 --> 00:27:58.197
as coming from a handmade paper run

00:27:58.197 --> 00:28:01.283
of only 24 possible sheets.

00:28:01.283 --> 00:28:04.885
Basically, the odds of
both the Ripper and Sickert

00:28:04.885 --> 00:28:07.237
both writing letters on a batch of paper

00:28:07.237 --> 00:28:10.595
that only had 24 copies in existence

00:28:10.595 --> 00:28:12.636
is relatively slim,

00:28:12.636 --> 00:28:15.639
and while that is undoubtedly
compelling evidence,

00:28:15.639 --> 00:28:17.058
it should be reminded

00:28:17.058 --> 00:28:20.635
that all of the Jack the
Ripper letters are unconfirmed.

00:28:20.635 --> 00:28:22.570
I think he probably didn't do it,

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:24.384
but he is indeed a weirdo.

00:28:24.384 --> 00:28:25.308
- Yeah, he's a weirdo,

00:28:25.308 --> 00:28:28.307
but I don't think we need
to throw him in jail for it.

00:28:28.307 --> 00:28:31.197
- The seventh suspect is Joseph Barnett,

00:28:31.197 --> 00:28:32.877
who's particularly suspicious

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:35.730
as he actually lived with Mary Kelly,

00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:37.612
the final Ripper victim.

00:28:37.612 --> 00:28:41.452
In fact, Barnett may have
lived in 10 different locations

00:28:41.452 --> 00:28:45.146
in East London, making him
well versed in the area

00:28:45.146 --> 00:28:47.820
and capable of navigating back streets.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.748
Barnett worked as a fish porter

00:28:49.748 --> 00:28:52.933
and it's believed that Barnett
was in love with Kelly.

00:28:52.933 --> 00:28:55.331
According to an issue
of the Daily Telegraph,

00:28:55.331 --> 00:28:57.415
on November 10, 1888,

00:28:57.415 --> 00:29:02.198
Barnett referred to Mary
Kelly as "his wife,"

00:29:02.198 --> 00:29:05.138
when she was in fact only a roommate.

00:29:05.138 --> 00:29:08.340
Barnett also disagreed with
Mary's life as a prostitute

00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:11.638
and strived to make money
to keep her off the streets.

00:29:11.638 --> 00:29:15.828
"Marie never went on the
streets when she lived with me."

00:29:15.828 --> 00:29:18.296
Some theorize that Barnett
committed the first murders

00:29:18.296 --> 00:29:20.620
to scare Kelly off the streets,

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.033
which, for a time, actually worked.

00:29:23.033 --> 00:29:24.860
But when Barnett lost his job,

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:27.846
Kelly returned to the
street to make ends meet.

00:29:27.846 --> 00:29:30.624
Their financial struggles
often led to fights

00:29:30.624 --> 00:29:34.089
and Barnett also disliked
Kelly's love of gin.

00:29:34.089 --> 00:29:36.321
This culminated in one final fight

00:29:36.321 --> 00:29:39.567
over Kelly bringing home
two different prostitutes,

00:29:39.567 --> 00:29:42.934
an act that Joseph found unacceptable.

00:29:42.934 --> 00:29:45.664
This fight apparently got violent.

00:29:45.664 --> 00:29:47.591
Even a window was broken.

00:29:47.591 --> 00:29:50.115
Shortly after, Barnett moved out

00:29:50.115 --> 00:29:52.264
and only 10 days later,

00:29:52.264 --> 00:29:55.818
Mary Kelly was found
dead in her apartment.

00:29:55.818 --> 00:29:59.455
After the murder, Barnett was
questioned for four hours,

00:29:59.455 --> 00:30:01.270
but eventually set free.

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:02.505
Having lived there,

00:30:02.505 --> 00:30:05.739
Barnett would have intimate
knowledge of the household,

00:30:05.739 --> 00:30:08.849
including how to unlock
the door from the outside.

00:30:08.849 --> 00:30:12.549
He was also aware of Kelly's
schedule and tendencies.

00:30:12.549 --> 00:30:13.749
Details from the scene

00:30:13.749 --> 00:30:16.423
suggest Kelly was killed in her sleep,

00:30:16.423 --> 00:30:19.365
not by an outsider she invited in.

00:30:19.365 --> 00:30:22.035
Her clothes were folded by the bed

00:30:22.035 --> 00:30:25.972
"as though they had been taken
off in the ordinary manner,"

00:30:25.972 --> 00:30:28.175
and she was wearing a night gown.

00:30:28.175 --> 00:30:29.535
As a fish porter,

00:30:29.535 --> 00:30:32.585
Barnett would have crude
anatomical knowledge.

00:30:32.585 --> 00:30:34.835
- [Shane] They posit that
he had anatomical knowledge

00:30:34.835 --> 00:30:37.232
because he was a fish porter?

00:30:37.232 --> 00:30:39.252
- [Ryan] As a known associate of Kelly's,

00:30:39.252 --> 00:30:41.912
he would be someone
local prostitutes knew,

00:30:41.912 --> 00:30:45.202
allowing him to get close
enough for a sneak attack.

00:30:45.202 --> 00:30:47.147
Reportedly, one newspaper of the time

00:30:47.147 --> 00:30:50.157
stated that Barnett's
friends called him Jack.

00:30:50.157 --> 00:30:52.212
He also matches the physical description

00:30:52.212 --> 00:30:54.310
and the psychological profile created

00:30:54.310 --> 00:30:56.988
of Jack the Ripper by the FBI,

00:30:56.988 --> 00:31:01.472
and finally, the murders allegedly
stopped after Mary Kelly,

00:31:01.472 --> 00:31:03.603
the last canonical victim.

00:31:03.603 --> 00:31:06.483
After her death, Barnett
would have no other reason

00:31:06.483 --> 00:31:08.589
to kill anymore now that his lover,

00:31:08.589 --> 00:31:12.249
who he was trying to keep of
the streets, was now dead.

00:31:12.249 --> 00:31:13.399
- [Shane] I like it.

00:31:13.399 --> 00:31:14.449
- Pretty good, right?

00:31:14.449 --> 00:31:17.200
I mean, also to me, most of them,

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.049
frankly, are very circumstantial.

00:31:19.049 --> 00:31:21.999
This one, to me, it -
while also circumstantial,

00:31:21.999 --> 00:31:23.720
seems the closest to actual evidence

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.948
in that he lived with her,

00:31:24.948 --> 00:31:27.138
they fought ten days before her death,

00:31:27.138 --> 00:31:29.573
he was not a fan of prostitution,

00:31:29.573 --> 00:31:30.656
he tried to keep her off the streets.

00:31:30.656 --> 00:31:32.830
I could totally see him killing people

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.904
to try and scare her
from doing that, right?

00:31:34.904 --> 00:31:38.173
- The motive here is
certainly the most compelling.

00:31:38.173 --> 00:31:39.006
- For sure.

00:31:39.006 --> 00:31:39.845
- Out of all of the suspects.

00:31:39.845 --> 00:31:43.180
- And even the access
is the most compelling.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.013
This is the only one

00:31:44.013 --> 00:31:47.289
where I feel like there
was a very clear tie

00:31:47.289 --> 00:31:50.499
between the possible
killer and the victim.

00:31:50.499 --> 00:31:52.482
The eighth and final suspect

00:31:52.482 --> 00:31:55.617
is the most popular
suspect on casebook.org,

00:31:55.617 --> 00:31:57.767
a site devoted to Jack the Ripper

00:31:57.767 --> 00:31:59.717
and a place for ripperologists

00:31:59.717 --> 00:32:02.097
to work together to solve the case.

00:32:02.097 --> 00:32:05.706
The final suspect is James Maybrick.

00:32:05.706 --> 00:32:08.304
Maybrick's death coincided
with the stopping

00:32:08.304 --> 00:32:09.912
of the Ripper killings,

00:32:09.912 --> 00:32:12.931
as he died one year after the murders.

00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:15.278
Maybrick was an
upper-class cotton merchant

00:32:15.278 --> 00:32:16.906
who resided in an estate

00:32:16.906 --> 00:32:19.773
called the "Battlecrease
House" in Liverpool.

00:32:19.773 --> 00:32:22.530
Some would consider this
to be a damning detail,

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.108
as many feel the Ripper was a local man

00:32:25.108 --> 00:32:27.248
who likely wasn't upper-class.

00:32:27.248 --> 00:32:28.996
However, it should be pointed out

00:32:28.996 --> 00:32:32.053
that all the murders were
committed on a weekend.

00:32:32.053 --> 00:32:34.374
It stands to reason that
a wealthy cotton merchant

00:32:34.374 --> 00:32:37.026
would have the ability
to travel on weekends

00:32:37.026 --> 00:32:38.766
and it is also worth mentioning

00:32:38.766 --> 00:32:40.306
that he would have the benefit

00:32:40.306 --> 00:32:43.077
of not killing in his own locale.

00:32:43.077 --> 00:32:46.368
Though, what makes Maybrick
such a popular suspect

00:32:46.368 --> 00:32:49.795
is what many consider the biggest
piece of physical evidence

00:32:49.795 --> 00:32:51.722
that links him to the crimes.

00:32:51.722 --> 00:32:55.712
That piece of evidence is a
diary reportedly discovered

00:32:55.712 --> 00:32:58.642
under the floorboards
of Maybrick's estate.

00:32:58.642 --> 00:33:01.072
A diary that is signed,

00:33:01.072 --> 00:33:03.532
"I give my name that all know of me,

00:33:03.532 --> 00:33:07.405
"so history do tell what love
can do to a gentleman born.

00:33:07.405 --> 00:33:09.988
"Yours truly, Jack the Ripper."

00:33:10.895 --> 00:33:12.992
Also within the diary are reportedly

00:33:12.992 --> 00:33:15.504
intimate details of the killings.

00:33:15.504 --> 00:33:18.899
Backing up the diaries
authenticity are scientific tests

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:20.757
that have confirmed the diary seems

00:33:20.757 --> 00:33:23.917
to roughly match the era
of the Ripper killings.

00:33:23.917 --> 00:33:25.757
The diary was apparently discovered

00:33:25.757 --> 00:33:28.284
by a scrap metal dealer named Mike Barrett

00:33:28.284 --> 00:33:31.014
and this is where the story
starts to lose its footing.

00:33:31.014 --> 00:33:34.414
Barrett actually admitted
that he fabricated the diary

00:33:34.414 --> 00:33:36.814
only to recant the statement later,

00:33:36.814 --> 00:33:39.384
chalking it up to not
wanting the publicity

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:41.764
as he was going through
a failing marriage.

00:33:41.764 --> 00:33:44.154
Also shaky is the definitive details

00:33:44.154 --> 00:33:46.133
of the discovery of the diary.

00:33:46.133 --> 00:33:48.355
Some sources have it
falling into Barrett's hands

00:33:48.355 --> 00:33:51.642
via being handed down by
various generations of family.

00:33:51.642 --> 00:33:54.462
While other sources have
Barrett discovering it himself

00:33:54.462 --> 00:33:56.582
or Barrett's associates discovering it

00:33:56.582 --> 00:33:58.680
and then giving it to him
due to their knowledge

00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.349
of Barrett being an aspiring author.

00:34:01.349 --> 00:34:05.592
However, all that aside, if
the diary was in fact found

00:34:05.592 --> 00:34:08.278
under the floorboards
of Maybrick's estate,

00:34:08.278 --> 00:34:10.380
it is a very strong possibility

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:13.190
that he was in fact Jack the Ripper.

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.638
Following this discovery,

00:34:14.638 --> 00:34:16.715
a gold pocket watch was reported

00:34:16.715 --> 00:34:18.854
as potential Ripper evidence.

00:34:18.854 --> 00:34:21.872
The watch apparently contains
the scratched initials

00:34:21.872 --> 00:34:23.793
of the five canonical victims,

00:34:23.793 --> 00:34:25.721
in addition to the phrase,

00:34:25.721 --> 00:34:29.888
"I am Jack," and also "J. Maybrick."

00:34:31.071 --> 00:34:34.246
The scratches were analyzed
via electron microscope

00:34:34.246 --> 00:34:36.232
by Dr. Stephen Turgoose,

00:34:36.232 --> 00:34:38.342
whose studies suggests that the scratches

00:34:38.342 --> 00:34:40.948
were not done in modern times.

00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:43.390
Another doctor named Robert Wild

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:46.300
at Bristol University's
Interface Analysis Center

00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.317
concluded that the scratches

00:34:48.317 --> 00:34:52.190
"could have been very, very
old and were certainly not new,

00:34:52.190 --> 00:34:55.000
"but it is difficult to be precise."

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.190
The watch, which was displayed
in a Liverpool jewelry shop

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:01.220
by a college caretaker
named Elbert Johnson,

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:03.391
is dated 1846

00:35:03.391 --> 00:35:06.769
and was purchased for 225 pounds.

00:35:06.769 --> 00:35:09.318
But given the circus around
the main piece of evidence

00:35:09.318 --> 00:35:11.786
and Maybrick's far
location from the crimes,

00:35:11.786 --> 00:35:16.758
it's understandable to have
doubts of him as the Ripper.

00:35:16.758 --> 00:35:19.054
- I don't know, I liked
the other guy better.

00:35:19.054 --> 00:35:20.320
- Barnett?
Yeah.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.309
Yeah, I think I might, too.

00:35:21.309 --> 00:35:24.804
From just looking at circumstance,

00:35:24.804 --> 00:35:26.777
it seems like he'd be the most likely.

00:35:26.777 --> 00:35:28.822
- This guy seems like kind
of a boring fuddy duddy.

00:35:28.822 --> 00:35:30.706
Like, a rich guy who's like,

00:35:30.706 --> 00:35:32.884
"Ah, I guess I'll go
into town this weekend

00:35:32.884 --> 00:35:34.604
"and murder some people."

00:35:34.604 --> 00:35:37.794
- Like, he's treating it
like, playing 18 holes, right?

00:35:37.794 --> 00:35:38.824
Yeah, I could see that.

00:35:38.824 --> 00:35:41.359
- "And back for some squash."

00:35:41.359 --> 00:35:43.274
- I do think these are
the two strongest ones.

00:35:43.274 --> 00:35:44.107
- Yeah.

00:35:44.107 --> 00:35:45.929
- And if I had to put money on it,

00:35:45.929 --> 00:35:47.614
I'd probably say Barnett, too.

00:35:47.614 --> 00:35:48.904
- All right.

00:35:48.904 --> 00:35:50.997
- You don't seem as convinced
as I thought you would be.

00:35:50.997 --> 00:35:52.447
I thought this was really cool.

00:35:52.447 --> 00:35:54.367
A hidden diary under floorboards.

00:35:54.367 --> 00:35:55.257
A watch.

00:35:55.257 --> 00:35:56.364
- I know you don't like to hear this.

00:35:56.364 --> 00:35:58.058
This is sort of my approach

00:35:58.058 --> 00:36:00.629
to a lot of these real old true crime ones

00:36:00.629 --> 00:36:01.466
and sort of a JFK approach.

00:36:01.466 --> 00:36:03.245
- Oh no, I know what you're going to here.

00:36:03.245 --> 00:36:04.658
No, please don't say it.

00:36:04.658 --> 00:36:05.682
- Let it be a mystery.

00:36:05.682 --> 00:36:07.344
- Oh my..

00:36:07.344 --> 00:36:09.618
- We'll never know.

00:36:09.618 --> 00:36:10.981
We'll just never know.

00:36:10.981 --> 00:36:13.961
- You'd be a very, very bad judge.

00:36:13.961 --> 00:36:15.401
- Why?

00:36:15.401 --> 00:36:17.378
- Let it be a mystery (pounding of table).

00:36:17.378 --> 00:36:18.463
(laughter)

00:36:18.463 --> 00:36:19.505
Court is adjourned.

00:36:19.505 --> 00:36:22.723
For over 100 years, the
mystery of Jack the Ripper

00:36:22.723 --> 00:36:24.986
has continued to fascinate, confound,

00:36:24.986 --> 00:36:27.219
and infuriate the public.

00:36:27.219 --> 00:36:30.789
Perhaps one day we will have
the means to solve the crime.

00:36:30.789 --> 00:36:33.559
Or perhaps this famous case

00:36:33.559 --> 00:36:36.047
will be yet another victim to time.

00:36:36.047 --> 00:36:40.202
But, for now, the age old
question will continue to persist.

00:36:40.202 --> 00:36:41.977
Who was Jack the Ripper?

00:36:41.977 --> 00:36:44.560
The case remains unsolved.

00:36:50.632 --> 00:36:52.809
- Saucy Jack, truly saucy.

00:36:52.809 --> 00:36:53.816
Saucy guy.

00:36:53.816 --> 00:36:56.191
- Kind of a douche.

00:36:56.191 --> 00:36:57.355
- Well, I mean, you could say that

00:36:57.355 --> 00:36:58.362
about most murderers, right?

00:36:58.362 --> 00:36:59.834
- Yeah, they're all douches.

00:36:59.834 --> 00:37:02.861
- You ever think that was
someone's last word to a murderer?

00:37:02.861 --> 00:37:04.329
- "You're a douchebag."

00:37:04.329 --> 00:37:05.162
Slash.

00:37:05.162 --> 00:37:06.203
(laughter)

00:37:06.203 --> 00:37:07.126
- All right.

00:37:07.126 --> 00:37:10.543
(faint, perplexed music)
