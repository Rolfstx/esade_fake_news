00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.360
Perhaps until recently, Spanish Flu has
been what some people call

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.340
a "forgotten pandemic.'

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.580
But it was a huge global
calamity.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.860
In terms of the number of deaths

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:31.280
we're saying 50 to 100 million -
far greater than the casualties of the

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.960
first world war.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.620
Roughly around May, April May 1918 when

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.530
you know the carnage of the First World
War is is graphic and horrendous but at

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.890
the same time this this unknown enemy is
starting to sweep through the US, Europe,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:56.420
the trenches and it is recorded by the
Spanish press and it becomes dubbed as

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.440
the 'Spanish flu' because they are
neutral.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.880
Well at the time in the 1920s

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.350
they estimated that maybe 20 million had
died. By the late 20th century that

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.420
figure it went up to 25 million. In the
21st century with scientists and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.039
historians now getting together to work
much more closely, that figure has now

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.680
been upped to fifty to a hundred million
people killed.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.680
This virus killed more

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:32.740
people in the first 25 weeks than
HIV/AIDS has killed in 25 years -

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.800
horrendous! Those mortality
statistics are staggering.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.020
We don't know exactly why some flu strains are much
more severe than others and why some of

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:48.469
them would would be more likely to kill
people or cause very severe disease.

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.679
What is particular about avian and pandemic
viruses is that they replicate deep

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.069
inside our lungs.
When our cells detect this they trigger

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.819
very strongly an immune response this
leads to an influx of white blood cells

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.630
and fluids into our lungs and it
restricts the amount of air space that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.700
we have to breathe.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.220
The symptoms are very
graphic and very very striking so you

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.659
know it's said that some people drowned
in their own phlegm, so if it was hitting

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:18.980
or effecting
the lungs - people were spurting blood

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.970
from their ears and their noses.
Descriptions of people turning blue or

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.500
purple so you know it was really really
severe and people just dropping down in the streets

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.620
Those that succumbed to the
flu were in the age group 20 to 40 years

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.879
which is very unusual for an influenza
epidemic or pandemic and scientists and

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.100
historians are now still looking to see
why.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.660
There's really two ways that people

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.000
died in 1918 they either died from the
initial flu infection or they died from

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.409
a enormously strong immune response to
that virus were their lungs just filled

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.819
up with fluids from trying to attack the
virus that got into their lungs.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.019
So traditionally everyone sort of said
oh well it's the trenches you know the

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.849
conditions of the war and that's why it
was so fatal but when you think well you

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:22.430
know how did it spread so rapidly around
the world to places that are not part of

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.620
the theatre of war.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.860
I think the traditional explanation is it starts in

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.040
Kansas in an army camp and then the
troops bringing it over to the trenches,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.180
Europe but there's still so many, many
unknowns.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.700
So mathematical modelers have

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.970
long been interested in the 1918
pandemic and one of the questions is to

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.329
try and disentangle how its spread
around the world and exactly what the

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:52.040
routes have been. Given a perfect data
you could work backwards and try to

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.680
infer where it's come from.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.600
Whereabouts
does it arrive in a country, does it

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.760
arrive multiple times or thinking about
multiple countries where is the first place?

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.120
If you understand the origin of a
pandemic then you understanding about

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.980
where it's come from
and maybe you can stop that in future.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:16.240
Almost certainly it was a bird flu
originally but then we also know that

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.959
that flu or something very similar to it
was in pigs at the same time. Maybe it's

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.890
somebody who works very closely with
birds or who works very closely with

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.590
pigs or has some other exposure like
that.

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.720
One of the big really open questions in
flu research and flu Public Health is -

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.060
How does the virus adapt from one
species to another, how does for example

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.480
a virus in pigs or in Birds get into
humans and then start transmitting?

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.700
Then the key question is - how does the virus then adapt within that person to stop

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.010
being a pig virus or a bird virus and
become a human virus? in other words to

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.540
be able to transmit from human to human
and it's probably some very quick

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.010
evolutionary process that is going on
within that human and in many cases

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:09.740
won't be successful, but in a few cases
we'll and that's when the virus can

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.930
start spreading between humans and
become a flu pandemic and then stay in

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.100
humans as regular seasonal flu.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.540
Just as people were celebrating Armistice Day

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.320
and there was hope that it was dying
down but then it resurged and a far more

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.620
deadly and virulent strain emerged.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.040
So this the second wave really spread like

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:39.220
wildfire affecting a third or quarter of
the population of the world and it was

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:46.520
short-lived so it petered out not long
afterwards maybe in 1920/1921 but it was

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.100
it was in the sense short-lived.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.800
What happened was is that virus continued to

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.740
transmit among humans, in fact it
continued until 1957 to transmit between

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.630
humans and probably what happened there
is that the virus adapted to humans.

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:07.520
It wasn't this avian or swine virus that
came in and was accidentally more

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.200
pathogenic in humans.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.820
In a lab here in Cambridge we study both seasonal flu and

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:20.120
pandemic flu from the standpoint of - how
does the virus evolve? And how can we

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:27.260
predict that evolution and make vaccines
to try to artificially evolve the virus

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:32.180
both in the laboratory and in the
computer to understand what its gonna do

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.010
next and to make vaccines against those
strains that will evolve in the future.

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.080
So this is the basic science of studying
evolution

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.620
trying to predict that evolution.
Something that's nobody has ever been

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.960
able to do for a complex organism. And
then working to use that understanding

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.480
to make better vaccines.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.740
On the pandemic flu side we do a similar thing where we

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:00.120
look to see how that virus is changing -
that virus how it changes in birds and

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:05.680
how it changes in birds and in
other species and to try to see what

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.719
possible variants out there might be but
there might be and again to make

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.420
vaccines that could protect against all
of those variants that we see.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:18.940
Flu is very difficult to eradicate because it's constantly mutating and changing its

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.810
genetic information. We work on the
influenza virus and in particular on the

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:26.319
enzyme that copies the genetic
information of the virus when this

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:31.569
enters our cells. Specifically we're
interested in how this enzyme can do

00:07:31.569 --> 00:07:37.150
this activity and how it inserts
mutations in a viral genome that leads

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:41.580
to the formation of the new strains to
which we need to develop new vaccines.

00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:46.990
And we are also interested in when this
enzyme messes up how it triggers the

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.480
innate immune resistant and helps cause
disease.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.400
We really don't know why we

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:58.560
haven't seen a pandemic as deadly the 1918 pandemic. Scientists and

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:03.430
public health officials are extremely
concerned the national risk register

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:08.650
which is the way that our government
plans what are all the risks to civil

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.300
society in the UK. There's only two
events that are up there in terms of the

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:20.180
most catastrophic and that's a terrorist
event or a influenza pandemic.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.819
There is a real threat that there can be such
pandemics for example the H5 in the H7

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:32.979
flu viruses that have infected now close
to 2,000 people and killed about half of

00:08:32.979 --> 00:08:38.050
them. There has been with the H7 viruses
some transmission from human to human

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:44.199
not very efficient and it hasn't really
taken off. If either of those viruses did

00:08:44.199 --> 00:08:49.530
adapt to really transmit well between
humans, there's a real concern that it

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:54.960
could be as bad as the 1918 virus and
this is why there is so much research

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.460
done for the public good to try to
understand what's happening and so much

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.530
work done by people in public health and
preparing in hospitals in case something

00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.500
like that happens.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.660
Well experts like to
say it's not if-  but when?

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.480
Coming at it as a mathematician

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.540
it's happened a lot of
times in the past, it'll probably happen again.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:18.870
The 1918 pandemic is difficult
because of lack of data but the most

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:24.240
recent influenza pandemic we had was in
2009 and from that pandemic there is

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:28.710
some very good data. If we understand how
the 2009 pandemic spread maybe that

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:33.210
tells us something we can use to help
control future pandemics. We can't stop

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:37.200
them, the alternative is at least to
allocate our resources better to try and

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.300
reduce the number of cases in each place.

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:43.140
Looking back a hundred years to the last

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.930
pandemic also invites the question of -  a
hundred years from now what will we be

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:53.640
like in terms of how well we are
protected against flu? Or what things we

00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:58.890
could do to protect ourselves in some
situations?  Surely we'll be in a

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:04.020
situation where we know 
more about what viruses are in the world

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.780
and where they are, surveillance will be
so much better.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.160
Surely we'll be in a better situation
where we have better drugs and better

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:14.850
vaccines because we know more about the
virus so we know more about its

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:19.710
weaknesses, we know more about our immune
systems and we know how to enable them

00:10:19.710 --> 00:10:21.660
to fight those pathogens better.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.520
At some point we will have a universal vaccine

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:30.240
that will protect us against flu for the
rest of our lives. When this is is a

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:35.730
whole other question. There are a great
number of approaches and really good

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:41.520
ideas to doing this.There are already
attempts at this that are at a quite

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.020
advanced stage.

00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:45.560
It might be ten years
from now,

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.520
it might be twenty or thirty or

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.280
forty years from now we really don't
know.
