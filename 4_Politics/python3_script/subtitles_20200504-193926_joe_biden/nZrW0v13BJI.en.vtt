00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.440
Bree: In 2005, our family moved from the conveniences
of the city to the open spaces of the country

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.600
[Music]

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.660
Our original plan was to build a large
home

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.169
Welcome to our courtyard. Here is our Earth Bag bedrooms, my family

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:24.009
and how our plans changed. We had talked about so many different

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.240
things we were going to do Like build a house
Gary: I wanted to put in a big house

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.970
Gary: We experimented with ideas of log and
steel

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.690
Shelly: But as we lived out here longer, we
started to meet some of the neighbors

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.580
Shelly: They were explaining living with alternative
building materials and living mortgage free

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.880
Shelly: This idea that we would have several
small structures

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.940
Shelly: The main house which isn't too much
of a main house.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.920
It's just a one bedroom, one bathroom house
Shelly: And then build a bedroom for each

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.390
of the kids around the backyard to make a
courtyard

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.730
Gary: A house with outdoor halls
Shelly: We added lofts up into the house so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.490
the kids would at least have a space to sleep
in until their rooms were built

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.409
Bree: When we finally settled on doing these
earth bag houses

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.350
Bree: I admit even half way through it, I
didn't think it was actually going to get

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.530
done
Bree: I was like, no, this can't be happening

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.350
Bree: Until I moved in, it was just like "Wow,
it's happening!"

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.980
Garen: When we were doing the floor, it was
me, Mom and Shae, I think, going through and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.960
putting all the paper down
Garen: And Shae kept laying full squares of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.750
pink down
Garen: For some reason she kept grabbing those

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.950
out
Garen: And they were all over the place

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.670
Shae: It's cute that you think that was an
accident

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:56.100
Shelly: What's interesting about a round room
is ...you know in your world, you step outside,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.480
you're not in a square
Shae: It's really nice to have a break from

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.480
that.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.260
It's easier on the eyes to walk into something
that is more naturally built

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.080
Shae: Then to walk into something that is
very rigid and perfect

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.849
Bryson: I wanted a deck on the top of the
room for stargazing.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.830
Bryson: We went through a couple of designs
and then we figured out this crazy eight idea

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.060
Bryson: Where it would be the same amount
of square footage as all the other rooms but

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.580
it would also provide
Bryson: two separate areas for stuff to be

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.340
put in.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.760
[music]

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.560
Bree: We're breaking ground on Bryson's Earth
Bag Bedroom

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.090
Bree: The first thing we need to decide is
where we're going to put it.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.810
Gary: If you were to see it from the house
Gary: keeping with how this is swinging around

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.360
Shelly: Are you going to have to take the
laundry down?

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.000
Gary: Well, maybe not
Gary: If we move it over this way

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.380
Shelly: We could just put it in Bryson's room
and he could just automatically be the laundry guy.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.260
Gary: I like it.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.320
Bryson: I'm just going to lock my door.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.840
Bree: This clothesline is set low so we could
help when we were small.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.569
Shelly: Sometimes it's hard to have kids help
when their little 'cause it's just easier

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.170
to do it yourself
but it's really important to let them help

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.720
because it allows them to feel like a valuable
part of the family,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.070
Shelly: But I guess we could raise it now
that you guys are taller

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.770
But I kinda got used to it being short.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.340
Bree: The laundry lines are moved out of the
way.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.770
The guys set a center stake and mark out a
circle.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.880
Gary: Put your finger right there.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.820
Tip it down, and hold it straight up and down
and walk.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.740
Gary: Alright!

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.260
That's the inside.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.470
Bree: Bryson's room will be made up of two
small circles, like a crazy eight.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.900
Gary: Gonna put our trough in.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.320
Bryson: We need a trench?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.370
Gary: We need a trench.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:39.360
Bryson: Alright.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.800
Shelly: Okay Shae, I got our chart here.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800
The poles are 41 inches apart.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:43.800
Shae: Alright.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.629
Bree: We'll be using railroad ties for the
doorways.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.030
Bryson: And then walk through here and then
we have a little walkway through here.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.490
We'll have steps down and then we'll have
this room here.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:03.070
[music]

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:07.360
Bree: The trench is cut in and leveled
Bryson: So, what we are doing is we picked

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.769
a spot which is our main level
We can see from right here if we pull this

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.480
up to the right level
We got about two inches to go

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.690
and this string will work its way all the
way around the entire loop

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.840
and we're taking these at about five foot
increments

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.780
so that when we lay down the bags, they will
all be level.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:30.560
Bree: Once the posts are secure and the leveling
done, a threshhold is constructed.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.330
Shae: Awwwwwww
Bree: One circle will be lower so Dad sets

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.330
up for the steps.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.139
Gary: Come out here to 45 to here to a 45
'til we get a step.

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.190
Then I'll build another step in.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.740
Five and a half inch risers and nine and a
half inch treads.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.660
Bryson: We're putting cement in.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.200
Shae: I'm balancing this.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.270
There's absolutely no use to what I'm doing.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.820
Gary: First time we have ever put steps in.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:05:00.780
[music]

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.900
Bryson: Role this along, grab your bags off
Bryson: Fold them inside out.

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.500
Bree: We put down the first earth bag layer.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.120
[music]

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.360
Bryson: Hang on, I'm retrieving my flip flop.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:23.950
Shae: And then overtime they ask me to get
into a car, I'd be like, "Why?"

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.820
Bryson: Alright so we got a new tamper.

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:31.290
45 Buckaroonees.

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.960
Shelly: Wow, it works good.

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.160
Bryson: Really good.

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:44.560
Shae: [sing] na, na, na, ooohh oh
Bree: We're inviting some people over to help

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.790
with our earth bag building.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.860
It's time to prepare.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:51.910
Bree: First, easy access to damp dirt
Gary: Well, it's not like I forgot that Jeff

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:53.120
was coming over.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.710
But, he was there early and I wasn't ready.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.139
So, I jumped out of bed, 'cause he just knocked
on the door to get us some dirt for Bryson's

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:01.139
building.

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:06.500
Gary: We had laid out a circle for him to
be able to pull the dirt from.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.889
Gary: What a time saver.

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:14.070
You know the difference between a huge bucket
on a tractor and a wheelbarrow and a shovel.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.840
Gary: Ya, it will all level out just fine.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.610
Gary: You did a great job.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.580
Gary: It's amazing what you can get with a
few bucks and a case of beer.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.580
Jeff: I go then.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.580
Gary: I appreciate you.

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:23.580
Shelly: Thank you.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:24.580
You are awesome.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.130
Jeff: I'll go back and make sure my couch
didn't move anywhere.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.230
Bree: Next, installing the electrical wire
and boxes.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:36.550
Shelly: Shae and Bryson and I had a goal that
we would put in one layer of bags a day.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.770
and get up, I don't know, it's like a couple
feet up to the point where the guys are going

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.870
to be putting the electrical.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:46.130
[music]

00:06:46.491 --> 00:06:50.080
Shelly: There were several evenings we decided
we would just wait 'til the sun went down

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.889
and we'd put up this big light and just went
ahead and working into the evening

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:53.889
Shelly: Are you guys out there?

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:55.069
I can't see you.

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:56.750
Bryson: Ah, yes
Shae: ooooohhhhhh

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.539
Shae: Our bag building just right down there.

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:03.259
It's really scary, the fire is just right
there

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:08.090
On a hill not too far from here
Shelly: We wanted to get the electrical in

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.509
prior to the group of people coming over
because we just didn't want to mess with that

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:12.860
when everybody was over.

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:13.970
Garen came in to help us.

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:16.050
Garen: What universe have we ever been like
everyone?

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:18.979
Gary: Go ahead and put these boxes in.

00:07:18.979 --> 00:07:21.690
in strategic locations for the inside.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:22.889
and one for the out.

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:27.919
Gary: We have to separate the wire with the
barbed wire that we use to hold the bags.

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:31.150
We're able to use these U shaped nails to
be able to separate the two wires.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.560
Gary: The purpose is so we don't get an electrical
short.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.270
Garen: It shorts out, it is going to be a
bummer.

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:39.449
Bree: The electric will be hooked up to the
nearby solar system

00:07:39.449 --> 00:07:43.580
Shelly: The final step before the group of
people came over which is getting one layer

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:44.740
above the electrical.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.430
They broke up in two groups.

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.520
Gary &amp; Bryson and Shae &amp; Garen.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.259
They raced to see who could finish the circle
first.

00:07:52.259 --> 00:07:53.600
Shelly: Oooohh, nice boots
Garen: Yeah!

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.150
Shelly: Ooooh, watch the nails!

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:00.190
Shae: They had a huge doorway in their bag
circle.

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:01.190
That they didn't have to bag.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.440
Bryson: But you know they always have to have
the last word.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.180
Mainly 'cause they don't want to loose any
of their "beefiness"

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:05.880
or whatever.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.190
Shae: Are we doing okay?

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:11.630
Bryson: But we totally won.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.260
Garen: We just like crushed you.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.380
Bryson: We beat 'em like nobodies business
Shae: Oh, we definitely won.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:18.190
We creamed them.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:21.270
Bree: We need several cleats.

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:23.560
Gary: We have three different types of cleats
that we use.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.830
We have the simple cleat
that fits inside of the two bags.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.630
Then we have another cleat
That fits up against a window.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:30.530
Then we have a third kind that we use.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.089
They have kinda an L shape.

00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:34.469
Shae: We made over 40 cleats.

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:39.989
I can make mine really fast but Bryson
he put like a bazillion nails in there.

00:08:39.989 --> 00:08:45.230
Bryson: And then when your done putting nails
on this side, you flip it over so the nails

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.029
stick up like this
Bryson: When you're doing the cleats, you

00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:52.139
can put like 5 nails in it or like 20
and I was just putting mine in and I had them

00:08:52.139 --> 00:08:53.139
beautifully
Nice.

00:08:53.139 --> 00:08:54.139
In a row.

00:08:54.139 --> 00:08:55.139
Everything symmetrical, perfect.

00:08:55.139 --> 00:08:59.350
And Shae was just bam, bam, bam, done.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.129
Bam, bam, bam, done.

00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:04.209
Shae: 21 left.

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:05.600
Shelly: Wow.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:08.540
Bree: 2x12 Window Frames are also needed.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.050
Gary: Found on craigslist a couple of great,
brand new windows

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.559
a 4x3 and a 2x2.

00:09:14.559 --> 00:09:17.029
Cost us $120 for both windows.

00:09:17.029 --> 00:09:18.390
Bryson: Windows, you know.

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:22.110
Bryson: We'll be using these for the steps
and window frames.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.100
2x12s and 2x10s
Gary: The size of a window is static, meaning

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.769
it's usually a half of inch shorter
so that it will set inside of a window frame.

00:09:28.769 --> 00:09:33.250
In our case, we could just make the frames
3x5, 3x4 and so on

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:37.050
Gary: I use three 2x6s and just nailed them
together as a big header.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:38.679
Shae: Why do these things have to be together?

00:09:38.679 --> 00:09:41.759
Gary: These are headers that go above the
window.

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:43.939
Help support the weight of the roof.

00:09:43.939 --> 00:09:47.869
So that we're not putting the weight of the
roof over the top of the window itself.

00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:49.889
Bree: Steps are next.

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:52.689
Gary: Okay, these are the threads for our
stairs

00:09:52.689 --> 00:09:56.769
2x10s
They'll be nine and a half treads.

00:09:56.769 --> 00:09:58.980
Here, come with me.

00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:02.839
I'll show you how it goes on.

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:06.989
It will all go up
every two rows

00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:10.829
we're gonna have one step coming up
and a circle going all the way up to there.

00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:15.799
Gary: Inside the walls, we of course ran nails
up and ran nails down, similar to how we do

00:10:15.799 --> 00:10:16.799
our cleats.

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:19.989
We chose to bring that out and let it just
kinda free hang

00:10:19.989 --> 00:10:23.130
and maybe just a small, temporary post underneath
of it.

00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.360
Shelly: We also are gonna have bottles prepared.

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.360
We're gonna put in little bottle windows as
the steps go up

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.189
Bree: Lastly, a center pole is placed for
measuring.

00:10:32.189 --> 00:10:34.320
Gary: We place a pole in the center of the
building

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.500
An inch and a half pipe that runs completely
up about 9, 10 feet

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:41.209
Now, we have a nice pole that runs through
the center of the building

00:10:41.209 --> 00:10:44.790
to be able to gauge the circular bags as they
go around.

00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:48.510
Bree: The lightning storms are bringing additional
challenges.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:53.899
Bryson: This is what happens when it gets
too wet.

00:10:53.899 --> 00:10:59.239
Water starts bubbling up
the sides and it gets really slushy

00:10:59.239 --> 00:11:01.470
like you can't bag on top of that.

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.470
It's jello.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:06.779
Gary:If that doesn't dry out, we're going
to be in trouble.

00:11:06.779 --> 00:11:08.759
Bryson: My awesome room.

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:10.249
Dah Dah Dah!

00:11:10.249 --> 00:11:13.959
You can see Dad by it.

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:18.753
We put in the arch
We're going to put up that arch there.

00:11:18.753 --> 00:11:21.880
We put in one step to
go up

00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:27.619
to the top of that
Bree: Our friends arrive to help build Bryson's

00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:28.619
building.

00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:30.610
However, immediately, we experience a problem.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:33.480
A storm hits the night before dropping two
inches of rain.

00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.880
Bree: So Dad, what happened?

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.829
Gary: We had a 2 inch rain and soaked our
bags

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:40.230
Gary: Trying to maneuver them around a little
bit

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:42.800
and we end up with half the wall collapses
on one side.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.160
So we have to tear that all down.

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.220
We have to go back to the foundation.
and we have to start over.

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.279
Bryson: Restarting at the foundation was a
little discouraging.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:52.240
Bree: But the other one, the other circle's
okay Dad?

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.200
Gary: Yeah, the other circle is okay.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.480
Gary: So we start bagging as fast as we can
so when people show up

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.619
there's something to do when they get here.

00:11:59.619 --> 00:12:03.670
I think the night before, if there's a chance
of rain, we're definitely going to put tarps

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.670
on.

00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:07.259
Bree: I had this ingenious plan to split everyone
up in teams.

00:12:07.259 --> 00:12:11.959
However, there's no way to evenly divide
the work because the layers have to go up

00:12:11.959 --> 00:12:12.959
in sync.

00:12:12.959 --> 00:12:14.619
But, that's our little secret.

00:12:14.619 --> 00:12:18.649
Green Team mascot
Shelly: Wow, lots of enthusiasm.

00:12:18.649 --> 00:12:20.160
Bryson: Oh yeah.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:24.160
Shae: Our friends, Esther, Andrew, Deborah
and Peter came over to help us.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:25.819
It was so much fun to work with them.

00:12:25.819 --> 00:12:27.699
Bree: Faster than the speed of nature.

00:12:27.699 --> 00:12:30.420
If there is a speed in nature.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:35.420
Shelly: Do you know how slow nature is?
Andrew: It's too slow that's what it is.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:37.970
Garen: We are the strength of the ocean.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:38.970
Bree: That's right.

00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:43.490
Shelly: Our favorite thing about building
with earth bags is that all ages can participate

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:49.329
Bree: Hello, coming in at ...we don't know.
and team Blue

00:12:49.329 --> 00:12:51.859
Bryson: We are going to win.

00:12:51.859 --> 00:12:53.709
Bree: Are you feeling it?

00:12:53.709 --> 00:12:57.899
And then my, my home team right here.

00:12:57.899 --> 00:13:04.389
The Green
Shelly: Are you guys the Yellow team?

00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:08.100
Yeah, but what do we get Mom?

00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:09.100
Shelly: It's a sign.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.100
Bree: Hello, little bug.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:13.050
Bree: We need to reinstall the electric
Shae: Esther and I ducted tape the wheelbarrow

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:16.300
wheel and it surprising worked for quite some
time.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:20.089
Shelly: We used our arms to measure how long
we wanted the bags.

00:13:20.089 --> 00:13:23.420
About 3 arms length.
and we straighten out the barbed wire as much

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:24.420
as we can.

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:25.420
Our friend, Jackie helped me out.

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.130
We cut it in sections using bolt cutters and
then it was laid between the bags.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:33.480
Bree: The barbed wire springs into action
and Jackie is in the line of fire.

00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.589
Gary: Some of my buddies from work showed
up

00:13:35.589 --> 00:13:37.649
We had Scott, Alex, their son.

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:44.110
Malcom was here
Bree: Then our hero, Tom, shows up with Pizza!

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:47.839
Bree: After lunch we fixed the wall that had
fallen and were ready to go higher.

00:13:47.839 --> 00:13:50.259
Gary: Everything wasn't that so bad with all
that rain.

00:13:50.259 --> 00:13:53.639
All that dirt now was a bit damp.

00:13:53.639 --> 00:14:00.050
That made packing the new stuff a lot easier.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:06.720
Shelly: It was pretty exciting to see that
first window frame coming in to be placed.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:07.720
Bree: Whatcha doing Mom?

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.009
Shelly: I am putting in the bottle lights
for the steps.

00:14:11.009 --> 00:14:12.299
Bryson: Hello Camera.

00:14:12.299 --> 00:14:14.879
Gary: How are you doing Rick?

00:14:14.879 --> 00:14:16.720
I tell you, he really is a trooper.

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:21.759
He came over and jumped up on that wall
and just started working hard so thanks Rick!

00:14:21.759 --> 00:14:23.019
Gary: You haven't fallen off yet?

00:14:23.019 --> 00:14:24.019
Rick: No vertigo.

00:14:24.019 --> 00:14:25.019
Shelly: Is that rain?

00:14:25.019 --> 00:14:30.230
Bree: Over here you can see a storm is threatening
But over here it's blue sky so you never know

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:33.059
if we are going to get hit or not
Gary: Some of us are desk job people.

00:14:33.059 --> 00:14:34.299
We are starting to slow down.

00:14:34.299 --> 00:14:40.809
Bree: We are over waist high in bags, 3 window
frames are installed along with 4 steps.

00:14:40.809 --> 00:14:45.239
Bree: Having friends over to help build the
earth bag walls is a real boost.

00:14:45.239 --> 00:14:51.029
We're half way to the top
Let's take a look at the cost so far.

00:14:51.029 --> 00:15:01.399
Shelly: We are continuing our one layer a
day

00:15:01.399 --> 00:15:06.259
and as we get higher, we'll have to back that
down to about a half layer a day.

00:15:06.259 --> 00:15:12.100
Gary: We stayed pretty diligent on maintaining
the distance from the center pole

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:15.989
to the outside of the building.This is going
to really help us when we get to the roof

00:15:15.989 --> 00:15:16.989
at the very top.

00:15:16.989 --> 00:15:21.094
Bryson: Okay, so we're not nailing the cleats
in those until we get a little bit high

00:15:21.094 --> 00:15:22.230
so we can level the windows.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:24.739
Gary: That's a little different than we normally
do.

00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:27.299
We normally nail those cleats in as we're
going up.

00:15:27.299 --> 00:15:29.610
This time we're gonna wait until after done
with the roof.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.209
Bryson: And the building has to settle to.

00:15:31.209 --> 00:15:37.070
Shelly: On the bags, we cut out about say
a 15 foot length or so and then we turn them

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:39.220
inside out.
and then we have to be careful that as we

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.889
lay them, the seams don't match up at the
same places.

00:15:42.889 --> 00:15:45.100
Bryson: Our new addition to our farm.

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.239
Shelly: After the kids get settled in their
bedrooms, they get a pet.

00:15:48.239 --> 00:15:50.660
Garen's dog, Diesel, he just gets so excited.

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:54.040
Shae: He's a little black lab and he's so
playful.

00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:57.279
He gets into all the bags when we're trying
to work.

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:58.679
Shelly: Aw.

00:15:58.679 --> 00:15:59.679
Rolly.

00:15:59.679 --> 00:16:00.870
Shelly: Are you helping?

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:02.269
Shelly: The puppy is pooped.

00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:07.169
Bryson: Play with the bag, a minute later,
out.

00:16:07.169 --> 00:16:12.839
Bryson: Look how solid these things are.

00:16:12.839 --> 00:16:13.839
Amazing.

00:16:13.839 --> 00:16:19.600
Bryson: Point them to the center pole
and we do every 2 bags

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.339
Just enough for like one person you know.

00:16:22.339 --> 00:16:24.649
Like a normal step is longer.

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:25.790
We cut it down in size.

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.699
so it wouldn't take up most of the room
Gary: We're using cleats inside the walls

00:16:30.699 --> 00:16:33.810
for hanging pictures
Shelly: It's really hard to know exactly where

00:16:33.810 --> 00:16:37.649
gonna put those pictures so we put them everywhere.

00:16:37.649 --> 00:16:43.480
Bryson: I tuck the end like a paper airplane
and then I'll step on that, curl it up and

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.600
lay it on my leg.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.220
As they load in dirt, I just let it down.

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:50.799
And then at the end, I'll fold it and set
it down.

00:16:50.799 --> 00:16:56.619
Shelly: We put 2 quart jars together and then
we tape them down with duct tape so they don't

00:16:56.619 --> 00:16:57.619
move around.

00:16:57.619 --> 00:17:01.579
until we get the bags laid over the top
The jars will now create this natural lighting

00:17:01.579 --> 00:17:02.619
for each step.

00:17:02.619 --> 00:17:05.279
Shelly: I wonder if we are going to run out
of barbs.

00:17:05.279 --> 00:17:08.449
Shae: We ended up using around a roll and
a half of barbed wire.

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:10.559
Shae: Wear jeans, it's advised.

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:13.299
Shae: Probably $70 a roll.

00:17:13.299 --> 00:17:16.990
Shelly: Second roll.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:22.699
Bryson: We had to cover the bag building up
from the rain.

00:17:22.699 --> 00:17:26.169
'cause it was making it soggy.

00:17:26.169 --> 00:17:30.450
Gary: After the last problem with the rain,
we tarp every time when we figure it's going

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:31.529
to start raining.

00:17:31.529 --> 00:17:37.250
Gary: With the header, we level both sides
so we get a nice box around the frame.

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:39.740
Bryson: Are we going to lay a bag over the
top of this?

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.490
Gary: Several bags actually.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:46.600
Shelly: This is another place we added candy
jars so that some of the morning light can

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.890
come through.

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:51.120
Shae: And wave them in the air like you just
don't care.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.750
Shelly: As we get higher, we start to need
more help to move that dirt up to the top.

00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:59.130
Bree got in there and helped us out.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:03.470
Bree: My dog, Max, came out and helped us
out while we were working

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:06.380
He went out on the top of the earth bags with
us

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.980
Bree: When your acrobats get you into places
you don't want to be.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.399
Shelly: Oh, he passed the steps again.

00:18:12.399 --> 00:18:15.070
Bree: Oh, now I'm really scared.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:22.460
But I ended up having to go out and save him
because he couldn't get back down.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:25.090
It wasn't as if there were stairs or anything.

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:31.120
Bree: Hold onto your hats, 'cause it's about
to get one.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:37.000
Gary: Because we have a circle, I wanted to
put I wanted to put a design on top of it

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.040
the roof that's somewhat circular.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:43.231
So we laid our joists on 2 foot centers, like
your would a normal patio roof.

00:18:43.231 --> 00:18:49.730
Gary: We have 20 footers for the longest sections
in the circle.

00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:55.460
Gary: Our jig that we are going to use
The joists will run in this direction here

00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:58.070
for the rafters on the roof for that flat
roof.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:01.970
and then we can adjust them up and down and
then cleat them in.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:04.909
on both sides and then when the bags lean
up against them, that will give them lateral

00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:09.309
strength this way.
and then these get all pinned in on the top

00:19:09.309 --> 00:19:11.290
of the bags.

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:16.759
Gary: We have straight lines running north
and south

00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:20.669
and then we needed to have joists that go
out perpendicular to the outside

00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:23.730
put on there with joist hangers to help support
the weight.

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:28.750
and then there were these little jacks that
went off on a 45 from that.

00:19:28.750 --> 00:19:35.779
Shelly: So just when we think we are done
bagging, we still have a little bit more bagging

00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:38.870
to do
in between each of the rafters.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:44.080
The alternative to bagging is cobbing and
that is not any fun to try to fill it with

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.080
cob.

00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:48.630
Bryson: 50 pound tamp
Shelly: Oh yeah, it's beautiful

00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:55.080
Bryson: And this entire area out here is all
going to be the top decking.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.960
Gary: Since it's a deck we are going to be
walking on

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:02.269
I wanted like a 3/4 inch material or 7/8 material
Gary: I need to do 2 bisections.

00:20:02.269 --> 00:20:05.020
Shelly: Gary can be working away and he just
seems to know

00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:08.870
when it's time to slow down and teach the
kids something.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:13.429
Gary: Two things, a square corner and bisecting,
you can split this up

00:20:13.429 --> 00:20:17.730
into as many segments as you want to that
are all equal.

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:27.090
Gary: Pull up the plywood a little bit so
we can make our cuts

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:30.690
put our facia board on
re-attach the plywood

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:34.210
and we have a segmented roof up here that
almost looks circular

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:41.420
that's good
Bryson: Put telescope stuff on there and even

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:47.530
a bed maybe so we can sleep up there.

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:52.470
Gary: As usual, we're trying something new.

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:56.730
I'm not used to a roofing material that isn't
like, asphalt or steel

00:20:56.730 --> 00:21:01.840
We went to a professional roofer
and he suggested we us the 30 pound felt

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:03.850
and 3 coats of snow roof.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:04.990
Bryson: Here's what we're doing.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:07.419
We are taking this microfiber and we're laying
over

00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:11.600
the creases and we're covering it with the
white roof coat.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.759
We ended up doing like 3 or 4 coats on there.

00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:16.570
Shelly: The expenses are low until we get
to the roofing.

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.200
That's when the cost starts to really add
up.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:33.100
Bree: The front half of

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:37.179
the building takes a creative shape
Gary: It's more conical.

00:21:37.179 --> 00:21:42.190
Kind of a tilted cone
to give enough room for the inside to have

00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:43.190
stairs.

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:46.250
they run up alongside and a door that goes
out to the flat roof.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:50.039
Bryson: These go up there
for the door.

00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:54.580
Gary: The door requires 2 posts be installed
on top of the flat roof.

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.960
Bryson: This is really how high we gotta go
all the way

00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:01.379
Gary: Then we can run the bags along the sides
right up to those posts.

00:22:01.379 --> 00:22:04.240
There are now tall bags on one side of the
roof

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.299
and shorter bags on the other because we're
stair stepping them up

00:22:07.299 --> 00:22:09.140
to allow for the cone shaped roof.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:11.390
Bryson: We old tent poles
and double barbed

00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.480
to help strengthen the walls when they get
really high.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.919
The platform is right at the top of the stairs
so that we can open up a door up there

00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:21.880
and get out onto the main deck outside.

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.769
Gary: It just glues it right on there so we
don't

00:22:23.769 --> 00:22:30.200
have any problem with squeaking.

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:38.809
Bryson: We use the same type of cleat system
that we used on the other roof.

00:22:38.809 --> 00:22:42.960
Gary: We choose one of the door posts
at the top of the other room to be kinda a

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:45.519
center post.

00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:48.990
Bryson: Before we put the plywood on we're
going to

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:53.690
have to bag up all around the outside edges
so that it's flush with the plywood.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:54.690
Booyah!

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:57.190
We're closing in on the last little bit here
in the very, very corner.

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:02.160
It's right there and bagged all the way across
here.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:03.740
and it makes it really nice.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:05.190
It closes in the whole section.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:06.190
It's pretty cool.

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.460
The last bag we will probably ever put up.

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.570
Right there.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:13.350
Gary: Bryson and I go brain dead.

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.960
trying to get this facia on the outside
of this cone shaped roof.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:21.039
There's a lot of compound angles
and I'm making calculations errors.

00:23:21.039 --> 00:23:24.049
I got 2 facia boards up and we had to quit.

00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:27.370
Garen notices how frustrated I was
and feels sorry for me

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.269
so the next day, he's out there helping.

00:23:29.269 --> 00:23:32.000
He's helped us with the angles and bevels
up here

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.570
and its made a great difference this morning.

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:36.169
Bryson: If it wasn't for him we'd all be doomed.

00:23:36.169 --> 00:23:47.659
Bryson: The 
sheeting up there

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:48.950
is like a puzzle.

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:52.149
It's so unique that we have to cut all these
odd angles

00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:54.549
and we're doing angles, you know, when you
have an

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:56.720
angle this way and you have an angle that
way.

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:02.850
Anyway, these weird angles we keep cutting
and phew, those are hard to figure out.

00:24:02.850 --> 00:24:08.320
Bree: We bought the wood for conical roof
frame all in one shot.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:09.320
The cost?

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:23.539
Gary: We're putting up a 6x6 porch
Bryson: We got some posts instead of going

00:24:23.539 --> 00:24:25.029
down
to the forest and chopping them down

00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:26.390
we bought them at the store.

00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:30.419
There really straight
Gary: Unlike Bree's right?

00:24:30.419 --> 00:24:32.900
Bree has these skinny little things, there
real strong.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.750
It's all mesquite wood but it's just a totally
different look.

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:37.910
Next thing we do is get all the trim around
the edges.

00:24:37.910 --> 00:24:43.320
The metal rain drip trim
and then finish paper, then we're ready for

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:44.340
the Ondura.

00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:48.639
Bryson: We went with the Ondura 'cause it's
not as difficult to cut.

00:24:48.639 --> 00:24:50.179
It's suppose to last really long.

00:24:50.179 --> 00:24:52.720
Right now its
been up to a about a year on Garens' room.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.250
And it seems to look the same as when we first
put it on, actually.

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:56.690
Gary: No fading
Bryson: Yeah, no fading at all.

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:02.380
Gary: So the product seems to be pretty solid.

00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:05.960
We're still not sure.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:09.999
Shelly: That's an interesting way to hammer.

00:25:09.999 --> 00:25:12.880
Gary: Painful, to watch.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:18.809
Bryson: Bam, bam, bam, done.

00:25:18.809 --> 00:25:23.020
Shae: While the guys worn the roof, me and
Mom

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.529
decided to start with the stucco.

00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:26.879
Gary: To prepare for the gals going around
the corner

00:25:26.879 --> 00:25:27.940
there with the stucco.

00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:31.049
We need to have the windows complete
so they can bring the stucco right up next

00:25:31.049 --> 00:25:32.049
to the trim.

00:25:32.049 --> 00:25:33.233
Gary: We built these particular frames where
they are

00:25:33.233 --> 00:25:37.250
not attached to the bags or the header
Bryson: We're not going to do these windows

00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:38.499
loose any more I don't think.

00:25:38.499 --> 00:25:40.519
Gary: No, we're not doing them loose anymore.

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:42.519
Shae: They have the windows framed so we're
going

00:25:42.519 --> 00:25:45.210
to start stuccoing at least one of these circles.

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.889
We've decided on stucco because it holds up
better in the rain.

00:25:48.889 --> 00:25:52.909
Shelly: Bryson was up tamping 2 rows up from
the glass

00:25:52.909 --> 00:25:56.029
and to our shock, it cracked.

00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:58.529
Bree: I've found what we should put in there.

00:25:58.529 --> 00:25:59.870
Shelly: Oh my goodness.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.440
Shae: That's way too big.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.019
Shelly: We'll make it work.

00:26:03.019 --> 00:26:04.019
Shelly: Perfect fit.

00:26:04.019 --> 00:26:05.019
Bree: Look at that.

00:26:05.019 --> 00:26:06.019
Shelly: It's a perfect fit.

00:26:06.019 --> 00:26:07.270
Bree: How are we going to get that in there?

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.620
Bryson: Wearing my glasses for protection
of her eyes.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.710
Shelly: I got eye protection.

00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:16.980
I got "Bry" protections.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:22.929
Shae: It feels like the stucco goes really,
really slow.

00:26:22.929 --> 00:26:25.749
Shelly: But we have been plugging away every
day

00:26:25.749 --> 00:26:29.970
we do, you know, a couple batches
Shae: I keep getting dropped on.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.990
Shelly: Part of educating our kids is to spend
about

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:35.509
an hour a day doing some sort of physical
work.

00:26:35.509 --> 00:26:39.220
Gary: You know it's really important to have
the kids complete something.

00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:43.009
There's nothing like finishing a project and
having that sense of accomplishment.

00:26:43.009 --> 00:26:45.370
Shelly: One of the benefits of the earth bag
buildings

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:47.799
is that when they get done, they get a bedroom.

00:26:47.799 --> 00:26:52.690
Shae: We started looking back it and
it looks like we've gone like super far

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:59.370
so obviously now that we're in the lead,
we're gonna make it a game and beat the boys.

00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:00.370
Shelly:Yep.

00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:05.539
Gary: The idea that the ladies can beat us
is a little unusual because we're really good

00:27:05.539 --> 00:27:06.539
and very fast.

00:27:06.539 --> 00:27:07.539
And the Ondura goes up real quick.

00:27:07.539 --> 00:27:09.749
Bryson: And we can hammer those nails like
nobodies business.

00:27:09.749 --> 00:27:10.899
Bam, done.

00:27:10.899 --> 00:27:14.370
Gary: However, just to make them feel better,
we ran out of materials.

00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:15.370
Bryson: Yeah.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:16.960
Garen: We can really slow them down Bryson
is not

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.240
to get the door done.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:22.009
Bryson: Oh, because they can't cob around
the door

00:27:22.009 --> 00:27:23.169
'til we're done.

00:27:23.169 --> 00:27:26.240
Bree: Mom and Shae are racing to get the stucco
up

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.169
before Dad and Bryson can finish the door
and roof.

00:27:29.169 --> 00:27:33.559
but, before they can get out there
the weather takes a turn for the worst.

00:27:33.559 --> 00:27:36.669
Shelly: Ut oh Shae, this may put a damper
on our victory dance.

00:27:36.669 --> 00:27:39.419
Bree: Meanwhile Bryson and Dad are working
inside.

00:27:39.419 --> 00:27:41.580
Bryson: We got a really good deal on a wooden
door.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:44.399
Gary: We only paid about $75 bucks for the
door on craigslist.

00:27:44.399 --> 00:27:47.389
Bryson: My friend Andrew came over and he
helped out.

00:27:47.389 --> 00:27:50.869
Bryson: I'm gonna spray paint these bolts
so they are black.

00:27:50.869 --> 00:27:54.149
And stick them in the holes,
tighten them down, grind the tips off.

00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:58.450
The door had 48 bolts
and nuts

00:27:58.450 --> 00:27:59.450
and washers.

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.809
Bryson: There's a lot of washers.

00:28:01.809 --> 00:28:04.690
Gary: I had to build a frame for it.

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:06.659
Bryson: Dad, it looks like you cut it right.

00:28:06.659 --> 00:28:07.759
Gary: Oh, well amazing that.

00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:10.190
Gary: Then assemble the door to the frame.

00:28:10.190 --> 00:28:13.290
Which means cutting in the joints for the
hinges and

00:28:13.290 --> 00:28:17.700
and do some dado cuts
and relieving, chiseling

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:24.190
and then set the door inside there.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:34.419
Shae: We used cob for Bree's room
but cob requires a roof protection

00:28:34.419 --> 00:28:36.299
Shelly: And also some sort of way of protecting
it

00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:40.070
linseed oil or paint
Shae: We decided to use stucco which doesn't

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:41.999
wash away in the rain
My friend, Esther,

00:28:41.999 --> 00:28:44.970
Esther: Hi
Shae: Was so much fun to have her over here.

00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:46.899
Shae: You do it, I'll watch.

00:28:46.899 --> 00:28:50.110
I'm just going to have to invite her every
time.

00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:54.220
Bree: We use 10 or so bags of cement.

00:28:54.220 --> 00:29:02.490
Bree: The gals are the clear winners
'cause the the ridge caps for the roof won't

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.610
arrive until next week.

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:07.169
Gary: We'd like to NOT admit that the ladies
beat us because

00:29:07.169 --> 00:29:09.039
Bryson: Oh they didn't beat us
Gary: That's not even fair.

00:29:09.039 --> 00:29:10.070
We didn't have all our stuff.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.070
It's still on order.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.070
Bryson: We didn't have all our materials.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.070
Shelly: Hey, but we won.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:14.070
Shae: We did win.

00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:17.559
Garen: The reason they lost was because Garen
was not there.

00:29:17.559 --> 00:29:19.039
Shae: Oh Sure.

00:29:19.039 --> 00:29:21.820
Bree: Since we now know the roofing cost.

00:29:21.820 --> 00:29:28.580
Gary: This isn't the door we're going to be
installing but

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:33.850
we are going to be using this as a model.

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:37.220
The door up above is a slanted door at the
top.

00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:42.881
Bryson: We used 7 2x6 tongue and groove and
we

00:29:42.881 --> 00:29:43.950
glued them together to make the door.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.260
Bryson: if I got up, this thing would go whoop.

00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:55.730
Bryson:We used bolts to hold all the tongue
and groove boards together.

00:29:55.730 --> 00:30:01.370
Gary: Originally we had decided we wanted
a round

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:02.370
window.

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:03.370
Two half windows as one.

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:05.360
But we discovered that the width of the windows
was

00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:07.710
just too much to take out of the center of
the door.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.070
We'll go ahead and slide the windows this
way

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:14.410
and then turn it like this so that we have
less of a width and we have enough room for

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:15.410
the handle.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:18.379
Bryson: Following the line to cut it out.

00:30:18.379 --> 00:30:20.629
We're using that tool to do it.

00:30:20.629 --> 00:30:25.150
So we pre-drilled the hole there
and are able to stick our blade in.

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:26.259
Make sure the hole is on the inside of the
line too.

00:30:26.259 --> 00:30:31.570
From there we are able to cut around the whole
thing.

00:30:31.570 --> 00:30:36.090
Bryson: So let's go ahead and put it in.

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:40.759
Gary: We're going to be using Butyl rubber
and this is a typical window sealant.

00:30:40.759 --> 00:30:43.740
Instead of finding ways to clamp this into
the window

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.769
or screw it into the window like you would
typically do.

00:30:46.769 --> 00:30:48.669
We're going to actually glue this little puppy
in

00:30:48.669 --> 00:30:49.669
here with this Butyl rubber.

00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:54.100
Shelly: Did you notice Bryson is not with
us?

00:30:54.100 --> 00:31:02.400
Gary: Decided to go off and go skiing
Bryson: I love you guys!

00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.830
Gary: While it's drying, I devised a quick
and easy

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:08.830
system here.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.830
I'll do this on both sides.

00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:12.119
Then I can flip the door over and work on
the other side.

00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:29.960
Gary: We hope that Bryson 
and the crew had a great time skiing.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.960
Bryson: The door turned out a lot better than
what I thought it was going to be.

00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.960
Bryson: It fits!

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:38.600
Bryson: It acts almost like a skylight too
with the window

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.809
and so it lights the room real nice and stuff.

00:31:40.809 --> 00:31:42.760
It's really, really cool.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:49.840
Bree: We prepare to paint the exterior.

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:57.660
Shelly: Before we start painting, Bryson moves
the dirt away from the building.

00:31:57.660 --> 00:31:59.690
And then we start taping everything off.

00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:01.960
Windows, doors, bottle lights.

00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:07.080
Bryson: I'm gonna go ahead and go around and
seal all the cracks up above with this foam.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.739
Shelly: This paint is suppose to be one of
the best paints.

00:32:10.739 --> 00:32:15.279
It's got UV protection and it's suppose to
be one coat

00:32:15.279 --> 00:32:16.279
over the stucco.

00:32:16.279 --> 00:32:18.390
Which is going to be interesting to see if
it really is.

00:32:18.390 --> 00:32:19.581
It was a lot of money.

00:32:19.581 --> 00:32:22.820
A little over $200
which is way more than we normally pay for

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:23.820
paint.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.989
We usually get the recycle paints and pay
$10.

00:32:24.989 --> 00:32:28.039
Gary: We chose to do a different method of
painting this time around.

00:32:28.039 --> 00:32:32.230
Typically, in the past we've used rollers
and it's taken us several days to work on

00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:33.230
it.

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:34.250
We own an airless sprayer.

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:36.220
The advantages to having the airless sprayer,
is

00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:37.539
of course the biggest one, is time.

00:32:37.539 --> 00:32:38.940
Gary: Now, let's try the other bit.

00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.190
Gary: I hadn't used this thing in years
so we had to get it in, get it cleaned up

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:47.740
take it apart, oil it
We had things things all set up, flipped the

00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.740
switch.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.740
Nothing happened.

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.929
Bryson takes his multimeter out
has everything all hooked up.

00:32:50.929 --> 00:32:52.259
Says, it's the switch.

00:32:52.259 --> 00:32:56.119
So he went ahead replaced the switch with
a little wall socket switch that you have

00:32:56.119 --> 00:32:58.019
at your house.

00:32:58.019 --> 00:33:00.549
Bryson: Shut if off.

00:33:00.549 --> 00:33:02.460
Drum roll please.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:04.360
Gary: Oh yeah.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:05.629
Bryson: Okay.

00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:11.249
Gary: When the boys were young, I was really
involved in their problem solving but Bryson

00:33:11.249 --> 00:33:12.700
no longer needs my help.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.309
He really enjoys working with anything electronic.

00:33:15.309 --> 00:33:18.500
I just back away and let him do it.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.679
Gary: I forgot how to use the sprayer.

00:33:20.679 --> 00:33:22.529
So I gave the neighbor a call.

00:33:22.529 --> 00:33:24.049
He gave me some quick instructions.

00:33:24.049 --> 00:33:25.620
We got it primed right.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.960
Gary: Okay, thank-you.

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:33.419
Gary: Do you think we're ready Bry?

00:33:33.419 --> 00:33:40.369
Bryson: Gotta get the water out of it now.

00:33:40.369 --> 00:33:41.809
Bryson: It's a brown.

00:33:41.809 --> 00:33:42.809
Gary: Beautiful.

00:33:42.809 --> 00:33:44.320
Gary: Alright, your going up.

00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:46.049
Bryson: It was my job to paint.

00:33:46.049 --> 00:33:49.159
Gary: The spray patterns and working with
how to spray

00:33:49.159 --> 00:33:51.580
Bryson and I worked together and we got that
all figured out.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.159
Eliminating a lot of the overspray
Conserving our paint.

00:33:55.159 --> 00:33:57.799
Bryson: It was challenging to get up onto
those eves

00:33:57.799 --> 00:33:59.499
but after awhile I got used to it.

00:33:59.499 --> 00:34:02.399
Gary: Painting in the little corners and edges
takes a lot of time.

00:34:02.399 --> 00:34:03.559
With an airless sprayer.

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:04.720
Got it right away.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.989
Bree: I just want to show you this light switch.

00:34:07.989 --> 00:34:11.800
This light switch proves My Little Homestead
was a part.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.210
This is our signature move.

00:34:13.210 --> 00:34:16.049
We always put a light switch on electronics.

00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:18.859
Anything we can't get to turn on, it gets
a light switch.

00:34:18.859 --> 00:34:22.780
Bree: And it's the Garenster's job now.

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:23.890
Bryson: Show off.

00:34:23.890 --> 00:34:26.349
Bryson: Garen jumped in there and helped me
out.

00:34:26.349 --> 00:34:29.399
He always works really fast so it's like,
Oh Yeah.

00:34:29.399 --> 00:34:31.720
Bryson: Alright, I think I got it.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.260
Bree: Pretty slick huh?

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:34.260
Bryson: Yeah.

00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:38.950
Gary: Cause it's kinda a thinner paint
so it went through that machine just perfectly.

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:41.179
Bree: An hour to paint the entire building.

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:42.990
So how do you think it went Dad?

00:34:42.990 --> 00:34:43.990
Gary: What's that?

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:45.190
Bree: How do you think it went?

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.379
Gary: Oh gosh this is the only way to do this.

00:34:47.379 --> 00:34:48.379
Absolutely, It was great.

00:34:48.379 --> 00:34:50.750
Shelly: There was probably about 2 inches
on the bottom of the bucket

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.750
so it did make it.

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:54.639
It painted the whole thing including the eves.

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.460
And it's, it's a nice coat.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:01.130
Shae: The majority of the painting is done
so now it's onto painting the trim

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:02.760
which is us girls job.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:06.069
We're using this brownish, purple color
'cause it's what we have.

00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:07.640
And it's not going to cost anything.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.870
The guys will be working on
the trim around the door and the trim around

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:11.870
the patio.

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:13.620
Shelly: Finishing up the trim guys?

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:14.620
The last of it?

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:24.010
Gary: The last of 
the trim.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:40.080
Bree: The guys head inside to begin the soil
cement subfloor.

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:41.880
Bryson: Soil cement is easy.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.910
It's easier than laying normal cement.

00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:44.910
And cheaper.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:46.660
Gary: It's kinda like dry pour with a fence
post.

00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:48.910
You know, you just pour your cement in, pour
some water in

00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:49.910
and shazzam.

00:35:49.910 --> 00:35:50.980
Bryson: Bam, it's done.

00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.980
The whole floor.

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.720
Gary: We have everything out of here right
now.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:55.319
Bryson: We level out the floor.

00:35:55.319 --> 00:35:59.470
Gary: So we can begin to level this floor
We want to level it about 3/4 inch down.

00:35:59.470 --> 00:36:02.059
We're a little bit low on the backside so
we had to bring in some dirt

00:36:02.059 --> 00:36:03.059
in to level it.

00:36:03.059 --> 00:36:04.190
Bryson: Diesel has been a big help
Gary:Sure.

00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:05.190
Shelly: He has?

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:06.190
Gary: Oh yeah, he's a wet dog.

00:36:06.190 --> 00:36:08.700
Bryson: He's been breaking up the dirt for
me.

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.050
He was digging holes and it was making all
the dirt loose so I could scoop it.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:14.050
Bryson: Good Boy.

00:36:14.050 --> 00:36:15.780
Gary: Think how many muscles we are building.

00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.780
Shelly: Yeah.

00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:17.780
Gary: Yeah.

00:36:17.780 --> 00:36:18.780
Bryson: Better than working out.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:19.780
Shelly: Were you thinking about working out?

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:20.780
Lifting weights?

00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:21.780
Bryson: No.

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.780
Why would I?

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:23.780
I'm doing this.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.780
Shelly: Wow, Gary.

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.329
Okay, I dare you to go up there now.

00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:28.310
Gary: Walk up the sides.

00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:30.260
Shelly: No, no, I'm just kidding.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.260
Gary: No really.

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:34.260
You just walk up the side like this.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.260
Shelly: Gary.

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:36.260
Gary: As long as you stay close to the sides.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:37.260
Gary: Okay Bryson, you're the dirt thrower.

00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:38.260
I need dirt right here.

00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:39.390
Gary: You have to have enough dirt in the
room.

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:40.680
to get to your level spot.

00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.920
Gary: Okay Bry, let's do our string thing.

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.920
Bryson: Okay.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.440
Bryson: Your string was in my way.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.960
Gary: No, your dirt was in my string line.

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.809
Gary: We measure periodic spots
around the floor with a line level

00:36:51.809 --> 00:36:53.420
to make sure we're up to speed.

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:58.609
Gary: Found a guy selling a
Shelly: Craigslist wasn't it?

00:36:58.609 --> 00:37:01.710
Gary: Yeah, he was selling lawn mowers and
little tillers and stuff.

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:03.180
and this was just perfect size for us.

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:04.180
Bree: In 2005, our family moved from the conveniences
of the city to the open spaces of the country

00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:05.180
Bree: Our original plan was to build a large
home

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:06.180
Bree: Welcome to our courtyard
Bree: Here is our Earth Bag bedrooms, my family

00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.180
and how our plans changed
Shelly: We had talked about so many different

00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.180
things we were going to do Like build a house
Gary: I wanted to put in a big house

00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.180
Gary: We experimented with ideas of log and
steel

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:10.180
Shelly: But as we lived out here longer, we
started to meet some of the neighbors

00:37:10.180 --> 00:37:11.180
Shelly: They were explaining living with alternative
building materials and living mortgage free

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.180
Shelly: This idea that we would have several
small structures

00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.180
Shelly: The main house which isn't too much
of a main house. It's just a one bedroom,

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.180
one bathroom house
Shelly: And then build a bedroom for each

00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.180
of the kids around the backyard to make a
courtyard

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:16.180
Gary: A house with outdoor halls
Shelly: We added lofts up into the house so

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:17.180
the kids would at least have a space to sleep
in until their rooms were built

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:18.180
Bree: When we finally settled on doing these
earth bag houses

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:19.180
Bree: I admit even half way through it, I
didn't think it was actually going to get

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.180
done
Bree: I was like, no, this can't be happening

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.180
Bree: Until I moved in, it was just like "Wow,
it's happening!"

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:22.180
Garen: When we were doing the floor, it was
me, Mom and Shae, I think, going through and

00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:23.180
putting all the paper down
Garen: And Shae kept laying full squares of

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.180
pink down
Garen: For some reason she kept grabbing those

00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.180
out
Garen: And they were all over the place

00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.180
Shae: It's cute that you think that was an
accident

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.180
Shelly: What's interesting about a round room
is ...you know in your world, you step outside,

00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.180
you're not in a square
Shae: It's really nice to have a break from

00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:29.180
that. It's easier on the eyes to walk into
something that is more naturally built

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:30.180
Shae: Then to walk into something that is
very rigid and perfect

00:37:30.180 --> 00:37:31.180
Bryson: I wanted a deck on the top of the
room for stargazing.

00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:32.180
Bryson: We went through a couple of designs
and then we figured out this crazy eight idea

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.180
Bryson: Where it would be the same amount
of square footage as all the other rooms but

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:34.180
it would also provide
Bryson: two separate areas for stuff to be

00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:35.180
put in.
Bree: We're breaking ground on Bryson's Earth

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:36.180
Bag Bedroom
Bree: The first thing we need to decide is

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.180
where we're going to put it.
Gary: If you were to see it from the house

00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.180
Gary: keeping with how this is swinging around
Shelly: Are you going to have to take the

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:39.180
laundry down?
Gary: Well, maybe not

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:40.180
Gary: If we move it over this way
Shelly: We could just put it in Bryson's room

00:37:40.180 --> 00:37:41.180
and he could just automatically be the laundry
guy.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:42.180
Gary: I like it.
Bree: This clothesline is set low so we could

00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.180
help when we were small.
Shelly: Sometimes it's hard to have kids help

00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.180
when their little 'cause it's just easier
to do it yourself

00:37:44.180 --> 00:37:45.180
but it's really important to let them help
because it allows them to feel like a valuable

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:46.180
part of the family,
Shelly: But I guess we could raise it now

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:47.180
that you guys are taller
But I kinda got used to it being short.

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.180
Bree: The laundry lines are moved out of the
way.

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:49.180
The guys set a center stake and mark out a
circle.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.180
Gary: Put your finger right there. Tip it
down, and hold it straight up and down and

00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:51.180
walk.
Gary: Alright! That's the inside.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.180
Bree: Bryson's room will be made up of two
small circles, like a crazy eight.

00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.180
Gary: Gonna put our trough in.
Bryson: We need a trench?

00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.180
Gary: We need a trench.
Bryson: Alright.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.180
Shelly: Okay Shae, I got our chart here. The
poles are 41 inches apart.

00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.180
Shae: Alright.
Bree: We'll be using railroad ties for the

00:37:56.180 --> 00:37:57.180
doorways.
Bryson: And then walk through here and then

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.180
we have a little walkway through here.
We'll have steps down and then we'll have

00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:59.180
this room here.
Bree: The trench is cut in and leveled

00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.180
Bryson: So, what we are doing is we picked
a spot which is our main level

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:01.180
We can see from right here if we pull this
up to the right level

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:02.180
We got about two inches to go
and this string will work its way all the

00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:03.180
way around the entire loop
and we're taking these at about five foot

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.180
increments
so that when we lay down the bags, they will

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.180
all be level.
Bree: Once the posts are secure and the leveling

00:38:05.180 --> 00:38:06.180
done, a threshhold is constructed.
Shae: Awwwwwww

00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:07.180
Bree: One circle will be lower so Dad sets
up for the steps.

00:38:07.180 --> 00:38:08.180
Gary: Come out here to 45 to here to a 45
'til we get a step. Then I'll build another

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:09.180
step in.
Five and a half inch risers and nine and a

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:10.180
half inch treads.
Bryson: We're putting cement in.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.180
Shae: I'm balancing this. There's absolutely
no use to what I'm doing.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:12.180
Gary: First time we have ever put steps in.
Bryson: Role this along, grab your bags off

00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:13.180
Bryson: Fold them inside out.
Bree: We put down the first earth bag layer.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.180
Bryson: Hang on, I'm retrieving my flip flop.
Shae: And then overtime they ask me to get

00:38:14.180 --> 00:38:15.180
into a car, I'd be like, "Why?"
Bryson: Alright so we got a new tamper. 45

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:16.180
Buckaroonees.
Shelly: Wow, it works good.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:17.180
Bryson: Really good.
Shae: [sing] na, na, na, ooohh oh

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.180
Bree: We're inviting some people over to help
with our earth bag building. It's time to

00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:19.180
prepare.
Bree: First, easy access to damp dirt

00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:20.180
Gary: Well, it's not like I forgot that Jeff
was coming over. But, he was there early and

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.180
I wasn't ready.
So, I jumped out of bed, 'cause he just knocked

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.180
on the door to get us some dirt for Bryson's
building.

00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.180
Gary: We had laid out a circle for him to
be able to pull the dirt from.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.180
Gary: What a time saver. You know the difference
between a huge bucket on a tractor and a wheelbarrow

00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:25.180
and a shovel.
Gary: Ya, it will all level out just fine.

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:26.180
Gary: You did a great job.
Gary: It's amazing what you can get with a

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:27.180
few bucks and a case of beer.
Jeff: I go then.

00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.180
Gary: I appreciate you.
Shelly: Thank you. You are awesome.

00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.180
Jeff: I'll go back and make sure my couch
didn't move anywhere.

00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.180
Bree: Next, installing the electrical wire
and boxes.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.180
Shelly: Shae and Bryson and I had a goal that
we would put in one layer of bags a day.

00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.180
and get up, I don't know, it's like a couple
feet up to the point where the guys are going

00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.180
to be putting the electrical.
Shelly: There were several evenings we decided

00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.180
we would just wait 'til the sun went down
and we'd put up this big light and just went

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.180
ahead and working into the evening
Shelly: Are you guys out there? I can't see

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:36.180
you.
Bryson: Ah, yes

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.180
Shae: ooooohhhhhh
Shae: Our bag building just right down there.

00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:38.180
It's really scary, the fire is just right
there

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.180
On a hill not too far from here
Shelly: We wanted to get the electrical in

00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:40.180
prior to the group of people coming over
because we just didn't want to mess with that

00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:41.180
when everybody was over.
Garen came in to help us.

00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:42.180
Garen: What universe have we ever been like
everyone?

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:43.180
Gary: Go ahead and put these boxes in.
in strategic locations for the inside.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:44.180
and one for the out.
Gary: We have to separate the wire with the

00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:45.180
barbed wire that we use to hold the bags.
We're able to use these U shaped nails to

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.180
be able to separate the two wires.
Gary: The purpose is so we don't get an electrical

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:47.180
short.
Garen: It shorts out, it is going to be a

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.180
bummer.
Bree: The electric will be hooked up to the

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.180
nearby solar system
Shelly: The final step before the group of

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:50.180
people came over which is getting one layer
above the electrical.

00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.180
They broke up in two groups. Gary &amp; Bryson
and Shae &amp; Garen. They raced to see who could

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.180
finish the circle first.
Shelly: Oooohh, nice boots

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.180
Garen: Yeah!
Shelly: Ooooh, watch the nails!

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.180
Shae: They had a huge doorway in their bag
circle.

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.180
That they didn't have to bag.
Bryson: But you know they always have to have

00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:56.180
the last word. Mainly 'cause they don't want
to loose any of their

00:38:56.180 --> 00:38:57.180
or whatever.
Shae: Are we doing okay?

00:38:57.180 --> 00:38:58.180
Bryson: But we totally won.
Garen: We just like crushed you.

00:38:58.180 --> 00:38:59.180
Bryson: We beat 'em like nobodies business
Shae: Oh, we definitely won. We creamed them.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:00.180
Bree: We need several cleats.
Gary: We have three different types of cleats

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:01.180
that we use. We have the simple cleat
that fits inside of the two bags.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:02.180
Then we have another cleat
That fits up against a window. Then we have

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:03.180
a third kind that we use. They have kinda
an L shape.

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:04.180
Shae: We made over 40 cleats.
I can make mine really fast but Bryson

00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.180
he put like a bazillion nails in there.
Bryson: And then when your done putting nails

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.180
on this side, you flip it over so the nails
stick up like this

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.180
Bryson: When you're doing the cleats, you
can put like 5 nails in it or like 20

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:08.180
and I was just putting mine in and I had them
beautifully

00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.180
Nice. In a row. Everything symmetrical, perfect.
And Shae was just bam, bam, bam, done. Bam,

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.180
bam, bam, done.
Shae: 21 left.

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.180
Shelly: Wow.
Bree: 2x12 Window Frames are also needed.

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:12.180
Gary: Found on craigslist a couple of great,
brand new windows

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.180
a 4x3 and a 2x2. Cost us $120 for both windows.
Bryson: Windows, you know.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.180
Bryson: We'll be using these for the steps
and window frames. 2x12s and 2x10s

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:15.180
Gary: The size of a window is static, meaning
it's usually a half of inch shorter

00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.180
so that it will set inside of a window frame.
In our case, we could just make the frames

00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:17.180
3x5, 3x4 and so on
Gary: I use three 2x6s and just nailed them

00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:18.180
together as a big header.
Shae: Why do these things have to be together?

00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.180
Gary: These are headers that go above the
window.

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.180
Help support the weight of the roof.
So that we're not putting the weight of the

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.180
roof over the top of the window itself.
Bree: Steps are next.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:22.180
Gary: Okay, these are the threads for our
stairs

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.180
2x10s
They'll be nine and a half treads.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.180
Here, come with me. I'll show you how it goes
on.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:25.180
It will all go up
every two rows

00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.180
we're gonna have one step coming up
and a circle going all the way up to there.

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:27.180
Gary: Inside the walls, we of course ran nails
up and ran nails down, similar to how we do

00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:28.180
our cleats.
We chose to bring that out and let it just

00:39:28.180 --> 00:39:29.180
kinda free hang
and maybe just a small, temporary post underneath

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:30.180
of it.
Shelly: We also are gonna have bottles prepared.

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:31.180
We're gonna put in little bottle windows as
the steps go up

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:32.180
Bree: Lastly, a center pole is placed for
measuring.

00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.180
Gary: We place a pole in the center of the
building

00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.180
An inch and a half pipe that runs completely
up about 9, 10 feet

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.180
Now, we have a nice pole that runs through
the center of the building

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.180
to be able to gauge the circular bags as they
go around.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.180
Bree: The lightning storms are bringing additional
challenges.

00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.180
Bryson: This is what happens when it gets
too wet.

00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:39.180
Water starts bubbling up
the sides and it gets really slushy

00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:40.180
like you can't bag on top of that. It's jello.
Gary:If that doesn't dry out, we're going

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.180
to be in trouble.
Bryson: My awesome room.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.180
Dah Dah Dah!
You can see Dad by it.

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:43.180
We put in the arch
We're going to put up that arch there.

00:39:43.180 --> 00:39:44.180
We put in one step to
go up

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:45.180
to the top of that
Bree: Our friends arrive to help build Bryson's

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.180
building. However, immediately, we experience
a problem.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.180
A storm hits the night before dropping two
inches of rain.

00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:48.180
Bree: So Dad, what happened?
Gary: We had a 2 inch rain and soaked our

00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:49.180
bags
Gary: Trying to maneuver them around a little

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:50.180
bit
and we end up with half the wall collapses

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.180
on one side.
So we have to tear that all down. We have

00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:52.180
to go back to the foundation.
and we have to start over.

00:39:52.180 --> 00:39:53.180
Bryson: Restarting at the foundation was a
little discouraging.

00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.180
Bree: But the other one, the other circle's
okay Dad?

00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.180
Gary: Yeah, the other circle is okay.
Gary: So we start bagging as fast as we can

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.180
so when people show up
there's something to do when they get here.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.180
I think the night before, if there's a chance
of rain, we're definitely going to put tarps

00:39:57.180 --> 00:39:58.180
on.
Bree: I had this ingenious plan to split everyone

00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.180
up in teams. However, there's no way to evenly
divide

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.180
the work because the layers have to go up
in sync.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.180
But, that's our little secret.
Green Team mascot

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.180
Shelly: Wow, lots of enthusiasm.
Bryson: Oh yeah.

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:03.180
Shae: Our friends, Esther, Andrew, Deborah
and Peter came over to help us.

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:04.180
It was so much fun to work with them.
Bree: Faster than the speed of nature.

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:05.180
If there is a speed in nature.
Shelly: Do you know how slow nature is?

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.180
Andrew: It's too slow that's what it is.
Garen: We are the strength of the ocean.

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.180
Bree: That's right.
Shelly: Our favorite thing about building

00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:08.180
with earth bags is that all ages can participate
Bree: Hello, coming in at ...we don't know.

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:09.180
and team Blue
Bryson: We are going to win.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.180
Bree: Are you feeling it?
And then my, my home team right here.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.180
The Green
Shelly: Are you guys the Yellow team?

00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:12.180
Yeah, but what do we get Mom?
Shelly: It's a sign.

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:13.180
Bree: Hello, little bug.
Bree: We need to reinstall the electric

00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:14.180
Shae: Esther and I ducted tape the wheelbarrow
wheel and it surprising worked for quite some

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.180
time.
Shelly: We used our arms to measure how long

00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:16.180
we wanted the bags.
About 3 arms length.

00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.180
and we straighten out the barbed wire as much
as we can.

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.180
Our friend, Jackie helped me out.
We cut it in sections using bolt cutters and

00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.180
then it was laid between the bags.
Bree: The barbed wire springs into action

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:20.180
and Jackie is in the line of fire.
Gary: Some of my buddies from work showed

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.180
up
We had Scott, Alex, their son.

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.180
Malcom was here
Bree: Then our hero, Tom, shows up with Pizza!

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.180
Bree: After lunch we fixed the wall that had
fallen and were ready to go higher.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.180
Gary: Everything wasn't that so bad with all
that rain. All that dirt now was a bit damp.

00:40:24.180 --> 00:40:25.180
That made packing the new stuff a lot easier.
Shelly: It was pretty exciting to see that

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.180
first window frame coming in to be placed.
Bree: Whatcha doing Mom?

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:27.180
Shelly: I am putting in the bottle lights
for the steps.

00:40:27.180 --> 00:40:28.180
Bryson: Hello Camera.
Gary: How are you doing Rick?

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.180
I tell you, he really is a trooper. He came
over and jumped up on that wall

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.180
and just started working hard so thanks Rick!
Gary: You haven't fallen off yet?

00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.180
Rick: No vertigo.
Shelly: Is that rain?

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.180
Bree: Over here you can see a storm is threatening
But over here it's blue sky so you never know

00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:33.180
if we are going to get hit or not
Gary: Some of us are desk job people. We are

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.180
starting to slow down.
Bree: We are over waist high in bags, 3 window

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.180
frames are installed along with 4 steps.
Bree: Having friends over to help build the

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:36.180
earth bag walls is a real boost.
We're half way to the top

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:37.180
Let's take a look at the cost so far.
Shelly: We are continuing our one layer a

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:38.180
day
and as we get higher, we'll have to back that

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.180
down to about a half layer a day.
Gary: We stayed pretty diligent on maintaining

00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.180
the distance from the center pole
to the outside of the building.This is going

00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:41.180
to really help us when we get to the roof
at the very top.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.180
Bryson: Okay, so we're not nailing the cleats
in those until we get a little bit high

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.180
so we can level the windows.
Gary: That's a little different than we normally

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:44.180
do. We normally nail those cleats in as we're
going up.

00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:45.180
This time we're gonna wait until after done
with the roof.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:46.180
Bryson: And the building has to settle to.
Shelly: On the bags, we cut out about say

00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.180
a 15 foot length or so and then we turn them
inside out.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.180
and then we have to be careful that as we
lay them, the seams don't match up at the

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:49.180
same places.
Bryson: Our new addition to our farm.

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.180
Shelly: After the kids get settled in their
bedrooms, they get a pet.

00:40:50.180 --> 00:40:51.180
Garen's dog, Diesel, he just gets so excited.
Shae: He's a little black lab and he's so

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:52.180
playful. He gets into all the bags when we're
trying to work.

00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:53.180
Shelly: Aw. Rolly.
Shelly: Are you helping?

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.180
Shelly: The puppy is pooped.
Bryson: Play with the bag, a minute later,

00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:55.180
out.
Bryson: Look how solid these things are. Amazing.

00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.180
Bryson: Point them to the center pole
and we do every 2 bags

00:40:56.180 --> 00:40:57.180
Just enough for like one person you know.
Like a normal step is longer. We cut it down

00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:58.180
in size.
so it wouldn't take up most of the room

00:40:58.180 --> 00:40:59.180
Gary: We're using cleats inside the walls
for hanging pictures

00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:00.180
Shelly: It's really hard to know exactly where
gonna put those pictures so we put them everywhere.

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.180
Bryson: I tuck the end like a paper airplane
and then I'll step on that, curl it up and

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.180
lay it on my leg.
As they load in dirt, I just let it down.

00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:03.180
And then at the end, I'll fold it and set
it down.

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:04.180
Shelly: We put 2 quart jars together and then
we tape them down with duct tape so they don't

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:05.180
move around.
until we get the bags laid over the top

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:06.180
The jars will now create this natural lighting
for each step.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:07.180
Shelly: I wonder if we are going to run out
of barbs.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.180
Shae: We ended up using around a roll and
a half of barbed wire.

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:09.180
Shae: Wear jeans, it's advised.
Shae: Probably $70 a roll.

00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:10.180
Shelly: Second roll.
Bryson: We had to cover the bag building up

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.180
from the rain.
'cause it was making it soggy.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:12.180
Gary: After the last problem with the rain,
we tarp every time when we figure it's going

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:13.180
to start raining.
Gary: With the header, we level both sides

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.180
so we get a nice box around the frame.
Bryson: Are we going to lay a bag over the

00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:15.180
top of this?
Gary: Several bags actually.

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:16.180
Shelly: This is another place we added candy
jars so that some of the morning light can

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:17.180
come through.
Shae: And wave them in the air like you just

00:41:17.180 --> 00:41:18.180
don't care.
Shelly: As we get higher, we start to need

00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.180
more help to move that dirt up to the top.
Bree got in there and helped us out.

00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.180
Bree: My dog, Max, came out and helped us
out while we were working

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.180
He went out on the top of the earth bags with
us

00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:22.180
Bree: When your acrobats get you into places
you don't want to be.

00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:23.180
Shelly: Oh, he passed the steps again.
Bree: Oh, now I'm really scared.

00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:24.180
But I ended up having to go out and save him
because he couldn't get back down.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:25.180
It wasn't as if there were stairs or anything.
Bree: Hold onto your hats, 'cause it's about

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:26.180
to get one.
Gary: Because we have a circle, I wanted to

00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:27.180
put I wanted to put a design on top of it
the roof that's somewhat circular. So we laid

00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.180
our joists on 2 foot centers, like your would
a normal patio roof.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:29.180
Gary: We have 20 footers for the longest sections
in the circle.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.180
Gary: Our jig that we are going to use
The joists will run in this direction here

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.180
for the rafters on the roof for that flat
roof.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:32.180
and then we can adjust them up and down and
then cleat them in.

00:41:32.180 --> 00:41:33.180
on both sides and then when the bags lean
up against them, that will give them lateral

00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.180
strength this way.
and then these get all pinned in on the top

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.180
of the bags.
Gary: We have straight lines running north

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.180
and south
and then we needed to have joists that go

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:37.180
out perpendicular to the outside
put on there with joist hangers to help support

00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:38.180
the weight.
and then there were these little jacks that

00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:39.180
went off on a 45 from that.
Shelly: So just when we think we are done

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:40.180
bagging, we still have a little bit more bagging
to do

00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.180
in between each of the rafters.
The alternative to bagging is cobbing and

00:41:41.180 --> 00:41:42.180
that is not any fun to try to fill it with
cob.

00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:43.180
Bryson: 50 pound tamp
Shelly: Oh yeah, it's beautiful

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:44.180
Bryson: And this entire area out here is all
going to be the top decking.

00:41:44.180 --> 00:41:45.180
Gary: Since it's a deck we are going to be
walking on

00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.180
I wanted like a 3/4 inch material or 7/8 material
Gary: I need to do 2 bisections.

00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.180
Shelly: Gary can be working away and he just
seems to know

00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.180
when it's time to slow down and teach the
kids something.

00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.180
Gary: Two things, a square corner and bisecting,
you can split this up

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.180
into as many segments as you want to that
are all equal.

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:51.180
Gary: Pull up the plywood a little bit so
we can make our cuts

00:41:51.180 --> 00:41:52.180
put our facia board on
re-attach the plywood

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.180
and we have a segmented roof up here that
almost looks circular

00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:54.180
that's good
Bryson: Put telescope stuff on there and even

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.180
a bed maybe so we can sleep up there.
Gary: As usual, we're trying something new.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:56.180
I'm not used to a roofing material that isn't
like, asphalt or steel

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:57.180
We went to a professional roofer
and he suggested we us the 30 pound felt

00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.180
and 3 coats of snow roof.
Bryson: Here's what we're doing.

00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:59.180
We are taking this microfiber and we're laying
over

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:00.180
the creases and we're covering it with the
white roof coat.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:01.180
We ended up doing like 3 or 4 coats on there.
Shelly: The expenses are low until we get

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:02.180
to the roofing.
That's when the cost starts to really add

00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:03.180
up.
Bree: The front half of the building takes

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.180
a creative shape
Gary: It's more conical.

00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.180
Kind of a tilted cone
to give enough room for the inside to have

00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.180
stairs.
they run up alongside and a door that goes

00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:07.180
out to the flat roof.
Bryson: These go up there

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.180
for the door.
Gary: The door requires 2 posts be installed

00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:09.180
on top of the flat roof.
Bryson: This is really how high we gotta go

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:10.180
all the way
Gary: Then we can run the bags along the sides

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.180
right up to those posts.
There are now tall bags on one side of the

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.180
roof
and shorter bags on the other because we're

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.180
stair stepping them up
to allow for the cone shaped roof.

00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.180
Bryson: We old tent poles
and double barbed

00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.180
to help strengthen the walls when they get
really high.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:16.180
The platform is right at the top of the stairs
so that we can open up a door up there

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.180
and get out onto the main deck outside.
Gary: It just glues it right on there so we

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.180
don't
have any problem with squeaking.

00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.180
Bryson: We use the same type of cleat system
that we used on the other roof.

00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:20.180
Gary: We choose one of the door posts
at the top of the other room to be kinda a

00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.180
center post.
Bryson: Before we put the plywood on we're

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.180
going to
have to bag up all around the outside edges

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.180
so that it's flush with the plywood.
Booyah!

00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.180
We're closing in on the last little bit here
in the very, very corner.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.180
It's right there and bagged all the way across
here.

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.180
and it makes it really nice. It closes in
the whole section.

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.180
It's pretty cool.
The last bag we will probably ever put up.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.180
Right there.
Gary: Bryson and I go brain dead.

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.180
trying to get this facia on the outside
of this cone shaped roof.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.180
There's a lot of compound angles
and I'm making calculations errors.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.180
I got 2 facia boards up and we had to quit.
Garen notices how frustrated I was

00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.180
and feels sorry for me
so the next day, he's out there helping.

00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.180
He's helped us with the angles and bevels
up here

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.180
and its made a great difference this morning.
Bryson: If it wasn't for him we'd all be doomed.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.180
Bryson: The sheeting up there
is like a puzzle.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.180
It's so unique that we have to cut all these
odd angles

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.180
and we're doing angles, you know, when you
have an

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.180
angle this way and you have an angle that
way.

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.180
Anyway, these weird angles we keep cutting
and phew, those are hard to figure out.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.180
Bree: We bought the wood for conical roof
frame all in one shot. The cost?

00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.180
Gary: We're putting up a 6x6 porch
Bryson: We got some posts instead of going

00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.180
down
to the forest and chopping them down

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.180
we bought them at the store.
There really straight

00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:44.180
Gary: Unlike Bree's right?
Bree has these skinny little things, there

00:42:44.180 --> 00:42:45.180
real strong.
It's all mesquite wood but it's just a totally

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.180
different look.
Next thing we do is get all the trim around

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:47.180
the edges.
The metal rain drip trim

00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.180
and then finish paper, then we're ready for
the Ondura.

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:49.180
Bryson: We went with the Ondura 'cause it's
not as difficult to cut.

00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:50.180
It's suppose to last really long. Right now
its

00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.180
been up to a about a year on Garens' room.
And it seems to look the same as when we first

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.180
put it on, actually.
Gary: No fading

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.180
Bryson: Yeah, no fading at all.
Gary: So the product seems to be pretty solid.

00:42:53.180 --> 00:42:54.180
We're still not sure.
Shelly: That's an interesting way to hammer.

00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:55.180
Gary: Painful, to watch.
Bryson: Bam, bam, bam, done.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:56.180
Shae: While the guys worn the roof, me and
Mom

00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.180
decided to start with the stucco.
Gary: To prepare for the gals going around

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.180
the corner
there with the stucco. We need to have the

00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.180
windows complete
so they can bring the stucco right up next

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:00.180
to the trim.
Gary: We built these particular frames where

00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.180
they are
not attached to the bags or the header

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.180
Bryson: We're not going to do these windows
loose any more I don't think.

00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.180
Gary: No, we're not doing them loose anymore.
Shae: They have the windows framed so we're

00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.180
going
to start stuccoing at least one of these circles.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.180
We've decided on stucco because it holds up
better in the rain.

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:06.180
Shelly: Bryson was up tamping 2 rows up from
the glass

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:07.180
and to our shock, it cracked.
Bree: I've found what we should put in there.

00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.180
Shelly: Oh my goodness.
Shae: That's way too big.

00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:09.180
Shelly: We'll make it work.
Shelly: Perfect fit.

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.180
Bree: Look at that.
Shelly: It's a perfect fit.

00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:11.180
Bree: How are we going to get that in there?
Bryson: Wearing my glasses for protection

00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:12.180
of her eyes.
Shelly: I got eye protection. I got "Bry"

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.180
protections.
Shae: It feels like the stucco goes really,

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:14.180
really slow.
Shelly: But we have been plugging away every

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.180
day
we do, you know, a couple batches

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.180
Shae: I keep getting dropped on.
Shelly: Part of educating our kids is to spend

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.180
about
an hour a day doing some sort of physical

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:18.180
work.
Gary: You know it's really important to have

00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:19.180
the kids complete something.
There's nothing like finishing a project and

00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:20.180
having that sense of accomplishment.
Shelly: One of the benefits of the earth bag

00:43:20.180 --> 00:43:21.180
buildings
is that when they get done, they get a bedroom.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.180
Shae: We started looking back it and
it looks like we've gone like super far

00:43:22.180 --> 00:43:23.180
so obviously now that we're in the lead,
we're gonna make it a game and beat the boys.

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:24.180
Shelly:Yep.
Gary: The idea that the ladies can beat us

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.180
is a little unusual because we're really good
and very fast. And the Ondura goes up real

00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:26.180
quick.
Bryson: And we can hammer those nails like

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.180
nobodies business. Bam, done.
Gary: However, just to make them feel better,

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:28.180
we ran out of materials.
Bryson: Yeah.

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:29.180
Garen: We can really slow them down Bryson
is not

00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:30.180
to get the door done.
Bryson: Oh, because they can't cob around

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:31.180
the door
'til we're done.

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:32.180
Bree: Mom and Shae are racing to get the stucco
up

00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:33.180
before Dad and Bryson can finish the door
and roof.

00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:34.180
but, before they can get out there
the weather takes a turn for the worst.

00:43:34.180 --> 00:43:35.180
Shelly: Ut oh Shae, this may put a damper
on our victory dance.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.180
Bree: Meanwhile Bryson and Dad are working
inside.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.180
Bryson: We got a really good deal on a wooden
door.

00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.180
Gary: We only paid about $75 bucks for the
door on craigslist.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.180
Bryson: My friend Andrew came over and he
helped out.

00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.180
Bryson: I'm gonna spray paint these bolts
so they are black.

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.180
And stick them in the holes,
tighten them down, grind the tips off.

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.180
The door had 48 bolts
and nuts

00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:43.180
and washers.
Bryson: There's a lot of washers.

00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.180
Gary: I had to build a frame for it.
Bryson: Dad, it looks like you cut it right.

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.180
Gary: Oh, well amazing that.
Gary: Then assemble the door to the frame.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.180
Which means cutting in the joints for the
hinges and

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.180
and do some dado cuts
and relieving, chiseling

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.180
and then set the door inside there.
Shae: We used cob for Bree's room

00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:49.180
but cob requires a roof protection
Shelly: And also some sort of way of protecting

00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:50.180
it
linseed oil or paint

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.180
Shae: We decided to use stucco which doesn't
wash away in the rain

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:52.180
My friend, Esther,
Esther: Hi

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:53.180
Shae: Was so much fun to have her over here.
Shae: You do it, I'll watch.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:54.180
I'm just going to have to invite her every
time.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.180
Bree: We use 10 or so bags of cement.
Bree: The gals are the clear winners

00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.180
'cause the the ridge caps for the roof won't
arrive until next week.

00:43:56.180 --> 00:43:57.180
Gary: We'd like to NOT admit that the ladies
beat us because

00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:58.180
Bryson: Oh they didn't beat us
Gary: That's not even fair. We didn't have

00:43:58.180 --> 00:43:59.180
all our stuff. It's still on order.
Bryson: We didn't have all our materials.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.180
Shelly: Hey, but we won.
Shae: We did win.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.180
Garen: The reason they lost was because Garen
was not there.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:02.180
Shae: Oh Sure.
Bree: Since we now know the roofing cost.

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.180
Gary: This isn't the door we're going to be
installing but

00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:04.180
we are going to be using this as a model.
The door up above is a slanted door at the

00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:05.180
top.
Bryson: We used 7 2x6 tongue and groove and

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:06.180
we
glued them together to make the door.

00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:07.180
Bryson: if I got up, this thing would go whoop.
Bryson:We used bolts to hold all the tongue

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:08.180
and groove boards together.
Gary: Originally we had decided we wanted

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.180
a round
window. Two half windows as one.

00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:10.180
But we discovered that the width of the windows
was

00:44:10.180 --> 00:44:11.180
just too much to take out of the center of
the door.

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.180
We'll go ahead and slide the windows this
way

00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:13.180
and then turn it like this so that we have
less of a width and we have enough room for

00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:14.180
the handle.
Bryson: Following the line to cut it out.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.180
We're using that tool to do it.
So we pre-drilled the hole there

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:16.180
and are able to stick our blade in.
Make sure the hole is on the inside of the

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:17.180
line too.
From there we are able to cut around the whole

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.180
thing.
Bryson: So let's go ahead and put it in.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:19.180
Gary: We're going to be using Butyl rubber
and this is a typical window sealant.

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:20.180
Instead of finding ways to clamp this into
the window

00:44:20.180 --> 00:44:21.180
or screw it into the window like you would
typically do.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:22.180
We're going to actually glue this little puppy
in

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.180
here with this Butyl rubber.
Shelly: Did you notice Bryson is not with

00:44:23.180 --> 00:44:24.180
us?
Gary: Decided to go off and go skiing

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:25.180
Bryson: I love you guys!
Gary: While it's drying, I devised a quick

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.180
and easy
system here. I'll do this on both sides.

00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:27.180
Then I can flip the door over and work on
the other side.

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:28.180
Gary: We hope that Bryson and the crew had
a great time skiing.

00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:29.180
Bryson: The door turned out a lot better than
what I thought it was going to be.

00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:30.180
Bryson: It fits!
Bryson: It acts almost like a skylight too

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.180
with the window
and so it lights the room real nice and stuff.

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:32.180
It's really, really cool.
Bree: We prepare to paint the exterior.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.180
Shelly: Before we start painting, Bryson moves
the dirt away from the building.

00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:34.180
And then we start taping everything off.
Windows, doors, bottle lights.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.180
Bryson: I'm gonna go ahead and go around and
seal all the cracks up above with this foam.

00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:36.180
Shelly: This paint is suppose to be one of
the best paints.

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.180
It's got UV protection and it's suppose to
be one coat

00:44:37.180 --> 00:44:38.180
over the stucco. Which is going to be interesting
to see if it really is.

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.180
It was a lot of money. A little over $200
which is way more than we normally pay for

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:40.180
paint.
We usually get the recycle paints and pay

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.180
$10.
Gary: We chose to do a different method of

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:42.180
painting this time around.
Typically, in the past we've used rollers

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:43.180
and it's taken us several days to work on
it.

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.180
We own an airless sprayer.
The advantages to having the airless sprayer,

00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:45.180
is
of course the biggest one, is time.

00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:46.180
Gary: Now, let's try the other bit.
Gary: I hadn't used this thing in years

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.180
so we had to get it in, get it cleaned up
take it apart, oil it

00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.180
We had things things all set up, flipped the
switch.

00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.180
Nothing happened. Bryson takes his multimeter
out

00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:50.180
has everything all hooked up. Says, it's the
switch.

00:44:50.180 --> 00:44:51.180
So he went ahead replaced the switch with
a little wall socket switch that you have

00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.180
at your house.
Bryson: Shut if off. Drum roll please.

00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:53.180
Gary: Oh yeah.
Bryson: Okay.

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:54.180
Gary: When the boys were young, I was really
involved in their problem solving but Bryson

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:55.180
no longer needs my help.
He really enjoys working with anything electronic.

00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:56.180
I just back away and let him do it.
Gary: I forgot how to use the sprayer.

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.180
So I gave the neighbor a call.
He gave me some quick instructions.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.180
We got it primed right.
Gary: Okay, thank-you.

00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.180
Gary: Do you think we're ready Bry?
Bryson: Gotta get the water out of it now.

00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.180
Bryson: It's a brown.
Gary: Beautiful.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.180
Gary: Alright, your going up.
Bryson: It was my job to paint.

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.180
Gary: The spray patterns and working with
how to spray

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.180
Bryson and I worked together and we got that
all figured out.

00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.180
Eliminating a lot of the overspray
Conserving our paint.

00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.180
Bryson: It was challenging to get up onto
those eves

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.180
but after awhile I got used to it.
Gary: Painting in the little corners and edges

00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.180
takes a lot of time.
With an airless sprayer.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.180
Got it right away.
Bree: I just want to show you this light switch.

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.180
This light switch proves My Little Homestead
was a part. This is our signature move.

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.180
We always put a light switch on electronics.
Anything we can't get to turn on, it gets

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.180
a light switch.
Bree: And it's the Garenster's job now.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.180
Bryson: Show off.
Bryson: Garen jumped in there and helped me

00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:13.180
out.
He always works really fast so it's like,

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.180
Oh Yeah.
Bryson: Alright, I think I got it.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:15.180
Bree: Pretty slick huh?
Bryson: Yeah.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.180
Gary: Cause it's kinda a thinner paint
so it went through that machine just perfectly.

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.180
Bree: An hour to paint the entire building.
So how do you think it went Dad?

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.180
Gary: What's that?
Bree: How do you think it went?

00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:19.180
Gary: Oh gosh this is the only way to do this.
Absolutely, It was great.

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.180
Shelly: There was probably about 2 inches
on the bottom of the bucket

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:21.180
so it did make it.
It painted the whole thing including the eves.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.180
And it's, it's a nice coat.
Shae: The majority of the painting is done

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:23.180
so now it's onto painting the trim
which is us girls job.

00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:24.180
We're using this brownish, purple color
'cause it's what we have.

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.180
And it's not going to cost anything.
The guys will be working on

00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.180
the trim around the door and the trim around
the patio.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:27.180
Shelly: Finishing up the trim guys? The last
of it?

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:28.180
Gary: The last of the trim.
Bree: The guys head inside to begin the soil

00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.180
cement subfloor.
Bryson: Soil cement is easy.

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:30.180
It's easier than laying normal cement. And
cheaper.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:31.180
Gary: It's kinda like dry pour with a fence
post.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:32.180
You know, you just pour your cement in, pour
some water in

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:33.180
and shazzam.
Bryson: Bam, it's done. The whole floor.

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:34.180
Gary: We have everything out of here right
now.

00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:35.180
Bryson: We level out the floor.
Gary: So we can begin to level this floor

00:45:35.180 --> 00:45:36.180
We want to level it about 3/4 inch down.
We're a little bit low on the backside so

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.180
we had to bring in some dirt
in to level it.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.180
Bryson: Diesel has been a big help
Gary:Sure.

00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:39.180
Shelly: He has?
Gary: Oh yeah, he's a wet dog.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:40.180
Bryson: He's been breaking up the dirt for
me.

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:41.180
He was digging holes and it was making all
the dirt loose so I could scoop it.

00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.180
Bryson: Good Boy.
Gary: Think how many muscles we are building.

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.180
Shelly: Yeah.
Gary: Yeah.

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:44.180
Bryson: Better than working out.
Shelly: Were you thinking about working out?

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:45.180
Lifting weights?
Bryson: No. Why would I? I'm doing this.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.180
Shelly: Wow, Gary.
Okay, I dare you to go up there now.

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:47.180
Gary: Walk up the sides.
Shelly: No, no, I'm just kidding.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.180
Gary: No really. You just walk up the side
like this.

00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:49.180
Shelly: Gary.
Gary: As long as you stay close to the sides.

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.180
Gary: Okay Bryson, you're the dirt thrower.
I need dirt right here.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:51.180
Gary: You have to have enough dirt in the
room.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.180
to get to your level spot.
Gary: Okay Bry, let's do our string thing.

00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.180
Bryson: Okay.
Bryson: Your string was in my way.

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:54.180
Gary: No, your dirt was in my string line.
Gary: We measure periodic spots

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:55.180
around the floor with a line level
to make sure we're up to speed.

00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:56.180
Gary: Found a guy selling a
Shelly: Craigslist wasn't it?

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.180
Gary: Yeah, he was selling lawn mowers and
little tillers and stuff.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.180
and this was just perfect size for us.
Shelly: Yeah, it 's a smaller one than last

00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.180
time.
Gary: The idea is to put in about 1/2 inch

00:45:59.180 --> 00:46:00.180
to 3/4 inch
of Portland cement.

00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:01.180
Then we bring the tiller in.
and we till it down about 4 inches

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.180
working the Portland cement into the soil,
making soil cement.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.180
Bryson: Pulling it backwards is actually better
than

00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.180
having it go forward. Forward did not work
very well.

00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:05.180
It was like rolling on top of the ground.
But, if you pulled back it, it would dig into

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:06.180
the ground nice.
Gary, We water it down, tamp it,

00:46:06.180 --> 00:46:07.180
and then screet it and tamp it and kind of
work with it

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.180
until its all nice and flat
and then it gets watered for 3 days periodically

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:09.180
we'll come in and spray some water on it.
Gary: It's a nice, rough subfloor. Cob goes

00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:10.180
over the top of it.
Bree: The next step is to complete the walls.

00:46:10.180 --> 00:46:11.180
Cob is the material of choice.
Shelly: The kid's grandparents had a septic

00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.180
dug
so they needed a place to put the dirt and

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:13.180
we said,
Oh yeah, just throw it on our property.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.180
A few years later we started to build these
buildings and

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:15.180
doing cob and we came back to look at this
and

00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.180
sure enough if this wasn't clay. So we've
got this big clay pile that we've been using

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:17.180
for years
Shae: We use a mixture of sand and clay.

00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.180
This time though we did add some of our dirt
which is kinda like if you put it in a cup,

00:46:18.180 --> 00:46:19.180
you know how you can tell where the
clay and the sand separate. We're about half

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:20.180
and half on our dirt so
we threw some in some of that and made it

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:21.180
extra sticky.
We cobbed in between the creases because we

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:22.180
had a
new system of doing it this round. We are

00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:23.180
going to try
spraying the cob

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:24.180
Bree: I am slapping mud up on the walls, apparently.
Shae: Sunshine and butterfies.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.180
Shelly: We're doing good guys, we got this
room chinked in.

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.180
Shelly: It's looking just ducky.
Bree: Just washed these so I could wear them

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:27.180
last night.
They were amazing.

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:28.180
Isn't there a rubber ducky song?
Shelly: Rubber Ducky - it's a Sesame Street

00:46:28.180 --> 00:46:29.180
Bree: Your the one.
Shelly: It's a Sesame Street song but you

00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:30.180
can't sing it. It will probably be copyright
infringement.

00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.180
Bree: No, it's only the original track.
Shelly: Oh, let's hear it then.

00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.180
Bree: Rubber Ducky you're the one.
You make bath time ...super fun?

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:33.180
I don't know.
Shelly: He can't hear me 'cause he has head

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:34.180
sets on
Bryson: What?

00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:35.180
Shelly: Do the headsets make you go faster?
Bryson: I think they do.

00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:36.180
Shae: We're done.
Gary: Instead of all the time we put the mud

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:37.180
on the walls.
We thought we would try this idea of spraying

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.180
it on like stucco.
But I don't have a stucco sprayer.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.180
Bryson: No. We have a sheetrock mud sprayer.
We did try it. It failed the first time.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.180
Gary: Yeah, it was very bad.
Gary: It is an experiment so testing different

00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:41.180
ways of doing things
Bryson: Ready to test?

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.180
Gary: Gonna go with the 3 to 1 mixture
of sand and cement

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.180
Bryson: There's a pipe that's in here that
goes out to the end

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.180
And the problem was, it was restricting the
mud from

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.180
going out of the end. It was used for thinner
mud.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:46.180
We just cut it back.
We're going to see.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:47.180
Look where mud is at.
mud at the tip.

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:48.180
Bryson: So we made a couple of modifications
to it

00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.180
and it worked.
Shelly: Wow, that's fantastic.

00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:50.180
Shae: It saved a ton of time.
I like putting on cob up. It's really soothing

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:51.180
and nice but
I don't think any of us but the sprayer could

00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:52.180
stay in the room.
'cause it was so loud.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:53.180
Shelly: The texture is really rough.
We tried to soften it with the tool

00:46:53.180 --> 00:46:54.180
and knock it off by hand.
Bree: I think it came out pretty good.

00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:55.180
Bree: I don't know what I was expecting
but, I mean, that's sure a whole lot of work

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.180
saved.
Shelly: We eventually just used the broom

00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.180
to brush it off.
We didn't want to go over the entire walls

00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.180
again
flattening it out so we decided to just go

00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.180
with the rough look. Bryson was happy with
it

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.180
so that's the main thing.
Shae: A lot of cob fell off the wall.

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:01.180
I mean a lot of it made it on the wall but
a lot fell too so we just had to pick that

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.180
up
at the end of days works and

00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.180
we put it in wheelbarrows and we'd use it
the next day.

00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:04.180
Gary: Probably one of the most imprtant things
about us is

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:05.180
not that all the corners are all straight
and the walls are all perfectly round.

00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:06.180
Shelly: Family project.
Gary: Yeah, it's more of family thing or family

00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:07.180
time
together. It's really important to us.

00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.180
Shelly: A lot of times you just want to jump
in there.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.180
If the kids are going to join in
and be a part of it, you just got to let it

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.180
go.
Gary: Um hum. We keep things within safe tolerances

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.180
There's just something about the roof falling
in on the

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.180
children when we're not there that could be
bad

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.180
Shelly: Right but you would jump in if it
was a safety issue.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:14.180
Gary: Oh yeah, absolutely.
Bree: Next, we prepare for painting.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:15.180
Shelly: We needed to buy brand new paint because
we wanted to us the sprayer again to spray

00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:16.180
the interior walls
so when I was at the store,

00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.180
I found a 5 gallon bucket of paint on sale.
It was clearance for like $35

00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:18.180
and it was interior, it was semi-gloss.
It was everything that we needed and I just

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.180
couldn't resist.
There was only one draw back and that is um

00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.180
Bryson: Oh my gosh.
Shelly: It was pink.

00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:21.180
Shelly: What?
Bryson: I see lots of pink.

00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.180
Bryson: Pink? It was pink.
Shelly: It has a pink hue

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.180
Bryson. It was pink.
Shelly: I ..I ..it ..it, maybe it's more

00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.180
Bryson: Pink
Shelly: Not maybe pink but salmon.

00:47:24.180 --> 00:47:25.180
Bryson: Pink.
Shelly : We needed to convert the pink color

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:26.180
and we wanted it to be a light brown
so we looked it up and we found out in order

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:27.180
to
change the color, we needed both yellow and

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:28.180
blue.
Bryson: We ended up adding green and saving

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.180
the day.
Shelly: We just kept adding that green color

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.180
and Bryson would mix it until we got a color
that

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.180
actually turned out to be a really nice brown
color.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:32.180
Bree: With the paint dilemma solved,
Bryson can now get to painting.

00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:33.180
Bryson: Aw man, I really like this paint.
It's not that pink that I was worried about.

00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.180
Go upstairs.
There we go. There's the whole room.

00:47:34.180 --> 00:47:35.180
Bree: Dad begins the planning.
Gary: Close in, in 1x3s.

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.180
to create a frame underneath the stairs.
Shae: I'm helping you out Dad.

00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:37.180
Gary Thanks Honey.
Gary: I'm gonna cut something now.

00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.180
Shelly: What are you making?
Gary: A thingy.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:39.180
Gary: No profoundness.
Gary: The closet under the stairs was

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.180
something to help support the other side
of the steps themselves.

00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:41.180
What was really cool about the cedar is that
we found

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:42.180
fence boards, inexpensive ...what 97 cents
for each piece

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:43.180
so it was real cheap to be able to put that
on.

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:44.180
The risers are all built underneath
so they kinda set inset, underneath

00:47:44.180 --> 00:47:45.180
using 1x3 material.
And then on the outside, the walls actually

00:47:45.180 --> 00:47:46.180
built
on a curve, in small sections just underneath

00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.180
the stairs.
So it looks like a curve but really it's a

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.180
series of straight lines.
And then we put the cedar boards on the outside

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:49.180
for a nice look.
to kinda finish it off.

00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:50.180
Shelly: Staining this with some golden pecan.
That's what Bryson wants.

00:47:50.180 --> 00:47:51.180
Bryson: Yep. So beautiful.
Gary: And then put a door on the end.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:52.180
Shae: Aw geez, when little kids come over
this is going to be a great place to hide.

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:53.180
Gary: Okay, these are my boards for the door
that's

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:54.180
going to go to the closet.
3/4 inch x 6 inch tongue and groove.

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.180
One side is surfaced with a rough surface,
the other

00:47:55.180 --> 00:47:56.180
side is smooth.
We are going to have rough surface out

00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:57.180
since all wood around it is all the same.
Put the cross braces on in similar fashion.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.180
We're going to design it the same way
as we designed the front door that we had

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.180
in the upstairs door.
Gary: We're going to install this bedroom

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:00.180
door handle.
It's black to match our hinges and so on.

00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.180
It is 3/4 inch material so I have to put a
block on the other side.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:02.180
so that this has something to go into.
Shelly: Paint these all black so they match.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:03.180
This is flat black just like did the other
bolts.

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:04.180
Bryson: Cool. And then the door is gonna have
bolts.

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:05.180
Gary: It goes in like this, remember how we
had the other ones done?

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:06.180
I bought one for each one of the panels.
We'll be drilling a bolt in each one of these.

00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.180
Kinda give it that same look and feel.
Gary: These were a little short so we're counter

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:08.180
sinking them.
Gary: You'll have to close the door a little.

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:09.180
Gary: There, see like that. Up just a touch.
Might be a little adjustment

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.180
Let's look at it though
Gary: I love garage sales. Shell picked up

00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.180
a belt sander
I've been wanting one of these things for

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.180
years.
Paid a couple bucks for it.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:13.180
Gary: We just need to put the striker plate
on and the door is done.

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:14.180
Bryson: And a stopper don't you think, Dad?
To stop it.

00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.180
Bree: While Dad was installing the closet.
Bryson is laying the floor on the landing

00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:16.180
using left over materials.
Bryson: I used some left over flooring material.

00:48:16.180 --> 00:48:17.180
Bryson: Drawing out the pattern.
I'll go trim it out.

00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.180
Gotta get this as tight against that wall
as possible.

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.180
Bryson: The flooring locks together with tongue
and groove.

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.180
Bryson: Alright Dad.
Dad: That really looks good.

00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:21.180
Bryson: I trim it out using 1x2.
It's an easy install.

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:35.569
Bree: It's ceiling time.
Shelly: For our ceiling we like to collect

00:48:35.569 --> 00:48:38.460
pallets and
that's probably our favorite ceiling

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:42.779
is the pallet ceilings. They worked out
really well for us and we've used them on

00:48:42.779 --> 00:48:47.880
on about 3 projects now.
Our resource for pallets are beging to run

00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:48.880
a little dry.
Gary: Dried up.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:54.319
Shelly: So I had this idea
that I wanted to get, you know, like the wood

00:48:54.319 --> 00:48:57.030
floor.
Like what you those little planks.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:59.529
And I thought if I could find some on Craisglist
used

00:48:59.529 --> 00:49:03.369
maybe we could find a chunk of them
and be able to use them up on the ceiling.

00:49:03.369 --> 00:49:06.160
You just wanted to make sure that is was real
wood.

00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.480
Gary: Wood.
Shelly: That was the mainthing for you.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:13.180
I saw somebody selling over 300 square feet.
And they wanted a little over $100 for it.

00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.550
Gary: Yeah, cheap.
Shelly: So, we discussed it and we thought

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:17.619
we'll go
look at these things. We couldn't tell from

00:49:17.619 --> 00:49:19.809
the ad
if it was actual wood or not.

00:49:19.809 --> 00:49:23.279
And if it was what we wanted. we would offer
$100 for it.

00:49:23.279 --> 00:49:25.390
We get there, and the guy who was selling
it, and

00:49:25.390 --> 00:49:28.750
I said, "Is it wood?"
And he said it's laminate.

00:49:28.750 --> 00:49:32.250
So I looked over at Gary
and I said, "Laminate?"

00:49:32.250 --> 00:49:36.720
And you affirmed that is was laminate.
So I'm thinking, Laminate

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:40.359
You know, wood
Is there not laminated wood?

00:49:40.359 --> 00:49:43.190
Gary: Yeah, plywood is laminated.
Shelly: So I looked at him and said, "Would

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:45.210
you take $100 for it?"
And he said, "Yeah."

00:49:45.210 --> 00:49:47.260
We had to back the car up. We get in the car
Gary: Oh boy.

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:49.790
Shelly: I was like, "What's wrong?"
Gary: We didn't get wood.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:53.170
Shelly: But you went along with it anyway.
Gary: I did. I don't have to be a wood snob.

00:49:53.170 --> 00:50:00.539
Shelly: Yeah, you are... He is a wood snob.
Gary: This way we get the floor on the ceiling.

00:50:00.539 --> 00:50:05.620
Gary: Well with our new idea of making a floor
a ceiling.

00:50:05.620 --> 00:50:08.160
Gary: I guess that's how it's going to go
in.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:09.680
I've never hung flooring on a ceiling.
Kinda new to me.

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:11.180
A little different.
Not sure how to finish that off but we'll

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.980
figure out something.
Bryson, take that one right there.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:20.220
That might work here. I don't know.
Gary: It's kinda like a uni-click.

00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.450
Where all 4 sides of the
planks lock in.

00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:26.589
Shelly: That's beautiful.
Gary: So you have to have all your

00:50:26.589 --> 00:50:29.840
seams have to be perfect.
Because we can't get it to really hang up

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.510
there.
We do have nail it in because

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:35.869
we can't walk. In case you're walking up there,
you don't want it to move on you.

00:50:35.869 --> 00:50:38.299
So you nail it down.
Bryson: Put some insulation up there.

00:50:38.299 --> 00:50:42.000
Gary: Do a little bit at a time. Insulation
Little bit at a time, insulation

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.480
We're putting in R-30 insulation.
Bryson: R-30 instead of R-35

00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:49.080
Gary: R-31 1/2
Yeah, that's hard to find.

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:53.660
Shae: This is Not insulation.
It is the devil's cotton candy.

00:50:53.660 --> 00:50:58.380
The most feared, itchy
Yet strangely beautiful in color.

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:07.000
Bryson: I hope I got the angle right.
Shae: Bryson did a great job cutting the edges

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.640
but there's still a gap between the wall and
the ceiling.

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:14.819
We decided to use spray foam to fill the gap.
Because of the rough wall we were able to

00:51:14.819 --> 00:51:19.450
do it.
Shelly: We're just going to try to blend it.

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:25.609
We can fake this to make this look like cob.
Shae: Painting the foam here.

00:51:25.609 --> 00:51:33.290
Trying to blend it in with the wall.
Shae: And it turned out pretty good.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:40.650
Bryson: Shae's washing the ceiling
Shae: I'm washing the floor.

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:42.810
Gary: You know you need a mop.
Bryson: Oh yeah, beautiful. Look at that.

00:51:42.810 --> 00:51:45.579
Shelly: We started to run out of laminate
flooring

00:51:45.579 --> 00:51:47.520
and we knew we weren't going to be able to
make it

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:50.789
on that second circle.
So we decided to buy another batch

00:51:50.789 --> 00:51:53.280
'cause we knew we wouldn't be able to match
it exactly.

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:57.829
The colors are similar but the front building
is a little bit lighter.

00:51:57.829 --> 00:52:01.410
This time we made a better deal and
ended up getting more and paying less for

00:52:01.410 --> 00:52:03.690
it.
Bryson: The back circle was flat and then

00:52:03.690 --> 00:52:07.609
the front circle was angled.
Bryson: We're going to span a distance from

00:52:07.609 --> 00:52:12.510
this side
over to this pole here.

00:52:12.510 --> 00:52:16.740
Bryson: I had cut angles to each individual
piece.

00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:19.960
It was all segmented out so that each section
was flat.

00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:24.380
And then they all kinda just came around.
Shelly: This part over here, Bryson's really

00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:28.650
looking forward to.
Bryson: Right here

00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:34.250
we only have a pole here but no pole out here.
But they'll be just fine because they interlock.

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:39.880
So they hold each other in as they
as they go down.

00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:42.779
Bryson: It was a fan and it had a light on
it.

00:52:42.779 --> 00:52:43.890
Officially an unboxing video of a fan.
Bree: It's your biggest fan.

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:47.500
Gary: Take a pair of pliers and bend those
to fit

00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:51.730
and it'll be fine.
Gary: Don't do too much because these are

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:55.810
just spot welded
in there. I don't want that to come loose.

00:52:55.810 --> 00:52:58.000
But, just these pieces.
Bryson: Gotcha.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.640
Gary: Perfect.
Bryson: Okay, okay, hang on. I got this.

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:06.060
Bryson: I was trying to put a screw in.
Um hmm.

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:10.559
Yep. And it was tall.
And I just kinda got a little frustrated with

00:53:10.559 --> 00:53:12.220
it.
So I ..yeah

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:17.940
Garen had to save me.
Garen: What? What was that?

00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:25.750
What was that Bryson? Huh? Huh?
Bryson: He's probably better with drill than

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:29.850
I am.
I can beat him any day in 3D printing so

00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:36.590
Gary: Very nicely done.
Shelly: Is that it?

00:53:36.590 --> 00:53:45.010
On no there's one spot left.
Shae: Yeah, I know

00:53:45.010 --> 00:53:52.460
That's it. I'm giving up right there.
Shelly: You're gonna leave that one piece?

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.200
Shae: Yeah.
Shelly: That is so nice of you.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:02.170
Shae: Thank-you. Yeah, it is nice of me.
Bryson: Done.

00:54:02.170 --> 00:54:07.309
Gary: We're going to have to extend the fan
light pole

00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:10.329
that drops down from the ceiling because
Bryson: The roof is so steep

00:54:10.329 --> 00:54:12.819
Gary: in that section.
Bryson: The fan would just hit the roof. Thump,

00:54:12.819 --> 00:54:16.970
thump, thump.
Shelly: We're just staining. These are the

00:54:16.970 --> 00:54:19.280
pieces
that are going to be - I guess we can them

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.280
trim
for the ceiling?

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:22.079
Bryson: Yeah
Shelly: That what we call them Bry?

00:54:22.079 --> 00:54:24.319
Bryson: They are going to fit up
Shelly: up on the ceiling

00:54:24.319 --> 00:54:28.329
Bryson: They are going to fit up in between
the seams

00:54:28.329 --> 00:54:32.010
up here on the roof.
They are going to cover up the creases up

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:37.059
there.
Bryson: Under the landing was just simple,

00:54:37.059 --> 00:54:44.140
flat stuff.
Put some cedar siding around the edges of

00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:46.839
the platform.
Looks pretty nice now.

00:54:46.839 --> 00:54:54.490
So that it will match the closet.
'Cause the closet is cool.

00:54:54.490 --> 00:55:08.329
Shelly: The cost 
of the insulation wouldn't change.

00:55:08.329 --> 00:55:11.190
Gary: It's just he cost of whatever we cover
the insulation with.

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:15.440
Pallets are free.
But there not totally free. We still have

00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:17.289
to go pick them up.
We still have to tear them down

00:55:17.289 --> 00:55:21.180
Shelly: We paid $100 for the first batch and
$75 for the other.

00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:26.760
So it ended up being $175 for the ceiling.
So the real savings, like you said is in the

00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.430
time savings that it had.
Gary: It was huge. I mean that was a lot of

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:30.430
work
pulling those apart.

00:55:30.430 --> 00:55:34.450
Shelly: It does take a long time to break
them down and...

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:37.440
We still like the pallets.
We just thought we would do this to do something

00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.829
a little different.
Gary: You know us, we like to try something

00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:41.829
different.
Bryson: I think the ceiling turned out really,

00:55:41.829 --> 00:55:45.980
really well.
Gary: Bryson, that looks so cool.

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.849
Gary: You know I like wood so you
might expect that I wouldn't like it but

00:55:49.849 --> 00:55:54.359
I actually do like what we are seeing there.
So, it's a nice look. It will be easy to maintain.

00:55:54.359 --> 00:55:56.460
Installation was pretty easy. So yeah, overall
good.

00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:00.579
Bree: It's onto the rocket stove.
A couple months back the guys began to plan

00:56:00.579 --> 00:56:03.410
where they're going to place it.
Gary: My thought was, firebox, can, a bench

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:04.410
and then you won't take off in the room too
much.

00:56:04.410 --> 00:56:08.710
Bryson: And we put a bench here.
Bree: They decide on the back circle.

00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:11.010
Gary: Probably won't need no more than, probably
this wide.

00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:14.049
Bryson: Our benches are usually straight but
we decided to give this one

00:56:14.049 --> 00:56:17.280
a little bit of a curve, match the wall.
Gary: Contours the wall.

00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.599
Bryson: What he said.
Gary: We bought the barrel at local oil changing

00:56:21.599 --> 00:56:23.619
business in town.
$5

00:56:23.619 --> 00:56:26.750
Bryson: It's good
Gary: We had the first design where we wanted

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:29.609
to use block but,
Bryson: The problem with this look

00:56:29.609 --> 00:56:34.173
this look is nice but
we have to cut all of them in half.

00:56:34.173 --> 00:56:36.609
Gary: So we gave up on that.
Shelly: I like those.

00:56:36.609 --> 00:56:39.390
Gary: We found some terra cotta that we had
acquired somewhere.

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:43.920
Gary: Another inch or two of cob seat.
Bryson: It's only going to be about that height.

00:56:43.920 --> 00:56:46.339
Bryson: We got the piping at the local hardware
store.

00:56:46.339 --> 00:56:53.190
Gary: At the end of our bench here
I wanted to put to be able to put a clean

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:56.559
out
so we can clean out in different areas.

00:56:56.559 --> 00:56:59.350
Gary: That will be plenty of room to get that
in.

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:01.369
Bryson: Dirt, lots of dirt.
Bryson: We were fortunate to already have

00:57:01.369 --> 00:57:05.829
some firebrick.
This is the base of the firebox.

00:57:05.829 --> 00:57:10.809
Gary: Putting brick along side that too.
so are you ready for that?

00:57:10.809 --> 00:57:14.650
Bryson: Yeah, I'm ready
Gary: Here's our opening down here.

00:57:14.650 --> 00:57:19.450
Come around this way here.
You might be able to get this to focus right.

00:57:19.450 --> 00:57:23.950
There we go.
Gary: A firebox that we push in from the front

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:28.470
as opposed to from the top.
Shelly: Okay, so the fire is in that little

00:57:28.470 --> 00:57:30.420
thing, huh?
Bryson: Um hmm.

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:33.260
Shelly: Okay.
Bryson: We built the firebox a little different

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.500
this time.
Instead of running the wood in from the top,

00:57:35.500 --> 00:57:40.380
we ran it from the side.
Shelly: Is this the opening that Dad is working

00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.640
on?
Gary: Yeah, and then the chimney stack comes

00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.490
up this way.
Shelly: Bryson got new boots.

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:51.119
Bryson: A bit dusty.
Shelly: So now you're feet aren't going to

00:57:51.119 --> 00:57:53.789
pop out on every video that we do.
With that bright orange.

00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:57.880
Bryson: They're going in my keepsake.
Shelly: They're going in your keepsake?

00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:01.160
Bryson: Yep.
Shelly: Okay.

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:09.380
Gary: 6 Inch height. We should go with 12
inches.

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:14.480
Bryson: We could go look at it. Do you want
us to go look at it?

00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:23.380
Bryson: So yeah. If we go 12 inches up from
the top of his barrel, which is here.

00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:27.359
Then that's about where it is on his.
Bryson: Garen's seems to work really well

00:58:27.359 --> 00:58:32.010
so we're going to go with a 12 inche one.
Which is pretty much simple mathematics.

00:58:32.010 --> 00:58:35.369
When you have a 6 inch pipe, you want to go
a 12 inch chimney.

00:58:35.369 --> 00:58:39.019
It's just 2 times.
Bryson: It's a 3 to 1 ratio that we used for

00:58:39.019 --> 00:58:46.269
the combustion chamber.
Gary: We sometimes have had like a smaller,

00:58:46.269 --> 00:58:48.930
like a 6 inch
and then maybe an 8 inch or 10 inch

00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:51.769
pipe around it.
But our barrel is not quite big enough for

00:58:51.769 --> 00:58:53.490
that.
Gary: We didn't really have materials around

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:56.280
the property.
Gary: Come up 2 inches and flare it.

00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.319
Bryson: Measuring out 14 inches so he can
flare these back an inch.

00:58:59.319 --> 00:59:03.200
I don't know what I just suggested but Dad
likes it.

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:08.560
Gary: So we literally built one.
Bryson: Three thick.

00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:14.540
Shelly: Locking them on.
Bryson: Um hmm.

00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:17.839
Gary: We tape them together with that great
metal tape

00:59:17.839 --> 00:59:20.410
which works really well.
Enough to at least set a form

00:59:20.410 --> 00:59:25.279
and then we use cob inside the chamber itself.
Gary: That's a combustion chamber that we

00:59:25.279 --> 00:59:28.180
built.
Gary: As far as the insulation - the insulation

00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:32.069
from the inside of the chamber to the out.
Gary: We have a minimum of 2 inches that we

00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:35.619
have from
the outside of the combustion chamber to the

00:59:35.619 --> 00:59:38.519
inside of the barrel
that sets over the top of it.

00:59:38.519 --> 00:59:41.260
Shelly: Two inch taller
Bryson: than the chamber.

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:44.950
Gary: So it would be 2 inches at the top
and minimum of 2 inches around

00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:48.410
Bryson: on the outside edge.
Bryson: It means I have to go get a new one.

00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:51.500
Shelly: It looks a little grinded down.
Bryson: Ringing ears and a barrel.

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:55.470
Bryson: Set it down.
This goes like this.

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:58.450
Wood in here.
Fire burning here.

00:59:58.450 --> 01:00:03.910
And air gets sucking into here
and then it goes trough this chamber,

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:08.029
and then the barrel is going to set on top
of it

01:00:08.029 --> 01:00:11.910
which is going to allow the fire to burn up
and around.

01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:13.359
It's gonna come down.
And it's going to exit out that way, come

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.589
down here.
Come back around the back

01:00:15.589 --> 01:00:28.029
and up and out.
Bryson: Diesel was chewing on these.

01:00:28.029 --> 01:00:52.990
Gray: At this point now we're trying to level
our combustion chamber.

01:00:52.990 --> 01:00:56.119
But also have to make sure
that we're within 2 inches from the top.

01:00:56.119 --> 01:00:57.990
One way to do that is I'm going to measure
up from here

01:00:57.990 --> 01:01:01.690
straight across and see where this fits.
It should fit about about ...hey look at that,

01:01:01.690 --> 01:01:04.590
9 1/2.
It comes up here 9 1/2 so we're good

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:08.670
getting our couple inches up at the top
which is what we want.

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:12.789
Gary: Kinda needs to sit where it needs to
sit.

01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:27.809
Bryson: The clean out on the end.
Gary: Right here we have some barbed wire.

01:01:27.809 --> 01:01:32.119
We need to go ahead and cut that loose
so I can get a pipe through.

01:01:32.119 --> 01:01:43.650
Bryson: There's a hole in the wall.
Gary: I think I have the angles right.

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:46.220
Bryson: We angled up the exhaust a little
bit up

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:50.440
as the pipe went on so the smoke would always
have an exit going up.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:59.140
Bryson: We're going to test
our fireplace out before we cover it all up

01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:03.440
just to make sure everything is built correctly.
Gary: Like we did on the other rocket stoves,

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.680
you don't need a lot of clearance between
the wall

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.980
and the stove pipe itself
because, there's not a lot of heat

01:02:08.980 --> 01:02:12.349
that's put off by the stovepipe.
The combustion chamber provides a really

01:02:12.349 --> 01:02:16.640
efficient burn. Burning a lot of the materials
there. A lot of heat is spent

01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.869
there, as the little bit of smoke
and little bit of moisture comes out of

01:02:20.869 --> 01:02:24.819
the combustion chamber. The bench
passively stores the heat from the combustion

01:02:24.819 --> 01:02:27.240
chamber exhaust.
Garen: You run it that big for

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.690
half hour, an hour...
Bryson: Just feel the heat. I mean that is

01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:31.470
awesome.
Shelly: Yeah, it's really nice.

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:34.390
Bryson: I should chuck more wood it there,
why? Because it's fun.

01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:37.279
Shelly: It will feel really good when it's
100 degree out.

01:02:37.279 --> 01:02:40.640
Shelly: Are you happy with this Bry?
Bryson: Yeah.

01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:46.339
Gary: We're just tamping this down.
Getting it into the corners.

01:02:46.339 --> 01:02:48.009
Making sure that we are filling up the entire
box.

01:02:48.009 --> 01:02:50.109
Bryson: Dad, this is awesome.
Shelly: So how much higher are you going to

01:02:50.109 --> 01:02:52.690
go with this Bry?
Bryson: We'll go about an inch higher than

01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:54.309
these bricks.
Shelly: Okay.

01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:57.670
Gary: The family artist is at work putting
together her

01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:03.039
re-creation of sculpting and molding
Trained, of course, by her famous Jack

01:03:03.039 --> 01:03:07.099
who helped bring her along
and make her the sculptor she is today.

01:03:07.099 --> 01:03:14.250
Shae: Dad, we're not bringing Jack back.
Shelly: Bryson doing a great job over here

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:17.430
too.
Kinda rounding if off.

01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:22.509
Looking good.
Gary: oh, that does look good.

01:03:22.509 --> 01:03:26.309
Shae: Jiggle it.
Bryson: Like jello.

01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:31.579
Shelly: Wow, that's beautiful.
Bree: After the cob is completed,

01:03:31.579 --> 01:03:32.920
Mom runs to get the tile bucket.
Shelly: Kind of a junky tile bin but let's

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.240
see if
put some tiles in there.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.930
What does Shae got going over here, a little
design.

01:03:36.930 --> 01:03:45.869
Shae: I'm just pushing 'em down. I hope they're
going to be alright.

01:03:45.869 --> 01:03:51.059
Shelly: It looks good Bry.
That's a nice look.

01:03:51.059 --> 01:03:53.930
Gary: Finishing up the flue.
The exterior flue coming out

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:57.710
and making an elbow turn.
Going up. Putting a little cap on top for

01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:59.400
rain.
Bryson: Metal taped it onto here.

01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.809
And then I bent this down
to try to keep wind out of the top here.

01:04:03.809 --> 01:04:07.690
Alright, we got it all finished up.
It's on there and perfect.

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:10.770
Bryson: There's the closet
and the rocket stove.

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:14.190
Right here.
Pipe going up and out.

01:04:14.190 --> 01:04:17.829
It's a very nice seat, it is.
And

01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:29.740
the glowing coals.
Bree: With the rocket stove complete, it's

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:45.780
time to move onto the cob floor.
Or it might be referred to as an earthen floor.

01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:50.210
Before we get started laying the cob floor,
we need to place the tiles on the steps,

01:04:50.210 --> 01:04:51.619
stairs,
and entry.

01:04:51.619 --> 01:04:54.740
Gary: Would like to make the steps a little
stronger.

01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:59.950
Cob has a tendency to break down.
So we tile the area that gets the harder work.

01:04:59.950 --> 01:05:03.289
I have concrete underneath
and then I'm cementing the tiles in

01:05:03.289 --> 01:05:08.369
to the steps.
Shelly: We've had these little brown tiles

01:05:08.369 --> 01:05:12.019
on the property since we bought this property.
What 10, 12 years ago Gary?

01:05:12.019 --> 01:05:14.940
Gary: Yeah.
Shelly: We may have found a use for 'em.

01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:18.260
Shelly: Okay, we're just laying some time
ideas out

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:21.590
for the entry.
Shae: We're putting these down with liquid

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:24.720
nails.
So that will be fun.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.350
Gary: This is a 15, 6.
Shelly: 15 sand, 6 clay?

01:05:29.350 --> 01:05:33.400
Garen: Yeah.
Gary: We did have to filter the clay.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.910
The sand was just perfect.
Garen: They just keep bringing me loads and

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:41.160
I would just smooth it all out,
get it all level.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:47.590
Gary: Also too Garen, this is the low side.
So the higher you want to make it, the better

01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:53.180
for the floor.
Garen: Okay.

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:58.089
Shae: Garen has just got this talent to
be able to level the floor with his eye

01:05:58.089 --> 01:06:02.540
and it just looks amazing
and it's smooth and it's a beautiful floor

01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:05.030
and
I'm gonna be honest,

01:06:05.030 --> 01:06:08.099
he is
almost as good as I am.

01:06:08.099 --> 01:06:11.549
Bree: Garen has a knack for leveling the floor
by eye.

01:06:11.549 --> 01:06:13.710
How do you do it?
Garen: Make sure that the room is real light

01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:16.470
so you can see
you know, what's higher and what's lower.

01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:19.369
If the room is all dark, you don't get the
glare off

01:06:19.369 --> 01:06:24.019
from the water, off the cob and
it always looks fairly close.

01:06:24.019 --> 01:06:26.930
You can see level a little better from the
shine.

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:31.089
It looks level when you walk around and you
kinda tilt your head.

01:06:31.089 --> 01:06:34.160
Gary: It looks...
Garen: Perfect.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:43.109
Shelly: One batch after another.
You got this thing going huh?

01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:49.849
Gary: They're punching the clay out so fast
and getting that cob floor installed.

01:06:49.849 --> 01:06:53.720
The work that I was trying to do was
get the steps tiled. At least to a point where

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:58.250
they could
cob up next to it. So I had stay ahead of

01:06:58.250 --> 01:07:02.440
them.
That was quite a challenge.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:08.730
Shelly: Wow. It looks complete.
Shelly: Are you hiding?

01:07:08.730 --> 01:07:16.070
Garen: I'm hiding. Yes.
Shelly: Gonna do some time lapse of the floor.

01:07:16.070 --> 01:07:21.269
Shelly: Gary, took off and got a snack, I
see.

01:07:21.269 --> 01:07:25.240
Gary: Peanuts.
Shelly: Peanuts, um, I would say it's a little

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:32.990
more than peanuts.
Gary: It might have a few m&amp;m's in there.

01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:50.220
Gary: I used my own mixture of cob,
with sand, clay and a couple little

01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:55.319
2 inch shovelfuls of cement.
Bryson: That was close

01:07:55.319 --> 01:08:08.380
Gary: It's just really good. Garen did a great
job.

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:15.339
Garen: It wasn't just me.
Bryson: Day 3 and we're waiting for it to

01:08:15.339 --> 01:08:16.690
dry.
We did put these bricks here to help keep

01:08:16.690 --> 01:08:22.680
the dogs out.
Bryson: The floor is finally dry after 4 days.

01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:26.330
Shelly: Cardboard keep our feet from scuffing
the floor up.

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:31.420
Our feet could tear up the floor pretty easily.
Bryson: I used boiled linseed oil.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:36.800
Just gonna use a roller here and roll it on.
We're going to go ahead and do 5 coats on

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:50.700
this floor.
Shelly: Okay, this is the floor after. You

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:53.670
can see the linseed has soaked in.
It's not shiny.

01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:57.890
Ready for another coat.
Bree: We apply 5 coats of linseed oil over

01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:59.040
the
coarse of a few days

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:05.630
to allow for dry time in between.
We used about 7 gallons of linseed oil.

01:09:05.630 --> 01:09:14.870
Garen: We put a quick coat of wax
on the floor after the coats of linseed.

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:37.130
And we just use a hardwood floor wax.
Bryson: Oh hey, look at this?

01:09:37.130 --> 01:10:00.910
Bryson: Oh, this is so cool.
Bryson: Does that work?

01:10:00.910 --> 01:10:27.272
Bree: Now, we need some power.
Garen uses solar panels. However,

01:10:27.272 --> 01:10:32.270
we need more panels if we want to add Bryson's
room to it.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:36.670
Gary: Last year we purchased for Garen's room,
two solar panels, two batteries

01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:39.160
and a full kit to do that inversion
to A/C.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.770
Shelly: Yeah, and it was our first test of
getting solar

01:10:42.770 --> 01:10:45.910
Gary: In a bigger scale.
Shelly: We can't afford to buy it for the

01:10:45.910 --> 01:10:49.090
whole house
but we thought we would start with the little

01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:52.000
rooms.
He's been running a little over a year on

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:55.160
that now
and so it was a good test for us to see how

01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.000
it would do.
And it actually has really well

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.300
with the exception of, he cannot run his 3D
printer over there.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:06.230
Gary: I think the 3D printer would run for
6 to 8 hours.

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:08.520
And that was the problem, is it took a big
drain.

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:10.850
Knowing that we had to increase Garen's room
by

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:15.910
one more panel, we just added four panels.
Shelly: Yeah, because Bryson has a 3D printer

01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:19.750
as well.
Shae: We have our panels.

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:23.130
Shelly: And our batteries are tucked under
here.

01:11:23.130 --> 01:11:27.600
We have 4 panels and 4 batteries.
And then some cabley things to connect them.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:31.720
Shelly: There's the store too.
Shae: Yes, that is the Solar.

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:35.540
Shelly: He's got a new sign. He didn't have
that last time.

01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:41.960
Shelly: Let's head home and hook them up.
Shae: Yes, let's do.

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:59.650
Bree: Garen will increase our current system
to from 2 panels to 6 panels.

01:11:59.650 --> 01:12:05.730
Bree: He installs 2 poles with supports angled
32 degrees toward the sun.

01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:09.020
Garen picked an angle somewhere between summer
and winter.

01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:13.740
We purchased brackets that are designed to
connect the rails.

01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:23.960
Shelly: Are you teasing the pig?
Bree: The structure is in place.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:34.910
Time to slide in the additional panels.
Bree: It's a one to one ratio

01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:48.720
from panels to batteries.
Garen attaches it using specific connectors

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.430
for the panels.
Garen: We need a thicker wire to handle the

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:56.320
power coming in from 6 panels so
I'm going to replace this wire here.

01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.950
Put a heavier gauge stuff in.
Shelly: Was it 6 gauge?

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:11.410
Garen: Yeah, putting 6 in.
Shelly: What is that?

01:13:11.410 --> 01:13:17.620
Garen: 10 Gauge.
Garen: Coming to help me dig?

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:21.140
Garen: Good boy.
Bree: Diesel doesn't leave Garen's side and

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:28.620
tries to help wherever he can.
Shelly: That's the 6 gauge that's come under

01:13:28.620 --> 01:13:32.150
the building
Garen: Electricians look away, please.

01:13:32.150 --> 01:13:37.580
Don't see my beautiful handiwork.
Shelly: Okay, so the white one went up to

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:41.660
this.
And the black one is going up there.

01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:48.010
Garen: This thing will take up to 6 panels.
Bryson: So Garen, how did you wire these in?

01:13:48.010 --> 01:13:52.380
Garen: Okay, so we have 6 panels,
3 and 3 is what we've separated them in groups.

01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:57.360
And the reason is, if you get too many amps
running through the little wire we have,

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:01.430
So we can't have 6 panels running through
the little wire.

01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:06.490
We take and we wire 2 sets of 3 panels into
one box and we wire them into a big 6 gauge

01:14:06.490 --> 01:14:08.871
wire.
Under the ground, and that will go straight

01:14:08.871 --> 01:14:13.040
into the control panel.
Because all my wires are coming out of here

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.040
are black
and they're not labeled. I'm just going to

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:19.190
check them on the multi-meter.
We can check which ones are which.

01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:24.560
These are coming out of 2 sets of 3 panels.
You don't want to touch any of these together

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:35.600
because these are all hot 'cause of the sun.
It's not like you can turn the sun off.

01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:47.770
Bryson: Put these blocks behind it.
It helps stick it out.

01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:57.420
Because the cob, the box is way back here.
The building came way out here.

01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:09.290
So 
the cap won't fit on it correctly.

01:15:09.290 --> 01:15:21.360
Garen: I am wiring up the batteries.
Bree: Our system is 24 volt so we buy 12 volt

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:26.530
batteries in sets of 2.
Bryson: We have 6 batteries here and he wired

01:15:26.530 --> 01:15:30.390
2 these together with minus to plus with a
jumper.

01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:35.200
Then he took and ran the 2 plus and minus
over to a main jumper.

01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.180
Garen: I'm gonna check the voltage, make sure
that it is 24 volts coming out 'cause otherwise

01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:45.560
you can get If you wire them all together
which I may of done first, you get 75 volts

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.270
out of this thing and you only need 24.
Yeah, we're right on.

01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:52.030
Right on 24.
Bryson: He takes the 24 volts and connects

01:15:52.030 --> 01:16:11.730
it to the main cables which go up to here.
Bryson: We bought the perfect amount of wire.

01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:14.290
We didn't even cut this. It was the prefect
roll.

01:16:14.290 --> 01:16:18.850
So it comes out here from the building. Up
to that building.

01:16:18.850 --> 01:16:25.220
Right there it goes in.
And diesel, he's watching and he's learning

01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:28.470
and he is ready to help.
Garen: You wanna help me out?

01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:31.400
Bryson: He was laying in the ditch a few minutes
ago. Yep.

01:16:31.400 --> 01:16:38.390
Garen: How can you always be in my way?
Bryson: Looks so beautiful Garen.

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:43.190
It does.
Gary: Turn it on.

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:50.300
See if you have light.
Garen: Shut it off, we don't have power.

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:53.340
And we know mine has power.
Maybe something unhooked?

01:16:53.340 --> 01:17:01.680
Gary: Do you have a wire that is not connected
up?

01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:11.190
Bryson: No juice.
Gary: Maybe it's the breaker.

01:17:11.190 --> 01:17:19.930
Garen: No voltage there.
Bryson: So it's the breaker?

01:17:19.930 --> 01:17:24.450
Garen: Oh, I see what it is.
Gary: Check the bus.

01:17:24.450 --> 01:17:32.260
Garen: Okay, we should have power now.
Shelly: Was it just in the wrong slot?

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.330
Garen: Yeah.
Bryson: Very hilarious.

01:17:34.330 --> 01:17:41.460
Bree: The solar panels and batteries are separate
from the building costs since it's optional.

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:44.750
Last year our budget for the initial system
was $3000.

01:17:44.750 --> 01:17:48.850
This year we didn't need to purchase the inverter
which was half the cost.

01:17:48.850 --> 01:17:54.860
We budgeted $2500 for the 4 solar panels and
4 flooded batteries.

01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:59.730
Gary: Part of homesteading is moving off of
the grid and that gives us the independence

01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:02.750
of our own power.
Shelly: It is our goal to be completely off

01:18:02.750 --> 01:18:07.190
gird.
But, it's not very pratical for us right now.

01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:12.760
So we're just taking small steps to get there.
Well, a bedroom's not suppose to take a crazy

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.550
amount of power.
Gary: Except when you have 2 sons like ours

01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:18.050
that
Shelly: Each have 3D printers, who want to

01:18:18.050 --> 01:18:21.840
print for hours on end.
We got 6 panels for just those 2 bedrooms.

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:27.000
It'll be interesting a year from now
to see. Could we run those 3D printers?

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.670
Bree: It's time to move him in.
But first, we need to buy him a real bed.

01:18:32.670 --> 01:18:37.490
He hasn't had one for over 10 years.
Bryson is a camouflage fan

01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:42.540
so it's time to give a camo paint job, a try.
Shelly: Here's all the colors we got.

01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:45.150
We looked it up online and learned how to
do it.

01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:52.150
Shelly: Our base color, kinda an olive green.
We'll put that base down first.

01:18:52.150 --> 01:18:57.340
Bryson: Always paint left in cans.
Or not that one.

01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:02.020
Not that one either.
There's no more paint.

01:19:02.020 --> 01:19:12.330
Bree: The youtube video we learned from used
real leaves but since we don't have any real

01:19:12.330 --> 01:19:14.260
oak tress around here,
Garen has an idea.

01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:16.780
Shelly: Oh, and then you're going to do that
one?

01:19:16.780 --> 01:19:20.530
Garen printed them out and then we taped them
on some light cardboard.

01:19:20.530 --> 01:19:23.640
Shelly: It's blotchy in some places but
I guess it's suppose to be a little blotchy.

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:30.920
Shelly: Let's try another color over the top.
Garen: We should be doing it on this side.

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.990
Hold paint a little better.
Shelly: Oh yeah.

01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:33.990
Shelly: Now it's looking totally like camo.
Poor thumb.

01:19:33.990 --> 01:19:34.990
Garen: I should have glove on.
Garen: That's it, right there.

01:19:34.990 --> 01:19:57.060
Bryson: This is really awesome Garen.
Garen: Shadow from the black.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:20:30.020
[Girls talking indiscriminately]
Shelly: It takes two of you guys to wax that?

01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:33.070
Shae: Definitely.
Shelly: It's beautiful though I have to say.

01:20:33.070 --> 01:20:36.960
Shelly: I made some curtains out of camo.
Not really a seamstress but we put a blanket

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:42.190
that we weren't using to be the liner.
So he'll have some extra protection from the

01:20:42.190 --> 01:20:45.210
cold.
Bryson: It felt really awesome to be moving

01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:49.140
into my room.
At first you don't believe it. You're just

01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:54.370
like no way.
I had to pinch myself just to figure out we

01:20:54.370 --> 01:20:59.090
were actually moving stuff in.
Some friends came over to help so it was all

01:20:59.090 --> 01:21:01.810
fun.
The desk that I had was just

01:21:01.810 --> 01:21:07.140
way too big.
It was nice but it just wouldn't fit in the

01:21:07.140 --> 01:21:10.120
room.
So we ended up taking it apart and fitting

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:12.760
it against the wall
so we could put the whole desk in there.

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.980
We even had to build some legs and stuff.
And as we were taking it apart, all of a sudden

01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:20.930
the whole thing collapsed into this flat pile.
And we're like, Oh.

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:22.980
So we took some screws and screwed it back
together

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:28.210
and built legs for it and got it in there.
Bree: Alright Bryson, what are you doing?

01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:32.730
Bryson: It's a mess. Don't look.
And it is a mess but I think I know where

01:21:32.730 --> 01:21:40.090
half this stuff goes.
Bryson: Potato gun.

01:21:40.090 --> 01:21:45.840
Pretty sweet.
Bree: I forgot about that chest.

01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:49.140
Bryson: You know, I think I'm going to put
it over there.

01:21:49.140 --> 01:21:52.290
Bree: Each of us have a light box in our rooms.
for filming reasons.

01:21:52.290 --> 01:21:58.450
Bryson: Used for filming.
Actually, I can put a light box back there.

01:21:58.450 --> 01:22:02.550
Bree: Where's your 3D printer?
Bryson: It's right there.

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:06.800
Bree: Oh, I see.
Bryson: I didn't realize I had so much stuff.

01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:12.460
Garen: Holy cow. So much stuff.
Bryson: I keep boxes of things you would never

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:15.220
use anymore.
Garbage electronics, things that have broken

01:22:15.220 --> 01:22:18.210
and I throw 'em in boxes and I keep 'em. 'Cause
I go, you know what?

01:22:18.210 --> 01:22:22.870
Oh this might have a couple electronics in
here I could use to fix something else so

01:22:22.870 --> 01:22:25.810
I keep it.
Someday it could save your iphone.

01:22:25.810 --> 01:22:31.100
Bryson: I was sleeping up in this loft before
I moved in.

01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:36.520
I was happy to move out of there.
This is my old loft up here.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:40.870
Oh boy, it's dark up here.
And the loft actually was a lot of fun up

01:22:40.870 --> 01:22:42.700
there.
It was nice and cozy.

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:46.100
The bedding I used to sleep on.
[sniffles]

01:22:46.100 --> 01:22:49.320
Bye Bye.
Don't need you anymore.

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:55.490
It's really nice to finally have walls to
decorate.

01:22:55.490 --> 01:22:59.720
It took 2 days to move everything in, possibly
even 3 if you count all the boxes.

01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:15.890
Is it really and then you wake up and you're
just like,Oh my gosh, I'm moved into my room.

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:22.350
It's unbelievable.
Yeah, that was awesome.

01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:27.464
Bree: And now, Bryson's ready to give us a
tour.

01:23:27.464 --> 01:23:29.020
Bryson: Alright, so let's go take a look at
my new room.

01:23:29.020 --> 01:23:32.290
But first before we get to the inside, we
have to go around the outside.

01:23:32.290 --> 01:23:38.330
Nothing to see here but paint.
'Til you get around to this side.

01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:42.460
Which is the more funner side.
Which is actually a dictionary word now so

01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:47.620
We can use "funner" now.
We got these glasses in here.

01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:49.230
This thing.
Window.

01:23:49.230 --> 01:23:55.120
Cameraman keep up. We got so much to see
and so little time.

01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:59.240
Our newest addition, a pot with what is going
to be a live grape.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:02.030
So let's go inside.
Got a nice basketball hoop.

01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:09.630
Closet.
Shine some light on the subject.

01:24:09.630 --> 01:24:21.290
Dog likes to be in here too. Get out.
I've got a nice computer area.

01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:23.222
3D Printer, Stuff like that.
And then in here

01:24:23.222 --> 01:24:34.560
We got our rocket stove going on over here
Our bed. My bed actually.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.240
And, dresser area
Steps.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:43.030
Open door.
And outside we go.

01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:50.570
And around in a circle.
And back inside.

01:24:50.570 --> 01:25:02.910
Nice view of our...
And that's my room.

01:25:02.910 --> 01:25:08.291
Bree: Our friends came over to celebrate.
Scott: I had to climb up on the wall and move

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:13.510
some dirt. Shovel it in a bag. She was up
on the wall and had a blast.

01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:16.290
Alex: It was fun.
Malcolm: She did all the work. We just handed

01:25:16.290 --> 01:25:20.960
her cans full of dirt.
Scott: That's right. She stayed up there.

01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:25.560
We passed the coffee can of dirt. And she
didn't fall off.

01:25:25.560 --> 01:25:26.930
Gary: Good deal.
Scott: It came out fantastic.

01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:27.930
Alex: It looks great.
Gary: Well, thank you.

01:25:27.930 --> 01:25:29.540
Alex: We honestly expected you to ask us to
help more.

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:33.090
Scott: More, yeah.
Gary: Well, you know, we have 2 more large

01:25:33.090 --> 01:25:38.570
projects and that may happen.
Tom: A different experience. We came out here

01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:42.890
right after it had rained.
The wall was partially up and had to be rebuilt.

01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:47.700
Part of the adventure right?
Gary: It was part of the adventure.

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:49.830
Tom: It was very interesting process.
It is neat to see how it turned out.

01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:54.860
You did a really wonderful job.
Gary: Were you injured in the process of making

01:25:54.860 --> 01:26:02.980
this?
Tom: I think my lawyer says I'm suppose to

01:26:02.980 --> 01:26:08.650
to say "yes".
Gary: Yeah, right, okay.

01:26:08.650 --> 01:26:13.980
Bree: And now, the grand total cost for the
building...

01:26:13.980 --> 01:26:22.610
Bryson: Really, really awesome. It's phenomenal.
Bree: I wasn't expecting it to be so big.

01:26:22.610 --> 01:26:26.640
But, I think my favorite part is the stairs
up.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:32.120
Bryson: Yeah, that's definitely a favorite.
Bree: And I love the use of the wood. Was

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.020
really clever.
Bryson: I like the door.

01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.830
Shelly: Shae's still got a little longer in
her loft

01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:38.920
Gary: Not too long.
Shelly: She loves it.

01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:42.810
Shae: I adore it.
It's really funny to watch people walk up

01:26:42.810 --> 01:26:49.980
into the loft though because, their like,
"oh, this is nice."

01:26:49.980 --> 01:27:09.420
Bang! Ow!
Garen: Don't post that.
