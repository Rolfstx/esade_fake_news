00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:03.236
NOAH: I flew out to South Africa
 on Friday morning.

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.306
14 hours later, I landed
 in my hometown, Johannesburg.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.075
And the moment
 I got off the plane,

00:00:09.108 --> 00:00:11.244
I felt something,
 a voice inside

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.212
reminding me
 of what I had forgotten.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:16.916
So, this is a road
I used to drive on

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.820
pretty much
my entire young life.

00:00:20.853 --> 00:00:23.056
Because of apartheid,

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.058
uh, black people had to live
in certain areas,

00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:27.827
and then white people
 had to live in other areas.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.729
But white people like
how the black people cook,

00:00:29.762 --> 00:00:31.731
so they need them
to come to their houses,

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:34.333
so there were roads
that connected the areas.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:37.770
And this was one of those roads.
All the taxis, all the buses,

00:00:37.803 --> 00:00:40.273
all the transport
that shipped the people

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:44.844
between Soweto and Johannesburg,
this is it.

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:45.978
(horn honks)

00:00:46.011 --> 00:00:47.980
(shouts in foreign language)

00:00:48.013 --> 00:00:49.282
That's what we do
in South Africa.

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:51.017
We... we don't have road rage.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.318
We have road joy.

00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.020
We just smile at each other,

00:00:54.053 --> 00:00:56.155
-and we-we honk.
-(horn honks)

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:57.924
It was very confusing to me
when I first got to New York.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:00.326
I thought everyone
was my friend. They were not.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.195
So, we're heading
to my grandmother's house now.

00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.430
Uh, I told her we're on the way,

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:07.700
but that doesn't mean
she'll be there, so, um...

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:09.168
You never know.

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.337
You might meet my grandmother.
You might not.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.375
(speaking foreign language)

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:20.279
(horn honking)

00:01:20.312 --> 00:01:22.381
So, welcome to Soweto.

00:01:22.414 --> 00:01:23.616
This is where I grew up.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.685
This is where
everything goes down.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.654
Uh, and yes,
we walk in the streets.

00:01:28.687 --> 00:01:31.023
We played in the streets.
This was the playground.

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:32.892
This is where you hung out
with your friends.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:35.027
This is where
everything went down.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.663
-(shouting)
-(speaking foreign language)

00:01:37.696 --> 00:01:39.398
And your neighbors scream
when you walk by.

00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:41.234
It's what we all do.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.169
What's amazing about this place
 is that nothing's changed--

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:44.804
in a good way.

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.539
It's like a museum,
 that's what it is.

00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:50.309
And we're here
at my grandmother's house.

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:52.011
Welcome to it.

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:54.046
This is where I grew up.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:56.649
This wall was a lot taller
when I was younger,

00:01:56.682 --> 00:02:00.419
but, uh, let's see
if she's here.

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:03.556
So, this is where I grew up.

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:05.224
This was the driveway.

00:02:05.257 --> 00:02:07.193
♪ ♪

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:11.598
We kick it off
with the driveway.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:16.569
This is where we used to want
to park our cars.

00:02:16.602 --> 00:02:18.437
We didn't have any cars,
but we still built driveways,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.706
because that's what life
is all about: ambition.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:21.908
(cheering)

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:23.676
I'll show you some
of the security features

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.577
that I installed in the house.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.245
We've got what's known

00:02:26.278 --> 00:02:30.116
-as an intruder defense
mechanism system of glass. -Wow!

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.118
Every single one
of these bottles,

00:02:32.151 --> 00:02:34.220
I drank what was inside.

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:35.688
Balling.

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.390
This is where the magic happens.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:39.725
(air horn blaring)

00:02:39.758 --> 00:02:41.928
Anybody can have a toilet
inside the house,

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.095
but it takes a real baller

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:45.097
to have a toilet
outside the house.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.400
Now, if you guys will excuse me,

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.436
I'm about to make
some magic happen.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.106
MTV Cribs, your boy.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:56.909
Oh, wait, there's no
toilet paper. Hold on.

First things first,

whenever you come
into an African person's house,

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:03.983
you greet.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:07.153
So the first thing
I'm gonna do is greet.

00:03:07.186 --> 00:03:08.855
Gogo.

I've got some camera people,

I don't mind.

Okay, okay.

-Mm.

00:03:43.022 --> 00:03:44.423
I've brought them
to South Africa

00:03:44.456 --> 00:03:45.925
to show them what it's like.

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:47.493
So they said,
because I'm coming,

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.161
they want to meet you

00:03:49.194 --> 00:03:52.065

questions about my life.

How old are you now, 91?

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:15.588
When you get to 91,
now you count months.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.361
-We're here because the-the
concert at FNB Stadium -Mm.

00:04:22.394 --> 00:04:24.563
is celebrating 100 years

living in South Africa
during that time.

00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:08.274

of the police.

00:05:08.307 --> 00:05:09.309
Ah.

When you see white guys
like this,

00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:31.664
do they remind you
of those police?

00:05:33.465 --> 00:05:34.667
That's what you remind
my grandmother.

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.001
I hope you're happy,

There are some people
who say now,

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:44.677
because some people
don't have jobs

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.679
and because it's tough
in South Africa,

00:05:46.712 --> 00:05:49.382
it would be better
to go back to apartheid.

00:05:53.218 --> 00:05:54.554
Why not?

00:05:58.056 --> 00:05:59.625
Ah.

to dig for potatoes

00:06:07.433 --> 00:06:09.068
with your hands?"

00:06:09.101 --> 00:06:10.870
Ah.

-You're digging for potatoes
with your hands. -Mm.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.721
And if somebody dies
from exhaustion next to you,

00:06:28.754 --> 00:06:31.557
you dig a hole,
you put them in that hole,

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.660
-and then you carry on digging
those potatoes. -(whistles)

00:06:34.693 --> 00:06:36.996
What-what was my contribution?

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:40.900
How-- Was-was I fighting
apartheid?

00:06:42.468 --> 00:06:44.070
Not knowing?

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:50.376
Ah.

00:06:50.409 --> 00:06:53.112
But I-I told them that I was
an apartheid hero, Gogo.

00:06:53.145 --> 00:06:56.716
-I wasn't?
-(giggling)

00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:00.953
Ah.

00:07:02.921 --> 00:07:04.724
Why did I give you
a tough time, Gogo?

00:07:10.095 --> 00:07:11.931
So, if I was playing
in the street,

00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.633
the police would have
arrested me?

00:07:18.837 --> 00:07:20.740
So they thought I was white?

00:07:25.344 --> 00:07:27.480
"Yeah. Oh! Oh, no!"

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:29.582
The kids ran away from me?

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:32.919
But why did they run away...?
What?

00:07:35.187 --> 00:07:36.422
-And allowed to do...
-So for them...

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:38.224
for them, this was white?

00:07:38.257 --> 00:07:40.059
Wow.

00:07:40.092 --> 00:07:43.262
-I feel so special now, Gogo.
-Huh.

00:07:43.295 --> 00:07:45.664
To know there was a time
that I was white.

00:07:45.697 --> 00:07:49.401
(both laugh)

00:07:49.434 --> 00:07:51.804
How old was I
when this was happening, Gogo?

00:07:51.837 --> 00:07:53.405
-NOAH: Three years old.
-Mm-hmm.

00:07:53.438 --> 00:07:56.308
-I was a very good-looking baby,
I'm sure. -(whistles)

00:07:56.341 --> 00:07:58.277
Yeah?

00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:03.049
But mostly good-looking.

00:08:04.616 --> 00:08:06.585
Yeah. I'm sure, Gogo.

00:08:06.618 --> 00:08:08.821
When I was here with you, what
did you do when I was naughty?

00:08:15.394 --> 00:08:17.063
(Noah laughs)

00:08:20.065 --> 00:08:21.734

me or my mom?

00:08:31.877 --> 00:08:34.146
Oh. You know how Mom is.

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.181
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Must always go up.

00:08:36.214 --> 00:08:38.150
Yeah!

00:08:40.218 --> 00:08:42.154
Mm.

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.861
So she was not only
a black person

00:08:48.894 --> 00:08:50.696
in a job black people
weren't supposed to be in,

00:08:50.729 --> 00:08:52.498
but she was a manager
of white people.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.168
How-how...?
But how did they allow that?

00:08:59.605 --> 00:09:02.207
And now I'm also
a manager of white people, Gogo.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.043
-Yeah.
-Unbelievable.

00:09:07.179 --> 00:09:09.381
-It comes from my mother, Gogo.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.586
I'm-I'm telling you, Gogo.

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.288
There are white people
who work for me.

00:09:19.625 --> 00:09:21.427
(Noah laughs)

00:09:26.632 --> 00:09:29.101
Gogo, have you ever... have you
ever watched The Daily Show?

00:09:32.604 --> 00:09:34.440
(speaking foreign language)

00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:39.111
(Noah laughs, Gogo continues

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.390
My gran said
she doesn't watch my show

00:09:51.423 --> 00:09:54.126
because sometimes
the electricity cuts out,

00:09:54.159 --> 00:09:56.795
which is a very plausible excuse

00:09:56.828 --> 00:09:58.998
and a nice way
to let your grandson down.

00:10:02.401 --> 00:10:04.070
(Noah laughs)

00:10:06.738 --> 00:10:08.040
-Mm.
-Mm.

00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:10.075
No, I-I hear you, Gogo.
This is...

00:10:10.108 --> 00:10:12.645
I didn't expect that answer.
It's a good answer, Gogo.

00:10:12.678 --> 00:10:14.046
So I must make sure

00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:15.881
that you have a generator
so you can watch my show.

00:10:18.116 --> 00:10:20.486
-Okay.
-(speaking foreign language)

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:22.655
-Who fits the generator?
-Ah.

00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:25.191
Okay, so I must get someone
to fit the generator, also.

00:10:27.259 --> 00:10:30.596
-Okay.
-(speaking in foreign language)

00:10:30.629 --> 00:10:35.501
Oh, and then I must also
fix the... the-the cable. Okay.

00:10:35.534 --> 00:10:37.169
-Mm.
-Hey.

00:10:37.202 --> 00:10:39.505
I feel like I've been tricked
into doing a lot of things

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:41.507
for you to watch my TV show,
Gogo.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.375
(both laugh)

00:10:43.408 --> 00:10:45.077
(speaking foreign language)

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:50.949
Oh, wow.

00:10:50.982 --> 00:10:53.085
Thank... thank you
for having us, Gogo,

00:10:53.118 --> 00:10:56.221
and thank you for letting me
bring these cameras.

00:10:56.254 --> 00:10:59.892
And thank you for sharing
these stories with my friends.

00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:02.260
And thank you for being amazing.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:06.899
I've brought too many friends,
Gogo.

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:08.434
You guys must leave now.
