00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.020
- January 15, 2009 started just like

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.620
10,000 other days, literally.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.493
And Flight 1549 initially,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.960
like all those other flights for so long,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.790
was completely routine and unremarkable

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.350
for the first 100 seconds.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:24.920
But this very suddenly, and I
was aware of it at the time,

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.347
became the worst day of my life.

00:00:27.347 --> 00:00:30.514
(slow brooding music)

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.530
We were traveling at that
point 316 feet per second

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.550
so I saw the birds about thee
football field lengths ahead

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.330
but not enough time to
maneuver away from them.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.840
And then they filled the wind screen

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.960
as if it were a Hitchcock film.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.060
And this was a large flock of large birds,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.100
The species Canada Geese,
they weight eight or ten,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.750
sometimes 12 pounds.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.530
They have five foot or six foot wingspans.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.840
And they struck the airplane

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.170
along the leading edges
of the wings, the nose,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.220
and into the center, the
core of both jet engines.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.550
Now jet engines are turbines.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.780
They're finely balanced machinery

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.600
spinning at tens of thousands
of revolutions per minute

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.100
and having a ten pound object or two

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.320
go through each of them,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.950
in the center of the core of the engine,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.830
is incredibly damaging and disruptive.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.110
Immediately, I could hear terrible noises

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.660
from the machinery being damaged

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.500
that I'd never heard
in an airplane before.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.970
I could feel terrible vibrations

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.660
I'd never felt on an airplane before.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.250
And then

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.280
I received confirmation of
what I believed had happened,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.270
what I could smell coming
into the cabin air,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.270
the burning bird odor from the engines.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.280
And then the thrust loss was sudden,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.080
complete, symmetrical,
bilaterally, both engines at once.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.150
It felt as if the bottom
had fallen out of our world

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.770
and my body responded immediately

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.790
in a very normal human way

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.280
to this sudden life-threatening stress.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.890
I was aware that as it happened.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.110
I could feel my pulse shoot up,

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.240
my blood pressure spike,
my perceptual field narrow

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.233
in tunnel vision because of my stress.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:10.623
I remember vividly my first
three conscious thoughts.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.620
This can't be happening.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.250
Having read about many accident flights,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.310
a very typical response
rooted in disbelief.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.840
Followed immediately by
this doesn't happen to me.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.500
In other words, for over four decades,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.480
I had never been so
challenged in an airplane

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.663
I doubted the outcome.

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.150
Followed immediately by a realization

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.530
that unlike all those other
flights I'd had for 42 years,

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.540
this one probably would not end

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.903
on a runway with the aircraft undamaged.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.020
And I was okay with that

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.373
as long as I could solve the problem.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.437
And so even though we'd
never trained for this

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:52.340
in our flight simulators or the airline

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.420
it as not possible to
practice a water landing,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.330
they aren't programmed for it.

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.240
The only training we'd ever
gotten for a water landing

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.090
was a theoretical classroom discussion.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.760
But because I had
learned my craft so well,

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.933
I knew my airplane and my
profession so intimately,

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.170
I could set clear priorities.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.170
And so I chose to do only
the highest priority items

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.640
and then I had the discipline

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.010
to ignore everything I
did not have time to do

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.530
as being only distractions

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.900
and potential detriment
to our performance.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.740
You see, I'm also well read
and so I knew the neurobiology.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.200
I knew that multitasking is a myth.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.780
That when we think we're multitasking,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.260
what we are in fact doing is

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.250
switching rapidly between tasks,

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.913
not doing either of them well.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.423
And so I chose not to try to do too much.

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.820
Within a few seconds,
by memory I had taken

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.430
the first two remedial actions

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.300
that we would eventually
get to on the checklist

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.080
over a minute later,
over a third of the way

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.670
through the remaining flight time,

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.080
but I needed those actions
to be effective immediately

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.480
and not to wait.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.040
I turned on the engine ignition

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.210
so if the engines could
recover, they would.

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.140
And I started the airplane's
auxiliary power unit.

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.290
I knew it was only a
matter of a few minutes

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.290
before our flight path intersected
the surface of the Earth.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.650
I had to choose the best possible
place for that to happen.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.360
Having flown into New York many times,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.210
I knew that there were only three options.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.630
There were only two runways
that might be reachable.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.800
It turned out with reaction
time, they were not.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.200
And the only other place in
the entire New York metro area,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.700
one of the most densely
developed areas on the planet,

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.540
where it might be possible to even try

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.660
landing a large jet airliner
would be the Hudson River.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.760
I suspected early on that's
where we would end up

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.270
but I knew I had to try to consider

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.973
at least returning to a
runway if it was possible.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:53.983
I took control of the aircraft,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.000
made one distress call,

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.130
worked with the aircraft controller,

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.750
considered returning to LaGuardia,

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:04.020
decided it was unreachable,

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.110
considered trying to reach
the Teterboro Airport

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.780
in New Jersey, across the river,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.863
decided that was not reachable either,

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.330
and told the controller we
were going to be in the Hudson.

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.330
He told me later he was shocked,

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.640
in disbelief,

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.690
and he assumed that by choosing that path,

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.290
that we would all perish

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.200
and it as an agonizing 45 minutes

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.733
until he found out that
everyone had survived.

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.770
Our First Officer, Jeff Skiles,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.130
I couldn't have had a better
colleague that day or since.

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.950
In a situation where the time pressure

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.000
and the workload were so intense,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.267
we didn't have time even to
talk about what had happened

00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:43.097
and what we should do about it.

00:05:43.097 --> 00:05:46.080
He and I were able to
collaborate wordlessly

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.730
by knowing intuitively
in this developing crisis

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.130
what we should do to help the other,

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.913
based on our own long experience.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.420
Had Jeff not also had
20,000 hours of flying time

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.070
like I did, had he not
been a captain before,

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.950
had he not been so experienced,

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.913
he wouldn't have known either
to do that or how to do that.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.110
So he made an important suggestion

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:09.950
at several points in the flight.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.380
He was silently cheering me
on as I made each decision

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.930
but ready to intervene,
to check my performance

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.490
if he thought I was making an error.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.640
I had a chance to make only
announcement in the cabin

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.100
and before I made what I knew

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.350
would be the most important
PA announcement of my life,

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.510
I took what was probably an
extravagant amount of time,

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:33.260
three or four seconds to
choose my words very carefully

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.060
before I spoke.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.813
I wanted to sound confident, not agitated,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.543
because I knew that
courage can be contagious.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.780
And I chose specific words
for specific reasons.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.130
Fortunately, we have the advantage

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.840
of having a very well defined

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.360
and very concise aviation vocabulary,

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.310
in which there are certain single words

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.246
that are rich with meaning.

00:06:56.246 --> 00:06:59.440
Brace is such a word.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.090
It signals to the cabin
crew, the flight attendants,

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.460
that an emergency landing is imminent

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.810
and that they should
help the passengers avoid

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.960
injury during the landing

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.420
so that they'll be able to evacuate

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.220
by shouting their commands
to the passengers.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.010
And in the spur of the moment,

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.340
I chose another word

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.270
to give the passengers and
crew in the cabin alike

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.410
a vivid image, a word
picture of what to expect,

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.260
that without engine thrust,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.200
we were using gravity to
provide the forward motion

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.580
in the airplane.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.560
We were descending the equivalent

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.150
in a hotel elevator descending
at two floors per second.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.600
So I knew it was going
to be a hard landing.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.620
I just didn't know how hard

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.740
because Jeff and I had
never practiced this before.

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.520
So I chose the word impact

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.250
to give them that vivid image.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:47.127
I said "this is the Captain.

00:07:47.127 --> 00:07:49.060
"Brace for impact."

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.190
And immediately even through
that armored cockpit door,

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.920
I could hear the two
flight attendants in front,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.370
Donna and Sheila, and I'm sure

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.760
Doreen in the back was doing the same,

00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.347
begin shouting their commands
in unison to the passengers.

00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:01.667
"Brace, brace, brace.

00:08:01.667 --> 00:08:03.547
"Heads down, stay down."

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.440
Hearing those words that day

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:09.730
encouraged me.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:11.020
It comforted me

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:15.050
to know that by saying
the few words I had,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.300
but choosing the right words,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.790
I had literally gotten
my crew on the same page

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.360
and that if I could find a way

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.620
to deliver this aircraft
to the surface intact,

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.040
it would float long enough

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.170
for the flight attendants
to evacuate the passengers

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:31.520
and for New York Waterway

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.430
to send their ferries to
pick us out of their water

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:37.150
and that was critically
important on such a cold day.

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:39.983
The air temperature was
21, the water about 38.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:42.600
Right before the landing,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.103
I asked Jeff Skiles a question.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:49.680
I said got any ideas?

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.250
Some think that was a flippant
remark but it was not at all.

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.240
It was just an indication
of how deeply internalized

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.893
these team skills are
that I used to teach.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.780
I was saying to him, and
he understood in context

00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:04.520
exactly what I meant,

00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.500
I've done everything I can
think of that can help us.

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.490
Are there any other
actions that we can take,

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.560
that you can think of,
that would help us succeed,

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.430
even by a fraction?

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.710
And Jeff's answer was

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.823
actually not.

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:20.070
And he answered just like that.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:22.400
Not at all because he was being insouciant

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.870
or not because he was resigned
to an ineluctable fate.

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:27.703
Far from it.

00:09:27.703 --> 00:09:30.040
We were fighting to save
every life to the very end.

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:34.690
He answered that way because
he knew we'd done all we could.

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.670
The fact that we could have that exchange

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.610
just before the emergency
landing of a lifetime

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:43.220
is one of the more remarkable things

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:46.207
about this flight and this crew

00:09:46.207 --> 00:09:50.910
and our diligence, our
dedication to never give up.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.460
Just try to save every life.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.273
To do everything we possible could.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.120
And then finally, as we
were approaching the water,

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.433
again Jeff collaborated
with me wordlessly.

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:07.240
He knew that the final critical maneuver

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.190
was for me to try to judge visually,

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:11.730
looking at this featureless
water train ahead,

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.220
where depth perception's
inherently difficult,

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.535
the height at which to
begin raising the nose,

00:10:16.535 --> 00:10:18.720
to begin the landing,

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.020
to trade some of our forward motion

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:24.320
for a reduced rate of
descent and touch down

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.790
and to achieve the proper
slightly nose-up attitude

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.440
as we touched the water.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.350
So Jeff began to call out
to me air speed and altitude

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:33.240
as I was looking at the water ahead

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.180
to help me judge that critical height.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.670
And we were coming down so rapidly,

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:38.900
if I misjudged any of them by a fraction,

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.880
we might start too soon and
get too slow and hit hard

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.560
or start too late and descend
into the water too rapidly

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.660
in the wrong attitude.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:50.020
As we hit, we hit hard.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.750
But the deceleration, well,
our rapid was uniform.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.020
And based upon the forces
that Jeff and I felt

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.620
in the cockpit as slowed to the stop,

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.450
it as obvious that the
airplane was intact,

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.500
it was stable, it was floating,

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.100
and people were probably
still okay at that point.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.580
And in the most amazing coincidence,

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:07.300
Jeff and I turned to each
other at that moment,

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:10.077
in the same time, using
the same words, said

00:11:10.077 --> 00:11:12.027
"well that wasn't as bad as I thought".

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:14.530
But we weren't high-fiving.

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:17.340
We still had to get 155
people out of an airplane

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:21.300
taking on water in a river in January.

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.250
I opened the cockpit door and
shouted one word, "evacuate".

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:27.980
The evacuation went fairly quickly.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.480
Passengers and crew worked together

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.300
to help out an elderly woman

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.510
who had been boarded in a wheelchair.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.350
They helped a young family of four,

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.253
including a mother with
a nine-month old child.

00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.340
And by the time I left the
airplane as the last one off,

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.180
the New York Waterway
ferries were all around us

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:46.830
and the rescue was well underway.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.740
But it was an agonizing four hours

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.680
until I finally received word officially

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.500
that everyone was accounted for

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.770
and only then were my
immediate duties completed

00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:02.093
when everyone was safe.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.663
(somber music)
