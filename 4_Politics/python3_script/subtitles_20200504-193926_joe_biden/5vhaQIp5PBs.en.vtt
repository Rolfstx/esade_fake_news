There's all these people up

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.570
- Like a lot of you
you live in Southern California,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.173
in Los Angeles, as do I,
and for a few of you,

00:01:14.173 --> 00:01:16.742
this is not your native city
of your birth.

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:19.078
That's my story,
and many, many years ago,

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:21.580
I arrived here in 1981
in the summer,

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.750
and I graduated
from a military prep school

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.819
in Potomac, Maryland,
on the east coast

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.423
with a--an awful education,
'cause I resisted education.

00:01:30.423 --> 00:01:32.091
I just--I couldn't get it.

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.427
High on Ritalin
for most of the time,

00:01:34.427 --> 00:01:36.195
so I was tightly controlled,

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:38.697
yet a-a psycho underneath.

00:01:38.697 --> 00:01:40.933
And so I graduated
from high school,

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:44.437
and I stopped taking
the Ritalin, and my body said,

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:46.306
"Okay, the arrow's
been drawn back,

00:01:46.306 --> 00:01:49.175
and now it's time
to let it fly."

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.710
And so I went in through
a series of minimum wage jobs

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.512
thinking, "Well,
that's going to be my life.

00:01:53.512 --> 00:01:55.815
"I'm gonna live
in a Bruce Springsteen lyric

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.017
for the rest of my life."

00:01:58.017 --> 00:01:59.352
♪ He's working-- 

00:01:59.352 --> 00:02:00.786
You know, just--
it's gonna be tough.

00:02:00.786 --> 00:02:02.621
My feet are gonna hurt
and I'm gonna get

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:06.226
really acquainted
with Top Ramen noodles.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.627
And right around that time
I found out about a band

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:10.363
called Black Flag
from Los Angeles,

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:13.132
and they were as angry
and as crazy as I was.

00:02:13.132 --> 00:02:14.700
I'd hear their music
and, like, "Finally!

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.803
That's--that's what
I'm talking about,"

00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.837
and they came back to the
east coast, and they saw me,

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:20.472
and they said,
"You're pretty crazy,"

00:02:20.472 --> 00:02:22.008
and I said, "You have no idea,"

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.009
because I'm very polite,

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.211
and that throws people off.

00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:26.545
I say,
"Yes, ma'am, yes, sir."

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.147
"Are you in the military?"
"No, sir."

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:31.817
"Are you a cop?"
"Never."

00:02:31.817 --> 00:02:33.252
"Then why are you so polite?"

00:02:33.252 --> 00:02:37.089
"Ritalin, and, uh, a lot
of schooling, actually."

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:38.323
I'm unnervingly polite,

00:02:38.323 --> 00:02:41.093
but I'm also capably violent.

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:44.997
[laughter and applause]

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:48.835
So when you do it with a smile
someone almost thanks you.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:52.204
Uh, and so they said,
"Hey, you want to audition

00:02:52.204 --> 00:02:53.706
to be the singer in this band?"

00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:54.907
I was like...
[hyperventilating]

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:56.742
"Yeah, yes."

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:59.712
Everything said--
my DNA screamed "yes."

00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:02.514
And so I made it,
and so I jumped in this van

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:04.750
and I came out
to southern California

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.520
and I am now running
with a group of men

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.456
who are older than I am
by about five or six years,

00:03:10.456 --> 00:03:13.292
and they are the wise elders
of Black Flag.

00:03:13.292 --> 00:03:15.428
I am--I am the grasshopper.

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:17.697
I am the stepchild,
and I learned

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:20.800
to keep my mouth shut,
and my eyes and ears open

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.869
'cause they knew
way more than I did,

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:25.804
and so there's one
particular guy in the band

00:03:25.804 --> 00:03:27.806
who I was in awe of immediately.

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:30.209
I am in awe of him to this day.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.044
He was an intellectual
terrorist.

00:03:32.044 --> 00:03:36.048
He's the first truly cerebral
person I ever met in my life.

00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:37.249
He's not a tough guy.

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:38.417
He does not fight.

00:03:38.417 --> 00:03:40.386
He doesn't do any of that.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:42.988
It's his mind
that terrifies you,

00:03:42.988 --> 00:03:44.656
and he would have this book.

00:03:44.656 --> 00:03:46.459
He'd be always writing
in this small book.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.060
He'd say,
"Hey, Henry, come here."

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.295
Like, "Yes?"

00:03:49.295 --> 00:03:51.230
And I'd sit on the floor
and look up,

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.898
and he'd read out of his book.

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:54.400
[as bandmate]
"One day

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.435
"we'll give everyone
knives and guns

00:03:56.435 --> 00:03:59.839

kill each other off,

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:13.286
How about we just
go to band practice?"

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.153
But he was so persuasive.

00:04:15.153 --> 00:04:17.590
He wore shirts with no sleeves,

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.091
so he had the biceps going,

00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.928
and he had this scuba knife,
and he would plunge it

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.763
into a can of pineapple...

00:04:24.763 --> 00:04:28.600
and he was able to open it
just with his...

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.370
Like, how does anyone do that?

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.940
Like, he's, like, the alpha

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.343
and he would stab the pineapple
and come out,

00:04:37.343 --> 00:04:39.011
and he'd just
hand you the blade.

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:41.281
"Pineapple?"
You're like...

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:44.617
Thank you.

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:46.385
And he was always
really intense,

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.354
and one day he looked at me
and said,

00:04:48.354 --> 00:04:50.122
"Come on, let's go."
I'm like...

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:52.658
And so big dog takes little dog,
and we're walking--

00:04:52.658 --> 00:04:54.459
we were living down
in Redondo Beach,

00:04:54.459 --> 00:04:56.295
and so we're walking
and walking and walking

00:04:56.295 --> 00:04:58.464
towards the sea,
and we make a left

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:00.299
into some huge supermarket,

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:02.902
and we go right
to the meat section

00:05:02.902 --> 00:05:05.037
and he grabs a steak

00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:07.073
in its cellophane and Styrofoam.

00:05:07.073 --> 00:05:08.841
Tears it open.

00:05:08.841 --> 00:05:10.509
Rips the meat in half.

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.912
Just hands me half of it.

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:15.848
And he plunges part of it into
his mouth and he's eating it.

00:05:15.848 --> 00:05:18.817
I'm like...
And I start eating it too.

00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:21.487
The entire supermarket
is just silent

00:05:21.487 --> 00:05:24.891
looking at these two men...
[grunting]

00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:28.161
And like,
and I'm such a good boy.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.495
I was raised honest.

00:05:29.495 --> 00:05:30.997
I worked for a living.

00:05:30.997 --> 00:05:33.599
"Well, golly, don't we
have to pay for this?"

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.769
And, like,
alpha males don't pay.

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:40.105
Like, we're on the Serengeti
of the South Bay.

00:05:40.105 --> 00:05:41.774
We just take meat.

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:43.710
We are punk rock hyenas.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.177
We do not pay.

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:48.948
And if this meat stood still
long enough to be eaten,

00:05:48.948 --> 00:05:50.349
we deserve to have it.

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.851
And so we walk out
and everyone's like,

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.753
"Yeah, that's okay.
Have a great day."

00:05:53.753 --> 00:05:55.254
We're like...

00:05:55.254 --> 00:05:57.056
"We'll be back later."

00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:59.258
And we walked all the way back
to SST Records

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:02.361
where we were living and our
hands covered in gristle,

00:06:02.361 --> 00:06:04.263
and I ate the whole damn thing.

00:06:04.263 --> 00:06:05.798
I was that hungry.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:09.268
And we would go to gigs,
and my life was changing

00:06:09.268 --> 00:06:12.872
with these, like, these adults
who were incredibly intense.

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.041
We would go to shows,
check out other bands,

00:06:15.041 --> 00:06:18.144
and I'm a young guy, I'm looking
at all these beautiful girls.

00:06:18.144 --> 00:06:20.913
I'm like, "Whoa, there's
a really beautiful girl."

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:22.882
[as bandmate]
"Go up and talk to her."

00:06:22.882 --> 00:06:25.318
Ah, you know,
I don't have a line.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:26.585
I don't know what to say.

00:06:26.585 --> 00:06:29.322
"Tell her about death."

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:32.592
[laughing]
What?

00:06:34.994 --> 00:06:39.097
"Walk up to her and say,
'Hey, my flower child,'

00:06:39.097 --> 00:06:44.269
"'before the streets
become rivers of blood,

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:46.805
"'let's get down.

00:06:46.805 --> 00:06:48.907
Now.'"

00:06:48.907 --> 00:06:50.342
You really want me
to say that?

00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:53.111
"Yeah, go ahead."

00:06:53.111 --> 00:06:57.583
And so I took everything
this guy said really seriously.

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:59.118
"Come here."
Yeah?

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:02.155
"Love is the monster."

00:07:02.155 --> 00:07:04.489
Okay, thank you.

00:07:04.489 --> 00:07:06.091
Like... [chuckles]

00:07:06.091 --> 00:07:07.660
It was like being in a band

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.963
with Colonel Kurtz
from "Apocalypse Now."

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:13.166
And so everything he said,
I hung on every word.

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.967
And to this day,

00:07:14.967 --> 00:07:17.269
I'm still in awe of this guy,
'cause he hasn't changed.

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:19.538
I mean, his mind is terrifying,

00:07:19.538 --> 00:07:21.340
and he's a really nice guy,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:23.876
but his mind is dangerous!

00:07:23.876 --> 00:07:26.546
And so one day

00:07:26.546 --> 00:07:28.713
we're at SST Records
and he said,

00:07:28.713 --> 00:07:32.184
"You know, you should do LSD."

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:33.486
I'm like...

00:07:33.486 --> 00:07:36.455
And I am not a drug type.

00:07:36.455 --> 00:07:38.791
I'm one of those
where I would probably

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:41.527
have a very bad reaction
to any stimulant.

00:07:41.527 --> 00:07:43.696
I mean, it wouldn't go well.

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:47.732
And so I said, "Well, golly,
why should I take LSD?"

00:07:47.732 --> 00:07:51.003
"'Cause you're a real asshole...

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.973
[laughter]

00:07:55.675 --> 00:07:57.476
And it would help."

00:07:57.476 --> 00:07:59.378
And since he said it,
well, by golly,

00:07:59.378 --> 00:08:01.380
I better get some drugs.

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.848
And so I go at everything

00:08:02.848 --> 00:08:05.584
with kind of a boy scout
samurai zeal.

00:08:05.584 --> 00:08:06.986
"Well, I better get on the phone

00:08:06.986 --> 00:08:09.755
and get into
some LSD acquisition."

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:11.891
And so there's one

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:14.660
utterly psychotic,
brainiac woman

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.595
I knew who did drugs

00:08:16.595 --> 00:08:19.065
and I had her phone number,
so I called her.

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:20.332
"Uh, excuse me, this is--

00:08:20.332 --> 00:08:21.834
"this is Henry Rollins
from Black Flag,

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:24.403
"and I'm calling you today.

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:27.506
"I need to acquire some LSD

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:30.176
"and I don't have
any money, really,

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:33.678
"so I can only afford
a couple of ounces, so--

00:08:33.678 --> 00:08:37.883
"so if you could find a dealer

00:08:37.883 --> 00:08:40.853
"or some kind of vendor
in the South Bay area

00:08:40.853 --> 00:08:44.923
"who could maybe trade
for a Minutemen cassette

00:08:44.923 --> 00:08:46.859
"or a release
by the Meat Puppets,

00:08:46.859 --> 00:08:50.295
it would--that I can vend
pretty easily."

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:53.032
She said, "Oh, I've got LSD.

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:56.435
"I've got LSD I bought
from a leper in Studio City.

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:58.971
It's some great shit!"

00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.739
Well, fantastic.

00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:05.411
I need to buy
whatever it comes in.

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:07.245
She goes, "Oh, no, no,
no charge.

00:09:07.245 --> 00:09:09.048
"I'll bring it over right now,

00:09:09.048 --> 00:09:13.718
but the only rule is
I get to watch."

00:09:13.718 --> 00:09:16.221
And I said, "Well, fantastic.

00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:17.989
It'll be a date."

00:09:17.989 --> 00:09:22.494
And so within 45 minutes
of this guy saying,

00:09:22.494 --> 00:09:24.396
"Take some acid
because you're an asshole.

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:27.065
It'll help,"
the car pulls up.

00:09:27.065 --> 00:09:28.667
She had, like,
a Gremlin or something.

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:30.468
Just something
that just says, like,

00:09:30.468 --> 00:09:32.404
"I'm crazy.
This is my car."

00:09:32.404 --> 00:09:36.075
And she comes in, I think,
with her boots up to her knees.

00:09:36.075 --> 00:09:39.912
She just looked like an outtake
from "Josie and the Pussycats,"

00:09:39.912 --> 00:09:42.447
and she pulls out
a small, plastic bag

00:09:42.447 --> 00:09:44.917
with small squares of paper.

00:09:44.917 --> 00:09:46.418
She said,
"Here's a tab of acid."

00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:48.954
Well, fantastic.
What do I do with it?

00:09:48.954 --> 00:09:51.923
So she says, "Put it on
your tongue and let it melt."

00:09:51.923 --> 00:09:53.592
I go, "Well, paper doesn't melt,

00:09:53.592 --> 00:09:55.661
"and at 98.6 degrees, it's--

00:09:55.661 --> 00:09:57.696
a carbon-based product,
certainly, but--"

00:09:57.696 --> 00:09:59.331
She said, "Just hush.

00:09:59.331 --> 00:10:01.700
Don't swallow it, and just
let it melt on your tongue."

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.368
And so after a minute
it goes away.

00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:05.938
So we wait like 20 minutes,
and I'm waiting--

00:10:05.938 --> 00:10:08.106
I'm waiting to be on acid.

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:09.674
And she says,
"Well, how do you feel?"

00:10:09.674 --> 00:10:11.344
I'm like,
"Uh, I'm fine, thank you.

00:10:11.344 --> 00:10:13.112
How are you?"

00:10:13.112 --> 00:10:14.379
And she said, "No, no.

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:15.514
Do you feel high?"

00:10:15.514 --> 00:10:18.116
I'm like, "I don't--

00:10:18.116 --> 00:10:20.619
"I'm unable to answer
that question

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:21.887
"'cause I really don't
understand

00:10:21.887 --> 00:10:23.622
what I'm supposed
to be feeling."

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:25.290
She goes, "Okay, take another."

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:27.192
I'm like, "Well, fine."

00:10:27.192 --> 00:10:29.462
Thank you--I thanked her
for her generosity.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.662
I took another one.

00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:33.131
I know how to let it melt...
[hums]

00:10:33.131 --> 00:10:35.968
And it melts, and--
and so she said, "And?"

00:10:35.968 --> 00:10:37.636
and we've been sitting there
for, like,

00:10:37.636 --> 00:10:38.837
you know, 30 minutes or so.

00:10:38.837 --> 00:10:40.306
I said, "I don't know.

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:41.473
"Feeling okay.

00:10:41.473 --> 00:10:42.908
"I feel a little warm,

00:10:42.908 --> 00:10:44.676
"but I think that's just
the temperature.

00:10:44.676 --> 00:10:46.311
"I'm sweating a little.

00:10:46.311 --> 00:10:47.812
"A little sweat on my upper lip,

00:10:47.812 --> 00:10:49.715
"but otherwise, I don't know.

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:51.717
"Am I high on acid now?

00:10:51.717 --> 00:10:54.219
"'Cause I think I'm still
an asshole.

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:56.989
So I don't know."

00:10:56.989 --> 00:10:59.991
And she says,
"Well, take a third one."

00:10:59.991 --> 00:11:03.362
And meanwhile, just--
in all transparent--

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:05.263
she's taking them with me,

00:11:05.263 --> 00:11:08.200
so we are going one-for-one,
two-for-two, three-for-three,

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:10.569
and so now we've waited
a long time.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:12.704
She said,
"Does anything seem strange?"

00:11:12.704 --> 00:11:16.542
I'm like, "Nope, just spending
the afternoon here with you,

00:11:16.542 --> 00:11:20.078
"eating bits of paper.

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:22.714
Are you--are you sure
this is good stuff?"

00:11:22.714 --> 00:11:25.251
Trying to speak in her patois.

00:11:25.251 --> 00:11:27.786
And she goes, "No, no, no,
I've used this stuff before.

00:11:27.786 --> 00:11:30.122
"I saw through walls
and Jesus touched me,"

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:33.726
and so she was like,
"Let's do another."

00:11:33.726 --> 00:11:35.060
Fantastic!

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.730
And I figure
I'm so young and intense

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:39.264
the acid can't get to me.

00:11:39.264 --> 00:11:40.433
That's why.

00:11:40.433 --> 00:11:41.734
I'm acid-proof.

00:11:41.734 --> 00:11:44.069
And so we both have
four hits of acid

00:11:44.069 --> 00:11:46.438
circulating through our system,
and she says,

00:11:46.438 --> 00:11:47.740
"Okay, I'm bored, let's go."

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.275
So we get in her car

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:52.310
and we start driving west
towards Santa Monica,

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.645
and she said, "Are you hungry?"

00:11:53.645 --> 00:11:54.880
and I'm, like, always hungry.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.481
I said,
"Yeah, I'm always hungry,

00:11:56.481 --> 00:11:57.783
"but I don't have any money.

00:11:57.783 --> 00:11:59.751
I have, you know,
like, three bucks."

00:11:59.751 --> 00:12:01.387
And she said,
"Don't worry, I got this."

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.489
She said, um, "We're gonna eat
some hamburgers."

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:07.392
And so we are at an intersection
waiting to go into a parking lot

00:12:07.392 --> 00:12:10.995
to get the fast food, and I look
out the window of her car

00:12:10.995 --> 00:12:12.465
and there's a motorcycle parked

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:13.899
right next to me
at the red light,

00:12:13.899 --> 00:12:15.501
but its wheels
are still spinning.

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:17.102
I'm like, "Wow."

00:12:17.102 --> 00:12:19.838
I said, "The wheels of that
motorcycle are still spinning."

00:12:19.838 --> 00:12:22.908
She's like, "Oh, here we go!"

00:12:22.908 --> 00:12:26.511
[laughter, applause]

00:12:26.511 --> 00:12:28.346
And then she said,

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:31.784
"Acid 101, look at your hand."

00:12:35.253 --> 00:12:37.022
"Wow!

00:12:37.022 --> 00:12:39.591
I could do this
for the rest of my life."

00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:40.959
She goes, "Oh, you're high."

00:12:40.959 --> 00:12:42.460
And so we pull
into the parking lot,

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.163
she goes, "Let's go in
and get some food."

00:12:44.163 --> 00:12:46.165
I'm like, "People, food--
I can...

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:48.100
[gasps, squeals]

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:49.435
And she said, "No, no, no.

00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:50.969
Sit, sit, sit, sit.
What do you want?"

00:12:50.969 --> 00:12:52.438
"A hamburger...
[slurring gibberish]

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:56.842
And so she comes back,
like, days, eons later,

00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:58.843
with this food, and she
hands me a hamburger,

00:12:58.843 --> 00:13:00.279
like, there... [imitates bang]

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:03.181
and I open up the foil
and I look down at it,

00:13:03.181 --> 00:13:06.051
and I start eating--I just
start smashing it into my face,

00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:08.153
and then I pull it down,
I just look at it doing nothing.

00:13:08.153 --> 00:13:09.888
She goes, "What are you
doing over there?"

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:12.957
I said, "I'm eating an
infant's head.

00:13:12.957 --> 00:13:15.461
I'm eating an infant's head."

00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:17.630
She goes, "Wow!

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:19.798
This is great."

00:13:19.798 --> 00:13:22.868
And so we finish
the meal or something,

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:24.970
and then she says,
"Let's go to the beach,

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.404
'cause you'll like
seeing water."

00:13:26.404 --> 00:13:29.041
I'm like,
"I'll talk to the water."

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:32.844
And we're driving, and now
everything is happening.

00:13:32.844 --> 00:13:35.180
You're living next to
your own mind.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:36.815
It's--it's incredible.

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:38.917
And you're like,
"Wow, am I breathing?"

00:13:38.917 --> 00:13:41.420
I mean, you--it's really
a different experience

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.188
for a guy who's never done
anything more than

00:13:43.188 --> 00:13:45.824
three or four Michelobs
and promptly vomited.

00:13:45.824 --> 00:13:48.660
And so there's those
long parking lots

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:52.498
along the shore, a little
bit north of Santa Monica

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.666
as you get towards Malibu,

00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:56.835
and it's a Tuesday, Wednesday.

00:13:56.835 --> 00:13:58.203
It's mid-week.
The weather is nice,

00:13:58.203 --> 00:14:00.272
so it's not weekend traffic,

00:14:00.272 --> 00:14:03.175
but there are some people
in the parking lot,

00:14:03.175 --> 00:14:06.712
and so she starts driving
through the parking lots

00:14:06.712 --> 00:14:08.680
going north up the coast,

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.448
and she starts driving
really fast.

00:14:10.448 --> 00:14:12.684
I go, like,
"Why are you driving so fast?

00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:15.454
There's all these people up
there crossing the street."

00:14:15.454 --> 00:14:17.522
She goes, like,
"You pussies in Black Flag

00:14:17.522 --> 00:14:19.891
"always talk about the end
of the world and destruction!

00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:21.426
"The destruction starts now!

00:14:21.426 --> 00:14:23.862
We're gonna kill all these
fucking people!"

00:14:23.862 --> 00:14:27.032
[laughter, applause]

00:14:27.966 --> 00:14:30.702
And when she floors it,

00:14:30.702 --> 00:14:33.238
you see everyone look up

00:14:33.238 --> 00:14:36.274
as they hear an engine
screaming in fury

00:14:36.274 --> 00:14:38.711
as like a cheap car
is being floored

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:40.879
and the engine's like,
"I can't really do this...

00:14:40.879 --> 00:14:42.213
[squealing]

00:14:42.213 --> 00:14:44.149
And you see people start
moving differently.

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:46.285
"I'm walki--
I'm running for my life!"

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:50.122
And you see people grabbing kids
and picnic items and running.

00:14:50.122 --> 00:14:52.123
She's like,
"They're just like ants."

00:14:52.123 --> 00:14:54.626
I'm like, "This is--
really isn't happening.

00:14:54.626 --> 00:14:55.894
"The sky is talking to the sea,

00:14:55.894 --> 00:14:57.128
"and the sand
is screaming at me,

00:14:57.128 --> 00:14:58.763
"and the first
Jimi Hendrix album does

00:14:58.763 --> 00:15:00.165
"sound really good right now,

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:01.934
"and if I pretend
I'm Casper the Ghost,

00:15:01.934 --> 00:15:04.002
"I can float out of the car
and land as a blue ball,

00:15:04.002 --> 00:15:05.737
"and roll all the way back

00:15:05.737 --> 00:15:07.239
"to the hovel by the sea
where I live.

00:15:07.239 --> 00:15:09.341
Please, don't kill
these people!"

00:15:09.341 --> 00:15:11.342
And she slows down
and looks at me like,

00:15:11.342 --> 00:15:13.445
"God, you're so lightweight."

00:15:13.445 --> 00:15:15.247
Like, "All right, for you

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:17.749
I will kill everyone I can."

00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:19.918
And so I'm like, "Okay, okay,

00:15:19.918 --> 00:15:21.787
so let's--how about
we just drive?"

00:15:21.787 --> 00:15:25.524
I'm trying to be sane now
rocketing on four hits of acid.

00:15:25.524 --> 00:15:28.660
And so we now are driving up
in the canyon somewhere,

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:32.196
and it's very, very nice, and
we're driving up and up and up,

00:15:32.196 --> 00:15:34.333
and then we start driving down

00:15:34.333 --> 00:15:36.602
and the speed goes faster
and fas--and I go like,

00:15:36.602 --> 00:15:38.370
"Shouldn't you be driving
a little slower?"

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.505
She goes, "No, it's just like
a video game."

00:15:40.505 --> 00:15:42.007
[mimics engine roaring]

00:15:42.007 --> 00:15:44.109
I'm like, "Whoa, oh,
this is really dangerous!"

00:15:44.109 --> 00:15:46.778
She looks at me, she said,
"Tell me right now

00:15:46.778 --> 00:15:48.947
"why I should not drive this car

00:15:48.947 --> 00:15:51.116
off a cliff and kill us both."

00:15:51.116 --> 00:15:53.318
And I'm like, "You know,
that is a pretty amazing idea

00:15:53.318 --> 00:15:56.054
"because the car will float and
we'll live in a different life,

00:15:56.054 --> 00:15:58.723
"and we'll call each other
as eagles in the sky

00:15:58.723 --> 00:16:00.559
"from our vision quest--
No!

00:16:00.559 --> 00:16:01.893
No, I don't want to die!"

00:16:01.893 --> 00:16:03.628
She goes,
"Give me one good reason."

00:16:03.628 --> 00:16:06.498
And I'm going through
my LSD-poisoned mind

00:16:06.498 --> 00:16:08.467
trying to come up with
a sane reason

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:11.135
for her not to send
the car flying

00:16:11.135 --> 00:16:14.973
Thelma and Louise-esque
off the--some cliff,

00:16:14.973 --> 00:16:16.074
and finally, I come up with it.

00:16:16.074 --> 00:16:17.909
"I have to finish the vocals

00:16:17.909 --> 00:16:20.345
"on the next Black Flag album,
and if I don't finish it,

00:16:20.345 --> 00:16:22.080
the rest of the band
will be really mad."

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:24.983
[mimics engine slowing]

00:16:24.983 --> 00:16:27.352
She goes,
"Yeah, I like those songs.

00:16:27.352 --> 00:16:30.923
"Okay, okay.

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:33.258
You can live."

00:16:33.258 --> 00:16:35.160
And so we come down
and I honestly

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.096
do not really know
where we are at this point.

00:16:38.096 --> 00:16:40.832
She just, like,
"We'll go to a Zen garden

00:16:40.832 --> 00:16:42.066
and we can look at flowers."

00:16:42.066 --> 00:16:44.202
I'm like, "Fantastic, flowers."

00:16:44.202 --> 00:16:46.271
And so in about an hour
and a half, I went from,

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:48.272
"I'm in Black Flag
and I hang out with this guy

00:16:48.272 --> 00:16:49.508
"who wants the end of the world,

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:51.275
and I'm a--really
an intense guy."

00:16:51.275 --> 00:16:53.278
and this, like, 90-pound woman

00:16:53.278 --> 00:16:54.779
just, like,
tried to kill people.

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:56.748
I'm like, "Oh, please,
don't kill people!"

00:16:56.748 --> 00:16:58.116
Like, you're in Black Flag.

00:16:58.116 --> 00:17:00.752
"Yes, but I don't want
anyone to die."

00:17:00.752 --> 00:17:02.720
And so she's the heavyweight,

00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.222
and she totally showed me out

00:17:04.222 --> 00:17:06.525
for the fairly rational human
I am most of the time

00:17:06.525 --> 00:17:10.429
where vehicular manslaughter
is really not my thing.

00:17:10.429 --> 00:17:12.765
And so we go to some garden
and look at flowers,

00:17:12.765 --> 00:17:14.966
and the flower's, like,
"Hey, Henry, how are you?"

00:17:14.966 --> 00:17:16.201
They are talking right back,

00:17:16.201 --> 00:17:17.636
and it was
a wonderful afternoon.

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:19.203
Then we go back to her home.

00:17:19.203 --> 00:17:21.373
She lives with her parents,
and so, like,

00:17:21.373 --> 00:17:23.041
"We're gonna walk by
my mom and dad.

00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:24.275
Just don't say anything."

00:17:24.275 --> 00:17:26.044
I'm like, "But that's impolite."

00:17:26.044 --> 00:17:28.546
You have say,
"Hello, I'm Henry."

00:17:28.546 --> 00:17:31.049
And she goes, "No, your eyes
look really crazy--don't worry."

00:17:31.049 --> 00:17:33.551
'Cause she's--she's good
at taking drugs.

00:17:33.551 --> 00:17:34.553
She can maintain.

00:17:34.553 --> 00:17:35.787
I'm all over the place.

00:17:35.787 --> 00:17:37.589
And so we walk into her house,

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:40.726
and there her two incredibly
straight parents.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:42.227
"Uh, is this your friend?"

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:45.230
I'm like, "Uh--"

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:48.000
And so she puts me in her room
and closes the door.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.968
She says,
"Sit against the door."

00:17:49.968 --> 00:17:52.738
I'm like, "Okay," and I'm
sitting against the door.

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:55.807
And I said, "Why am I sitting
against the door?"

00:17:55.807 --> 00:17:58.610
She said, "To block it
if my parents come in.

00:17:58.610 --> 00:18:00.779
I'm gonna shoot some heroin
to take the edge off."

00:18:00.779 --> 00:18:03.615
You're going to do what?

00:18:03.615 --> 00:18:08.587
So she ties off and she starts
heating up a spoon of heroin.

00:18:08.587 --> 00:18:10.922
I'm like, "What, am I
in an episode of, like,

00:18:10.922 --> 00:18:13.191
the "Serpico" sitcom?"

00:18:13.191 --> 00:18:15.427
I mean, like, you're doing
heroin, like, wow!

00:18:15.427 --> 00:18:16.995
And so she does heroin.
I'm like,

00:18:16.995 --> 00:18:18.963
"I don't want to look.
I don't want to look."

00:18:18.963 --> 00:18:20.098
And she goes, "You want some?"

00:18:20.098 --> 00:18:21.366
I'm like, "No, no, no, no, no.

00:18:21.366 --> 00:18:23.502
No, no, I don't want
any heroin,"

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:26.371
and I did something
I've never done ever since.

00:18:26.371 --> 00:18:28.707
I opened up the window
of her room

00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:29.808
and just jumped out.

00:18:29.808 --> 00:18:31.610
[laughter]

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:35.013
Not even thinking,
like, what's below.

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:36.348
Thankfully, ground floor.

00:18:36.348 --> 00:18:37.949
I went...
the ground was right there.

00:18:37.949 --> 00:18:40.952
I mean, the window's here
but I kind of went, "Aah!"

00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:42.354
Like, 'cause I don't want to be

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:43.855
in a room with heroin

00:18:43.855 --> 00:18:47.326
'cause I'm too high on acid
to deal with it.

00:18:47.326 --> 00:18:51.196
And the most amazing part
of this incredible day,

00:18:51.196 --> 00:18:55.234
was I got from somewhere
in Santa Monica near UCLA,

00:18:55.234 --> 00:18:57.301
all the way back
to Redondo Beach.

00:18:57.301 --> 00:18:59.471
Two public bus rides, at least

00:18:59.471 --> 00:19:02.674
with no memory whatsoever

00:19:02.674 --> 00:19:04.208
how I got back there.

00:19:04.208 --> 00:19:07.312
And I come staggering in to SST

00:19:07.312 --> 00:19:09.248
like, I don't know,
like 12 hours later

00:19:09.248 --> 00:19:11.315
and I come in, I'm like...
[groans]

00:19:11.315 --> 00:19:13.151
And there's, uh,
there's the guy in the band.

00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:16.020
[as bandmate]
"Hey, how was it?"

00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:18.223
I'm like...

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:20.258
"It was incredible!

00:19:20.258 --> 00:19:23.528
But I think I'm still
an asshole!"

00:19:23.528 --> 00:19:25.330
Thanks.

00:19:25.330 --> 00:19:26.665
[cheers, applause]
