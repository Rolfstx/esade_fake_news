(BIRDSONG)

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.440
My morning routine —
I get the kids up and, um...

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.120
go back upstairs 10 minutes later
and get the kids up cos no one
wants to get up in the morning.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.400
Want a bacon sandwich? Yes?

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.640
Yes, that one.
OK.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.840
That's exciting, eh?
Yeah! (LAUGHS)

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.560
Then your holiday's always exciting,
isn't it?

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.560
Nikki over here,

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.240
I tend to have to keep on saying,
'Right, you need to do this,
and then you need to this,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.920
'and then you need to do this.' I've
kinda had to supervise their morning
routine a lot

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.560
probably more than if you would for
any other 21-year and 22-year-old,

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.200
because they kinda just get on
with their own thing.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
Morning, Em.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.400
Emma?

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.440
Emma? (CHUCKLES)

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.440
Did you say good morning to me?
Emma.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:05.600
Nikki.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600
Hi, Nikki.
Hi.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.840
Morning, Emma. Morning.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160
Morning.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.400
Thank you very much.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.120
There's only 13 months between them.
It's really well planned. (CHUCKLES)

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.760
We had, um...

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.440
So, we had four kids in six years,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.960
and three bakeries all
at the same time.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.080
During that period also,
we'd just bought our first house,

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.640
which was a wreck, and renovated it
from top to bottom while living in
it,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.480
so that's quite— that was a busy,
sort of, period.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.600
Right, girls, how are
we doing for time?

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.320
Quarter to. We've got...

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.680
10 minutes...

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.840
to get in the car, and you
and I can go off to work.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.640
No.
See, everybody's helpful (!)

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.160
Can you go hop in the car, please.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.480
(UPBEAT MUSIC)

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.680
Locked it.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.560
Right, girls, we ready?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.560
Seatbelts on.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.760
Well then, OK, let's go.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.040
The girls are actually really,
really different from each other,

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.840
so Nikki's very vocal
and talks all the time,
whereas Emma doesn't talk very much.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.000
We're just dealing with individuals,
and then the Down Syndrome part
sorta came as very, very secondary,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.280
so it was good to be able to put
that away really early in the piece.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.720
You ready to go and
see your friends?
No.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.440
(LAUGHS) You say that every day, and
then you love it when you go inside.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.960
Our commutes can take an hour each
way in Auckland's wonderful traffic
(!)

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.000
First we drop Nikki at school, and
then Emma and I head off to work.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And foot outside.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.600
Nikki's just turned 21, and she's
in her final year at Sommerville
Special School,

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:09.480
and they can only stay until they
turn 21, and after that, it's off
to work — if they can find a job.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.840
See you later.
Close the door, please.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.480
Bye.
Good morning, Nikki.
No.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.320
How are we? Are we happy?
Happy now.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.920
Oh, you're happy. Happy happy?

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.440
Yes, that's good.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.640
Emma and I, we spend our workdays
at Downlights Candles.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.240
It's a business we started
just a few months ago.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.360
After Emma left school, I approached
so many employers to see if they'd
give her a job,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.640
and basically got nowhere.

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.120
So I thought, 'Well, I've been
self-employed most of my life,

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.560
'so why don't I just set up our own
business, and then she can work in
that?'

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.200
Good morning.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.960
Oh, thank you, Emma. Did you
bring me a coffee? Thank you.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.440
We've always had candles at home,
and Emma really likes them, so I
thought, 'Let's make candles.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.840
'That'll be a piece of cake.'

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.840
Thanks for the coffee.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.200
What are you gonna do today?
I'm gonna do lots of work.
Are you gonna work?

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.280
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
(CHUCKLES) OK, right. Yeah.
What's first?

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.160
We made a few candles.
'OK, it's not a piece of cake.'

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.400
It's apparently got hidden depths,
and it's a lot more difficult than
you would think.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.840
I'll do a few, and then you
can come and finish off.
Sure, sure.

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.840
After only a week or so, I was
saying to these friends that,

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.000
'Do you know what? I think I
need some advice about this,'
and my friend,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.240
'I've got a friend who's got a
candle company. She lives just
down the road.'

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.200
I was a little concerned about the
steps he was taking with the
business,

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.920
so I offered him the opportunity to
use the manufacturing facility out
of Illumina

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:51.120
so that it would save him costs at
the beginning and to show him a few
tricks of the trade.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.160
I was born in Canada, and I've lived
in New Zealand for 22 years now.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.000
I fell in love with New Zealand,
and I just had to stay.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:08.000
I've always been involved in
something crafty, so making candles
just seemed like a fun thing to do.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.400
Tony had a very small range, a few
fragrances. He did this market,

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.680
and that led to Seven Sharp doing
a story with Tim Wilson.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:23.400
You probably don't know about candle
making is it happens at a pretty
high temperature. How warm is it?

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.000
It's a secret, Tim.
It's secretly warm.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.600
After that, we sold a candle a
minute for two days, so we very
quickly

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.600
developed a business name, a
tagline, ordered new glassware,
developed a logo,

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.080
all within three or four days.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.480
The name Downlights, I definitely
wanted to have a connection between

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.160
Down Syndrome and the
name of the company.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.160
You take the pegs off.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.480
And put them in the bucket.
You know how it goes.

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.280
And I'll do the wax, OK? Thank you.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.480
For Jennifer and Illumina to,
basically, hand over her
intellectual property

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.160
so quickly to us, four of five
years' worth of experience,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.280
and really, really hard work,
which he haven't had to go through.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.400
You know, your intentions and goals
with Emma were just so genuine.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.280
And I just really wanted
you to succeed for Emma

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.640
so that she would have something
in her life every day,

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.720
and there was just
no way I could of...

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.040
let you flop.
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.800
When we first started, everything
had to be supervised,

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.040
whereas now it's just a case of
just point out that needs doing,

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:39.880
and within 30 seconds, she's up
and doing it and on her own.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.280
So once she's learnt how to do the
jobs, then I just set the task,
walk away.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.480
She's right into it.
It's really good.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.400
She's really risen to the challenge
of the fact of having to get up
every day and travel to work

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.880
and spend the whole day at work.
She's, you know, really putting
herself into it big time, yeah/

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.720
Can you take the pegs off, and then
I'm gonna get that wax that we just
poured.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.120
I'm gonna add the fragrance
and pour the candles, OK?

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.160
OK, good. You do that.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.120
And I'll get the wax.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.920
Since we started doing this, her
independence has really blossomed.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:19.520
It's been fantastic, really,
to see the changes in her.

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.320
She feels achievement from what
she's doing. We'll do jobs,
and she'll be smiling

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:31.080
at the end when we've finished it.
You know, she's obviously very proud
of herself and what we're doing.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.760
Her confidence is just
growing and growing.

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.760
OK, do all the sticks and take them
off, and then we're gonna pour the
candles.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.240
(OVERLAPPING CONVERSATION)

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.800
And what's that?

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.400
I dunno.
You don't know?

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.480
I think is

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.680
is trophy.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.760
A trophy. Well done, you.

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.280
I said it. I said it.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.920
When they turn 21, that
is the biggest challenge,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.520
because businesses often don't
take on people with disabilities.

00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:18.720
We have a lot of opportunities for
them to practice the skills that
they personally need

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:21.800
for when they finish school.
They're ready for their next step,

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.760
and unfortunately in a lot of cases,
that next step doesn't happen.

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:33.040
And the parents that I talk to
really struggle because they
would like their child

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.040
to continue going to work.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:41.720
We need to do some stretches.
Ready to do some stretches.
Come and stand over here.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:43.720
(UPBEAT MUSIC)

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:51.040
Having a job, having a role, having
a purpose gives them a reason to get
up in the morning.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.360
They like to contribute to society.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:58.760
What Tony's done is give Emma an
opportunity to create a life that
she wants.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.760
And I feel that will be the
same for Nikki as well.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.760
*

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:09.160
Do you know where that was?
What country was that?
Spain.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.840
Wasn't Spain. It was in France.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:12.200
France.
Yep.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.080
Do you remember going to Spain?
Yay, Spain.
Yay.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.000
The food was fantastic.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.760
What's the next picture?
Press.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:25.960
About four and a half years ago,
I sold the cafe that we had in
Maraetai, and we travelled.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.280
(LAUGHS)

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:33.640
I'd been working seven days a week
for 25, 30 years, so we decided
that we would travel.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.600
(LAUGHS)

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:37.880
And we went to Europe,
Spain and France.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.560
A lot of time in the UK.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.560
To England.
Do you like it there?

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.560
No.
No?
Here.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.240
I was really amazed, you know,
and that—

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:49.800
Well, I don't know why I should be
amazed because nothing they do
amazes me any more.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:53.480
They took to travelling like
a duck to water.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.640
Nanna's house.
That's Nanna's house, that's right.
(LAUGHS)

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.840
Nikki.
That's you, I know.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.160
You love pictures of yourself.
(LAUGHS)

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.160
Who's that girl?

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:09.320
Who's that girl?
(LAUGHS) That's Emma.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.720
It's Emma.
It's Emma. You're looking
gorgeous there, Em.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:16.800
There's me and Harrison when
he was just a little boy.
He's taller than me now.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.760
First in line, so, Harrison, who's
our oldest. 17 months later,
Claudia came along,

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.520
and then Emma was born undiagnosed,
but was diagnosed at birth with
Down Syndrome.

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:33.040
Which at the time, was really
devastating. It wasn't
something we'd considered.

00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.800
All those questions — why me?
What have I done to my family?

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.760
All the destructive questions
that you do to yourself,

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.440
like, 'What if I just stayed with
two. I should have just stayed
with two,'

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.960
and then I had the weirdest dream,
and it was my grandmother saying,

00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:52.080
'It's gonna be OK,' and I woke up in
the morning feeling like a weight
had been lifted off my shoulders.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.200
It was quite bizarre.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:00.280
I could see black-and-white
television documentary pictures in
my head of institutionalised people,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.280
so devastating, really. It was like,
'Oh my God. That's what we've got
to look forward to.'

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:10.240
Carolyn was the receptionist at a
business where I went looking for
a job,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.120
and was very pleased to
meet the receptionist.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.800
Our decision about having another
child after Emma, I think a lot
of our friends kinda thought,

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.200
'Whoa, really, you want
to have more kids?'

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.680
The initial thought was, 'Oh yeah,
let's have another baby, and that
will, sort of,

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:28.960
'push Emma along from behind,
and once you've got three kids,

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.160
'you're lost anyway, so
might as well have four.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:37.720
'Might as well have 40; it doesn't
make any difference, you know.'
You're so immersed in family.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:45.200
Nikki was born 13 months after Emma,
and, lo and behold, and she was born
with Down Syndrome as well.

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.120
We were even more shocked than
we were the first time around,

00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:55.120
and the first— the initial thought
was, like, 'Oh, this is just
disaster.'

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.320
Ready?
I'm ready.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.880
The way it's actually turned out
is completely the opposite.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.840
If Nikki had been born as an average
person, she would have probably
overtaken Emma, and...

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:09.480
Emma would have been left as the
one child, sort of, on her own,
in a way.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.720
They get on like a house on fire, so
it's fantastic. They're gonna have a
friend for life.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.400
I wouldn't be without them,
wouldn't change a thing.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.360
If I had my time over, if I had
a wish fairy come down and say,
'I could change it all for you,'

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:26.160
I'd just say, 'No, go away.' I'm
really... They're just amazing kids.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:31.600
Um, yeah, so Carolyn was diagnosed
with breast cancer in 2007.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.960
Basically, the option was a
mastectomy, and Carolyn said,
'Right, book me in tomorrow.

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.120
'We're gonna do something
about this.'

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:46.800
She had six months of chemo.
It was pronounced fit and well,
that she'd beaten it.

00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:54.960
Unfortunately, cancer decided it was
gonna make a return visit to Carolyn
only a few years later.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:01.400
And so she was rediagnosed again
with an even more serious cancer
in 2010.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.080
And just...

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:11.040
This time they told us it was
terminal. Can you cut there, please?

00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:18.400
After she passed away, I decided
that her positive attitude was
something which I had to...

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:25.080
mimic to start off with, because,
as I say, I wasn't a particularly
positive person at the time.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.080
And I figured that I...

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.600
lived by the manta of
'attitude positive'.

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:35.200
Which is actually something—
I had it tattooed on my chest

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:41.080
so that every morning when I woke
up, I could look at that and go,
'That's how you're gonna be today.'

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.640
And you've only got to do it for a
day, and then the next day, you've
only got to do it for another day.

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.640
And eventually you keep on trying to
live like that and try to live like
that,

00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:55.320
and eventually you do, and you
actually start... becoming that way.

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.160
Yay.
Do you trust me?
I trust you, Nikki.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.560
I think the issues that, for me,
at that time were practical issues,

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:08.080
in that I was still running a
business, which was a cafe at
the time.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.440
Seven days a week, starting
at 7am and finishing at 5pm,

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:16.360
and how do you work 70 hours a week
and look after four kids at the same
time?

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.640
So Claudia, my oldest daughter,
was due to go to university at
that particular point,

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:26.440
and I suggested to her that maybe
she delays university for a year,

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.520
and she helped me look
after Nikki and Emma.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.480
We walked about it and decided that
I would take Emma and Nikki on.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:35.240
Kind of, doing the school runs
in the morning,

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.920
you know, waking up, getting them
ready, driving them to school,

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.480
and if they needed afterschool
activities, I would be in charge
of that.

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:47.960
For Emma and Nikki it was great,
because it gave them someone to
focus on who was, you know,

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.720
consistent every day, dropping them
at school. They had a routine that
they could stick to.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:55.000
It was really good just to spend
a lot of time with my sisters.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.480
I got to spend a lot of time with my
dad, and I did have to grow up a
little bit.

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:03.000
You know, I was 17, fresh out of
school, going from hanging with my
friends and doing school all day

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.120
to being essentially a full-time,
not a parent, but a caregiver.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:10.640
So it did make me grow up a little
bit faster than maybe I needed to.

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:15.960
If that wasn't the situation, but I
think ultimately, I've turned out a
better person for it.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:20.000
During that period of time where
she gave me that grace period,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:27.240
I reorganised my business and
took on more staff and, sort of,
extracted myself from the business

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.360
so I didn't have to be there the
whole time, which meant that I
could then step in

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:36.560
and actually take a more active role
in being with the girls and looking
after the girls.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.040
And it's continued from
there in that way.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.400

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:49.760
And an inch that way,
and an inch that way.
OK.

00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.080
We're at Eastridge shopping centre
in Mission Bay.

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:56.440
So, we've got a Facebook event
happening so that people know
we're here.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:01.480
And often when we do these events,
we gets lots of people come to see
us, come to meet Emma.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:03.240
Thank you, darling.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.600
Thank you very much.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.600
That's great.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.200
It's just got better and better,
really, as to be so outgoing and
so confident in herself

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.040
and running around and smiling
and enjoying herself.

00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.120
That's for you.
That's great.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:20.800
Would you like a receipt?
No, thank you.

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.680
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thanks for your support. Thank you.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:31.520
She's stepped up as far as meeting
strangers. To see her handle all
these different environments

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.880
and different experiences,
and the shyness is going slowly.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.880
Well done. Well done.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:43.680
I think I've mentioned before, you
know, having two kids with Downs in
the same family.

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:50.960
So, as you can see, they get on
like a house on fire. And this
is demonstrated constantly.

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.880
That's it. Thank you.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.880
I think people, um...

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.520
respect the fact that we're trying
to do something for ourselves

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:04.400
instead of expecting other people to
help us, so, no, it's always a great
response.

Instagram, so 1450 followers.

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:23.640
Social media, it's gone crazy.
It makes us feel what we're doing
is something really worthwhile,

00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.400
because so many people are coming on
board and telling us that.

So, you're wearing all your clothes?
I've got my clothes on.

You've got all your clothes on.
You've got your suitcase packed.
Yes, suitcase.

Where are you going?

00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.120
Where are you gonna go to?
I don't know.

00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.920
Just somewhere. Do you want
to go travelling again?

I don't want.

You don't want toast?

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.920
What are you looking at?
I'm looking at you.
Well, go.

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.920
Hey, excuse me.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.160
Excuse me, kiss me.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.480
Thank you. Love you too.

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.800
The amount of exposure that
we've had has been phenomenal,

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:16.640
and Disney Digital Network
contacted us and said,

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.120
'Look, we want to do an article on
our digital network,' and got a
fantastic response off that.

00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:26.560
And then there was another company
in the States who, obviously,

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:30.960
had connections with Disney somehow
or other, and it's a video
production company called Everhance,

00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:33.840
and they in turn came to us
and said,

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:38.960
'We love what you're doing, and
we're really inspired by it, and we
want to make a promotional video.'

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:43.000
So Everhance came to us and said
that after they finished the video

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.120
and said, 'We've got a connection
with a very famous person, George
Takei, of Star Trek fame.'

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:53.320
Turns out that he's got 10 million
followers, and the bigger it gets,

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.000
the better it gets, because we will
then have to step up production,

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.720
and then we can start
employing other people,

00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:04.680
so the whole idea, really, as we
go further is to create a factory
situation,

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:10.680
get it much bigger so that we
can employ other people with
Down Syndrome.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.520
All our friends are here.

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:19.040
Now you can give the
girls hugs again.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.840
Hello. You can say hi there.
Hi.
Heya.

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:27.920
So, we're at the Franklin Tap House
in Beachlands, which is our local
pub.

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.720
We only come in twice a week.

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.120
And because now, of course, the
support and the following we get
with Downlights,

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.640
now we're getting people coming up
to us and chatting to us when we're
in the pub as well,

00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.880
which is great. Really enjoy it.
There was a really big All Blacks
game on, and we came down for that.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:51.080
And we met a couple of bikers who
were so impressed with the way
that the girls

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:56.640
were enjoying the whole thing,
and they about our story as well,
so they knew what we were doing.

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.480
And they were like, 'Oh, look,
we wanna buy the girls some
All Blacks T-shirts,'

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.560
and then about a week later, I got
a phone call from one of the guys.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:07.600
'Come and meet us in the pub this
afternoon. We've got those T-shirts
for the girls.'

00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.800
So this is again the, you know,
outpouring of generosity,

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.960
and the way that people have been,
the support, is brilliant.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.560
They're just so full of love. Like,
they're just there to have fun

00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.800
and, you know, make the most of
their time. They're just so open
and friendly,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:28.120
and sometimes too friendly.
You know, when you go out, and
they just wanna talk to everyone.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.760
And I'm kinda more reserved,
so I like to stay back a bit,

00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:35.520
but they just— you know, they
love hugs; they love laughing.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.880
A couple of years ago,
I decided— Emma and Nikki's
favourite band were in town,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.440
so we decided last-minute that
I would take them there.

00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.760
And we had a great time, but I
remember talking to this woman
that was next to me,

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.920
and she could, obviously, recognise
Emma and Nikki both had
Down Syndrome,

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.200
and so she started asking me
questions, and I told her that,
you know, they're my sisters.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:58.120
And the amount of praise that I got
from her, I found really unusual,
cos she was saying, you know,

00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:01.480
'You're an incredible sister. How
amazing that you're doing this for
them.'

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.640
But in my mind, I was kinda taken
aback a little bit, cos obviously,
you know, they're my sisters.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:11.240
And I don't really think that
they're that different from
other people,

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.080
so it's kinda the same as if they
didn't have Down Syndrome and I
was taking my sisters out.

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.080
Aw.
(LAUGHS)

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.280
They shouldn't have to stay home
just cos they have special needs.

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.360
You know, they can go out and have
fun, and, like, I probably didn't
even need to be there.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:32.160
They were fine on their own, dancing
and singing, having a great time.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:38.680
Kind of a reality check, I suppose,
that, you know, they are different.
But that's just who they are.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:42.080
I hope that they can be
more independent.

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.840
It'd be great for them to have
dreams and be able to follow
those dreams

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.760
and actually have something that
they want to do, instead of us,
you know, going,

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.520
'Cool, here's an idea.
Let's go through with that,'

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:56.800
and then they have a great time
anyway, but I'd love for them

00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:01.280
to think of stuff on their own to be
like, 'This is what I wanna do.'

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.680
Have a seat. Have a seat here.

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.160
Do you want to sit next to Nik, Em?

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.480
Are you warm enough, Em?

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.360
I hope that they can have a future
which is not dependant on me,

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:24.320
and that's really a big part of what
this is all about, of trying to get
them on that path.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:27.080
I suppose, practically speaking,

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:30.480
I think they're gonna need some sort
of help. They're gonna need some
sort of supervision

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.600
or just a nudge here and there, but
then they keep on surprising me as
well

00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.520
as to how bloody clever they are.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.680
Nikki, can you give
Emma your jacket? Nik?

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.160
If things keep moving as fast as
they have in the last few months,

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.520
then, yeah, I think maybe they
could be living on their own,
and just maybe someone could just

00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:50.360
come in and check on them
occasionally and make sure
everything's OK.

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:58.640
Whatever their independence level
is, I wanna get them up as far as
they possibly can up that ladder.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.600
(BOTH LAUGH)

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.720
I don't think I've
sacrificed anything.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.520
I think I've just done
what all parents do,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.080
and, I mean, OK, you can
call it sacrifice,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:19.200
but it's not sacrifice. We choose.
How is that a sacrifice if you've
chosen to do what you wanna do?

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.800
That's not a sacrifice.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.800
(BOTH LAUGH)

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.800
(GENTLE MUSIC)

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.560
I've started thinking more about
the future, and what happens to
my youngest two kids

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.440
as I get older and
as they get older.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:59.040
I thought I'd start to sit down and
write down some of my thoughts about
my family,

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.960
the children, their lives and...

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:08.200
maybe their hopes and dreams
and my hopes and dreams for them.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.560
I just wanna say that I'm
a very, very lucky man.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.560
I was blessed with the love and
the company of a wonderful woman

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.480
and was lucky enough to
spend 25 years with her.

00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:26.960
I know our greatest achievements
was all of you. Every day, I'm
really proud to be your dad.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.400
Every day, I love you more.

00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:38.280
Every day, I worry for you, and I
know I shouldn't. You're all gonna
do great things.

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.960
Every day, I feel lucky
to have you in my life.

Every Kiwi has a story.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:26.160
Some will challenge you
more than others.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.280
A queen is in the house.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:34.320
(LAUGHS)

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.560
So, you're gonna have to
feel me a little bit later.
(LAUGHS)

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.120
That was so bad.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.520
Jayden, you know it. Come on.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.880
BOTH: Whoo!

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.800
Really appreciate it.
Thank you, bro. Yeah.

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:52.160
Give me a hug, because I love you.
I love you.
