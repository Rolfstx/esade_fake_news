00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
Female Speaker: If you
would, please

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.600
pray with me.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:06.967
Almighty God, we pause
at the beginning

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:10.433
of this historic event to ask
for your presence

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:12.200
in this place.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.834
Allow your spirit to move
among all of us gathered

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:18.867
here, as we give honor
to one who demonstrated

00:00:18.867 --> 00:00:22.333
virtues on which this
nation was founded.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:25.033
We would be reminded again
of your grace that

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:28.400
has allowed this country it's
freedoms that so many,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.266
like corporal Kyle
Carpenter,

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:33.300
have scarified to defend.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.533
God, we would ask that you
adhere our gratitude

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:38.500
for molding Corporal
Carpenter's character.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.100
Through the love of his
gracious family,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.734
and the support of his countless
friends and mentors,

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:47.533
know of our deep appreciation
for this marines

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.100
faithfulness, that when
faced that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.900
day in March with the crucible
of self preservation

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.967
or self sacrifice, he responded
with valor or intrepidity,

00:00:58.967 --> 00:01:03.367
to safeguard the life of
his friend Nick Euphraseo.

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:05.300
And now, as the nationals
highest award

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.166
for such amendable selflessness
and courage is draped around

00:01:09.166 --> 00:01:11.900
corporal Carpenters neck,
and circle

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.633
him with the depth of your
steadfast love.

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:19.500
Sanctify his innermost and
unspoken thoughts,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.934
so that as he carries the
unfathomable weight

00:01:21.934 --> 00:01:26.066
of this honor, he can be
enabled and emboldened

00:01:26.066 --> 00:01:29.367
to speak on behalf of, and
encourage those

00:01:29.367 --> 00:01:32.967
whose untold sacrifices and
humble service

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:36.633
need his firm and
compassionate voice.

00:01:36.633 --> 00:01:38.967
We lift up in prayer all
those who remain

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:42.533
in harms way throughout the
globe, and pray your abiding

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:44.867
grace on the family and
friends

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:47.667
of the marines, sailors, soldiers.

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:50.133
Airmen and coastguardsmen
who have given

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:53.166
their lives in service of
this country.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:55.200
Bestow your wisdom
on those endeavors.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.900
May all of us, as
Americans,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.000
yield ourselves to our
divine guidance,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.633
and follow the examples as
these, our heroes who loved

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:11.400
country, more, more than self,
and mercy more than life.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.367
God Bless America.

00:02:13.367 --> 00:02:14.667
Amen.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:21.633
The President: Thank
you, everybody.

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:22.166
Please be seated.

00:02:25.967 --> 00:02:27.500
On behalf of Michelle and
myself,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.333
welcome to the White House.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.500
The man you see before you
today,

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.100
Corporal William Kyle Carpenter,
should not be alive today.

00:02:44.834 --> 00:02:45.834
Hand grenades are one

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:50.133
of the most awful weapons of war.

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:52.133
They only weigh about a
pound,

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:55.166
but they're packed with TNT.

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:58.233
If one lands nearby, you
have mere seconds

00:02:58.233 --> 00:03:01.000
to seek cover.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.233
When it detonates, its
fragments shoot

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:04.300
out in every direction.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.633
And even at a distance,
that spray of shrapnel

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:10.433
can inflict devastating
injuries

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:12.567
on the human body.

00:03:12.567 --> 00:03:14.467
Up close, it's almost
certain death.

00:03:14.467 --> 00:03:20.367
But we are here because
this man,

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:25.934
this United States Marine, faced
down that terrible

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.800
explosive power, that
unforgiving force,

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.200
with his own body -- willingly
and deliberately --

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.200
to protect a fellow Marine.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.967
When that grenade
exploded,

00:03:40.967 --> 00:03:44.400
Kyle Carpenter's body took the
brunt of the blast.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.233
His injuries were
called "catastrophic."

00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:52.700
It seemed as if he
was going to die.

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.400
While being treated, he
went into cardiac

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.433
arrest, and three times,
he flatlined.

00:04:01.433 --> 00:04:03.133
Three times, doctors
brought him back.

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:09.800
Along with his parents,
who call Kyle's survival

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.900
"our miracle," we
thank God they did.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.533
Because with that singular
act of courage,

00:04:18.533 --> 00:04:22.633
Kyle, you not only saved your
brother in arms,

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:25.100
you displayed a heroism in the
blink

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.934
of an eye that will inspire for
generations valor worthy

00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:33.400
of our nation's highest military
decoration,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400
the Medal of Honor.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.033
Now, Kyle and I have
actually met before.

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:42.600
During his long recovery
at Walter Reed,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.867
he and some of our other wounded
warriors came

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:48.233
to the White House to celebrate
the World Series champion,

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:50.567
the St. Louis Cardinals.

00:04:50.567 --> 00:04:51.567
Some of you might be
aware,

00:04:51.567 --> 00:04:52.867
I am a White Sox fan.

00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:54.500
(laughter)

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.100
Kyle likes the Braves.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.767
So it was a tough
day for both of us.

00:04:58.767 --> 00:05:00.433
(laughter)

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:04.066
But after the ceremony,
Michelle

00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:06.033
and I had the chance to meet Kyle.

00:05:06.033 --> 00:05:07.033
And at the time,

00:05:07.033 --> 00:05:09.300
he was still undergoing surgeries.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.266
But he was up and he
was walking,

00:05:11.266 --> 00:05:14.900
and he was working his way
toward being independent again,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:19.333
towards the man
you see here today.

00:05:19.333 --> 00:05:22.967
And, Kyle, the main
message we want

00:05:22.967 --> 00:05:24.600
to send is, welcome back.

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.834
We are so proud
to have you here.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.967
We just spent some time
not just with Kyle,

00:05:29.967 --> 00:05:32.367
but also with his
wonderful family.

00:05:32.367 --> 00:05:36.266
And anybody who has had a
chance to get to know

00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:40.200
this young man knows
you're not going

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.467
to get a better example of what
you want in an American

00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:47.734
or a Marine.

00:05:47.734 --> 00:05:50.467
Despite all the attention,
he's still the same humble

00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:52.567
guy from Gilbert, South
Carolina,

00:05:52.567 --> 00:05:57.300
population of about 600 -- I
guess today

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.967
it's only population 590-something.

00:06:00.967 --> 00:06:02.433
(laughter)

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:06.100
These days he's also at
the University

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.233
of South Carolina, "just a
normal college student,"

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:14.467
he says, cheering for
the Gamecocks.

00:06:14.467 --> 00:06:16.734
You'll notice that Kyle
doesn't hide his scars;

00:06:16.734 --> 00:06:19.433
he's proud of them, and
the service

00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:22.266
that they represent.

00:06:22.266 --> 00:06:24.633
And, now, he tells me
this,

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:27.934
and so I'm just quoting him --
he says, "the girls

00:06:27.934 --> 00:06:28.600
definitely like them."

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.633
(laughter)

00:06:29.633 --> 00:06:33.567
So he's kind of
-- he's working an angle

00:06:33.567 --> 00:06:34.100
on this thing.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.800
(laughter)

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.166
I wasn't sure
whether I was supposed

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.133
to say that in front of mom.

00:06:40.133 --> 00:06:41.667
(laughter)

00:06:41.667 --> 00:06:42.867
But
there's a quote there.

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:46.900
In addition to our many
distinguished guests,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.700
I want to welcome those who
made this man

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.300
the Marine that he is -- Kyle's
father, Jim;

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:59.200
Kyle's lovely mom, Robin; and
his brothers, Price,

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.767
and Peyton, one of whom is
going to be joining

00:07:02.767 --> 00:07:07.800
Kyle at South Carolina, another
Gamecock,

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.066
and then we've got one who's
going to be at The Citadel.

00:07:12.433 --> 00:07:14.934
We also have Kyle's Marine
brothers who served

00:07:14.934 --> 00:07:18.000
with him in Afghanistan and
through his recovery.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
And I also want to welcome
the members

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.934
of the Medal of Honor Society,
whose ranks Kyle joins today.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.433
Kyle and his fellow
Marines served during

00:07:28.433 --> 00:07:31.734
the surge of forces that I
ordered to Afghanistan

00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:34.367
early in my presidency.

00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:36.667
Their mission was to drive
the Taliban

00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:40.233
out of their strongholds,
protect the Afghan people

00:07:40.233 --> 00:07:42.266
and give them a chance to
reclaim their communities.

00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:45.000
Kyle and his platoon were
in Helmand province

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.300
in Marja, pushing their way
across open fields

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:52.033
and muddy canals, bearing
their heavy packs

00:07:52.033 --> 00:07:55.834
even as it could heat up
to 115 degrees.

00:07:55.834 --> 00:07:58.300
In one small village, they
turned

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.567
a dusty compound into their base.

00:08:01.567 --> 00:08:04.533
The insurgents nearby gave
their answer with sniper

00:08:04.533 --> 00:08:06.433
fire, and automatic weapon fire,

00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:09.400
and rocket-propelled grenades.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.667
That morning, Kyle said,

00:08:10.667 --> 00:08:14.033
"our alarm clock was
AK-47 fire."

00:08:15.367 --> 00:08:17.533
Some of the men were by
their bunks,

00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:19.300
gearing up for another day.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:21.734
Some were heating
up their MREs.

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:24.467
Some were in makeshift ops
centers --

00:08:24.467 --> 00:08:28.300
a simple mud building --
planning the day's patrols.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.900
And up on the roof, behind
a circle of sandbags,

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.300
two Marines manned their
posts --

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:40.433
Kyle, and Lance Corporal
Nicholas Eufrazio.

00:08:40.433 --> 00:08:42.867
The compound started
to take fire.

00:08:42.867 --> 00:08:45.266
Seeking cover, Kyle and
Nick laid down

00:08:45.266 --> 00:08:49.567
low on their backs behind
those sandbags.

00:08:49.567 --> 00:08:53.166
And then the grenade
landed with a thud,

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:54.734
its pin already pulled.

00:08:54.734 --> 00:08:56.200
It was about to explode.

00:08:57.734 --> 00:09:00.934
And Kyle has no memory
of what happened next.

00:09:00.934 --> 00:09:03.734
What we do know is that
there on that rooftop

00:09:03.734 --> 00:09:06.166
he wasn't just with a fellow
Marine,

00:09:06.166 --> 00:09:09.367
he was with his best friend.

00:09:09.367 --> 00:09:11.533
Kyle and Nick had
met in training.

00:09:11.533 --> 00:09:13.333
In Afghanistan they
patrolled together,

00:09:13.333 --> 00:09:17.934
day and night, a friendship
forged in fire.

00:09:17.934 --> 00:09:20.533
Kyle says about Nick, "He
was my point

00:09:20.533 --> 00:09:22.967
man, and I loved him like a brother."

00:09:24.467 --> 00:09:26.500
When the grenade landed,
other Marines

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.367
in the compound looked up
and saw it happen.

00:09:29.367 --> 00:09:30.633
Kyle tried to stand.

00:09:30.633 --> 00:09:32.967
He lunged forward toward
that grenade,

00:09:32.967 --> 00:09:38.300
and then he disappeared
into the blast.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.300
Keep in mind, at the time,

00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.300
Kyle was just 21 years old.

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.400
But in that instant, he
fulfilled those words

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:47.967
of Scripture: "Greater love
hath no man than this;

00:09:47.967 --> 00:09:52.900
that a man lay down his
life for his friends."

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:56.500
They found Kyle lying face
down,

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.600
directly over the blast area.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.266
His helmet was
riddled with holes.

00:10:00.266 --> 00:10:02.433
His gear was melted.

00:10:02.433 --> 00:10:06.300
Part of his Kevlar
vest was blown away.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.433
One of the doctors who
treated him later

00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:10.467
said Kyle was "literally wounded
from the

00:10:10.467 --> 00:10:12.166
top of his head to his feet."

00:10:14.166 --> 00:10:17.900
And for a moment, Kyle
was still conscious.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.734
His eyes were open
but he couldn't see.

00:10:21.734 --> 00:10:23.767
Kyle remembers "everything
went white."

00:10:23.767 --> 00:10:26.433
And yet, even then, his
thoughts

00:10:26.433 --> 00:10:27.433
were not of himself.

00:10:27.433 --> 00:10:31.400
One of the Marines who was
there remembers

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.600
how Kyle kept asking one question,

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.934
and that was whether Nick was okay.

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:39.700
And then, as Kyle's
strength drained away,

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.500
he sensed the end was coming.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.233
So according to Kyle's
memories,

00:10:45.233 --> 00:10:48.700
"My last thought (was to) make
peace with God.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.533
I asked for forgiveness.

00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:52.667
I was trying to make the
best and

00:10:52.667 --> 00:10:54.300
most of my last few seconds
here on Earth."

00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:00.300
The Medal of Honor is
presented for gallantry

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.500
on the battlefield.

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.100
But today, we also
recognize Kyle Carpenter

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:11.300
for his valor since in the
hard fight for recovery.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.667
Eventually, Kyle woke up
after

00:11:13.667 --> 00:11:16.433
five weeks in a coma.

00:11:16.433 --> 00:11:18.367
I want you to consider
what Kyle has endured

00:11:18.367 --> 00:11:20.467
just to stand here today --
more than

00:11:20.467 --> 00:11:25.100
two and a half years in the hospital.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.800
Grueling rehabilitation.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:30.533
Brain surgery to remove
shrapnel from his head.

00:11:30.533 --> 00:11:33.500
Nearly 40 surgeries to
repair a collapsed lung,

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.533
fractured fingers, a
shattered right

00:11:35.533 --> 00:11:39.233
arm broken in more than 30
places, multiple skin grafts.

00:11:39.233 --> 00:11:42.967
He has a new prosthetic
eye, a new jaw,

00:11:42.967 --> 00:11:45.800
new teeth -- and one hell
of a smile.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.066
(laughter)

00:11:51.133 --> 00:11:54.800
And Kyle is the first to
give credit elsewhere.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:56.367
His doctors at Bethesda,
he says,

00:11:56.367 --> 00:11:58.967
"put me back together well."

00:11:58.967 --> 00:12:01.767
Today is also a reminder
that in past wars,

00:12:01.767 --> 00:12:04.400
somebody with injuries as
severe as Kyle's probably

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.967
wouldn't have survived.

00:12:05.967 --> 00:12:08.333
So many of our wounded
warriors from today's wars

00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:12.500
are alive not just because
of remarkable advances

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.367
in technology, but
primarily because

00:12:16.367 --> 00:12:19.967
of the extraordinary dedication
and skill of our military

00:12:19.967 --> 00:12:22.100
and our VA medical
professionals.

00:12:22.934 --> 00:12:24.867
So we need to keep doing
everything we can

00:12:24.867 --> 00:12:27.033
in our power to give our wounded
warriors and those

00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:29.400
who treat them the support
that they need.

00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.367
And I think this is a
wonderful opportunity

00:12:31.367 --> 00:12:35.233
to ask doctors Debra Malone
and Lauren Greer,

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:37.734
and the rest of Kyle's medical
team who are here

00:12:37.734 --> 00:12:38.734
to please stand.

00:12:38.734 --> 00:12:40.734
I see their amazing
work every time

00:12:40.734 --> 00:12:45.734
I visit Bethesda, every time I
visited Walter Reed.

00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:46.834
It's pretty rare where
you've

00:12:46.834 --> 00:12:48.967
got a job where you just know
you're doing God's

00:12:48.967 --> 00:12:50.367
work every single day.

00:12:50.367 --> 00:12:53.667
And they do an incredible
job, so thank you.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:13:11.967
(applause)

00:13:11.967 --> 00:13:14.967
Thank you for
the miracles

00:13:14.967 --> 00:13:18.367
you work for our wounded troops
and veterans.

00:13:18.367 --> 00:13:21.367
Now, Kyle says he'll wear
this medal

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:24.500
for all who serve and for those
who didn't make it back,

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:27.700
and for those who
struggle still.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.900
So today, we also honor
two members of his team

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.600
who made the ultimate
sacrifice in that

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.934
deployment: Kyle's friends
Lance Corporal

00:13:34.934 --> 00:13:38.100
Timothy M. Jackson of Corbin,
Kentucky,

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.133
and Lance Corporal Dakota R.

00:13:40.133 --> 00:13:42.834
Huse of Greenwood,
Louisiana.

00:13:42.834 --> 00:13:45.433
And our thoughts are also
with the Marine

00:13:45.433 --> 00:13:50.533
who Kyle saved that day,
his brother, Nick.

00:13:50.533 --> 00:13:52.433
I had the opportunity to
meet Nick as well nearly

00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:55.233
two years after the blast
on one of my visits

00:13:55.233 --> 00:13:56.700
to Walter Reed.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.834
Nick also suffered
grievous wounds.

00:13:59.834 --> 00:14:01.600
As a result of traumatic
brain injury,

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.967
he couldn't speak for more
than a year.

00:14:03.967 --> 00:14:06.700
He also endured
multiple surgeries.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.533
Today, his recovery
continues.

00:14:08.533 --> 00:14:10.867
He lives at home with
his family in Plymouth,

00:14:10.867 --> 00:14:14.300
Massachusetts, where he is
watching this ceremony.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:17.400
So, Nick, on behalf of all
of us, I want you

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.967
to know we honor your
sacrifice as well.

00:14:19.967 --> 00:14:22.600
Your perseverance
is an inspiration.

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.400
And just as Kyle was there
for you, our nation

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.166
will be there for you and
your family

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:29.633
as you grow stronger in the
years ahead.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:37.467
If any of our wounded
warriors seek an example

00:14:37.467 --> 00:14:41.600
-- let me amend that -- if
any American seeks

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.834
a model of the strength and
resilience that

00:14:43.834 --> 00:14:50.400
define us as a people, including
this newest 9/11

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:55.033
generation, I want
you to consider Kyle.

00:14:55.033 --> 00:14:58.133
After everything he's
been through, he skis,

00:14:58.133 --> 00:15:01.233
he snowboards, he's jumped
from a plane --

00:15:01.233 --> 00:15:02.500
with a parachute, thankfully.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:03.533
(laughter)

00:15:03.533 --> 00:15:07.100
He trudged
through a 6-mile Mud Run,

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.200
completed the Marine Corps
Marathon, says he wants

00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:12.300
to do a triathlon.

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:16.867
He's a motivational
speaker, an advocate

00:15:16.867 --> 00:15:19.600
for his fellow
wounded warriors.

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.367
He's thinking about
majoring in psychology

00:15:21.367 --> 00:15:24.800
so he can use his own
experiences

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.834
to help others.

00:15:26.834 --> 00:15:28.834
He got stellar grades.

00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:33.066
And, by the way, he's only
24 years old, and says,

00:15:33.066 --> 00:15:34.166
"I am just getting started."

00:15:36.133 --> 00:15:38.300
In other words, Kyle is a
shining example of what

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:40.467
our nation needs to
encourage --

00:15:40.467 --> 00:15:42.667
these veterans who come home and
then use their incredible

00:15:42.667 --> 00:15:44.767
skills and talents to
keep our country strong.

00:15:44.767 --> 00:15:47.900
And we can all learn
from Kyle's example.

00:15:49.567 --> 00:15:51.734
As we prepare for the
reading of the citation,

00:15:51.734 --> 00:15:56.200
I'd like to close with his
own words -- a message,

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.633
I think, for every American.

00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:01.934
"It took a life-changing
event to get

00:16:01.934 --> 00:16:04.667
me to truly appreciate the
precious and amazing life

00:16:04.667 --> 00:16:06.834
I have been blessed with.

00:16:06.834 --> 00:16:08.734
Please take it from me,
enjoy every day

00:16:08.734 --> 00:16:12.233
to the fullest, don't take life
too seriously,

00:16:12.233 --> 00:16:15.633
always try to make it count,
appreciate the small

00:16:15.633 --> 00:16:19.934
and simple things, be kind and
help others,

00:16:19.934 --> 00:16:22.433
let the ones you love always
know you love them,

00:16:22.433 --> 00:16:24.567
and when things get hard trust
there is a bigger plan

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.100
and that you will be stronger for it."

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.133
Pretty good message.

00:16:32.367 --> 00:16:34.533
Corporal William Kyle
Carpenter should

00:16:34.533 --> 00:16:37.033
not be alive today, but the fact
that he is gives

00:16:37.033 --> 00:16:40.633
us reason to trust that there is
indeed a bigger plan.

00:16:40.633 --> 00:16:42.900
So God bless you, Kyle.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:47.233
God bless all who serve
and protect

00:16:47.233 --> 00:16:50.133
the precious and amazing life
that we are blessed with.

00:16:50.133 --> 00:16:51.967
May God continue to bless
and keep strong

00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:53.667
the United States of America.

00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:54.967
Semper Fi.

00:16:54.967 --> 00:17:08.467
(applause)

00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:13.667
Military Aide: The
President of the

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:15.734
United States, in the name of
the Congress,

00:17:15.734 --> 00:17:19.734
takes pleasure in presenting the
Medal of Honor to Lance Corporal

00:17:19.734 --> 00:17:22.467
William Kyle Carpenter,
United States Marine

00:17:22.467 --> 00:17:26.166
Corps, for conspicuous
gallantry and intrepidity

00:17:26.166 --> 00:17:28.333
at the risk of his life
above and beyond the call

00:17:28.333 --> 00:17:31.166
of duty while serving as
an automatic rifleman with

00:17:31.166 --> 00:17:35.400
Company F, 2nd Battalion,
9th Marines, Regimental

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.767
Combat Team One, 1st
Marine Division (Forward),

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:41.367
1st Marine Expeditionary
Force (Forward),

00:17:41.367 --> 00:17:43.800
in Helmand Province,
Afghanistan in support

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:47.600
of Operation Enduring Freedom
on 21 November, 2010.

00:17:48.367 --> 00:17:50.400
Lance Corporal Carpenter
was a member

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:53.166
of a platoon-sized coalition
force comprised

00:17:53.166 --> 00:17:55.633
of two reinforced Marine rifle
squads,

00:17:55.633 --> 00:17:58.333
partnered with an Afghan
National Army squad.

00:17:58.333 --> 00:17:59.433
The platoon had
established

00:17:59.433 --> 00:18:02.900
Patrol Base Dakota two days
earlier in a small village

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:06.333
in the Marja District in order
to disrupt enemy activity

00:18:06.333 --> 00:18:08.934
and provide security for the
local Afghan population.

00:18:09.934 --> 00:18:12.166
Lance Corporal Carpenter
and a fellow Marine

00:18:12.166 --> 00:18:15.033
were manning a rooftop security
position on the perimeter

00:18:15.033 --> 00:18:17.667
of Patrol Base Dakota when
the enemy initiated

00:18:17.667 --> 00:18:19.633
a daylight attack with hand
grenades,

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:23.066
one of which landed inside their
sandbagged position.

00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:26.033
Without hesitation and
with complete disregard

00:18:26.033 --> 00:18:28.967
for his own safety, Lance
Corporal Carpenter moved

00:18:28.967 --> 00:18:31.467
towards the grenade in
an attempt to shield

00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:33.867
his fellow Marine from
the deadly blast.

00:18:33.867 --> 00:18:35.333
When the grenade
detonated,

00:18:35.333 --> 00:18:38.633
his body absorbed the brunt of
the blast, severely wounding

00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:41.400
him but saving the life
of his fellow Marine.

00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:45.633
By his undaunted courage,
bold fighting spirit,

00:18:45.633 --> 00:18:48.033
and unwavering devotion to
duty in the face

00:18:48.033 --> 00:18:51.300
of almost certain death, Lance
Corporal Carpenter

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:53.533
reflected great credit
upon himself

00:18:53.533 --> 00:18:56.000
and upheld the highest
traditions of the Marine Corps

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.734
and the United States
Naval Service.

00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:49.233
(applause)

00:19:52.333 --> 00:19:52.900
Female Speaker:
Let us pray.

00:19:55.266 --> 00:19:57.133
Gracious God, may this
ceremony serve

00:19:57.133 --> 00:20:00.600
as a reminder of the
responsibility that comes

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.066
with receiving the
grace gift of freedom.

00:20:04.066 --> 00:20:06.600
And as we depart the
hallowed all,

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.934
and return to our daily lives,
we pray that you would

00:20:09.934 --> 00:20:13.767
enable and empower us, that when
called upon,

00:20:13.767 --> 00:20:17.233
we would represent the resolute
fearlessness of corporal

00:20:17.233 --> 00:20:20.266
Kyle Carpenter, and all of
us who wear

00:20:20.266 --> 00:20:27.433
the stars of valor to this
country.

00:20:27.433 --> 00:20:30.066
It's in this strength of
your name that we Pray.

00:20:30.066 --> 00:20:31.066
Amen.

00:20:31.066 --> 00:20:35.734
The President: Well,
that brings

00:20:35.734 --> 00:20:38.266
us to the conclusion of this
ceremony,

00:20:38.266 --> 00:20:41.066
but not the reception and party.

00:20:41.066 --> 00:20:44.133
And so I want to thank
everybody again

00:20:44.133 --> 00:20:47.867
for being here, especially
Kyle's wonderful

00:20:47.867 --> 00:20:49.867
family and his parents.

00:20:51.934 --> 00:20:53.934
And I understand that the
food here at the

00:20:53.934 --> 00:20:55.066
White House is pretty good

00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:56.066
-- (laughter) --

00:20:56.066 --> 00:20:57.800
so I already told Kyle's
brothers

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.100
that they should be chowing down.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.133
But that goes for
everybody else as well --

00:21:03.133 --> 00:21:04.367
and I think the
drinks are free.

00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:05.533
I don't know what --
although

00:21:05.533 --> 00:21:06.934
it's still early in the afternoon.

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.900
Thank you very
much, everybody.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.467
Let's give one more round of applause to our latest

00:21:12.467 --> 00:21:13.633
Medal of Honor winner

00:21:13.633 --> 00:21:15.066

00:21:15.066 --> 00:21:17.133
