00:00:12.223 --> 00:00:17.182
My journey away from violent extremism
began 22 years ago,

00:00:17.182 --> 00:00:19.143
when I denounced racism

00:00:19.143 --> 00:00:21.901
and left the American white
supremacist skinhead movement

00:00:21.901 --> 00:00:23.511
that I had helped build.

00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:26.709
(Cheers) (Applause)

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.035
I was just 22 years old at the time,

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:35.066
but I had already spent eight years,
from the time I was 14 years old,

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.360
as one of the earliest
and youngest members

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.936
and an eventual leader

00:00:38.936 --> 00:00:41.872
within America's most violent
hate movement.

00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:45.909
But I wasn't born into hate;

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:48.914
in fact, it was quite the opposite.

00:00:50.287 --> 00:00:53.668
I had a relatively normal childhood.

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:55.729
My parents are Italian immigrants

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.843
who came to the United States
in the mid-1960s

00:00:58.843 --> 00:01:01.546
and settled on the South Side of Chicago,

00:01:01.546 --> 00:01:03.044
where they eventually met

00:01:03.527 --> 00:01:05.589
and opened a small beauty shop.

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:09.884
Right after I was born,
things got a little bit more difficult.

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:14.619
They struggled to survive with raising
a young family and a new business,

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.098
often working seven days a week,

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.317
14 hours a day,

00:01:19.317 --> 00:01:22.946
taking on second and third jobs
just to earn a meager living.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.832
And quality time with my parents
was pretty nonexistent.

00:01:27.396 --> 00:01:29.777
Even though I knew
they loved me very much,

00:01:30.436 --> 00:01:32.865
growing up, I felt abandoned.

00:01:33.517 --> 00:01:36.476
I was lonely, and I started to withdraw,

00:01:37.416 --> 00:01:42.009
and then I started to resent my parents
and become very angry.

00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:45.806
And as I was growing up,
through my teenage years,

00:01:45.806 --> 00:01:49.792
I started to act out to try
and get attention from my parents.

00:01:51.252 --> 00:01:53.816
And one day, when I was 14,

00:01:53.816 --> 00:01:57.564
I was standing in an alley,
and I was smoking a joint,

00:01:58.011 --> 00:02:03.234
and a man who was twice my age,
with a shaved head and tall black boots,

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.071
came up to me,

00:02:05.515 --> 00:02:08.133
and he snatched the joint from my lips.

00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:12.590
Then he put his hand on my shoulder,
and he looked me in the eyes,

00:02:13.054 --> 00:02:14.280
and he said,

00:02:15.153 --> 00:02:18.212
"That's what the communists
and the Jews want you to do

00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:19.795
to keep you docile."

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:22.822
I was 14 years old,

00:02:22.822 --> 00:02:25.585
I'd been trading baseball cards
and watching "Happy Days" -

00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:27.468
I didn't really know what a Jew was.

00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:29.206
(Laughter)

00:02:29.206 --> 00:02:30.381
It's true.

00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:34.380
And the only communist that I knew
was the bad Russian guy

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.482
in my favorite "Rocky" movie.

00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:38.493
(Laughter)

00:02:38.967 --> 00:02:41.198
And since I'm here
baring my soul with you,

00:02:41.212 --> 00:02:45.264
I can reveal that I did not even know
what the word "docile" meant.

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:47.239
(Laughter)

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.538
Dead serious.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.631
But it was as if this man in this alley
had offered me a lifeline.

00:02:53.635 --> 00:02:58.101
For 14 years, I'd felt
marginalized and bullied.

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:00.130
I had low self-esteem.

00:03:00.852 --> 00:03:04.678
And frankly, I didn't know
who I was, where I belonged

00:03:04.678 --> 00:03:06.727
or what my purpose was.

00:03:06.727 --> 00:03:08.055
I was lost.

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.782
And overnight, because this man
had pulled me in,

00:03:12.782 --> 00:03:17.371
and I had grabbed onto that lifeline
with every fiber of my being,

00:03:18.121 --> 00:03:21.247
I had gone from "Joanie Loves Chachi"

00:03:22.484 --> 00:03:24.688
to full-blown Nazi.

00:03:25.046 --> 00:03:26.464
Overnight.

00:03:27.846 --> 00:03:30.967
I started to listen to the rhetoric

00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:32.352
and believe it.

00:03:32.738 --> 00:03:37.130
I started to watch very closely
as the leaders of this organization

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.329
would target vulnerable young people
who felt marginalized

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.883
and then draw them in
with promises of paradise

00:03:46.883 --> 00:03:48.301
that were broken.

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:52.066
And then I started to recruit, myself.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:56.693
I started to do that by making
white power music.

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:03.368
And soon, I became the leader
of that infamous organization

00:04:03.368 --> 00:04:05.966
that was led by that man in that alley

00:04:05.966 --> 00:04:07.829
who recruited me that day,

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.664
who was America's first neo-Nazi skinhead
and who had radicalized me.

00:04:14.762 --> 00:04:16.522
For the next eight years,

00:04:17.066 --> 00:04:20.124
I believed the lies that I had been fed.

00:04:20.602 --> 00:04:23.988
And though I saw
no evidence of it, whatsoever,

00:04:23.988 --> 00:04:28.198
I didn't hesitate to blame
every Jewish person in the world

00:04:28.198 --> 00:04:32.312
for what I thought was a white,
European genocide

00:04:32.312 --> 00:04:36.866
being promoted by them
through a multiculturalist agenda.

00:04:37.863 --> 00:04:39.891
I blamed people of color

00:04:39.891 --> 00:04:44.070
for the crime and violence
and the drugs in the city,

00:04:45.047 --> 00:04:48.978
completely neglecting the fact
that I was committing acts of violence

00:04:48.978 --> 00:04:50.267
on a daily basis,

00:04:50.868 --> 00:04:52.570
and that in many cases,

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.564
it was white supremacists
who were funneling drugs

00:04:55.564 --> 00:04:57.162
into the inner cities.

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:00.593
And I blamed immigrants

00:05:00.597 --> 00:05:04.097
for taking jobs from white Americans,

00:05:04.097 --> 00:05:05.913
completely neglecting the fact

00:05:05.913 --> 00:05:09.132
that my parents
were hardworking immigrants

00:05:09.132 --> 00:05:11.217
who struggled to survive,

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.261
despite not getting help
from anybody else.

00:05:17.156 --> 00:05:18.752
For the next eight years,

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:21.374
I saw friends die,

00:05:22.406 --> 00:05:26.553
I saw others go to prison
and inflict untold pain

00:05:26.553 --> 00:05:29.910
on countless victims
and their families' lives.

00:05:30.876 --> 00:05:34.454
I heard horrific stories
from young women in the movement

00:05:34.454 --> 00:05:39.394
who'd been brutally raped by the very men
they were conditioned to trust.

00:05:41.267 --> 00:05:44.455
And I myself committed acts
of violence against people,

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:47.027
solely for the color of their skin,

00:05:47.027 --> 00:05:48.378
who they loved,

00:05:48.378 --> 00:05:51.190
or the god that they prayed to.

00:05:52.003 --> 00:05:56.000
I stockpiled weapons for what I thought
was an upcoming race war.

00:05:56.469 --> 00:06:01.612
And 25 years ago, I wrote
and performed racist music

00:06:02.872 --> 00:06:05.582
that found its way
to the internet decades later

00:06:05.582 --> 00:06:08.905
and partially inspired
a young white nationalist

00:06:08.905 --> 00:06:13.430
to walk into a sacred church 
in Charleston, South Carolina, 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:17.751
and senselessly massacre
nine innocent people.

00:06:21.106 --> 00:06:22.997
But then my life changed.

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:28.683
At 19 years old, I met a girl
who was not in the movement,

00:06:28.683 --> 00:06:31.561
who didn't have a racist bone in her body,

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:34.195
and I fell in love with her.

00:06:35.107 --> 00:06:37.058
And at 19, we got married,

00:06:37.748 --> 00:06:39.893
and we had our first son.

00:06:41.253 --> 00:06:45.041
And when I held my son in my arms
in the delivery room that day,

00:06:45.612 --> 00:06:50.138
not only did I reconnect
with some of the innocence that I had lost

00:06:50.138 --> 00:06:51.778
at 14 years old,

00:06:52.544 --> 00:06:54.547
but it also began to challenge

00:06:54.547 --> 00:06:58.750
the very important things that drew me
to the movement to begin with:

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.344
identity, community, and purpose -

00:07:01.344 --> 00:07:04.882
things that I had been
struggling with as a young boy.

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:10.064
And now, I struggled
with the concept of who I was again.

00:07:10.064 --> 00:07:14.668
Was I this neo-Nazi hatemonger?

00:07:15.602 --> 00:07:18.548
Or was I a caring father and husband?

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.556
Was my community the one
that I had manufactured around me

00:07:23.556 --> 00:07:25.271
to boost my own ego

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.421
because I felt self-hatred for myself
and I wanted to project it onto others?

00:07:31.525 --> 00:07:35.715
Or was it the one
that I had physically given life to?

00:07:36.846 --> 00:07:39.802
Was my purpose to scorch the earth?

00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:44.897
Or was it to make it
a better place for my family?

00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:50.045
And suddenly, like a ton of bricks hit me,

00:07:50.045 --> 00:07:52.337
I became very confused

00:07:52.337 --> 00:07:55.409
with who I'd been
for the last eight years.

00:07:56.954 --> 00:08:00.298
And if only I'd been brave enough
to walk away at that moment,

00:08:00.302 --> 00:08:05.870
to understand what the struggle was
that was happening inside of me,

00:08:06.643 --> 00:08:09.884
then maybe tragedy
could have been averted.

00:08:10.844 --> 00:08:12.803
Instead, I did compromise.

00:08:12.803 --> 00:08:16.182
I took myself off the streets
for the benefit of my family

00:08:16.182 --> 00:08:20.222
because I was nervous that maybe
I could go to jail or end up dead,

00:08:20.222 --> 00:08:22.249
and they would have to fend
for themselves.

00:08:23.014 --> 00:08:24.626
So I stepped back as a leader,

00:08:24.626 --> 00:08:27.259
and instead, I opened a record store

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.211
that I was going to sell
white power music in, of course,

00:08:32.211 --> 00:08:34.536
because I was importing it in from Europe.

00:08:35.337 --> 00:08:39.522
But I knew that if I was just
a racist store selling racist music,

00:08:39.522 --> 00:08:42.549
the community would not
allow me to be there.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:47.142
So I decided I was going to also
stock the shelves with other music,

00:08:47.142 --> 00:08:49.692
like punk rock and heavy metal

00:08:49.696 --> 00:08:51.163
and hip-hop.

00:08:51.853 --> 00:08:54.284
And while the white power music
that I was selling

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.869
was 75% of my gross revenue -

00:08:56.869 --> 00:09:00.201
because people were driving in
from all over the country to buy it

00:09:00.201 --> 00:09:02.324
from the only store that was selling it -

00:09:03.363 --> 00:09:08.256
I also had customers come in
to buy the other music.

00:09:08.256 --> 00:09:11.603
And eventually, they started
to talk to me.

00:09:12.415 --> 00:09:17.000
One day, a young black teen came in,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.733
and he was visibly upset.

00:09:20.204 --> 00:09:22.534
And I decided to ask him what was wrong.

00:09:23.341 --> 00:09:27.284
And he told me that his mother
had been diagnosed with breast cancer.

00:09:28.294 --> 00:09:31.283
And suddenly, this young black teenager

00:09:31.844 --> 00:09:36.429
who I'd never had a meaningful
conversation or interaction with,

00:09:36.433 --> 00:09:38.192
I was able to connect with

00:09:38.192 --> 00:09:42.221
because my own mother
had been diagnosed with breast cancer,

00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:44.631
and I could feel his pain.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.600
On another occasion, a gay couple
came in with their son,

00:09:49.604 --> 00:09:54.541
and it was undeniable to me
that they loved their son

00:09:54.545 --> 00:09:58.089
in the same profound ways
that I loved mine.

00:09:59.361 --> 00:10:04.245
And suddenly, I couldn't rationalize
or justify the prejudice

00:10:04.245 --> 00:10:05.863
that I had in my head.

00:10:06.997 --> 00:10:09.849
I decided to pull the white power
music from the inventory

00:10:09.849 --> 00:10:13.192
when I became too embarrassed
to sell it in front of my new friends.

00:10:14.057 --> 00:10:16.452
And of course, the store
couldn't sustain itself,

00:10:16.452 --> 00:10:17.747
so I had to close it.

00:10:18.471 --> 00:10:23.102
At that same time, I lost
nearly everything in my life.

00:10:23.612 --> 00:10:26.156
I used it as an opportunity to walk away

00:10:26.156 --> 00:10:29.028
from the movement that I'd been
a part of for eight years,

00:10:29.028 --> 00:10:33.604
the only identity, community, and purpose
that I'd really known for most of my life.

00:10:34.077 --> 00:10:35.663
So I had nobody.

00:10:36.859 --> 00:10:39.495
I lost my livelihood
because I closed the store.

00:10:39.495 --> 00:10:43.465
I didn't have a great relationship
with my parents, even though they tried.

00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:46.056
And my wife and children left me

00:10:46.056 --> 00:10:49.855
because I hadn't left the movement
and disengaged quickly enough.

00:10:51.168 --> 00:10:52.562
And suddenly,

00:10:54.245 --> 00:10:56.216
I didn't know who I was again,

00:10:56.216 --> 00:10:57.660
or where I fit in,

00:10:58.172 --> 00:11:00.542
or what my purpose was supposed to be.

00:11:01.562 --> 00:11:03.879
I was miserable inside,

00:11:04.487 --> 00:11:07.502
and I often woke up in the morning

00:11:07.502 --> 00:11:09.030
wishing that I hadn't.

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:12.008
About five years in,

00:11:12.008 --> 00:11:15.678
one of the few friends that I had
was concerned about my well-being,

00:11:15.678 --> 00:11:17.809
and she came to me and she said,

00:11:17.809 --> 00:11:21.248
"You need to do something
because I don't want to see you die."

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.288
And she suggested that I go
apply for a job where she worked,

00:11:26.292 --> 00:11:28.091
at a company called IBM.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.809
Yeah, I thought she was crazy, too.

00:11:31.809 --> 00:11:33.528
(Laughter)

00:11:33.528 --> 00:11:38.137
Here I was, a closeted ex-Nazi
covered in hate tattoos.

00:11:38.137 --> 00:11:39.593
I didn't go to college.

00:11:39.593 --> 00:11:43.432
I'd been kicked out of multiple
high schools multiple times.

00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:46.548
I didn't even own a computer.

00:11:47.942 --> 00:11:49.248
But I went in,

00:11:49.248 --> 00:11:52.852
and somehow, miraculously, I got the job.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:56.803
And then I became terrified to learn

00:11:56.807 --> 00:12:00.428
that they'd actually be putting me
back at my old high school -

00:12:00.428 --> 00:12:02.867
the same one I got kicked out of twice -

00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:05.539
to install their computers.

00:12:06.411 --> 00:12:09.948
This was a high school
where I had committed acts of violence

00:12:09.948 --> 00:12:12.424
against students, against faculty;

00:12:12.424 --> 00:12:16.608
where I had protested out in front
of the school for equal rights for whites

00:12:16.608 --> 00:12:19.701
and even had a sit-in in the cafeteria

00:12:19.701 --> 00:12:22.179
to try and demand a white student union.

00:12:23.450 --> 00:12:26.055
And of course, as karma would have it,

00:12:26.697 --> 00:12:28.532
within the first couple of hours,

00:12:29.084 --> 00:12:33.066
who walks right by me
but Mr. Johnny Holmes,

00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:36.416
the tough black security guard
I had gotten in a fistfight with,

00:12:37.374 --> 00:12:39.354
that got me kicked out the second time

00:12:39.354 --> 00:12:42.132
and led out in handcuffs from the school.

00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:44.736
He didn't recognize me,

00:12:45.609 --> 00:12:47.001
but I saw him,

00:12:47.582 --> 00:12:48.964
and I didn't know what to do.

00:12:48.964 --> 00:12:52.891
I was frozen; I was this grown man now,
years out of the movement,

00:12:52.891 --> 00:12:54.936
and I was sweating, and I was trembling.

00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:58.045
But I decided I had to do something.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:03.109
And I decided I needed to suffer
under the weight of my past

00:13:03.109 --> 00:13:06.004
because for five years
I had tried to outrun it.

00:13:06.363 --> 00:13:09.717
I'd tried to make new friends
and cover my tattoos with long sleeves,

00:13:09.717 --> 00:13:10.842
and I wouldn't admit it

00:13:10.842 --> 00:13:12.754
because I was afraid of being judged

00:13:12.754 --> 00:13:14.969
the same way I had judged other people.

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.204
Well, I decided I was going to chase
Mr. Holmes out to the parking lot -

00:13:20.204 --> 00:13:22.681
probably not the smartest
decision that I made.

00:13:22.681 --> 00:13:23.986
(Laughter)

00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:26.514
But when I found him,
he was getting into his car,

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:28.501
and I tapped him on the shoulder.

00:13:28.501 --> 00:13:31.681
And when he turned around,
and he recognized me,

00:13:31.681 --> 00:13:34.232
he took a step back because he was afraid.

00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:37.892
And I didn't know what to say.

00:13:39.346 --> 00:13:43.416
Finally, the words came out of my mouth,
and all I could think to say was,

00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:44.851
"I'm sorry."

00:13:45.354 --> 00:13:46.830
And he embraced me,

00:13:47.649 --> 00:13:49.418
and he forgave me.

00:13:51.135 --> 00:13:54.331
And he encouraged me to forgive myself.

00:13:55.331 --> 00:14:01.415
He recognized that it wasn't the story
of some broken go-nowhere kid

00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:04.491
who was going to just
join a gang and go to prison.

00:14:04.491 --> 00:14:09.038
He knew that this was the story
of every young person who was vulnerable,

00:14:09.038 --> 00:14:11.890
who was searching for identity,
community, and purpose,

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:13.310
and then hit a wall

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:15.056
and was unable to find it

00:14:15.056 --> 00:14:17.047
and went down a dark path.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.953
And he made me promise one thing -

00:14:20.957 --> 00:14:24.215
that I would tell my story
to whoever would listen.

00:14:24.215 --> 00:14:25.841
That was 18 years ago,

00:14:25.841 --> 00:14:27.613
and I've been doing it ever since.

00:14:28.095 --> 00:14:30.699
(Applause)

00:14:38.657 --> 00:14:40.525
You might be asking yourself right now:

00:14:40.525 --> 00:14:43.651
How does a good kid 
from a hardworking immigrant family

00:14:43.651 --> 00:14:46.532
end up going down such a dark path?

00:14:46.532 --> 00:14:49.252
One word: potholes.

00:14:49.866 --> 00:14:51.624
That's right, potholes.

00:14:51.624 --> 00:14:54.241
I had a lot of potholes when I was a kid.

00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:56.515
We all had them -

00:14:56.515 --> 00:14:59.399
you know, the things in life that we hit

00:14:59.403 --> 00:15:02.359
that invariably just kind 
of nudge us off our path,

00:15:02.359 --> 00:15:04.255
and if they remain unresolved

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.159
or untreated

00:15:07.055 --> 00:15:08.556
or not dealt with,

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.913
sometimes we can get dangerously lost
down pretty dark corridors.

00:15:13.586 --> 00:15:15.819
Potholes can be things like trauma,

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:18.360
abuse, unemployment,

00:15:19.025 --> 00:15:20.184
neglect,

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.212
untreated mental health conditions,

00:15:23.226 --> 00:15:24.417
even privilege.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.448
And if we hit enough potholes
on our journey in life,

00:15:29.054 --> 00:15:32.824
and we don't have the resources
or the help to navigate around them

00:15:32.824 --> 00:15:34.205
or to pull us out,

00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:38.735
well, sometimes good people
end up doing bad things.

00:15:41.384 --> 00:15:44.553
One such person
who had potholes is Darrell.

00:15:44.553 --> 00:15:46.438
Darrell is from Upstate New York.

00:15:46.853 --> 00:15:49.028
He had read my memoir,

00:15:49.028 --> 00:15:51.719
and he was really upset about the ending.

00:15:51.723 --> 00:15:53.589
You see, I'd gotten out of the movement,

00:15:53.589 --> 00:15:55.113
and he was still in.

00:15:55.113 --> 00:15:58.844
And he emailed me, and he said,

00:15:58.844 --> 00:16:01.206
"I didn't really like the way
that turned out."

00:16:01.206 --> 00:16:02.934
And I said, "Well, I'm sorry."

00:16:02.938 --> 00:16:04.597
(Laughter)

00:16:04.597 --> 00:16:07.612
"But if you want to talk about it,
we could certainly do that."

00:16:07.612 --> 00:16:10.760
And after a couple of weeks
of going back and forth with Darrell,

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.888
I learned he was a 31-year-old
military veteran who had been injured

00:16:15.888 --> 00:16:19.631
and was really angry about
not being able to go to Afghanistan

00:16:19.631 --> 00:16:21.076
to kill Muslims.

00:16:22.009 --> 00:16:23.434
And one day, on the phone,

00:16:23.434 --> 00:16:27.607
he told me that he had seen
a Muslim man in the park, praying,

00:16:27.611 --> 00:16:31.788
and that all he wanted to do
was kick him in the face.

00:16:32.695 --> 00:16:34.754
I flew to Buffalo the next day,

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.190
and I sat down with Darrell,

00:16:37.833 --> 00:16:39.145
and I asked him,

00:16:39.661 --> 00:16:43.216
"Have you ever met
a Muslim person before?"

00:16:43.486 --> 00:16:45.072
And he said, "No!

00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:46.847
Why the hell would I want to do that?

00:16:46.847 --> 00:16:49.650
They're evil. I don't want
anything to do with them."

00:16:50.385 --> 00:16:51.845
I said, "OK."

00:16:51.845 --> 00:16:54.171
So I excused myself,
and I went into the bathroom

00:16:54.171 --> 00:16:56.549
and I took my phone out in the bathroom,

00:16:56.549 --> 00:16:58.656
and I googled the local mosque.

00:16:59.295 --> 00:17:01.612
I called them very quietly
from the bathroom,

00:17:01.612 --> 00:17:05.564
and I said, "Excuse me,
imam, I need a favor.

00:17:05.568 --> 00:17:06.799
I have a Christian man

00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:09.473
who would really love to learn more
about your religion."

00:17:09.473 --> 00:17:11.488
(Laughter)

00:17:12.301 --> 00:17:14.040
"Do you mind if we stop by?"

00:17:15.596 --> 00:17:18.440
Well, it took some convincing
for Darrell to go,

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:20.356
but, finally, we got there.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:22.036
And when I knocked on the door,

00:17:22.036 --> 00:17:25.200
the imam said he only had
15 minutes left for us

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:27.744
because he was preparing
for a prayer service.

00:17:27.744 --> 00:17:28.925
I said, "We'll take it."

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:30.778
We went in,

00:17:30.778 --> 00:17:36.275
and two and a half hours later,
we came out after hugging and crying

00:17:36.275 --> 00:17:39.981
and, very strangely, bonding
over Chuck Norris for some reason.

00:17:39.981 --> 00:17:41.045
(Laughter)

00:17:41.045 --> 00:17:43.011
I don't know what it was about,

00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:44.637
but that's what happened.

00:17:45.777 --> 00:17:48.821
And I'm happy to say now
that Darrell and the imam,

00:17:48.821 --> 00:17:51.367
you can often find them
at the local falafel stand,

00:17:51.367 --> 00:17:53.006
having lunch together.

00:17:53.006 --> 00:17:55.585
(Applause)

00:18:01.736 --> 00:18:04.367
You see, it's our disconnection
from each other.

00:18:04.367 --> 00:18:06.634
Hatred is born of ignorance.

00:18:06.634 --> 00:18:10.727
Fear is its father,
and isolation is its mother.

00:18:10.727 --> 00:18:14.718
When we don't understand something,
we tend to be afraid of it,

00:18:14.722 --> 00:18:16.461
and if we keep ourselves from it,

00:18:16.465 --> 00:18:19.612
that fear grows, and sometimes
it turns into hatred.

00:18:20.948 --> 00:18:23.922
Since I've left the movement,
I've helped over a hundred people

00:18:23.922 --> 00:18:27.876
disengage from extremist movements,
from white supremacist groups ...

00:18:27.876 --> 00:18:30.366
(Applause)

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.042
... to even jihadist groups.

00:18:38.046 --> 00:18:42.597
And the way I do that
is not by arguing with them,

00:18:42.597 --> 00:18:44.184
not by debating them,

00:18:44.184 --> 00:18:46.497
not by even telling them they're wrong -

00:18:46.497 --> 00:18:48.754
even though, boy, I want to sometimes.

00:18:48.754 --> 00:18:50.092
I don't do that.

00:18:50.552 --> 00:18:53.110
Instead, I don't push them away.

00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:54.739
I draw them in closer,

00:18:55.438 --> 00:18:59.801
and I listen very closely
for their potholes,

00:19:00.403 --> 00:19:02.252
and then I begin to fill them in.

00:19:02.715 --> 00:19:05.011
I try to make people more resilient,

00:19:05.011 --> 00:19:06.919
more self-confident,

00:19:06.919 --> 00:19:11.018
more able to have skills
to compete in the marketplace

00:19:11.018 --> 00:19:14.014
so that they don't have
to blame the other,

00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:16.886
the other that they've never met.

00:19:17.816 --> 00:19:21.846
I'd like to just leave you
with one last thing before I go.

00:19:22.973 --> 00:19:26.526
Of all the people I've worked with,
they will all tell you the same thing:

00:19:26.526 --> 00:19:30.132
One, they became extremists

00:19:30.136 --> 00:19:34.110
because they wanted to belong,
not because of ideology or dogma;

00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:37.473
and second, what brought them out

00:19:38.348 --> 00:19:40.290
was receiving compassion

00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:42.817
from the people
they least deserved it from,

00:19:43.305 --> 00:19:45.018
when they least deserved it.

00:19:45.018 --> 00:19:47.119
(Applause)

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:49.797
And they were the people
they least deserved it from.

00:19:50.093 --> 00:19:52.260
So I would like
to leave you with a challenge:

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.965
go out there today, tomorrow -
hopefully every day -

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.468
find somebody that you think
is undeserving of your compassion

00:20:01.916 --> 00:20:03.174
and give it to them.

00:20:03.762 --> 00:20:05.071
Because I guarantee you,

00:20:05.071 --> 00:20:07.465
they're the ones who need it the most.

00:20:07.465 --> 00:20:08.784
Thank you very much.

00:20:08.784 --> 00:20:10.777
(Applause)

00:20:12.237 --> 00:20:14.441
(Cheering)
