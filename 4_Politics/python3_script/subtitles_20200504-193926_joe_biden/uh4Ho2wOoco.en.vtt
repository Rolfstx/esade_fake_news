00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.403
With James Comey set
to testify tomorrow,

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.772
it is clear
that President Trump is having

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.741
a sad-exclamation point week.

00:00:08.774 --> 00:00:11.878
And now, on top of all of that,
his third favorite son, Eric,

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:14.147
is in hot water of his own.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.115 line:0%
NEWSMAN:<i> Late Tuesday,
 the president's son Eric</i>

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:19.185 line:0%
<i>lashing out at those who oppose
 his father's administration.</i>

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:21.654 line:0%
So with the destroy Trump media
floating baseless

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:24.557 line:0%
Russia conspiracy theories
every second of every day,

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.759 line:0%
and of course,
Democrats on Capitol Hill

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.896 line:0%
desperately searching for any
evidence of collusion,

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.831 line:0%
well, President Trump's sons,

00:00:31.864 --> 00:00:33.433 line:0%
they are now coming
to his defense.

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.967 line:0%
Joining us now,
the man himself,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.303 line:0%
executive vice president
of the Trump Organization.

00:00:37.336 --> 00:00:38.838 line:0%
I've never seen hatred
like this.

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:40.473 line:0%
I mean, to me they're not
even people.

00:00:40.506 --> 00:00:41.908 line:0%
It's-it's so, so sad.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.410 line:0%
I mean, morality's just gone.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.212 line:0%
Um, morals have flown out
the window.

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:50.049
Wow. Wow.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:53.953
The same guy, the same guy
who got so upset

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:56.756
when Hillary called his dad's
supporters "deplorables,"

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.725
is now saying that Democrats
aren't even human beings?

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:02.328
Really? And he didn't even warm
up to it in the interview.

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:04.430
It was practically the first
thing out of his mouth.

00:01:04.463 --> 00:01:07.266
I can only imagine what it's
like on a first date with Eric.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:09.435
(mimics Eric):
"Hey, great to meet you, Ashlee.

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:11.871
Do you do anal?”

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.840
(laughter)

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:19.178
(normal voice):
I-I don't know about you,

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:22.748
but whenever I see this sort
of thing, it makes me wonder:

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:25.518
how did this person
get this way?

00:01:25.551 --> 00:01:28.121
And then yesterday,
a story came out

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:30.590
that sort of helped me
understand a bit.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:33.392
<i> Forbes Magazine</i> published
an article exposing

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.395
where some of the money that
Eric Trump raised for charity

00:01:36.428 --> 00:01:38.431
was actually going.

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:41.234 line:0%
Now to that blockbuster new
report raising serious questions

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:44.103 line:0%
about the Trump Organization
and charity golf events

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:46.639 line:0%
<i> that were meant to raise money
 for children with cancer.</i>

00:01:46.672 --> 00:01:48.241 line:0%
TV REPORTER: 
 Forbes Magazine<i> reports</i>

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.210 line:0%
<i> hundreds of thousands of
 dollars in charity expenses</i>

00:01:51.243 --> 00:01:54.747 line:0%
<i> went to the Trump family
 business, despite Eric saying</i>

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.316 line:0%
<i> many of the costs would be
 covered by the Trumps.</i>

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.419 line:0%
You have money that starts as
other people's donations,

00:02:00.452 --> 00:02:02.722 line:0%
where they think that they're
giving to charity,

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:06.292 line:0%
and it appears to end up as
revenue at a Trump club.

00:02:06.325 --> 00:02:08.261
Wow.

00:02:08.294 --> 00:02:10.830
Taking money that was meant

00:02:10.863 --> 00:02:13.166
for kids suffering from cancer

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:15.134
to line your own pockets.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:18.404
That is--
I mean, that is just...

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:19.839
So, so sad.

00:02:19.872 --> 00:02:22.074
I mean, morality's just gone.

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:24.844
Morals have flown out
the window.

00:02:24.877 --> 00:02:27.446
My man.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:30.316
(laughter and applause)

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.619
So, so when I first read
this story, I thought, wow.

00:02:33.652 --> 00:02:35.555
This guy's such a dirt bag.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:37.857
But that's not entirely fair,
honestly.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.126
Because Eric Trump did raise
millions of dollars

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.395
for the St. Jude
Children's Hospital.

00:02:42.428 --> 00:02:45.831
In fact, they even put his name
on a hospital wing, right.

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:48.901
I mean, not a picture,
just his name, all right?

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:51.337
Those poor kids have been
through enough.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.239
But still, they like him.

00:02:53.272 --> 00:02:55.274
And this brings us to how Eric

00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:57.076
went from using
his incredible privilege

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:58.878
to help the less fortunate,

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:01.280
to being the guy
skimming from charities.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:04.417
And it turns out he fell in
with a bad crowd.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.052 line:0%
TV REPORTER: Forbes<i> says
 problems started</i>

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:08.921 line:0%
<i> with the charity when Donald
 Trump allegedly demanded</i>

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:11.924 line:0%
<i> the foundation be charged
 for using the facilities.</i>

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:14.594 line:0%
Donald came in and said,
"You know what?

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.362 line:0%
"We're going to start billing
you guys.

00:03:16.395 --> 00:03:18.197 line:0%
"Even though
it's a charity event,

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.099 line:0%
"even though this is
for kids for cancer,

00:03:20.132 --> 00:03:21.867 line:0%
we want you guys to pay.”

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.504
"Even though this is
for kids with cancer,

00:03:25.537 --> 00:03:27.773
we want you guys to pay.”

00:03:27.806 --> 00:03:29.342
That is heartless,

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:32.545
and also the theme of Trump's
new health care plan.

00:03:32.578 --> 00:03:35.047
Oh, and if that wasn't
bad enough,

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.216
Daddy Trump also starting--

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:40.152
he started charging his son's
charity 500% more

00:03:40.185 --> 00:03:42.121
than a venue
would usually charge.

00:03:42.154 --> 00:03:43.789
That's what he also did, yeah.

00:03:43.822 --> 00:03:46.158
So, I guess, at the end of the
day we're starting to understand

00:03:46.191 --> 00:03:48.761
that this is the curse of being
one of Donald Trump's children.

00:03:48.794 --> 00:03:51.430
You can try and be good,
but he'll be like,

00:03:51.463 --> 00:03:52.965
(mimics Trump):
"No, no, no, don't do that.

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:55.101
You're a Trump."

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:57.069
(normal voice);
And now, Eric might as well

00:03:57.102 --> 00:03:59.005
be one of Trump's buildings.

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.774
He's not as popular as he
once was, and if you look deep,

00:04:01.807 --> 00:04:03.576
you'll find that he's also empty
on the inside.
