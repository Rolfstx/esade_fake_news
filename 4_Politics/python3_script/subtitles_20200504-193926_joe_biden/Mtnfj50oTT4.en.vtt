President Barack Obama.

00:11:12.805 --> 00:11:15.441
President Barack Obama
distinguished himself as the

00:11:15.441 --> 00:11:18.077
Commander-In-Chief of the
finest fighting force the

00:11:18.077 --> 00:11:22.048
world has every known from
January 20, 2009 to

00:11:22.048 --> 00:11:24.784
January 20, 2017.

00:11:24.784 --> 00:11:28.020
President Obama kept our
nation safe, led a strategic

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.157
transition in our defense
strategy, strengthened our

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:34.393
alliances and pursued new
partnerships, and laid the

00:11:34.393 --> 00:11:36.729
foundation for a force
of the future that will

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:39.498
continue to win
our nation's wars.

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:42.134
President Obama countered
decisively the immediate

00:11:42.134 --> 00:11:45.504
threat to our national
security -- terrorism.

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:48.574
He directed the operation
to kill Osama Bin Laden,

00:11:48.574 --> 00:11:51.243
decimated Al Qaeda's
terrorist network, put the

00:11:51.243 --> 00:11:53.946
Islamic state of Iraq and
Levant on a path to a

00:11:53.946 --> 00:11:56.615
lasting defeat, and
developed counterterrorism

00:11:56.615 --> 00:11:59.919
platforms from South
Asia to North Africa.

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:03.522
He did so relentlessly,
effectively, with increased

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:07.159
transparency, and in strict
accordance with our values.

00:12:07.159 --> 00:12:10.329
Simultaneously, President
Obama achieved verifiable

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:13.365
nuclear disarmament to
Iran, the gravest threat to

00:12:13.365 --> 00:12:15.835
security in the Middle East.

00:12:15.835 --> 00:12:18.137
And while countering
proliferation abroad, he

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:20.973
directed recapitalization
of our vitally important

00:12:20.973 --> 00:12:23.576
nuclear deterrent
here at home.

00:12:23.576 --> 00:12:25.411
As he successfully
neutralized immediate

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:28.314
threats to our security,
President Obama also

00:12:28.314 --> 00:12:31.484
directed a transition
in our defense strategy.

00:12:31.484 --> 00:12:34.487
He implemented a rigorous
intellectual policy and

00:12:34.487 --> 00:12:37.556
legal framework to guide the
most solemn decision that a

00:12:37.556 --> 00:12:41.360
commander-in-chief makes --
to deploy and employ our men

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.762
and women in uniform.

00:12:43.762 --> 00:12:46.265
He supported strategic
investments to perpetuate

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:50.035
our military edge in the
air, at sea, with missile

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:53.739
defenses, and in space and
cyber domains including by

00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:56.775
establishing the United
States Cyber Command.

00:12:56.775 --> 00:12:59.545
In so doing, he led the
transformation of the United

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:02.915
States military from over a
decade of counterinsurgency

00:13:02.915 --> 00:13:05.384
into a full spectrum
fighting force.

00:13:05.384 --> 00:13:08.220
And critically, he directed
the United States rebalance

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:11.223
to the Asia-Pacific, the
most consequential region

00:13:11.223 --> 00:13:13.092
for America's future.

00:13:13.092 --> 00:13:15.628
President Obama also
recognized that security in

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.296
the world cannot be
America's

00:13:17.296 --> 00:13:19.498
responsibility alone.

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:21.734
He strengthened our
alliances and pursued

00:13:21.734 --> 00:13:23.302
new partnerships.

00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:25.704
In Europe, he led the
adaptation of NATO to

00:13:25.704 --> 00:13:29.074
continue its commitment to
a stable Afghanistan and to

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:32.811
actively counter threats to
Europe's east and south.

00:13:32.811 --> 00:13:34.914
In particular, President
Obama directed the

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:38.017
bolstering of our Allied
Military Presence in Europe

00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:40.119
and reestablishing of
deterrents against

00:13:40.119 --> 00:13:41.687
Russian aggression.

00:13:41.687 --> 00:13:44.757
In Asia, he modernized our
alliances with Japan and

00:13:44.757 --> 00:13:47.826
Korea strengthening the
cornerstone of security in

00:13:47.826 --> 00:13:51.463
East Asia, and deterring
threats from North Korea.

00:13:51.463 --> 00:13:53.332
In the Middle East, he
strengthened Israel's

00:13:53.332 --> 00:13:56.135
qualitative military
edge including with an

00:13:56.135 --> 00:13:59.238
unprecedented package of
foreign military funding.

00:13:59.238 --> 00:14:01.807
But in an ever-changing
world, President Obama

00:14:01.807 --> 00:14:05.744
recognized that America's
relationships must also change.

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:09.615
He directed the advancement
of new strategic (inaudible)

00:14:09.615 --> 00:14:11.684
including the unprecedented
deepening of the

00:14:11.684 --> 00:14:16.088
strategically consequential
United States-India partnership.

00:14:16.088 --> 00:14:18.791
In all of this, President
Obama recognized that the

00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:21.493
source of America's greatest
strength, including its

00:14:21.493 --> 00:14:24.129
military strength,
is its people.

00:14:24.129 --> 00:14:26.298
To ensure that the United
States military stays the

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:29.835
best, he understood that we
must continue to attract,

00:14:29.835 --> 00:14:33.239
recruit, retain, develop,
and transition the best

00:14:33.239 --> 00:14:35.975
talent that our
nation has to offer.

00:14:35.975 --> 00:14:38.611
His repealing of the Don't
Ask, Don't Tell Policy, and

00:14:38.611 --> 00:14:41.513
the support for opening all
military occupations and

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:44.683
positions to women
will help ensure that.

00:14:44.683 --> 00:14:47.753
He also championed advanced
research and an innovative

00:14:47.753 --> 00:14:50.789
program to care for our
nation's wounded warriors

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:53.592
and their families and led
efforts to help veterans

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:56.161
make the transition
to civilian life.

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:58.230
These and many other
distinctive accomplishments

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:01.500
of President Obama reflect
great credit upon himself,

00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.003
the Department of Defense,
and the United

00:15:04.003 --> 00:15:05.504
States of America.

00:15:05.504 --> 00:15:10.209
(applause)

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:08.834
Ladies and gentlemen, please
stand for the posting

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:11.470

00:16:13.138 --> 00:16:16.608
Male Speaker: Post the
colors -- down, right, face.

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:30.956

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:30.649
Male Speaker: Ladies and
gentlemen, please be seated.

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.989
(inaudible dialogue)

00:18:10.322 --> 00:18:17.663
Male Speaker: Ladies and
gentlemen, General Dunford.

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.711
General Dunford:
Mr. President, Vice

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:36.281
President Biden, Secretary
Carter, distinguished guests

00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:39.318
-- thank you once again for
joining us as we pay tribute

00:18:39.318 --> 00:18:42.654
to our Commander-In-Chief
and the Obama family.

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:44.823
Mr. President, I had the
distinct honor today of

00:18:44.823 --> 00:18:49.127
representing your soldiers,
sailors, airmen, Marines,

00:18:49.127 --> 00:18:50.028
and Coastguardsmen.

00:18:50.028 --> 00:18:52.431
And as you know better than
most, those men and women

00:18:52.431 --> 00:18:53.465
are busy,.

00:18:53.465 --> 00:18:55.868
Thousands are deployed
across the globe.

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:57.970
They're meeting our alliance
commitments and deterring

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.805
potential adversaries.

00:18:59.805 --> 00:19:02.708
They're taking the fight to
the Islamic State, Al Qaeda,

00:19:02.708 --> 00:19:05.143
and other extremist
organizations.

00:19:05.143 --> 00:19:07.713
They're maintaining freedom
of navigation and they're

00:19:07.713 --> 00:19:11.817
defending us from threats
in space and cyber space.

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:14.119
Throughout your time in
office, we've often heard

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:16.622
you express your
appreciation for their

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:19.191
service and their sacrifice.

00:19:19.191 --> 00:19:21.560
But this afternoon, Mr.
President, I want to

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.763
express our appreciation for
your leadership and honor

00:19:24.763 --> 00:19:27.466
your service as our
Commander-In-Chief for the

00:19:27.466 --> 00:19:29.301
past eight years.

00:19:29.301 --> 00:19:31.370
Mr. President, we've been at
war throughout your tenure,

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:33.805
that's a period longer
than any other

00:19:33.805 --> 00:19:35.207
American President.

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:38.577
And throughout those years,
you've always been there for us.

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:40.312
You were there in a
situation room where I

00:19:40.312 --> 00:19:42.881
personally witnessed your
thoughtful and careful

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:46.318
deliberations when ordering
our young men and women in

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:47.619
harm's way.

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:49.955
You were there visiting
the force wherever it was

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:52.658
deployed, ensuring that
our men and women had the

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:56.562
guidance and support
necessary to get the job done.

00:19:56.562 --> 00:19:58.196
You were there in the
holidays meeting with the

00:19:58.196 --> 00:20:00.799
troops and calling them
around the world to simply

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.267
say thanks.

00:20:02.267 --> 00:20:04.269
You were there when our
wounded warriors return home

00:20:04.269 --> 00:20:05.270
to heal.

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:08.040
Your constant visits to
Walter Reed were without

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.710
fanfare of ceremony, but
always marked with heartfelt

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.846
words, hugs from moms, and
more often than not, a few

00:20:14.846 --> 00:20:18.183
lunges and pushups alongside
those who were trying to

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:20.018
recover.

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:22.721
Finally, Mr. President, you
were there at Dover Air

00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:26.291
Force Base to receive the
remains of the fallen and

00:20:26.291 --> 00:20:29.294
you were there to visit
them at Arlington.

00:20:29.294 --> 00:20:31.930
I could go on, but let me
share a few sentiments from

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.334
the men and women that you
have touched as a leader.

00:20:35.334 --> 00:20:37.569
Lieutenant Colonel Will
Phillips sent this message.

00:20:37.569 --> 00:20:40.739
"Mr. President and First Lady, thank you both for your

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:43.308
tireless dedication to our nation.

00:20:43.308 --> 00:20:45.844
President Obama, you've set
an example for us all as a

00:20:45.844 --> 00:20:49.681
statesman, a father,
and a husband."

00:20:49.681 --> 00:20:52.618
Corporal David Dennis, who's
currently deployed to Iraq

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:54.419
told me how much he
appreciated your call on

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:58.190
Christmas Day to say thanks
for his sacrifice and service.

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.459
Sergeant Major Troxell and
I, by coincidence, met with

00:21:00.459 --> 00:21:03.428
him a few hours after your
call and he was still pretty

00:21:03.428 --> 00:21:05.364
pumped up after that call.

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:07.566
I was a bit disappointed
because after your phone

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:09.735
call that morning, a visit
from the Chairman of the

00:21:09.735 --> 00:21:12.304
Joint Chiefs and his senior
enlisted leader actually

00:21:12.304 --> 00:21:13.405
didn't carry much weight.

00:21:13.405 --> 00:21:15.273
(laughter)

00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:18.143
Major Matt Lampart made the
following comment about your

00:21:18.143 --> 00:21:21.513
hospital visit, "When I met
the President, I was just

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:23.682
regaining the
ability to walk.

00:21:23.682 --> 00:21:26.418
I had some days that were
tough and some days of

00:21:26.418 --> 00:21:29.421
doubt, but shaking hands
with President Obama and

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:31.723
having a conversation with
him was something that will

00:21:31.723 --> 00:21:33.725
stick with me forever.

00:21:33.725 --> 00:21:36.595
Given the responsibilities
that he shoulders, President

00:21:36.595 --> 00:21:39.431
Obama's thoughtfulness and
common touch were

00:21:39.431 --> 00:21:41.333
pretty inspiring."

00:21:41.333 --> 00:21:44.036
Master Sergeant Keith Norris
described what your support

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:47.706
for educational benefits as
a senator and as a President

00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:51.543
has meant to his family, "If
it wasn't for the Post-911

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:54.746
GI Bill, my wife and I could
not have afforded to send

00:21:54.746 --> 00:21:56.515
our children to college.

00:21:56.515 --> 00:21:59.017
My oldest son just graduated
and I'm excited that he's on

00:21:59.017 --> 00:22:02.487
track to be commissioned in
the United States Air Force.

00:22:02.487 --> 00:22:04.656
While I wish he was going
in the Army -- you may have

00:22:04.656 --> 00:22:07.059
figured out that he's a
Master Sergeant in the Army

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:09.127
-- while I wish he was going
in the Army, I'm incredibly

00:22:09.127 --> 00:22:12.964
proud that he'll be the
first military officer in my

00:22:12.964 --> 00:22:14.966
family's history."

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:16.935
Chief Warrant Officer Nate
Powell commented on the

00:22:16.935 --> 00:22:21.073
impact of your support to
military spouses, "Like most

00:22:21.073 --> 00:22:23.508
public school teachers, my
wife doesn't earn all that

00:22:23.508 --> 00:22:26.478
much, but she loves
being a teacher.

00:22:26.478 --> 00:22:29.514
Because of the Military
Spouses Residency Relief Act

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:32.884
that President Obama signed
into law, my family saves

00:22:32.884 --> 00:22:36.154
thousands of dollars a year
that we'd otherwise have to

00:22:36.154 --> 00:22:38.990
pay just because she has
chosen to move with me

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:43.228
across state lines from duty
station to duty station."

00:22:43.228 --> 00:22:45.664
And on the lighter side,
Captain Alex Lowe, who's an

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:49.568
Air Force Flight Surgeon is
also apparently a big fan.

00:22:49.568 --> 00:22:51.503
He said, "I'm glad to have
started my service under

00:22:51.503 --> 00:22:55.373
such a charismatic and cool
Commander-In-Chief who can

00:22:55.373 --> 00:22:57.509
also play ball and
sing a mean Al Greene."

00:22:57.509 --> 00:22:59.711
(laughter)

00:22:59.711 --> 00:23:01.747
I can't witness
that, Mr. President.

00:23:01.747 --> 00:23:03.915
I've not had the opportunity
to see that in the situation

00:23:03.915 --> 00:23:06.418
room, but I'm going to take
Captain Lowe's -- Captain

00:23:06.418 --> 00:23:08.053
Lowe's word for it.

00:23:08.053 --> 00:23:11.189
Mr. President, on behalf of
Lieutenant Colonel Phillips,

00:23:11.189 --> 00:23:14.793
Corporal Dennis, Major
Lampart, Master Sergeant

00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:17.662
Norris, Chief Warrant
Officer Powell, Doc Lowe,

00:23:17.662 --> 00:23:20.966
and all of our men and women
in uniform, we recognize and

00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:24.236
appreciate your service,
your sacrifice, your

00:23:24.236 --> 00:23:27.606
commitment to the force,
and your leadership.

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:30.675
Of course, just as military
families serve, so has the

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.010
Obama Family.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:35.247
While unable to join us this
afternoon, Mrs. Obama and

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:38.650
Mrs. Biden's creation of
joining forces has made a

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:40.085
lasting impact.

00:23:40.085 --> 00:23:43.155
In significantly expanded
veteran job placement and

00:23:43.155 --> 00:23:44.556
educational opportunities.

00:23:44.556 --> 00:23:48.093
The First Lady's legal
advice and tireless advocacy

00:23:48.093 --> 00:23:51.997
has also benefitted military
working spouses making

00:23:51.997 --> 00:23:55.433
careers more transportable
for spouses who move every

00:23:55.433 --> 00:23:56.768
few years.

00:23:56.768 --> 00:23:59.004
In fact, the entire
Obama family has served.

00:23:59.004 --> 00:24:01.807
It'd be impossible to sum up
all their contributions

00:24:01.807 --> 00:24:02.941
this afternoon.

00:24:02.941 --> 00:24:05.977
So, in closing, I'll simply
say, Sasha and Malia, thank

00:24:05.977 --> 00:24:09.214
you for sharing your mom and
dad with us and the nation.

00:24:09.214 --> 00:24:11.583
Mrs. Obama, thank you for
improving the lives of our

00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.653
families and veterans and
thanks for representing our

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:16.955
nation with such class.

00:24:16.955 --> 00:24:18.723
And Mr. President,
thank you for being a

00:24:18.723 --> 00:24:21.493
Commander-In-Chief that we
have been proud to follow.

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:24.729
On a personal note, sir,
thanks for your confidence

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:26.832
in me and in all of the
senior leaders who have had

00:24:26.832 --> 00:24:30.101
the privilege to
serve on your watch.

00:24:30.101 --> 00:24:32.304
And now, ladies and
gentlemen, it's my privilege

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:34.005
to introduce another
individual who has made a

00:24:34.005 --> 00:24:37.642
lasting impact on our Joint
Force and someone we've been

00:24:37.642 --> 00:24:40.579
proud to follow, our
Secretary of Defense, the

00:24:40.579 --> 00:24:42.180
Honorable Ash Carter.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.849
(applause)

00:25:04.035 --> 00:25:05.804
Ash Carter: Thank you,
Chairman Dunford, for that

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:09.841
tribute to the President and
the First Lady's commitments

00:25:09.841 --> 00:25:12.477
to our troops
and our families.

00:25:12.477 --> 00:25:15.547
Mr. President, Mr. Vice
President, Department of

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:18.950
Defense leadership,
distinguished guests, ladies

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:20.852
and gentlemen -- welcome.

00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:26.892
As the Department honors our
Commander-in-Chief of eight

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:32.030
critical years for
one final time.

00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:34.499
This afternoon I'd like to
do so by speaking to those

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:37.602
aspects of his service and
commitment to our national

00:25:37.602 --> 00:25:41.506
defense that have been so
striking and that will be

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:43.541
so memorable.

00:25:43.541 --> 00:25:46.912
Each one, a constant
throughout his tenure as

00:25:46.912 --> 00:25:48.647
our President.

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:52.183
His focused strategic
leadership, his steps to

00:25:52.183 --> 00:25:54.953
strengthen our force both
in its people and in its

00:25:54.953 --> 00:25:59.624
capabilities, and
his decision making.

00:25:59.624 --> 00:26:02.560
Through it all, President
Obama has led our military

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.664
with an appreciation that
America's defense is so

00:26:05.664 --> 00:26:10.268
vital that we, to whom it is
entrusted, must ensure its

00:26:10.268 --> 00:26:14.172
continuity and excellence
across the years and across

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:15.874
the domains of
armed conflict.

00:26:15.874 --> 00:26:19.911
Not just air, land, and sea,
but also space and cyber

00:26:19.911 --> 00:26:25.850
space -- across parties,
across government agencies,

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:29.020
from strategic era to
strategic era, and from

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:33.058
Presidential administration
to Presidential administration.

00:26:33.058 --> 00:26:35.894
And he's done so not only
for the last eight years,

00:26:35.894 --> 00:26:39.764
but even today as we prepare
for new administration we're

00:26:39.764 --> 00:26:42.600
following the President's
leadership and ensuring a

00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.769
smooth and orderly
transition.

00:26:47.138 --> 00:26:49.808
Our military is a global
force, one that President

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:53.678
Obama has steadfastly and
strategically led in every

00:26:53.678 --> 00:26:56.114
region of the world to
ensure the men and women of

00:26:56.114 --> 00:26:59.451
the strongest and most
principled fighting force in

00:26:59.451 --> 00:27:03.455
history effectively defend
our country, deter our

00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:07.425
adversaries, bolster our
alliances and partnerships,

00:27:07.425 --> 00:27:10.595
and make a better
world for our children.

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:12.998
In the Asia Pacific,
President Obama has

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:16.334
sustained a comprehensive
rebalance of military power

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:19.838
to that region, the single
most consequential one for

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:21.806
America's future.

00:27:21.806 --> 00:27:24.476
There, we're repositioning
60 percent of our naval

00:27:24.476 --> 00:27:27.345
forces and overseas air
assets including some of our

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:31.049
most advanced systems, and
we're strengthening and

00:27:31.049 --> 00:27:35.253
modernizing key alliances
and partnerships with Japan,

00:27:35.253 --> 00:27:40.625
with South Korea, India,
Vietnam, Australia, many others.

00:27:40.625 --> 00:27:45.230
In Europe, following
Russia's illegal annexation

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:49.167
of Crimea, and use of
hybrid warfare techniques,

00:27:49.167 --> 00:27:53.438
President Obama has stood
strong with our NATO allies

00:27:53.438 --> 00:27:57.475
and led a united response to
deter Russian aggression,

00:27:57.475 --> 00:28:00.211
enhancing U.S. force presence and implementing a

00:28:00.211 --> 00:28:04.616
new playbook so NATO can adapt against 21st Century threats.

00:28:04.616 --> 00:28:08.987
In the Middle East,
President Obama secured an

00:28:08.987 --> 00:28:11.790
accord that's verifiably
preventing Iran from

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:15.126
acquiring a nuclear weapon
removing a key source of

00:28:15.126 --> 00:28:18.196
danger in the region.

00:28:18.196 --> 00:28:20.432
But as we continue to
counter Iran's other

00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:23.668
destabilizing activities,
he's also strengthened the

00:28:23.668 --> 00:28:26.604
defense relationships
with all our key

00:28:26.604 --> 00:28:28.440
regional partners.

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.743
For example, providing
our allies, Israel,

00:28:31.743 --> 00:28:34.546
unprecedented security
assistance and advanced

00:28:34.546 --> 00:28:36.514
capabilities across domains.

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.919
And around the world, in the
face of terrorist threats

00:28:40.919 --> 00:28:46.057
from Al Qaeda to Al Shabbab
to ISIL, President Obama has

00:28:46.057 --> 00:28:49.027
led the most robust and
sustained counterterrorism

00:28:49.027 --> 00:28:52.097
fight in American history.

00:28:52.097 --> 00:28:54.399
In the counter ISIL
campaign, the President

00:28:54.399 --> 00:28:58.736
consistently supported the
development and acceleration

00:28:58.736 --> 00:29:02.974
of the coalition military
campaign plan focused on

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:08.146
destroying the fact and the
idea of an Islamic state

00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:13.084
based on this evil ideology
in Iraq and Syria,

00:29:13.084 --> 00:29:16.387
countering the ISIL cancer's
metastases everywhere they

00:29:16.387 --> 00:29:20.658
emerge, and most important
-- protecting our homeland

00:29:20.658 --> 00:29:22.760
and our people.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.063
In addition to countering
ISIL, he's taken action to

00:29:25.063 --> 00:29:27.999
ensure Afghanistan does not
become a safe haven for

00:29:27.999 --> 00:29:30.935
terrorist threat in America.

00:29:30.935 --> 00:29:34.606
He's directed eight years of
unrelenting strikes on Al

00:29:34.606 --> 00:29:38.743
Qaeda to devastate that
terrorist organization both

00:29:38.743 --> 00:29:42.981
before and after bringing
Osama Bin Laden to justice.

00:29:42.981 --> 00:29:44.983
He's built a
counterterrorism apparatus

00:29:44.983 --> 00:29:49.621
that has thwarted countless
lots against our homeland.

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:53.191
And he did all of this --
all of it, consistent with

00:29:53.191 --> 00:29:54.926
our values.

00:29:54.926 --> 00:29:57.962
Because our President knows
as he's put it, "That we

00:29:57.962 --> 00:30:01.299
lose ourselves when we
compromise the very ideals

00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:04.636
we fight to defend."

00:30:04.636 --> 00:30:07.572
At the same time, President
Obama made sure our military

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:11.242
stayed strong and grew
stronger in our people and

00:30:11.242 --> 00:30:14.279
our capabilities to meet
those ambitious, but

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:16.881
necessary commitments.

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:20.185
Indeed, our President knows
very well that the single

00:30:20.185 --> 00:30:23.221
factor above all others
that makes the U.S.

00:30:23.221 --> 00:30:27.625
military the finest is its
people -- some represented

00:30:27.625 --> 00:30:33.064
here today, far more
around the world.

00:30:33.064 --> 00:30:35.533
President Obama has been
dedicated to improving the

00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:38.002
quality of life of our force
making sure our service

00:30:38.002 --> 00:30:41.239
members get what they need
not only when it comes to

00:30:41.239 --> 00:30:43.608
training and equipment, but
also important benefits

00:30:43.608 --> 00:30:47.712
critical to recruitment and
retention like maternity and

00:30:47.712 --> 00:30:49.280
paternity leave.

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.016
He's helped keep sacred
the commitment to wounded

00:30:52.016 --> 00:30:55.720
warriors, the families of
the fallen, to military

00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:59.023
families, and to veterans.

00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:01.526
He's made sure our people
are treated with the dignity

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:05.396
and honor befitting the
profession of arms from

00:31:05.396 --> 00:31:08.032
supporting DOD's efforts
to rid our ranks of sexual

00:31:08.032 --> 00:31:12.971
assault to improving our
suicide prevention efforts.

00:31:12.971 --> 00:31:15.707
He's helped ensure the
long-term viability of what

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:19.277
is, after all, an
all-volunteer force

00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:22.347
recruited in comparatively
small numbers from the

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:26.284
entire American population,
recognizing we have to

00:31:26.284 --> 00:31:30.221
compete for top talent and
that to have the best, we

00:31:30.221 --> 00:31:34.025
must select the best solely
on their qualifications to

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:39.364
meet our high standards --
not race, gender, identity,

00:31:39.364 --> 00:31:43.368
or sexual orientation --
rather focusing only on

00:31:43.368 --> 00:31:45.570
whether someone can
meet our standards.

00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:50.141
And he's also supported
veterans on their transition

00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:52.477
to whatever's next for them
in life whether it's earning

00:31:52.477 --> 00:31:56.981
a degree, finding a job,
or starting a business.

00:31:56.981 --> 00:31:58.983
I know how much that
matters, because I'm old

00:31:58.983 --> 00:32:01.786
enough to remember a
shameful time when our

00:32:01.786 --> 00:32:03.788
veterans were treated
very differently.

00:32:05.857 --> 00:32:08.926
After our people, it's
America's capabilities that

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:12.030
make our military
edge second to none.

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:15.266
And President Obama has
sharpened that as well.

00:32:15.266 --> 00:32:19.137
He always asks, "Are we
looking around the corner?"

00:32:19.137 --> 00:32:21.172
To ensure we not only
anticipate the changing

00:32:21.172 --> 00:32:24.075
nature of warfare and future
threats, but also stay ahead

00:32:24.075 --> 00:32:27.745
of them and take full
advantage of new technology.

00:32:27.745 --> 00:32:30.682
Under his leadership, DOD
began returning to full

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:33.718
spectrum capability in the
Army and Marine Corps after

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:38.456
many years of skillful, but
all absorbing focus on large

00:32:38.456 --> 00:32:43.027
counterinsurgency
deployments.

00:32:43.027 --> 00:32:46.698
We grew the size and the
lethality of our navy and

00:32:46.698 --> 00:32:48.533
drove forward the
development and production

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:52.270
of new fighters, bombers,
and tankers for the Air Force.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:54.706
We increased funding for
innovative technologies in

00:32:54.706 --> 00:32:58.576
R&amp;D, notably in critical
domains like space, cyber,

00:32:58.576 --> 00:33:00.445
and electronic warfare.

00:33:00.445 --> 00:33:03.881
All this, amidst persistent
budget turbulence

00:33:03.881 --> 00:33:06.184
and uncertainty.

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:08.519
And even as President Obama
has worked towards a world

00:33:08.519 --> 00:33:11.589
without nuclear weapons,
he's also ensured the United

00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:16.394
States maintains a safe,
secure, and effective

00:33:16.394 --> 00:33:19.330
nuclear deterrent for as
long as these weapons exist.

00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.837
And finally -- finally, from
the vantage of someone who's

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:30.007
worked for 11 defense
secretaries over 35 years,

00:33:30.007 --> 00:33:33.444
under both Democratic and
Republican presidents -- and

00:33:33.444 --> 00:33:36.681
now being secretary myself,
I want to offer some

00:33:36.681 --> 00:33:40.685
perspective on the nature
and the quality of President

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:43.354
Obama's leadership and
decision making as our

00:33:43.354 --> 00:33:45.857
Commander-In-Chief.

00:33:45.857 --> 00:33:48.226
Because it's often most
appreciated by those who've

00:33:48.226 --> 00:33:51.195
had to sign deployment
orders, who've been to

00:33:51.195 --> 00:33:54.132
Dover, to Bethesda, Walter
Reed -- who know that the

00:33:54.132 --> 00:33:58.369
decisions he makes
have consequences.

00:33:58.369 --> 00:34:01.639
Most Americans don't get
to see how President Obama

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:04.976
makes decisions about our
national security, so let me

00:34:04.976 --> 00:34:07.044
give you a window to what
it's like when we meet in

00:34:07.044 --> 00:34:11.716
the situation room
or the Oval Office.

00:34:11.716 --> 00:34:15.987
To begin with, he's steady,
deliberate, rigorous, and

00:34:15.987 --> 00:34:20.124
demanding of
himself and of us.

00:34:20.124 --> 00:34:23.294
Always reflecting the
seriousness -- seriousness

00:34:23.294 --> 00:34:26.063
with which he approaches the
grave responsibilities of

00:34:26.063 --> 00:34:27.865
the Presidency.

00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:29.967
He makes us think through
the consequences of our

00:34:29.967 --> 00:34:33.037
proposed course of action as
thoroughly as that

00:34:33.037 --> 00:34:34.939
can be foreseen.

00:34:34.939 --> 00:34:40.678
And he always focuses first
and fixedly on our north

00:34:40.678 --> 00:34:45.850
star -- America's
national interests.

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:49.454
I've been grateful that I've
always gotten a full hearing

00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:53.558
for my views and
recommendations.

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:55.960
And in my observation,
Chairman Dunford always did

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.562
as well.

00:34:57.562 --> 00:35:00.698
For President Obama valued
not only my strategic advice

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:04.368
and his other advisors, but
also candid, professional

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:05.770
military advice.

00:35:05.770 --> 00:35:09.907
And he was always willing to
what we had to say, even if

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:12.143
I knew it wasn't something
he wanted to hear.

00:35:14.645 --> 00:35:17.148
President Obama also knows
it's not only whether the

00:35:17.148 --> 00:35:21.719
decisions made are good that
matters, but also whether

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:23.955
they're implemented
with excellence.

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:27.125
And that's a management
style that's actually rare

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:31.162
among policymakers
in Washington.

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:33.798
Whether it was accelerating
the counter-ISOL campaign,

00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:36.868
stopping the spread of
Ebola, or rebalancing the

00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:40.104
Asia Pacific, President
Obama's always insisted on

00:35:40.104 --> 00:35:42.807
getting the job
done to the end.

00:35:42.807 --> 00:35:45.710
He never hesitates to ask
hard questions, and keep

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:48.479
asking until
there's an answer.

00:35:48.479 --> 00:35:50.915
That's not only because he
wanted his decision and met

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:53.184
our objectives achieved --
though both are important,

00:35:53.184 --> 00:35:56.354
but because he was committed
to making sure that all our

00:35:56.354 --> 00:36:00.057
soldiers, sailors, airmen,
marines, had what they

00:36:00.057 --> 00:36:02.059
needed to do their job.

00:36:04.128 --> 00:36:06.264
As you heard from Chairman
Dunford, that kind of

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:09.934
commitment means a
lot to our troops.

00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:12.937
I've seen that
up close as well.

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:15.439
Many times, I visited
service members on bases

00:36:15.439 --> 00:36:18.276
after the President has
stopped by, or wounded

00:36:18.276 --> 00:36:21.245
warriors and their families
at military hospitals after

00:36:21.245 --> 00:36:22.146
he's visited with them.

00:36:22.146 --> 00:36:25.249
And no matter how much time
was passed, whether he

00:36:25.249 --> 00:36:27.785
visited the week before, the
month before, or the year

00:36:27.785 --> 00:36:31.455
before, they remember the
genuineness of

00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.256
President Obama.

00:36:32.256 --> 00:36:37.461
They can feel as only young
troops can -- the unending

00:36:37.461 --> 00:36:39.964
concern he has for our men
and women in uniform and

00:36:39.964 --> 00:36:42.833
their families, and the
boundless care with which he

00:36:42.833 --> 00:36:47.338
makes decision that
put them in harm's way.

00:36:47.338 --> 00:36:49.540
Over the course of eight
years, President Obama's

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.043
level of dedication
and mastery of his

00:36:52.043 --> 00:36:54.979
responsibilities
has been remarkable.

00:36:54.979 --> 00:36:57.715
It's difficult for anyone to
imagine the toll of never

00:36:57.715 --> 00:37:01.852
being able to unplug from
their duties, and their

00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:05.089
stakes for that long.

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:08.025
All the while, being a
gracious and inspiring

00:37:08.025 --> 00:37:11.195
example, and all the while,
also helping to raise

00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:13.364
two daughters.

00:37:13.364 --> 00:37:17.902
It's impossible to imagine
a man caring more, although

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:19.904
possibly two sons.

00:37:22.707 --> 00:37:26.210
Mr. President, for this and
more, I've been proud to

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.879
serve as your
Secretary of Defense.

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:31.382
And from me and the entire
Defense Department, thank

00:37:31.382 --> 00:37:34.251
you, in full measure, for
your leadership, your

00:37:34.251 --> 00:37:37.488
support, and your devotion
to our country and its defense.

00:37:37.488 --> 00:37:39.590
May you begin to feel the
great weight shift from

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:40.725
your shoulders.

00:37:40.725 --> 00:37:44.462
May you feel the warm wind
of the nation's gratitude at

00:37:44.462 --> 00:37:46.464
your back.

00:37:46.464 --> 00:37:50.368
May God bless you and your
family, and may God continue

00:37:50.368 --> 00:37:52.203
to bless the United
States of America.

00:37:52.203 --> 00:37:53.938
(applause)

00:37:53.938 --> 00:37:57.575
Ladies and gentlemen,
President of the United

00:37:57.575 --> 00:37:58.609
States, Barack Obama.

00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:00.778
(applause)

00:38:20.898 --> 00:38:22.066
The President:
Thank you so much.

00:38:22.066 --> 00:38:24.468
Thank you.

00:38:24.468 --> 00:38:24.869
Thank you.

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:26.437
Please be seated.

00:38:26.437 --> 00:38:29.740
Well, good afternoon.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.676
Turns out, these are easier
when you're talking about

00:38:31.676 --> 00:38:33.678
somebody else.

00:38:36.213 --> 00:38:38.582
In moments like this, I
think of all the times that

00:38:38.582 --> 00:38:42.319
I stood before our men
and women in uniform.

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:49.627
Commissioning our newest
officers, presiding over

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:55.066
promotions, presenting the
Commander in Chief's trophy

00:38:55.066 --> 00:39:00.004
to the best football team in
the military -- I will let

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:03.874
you argue over that that;
I have never taken sides.

00:39:06.143 --> 00:39:10.748
Secretary Carter, I could
not be more grateful for

00:39:10.748 --> 00:39:14.218
your gracious words, but
more importantly, for your

00:39:14.218 --> 00:39:18.055
outstanding leadership
across, as you noted, more

00:39:18.055 --> 00:39:22.993
than three decades and
nearly all of my presidency.

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:26.564
You have always given me,
Ash, your strategic counsel.

00:39:26.564 --> 00:39:31.535
You've made sure that we
were investing in innovation

00:39:31.535 --> 00:39:37.141
for the long term, and a
strong force for the future.

00:39:37.141 --> 00:39:40.644
As a physicist, Ash is also
one of the few people who

00:39:40.644 --> 00:39:45.249
actually understands how our
dispense systems work, and I

00:39:45.249 --> 00:39:47.952
know that our troops and
their families are immensely

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:51.222
grateful for the compassion
that you and Stephanie shown

00:39:51.222 --> 00:39:52.590
them over the years.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:55.860
So, to you and your family,
on behalf of all of us,

00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.828
thank you for your
outstanding service.

00:39:57.828 --> 00:40:08.873
(applause)

00:40:08.873 --> 00:40:15.312
General Dunford, we relied
on you as commandant of the

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:18.682
Marine Corps, as our
commander in Afghanistan,

00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:21.352
and now, as our nation's
highest ranking

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:23.687
military officer.

00:40:23.687 --> 00:40:27.224
I thank you and General
Selva and the entire joined

00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:31.262
chiefs for the unvarnished
military advice that you

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:32.763
always provided to you.

00:40:32.763 --> 00:40:34.665
For your dedication.

00:40:34.665 --> 00:40:36.233
For your professionalism.

00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:39.203
For your integrity.

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:44.108
Because of you, because of
this team, our Armed Forces

00:40:44.108 --> 00:40:46.944
are more integrated and
better prepared across

00:40:46.944 --> 00:40:51.182
domains -- a
truly joint force.

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:54.585
Which is why, as a White Sox
fan, I can overlook the fact

00:40:54.585 --> 00:40:56.587
that you love the Red Sox.

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:04.061
Moreover, on a personal
note, outside of your

00:41:04.061 --> 00:41:08.566
professional qualities,
you are a good man.

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:11.869
And I am grateful to have
worked with you, and thank

00:41:11.869 --> 00:41:13.704
Ellyn for allowing
you to do this.

00:41:13.704 --> 00:41:26.684
(applause)

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:30.688
To members of Congress, Vice
President Biden, who, along

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:34.491
with Jill, has known the
love and the pride and the

00:41:34.491 --> 00:41:38.329
sacrifice of a
military family.

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:43.334
To Deputy Secretary Work,
service secretaries,

00:41:45.502 --> 00:41:49.106
distinguished guests,
dedicated civilians from

00:41:49.106 --> 00:41:53.143
across the Defense
Department, my national

00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:55.713
security team.

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:59.717
Most of all, our men
and women in uniform.

00:42:01.752 --> 00:42:05.756
I thank you for this honor,
and for the warmth and

00:42:05.756 --> 00:42:08.425
respect that you've
always shown me.

00:42:08.425 --> 00:42:10.294
The support that you've
shown Michelle and our

00:42:10.294 --> 00:42:12.329
daughters during these
past eight years.

00:42:12.329 --> 00:42:17.334
And so, although I recognize
that the formalities require

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:25.643
me listening to praise
directed, in large part to

00:42:25.643 --> 00:42:28.379
me, I want to
turn the tables.

00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:32.216
I am still Commander in
Chief, and so I get to do

00:42:32.216 --> 00:42:34.218
what I want to do, and
I want to thank you.

00:42:35.786 --> 00:42:38.022
Of all the privileges of
this office -- and there are

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:40.090
many, I will miss
Air Force One.

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:41.325
I will miss Marine One.

00:42:41.325 --> 00:42:42.893
(laughter)

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:45.829
But I can stand before you
today and say that there has

00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:48.899
been no greater privilege
and no greater honor than

00:42:48.899 --> 00:42:51.201
serving as the Commander
in Chief of the greatest

00:42:51.201 --> 00:42:52.603
military in the
history of the world.

00:42:52.603 --> 00:43:04.148
(applause)

00:43:04.148 --> 00:43:07.718
When I took office, I noted
that presidents -- and those

00:43:07.718 --> 00:43:12.723
of you in uniform, swear a
similar oath: to protect and

00:43:12.723 --> 00:43:18.062
defense this country, and
the Constitution that

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:19.797
we cherish.

00:43:19.797 --> 00:43:23.934
And by stepping forward and
volunteering, by raising

00:43:23.934 --> 00:43:28.806
your right hand and taking
that oath, each of you made

00:43:28.806 --> 00:43:30.774
a solemn pledge.

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:35.212
You committed yourself to
a life of service,

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:36.180
and of sacrifice.

00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:42.720
And I, in turn, made a
promise to you, which, to

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.556
the best of my abilities, I
tried to uphold every single

00:43:45.556 --> 00:43:49.293
day since -- that I would
only send you into harm's

00:43:49.293 --> 00:43:54.064
way when it was absolutely
necessary with the strategy

00:43:54.064 --> 00:43:57.768
and well-defined goals,
with the equipment and the

00:43:57.768 --> 00:44:00.070
support that you needed
to get the job done.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:03.574
Because that's what you
rightfully expect, and that

00:44:03.574 --> 00:44:07.745
is what you
rightfully deserve.

00:44:07.745 --> 00:44:10.514
I made that pledge at a time
when less than 1 percent of

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:13.851
Americans wear the uniform.

00:44:13.851 --> 00:44:16.220
Fewer Americans know
someone who serves.

00:44:18.355 --> 00:44:22.826
And as a result, a lot of
Americans don't see the

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:25.429
sacrifices you
make on our behalf.

00:44:27.631 --> 00:44:29.633
But as Commander
in Chief, I do.

00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:34.204
I've seen it, when I look in
the eyes of young cadets,

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:36.774
knowing that my decisions
could very well send them

00:44:36.774 --> 00:44:39.176
into harm's way.

00:44:39.176 --> 00:44:45.115
I've seen it when I visited
the field, in Bagram and

00:44:45.115 --> 00:44:50.888
Baghdad, far from your
families, risking your lives

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:56.794
so that we can live ours
safely, and in freedom.

00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:59.496
And so, you've inspired me,
and I've been humbled by

00:44:59.496 --> 00:45:00.164
you consistently.

00:45:00.164 --> 00:45:05.669
And I want every American
to know what I know.

00:45:05.669 --> 00:45:09.373
Through year after year
after year of continuous

00:45:09.373 --> 00:45:12.576
military operations, you
have earned your place among

00:45:12.576 --> 00:45:17.047
the greatest generations.

00:45:17.047 --> 00:45:21.819
The list of accomplishments
that Joe and Ash so

00:45:21.819 --> 00:45:27.624
generously mentioned --
they're because of you.

00:45:27.624 --> 00:45:29.259
It's what I tell my staff.

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:31.261
I'm the front man.

00:45:32.763 --> 00:45:34.765
But you're the ones
doing the work.

00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:39.603
Because of you, our
alliances are stronger --

00:45:39.603 --> 00:45:42.940
from Europe to
the Asia Pacific.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:46.977
Because of you, we surged
in Afghanistan -- trained

00:45:46.977 --> 00:45:50.914
Afghan forces to defend
their country, while

00:45:50.914 --> 00:45:54.118
bringing most of
our troops home.

00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:56.353
Today, our forces serve
there on a more limited

00:45:56.353 --> 00:45:59.389
mission because we
must never again allow

00:45:59.389 --> 00:46:04.595
Afghanistan to be used for
a safe haven in attacks

00:46:04.595 --> 00:46:06.597
against our nation.

00:46:07.998 --> 00:46:12.936
It's because of you,
particularly our remarkable

00:46:12.936 --> 00:46:16.874
Special Forces, that the
core Al-Qaeda leadership

00:46:16.874 --> 00:46:19.510
that attacked us on
9/11 has been decimated.

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:24.848
Countless terrorist leaders,
including Osama bin Laden,

00:46:24.848 --> 00:46:25.516
are gone.

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:31.555
From south Asia to Africa,
we have forged partnerships

00:46:31.555 --> 00:46:34.725
to go after terrorists
that threaten us.

00:46:34.725 --> 00:46:37.127
Because of you, we are
leading the global coalition

00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:38.228
against ISIL.

00:46:38.228 --> 00:46:40.731
These terrorists have
lost about half of

00:46:40.731 --> 00:46:41.798
their territory.

00:46:41.798 --> 00:46:43.333
They are losing
their leaders.

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:45.903
Towns and cities
are being liberated.

00:46:45.903 --> 00:46:49.206
And I have no doubt this
barbaric terrorist group

00:46:49.206 --> 00:46:51.775
will be destroyed
because of you.

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:57.948
You've shown that when it
comes to fighting terrorism,

00:46:57.948 --> 00:47:01.818
we can be strong and we can
be smart -- not by letting

00:47:01.818 --> 00:47:05.522
our forces get dragged into
sectarian conflicts and

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:09.092
civil wars, but with smart,
sustainable,

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:11.094
principle partnerships.

00:47:12.296 --> 00:47:14.431
That's how we brought most
of our troops home -- from

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:18.135
nearly 180,000 troops in
Iraq and Afghanistan, down

00:47:18.135 --> 00:47:21.004
to 15,000 today.

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:23.607
That's how, even as we've
suffered terrible attacks

00:47:23.607 --> 00:47:29.680
here at home, from Boston
to Orlando, no foreign

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.782
terrorist organization has
successfully planned and

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:39.823
executed an attack on our
homeland these past eight years.

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:45.095
Because of you, the world is
seeing the awesome reach of

00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:51.368
American Armed Forces.

00:47:53.036 --> 00:47:56.740
In some of the first few
weeks of my job, when Somali

00:47:56.740 --> 00:48:00.811
pirates took Captain
Phillips -- later on, when

00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:04.748
they kidnapped Jessica
Buchanan, it was you that

00:48:04.748 --> 00:48:09.453
went in, and you that risked
everything, and you that

00:48:09.453 --> 00:48:12.055
brought these Americans
home to their families.

00:48:14.524 --> 00:48:17.961
The world has seen your
compassion -- the help you

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:21.732
deliver in times of crisis,
from an earthquake in Haiti

00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:25.936
to the tsunami in Japan.

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:31.041
Think of Ebola, and the
countless lives this Armed

00:48:31.041 --> 00:48:35.646
Forces saved in West Africa.

00:48:37.814 --> 00:48:41.952
It was you that set up the
architecture, and set the

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:43.620
example for the
world's response.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:49.126
And one woman in West Africa
said, "We thanked God first,

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:52.496
and then we thanked America
second for caring about us."

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:57.034
That's the
difference you made.

00:48:58.068 --> 00:49:01.338
You continue to make, in the
lives of people around

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:03.340
the world.

00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:08.078
As you know, with service
comes great sacrifice.

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:11.715
And after 15 years of war,
our wounded warriors bear

00:49:11.715 --> 00:49:13.717
the scars, both
seen and unseen.

00:49:15.786 --> 00:49:19.056
In my visits to their
bedsides and rehab centers,

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:23.894
I have been in awe, watching
a wounded warrior grab his

00:49:23.894 --> 00:49:27.397
walker and pull himself up,
and through excruciating

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:31.401
step, take a step,
and then another.

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:33.503
Or hearing troops describe
how they grappled with

00:49:33.503 --> 00:49:36.707
post-traumatic stress, but
summon the strength to ask

00:49:36.707 --> 00:49:38.709
for help.

00:49:39.843 --> 00:49:43.013
As a military and as a
nation, we have to keep

00:49:43.013 --> 00:49:46.917
supporting our resilient and
incredibly strong wounded

00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:53.824
warriors as they learn to
run and walk and heal.

00:49:53.824 --> 00:49:57.227
As they find new ways to
keep serving our nation,

00:49:57.227 --> 00:50:00.597
they need to know that we
still need your

00:50:00.597 --> 00:50:02.099
incredible talents.

00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:05.502
You've given so much to
America, and I know you have

00:50:05.502 --> 00:50:07.504
more to give.

00:50:10.273 --> 00:50:14.077
And then, you have not seen
the depths of true love and

00:50:14.077 --> 00:50:16.980
true patriotism until
you've been to Dover.

00:50:20.417 --> 00:50:24.187
When our troops receive our
fallen heroes on their final

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:29.092
journey home.

00:50:29.092 --> 00:50:33.797
Until you have grieved with
our gold star families,

00:50:33.797 --> 00:50:35.999
who've given a piece of
their heart to their heart

00:50:35.999 --> 00:50:38.468
to our nation.

00:50:38.468 --> 00:50:39.903
A son or a daughter.

00:50:39.903 --> 00:50:42.639
A father or a mother.

00:50:42.639 --> 00:50:47.010
A husband or a wife.

00:50:51.848 --> 00:50:53.850
A brother or a sister.

00:50:57.354 --> 00:50:59.356
Every one, a patriot.

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:01.925
Every single one of these
American families deserves

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:05.295
the everlasting gratitude
and support of our

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:07.297
entire nation.

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:14.738
Today, after two major
ground wars, our Armed

00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:17.307
Forces have drawn down, and
that is natural and

00:51:17.307 --> 00:51:19.209
it is necessary.

00:51:19.209 --> 00:51:22.412
And after reckless budget
cuts of sequester, we need

00:51:22.412 --> 00:51:25.148
to keep improving the
readiness and the training

00:51:25.148 --> 00:51:28.084
and modernizing our forces.

00:51:28.084 --> 00:51:31.288
So, let me take this
opportunity, while I still

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:33.690
have it, to appeal to our
friends from Congress who

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:35.625
are here.

00:51:35.625 --> 00:51:39.463
We cannot go back
to sequestration.

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:42.999
There's a responsibility
way forward, investing into

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:46.436
America's strengths, our
national security, and our

00:51:46.436 --> 00:51:50.040
economic security, investing
in the reform and the

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.676
equipment and the support
that our troops need,

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:55.812
including the pay, and the
benefits, and the quality of

00:51:55.812 --> 00:51:59.883
life, and the education, and
the jobs that our troops and

00:51:59.883 --> 00:52:03.787
our veterans and all of
your families deserve.

00:52:03.787 --> 00:52:09.326
But make no mistake.

00:52:09.326 --> 00:52:11.261
Even with the challenges of
recent years -- and there

00:52:11.261 --> 00:52:15.565
have been challenges, our
allies and adversaries

00:52:15.565 --> 00:52:21.638
alike, understand America's
military remains, by far,

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:24.441
the most capable fighting
force on the face of the earth.

00:52:26.643 --> 00:52:30.046
Our Army, tested by years of
combat, is the best trained

00:52:30.046 --> 00:52:33.550
and best equipped planned
force on the planet.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:37.854
Our Navy is the largest and
most lethal in the world, on

00:52:37.854 --> 00:52:41.258
track to surpass 300 ships.

00:52:41.258 --> 00:52:44.628
Our Air Force, with its
precision and reach,

00:52:44.628 --> 00:52:46.730
is unmatched.

00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:49.099
Our Marine Corps is
the world's only truly

00:52:49.099 --> 00:52:50.100
expeditionary force.

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:56.640
Our Coast Guard is the
finest in the world.

00:52:56.640 --> 00:53:03.179
And we're also the best
because this military has

00:53:03.179 --> 00:53:08.952
come to welcome the talents
of more of our fellow Americans.

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:11.254
Service members can now
serve the country they love

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:17.294
without hiding who they
are, or who they love.

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:22.365
All combat positions in our
military are now open to women.

00:53:22.365 --> 00:53:26.336
And Joe Biden and I know
that women are at least as

00:53:26.336 --> 00:53:31.074
strong as men.

00:53:31.074 --> 00:53:32.509
We're stronger for it.

00:53:32.509 --> 00:53:36.446
It's one of the reasons that
our military stands apart as

00:53:36.446 --> 00:53:39.983
the most respected
institution in our nation by

00:53:39.983 --> 00:53:41.418
a mile.

00:53:41.418 --> 00:53:42.285
The American people --

00:53:42.285 --> 00:53:50.694
(applause)

00:53:50.694 --> 00:53:54.130
The American people look up
to you and your devotion to

00:53:54.130 --> 00:53:57.067
duty, and your integrity,
and your sense of honor, and

00:53:57.067 --> 00:54:02.005
your commitment
to each other.

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:07.010
One of my proudest
achievements is that I have

00:54:11.214 --> 00:54:16.152
been able to, I think,
communicate through the

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:21.157
constant partisan haze,
along with so many others,

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:27.631
how special this
institution is.

00:54:27.631 --> 00:54:31.334
And the esteem in which our
military is held has held

00:54:31.334 --> 00:54:34.471
steady and constant and high
throughout my presidency,

00:54:34.471 --> 00:54:39.209
and I am very grateful for
that because you remind us

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:43.713
that we are united
as one team.

00:54:47.717 --> 00:54:51.955
At times of division, you've
shown what it means to

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:53.923
pull together.

00:54:54.858 --> 00:54:56.760
So, my days as your
Commander-in-Chief are

00:54:56.760 --> 00:55:01.031
coming to an end, and as I
reflect on the challenges we

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:06.436
have faced together, and on
those to come, I believe

00:55:06.436 --> 00:55:08.938
that one of the greatest
tasks before our Armed

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:12.308
Forces is to retain the high
confidence that the American

00:55:12.308 --> 00:55:15.779
people rightly place in you.

00:55:15.779 --> 00:55:18.281
It's a responsibility, not
simply for those of you in

00:55:18.281 --> 00:55:21.584
uniform, but for
those who lead you.

00:55:21.584 --> 00:55:23.753
It's the responsibility
of our entire nation.

00:55:23.753 --> 00:55:27.157
And so, we are called to
remember core principles

00:55:29.693 --> 00:55:32.295
that we must never hesitate
to act, when necessary, to

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:36.166
defend our nation, but we
must also never rush into

00:55:36.166 --> 00:55:42.605
war because sending you into
harm's way should be a last,

00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:45.475
and not first resort.

00:55:45.475 --> 00:55:50.246
It should be compelled by
the needs of our security,

00:55:50.246 --> 00:55:55.752
and not our politics.

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:58.321
We need to remember that
we must not give in to the

00:55:58.321 --> 00:56:01.891
false illusion of
isolationism because in this

00:56:01.891 --> 00:56:05.495
dangerous time, oceans alone
will not protect us, and the

00:56:05.495 --> 00:56:09.632
world still seeks and needs
our leadership as the one

00:56:09.632 --> 00:56:11.634
indispensable nation.

00:56:13.236 --> 00:56:15.205
We have to remember that our
military has to be prepared

00:56:15.205 --> 00:56:18.708
for the full spectrum of
threats, conventional and

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:22.612
unconventional -- from 20th
century style aggression to

00:56:22.612 --> 00:56:27.617
21st century style
cyber threats.

00:56:27.617 --> 00:56:31.721
And when we do go to war, we
have to hold ourselves to

00:56:31.721 --> 00:56:34.624
high standards, and do
everything in our power to

00:56:34.624 --> 00:56:38.561
prevent the loss of innocent
life because that's what we

00:56:38.561 --> 00:56:40.530
stand for.

00:56:40.530 --> 00:56:42.532
That's what we
should stand for.

00:56:45.168 --> 00:56:47.070
We have to remember that as
we meet the threats of our

00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:51.474
times, we cannot sacrifice
our values or our way of

00:56:51.474 --> 00:56:57.280
life -- the rule of law and
openness and tolerance that

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.883
defines us as Americans.

00:56:59.883 --> 00:57:01.751
That is our greatest
strength, and makes us a

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:03.753
beacon to the world.

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:08.324
We cannot sacrifice the very
freedoms that we're

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:10.593
fighting for.

00:57:10.593 --> 00:57:14.497
And finally, in our
democracy, the continued

00:57:14.497 --> 00:57:18.001
strength of our
all-volunteer force also

00:57:18.001 --> 00:57:19.035
rests on something else.

00:57:19.035 --> 00:57:25.542
A strong bond of respect
and trust between those in

00:57:25.542 --> 00:57:28.178
uniform and the citizens
that you protect and defend.

00:57:30.513 --> 00:57:33.149
At a time when too few
Americans truly understand

00:57:33.149 --> 00:57:37.987
the realities or sacrifices
of military service.

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:42.659
At a time when many
political leaders have

00:57:42.659 --> 00:57:44.661
not served.

00:57:48.631 --> 00:57:51.601
If some in the military
begin to feel as though,

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:54.537
somehow, they are apart from
the largest society they

00:57:54.537 --> 00:57:56.940
serve, those bonds can fray.

00:57:59.843 --> 00:58:04.380
As every generation learns
anew, freedom is not free.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:07.150
And so, while less than 1
percent of Americans may be

00:58:07.150 --> 00:58:10.553
fighting our wars, 100
percent of Americans can do

00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:14.657
their parts, at the very
least, to support you and

00:58:14.657 --> 00:58:17.894
your families.

00:58:17.894 --> 00:58:19.529
Everybody can do something.

00:58:19.529 --> 00:58:22.999
Every business, every
profession, every school,

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:26.669
every community, every
state, to reach out and to

00:58:26.669 --> 00:58:30.240
give back, and to let you
know that we care to help

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.809
make the lives of our troops
and your families just a

00:58:32.809 --> 00:58:34.244
little bit easier.

00:58:34.244 --> 00:58:35.311
Everybody can do something.

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:38.581
And that's why Michelle and
Joe Biden have mobilized

00:58:38.581 --> 00:58:41.484
more Americans to honor
and support you and your

00:58:41.484 --> 00:58:43.486
families through
joining forces.

00:58:43.486 --> 00:58:45.889
And that's why, even after
we leave the White House,

00:58:45.889 --> 00:58:49.125
Michelle and I intend to
keep on looking for ways to

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:51.995
help rally more of our
fellow citizens to be there

00:58:51.995 --> 00:58:54.631
for you, just like you've
always been there for us.

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:04.874
So, we can't say it enough,
and we can't show it enough.

00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:07.944
Thank you for
your patriotism.

00:59:07.944 --> 00:59:10.146
Thank you for your
professionalism.

00:59:10.146 --> 00:59:13.583
Thank you for your
character, and representing

00:59:13.583 --> 00:59:15.585
the very best of the
American spirit.

00:59:16.986 --> 00:59:19.789
Our nation endures.

00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:24.060
We live free under the red,
white, and blue because of

00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:26.062
patriots like you.

00:59:27.297 --> 00:59:30.566
It has been a privilege of a
lifetime to serve with you.

00:59:32.936 --> 00:59:37.073
I have learned
much from you.

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:39.642
I am a better man
having worked with you.

00:59:41.678 --> 00:59:44.047
I'm confident that the
United States and our Armed

00:59:44.047 --> 00:59:49.185
Forces will remain the
greatest force for freedom

00:59:49.185 --> 00:59:51.187
and security the
world has ever known.

00:59:53.056 --> 00:59:55.224
God bless you and your
families, and God bless the

00:59:55.224 --> 00:59:57.360
United States of America.

00:59:57.360 --> 00:59:59.629
(applause)

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:49.278
(inaudible dialogue)

01:01:57.814 --> 01:01:59.849
(music playing)

01:05:53.182 --> 01:05:54.216
Male Speaker: Ladies and
gentlemen, the service songs

01:05:54.216 --> 01:05:57.019
of the Armed Forces
of the United States.

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:59.355
(music playing)

01:09:02.838 --> 01:09:04.540
Male Speaker: Ladies and
gentlemen, this concludes

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:07.643
today's farewell tribute in
honor of our Commander in

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:10.880
Chief, Barack Obama, the
44th President of the

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.314
United States.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:15.117
Please remain at your seats,
and enjoy the United States

01:09:15.117 --> 01:09:17.353
Army Band until the
departure of the official

01:09:17.353 --> 01:09:18.687
party from Conmy Hall.
