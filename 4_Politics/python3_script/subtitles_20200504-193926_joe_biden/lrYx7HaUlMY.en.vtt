00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 Translator: Nadine Kassem Auditor: Riyad Almubarak 

00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:16.278
 I was the CEO of a large nonprofit religious organization, 

00:00:16.278 --> 00:00:19.173
 I was a TV show host. 

00:00:19.173 --> 00:00:21.773
 A preacher in the big churches. 

00:00:21.773 --> 00:00:28.474
 I was a successful and educated American male. 

00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:32.373
 The Sufi poet Thomas Martin once said, 

00:00:32.373 --> 00:00:35.879
 "It is difficult to climb the ladder of success 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.963
 And realize when you get to the top 

00:00:37.963 --> 00:00:41.722
 That your ladder was leaning against the wrong wall. " 

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:43.663
 (Laughter) 

00:00:44.422 --> 00:00:48.262
 I knew I was three or four years old transsexual. 

00:00:48.262 --> 00:00:51.351
 For my naivety, I thought I could choose. 

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:53.553
 I thought a fairy for gender would arrive and say: 

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:56.121
 Well, it's time to choose! 

00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.582
 Unfortunately, no fairy arrived, 

00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:01.451
 I lived my life. 

00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:03.829
 I didn't hate being a male. 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.933
 I knew I was not the only one. 

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:10.011
 I went to university, got married, gave birth, got a job, 

00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:15.742
 But the original inner call is sharp as a fire alarm. 

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:16.691
 (Laughter) 

00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:19.682
 In the end, decisions must be taken. 

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:24.600
 So I announced that I am a mutant and lost all my jobs. 

00:01:25.002 --> 00:01:27.279
 I never had a bad evaluation, 

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:30.854
 I lost every job I had. 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.992
 In 21 states, you cannot be expelled because you are a transsexual, 

00:01:35.992 --> 00:01:37.420
 But in 50 states, you are expelled, 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.706
 If you were transsexual and work with religious organizations. 

00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:44.601
 Good to know! 

00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:46.803
 (Laughter) 

00:01:48.756 --> 00:01:52.272
 Being a transgender woman is not easy. 

00:01:52.272 --> 00:01:56.869
 People ask, "Do you feel that you are a 100% woman?" 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.744
 And I would answer, "Okay, if I talk to one transgender, 

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:03.271
 You spoke to one transgender. 

00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:05.719
 I cannot speak on behalf of others. " 

00:02:06.004 --> 00:02:09.753
 I feel 100% transsexual. 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.622
 There are things only a sexually compatible woman can teach. 

00:02:13.622 --> 00:02:18.731
 Which means I learn a lot about being a female, 

00:02:18.731 --> 00:02:23.209
 I also learn a lot about my ex. 

00:02:23.942 --> 00:02:25.762
 (Laughter) 

00:02:25.762 --> 00:02:29.335
 I have a unique experience because I lived on both sides - 

00:02:29.335 --> 00:02:30.332
 (Laughter) 

00:02:30.332 --> 00:02:35.391
 I am here to say that the differences between them are huge. 

00:02:35.391 --> 00:02:37.446
 (Laughter) 

00:02:38.073 --> 00:02:40.707
 (clap) 

00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:45.129
 So, I'll start with the small differences - 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.642
 Like pockets in women's jeans. 

00:02:47.642 --> 00:02:49.522
 (Laughter) 

00:02:49.522 --> 00:02:50.751
 What! 

00:02:50.751 --> 00:02:53.238
 (Cheering) (applause) 

00:02:55.514 --> 00:02:56.723
 (Laughter) 

00:02:56.723 --> 00:02:58.931
 I can't put a phone inside. 

00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:00.033
 (Laughter) 

00:03:00.033 --> 00:03:01.812
 Paper clip, perhaps. 

00:03:01.812 --> 00:03:03.626
 (Laughter) 

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:07.814
 Or the women's dress measurements. 

00:03:08.414 --> 00:03:10.682
 Do numbers mean anything? 

00:03:10.682 --> 00:03:12.382
 (Laughter) 

00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:14.522
 What is double zero? 

00:03:14.522 --> 00:03:16.111
 (Laughter) 

00:03:16.111 --> 00:03:18.271
 Ladies, I don't think you thought about that, 

00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:22.338
 But you know that there is no time in the life of the male 

00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:24.531
 He has to worry about that 

00:03:24.531 --> 00:03:29.094
 Part of his clothes might fall to the toilet seat? 

00:03:29.534 --> 00:03:32.212
 Maybe a long jacket, or belt, nothing. 

00:03:32.212 --> 00:03:34.658
 Not just a passing idea. 

00:03:34.658 --> 00:03:36.431
 (Laughter) 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.143
 Now, I cut my hair in half as I used to, 

00:03:45.763 --> 00:03:47.925
 And it costs me 10 times the price. 

00:03:47.925 --> 00:03:49.573
 (Laughter) 

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:52.476
 So I choose between cutting my hair or going on vacation. 

00:03:52.476 --> 00:03:53.952
 I can't do both. 

00:03:53.952 --> 00:03:55.541
 (Laughter) 

00:03:55.892 --> 00:04:00.163
 I meet gender differences wherever I go! 

00:04:00.163 --> 00:04:02.124
 Literally. 

00:04:02.124 --> 00:04:05.123
 I walk in the hallway and was surprised by a difference. 

00:04:05.123 --> 00:04:08.073
 Nothing is on the way, however I was surprised by a difference. 

00:04:08.073 --> 00:04:09.473
 I think, "What does this mean?" 

00:04:09.473 --> 00:04:11.471
 I know this will leave a scar 

00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:17.036
 Now, my skin is louder and I have scars everywhere. 

00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:23.175
 How do I test that my sexual identity is completely different. 

00:04:23.635 --> 00:04:27.784
 It is a total experience rather than a visual, 

00:04:28.115 --> 00:04:33.545
 Not only physical experience, but full experience. 

00:04:33.944 --> 00:04:38.322
 I can't count the times I said to Cathy, 

00:04:38.322 --> 00:04:40.391
 My ex-wife: "I'm so sorry!" 

00:04:40.391 --> 00:04:41.754
 (Laughter) 

00:04:41.754 --> 00:04:45.625
 I just didn't know about the things that I don't know. 

00:04:46.613 --> 00:04:50.744
 It is impossible for a well-educated white male to understand 

00:04:50.744 --> 00:04:53.810
 How general culture serves him. 

00:04:54.255 --> 00:04:58.538
 It is impossible to understand because that culture 

00:04:58.903 --> 00:05:01.034
 It is all that he ever knew, and everything that he knew. 

00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:03.132
 And vice versa, 

00:05:03.132 --> 00:05:07.035
 It is impossible for a woman to understand the importance of this 

00:05:07.035 --> 00:05:10.113
 Because being a woman is all I ever knew. 

00:05:10.451 --> 00:05:14.511
 Perhaps there is a doubt that she is doing twice his work 

00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:17.352
 She gets half of his salary, but she has no idea 

00:05:17.352 --> 00:05:21.713
 Its difficult for her compared to the young man with the Brooks Brothers jacket 

00:05:21.713 --> 00:05:23.767
 And the one sitting in the corresponding office. 

00:05:24.154 --> 00:05:27.279
 I know! You were that guy! 

00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:30.514
 And I thought I was a good young man, 

00:05:30.514 --> 00:05:32.805
 Gentle with women, 

00:05:32.805 --> 00:05:34.681
 Treat them equally. 

00:05:35.025 --> 00:05:37.901
 Then came the first time I got on the plane as a woman. 

00:05:38.253 --> 00:05:42.211
 It flew 2.3 million miles on American Airlines. 

00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:44.252
 I knew my way on the plane. 

00:05:44.252 --> 00:05:46.383
 And American Airlines treated me kindly when I turned, 

00:05:46.383 --> 00:05:49.292
 But the passengers on their planes were not. 

00:05:49.663 --> 00:05:54.231
 The first time I went as a coward, I was going from Denver to Charlotte, 

00:05:54.231 --> 00:05:56.760
 I got up and there were things on my chair. 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.663
 I picked it up to put my things, and a young man said, "It's my stuff." 

00:06:01.663 --> 00:06:04.853
 I said, "Yes, but it's my seat 

00:06:04.853 --> 00:06:07.682
 So I will carry it for you while you find your seat, 

00:06:07.682 --> 00:06:09.114
 Then I will give it to you. " 

00:06:09.114 --> 00:06:12.024
 So he said, "Madam, it's my seat!" 

00:06:12.024 --> 00:06:14.933
 And I said, "Actually, it's not. It's my seat." 

00:06:14.933 --> 00:06:15.964
 (Laughter) 

00:06:15.964 --> 00:06:17.824
 1 d, 1 d. 

00:06:17.824 --> 00:06:21.583
 But I'll be glad to carry her until you find your seat! " 

00:06:21.583 --> 00:06:24.243
 He said: "What should I tell you? It's my seat!" 

00:06:24.243 --> 00:06:26.083
 I said, "Yes, it is not." 

00:06:26.083 --> 00:06:28.175
 (Laughter) 

00:06:28.175 --> 00:06:30.072
 The moment the man standing behind me said, 

00:06:30.072 --> 00:06:33.014
 "Lady, would you take your damned argument 

00:06:33.014 --> 00:06:35.355
 Where else to get in the plane? " 

00:06:36.033 --> 00:06:39.461
 I was totally shocked! 

00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:43.127
 I was not treated like this when I was a male. 

00:06:43.127 --> 00:06:45.304
 I would have said: "It's my seat," 

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:48.255
 And let the man immediately look at his seat number 

00:06:48.255 --> 00:06:49.643
 And he said, "Oh, I'm sorry." 

00:06:49.643 --> 00:06:53.615
 I know because it was happening all the time! 

00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:57.054
 The flight attendant took our seat numbers. 

00:06:57.054 --> 00:07:00.864
 She said to the man: "Sir, you are on 1 C. It is on 1 D." 

00:07:00.864 --> 00:07:04.375
 I put his things in his seat, he didn't say a word, 

00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:07.163
 And of course you know who sat next to me at 1F, 

00:07:07.163 --> 00:07:08.131
 (Laughter) 

00:07:08.131 --> 00:07:11.164
 He is Mr. "Would you take your argument elsewhere." 

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:12.235
 (Laughter) 

00:07:12.235 --> 00:07:14.600
 So my friend Karen, who works with these lines, 

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:17.536
 I went up to the plane to give the pilot his papers. 

00:07:17.536 --> 00:07:19.592
 She left waving to me. 

00:07:19.592 --> 00:07:21.814
 When Charlotte arrived, she called me. 

00:07:21.814 --> 00:07:25.182
 She said, "Paula, what happened? 

00:07:25.182 --> 00:07:27.898
 I was pale as a card! 

00:07:28.344 --> 00:07:30.694
 I told her and she said, "Yes. 

00:07:31.464 --> 00:07:33.724
 Welcome to the world of women! 

00:07:33.724 --> 00:07:35.065
 (Laughter) 

00:07:35.474 --> 00:07:41.267
 The truth is, I will not live long to lose my male traits. 

00:07:41.695 --> 00:07:44.826
 She stayed with me when she turned sexual. 

00:07:44.826 --> 00:07:46.316
 (Laughter) 

00:07:46.316 --> 00:07:49.142
 I have been a man for many centuries. 

00:07:50.662 --> 00:07:53.403
 But this does not mean that my strength is not diminishing. 

00:07:53.403 --> 00:07:55.733
 Let me tell you something else that I noticed. 

00:07:55.733 --> 00:08:00.583
 Apparently, since I became a woman, I have become stupid. 

00:08:00.583 --> 00:08:02.594
 (Laughter) 

00:08:04.152 --> 00:08:09.846
 I think it's decreasing testosterone and estrogen arrivals 

00:08:09.846 --> 00:08:12.336
 It is what made me lose my brain cells 

00:08:12.336 --> 00:08:15.753
 Necessary to be a fully effective human being. 

00:08:15.753 --> 00:08:17.083
 (Laughter) 

00:08:17.475 --> 00:08:20.743
 Either this or I am still as smart as I was, 

00:08:20.743 --> 00:08:25.604
 But I am constantly being manipulated by men. 

00:08:25.604 --> 00:08:27.259
 (Laughter) 

00:08:27.984 --> 00:08:30.557
 (clap) 

00:08:32.105 --> 00:08:37.014
 I was in a local bike shop in Denver and an employee said: 

00:08:37.014 --> 00:08:38.235
 "how can I help you?" 

00:08:38.235 --> 00:08:40.065
 So I said, "Yes. 

00:08:40.065 --> 00:08:43.435
 Is it possible for a gray fisher bicycle tire 

00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:47.482
 To tilt, causing the rear brake to rub? " 

00:08:47.482 --> 00:08:50.585
 He said, "Breaking the cylinders should be checked regularly." 

00:08:51.015 --> 00:08:53.763
 I said, "I know that, 

00:08:53.763 --> 00:08:57.612
 And I check it regularly. " 

00:08:57.612 --> 00:09:00.363
 He said, "Oh, well, then the bike rotor is broken." 

00:09:00.363 --> 00:09:03.646
 I said, "Not broken. I know the broken roundabout." 

00:09:03.646 --> 00:09:07.535
 He said sympathetically: "Well, what do you want to do?" 

00:09:08.004 --> 00:09:11.045
 I said, "You can answer my question." 

00:09:11.045 --> 00:09:12.343
 (Laughter) 

00:09:12.343 --> 00:09:15.135
 Then Kyle, the store manager. 

00:09:15.135 --> 00:09:16.496
 It was very nice. 

00:09:16.496 --> 00:09:19.011
 He said, "I think you are right. 

00:09:19.011 --> 00:09:20.705
 Let me ask you a question: 

00:09:20.705 --> 00:09:23.515
 Does this vertigo cause a problem in the back frame 

00:09:23.515 --> 00:09:25.174
 When you pull it hard? 

00:09:25.174 --> 00:09:26.934
 I said, "Yes, exactly!" 

00:09:26.934 --> 00:09:29.300
 He said: "Yes, the frame is weak." 

00:09:29.857 --> 00:09:34.074
 I wanted to get off at his feet and invite him to the blessed! 

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.314
 (Laughter) 

00:09:35.314 --> 00:09:38.121
 Someone took me seriously! 

00:09:38.446 --> 00:09:40.507
 It happens all the time now. 

00:09:40.507 --> 00:09:43.304
 I have to talk to someone three or four times 

00:09:43.304 --> 00:09:45.458
 Before he gives me a clear answer! 

00:09:45.895 --> 00:09:47.727
 And there is something deeper: 

00:09:48.225 --> 00:09:51.904
 The more you are treated like you do not understand what you are saying, 

00:09:51.904 --> 00:09:53.363
 Whenever you start to ask 

00:09:53.363 --> 00:09:58.436
 Do you really understand what you're saying or not, right? 

00:09:58.436 --> 00:10:00.445
 (clap) 

00:10:03.043 --> 00:10:07.500
 I understand a woman's tendency to be suspicious of herself. 

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.649
 Have you noticed that if a woman was among a group of men, 

00:10:10.649 --> 00:10:12.193
 And you know she's right about what, 

00:10:12.193 --> 00:10:14.166
 Will she apologize for that? 

00:10:14.454 --> 00:10:17.676
 She says, "I'm sorry, but I don't think the numbers are correct." 

00:10:17.676 --> 00:10:21.274
 You know, you don't have to apologize when you're right. 

00:10:21.274 --> 00:10:24.159
 (Cheering) (applause) 

00:10:28.593 --> 00:10:32.025
 Since I'm new to this sex, I asked my girlfriend Jane. 

00:10:32.025 --> 00:10:35.344
 I said, "What are women looking for in men?" 

00:10:35.344 --> 00:10:40.076
 She said, "We are looking for a man who can distinguish us 

00:10:40.076 --> 00:10:43.136
 A man who understands that being women does not mean that we are less or weaker, 

00:10:43.136 --> 00:10:44.184
 We are just different, 

00:10:44.184 --> 00:10:48.397
 Our nature is more understanding and needs to be understood. " 

00:10:49.185 --> 00:10:52.795
 Now, many men value women, 

00:10:52.795 --> 00:10:55.453
 Like my good friend, Mark preacher 

00:10:55.453 --> 00:10:58.613
 It always brings out the best in me 

00:10:58.613 --> 00:11:02.016
 And happy to see me take over after that. 

00:11:02.016 --> 00:11:03.856
 We need more men like Mark, 

00:11:03.856 --> 00:11:07.954
 They want to appreciate and empower women. 

00:11:08.635 --> 00:11:12.315
 I know I will find more differences 

00:11:12.315 --> 00:11:15.081
 On my trip. But let me leave you with this. 

00:11:15.081 --> 00:11:18.927
 To women, I give you thanks with all my heart, 

00:11:19.313 --> 00:11:22.647
 I usually feel like an outsider. 

00:11:23.216 --> 00:11:27.133
 I arrived too late for the female sex, 

00:11:27.986 --> 00:11:31.543
 But you show me great gratitude and sympathy. 

00:11:32.128 --> 00:11:36.657
 You should know that you can do more. 

00:11:36.657 --> 00:11:39.560
 You are stronger than you think 

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.151
 You reflect the best aspects of what it means to be a human being. 

00:11:45.055 --> 00:11:46.166
 And to you guys 

00:11:46.166 --> 00:11:49.606
 Who often feel uncomfortable now - 

00:11:49.606 --> 00:11:51.572
 (Laughter) 

00:11:52.375 --> 00:11:54.772
 I really understand. 

00:11:55.324 --> 00:11:57.593
 I never thought I would have that privilege, 

00:11:58.425 --> 00:11:59.956
 But I did. 

00:12:02.833 --> 00:12:04.566
 And you are. 

00:12:05.216 --> 00:12:06.743
 What can you do? 

00:12:07.115 --> 00:12:08.957
 You can believe us 

00:12:09.208 --> 00:12:12.565
 When we tell you that we might, perhaps, be equal to you, 

00:12:12.565 --> 00:12:15.117
 But we are not treated fairly. 

00:12:15.515 --> 00:12:19.252
 It is not a field of competition, it has never been. 

00:12:19.709 --> 00:12:23.437
 You can treat us equally as a solution. 

00:12:23.437 --> 00:12:26.026
 You have that power. 

00:12:27.586 --> 00:12:29.518
 To all of us, 

00:12:29.518 --> 00:12:31.677
 Do you know who I think all the time? 

00:12:32.893 --> 00:12:35.915
 I think of my daughter with dark skin, 

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.847
 My son's wife is also dark in skin. 

00:12:38.847 --> 00:12:41.305
 What do they know and I don't know? 

00:12:41.305 --> 00:12:46.058
 What do we know about situations and things we have never experienced? 

00:12:46.656 --> 00:12:50.815
 It's hard to be a woman, and to be a transgender. 

00:12:50.815 --> 00:12:54.025
 As a man, I did not know the things that I do not know. 

00:12:54.516 --> 00:12:56.315
 Would I be converted again? 

00:12:56.315 --> 00:12:58.314
 Of course I will, 

00:12:58.314 --> 00:13:03.357
 Because the call of truth is great, it is sacred, 

00:13:03.357 --> 00:13:05.822
 It pays for the better. 

00:13:07.384 --> 00:13:11.429
 For 45 years, my father has been a fundamentalist preacher. 

00:13:12.034 --> 00:13:14.722
 My mom is even tighter - 

00:13:14.722 --> 00:13:16.739
 (Laughter) 

00:13:17.906 --> 00:13:21.294
 When I announced my sexual transformation, they refused me. 

00:13:21.294 --> 00:13:23.680
 I thought I would never talk to them again. 

00:13:24.394 --> 00:13:27.642
 Last January, I took advantage of the opportunity and called my father 

00:13:27.642 --> 00:13:29.217
 On his birthday, he spoke to me. 

00:13:29.466 --> 00:13:32.165
 We talked for half an hour, and after about a month, 

00:13:32.165 --> 00:13:35.808
 I asked to visit them and they agreed. 

00:13:35.808 --> 00:13:40.316
 Last spring, I had a three-hour visit. 

00:13:40.316 --> 00:13:42.465
 I met them twice since then. 

00:13:42.836 --> 00:13:46.255
 But that day, around the end of the discussion, 

00:13:46.255 --> 00:13:49.279
 Today, my father said important things. 

00:13:50.126 --> 00:13:52.146
 When I got ready to go - 

00:13:54.218 --> 00:13:55.476
 He said- 

00:13:55.476 --> 00:13:57.798
 (clap) 

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:03.176
 When I got ready, he said: 

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.742
 Paula - 

00:14:07.297 --> 00:14:09.307
 Call me Paula - 

00:14:10.457 --> 00:14:13.657
 (clap) 

00:14:19.715 --> 00:14:23.414
 He said, "Paula, I don't understand this, 

00:14:23.414 --> 00:14:25.878
 But I intend to try. " 

00:14:26.885 --> 00:14:30.979
 My dad is 93 years old, 

00:14:31.857 --> 00:14:34.272
 He intends to try. 

00:14:35.036 --> 00:14:37.091
 What will I look for more? 

00:14:37.389 --> 00:14:39.910
 I hugged him deeply. 

00:14:40.776 --> 00:14:47.679
 One man is ready to give up his strength because he knew 

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:50.756
 What he knew, he knew that he loved his child, 

00:14:51.247 --> 00:14:54.987
 He was ready to do what it took 

00:14:54.987 --> 00:14:58.667
 To honor another father’s journey. 

00:14:59.271 --> 00:15:00.557
 thank you. 

00:15:00.557 --> 00:15:03.242
 (Applause) (Cheering)
