you don't want to risk them coming up
and<00:07:21.430><c> then</c><00:07:21.550><c> dying</c><00:07:21.790><c> because</c><00:07:22.390><c> they</c><00:07:22.570><c> can't</c>

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:22.900 align:start position:0%

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
and then dying because they can't
photosynthesize<00:07:23.590><c> so</c><00:07:23.890><c> we're</c><00:07:24.550><c> definitely</c>
