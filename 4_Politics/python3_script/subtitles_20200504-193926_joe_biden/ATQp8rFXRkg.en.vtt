00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.550
Auschwitz-Birkenau was the largest extermination

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:05.890
center created by the Nazis,

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.200
it has become the symbol of the Holocaust
and of wilful radical evil in our time.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.880
The album you will see presented here is known as the Auschwitz album

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.640
and it is the only surviving visual
evidence of the process of mass

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.840
murder at Auschwitz-Birkenau.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.080
The album is unique, there is not a similar
album

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.550
of its kind in the entire world; it documents

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.661
in photos from every direction

00:00:34.661 --> 00:00:39.890
and from every angle the arrival at Auschwitz
the selection of those slated

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.130
for immediate death and of the few who were

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.820
destined to be slave laborers.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.530
The confiscation of their property and the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.760
preparation for the physical annihilation of a transport of Jewish people.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.810
This transport of Hungarian Jews from

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:01.300
the area of Carpathian Ruthenia arrived at
the ramp of the extermination camp

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.840
Auschwitz-Birkenau in May 1944.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.060
In the photos we see the men women and children

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.500
step out of the overcrowded train, traumatized

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.180
and fearful after their horrendous journey.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.530
They have no clue that they have just been
delivered to a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.580
death factory and that few of them will survive.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.500
Survivor and Nobel Peace Prize

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.400
laureate Elie Wiesel described his arrival

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.180
as a teenager at Auschwitz

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.760
"Every yard or so an SS man held his gun trained
on us hand in hand we followed

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.869
the crowd 'men to the left women to the right'

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.400
eight words spoken indifferently

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.420
without emotion, eight short simple words.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.180
For a part of a second I glimpsed my

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.079
mother and my sister moving to the right,
I saw them disappear into the distance

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.840
while I walked on with my father and the other men.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.790
I did not know that at that

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.120
place at that moment I was parting from my
mother and my sister forever."

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.480
The selection process carried out by SS doctors

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.540
and wardens took place 24 hours

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.700
a day, seven days a week as train after train
unloaded its human cargo.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.520
Most Jews were sent immediately to the left

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.080
to their death.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.680
The undressing rooms of the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.580
gas chambers were not sufficient for the masses

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.800
of Hungarian Jews who arrived daily in the summer of 1944.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.520
They therefore had to wait until the

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.830
undressing rooms were ready to absorb them.

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.240
The common waiting place was the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.260
grove closest to the crematorium that would
soon turn their bodies to ash.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.020
They were told to sit among the trees and

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.140
wait for further instructions.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.420
These were their last peaceful moments together

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.920
before being driven into the gas chambers and murdered.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.320
It has been said that there will never be people as

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.100
innocent as the victims on the threshold of
the gas chambers.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.800
The SS kept the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.019
victims destined for gassing in complete ignorance
of what lay in store for them,

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.629
they were told that before being placed in

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:32.780
the camp they had to be disinfected and washed.

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.820
They would soon discover that what they had
assumed where the shower

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.280
areas were actually hermetically sealed gas chambers.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.260
A minority of Jews was selected for forced

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.940
labor; their personal belongings

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.569
were confiscated, their hair was shaved and
a registration number was tattooed

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.420
on their left arm.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.820
In the words of survivor and author Primo
Levi,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.299
"For the first time we became aware that our language

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.720
lacks words to express this

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:14.139
offense, the demolition of a man, it is not
possible to sink lower than this.

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.639
Nothing belongs to us anymore, they have taken

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.420
away our clothes, our Shoes, even our hair,

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.340
if we speak they will
not listen to us and if they listen

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.420
they will not understand.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.640
They will even take away our name and if we
want to

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.759
keep it we will have to find in ourselves

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.040
the strength to do so.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:43.960
It is in this way that one can understand the double
sense of the term extermination camp."

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.220
The work of sorting the positions that the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.820
Jews brought with them to

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:53.810
Auschwitz was done by Jewish prisoners who
were forced to collect the packages

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.280
and sort the items that would then be sent to the Reich.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.140
By the time the sorting was completed most

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:04.740
of the previous owners were already dead.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.500
No memory of the men, women and children that

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.180
were deemed valueless upon their arrival remains in camp records.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.220
This album is the sole witness to their fate.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.020
The Auschwitz album was discovered after the

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.801
war by Lilly Jacob, a survivor of the

00:05:25.801 --> 00:05:27.860
transports pictured here.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.379
Lilly gave the album to Yad Vashem where she
knew that

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.990
it's tragic contents would be safeguarded

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:38.020
for posterity and shared with generations to come.
