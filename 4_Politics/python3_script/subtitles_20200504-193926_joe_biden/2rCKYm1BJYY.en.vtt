00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.970
It’s the video many of you have been asking
for for some time now.

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.430
Ever since I published the video about my
solar panel system on my home earlier in the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.610
year, and my experience with the installation
and energy production I’ve been seeing,

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.269
I’ve been asked for an update on how it’s
going.

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.209
By a lot of people.

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.060
Well, it’s time.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.170
How much energy production have I been seeing?

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.330
How much money have I spent versus how much
I’ve saved?

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.080
I’m going to cover it all.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.539
But before we dive in take a moment and hit
the subscribe button, so you don’t miss

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.710
out on future videos like this one.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.940
I’m Matt Ferrell ... welcome to Undecided.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.300
I had my solar panels installed in September
of 2018 and turned on at the beginning of

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.309
October.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.820
It was a long and drawn out process, but pretty
straight forward.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.489
You can check out my previous solar panel
video for details around that experience.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.980
On that video, as well as my videos on energy
storage, I’ve gotten a lot of comments about

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.070
how solar isn’t worth it because you’re
not getting energy on cloudy days, when it’s

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.960
snowing, or can’t live off-grid and it only
works in certain locations.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.840
There’s usually a nugget of truth in those
comments, but they all miss the bigger picture

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.590
for why solar works for so many people.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.540
For me specifically … I live near Boston,
so knew going in that my solar production

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.890
during the winter months would be less than
ideal.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.260
My home and the surrounding environment is
also a bit challenging with trees blocking

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.570
the late afternoon and early evening sun.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.350
My goal has never been to be 100% on solar.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.260
For my specific situation that’s not possible,
but it might be for many others.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.320
My goal is to get as much energy as I can
from a renewable and sustainable resource;

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.680
to reduce my carbon footprint as much as I
can; and do it in a financially responsible

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.200
way that works for me.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.750
So have I been achieving that goal?

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.060
The jury is still out, but things look like
they’re on the right track.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.550
It was a little anti-climactic turning on
my solar panels for the first time since it

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.920
was a rainy day in October.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.129
I also knew whatever I saw that month was
only going to drop the following month since

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.630
we were heading into winter.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.680
My system is managed by Enphase, which has
an “okay” app for checking high level

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.230
data for day-to-day production.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.870
The way my system is set up, I don’t see
down-to-the-minute production numbers, but

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.400
that hasn’t bothered me too much because
I also have a Sense energy monitor installed.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.900
I have a video on the Sense, too, if you’d
like to see more on how it works and my experiences

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.370
with it, but it’s a pretty cool system that
lets me see real time data for my home energy

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.599
use and solar panel production.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.320
Between the two I have some great data for
comparison along side my electric bill.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.040
One of the common topics that’s come up
in a lot of comments is the cost of maintenance.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.819
It’s still early days, but so far my cost
has been … zero.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.319
That’s not to say there’s been no upkeep
on the system, but I haven’t had to pay

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.370
anything out of pocket to keep the system
up and running.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.170
Over the winter we had a number of good snow
storms that dumped a lot of snow on the roof.

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.849
What I found was that light snow typically
didn’t stick to the panels at all and melted

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.639
away almost as fast as it landed on the panels.

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.930
Heavier snow would accumulate just like a
roof without panels though.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.519
If the sun came out within the next day or
two, we’d often find mini avalanches of

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.950
snow as the panels cleared themselves.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.499
Our roof was clear far sooner than my neighbors
without panels.

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:24.150
A few times I pulled out a roof rake to clear
off the panels quickly to try and maximize

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.340
our solar production, especially if the sun
was shining again after the storm.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.450
I have a small house and can reach about 90%
of the panels from the ground with my roof

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.450
rake.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.930
It took about 15-20 minutes to clear everything
off, so wasn’t too much of a chore.

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.160
(Shoveling away the snow that fell is another
story…)

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.029
In the warmer months you’ll notice pollen
and dust buildup if it hasn’t rained in

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:45.029
a while.

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:49.319
If it gets really coated, you might start
to see a minor hit to energy production efficiency,

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:50.450
but I haven’t.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:54.349
In my area it’s rained frequently enough
that I haven’t had do any manual cleaning.

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.489
I did it once to see how difficult it would
be, but all it took was a quick spray from

00:03:58.489 --> 00:03:59.919
a garden hose.

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:04.250
To be more water efficient I bought an attachment
for my roof rake that has a mop and squeegee

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.250
head.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.760
I still haven’t had to use it though.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.540
We did have two separate incidents where the
solar panels stopped producing electricity,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.349
which was throwing errors in the Enphase system.

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.530
My solar installer came out right away and
determined that my AC disconnect switch was

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.570
malfunctioning.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.940
The first time out they switched everything
off and on again to get it working.

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.290
The second time out they ended up replacing
the faulty switch and everything has been

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:27.700
working perfectly since.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.480
Looking at the energy production from the
beginning of October, you can see a clear

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.490
trend.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.510
My solar production starts at around 250 kWh
for October, but quickly drops to a low of

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.650
about 100 kWh in December.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.540
This low period continued through February,
but more startling is when you look at the

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.130
production numbers against the consumption
numbers.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.880
We’re typically using between 700 - 1000
kWh per month.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.430
And before anyone says anything in the comments,
yes that’s high, but it’s not out of line

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.760
for the average home in the United States.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.380
Energy conservation is as important as clean
energy production, but that’s a separate

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.510
video.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.510
To say that I was excited to see how my production
would take an upswing in the spring would

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.650
be an understatement.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.590
I was like a kid eagerly awaiting Christmas
morning for my Red Ryder Carbine-Action Two-Hundred-Shot

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.390
Range Model Air Rifle.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:27.080
March is when everything took a sudden turn
with production hitting around 670 kWh, which

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.140
meant March covered two-thirds of our energy
use.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.360
Step into April and May and things stayed
fairly consistent for production.

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.780
Since April we’ve been meeting or exceeding
our energy use from our solar panels.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.090
For me the highlight was when my wife couldn’t
stop laughing when she opened the April electric

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.610
bill and saw that we owed $10.94.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.290
Compare that to the previous year at $233.40
… you can probably understand why she was

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:54.290
laughing.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.590
Our June bill is the first one with a credit
of $38.36 on our account, which most likely

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:02.810
means we won’t have a bill to pay in July,
either.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.990
If you step back you’ll see a sine wave
pattern emerging for our solar production,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.160
which means I can provide a pretty good estimate
for what the rest of the summer and early

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.860
fall will look like.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.380
Depending on how it plays out over July through
the beginning of October, it’s looking like

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.280
we may come in around the low 6,000 kWh range
for the year.

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.270
The estimate we received from our installer
was 6,615 kWh for the first year, so I think

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.090
we’re going to fall a little shy of the
estimate.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:33.770
If that turns out to be the case, it’ll
be disappointing, but not a showstopper … and

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.600
it’s also only half the story.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.840
For the other half of the story we need to
look at the money.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:46.690
Here’s a look at our electric bill’s kWh
over time.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.380
All the way through 2018 up until June.

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.600
Across the board you can see that we’ve
done better, especially once you hit March.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.530
For the actual electric bill price it looks
very similar.

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.190
The delta between what we’ve paid in the
past spring and summer vs. what we’re paying

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.530
now is substantial.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.930
Just in electricity costs we’ve seen $929
in savings from the previous year, which accounts

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.060
for a 48% drop from before solar panels ($1919).

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.830
But if you want a truer apples to apples price,
it’s easy to calculate the price per kWh

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.500
the panels have been generating.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.280
Just take the cost per kWh and multiply that
by the kWh’s the system has been producing.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.840
Since we’re on full net metering, we’re
getting full credit for all of the solar power

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.180
we’re using or putting back into the grid.

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:27.890
That’s $873 so far.

00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:32.490
When you add in the SREC program, which are
credits paid out for how much electricity

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.940
you put back into the grid, that adds another
$1,136 on top of that.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.100
We have a 10 year solar loan that has had
a minimum payment for the first year of $148

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.440
a month, but we didn’t start paying for
that until December.

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.990
If we retroactively roll those payments back
for October and November, you’d be looking

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:54.190
at $1,332 in loan payments for the same time
period.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.610
That’s a lot of numbers I just threw at
you, so let’s break this down at a high

00:07:58.610 --> 00:07:59.610
level.

00:07:59.610 --> 00:08:03.170
That’s $873 in solar production, plus $1,136
for SRECs, minus $1,332 in loan payments.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.870
We end up positive by $677 so far.

00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:06.810
If we didn’t have SRECs, we’d be $-459.

00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:08.820
Would that mean it’s not worth it?

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.560
For me, no.

00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:14.790
Paying the minimum on the solar loan will
pay it off in 10 years, but we’re not doing

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.790
that.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.580
We’ve actually been overpaying the loan
already to get it paid off earlier than 10

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:20.580
years.

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.540
That will reduce the loan interest we’re
having to pay and help the solar panels hit

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:24.980
break even sooner.

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.020
The solar panels are warrantied for 25 years,
but can be expected to work well beyond that

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.020
timeframe as well.

00:08:31.020 --> 00:08:35.749
So again, even without SRECs the system would
hit break even and turn a little profit before

00:08:35.749 --> 00:08:36.749
its true end of life.

00:08:36.749 --> 00:08:41.430
And as much as people like to hold up incentive
programs and subsidies as to why solar panels

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.519
don’t work, we do have them.

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:46.470
Once you put those numbers back into play,
you can see that we’re actually getting

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:50.120
money back from our system today even with
our minimum loan payment.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.550
That means our out of pocket costs for the
system are close to a wash for the loan payback

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:55.620
period right now.

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.550
Our loan payment and electric bill are balanced
out with the solar energy production and SREC

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:05.000
credits across the past nine months, and that
should hold true for the year.

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.459
So what about the system turning a profit?

00:09:11.459 --> 00:09:13.640
What is the payback period?

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.061
Like I’ve said before, it’s still a little
early to tell for sure because I’d like

00:09:17.061 --> 00:09:19.810
to have at least one year of data for that.

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:24.029
However, filling in the blanks for those few
months we’re missing, here’s how it’s

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:25.029
looking right now.

00:09:25.029 --> 00:09:33.519
Our system cost $29,609 for a 9.49 kW system
made up of 26 LG 365 watt panels.

00:09:33.519 --> 00:09:37.620
In my previous video I had said we were going
to get a $9,883 tax credit, but that was a

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.210
typo.

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:43.589
It should have been an $8,883 tax credit.

00:09:43.589 --> 00:09:47.860
Once we got that credit back on our tax refund
we immediately applied it to the solar panel

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:54.079
loan, which knocked the final amount we’re
paying off to $20,726.

00:09:54.079 --> 00:09:58.870
Depending on the rate we pay off the loan
it could be close $6,800 in interest over

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:03.459
10 years, which is why we’re paying it off
faster to reduce that amount.

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:07.730
For the sake of the numbers here, I’ll keep
that interest in here for a total of $27,526

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.160
on the loan.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:17.980
We’re getting $126.22 a month in SREC credits
for 10 years, so we’ll be seeing $15,146

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:18.980
from that.

00:10:18.980 --> 00:10:21.660
That leaves us on the hook for $12,380 out
of pocket.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.190
But then you have to look at the money we’re
saving on our electric bill.

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:29.590
We were spending about $2,600 a year on electricity,
but will most likely be spending about $1,100.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.550
That’s a savings of $1,500 in the first
year.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:39.139
If we assumed that electricity prices won’t
increase (they will) and my panels will produce

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:45.769
the exact same amount for those 10 years (they
won’t), then I’d be looking at $15,000

00:10:45.769 --> 00:10:48.160
in savings over the first 10 years.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.450
That would mean the solar panels will have
reached their payback period in about 8 years,

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:57.059
which is right in the ballpark of what we
calculated before having them installed.

00:10:57.059 --> 00:11:02.220
Yes, there is variability in there because
of the cost of electricity and reduced panel

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.550
efficiency over time, but I’m putting that
to the side for simplicity.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:09.959
In reality, I don’t think it’s going to
change that prediction much at all.

00:11:09.959 --> 00:11:15.329
In the U.S. electricity prices have risen
by 15% over the past 10 years, which is about

00:11:15.329 --> 00:11:17.680
$0.02 per kWh per year.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.829
But that varies depending on the region.

00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:23.740
In my area specifically, prices have increased
10% in the past 10 years.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:29.899
And under my panel warranty, they’re guaranteed
to produce at least 88.4% of their original

00:11:29.899 --> 00:11:30.899
efficiency, which means you’re talking about
a .5% drop each year.

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:35.290
If anything, I’m going to see the cash amount
saved in electricity increase each year because

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:40.459
of how quickly the electricity prices are
rising … not a drop because of a minor decrease

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:41.800
in panel efficiency.

00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:46.540
Again, depending on the cost of electricity
and without the SREC credits, I’d be looking

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.769
at a payback period closer to 13 years (not
including interest).

00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:55.329
And if I also didn’t have the tax credit,
I’d be looking at closer to 18 years.

00:11:55.329 --> 00:12:00.259
No matter how I sliced the numbers, I always
came out with my specific solar panel installation

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.460
earning it’s money back before the system’s
end of life.

00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:12.639
So have I achieved my goal to get as much
energy as I can from a renewable and sustainable

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:13.639
resource?

00:12:13.639 --> 00:12:17.630
To reduce my carbon footprint as much as I
can and do it in a financially responsible

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:20.819
way that works for me?

00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:23.110
Yes.

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:26.259
Financially right now we’re in the same
month to month position as we were before

00:12:26.259 --> 00:12:30.689
solar panels, but we’re getting the benefit
of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels

00:12:30.689 --> 00:12:32.480
for our energy use.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:37.380
In another 8 years or so we should have the
system completely paid off and turning a tidy

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.829
little profit for us going forward.

00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:44.199
So far, so good … but I’ll be keeping
a close eye on my system and how it’s holding

00:12:44.199 --> 00:12:45.570
to those predictions over time.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:49.371
I don’t anticipate any maintenance costs
to throw this off by too much either, but

00:12:49.371 --> 00:12:50.371
time will tell.

00:12:50.371 --> 00:12:54.970
Now, if you’re interested in going solar,
I strongly recommend checking out EnergySage

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:57.730
for research and articles, which is a completely
free service.

00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:02.360
They have great write-ups and reviews of different
solar panels, inverters, and solar tech that

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.060
can be useful no matter where you live.

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:08.160
But if you live in the U.S. and are interested
in going solar, you can get quotes from installers

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.940
by using my Energysage portal.

00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:13.610
You can plug in your information and request
quotes from solar installers, which all get

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.449
funneled into your EnergySage account.

00:13:15.449 --> 00:13:18.500
You don’t have to worry about getting flooded
with phone calls.

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.500
It makes it easy to compare installers, cost
estimates and energy production quotes in

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.500
one place.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.500
And installers also have customer rankings
and feedback, so you can find a reputable

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:22.500
and good quality installer.

00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:23.500
I’ve used it myself and can vouch for how
well it helped me through the process.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.680
So what’s your experience?

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.540

your solar panel system has been performing

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.540
for you.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:29.860
Meeting expectations?

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:33.779
