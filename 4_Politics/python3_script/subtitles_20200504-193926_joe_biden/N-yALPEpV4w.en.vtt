 Translator: Rubik Cheng Reviewer: Amanda Chu 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:09.850
 thank you all 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.525
 When i was young 

00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:15.310
 My parents often take me to camp in California 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.080
 There are various places such as beach, forest or desert 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.063
 Some people say there is no life in the desert 

00:00:22.063 --> 00:00:25.520
 But my parents want me to observe these wild animals around: 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.140
 Falcon, eagle or tortoise, etc. 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.370
 Once we were camping 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.399
 Found a baby scorpion showing its sting 

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:36.760
 I thought to myself now, it's so cool 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.411
 Why is there such a cute but so dangerous thing? 

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:43.526
 After graduating from college, I moved to California 

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:46.410
 Start some environmental related activities 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.466
 Participated in the rescue of the last redwood forest in the United States 

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:55.545
 And prevent the establishment of a storage area for radioactive waste in the desert 

00:00:55.545 --> 00:00:56.890
 Shortly after turning 30 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.410
 I decided to exhaust my life 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.278
 To solve the problem of climate change 

00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:03.685
 I'm worried about global warming 

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:09.797
 Will eventually destroy the various natural environments that people strive to protect 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.860
 To solve this problem, I think it's technically very simple 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.403
 Popularization of electric vehicles equipped with solar panels on all roofs, etc. 

00:01:16.403 --> 00:01:18.820
 The biggest problem is in policy 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.260
 So I assist the nation’s largest labor union and the largest environmental group to jointly organize an alliance 

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:30.090
 Our proposal is a $300 billion renewable energy investment plan 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.034
 The idea is not just to prevent climate change 

00:01:33.034 --> 00:01:35.795
 And in a fast-growing high-tech field 

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.440
 Create millions of jobs 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.629
 In 2007, our efforts yielded results 

00:01:41.629 --> 00:01:45.500
 The then presidential candidate Barack Obama accepted our vision 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.469
 Between 2009 and 2015 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:54.040
 U.S. invests $150 billion in clean energy technologies such as renewable energy 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.960
 But at the beginning, we encountered some problems 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.659
 First, the cost of electricity generated by rooftop solar panels is twice that of solar power plants 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.719
 And solar and wind power plants 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:11.579
 All need a large area of ​​land to install solar panels and fans 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.590
 And build a huge power transmission system 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.780
 To send electricity from the countryside to the city 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.825
 These things are often affected by the local community 

00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:25.205
 And the backlash of conservation biologists 

00:02:25.205 --> 00:02:30.120
 They worry that wild birds and other animals will be persecuted 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.830
 At that time, many people tried to solve this problem in terms of technology. 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.617
 A big challenge is the intermittent nature of solar and wind power 

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:43.410
 They only generate electricity 10% to 30% of the year 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.535
 But there are still some proposals 

00:02:46.535 --> 00:02:50.289
 Like treating the dam as a huge battery 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:53.504
 Meaning when the sun is out and when the wind is blowing 

00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:56.480
 The motor will hit the water for storage 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.990
 When you need electricity, the water is sent to the turbine generator set 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.859
 When it comes to wildlife, it seems less worrying 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.980
 Domestic cats kill billions of birds every year 

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:14.055
 Compared to only hundreds of thousands of birds died due to fans 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.500
 I was thinking 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.450
 In large-scale solar and wind power generation 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.720
 Most of those problems can be solved with future advanced technology 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.979
 But a few years have passed 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.604
 These problems still exist and are getting worse 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.070
 California is very committed to the development of renewable energy 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.729
 But in the plan to transform the dam into a large battery 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.189
 Not many completed 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.630
 Some are just geographical issues 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.901
 The dam must have qualified terrain to be transformed 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:46.280
 Even if it meets the conditions 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.019
 Still need a lot of money to achieve 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.571
 Not to mention that there are other issues like the demand for water, such as irrigation 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.083
 Perhaps the most serious problem is 

00:03:56.083 --> 00:04:00.643
 California river and reservoir water 

00:04:00.643 --> 00:04:05.007
 Because of climate change, it is more and more scarce and unstable 

00:04:05.007 --> 00:04:09.610
 In order not to let stability affect the overall power generation system 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.130
 We must stop the electricity generated by the solar power plant from being delivered to the city 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.470
 Because there are so many now 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.039
 Or spend money asking neighboring states like Arizona to consume our excess solar power 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.529
 Otherwise, the power grid will be overloaded and unable to supply power 

00:04:25.649 --> 00:04:30.451
 Speaking of birds and domestic cats 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.180
 Cats don’t hurt eagles, but eagles kill cats 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.750
 Cats kill small, common sparrows, crows, and robin 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:44.700
 These birds are not likely to become extinct 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.112
 Eagles and large birds 

00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:51.185
 Like toothed eagles, owls and vultures and other threatened and endangered species 

00:04:51.185 --> 00:04:54.980
 Are the birds killed by wind turbines 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.705
 Wind turbines are one of the biggest threats to these large birds 

00:04:59.705 --> 00:05:03.740
 Before setting up wind turbines in recent years 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.159
 We have never put so many things on the sky 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.430
 And when it comes to solar 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.550
 Building a solar power plant is like building a farm 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.380
 Large areas must be freed to remove wild animals 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.927
 This is one of the largest solar power plants in California 

00:05:21.927 --> 00:05:23.195
 Ivanpa Solar Power Plant 

00:05:23.195 --> 00:05:24.370
 To build this power plant 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.351
 They must clear the desert tortoise from the entire area 

00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:31.660
 Directly drag desert tortoises and small tortoises out of their caves 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.470
 Put it in a truck and transport it to captivity 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.490
 Many died there 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.083
 Recently it is estimated that about 6,000 birds are killed each year 

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:44.465
 They caught fire above the solar power plant 

00:05:44.465 --> 00:05:46.150
 Fall to the ground 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.620
 Over time, I gradually realized 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.150
 Any technological development 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:57.860
 It is impossible to let the sun shine steadily and let the wind blow continuously 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:00.760
 You can only make solar panels cheaper 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.680
 You can only make the fan bigger 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.080
 And sunlight and wind are just so inefficient 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.080
 And in order to produce enough electricity 

00:06:09.434 --> 00:06:12.820
 You have to use a large area of ​​land 

00:06:13.112 --> 00:06:18.340
 In other words, the main problems of renewable energy are not technical 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:19.560
 Is in the natural environment 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.350
 To deal with these unstable problems 

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.990
 And the huge impact of these environments 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.560
 Obviously, there is a big economic cost 

00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.970
 We have heard too much in recent years 

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:31.970
 News of solar panels and wind turbine prices falling 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.130
 But all the unstable power generation systems should be integrated into the grid 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.807
 The cost is still considerable 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.620
 It can be seen from the situation in California 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.751
 At a time when the prices of solar panels and wind turbines have fallen sharply 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:52.650
 What we are seeing is that the price of electricity has risen 5 times more than other parts of the country 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.169
 This is not our problem 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:56.640
 You can see the same situation happening in Germany 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.030
 Germany is the world leader in solar energy, wind power and other renewable energy technologies 

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:05.562
 After vigorously promoting renewable energy, their electricity prices increased by 50% 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.740
 You might think about fighting climate change 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.470
 We have to spend more on energy 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.390
 I used to think so 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.455
 But look at the French example 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.930
 In terms of clean zero-emission power generation 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.214
 France is twice Germany 

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:27.030
 But the electricity price is almost half of Germany 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.820
 How is this done? 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.960
 You may have guessed the answer 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:36.072
 75% of France’s electricity comes from nuclear energy 

00:07:36.072 --> 00:07:38.760
 Nuclear energy is much more reliable than renewable energy 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.810
 And generate electricity 24 hours a day, 7 days a week 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.050
 90% of the year is running 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.320
 We see this phenomenon happening all over the world 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.330
 for example 

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:52.270
 There is a 40-year natural experiment research 

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:55.719
 Compare the use of nuclear and solar energy 

00:07:56.109 --> 00:08:02.520
 Shows that solar and wind power use a slightly higher cost than nuclear energy 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.619
 But the power generation is only half of nuclear energy 

00:08:05.209 --> 00:08:08.500
 This means how should we go on? 

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:11.980
 I think the most significant findings so far are: 

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:17.037
 If Germany had spent 580 billion dollars on nuclear energy development instead of renewable energy 

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:22.429
 Now they have 100% electricity and all transportation energy 

00:08:22.429 --> 00:08:25.119
 Will be clean energy 

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:28.869
 You may ask a very reasonable question: 

00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:32.199
 Is nuclear energy safe? How do you dispose of nuclear waste? 

00:08:32.199 --> 00:08:34.259
 These are very reasonable questions 

00:08:34.259 --> 00:08:38.320
 Here is the result of more than 40 years of scientific research 

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:40.060
 The latest study 

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:43.240
 Is carried out by the British authoritative medical journal "Needle" 

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.790
 They found that nuclear energy is the safest 

00:08:45.790 --> 00:08:47.390
 It's not difficult to understand 

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.450
 World Health Organization 

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.920
 About 7 million people die from air pollution a year 

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.720
 Nuclear energy does not cause air pollution 

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.350
 Climate scientist James Hansen calculated 

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:02.760
 So far, nuclear energy has saved nearly two million lives 

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.850
 Even wind power is more deadly than nuclear power 

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:11.500
 In this picture are two maintenance workers in the Netherlands 

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:15.160
 Shortly after the picture was taken, one of them fell and died in order to avoid the fire 

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.540
 The other one was swallowed by the fire 

00:09:18.041 --> 00:09:20.120
 What is the impact on the environment? 

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:22.128
 I think there is a very simple way to understand 

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:25.510
 Uranium is the energy source for nuclear power plants 

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.300
 Its energy density is very high 

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:31.976
 Uranium the size of this magic cube 

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.119
 To generate all the energy you need in your life 

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.480
 The conclusion is that a large amount of power generation does not require such a large area of ​​land 

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:46.150
 You can use the Ivanpa Solar Power Plant I just mentioned 

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:49.410
 Compare with California’s last nuclear power plant, the Deyabro Canyon Power Plant 

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.050
 In order to produce the same electricity 

00:09:51.060 --> 00:09:55.505
 Solar power plants spend 450 times more land area than nuclear power plants 

00:09:55.505 --> 00:09:59.110
 You need to add 17 solar power plants like Ivanpah 

00:09:59.110 --> 00:10:02.120
 The power generation will be the same as the Deyablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant 

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.901
 In addition, solar energy will reduce the reliability of power generation 

00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:09.090
 What about raw material collection, scrap and material throughput? 

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:11.651
 This has also been fully studied 

00:10:11.651 --> 00:10:12.781
 The results are 

00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:17.530
 Solar panels require 17 times more materials than nuclear power plants 

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.754
 These materials include cement, glass, concrete, metal 

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.972
 All fuel required for nuclear power plants is also included 

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.250
 In the end, after the entire power generation process 

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:31.247
 Not much waste is produced by nuclear power 

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:35.317
 This room can accommodate all the waste produced by the Swiss nuclear power project 

00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.910
 Nuclear waste is the only waste from nuclear power generation 

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.560
 It is safely preserved without additional social costs 

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.420
 Electricity generated by other means 

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.050
 The waste discharged into nature 

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:49.267
 These may be pollutants or solid waste 

00:10:49.621 --> 00:10:51.961
 We thought solar power was clean 

00:10:52.039 --> 00:10:54.462
 But the fact is that we have no plans 

00:10:54.462 --> 00:10:58.330
 To dispose of waste solar panels after 20 or 25 years 

00:10:58.543 --> 00:11:05.387
 Many experts are very worried that solar panels will be combined with electronic waste 

00:11:05.631 --> 00:11:09.656
 Were shipped to poor African or Asian countries for dismantling 

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:14.040
 Staff will be exposed to a large number of hazardous toxic elements 

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.560
 Contains lead, cadmium and chromium 

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.709
 Because they are elements, toxicity will never degrade 

00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:23.810
 I think we all know 

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:27.444
 Nuclear energy is really a very powerful energy source 

00:11:27.626 --> 00:11:31.290
 The sun is scattered and weak 

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:34.760
 That's why we need such a large area 

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.410
 To collect sunlight and wind 

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.390
 In the latest new version of "Blade Runner" science fiction film 

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.020
 The opening is a gloomy post-apocalyptic scene 

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.060
 California's desert is completely covered by solar panels 

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:52.029
 No one will be surprised by this scene 

00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.511
 I think that all this makes us want to ask a disturbing question: 

00:11:55.880 --> 00:12:00.857
 To save the climate, do we have to destroy the environment? 

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.870
 Interestingly, the past few hundred years 

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.460
 Humans actually try to eliminate the so-called high material density fuel 

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.510
 While shifting to high energy density fuel 

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:16.360
 For example, switching from wood and animal dung to coal, oil, natural gas, and uranium 

00:12:16.589 --> 00:12:19.300
 This is a phenomenon since ancient times 

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:24.614
 Some poor countries are gradually phasing out wood and dry manure fuel 

00:12:24.614 --> 00:12:27.760
 Generally speaking, this is a good thing 

00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:31.240
 When you stop using wood as a fuel source 

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:34.830
 The forest has the opportunity to re-grow wild animals to return to nature 

00:12:35.106 --> 00:12:36.960
 When you stop burning wood at home 

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.274
 You don’t need to inhale these toxic gases 

00:12:40.387 --> 00:12:45.190
 When you start to use coal, oil, natural gas and uranium as the main sources of energy 

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.789
 The potential opportunity to completely eliminate air pollution will appear 

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:52.270
 There is a problem with nuclear energy 

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:56.360
 Most people are happy to accept the conversion from polluting energy to clean energy 

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.390
 And conversion from low energy density to high energy density energy 

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:03.440
 Nuclear energy is very unpopular because of many historical factors 

00:13:03.793 --> 00:13:08.590
 As a result, I and many people may have said it in the past 

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.720
 "To address climate change 

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:14.660
 All kinds of clean energy must come in handy. " 

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:17.630
 The problem is that this is not correct 

00:13:17.770 --> 00:13:20.300
 remember? I mentioned France earlier 

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.990
 France uses nuclear energy to get most of its electricity 

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:26.949
 If France increases the scale of solar and wind power 

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:31.662
 They must drastically reduce the amount of nuclear power generated 

00:13:31.864 --> 00:13:37.130
 The reason is that in order to make the grid able to cope with the solar and wind power generation with large variables 

00:13:37.132 --> 00:13:39.439
 They need to use more natural gas 

00:13:39.449 --> 00:13:40.450
 You have to think like this: 

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.670
 The power output of nuclear power plants is difficult to control at any time 

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:48.260
 But the management of the power grid is like controlling the size of the gas fire 

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:50.879
 Can be adjusted at any time 

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.960
 Oil and gas companies certainly understand this 

00:13:55.970 --> 00:14:01.860
 We have all seen them invest millions of dollars in recent years to promote solar and wind power 

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:06.380
 This leads to another challenging problem: 

00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:09.790
 Where a lot of nuclear energy is used 

00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:13.140
 Nuclear and hydropower provide half of the grid’s electricity 

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:16.409
 If you are going to other renewable energy sources such as solar energy or wind power, 

00:14:16.409 --> 00:14:19.200
 Will actually increase carbon emissions 

00:14:19.328 --> 00:14:21.930
 I think the best way is to tell the truth 

00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.310
 This is also what many scientists are doing 

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.220
 I mentioned earlier 

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:29.180
 Hundreds of thousands of birds die every year due to fans 

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.220
 What I didn’t mention is that at least one million bats are killed by fans every year 

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:38.121
 Many bat researchers have proposed such results 

00:14:38.121 --> 00:14:40.939
 Especially this gray bat 

00:14:40.939 --> 00:14:43.019
 It is a migratory bat 

00:14:43.019 --> 00:14:45.679
 Because those wind turbines that are constantly expanding 

00:14:45.679 --> 00:14:48.170
 Is facing a crisis of extinction 

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:51.360
 Not just wind, but also solar 

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.229
 Scientists who were involved in the construction of Ivanpa Solar Power Plant 

00:14:55.229 --> 00:14:58.779
 And the people who prepared the site early 

00:14:58.779 --> 00:15:00.280
 Some of them wrote: 

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:04.269
 "Everyone knows that it is impossible to find a new home for the desert tortoise 

00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:06.409
 When you walk in front of the bulldozer 

00:15:06.409 --> 00:15:09.350
 When crying and clearing the animals and cacti 

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:12.049
 You can hardly agree with this plan. " 

00:15:12.289 --> 00:15:16.840
 And now we can see these phenomena all over the world 

00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.580
 In my hometown california 

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.779
 We buried a lot of natural gas on the side of the mountain 

00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:24.440
 To compensate for unstable solar and wind power 

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:25.570
 But an air leak happened 

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:28.300
 The leaked natural gas is equivalent to the exhaust gas emitted by 500,000 vehicles during their lifetime 

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:29.620
 Recently in Germany 

00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:34.050
 Some protesters try to thwart new coal mining plans 

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:38.020
 This will destroy the ancient forest of Hambach 

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.120
 Just to get more coal mines 

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.424
 All this is to scrap nuclear and expand solar and wind power 

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:46.585
 The good news is 

00:15:46.585 --> 00:15:50.810
 People still care about our natural environment and value these phenomena 

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.770
 Last year in South Korea 

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:55.570
 Civic jury to weigh the weight of these different issues 

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:57.290
 Considered for several months 

00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:00.420
 They must decide whether to abolish nuclear 

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.521
 Still have to continue to use and expand the scale 

00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:06.080
 At the beginning, 40% of them supported the expansion of nuclear energy 

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:08.620
 After several months of consideration and evaluation 

00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:11.890
 60% of the votes of the final vote supporters 

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.770
 Just last week, the same phenomenon happened in Arizona 

00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:16.700
 Voters referendum 

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.640
 To decide whether to continue to use nuclear energy 

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:23.500
 Or replace nuclear energy with natural gas and solar energy 

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.160
 The result refused to scrap the nuclear and won 70 to 30 

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:31.900
 And in Europe, we see the Netherlands as one of the first countries to act 

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.560
 They announced last week 

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.006
 To begin to increase the proportion of nuclear power generation 

00:16:39.006 --> 00:16:44.700
 Because they realized they couldn’t get enough energy from solar and wind 

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:46.280
 To achieve the promised carbon reduction goal 

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:52.700
 We are more and more concerned about environmental issues like climate change 

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:56.740
 I would like to make human civilization and the natural environment coexist with renewable energy 

00:16:56.740 --> 00:17:01.550
 It is a natural tendency to solve problems in this romantic way 

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:05.416
 But I think the facts are in front of me 

00:17:05.416 --> 00:17:09.520
 Many people began to question past beliefs and changed their minds 

00:17:09.975 --> 00:17:12.053
 For me, the question now is 

00:17:12.551 --> 00:17:16.449
 Now that we know that renewable energy cannot save the planet 

00:17:16.459 --> 00:17:19.273
 Should we continue to torture her like this? 

00:17:19.273 --> 00:17:20.640
 Thank you 

00:17:20.776 --> 00:17:22.496
 (applause)
