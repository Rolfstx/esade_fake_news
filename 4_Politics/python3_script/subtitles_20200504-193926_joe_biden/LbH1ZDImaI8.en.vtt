00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.330
- Hi it's me, Tim Dodd,
the Everyday Astronaut.

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.050
I'm here at SpaceX's
brand new launch facility

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.234
in Boca Chica, Texas

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:10.010
to check out the holy
grail of rocket engines

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.150
and that SpaceX's upcoming Raptor engine.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.730
An engine like this has
never actually been used

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.760
on a rocket before.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.580
Now this is a methane powered full flow

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.020
staged combustion cycle engine.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.290
Talking about a rocket
engine that's this complex

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.990
can be really intimidating.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.487
And in order to put it into
context against other engines

00:00:28.487 --> 00:00:30.140
and other engine cycles

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.330
we're gonna do a full
comparison of the Raptor engine

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.570
versus a bunch of other engines

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.460
including SpaceX's current workhorse

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.010
the Merlin engine against the RS-25,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.970
the space shuttle main engine.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.380
the F-1 engine that powered the Saturn 5.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.740
The RD-180

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.290
and Blue Origin's BE-4
that also runs on methane.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.990
And as if the full flow
of staged combustion cycle

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.230
wasn't enough, SpaceX is also
doing something else unique.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.400
They're powering that
thing with liquid methane

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.380
and that's something that's
actually never been done

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.110
on an orbital class rocket.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.055
So we're gonna take a look at
the characteristics of methane

00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:01.435
and see if we can figure out

00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:03.833
why SpaceX chose methane

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:06.260
instead of any other common propellant.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.140
Now this engine isn't
really the best at anything.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.730
It's not the most powerful.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.870
It's not the highest thrust
to weight ratio of any engine.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.630
It's not even the most efficient

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.540
but it does a lot of
things really really well.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.880
So by the end of this video

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.580
hopefully we have all
the context understand

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.260
why the Raptor engine is special

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.970
how it compares to other rockets

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.860
why it's using liquid methane

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.180
and then hopefully we'll
know if it really is

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.920
the king of rocket engines.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:31.753
Let's get started.

00:01:31.753 --> 00:01:32.586
(electronic music)

00:01:32.586 --> 00:01:37.585
- [Voice over] Three, two,
one, blastoff. (mumbles)

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.220
- In case you didn't notice
when you clicked on this video,

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.624
this is a very, very long video.

00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:50.670
Sorry, not sorry,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.900
but if you're anything like me

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.460
you keep hearing a lot of
hype about the Raptor engine

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.020
and you want to appreciate it

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.270
but you don't even know where to start.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.880
Well, I've spent quite a
while really studying up

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.280
on the subject so I can
lay down a good foundation

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.030
in order to help us really
truly fully appreciate

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.120
the Raptor engine.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.580
Well, and quite frankly
all rocket engines.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.810
And if you're anything like me

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.890
maybe you've stared at
diagrams like this or like this

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.970
or like this one for hours until

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.970
you feel like your
head's going to explode.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.131
So in order to avoid that

00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:24.080
I've actually whipped up
some really simple versions

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.010
of rocket engine cycles
for all of us to enjoy

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.810
which will hopefully help us
grasp these crazy concepts.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.342
But in case this isn't your first rodeo

00:02:32.342 --> 00:02:33.670
here's the timestamps

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.600
if you want to jump to a certain section.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.760
There's also links in the
description to each section

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.140
as well as an article
version of this entire video

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.450
at my website, Everydayastronaut.com

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.170
in case you want to
study some of the numbers

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.510
a little more in depth

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.810
or see sources of some of the material.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.720
Now we're gonna start off with
a super quick physics lesson

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.820
but bear with me.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.360
We're gonna dive in and get
plenty of nitty gritty details.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.193
Okay.

00:02:55.193 --> 00:02:56.290
Let's start off with this.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.150
Rockets are basically just propellant

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.372
with some skin around
it to keep it in place

00:03:00.372 --> 00:03:02.090
and they have a thing on the back

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.293
that can throw said
propellant really, really fast

00:03:05.293 --> 00:03:07.609
and to way oversimplify it even more,

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.210
the faster you can throw
that propellant the better.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:12.470
Now the easiest way to do this

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.520
is by storing all the
propellant in your tanks

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.190
under really high
pressure then put a valve

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.150
on one end of the tank

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.910
and a propelling nozzle that
accelerates the propellant

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.780
into workable thrust.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:23.710
Done.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.840
No crazy pumps or complicated systems

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.810
just open a valve and let her rip.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.870
This is called a pressure
fed rocket engine

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.420
and there's a few main types:

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.120
cold gas, monoprop and
bipropellant pressure fed engines.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.620
You'll often find these used
in reaction control systems

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.880
because they're simple,
reliable, and they react quickly.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.930
But pressure fed engines
have one big limiting factor.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.652
Pressure always flows from high to low

00:03:47.652 --> 00:03:50.630
so the engine can never be higher pressure

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.860
than the propellant tanks.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.773
In order to store propellant
under high pressure,

00:03:53.773 --> 00:03:55.319
your tanks will need to be strong

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.690
and therefore thicker, and thicker,

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.290
and heavier, and heavier.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.504
Look at composite overwrapped
pressure vessels or COPDs.

00:04:02.504 --> 00:04:06.530
They're capable of storing
gases at almost 10000 PSI

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.560
or 700 bar.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.950
And despite this there's still

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.340
a limited amount of propellant

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.960
and pressure they can store.

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.770
And this does not scale up very well

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.901
when you're trying to
deliver a payload to orbit.

00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:19.030
So smart rocket scientists
quickly realized

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.830
in order to make the rocket
as lightweight as possible

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:24.725
there's really only one
thing they could do:

00:04:24.725 --> 00:04:26.718
increase the enthalpy.

00:04:26.718 --> 00:04:29.158
That would be a great metal band name.

00:04:29.158 --> 00:04:30.600
You're welcome Internet.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.330
Enthalpy is basically the relationship

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.190
between volume pressure and temperature.

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.600
A higher pressure and temperature

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.204
inside the combustion chamber
equals higher efficiency

00:04:39.204 --> 00:04:41.710
and more mass shoved
through the rocket engine

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.040
equals more thrust.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.300
So in order to shove more
propellant into the engine

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.850
you could either increase
the pressure in the tanks

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.470
or just shoot the propellant
into the combustion chamber

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.577
with a really high powered pump.

00:04:52.577 --> 00:04:55.990
The second option sounds
like a pretty good idea.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.720
But pumps moving hundreds
of liters of fuel per second

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.540
require a lot, and boy do I mean,

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.640
a lot of energy to power them.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.220
So what if you took a tiny rocket engine,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.047
and aimed it right a turbine

00:05:08.047 --> 00:05:10.930
to spin it up really, really fast?

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.960
You can exchange some of
the rocket propellant's

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.495
chemical energy for kinetic energy

00:05:15.495 --> 00:05:18.468
which could then be used to
spin these powerful pumps.

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:20.150
Welcome to turbo pumps

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.100
and the staged combustion cycle.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.580
But you've still got some
limiting factors here

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.812
like how high pressure always
wants to go to low pressure

00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:30.723
and how heat has that
habit of melting stuff.

00:05:30.723 --> 00:05:33.490
So you've got to keep
all these things in check

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:35.750
while trying to squeeze every bit of power

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:36.583
out of your engine.

00:05:36.583 --> 00:05:38.450
There's actually a lot
of different variations

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.350
of the cycles that we could talk about

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.330
but I'm going to stick
with the three most common

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.120
or at least the three that matter the most

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.930
when putting the Raptor into context.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.031
We have the gas generator cycle

00:05:47.031 --> 00:05:49.580
the partial flow staged combustion cycle

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.800
and lastly we'll look at

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.320
the full flow staged combustion cycle

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.190
and perhaps in a future video

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.810
I'll try and do a full rundown

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:59.070
of all liquid fueled rocket engines

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.720
including fun new alternatives

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.680
like the electric pump fed engine

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.068
seen on Rocket Lab's Electron rocket.

00:06:05.068 --> 00:06:07.485
(slow music)

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.200
Let's start with the gas generator cycle

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.100
known as the open cycle.

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.730
This is probably one of
the most common types

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.850
of liquid fueled rocket engine
used on orbital rockets.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.270
It's definitely more complicated

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.860
than a pressure fed system
but it's fairly simple,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.160
well at least compared to their
closed cycle counterparts.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.610
Now I'm gonna way, way oversimplify this

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.260
so it's as easy to grasp
as humanly possible.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.990
In real life, there's
literally dozens of valves,

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.090
a hive of wires,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.260
and extra tiny little pipes everywhere,

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.570
helium to back pressure the tanks

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.340
fuel flowing through the nozzle

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.940
and the combustion chamber to cool it

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:47.510
and there is an ignition
source for the preburner

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.670
and the combustion chamber.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.530
But again for the purpose
of making this as simple

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:52.970
and as digestible as possible,

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.180
just know there's a lot of stuff missing

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.370
from these diagrams.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:57.770
But for now we're going to focus

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.000
on the flow of these engines

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.410
so we can grasp that concept first.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:03.500
The gas generator cycle works by pumping

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:05.890
the fuel and oxidizer into
the combustion chamber

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.580
using a turbo pump.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:09.750
The turbo pump has a few main parts

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.220
a mini rocket engine called the preburner,

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.400
a turbine connected to a shaft

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.150
and then a pump or two
that push propellant

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.790
into the combustion chamber.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:20.590
Now you might hear the turbo pump assembly

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.684
called the power pack because it really is

00:07:22.684 --> 00:07:24.710
what powers the engine.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:25.890
In the open cycle system,

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:27.610
the spent propellant from the preburner

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:29.070
is simply dumped overboard

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:31.720
and does not contribute
any significant thrust.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.767
This makes it less
efficient since the fuel

00:07:33.767 --> 00:07:37.940
and oxidizer used to spin the
pumps is basically wasted.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:39.440
Now the funny thing about a turbo pump

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:40.840
is that it kind of has a chicken

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.510
and egg syndrome situation

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.440
that makes it pretty difficult to start up

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.042
since the preburner that
powers the turbo pump

00:07:47.042 --> 00:07:51.200
needs high pressure fuel
and oxidizer to operate.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.600
So the preburner requires
the turbo pumps to spin

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.240
before it can get up to full
operational pressure itself

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:00.330
but the turbo pumps need
the preburner to fire

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:01.813
in order to spin the turbo pumps.

00:08:01.813 --> 00:08:04.960
But the preburner needs
the turbo pumps to ...

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:05.810
Yeah.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.880
You can see where this is going.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.300
This makes starting a gas
generator pretty tricky.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.370
There's a few ways to do this

00:08:10.370 --> 00:08:12.360
but we don't need to get
into all that in this video.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.840
That sounds like a fun topic
for future videos though.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.320
So back to the turbo pumps.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.231
Remember pressure always
flows from high to low

00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:22.210
so the turbo pumps need
to be a higher pressure

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.620
than the chamber pressure.

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.400
And this means the inlets
leading to the preburner

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.300
is actually the highest pressure point

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.110
in the entire rocket engine.

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:32.970
Everything else downstream
is lower pressure

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:34.480
but notice something here.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.310
Take a look at SpaceX's Merlin engine

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:39.102
which runs on RP-1 or rocket propellant 1

00:08:39.102 --> 00:08:40.567
and liquid oxygen.

00:08:40.567 --> 00:08:42.810
Notice how black the smoke is

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.690
coming out of the preburner exhaust.

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.020
Why would it be so sooty

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:47.750
compared to the main combustion chamber

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.923
which leaves almost no visible exhaust?

00:08:49.923 --> 00:08:52.290
Well that's because rocket propellant

00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:54.918
can get super hot like thousands

00:08:54.918 --> 00:08:57.370
and thousands of degrees Celsius.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:08:59.360
So to make sure the
temperature isn't so hot

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:00.580
that it melts the turbine

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.909
and the entire turbo pump assembly,

00:09:01.909 --> 00:09:04.030
they need to make sure it's cool enough

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:05.630
to continually operate.

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:06.830
Running at the perfect fuel

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:08.980
and oxidizer ratio is the most efficient

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.495
and releases the most energy

00:09:10.495 --> 00:09:13.690
but it also produces a
crazy amount of heat.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.330
So in order to keep the temperatures low

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.140
you can run the preburner at
a less than optimal ratio.

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:20.367
So either too much fuel known as fuel rich

00:09:20.367 --> 00:09:23.380
or too much oxidizer or oxygen rich.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:25.680
Running an RP-1 engine fuel rich means

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.040
you'll see some unburned fuel

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.310
appearing as dark clouds of soot.

00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:32.340
the highly pressurized
unburned carbon molecules bond

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.578
and form polymers which is
a process known as coking.

00:09:35.578 --> 00:09:38.320
This soot starts to stick
to everything it touches

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.140
and can block injectors or even do damage

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:42.430
to the turbine itself.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.810
So what if you didn't want to waste

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:45.710
all that highly pressurized propellant?

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.440
I mean after all since it's running cooler

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.550
by being fuel rich doesn't that mean

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.181
there's a bunch of unburned
fuel literally being wasted?

00:09:53.181 --> 00:09:56.200
What if you could just
pipe that hot exhaust gas

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.356
and put it into the combustion chamber?

00:09:58.356 --> 00:10:01.280
Welcome to the closed cycle.

00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.460
The closed cycle or
staged combustion cycle

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.480
increases engine efficiency by using

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.500
what would normally be lost exhausts

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.177
and connects it to the combustion chamber

00:10:09.177 --> 00:10:10.720
to help increase pressure

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.600
and also increase efficiency.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.780
So let's take the Merlin engine

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:14.908
and try closing the loop.

00:10:14.908 --> 00:10:16.520
Let's take the exhaust

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.856
and just pipe it straight
into the combustion chamber.

00:10:18.856 --> 00:10:21.500
Uh-oh, oh no!

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:24.710
We just put a bunch of soot
and clogged all the injectors.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:27.330
You do not go to space today my friend.

00:10:27.330 --> 00:10:29.420
But there's a few
solutions to this problem

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.280
so let's see how the Soviets solved it.

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.810
The first operational closed
cycle engine they made

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.420
was the NK-15 design for
their N-1 moon rocket.

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:39.760
They later upgraded it to the NK-33

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.880
and then many versions
from there stemmed out

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.520
including the RD-180

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:45.950
which is what is used
on the Atlas 5 today.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:50.366
Since the NK-15 and NK-33
runs on RP-1 like the Merlin

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:52.790
you can't run your preburners fuel rich

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:54.450
because of the coking problem.

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.030
So if you want to create a
closed cycle engine with RP-1,

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.060
the answer is running the
preburner oxygen rich.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.900
Easy as that, right?

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.167
Well now you're blasting superheated

00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:07.648
highly pressurized gaseous oxygen

00:11:07.648 --> 00:11:10.590
which will turn just
about anything into soup

00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:12.280
right at your precision machine

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.280
crazy low tolerance turbine blade.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.710
Doing so is actually considered impossible

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:18.640
by the United States,

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.950
and they basically gave up on trying.

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:23.070
They didn't think a metal alloy existed

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.280
that could withstand these
crazy crazy conditions,

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.690
and they didn't believe the Soviets

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.880
had made such an efficient

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.770
and powerful RP-1-powered engine

00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.230
until after the collapse
of the Soviet Union

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.120
and the US engineers got to see them

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.810
and test them out firsthand.

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:39.210
But the Soviets had indeed
worked their butts off,

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.790
and they had made a special
alloy that can magically

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.660
with science withstand
the crazy conditions

00:11:44.660 --> 00:11:46.540
of an oxygen rich preburner.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.560
With a closed cycle engine,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.800
you don't just use some
fuel and some oxidizer

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.150
and burn that in the
preburner to spin the turbine.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.850
You actually shoot all
of the rich propellant

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:56.860
through the turbine.

00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:58.322
So with an oxygen rich cycle

00:11:58.322 --> 00:12:00.830
all of the oxygen actually
goes through the preburner

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.210
and just the right amount of
fuel goes to the preburner.

00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:06.340
You only need enough to give the turbine

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.787
the right amount of energy
to spin the pumps fast enough

00:12:08.787 --> 00:12:11.050
to get the right pressures
for the preburner

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:12.076
and the combustion chamber

00:12:12.076 --> 00:12:13.661
to make the right amount of power

00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:15.450
to shoot the thing into space.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.130
Just crazy.

00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:19.395
So back to this oxygen rich preburner.

00:12:19.395 --> 00:12:22.810
That now hot gaseous oxygen is forced

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:25.900
into the combustion chamber
where it meets liquid fuel.

00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:27.180
They meet and go boom

00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:29.290
and we get a nice clean and efficient burn

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.040
without really wasting any propellant.

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.890
But still like all engines
the chamber pressure

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.630
can not be higher than the pump pressure

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:40.070
so the pumps actually have a lot of weight

00:12:40.070 --> 00:12:42.500
on their tiny little metal shoulders.

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:43.720
Now if you're sitting there thinking

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.180
that the United States just sat back

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.924
and let the Soviets have
all the closed cycle glory,

00:12:47.924 --> 00:12:49.370
you'd be wrong.

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.620
It took the United States
a little bit longer

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.149
but they eventually figured
out a closed cycle engine.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:57.810
But it was very different
from the oxygen rich cycle.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:00.010
The United States pursued
a closed loop cycle

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.787
but they went with a fuel rich preburner.

00:13:02.787 --> 00:13:06.087
But wait, we just learned
that fuel rich preburners'

00:13:06.087 --> 00:13:08.330
exhaust is so sooty

00:13:08.330 --> 00:13:11.440
that it pretty much ruins anything, right?

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.350
Well sure if you're using RP-1

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:15.227
or any other carbon heavy fuel

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:17.910
that's definitely going to be the outcome.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.850
So the United States went with
a different fuel: hydrogen.

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:23.740
Okay, so now we've avoided the problem

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:26.000
of blasting crazy hot high pressure oxygen

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.769
at anything dear and precious

00:13:27.769 --> 00:13:30.860
but now we've opened
up a new can of worms.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.960
Hydrogen is significantly
less dense than RP-1

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.340
or liquid oxygen.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.070
It's so much less dense,

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:39.856
it takes a huge and
really complex turbo pump

00:13:39.856 --> 00:13:41.990
to flow the right amount of hydrogen

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.280
into the combustion chamber.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.670
Since RP-1 and LOX are
relatively similar in density

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:49.980
and in the ratios they can
be run on a single shaft

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.520
using a single preburner.

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.370
Because of this the
engineers at Rocketdyne

00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.210
pursued an engine known as the RS-25

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.540
which would go on to
power the space shuttle.

00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.580
They realized that because
of the large difference

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.460
between the pumps they might as well have

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:03.721
two different preburners,

00:14:03.721 --> 00:14:05.560
one for the hydrogen pump

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:06.990
and one for the oxygen pump.

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.290
So that's what they did.

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:11.550
But having two separate shafts
created another new problem.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:13.750
Now engineers were putting high pressure

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.060
hot gaseous hydrogen on the same shaft

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.180
right next door to the liquid oxygen pump.

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.881
If some of that hydrogen would
leak out of the preburner

00:14:22.881 --> 00:14:25.620
it would start a fire in the LOX pump

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:28.080
which is catastrophically bad.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.210
Hydrogen is also very hard to contain

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:35.210
because it's so not dense,
un-dense, lightweight

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.780
it likes to sneak through cracks

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.270
and get out anywhere it can.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:40.340
So engineers had to make an elaborate seal

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:42.870
to keep the hot hydrogen
from sneaking out.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:45.470
The seal required for this
is called a purge seal

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:47.740
and it's actually pressurized by helium

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.070
so that it's the highest
point of pressure.

00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.720
So if the seal leaks it
just leaks inert helium.

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.320
It's genius but take a look at

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.160
how different the LOX turbo pump

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.173
and the hydrogen turbo pump seals look.

00:14:59.173 --> 00:15:01.730
You can tell how much
more engineering time

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.183
and effort had to go
into the hydrogen seals.

00:15:04.183 --> 00:15:07.490
I mean the people that think
of this stuff are nuts.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.410
The RS-25 is still considered to be

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:10.498
about the best engine ever made

00:15:10.498 --> 00:15:12.980
with a fairly high thrust to weight ratio

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:14.760
and unmatched efficiency.

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.200
Okay now that we've talked all about

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.500
the dual preburner fuel rich RS-25,

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.560
here's a simplified diagram of that.

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.250
Now I didn't bother making
the fuel pumps different sizes

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.214
and I just want to focus on the flow here

00:15:25.214 --> 00:15:27.880
and help make that as simple as possible.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:32.344
But do note both preburners
of the RS-25 run fuel rich

00:15:32.344 --> 00:15:34.900
so although they might look the same

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.668
they power different pumps

00:15:36.668 --> 00:15:38.376
and I'll just let this
run here for a few seconds

00:15:38.376 --> 00:15:40.410
so you can study it for a bit

00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:43.240
but don't worry we'll also
put all these up on screen

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.340
at the same time once we cover them all.

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:46.900
So the closed cycle improves

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.244
the overall performance of the engine

00:15:48.244 --> 00:15:50.361
and is highly advantageous.

00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:53.350
So how can it get any better than this?

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:55.220
We're finally ready to talk about

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.430
the full flow staged combustion cycle

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.020
which basically just combines
the two cycle methods

00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:01.260
we just talked about.

00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:02.706
With the full flow
staged combustion cycle,

00:16:02.706 --> 00:16:05.670
you take two preburners
one that runs fuel rich

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.130
and one that runs oxygen rich.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.730
The fuel rich preburner
powers the fuel pump

00:16:10.730 --> 00:16:13.960
and the oxygen rich preburner
powers the LOX pump.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.490
This means the full flow
staged combustion cycle

00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.840
needs to tackle the oxygen rich problems

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.014
which again is solved by developing

00:16:21.014 --> 00:16:23.770
very strong metal alloys.

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:26.650
So SpaceX developed their
own super alloys in house

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:28.800
that they named SX500.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.270
According to Elon Musk it's
capable of over 800 bar

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.360
of hot oxygen rich gas.

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.450
That may have been one
of the biggest hurdles

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:37.930
in developing the Raptor engine.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.670
Luckily the fuel rich side only pumps fuel

00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:43.060
so if some of that hot
fuel leaks through the seal

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.616
on the shaft it just comes
in contact with more fuel

00:16:45.616 --> 00:16:48.260
which is kind of no big deal.

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.022
So no need for one of those
really really elaborate seals.

00:16:51.022 --> 00:16:53.730
Full flow likely wouldn't work with RP-1

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:56.640
due to the coking problems
with a fuel rich preburner

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:59.620
but other fuels are still
valid to use this design.

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.140
But more on that in a minute.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:03.940
The advantage of the system
is that since both the fuel

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.170
and the oxidizer arrive
in the combustion chamber

00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.308
as a hot gas there's better combustion

00:17:08.308 --> 00:17:10.610
and hotter temperatures can be achieved.

00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:13.290
There's also less of a need
for that crazy ceiling system

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:14.297
as we mentioned earlier

00:17:14.297 --> 00:17:16.470
and that's definitely a good thing

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:17.880
when you plan to reuse your engine

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.510
over and over with little
to no refurbishment

00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:21.380
between flights.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.384
And lastly because there's an
inherent increase in mass flow

00:17:24.384 --> 00:17:26.140
or how quickly all the propellant

00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:27.710
is shooting into the preburner

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:28.975
the turbines can run cooler

00:17:28.975 --> 00:17:30.850
and at lower pressures

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:33.920
because the ratio of
fuel an oxidizer needed

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.070
to spin the turbo pumps is much lower.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:37.360
And think of it this way

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.650
in an open cycle you only want to use

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.240
as little fuel and oxidizer as possible

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:44.730
in the preburner since it's all wasted

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.003
and you want it to be
as hot as withstandable

00:17:47.003 --> 00:17:48.700
to make it more efficient

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.870
but with the full flow
cycle all of the fuel

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.598
and all of the oxidizer
goes through the preburners

00:17:53.598 --> 00:17:57.820
so you can burn just exactly
as much propellant as necessary

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:59.130
to power the turbo pumps.

00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:02.160
But the cool thing is your
fuel to oxidizer ratios

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.933
will be so crazy fuel rich

00:18:03.933 --> 00:18:06.360
and crazy oxygen rich

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.950
that the temperatures at the
turbines will be much lower

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.360
and this means longer lifespans
for the turbo pump assembly.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.290
It also means more combustion happens

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.780
in the combustion chamber

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.120
and less in the preburner.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.670
Now here's the crazy part.

00:18:18.670 --> 00:18:20.510
Only three engines have demonstrated

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:24.180
the full flow staged
combustion cycle ever.

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:26.220
In the 60s the Soviets developed an engine

00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.260
called the RD-270 which never flew

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.100
and in the early 2000s
Aerojet and Rocketdyne

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:35.080
worked on an integrated
powerhead demonstrator called

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.920
wait for it, the Integrated
Powerhead Demonstrator,

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.700
which again never made
it past the test stand.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.200
And the third attempt to developing

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.440
a full flow staged combustion cycle engine

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.252
is SpaceX's Raptor engine.

00:18:48.252 --> 00:18:50.600
Ta-da, that's right.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.790
The Raptor engine is
only the third attempt

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:54.652
at making this crazy type of engine.

00:18:54.652 --> 00:18:56.970
It's the first to ever do any type of work

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.470
and leave a test stand

00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:59.570
and fingers crossed,

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.600
it'll be the first full flow
staged combustion cycle engine

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:03.625
to reach orbit.

00:19:03.625 --> 00:19:06.260
Well actually just about
anything this engine does

00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:07.150
will be a first.

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:10.330
This means SpaceX had to tackle
some crazy crazy problems.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.560
I mean not only that
same problem that plagues

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:13.866
oxidizer rich cycles

00:19:13.866 --> 00:19:17.082
like having to have a really
really strong metal alloy.

00:19:17.082 --> 00:19:19.073
They also had to learn how to control

00:19:19.073 --> 00:19:20.840
two different preburners

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.390
and two different cycles

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.020
to create the highest pressures

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.210
of any chamber pressure ever.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:29.444
They just beat the RD-180's
record of about 265 bar

00:19:29.444 --> 00:19:31.800
when they hit 270 bar

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.860
and they're not even done.

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:36.656
They're hoping for 300 bar
inside the combustion chamber.

00:19:36.656 --> 00:19:39.710
That's nuts and we'll talk
more about that in a second

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:41.980
but before we move on now
that we've done a rundown

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.520
on all these engines cycle types

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.840
let's put them all up on screen

00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:47.330
and let them run for a bit
so you can watch each one

00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:48.880
and compare them side by side.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:50.380
I know for myself it helps a lot

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:52.120
to see them all together
on the same screen

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:52.953
at the same time.

00:19:52.953 --> 00:19:55.236
(slow music)

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:01.880
Since the Raptor engine can't run

00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.820
a fuel rich preburner using RP-1,

00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.700
you'd think the next most
logical choice would be hydrogen.

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:11.090
Well SpaceX didn't opt for
either RP-1 or hydrogen.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:13.000
They went with liquid methane.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.720
So now we finally have
another topic to touch on.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.650
Why did SpaceX choose liquid methane

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:18.990
for the Raptor engine?

00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:20.850
What are the qualities
that make it advantageous

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.096
over hydrogen or RP-1?

00:20:23.096 --> 00:20:25.929
(dramatic music)

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:32.260
Today no liquid methane

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.220
or otherwise known as methylox engine

00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:35.660
has gone to orbit.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:38.810
So what qualities does it
have that make it desirable?

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:39.940
Let's take a look at methane

00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:42.330
compared to RP-1 and hydrogen.

00:20:42.330 --> 00:20:44.801
Let's put methane in
between RP-1 and hydrogen.

00:20:44.801 --> 00:20:47.050
You'll see why here really quickly.

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:49.670
So let's start off with
perhaps the biggest factor

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:51.500
when designing your first stage,

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.360
the density of the propellant.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.030
Having a denser fuel means
that tanks are smaller

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:58.680
and lighter for a given mass of fuel.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:01.240
A smaller tank equals a lighter rocket.

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:03.350
So here's the density of these three fuels

00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:05.400
measured in grams per liter.

00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:08.680
In other words how much does
one liter of this stuff weigh

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:10.920
or really what's its mass.

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:15.877
Starting off with RP-1, one
liter is around 813 grams.

00:21:15.877 --> 00:21:19.270
RP-1 is 11 times more dense than hydrogen

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:21.900
which is only 70 grams per liter

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:26.030
and methylox is right in the
middle at 422 grams per liter.

00:21:26.030 --> 00:21:27.760
Remember how airships or zeppelins

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.340
used to be filled with hydrogen

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.770
to make them lighter than air?

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:33.110
Well, that's because hydrogen

00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:35.780
is so much less dense in our atmosphere

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.180
it makes for an excellent

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.520
albeit really flammable gas for a balloon.

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:44.010
I mean we all remember
the Hindenburg, right?

00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:46.990
It should also be noted
that 813 grams per liter

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:49.000
is an average for RP-1

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.870
but SpaceX chills their
RP-1 in their Falcon 9

00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:56.010
and Falcon Heavy for about a
2 to 4% increase in density.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:58.200
But historically RP-1's density

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.420
is right around that 813 grams per liter.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.520
So in the case of density

00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:05.210
methane is kind of right in
the middle of the two others

00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:07.440
but there's more to it than just density.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.190
We also need to take into consideration

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:10.992
the ratio of how much fuel is burned

00:22:10.992 --> 00:22:13.640
compared to how much oxidizer is burned.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.950
This is the oxidizer to fuel ratio.

00:22:15.950 --> 00:22:18.120
So here's where things get
a little more interesting

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.640
and the tables turn just a little bit.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.370
Rocket engineers have to take into account

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:23.600
the mass of the fuel

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:25.545
and the corresponding weight of the tanks

00:22:25.545 --> 00:22:27.800
so they don't actually burn propellant

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.978
at the perfect stoichiometric
combustion ratio.

00:22:29.978 --> 00:22:32.430
They find the perfect happy medium

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.450
that balances tank size with thrust output

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.810
and specific impulse.

00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.047
Let's look at the mass ratios for fuel

00:22:38.047 --> 00:22:40.311
and oxidizer that the
engineers have come up with.

00:22:40.311 --> 00:22:44.584
So for these numbers RP-1 is
burned at 2.7 grams of oxygen

00:22:44.584 --> 00:22:46.822
to one gram of RP-one.

00:22:46.822 --> 00:22:50.690
Hydrogen burns at 6 grams of
oxygen to 1 gram of hydrogen

00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:53.980
and methane burns at 3.7 grams of oxygen

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:55.290
to one gram of methane.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.390
These numbers can now help offset a little

00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:59.350
the massive difference in density.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:02.640
So let's visualize this to
help make it easier to digest.

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.955
Liquid oxygen is 1141 grams per liter.

00:23:05.955 --> 00:23:08.590
It's a little more dense than RP-1.

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:12.141
So burning LOX and RP-1
at a 2.7 to one ratio

00:23:12.141 --> 00:23:14.800
for every liter of LOX you'd need

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.530
a little over half a liter of RP-1.

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:18.970
Next up let's do hydrogen.

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:22.750
Now with hydrogen being 11
times less dense than RP-1

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:26.290
you'd think it'd need a
tank that's 11 times bigger.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:29.750
But luckily engineers have
found that it pays to burn LOX

00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.930
and hydrogen at a 6 to 1
ratio for a good compromise.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.720
This means for each liter of LOX

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.030
you'd need 2.7 liters of hydrogen

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.330
so your fuel tank needs
to be approximately

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.020
five times larger compared to RP-1.

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:43.130
So yeah that helps.

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.780
That's why when we look at
a hydrogen powered Delta IV

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.350
versus an RP-1 powered Falcon 9

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.610
you can see the fuel tank is
much smaller than the LOX tank

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.510
on the Falcon 9 but the Delta
IV is about the opposite.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:58.670
The LOX tank is much
smaller than its fuel tank.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:00.430
So now let's take a look at methane.

00:24:00.430 --> 00:24:02.270
And this one gets kind of interesting.

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:05.624
LOX is 2.7 times more
dense than liquid methane

00:24:05.624 --> 00:24:09.127
but the burn ratio is 3.7 grams of oxygen

00:24:09.127 --> 00:24:10.915
to one gram of methane.

00:24:10.915 --> 00:24:15.915
So you need 0.73 liters of
methane for every liter of LOX.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:17.270
In other words your fuel tank

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:20.150
would need to be about
40% bigger for methylox

00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.900
than it would need to be for RP-1

00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.460
despite RP-1 actually
being almost twice as dense

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.090
and compared to hydrogen

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:30.410
its fuel tank would be
about 3.7 times smaller.

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:31.920
So the fuel to oxidizer ratio

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.180
helps make a methane fuel
tank a lot closer to an RP-1

00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:37.470
tank than it is to a hydrogen tank.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.520
Another huge variable
with any rocket engine

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:41.000
is how efficient it is.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.675
This is measured in
specific impulse or ISP

00:24:43.675 --> 00:24:44.790
but you can think of it

00:24:44.790 --> 00:24:48.000
kind of like a fuel economy
of a gas powered car.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.280
So a high specific
impulse would be similar

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.750
to a high mile per gallon
or kilometer per liter.

00:24:52.750 --> 00:24:54.310
The best way to think of specific impulse

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:56.990
is to imagine you had one
kilogram of propellant

00:24:56.990 --> 00:25:00.130
for how many seconds can the engine push

00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:02.590
with 9.8 newtons of force.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:04.144
The longer it can sip on that fuel

00:25:04.144 --> 00:25:06.056
while still pushing that hard

00:25:06.056 --> 00:25:08.440
the higher its specific impulse

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.260
and therefore the more work

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.430
it can do with the same amount of fuel.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.810
So again kind of like its fuel economy.

00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:16.700
So the higher the specific impulse

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.940
the less fuel it takes to
do the same amount of work

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.382
which is a good thing.

00:25:20.382 --> 00:25:23.436
A fuel efficient engine
is extremely important

00:25:23.436 --> 00:25:26.130
and now due to the
molecular way of each fuel

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:28.130
and their energy released when burned

00:25:28.130 --> 00:25:29.550
there's a different potential

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:32.170
for how quickly the
exhaust gas can be expelled

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.400
out the nozzle.

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.820
This means each fuel has

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.010
a different theoretical specific impulse.

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.440
In ideal and perfect world
an RP-1 powered engine

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:42.000
could achieve about 370 seconds.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.636
An ideal hydrogen powered
engine could get 532 seconds

00:25:45.636 --> 00:25:46.895
and guess what?

00:25:46.895 --> 00:25:49.440
A methane powered engine
is right in the middle

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.390
with 459 seconds.

00:25:51.390 --> 00:25:53.760
Real world examples of this are much lower

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.640
with RP-1 engine seeing around 350 seconds

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.960
like the Merlin 1D Vacuum run 380 seconds

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.170
for a methane powered engine

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:03.310
like the Raptor vacuum might be someday

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:06.610
and about 465 seconds for
a hydrogen powered engine

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.580
like the RL-10B-2.

00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:11.616
Next, let's talk about
how hot each fuel burns.

00:26:11.616 --> 00:26:14.260
A fuel that burns cooler
is easier on the engine

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:16.610
and potentially makes
for a longer lifespan.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:19.259
RP-1 can burn up to 3670 Kelvin,

00:26:19.259 --> 00:26:22.340
hydrogen 3070 Kelvin,

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.766
and if you haven't guessed it by now,

00:26:23.766 --> 00:26:28.530
methane is again between
the two at 3550 Kelvin.

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.440
Speaking of thermal considerations

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.790
let's look at the boiling
point for each of these fuels

00:26:32.790 --> 00:26:35.700
or at what point does
the liquid fuel boil off

00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.370
and turn into a gas.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:39.130
Since all of these fuels need to remain

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:41.311
in their liquid state
in order to stay dense

00:26:41.311 --> 00:26:42.980
the higher the temperature

00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:44.850
the easier it is to store the fuel.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:46.880
A higher boiling point also means less

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.513
or even no insulation on the tanks

00:26:48.513 --> 00:26:51.150
to keep the propellant from boiling off.

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:54.685
And of course less insulation
means lighter tanks.

00:26:54.685 --> 00:26:57.288
RB1 has a very high boiling point

00:26:57.288 --> 00:27:01.240
even higher than water at 490 Kelvin.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.210
Hydrogen on the other
hand is near absolute zero

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.300
at a crazy cold 20 Kelvin.

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:10.120
That's insanely cold and it
takes serious consideration

00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.470
to keep anything at that temperature

00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:14.020
and like the Goldilocks it is

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:16.729
methane is between the two at 111 Kelvin

00:27:16.729 --> 00:27:19.560
which although that's still very cold

00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.290
and requires thermal considerations

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:24.680
it at least boils off at a
temperature similar to LOX

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.990
so there is that

00:27:25.990 --> 00:27:28.160
and because it's so close
to the temperature of LOX

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.160
the tanks can share a common dome

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.100
which makes the vehicle lighter.

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.120
LOX and hydrogen's
temperatures very so wildly

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.000
that LOX will boil off hydrogen

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.370
and the hydrogen will freeze LOX solid.

00:27:39.370 --> 00:27:40.980
Now, on to the exhausts.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.700
What are the byproducts of
combustion with these engines?

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.240
RP-1 is really the only one of these three

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.590
that really pollutes
with any unburned carbons

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.940
being left in our atmosphere
alongside with some water vapor

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.030
but hydrogen only produces water vapor

00:27:54.030 --> 00:27:56.220
and methane produces some carbon dioxide

00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:57.420
and water vapor as well.

00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.185
But an interesting note
now believe it or not

00:28:00.185 --> 00:28:01.160
as far as greenhouse gases go,

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.250
water in the upper
atmosphere can be pretty bad

00:28:04.250 --> 00:28:05.820
but I'll be doing a video in the future

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.370
all about how much rockets pollute

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.130
talking about their air pollution,

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:10.680
also their ocean pollution

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.752
and even space debris is a consideration.

00:28:11.752 --> 00:28:15.160
So stand by because I think that video

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:15.993
is going to be awesome.

00:28:15.993 --> 00:28:17.470
Now one metric that we're just kind of

00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:19.240
going to gloss over really quick

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.490
and talk about it generally is the cost.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:23.760
And these tend to vary considerably

00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.460
and it's actually really hard to pin down

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:27.090
the exact prices reliably.

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.690
So for the considerations RP-1

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.782
is basically just a
highly refined jet fuel

00:28:31.782 --> 00:28:34.266
which jet fuel is a
highly refined kerosene

00:28:34.266 --> 00:28:36.713
which kerosene is a highly refined diesel.

00:28:36.713 --> 00:28:39.220
So it's safe to assume it's going to be

00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:40.660
more expensive than diesel.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.470
Hydrogen is also relatively expensive

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:43.889
despite being abundant.

00:28:43.889 --> 00:28:45.410
Refining it storing it

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.340
and transporting it can be hard

00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:50.120
but methane on the other hand
is basically the same thing

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.814
as natural gas and can
be relatively cheap.

00:28:52.814 --> 00:28:55.440
Now when you're talking about
buying literally tons of fuel

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.100
the fuel costs can add up quickly

00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.250
so although the cost of fuel
shouldn't factor in too much

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.570
it certainly is a consideration

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:04.890
but without hard data on this one

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.470
I don't even want to put it on our chart.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.600
So instead let's talk about

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.570
the more important aspect of the fuel

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.670
that's manufacturing it.

00:29:12.670 --> 00:29:14.660
And here's where we get into specifically

00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:16.825
why SpaceX sees methane as an important

00:29:16.825 --> 00:29:20.670
or even a necessary part
of the company's future.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.040
SpaceX's ultimate goals
are to develop a system

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.265
capable of taking humans
out to Mars and back

00:29:25.265 --> 00:29:26.690
over and over.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.780
The Martian atmosphere is CO2 rich.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.090
Now combine that with water
mining from the surface

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:32.654
and subsurface water on Mars

00:29:32.654 --> 00:29:35.515
through electrolysis
and the Sabatier process

00:29:35.515 --> 00:29:38.690
the Martian atmosphere can
be made into methane fuel

00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:40.670
so you don't have to take
all the fuel you need

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:41.776
to get home with you.

00:29:41.776 --> 00:29:45.000
You can make it right there
using Mars's resources.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.967
This is called in situ
resource utilization or ISRU.

00:29:48.967 --> 00:29:50.188
Now you might be thinking,

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:53.290
"Well, if there is water
can't you just make hydrogen

00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:55.822
on the surface of Mars for your fuel?"

00:29:55.822 --> 00:29:57.390
Well, yes but one of the
biggest problems with hydrogen

00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.690
and long duration missions is
the boiling point of hydrogen.

00:30:00.690 --> 00:30:02.870
Remember, it takes serious considerations

00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:05.323
to maintain hydrogen in a liquid state

00:30:05.323 --> 00:30:08.340
and that's necessary
to be useful as a fuel

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:11.770
so for SpaceX methane
makes a lot of sense.

00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:14.080
It's fairly dense meaning the rocket sizes

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.660
are pretty reasonable.

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.890
It's fairly efficient, it burns clean

00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:20.500
and it makes for a highly reusable engine.

00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:21.870
It burns relatively cool

00:30:21.870 --> 00:30:23.690
helping expand the lifespan of an engine

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:26.110
which again is good for usability.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.642
It's cheap and easy to produce

00:30:27.642 --> 00:30:31.106
and can be easily reproduced
on the surface of Mars.

00:30:31.106 --> 00:30:33.523
(slow music)

00:30:43.383 --> 00:30:44.216
Okay.

00:30:44.216 --> 00:30:45.049
Yeah.

00:30:45.049 --> 00:30:47.050
We finally made it this far.

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:48.900
and now that we have a strong grasp

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:50.980
of how different engine cycles operate

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.650
and the fuels they use

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.900
we can finally line
them all up side by side

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.020
and compare their metrics

00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.770
to help us appreciate
where each engine sits.

00:30:58.770 --> 00:31:00.560
So now we're going to lineup each engine

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.570
by their fuel type and their cycles.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:04.160
So let's start off with SpaceX's

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.623
open cycle Merlin engine
that powers their Falcon 9

00:31:06.623 --> 00:31:08.280
and Falcon Heavy rockets.

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.680
NPO Energomash's

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.243
oxygen rich closed cycle RD-180

00:31:12.243 --> 00:31:15.040
that we see power the Atlas 5 rocket

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.584
and Rocketdyne's open cycle F-1

00:31:17.584 --> 00:31:19.330
that powers a Saturn 5

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:22.080
which all three of these
engines run on RP-1.

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.200
Then we have SpaceX's full flow

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.370
staged combustion cycle Raptor engine

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.070
that will power the Starship
and Super Heavy booster

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.440
and then we have Blue
Origin's closed cycle

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.022
oxygen rich methane powered BE-4 engine

00:31:34.022 --> 00:31:36.400
that will power their New Glenn rocket

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.610
and ULA's upcoming Vulcan rocket

00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:41.830
and then we have Aerojet
Rocketdyne's closed cycle

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:45.270
fuel rich RS-25 engine that
powered the space shuttle

00:31:45.270 --> 00:31:47.510
and will power the upcoming SLS rocket

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:48.893
which runs on hydrogen.

00:31:49.994 --> 00:31:50.929
A few quick notes here.

00:31:50.929 --> 00:31:52.840
The Raptor and the BE-4 as
of the making of this video

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.291
are still in development
so the numbers we have here

00:31:55.291 --> 00:31:58.000
are either their current state of progress

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.860
like the Raptor which
is constantly improving

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.260
literally every day

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.516
and in the case of the BE-4,

00:32:03.516 --> 00:32:05.510
those are the target goals for the engine

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.500
which Blue Origin has yet to hit.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.270
So just keep that in
mind that these numbers

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:12.370
are definitely subject to change

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:14.130
and now because of this
don't forget to check in

00:32:14.130 --> 00:32:15.150
with the article version

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.360
attached in the description of this video.

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.962
This video will likely date itself

00:32:18.962 --> 00:32:20.330
with some of these numbers

00:32:20.330 --> 00:32:21.848
and I can't update this video

00:32:21.848 --> 00:32:25.770
but I can update the website
when more info comes through.

00:32:25.770 --> 00:32:29.252
So if you're looking to use any
of these numbers as a source

00:32:29.252 --> 00:32:31.930
please, please, please
double check the website

00:32:31.930 --> 00:32:32.820
for any updates.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:36.335
Another fun note quick
is look at the RD-180.

00:32:36.335 --> 00:32:37.168
Now don't be confused.

00:32:37.168 --> 00:32:38.650
This is a single engine

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:41.210
it just has two combustion chambers.

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:43.200
There's only a single turbo pump

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:46.050
that splits its power into
two combustion chambers.

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.650
The Soviet Union was able to solve

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:50.510
the crazy hot oxygen
rich closed cycle problem

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:53.040
but they were unable to
solve combustion instability

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.250
of large engines.

00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.154
So instead of one large combustion chamber

00:32:56.154 --> 00:32:58.460
they made multiple small ones.

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.293
So first up

00:32:59.293 --> 00:33:01.810
let's take a look at their total
thrust output at sea level.

00:33:01.810 --> 00:33:03.709
Since all these engines run at sea level

00:33:03.709 --> 00:33:06.147
that's probably a fair
place to compare them.

00:33:06.147 --> 00:33:08.218
Let's go from the least amount of thrust

00:33:08.218 --> 00:33:10.560
to the most for fun.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:13.457
The Merlin produces 0.84
meganewtons of thrust.

00:33:13.457 --> 00:33:16.671
The RS-25 produces 1.86 meganewtons.

00:33:16.671 --> 00:33:19.237
The Raptor currently is at 2 meganewtons.

00:33:19.237 --> 00:33:21.837
The BE-4 is hoping to hit 2.4 meganewtons.

00:33:21.837 --> 00:33:25.540
The RD-180 3.83 meganewtons

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.800
and the F-1 is still the king out of these

00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.420
at 6.77 meganewtons.

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.300
Now there was an engine called the RD-170

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:34.950
which actually produced
more thrust than the F-1

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.400
but since it barely flew

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.840
I figured it wasn't as
relevant in this lineup.

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.960
I thought it'd probably a
good idea to go with engines

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.910
that have actually been used a lot.

00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:46.070
Thrust is great but what's
maybe just as important

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:49.330
when designing rocket is
the thrust to weight ratio

00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:51.210
or how heavy the engine is

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.710
compared to how much thrust it produces.

00:33:53.710 --> 00:33:55.339
A higher thrust to weight ratio engine

00:33:55.339 --> 00:33:57.530
ultimately means less dead weight

00:33:57.530 --> 00:33:59.040
the rocket needs to lug around.

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.350
Let's start from the
lowest to highest here.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:06.350
The lowest is actually the
space shuttles RS-25 at 73 to 1.

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:09.461
Then there is the RD-180 which is 78 to 1.

00:34:09.461 --> 00:34:13.090
Then we have the BE-4
at around 80 to 1 but

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:14.720
keep in mind we don't actually have

00:34:14.720 --> 00:34:16.250
a really good number on this.

00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:18.370
So there might be some wiggle room there.

00:34:18.370 --> 00:34:20.970
Then the F-1 is 94 to 1,

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:25.040
then we have the Raptor which
is at about 107 to 1 for now.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.240
And lastly the Merlin is
actually the leader here

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:32.442
with an astonishing 198 to
1 thrust to weight ratio.

00:34:32.442 --> 00:34:35.730
Yeah, that thing is a powerhouse.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:36.563
Okay.

00:34:36.563 --> 00:34:37.396
Thrust is great and all

00:34:37.396 --> 00:34:39.330
but who cares how powerful an engine is

00:34:39.330 --> 00:34:41.250
if it's terribly inefficient.

00:34:41.250 --> 00:34:44.340
So next up let's check
out their specific impulse

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.690
which again is measured in seconds.

00:34:46.690 --> 00:34:48.580
So starting with the
least efficient engine

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:53.191
which is the F-1 engine
at 263 to 304 seconds

00:34:53.191 --> 00:34:57.292
then the Merlin engine
at 282 to 311 seconds.

00:34:57.292 --> 00:35:02.292
Then we get the RD-180 at
311 seconds to 338 seconds

00:35:02.816 --> 00:35:06.680
and somewhere in that
same ballpark is the BE-4

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.760
which is around 310 to 340 seconds.

00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:12.166
Next up is the Raptor engine

00:35:12.166 --> 00:35:16.030
which is 330 seconds
to around 350 seconds,

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:20.621
and lastly the king
here by far is the RS-25

00:35:20.621 --> 00:35:25.621
which is 366 to 452 seconds.

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:27.630
Wow.

00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:30.060
Now one of the factors
that affect both the thrust

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:32.310
and specific impulse is chamber pressure.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:33.390
Now generally

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.760
the higher the chamber
pressure the more thrust

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:39.470
and potentially more
efficient the engine can be

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.540
so higher chamber pressures

00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.230
let an engine be smaller
for a given thrust level

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:46.370
also improving their
thrust to weight ratio.

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.230
The baby here is actually the F-1

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:51.210
which only had 70 bar in
this chamber pressure.

00:35:51.210 --> 00:35:52.900
Now, I do need to pause here for a second

00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:55.910
and remind you that 70
bar is still 70 times

00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:58.700
the atmospheric pressure or
the same amount of pressure

00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:02.740
you'd experience at 700 meters underwater.

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:03.573
Yikes.

00:36:03.573 --> 00:36:05.470
Okay so even the lowest chamber pressure

00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:07.720
is still mind-bogglingly high.

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:09.310
So next up is the Merlin engine

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:14.310
at 97 bar then the BE-4
will be around 135-ish bar

00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:17.675
then the RS-25 which is 206 bar

00:36:17.675 --> 00:36:20.930
then the RD-180 which has been considered

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:24.630
the king of operational
engines at about 257 bar

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:26.260
that is until the Raptor engine

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:27.816
which is now kind of online

00:36:27.816 --> 00:36:30.430
which is considered the new
king of chamber pressure

00:36:30.430 --> 00:36:34.070
at 270 bars currently and
they hope to get that thing

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.382
up to 300 bar.

00:36:35.382 --> 00:36:38.370
Again, 300 bar is like being

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:41.040
three kilometers deep in the ocean.

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.253
I can't even fathom.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.160
Okay, that's enough of the
specs of these engines.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.360
Now, let's look at their
operational considerations

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.530
starting with their approximate cost.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.912
Now again this can be
kind of hard to nail down,

00:36:53.912 --> 00:36:55.840
so these are the best estimates

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.000
that I could come up with.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.910
These numbers do factor in inflation

00:36:58.910 --> 00:37:00.830
to make them all in
today's dollars though.

00:37:00.830 --> 00:37:02.440
Let's go with the most expensive,

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:04.940
and work our way down to
the least expensive engine.

00:37:04.940 --> 00:37:07.680
The most expensive engine
in the lineup is the RS-25

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:11.428
which has a sticker price of
over $50 million per engine.

00:37:11.428 --> 00:37:12.960
Yikes.

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.110
Then we have the F-1 which was
about $30 million per engine

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:20.490
then the RD-180 which is
$25 million per engine

00:37:20.490 --> 00:37:24.150
then the BE-4 which is
around $8 million per engine.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.540
and for the Raptor Elan has mentioned

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.740
he thinks he can produce
the Raptor for cheaper than

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.610
or close to the Merlin engine

00:37:30.610 --> 00:37:32.351
if they can remove a lot of the complexity

00:37:32.351 --> 00:37:34.250
that the current engine has.

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:36.780
So for now we're gonna say $2 million

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.630
is a pretty decent ballpark.

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:39.960
Then we have the Merlin engine

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.860
which is less than a million I think.

00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.700
Okay, well cost is one thing

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.380
but another strong consideration
for the cost of the engine

00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:49.380
is whether or not it's reusable.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:53.625
And here only the RD-180 and
the F-1 were not reusable

00:37:53.625 --> 00:37:55.900
or at least never reused

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:57.808
which is different than
all these other engines

00:37:57.808 --> 00:38:00.760
which will all be reused multiple times.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.000
The RS-25 was reused over and over

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.900
with the record being 19
flights out of a single engine.

00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:09.155
Well then again that's after
a few months of refurbishment.

00:38:09.155 --> 00:38:11.890
The Merlin is hoping
to see up to 10 flights

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:13.220
without major refurbishment.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.860
We know a design goal for
the BE-4 is to be reused

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.120
up to 25 times.

00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:20.050
And I think the Raptor engine hopes to see

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:24.400
up to 50 flights but again
aspirations are one thing.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.770
We'll see how history tweets its claims.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.750
But one quick fun little story here is

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:29.790
don't forget the Merlin engine

00:38:29.790 --> 00:38:31.050
which SpaceX currently uses

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:32.700
on the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.470
are already fired a bunch of times

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.330
before they even make it to the pad.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:39.340
Each engine that is built goes
from Hawthorne, California

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.480
to their test stand at McGregor, Texas,

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.400
where it does a full duration burn

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:45.920
then those engines go back to California

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.640
where they're integrated onto the Octaweb

00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:49.300
which is at the base of the vehicle.

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.860
Then they take the entire stage

00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.420
and they take it back out to McGregor

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:54.340
for a full duration static fire.

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.390
So it goes through the whole
mission basically again.

00:38:57.390 --> 00:38:58.800
Then they ship it to the launch pad

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.400
where does a short static fire

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:01.970
and then it flies the mission.

00:39:01.970 --> 00:39:04.270
So it's already done like three missions

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.690
in duration of firing

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:07.370
by the time it flies for the first time

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:09.870
so I'm not entirely
sure what the most times

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.250
a single engine has done
a full duration burn.

00:39:12.250 --> 00:39:14.610
We know that some of the
cores were set out on the pad

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:17.200
and fired for a really
really really long time

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.360
multiple times over and over

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.380
so I think they've probably
done almost 10 flight

00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:24.168
full duration burns
out of a single engine.

00:39:24.168 --> 00:39:26.570
But you know I have no doubt

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:27.750
they can probably do that if they say.

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.190
I mean they have more experience in this

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:30.480
than anybody already

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.970
reusing engines without
really refurbishing them.

00:39:32.970 --> 00:39:35.990
So I'm gonna definitely
take their word for it.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.980
On the topic of price

00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.150
there's actually some things here

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.480
that start to get really interesting

00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.990
when we start looking at these numbers.

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.340
The first is an interesting metric

00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:44.943
that Elan talked about once
in a tweet in February of 2019

00:39:44.943 --> 00:39:47.628
saying they hope to make
the Raptor get better

00:39:47.628 --> 00:39:49.986
at their thrust to dollar ratio.

00:39:49.986 --> 00:39:52.130
Now this is a really interesting concept

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:53.100
when you think about it.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.810
Who cares how much an engine costs

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.414
if one big engine is cheaper
than two smaller ones

00:39:57.414 --> 00:39:59.650
for the same thrust or vice versa.

00:39:59.650 --> 00:40:01.960
So let's actually take a look

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.840
at the dollar to kilonewton
ratio of these engines.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.060
Starting with the most expensive

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.600
dollar to kilonewton
engine which is the RS-25

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:13.490
at a crazy $26,881 to kilonewton of thrust

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:18.490
then the RD-180 which is
$6527 to one kilonewton

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:24.170
followed by the F-1 at
$4431 per kilonewton

00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:29.080
and then we get to the BE-4 which is $3333

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.040
to one kilonewton,

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.180
the Merlin engine at $1170 per kilonewton

00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:36.640
and the Raptor at around
$1000 per kilonewton

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:39.220
but now we can go even
another step further

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.900
since we know their
dollar to kilonewton ratio

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.210
but we also know their
reusability potential.

00:40:45.210 --> 00:40:46.150
Now we can predict

00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:48.863
their potential costs
per kilonewton per flight

00:40:48.863 --> 00:40:51.160
which changes based on how reusable

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:52.640
these engines actually are.

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.897
For start the RD-180

00:40:53.897 --> 00:40:55.820
and the F-1 aren't reusable.

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:57.400
Their price stays the same

00:40:57.400 --> 00:40:58.470
but for the rest of the engines,

00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.310
if we take into account how many flights

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:01.923
they have/will have

00:41:01.923 --> 00:41:05.183
now we start to see the
RS-25 reusability pay off

00:41:05.183 --> 00:41:08.810
and kind of close the gap
bringing its potential cost

00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:13.243
down to just $1414 per
kilonewton per flight.

00:41:13.243 --> 00:41:15.490
But here's where things get crazy.

00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:19.250
Blue Origin's BE-4 has potential
to truly be game changing

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:23.621
at around $133 per
kilonewton over 25 flights

00:41:23.621 --> 00:41:26.010
which could make it
about as cheap to operate

00:41:26.010 --> 00:41:30.160
as the Merlin at $117 per
kilonewton per flight.

00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:33.150
But if the Raptor engine
truly lives up to its hype

00:41:33.150 --> 00:41:34.470
it could bring this number

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:38.395
all the way down to $20 dollars
per kilonewton per flight.

00:41:38.395 --> 00:41:41.760
Now that is absolutely game changing.

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.810
Sure, money and reuseability
is a 21st focus for spaceflight

00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:48.642
but whatever happened to
good old proven reliability?

00:41:48.642 --> 00:41:52.270
For this let's first look at
how many operational flights

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:53.550
each engine has had.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:55.800
Now at the moment of shooting
this video the Raptor

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:58.487
and BE-4 haven't seen
any operational flights

00:41:58.487 --> 00:42:01.560
although the Raptor is starting
to leave the test stand

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.820
and is being used on test
vehicles like the Starhopper.

00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:08.340
But for now, neither engine
has a real flight record.

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.770
So let's look at the other engines.

00:42:09.770 --> 00:42:13.410
First we have the F-1 engine
which was used on 17 flights.

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:16.490
Next up is the Merlin engine
which is at 71 flights

00:42:16.490 --> 00:42:18.860
and catching up quickly to the RD-180

00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:20.740
which is at 79 flights

00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:23.040
but the king out of these was the RS-25

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:25.530
which saw 135 flights.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:28.840
Now lastly, how about
reliability and service?

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.300
Between the number of
flights and this number

00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:32.530
we can get a pretty good sense

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:34.932
of how truly reliable an engine is.

00:42:34.932 --> 00:42:37.670
This number is really
hard to just pin down

00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:40.410
since some of the engines
may have shut down early

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:42.700
but the mission was still a
success on a few of these.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:45.780
So take a few of these
with a grain of salt.

00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:48.680
Again the BE-4 and Raptor
engine haven't flown yet.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:50.794
So those numbers are unavailable.

00:42:50.794 --> 00:42:52.970
Then we have the space shuttle main engine

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:56.201
which is over 99.5% reliable

00:42:56.201 --> 00:42:58.010
but that gets hard to define

00:42:58.010 --> 00:43:00.305
when an engine doesn't fully shut down.

00:43:00.305 --> 00:43:04.047
And then we have the
Merlin at 99.9% reliable.

00:43:04.047 --> 00:43:06.440
It sure helps when you have 10 engines

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.800
on each flight of the vehicle

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:10.600
and with only one engine ever failing

00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.250
early on in its career,

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.951
and despite that that
mission was still a success.

00:43:14.951 --> 00:43:17.613
The Merlin is a very reliable engine.

00:43:17.613 --> 00:43:20.640
Now to end this technically the RD-180

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.494
and the F-1 are 100% reliable

00:43:23.494 --> 00:43:27.070
but with the F-1 never
having shut down at all

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.324
in any flight, it gets the bold here.

00:43:29.324 --> 00:43:32.789
And depending on how you
define success and reliability

00:43:32.789 --> 00:43:37.789
technically the RD-180 is
only kind of 100% reliable

00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.370
because it got really lucky ones.

00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:42.960
One time it shut down six seconds early

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.710
on an Atlas 5 mission in 2016.

00:43:45.710 --> 00:43:47.680
This was due to a faulty valve

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.730
but the mission went on to be a success

00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:52.960
because of some pure luck
with the center upper stage

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.810
having enough spare Delta V

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.070
to carry out the mission.

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:58.962
Had that valve failed
even a second earlier

00:43:58.962 --> 00:44:01.809
that mission would have failed.

00:44:01.809 --> 00:44:04.559
(dramatic music)

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:10.160
Seeing all these numbers
and considerations,

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:12.590
it makes you realize
just how many variables

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:14.580
go into designing a rocket.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:16.180
Change any one little thing

00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:18.160
and it can have this massive ripple effect

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.740
on the entire design

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.840
and the implementation of
the vehicle as a whole.

00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:23.570
So let's go back over all of this.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:25.860
Now that we know all
the cycles, the fuels,

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.610
the aspirations of SpaceX
to see if we can figure out

00:44:28.610 --> 00:44:30.860
why the Raptor engine exists

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.020
and figure out if it's
worth all the effort.

00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:35.510
Let's look at SpaceX's ultimate plan.

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:38.380
Make a rapidly and fully reusable vehicle

00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:40.250
capable of sending humans to the Moon

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:42.130
and Mars as inexpensively

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:43.543
and routinely as possible.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.865
Not exactly your everyday
goal for a rocket, huh?

00:44:46.865 --> 00:44:48.520
In order to be rapidly

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.210
and fully reusable the
engine needs to run clean

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:54.291
and require low maintenance
with simple turbo pump seals

00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:56.932
and low preburner temperatures.

00:44:56.932 --> 00:45:01.080
A methane fueled full flow
staged combustion cycle engine

00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.250
sounds like a good fit.

00:45:02.250 --> 00:45:04.000
For reliability, redundancy,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.010
and scale of manufacturing considerations

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:08.930
it makes sense to employ a lot of engines.

00:45:08.930 --> 00:45:10.680
In order to scale an engine down

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.470
but maintain a high output

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:14.433
chamber pressure needs to be high.

00:45:15.330 --> 00:45:17.620
Sounds like a methane fueled full flow

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:19.220
staged combustion cycle engine

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.160
is a good fit.

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.510
For interplanetary trips

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:22.760
methane makes the most sense

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.880
because its boiling point makes it usable

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.730
on long duration trips to Mars

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:27.900
which guess what?

00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:29.670
You can produce methane on Mars.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:33.710
So for interplanetary trips
a methane fueled full flow

00:45:33.710 --> 00:45:36.520
staged combustion cycle
engine sounds like a good fit.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.990
Methane is fairly dense

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.060
meaning the tank size remains reasonable.

00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:42.240
Which again is good for
interplanetary trips

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:45.510
not needing to lug around
a lot of dead weight

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:48.641
making a methane fueled full
flow staged combustion cycle

00:45:48.641 --> 00:45:50.320
a pretty good fit.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:52.871
Okay so let's bring this
all back around now.

00:45:52.871 --> 00:45:57.300
Is the Raptor engine really
the king of rocket engines?

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.040
Well rocket science like all things

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.219
is a complex series of compromises.

00:46:02.219 --> 00:46:04.329
Is it the most efficient engine?

00:46:04.329 --> 00:46:05.640
No.

00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:07.730
Is it the most powerful engine?

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:08.563
No.

00:46:08.563 --> 00:46:09.630
Is it the cheapest engine?

00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:10.700
Probably not.

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.480
Is it the most reusable engine?

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:13.313
Maybe.

00:46:13.313 --> 00:46:15.560
But does it do everything really well?

00:46:15.560 --> 00:46:18.340
Yeah it is truly a Goldilocks engine

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:21.520
doing everything it needs
to do very very well.

00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:24.990
It is the perfect fit for
your interplanetary spaceship

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:26.424
and despite its complexity

00:46:26.424 --> 00:46:29.600
SpaceX is developing this
engine at a rapid pace.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:31.790
I mean knowing how much
tweaking SpaceX did

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:33.800
to their Merlin engine over a decade,

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:36.193
we're just at the infancy
of the Raptor engine.

00:46:36.193 --> 00:46:38.420
It's only gonna get
better from here on out,

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:40.320
which is crazy.

00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:42.410
So all in all the Raptor engine

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:45.380
is the king of this application.

00:46:45.380 --> 00:46:48.140
It's a fantastic engine
to fulfill SpaceX's goals

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:49.740
for their starship vehicle.

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:52.119
Would it be the king
of other applications?

00:46:52.119 --> 00:46:54.160
Maybe, maybe not.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.730
And only that decision for the

00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:58.080
rocket scientists and
engineers who get to make

00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.360
all those crazy decisions
every single day.

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.610
So what do you think?

00:47:01.610 --> 00:47:03.010
Is it worth all this hassle

00:47:03.010 --> 00:47:05.142
to develop such a crazy
and complex engine?

00:47:05.142 --> 00:47:07.946
Is this just the beginning
for the Raptor engine?

00:47:07.946 --> 00:47:09.248
And most importantly,

00:47:09.248 --> 00:47:12.948
is the Raptor engine really
the king of rocket engines?

00:47:12.948 --> 00:47:15.140
Let me know your thoughts
in the comments below.

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:16.530
Okay I know I say this every video,

00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:18.410
but I honestly could
not have done this video

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:20.237
without the help of my Patreon supporters.

00:47:20.237 --> 00:47:23.550
They not only kept me sane
for the past five months

00:47:23.550 --> 00:47:24.383
as I worked on this video

00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:26.262
but they also went over
all the data with me.

00:47:26.262 --> 00:47:28.190
They give me great feedback

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:29.926
and suggestions in the
edits of this video.

00:47:29.926 --> 00:47:32.460
I you want to help support what I do

00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.210

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:35.610
or help scripting research

00:47:35.610 --> 00:47:36.500
or if you just want to hang out

00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:37.333
and talk space

00:47:37.333 --> 00:47:39.120

Thank you guys.

00:47:46.053 --> 00:47:47.670
Seriously, I couldn't have made this video

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:48.503
without you.

00:47:48.503 --> 00:47:49.336
And while you're online,

00:47:49.336 --> 00:47:50.470
be sure and check out my web store.

00:47:50.470 --> 00:47:52.210
Seriously, I have really cool things

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:53.399
like these F-1 T-shirts,

00:47:53.399 --> 00:47:55.022
tons of other shirts.

00:47:55.022 --> 00:47:56.770
There's lots of new merchandise

00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:58.180
popping up in there all the time

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.500
so check back often.

00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:00.333
We have things like

00:48:00.333 --> 00:48:01.360
grid fin not-a-coasters

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.405
and hats and shirts and mugs and prints,

00:48:03.405 --> 00:48:06.390
just literally tons of cool rocket stuff.

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:07.690
So if that's your type of thing,

00:48:07.690 --> 00:48:08.816
be sure and check out my web store

00:48:08.816 --> 00:48:10.850
everydayastronaut.com/shop

00:48:10.850 --> 00:48:12.230
and then click on the music tab

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:13.720
if you want to check out any of the songs

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:14.580
used in this video.

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.463
It's all music that I've
written over the years

00:48:16.463 --> 00:48:19.103
(mumbles) Apple, iTunes and Spotify

00:48:19.103 --> 00:48:20.889
and Google Music, all that stuff,

00:48:20.889 --> 00:48:23.411
and also there's a playlist
right here on YouTube

00:48:23.411 --> 00:48:25.700
for music video versions
of it too as well,

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:27.643
which is a fun way to watch and listen.

00:48:27.643 --> 00:48:28.984
So show it to a friend.

00:48:28.984 --> 00:48:30.410
Thanks everybody.

00:48:30.410 --> 00:48:31.370
That's gonna do it for me.

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:33.200
I'm Tim Dodd, the Everyday Astronaut

00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.916
bringing space down to
earth for everyday people.

00:48:34.916 --> 00:48:37.333
