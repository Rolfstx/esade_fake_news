00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:40.430
President Faust, Board of Overseers, faculty,
alumni, friends, proud parents, members of

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:55.360
the ad board, and graduates of the greatest
university in the world,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.660
I'm honored to be with you today because,
let's face it, you accomplished something

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.190
I never could.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.830
If I get through this speech, it'll be the
first time I actually finish something at

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.260
Harvard.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.570
Class of 2017, congratulations!

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:26.650
I'm an unlikely speaker, not just because
I dropped out, but because we're technically

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.400
in the same generation.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.010
We walked this yard less than a decade apart,
studied the same ideas and slept through the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.870
same Ec10 lectures.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.150
We may have taken different paths to get here,
especially if you came all the way from the

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:49.810
Quad, but today I want to share what I've
learned about our generation and the world

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.830
we're building together.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.500
But first, the last couple of days have brought
back a lot of good memories.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.600
How many of you remember exactly what you
were doing when you got that email telling

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:13.140
you that you got into Harvard?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:20.640
I was playing Civilization and I ran downstairs,
got my dad, and for some reason, his reaction

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.650
was to video me opening the email.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.310
That could have been a really sad video.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.569
I swear getting into Harvard is still the
thing my parents are most proud of me for.

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:52.000
What about 
your first lecture at Harvard?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.689
Mine was Computer Science 121 with the incredible
Harry Lewis.

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:07.389
I was late so I threw on a t-shirt and didn't
realize until afterwards it was inside out

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.609
and backwards with my tag sticking out the
front.

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:19.120
I couldn't figure out why no one would talk
to me -- except one guy, KX Jin, he just went

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.180
with it.

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.290
We ended up doing our problem sets together,
and now he runs a big part of Facebook.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:34.669
And that, Class of 2017, is why you should
be nice to people.

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:44.159
But my best memory from Harvard was meeting
Priscilla.

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:55.200
I had just launched this prank website Facemash,
and the ad board wanted to "see me".

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.349
Everyone thought I was going to get kicked
out.

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.189
My parents came to help me pack.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:07.010
My friends threw me a going away party.

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.099
As luck would have it, Priscilla was at that
party with her friend.

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:16.960
We met in line for the bathroom in the Pfoho
Belltower, and in what must be one of the

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.060
all time romantic lines, I said: "I'm going
to get kicked out in three days, so we need

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:24.100
to go on a date quickly."

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:32.580
Actually, any of you graduating can use that
line.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:41.770
I didn't end up getting kicked out -- I did
that to myself.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.380
Priscilla and I started dating.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:49.930
And, you know, that movie made it seem like
Facemash was so important to creating Facebook.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.590
It wasn't.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:57.680
But without Facemash I wouldn't have met Priscilla,
and she's the most important person in my

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:08.400
life, so you could say it was the most important
thing I built in my time here.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:20.199
We've all started lifelong friendships here,
and some of us even families.

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.540
That's why I'm so grateful to this place.

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.490
Thanks, Harvard.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:34.970
Today I want to talk about purpose.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.680
But I'm not here to give you the standard
commencement about finding your purpose.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.250
We're millennials.

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.830
We'll try to do that instinctively.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:50.229
Instead, I'm here to tell you finding your
purpose isn't enough.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:57.080
The challenge for our generation is creating
a world where everyone has a sense of purpose.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.680
One of my favorite stories is when John F
Kennedy visited the NASA space center, he

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.870
saw a janitor carrying a broom and he walked
over and asked what he was doing.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:14.710
The janitor responded: "Mr. President, I'm
helping put a man on the moon".

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:21.560
Purpose is that sense that we are part of
something bigger than ourselves, that we are

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:26.169
needed, that we have something better ahead
to work for.

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:30.520
Purpose is what creates true happiness.

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.830
You're graduating at a time when this is especially
important.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:43.000
When our parents graduated, purpose reliably
came from your job, your church, your community.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.569
But today, technology and automation are eliminating
many jobs.

00:06:48.569 --> 00:06:51.060
Membership in communities is declining.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:57.990
Many people feel disconnected and depressed,
and are trying to fill a void.

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:03.439
As I've traveled around, I've sat with children
in juvenile detention and opioid addicts,

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:07.479
who told me their lives could have turned
out differently if they just had something

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:12.069
to do, an after school program or somewhere
to go.

00:07:12.069 --> 00:07:15.909
I've met factory workers who know their old
jobs aren't coming back and are trying to

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:17.879
find their place.

00:07:17.879 --> 00:07:25.460
To keep our society moving forward, we have
a generational challenge -- to not only create

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.749
new jobs, but create a renewed sense of purpose.

00:07:30.749 --> 00:07:40.990
I remember the night I launched Facebook from
my little dorm in Kirkland House.

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.930
I went to Noch's with my friend KX.

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:50.870
I remember telling him I was excited to connect
the Harvard community, but one day someone

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:53.620
would connect the whole world.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.409
The thing is, it never even occurred to me
that someone might be us.

00:07:57.409 --> 00:07:58.919
We were just college kids.

00:07:58.919 --> 00:08:00.770
We didn't know anything about that.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.380
There were all these big technology companies
with resources.

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.199
I just assumed one of them would do it.

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:12.300
But this idea was so clear to us -- that all
people want to connect.

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.020
So we just kept moving forward, day by day.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.290
I know a lot of you will have your own stories
just like this.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:28.160
A change in the world that seems so clear
you're sure someone else will do it.

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.430
But they won't.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.440
You will.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:34.909
But it's not enough to have purpose yourself.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:39.140
You have to create a sense of purpose for
others.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.200
I found that out the hard way.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:47.600
You see, my hope was never to build a company,
but to make an impact.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:51.790
And as all these people started joining us,
I just assumed that's what they cared about

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:57.450
too, so I never explained what I hoped we'd
build.

00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:01.510
A couple years in, some big companies wanted
to buy us.

00:09:01.510 --> 00:09:03.130
I didn't want to sell.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:05.980
I wanted to see if we could connect more people.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:11.171
We were building the first News Feed, and
I thought if we could just launch this, it

00:09:11.171 --> 00:09:15.140
could change how we learn about the world.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.840
Nearly everyone else wanted to sell.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.390
Without a sense of higher purpose, this was
the startup dream come true.

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:26.100
It tore our company apart.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:33.290
After one tense argument, an advisor told
me if I didn't agree to sell, I would regret

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.080
the decision for the rest of my life.

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:42.870
Relationships were so frayed that within a
year or so every single person on the management

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:46.830
team was gone.

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:50.760
That was my hardest time leading Facebook.

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.360
I believed in what we were doing, but I felt
alone.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:57.640
And worse, it was my fault.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:05.580
I wondered if I was just wrong, an imposter,
a 22 year-old kid who had no idea how the

00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.580
world worked.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:13.970
Now, years later, I understand that *is* how
things work with no sense of higher purpose.

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:20.820
It's up to us to create it so we can all keep
moving forward together.

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:28.700
Today I want to talk about three ways to create
a world where everyone has a sense of purpose:

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:35.380
by taking on big meaningful projects together,
by redefining equality so everyone has the

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:41.950
freedom to pursue purpose, and by building
community across the world.

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:47.590
First, let's take on big meaningful projects.

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:51.830
Our generation will have to deal with tens
of millions of jobs replaced by automation

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:54.280
like self-driving cars and trucks.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.200
But we have the potential to do so much more
together.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:00.980
Every generation has its defining works.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:06.000
More than 300,000 people worked to put a man
on the moon \'96 including that janitor.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.790
Millions of volunteers immunized children
around the world against polio.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.631
Millions of more people built the Hoover dam
and other great projects.

00:11:12.631 --> 00:11:13.740
These projects didn't just provide purpose
for the people doing those jobs, they gave

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:14.740
our whole country a sense of pride that we
could do great things.

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.140
Now it's our turn to do great things.

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:23.840
I know, you're probably thinking: I don't
know how to build a dam, or get a million

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.180
people involved in anything.

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:33.700
But let me tell you a secret: no one does
when they begin.

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.690
Ideas don't come out fully formed.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:39.880
They only become clear as you work on them.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.410
You just have to get started.

00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:49.070
If I had to understand everything about connecting
people before I began, I never would have

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.870
started Facebook.

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:54.110
Movies and pop culture get this all wrong.

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:58.930
The idea of a single eureka moment is a dangerous
lie.

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:03.430
It makes us feel inadequate since we haven't
had ours.

00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:09.020
It prevents people with seeds of good ideas
from getting started.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:13.640
Oh, you know what else movies get wrong about
innovation?

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:18.800
No one writes math formulas on glass.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.200
That's not a thing.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:28.640
It's good to be idealistic.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.300
But be prepared to be misunderstood.

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.860
Anyone working on a big vision will get called
crazy, even if you end up right.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:44.060
Anyone working on a complex problem will get
blamed for not fully understanding the challenge,

00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:47.090
even though it's impossible to know everything
upfront.

00:12:47.090 --> 00:12:53.020
Anyone taking initiative will get criticized
for moving too fast, because there's always

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:55.890
someone who wants to slow you down.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:13:02.930
In our society, we often don't do big things
because we're so afraid of making mistakes

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.860
that we ignore all the things wrong today
if we do nothing.

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:14.230
The reality is, anything we do will have issues
in the future.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:19.440
But that can't keep us from starting.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.260
So what are we waiting for?

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:25.890
It's time for our generation-defining public
works.

00:13:25.890 --> 00:13:30.240
How about stopping climate change before we
destroy the planet and getting millions of

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:37.000
people involved manufacturing and installing
solar panels?

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.760
How about curing all diseases and asking volunteers
to track their health data and share their

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.450
genomes?

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:53.850
Today we spend 50x more treating people who
are sick than we spend finding cures so people

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:55.270
don't get sick in the first place.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.220
That makes no sense.

00:13:58.220 --> 00:14:00.280
We can fix this.

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:10.820
How about modernizing democracy so everyone
can vote online, and personalizing education

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.520
so everyone can learn?

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:18.040
These achievements are within our reach.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:23.450
Let's do them all in a way that gives everyone
in our society a role.

00:14:23.450 --> 00:14:36.100
Let's do big things, not only to create progress,
but to create purpose.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:41.070
So taking on big meaningful projects is the
first thing we can do to create a world where

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.720
everyone has a sense of purpose.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:54.080
The second is redefining equality to give
everyone the freedom they need to pursue purpose.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.290
Many of our parents had stable jobs throughout
their careers.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:03.520
Now we're all entrepreneurial, whether we're
starting projects or finding or role.

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:05.230
And that's great.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:09.920
Our culture of entrepreneurship is how we
create so much progress.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:17.660
Now, an entrepreneurial culture thrives when
it's easy to try lots of new ideas.

00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:20.050
Facebook wasn't the first thing I built.

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:24.370
I also built games, chat systems, study tools
and music players.

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:25.560
I'm not alone.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.700
JK Rowling got rejected 12 times before publishing
Harry Potter.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:41.320
Even Beyonce had to make hundreds of songs
to get Halo.

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:47.480
The greatest successes come from having the
freedom to fail.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:58.410
But today, we have a level of wealth inequality
that hurts everyone.

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:05.140
When you don't have the freedom to take your
idea and turn it into a historic enterprise,

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:07.670
we all lose.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:14.420
Right now our society is way over-indexed
on rewarding success and we don't do nearly

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:19.180
enough to make it easy for everyone to take
lots of shots.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.720
Let's face it.

00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:26.410
There is something wrong with our system when
I can leave here and make billions of dollars

00:16:26.410 --> 00:16:31.990
in 10 years while millions of students can't
afford to pay off their loans, let alone start

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:36.670
a business.

00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:46.510
Look, I know a lot of entrepreneurs, and I
don't know a single person who gave up on

00:16:46.510 --> 00:16:51.130
starting a business because they might not
make enough money.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:56.510
But I know lots of people who haven't pursued
dreams because they didn't have a cushion

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:04.640
to fall back on if they failed.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:09.170
We all know we don't succeed just by having
a good idea or working hard.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.260
We succeed by being lucky too.

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:19.339
If I had to support my family growing up instead
of having time to code, if I didn't know I'd

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:25.089
be fine if Facebook didn't work out, I wouldn't
be standing here today.

00:17:25.089 --> 00:17:33.070
If we're honest, we all know how much luck
we've had.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:38.470
Every generation expands its definition of
equality.

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:42.450
Previous generations fought for the vote and
civil rights.

00:17:42.450 --> 00:17:46.480
They had the New Deal and Great Society.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:57.660
Now it's our time to define a new social contract
for our generation.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:04.190
We should have a society that measures progress
not just by economic metrics like GDP, but

00:18:04.190 --> 00:18:07.890
by how many of us have a role we find meaningful.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:13.380
We should explore ideas like universal basic
income to give everyone a cushion to try new

00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.770
things.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:22.070
We\'92re going to change jobs many times,
so we need affordable childcare to get to

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:30.020
work and healthcare that aren't tied to one
company.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.700
We're all going to make mistakes, so we need
a society that focuses less on locking us

00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.290
up or stigmatizing us.

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:45.140
And as technology keeps changing, we need
to focus more on continuous education throughout

00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:54.120
our lives.\
And yes, giving everyone the freedom to pursue

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:57.400
purpose isn't free.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.200
People like me should pay for it.

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:06.760
Many of you will do well and you should too.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:16.160
That's why Priscilla and I started the Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative and committed our wealth

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.920
to promoting equal opportunity.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:27.210
These are the values of our generation.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:31.540
It was never a question of if we were going
to do this.

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.570
The only question was when.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:39.270
Millennials are already one of the most charitable
generations in history.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:46.480
In one year, three of four US millennials
made a donation and seven out of ten raised

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.960
money for charity.

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.110
But it's not just about money.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.470
You can also give time.

00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:59.970
I promise you, if you take an hour or two
a week -- that's all it takes to give someone

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.300
a hand, to help them reach their potential.

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:08.580
Maybe you think that's too much time.

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.240
I used to.

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:16.110
When Priscilla graduated from Harvard she
became a teacher, and before she'd do education

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:21.970
work with me, she told me I needed to teach
a class.

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.780
I complained: "Well, I'm kind of busy.

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.890
I'm running this company."

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:35.760
But she insisted, so I taught a middle school
program on entrepreneurship at the local Boys

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.390
and Girls Club.

00:20:40.390 --> 00:20:45.950
I taught them lessons on product development
and marketing, and they taught me what it's

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:54.360
like feeling targeted for your race and having
a family member in prison.

00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:01.760
I shared stories from my time in school, and
they shared their hope of one day going to

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.630
college too.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:11.480
For five years now, I\'92ve been having dinner
with those kids every month.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.710
One of them threw me and Priscilla our first
baby shower.

00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.430
And next year they\'92re going to college.

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:23.620
Every one of them.

00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.960
First in their families.

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.840
We can all make time to give someone a hand.

00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.840
Let's give everyone the freedom to pursue
their purpose -- not only because it's the

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:39.100
right thing to do, but because when more people
can turn their dreams into something great,

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:49.990
we're all better for it.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:53.580
Purpose doesn't only come from work.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:22:00.240
The third way we can create a sense of purpose
for everyone is by building community.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:07.620
And when our generation says "everyone", we
mean everyone in the world.

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:13.950
Quick show of hands: how many of you are from
another country?

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:21.580
Now, how many of you are friends with one
of these folks?

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.809
Now we're talking.

00:22:23.809 --> 00:22:29.900
We have grown up connected.\
In a survey asking millennials around the

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:37.630
world what defines our identity, the most
popular answer wasn't nationality, religion

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.890
or ethnicity, it was "citizen of the world".

00:22:41.890 --> 00:22:44.760
That's a big deal.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.630
Every generation expands the circle of people
we consider "one of us".

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:56.270
For us, it now encompasses the entire world.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:02.320
We understand the great arc of human history
bends towards people coming together in ever

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:08.070
greater numbers -- from tribes to cities to
nations -- to achieve things we couldn't on

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:09.930
our own.

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:14.420
We get that our greatest opportunities are
now global -- we can be the generation that

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.570
ends poverty, that ends disease.

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:24.180
We get that our greatest challenges need global
responses too -- no country can fight climate

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.990
change alone or prevent pandemics.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:34.610
Progress now requires coming together not
just as cities or nations, but also as a global

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:37.500
community.

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.980
But we live in an unstable time.

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:46.290
There are people left behind by globalization
across the world.

00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:51.090
It's hard to care about people in other places
if we don't feel good about our lives here

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.670
at home.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:56.940
There's pressure to turn inwards.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.020
This is the struggle of our time.

00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:06.760
The forces of freedom, openness and global
community against the forces of authoritarianism,

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.900
isolationism and nationalism.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:16.030
Forces for the flow of knowledge, trade and
immigration against those who would slow them

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:18.520
down.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:25.010
This is not a battle of nations, it's a battle
of ideas.

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:32.040
There are people in every country for global
connection and good people against it.

00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.520
This isn't going to be decided at the UN either.

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:42.190
It's going to happen at the local level, when
enough of us feel a sense of purpose and stability

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:47.280
in our own lives that we can open up and start
caring about everyone.

00:24:47.280 --> 00:25:05.250
The best way to do that is to start building
local communities right now.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:27.929
We all get meaning from our communities.

00:25:27.929 --> 00:25:33.420
Whether our communities are houses or sports
teams, churches or music groups, they give

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:39.800
us that sense we are part of something bigger,
that we are not alone; they give us the strength

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.120
to expand our horizons.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:50.520
That's why it's so striking that for decades,
membership in all kinds of groups has declined

00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.500
as much as one-quarter.

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:56.340
That's a lot of people who now need to find
purpose somewhere else.

00:25:56.340 --> 00:26:02.809
But I know we can rebuild our communities
and start new ones because many of you already

00:26:02.809 --> 00:26:05.710
are.

00:26:05.710 --> 00:26:10.559
I met Agnes Igoye, who's graduating today.

00:26:10.559 --> 00:26:15.510
Where are you, Agnes?

00:26:15.510 --> 00:26:24.580
She spent her childhood navigating conflict
zones in Uganda, and now she trains thousands

00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:36.150
of law enforcement officers to keep communities
safe.

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:41.730
I met Kayla Oakley and Niha Jain, graduating
today, too.

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:43.770
Stand up.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:51.300
Kayla and Niha started a non-profit that connects
people suffering from illnesses with people

00:26:51.300 --> 00:27:04.440
in their communities willing to help.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.200
I met David Razu Aznar, graduating from the
Kennedy School today.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.620
David, stand up.

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:18.770
He's a former city councilor who successfully
led the battle to make Mexico City the first

00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:30.870
Latin American city to pass marriage equality
-- even before San Francisco.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.530
This is my story too.

00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:41.640
A student in a dorm room, connecting one community
at a time, and keeping at it until one day

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.360
we connect the whole world.

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.470
Change starts local.

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.370
Even global changes start small -- with people
like us.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:28:00.290
In our generation, the struggle of whether
we connect more, whether we achieve our biggest

00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:07.550
opportunities, comes down to this -- your
ability to build communities and create a

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:22.330
world where every single person has a sense
of purpose.

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:30.000
Class of 2017, you are graduating into a world
that needs purpose.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.690
It's up to you to create it.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:42.710
Now, you may be thinking: can I really do
this?

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:47.679
Remember when I told you about that class
I taught at the Boys and Girls Club?

00:28:47.679 --> 00:28:53.460
One day after class I was talking to them
about college, and one of my top students

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:59.400
raised his hand and said he wasn't sure he
could go because he's undocumented.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.220
He didn't know if they'd let him in.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.360
Last year I took him out to breakfast for
his birthday.

00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:13.200
I wanted to get him a present, so I asked
him and he started talking about students

00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:22.770
he saw struggling and said "You know, I'd
really just like a book on social justice."

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:25.040
I was blown away.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:31.850
Here's a young guy who has every reason to
be cynical.

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:39.440
He didn't know if the country he calls home
-- the only one he's known -- would deny him

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:43.640
his dream of going to college.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.750
But he wasn't feeling sorry for himself.

00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:49.690
He wasn't even thinking of himself.

00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:58.360
He has a greater sense of purpose, and he's
going to bring people along with him.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.961
It says something about our current situation
that I can't even say his name because I don't

00:30:02.961 --> 00:30:07.070
want to put him at risk.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:13.250
But if a high school senior who doesn't know
what the future holds can do his part to move

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:46.290
the world forward, then we owe it to the world
to do our part too.

00:30:46.290 --> 00:30:54.960
Before you walk out those gates one last time,
as we sit in front of Memorial Church, I am

00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:04.510
reminded of a prayer, Mi Shebeirach, that
I say whenever I face a challenge, that I

00:31:04.510 --> 00:31:09.429
sing to my daughter thinking about her future
when I tuck her into bed.

00:31:09.429 --> 00:31:15.429
It goes:
"May the source of strength, who blessed the

00:31:15.429 --> 00:31:22.309
ones before us, help us *find the courage*
to make our lives a blessing."

00:31:22.309 --> 00:31:29.780
I hope you find the courage to make your life
a blessing.

00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.720
Congratulations, Class of '17!

00:31:31.720 --> 00:32:18.220
Good luck out there.
