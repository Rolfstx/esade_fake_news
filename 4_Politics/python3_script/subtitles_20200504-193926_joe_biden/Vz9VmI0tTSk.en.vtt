00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.180
Hi, I'm Gardener Scott.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.290
There are few things as good as a fresh tomato

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.099
from a plant you grew in your own garden and knowing a few tips can make the whole effort

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.410
easier and more successful.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.920
Join me as I show you how I prune tomatoes for the best harvest.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.770
 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:50.740
I grow my tomatoes vertically and this is a method I recommend. You may have seen my other video that shows how I trellis the tomatoes

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:58.210
But growing vertically, I can put more tomatoes closer together and get a bigger harvest.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.670
But if you just let them go.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.089
they run rampant and before long it's difficult to even walk among your tomatoes.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.520
So understanding how to prune them

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.479
for the best control and the best harvest

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.550
Is really important and it really only comes down to a couple steps.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:27.759
First, it's important to understand what type of tomato plants you're growing. There's basically two types, there are

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.550
determinate tomatoes and

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.220
Indeterminate tomatoes. Now, the determinate tomatoes are a bush tomato.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.700
They don't vine, they just grow up to a certain size 3, 4, maybe even 5 feet.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.099
When they hit that size that's the end of their growth period and then they set flowers and all those flowers turn into

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.140
tomatoes and the harvest comes within a relatively short period of time,

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.180
one or two weeks. And when all those tomatoes are harvested that's pretty much the end of what that plant will produce.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.890
Indeterminate tomatoes are

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.019
vining tomatoes. Though not a true vine, they'll grow and grow and grow

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.720
until they die.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.220
The difference being that as they grow they'll set

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:29.470
their flowers and the flowers will turn into tomatoes and you'll have a harvest of tomatoes and then as the plant grows

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.310
it'll set another cluster of flowers,

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.499
and those flowers will turn into tomatoes and the plant will continue to grow.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.509
Those are the type of tomatoes that many gardeners like to have because you can go out every night and harvest some

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.030
tomatoes.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:56.979
The reason it's important to understand which type of tomato plant you're growing is because the way you prune them is different.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.969
For these determinant tomatoes behind me, I'm going to let them grow with

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:09.339
minimal pruning because most of the branches that will be producing fruit

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.310
I want to leave on the plant. If I prune them off, I'm going to be losing some of that production.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.689
I'll do some pruning, and I'll show you that a little later on, with some of the lower

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.499
branches to try to prevent some disease and pest issues.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.709
But for the most part I let determinate tomatoes grow and I don't prune them.

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:39.249
But for indeterminate tomatoes, a plant can easily take over the garden because they just keep growing and keep growing

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.889
and before long I might have

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:47.199
branches that start encroaching into the pathway or into other

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:54.309
plants and I really want to try to keep the plants under control so I can keep them growing in the direction

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.299
I want them to grow. Now, will I lose some production on the branches that I prune off?

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:08.469
Yes, I will but I'm allowing the plant that remains to be stronger,

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.000
more robust, and

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.869
actually give me an abundance of fruit without having to just let it go wild.

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.799
The way that tomatoes grow

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:28.750
Is from a tip and this growing tip will continue to grow until the plant dies.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:31.929
It comes from the main

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:38.228
stem that will go all the way back down to the base of the plant and as the tomato grows

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.400
there'll be a junction and at the junction is a side branch that just has leaves to

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.639
conduct photosynthesis and get energy for the plant.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.750
At most of the junctions you'll see a flower cluster and this is what develops into the tomatoes,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.449
but you'll also see another

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:04.930
growing point and this is a sucker and on most indeterminate tomatoes

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.889
you'll see suckers develop at every junction

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.630
between a side branch and the main stem and

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:21.070
then you'll have a flower cluster. As you proceed down the plant you'll see the main stem,

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.978
a side branch,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.800
and a sucker.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.139
Because this has been happening as long as the plant is growing, in

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.050
these junctions you

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:41.560
have these suckers and if left in place, these suckers will continue to grow.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.059
And they'll also form their own

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:50.949
suckers between the main stem and

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:58.510
the side branches and each one of these suckers now has the potential of growing and

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:06.130
setting off new suckers. Before you know it you've got suckers and new branches everywhere.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:14.829
For smaller plants, I just pluck out the suckers as I see them growing. Just take my thumb and

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.039
just pinch it off.

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.440
Everywhere I see one,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.660
just pinch it off.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.580
As it grows

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.810
it'll continue to give

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.280
bigger suckers

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.519
all along the plant at each

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.920
of these junctions.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:44.569
Sometimes it's difficult to determine which one is the sucker and which one is

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.550
the little branch, but the sucker is always the one in the middle.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.899
This one's almost as big as the main stem.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.160
Butt it to can just be plucked out.

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:09.119
As the tomatoes grow, if you haven't plucked them out when they're little, they tend to start getting pretty big.

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:16.979
This is about as big as I like to use my fingernail and thumb, about just a little bit smaller than a pencil.

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.940
And I try to cut all the way through it with my thumb nail.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.329
Problem you run into is that if you just try to pluck it out

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.489
you might actually tear the main stem and cause some damage.

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:38.788
For suckers that have developed into bigger branches you want to take some pruners and cut off the branch.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:47.970
Remember this side branch can remain because it's serving a useful purpose soaking up the sun's energy.

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:56.310
This plant right here is more than ready to prune. Now, I've chosen

00:07:56.919 --> 00:07:59.309
two of the main stems as

00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:06.839
the ones that I want to trellis and so now I can go back down the plant and take out the growing

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:09.090
stems that I really don't need anymore.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:13.949
And this one at the bottom is a good example.

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:16.889
So I'll come in

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.530
and I'll cut it off

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.560
close to the base of

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:27.659
the main stem. Now you can see this is a pretty substantial growth.

00:08:27.659 --> 00:08:35.609
In fact, there's already flowers and there's already tomatoes that have started developing on this part of the stem.

00:08:36.279 --> 00:08:39.989
But it's in the way and I really don't want it anymore

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.659
so renewed energy will actually go to

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:50.939
the tomatoes that are already set on the plant and will actually help the entire plant grow. And I'll just continue this process,

00:08:51.339 --> 00:08:57.509
looking for those suckers along the way that are really ones that I don't want anymore.

00:08:57.930 --> 00:08:59.930
And I'll remove them.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.810
Now remember, the suckers will grow into

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:10.049
completely viable main stems and at this point on this particular plant

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:15.870
I actually chose to keep the sucker as the one that I was going to trellis.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.329
So now that I'm going back to clean up the plant

00:09:19.029 --> 00:09:23.338
I'm actually cutting off what would have been the main stem

00:09:24.279 --> 00:09:29.128
and now I'm allowing the sucker to become the main stem.

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:35.789
And if you wait until the suckers have started to take over to prune you'll find them everywhere.

00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:40.679
Here's a sucker, here's a sucker,

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:49.589
here's a sucker, here's a sucker down here. There's some little ones that I can just pinch off,

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:56.849
but there's a lot of work involved if you just let the plant go crazy before you start pruning.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:02.789
Most of the diseases that will infect your tomatoes come from

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.490
bacteria or fungi

00:10:05.589 --> 00:10:08.789
and most of those actually come from the soil.

00:10:09.009 --> 00:10:16.769
So another very important reason to prune is to try to minimize the infection your plant might get

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:19.949
from soil borne problems.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.459
I've removed the suckers that were giving me concern on this plant

00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:31.139
so now I'll focus on the bottom part of the main stem

00:10:31.389 --> 00:10:38.669
and what I want to do is remove all the branches any suckers or other growths up to

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.540
about 15 to 18 inches off the ground.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:47.669
Because most of the problems this plant will suffer will come from the soil,

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:53.339
when it rains or when I water, the potential exists for

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:57.659
spores and bacteria to bounce from the soil

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.319
onto any low-lying leaves and

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:04.199
that's how it gets into the plant.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:12.000
So if I can remove these low-lying leaves before the plant has any problem, I reduce the risk

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:18.059
of bacteria and fungus infecting the plant. So it's a simple matter of coming in,

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:22.050
removing branches that are low on the plant,

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.160
 

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.160
and cleaning it up, so it's really

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.849
nice and runs minimal risk of being infected.

00:11:36.430 --> 00:11:42.209
If there's a branch that's lying low, below that 15 to 18 inch point,

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.550
even if it's higher up on the plant

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.880
I'll remove that as well.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:56.640
Another reason for removing the suckers and that lower growth of this entire section of plants is because it

00:11:56.709 --> 00:12:02.909
improves the air circulation through this entire section and with improved air circulation

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:07.080
there's less likelihood that the leaves will remain wet.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:13.949
And if they're not wet, they're less likely to have a bacterial or a fungus infection.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.990
I don't remove

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:21.719
every sucker. Remember, I'm trying to get the maximum harvest in a particular space

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:28.589
so as I am pruning I'm selective as to which ones I take off and

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:33.449
this one right here, this branch actually began as a sucker.

00:12:34.839 --> 00:12:38.519
It's got flower development. It's got good vertical growth.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:46.020
So I'm going to tie this off the twine and make this another primary stem.

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:52.020
It's hard to cut off branches on a tomato plant

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.830
especially when they've got flowers and fruit already forming because

00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:00.719
Isn't that the reason why you're growing tomato plants in the first place?

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.359
But ultimately by pruning off particularly those lower branches and the suckers

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:13.049
you're making a stronger plant and the fruit that remains on the plants will grow

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:17.190
faster and bigger because it's getting more energy from the plant.

00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:25.349
As you prune it's important to realize how you're trellising and how you're going to grow your plant.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:33.720
I'm growing vertically so these plants will get six, eight feet tall and so my pruning is to direct that

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.010
vertical growth to get a tall strong plant.

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:44.189
If your trellis isn't that tall and you're growing a much shorter plant

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:50.429
you may choose to keep more of those suckers so that you have a

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.220
bushier lower plant.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:55.919
Because my plants are growing taller

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.390
I keep the lower portion as a main stem and then I'll allow

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:08.489
two to branch off and those two now becomes strong and as the plant gets higher each of those two

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:12.000
will have suckers and I'll allow some of those suckers to grow.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.520
So the one becomes two and then those two branches may become four branches.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.800
So by the time I get to the top that's six to eight feet high.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:29.729
I have a very bushy plant that should be loaded with flowers and fruit.

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:33.960
You can accomplish the same thing if you're growing lower.

00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:35.850
Instead of removing

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:41.580
a lot of those lower suckers let some of those lower suckers develop into primary

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:47.640
stems and then as it gets a few feet higher let some of those suckers branch out.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:51.479
So your plant may only be 3 or 4 feet tall,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.750
but it's the exact same type of pruning as far as you controlling how many branches

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.499
grow and how bushy the plant becomes.

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.540
My tomato plants are cleaned up.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:14.550
I'm focusing energy now into the fruit and into the future growth and I'm ready for a good tomato season.

00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:20.040
There you have it. How I prune tomatoes for the best harvest.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.880
