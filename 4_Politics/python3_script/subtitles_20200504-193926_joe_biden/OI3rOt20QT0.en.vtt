&gt;&gt; Stephen: HEY, WHAT'S GOING
ON?

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:03.603 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NOTHIN'.

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:04.437 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NOTHIN''S GOING
ON?

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.938 align:start position:0%
WE'RE DOING A SHOW IS WHAT WE'RE
DOING.

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:08.674
THESE TWO -- THESE TWO -- AND
I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO THEM --

00:00:08.707 --> 00:00:13.780 align:start position:0%
THESE TWO ARE SITTING THERE ON
THEIR PHONES, PAYING NO

00:00:13.813 --> 00:00:14.948 align:start position:0%
ATTENTION TO ME.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:17.483
I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU AT HOME
AREN'T ON YOUR PHONES LIKE MY

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:19.519 align:start position:0%
SON AND MY WIFE.

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:21.954 align:start position:0%
( SIGHS )
&gt;&gt; SOME VERY EVENTFUL THINGS

00:00:21.987 --> 00:00:23.122 align:start position:0%
GOING ON.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:24.524 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT'S GOING ON
THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:27.693 align:start position:0%
WATCHING YOUR FATHER DO A
TELEVISION SHOW.

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:31.564 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; MY FRIEND DANNY JUST SHAVED
HIS HEAD ON INSTAGRAM LIVE.

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT IS BETTER
THAN MY SHOW.

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:36.069 align:start position:0%
CAN I SEE A PHOTO?

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:37.603 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; DON'T HAVE A PHOTO NOW.

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:38.704 align:start position:0%
BUT EVENTUALLY.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:40.740 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT'S SO
IMPORTANT ABOUT YOUR PHONE OVER

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:41.507 align:start position:0%
THERE.

00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:42.442 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; NOTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW
ABOUT.

00:00:42.475 --> 00:00:45.611 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, MY BIRTHDAY
IS COMING UP.

00:00:45.644 --> 00:00:49.849 align:start position:0%
IF YOU'RE GETTING 15 AND A
HALF-33, IN CASE YOU'RE

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:51.317 align:start position:0%
WONDERING.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.352
HI, WELCOME TO "A LATE SHOW,"
I'M YOUR HOST STEPHEN TEACH.

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:55.922 size:84% position:42%
IT'S THE LAST DAY IN APRIL.

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.392
APRIL SHOWERS AREN'T SOMETHING I
HAVE BEEN DOING MUCH IN APRIL.

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:04.664 align:start position:0%
MAY, I MAY START SHOWERING IN
MAY.

00:01:04.697 --> 00:01:06.933 align:start position:0%
NOT A WORD!

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:12.705 align:start position:0%
APRIL 30th ALSO MARKS THE END
OF THE FEDERAL SOCIAL DISTANCING

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:16.742 align:start position:0%
GUIDELINES AND JED
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID THEY WILL

00:01:16.775 --> 00:01:20.146 size:75% position:38%
NOT BE EXTENDED FURTHER.

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.748
SO THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION
"WHEN WILL CORONAVIRUS RESURGE

00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:26.686 align:start position:0%
AGAIN?" IS:
♪ IT'S GONNA BE MAY ♪

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.490 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: TRUMP WAS ASKED
ABOUT THE LAPSING OF THE

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:31.691 align:start position:0%
GUIDELINES YESTERDAY IN THE OVAL
OFFICE:

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.793
&gt;&gt; SO THE CURRENT GUIDELINES
THEN WILL NOT BE EXTENDED AFTER

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.229 align:start position:0%
TOMORROW?

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:40.466 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I THINK A WAY OF SAYING
IT IS THEY'LL BE FADING OUT.

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:41.868 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: COME ON, YOU'RE
THE GOVERNMENT

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:46.572 size:84% position:42%
YOU SHOULD BE MORE SPECIFIC
ABOUT WHAT THE RULES ARE.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:50.076 align:start position:0%
THERE'S A REASON WHY YOU DON'T
SEE SIGNS THAT SAY, "SPEED

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
LIMIT: NO LONGER 55."

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:56.682
SINCE TRUMP HAS BEEN ROYALLY
SHANKING HIS CORONAVIRUS PRESS

00:01:56.715 --> 00:02:02.088 size:84% position:42%
CONFERENCES, HE'S GOT A NEW
STRATEGY: INVITE INDIVIDUAL

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:04.423
GOVERNORS TO THE OVAL OFFICE.

00:02:04.456 --> 00:02:06.392 align:start position:0%
TODAY, TRUMP MET WITH NEW JERSEY
GOVERNOR AND NUTCRACKER THAT

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:10.396 align:start position:0%
WISHED TO BE A REAL BOY, PHIL
MURPHY.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.166
DURING THE MEETING, TRUMP SAID
THAT HE'S SURE THAT THE ECONOMY

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.000
IS READY TO BOUNCE RIGHT BACK.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:14.600 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THERE IS TREMENDOUS PENT-UP
DEMAND.

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.068 align:start position:0%
I FEEL IT.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.236 align:start position:0%
I FEEL IT.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.508 align:start position:0%
I THINK SOMETIMES WHAT I FEEL IS
BETTER THAN WHAT I THINK.

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:26.145
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: ANYTHING HAS GOT TO
BE BETTER THAN WHAT YOU THINK.

00:02:26.178 --> 00:02:28.080 size:84% position:42%
BUT THAT'S JUST HOW I FEEL.

00:02:28.113 --> 00:02:29.348
TRUMP TALKED ABOUT THE EARLY
FEARS OF EQUIPMENT SHORTAGES:

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:30.516
&gt;&gt; THERE WAS NEVER A PERSON
THAT NEEDED A VENTILATOR THAT

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.150 align:start position:0%
DIDN'T GET ONE.

00:02:31.183 --> 00:02:32.151 align:start position:0%
IN ANY STATE.

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:36.389 align:start position:0%
NOT ONE PERSON.

00:02:36.422 --> 00:02:37.924 align:start position:0%
SO WE DIDN'T SAY, "HE DIDN'T SAY
GET A VENTILATOR, SOMEBODY

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:43.095 align:start position:0%
PASSED AWAY, SOMEBODY DIDN'T
MAKE IT."

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:44.329 size:81% position:41%
NOW WE HAD A MASK PROBLEM.

00:02:44.363 --> 00:02:45.364 align:start position:0%
NOW WE HAVE SO MANY MASKS, WE
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEM.

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:51.637 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: HERE'S AN IDEA: PUT
ONE ON MIKE PENCE.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.175
&gt;&gt; THEN GOVERNOR MURPHY USED AN
ANALOGY TRUMP REALLY LIKE THE

00:02:56.208 --> 00:03:00.246 align:start position:0%
LIKED ABOUT HOW THE CORONAVIRUS
TOK THEM BY SURPRISE

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.347 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; AS MIKE TYSON SAYS,
EVERYONE'S GOT A PLAN UNTIL YOU

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.048 size:75% position:38%
GET PUNCHED IN THE FACE.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.216 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; AND WE DID.

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:04.417
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: I'M NOT SURPRISED
TRUMP RELATES TO MIKE TYSON:

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.484
THEY'RE BOTH '80S POP CULTURE
ICONS WITH HORRIBLE HISTORIES

00:03:05.517 --> 00:03:07.853 align:start position:0%
WITH WOMEN, WHO NEED NO EXCUSE
TO EAT A HUMAN EAR.

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:15.595 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"IT IS THE BACON OF THE FACE."

00:03:15.628 --> 00:03:18.064 size:78% position:39%
"I LOVE A GOOD E. L.T. ."

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.433
TRUMP TRIED TO PUT A POSITIVE
SPIN ON HOW MANY CASES OF THE

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.534 size:78% position:39%
CORONAVIRUS THE U.S. HAS.

00:03:21.567 --> 00:03:27.173 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE AREAS THAT ARE
REALLY AT A VERY LOW POINT.

00:03:27.206 --> 00:03:28.741
AND REALLY HITTING-- I ALWAYS
SAY, HEADING SOUTH QUICKLY.

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.443 size:75% position:38%
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.745 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: (AS TRUMP)
"THINGS ARE REALLY HEADING SOUTH

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:36.449 align:start position:0%
QUICKLY, I MEAN, THE NUMBERS ARE
RAPIDLY GOING DOWN THE TUBES,

00:03:36.482 --> 00:03:41.454 align:start position:0%
JUST CIRCLING THE DRAIN, AND
THAT'S WHAT WE WANT."

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:44.724 align:start position:0%
ONE PUNDIT WAS QUICK TO RESPOND
TO TRUMP'S HEADING SOUTH

00:03:44.757 --> 00:03:48.427 align:start position:0%
COMMENT:
&gt;&gt; I DO NOT THINK IT MEANS WHAT

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.895 align:start position:0%
YOU THINK IT MEANS.

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:53.232 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: INCONCEIVABLE!

00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:54.734 align:start position:0%
TRUMP DIDN'T SEEM TOO WORRIED
ABOUT OPENING UP TOO QUICKLY AND

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.402
CAUSING A SECOND WAVE OF CASES.

00:03:56.435 --> 00:04:00.439
&gt;&gt; WE WILL PUT OUT THE EMBERS
AND WE WILL PUT OUT THE FLAMES.

00:04:00.472 --> 00:04:04.677 align:start position:0%
THERE WILL BE POCKETS OF FIRE,
AND WE'LL PUT THEM OUT.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.445 align:start position:0%
IF YOU HAVE, I CALL THEM BURNING
EMBERS, BOOM.

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:08.381
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OF COURSE, BECAUSE
THE SOUND YOU ASSOCIATE WITH

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:12.451 align:start position:0%
SAFELY PUTTING OUT A FIRE IS
"BOOM."

00:04:12.484 --> 00:04:15.121
TRUMP JUST DOESN'T TALK LIKE A
GUY WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:15.822 align:start position:0%
ABOUT.

00:04:15.855 --> 00:04:16.656
CAN YOU IMAGINE HIM AS A DOCTOR?

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:22.061 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"WE'RE GONNA GO IN THERE AND

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:25.831 size:84% position:42%
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE LITTLE
KNIFE AND COCUT, CUT, SNAP,

00:04:25.864 --> 00:04:30.503 align:start position:0%
SNAP, AND THERE'S GONNA BE -- I
CALL IT BLOOD.

00:04:30.536 --> 00:04:32.038 align:start position:0%
BUT WE'RE GONNA SAY, 'NO BLOOD.'
THEN STITCH.

00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
THEN GO IN THE PLACE WHERE THE
BLOOD WAS AND 'BOOM.'"

00:04:40.512 --> 00:04:42.515 align:start position:0%
TRUMP ALSO ADDRESSED WHY HE
THINKS CERTAIN STATES DON'T NEED

00:04:42.548 --> 00:04:45.117 align:start position:0%
AS MUCH TESTING:
&gt;&gt; YOU HAVE SOME GOVERNORS THAT

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.521
LOVE THE TESTS, YOU OTHERS THAT
LIKE DOING IT A DIFFERENT WAY,

00:04:48.554 --> 00:04:53.292 align:start position:0%
AN OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

00:04:53.325 --> 00:04:56.796 size:88% position:44%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: IS OLD-FASHIONED
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN

00:04:56.829 --> 00:04:58.631 align:start position:0%
MEDICAL CARE?

00:04:58.664 --> 00:04:59.865
"I DON'T NEED THESE NEWFANGLED
TESTS AND SWABS, JUST COVER ME

00:04:59.898 --> 00:05:05.504 align:start position:0%
IN LEECHES AND BALANCE MY
HUMORS."

00:05:05.537 --> 00:05:06.772
TRUMP ALSO THINKS THAT COMING UP
WITH A VACCINE IS NOT THAT BIG A

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:08.474 align:start position:0%
DEAL.

00:05:08.507 --> 00:05:12.011
&gt;&gt; SO, THIS 100% SCENARIO YOU
ARE LAYING OUT, GOING BACK TO

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:13.012 align:start position:0%
THE WAY IT WAS.

00:05:13.045 --> 00:05:16.882 align:start position:0%
IS THAT BEFORE THE VACCINE OR
AFTER THE VACCINE?

00:05:16.915 --> 00:05:18.718 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; SO, A LOT OF PROGRESS IS
BEING MADE ON THE VACCINE, BUT

00:05:18.751 --> 00:05:22.421 align:start position:0%
YOU NEVER KNOW.

00:05:22.454 --> 00:05:23.956 align:start position:0%
RIGHT?

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:25.224 align:start position:0%
YOU NEVER KNOW.

00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:27.693
IF YOU DON'T HAVE A VACCINE, IF
THAT VIRUS IS GONE, WE ARE LIKE

00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:28.994 align:start position:0%
WHERE WE WERE BEFORE.

00:05:29.027 --> 00:05:30.529 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: OH, WHERE WE WERE
BEFORE!

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:31.697 align:start position:0%
GOOD.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:32.731 align:start position:0%
SO INSTEAD OF BEING IN A GLOBAL
PANDEMIC, WE'LL GO BACK TO

00:05:32.764 --> 00:05:37.136 align:start position:0%
BEING COMPLETELY UNPREPARED FOR
A GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.705 align:start position:0%
THAT ANSWER MADE NO SENSE, AS A
REPORTER POINTED OUT:

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:43.843
&gt;&gt; WITHOUT A VACCINE, SIR, WHY
DO YOU THINK THE VIRUS WILL JUST

00:05:43.876 --> 00:05:44.343 align:start position:0%
BE GONE?

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:45.478 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT'S GOING TO GO.

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:45.978 align:start position:0%
IT'S GOING TO LEAVE.

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.847 align:start position:0%
IT'S GONNA BE GONE.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:48.714
IT IS GOING TO BE ERADICATED.

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:50.416 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: (AS TRUMP)
"IT'S GOING TO GO.

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.217 align:start position:0%
IT'S GOING TO LEAVE.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.886 align:start position:0%
IT'S GONNA SLIP OUT THE BACK,
JACK.

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:54.653 align:start position:0%
MAKE A NEW PLAN, STAN.

00:05:54.686 --> 00:05:55.521
IT'S GONNA GET ON THE BUS, GUS.

00:05:55.554 --> 00:05:56.021 align:start position:0%
YOU WANT MORE?

00:05:56.055 --> 00:06:00.993 align:start position:0%
I GOT 50 OF THESE."

00:06:01.026 --> 00:06:01.861
HERE'S THE THING: TRUMP DOESN'T
WANT EVERYTHING TO GO BACK TO

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:05.097
NORMAL BECAUSE WE'RE "READY."

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.867
HE WANTS EVERYTHING TO GO BACK
TO NORMAL BECAUSE HE'S BORED:

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.403 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I HAVE BEEN AT THE WHITE
HOUSE FOR MANY MONTHS, AND I'D

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:13.873 align:start position:0%
LIKE TO GET OUT.

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:15.174
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: MR. PRESIDENT, WE'D
ALL LIKE TO GET YOU OUT OF THE

00:06:15.207 --> 00:06:17.676 align:start position:0%
WHITE HOUSE.

00:06:17.709 --> 00:06:22.281 align:start position:0%
THERE'S ONE ACTIVITY TRUMP
ESPECIALLY MISSES: HIS RALLIES.

00:06:22.314 --> 00:06:25.451 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; HOPEFULLY IN THE NOT TOO
DISTANT FUTURE WE'LL HAVE SOME

00:06:25.484 --> 00:06:28.587
MASSIVE RALLIES AND PEOPLE WILL
BE SITTING NEXT TO EACH OTHER.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.289 align:start position:0%
I CAN'T IMAGINE A RALLY WHERE
YOU WOULD HAVE EVERY FOURTH SEAT

00:06:30.322 --> 00:06:34.226 align:start position:0%
FULL.

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.897
EVERY SIX SEATS ARE EMPTY FOR
EVERYONE THAT YOU HAVE FULL.

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:38.764 size:88% position:44%
THAT WOULDN'T LOOK TOO GOOD.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:42.234 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; STEPHEN: YEAH, THAT SOUNDS
HORRIBLE.

00:06:42.267 --> 00:06:43.702 size:75% position:38%
IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THIS.

00:06:43.735 --> 00:06:46.238 align:start position:0%
BUT IT'S NOT JUST HIS OWN
RALLIES HE WANTS DANGEROUSLY

00:06:46.271 --> 00:06:49.942 align:start position:0%
FULL, IT'S ALSO EVERYWHERE ELSE:
&gt;&gt; I HAD ONE RESTAURANT OWNER

00:06:49.975 --> 00:06:54.246 align:start position:0%
COME UP TO ME AND SAID, "SIR
I'M GOING TO BE OPENING UP, BUT,

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:58.250
IF I DISTANCE TOO MUCH, I HAVE
50% OF THE RESTAURANT I HAD."

00:06:58.283 --> 00:07:01.620 align:start position:0%

CONSOLER-IN-CHIEF.

00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:06.725 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"I SAID, IT WILL ALSO HAVE A

00:07:06.758 --> 00:07:10.229 align:start position:0%
WORSE ATMOSPHERE AND MAKE LESS
MONEY.

00:07:10.262 --> 00:07:13.399 align:start position:0%
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING IS, YOUR
RESTAURANT IS HEADING SOUTH

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:13.999 align:start position:0%
QUICKLY.

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:22.007 size:78% position:39%
AND THAT'S WHAT WE WANT."

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.141 size:84% position:42%
MULTIPLE POLLS SHOW TRUMP'S
TRAILING JOE BIDEN IN SWING

00:07:23.175 --> 00:07:25.010 align:start position:0%
STATES, BUT IN AN INTERVIEW HE
SAID, "I DON'T BELIEVE THE

00:07:25.043 --> 00:07:26.011 align:start position:0%
POLLS.

00:07:26.044 --> 00:07:29.849 align:start position:0%
I BELIEVE THE PEOPLE OF THIS
COUNTRY ARE SMART.

00:07:29.882 --> 00:07:32.818
AND I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WILL
PUT A MAN IN WHO'S INCOMPETENT."

00:07:32.851 --> 00:07:35.387 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE RIGHT, THE PEOPLE OF THIS
COUNTRY WOULDN'T.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.892
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE, ON THE
OTHER HAND, IS FINE WITH IT.

00:07:39.925 --> 00:07:42.294 size:88% position:44%
BUT DESPITE NOT BELIEVING IN
THESE POLLS, HE STILL FOUND

00:07:42.327 --> 00:07:46.065 align:start position:0%
SOMEONE TO BLAME THEM ON:
TRUMP CAMPAIGN MANAGER AND WHAT

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:49.935
HAPPENS WHEN YOUR LOCAL MILITIA
POOLS THEIR MONEY TO BUY ONE

00:07:49.968 --> 00:07:51.036 align:start position:0%
SUIT, BRAD PARSCALE.

00:07:51.069 --> 00:07:54.607 align:start position:0%
ON FRIDAY, TRUMP BERATED
PARSCALE FOR THE DAMAGING POLL

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.310 align:start position:0%
NUMBERS, AND AT ONE POINT EVEN
THREATENED TO SUE HIM.

00:07:58.343 --> 00:07:59.845 align:start position:0%
SUE HIM?

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:02.381 align:start position:0%
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU HANDLE
DISAPPOINTMENT.

00:08:02.414 --> 00:08:05.050 size:88% position:44%
"I'M SORRY, SIR, WE STOPPED
SERVING BREAKFAST AT 11:00."

00:08:05.083 --> 00:08:06.385 align:start position:0%
(AS TRUMP)
"WELL, YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM MY

"THAT BAGEL GUY'S A TOUGH

COOKIE."

00:08:21.166 --> 00:08:22.434 size:81% position:41%
BUT THEY WERE ABLE TO HASH
THINGS OUT AFTER PARSCALE

00:08:22.467 --> 00:08:23.869
BROUGHT POLLING NUMBERS THAT
WERE MORE POSITIVE FOR TRUMP,

00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:28.407 align:start position:0%
AND THE PRESIDENT SEEMED IN A
FAR BETTER MOOD.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.375 align:start position:0%
YES, I'M SURE.

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:33.913 align:start position:0%
AND I'M BEING TOLD WE HAVE A
COPY OF THAT POLL.

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:35.047 align:start position:0%
THERE YOU GO.

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:38.083 size:88% position:44%
TRUMP CLAIMS THIS WHOLE SPAT
WITH PARSCALE IS OVERBLOWN,

00:08:38.116 --> 00:08:42.354 align:start position:0%
TWEETING LATE LAST NIGHT
"JUST TOLD THAT FAKE NEWS @CNN

00:08:42.387 --> 00:08:46.358
IS FALSELY REPORTING THAT I WAS
RECENTLY SHOUTING AT MY CAMPAIGN

00:08:46.391 --> 00:08:50.062
MANAGER OVER MADE UP NONSENSE.

00:08:50.095 --> 00:08:53.399
ACTUALLY, HE IS DOING A GREAT
JOB, I NEVER SHOUTED AT HIM--

00:08:53.432 --> 00:08:56.068 align:start position:0%
BEEN WITH ME FOR YEARS
INCLUDING THE 2016 WIN, AND HAVE

00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:58.370 align:start position:0%
NO INTENTION TO DO SO.

00:08:58.403 --> 00:09:01.373 align:start position:0%
JUST FAKE NEWS!"
YEAH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

00:09:01.406 --> 00:09:06.378
I MEAN, CAN YOU IMAGINE TRUMP
ENDING A RELATIONSHIP HE'S HAD

00:09:06.411 --> 00:09:07.947 align:start position:0%
WITH SOMEONE FOR YEARS?

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:12.651 align:start position:0%
EACH STATE IS TACKLING REOPENING
DIFFERENTLY.

00:09:12.684 --> 00:09:13.785
SOME ARE GOING FULL "MAD MAX."

00:09:13.819 --> 00:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
BECAUSE RECENTLY, GEORGIA
ANNOUNCED THEY'LL BE ALLOWING

00:09:14.953 --> 00:09:18.757 align:start position:0%
TEENS TO GET THEIR LICENSE WITH
JUST PARENTAL APPROVAL,

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:22.394 size:78% position:39%
SCRAPPING DRIVER'S TESTS.

00:09:22.427 --> 00:09:25.564 size:88% position:44%
OKAY, THEY ARE GOING TO BE A
BUNCH OF UNTESTED TEENAGERS

00:09:25.597 --> 00:09:26.798 align:start position:0%
DRIVING.

00:09:26.832 --> 00:09:29.168 align:start position:0%
SO, IF YOU'RE HEADED TO GEORGIA,
STAY OFF THE ROADS, IT'S MUCH

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:37.109 align:start position:0%
SAFER TO TAKE THE MIDNIGHT
TRAIN.

00:09:37.142 --> 00:09:38.243 align:start position:0%
WHOO WHOO!

00:09:38.277 --> 00:09:39.511 align:start position:0%
THE CHANGE WAS ENACTED THROUGH
EXECUTIVE ORDER BY GEORGIA

00:09:39.544 --> 00:09:41.347 align:start position:0%
GOVERNOR AND DAD WHO DID TOO
MUCH COKE BEFORE THE

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.984 align:start position:0%
FATHER-DAUGHTER DANCE, BRIAN
KEMP.

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:46.552 align:start position:0%
AND ACCORDING TO HIS RULES,
TEENS WHO'VE HAD THEIR LEARNER'S

00:09:46.585 --> 00:09:50.122 align:start position:0%
PERMIT FOR OVER A YEAR, CAN NOW
SIMPLY GO ONLINE AND OBTAIN

00:09:50.155 --> 00:09:53.759
THEIR LICENSE AFTER GETTING A
PARENT OR GUARDIAN'S OKAY.

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:56.028
NOW, IF YOU'RE WORRIED THAT KIDS
WILL JUST FORGE THEIR PARENT'S

00:09:56.061 --> 00:09:59.898 align:start position:0%
SIGNATURES, YOU'RE SMARTER THAN
THE GOVERNOR OF GEORGIA.

00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:02.134 align:start position:0%
DRIVING SCHOOLS ARE HOPEFUL THAT
THIS PLAN WILL WORK, WITH ONE

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:05.738
INSTRUCTOR SAYING, "I'M HOPING
MOST PARENTS WON'T JUST SIGN OFF

00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:07.840
ON THOSE 40 HOURS, I'M HOPING
MOST WILL TAKE THE TIME AND

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:10.442 size:88% position:44%
DRIVE WITH THEIR KIDS BEFORE
THEY LET THEM OBTAIN THEIR

00:10:10.475 --> 00:10:11.844 align:start position:0%

00:10:11.877 --> 00:10:13.712 size:88% position:44%
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PARENTS
WHO'VE BEEN TRAPPED IN THEIR

00:10:13.745 --> 00:10:16.949 align:start position:0%
HOUSES WITH TEENAGERS FOR SEVEN
WEEKS.

00:10:16.982 --> 00:10:18.517
I'M GUESSING THEY'RE GOING TO
TAKE THE TIME TO SAY, "DO YOU

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.418 size:88% position:44%
KNOW HOW TO OPEN THE GARAGE?

00:10:19.451 --> 00:10:20.185 align:start position:0%
GREAT.

00:10:20.218 --> 00:10:22.554
THE PEDAL ON THE RIGHT IS GO.

00:10:22.587 --> 00:10:26.191
HERE'S 20 BUCKS, AND A FAKE I.D.

00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:27.059 align:start position:0%
GO BUY ME SOME WINE."

00:10:27.092 --> 00:10:30.696 align:start position:0%
WE'VE GOT A SHOW FOR YOU
TONIGHT.

00:10:30.729 --> 00:10:32.998 size:84% position:42%
I'LL BE TALKING TO SENATE
