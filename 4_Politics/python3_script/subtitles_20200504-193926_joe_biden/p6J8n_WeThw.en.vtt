00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:06.467
 VOICEOVER: The
 following program

00:00:06.567 --> 00:00:08.701
 contains explicit
 language and images

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:11.133
 from law enforcement

 Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:22.901
 (Train horn blowing)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.300
COTANT: Back in the
'60's and '70's, my folks,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.434
they went to work,
I went to school.

00:00:29.534 --> 00:00:30.734
We left the house
unlocked. (laughs)

00:00:30.834 --> 00:00:33.467
I mean that was
just the way it was.

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:34.734
 NARRATOR: The
 duties of a small town

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.133
 police officer never change.

00:00:37.234 --> 00:00:39.334
PRESTON: It's nice to
work in a smaller town,

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:40.934
because you can have
the rapport with people

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:43.334
and people can trust you.
OFFICER: Looks like a military..

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:44.567
 NARRATOR: Patrol the streets,

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:47.534
 collect the facts,
 find the crook.

00:00:47.634 --> 00:00:49.133
SPROCK: Everybody
knows everybody.

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:52.267
And everybody's got an
opinion on what people do.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.133
 NARRATOR: Make
 people feel safe.

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:55.300
 Nothing's changed.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.100
TAYLOR: The level of crime today

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.734
is different than
it was 20 years ago.

00:01:00.834 --> 00:01:02.834
10 years ago.

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:04.300
 NARRATOR:
 Everything's changed.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.634
 The technology.

00:01:05.734 --> 00:01:06.901
OFFICER: You call us.
CITIZEN: Okay.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.434
 NARRATOR: Public expectations,
 training requirements.

00:01:09.534 --> 00:01:11.968
INSTRUCTOR:
You are scared to death.

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:13.267
 NARRATOR: Rules
 of engagement.

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:14.100
POLICE OFFICER:
Put the hammer down,

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.400
or you're gonna get tased.

00:01:15.501 --> 00:01:17.200
 NARRATOR: The
 ferocity of the violence.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.501
 (gun shots fired)

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:22.367
URBANEK: So when you think
it's not gonna happen here,

00:01:22.467 --> 00:01:23.534
it is.
 (sirens wail)

00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:25.067
We just don't know when.

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.501
 NARRATOR: A changing
 job in a complex world.

00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:30.300
 That's the reality of the
 rural sheriff's deputy

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.667
 and the small town cop.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:45.267
OFFICER CHUCK MENEZES: Every TV
show I ever watched lied to me.

00:01:45.367 --> 00:01:46.934
'Cause it was supposed
to be fun and exciting.

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:49.734
This is the boringest
job there is.

00:01:49.834 --> 00:01:52.501
As a friend of mine said, with
five minutes of sheer terror.

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:58.934
 (tires scratch on pavement)

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:00.667
 NARRATOR: Four
 full-time police officers

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:03.334
 handle law enforcement
 in Mitchell, Nebraska.

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:06.234
 Seven days a week,
 24 hours a day.

00:02:06.334 --> 00:02:08.567
 There are a few part-timers,
 called in in a pinch.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.601
MENEZES: Because you get a
lot of 'em that go,

00:02:11.701 --> 00:02:13.400
"You're just a small town cop."

00:02:13.501 --> 00:02:14.534
You get that a lot.

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:17.334
What they don't understand,

00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:19.033
everybody goes through
the same training.

00:02:19.133 --> 00:02:20.601
It's all the same training.

00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:22.501
You deal with the
same situations.

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:25.467
The only difference between
a big city, we're it.

00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:26.400
We're everything.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.601
 NARRATOR: The crime
 rate in surrounding

00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:31.734
 Scotts Bluff County
 is slightly higher

00:02:31.834 --> 00:02:33.200
 than the state average.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.567
 But in Mitchell, the
 number of total crimes,

00:02:35.667 --> 00:02:38.767
 mostly small stuff,
 is well below 100.

00:02:38.868 --> 00:02:41.634
 The last murder was in 2011.

00:02:41.734 --> 00:02:47.167
CHIEF MIKE COTANT:
Night shift has started
at 1600, four o'clock.

00:02:47.267 --> 00:02:49.601
Went out and did
two written warnings

00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:52.801
on vehicles with expired
plates on the streets.

00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:54.934
 NARRATOR: Every morning,
 police chief Mike Cotant

00:02:55.033 --> 00:02:56.834
 runs through a log book to see

00:02:56.934 --> 00:02:59.300
 what kept the
 overnight officer busy.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.467
COTANT: Had an assist the
public, about a red Dodge Dakota

00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:07.100
in the high school parking
lot with its headlights on.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.901
That was about it for that day.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.167
 NARRATOR: The chief
 took over the department

00:03:10.267 --> 00:03:12.067
 in Mitchell about
 seven years ago.

00:03:12.167 --> 00:03:14.467
 Before that, he served
 as a reserve deputy

00:03:14.567 --> 00:03:16.234
 in Scotts Bluff County.

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:18.901
Later, in tiny Lyman, Nebraska,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.734
 he got hired by an old
 school police captain.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.868
COTANT: And he says, "Well I'll
see you on Thursday,"

00:03:23.968 --> 00:03:28.334
so I come up Thursday evening,

00:03:28.434 --> 00:03:30.200
and gives me a set
of keys, and he says,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.267
"Here's your belt, and here's
a gun, and I'm going home."

00:03:34.367 --> 00:03:35.334
 BILL KELLY:
 How much training?

00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:36.801
COTANT: I did not have it.

00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:38.334
None.

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:39.734
There was nothing.

00:03:39.834 --> 00:03:44.400
I didn't know the radio
codes, I didn't, you know,

00:03:44.501 --> 00:03:47.501
I was really, really shocked.

00:03:49.167 --> 00:03:52.100
Off we go.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.601
But we give them the
best that we can give.

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:58.868
Like tonight, example, I,

00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:00.400
we should have another
officer on tonight,

00:04:00.501 --> 00:04:05.701
well we don't, so the chief
has gotta fill the boots.

00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:10.100
We know where our
trouble spots are.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.834
And we patrol that area a
little more than we do others,

00:04:12.934 --> 00:04:16.033
but you never know
what's gonna happen

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:17.200
and where it's gonna happen.

00:04:18.567 --> 00:04:20.934
We look for car doors open,

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:28.067
or vehicles that are not
known to be in that area.

00:04:28.167 --> 00:04:29.601
200 Central.

00:04:29.701 --> 00:04:30.934
 DISPATCHER: I got a 79.

00:04:31.033 --> 00:04:34.501
COTANT: 10-39, T-Tom 770.

00:04:34.601 --> 00:04:38.701
I have never seen that
vehicle around, so.

00:04:38.801 --> 00:04:40.968
I know just about
everybody in town.

00:04:41.067 --> 00:04:44.534
Unless they've just moved in,
or something of that nature,

00:04:44.634 --> 00:04:47.000
then I, but I try
to make it a point

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.868
that I get out and
visit with people.

00:04:49.968 --> 00:04:51.968
What are you doing?

00:04:52.067 --> 00:04:52.968
CITIZEN: Totally driving
the speed limit.

00:04:53.067 --> 00:04:54.400
COTANT: Oh yeah, okay.

00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:55.734
CITIZEN: No. (laughs)

00:04:55.834 --> 00:04:57.501
COTANT: 'Cause they're your
eyes.
CITIZEN: Before we hit

00:04:57.601 --> 00:04:58.667
the city limits
COTANT: And they're your ears.

00:04:58.767 --> 00:05:00.067
CITIZEN: I take them.
COTANT: And they have

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:01.367
a wealth of information
 (Cotant laughs)

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:04.968
that otherwise you
wouldn't know about.

00:05:05.067 --> 00:05:07.901
You guys need to go home, okay?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.534
We need to talk
to your mom, okay?

00:05:10.634 --> 00:05:11.434
GIRL: Okay.

00:05:11.534 --> 00:05:12.901
COTANT: They
just moved in up here.

00:05:14.567 --> 00:05:16.734
 NARRATOR: A new mom in
 town got a friendly reminder

00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:20.734
 to keep her curious kids away
 from the railroad tracks.

00:05:20.834 --> 00:05:23.334
 Pulling into the trailer
 park a few minutes later,

00:05:23.434 --> 00:05:25.400
 the chief waves at
 a familiar face,

00:05:25.501 --> 00:05:26.868
 sensing something's wrong.

00:05:26.968 --> 00:05:30.701
COTANT: You okay, Tina?

00:05:30.801 --> 00:05:31.534
TINA: It's been a hard day.

00:05:31.634 --> 00:05:32.868
COTANT: Has it?
TINA: Yeah.

00:05:32.968 --> 00:05:35.200
COTANT: So what's been going on?

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.000
And at that time, she
broke down, and says,

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.601
"Oh, my husband,
Dale, he made comments

00:05:41.701 --> 00:05:43.334
"that the first
train missed him,

00:05:43.434 --> 00:05:45.634
"but the second one wouldn't."

00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:47.367
TINA: (crying) Now I
don't know where he's at.

00:05:47.467 --> 00:05:48.367
COTANT: Okay.
TINA: Okay.

00:05:48.467 --> 00:05:50.567
COTANT: Is he out walking?

00:05:50.667 --> 00:05:51.868
TINA: Yeah.

00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:54.334
COTANT: The pickup's there.
TINA: Yeah, he's out walking.

00:05:54.434 --> 00:05:58.234
COTANT: Okay.
TINA: And I think he's suicidal.

00:05:58.334 --> 00:05:59.501
COTANT: All right.

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.834
I will look around
for Dale, okay?

00:06:01.934 --> 00:06:04.133
And if I find him
I'll bring him home.

00:06:04.234 --> 00:06:06.300
TINA: (crying) Oh, thank you.
COTANT: Okay?

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.567
 NARRATOR: The nightly
 routine gets set aside.

00:06:08.667 --> 00:06:10.801
 The search is on.

00:06:10.901 --> 00:06:13.968
COTANT: I just made
contact with a 10-12.

00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:16.801
She's advising that her husband

00:06:16.901 --> 00:06:19.300
has made some suicidal remarks

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.300
and that he's off
his medications.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.767
So we're gonna be out
looking for this 10-12.

00:06:25.868 --> 00:06:29.868
We didn't see anybody, so we
started going further out,

00:06:29.968 --> 00:06:32.734
and we went out to the
Union Pacific tracks.

00:06:32.834 --> 00:06:34.601
We're gonna head
up to the north,

00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:39.334
and see if maybe
he's up in that area.

00:06:39.434 --> 00:06:41.734
At that time, the
Scotts Bluff County

00:06:41.834 --> 00:06:43.934
Sheriff's Office
became involved.

00:06:44.033 --> 00:06:45.968
Hey, I, we've looked all over.

00:06:46.067 --> 00:06:48.167
I got Bear out east.

00:06:48.267 --> 00:06:49.234
And also with the
OFFICER: Hey, how you doing?

00:06:49.334 --> 00:06:50.467
COTANT: Nebraska State Patrol.
OFFICER: Okay.

00:06:50.567 --> 00:06:52.834
COTANT: Okay, you thought you
might've seen that guy?

00:06:52.934 --> 00:06:55.467
Everybody started looking in
different areas of the county,

00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:59.400
ended up the Nebraska
State Patrol found him

00:06:59.501 --> 00:07:05.200
three miles east of
Mitchell, on County Road G.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.033
 DISPATCHER: 20-12.

00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:09.567
COTANT: So
finally we arrived.

00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:11.934
OFFICER: All he wants to do is
walk to Scottsbluff,

00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:14.434
buy four packs of
cigarettes, and go home.

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:16.968
COTANT: (laughs) Okay, alrighty.

00:07:17.067 --> 00:07:19.567
I talked with Dale,
I've known Dale for

00:07:19.667 --> 00:07:22.868
probably 17, 18
years, since I started

00:07:22.968 --> 00:07:25.133
copping up here in Mitchell.

00:07:25.234 --> 00:07:26.567
I said, "You're not gonna
hurt yourself, right?"

00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:27.834
And he goes, "No."

00:07:27.934 --> 00:07:28.901
He says, "Well, I
tell you what, Dale,

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.234
"we'll just go down
there and we'll get you

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:33.767
"a couple packs of cigarettes."

00:07:33.868 --> 00:07:34.801
He said, "Okay."

00:07:34.901 --> 00:07:37.801
So we drove down
to Scottsbluff.

00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:41.367
I think it makes a
good public relations

00:07:41.467 --> 00:07:43.100
that I do something like that,
DALE: We got it.

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:48.033
COTANT: because there may be a
time that I may need him

00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:50.534
for something, and
he'll remember well,

00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:53.234
"Yeah, you know,
he did that for me.

00:07:53.334 --> 00:07:54.400
"He's a good cop."

00:07:57.901 --> 00:08:00.100
 NARRATOR: The city budget
 may be the best indication

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.367
 that Mitchell supports
 keeping its own police force.

00:08:03.467 --> 00:08:06.501
 It's 22% of the city's
 million dollar budget.

00:08:06.601 --> 00:08:09.234
 More than roads or
 parks or anything else.

00:08:09.334 --> 00:08:11.434
 Voters approved a
 sales tax increase,

00:08:11.534 --> 00:08:15.300
 in part to maintain
 local police coverage.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.167
BRIAN TAYLOR: Our guys are
busy all the time.

00:08:18.267 --> 00:08:20.934
And they're efficient.

00:08:21.033 --> 00:08:22.634
And they do a good job.

00:08:22.734 --> 00:08:23.567
 NARRATOR: There
 are the things

00:08:23.667 --> 00:08:25.367
 you'd expect from
 any department.

00:08:25.467 --> 00:08:27.000
 (radar beeps)

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.033
 Working radar.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.334
 The shoplifting and
 burglary reports.

00:08:30.434 --> 00:08:33.601
 Traffic accidents and
 security system false alarms.

00:08:33.701 --> 00:08:35.801
 (car driving away)

00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:37.167
COTANT:They were
testing the alarms,

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:40.133
and now we know it works.

00:08:40.234 --> 00:08:41.667
JEFF SPROCK: And one of the
biggest things

00:08:41.767 --> 00:08:44.033
that small town police
have to deal with

00:08:44.133 --> 00:08:47.334
that Scottsbluff
doesn't have to deal with

00:08:47.434 --> 00:08:49.567
or Lincoln has to do,
is nuisance abatement.

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.634
These poor guys, we are
on them all the time,

00:08:51.734 --> 00:08:55.400
on weeds, grass, and
junk in people's yards.

00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:56.467
That's not something
that somebody

00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:57.801
in Scottsbluff
has to deal with.

00:08:57.901 --> 00:08:59.133
COTANT: We are animal control.

00:08:59.234 --> 00:09:01.400
We do animal control.

00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:04.934
We've had a cat problem,
but here this last summer,

00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:07.067
they just, it's just exploded.

00:09:07.167 --> 00:09:10.868
I mean we've got feral
cats all over town.

00:09:10.968 --> 00:09:13.901
We put our live traps out.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.767
We had an incident
the other night,

00:09:15.868 --> 00:09:17.434
one of my officers
had to go over

00:09:17.534 --> 00:09:21.234
'cause a lady let a
cat out of a trap.

00:09:21.334 --> 00:09:22.200
OFFICER: You call us.
CITIZEN: Okay.

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:23.934
OFFICER: You do not mess
with our traps,

00:09:24.033 --> 00:09:25.267
okay?
CITIZEN: Okay, promise I won't.

00:09:25.367 --> 00:09:28.901
OFFICER: Because if you do, then
you're gonna look at charges.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.834
Do you understand that?
CITIZEN: Okay, yes.

00:09:29.934 --> 00:09:31.534
I promise I won't.

00:09:31.634 --> 00:09:34.701
OFFICER MANDY MURPHY:
Oh, I was looking for that
the other day. (laughs)

00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:36.467
 NARRATOR: Officer
 Mandy Murphy has been

00:09:36.567 --> 00:09:38.033
 in uniform for seven years,

00:09:38.133 --> 00:09:40.734
 four of those with the
 Mitchell Police Department.

00:09:40.834 --> 00:09:42.834
MURPHY: I like probably the most

00:09:42.934 --> 00:09:45.167
that every day is
something different.

00:09:45.267 --> 00:09:47.734
Like it's not just
the same thing

00:09:47.834 --> 00:09:50.701
and sitting in an
office all day.

00:09:50.801 --> 00:09:54.367
I'm constantly challenged by it.

00:09:54.467 --> 00:09:59.167
I prefer nights, just because
it's kind of different calls

00:09:59.267 --> 00:10:02.267
that you respond to
than during the day.

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:06.567
A lot of our disturbances
happen at night.

00:10:06.667 --> 00:10:09.200
I would say one of our
more dangerous calls

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:13.300
that we respond to are
domestic disturbances.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:14.634
 (gun magazine clicks)

00:10:14.734 --> 00:10:17.367
They like us to have more than
one officer respond to those,

00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:20.767
especially, because
they're a lot of times

00:10:20.868 --> 00:10:23.067
more dangerous than others.

00:10:25.434 --> 00:10:28.267
 NARRATOR: About 1,600
 people call Mitchell home.

00:10:28.367 --> 00:10:31.100
 One out of every four of the
 mass shootings in America

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.801
 took place in towns with
 fewer than 10,000 people.

00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:36.934
 Many of the smallest
 police departments

00:10:37.033 --> 00:10:40.133
 now recognize schools
 become targets.

00:10:40.234 --> 00:10:43.934
 In 2016, Nebraska state law
 required school districts,

00:10:44.033 --> 00:10:46.434
 big and small, to
 prepare safety plans

00:10:46.534 --> 00:10:48.734
 in partnership
 with local police.

00:10:48.834 --> 00:10:49.834
 (children chattering)

00:10:49.934 --> 00:10:51.667
COTANT: This drill we're
gonna do this afternoon

00:10:51.767 --> 00:10:55.167
helps the teachers know
what to do with their kids.

00:10:55.267 --> 00:10:59.567
TEACHER: Today when we practice,
they want us to do a lockdown,

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:02.467
which means that
we lock our rooms,

00:11:02.567 --> 00:11:04.567
okay, we pull our curtains,

00:11:04.667 --> 00:11:06.567
and we go to the safest
place in the room.

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:09.501
Where is the safest
place, do you think?

00:11:09.601 --> 00:11:10.334
You guys are sharp.

00:11:10.434 --> 00:11:11.901
You bet, over in the corner.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.601
COTANT: I mean it's secure.

00:11:13.701 --> 00:11:15.868
Getting in would
probably be easy,

00:11:15.968 --> 00:11:19.067
but going and getting
in one of the rooms,

00:11:19.167 --> 00:11:20.801
you're not getting in.

00:11:20.901 --> 00:11:22.767
PRINCIPAL: We have
three doors we've gotta lock.

00:11:22.868 --> 00:11:24.400
So that'd be it.

00:11:24.501 --> 00:11:26.434
TEACHER: I guess to me, the
lockdown of the outside doors

00:11:26.534 --> 00:11:27.567
are the priority.

00:11:27.667 --> 00:11:28.968
PRINCIPAL: We don't want parents
to come in there.

00:11:29.067 --> 00:11:31.133
MURPHY: I think it makes it
a lot more difficult

00:11:31.234 --> 00:11:32.801
when the kids are there.

00:11:32.901 --> 00:11:34.934
Just kinda seeing
their reaction,

00:11:35.033 --> 00:11:39.200
even to a drill, you can
tell they're a little unsure.

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.467
Just thinking about if a
real situation would happen,

00:11:42.567 --> 00:11:44.934
how they would react to that.

00:11:45.033 --> 00:11:46.501
COTANT: Things get a little
chaotic, you know.

00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:48.901
Especially if all the kids
are out in the hallway.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.267
And they say, "lockdown,
lockdown, lockdown."

00:11:51.367 --> 00:11:53.634
 (children chattering)
 (alarm chimes)

00:11:53.734 --> 00:11:54.767
PRINCIPAL: Please lockdown.

00:11:54.868 --> 00:11:56.334
Please lockdown right now.

00:11:59.067 --> 00:12:00.400
COTANT: Kids are
rushed into the rooms,

00:12:00.501 --> 00:12:02.400
doors are closed.

00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:03.234
TEACHER: Go ahead, quickly.

00:12:03.334 --> 00:12:04.901
Sit down, quick, quick, quick.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.367
COTANT: Their
lights are off.

00:12:06.467 --> 00:12:08.234
INSTRUCTOR: Shh,
everybody stay quiet.

00:12:08.334 --> 00:12:11.000
COTANT: They're in a certain
area of the room,

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:13.133
and they will not
open those doors

00:12:13.234 --> 00:12:16.801
until they are given
a clear signal.

00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:20.534
Which will come either from
myself or the principal.

00:12:20.634 --> 00:12:22.868
 (heartbeat thumping)

00:12:22.968 --> 00:12:25.667
 (door rattling)

00:12:25.767 --> 00:12:27.968
 (knocking on window)

00:12:28.067 --> 00:12:29.667
PRINCIPAL:
Okay, you can't see them.

00:12:29.767 --> 00:12:31.934
MURPHY: We're not gonna
wait for anybody.

00:12:32.033 --> 00:12:33.968
That's another
post-Columbine thing

00:12:34.067 --> 00:12:35.767
that went into
affect after that.

00:12:35.868 --> 00:12:38.601
Before that, they would
just call the SWAT team.

00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:41.634
But now, they have decided
that we need to go in.

00:12:41.734 --> 00:12:43.901
Even if it's just one officer.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.067
 (alarm ringing)
I think it's something

00:12:45.167 --> 00:12:48.133
that every officer
has to think about,

00:12:48.234 --> 00:12:49.400
when they go into it,

00:12:49.501 --> 00:12:52.067
is whether or not they'd
be able to do that

00:12:52.167 --> 00:12:54.968
and be able to make that choice

00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:57.934
if they have to
take somebody's life

00:12:58.033 --> 00:12:59.634
to help save other people.

00:13:04.434 --> 00:13:06.400
WEBB: It's scary
that we have to look at

00:13:06.501 --> 00:13:07.767
active shooter like we do now.

00:13:07.868 --> 00:13:10.467
Because that just tells you
the world we're living in.

00:13:10.567 --> 00:13:13.534
But I think the training, the
way we're doing the training,

00:13:13.634 --> 00:13:17.834
is a step forward.
 (gun shots fired)

00:13:17.934 --> 00:13:21.167
BRENDA URBANEK: Columbine
changed how officers responded

00:13:21.267 --> 00:13:24.467
to horrific events
like an active shooter.

00:13:24.567 --> 00:13:26.234
Almost every community that has

00:13:26.334 --> 00:13:28.300
a police department
has a school.

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.634
And in the last 20 years,
people have recognized

00:13:31.734 --> 00:13:35.000
that if you truly wanna
hit Americans hard,

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:36.033
you hit the school.

00:13:36.133 --> 00:13:38.400
Because everybody
cares about the kids.

00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:43.334
Whatever the reason is,
the act is gonna require

00:13:43.434 --> 00:13:46.434
that local department
to be prepared.

00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:49.033
 NARRATOR: Only recently
 did Nebraska's Law Enforcement

00:13:49.133 --> 00:13:51.901
 Training Center require
 active shooter training

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.434
 for every Nebraska police
 officer or sheriff's deputy

00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:57.234
 wanting to wear the badge.

00:13:57.334 --> 00:13:58.601
 Some call it active shooter,

00:13:58.701 --> 00:14:00.701
 some call it active killer.
 (gun fires)

00:14:00.801 --> 00:14:03.567
MIKE KERBY: It was
traditionally, that
was a SWAT call response.

00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:05.133
You waited for SWAT to show up,

00:14:05.234 --> 00:14:07.534
and Columbine showed
us that's probably,

00:14:07.634 --> 00:14:10.367
needed to be looked at and
that needed to be changed.

00:14:12.234 --> 00:14:13.901
 NARRATOR: Several
 Nebraska police departments,

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.200
 large and small, have
 specially-trained

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.934
 tactical units on
 standby, ready to deploy.

00:14:20.033 --> 00:14:22.067
 It takes time to
 gather those teams.

00:14:22.167 --> 00:14:25.367
 The small town cops may
 not have that time to wait.

00:14:25.467 --> 00:14:27.167
OFFICER: Freeze.

00:14:27.267 --> 00:14:29.601
KERBY: We're asking law
enforcement officers now,

00:14:29.701 --> 00:14:31.601
city, county, state,
doesn't make any difference,

00:14:31.701 --> 00:14:34.567
the ones that are on
the beat are now tasked

00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:37.234
with more responsibility
than has ever occurred

00:14:37.334 --> 00:14:39.234
in the history of
American law enforcement,

00:14:39.334 --> 00:14:40.734
as far as I'm concerned.

00:14:40.834 --> 00:14:42.868
Did you do fire drills
when you were in school?

00:14:42.968 --> 00:14:44.467
How many kids have
been killed in a fire

00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:47.334
in a school in the United
States in the last 25 years?

00:14:47.434 --> 00:14:48.834
I'll answer it for you.

00:14:48.934 --> 00:14:49.934
None.

00:14:50.033 --> 00:14:51.200
There are still
schools that do not do

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:52.501
active-shooter-based training.

00:14:52.601 --> 00:14:54.300
And that number is not zero.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.267
We all know that in here.

00:14:56.367 --> 00:14:57.734
 NARRATOR: Officers
 in training learn

00:14:57.834 --> 00:14:59.167
 how to approach a scene safely

00:14:59.267 --> 00:15:01.934
 and how to analyze
 the risk going in.

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:04.968
 Weeks of classroom work
 and field demonstrations

00:15:05.067 --> 00:15:08.534
 proceed the live-fire
 active shooter exercise.

00:15:08.634 --> 00:15:10.968
KERBY: Through the teachings
here, we teach them how to

00:15:11.067 --> 00:15:15.200
aggressively yet safely move
towards the sound of gunfire,

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:17.601
rather than to hold and
wait for somebody else

00:15:17.701 --> 00:15:20.701
with bigger guns and more
body armor to come protect it.

00:15:20.801 --> 00:15:22.601
PRESTON: Move in!
OFFICER: Go.

00:15:22.701 --> 00:15:24.234
OFFICER REGINA PRESTON: For
me it was an intense training

00:15:24.334 --> 00:15:28.400
to show how to do something
the right way, and safely.

00:15:28.501 --> 00:15:31.033
How your body
reacts, how your mind

00:15:31.133 --> 00:15:32.934
and everything reacts, it's a,

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:36.167
it was a good learning
experience to go through.

00:15:36.267 --> 00:15:39.267
 NARRATOR: Regina Preston
 arrived from
 Mitchell, Nebraska,

00:15:39.367 --> 00:15:41.567
 hoping to fill that
 fourth position

00:15:41.667 --> 00:15:43.501
 on her hometown department.

00:15:43.601 --> 00:15:44.734
PRESTON: Go!

00:15:44.834 --> 00:15:45.901
INSTRUCTOR: There you go.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.133
Now you are the only
insurance policy they've got.

00:15:48.234 --> 00:15:49.200
PRESTON: You know, this
is what we learn.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.868
This is what we did.

00:15:50.968 --> 00:15:52.567
This is what goes
on on the street.

00:15:52.667 --> 00:15:54.934
It's not a movie,
it's not a show.

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:57.334
It's hard work,
it's determination.

00:15:57.434 --> 00:16:00.200
And you're a target.

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:05.734
KERBY: They are now tasked with
going into a rapidly-evolving,

00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:08.868
very violent situation,
and if need be,

00:16:08.968 --> 00:16:14.434
hunt down and neutralize
an aggressive behavior.

00:16:14.534 --> 00:16:17.033
That's just not typically
what police officers do.

00:16:17.133 --> 00:16:18.501
MARK STEPHENSON: So what are
your priorities?

00:16:18.601 --> 00:16:21.734
Your priority needs to be
whatever the shooter is doing.

00:16:21.834 --> 00:16:22.701
That's your priority.

00:16:22.801 --> 00:16:23.801
Stop the killing.

00:16:23.901 --> 00:16:25.801
Is the number one priority
for active shooter.

00:16:25.901 --> 00:16:27.767
 NARRATOR: Once the
 classroom work is complete,

00:16:27.868 --> 00:16:31.000
 plastic safety pistols are
 replaced by loaded guns,

00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:34.033
 for an intense day of
 real-time exercises

00:16:34.133 --> 00:16:35.801
 in a vacant office building.

00:16:35.901 --> 00:16:38.367
STEPHENSON: The goal of today is
to put them in a scenario

00:16:38.467 --> 00:16:40.534
we call stress inoculation,
we're exposing them

00:16:40.634 --> 00:16:44.133
to a high-stress situation.
 (gun shots fired)

00:16:44.234 --> 00:16:45.767
 NARRATOR: Small
 groups are thrown into

00:16:45.868 --> 00:16:48.767
 unpredictable scenarios,
 facing gunfire.

00:16:48.868 --> 00:16:52.400
 (gun clicks)

00:16:52.501 --> 00:16:55.000
 Weapons filled with
 non-lethal rounds,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.000
 (gun clicks)

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.434
simulated ammunition that sting

00:17:00.534 --> 00:17:02.534
 and make an impression
 on body and mind.

00:17:02.634 --> 00:17:05.734
MAN: Help. I'm...
 (gun shots fired)

00:17:05.834 --> 00:17:06.868
RANDI WEBB: It's a whole
different world

00:17:06.968 --> 00:17:08.901
when there's actual
projectiles coming at you.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.734
And it's amazing, because
even being the role-player,

00:17:11.834 --> 00:17:13.901
I get jacked up when
they come down the hall.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.167
 (gun shots fired)

00:17:16.267 --> 00:17:18.267
WOMAN: Gonna kill everybody!

00:17:18.367 --> 00:17:19.767
MAN: Stop! Stop!
 (guns clicking)

00:17:19.868 --> 00:17:21.501
 NARRATOR: They never
 know what they're getting
 themselves into.

00:17:21.601 --> 00:17:22.567
MAN: Help, help, help.

00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:24.000
 (gun shots fired)

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.701
KERBY:: We also ask them,
if necessary, to walk past

00:17:25.801 --> 00:17:27.100
MAN: Help me!

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.367
KERBY:
injured or dying people, to
hunt down that individual.

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:32.667
OFFICER: Don't move!

00:17:32.767 --> 00:17:34.801
 NARRATOR: In a crisis, small
 town cops find themselves

00:17:34.901 --> 00:17:36.601
 suddenly thrown
 together with officers

00:17:36.701 --> 00:17:38.667
 from neighboring
 cities and counties.

00:17:38.767 --> 00:17:41.968
 Similar training helps
 an impromptu team

00:17:42.067 --> 00:17:43.734
 deal with the unexpected.

00:17:43.834 --> 00:17:45.300
 There may be a hostage.

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:46.801
 A suicide threat.

00:17:46.901 --> 00:17:48.033
 An ambush.

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:51.367
 (gun clicks)

00:17:51.467 --> 00:17:52.534
WEBB:
When I'm encountering them,

00:17:52.634 --> 00:17:54.701
you see the pure
terror in their face

00:17:54.801 --> 00:17:56.367
when they round that
corner and see somebody

00:17:56.467 --> 00:17:59.267
with an actual gun that's
gonna shoot something at them.

00:17:59.367 --> 00:18:02.033
 (people yelling frantically)

00:18:02.133 --> 00:18:03.334
 NARRATOR: Occasionally,
 teams remained

00:18:03.434 --> 00:18:07.234
 remarkably focused, as the
 chaos of the drill unfolds.

00:18:07.334 --> 00:18:08.801
KERBY: They moved as
a trained unison,

00:18:08.901 --> 00:18:12.200
they moved into position,
and if they did things right,

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.934
the person that was
neutralized was the bad guy.

00:18:15.033 --> 00:18:17.501
If they were hit, they took
non-life-threatening wounds,

00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:18.868
because they did the training

00:18:18.968 --> 00:18:20.634
as they were
prescribed to do that.

00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:22.634
As you saw, the vast majority
of them did a great job.

00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:24.033
They come in, they did it,
MAN: Don't shoot!

00:18:24.133 --> 00:18:25.734
KERBY: And there
was no hesitation.

00:18:25.834 --> 00:18:27.901
INSTRUCTOR: Neither one of our
hostages got hit.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:28.801
They weren't laying
on the floor,

00:18:28.901 --> 00:18:29.968
so they didn't get
hit, that's good,

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:31.934
you recognized and
processed that information,

00:18:32.033 --> 00:18:33.601
took out the shooter only.

00:18:33.701 --> 00:18:36.200
 NARRATOR: Some find the
 intensity disorienting.

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.234
 They forget the drills and the
 classroom advice.

00:18:38.334 --> 00:18:39.334
OFFICER: I'm out, I'm out.

00:18:39.434 --> 00:18:40.767
 (gun fires)

00:18:40.868 --> 00:18:43.834
WEBB: When you actually
put a live firearm

00:18:43.934 --> 00:18:45.534
with the sim rounds in on it,

00:18:45.634 --> 00:18:49.634
you see they get
that adrenaline dump.

00:18:49.734 --> 00:18:50.801
STEPHENSON:
The adrenaline in stress

00:18:50.901 --> 00:18:53.567
is the main cause for
most of the errors.

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:55.968
The stress will
cause the mistakes.

00:18:56.067 --> 00:18:57.868
PRESTON: There was a lot that
caught you off-guard.

00:18:57.968 --> 00:18:59.234
When you get shot
at, you're being,

00:18:59.334 --> 00:19:00.467
I mean, you know it's coming,

00:19:00.567 --> 00:19:04.601
but you're not real sure
from where sometimes.

00:19:04.701 --> 00:19:07.601
 NARRATOR: Officer Preston's
 team started out strong.

00:19:07.701 --> 00:19:09.267
WOMAN: So what
can we do for you?

00:19:09.367 --> 00:19:10.501
What's going on?

00:19:10.601 --> 00:19:13.033
 NARRATOR: But negotiations
 with a freaked-out woman

00:19:13.133 --> 00:19:15.767
 using a human shield
 seemed fruitless.

00:19:15.868 --> 00:19:17.567
WOMAN: Take it, take the
shot, take the shot.

00:19:17.667 --> 00:19:18.801
 NARRATOR: Then a team member
WOMAN: Do it!

00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:20.234
 NARRATOR: deviates from
 training,
WOMAN: Do it!

00:19:20.334 --> 00:19:21.534
 NARRATOR: stepping
 into the doorway,

00:19:21.634 --> 00:19:22.767
 NARRATOR: unsure if he should
 use
WOMAN: Do it!

00:19:22.868 --> 00:19:24.067
 NARRATOR: civilians to steady
WOMAN: Shoot me.

00:19:24.167 --> 00:19:25.367
 NARRATOR: his firearm.
WOMAN: Shoot me, shoot me.

00:19:25.467 --> 00:19:27.767
10, nine.
OFFICER: Get in there, get in
there,

00:19:27.868 --> 00:19:28.767
go get him.
WOMAN: Eight.

00:19:28.868 --> 00:19:33.634
 (gun shots fired)

00:19:33.734 --> 00:19:35.100
STEPHENSON: You're murdered.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.767
Real life, you're owned.

00:19:38.868 --> 00:19:40.234
That was some of
the stupidest shit

00:19:40.334 --> 00:19:42.534
I've ever seen in
my entire life.

00:19:42.634 --> 00:19:44.901
You guys were told
and told and told,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.901
you don't, I even
demonstrated this.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.701
Did I not?

00:19:49.801 --> 00:19:51.901
PARTICIPANT: For--
STEPHENSON: For this.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.767
It was a hostage situation,

00:19:53.868 --> 00:19:55.267
she's trying to negotiate,

00:19:55.367 --> 00:19:56.968
and you're standing
up here with your gun

00:19:57.067 --> 00:19:59.701
on Molden's shoulder,
and she's taunting you,

00:19:59.801 --> 00:20:01.868
and you're still standing there.

00:20:01.968 --> 00:20:05.534
You killed a hostage,
you haven't done shit.

00:20:05.634 --> 00:20:07.968
That is not how we work that.

00:20:08.067 --> 00:20:10.300
PRESTON:
It drills into your brain.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.167
If they talk sweet and
gentle and sensitive,

00:20:13.267 --> 00:20:14.634
you're gonna forget it.

00:20:14.734 --> 00:20:15.868
KERBY: Life's not nice.
STEPHENSON:
If you can't help yourself,

00:20:15.968 --> 00:20:17.467
KERBY: You could get yourself
shot, how nice is that?

00:20:17.567 --> 00:20:20.567
If you cause somebody else to
get shot, how nice is that?

00:20:20.667 --> 00:20:21.467
Other than
themselves,

00:20:21.567 --> 00:20:22.934
we are the most harsh critics.

00:20:23.033 --> 00:20:24.033
STEPHENSON:
You were gonna shoot somebody.

00:20:24.133 --> 00:20:26.434
If I ever see you in a
scenario like that again,

00:20:26.534 --> 00:20:29.367
holster your gun and go,
"Well, you got me, I'm out,"

00:20:29.467 --> 00:20:32.701
I will call your agency
and I will tell them

00:20:32.801 --> 00:20:35.300
that you are not
ready for this job.

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.868
URBANEK: One of the biggest
killers of cops is apathy.

00:20:38.968 --> 00:20:41.300
And, well, it's complacency.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:42.767
It's never gonna happen here.

00:20:42.868 --> 00:20:45.701
It's never happened here, so
it's never gonna happen here.

00:20:48.534 --> 00:20:49.434
 NARRATOR: When
 the legislature

00:20:49.534 --> 00:20:51.234
 set up the state's
 training center,

00:20:51.334 --> 00:20:53.801
 only about 12% of
 police officers

00:20:53.901 --> 00:20:57.234
 and sheriff's deputies
 received any formal training.

00:20:57.334 --> 00:21:00.601
 If a local agency did
 train, every police chief

00:21:00.701 --> 00:21:03.100
 and sheriff used
 different methods.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:05.534
URBANEK: I've been in law
enforcement for 35 years,

00:21:05.634 --> 00:21:08.334
and when I started
in law enforcement,

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:11.534
it was not an uncommon
event to hear people say,

00:21:11.634 --> 00:21:14.601
"Yeah, they hired me Tuesday,
gave me the keys to the car,

00:21:14.701 --> 00:21:18.634
"and a gun and a badge, and
told me to go drive around."

00:21:18.734 --> 00:21:22.701
Now, we have gradually
gravitated away from that.

00:21:22.801 --> 00:21:26.467
But it's still possible for
people to go out and work

00:21:26.567 --> 00:21:30.767
for almost a year without
having any academy training.

00:21:30.868 --> 00:21:33.234
 NARRATOR: Omaha, Lincoln,
 and the Nebraska State Patrol

00:21:33.334 --> 00:21:35.334
 all have their own
 basic training.

00:21:35.434 --> 00:21:37.801
 Every other agency,
 the smallest departments,

00:21:37.901 --> 00:21:40.000
 send their new officers here.

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.033
WOMAN: Ready.

00:21:41.133 --> 00:21:42.601
 NARRATOR: Diversity
 remains an issue,

00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:45.400
 especially in
 rural departments.

00:21:45.501 --> 00:21:48.100
 Figures on minority
 officers aren't available,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.234
 but training
 classes rarely match

00:21:50.334 --> 00:21:53.067
 Nebraska's racial and
 cultural diversity.

00:21:53.167 --> 00:21:57.000
 In towns under
 5,000, less than 5%

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.868
 of the sworn police
 officers are women.

00:21:59.968 --> 00:22:02.467
WEBB: When we're fighting for
our weapon, guys, we never stop.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.601
Never stop.

00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:06.868
Right there for us.

00:22:06.968 --> 00:22:08.234
 NARRATOR:
 Instructor Randi Webb

00:22:08.334 --> 00:22:09.968
 trained here as
 a rookie officer

00:22:10.067 --> 00:22:12.133
 with the Grand Island
 Police Department.

00:22:12.234 --> 00:22:14.534
 She was in class 156.

00:22:14.634 --> 00:22:16.868
 The academy recently
 graduated class 200.

00:22:16.968 --> 00:22:19.868
WEBB: When you feel them--
 NARRATOR: She sees
 similarities.

00:22:19.968 --> 00:22:22.000
RANDI WEBB:
I see naive people.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:24.133
You don't realize all the
stuff you're gonna see.

00:22:24.234 --> 00:22:26.100
And you don't realize how
people can treat each other

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.634
and how they can treat you,

00:22:27.734 --> 00:22:29.534
and that just comes
with the experience

00:22:29.634 --> 00:22:30.400
of being on the street.

00:22:30.501 --> 00:22:31.968
TRAINEE: Wanna wake up?
MAN: Yes.

00:22:32.067 --> 00:22:34.067
 NARRATOR: There is
 training for the daily routine

00:22:34.167 --> 00:22:36.133
 and training for
 the extraordinary.

00:22:36.234 --> 00:22:39.534
 Today, it's searching a
building for an armed intruder.

00:22:39.634 --> 00:22:42.033
WEBB: We've been taught you can
do active shooter situations

00:22:42.133 --> 00:22:44.234
as a one-person team,
going in by yourself

00:22:44.334 --> 00:22:47.334
and just hunting down
where you need to go.

00:22:47.434 --> 00:22:49.701
But you put yourself
in their shoes.

00:22:49.801 --> 00:22:51.434
Running into a
situation where you know

00:22:51.534 --> 00:22:53.200
somebody is actively
shooting people,

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.133
actively hunting people down,

00:22:55.234 --> 00:22:59.033
and your confidence level,
that adrenaline rush,

00:22:59.133 --> 00:23:01.234
that fear, it's gonna be there.

00:23:01.334 --> 00:23:02.267
MIKE KERBY:
Drill's quite simple.

00:23:02.367 --> 00:23:04.434
We put multiple people
in different rooms,

00:23:04.534 --> 00:23:06.801
that if you move
at an adequate pace

00:23:06.901 --> 00:23:08.534
you should be able to see them,

00:23:08.634 --> 00:23:09.634
and we have them
walk the hallway,

00:23:09.734 --> 00:23:11.601
and they call out
those that they see.

00:23:11.701 --> 00:23:13.267
TRAINEE: Contact.

00:23:13.367 --> 00:23:14.634
Contact.

00:23:14.734 --> 00:23:17.367
KERBY: When they turn around,
and I ask the rest to step out,

00:23:17.467 --> 00:23:19.801
they realize they
were moving too fast,

00:23:19.901 --> 00:23:21.834
when they looked left, they
should've been looking right.

00:23:21.934 --> 00:23:24.267
They understand that
if they can get help,

00:23:24.367 --> 00:23:25.367
it's all the best.

00:23:25.467 --> 00:23:27.133
STEPHENSON:
So now you have to decide.

00:23:27.234 --> 00:23:30.067
Do I take the speed and get
to the end of the hallway,

00:23:30.167 --> 00:23:31.834
save the people
that are being shot,

00:23:31.934 --> 00:23:34.367
or do I go slow down this
hallway to ensure that

00:23:34.467 --> 00:23:36.334
I find anybody that
may be in the room,

00:23:36.434 --> 00:23:37.801
threat or no threat?

00:23:37.901 --> 00:23:39.767
What's important now.

00:23:39.868 --> 00:23:41.200
And that's a decision
you have to make.

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.067
That's the reason
that going into this

00:23:43.167 --> 00:23:45.334
by yourself is
such a hard choice.

00:23:48.834 --> 00:23:50.868
WEBB: The stress level, you
hear it in their breathing,

00:23:50.968 --> 00:23:53.501
you hear their voice
if they try talking.

00:23:53.601 --> 00:23:56.167
You visibly see them, as
they're going through it.

00:23:56.267 --> 00:23:59.267
It's a huge amount of stress
for one person to go through.

00:23:59.367 --> 00:24:00.901
INSTRUCTOR:
Preston, you're up next.
TRAINEE: Yep.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.901
 (intense music)

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.400
PRESTON: And going in in
that situation,

00:24:03.501 --> 00:24:05.601
you don't have a cover officer,

00:24:05.701 --> 00:24:08.133
you don't have six set of
eyes in that situation,

00:24:08.234 --> 00:24:09.767
you have your own two.

00:24:09.868 --> 00:24:11.400
So you miss things.

00:24:11.501 --> 00:24:13.767
It's scary, I'm not gonna lie.

00:24:13.868 --> 00:24:14.801
It is scary.

00:24:14.901 --> 00:24:16.467
It's a scary thought
to think that

00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:18.000
it's gonna happen in our town.

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.601
Put your hands up,
lemme see them.

00:24:19.701 --> 00:24:20.801
INSTRUCTOR: Keep moving.

00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:22.634
PRESTON: Unrealistic or not,

00:24:22.734 --> 00:24:25.133
it's still an eye-opener.

00:24:25.234 --> 00:24:26.601
And it was a good training.

00:24:26.701 --> 00:24:29.167
And to get to the
end and see how many

00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:31.267
vital things you missed,

00:24:31.367 --> 00:24:35.400
INSTRUCTOR: Bad guys, step out.

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:39.934
PRESTON: And why do I go in?

00:24:40.033 --> 00:24:42.734
Because there's lives at stake.

00:24:42.834 --> 00:24:45.167
There's kids at stake,
whether it's a school

00:24:45.267 --> 00:24:47.434
or a bank, it doesn't matter.

00:24:47.534 --> 00:24:48.767
That's my job.

00:24:50.234 --> 00:24:51.400
 NARRATOR: The Mitchell
 Police Department

00:24:51.501 --> 00:24:54.100
 has been shorthanded
 for almost four years.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.601
 It was a gift to
 have Officer Preston,

00:24:56.701 --> 00:25:00.067
 who lives in town, eager
 to fill the empty position.

00:25:00.167 --> 00:25:02.701
 Recruiting new cops
 can become a chore.

00:25:02.801 --> 00:25:06.300
JEFF SPROCK:
So if you can develop local
talent, it is just gold.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.100
I'm just really excited.

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:11.901
It's kinda neat to see the
kinda the Regina Preston story

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.067
happen here, where she
was just a citizen,

00:25:14.167 --> 00:25:16.400
was wanting to maybe get
involved in law enforcement,

00:25:16.501 --> 00:25:19.100
and then the city went ahead
and paid for her education

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:21.267
and now she's got a
long-term future here.

00:25:21.367 --> 00:25:22.100
PRESTON: Henry.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:22.934
I wanted to work in Mitchell.

00:25:23.033 --> 00:25:24.534
My family's here.

00:25:24.634 --> 00:25:26.334
My husband and I moved here.

00:25:26.434 --> 00:25:28.133
So I guess you could say,
for the last six years,

00:25:28.234 --> 00:25:29.868
our life has been here.

00:25:29.968 --> 00:25:33.968
The community has grown on
me over the past few years.

00:25:34.067 --> 00:25:35.501
And I like it here.

00:25:35.601 --> 00:25:36.634
It's like a Mayberry.

00:25:36.734 --> 00:25:37.968
Everybody knows everybody,

00:25:38.067 --> 00:25:42.033
and if they don't, they
find out who they are.

00:25:42.133 --> 00:25:43.334
PRESENTER: Officer
Regina Preston,

00:25:43.434 --> 00:25:45.033
Mitchell Police Department.

00:25:45.133 --> 00:25:47.033
 NARRATOR: She'd been
 on the job for a year.

00:25:47.133 --> 00:25:49.467
 Now certified by
 the training center,

00:25:49.567 --> 00:25:52.467
 she takes on full
 responsibilities.

00:25:52.567 --> 00:25:56.300
 It's a proud day, clouded
 by an unexpected setback.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.634
PRESTON: I broke my foot.

00:25:58.734 --> 00:26:01.701
I broke the fifth
metatarsal in my foot.

00:26:01.801 --> 00:26:08.267
And it was horrible
the day of graduation,

00:26:08.367 --> 00:26:11.467
because I couldn't
walk with my class.

00:26:11.567 --> 00:26:14.601
So that was tough.

00:26:14.701 --> 00:26:16.167
But I graduated.

00:26:16.267 --> 00:26:18.167
KID: Look what happened
to her foot.

00:26:18.267 --> 00:26:19.501
MAN: I know.
PRESTON: Yeah, yeah.

00:26:19.601 --> 00:26:20.434
PRESTON: I'm
determined, though.

00:26:20.534 --> 00:26:23.067
I'm determined to
get back out there.

00:26:23.167 --> 00:26:24.868
SPROCK: It is a huge crisis,
because it's a fourth

00:26:24.968 --> 00:26:27.200
of our police department
that we just lost, right?

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.000
And so Mike's gonna end
up having to work 70 hours

00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:32.300
a couple of weeks, to cover
for a situation like that.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.868
So it's a huge deal.

00:26:35.667 --> 00:26:37.234
 NARRATOR: Unable
 to do street patrol

00:26:37.334 --> 00:26:39.133
 on her own for several weeks,

00:26:39.234 --> 00:26:41.734
 Officer Preston handles
 administrative duties

00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:45.701
and, when possible, accompanies
 Chief Cotant on patrol,

00:26:45.801 --> 00:26:48.300
 testing the skills she
 learned at the academy.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.601
MIKE COTANT: They do a great
job down there.

00:26:49.701 --> 00:26:52.400
I can't say anything
bad about it.

00:26:52.501 --> 00:26:56.334
But until you're actually
out on the streets,

00:26:56.434 --> 00:26:58.200
it's a whole different thing.

00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:01.534
I mean, it's like,
they tell you how

00:27:01.634 --> 00:27:05.200
to approach the situation,
a certain situation,

00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:09.501
but yet it may not be
the actual way to do it.

00:27:09.601 --> 00:27:12.234
 (bluesy music)

00:27:12.334 --> 00:27:13.234
 NARRATOR: Making the rounds,

00:27:13.334 --> 00:27:15.434
 the chief spots a
 Mitchell resident

00:27:15.534 --> 00:27:17.934
 he knows has his
 driver's license revoked.

00:27:18.033 --> 00:27:20.734
COTANT: He knows, he knows.

00:27:20.834 --> 00:27:23.434
When I see this gentleman,
and I'm thinking,

00:27:23.534 --> 00:27:25.501
"You've got to be kidding me."

00:27:28.534 --> 00:27:30.901
I ain't got any
citations with me.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.100
 NARRATOR: It's a routine
 stop for a fairly
 minor offense.

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.100
COTANT: He pulled
over without me

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:37.734
even turning on the lights.

00:27:37.834 --> 00:27:39.534
 NARRATOR: Even when
 you're on a first-name basis

00:27:39.634 --> 00:27:42.133
 with the driver, you
 never know when something

00:27:42.234 --> 00:27:44.334
 may go alarmingly off-script.

00:27:44.434 --> 00:27:48.467
 The driver gets a fresh
 driving-while-suspended
 citation.

00:27:48.567 --> 00:27:49.667
 The truck will be towed.

00:27:49.767 --> 00:27:52.634
 Everybody sticks to the
 script and no problem.

00:27:52.734 --> 00:27:56.534
COTANT: So after that was
over, I asked Regina,

00:27:56.634 --> 00:28:00.934
Officer Preston, I said,
"So," I said, "Critique me."

00:28:01.033 --> 00:28:03.200
I said, "What'd I do?"

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:04.634
Okay, what'd I do wrong?

00:28:06.434 --> 00:28:07.901
PRESTON: Are you asking me
to critique you or--

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.400
COTANT: Yes I am.

00:28:09.501 --> 00:28:12.667
PRESTON: For my chief to ask
me to critique him,

00:28:12.767 --> 00:28:14.567
it was kind of a
prideful moment.

00:28:14.667 --> 00:28:16.868
I kinda got excited,
I'm like, "Really."

00:28:16.968 --> 00:28:18.834
Well, you didn't call it in.

00:28:18.934 --> 00:28:20.701
COTANT: Well yeah, that's true.
PRESTON: You didn't confirm it.

00:28:20.801 --> 00:28:21.534
COTANT: Yeah.

00:28:21.634 --> 00:28:23.567
PRESTON: Then you got the
license.

00:28:23.667 --> 00:28:26.000
You didn't ask for the
license of the passenger,

00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.200
when you knew that he wasn't

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.801
COTANT: Well.
PRESTON: driving under
suspension.

00:28:28.901 --> 00:28:30.267
COTANT: Yeah.

00:28:30.367 --> 00:28:32.234
See, I'm doing all things wrong.

00:28:32.334 --> 00:28:35.834
That's a good critique.

00:28:35.934 --> 00:28:38.567
PRESTON: You weren't prepared
for--
COTANT: No, I wasn't. (laughs)

00:28:38.667 --> 00:28:41.067
PRESTON: Any stop.
COTANT: No, I was not.

00:28:41.167 --> 00:28:44.901
PRESTON:
And that's one thing that
they really pushed learning,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.100
up at the academy, this
is how you need to do it,

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.033
this is how I
expect you to do it.

00:28:49.133 --> 00:28:51.100
This is where you park, this
is when you light 'em up,

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.801
this is when you call it out,

00:28:53.901 --> 00:28:55.467
this is when, how you approach,

00:28:55.567 --> 00:28:57.133
this, I mean all these
different things.

00:28:57.234 --> 00:28:59.300
So with me sitting back after
getting out of the academy

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.300
learning all of this, and
watching someone else,

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.267
I can honestly say,
"That's not right."

00:29:06.367 --> 00:29:08.534
COTANT: But you know, I mean,
it's a good thing for me.

00:29:08.634 --> 00:29:10.067
To be critiqued.

00:29:10.167 --> 00:29:13.200
'Cause I do, I'm human.

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:16.400
I miss things.

00:29:16.501 --> 00:29:20.200
She was a pretty blunt
force to me. (laughs)

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:24.234
That gives her I think
a sense of belonging

00:29:24.334 --> 00:29:27.801
and that she's sharing
her knowledge with me.

00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:32.300
And I'm looking to the
future, and down the road,

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:35.200
after I leave here, in
about a year and a half,

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.968
maybe two, that the city's
gonna be in good hands.

00:29:44.968 --> 00:29:46.734
SCHNELL: I just have a
front radar so I can

00:29:46.834 --> 00:29:48.367
catch people coming at me.

00:29:48.467 --> 00:29:50.968
 NARRATOR: A speeding ticket
 may be the most common way

00:29:51.067 --> 00:29:55.734
 to meet a sheriff's deputy in
 one of Nebraska's 93 counties.

00:29:55.834 --> 00:29:58.467
SCHNELL:
I try to stay consistent,
so that way I go into court

00:29:58.567 --> 00:30:00.267
and say, "Yep, everybody
over 10 and above

00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:02.567
"gets a ticket, no matter what."

00:30:02.667 --> 00:30:03.701
DRIVER: I'm sorry,
I'm just a little--

00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:04.434
SCHNELL: You were under 10
over, how 'bout that?

00:30:04.534 --> 00:30:06.133
I'll tell you that.

00:30:06.234 --> 00:30:08.167
Between five and 10 over.

00:30:08.267 --> 00:30:10.934
 NARRATOR: There are days
 even a routine traffic stop

00:30:11.033 --> 00:30:13.934
 takes an unexpected,
 even dangerous turn.

00:30:14.033 --> 00:30:15.534
 The Law Enforcement
 Training Center

00:30:15.634 --> 00:30:18.567
 prepares new officers
 for those days.

00:30:18.667 --> 00:30:21.567
 (sirens wailing)
 (lively music)

00:30:21.667 --> 00:30:23.767
 Might be some guy with
 an outstanding warrant

00:30:23.868 --> 00:30:25.734
 or a trunk full of
 pot, who figures

00:30:25.834 --> 00:30:28.400
 his car can outrun
 a deputy sheriff.

00:30:28.501 --> 00:30:30.501
 Off they go, barreling
 down any of the

00:30:30.601 --> 00:30:32.901
 thousands of miles
 of two-lane blacktop

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.167
 or narrow gravel roads.

00:30:35.267 --> 00:30:37.267
NATHAN PHIPPS:
Went through driver's ed,
but they don't teach you

00:30:37.367 --> 00:30:39.400
this type of stuff,
you know? (laughs)

00:30:39.501 --> 00:30:40.801
 NARRATOR: The
 twisty test track

00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:44.234
 behind the training center may
 be the only practice they get

00:30:44.334 --> 00:30:47.400
 before a real pursuit
 back in their home county.

00:30:47.501 --> 00:30:49.300
ALEX PAYTON:
A lotta people would look,
okay, they're teaching

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.801
a police officer to go fast.

00:30:50.901 --> 00:30:51.701
They're teaching
a police officer

00:30:51.801 --> 00:30:53.167
to catch the bad guy faster.

00:30:53.267 --> 00:30:55.734
Well, it's not all
that, in my opinion.

00:30:55.834 --> 00:30:58.734
I believe they're teaching
us to do it in a safe manner.

00:30:58.834 --> 00:31:00.501
To where we can take a turn,

00:31:00.601 --> 00:31:02.234
we can accelerate
on a straightaway,

00:31:02.334 --> 00:31:04.367
we can close the gap
between ourselves

00:31:04.467 --> 00:31:08.000
and the pursuing vehicle
efficiently but also safely,

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.767
so we're not putting
ourselves, our partner,

00:31:11.868 --> 00:31:14.701
the individual suspect that
we're chasing in danger,

00:31:14.801 --> 00:31:16.501
and most importantly,
we're not putting

00:31:16.601 --> 00:31:19.934
either pedestrians and
third parties in danger.

00:31:20.033 --> 00:31:21.234
 (pounding on roof)

00:31:21.334 --> 00:31:23.000
 NARRATOR: After
 sunset comes a final,

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.667
 white-knuckle pursuit before
 the student officers graduate.

00:31:26.767 --> 00:31:30.300
 Their only friend will be
 the voice of a dispatcher.

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.200
DISPATCHER:
9307, NSP is in the area.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:37.267
Where would you like
them to place spikes?

00:31:37.367 --> 00:31:38.934
OFFICER: The dirt.

00:31:39.033 --> 00:31:39.934
DISPATCHER: I'm going to need

00:31:40.033 --> 00:31:43.501
a more specific
location than the dirt.

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:45.033
 NARRATOR: A
 high-speed chase brings

00:31:45.133 --> 00:31:47.334
 a special kind of
 terror when somebody's

00:31:47.434 --> 00:31:49.400
 desperate to avoid arrest.

00:31:49.501 --> 00:31:52.000
 Every sheriff in Nebraska
 knows what it's like

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.133
 listening to the police
 radio as the chase unfolds.

00:31:56.467 --> 00:32:01.934
SHERIFF NELS SORENSEN:
I am basically responsible
for all these kids out here.

00:32:02.033 --> 00:32:04.534
Once in a while you sit
up at night, going "Yeah",

00:32:04.634 --> 00:32:07.767
or you hear a call that
goes out, and you go,

00:32:07.868 --> 00:32:08.901
"Well, should I go?"

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:10.534
And I'm going, "Well,
they're big kids,

00:32:10.634 --> 00:32:12.067
"they can go take care of it."

00:32:12.167 --> 00:32:16.100
But, you know, you
second-guess yourself.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.934
Gotta trust in God
and their training

00:32:19.033 --> 00:32:21.167
and their abilities and.

00:32:21.267 --> 00:32:23.400
 NARRATOR: Nels Sorensen
 is in his fourth term

00:32:23.501 --> 00:32:25.734
as sheriff in Jefferson County.

00:32:25.834 --> 00:32:27.133
SORENSEN: I've
been in law enforcement,

00:32:27.234 --> 00:32:30.767
this coming April
will be 44 years.

00:32:30.868 --> 00:32:34.501
We have the confines
of Jefferson County

00:32:34.601 --> 00:32:37.334
and the southern
border of Nebraska,

00:32:37.434 --> 00:32:39.200
butts up against Kansas.

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:42.167
Being a sheriff is
a unique position.

00:32:42.267 --> 00:32:45.200
You have a civic
duty to do things,

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:47.334
you have to answer
to the people.

00:32:47.434 --> 00:32:51.534
I think it's probably the
greatest part of law enforcement

00:32:51.634 --> 00:32:53.734
to be in a small community.

00:32:53.834 --> 00:32:56.901
You know people, you're
a part of the community,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.968
I think Jefferson County,
not everybody likes us,

00:33:00.133 --> 00:33:03.834
but overall, we're
well-accepted in the community.

00:33:03.934 --> 00:33:05.300
 NARRATOR: Maybe
 there isn't a typical

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.267
 rural sheriff's
 department in Nebraska,

00:33:07.367 --> 00:33:09.834
 but Jefferson County
 would be a candidate.

00:33:09.934 --> 00:33:12.133
 Another would be Butler
 County, to the north,

00:33:12.234 --> 00:33:14.300
 where farmland starts
 to flatten out,

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.067
accommodating the Platte River.

00:33:17.167 --> 00:33:19.133
 Marcus Siebken
 worked as a deputy

00:33:19.234 --> 00:33:21.801
 when the sheriff, a close
 friend, passed away.

00:33:21.901 --> 00:33:23.701
 Siebken earned enough votes

00:33:23.801 --> 00:33:27.667
 in the 2014 election
 to keep his job.

00:33:27.767 --> 00:33:29.667
MARCUS SIEBKEN: I
was 30 years old, I was
a 30-year-old sheriff.

00:33:29.767 --> 00:33:32.133
One of the youngest
sheriffs in the state.

00:33:32.234 --> 00:33:33.601
I didn't get into
law enforcement duty

00:33:33.701 --> 00:33:36.801
to be an administrator as a
sheriff when I was 30 years old.

00:33:36.901 --> 00:33:40.701
I went into law enforcement
to provide safety

00:33:40.801 --> 00:33:44.033
for wherever I'm working.

00:33:44.133 --> 00:33:47.300
The farming community,
good people.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.968
When I arrived here in 2009,

00:33:50.067 --> 00:33:52.133
it's almost like I was
accepted right away,

00:33:52.234 --> 00:33:55.234
which was, which made
me wanna stay here.

00:33:55.334 --> 00:33:59.834
People come to my house,
my phone goes off non-stop.

00:33:59.934 --> 00:34:03.534
So it's a 24-hour job.

00:34:03.634 --> 00:34:06.634
My birthday this year,
I got called out,

00:34:06.734 --> 00:34:10.167
we had a fatality accident
involving a 15-year-old girl,

00:34:10.267 --> 00:34:11.601
so that's how I
spent my birthday,

00:34:11.701 --> 00:34:14.467
was telling her mother
that her daughter

00:34:14.567 --> 00:34:15.801
wasn't gonna come
home that night.

00:34:17.801 --> 00:34:21.000
Does it take a mental anguish
on somebody after the fact?

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:22.300
Absolutely.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.934
But, like I said,
you get into the job

00:34:26.033 --> 00:34:27.601
knowing that that's
gonna happen someday.

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:31.367
We have a 10-man
department, 11 with me.

00:34:31.467 --> 00:34:34.367
So if your population's
decreasing,

00:34:34.467 --> 00:34:36.667
people are gonna go, "Why do
we need this many deputies

00:34:36.767 --> 00:34:39.634
"if we don't have this many
people in the community?"

00:34:39.734 --> 00:34:42.167
As far as the other
small towns around

00:34:42.267 --> 00:34:44.601
in Butler County,
you're losing numbers.

00:34:44.701 --> 00:34:46.634
The towns are getting smaller.

00:34:46.734 --> 00:34:49.234
 NARRATOR: Since the
 1970's in central Nebraska,

00:34:49.334 --> 00:34:52.133
 people have drifted away
 from the rural counties.

00:34:52.234 --> 00:34:54.868
 Small towns shut down
 police departments,

00:34:54.968 --> 00:34:58.234
 turning over law enforcement
 to the county sheriff.

00:34:58.334 --> 00:35:00.834
SIEBKEN: There's 13
communities in Butler County.

00:35:00.934 --> 00:35:04.667
Range from 100 people to
close to 1,000 people.

00:35:04.767 --> 00:35:08.734
We have three contracted towns
within the sheriff's office,

00:35:08.834 --> 00:35:11.167
David City, which is
our main contract,

00:35:11.267 --> 00:35:13.567
Bellwood, and Rising City.

00:35:13.667 --> 00:35:15.334
 NARRATOR: In Butler
 County, David City

00:35:15.434 --> 00:35:18.400
 gave up its four officers,
 signing a contract

00:35:18.501 --> 00:35:21.200
 with the sheriff
 to keep the peace.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:23.767
DEPUTY MARLA SCHNELL: Hey, make
sure you mow this, okay Laura?

00:35:23.868 --> 00:35:26.033
Each city contracts with
the sheriff's office

00:35:26.133 --> 00:35:28.901
for so much patrol time
in their community.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.801
That would include doing
ordinances and stuff like

00:35:31.901 --> 00:35:33.567
cars and weeds and stuff,

00:35:33.667 --> 00:35:36.601
so we have to do
so many hours a day

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:39.901
in those contract towns,
to meet those hours.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.267
I'm not gonna disturb the
dogs anymore. (chuckles)

00:35:44.367 --> 00:35:46.067
 (slow bluesy music)

00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:49.400
SORENSEN: We've been one of
the 10 most depleting

00:35:49.501 --> 00:35:52.734
counties in the state
for several cycles.

00:35:52.834 --> 00:35:54.267
Oh, it's terrible.

00:35:54.367 --> 00:35:56.367
Our population is going down,

00:35:56.467 --> 00:35:58.767
but our crime rate is going up.

00:35:58.868 --> 00:36:00.667
 NARRATOR: The
 population of Fairbury,

00:36:00.767 --> 00:36:02.868
 the largest town in
 Jefferson County,

00:36:02.968 --> 00:36:05.601
 dropped 6% in 10 years.

00:36:05.701 --> 00:36:07.634
 Tax revenue dropped as well.

00:36:07.734 --> 00:36:10.567
 The city debated whether
 it was just too expensive

00:36:10.667 --> 00:36:12.601
 to pay for its own
 police force.

00:36:14.234 --> 00:36:15.300
CITIZEN: It seems like
we're on this trend

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:19.801
of cutting this community
down to just a bare bones.

00:36:19.901 --> 00:36:22.033
 NARRATOR: Legitimate
 concerns mixed with rumor

00:36:22.133 --> 00:36:24.267
 fueled concerns about
 whether Fairbury

00:36:24.367 --> 00:36:26.834
 could remain a
 safe place to live.

00:36:26.934 --> 00:36:28.601
CITIZEN: I don't like seeing
the whole community

00:36:28.701 --> 00:36:32.334
freaking out about whether
their children are gonna be safe

00:36:32.434 --> 00:36:36.400
or whether they're gonna
have to go purchase

00:36:36.501 --> 00:36:40.100
hand guns and mace and
everything like that.

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.033
 NARRATOR: Contracting
 with the county sheriff

00:36:42.133 --> 00:36:43.901
 seemed the only way out.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.133
COUNCILMAN:
The people are gonna be there,

00:36:45.234 --> 00:36:46.534
they're gonna have the backup,

00:36:46.634 --> 00:36:48.834
they're gonna have the
help that they need.

00:36:48.934 --> 00:36:53.100
SORENSEN: So,
there will no longer be a
Fairbury Police Department.

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.501
This year they've finally
come to the conclusion

00:36:57.601 --> 00:36:59.234
that the numbers
that I can give them,

00:36:59.334 --> 00:37:03.267
they'll get the same quality
of law enforcement they have,

00:37:03.367 --> 00:37:05.033
and save them some money.

00:37:05.133 --> 00:37:08.634
And we're gonna be doing it
with the same number of people,

00:37:08.734 --> 00:37:10.100
only thing they'll be wearing

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:12.934
brown uniforms instead of blue.

00:37:15.067 --> 00:37:16.767
COUNCILMAN: The Highway Safety
Office for--

00:37:16.868 --> 00:37:18.300
 (keys jingling)

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.000
 NARRATOR: Sheriffs
 run county jails.

00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.234
 There are 67 around the state.

00:37:22.334 --> 00:37:25.100
 The smallest counties don't
 always have enough arrests

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:27.767
 to justify the cost,
 so they pay rent

00:37:27.868 --> 00:37:31.434
 for cell space in counties
 where there are empty beds.

00:37:31.534 --> 00:37:37.067
SIEBKEN:
In doing that now, our jail
is full 85% of the time now,

00:37:37.167 --> 00:37:41.234
with our inmates and a couple
other counties' inmates.

00:37:41.334 --> 00:37:43.667
And it's created several
hundreds and hundreds

00:37:43.767 --> 00:37:46.734
of thousand dollars of
revenue for Butler County.

00:37:46.834 --> 00:37:48.334
 NARRATOR: A county
 jail can tell you a lot

00:37:48.434 --> 00:37:52.300
 about the amount of crime
 and the type of crime.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:56.534
SIEBKEN: Drug crimes, possession
of controlled substances,

00:37:56.634 --> 00:37:57.934
those are our big ones.

00:37:58.033 --> 00:37:59.801
DEPUTY MATT SCHULTZ: We have a
big problem with drugs,

00:37:59.901 --> 00:38:02.567
and that's been that way
since I've been here.

00:38:02.667 --> 00:38:08.334
 (slow bluesy music)

00:38:08.434 --> 00:38:09.434
DEPUTY: Sheriff's
office, search warrant,

00:38:09.534 --> 00:38:13.267
we're coming inside,
it's very important.

00:38:13.367 --> 00:38:14.567
Guy, lemme see your hands,

00:38:14.667 --> 00:38:15.501
lemme see your hands.
OFFICER: Lemme see your hands.

00:38:15.601 --> 00:38:16.701
OFFICER: Hands.

00:38:16.801 --> 00:38:18.334
SCHULTZ: You get your burglaries
and your other things,

00:38:18.434 --> 00:38:20.701
but a lot of those
are related to drugs

00:38:20.801 --> 00:38:21.767
in and of themselves.

00:38:21.868 --> 00:38:23.067
You probably wouldn't
have that burglary

00:38:23.167 --> 00:38:24.300
if it hadn't been for drugs.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.701
 (handcuffs being applied)

00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:27.934
People need to fuel their habit.

00:38:28.033 --> 00:38:30.667
Mostly what we see is
methamphetamine, marijuana,

00:38:30.767 --> 00:38:32.801
started to see an
upsurge in heroin,

00:38:32.901 --> 00:38:35.000
fentanyl, things like that.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.133
Prescription drugs are big too.

00:38:37.234 --> 00:38:38.634
You see a lot of abuse of that.

00:38:39.767 --> 00:38:43.434
OFFICER: This is a field
test, turned blue.

00:38:43.534 --> 00:38:48.133
This color means it's a positive
test for methamphetamine.

00:38:48.234 --> 00:38:49.133
SCHULTZ: You know,
most of these people

00:38:49.234 --> 00:38:51.000
aren't bad people,
they're just addicts.

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:52.067
And they need help.

00:38:52.167 --> 00:38:54.000
And a lot of our
calls like that,

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.400
that's what we're dealing with.

00:38:55.501 --> 00:38:57.400
We're not dealing mainly
with the Mexican mafia

00:38:57.501 --> 00:38:59.868
or anything like that, we're
just dealing with people

00:38:59.968 --> 00:39:04.467
who have a substance abuse
problem, and they need help.

00:39:04.567 --> 00:39:06.701
SORENSEN: We've served a lot
of search warrants

00:39:06.801 --> 00:39:10.300
here in the last year,
trying to clean things up.

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:14.467
We're very proactive
at trying to curb this,

00:39:14.567 --> 00:39:17.300
and it's one of those
things that's kinda like

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:21.067
the little Dutch boy with his
finger in the dike.

00:39:21.167 --> 00:39:25.501
He only has so many fingers,
and we're the line between

00:39:25.601 --> 00:39:28.000
you might say good and evil.

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.801
'Cause drugs are
definitely evil.

00:39:30.901 --> 00:39:35.834
Tears families apart,
and it's a sad situation.

00:39:38.467 --> 00:39:39.601
 (officer calling dog
 out of car)

00:39:39.701 --> 00:39:41.400
 NARRATOR: There is
 evidence drug smugglers

00:39:41.501 --> 00:39:44.133
 stay busy moving product
 across the network

00:39:44.234 --> 00:39:46.801
 of rural highways
 and back roads.

00:39:46.901 --> 00:39:48.601
SIEBKEN: I think a lotta
counties are taking

00:39:48.701 --> 00:39:52.267
a stance on, good luck
going through Nebraska,

00:39:52.367 --> 00:39:54.367
because we've got a
lotta trained officers

00:39:54.467 --> 00:39:56.801
on the criminal drug
interdiction here.

00:39:56.901 --> 00:39:58.400
OFFICER:: Good girl, good girl.

00:39:58.501 --> 00:39:59.767
Good, good girl.

00:39:59.868 --> 00:40:01.067
Good girl.

00:40:01.167 --> 00:40:03.834
 NARRATOR: Interstate 80,
cutting through rural counties,

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:07.133
 earned its reputation as a
 pipeline for cars and trucks

00:40:07.234 --> 00:40:10.901
 moving tons of illegal
 drugs across Nebraska.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.501
SIEBKEN: I think it's
everywhere, with Colorado

00:40:12.601 --> 00:40:17.601
legalizing marijuana, it's
not hard to do a traffic stop

00:40:17.701 --> 00:40:20.734
here in David City or
on Highway 92 or 15,

00:40:20.834 --> 00:40:23.968
where it's a simple
marijuana infraction stop,

00:40:24.067 --> 00:40:25.767
and a cite and release.

00:40:25.868 --> 00:40:27.434
You would almost see that daily.

00:40:28.367 --> 00:40:30.434
DEPUTY ROBERT JORDAN:
It doesn't matter to me
whether you're in a big city

00:40:30.534 --> 00:40:32.801
or a small town,
crime still happens,

00:40:32.901 --> 00:40:35.400
and you still need those
same investigative tools.

00:40:35.501 --> 00:40:38.701
This is gonna be our GPS
system that we use, basically--

00:40:38.801 --> 00:40:41.400
 NARRATOR: From accessing
 arrest record databases,

00:40:41.501 --> 00:40:43.434
 to filling out
 reports in the field,

00:40:43.534 --> 00:40:46.734
 the technology linking all
 Nebraska law enforcement

00:40:46.834 --> 00:40:48.734
 became an expensive necessity

00:40:48.834 --> 00:40:51.701
 for small departments
 with limited resources.

00:40:51.801 --> 00:40:52.901
JORDAN: It's a big difference.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.400
Technology has come
a long, long way.

00:40:55.501 --> 00:40:57.167
 NARRATOR: Tracking
 devices in patrol cars

00:40:57.267 --> 00:40:59.634
 all over the state
 transmit their locations

00:40:59.734 --> 00:41:02.067
to dispatchers across the state

00:41:02.167 --> 00:41:04.901
 and on cruiser
 dashboards in the field.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.567
JORDAN: It really helps
being able to tell

00:41:06.667 --> 00:41:10.033
where everyone else is,
if you were to need help.

00:41:10.133 --> 00:41:11.300
 NARRATOR: Half the
 police departments

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:13.868
 in the United States
 employ body cameras.

00:41:13.968 --> 00:41:16.200
 Officers in the
 most remote settings

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:18.901
 can be constantly
 monitored by technology,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.701
 demanding new levels
 of accountability.

00:41:21.801 --> 00:41:23.501
JORDAN: The very least,
we're on microphone,

00:41:23.601 --> 00:41:26.067
where you can hear everything
we're saying and doing.

00:41:26.167 --> 00:41:27.367
And then other than
that, we're on camera

00:41:27.467 --> 00:41:28.801
just about every
time we make contact

00:41:28.901 --> 00:41:30.801
with an individual, as well.

00:41:30.901 --> 00:41:32.968
OFFICER: He's
armed with a hammer.

00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:34.200
Justin, can I talk
to you real quick?

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:35.033
Can you put the hammer down?

00:41:35.133 --> 00:41:37.367
Put the hammer down please.

00:41:37.467 --> 00:41:38.601
Justin, put the hammer down.

00:41:38.701 --> 00:41:39.901
Put the hammer down.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.167
WOMAN: Put it down.

00:41:41.267 --> 00:41:42.801
OFFICER: Put the hammer
down or you're gonna get tased.

00:41:42.901 --> 00:41:44.868
Put it down.

00:41:44.968 --> 00:41:45.701
 (hammer clatters)

00:41:45.801 --> 00:41:48.434
Step away from it.

00:41:48.534 --> 00:41:49.734
What's going on, man?

00:41:49.834 --> 00:41:51.300
Get your hands out
of your pocket.

00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.767
 NARRATOR: Police-worn body
 cameras
OFFICER: What's going on?

00:41:52.868 --> 00:41:55.167
 NARRATOR: Catch good
 conduct and mistakes.

00:41:55.267 --> 00:41:58.234
 Threatening behavior
 and important details.

00:41:58.334 --> 00:42:03.234
RANDI WEBB:
The agencies that are throwing
a fit about them, why?

00:42:03.334 --> 00:42:05.968
It's just recording
what we do every day.

00:42:06.067 --> 00:42:07.634
If you're doing things
the way you should be,

00:42:07.734 --> 00:42:09.133
it shouldn't be an issue.

00:42:09.234 --> 00:42:11.601
MIKE KERBY:
We do, it's certainly not
a warning, it's an awareness.

00:42:11.701 --> 00:42:13.601
Hey don't do this, because
you might be caught on camera.

00:42:13.701 --> 00:42:14.968
That's not the way it is at all.

00:42:15.067 --> 00:42:17.434
We just remind them that
it's a different society

00:42:17.534 --> 00:42:18.868
they're policing in now.

00:42:18.968 --> 00:42:20.267
We've always lived
in glass houses.

00:42:20.367 --> 00:42:22.834
Trust us, law
enforcement always has.

00:42:22.934 --> 00:42:23.868
OFFICER: You're just
being detained, man.

00:42:23.968 --> 00:42:25.167
 (handcuffs click)

00:42:25.267 --> 00:42:27.334
'Cause you had that hammer and
you weren't putting it down.

00:42:27.434 --> 00:42:29.767
SIEBKEN: That'll go
in front of the courts.

00:42:29.868 --> 00:42:31.133
 DISPATCHER:
 Butler County 5-11.

00:42:31.234 --> 00:42:33.267
SIEBKEN: And they'll be able to
see this guy, how he was acting,

00:42:33.367 --> 00:42:36.234
show the mental health
problems that he's having.

00:42:36.334 --> 00:42:38.634
OFFICER: 10-4, can
you contact crisis center,

00:42:38.734 --> 00:42:40.467
see if they have
a bed available?

00:42:40.567 --> 00:42:42.367
The one in Lincoln, please?

00:42:42.467 --> 00:42:45.300
SIEBKEN: Mental health
issues are huge now,

00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.200
compared to what they
were 10 years ago.

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.100
DISPATCHER: Larry with the
crisis center,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.701
he advised they do have
a bed open at this time.

00:42:54.767 --> 00:42:57.334
SIEBKEN: I feel that there's
been a huge uptick in it.

00:42:57.434 --> 00:42:59.267
Close to a couple times a week,

00:42:59.367 --> 00:43:03.200
we're dealing with some sort
of mental, mental health case.

00:43:03.300 --> 00:43:06.067
If we're taking somebody
into protective care

00:43:06.167 --> 00:43:08.133
or contacting a mental
health professor,

00:43:08.234 --> 00:43:10.868
and having them speak with them.

00:43:10.968 --> 00:43:11.868
 (radio beeps)

00:43:11.968 --> 00:43:13.100
 NARRATOR: Sheriff
 Siebken got a call

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.868
 from a woman concerned
 about her son, Jesse.

00:43:15.968 --> 00:43:19.400
 Couple of years ago,
 his meth addiction ended
 in a prison term.

00:43:19.501 --> 00:43:20.501
SIEBKEN: What's going on, man?

00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:21.133
 NARRATOR: Since his release,
 his diagnosed

00:43:21.234 --> 00:43:22.334
JESSE: I'm all right.

00:43:22.434 --> 00:43:24.701
 NARRATOR: Schizo-affective
 disorder only worsened.

00:43:24.801 --> 00:43:26.067
 (Jesse mumbles)

00:43:26.167 --> 00:43:28.300
SIEBKEN: And we've been dealing
with him for the last two years.

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.868
And it's been a struggle,

00:43:29.968 --> 00:43:31.534
it's been a struggle
for his family.

00:43:31.634 --> 00:43:33.734
I know his mother's
taking it very hard.

00:43:33.834 --> 00:43:36.267
DEPUTY: He was in a manic
episode outside of his home.

00:43:36.367 --> 00:43:37.100
OFFICER: Okay.

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.734
DEPUTY: Screaming at a tree.

00:43:38.834 --> 00:43:40.701
 NARRATOR: A few years
 ago, a small town cop

00:43:40.801 --> 00:43:43.400
 would not have gotten
 any professional guidance

00:43:43.501 --> 00:43:46.934
 on how to cope with someone
 appearing to be mentally ill.

00:43:47.033 --> 00:43:50.133
KERBY: Dealing with mentally ill
is a whole different conundrum

00:43:50.234 --> 00:43:52.067
than we've had in the past.

00:43:52.167 --> 00:43:54.234
We didn't understand it,
to be honest with you.

00:43:54.334 --> 00:43:56.000
And I think now there's
so much awareness

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.634
on mental illness,
if we can minimize

00:43:58.734 --> 00:44:01.667
those violent interactions
between law enforcement

00:44:01.767 --> 00:44:03.968
and mentally ill, and get
them the help that they need,

00:44:04.067 --> 00:44:06.434
that's truly what the mission
of helping people's all about.

00:44:06.534 --> 00:44:08.000
JESSE: You know what that
means.

00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:09.801
DEPUTY: But I
just don't want you to put
your hands in your pocket, okay?

00:44:09.901 --> 00:44:11.667
JESSE: I can put my hands in my
pocket any time.

00:44:11.767 --> 00:44:13.133
DEPUTY: Well I don't know what
you have in there.

00:44:13.234 --> 00:44:14.868
Do you have any weapons?

00:44:14.968 --> 00:44:16.534
JESSE: It don't matter if I do
or not.

00:44:16.634 --> 00:44:17.868
DEPUTY: It does matter.

00:44:17.968 --> 00:44:19.334
 NARRATOR: The
 deputies respond

00:44:19.434 --> 00:44:21.000
 just as they've been trained.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:23.701
 Take things slow,
 lower your voice,

00:44:23.801 --> 00:44:25.534
 treat it as a
 mental health issue

00:44:25.634 --> 00:44:27.634
 rather than a
 criminal complaint.

00:44:27.734 --> 00:44:28.901
RANDI WEBB: We don't know why
they're not listening,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.567
we don't know why they're
not following commands,

00:44:30.667 --> 00:44:31.901
and there could
be a legit reason

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.434
why they're not doing all that.

00:44:33.534 --> 00:44:35.300
And if controlling the situation

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.167
means putting your
hands on somebody,

00:44:37.267 --> 00:44:39.234
you put your hands on somebody.

00:44:39.334 --> 00:44:41.767
DEPUTY: Keep your hands, okay.
JESSE: Hey, whoa, whoa.

00:44:41.868 --> 00:44:43.367
No, what did I do?
DEPUTY: Keep your hands.

00:44:43.467 --> 00:44:44.434
That's like the fourth time

00:44:44.534 --> 00:44:45.567
JESSE: No I didn't.
DEPUTY: I've asked you.

00:44:45.667 --> 00:44:47.334
 NARRATOR: This is not
 an unusual occurrence

00:44:47.434 --> 00:44:48.634
 in rural counties.

00:44:48.734 --> 00:44:50.000
DEPUTY: Hi, are you mom?

00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:52.133
 NARRATOR: Families with
 mentally ill relatives

00:44:52.234 --> 00:44:55.100
 can have frequent visits
 with the local cops.

00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.501
MOM: He sees things and
he fights for his life

00:44:57.601 --> 00:44:58.734
and there's--
DEPUTY: Okay.

00:44:58.834 --> 00:44:59.634
MOM: There's nothing there.
DEPUTY: So he'll have like

00:44:59.734 --> 00:45:01.000
an actual fight, just--
MOM: Yes.

00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.801
DEPUTY: Nobody there.
MOM: There's nobody there.

00:45:02.901 --> 00:45:03.934
DEPUTY: Okay.

00:45:04.033 --> 00:45:05.334
 NARRATOR: Butler County,
 like most small counties

00:45:05.434 --> 00:45:08.501
 in Nebraska, has no
 mental health specialists,

00:45:08.601 --> 00:45:11.934
 much less beds available
 in area hospitals.

00:45:12.033 --> 00:45:14.534
MOM:
I'm trying to find someplace
else, but I have no money.

00:45:14.634 --> 00:45:16.534
He has no insurance, nothing.

00:45:16.634 --> 00:45:17.601
 NARRATOR: In
 a case like this,

00:45:17.701 --> 00:45:19.434
 the deputies must
 decide if Jesse

00:45:19.534 --> 00:45:22.200
 is a danger to
 himself or others.

00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:23.567
DEPUTY: You burned
yourself, didn't you?

00:45:23.667 --> 00:45:24.901
JESSE: There ain't nothing
wrong.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.734
DEPUTY: Okay,
what about your chest?

00:45:26.834 --> 00:45:29.033
JESSE: There is nothing
wrong with me though.

00:45:29.133 --> 00:45:31.434
No, this is it, real shadow.

00:45:31.534 --> 00:45:32.534
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong?

00:45:32.634 --> 00:45:33.200
DEPUTY: See you burned your
chest right there.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.734
JESSE: That ain't burned.

00:45:34.834 --> 00:45:36.067
No, that ain't burned.

00:45:36.167 --> 00:45:37.334
That's religious stuff.

00:45:37.434 --> 00:45:38.367
DEPUTY: That's religious stuff?
JESSE: Yeah it is for me.

00:45:38.467 --> 00:45:39.200
DEPUTY: Okay.

00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.000
JESSE: Hey mom!

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:44.133
 NARRATOR: Reason enough to
 request he be placed in
 emergency protective custody.

00:45:44.234 --> 00:45:47.734
 It's a long, one-hour drive to
 the crisis center in Lincoln.

00:45:47.834 --> 00:45:49.334
BRENDA URBANEK: It'd be great
if every community

00:45:49.434 --> 00:45:51.367
had a mental health
practitioner,

00:45:51.467 --> 00:45:54.133
that when somebody was
experiencing a crisis,

00:45:54.234 --> 00:45:55.434
we could call them in and say,

00:45:55.534 --> 00:46:00.133
"Hey, we've got him safe right
now, now will you take him?"

00:46:00.234 --> 00:46:03.734
Well anymore, our police
officers on the street

00:46:03.834 --> 00:46:07.033
are having to try to do
initial assessments to see

00:46:07.133 --> 00:46:10.100
what kind of a crisis is
this person experiencing,

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.033
and do we have the resources?

00:46:12.133 --> 00:46:13.400
 NARRATOR: At one
 time, Nebraska had

00:46:13.501 --> 00:46:15.100
 regional mental
 health care centers

00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:17.567
 to house the most
 challenging cases.

00:46:17.667 --> 00:46:19.934
 The state re-purposed
 those facilities,

00:46:20.033 --> 00:46:23.167
 shifting most of the long-term
 care responsibilities

00:46:23.267 --> 00:46:24.234
 back to the families.

00:46:24.334 --> 00:46:25.400
MOM: Honey,
I need you to get help.

00:46:25.501 --> 00:46:26.534
JESSE: Can I stay?

00:46:26.634 --> 00:46:27.267
MOM: No, you need help.
JESSE: I'll be okay, mom.

00:46:27.367 --> 00:46:28.033
I was coming home.
MOM: No.

00:46:28.133 --> 00:46:29.000
 NARRATOR: Disturbance calls

00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:31.567
 to local law
 enforcement increased.

00:46:33.033 --> 00:46:36.234
SHERIFF NELS SORENSEN:
Since they closed down
the regional centers here,

00:46:36.334 --> 00:46:43.801
15 years ago or such, their
beds are at a premium.

00:46:43.901 --> 00:46:45.267
 NARRATOR: At the
 Jefferson County jail,

00:46:45.367 --> 00:46:47.334
 deputies brought
 in a man growling

00:46:47.434 --> 00:46:50.667
 and shouting obscenities
 every waking minute.

00:46:50.767 --> 00:46:54.801
 (man screeching)

00:46:54.901 --> 00:46:56.834
SORENSEN: Hours on end.
DISPATCHER: All day.

00:46:56.934 --> 00:46:58.000
 NARRATOR: A judge ordered him

00:46:58.100 --> 00:46:59.968
 sent to the regional center.

00:47:00.133 --> 00:47:04.467
SORENSEN:
He is number 30 on the list
of when a bed comes available,

00:47:04.567 --> 00:47:06.634
so there's 29
people ahead of him

00:47:06.734 --> 00:47:09.133
waiting for a bed at
the regional center.

00:47:09.234 --> 00:47:13.200
So we're, we could
have him for a month,

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:15.601
two months, four months.

00:47:15.701 --> 00:47:19.167
 NARRATOR: The mental illness
 calls, a family in crisis.

00:47:19.267 --> 00:47:20.801
 A potential suicide.

00:47:20.901 --> 00:47:23.701
 Anyone in law enforcement
 who sticks with the job

00:47:23.801 --> 00:47:27.634
 comes to understand a basic
 truth about this kind of work.

00:47:27.734 --> 00:47:28.634
SCHULTZ:
When you're a cop out here,

00:47:28.734 --> 00:47:29.901
you have to learn how
to talk to people.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.734
Your greatest weapon
is your mouth.

00:47:31.834 --> 00:47:33.334
And it'll keep you out of a lot

00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:35.667
of fights and
dangerous situations.

00:47:35.767 --> 00:47:39.767
It'll calm things down, it'll
help you stay alive out here.

00:47:39.868 --> 00:47:43.601
OFFICER MANDY MURPHY:
I think a lot of it is just
knowing how to talk to people.

00:47:43.701 --> 00:47:45.634
To talk them down.

00:47:45.734 --> 00:47:47.767
If you can talk to them
and treat them the way

00:47:47.868 --> 00:47:52.834
that you would wanna be treated,
then that gets you a lot.

00:47:52.934 --> 00:47:55.067
SORENSEN: I've always said I've
talked more people to jail

00:47:55.167 --> 00:47:57.434
than I've fought to jail.

00:47:57.534 --> 00:47:59.601
OFFICER CHUCK MENEZES:
Most cops, when they
first get in this job,

00:47:59.701 --> 00:48:01.267
all of us we get
that mentality is,

00:48:01.367 --> 00:48:04.467
we're gonna save people,
and we're gonna go

00:48:04.567 --> 00:48:07.300
arrest all the bad
guys, and take everybody

00:48:07.400 --> 00:48:09.033
to jail that needs
to go to jail.

00:48:09.133 --> 00:48:11.200
And there's a certain
point where you realize

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.100
that doesn't always work.

00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.267
We've gotta try
to keep them down.

00:48:13.367 --> 00:48:15.434
You can't take
everybody to jail.

00:48:15.534 --> 00:48:18.434
CITIZEN: I have a trap over
at my place too.

00:48:18.534 --> 00:48:21.400
 NARRATOR: Local agencies
hire their own police officers.

00:48:21.501 --> 00:48:24.834
Those recruits train at the Law
 Enforcement Training Center.

00:48:24.934 --> 00:48:27.033
URBANEK: The challenge
we face right now,

00:48:27.133 --> 00:48:28.901
typically we have a class of 50.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.701
We only have 40.

00:48:30.801 --> 00:48:34.601
Because agencies are having
difficulty finding applicants

00:48:34.701 --> 00:48:39.167
who meet those standards,
who want to do this job.

00:48:39.267 --> 00:48:40.601
 NARRATOR: Rural
 sheriffs and small town

00:48:40.701 --> 00:48:43.033
 police departments
 face fierce competition

00:48:43.133 --> 00:48:46.000
 for new recruits and
 experienced officers.

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.167
KERBY: When I was hired there
were like 2,000 applicants

00:48:48.267 --> 00:48:50.300
for the 41 jobs that I had.

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.834
Now, agencies are having
a very difficult time

00:48:52.934 --> 00:48:55.868
just finding quality
applicants to come in.

00:48:55.968 --> 00:48:57.501
 NARRATOR: As Butler
 County tried to fill

00:48:57.601 --> 00:49:00.267
 two vacant deputy
 sheriff positions,

00:49:00.367 --> 00:49:05.501
 other agencies had 99 open
 jobs for uniformed officers.

00:49:05.601 --> 00:49:07.434
 (Taser clicking)
OFFICER: It does that.

00:49:07.534 --> 00:49:08.534
Then I can shut it off.

00:49:08.634 --> 00:49:10.901
It's five seconds, and
it's a long five seconds.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.100
OFFICER:
It's a very long five seconds.

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.767
 NARRATOR: It's career night
 at David City High School.

00:49:15.868 --> 00:49:17.000
SIEBKEN: We got
a lotta cool stuff.

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:19.000
We have a lotta technology.

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:20.334
 NARRATOR: Getting
 a small town kid

00:49:20.434 --> 00:49:22.801
 interested in becoming
 a small town cop

00:49:22.901 --> 00:49:25.534
 can become the best
 kind of recruiting.

00:49:25.634 --> 00:49:30.067
SIEBKEN:
With other agencies being
closer to Lincoln and Omaha,

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:32.033
that's kinda for the
younger generation,

00:49:32.133 --> 00:49:33.400
that's kinda where
they wanna work.

00:49:33.501 --> 00:49:35.067
Being out in rural
Butler County,

00:49:35.167 --> 00:49:38.834
it's hard to find somebody to
come and stay and work here.

00:49:38.934 --> 00:49:39.701
Take a brochure.

00:49:39.801 --> 00:49:41.467
Always keep us in
mind, all right?

00:49:41.567 --> 00:49:43.200
TEEN: Okay.
SIEBKEN: All right.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.300
 NARRATOR: Average
 salary for a sworn officer

00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.334
 in central Nebraska runs
 about $50,000 a year.

00:49:49.434 --> 00:49:54.300
 They can earn $13,000
 more by moving to Omaha.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:58.033
 That salary is set by county
 boards and city councils.

00:49:58.133 --> 00:50:00.868
 They also decide how many
 officers are on the street

00:50:00.968 --> 00:50:03.601
 every time they pass
 an annual budget.

00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:05.901
SORENSEN: The county board has
given me permission

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.767
to hire a single school
resource officer.

00:50:09.868 --> 00:50:11.234
 NARRATOR: Every
 citizen has an opinion

00:50:11.334 --> 00:50:12.667
 about public safety.

00:50:12.767 --> 00:50:15.033
 At election time,
 they get the say

00:50:15.133 --> 00:50:17.567
 on what type of police
 protection they want.

00:50:17.667 --> 00:50:21.100
 2018 was one of those years.

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.934
 In Mitchell, Nebraska,
 there were three

00:50:23.033 --> 00:50:24.701
 candidates for mayor.

00:50:24.801 --> 00:50:29.200
COTANT: Unfortunately, I hate
to say, politics stink.

00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.167
They just do.

00:50:30.267 --> 00:50:31.400
 (Train passing by)

00:50:31.501 --> 00:50:32.501
 NARRATOR: Every now and then,

00:50:32.601 --> 00:50:34.300
 somebody gets fired
 up about shutting down

00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.467
 the police department
 or cutting the budget

00:50:36.567 --> 00:50:39.033
 or changing who's in charge.

00:50:39.133 --> 00:50:42.501
COTANT: So if this year,
when the new mayor,

00:50:42.601 --> 00:50:44.634
or whoever it is
is gonna be mayor,

00:50:44.734 --> 00:50:50.400
decides not to appoint me as
the police chief, I'm done.

00:50:50.501 --> 00:50:52.033
I don't have a job.

00:50:52.133 --> 00:50:54.534
 NARRATOR: Mitchell's incumbent
 mayor wasn't re-elected.

00:50:54.634 --> 00:50:56.501
 There's no sign
 from the new mayor

00:50:56.601 --> 00:51:00.601
 Chief Cotant needs to worry
 about keeping his job.

00:51:00.701 --> 00:51:05.501
 In Jefferson County, Nels
 Sorensen ran unopposed again.

00:51:05.601 --> 00:51:07.734
 He's sheriff for
 another four years.

00:51:07.834 --> 00:51:11.100
SORENSEN:
Little over 3,000 elected
sheriffs in the United States.

00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.234
We're a pretty small group.

00:51:13.334 --> 00:51:16.634
Everybody has that
responsibility,

00:51:16.734 --> 00:51:20.000
to the electorate, that
you're doing your job.

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:22.267
And if you're not
doing your job,

00:51:22.367 --> 00:51:25.634
then you're not gonna
be doing it much longer.

00:51:25.734 --> 00:51:26.868
 (plaintive music)

00:51:26.968 --> 00:51:28.334
 NARRATOR: The election
 for sheriff in Butler County

00:51:28.434 --> 00:51:30.033
 took an unexpected turn.

00:51:30.133 --> 00:51:32.634
 After six years in
 office, Marcus Siebken

00:51:32.734 --> 00:51:35.467
 found himself running
 against two opponents.

00:51:35.567 --> 00:51:38.934
MARCUS SIEBKEN:
Obviously, the whole
county looks at the sheriff.

00:51:39.033 --> 00:51:41.300
And that's very hard.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.601
Just for me personally,
because I hate failure.

00:51:44.701 --> 00:51:47.767
So if I fail, I feel like
I've failed the whole

00:51:47.868 --> 00:51:50.801
area of Butler County, and
I've let every citizen down.

00:51:50.901 --> 00:51:52.868
 BILL KELLY: What does
 failure mean, in this case?

00:51:55.901 --> 00:51:56.901
SIEBKEN: I'm still trying
to figure that out.

00:51:58.968 --> 00:52:00.701
 KELLY: Your
 crime rate hasn't gone up.

00:52:00.801 --> 00:52:02.734
SIEBKEN: No.

00:52:02.834 --> 00:52:08.834
But like I said, I take every
comment, criticism, to heart.

00:52:08.934 --> 00:52:10.300
And that's been the
hardest thing for me

00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.767
since I've been sheriff.

00:52:11.868 --> 00:52:15.100
Is because I perceive, when
I go out in the public,

00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:19.534
like my skin is thick and
nothing's gonna hurt me.

00:52:19.634 --> 00:52:23.434
But underneath this uniform,

00:52:23.534 --> 00:52:25.934
this has been a hard
four years for sure.

00:52:26.033 --> 00:52:28.300
 NARRATOR: Butler County
 voters were restless.

00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:31.801
 During Siebken's term,
 arrests were up in the county,

00:52:31.901 --> 00:52:33.934
 but there were complaints
 before the election

00:52:34.033 --> 00:52:38.501
 about locals getting too many
 speeding tickets and DUI's.

00:52:38.601 --> 00:52:40.133
SIEBKEN: You know, being in
a small community,

00:52:40.234 --> 00:52:45.000
a lot of people do expect
the good ol' boy system yet,

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:47.367
and expect a favor
here and there.

00:52:47.467 --> 00:52:51.801
And I always said,
if I lose an election

00:52:51.901 --> 00:52:55.033
because I did the right
thing, then so be it.

00:52:55.133 --> 00:52:57.100
That's not who I am,
I treat everybody fair,

00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.100
and we're not gonna hide
anything from anybody.

00:53:01.834 --> 00:53:04.100
 NARRATOR: Marcus
 Siebken lost the election.

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.501
 He has since taken
 a better-paying job

00:53:06.601 --> 00:53:08.601
 outside of law enforcement.

00:53:08.701 --> 00:53:11.000
SORENSEN: If you're making
everybody happy,

00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.934
I've always said you're
not doing your job.

00:53:13.033 --> 00:53:16.367
So there's somebody not
gonna be happy with you.

00:53:16.467 --> 00:53:18.000
I think the big
thing is, is that

00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:20.067
you're answerable to the public.

00:53:20.167 --> 00:53:23.200
I think that's what
America's all about.

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:26.534
 NARRATOR: Elections,
recruiting, changes in the job.

00:53:26.634 --> 00:53:29.567
 All of that is in the
 background on graduation day

00:53:29.667 --> 00:53:32.400
 at the Law Enforcement
 Training Center.

00:53:32.501 --> 00:53:35.367
 Eagerness and apprehension
 fills the room.

00:53:35.467 --> 00:53:38.934
 Families born of generations
 of law enforcement officers

00:53:39.033 --> 00:53:40.767
 gather around the rookies.

00:53:40.868 --> 00:53:42.501
 KELLY: Did your dad
 ever sit you down and say,

00:53:42.601 --> 00:53:44.167
 "Do you really wanna do this?"

00:53:44.267 --> 00:53:45.934
DEPUTY ZACH KRAMER:
A couple times, yeah.

00:53:46.033 --> 00:53:47.734
 KELLY: Tell me
 about that conversation.

00:53:47.834 --> 00:53:49.400
KRAMER: Well, I guess you
could say I'm stubborn

00:53:49.501 --> 00:53:52.033
and just didn't listen, but.
 (Father laughs)

00:53:52.133 --> 00:53:55.534
COMMANDER: Forward march.

00:53:55.634 --> 00:53:59.133
URBANEK: A successful graduate
is somebody who recognizes

00:53:59.234 --> 00:54:00.467
that you have to have compassion

00:54:00.567 --> 00:54:02.400
for your fellow human being,

00:54:02.501 --> 00:54:05.234
whether it's a
suspect or a victim.

00:54:05.334 --> 00:54:06.701
 PRESENTER:
 Deputy Zach Kramer,

00:54:06.801 --> 00:54:08.200
 Lincoln County
 Sheriff's Office.

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:10.300
URBANEK: The successful
graduate, even though they walk

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.334
across that stage and get that
packet with their diploma,

00:54:14.434 --> 00:54:16.968
realizes, "I don't
know anything yet.

00:54:17.067 --> 00:54:18.234
"I gotta keep learning."

00:54:19.767 --> 00:54:24.400
KRAMER: Be aware that you have
chosen a very dangerous career.

00:54:24.501 --> 00:54:26.634
At some point, someone
is going to try

00:54:26.734 --> 00:54:29.200
to hurt you or kill you.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.534
Keep that in mind every day,

00:54:30.634 --> 00:54:33.901
and keep in mind
that you will win.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.267
You never lose.

00:54:36.367 --> 00:54:38.300
URBANEK: A successful
graduate is somebody

00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:41.300
who recognizes that they
are entering a profession

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:44.601
which is noble and honorable,

00:54:44.701 --> 00:54:46.534
that they have to
have that integrity

00:54:46.634 --> 00:54:49.067
throughout their career.

00:54:49.167 --> 00:54:51.100
Once they lose that integrity,

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.934
they should go sell
shoes or something.

00:54:54.033 --> 00:54:55.934
 NARRATOR: Once all the
 certificates are issued,

00:54:56.033 --> 00:54:59.501
 they turn to the audience and
 deliver the Academy's Oath.

00:54:59.601 --> 00:55:00.601
ALL OFFICERS:
Honor, integrity,

00:55:00.701 --> 00:55:02.434
and respect are never betrayed.

00:55:02.534 --> 00:55:05.100
 NARRATOR: Within days,
 they are on full duty,

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:07.400
 many serving in
 counties and towns

00:55:07.501 --> 00:55:11.133
 with populations smaller than
 single neighborhoods in Omaha.

00:55:11.234 --> 00:55:13.200
OFFICER: How you doing buddy?
OFFICER: Pretty good.

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:14.501
 NARRATOR: Out
 in the panhandle,

00:55:14.601 --> 00:55:17.467
 Officer Preston brought the
 Mitchell Police Department

00:55:17.567 --> 00:55:19.934
 back to full strength.

00:55:20.033 --> 00:55:22.601
PRESTON:
My family never discouraged
me from doing something

00:55:22.701 --> 00:55:23.868
that I felt like I wanted to do,

00:55:23.968 --> 00:55:27.367
and I'm not gonna discourage
somebody else from doing it.

00:55:27.467 --> 00:55:28.367
It's scary.

00:55:28.467 --> 00:55:30.901
The times are getting
even more scarier.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.734
Going through the training,
and being told things

00:55:32.834 --> 00:55:37.667
that we were told, and doing
what we did, and it is scary.

00:55:37.767 --> 00:55:38.968
 It'll be a 1983...

00:55:39.067 --> 00:55:41.200
I think if you have a heart
for people to do your job

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:44.167
and to uphold the law,
then I think it's okay.

00:55:44.267 --> 00:55:45.767
I think you'll be fine.

00:55:45.868 --> 00:55:48.200
 You gotta do what
 you gotta do, Steve!

00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:50.400
It's nice to work
in a smaller town,

00:55:50.501 --> 00:55:52.133
because you can have
the rapport with people

00:55:52.234 --> 00:55:53.367
and people can trust you.

00:55:53.467 --> 00:55:56.334
They know that they
don't have to worry

00:55:56.434 --> 00:55:58.400
so much during the day.

00:55:58.501 --> 00:55:59.434
I love it here.

00:55:59.534 --> 00:56:02.100
I don't wanna work
in a big city.

00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:04.000
I like it here.

00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:08.501
 (peaceful music)

00:56:09.667 --> 00:56:10.934
 (ardent music)
