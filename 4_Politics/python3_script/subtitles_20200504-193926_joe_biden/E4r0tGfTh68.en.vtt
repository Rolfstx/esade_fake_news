00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.060
Good morning everybody, I'm Gino Sorbillo,
Neapolitan pizza chef. Together with

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.869
my brother Toto I'm leading the "Antica Pizzeria
Sorbillo" in Tribunali Street, 32. To make

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.950
Gino Sorbillo's Neapolitan pizza,
we start from flour. 1,550 kg of

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.270
organic farming flour by Molino
Caputo, all-purpose. Then we have 1

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.899
liter of water, 45 gr of salt
and 1,5 gr yeast. For the

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.800
topping, we have organic
farming tomato, a fiordilatte

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.250
Napoli type, extra virgin olive oil and fresh

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.440
basil. First step, we're adding flour
in the kneading trough. Then we're

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.910
dissolving a gram of natural yeast,
fresh, in a liter of water.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.709
In the meantime, we prepared
45 gr of salt that

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.579
we're directly adding in the flour. We're
working the flour with salt. At this point

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:11.189
we're adding the water
where we added natural yeast.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.689
It's very important to have a flour
that is constant, that is balanced

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.490
that is always reliable, to absorb the water

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.869
needed for the kneading
of the dough, that can satisfy

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.470
our needs, that can be predictable

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.039
in the reaction. We understand
that the dough shaped

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:48.259
when it is a little sticky on the hands
and a little sticky on the

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.100
sides of the container where
we decide to knead, in this case,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.759
a traditional wooden kneading trough.
So, if this dough, as I was saying

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:01.369
some time ago, can be lifted,
it always stays soft, sagging,

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.690
as it's, anyway, a very oxigenated mass,
but in the meantime

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.399
we notice that the gluten net formed,
it's a nearly done dough that

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.790
can even be moved to the counter
while the container remains

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.298
clean. This dough must be completed,
there's this system

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.030
of kneading that includes the stretching
of the dough and the closing.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.959
Why? Because we're covering, extracting in the

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.930
outer layer the parts that are still moist
and must be lightly covered

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.000
in flour, the one we obviously used for

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.609
the dough, to obtain a certain
consistency, equal and without zones

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.709
of moist, still wet of water, through
the entire density of the dough, to

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.609
then decide the moment,
the "dough point", when

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.500
we stop. What do we do now?
We're taking the dough mass, ready,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.860
we decided about the "dough point"
and move it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.850
to the same kneading trough where
we prepared it, then we're covering it

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.720
with a wooden lid. The time between
the closing of the dough and

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.980
the placing in the kneading trough
is called "puntata". Our "puntata"

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.060
lasts about one hour. After one hour
from the making of the dough and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.660
placement in the kneading trough,
our dough, let's say,

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:29.359
changed its identity, changed its consistency.
We're removing it from the madia - here it is -

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.040
to move it on the counter and start
cutting it into portions. For Neapolitan pizza,

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.880
it's 280 grams, for fried pizza
about 150 gr. The cutting

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.780
is made in this way: a thin veil of flour,
note that the pizza chef,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.870
differently from the baker,
works with a little flour on the counter, he

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.890
needs what is strictly
needed in order to work,

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.880
to avoid sticky hands without
excessively dirtying the base

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.140
made of marble or steel, as in this case.
We're cutting loaves of dough

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.238
that are usually as thick as the loaf we need.

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.830
In this case, for a thickness,
a width of about 10 cms, we'll obtain

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.400
a loaf of about 280 gr.
We let the loaf fall, depending

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.130
on the hand, if you're left
of right-handed, in my case

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.420
I'm right-handed and I'm starting with the
left, proceeding with this cut, can you see?

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.660
A cut, just like it's done with mozzarella,
here it is. From the same mass of dough,

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.750
made with organic farming
flour by Molino Caputo

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.010
that is practically a revolution
in the world of Neapolitan pizza,

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.640
what can we do? As I was saying
before, we can make 280 gr loaves

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.270
to make traditional pizzas: margherita,
marinara and all the most known

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.010
pizzas, or changing the thickness
of the loaf, make much smaller

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:48.450
loaves at the same time,
to make fried Neapolitan pizza

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:55.080
or "calzoncino", or "montanarina".
Here's a typical food tray where

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:01.680
we're placing the loaves of
oven baked traditional Neapolitan pizza.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.190
Ok, here 15 ones can fit.
In the same tray, we're placing

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.020
the small loaves to make "pizza a portafoglio",
from which derived our

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.750
Neapolitan pizza.
If it's rushed, the dough for

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:21.240
Neapolitan pizza doesn't come out well.
The dough needs a slow

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.860
work. The ingredients are mixed, kneaded,

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.840
they're not just blended.
The miracle, after hours of patience,

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.429
because there's something else to say:
when we say

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.730
that we are able to and
we make this kind of work, cover

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.050
this tray with a food lid,
or if we haven't that, with

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:48.510
film, and put it at a room temperature,
sheltered from the sun,

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:54.419
cold, moist, air flows.
After at least 8-9 hours, with the amounts

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.270
I showed you earlier,
they will look like this.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.830
Obviously, these ones are like these,
they're the smaller ones. The dough

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.409
let's say, collapsed on itself.
What is important to notice is the signs

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.639
of juncture between the pats.
It's very important, as we decide to take

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.639
the pat that we're using to make pizza,
be it Neapolitan or fried pizza,

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:22.440
of any kind, we should reach well
with the tool that

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.030
we call "stick", in the juncture,
to avoid picking up the mass of

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.849
the next pat, as this one from
280 grams could reach 300-320 grams

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:37.080
and this one, from 280 grams could
become 240 grams, so from one side

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.500
we'll obtain a bigger pizza,
from the other we'll obtain a so-called

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.810
mignon pizza. Here is the traditional working
of typical Neapolitan pizza.

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.240
We're keeping on the counter
the same flour we used to make the

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:57.479
dough. It's a obviously manual working,
useless to say.

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.440
We're applying the "slapping"
technique, so we're bringing the pizza dough

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.270
towards the other hand and then
we stretch it. We're now adding the tomato

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.700
from organic farming, one and

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:15.750
a half, in the center, then we spread it,
obviously not reaching over the

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.710
border as its function is to keep
the ingredients we selected for

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:25.789
the topping in. In the meantime,
here are fresh basil leaves we're placing

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:37.780
on top of the pizza. Fiordilatte, an extraordinary
fiordilatte from Campania, from Naples. Olive oil.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:44.780
We're now moving the pizza
on the peel. Usually, there's people

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:50.880
who move the peel under the pizza,
but we're making it the other way round.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:58.340
The traditional wood oven cooking,
just on the outer border

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.869
of the oven, allows us to obtain a
perfect pizza in a minute, 55 seconds

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:06.290
to one minute. This pizza looks soft and

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.700
pliable. A feature of Neapolitan
pizza is that you can bend it

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.990
like a book, a wallet (portafoglio),
as it's the way it was born, eaten

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.950
on the street, wrapped in paper.
This is my recipe for

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.570
the traditional Neapolitan pizza. Follow
my advice and try to make it at home

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.140
as the tools available nowadays makes it
possible for us to make it at home.

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:30.449
Use a flour, in this case, from
organic farming by

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:33.750
Molino Caputo, fresh products, from
delicatessen, genuine products that you

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:40.260
can find close to your home as well,
and you can make this and serve it

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:42.620
right away!
