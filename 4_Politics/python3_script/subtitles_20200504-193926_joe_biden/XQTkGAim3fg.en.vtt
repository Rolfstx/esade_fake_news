00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.330
Hi, everybody.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.620
Today's recipe, I'm going to be making a gluten
free, oven-baked fried eggplant for you.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.590
We're going to coat this up with a nice breadcrumb-seasoned
coating, dipped in egg too, of course, and

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.760
we're going to bake it in the oven to make
it a little bit healthier for you.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:33.060
So I'm Rockin' Robin, and I'm going to show
you how to do it right after this.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.470
Here are our ingredients that we're going
to need for our recipe.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.560
First off, I've got some Panko gluten-free
breadcrumbs here that you can get online.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.560
That's where I got mine.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.650
I'll leave a link for you in the description
of this video and you can find that.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.870
I also have some gluten-free flour here.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.500
This is an all-purpose flour that I picked
up at Trader Joe's.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.119
We'll need a couple of eggs, an eggplant,
of course.

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:54.119
We'll need some olive oil.

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:57.110
I'm using an extra light, which works well
in this recipe.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.970
And over here, I have some Italian seasonings
that I put together myself.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.110
I like to do that so I can control the ingredients,
and again, that will be in the description

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.110
of this video.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.330
We'll need some salt and some butter.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.040
We're going to start off here by slicing up
our eggplant.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.300
Now, we want to cut this somewhere between
one-quarter of an inch to a half an inch thick.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.470
We don't want them too thick and we don't
want them too thin, because if they're too

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.150
thin, they're going to burn and if they're
too thick, they don't cook so well.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.480
And then we're going to place each piece onto...I
have a wire rack here and I'm going to spread

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.370
them out and I'm going to sprinkle some salt
on them.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.170
Now, what that's going to do is it's going
to help draw out some of the moisture from

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.420
the slices of eggplant so that it will crisp
up a little bit easier.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.070
Now, we're going to let the eggplant rest
now.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.410
It's going to sweat for about 20 to 30 minutes,
and hopefully we'll pull out a lot of that

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.500
moisture so they will crisp up.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.530
It's been 30 minutes for our eggplant to sweat
a little bit.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.070
So I'm going to place it into a colander and
I'm going to rinse the excess salt off.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:11.030
I'm going to let that drain, and then we're
going to pat them dry.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.900
Now that the eggplant is ready to go, we're
almost ready to start dipping it.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.380
But first, we've got to preheat our oven to
400 degrees Fahrenheit, and we need to prep

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.500
our baking pan.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.660
So we're going to coat it with just a little
bit of olive oil, just a nice thin layer.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.350
All right, we're ready for dipping.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.950
Okay, so what we want to do here, I have my
flour and my Panko crumbs here and we want

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:45.050
to combine the two together and we're going
to add in the Italian seasoning.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.099
So we'll take our eggplant and just place
it right into the egg mixture.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.540
You can use your hands as long as they're
clean, and then we're just going to coat each

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.420
piece.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.360
Now place it right on our dish.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.280
Now, we don't want to crowd these together.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.560
We're going to keep them plenty of space between
them so it probably...because they're so large,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.460
I'm going to have to go probably two in a
row.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.060
Now, the last thing I want to do is take a
little bit of butter, nice, thin slices and

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.640
place them on top, just a little bit.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.170
These are like paper thin.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:36.099
All right, these are going in the oven for
about 20 minutes.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.990
Now, I also turned the eggplants over after
about halfway through their cooking time,

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.280
so check that out and make sure you do that
as well because it browns up more on the bottom.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.599
All right, guys, here you go, our little oven-fried
eggplants are done.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.410
They stayed in there for about, oh, I would
say 35 minutes.

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.480
I like mine really crispy and brown, sometimes
even on the verge of burning them a little

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.510
bit, but that's what I like.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.520
So anyway, these look fantastic.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:15.849
They just pop right off the tray there and
they're nice and crispy.

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.819
And guys, this would be great as an appetizer
or just a snack or, you know, whatever you

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:21.829
want, a side dish even.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.589
I want to give it a taste.

00:04:26.589 --> 00:04:29.689
Hear that crunch?

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:32.849
Love it, absolutely love this.

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:35.650
The Italian seasonings, you've definitely
got to put that together.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.060
Check it down below in the description, guys,
all those ingredients are down there for you.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.060
This is really good.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.060
Very delicious.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.139
All right, guys, thanks so much for watching.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:48.129
I do appreciate it when you guys stop by and
take your time to watch my videos.

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:49.680
I really do appreciate it.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.339
So guys, if you enjoyed the video, please

always leave me a comment.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:55.639
I love to hear from you.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.530
And if you do make this and you take a picture
of it, go ahead and hashtag me at #RockinRobinCooks.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.849
I'd love to see what you guys come up with.

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.539
And like I said, there's lots of variations
on this.

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.539
You can add to this.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.849
At this point, you could add even some pasta
sauce with a little shredded mozzarella, and

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:13.909
it would be really just delicious.

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:15.370
So thanks again for watching everybody.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.989
We'll see you next time.
