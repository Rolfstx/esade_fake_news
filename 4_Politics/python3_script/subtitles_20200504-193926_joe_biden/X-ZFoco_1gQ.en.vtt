00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.634
The presidential elections

00:00:01.667 --> 00:00:04.303
are officially less
than a year away,

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:05.638
which means the candidates

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:07.774
are going to be hitting the road
harder than ever.

00:00:07.807 --> 00:00:09.742
So we thought
wouldn't it be cool

00:00:09.775 --> 00:00:11.878
if The Daily Show hit the road
harder than ever?

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.479
And who better to hit the road

00:00:13.512 --> 00:00:15.415
than a man
with no fixed address?

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.717
That's right, Jordan Klepper
is back on the show,

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.219
and he's here
to finger the pulse.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:22.055
KLEPPER: Four years ago,
I hit the streets

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.489
to get the unfiltered truth

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:25.925
from America's
most engaged voters.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:27.393
Trump that bitch!

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.862
(laughs) We don't even see
the irony in it.

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.565
Now we're heading
into an historic election,

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:34.767
and I'm excited
to get out into America

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.503
and embed myself in the middle
of the campaign trail.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:40.373
First stop: rain-soaked
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:43.209
But even Mother Nature
couldn't dampen our spirits.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:46.412
It's eight hours
before Donald Trump arrives.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:49.182
It's raining,
and there are people here.

00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.783
How's it going? Good to see you.

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:51.984
Good to see you again.

00:00:52.017 --> 00:00:53.152
Guys excited?

00:00:53.185 --> 00:00:56.089
Absolutely.
Be here for Congress 2020, baby!

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:58.024
You're running for Congress?

00:00:58.057 --> 00:00:59.725
(laughs)
I bet you are. Good luck!

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:01.861
Anybody can do it.

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:02.962
Lot of familiar faces.

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:05.498
Doris. Carol.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:08.401
Nice to be out there
amongst my people once more.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:09.735
-(whoops)
-How's it going, guys?

00:01:09.768 --> 00:01:11.637
(Klepper laughs)

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.606
Here we go again.

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.308
♪ ♪

00:01:18.477 --> 00:01:19.979
(heart beats)

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:21.347
KLEPPER:
Since my last Trump rally,

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.616
there have been
roughly 37 Marvel movies

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.486
and one very combative
impeachment trial.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:27.854
But what else has changed?

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.422
So, what's new this season?

00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:31.624
Um, everything, honestly.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:34.060
We got this, uh,
Baby Yoda shirt.

00:01:34.093 --> 00:01:36.162
"Great America keep."
Oh, I get it.

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:37.897
It sounds like something
Donald Trump would say.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.266
-Or Yoda. I suppose they have
very similar syntax. -Right.

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.135
We're not all great speakers.

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:43.669
Do you have any
"Trump that bitch"?

00:01:43.702 --> 00:01:45.972
-You don't have "Trump that..."
No. -We don't got that.

00:01:46.005 --> 00:01:48.574
Anything
that's at all aimed at women?

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:50.309
Not for women. At women.

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:51.744
-What are you hoping
for tonight? -I'm hoping

00:01:51.777 --> 00:01:53.045
Donald Trump
is just in a good...

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:54.680
We're in a good place
of mind right now.

00:01:54.713 --> 00:01:56.115
I hope he talks
about immigration.

00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:58.151
-So you're hoping for a "build
a wall"? -I'm hoping for a wall.

00:01:58.184 --> 00:01:59.385
Uh-huh. Who's gonna pay for it?

00:01:59.418 --> 00:02:01.287
Who's gonna pay for it? I say...

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.588
That's what
we're gonna find out about.

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:03.990
It's either gonna be
taxpayer money...

00:02:04.023 --> 00:02:05.992
Oh, so maybe that's the chant.
"Who's gonna pay for it?"

00:02:06.025 --> 00:02:08.227
-"That's what we're gonna
find out about." -Yep.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.363
-Then why are you here?
-Well, because two weeks ago,

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:12.698
I had a dream,
and in that dream,

00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:14.667
I was given this vision.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.235
(laughs)
This... You-you had...

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:17.803
You had a screen printing dream?

00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:19.872
Your dream told you
that Trump is gonna win

00:02:19.905 --> 00:02:22.408
and then Ivanka
and then Don Jr. and Eric.

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:24.310
Tiffany is going to win in 2048,

00:02:24.343 --> 00:02:25.678
and then Barron.

00:02:25.711 --> 00:02:27.180
Great.

00:02:27.213 --> 00:02:29.348
-All right. -All right,
but Barron only serves one term.

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:30.883
Oh, no, two terms.

00:02:30.916 --> 00:02:32.051
KLEPPER:
No, that's only one term.

00:02:32.084 --> 00:02:33.352
That's four years. Yeah.

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:35.154
Actually, these are mostly
one-term presidents.

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:37.256
No, you're not reading it right,
brother.

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:38.891
No, I'm...
Look, 20... No, this...

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:41.928
-'24 to '28. That's four years.
-And then...

00:02:41.961 --> 00:02:43.896
-And then another four.
-No, no, no, that's...

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:45.731
-These are one-term presidents.
-No.

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:47.700
Ivanka, one term.
Don Jr., one term.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:52.004
-Ivanka is 2024.
-And?

00:02:52.037 --> 00:02:53.406
-2028.
-That's eight years.

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:54.640
-That's four years!
-No.

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:55.942
You even have
a four-year period in here

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:57.443
where somebody else
gets elected.

00:02:57.476 --> 00:02:59.011
-No. -It doesn't say anything
about reelected.

00:02:59.044 --> 00:03:01.480
It does!
It has her getting elected

00:03:01.513 --> 00:03:03.683
in 2024 and 2028.

00:03:03.716 --> 00:03:05.551
-Your math is wrong.
-No, my math is not wrong.

00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:06.686
KLEPPER:
Of course, these rallies

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.788
aren't just
about spirited debate.

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:10.923
It's also an opportunity
for Trump supporters

00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:12.358
to clarify their messaging.

00:03:12.391 --> 00:03:13.993
One word descriptor. Joe Biden.

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:15.228
Dickless.

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:16.862
-Elizabeth Warren.
-Elizabeth Warren?

00:03:16.895 --> 00:03:17.997
Scummy.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.332
Bernie Sanders.

00:03:19.365 --> 00:03:20.900
Bolshevik.
(chuckles)

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:22.101
Pete Buttigieg.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:25.371
(laughs)
That's just a joke.

00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:26.739
Well, what-what's
the punch line?

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:28.374
Ooh, man.

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:30.509
Trying to be politically correct
here, but, you know...

00:03:30.542 --> 00:03:31.777
So, when I said "Buttigieg,"

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.879
I thought the word
you were gonna pick was "vet."

00:03:33.912 --> 00:03:35.448
Mm, eh.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.149
-Pete Buttigieg.
-Pete Buttigieg?

00:03:37.182 --> 00:03:39.252
-Pete Butt.
-Pete Butt?

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.120
-Yeah, Pete Butt... I can't...
-That's two words and...

00:03:41.153 --> 00:03:42.755
I can't say the whole thing
on camera.

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:44.290
What's the whole thing?

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:46.292
Pete Buttplug.
Oh, it's homophobic.

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:47.493
That's why you can't say it.

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:48.961
Homophobia aside,

00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:51.931
there was one big, new thing
hanging over this rally:

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:53.065
the impeachment.

00:03:53.098 --> 00:03:54.533
What do you think
about this impeachment?

00:03:54.566 --> 00:03:56.102
-Does it...
-Bullshit.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:57.670
-Bullshit.
-Why is it bullshit?

00:03:57.703 --> 00:03:59.672
Why?
'Cause he didn't do anything.

00:03:59.705 --> 00:04:01.040
It's bullshit. It's bullshit.

00:04:01.073 --> 00:04:02.642
It's total bullshit.
It's total nonsense.

00:04:02.675 --> 00:04:04.443
KLEPPER: And Trump has been
grooming his supporters

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:06.846
to push back
on any impeachment talk

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:08.381
with this simple demand.

00:04:08.414 --> 00:04:09.915
All you have to do
is read the transcript.

00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:11.217
Read the transcript.

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.654
Read the transcript.
It's all about the transcript.

00:04:14.687 --> 00:04:15.955
Read the transcript. Right.

00:04:15.988 --> 00:04:17.290
-You got to read it.
-Have you read the transcript?

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:18.924
I have not read it.

00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:20.559
-But we should read
the transcript. -We should.

00:04:20.592 --> 00:04:22.595
-Look at the transcript, right?
-Yeah, look at the transcript.

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:25.231
-Have you read the transcript?
-Uh...

00:04:27.299 --> 00:04:28.601
Read the transcript, right?

00:04:28.634 --> 00:04:30.403
-Yeah. Abs-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.604
-You got to.
-Did you read the transcript?

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.839
I-I, I mean, I...

00:04:33.872 --> 00:04:35.908
I've read most of it,
but there's nothing...

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:37.943
-Skim the transcript.
-Yeah.

00:04:37.976 --> 00:04:39.312
I don't have time for, you know,

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:41.047
reading all the, you know,
impeachment.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.982
All that bullshit, you know?
But, uh...

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:45.151
How long have you been waiting
out here for Donald Trump?

00:04:45.184 --> 00:04:47.720
-Since 8:00.
-Hours.

00:04:47.753 --> 00:04:50.156
-A lot of free time.
-Absolutely.

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:51.657
-Read the transcript.
-Read the transcript.

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.159
-Yeah.
-Did you read the transcript?

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:54.293
I don't have to.
(laughs)

00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:55.561
Everyone else has.

00:04:55.594 --> 00:04:57.630
-I can read it if I need to,
but... -Right, yeah.

00:04:57.663 --> 00:04:59.598
But it's important that
everybody reads the transcript.

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:00.866
It is. Very important.

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:02.635
Pay attention
and think for yourself.

00:05:02.668 --> 00:05:04.070
Yes. You have...
But to be clear,

00:05:04.103 --> 00:05:05.538
-you have not read
the transcript. -I haven't, no.

00:05:05.571 --> 00:05:07.373
-Right. But it is
just important. -Right.

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:08.774
-Yeah. Don't be a sheep.
-Yeah.

00:05:08.807 --> 00:05:10.076
Think for yourself.

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:12.078
But, again,
just to be very clear,

00:05:12.111 --> 00:05:13.846
-you have not read it.
-Yeah. I have not read it.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:15.348
-You just trusted somebody else
who has. -Correct.

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:17.583
-Yeah. -Exactly. What were you
saying about don't be a sheep.

00:05:17.616 --> 00:05:18.784
Don't... Sheep.
Think for yourself.

00:05:18.817 --> 00:05:19.852
-Do your own research.
-Do your own research.

00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:20.853
-Yeah.
-KLEPPER: Right.

00:05:20.886 --> 00:05:22.355
Right. Don't be a sheep.

00:05:22.388 --> 00:05:23.956
It was a message these people,

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:25.758
who were being herded
through gates

00:05:25.791 --> 00:05:27.093
and corralled into pens

00:05:27.126 --> 00:05:29.595
to then be guarded over
by men on horses,

00:05:29.628 --> 00:05:31.197
knew all too well.

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.532
These totally not sheep
are ready

00:05:33.565 --> 00:05:35.868
for 11 more months of this,

00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:37.737
whatever this is.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.271
And so am I.

00:05:39.304 --> 00:05:41.741
Campaign 2020,
here we go again.

00:05:41.774 --> 00:05:44.744
(cheering and applause)

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:46.412
Jordan Klepper, everyone.

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:48.547
And if you liked that,
good news,

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.816
Jordan Klepper
is gonna be back on the show

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.218
and he's gonna be
on the campaign trail

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:53.652
for the next 11 months

00:05:53.685 --> 00:05:55.454
or until Trump cancels
the election--

00:05:55.487 --> 00:05:56.953
whichever comes first.
