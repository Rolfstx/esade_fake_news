00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.950 align:start position:0%
that sounds like a good idea we need
some<00:00:44.399><c> volunteers</c><00:00:44.640><c> to</c><00:00:45.149><c> be</c><00:00:45.270><c> colonists</c><00:00:45.719><c> do</c><00:00:45.870><c> we</c>

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
some volunteers to be colonists do we
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.450 align:start position:0%
some volunteers to be colonists do we
have<00:00:46.079><c> any</c><00:00:46.170><c> colonists</c><00:00:46.590><c> volunteers</c><00:00:47.100><c> here</c><00:00:49.460><c> I'm</c>

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
have any colonists volunteers here I'm
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
have any colonists volunteers here I'm
actually<00:00:50.760><c> not</c><00:00:51.059><c> many</c><00:00:51.149><c> hands</c><00:00:51.420><c> raised</c><00:00:51.660><c> by</c><00:00:51.870><c> the</c>

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 align:start position:0%
actually not many hands raised by the
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.260 align:start position:0%
actually not many hands raised by the
way<00:00:53.660><c> we</c><00:00:54.660><c> saw</c><00:00:54.870><c> the</c><00:00:54.930><c> movie</c><00:00:55.379><c> yeah</c><00:00:55.860><c> he</c><00:00:56.850><c> got</c><00:00:57.030><c> back</c>

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 align:start position:0%
way we saw the movie yeah he got back
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.069 align:start position:0%
way we saw the movie yeah he got back
yeah<00:00:57.750><c> yeah</c><00:00:59.149><c> so</c><00:01:00.149><c> it's</c><00:01:00.270><c> good</c><00:01:00.390><c> actually</c><00:01:00.780><c> toward</c>

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so it's good actually toward
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.189 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so it's good actually toward
the<00:01:01.170><c> movie</c><00:01:01.350><c> um</c><00:01:02.449><c> so</c><00:01:03.449><c> you</c><00:01:03.780><c> think</c><00:01:03.960><c> he</c><00:01:04.019><c> could</c><00:01:04.170><c> have</c>

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
the movie um so you think he could have
 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.390 align:start position:0%
the movie um so you think he could have
gotten<00:01:04.290><c> back</c><00:01:04.589><c> like</c><00:01:04.830><c> that</c><00:01:04.979><c> there</c><00:01:05.220><c> was</c><00:01:05.309><c> that</c>

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
gotten back like that there was that
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.250 align:start position:0%
gotten back like that there was that
plausible<00:01:05.610><c> I</c><00:01:05.939><c> thought</c><00:01:06.150><c> there</c><00:01:06.299><c> was</c><00:01:06.390><c> no</c>

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 align:start position:0%
plausible I thought there was no
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.410 align:start position:0%
plausible I thought there was no
connection<00:01:07.560><c> it</c><00:01:08.159><c> was</c><00:01:08.340><c> there</c><00:01:08.580><c> it</c><00:01:08.790><c> was</c><00:01:08.909><c> most</c><00:01:09.210><c> it</c>

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 align:start position:0%
connection it was there it was most it
 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.940 align:start position:0%
connection it was there it was most it
was<00:01:09.479><c> like</c><00:01:09.659><c> 80%</c><00:01:10.760><c> scientifically</c><00:01:11.760><c> correct</c>

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 align:start position:0%
was like 80% scientifically correct
 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.140 align:start position:0%
was like 80% scientifically correct
there<00:01:13.950><c> did</c><00:01:14.100><c> connect</c><00:01:14.400><c> a</c><00:01:14.490><c> series</c><00:01:14.760><c> of</c><00:01:14.880><c> improbable</c>

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 align:start position:0%
there did connect a series of improbable
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
there did connect a series of improbable
events<00:01:15.750><c> that's</c><00:01:16.020><c> yes</c><00:01:16.430><c> well</c><00:01:17.430><c> I</c><00:01:17.460><c> mean</c><00:01:17.670><c> I</c><00:01:17.790><c> don't</c>

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 align:start position:0%
events that's yes well I mean I don't
 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.820 align:start position:0%
events that's yes well I mean I don't
think<00:01:18.000><c> you</c><00:01:18.180><c> can</c><00:01:18.299><c> sort</c><00:01:18.509><c> of</c><00:01:18.630><c> just</c><00:01:18.840><c> take</c><00:01:19.439><c> off</c><00:01:19.680><c> from</c>

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 align:start position:0%
think you can sort of just take off from
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.300 align:start position:0%
