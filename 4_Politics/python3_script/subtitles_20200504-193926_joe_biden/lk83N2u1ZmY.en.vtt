00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.800
what we really enjoy about cruising is
being able to take our house and all its

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.590
creature comforts and go to an extremely
desolate location where we can have the

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.779
entire beach to ourselves and living off
the grid so we have dello setup that

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.090
once we have provisioned and fueled up
we can be off the grid for anywhere from

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.540
three to six months you know we make our
own power with solar and wind we make

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.550
our own water with a desalination plant
we have onboard and we have enough food

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.399
storage to support us for a long time
and so you know we can have a very low

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.109
impact on the environment we can move
the boat around with the power of the

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:00.839
wind and the weather and it's incredibly
sustainable and fulfilling way to travel

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.230
and live

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.290
over the course of the entire trip ten
years we've sailed Dulles $83,000 miles

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.200
which is the equivalent of circling the
Earth at the equator just over three

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.890
times we've visited six out of the seven
continents and sailed in every major

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.890
ocean in the world my name is Karen
Chapman and I am born and raised in

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.530
Sweden my name is Brian Chapman and I
was raised in Flagstaff Arizona this is

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.560
a little Sierra Abbott Troutman she is
six months old and she is a little sea

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.360
baby
she loves the ocean and she loves

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.590
sailboats huh Sierra yeah I'm originally
a software engineer but now I am a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:02.160
full-time sailor and YouTube video maker
I knew nothing at all about sailing but

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.930
I read lots of books I read lots of
blogs and I came up with a four-year

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.760
plan basically at the end of that plan I
I sold everything I owned I sold my

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.820
house I bought a sailboat named Ellis
and I took off on what was supposed to

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:24.299
be an 18-month sailing trip headed
towards New Zealand I was studying

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.640
Landscape Architecture in Australia and
went on a backpacking trip to New

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.810
Zealand where I met Brian and he asked
me if I wanted to go sailing for the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:42.299
weekend and that was nine years ago now
Wow yeah I never left I had never sailed

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:47.880
before and it was absolutely
life-changing I fell in love with it

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.910
straightaway
and of course fell in love with Brian

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.180
sue

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.290
welcome to our home Dulles
she is a 53-foot sloop rig ketch which

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.329
means that she has two masts and 1/4 day
and right now we're in the cockpit of

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.260
Dulles which is like the brain of the
boat is how I like to think of it this

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.659
is our navigation and steering station
what I like about it is the helm is

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.760
super protected so we can sit here we
can drive here we have an excellent view

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.310
and you can stay safe you can stay dry
you can stay very comfortable even when

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.459
the conditions are wet and completely
handle all the sails and drive the boat

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:41.359
back here we have some more sail
controls all in the cockpit so to sail

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.739
Delos we actually never have to leave
this area which makes her a very safe

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.819
boat when we're sailing short-handed and
when the weather gets bad or you're

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.569
sailing at nighttime you don't want to
leave the cockpit and risk falling

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.489
overboard so it's a very cool area when
we're not sailing this is also where we

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.319
spend most of our time so this happens
to be really our outside porch our

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.109
living room and everything sort of all
rolled into one

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:14.299
so welcoming to our kitchen this is
really a one-man kitchen or a 1/1 Lane

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:19.310
kitchen he's not really big enough for
two people and it's kind of narrow which

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.330
makes it really good whoever on the
ocean passage and it's really rough so

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.090
you can hold yourself in you also have
this so you can clip yourself in so in

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.150
case it is really rough
you don't go fine across the whole boat

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.759
we have everything that you'd find in a
normal kitchen I would say we have you

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:46.310
know it's pool sinks we have an
induction stove which is very very nice

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.810
so we don't have to worry about propane
and stuff we have just a normal little

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:59.780
oven and it's all kind of attached to a
gimbal system so when we're healing this

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.270
stove can swing with pretty good force
and we won't lose

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.510
dinner on the floor here we have a
toaster which is a bit of a luxury and

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.520
we have some fresh potatoes onions and
stuff like that things that don't need

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.980
to be refrigerated it's kind of like a
puzzle

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.300
so everything like the pots and the pans
have its place and if you put it in the

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.210
wrong place the things won't fit in
there we also have a cabinet here that

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.470
is a bunch of random things and it kind
of just extends down you never know

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.010
really what to find down there it's a
bit of a surprise here we have you know

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:49.280
our bowls and our plates and our sauces
you know it's nonstop by three this is

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.000
our fridge yeah for being a bowl I would
say it's a very nice fridge most fridges

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.490
on boats are top loading and I have not
heard one single good thing about a top

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.660
loading fridge so he's very nice when it
has a door and you can have everything

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:09.710
like organized in there well not a thing
that I'm extremely happy about

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:16.580
it's our washing machine it's just a
smallest one that you can find on the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.880
market basically but we do run it every
second day to do the diapers for Sierra

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.900
because we use cloth diapers on her to
save a lot of trash and I would not want

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.210
to wash it by hand so I'm very happy
about this feature another feature is

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:41.300
her little chair that we have strapped
in right here so she can sit here and

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:47.570
eat and be part of you know like us
making dinner and stuff like that this

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:54.110
is the navigation communication and
electronic station on Delos this is our

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.550
single sideband radio so this is a ham
radio and it allows us to communicate

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:06.680
via voice and also an analog modem via
email or thousands of miles so if all

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.140
the communication systems ever go down
and Armageddon happens we can still talk

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.280
to other people out there we have our
VHF radio that allows us to communicate

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.560
it like
close distances basically line-of-sight

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:25.050
boat instruments this gives us our speed
and the depth and then down here this is

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:29.850
maybe the craziest thing that most boats
aren't going to have this is the server

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.740
rack that I installed for the satellite
communication system so this is what

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.320
allows us to basically beam Internet to
us from space anywhere in the world we

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.360
have a couple of safety devices so fire
extinguisher and this isn't EPIRBs a

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.640
stands for emergency position indicating
radio beacon so for ever sailing in the

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.570
middle of the ocean and we have a
life-threatening situation the boat is

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:58.590
on fire the boat is sinking something
like that we can activate this by

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:03.000
pulling this cord in the back it has a
built-in GPS and it transmits our

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.130
position and our boat name and who we
are - is satellite in orbit and then

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:12.990
it's picked up by the closest maritime
Authority and they will route like a

00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:16.860
Coast Guard if they're available or a
container ship or a cargo ship or

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:21.240
something to try and help us so over
here this is our water gauge so it's

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:26.160
super simple
we carry a thousand liters of water on

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.530
Delos right now we have 500 liters and
when we fill our pickup it's enough

00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:36.540
water to last us for almost a month
this water maker is capable of making

00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:46.530
200 liters or approximately 50 US
gallons an hour so this is our living

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:52.470
room this is basically where we do most
of the things when we're inside of the

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:58.050
boat you know eating we work here you
know lounge around you can fit a lot of

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.680
people which is very nice and we have a
lot of crew on board one other thing

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:07.500
that I really love with dolls is that we
have so much food storage this is all

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:16.110
food and stuff and if you
here inside the cell phone we have

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:22.089
freezers it's a bit empty right now
because we haven't shopped in about a

00:09:22.089 --> 00:09:26.890
month but it is really really cool to
have freezes like this because if we

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:32.680
catch really big fish or if we're going
off grid for a long time you know it's

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.970
important to have some good food frozen
so we have two of those on each side of

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:44.589
the sofa on this side right now is
Sierra's Plenty area as she's getting

00:09:44.589 --> 00:09:49.870
bigger it's been a bit challenging with
her starting to climb over things and

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:57.580
stuff so we have sown a little they
don't like to call it caged but it's a

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:04.209
playpen so we can close this up she can
still be part of the action because you

00:10:04.209 --> 00:10:07.600
can see through it we can leave her in
there if we need to do something like

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:12.160
change the sails or something is going
on where she needs to be put in a safe

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:22.690
place this is where we put her do you
think she likes it yeah so if you lift

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:33.070
this up this canned food milks all the
floors really lifts up and it's deep

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:38.709
builder so all the canned foods we name
them all so you can easily see what's

00:10:38.709 --> 00:10:45.810
inside and we take the labels off to
prevent the spread of cockroaches so

00:10:45.810 --> 00:10:49.959
that's the procedure but it works well
and we don't have a cockroach's right

00:10:49.959 --> 00:11:04.300
now which is very nice one of the things
that I had never thought about when I

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:11.200
first moved on to Delos 9 years ago was
when you go off grid and you run out of

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.399
food that's it
there's no more getting more oh you're

00:11:15.399 --> 00:11:21.070
out there there is no store close to you
and I remember when we first sailed up

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:26.190
into like the islands in Indonesia and
it was very remote and we ran out of

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:32.709
tomatoes we ran out of eggs we ran out
of all fresh vegetables and we were

00:11:32.709 --> 00:11:38.770
eating for the last really, month
we were eating cans, it was a eye opener for me.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:49.600
her for me we spent most of our time
anchored about 10% is sailing and 90% is

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:57.430
a tanker on average we sail about 8,000
nautical miles per year and when we're

00:11:57.430 --> 00:12:02.980
at anchor we tend to try and stay out of
actual port ports like places like

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:06.610
marinas where there's a lot of boats and
restaurants and bars like it's cool

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:11.680
every once in a while but number one you
spend a lot of money in places like that

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:20.199
and number two we tend to like being on
remote desolate places our plans for the

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:25.300
you really depend on the weather we
travel by the wind and the currents of

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:31.060
the ocean and so looking at the seasons
ahead of us is incredibly important both

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.040
for our safety but also for our comfort
we've had a

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:40.320
sixty people fail on bellos over the
last ten years it's been a lot and it's

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:45.690
been absolutely incredible right now
it's only me and Bryan and Sierra which

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:49.709
is awesome it's perfect yeah it's very
very nice I think it's safe to say that

00:12:49.709 --> 00:12:52.920
we've actually never been anywhere that
we didn't want to go back to you

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.769
there's always something special that
you can find about the place of the

00:12:55.769 --> 00:12:59.380
people

00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:05.060
this is our bedroom in the back of the
boat in the stern the two people it's

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:09.680
pretty perfect we can even stand up we
have a little desk which is really nice

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.430
to sit back here and work a little bit
we have a pretty big bed I would say

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:21.710
he's not huge but it's nice and comfy
and cushy if it gets really hot we have

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:27.080
two fans so this is basically how we
kind of stay cool back here we never

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.950
really run the a/c
unless or in a marina which is not very

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:36.230
often we also have a separate bathroom
also called the head on the boat which

00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:42.440
is kind of weird but this so in here we
have everything you have in a toilet I

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:49.130
think but just compact this is where you
do your business and we have an electric

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:57.950
motor so if you press this it basically
fills with soft water from the ocean and

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:04.640
then either pumps it straight out or we
also have a holding tank so depending on

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.770
where we are if we're out in the ocean
it just goes up and if we're in

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:14.210
somewhere where is a lot of boats and
stuff we keep it in a holding tank we

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:19.670
have pretty deep sinks which is really
nice because I do do some hand washing

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:25.130
so it's really good to hand wash stuff
here and it can also act as a bath for

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.270
Sierra which II was a little smaller we
kind of have a combined so it's not a

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:37.240
separate shower so you had the toilet
there and then here you use clothespins

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:45.149
baby shower in there well this is our
closet it's not very big but it's pretty

00:14:45.149 --> 00:14:48.389
perfect for us
and I've actually gone through a lot of

00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:52.829
our clothes and just got rid of a bunch
of stuff and just have the necessities

00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:59.269
so this is all Brian's clothes on this
side and all of my clothes on that side

00:14:59.269 --> 00:15:07.740
but we do have some smaller cabinets to
like here I have my clothes so to

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:13.350
maximize even more storage things that
we don't get to like that often is under

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:22.019
this bed so under here is all of our
kind of store away stuff that long

00:15:22.019 --> 00:15:30.389
long-term storage so we have some extra
sheets some cold weather stuff cold

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:35.459
weather clothes and it's quite a lot of
good storage down here so I'm gonna have

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:39.800
a lot of people on the boat it's very
nice to work back here too and then you

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:46.079
pull this little chair out you can sit
back here and do your computer things

00:15:46.079 --> 00:15:51.360
which is not very very nice this is a
very very good safety feature on Delos

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:58.680
and this door is actually a watertight
bulkhead so if we would get a hole in

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:05.399
our house in the boat back here we could
close this door and this whole area back

00:16:05.399 --> 00:16:09.300
here would be separated from the front
of the boat so this could be filled up

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:14.070
with water and we would still float so
we have a few of these on Delos and it's

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:22.000
crucial if you get a hole in the boat
and so you don't sink basically we have

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.480
the forward cabin you can sleep three
people up here if you're very very good

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.630
friends
otherwise it's good for one person or

00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:36.529
two people to sleep on one side and then
you kind of have this other area on the

00:16:36.529 --> 00:16:40.819
side that's a little sofa or where you
can put your stuff and right now because

00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:46.040
it's only me and Brian on board we have
this as our kind of workroom we do

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:53.810
sewing up here this is also our diaper
drying station right now because the

00:16:53.810 --> 00:16:58.339
wind flow in here is awesome so it
drives them really fast and up here we

00:16:58.339 --> 00:17:03.079
also have a second toilet which is very
very nice to have on board in case one

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:10.160
of them fails which happens quite often
actually so this is a same as the one in

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:18.620
the back and it works pretty much
exactly the same we earn money by making

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:23.270
YouTube videos yeah that's pretty much
it we have a project and it's called the

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:29.720
Delos project and it's 100% supported by
what we refer to as the Delos tribe

00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:33.770
which are the people that watch our
videos and we make some money with

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:38.809
things like YouTube ad revenue and
affiliate links but by far the majority

00:17:38.809 --> 00:17:45.620
of the support comes from crowdfunding
on patreon where people that like the

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:50.540
videos and get something out of them
support them by giving us a few dollars

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:55.730
every time we produce a video yeah it
wasn't always like that though like for

00:17:55.730 --> 00:18:01.220
the first four years almost five years
of the trip we were stopping to work and

00:18:01.220 --> 00:18:06.440
so we would sale and then we'd run out
of money and then we would stop to work

00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.520
wherever we happen to be we do random
things like I would do remote software

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:16.520
consulting we'd roll burritos we'd flip
burgers work in hospitality whatever it

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:23.120
took to to continue sailing for another
season how much it costs to live on a

00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:29.809
boat I've met people sailing around the
world a family of five spending about

00:18:29.809 --> 00:18:34.040
$1,000 a month which is probably at the
low end of the budget

00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:41.120
Karen and I and Sierra to live and sail
on Delos we spend about $2,500 a month

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.220
and that's including like our food our
provisions fuel for the boat insurance

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:51.590
visa fees some things like that what
it's not including is the actual price

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:56.210
of the boat so if you don't have enough
money to buy a boat outright you're

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:59.210
gonna have a mortgage or owe money and
then that's gonna add on top

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:04.670
yeah Brian spent a lot of time working
on the boat yeah it's too you know

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:10.550
imagine taking your house
and shaking it up and put it into a wet

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:15.950
saltwater corrosive environment and then
moving it thousands of miles away from

00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:20.840
the nearest hardware store or anybody
who could help you fix anything and

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:26.960
that's a little bit what sailing around
the world is like and so I spent a lot

00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.720
of time maintaining the boat in fact
I've needed to become an electrician

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:38.780
I've needed to become a plumber diesel
mechanic toilet repairman air

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:43.240
conditioning and refrigeration
specialists and everything in between

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.890
it's pretty common for me to spend at
least a few full days a month just

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:55.970
working on keeping the book in shape it
can be incredibly expensive if you don't

00:19:55.970 --> 00:20:02.020
do your own work and so I figure our
maintenance budget on Delos is about

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:09.410
$700 a month averaged over the entire
year and if we were not doing the work

00:20:09.410 --> 00:20:14.120
ourselves I think you could easily
triple that amount just paying somebody

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.920
a technician to come out and fix things

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:23.120
all right now we're gonna take a look at
the engine room which is really the

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:27.710
heart of Delos and it lives in this cool
little door this waterproof door in the

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:32.270
bottom of our cockpit so we just want to
put it up like that and then we have a

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:37.109
ladder
when you climb down here and once you

00:20:37.109 --> 00:20:42.359
get down here it has everything in it
that really runs the boat so on this

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:47.429
side we have a fuel tank it's 600 liters
of fuel and that's enough to last us

00:20:47.429 --> 00:20:52.289
three to four months this is our engine
so when there's no wind this is the main

00:20:52.289 --> 00:20:56.850
diesel engine that we use to propel the
boat this is our generator so this is an

00:20:56.850 --> 00:21:03.029
8 kilowatt AC generator runs off diesel
fuel and when we need to charge the

00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:06.029
batteries or if you don't have enough
solar or we need to do something that

00:21:06.029 --> 00:21:11.220
requires a lot of power we can flip this
guy on this is our hot water heater so

00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:16.529
we have hot water showers on the boat
which is actually quite a luxury I don't

00:21:16.529 --> 00:21:23.159
know if you can see down here this is
our dive compressor so we run this off

00:21:23.159 --> 00:21:27.929
of the generator and it's what fills our
scuba bottles so we're totally

00:21:27.929 --> 00:21:32.729
self-sufficient for diving which is
totally cool we have the desalinator

00:21:32.729 --> 00:21:37.470
which turns saltwater into fresh
drinking water which allows us to

00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:41.249
basically stay at sea indefinitely
without that we'd have to go into port

00:21:41.249 --> 00:21:47.970
like every few weeks for water and
battery chargers electronics and all

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:55.109
sorts of cool stuff but it's a this is
this is really my office so having a

00:21:55.109 --> 00:22:00.659
baby on the boat is absolutely
incredible and extremely challenging at

00:22:00.659 --> 00:22:05.249
the same time yeah if you can imagine
you know maintaining and sailing a boat

00:22:05.249 --> 00:22:09.570
is a full-time job and then having a
child is also a full-time job and so we

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:16.159
basically have two full-time jobs well I
think somebody

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:25.870
Wow so this is where Ciara sleeps she
has a little beach tent as a safe place

00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:31.000
to sleep in here
and right next to it we changed the

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.460
diapers right in here above Sierra we
have all our medical stuff everything

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:45.310
you can think about antibiotic if you
have a really bad sprain if you need to

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:52.060
so some wound up we have pretty much
everything EpiPens so under here we have

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:59.650
eight 100 amp hour batteries it's a 24
volt system so this is I guess you could

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.820
call this our back porch really we have
a nice big area on the deck where we can

00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:10.020
sort of lounge and relax back here we
have some solar panels we actually have

00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:16.120
1400 watts of solar power on Delos which
allows us to power the entire boat

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:23.230
freezers fridges all the electronics
everything off of solar and also wind

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:28.720
power so we have two wind generators up
here they each produce 400 watts of

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.590
power so when the wind is blowing those
guys are spinning and it's pumping in

00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:35.680
power
this giant dish right here is our

00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.780
Internet so this is a gimballed
satellite dome and it allows us to get

00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:45.280
broadband speed internet anywhere we go
which given our line of work is

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:53.620
absolutely fantastic now let's go check
out the floor deck of Delos so this is

00:23:53.620 --> 00:23:57.610
Delos
mainmast and where the mizzen is 52 feet

00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:03.400
high the main mast is 66 feet high sits
over a six story building so it's pretty

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:09.160
high this is our mainsail it's on a
roller furling and these are electric

00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.570
motors with gearboxes that actually
control how the sail comes out and how

00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:16.810
the sail rolls out of the mast
that's what's controlled by those

00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.980
buttons in the cockpit so we never have
to leave the cockpit to come up front

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:26.230
and reef the sails or put them in or put
them out so it's a super cool system you

00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:29.580
really can't be scared of heights when
you live on a boat otherwise

00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:33.740
go to the top of the mast you'll be in
trouble

00:24:44.269 --> 00:24:49.619
you know when you're in a house and a
storm comes by and the wind and the rain

00:24:49.619 --> 00:24:54.299
starts it could be a very cozy
experience on a boat it can sometimes be

00:24:54.299 --> 00:25:00.179
a very harrowing experience because you
know your ear houses is in peril you

00:25:00.179 --> 00:25:04.259
know just the other night we were here
and we woke up at midnight because we

00:25:04.259 --> 00:25:09.839
felt this sudden thud and the wind had
shifted just enough to push Delos into

00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:14.339
shallow water so instead of floating
happily at her anchor she was now

00:25:14.339 --> 00:25:20.339
bouncing off the bottom of the ocean
which is a terrible terrible scenario to

00:25:20.339 --> 00:25:24.989
be in so here we are midnight middle of
the night winds blowin it's raining and

00:25:24.989 --> 00:25:28.589
we have to get dressed we have to go
outside and we have to pick up the

00:25:28.589 --> 00:25:32.759
anchor and we have to move the boat to
deeper water and so that's that's that's

00:25:32.759 --> 00:25:37.950
a challenge you're always sort of living
on guard and on the edge for situations

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:41.489
like that
so because we live on a boat things are

00:25:41.489 --> 00:25:47.009
a little bit different than a house in
this locker we have survival supplies

00:25:47.009 --> 00:25:54.599
for worst-case scenarios so here we have
a gigantic manual pump so if we start

00:25:54.599 --> 00:25:59.759
taking on water we start pumping for our
lives literally here we have a life raft

00:25:59.759 --> 00:26:04.139
so this is a six man life raft it's Otto
inflating if anything were to happen we

00:26:04.139 --> 00:26:09.149
pull the life raft out of the boat we
throw it over we tie it on and it has

00:26:09.149 --> 00:26:14.070
enough supplies to last for I think
seven days for six people

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:19.109
we have spare water so we have 40 litres
of fresh drinking water in case anything

00:26:19.109 --> 00:26:24.599
happens to our main water supply and we
also have a ditch kit and so a ditch kit

00:26:24.599 --> 00:26:28.559
contains all the supplies that you would
want to take with you if you abandon

00:26:28.559 --> 00:26:34.469
ship so we have spare VHF radio we have
flashlights we have food we have even

00:26:34.469 --> 00:26:38.820
more water in here we have fishing gear
we have signal mirrors if worst-case

00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:42.989
scenario were to come we take all this
stuff out and then we would abandon ship

00:26:42.989 --> 00:26:47.129
with it and it would allow us to
hopefully be rescued and survive long

00:26:47.129 --> 00:26:56.859
enough for somebody to find us

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:06.870
I absolutely love living on a boat it's
extremely special and I think one of the

00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:13.290
things I love the most is that you are
so connected with the weather and nature

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:19.680
you literally live outside all the time
we've sailed in the tropics for quite a

00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:25.680
number of years and we're really looking
forward to exploring some places that

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.940
are different for us so we are gonna
sail up to Greenland and up to the

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:34.590
Arctic and play around in the ice for a
little bit this summer it feels a little

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:39.900
bit terrifying in fact when I think
about it it puts like that that knot in

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:45.780
my stomach and throughout this trip over
the years every time that we've made a

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:51.420
decision that sort of puts that that
knot in our bellies it's turned out to

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.160
be an incredible experience so we're
gonna put a heater on Delos we're gonna

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.700
set the boat up for cold weather pan
we're gonna head up north and see what

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:07.680
it's like please share this video if you
