00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.200
Hello, Tre...

00:00:01.233 --> 00:00:02.702
Their... These are your people.

00:00:02.735 --> 00:00:04.437
(applause and cheering)

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.938
These are your people.

00:00:05.971 --> 00:00:07.974
Oh, good. Thank you.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.276
And our time is up.
We'll be right back.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.278
(laughter)

00:00:12.311 --> 00:00:14.213
-Thank you. That was so...
-Do you ever get used

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:17.116
to the amount of joy you see on
peoples' faces when you walk by?

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:18.551
'Cause even in the building,
Oprah...

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:19.919
This is the craziest thing
that's ever happened to me.

00:00:19.952 --> 00:00:21.521
Let me tell you now.
We're backstage.

00:00:21.554 --> 00:00:22.955
I'm getting my makeup done,
we're walking.

00:00:22.988 --> 00:00:24.424
Then Oprah just walks...

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.092
She doesn't come through,
like, the celebrity entrance.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:27.527
No, she just walks
through the building,

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.862
just greeting everyone.
"Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!"

00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:31.697
But surely you realize

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.733
that you are causing chaos
everywhere you go.

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.468
(laughing):
No! No.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:37.537
Actually, I love these moments.
I...

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.704
This happens to me quite often.

00:00:38.737 --> 00:00:40.039
I'll run into someone who says,

00:00:40.072 --> 00:00:41.441
"Oh, my God you don't know.

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:42.608
You don't know what this means."

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.243
And I said, "Yeah, I do.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:46.012
"You came home from school.

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:47.747
-Your mom wasn't there."
-Yes. Yes.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.216
"You were a latchkey kid,
you watched me at 4:00."

00:00:50.249 --> 00:00:52.251
-Right.
-"So I raised you, right?"

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:54.353
-Yes. -They're like,
"Yes, you raised me!"

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:56.155
-(laughter)
-That's exactly what it is.

00:00:56.188 --> 00:00:58.658
So, I-I feel like, um...

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.426
I feel rewarded by that.

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:02.562
I feel like,
I think I-I did a good...

00:01:02.595 --> 00:01:04.263
lot a good job raising people.
I did.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.399
-I think you did a great job.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:08.267
-That's what I think.
-And...

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.669
But this is why...

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:13.339
Trevor, I knew it was time
to leave the show when people

00:01:13.372 --> 00:01:16.642
who had come to the show,
then they had children,

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:18.611
and their children were now
having children

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.213
watching the show.
It's time to go.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:22.915
You know, you say that,
but I honestly wonder

00:01:22.948 --> 00:01:25.151
if you didn't leave too soon.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.452
And here's why I say this.

00:01:26.485 --> 00:01:28.154
You left the show,
but it feels like

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:29.889
we never got tired of Oprah.

00:01:29.922 --> 00:01:32.325
I mean, we-we now are watching
you on SuperSoul Sundays.

00:01:32.358 --> 00:01:33.526
-Oh, good.
-We're now seeing Oprah.

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:35.328
Do you... do you think
you just needed a break

00:01:35.361 --> 00:01:36.762
-and to do something else?
-Well, you know what?

00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:38.764
I do wish that th-there...

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:40.133
The only time I actually really

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.835
missed, missed,
missed it was 2016,

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:46.139
because I thought
for sure that--

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.607
speaking to the audience
every day,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.308
'cause this is what
I missed the most. -Right.

00:01:49.341 --> 00:01:51.077
-(applause and cheering)
-I missed having a discourse

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.079
with the audience every day,
and...

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.280
Because every day
after the show,

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:55.781
I would spend time
with the audience.

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:57.683
-Right. -'Cause for years,
I signed autographs.

00:01:57.716 --> 00:01:59.819
And then I thought,
one day I didn't,

00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:01.254
and I had so much more energy.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:03.589
What do I really want to do?
I want to talk to the audience.

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:06.626
So the audience, ten years in,
became my biggest focus group.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.827
-Oh, wow.
-Yes.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.562
And so, we would talk
and talk and talk.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:11.831
So I would not
have been surprised

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:14.467
by the election or anything,
because I would have been

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.235
talking to people
from all states, because...

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:17.737
You would have been
in touch with them.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:18.938
-I would have been...
-That's really interesting.

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:20.306
It would have been
my direct connection,

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:21.807
and so, that's what I missed.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.976
That... It feels like that's
the story of your life is,

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:25.278
you love to be in an environment

00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:27.146
where you are in touch
with human beings.

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:28.414
That's what this book feels like
it's about--

00:02:28.447 --> 00:02:29.815
 The Path Made Clear:

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:32.018
 Discovering Your Life's
 Direction and Purpose.

00:02:32.051 --> 00:02:33.352
You seem like someone

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:35.688
who's always had your path,
like, nailed down.

00:02:35.721 --> 00:02:37.023
-Yeah, pretty clear.
-Yeah.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:38.291
Pretty clear.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:40.293
Wh... Like, where do you think
you got that from,

00:02:40.326 --> 00:02:41.527
and why do you think

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.095
this book will help people
do the same thing?

00:02:43.128 --> 00:02:45.031
Just like you being raised...
First of all,

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:46.566
-I love your book so much.
-Oh, thank you. Thank you.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.000
I love your book so much.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:50.336
-(applause and cheering)
-Thank you. -Yes.

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:52.939
Love your book so much,
and being raised

00:02:52.972 --> 00:02:54.674
-by a strong grandmother...
-Yes.

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.677
who taught me to read, but what
I learned to read was the bible,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.478
and grew up, you know...
In kindergarten...

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:00.913
When I went to kindergarten...

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:02.782
-Do you know the story of when
I went to kindergarten? -No.

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:06.586
I, uh, had been in Mississippi,
which was an apartheid state

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:07.853
-when I was born.
-Right, right, right.

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:09.989
And so, when I moved
to Milwaukee

00:03:10.022 --> 00:03:13.159
and, uh, had just started
kindergarten, I walked in,

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:16.028
and all these little white kids
were doing their ABCs,

00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:18.064
and I said,
"I know some big words."

00:03:18.097 --> 00:03:20.433
And I wrote them all down
to my kindergarten teacher.

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.134
-Oh, wow.
-Shadrach, Meshach, Abednego,

00:03:22.167 --> 00:03:23.603
-Nehemiah, Jeremiah.
-(laughter)

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.606
And I got myself out of
kindergarten the first day.

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:27.840
-So...
-That is hilarious.

00:03:27.873 --> 00:03:29.809
Yes. So,

00:03:29.842 --> 00:03:31.877
being grounded in something

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.081
-that I knew was bigger
than myself... -Yes.

00:03:35.114 --> 00:03:38.718
is-is-is set the course for me
to understand

00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:41.187
that there's always something
greater than you,

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.990
and that, no matter what,
you are going to be all right.

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.758
So that should be your mantra.

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:47.560
Look at wherever
you come from...

00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:48.961
(cheering and applause)

00:03:48.994 --> 00:03:51.097
Things are always working out
for you.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.566
And when you have faith you know
that things always will.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.968
The book really feels
like a conversation

00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:57.803
with the reader
that does exactly that.

00:03:57.836 --> 00:03:59.472
It talks to you about
the journeys and the steps

00:03:59.505 --> 00:04:01.641
that you can take in life to get
you where you need to be.

00:04:01.674 --> 00:04:03.976
What I enjoy
is you speak to people

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.445
-who are inspiring
all walks of life. -Yes.

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:08.047
-And what-what I... -Because
that's my favorite thing to do.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.482
-That's what I've noticed.
-Yes, I love--

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:10.850
-You love being inspired by
people. -Whoo! I love it.

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.752
But you're Oprah.
But you're Oprah, though.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.320
-No. But it's stimul... -Why did
you choose these people

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:15.855
in the book to inspire us
with their stories?

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:17.189
Because they're all people

00:04:17.222 --> 00:04:18.591
-that I've been talking to
over the years -Right.

00:04:18.624 --> 00:04:20.526
on SuperSoul Sunday,
 and Master Classes--

00:04:20.559 --> 00:04:22.428
-You. You're on page 169.
-I am.

00:04:22.461 --> 00:04:25.331
Yes, you are. And, uh,
and a few more.

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:27.767
So they're all people
who've inspired me

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.669
because at this stage
in my life,

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:32.338
I only talk to who
I want to talk to, okay?

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:34.440
-WOMAN IN AUDIENCE: Yes! -So...
-(cheering and applause)

00:04:34.473 --> 00:04:37.510
Are you...?

00:04:37.543 --> 00:04:39.312
I really do.

00:04:39.345 --> 00:04:42.481
And so, to be, to be surrounded
by people--

00:04:42.514 --> 00:04:44.717
and this is the truth whether
you have a talk show or not,

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:46.452
whatever you're doing
in your life--

00:04:46.485 --> 00:04:48.454
you need to surround yourself
with people

00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:51.090
who are gonna stimulate,
inspire and lift you up,

00:04:51.123 --> 00:04:52.692
who are gonna give you energy

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.226
and not take energy away
from you.

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.329
And if you're around people who
are taking energy away from you,

00:04:56.362 --> 00:05:00.066
that's an energy drain and that
is the sign from your instinct

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.703
your inner voice,
your intuition,

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:06.639
to say, "Let them go."

00:05:06.672 --> 00:05:07.873
-Wow. Wow.
-Yeah.

00:05:07.906 --> 00:05:10.076
When you look
at successful people--

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:12.011
you have talked to everyone
in the world

00:05:12.044 --> 00:05:13.546
-who is successful--
-Yeah. A lot of people.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:15.648
what would you say is the one
common characteristic

00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:17.917
that you find gets people
to where they want to go?

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.353
Um, the most important
question is--

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:21.987
People get to where
they want to go

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.723
-'cause they know where
they want to go. -Oh, wow.

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.791
And most people don't know
where they want to go.

00:05:25.824 --> 00:05:28.494
Most people-- a lot of people--
are going,

00:05:28.527 --> 00:05:31.364
and being driven by what
they think they should do,

00:05:31.397 --> 00:05:33.332
what other people say
they should do,

00:05:33.365 --> 00:05:35.568
what they have carried

00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:37.470
in their mind for a long time
they should do.

00:05:37.503 --> 00:05:39.705
But the most important question
you can ever ask yourself

00:05:39.738 --> 00:05:43.576
-is what do I really want?
-Wow.

00:05:43.609 --> 00:05:47.213
And the answer to that, once you
can establish for yourself

00:05:47.246 --> 00:05:50.282
what the answer to that is,
and have everything you do,

00:05:50.315 --> 00:05:53.219
every choice you make,
move you in the direction

00:05:53.252 --> 00:05:55.788
-of what you say your vision is.
-Right.

00:05:55.821 --> 00:05:57.390
Yeah. And when you do that,

00:05:57.423 --> 00:06:01.026
the-the-the forces of life
rise up to meet you.

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:03.996
The reason why most people
have such chaotic lives

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:06.232
is because they're living
in chaos in their head.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:09.535
And as soon as you get clear,
it clears up.

00:06:09.568 --> 00:06:11.937
-You-you-you have...
-It clears up.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.406
-You have this... -And I did
this book, you know why?

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.341
One of the reasons I did this
book because you know I have

00:06:15.374 --> 00:06:17.510
all these wonderful girls
from South Africa who love you,

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:20.212
-Yes. Yes. -who say, "Oprah,
he's on the road.

00:06:20.245 --> 00:06:21.714
Could you get us some tickets?
Could you get us...?"

00:06:21.747 --> 00:06:23.115
Well, to give you context,
here's the thing.

00:06:23.148 --> 00:06:24.517
So 12 years ago, you started

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.919
the Oprah Winfrey Leadership
Academy in South Africa,

00:06:26.952 --> 00:06:29.722
which is, honestly, one of the
most amazing institutions,

00:06:29.755 --> 00:06:32.925
-because it goes, it goes beyond
just a school. -Yes.

00:06:32.958 --> 00:06:34.427
-It's an idea.
-Yeah.

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.395
You-you've gotten girls
in a country where,

00:06:36.428 --> 00:06:38.063
-Thank you for saying that.
-for so long-- No, it really is.

00:06:38.096 --> 00:06:40.733
It's an idea, where you've said
to these young black girls

00:06:40.766 --> 00:06:42.601
who are powerful and empowered,
to be like,

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:44.437
"Hey, be the best you can be."
-Yeah.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.205
-And you are creating leaders.
-Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:46.238 --> 00:06:47.673
But what you've found,
and you speak about this,

00:06:47.706 --> 00:06:49.308
is that there was a pressure
that came with that,

00:06:49.341 --> 00:06:50.976
where they went,
"I went to Oprah's school,

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:53.145
-which means I have to be
everything. -Yes. Yeah.

00:06:53.178 --> 00:06:55.314
But you only have to be yourself
because there's nobody else

00:06:55.347 --> 00:06:57.483
in the world
who's quite like you.

00:06:57.516 --> 00:07:01.287
And what your real job is to do,
is to come to the world

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.923
and understand that your job
is to figure out

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:05.724
-what it is you have to offer.
-Right.

00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:08.060
Like, what you do every night
looks like a talk show,

00:07:08.093 --> 00:07:10.129
but what you're offering us
is relief,

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:13.432
what you're offering us is a way
to see ourselves differently,

00:07:13.465 --> 00:07:15.434
what you're offering us
is humor,

00:07:15.467 --> 00:07:19.071
but what you're offering us is
a way in to see our culture,

00:07:19.104 --> 00:07:21.240
and that is what you do.

00:07:21.273 --> 00:07:23.509
And so it's bigger
than a talk show,

00:07:23.542 --> 00:07:25.411
it's bigger
than just this moment

00:07:25.444 --> 00:07:26.946
-with you and I sitting
in the chair, -Wow.

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:30.115
because what you are
broadcasting to the world

00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:32.751
is this sort of essence
of yourself, you know?

00:07:32.784 --> 00:07:35.187
Your purpose is greater
than this moment in this chair.

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.922
-You know that.
-Was there ever a moment

00:07:36.955 --> 00:07:39.024
where you maybe
had the wrong idea

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:40.793
of what your purpose would be?

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:42.161
I know you speak a little bit
about it in the book.

00:07:42.194 --> 00:07:43.729
But was there ever a moment
where you failed

00:07:43.762 --> 00:07:45.464
and you're glad that you failed
because it put you

00:07:45.497 --> 00:07:47.132
on the path that you were meant
to be on?

00:07:47.165 --> 00:07:48.467
Well, you know,
we were just talking about this

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.602
during the c-commercial break.

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:51.704
It was actually a-a show
that I was doing

00:07:51.737 --> 00:07:54.740
with skinheads and, you know,
white supremacists

00:07:54.773 --> 00:07:58.611
where I thought I was showing
the world their vitriol

00:07:58.644 --> 00:08:00.679
-and letting the world see that.
-Right.

00:08:00.712 --> 00:08:04.183
And I recognize
they were actually using me,

00:08:04.216 --> 00:08:05.684
they were using that platform

00:08:05.717 --> 00:08:08.554
because I, at the time,
did not understand

00:08:08.587 --> 00:08:10.489
-how powerful the platform was.
-Wow.

00:08:10.522 --> 00:08:13.092
So, when I figured that out,
I literally said,

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.494
"I'm only gonna use my work,

00:08:15.527 --> 00:08:18.264
-this platform
as a force for good." -Yes.

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:19.465
I will cause no harm.

00:08:19.498 --> 00:08:20.799
-I will cause no harm.
-(cheering and applause)

00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:22.568
When... Let me ask you this.
When you...

00:08:22.601 --> 00:08:24.470
when you...

00:08:24.503 --> 00:08:26.672
when you were demoted
from the news division...

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:29.041
-Oh, yeah.
-That's an interesting moment,

00:08:29.074 --> 00:08:30.543
because, you know, in life
they always go, you know,

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:32.511
-"Fail, and then try again and
try again and try again." -Yeah.

00:08:32.544 --> 00:08:33.846
But this is an interesting one,

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:36.048
because you technically failed
at the news division.

00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:37.783
You were demoted
to the talk show.

00:08:37.816 --> 00:08:39.184
-Yeah. -But the talk show
ended up being

00:08:39.217 --> 00:08:40.753
-the greatest promotion
of your life. -The first day

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:41.887
I was on the talk show,

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.656
which was, like,
the Carvel ice cream man.

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.991
-Okay? It was not, like,
a big guest. -Yes.

00:08:46.024 --> 00:08:48.294
It's a Carvel ice cream man
and his multi flavors.

00:08:48.327 --> 00:08:49.762
-Okay.
-(laughter)

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.864
But I had been demoted
from the news

00:08:51.897 --> 00:08:53.232
because I was too emotional.

00:08:53.265 --> 00:08:55.467
I would get too engaged
in the stories.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.336
-Interesting. -I would go...
Yes, I was too emotional.

00:08:57.369 --> 00:08:58.771
And I was always
getting written up

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.906
for being too emotional
with the stories.

00:09:00.939 --> 00:09:04.877
And, so, had I not been demoted,
I probably would have

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.746
for a long time continued
on that path,

00:09:07.779 --> 00:09:10.182
because my father was like,
"They're paying you $25,000?

00:09:10.215 --> 00:09:11.450
You better keep that job."

00:09:11.483 --> 00:09:15.321
So I would have stayed
for all the wrong reasons

00:09:15.354 --> 00:09:19.291
instead of taking what looked
like a failure in the moment

00:09:19.324 --> 00:09:20.859
-and being demoted.
-Right.

00:09:20.892 --> 00:09:23.963
And then the moment I sat down
on my first talk show,

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:26.365
I thought,
"I have come home to myself."

00:09:26.398 --> 00:09:28.500
And that's what everybody
is looking for,

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:32.137
the path that allows you
to come home to yourself.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.872
I feel like...
I feel like you're creating that

00:09:33.905 --> 00:09:35.307
for others now,
because now we're seeing

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:37.409
Oprah Winfrey,
the executive producer.

00:09:37.442 --> 00:09:38.644
We're seeing the OWN network.

00:09:38.677 --> 00:09:40.379
We're seeing your work
with creators.

00:09:40.412 --> 00:09:42.381
-David Oyelowo was on the show
the other day... -Yeah, yeah.

00:09:42.414 --> 00:09:44.183
...talking about
his first opportunity to direct.

00:09:44.216 --> 00:09:46.018
When you are creating

00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:48.687
-or when you are helping others
to create... -Hmm.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.056
...you have to take
a different position,

00:09:51.089 --> 00:09:52.257
because it's not for you.

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:53.359
-It's for somebody else.
-Well, you know,

00:09:53.392 --> 00:09:54.960
but the most wonderful thing,
I think,

00:09:54.993 --> 00:09:57.429
that everybody-- and especially
if you've been able

00:09:57.462 --> 00:09:59.765
to be blessed
and achieved as much as I have--

00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:01.900
the great reward and joy

00:10:01.933 --> 00:10:04.003
comes from being able
to lift other people up.

00:10:04.036 --> 00:10:06.105
-Right.
-To-to look back

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:08.540
or reach back
and lift other people

00:10:08.573 --> 00:10:10.743
to the highest level
of themselves.

00:10:10.776 --> 00:10:12.144
'Cause that's really what
we're all looking for.

00:10:12.177 --> 00:10:13.545
-Right.
-That's what I say in here,

00:10:13.578 --> 00:10:16.482
that the reason why there is
common ground for all of us

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:18.517
is 'cause you want
the same thing I want.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:21.787
And even in my position in life,
I'm still reaching

00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:25.424
for what is the truest,
highest expression of myself

00:10:25.457 --> 00:10:28.060
-as a human being.
-Wow.

00:10:28.093 --> 00:10:29.695
That's the path
you're looking for.

00:10:29.728 --> 00:10:32.097
And when you know that that's
what we're all looking for...

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.500
So, my job is...
I think I've found that,

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:35.868
and I continue to find it

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:38.003
by helping other people
to find that for themselves.

00:10:38.036 --> 00:10:39.238
One of the ways
you're doing that

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:41.974
is by creating a docuseries
with Prince Harry

00:10:42.007 --> 00:10:44.209
-about mental... about mental...
-Oh, what a good segue.

00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:46.211
-(laughter)
-Ooh!

00:10:46.244 --> 00:10:48.247
-Oh! -You can't peel back
the curtain, Oprah!

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.715
No, the man's got skills.

00:10:49.748 --> 00:10:51.417
-The man's got skills.
-One of the things you're doing

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:52.885
is talking about mental health.

00:10:52.918 --> 00:10:55.254
And I love how you-you've
called it mental fitness,

00:10:55.287 --> 00:10:56.855
-because that's how we need
to think of it as people. -Yes.

00:10:56.888 --> 00:10:58.357
Are we healthy in our minds?
You're working

00:10:58.390 --> 00:10:59.858
with Prince Harry,
which is really exciting.

00:10:59.891 --> 00:11:03.128
I'm going, what is it like
to work with royalty for him?

00:11:03.161 --> 00:11:05.130
-Uh...
-(laughter)

00:11:05.163 --> 00:11:06.532
(cheering and applause)

00:11:06.565 --> 00:11:09.034
Good. That's good.

00:11:09.067 --> 00:11:12.337
That's good. You got me.

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:13.906
You got me.

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:17.142
He is a great partner,
and I want everybody to know

00:11:17.175 --> 00:11:20.012
that, first of all,
I don't do or engage in anything

00:11:20.045 --> 00:11:22.181
unless I'm giving 100%.

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:23.615
He feels the same,

00:11:23.648 --> 00:11:26.351
and so he is a great partner

00:11:26.384 --> 00:11:30.089
in helping us decide what...
who we're gonna interview,

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:31.557
how it's gonna be interviewed,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.358
what subjects
we're gonna be covering.

00:11:33.391 --> 00:11:35.394
I've had, you know,
meetings with him.

00:11:35.427 --> 00:11:36.862
We've sat down with our team,

00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:39.398
and we're working together
on this

00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:42.401
-as a real partnership,
so, yeah. -It's really...

00:11:42.434 --> 00:11:43.569
-It's genuinely exciting.
-Yeah.

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:45.604
I mean,
everything you do blows up.

00:11:45.637 --> 00:11:47.039
-Everything Oprah touches...
-Well, you know why it was

00:11:47.072 --> 00:11:48.874
so important to me? This is why
it was so important to me.

00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:51.610
Because I have a girls' school,
and, you know, these girls come

00:11:51.643 --> 00:11:54.279
-from provinces all over
South Africa. -Yes. Yes.

00:11:54.312 --> 00:11:57.583
When you're dealing with people
who come from lots of trauma,

00:11:57.616 --> 00:12:01.453
-that trauma shows itself
in later life... -Mm-hmm.

00:12:01.486 --> 00:12:03.689
...as depression sometimes,

00:12:03.722 --> 00:12:06.792
as anxiety sometimes,
as mental health issues.

00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:09.294
And there was a time
where I had five girls

00:12:09.327 --> 00:12:11.263
in the hospital
at the same time...

00:12:11.296 --> 00:12:12.531
-Wow.
-...with depression,

00:12:12.564 --> 00:12:14.566
suicidal ideation,
all kinds of things.

00:12:14.599 --> 00:12:17.770
So I became interested
in the subject of mental health

00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:20.706
because I spent too many times
in a psych ward.

00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:24.676
And because I recognize
that the-the impact of poverty

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:28.614
and the impact of trauma
in poverty really causes people

00:12:28.647 --> 00:12:32.017
to carry that into their lives
unless it is processed

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:35.220
and unless they can come forward
in a way that releases it.

00:12:35.253 --> 00:12:37.322
So, for me,
doing this mental health series

00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:39.992
is a way of releasing
the shame--

00:12:40.025 --> 00:12:41.693
helping people
to release the shame--

00:12:41.726 --> 00:12:43.829
and the stinga from...
stigma from themselves.

00:12:43.862 --> 00:12:46.932
'Cause there's almost nobody you
know that doesn't have somebody

00:12:46.965 --> 00:12:50.002
in their family who's going
through some kind of difficulty.

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:52.871
Wh-When you speak about trauma--
is that one of the reasons

00:12:52.904 --> 00:12:55.974
you were so drawn to
the Michael Jackson documentary?

00:12:56.007 --> 00:12:57.843
Because I noticed
when you were-when you were

00:12:57.876 --> 00:13:00.579
speaking about that,
it felt personal to you,

00:13:00.612 --> 00:13:02.047
-it felt visceral.
But-but you got -Well...

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.149
-a lot of hate for doing that.
-Oh, so much haterat...

00:13:04.182 --> 00:13:05.584
I haven't had that much
hateration since

00:13:05.617 --> 00:13:07.252
I did "The Puppy Episode"
with Ellen. So...

00:13:07.285 --> 00:13:09.321
-Are you serious? -Yes.
And you know what, I was...

00:13:09.354 --> 00:13:11.590
I-I was saying this
the other day-- that I'm so glad

00:13:11.623 --> 00:13:14.293
that when I did
"The Puppy Episode" for Ellen,

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:17.796
where Ellen came out,
and, uh, people just...

00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:19.498
we had to take people
off the switchboard,

00:13:19.531 --> 00:13:21.033
-'cause there was so much
hateration going on. -Wow.

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:23.468
'Cause that was before
there was, um, uh...

00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:25.237
-Tweets.
-tweets and social media.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.740
But, I'm... imagine
had that happened now...

00:13:28.773 --> 00:13:30.576
-Imagine if that had
happened now -Right.

00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:32.744
and you had social media.
So I had a lot of hateration.

00:13:32.777 --> 00:13:36.648
But I also, when I first
saw that documentary,

00:13:36.681 --> 00:13:39.484
I realized that a lot of people
are gonna get triggered.

00:13:39.517 --> 00:13:42.087
-Are going to be triggered
by watching it. -Yes.

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.456
And that a lot of people
will not understand

00:13:44.489 --> 00:13:46.225
what the pattern is.

00:13:46.258 --> 00:13:48.861
'Cause I had done 217 shows

00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:51.263
trying to get people
to understand

00:13:51.296 --> 00:13:55.033
that it's not about one person.
That is about the pattern,

00:13:55.066 --> 00:13:57.069
it is about the seduction.

00:13:57.102 --> 00:13:59.638
And people call it molestation,

00:13:59.671 --> 00:14:03.342
-but there is a big seducing
that goes on, -Right.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:04.877
and the pattern
of that seducing.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:06.311
And that was
important enough for me

00:14:06.344 --> 00:14:08.347
-to take the hateration for it.
-Did-did you ever

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.115
waver in your beliefs when
the-the documentary director

00:14:10.148 --> 00:14:12.384
-No, I have never wavered.
-came out and said there was

00:14:12.417 --> 00:14:13.819
a timeline issue,
Michael Jackson didn't have

00:14:13.852 --> 00:14:15.554
-the train station... -I have
not wavered. You know why

00:14:15.587 --> 00:14:18.490
I have not wavered? Because
I've had girls at my school

00:14:18.523 --> 00:14:21.159
who were sexually assaulted
and abused.

00:14:21.192 --> 00:14:24.863
And I have never won a case.

00:14:24.896 --> 00:14:27.432
And the reason
I have never won a case

00:14:27.465 --> 00:14:30.869
is because when you put a girl
on the witness stand

00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:34.006
and she can't remember
was it Thursday or Wednesday

00:14:34.039 --> 00:14:37.509
-the-the... it's-it's
automatically discredited. -Wow.

00:14:37.542 --> 00:14:40.045
And so, when you're
in the midst of trauma--

00:14:40.078 --> 00:14:42.247
something t-terrible thing's
happening to you--

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.216
you may not remember
the exact time.

00:14:44.249 --> 00:14:46.485
It's why, like, if I
hear a-hear a noise or something

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:48.053
at my house, I'll, like,
"Look at the time,

00:14:48.086 --> 00:14:49.721
"'cause they're gonna ask
what time-what time was it.

00:14:49.754 --> 00:14:51.123
Oh, my God, what time is it?"

00:14:51.156 --> 00:14:53.692
So, so, if you can't remember
the day and the time

00:14:53.725 --> 00:14:55.894
and the da-da, da-da,
everybody's like, "Well, okay."

00:14:55.927 --> 00:14:57.763
-I guess it never happened.
-Guess it never happened.

00:14:57.796 --> 00:14:59.631
"Oh, it was...
I said it was that hotel,

00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:01.767
but it was that hotel..." "Oh,
it probably never happened."

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.869
So I've been through that,
so no.

00:15:03.902 --> 00:15:06.538
Before I let you go, one last
question that I have to ask

00:15:06.571 --> 00:15:08.473
that you've answered many times,
but I never know

00:15:08.506 --> 00:15:09.708
if the answer will change:

00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:12.377
is Oprah Winfrey
running for president?

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:14.346
(cheering, applause)

00:15:17.182 --> 00:15:19.518
You don't even
want that to happen.

00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:20.953
Why-why would you say that?

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:22.788
You don't even want that
to happen. You know, Gayle,

00:15:22.821 --> 00:15:25.490
my dearest friend, uh, is...
I-I thought she was actually...

00:15:25.523 --> 00:15:27.559
She was like, "I think you
should do it, you should do it

00:15:27.592 --> 00:15:30.062
for the country." I said,
"You don't want that to happen.

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:32.264
'Cause I have
such a beautiful life."

00:15:32.297 --> 00:15:34.866
-(Trevor laughs)
-I have such a beautiful life.

00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:36.935
-Why would I want
to put myself in that? -Right.

00:15:36.968 --> 00:15:38.603
-I have such a beautiful...
-WOMAN: Right, yeah.

00:15:38.636 --> 00:15:40.172
-Right. Right?
-AUDIENCE: Yeah!

00:15:40.205 --> 00:15:41.740
I have such a beautiful life.

00:15:41.773 --> 00:15:44.176
I know my path,
and my path isn't that.

00:15:44.209 --> 00:15:47.412
But whenever I decide
whoever I want to support,

00:15:47.445 --> 00:15:49.047
I will get behind that person.

00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:50.916
-We'll be excited to watch it.
-Excited. Thank you.

00:15:50.949 --> 00:15:53.251
-Thank you so much for
being on the show. -Thank you.

00:15:53.284 --> 00:15:55.220
 The Path Made Clear
 is available now.

00:15:55.253 --> 00:15:57.256
Oprah Winfrey, everybody.
