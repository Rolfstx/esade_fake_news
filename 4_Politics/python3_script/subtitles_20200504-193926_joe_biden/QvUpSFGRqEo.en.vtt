00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:18.449
About one year ago, in mid-March, 2019, Boeing’s
737 MAX was quickly and unceremoniously grounded.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.619
This was hugely significant in quite a few
different ways.

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.460
For Boeing, the MAX was the newest generation
of their most popular aircraft series and

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.369
its difficulties place a huge stain on the
company’s stellar safety and reliability

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.369
record.

00:00:33.369 --> 00:00:37.660
Meanwhile, for the US, it halts growth at
one of the countries largest companies and

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.330
employers, and then beyond that, for the worldwide
aviation industry, it puts 387 aircraft on

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.300
the ground at a time of continued growth for
most every airline worldwide.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.470
Everyone knows why the 737 MAX was grounded
by now—faulty sensors would, in particular

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.930
circumstances, indicate incorrect information
to software which would respond by sending

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.680
the aircraft into a nosedive.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.520
What’s less known is how Boeing will get
the 737 MAX flying again.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.800
In addition to the 387 aircraft that were
flying prior to the grounding, Boeing kept

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.000
production going for nine months after this
so there are about another 400 completely

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.790
assembled aircraft sitting on every empty
piece of tarmac outside Boeing’s factory.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.430
Aircraft are not built to sit around.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.520
Except for the occasional longer period of
maintenance, most commercial aircraft won’t

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.140
go a day in their lives without taking the
skies, but in this case, aircraft will have

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.320
sat, abandoned, for more than a year by the
time the MAX is cleared to fly again.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.950
The process of getting those 800 aircraft
to the skies will not be quick or easy.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.790
Getting the MAX flying again is also more
complicated than just gaining the FAA’s

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.720
approval for their fixes.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.930
One commissioned survey found that 70% of
American travelers say they will avoid flying

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.130
on the MAX, even when it is recertified.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.930
Boeing has to persuade regulators it can fly,
and then it has to persuade the public it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.930
can fly.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.590
It will be a massive, monumental effort by
the company and the airlines.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.880
The first thing that we don’t know about
the 737 MAX’s return is when it will happen.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.390
When it was first grounded back in March 2019,
Boeing expected the aircraft to be flying

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.280
again in a matter of weeks.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.950
Since then, the date of return has been pushed
back and pushed back and pushed back again.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.060
At the time of writing, Boeing says the aircraft
will fly again in mid-2020 but, just like

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.850
every time before, it’s quite possible that
will slip further.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.470
Another unknown is exactly how, from a technical
standpoint, Boeing will fix the issues that

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.860
caused the two crashes, in addition to a number
of other issues that have been identified

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.170
since then.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.569
What we know is that, once Boeing is satisfied
that it has indeed reached a solution, it

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.459
will notify the FAA and schedule a certification
flight.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.180
For this, Boeing will provide one 737 MAX
aircraft with any and all physical and software

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.050
tweaks installed, and FAA pilots will take
to the skies to determine if these fixes are

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.050
satisfactory.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.450
What will follow is a short, few day analysis
period and, assuming the fixes seem to be

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.910
working, the process will be passed on to
the Joint Operations Evaluation Board.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.540
This is a FAA-run group made up primarily
of 737 MAX pilots from around the world who’s

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.430
job it is to determine what sort of training
pilots will need before flying the 737 MAX

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:32.489
again.

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.000
These pilots will each try the fixes in a
simulator, in order to have first-hand experience,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.810
and then, after about two weeks, the board
will pass their recommendation onto the FAA’s

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.739
Flight Standardization Board who will incorporate
the recommendations into a report.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:51.470
It is this step that is expected to establish
a tremendous hurtle to the MAX’s reentry

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.680
to service.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.900
It is expected, on Boeing’s recommendation,
that the FAA will require simulator training

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.360
before MAX pilots can fly the aircraft again.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.980
It’d be easy to underestimate how significant
this is.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.190
The entire MAX aircraft was designed around
assuring that pilots would not need simulator

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.500
training.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.449
Boeing wanted the MAX to seamlessly fit into
the airlines fleets of older 737 aircraft

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:23.830
so that the same pilot who flies a 30 year-old
737 can fly a brand new 737 MAX.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.120
That’s because pilot training is hugely
expensive and so a lack of need for it would,

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.190
by extension, lower the cost of operating
the 737 MAX to airlines.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.460
Boeing boasted in marketing materials that
it would take only two days of computer based

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.090
training to certify an existing 737 pilot
to fly the MAX.

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.870
The push for limited training was even a major
factor behind the implementation of the MCAS

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.710
system that caused the two MAX aircraft to
crash.

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.650
They wanted the plane to fly like it was any
other 737 even though, without electronic

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.100
intervention, it did not.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.290
Because of all of this, very few 737 MAX simulators
were made.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.710
Only two companies manufacture them: CAE and
TRU Simulation.

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.720
These simulators are not a whole lot cheaper
than the aircraft themselves.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:18.020
A full-movement 737 MAX simulator is estimated
to cost up to $15 million and therefore the

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.910
hourly cost to run one of these is in the
thousands.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.340
They’re just hugely complicated machines
to develop to the level that they accurately

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.290
mimic the flight characteristics of a real
aircraft.

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.630
Accuracy is what is needed in order to use
them for training in place of a real plane

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:39.000
which, given fuel, cost airlines quite a bit
more to run, but, given the little prior demand

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.960
for 737 MAX simulators, only 34 exist worldwide.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:52.310
Just, as an exercise, say 5,000 pilots are
needed to fly the 387 grounded MAX aircraft.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.330
If ten hours of simulator training are needed
and every simulator in existence is used 24/7,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.100
it would take two whole months to get those
pilots trained.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.590
In reality, pilot numbers are likely larger,
necessary training hours could be higher,

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.039
and efficiency will be lower.

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.060
Simulator training will be a huge bottleneck
to the reentry process.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:19.030
Many MAX operating airlines own their own
simulators, but many others do not.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:24.150
For example, Eastar Jet, a South-Korean operator,
does not and therefore needs to find simulator

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.150
availability in order to get their planes
flying again.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.810
For the simulators owned by airlines, their
owners are undoubtably going to prioritize

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:35.551
their own pilots for training first, so those
won’t have availability for quite a while,

00:06:35.551 --> 00:06:40.229
while among simulators owned by training centers,
these centers are much more likely to want

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:44.919
to please a huge airline like American Airlines
than tiny Eastar Jet.

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:49.080
Many of these smaller airlines are going to
be at the end of a long list to get their

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.810
pilots trained.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.870
Even the big airlines will be sending their
pilots to all corners of the globe to get

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.210
simulator time.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:07:00.400
Fiji Airways, for example, owns a simulator
in Fiji and will quickly be able to train

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:06.170
all their pilots, and therefore other airlines
are lining up to pay big money to use it.

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.770
Other simulators with availability also exist
in Iceland, Panama, and more, so airlines

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:15.460
are scouring around the world for anyone who
will give them hours.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:20.690
This is all, of course, though, dependent
on what exactly the FAA Flight Standardization

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:24.229
board decides is required to train pilots.

00:07:24.229 --> 00:07:28.780
Sometime soon after the conclusion of that
phase in the process, the FAA will issue an

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:30.860
airworthiness directive.

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.160
This is the official order that says, for
one, that the MAX can fly again, but it is

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.630
also the final and definitive document outlining
what steps airlines need to take in terms

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.900
of aircraft modification and training so their
specific aircraft and pilots can fly again.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:48.770
This directive, though, does not mean work
is over and the hundreds of grounded aircraft

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.190
can fly again.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:51.740
Quite the opposite, in fact.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.000
This is where the real work begins.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.260
All of the 387 grounded aircraft have been
just sitting there, largely abandoned.

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.479
Keeping them each in the same state of maintenance
as an aircraft actively flying in a given

00:08:05.479 --> 00:08:09.720
airline’s fleet would be hugely expensive,
so most operators have largely left their

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.229
aircraft be.

00:08:11.229 --> 00:08:16.040
Therefore, each aircraft needs to go through
a process of testing all systems and components,

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.770
in addition to a deep clean, to be sure they’re
truly ready to fly.

00:08:19.770 --> 00:08:24.380
They also, of course, need to have Boeing’s
revised software installed.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.290
This whole process is expected to take, for
each aircraft, up to two weeks.

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:34.019
As soon as airlines know with relative certainty
the timing of the MAX’s reentry, they’re

00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:38.559
likely to shuffle resources around to dedicate
as many mechanics as possible to aircraft

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.599
reentry.

00:08:39.599 --> 00:08:42.909
That could mean delaying heavy maintenance
on other aircraft.

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:47.249
Boeing will also have to go through an even
more exhaustive process for the 400 or so

00:08:47.249 --> 00:08:51.750
MAX jets that they built since the beginning
of the grounding that now sit at their factories

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.220
undelivered.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:56.509
Each of these aircraft are at a stage just
short of completion.

00:08:56.509 --> 00:09:01.180
They’re built, for the most part, but still
significant amounts of work need to be done

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.079
before they’re ready to be delivered to
customers.

00:09:04.079 --> 00:09:08.540
Clearing that backlog is expected to take
about a year.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.439
Following this, airlines will need to rework
the MAX into their schedules.

00:09:12.439 --> 00:09:16.769
If the reentry happens during the most profitable
summer season, one could expect this to happen

00:09:16.769 --> 00:09:21.869
quite quickly, possibly even with airlines
scheduling extra flights given the extra capacity.

00:09:21.869 --> 00:09:25.749
If its in the less busy times of the year,
though, it could be a while before the MAX

00:09:25.749 --> 00:09:31.579
is fully reincorporated into airline schedules,
which are planned sometimes years in advance.

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:37.050
The biggest unknown, though, happens when
the MAX is back in service: will passengers

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.889
fly on the beleaguered aircraft?

00:09:39.889 --> 00:09:42.260
History says yes.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:46.329
After other popular aircraft have been grounded
in the past for safety reasons, there has

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:50.769
never been a serious issue with a consumer
boycott of the plane type, but passengers

00:09:50.769 --> 00:09:56.519
do have something that they didn’t back
decades ago in similar cases: information.

00:09:56.519 --> 00:10:01.989
For one, never has an aircraft grounding been
such a media event.

00:10:01.989 --> 00:10:06.239
In addition, before the last few decades,
flight bookings typically happened through

00:10:06.239 --> 00:10:10.079
a travel agent and the consumer wouldn’t
really know which aircraft type they were

00:10:10.079 --> 00:10:11.230
booked on.

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:16.070
Nowadays, booking online, aircraft type is
clearly displayed and, given the choice, a

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.920
consumer might choose to fly on other aircraft
over the MAX.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.579
Finally, social media has the power to escalate
groupthink in such a situation.

00:10:25.579 --> 00:10:29.550
One video of a passenger having an anxiety
attack upon leaning they’re flying on a

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:33.779
737 MAX could go viral and cause mass anxiety.

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:36.220
Boeing is preparing for all of this.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.339
They’ve been developing a plan for how to
respond to passenger anxiety anywhere from

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.779
during the booking process to inflight.

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:47.290
Part of the plan includes monitoring social
media and, if a passenger is publishing concerns

00:10:47.290 --> 00:10:52.040
inflight or in the airport, responding to
this digitally and notifying flight crew about

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.040
the individual.

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:57.570
They also plan on having employees distribute
small cards with information on the aircraft’s

00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:01.740
safety and the changes to anyone anxious,
in addition to creating explainer videos for

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.709
those who want to learn more.

00:11:03.709 --> 00:11:07.870
Boeing will also no doubt spend huge amounts
of resources conducting a public information

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:13.500
campaign to quell concerns about the aircraft
because, if passengers won’t fly the aircraft,

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.749
airlines won’t buy it.

00:11:15.749 --> 00:11:19.459
Truly everything is on the line for Boeing
with this reentry.

00:11:19.459 --> 00:11:24.170
The aircraft is Boeing’s cash cow and the
entire company is centered around it.

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:29.300
What’s just been described is only the plan,
and if any step in it fails, then the entire

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.299
process fails.

00:11:31.299 --> 00:11:36.249
Few things have gone to plan with the 737
MAX so far, so the stakes for Boeing have

00:11:36.249 --> 00:11:39.089
never been higher.

00:11:39.089 --> 00:11:42.980
There are certain things that delineate the
level of professionalism one is perceived

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.480
to have online, one of which is certainly
their email address.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:52.459
Having an address ending in gmail or outlook
or icloud just looks amateur, especially given

00:11:52.459 --> 00:11:56.689
how easy it is to get an email address ending
in a custom domain.

00:11:56.689 --> 00:12:00.339
All you have to do is go to Hover and find
a custom domain you like.

00:12:00.339 --> 00:12:02.679
For example, I use wendover.productions.

00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:08.730
Then, after purchasing that in about 90 seconds,
it takes about 30 seconds to set up your email

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:09.730
address.

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.819
You’ll also, in the process, have a custom
domain that you can use for any future website.

00:12:14.819 --> 00:12:19.980
Hover also has hundreds of domain extensions
so you can really get creative with your domain.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.269
Hover is made to be simple, and your decision
to get a custom email is also made simpler

00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:29.170
by the fact that, by going to hover.com/Wendover,
you’ll get 10% off their already reasonable

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.099
prices and help support Wendover Productions.
