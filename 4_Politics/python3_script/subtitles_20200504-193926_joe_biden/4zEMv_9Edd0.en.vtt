00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:07.529
From Phoenix Symphony hall, it's the fourth annual NFL honors, please welcome your host

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.290
Seth Meyers

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:19.849
Good evening

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:26.059
And welcome, everyone, to the fourth annual NFL honors; a night that combines

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.519
all of the excitement of a trip to Phoenix with none of the hassle of playing in the Super Bowl

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.569
so great to see so many players here and

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.379
let me just say how nice it is to see all of you with your helmets off

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.669
Well except for you, Dez Bryant. I feel like your helmet is always off

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.239
Do they not have your size?

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.610
I'd like to congratulate the two teams who are playing in Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.060
They say there's a lot of parity in the league these days, but it seems like no matter what

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.180
happens during the regular season, it always comes down to the New England Patriots versus the NFL Rulebook

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.549
And so as I say to my therapist at the beginning of every session, I need to talk about Tom Brady's balls

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.399
This story is out of control

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.699
I mean
how crazy do things have to get to hear these words on Sportscenter "Now here to comment on the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.610
Super Bowl, Bill Nye the Science Guy"

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.930
It's a huge story and even more shocking

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.860
NFL investigators also discovered that New England Patriot Vince Wilfork is actually three guys crammed into one uniform

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:46.429
Two adults and a very husky kid

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.949
But I for one am tired of focusing on air pressure and PSI, instead

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:58.850
I say let's focus on the fact that this year Bill Belichick became the sixth coach in NFL history to reach 200

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.339
regular season wins, give it up

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.479
Or you know 170 adjusted for inflation, but look

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.490
You guys look

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:19.469
If there is any group of people who won't get bothered by allegations that their team broke some rules, it is the calm, level-headed

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720
people of Boston

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.559
When asked if they thought the Patriots had cheated 63% of new Englanders said no while the remaining 37% said "you being smart?"

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.550
"Is that a smart question? Keep walking bro, I don't want to take your survey"

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.369
But tonight is about incredible performances, and maybe none were as impressive as those of MVP finalist J.J.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.370
Watt give it up JJ. Watt everybody

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.150
He's here tonight

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.579
And I just want to say to him J.J.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.029
You've been in a league for four years you are very very good at football

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.830
It is time for you to come out of your shell you have to stop being a shrinking violet J.J.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.520
We want to see the real you

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:13.130
J.J. Had five scores this year including three offensive touchdowns, three offensive touchdowns. It's what the New York Jets call a season

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.400
Sure, Sanchez loves it now!

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.010
Everyone was talking about Marshawn Lynch this week well, except for, you know, Marshawn Lynch

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.330
Marshawn was fined this season for not speaking to reporters because if players stopped speaking to reporters

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.590
How else would we know that you went out there played hard and gave 100%?

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.530
We'd have no way of knowing

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.559
Marshawn doesn't like talking to reporters though if you asked me that says less about Marshawn Lynch than it does about the reporters he paid

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.380
$100,000 so he wouldn't have to talk to you guys, usually that's called a divorce

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.179
Speaking of the Seahawks Richard Sherman's girlfriend Ashley is pregnant and could go into labor

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:13.810
Super Bowl Sunday, it seems tough to stop a baby that wants to come out, but if anyone can shut it down

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.810
It's Sherman and his legion of womb

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:26.709
You know there is some speculation that Sherman's girlfriend's giving birth on Super Bowl Sunday was all arranged by her obstetrician, Dr. Michael Crabtree

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.448
Arizona Star Larry Fitzgerald is here tonight. Give it up for Larry Fitzgerald

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.349
Larry is looking forward to spending the offseason working out and honing his skills

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.749
And he told me backstage that if he starts now

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:51.160
He might be able to learn the names of all the Cardinals quarterbacks by opening day

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.160
He loves a challenge!

00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:01.300
It was kind of a tricky year for NFL referees, and I just like to say people complain a lot about the NFL refs

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.840
But if it weren't for them, we might not have Tony Romo here tonight

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.120
Tony

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:17.289
Tony is a finalist for MVP, Congratulations the amazing Cowboy season returning to the playoffs for the first time in five years

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:22.480
I thought it was so nice that the team was finally as high-quality as the giant TV in your stadium

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:26.679
You might not know this Tony but for the last few seasons late in games

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.689
They would just switch that thing over to reruns of Seinfeld

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.990
And that's a show about nothing

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.159
Colts quarterback, Andrew la-, Andrew Luck is here tonight. Where's Andrew luck?

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:47.048
And good news so is his neck beard, look at that thing. It's either a terrible beard or a great scarf

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:53.568
Andrew, I know making fun of your neckbeard is becoming an annual event at the NFL honors

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:55.819
But that's only because you will not take a hint

00:05:58.649 --> 00:06:04.819
What was a more egregious land grab this year, Vladimir Putin invading Crimea, or Andrew's beard invading his neck?

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.769
Seriously man, give it up. You play quarterback, not banjo

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.270
MVP finalist Aaron Rodgers is here tonight. Give it up for Aaron Rodgers

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.869
Aaron had a lot of memorable moments this year, that time in Week Three when he told everyone to relax and more recently that time

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.210
In the last five minutes of the NFC championship game when he said why is everyone relaxing now is not the time of the place

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.210
for this foolishness

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.520
You know

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.520
Very sorry

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.490
You know what's so amazing?

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.860
You know what's so amazing about football is its capacity to surprise us

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:01.430
After Seattle started 3 and 3 who would have thought they'd still be here. After New England lost to the Chiefs

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.579
41 to 14 in Week 4 who would have still thought

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:11.269
they'd still be here and after everything that happened in the NFL this year, who would have thought Roger Goodell would still be here

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.569
A survivor, the man is a survivor

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:26.719
But let me say there are so many exciting things happening under Commissioner Goodell

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:33.019
The league continues to grow internationally, it was announced that for the third season in a row, the Jacksonville

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.830
Jaguars will play a game in London

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:41.210
You know England is our ally right? It doesn't quite seem fair. They gave us the Beatles and in return, we're giving them the Bortles

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:47.479
More exciting news the 49ers opened their new Levi's stadium this season

00:07:47.479 --> 00:07:52.549
But sadly since Levi's makes jeans the 49ers had to get rid of everyone who wears khakis

00:07:58.199 --> 00:08:02.669
We will miss you Jim Harbaugh may you and your pleats find the same anger and frustration

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:05.340
in the college game that you found in the NFL

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:11.669
I should also mention the tonight show will run two hours or about twice as long as the Johnny Manziel era

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.870
It was a rough start for Johnny Football this year

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:22.069
But it makes more sense when you learn that his middle name is college Johnny "College" Football

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.280
Manziel was fined

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.420
$10,000 for an obscene gesture then went 0 and 2 to in his two starts

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:42.629
And he was spotted hanging out with Justin Bieber. When asked if he thought it affected his performance Bieber said nah,

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.630
I wasn't that good to begin with

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.710
Speaking of the Browns, NFL legend Jim Brown is here

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:57.360
Did you did you enjoy the end of the Browns season, Jim?

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.920
That's good. It's it's always nice to see you having a lovely time

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.059
I don't see Peyton Manning

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.590
I don't see Peyton Manning in the house tonight, which I guess means no one paid Papa John the ransom

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:25.760
Fun fact, if you watch those Papa John commercials closely you can actually see Peyton blinking "help me" in Morse code

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:33.859
Archie, you better be getting free dipping sauces out of all that. That's what I say!  You know there was some talk about

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:40.130
Peyton retiring after this season. I don't know if he will or he won't but one thing's for sure; he won't.

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.599
I believe those retirement rumors about as much as I believe Papa John's hair color

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:56.870
I will say, Aaron Rodgers, you're really giving Peyton a run for his money when it comes to commercials. You may have actually been in more

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:59.210
this year, I'm not sure, I'll have to double-check

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:06.690
You know

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:14.570
One of the things the league is really focusing on a lot these days is what is or isn't a safe and legal tackle

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:15.589
Well tonight

00:10:15.589 --> 00:10:21.559
We're very happy to premiere the league's new instructional video "How to Tackle" so just take a look at the screen

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.529
So here we go as you see what you need to do

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:30.049
Is you lead with the belly in the chest and then you want to wrap up the opponent two at a time

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:35.929
Don't bend the arms, never bend the arms, and then you just want to jostle

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:41.540
You just want to jostle him, never bring them to the ground, never bring him to the ground, and then just a sleeper hold

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.839
Just a sleeper hold on your opponent. You got that? Great.

00:10:46.589 --> 00:10:49.219
So good luck to all of tonight's nominees

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:55.100
Sit back, relax, and enjoy the show and remember even if you lose tonight, even if you lose tonight

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.169
You can still win the NFC south

00:10:57.839 --> 00:10:59.839
now

00:10:59.839 --> 00:11:01.839
presenting...
