00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.660
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Welcome everybody. It's
great to see a big crowd here. We're excited

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.980
today to welcome Jesse Ventura to Authors
at Google in Santa Monica. Jesse's a former

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.360
Navy Seal and professional wrestler and, I
have to say, I was lucky enough to see him

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.749
wrestle live back in the day a few times.

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:20.749
[applause]

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:25.730
And I loved it and I especially used to love
watching him as a commentator on television,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.869
cause he was always astute and funny. And
he used to say he was the only commentator

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.130
who told it like it is. And I have to say
he's still telling it like it is throughout

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.670
his career. He has gone on to become a well-known
actor and TV personality, governor of Minnesota,

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.520
visiting fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School
of Government and a bestselling author. His

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.640
bestselling books include Don't Start the
Revolution without Me and American Conspiracies.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.390
He's the host and executive producer of the
TV series, Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.210
And today he's gonna be talking about his
latest bestseller, 63 Documents the Government

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.041
Doesnâ€™t Want You to Read. So please join
me in welcoming Governor Jesse Ventura.

00:01:05.041 --> 00:01:06.229
[applause]

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:16.039
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Thank you. It's great to be here.
First, I'd like to state, just so you know

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:26.530
a little about me, well, beyond what the nice
introduction. I'm a throwback. I'm computer

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.220
illiterate. Not a good thing for you.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.270
[laughter]

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.550
And I have never owned a cell phone in my
life, nor will I ever now. I've made it a

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:44.749
life's mission. I think that if I survive
maybe another 25, 20 years on this planet,

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:50.209
I can put it on my grave stone and I'll be
the only one who will be able to do that.

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:56.969
I've already instructed my wife, if I go first;
I want "he never owned a cell phone" put on

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:05.819
it because. And I'm a dinosaur, I guess, but
I enjoy it because, I'll tell a funny story

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:14.690
first when I bought my dream car back in 2003.
A twin turbo X50 Porsche, 450 horsepower,

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:21.430
6 speed that is so fast today I've never floored
it; that's how fast it is. When you order

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.980
a car like that you have to get a slot number
because they're made by hand in Germany. And

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.090
when you get your slot number, you have to
have ordered what you want. And my car salesman,

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.070
who I'd previously probably bought a half
a dozen cars from through the years, cause

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:43.201
my wife and I enjoy Porsche's and she like
Audi's and they're basically under the same

00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:50.010
roof. Probably fifth or sixth car and my salesman,
Rob, is going through the list and didn't

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.230
even ask, he just looked at me and said, "And
where would you like your cell phone?" And

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.900
I looked at him and I said, "I don't want
a cell phone." You would've thought I was

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.580
ordering a car without tires. He gave me a
look unbelievable, but then I said, "But do

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.380
you see that six CD player; the thing you
can stack six CDs in?" I said, "That I want."

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.750
The reason I don't want a cell phone in my
car, my Porsche, is because first of all,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.730
it's a manual transmission six-speed, which
requires you to use both feet and both hands

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:30.930
at the same time. So therefore, where's the
cell phone gonna fit in? And also, because

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:38.830
when I drive that car it's the enjoyment of
driving not the enjoyment of talking on a

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.690
phone when I drive and I wanna drive it. And
it's not California and it's not LA, either.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.290
I can drive it and get it past 40, which I
always laugh when I come out here and see

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.720
all the exotic cars. Where the hell do they
drive them? You get past 40, you can't get

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.400
past 40, but I got a Ferrari.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400
[laughter]

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:07.240
I mean, anyway, that aside; to the book. The
last book I wrote was called American Conspiracies,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.781
where we went down basically from Abraham
Lincoln and moved forward and talked about

00:04:12.781 --> 00:04:19.190
conspiracies and wrote about conspiracies
from the conspiracy side, basically. Naturally,

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.780
I took a great deal of heat for it. It seems
today that if you at all question your government's

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.910
story, you're a conspiracy theorist, which
means you believe in anything, you're out

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:35.220
in left field and all this stuff and green
men are coming from Mars and everything like

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.790
that, which I think is highly unfair. So in
light of that book, which was a bestseller,

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:48.400
and by the way, I might add Conspiracy Theory
spent seven weeks on the New York Times top

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.710
ten bestselling list. And yet, was not reviewed
by one mainstream media in the United States

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.460
of America, including the Times itself. And
that it was on their top list; their top ten

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:07.350
for seven weeks. Why? Why, if not just to
say the books a piece of crap in the end.

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.030
Why was it ignored? You don't ignore a book
like that, so Dick Welsh, my co-writer and

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:20.900
I, we decided, "Well, let's take a different
approach with this next book. Let's do a book

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.930
that they can't put any blame on us for, for
theories or what I might think. And so we

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:32.440
chose, and this was before WikiLeaks, we started
this project up to a couple three months before

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:40.330
WikiLeaks even happened. And we said, "Let's
do government documents." That way, the government

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.290
documents speak for themselves and they're
real; they exist. So this book has nothing

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.521
to do with any type of theory, conspiracy
theory. Every document that is in this book

00:05:50.521 --> 00:05:55.670
is reproduced. We wanted them to do that,
to where I just don't tell you about the documents

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:02.220
and give you my opinion, which I do do, but
the documents are all reproduced, in full,

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:10.460
so you yourself can read them and judge for
yourself what the document says. And we tried

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.990
to go basically through my lifetime and I'll
be 60 this summer, so we go back that far,

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.330
and we progress forward to the modern time
and we get documents all the way along the

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:27.460
way. All the documents are legal. We didn't
break any laws; they're out there. We didn't

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:34.500
break anything top secret or that hadn't been
unclassified. They're all in the public domain.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.760
And I will tell you this; this book to me
is terrifying. This book was not easy to write.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:47.500
I'm a six-year Navy veteran. I love my country.
I have the rare privilege, my brother is a

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:53.410
Vietnam veteran; I am a Vietnam veteran. And
I have the rare privilege that not too many

00:06:53.410 --> 00:07:00.520
people can say, my father was a World War
II veteran and so was my mother. Not many

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:06.970
people can say their mom was a World War II
veteran. My father has, I think, six or seven

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:12.699
bronze battle stars in World War II over in
Europe. And my mother was a nurse in North

00:07:12.699 --> 00:07:21.290
Africa during World War II. And not too many
people can say your mom is buried in a National

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:30.870
cemetery. So that's why the book was difficult,
because this book tried my patriotism and

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.090
it stretched it too thin to a string. Because
as I went through these documents and looked

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:43.040
at the behavior of my country, it was appalling.
It was shocking that we were involved in things

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.870
that we've been involved in over the last
50 years. In fact, I got chastised for bringing

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:56.070
up a word that I find ironic; I guess you're
not supposed to use. When you read this, what

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:01.180
bothered me, but I'll use it. I tell it like
it is. Where are we at?

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.250
[Jesse laughs]

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:10.270
I believe many instances in this book, you
can substitute the word Nazi and it works.

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:17.030
There's behavior in this book that is as you'd
expect it from the Nazi's. But it isn't the

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:24.490
Nazi's, it's us. Itâ€™s our country. Now,
people say, "Documents are secret. What right

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:32.010
to --who's got the damn cell phone, shut that
off. Consider this a green on a golf course,

00:08:32.010 --> 00:08:33.950
that's a hardline. OK, I stand corrected.--

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:37.669
[laughter]

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:46.440
Anyway, these documents are appalling. Our
behavior has been appalling in reading these

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:52.990
documents of the things that my country has
done. And yet, in most cases, no one has ever

00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:59.400
been prosecuted, no one has ever been tried
for any of this stuff in the book and that

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:07.370
troubles me. Now, let me move forward quickly
to WikiLeaks for a moment if I can. I think

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:21.600
WikiLeaks is a hero because of the fact that
last year, in one year, our country declared

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:31.120
top secret 16 million documents; 16 million
documents that you and I are not allowed to

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.990
see, in one year. I had to figure that must
be just about everything they do. Just about,

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:43.820
maybe, I don't know how many documents they
would have. But I find it interesting that

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:49.510
when I was in the military as a Navy Seal,
I had a top secret security clearance. It

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:57.959
was required. And I've been a mayor and I've
been a governor. Now I'm neither; I'm a citizen.

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:04.330
At what point do I lose my top secret security
clearance? How am I any different today than

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:10.440
I was before when it comes to security? And
yet, because I become a civilian, or a citizen,

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:15.940
now I'm not allowed to know things that I
could know as a governor, that I could know

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:23.830
as a Seal. Yet, I'm the same person. But I
guess being a civilian puts you at the bottom

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:32.230
of the food chain, or citizen of knowledge
and I think itâ€™s wrong. Now, the thing that

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:38.140
you'll see in the book that I dedicated the
book to Congressman Ron Paul. And I did that

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:44.170
because he was the only person in our Congress
when WikiLeaks happened that stepped out on

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.941
the floor of Congress and gave, what I thought,
one of the greatest speeches I had heard when

00:10:48.941 --> 00:10:55.410
he stated unequivocally that WikiLeaks has
killed no one. How many people have been killed

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:01.370
from the lies, the false intelligence and
the deception we got to put us into the Iraq

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:13.529
War? Also, the fact that I think what he said
that was extremely important was that in a

00:11:13.529 --> 00:11:23.399
free country like ours, when telling the truth
people accuse you of being a traitor or treason.

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:30.890
When the truth equals treason in a free society
then we're hurting. When telling the truth

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:37.420
means people accuse you of being a traitor?
The truth is what it is. The truth is the

00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:44.730
truth. When I ran for governor, I never used
a prepared speech for anything to win because

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:50.680
I ran under the premise of "if you tell the
truth, you don't have to have a good memory."

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:56.899
And that's true. I always remember, I was
in my first debate and I sat down and there

00:11:56.899 --> 00:12:02.250
were like, seven candidates standing and a
black woman, civilian, sitting to my left

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.660
and they all walked in. They're carrying books,
bins, papers, all this stuff. They're all

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:12.450
loaded down and I come in with nothing; sat
down at the table. This woman had one of those

00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.589
legal pads, you know with the yellow paper
and a pen. And she set it on the table and

00:12:16.589 --> 00:12:22.310
she slid it over to me. And I looked at her
and I slid it back and she said, "Well, don't

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:26.370
you think you'll need that?" And that's when
I told her, I said, "Ma'am, when you tell

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:31.519
the truth you don't have to have a good memory."
And I'll never forget the smile she gave me,

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:38.580
and nodded. She got it, then, that I'll tell
the truth. And I made the biggest mistake

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:44.580
in the debates you could possibly make in
a political debate. I was asked a question

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:52.600
on TV in a debate and I simply said, "I don't
know." There was like this deadened pause

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:58.760
of two seconds and the crowd erupted into
cheering and applause. And then when that

00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:05.300
was subsided, I said, "But if it's important,
I'll learn." Well, I think that people appreciated

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.760
honesty and I think the people appreciated
hearing someone running for office that didn't

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:15.660
claim to know everything. And I think that
they realized at that point that truly honesty

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:21.660
was more important to elect somebody now.
The state of our country today: We're in a

00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:29.310
mess and who is to blame; the Democrats and
the Republicans. They have been in charge

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:36.720
for my entire life. I am an Independent; dyed
in the wool, true and true. I despise them

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:44.390
both equally. Not one over the other; I dislike
both. I'm an equal opportunity despiser of

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:50.209
both our political parties. I agree with what
Ralph Nader said, "We are a two-party dictatorship

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:56.459
in this country." Now, how can we break it?
How can we take our country back? See, I not

00:13:56.459 --> 00:14:02.480
only talk about things; sometimes, I give
solutions. How can we take our country back

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:08.029
today? I believe it's as simple as the nose
on your face, if I can use that clichÃ© or

00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:13.970
another one. But unfortunately, we can't see
the forest from the trees. How can we do it?

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:23.380
It's simple. Stop voting for Democrats and
Republicans. Remember, voting is not a horse

00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:27.561
race. You're not there to pick the winner.
You're there to vote your heart and conscious

00:14:27.561 --> 00:14:32.589
for the candidate you believe fits your values
the most and who you believe in, and if you

00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:38.890
do that, you have voted correctly. You have
not wasted your vote. Wasting your vote is

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:44.860
trying to pick a winner. And we all like to
be with winners so we can all brag and say,

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:51.000
"Yeah, I voted for this candidate and he won,
or she won." But to me, that's not doing your

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:59.070
civil duty, your civic duty. It's voting your
heart and conscious. And a way we can start,

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:05.920
a way we can immediately start to take our
country back, how about this? I'll back up

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:13.800
a second. I no longer believe in the third
party movement [pause] and I'll tell you why.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.600
The Democrats and Republicans have corrupted
the system so badly that any third party in

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.870
which to survive will have to corrupt itself.
Where you've already got a two-headed monster,

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:30.750
why would you want a three-headed one? I now
advocate the abolishment of all political

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:35.779
parties in the United States of America. Turn
them into political action committees, which

00:15:35.779 --> 00:15:42.570
is what they are anyway. Certainly they can
endorse, but end it there. And on every ballot

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:48.990
in the United States of America, here's a
simple thing we can do: Remove the party designation

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:55.780
and put down only the name. It's too simple
and the system's set up for it. If your conservative,

00:15:55.780 --> 00:16:01.050
you don't need to know anybody's name. You
look for the party, Republican, Republican,

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:07.709
Republican. If you're Liberal, you don't need
to know a name, Democrat, Democrat, Democrat.

00:16:07.709 --> 00:16:13.720
By only putting down the name, would then
require you, as a voter, to educate yourself.

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:19.320
What does John Smith stand for? 'Cause you
wouldn't have that crutch in there that would

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.730
tell you Conservative or Democrat. And then
there's one, and you in California can get

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:29.470
away with this stuff because you've got that
nonsense where you can put everything on the

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:38.670
ballot. The next thing would be simply this:
how about on every state, local, and national

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:46.519
ballot, we offer the final choice at the bottom
that you can vote for, "none of the above."

00:16:46.519 --> 00:16:51.560
Now, people laugh at that, but what that truly
is is a vote of no confidence in government.

00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:58.160
That could do volumes; huge. Cause imagine
for a moment, let's say I'm a Democrat and

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:06.049
I defeated my Republican opponent for Congress
but I lost to none of the above. More people

00:17:06.049 --> 00:17:11.860
cast their vote for none of the above than
what I got. Wouldn't that make them go out

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:17.350
there with a change of attitude? You lost
to nobody. Yes, you're the Congressman, or

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:23.280
the Congresswoman, but you lost to none of
the above. And I'm willing to bet, right now,

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:28.910
there are elections in this country where
none of the above would prevail. And that's

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:35.200
what's wrong with that, a vote of no confidence?
That would send a huge message, huge, to every

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:43.679
elected official. Imagine these ideas coming
from a pro-wrestler. I didn't go to college.

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:49.670
I didn't, I'm not a political science major
and I'm certainly not a lawyer. Imagine that.

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:55.970
All these ideas that this pro-wrestler comes
up with. But anyway, those are a few of the

00:17:55.970 --> 00:18:00.900
things that as you look into this book, and
I will open up here for questions in a minute,

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:04.690
because that's usually the best way. I don't
wanna just lecture, lecture, lecture. I'd

00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:11.020
like to answer questions on what's on your
mind. But as you look through this book, I

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:17.559
hope it does frighten you. I hope that it's
a wake-up call. I hope that you will be engaged

00:18:17.559 --> 00:18:24.210
citizens, stop being lemmings because right
now we're a country full of lemmings. We can

00:18:24.210 --> 00:18:29.260
march right off the cliff and we don't even
look left or right. Why? It's the dumbing

00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:35.450
down of America because of our media; our
media. Our media was supposed to be the fourth

00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:41.280
branch of government. They were supposed to
be the watchdog of the other three to report

00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:45.480
back to us. Well, they're not anymore. They're
in bed with the government. They're the government's

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:53.169
mouthpiece now. They're no longer a watchdog.
Cases in point, what's the top story these

00:18:53.169 --> 00:18:59.080
last three, four weeks? Charlie Sheen. You
can't turn the news on now without hearing

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:05.919
a report on Charlie Sheen. Now, Charlie, he's
got some problems. I feel bad for him, but

00:19:05.919 --> 00:19:11.300
he hardly deserves but maybe a mention at
the end of the news, not a lead story. And

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:18.320
what was it a year, year and a half ago? The
main story the death of Anna Nicole Smith.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:25.020
I almost threw up. Every day they're doing
mobiles. They're sending down mobile reporters

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:29.799
outside the hotel. "Well, we're down here
in wherever she was, the Bahamas, or wherever

00:19:29.799 --> 00:19:34.440
the hell it happened, and we're in front of
the hotel where Anna Nicole Smith died." Hey,

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:42.030
I was alive in '63 when John Kennedy was assassinated.
Anna Nicole Smith got way more press in the

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:47.340
end than the assassination of our President,
because her's went on. It's still got legs.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.490
I just saw it the other day. Some judge made
a ruling to give her house to her boyfriend

00:19:52.490 --> 00:20:00.370
or something. That's newsworthy? It's like
when I was supposed to have a television show

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:05.740
on MSNBC, but that's a whole other matter.
They tried to tell me what I was supposed

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:11.540
to cover every day and at the time, you'll
recall, you remember the murder you had here

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:16.120
where the guy killed his wife out in the boat
or whatever a couple years ago?

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.120
&gt;&gt;Unknown audience 1: Peterson.

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.120
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Pardon me?

00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120
&gt;&gt;Unknown audience 1: Peterson.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.600
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Pet-, yeah. That murder. Well, they
were shoving that down my throat every day

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:30.360
to cover that and I go, "Wait a minute. There's
ten thousand murders a year." Now, that was

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:36.980
a tragic murder, but there are ten thousand
murders a year, every year. How is this one

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:42.980
so important? Now, it might be important to
all you Californians because you live here.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:49.169
It's close to you. But go back to Minnesota
with me. We have our own murders. Why do we

00:20:49.169 --> 00:20:55.480
need to know about yours? And yet, every night,
every night, day in and day out, that is the

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:03.220
dumbing down of America by our news media.
And we're at fault because we accept it because

00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:09.100
we like this titillating journalism. And you
know what the downfall was to our news? The

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:16.160
show 60 Minutes. Now, let's hear me out. 60
Minute's a marvelous show, but here's when

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:22.390
it was the downfall. Up until that point in
time, pre-60 Minutes, the news departments

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:28.940
lost money so they would make it up in the
entertainment division cause they felt, "Well,

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:36.030
we'll lose money but it's our job to inform."
Right? Along comes 60 Minutes. Low and behold,

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:43.410
it goes to number one in the ratings. The
bean counters upstairs, the light goes off.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:49.860
"You mean we can make money with the news?"
There was your downfall because from that

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:56.830
point on, the news became about making money,
not informing you. It became ratings rather

00:21:56.830 --> 00:22:03.530
than information to smarten you up. Now, you
have, and here's the dangerous part because

00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:10.410
of that, you now have the news; they're into
creating the news, not into reporting it and

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:18.820
that's very, very dangerous in my opinion,
very dangerous. So, it's up to us to be vigilant

00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:25.480
citizens. Tom Jefferson said, "Dissention
is the greatest form of patriotism," and I

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:32.270
believe that and I endorse that completely.
There's nothing wrong with dissenting. There's

00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:36.890
nothing wrong with holding elected officials
feet to the fire. If you don't, you will get

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:44.100
bad government. So, I hope you'll read this
book. I hope that you'll digest the documents

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:49.750
that are in it. I hope you're as shocked as
I am about what some of the documents are

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:53.799
and if there's any in particular that you
see and would like ask me about as you look

00:22:53.799 --> 00:22:59.660
into the book, feel free to do so. I won't
go into them now, because reading is supposed

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:03.740
to be pleasure and it's supposed to be you
doing it. So I'm not going to, unless you

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:09.490
ask me specifically, I'm not going to go into
the things that are in the book, but I will

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:18.549
do this. I opened and closed the book, more
or less, with two quotations. The first quotation

00:23:18.549 --> 00:23:26.880
comes from my particular favorite President
my whole life, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:33.200
And here's what President Kennedy said to
us, "There is little value in ensuring the

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:40.289
survival of our nation if our traditions do
not survive with it. And there's a very grave

00:23:40.289 --> 00:23:50.200
danger that an announced need for increased
security will be seized upon by those anxious

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:58.770
to expand its meaning to the very limits of
official censorship and concealment." Sounds

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:05.870
familiar, doesn't it? We're gonna keep you
safe, right? Then, I like to finish off also,

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:12.490
just to show it runs through our entire country's
history. I'll quote Patrick Henry. Most of

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:17.809
us remember Patrick Henry as saying "give
me liberty or give me death." That was a great

00:24:17.809 --> 00:24:26.130
quote, brave quote. But he also said this.
Patrick Henry, quote, "The liberties of a

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:34.110
people never were, nor ever will be secure
when the transactions of their rulers may

00:24:34.110 --> 00:24:43.520
be concealed from them." And I think that
those are two real great Americans, and the

00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:51.330
words they speak are, in my opinion, very
true. So on that note, I'd like to say thank

00:24:51.330 --> 00:24:56.540
you, Google, for having me here. Lunch was
terrific. It's a remarkable company, I heard,

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:59.670
that feeds you. Geez, you're like the Navy.

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:00.870
[laughter]

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:08.490
Well, they used to feed me. Three hots and
a cot all the time and no, actually, I'll

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:14.880
will tell you this. I was the Naval Amphib
base, Coronado, California and we won Best

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:20.690
Chow Hall for like, eleven years in a row
in the 11th Naval District. Every Thursday,

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:27.240
we would have steak and lobster in the Navy.
And I was on what they call "COMRATS" because

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.919
community ration type thing, because our jobs
take us away from the base so often as a Seal

00:25:32.919 --> 00:25:38.919
that they pay you money. And so, you have
to eat, paid to eat at the Chow Hall when

00:25:38.919 --> 00:25:46.880
you're there. But I think lunch was 65 cents
and you'd get steak and lobster. So that's

00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:52.880
not a bad price. Of course, then again, let's
remember this was way back in early 70s when

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:59.250
the economy was much different, but so was
my salary. Cause when I joined the Navy initially,

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:06.390
I made 122 bucks a month; 61 dollars a paycheck.
And I'd blow it that first weekend and then

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:12.010
be stuck on the base the rest of the time.
'Cause I wasn't very economically sound back

00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:17.640
then, I guess. So thank you very much. It
was a pleasure for me to be here and now I'll

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.640
open up for questions.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:25.950
[applause]

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:38.059
I'll tell you, excuse me, that's a first.
No one, other than the hand finally, I've

00:26:38.059 --> 00:26:41.750
never done a speech where everybody froze
and didn't ask a question.

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:42.750
[laughter]

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:43.750
Go ahead, sir.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:45.530
&gt;&gt;Male audience 1: This is kind of a two-part
question. First--

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:49.970
&gt;&gt;Jesse: OK, but give it to me one part at
a time. I've been on the road for two weeks

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:54.230
and I'm going on about four hours a night
every night. I'm dog tired. So, slow and easy.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:59.600
&gt;&gt; Male audience 1: Sure, sure. What was your
motivation to run governor back when you did?

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:05.500
And the second part is simply, in being a
governor in the state, what was the one thing

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.000
you walked away with that you've learned the
most about how our government works?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.490
&gt;&gt;Jesse: OK, my motivation and I'll give you
my first, my fun motivation. This is the joke.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:22.000
There's a gentleman in Minnesota by the name
of, a great businessman, by the name of Wheelock

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:28.150
Whitney, and when I first won governor I was
speaking to a group of businessmen and Wheelock

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:34.340
was there. And they asked me the same question,
"What motivated you to become governor?" And

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:39.840
I looked right at Wheelock Whitney and I said,
"Well, I was a mayor and it didn't work, so

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:45.001
I figure if I get to be governor, it will
work." Well, Wheelock Whitney happens to be

00:27:45.001 --> 00:27:51.061
a member of Augusta National where they play
the Masters. And I said, "I figured if I won

00:27:51.061 --> 00:27:56.690
governor, Wheelock Whitney would then take
me to Augusta and let me play Augusta, Georgia",

00:27:56.690 --> 00:28:01.779
which is the heaven of professional golf.
And then I looked at Wheelock and said, "Wheelock,

00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:04.140
don't force me to have to become President."

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.710
[laughter]

00:28:05.710 --> 00:28:10.390
And he was a man, he burst out laughing and
he said, "You're going to Augusta." And sure

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:15.480
enough, he was good enough to take me there
and I got to play Augusta National and if

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:21.529
you're a golfer, that's the same, I think,
as going to heaven. Now on a serious note,

00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:27.200
what inspired me to become governor was something
really interesting. Let's move back if we

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:34.830
may, to 1998, when our economies were robust,
remember that? Interest was nothing. Everybody

00:28:34.830 --> 00:28:40.260
was making huge money. Well, the State of
Minnesota was in such fiscal shape then, they

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:46.110
were getting budget surpluses. In other words,
they did their budget but because the economy

00:28:46.110 --> 00:28:51.540
was so robust, they were bringing in more
than what they budgeted for. Well, the one

00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.880
year, guess what they did? They spent it.
They thought they were kids in a candy store.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:29:01.260
They thought, "Whoa. We brought in more money
than what we budgeted for. That means we can

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.550
go buy extra stuff." Well , I was outraged.
I was doing talk radio and I said, "Wait a

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:11.190
minute. If they brought in more money than
what their budget needed, then that money

00:29:11.190 --> 00:29:18.110
should be returned to the tax payers." So
I basically ran on that. I said, I was doing

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:23.659
talk radio and I was so angry, I said, "Maybe
I should run for governor." Then you backed

00:29:23.659 --> 00:29:27.310
yourself in a corner and of course, on talk
radio, if you lose your credibility you're

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:34.820
nothing. And so, I forced myself. I had to
run and I can honestly say, pre-9/11, we had

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:41.000
three more robust economy years and I gave
back tax rebates to every citizen of Minnesota.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:47.720
They named them "Jesse checks." And I did
it even over the, you'd think the Republicans

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:53.250
would have gone with me all the way, but they
wanted it to be an income tax rebate. Well,

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:58.360
an income tax rebate means you gotta declare
it, which means then it's part of your income

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:02.510
which means the federal government's gonna
take a third of it. And I thought, "This isn't

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:09.090
the Feds money, it's ours." So I did it. It
was successful in a sales tax rebate because

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:14.710
you can't deduct a sales tax so therefore,
they can't take the money. So when you got

00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:21.500
your check, you could spend it. Now there
is a true stimulus package, not the bullshit

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:27.299
you're getting today. The stimulus package,
if you wanna get, send the money to the people.

00:30:27.299 --> 00:30:34.600
The people will spend it that will go spur
the economy. I met an old woman, elderly woman.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:40.370
And she came up to me, she told me, "Governor,"
she said. "Thank you for that Jesse check."

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:44.600
I said, "You're welcome, ma'am." She said,
"You know what I did with it?" I said, "What?"

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:49.940
She said, "I needed a new lawn mower. And
I went down and bought it and I named my lawn

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:50.940
mower Jesse."

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:52.370
[laughter]

00:30:52.370 --> 00:30:58.831
And I was very flattered over that, this elderly
woman who wanted a new powered lawn mower

00:30:58.831 --> 00:31:05.460
for her backyard. 'Cause contrary to LA, we
in Minnesota do have backyards. They have

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:13.730
grass and trees, too. I gotta dig California
occasionally. So that was what really inspired

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:18.510
me to run was that budget where they didn't
give back the surplus money to the people.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:23.419
It was our money and they were spending it
like kids in a candy store. So, next question.

00:31:23.419 --> 00:31:30.510
Right here. Actually, we'll go closer to the
mic. I'll get to everyone, but we'll try to

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:31.720
keep it close to the mic. Yes, ma'am.

00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:35.490
&gt;&gt;Female Audience 1: Have you ever considered
running for a Presidential election in 2012?

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:36.490
&gt;&gt;Jesse: President?

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:37.490
&gt;&gt; Female Audience 1: Yes, in 2012.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:42.510
&gt;&gt;Jesse: I've considered it. I've thought
about it. And I'll be very honest. As an Independent,

00:31:42.510 --> 00:31:47.790
the cards are against you because you'd think
it was a universal thing; if you're running

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:52.909
for President, every state to qualify should
be the same, correct? But itâ€™s not; they

00:31:52.909 --> 00:31:57.190
do that on purpose. Every state, you have
to jump through different hoops to get ballot

00:31:57.190 --> 00:32:03.950
access and when you try to get it, the Democrats
and Republicans will bring lawsuits then to

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:08.529
tie you up in court so that by the time you
get through with court the election's already

00:32:08.529 --> 00:32:14.169
passed you by. That's the system they've created
to keep anyone else out of the game. It's

00:32:14.169 --> 00:32:18.580
like playing a football game and they get
to be the referees and they can also change

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.060
the rules at half time. That's what you're
up against.

00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.700
&gt;&gt;Unknown audience 2: [inaudible]

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.929
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Right in, well other than that fiasco,
unbelievable in Alaska where it worked, I

00:32:28.929 --> 00:32:34.169
have never, ever seen a write-in candidate
ever win. But Alaska did give me a slight

00:32:34.169 --> 00:32:39.059
ray of hope cause it happened up there, but
let's remember, those are Alaskans and there's

00:32:39.059 --> 00:32:44.539
not exactly as many of them as there are Californians
or the rest of the country. Smaller numbers,

00:32:44.539 --> 00:32:48.790
you'd have a better chance. The bigger numbers
you're dealing with, the more difficult it

00:32:48.790 --> 00:32:54.850
would be. Now, say now though the Libertarians,
which I am kind of Liber-, I like to think

00:32:54.850 --> 00:33:00.100
of myself as libertarian--small L, not capital
because the true Libertarian believes there

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:04.480
isn't, there should be no government. That's
an anarchist. I understand that there should

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:11.250
be at least some government; that government
does have a role. The other part of that question

00:33:11.250 --> 00:33:17.980
of will I run is this, being President is
an oxymoron. What I mean by that is that you

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:24.030
stand for freedom but you yourself have none.
When you hold those jobs you give up your

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:30.020
freedom. It's gone and I like my freedom.
I like living in Mexico now, because down

00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:34.840
there I'm just a big gringo. Nobody pays,
other than being a big guy, they'll look at

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.919
me but they don't know who I am. And I enjoy
that right now after the career I've had.

00:33:39.919 --> 00:33:45.250
So it would require me to have to want, as
I like to refer to it, it would require me

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:51.300
to want to go back to jail. Now, not saying
I won't do it and I'll tell you something

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:57.140
else honestly. Before I put my butt on the
line, this country better show me itâ€™s worth

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:03.280
it. You better show me itâ€™s worth it this
time. I've already done four years as a mayor,

00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.630
four years as a governor and six years in
the Navy. That's 14 years of my life I've

00:34:07.630 --> 00:34:14.669
given to the public. And to do that job, I
need to know itâ€™s worth it. And right now,

00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:20.690
the people of this country are not showing
me that. They're starting to. I like the protest

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:27.019
in Wisconsin and I like how things are stirring
up, but in order for me to win we gotta think

00:34:27.019 --> 00:34:36.139
revolutionary. In order for me to win, you
gotta be ready to elect Che Guevara because

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:43.359
I will change things if I won. And what would
I do? I'll tell you what I would do. First

00:34:43.359 --> 00:34:48.780
thing I would do, I would cut defense spending,
which is something, I don't know if you can

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:54.889
win off that because they use fear on you,
that, "Oh, if you cut defense spending we're

00:34:54.889 --> 00:35:00.920
all gonna get killed. We're all gonna be."
Well, I would close every base we have throughout

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.950
the world and I would bring our young men
and women home and back to our own country

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:10.299
and we would defend our country from here.
We wouldn't be colonizing anymore, or creating

00:35:10.299 --> 00:35:16.410
this empire. We're following the Roman Empire
right now. So that's why, and that would cut

00:35:16.410 --> 00:35:20.989
spending. If you're truly gonna balance the
budget, you can't do it without cutting defense

00:35:20.989 --> 00:35:25.019
spending because that's the biggest thing
out there. And how many times can we blow

00:35:25.019 --> 00:35:32.109
up the world? We've got technology, you're
at Google here. We got technology now and

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:37.180
weapons we don't need. Why do we have 50 thousand
troops in Germany; fifty thousand troops in

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:43.180
Korea; fifty thousand troops in Japan? Seems
to me those wars were over 50 years ago. Why

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:49.380
do we still have troops there? So those are
a few of the things I would do. You call me

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:55.440
radical, I guess, because I would not be doing
what mainstream does. I'm so disappointed

00:35:55.440 --> 00:36:02.479
in Barack Obama. I really thought he's a dynamic
speaker, but I really thought there's no change.

00:36:02.479 --> 00:36:06.509
I can't tell the difference between him and
Bush, just that he can read a teleprompter.

00:36:06.509 --> 00:36:07.910
[laughter]

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:15.979
But other than that, I don't see any change
and so, also it's difficult. He's an incumbent

00:36:15.979 --> 00:36:21.390
and as an Independent that's tough. You're
better off when the incumbent leaves and the

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:28.200
election's open, which would be 2016. And
by then, I'll be that much older and I don't

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:32.229
know if I would have any energy at that point
to want to do the job. But it's hard to beat

00:36:32.229 --> 00:36:38.239
an incumbent, people, very hard. When I ran
for governor it was because there was no incumbent

00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:43.059
governor, which opened it up for me to do
that. So, next question.

00:36:43.059 --> 00:36:51.339
[pause]
And you can go on any topic. I'm not, you

00:36:51.339 --> 00:36:52.339
know.

00:36:52.339 --> 00:36:56.000
&gt;&gt;Male audience 3: I've also got two questions
and I'll just give them both to you at once

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.219
'cause I'm pretty sure you can remember the
first one.

00:36:58.219 --> 00:36:59.219
&gt;&gt;Jesse: All right.

00:36:59.219 --> 00:37:02.880
&gt;&gt; Male audience 3: First one is what color
is your Porsche? And the second one is, so

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.959
you've got 63 documents in here.

00:37:04.959 --> 00:37:05.959
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Yup.

00:37:05.959 --> 00:37:08.599
&gt;&gt; Male audience 3: I'm sure there were many
more. Do you have any examples of what other

00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:11.039
documents you would have liked to have included?

00:37:11.039 --> 00:37:16.219
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Not really. It was tough enough doing
the 63. We chose 63 because that was the year

00:37:16.219 --> 00:37:22.539
John Kennedy was assassinated and murdered.
So we thought that was a good number. I don't

00:37:22.539 --> 00:37:29.089
want to go into any, these are enough. Digest
these and what color is my Porsche? It's like

00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:34.410
a lapis blue metallic, which is that, I had
to think a minute because they got those names

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:41.369
for every color, which is a very deep, dark
blue. And then I got the beige interior with

00:37:41.369 --> 00:37:48.229
it and I got the most wood that you could
get on the interior and that was sick, really.

00:37:48.229 --> 00:37:52.530
I wasn't gonna get it at first till I came
home and I told my wife and she looked at

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:57.809
me and she says, "It's your dream car; don't
hold back. Get everything on it you want."

00:37:57.809 --> 00:38:02.940
Well, the wood alone, because itâ€™s all hand-carved,
it runs across the top, around all the speakers,

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:09.910
the wood alone was ten grand. And I thought,
"That's obscene in reality of the world That's

00:38:09.910 --> 00:38:14.680
pretty bizarre, but what the hell. Money's
made to spend and also remember this, on that

00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:19.839
note." The economy, when all you hear about
is cut spending, cut spending, cut spending,

00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:26.269
I got news for you, people. If we don't spend,
there is no economy. The economy is based

00:38:26.269 --> 00:38:33.440
upon spending. Spending creates jobs. You
have to buy things; you have to have money

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:39.619
moving. If we all cut everything, now don't
get me wrong there, our government does and

00:38:39.619 --> 00:38:45.620
is in places it shouldn't be. But think of
that when you get brainwashed on cut spending,

00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:53.069
cut spending. The economy is based upon spending.
That's what makes it work. You buy things.

00:38:53.069 --> 00:38:58.999
The money, that's what creates jobs. Spending
creates jobs. Why do you think they always

00:38:58.999 --> 00:39:04.589
renew unemployment? That's because unemployment,
when you're on unemployment, you spend every

00:39:04.589 --> 00:39:11.619
cent of it. That spurs the economy and starts
to create jobs so then you're not on unemployment

00:39:11.619 --> 00:39:19.739
anymore. Think of it. How other way can there
be jobs if there's not money being spent?

00:39:19.739 --> 00:39:25.789
And besides, you can't take it with you, people.
That's what I always say. You come into the

00:39:25.789 --> 00:39:30.510
world naked, you leave with it naked. You
can't take a dollar with you. Spend the damn

00:39:30.510 --> 00:39:36.529
stuff. Enjoy it. You work hard for it. That's
the fruits of your labor. But then, make sure

00:39:36.529 --> 00:39:42.219
that your kids and things like that are taken
care of. But buy stuff. What the hell, you

00:39:42.219 --> 00:39:49.589
can't do nothing with that paper. Substitute
it in the bathroom, maybe. But other than

00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:53.549
that, you spend it. It's what spurs the economy.
Next question.

00:39:53.549 --> 00:39:57.779
&gt;&gt;Male audience 4: So what do you think the
government should do? What are the important

00:39:57.779 --> 00:40:00.481
things that the government does in our lives?
What shouldn't they do?

00:40:00.481 --> 00:40:05.400
&gt;&gt;Jesse: What should they do? Well, I'll put
it to you this way. Let's go to health care

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:11.450
for a minute. That's always a cantankerous,
but now they've labeled it Obama care. To

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:18.089
me, it's a human right. If you're sick, you
should be able to go to the doctor. If we

00:40:18.089 --> 00:40:22.170
weren't spending all our money on these wars,
we'd have more money. We could have health

00:40:22.170 --> 00:40:26.309
care three times over. You don't hear a word
about that. It's fine to spend money to kill

00:40:26.309 --> 00:40:32.950
people, but health care? Oh, my goodness.
And for these hypocrites in Washington, now

00:40:32.950 --> 00:40:39.109
I'm talking the Republicans who are blaming
Obama, Obama care, "oh, we're gonna repeal

00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:46.660
it." Well, why don't they start repealing
it by giving up their government-run health

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:55.131
care? The Senate and the Congress has government-run
health care. It's provided by the government

00:40:55.131 --> 00:41:01.209
for them. They want you not to have it, while
they go to the bank with it. You don't see

00:41:01.209 --> 00:41:07.940
any of them saying, "You know, I'm a stand-up
type person. I'm gonna give up my health care

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:13.930
being a Congressman and Senator for me and
my family to set an example." Do you hear

00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:19.910
that? Anybody know of one of them doing that?
Then what are they? They're hypocrites because

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:25.251
they're telling you, and then I'll flip it
a little farther. If government health care

00:41:25.251 --> 00:41:31.670
is so terrible, then are we screwing over
the military again? Because the military's

00:41:31.670 --> 00:41:37.489
had government-run health care since World
War I. So I guess we're sticking it to the

00:41:37.489 --> 00:41:42.089
military again, giving them a substandard
thing. But all I know is my dad would go nowhere

00:41:42.089 --> 00:41:49.650
else. I couldn't get him to a civilian place.
He went to the vet's hospital and there no

00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:54.190
changing at all. I will say, in Minnesota,
not all the vet's hospitals are good, but

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:59.240
in Minnesota; they have an outstanding veteran's
hospital. And you couldn't get my dad to go,

00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:07.539
he'd ride the bus all day long just to go
there and this and that. So, and what other

00:42:07.539 --> 00:42:13.209
thing? Well, infrastructure. Those are things
the government should be paying for, so that

00:42:13.209 --> 00:42:19.279
we can do our commerce. Fix our roads and
bridges. Let's do something constructive instead

00:42:19.279 --> 00:42:26.319
of destructive. Wars are destructive. Let's
get out of the wars and put our money to workforce,

00:42:26.319 --> 00:42:31.910
building up and making our country what it
ought to be. And those are just a couple.

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:40.390
I hope they helped a little, but you get where
I'm coming from. Next. I don't know what my,

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:46.199
hold on. Let me check my schedule so I can
make sure that. No, no, no, hold on. Let me,

00:42:46.199 --> 00:42:54.280
let me. I like to answer all questions. I
feel good doing that. Let's see. OK, my pick

00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:00.650
up was probably, I gotta go to Fox Sports,
which is over on Pico. How far, how many minutes?

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:03.279
It's LA, so you can't say miles; you gotta
say minutes.

00:43:03.279 --> 00:43:04.279
&gt;&gt;Unknown audience 3: [inaudible].

00:43:04.279 --> 00:43:05.279
&gt;&gt;Jesse: How long?

00:43:05.279 --> 00:43:06.279
&gt;&gt; Unknown audience 3: [inaudible].

00:43:06.279 --> 00:43:10.680
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Twenty minutes? OK, then. I should
be good then till probably about 2:30, I would

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.690
guess, or 2:50. What time is it now?

00:43:13.690 --> 00:43:15.369
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Ten of two.

00:43:15.369 --> 00:43:20.170
&gt;&gt;Jesse: OK, good. We got another 20 minutes
then, easy. Unless she's trying to get us

00:43:20.170 --> 00:43:21.190
out of here. I don't know.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:23.229
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I wanna make sure we have
time to sign books.

00:43:23.229 --> 00:43:26.809
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Oh, yeah. That's right, too. OK,
I forgot about that, so we'll take a couple

00:43:26.809 --> 00:43:29.161
more questions and, next question.

00:43:29.161 --> 00:43:33.519
&gt;&gt;Male audience 5: So, staying on the same
theme of government and what it should do,

00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:41.010
your Patrick Henry quote, what kind of openness
do you have a hope for in government? And

00:43:41.010 --> 00:43:42.010
[inaudible] when?

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.859
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Well, I would hope, certainly, I
understand that certain things have to become

00:43:44.859 --> 00:43:52.029
secret when they're timely. As a Navy Seal,
I don't want them opening up and saying what

00:43:52.029 --> 00:43:58.559
operation I'm going on where the enemy can
set up and do me in. But when the Op's over

00:43:58.559 --> 00:44:05.400
and maybe a year's gone by, then bring it
all above board. Let's get a little time element

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:11.279
and they could figure out a way to make things
time sensitive. And if they're not doing anything

00:44:11.279 --> 00:44:17.529
illegal, dirty, murder and that, why would
they fear? Bring it above board to us so that

00:44:17.529 --> 00:44:20.779
we can know. We have a right to know. We pay
taxes. Yes, sir?

00:44:20.779 --> 00:44:22.019
&gt;&gt;Male audience 5: Outside of defense operations,
maybe.

00:44:22.019 --> 00:44:23.019
&gt;&gt;Jesse: What's that?

00:44:23.019 --> 00:44:24.260
&gt;&gt;Male audience 5: Outside of defense operations.

00:44:24.260 --> 00:44:30.989
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Oh, then they should bring everything
forward. Why would you cover up anything?

00:44:30.989 --> 00:44:35.999
I don't understand why you'd have to cover
up anything. If everything you're doing is,

00:44:35.999 --> 00:44:41.420
and you believe in it, is good, there's no
reason to keep it secret. In fact, if it's

00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:52.309
successful you'd want it out there. You can
brag, then. So, to me, only marginal things

00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:56.529
that would be that you would keep secret.
But everything else, cause we have a right

00:44:56.529 --> 00:45:00.690
to know. It's all done with our tax dollars,
people. You have every right to know what

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:05.759
they're being spent on. And that way you can
be a good voter and know that the people you're

00:45:05.759 --> 00:45:11.089
electing, if you disagree, you can remove
them, or attempt to anyway. Next question.

00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:23.059
&gt;&gt;Male audience 6: So I also believed in Obama
with the change and what I think we're witnessing

00:45:23.059 --> 00:45:28.819
now is him completely squashed by the two
party system, or the Republicans in this case.

00:45:28.819 --> 00:45:34.009
And you brought up the exciting and worthwhile
idea of getting rid of the two parties. I

00:45:34.009 --> 00:45:38.709
can't see how that could even be possible
in today's world and it's something I'd love

00:45:38.709 --> 00:45:43.660
to see. And it's something that's necessary.
I don't know, I mean, we all bought into the

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:48.900
belief of change and then saw him completely
stymied by that ability.

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:49.900
&gt;&gt;Jesse: OK.

00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:53.479
&gt;&gt;Male audience 8: Our forefathers created
this country with the concept of the right

00:45:53.479 --> 00:45:59.390
to bear arms, is actually the right to, if
a government become corrupt in and of itself,

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:05.950
we have a right to stand up and say no. That's
radical. But how can you see us get through

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:11.849
this two party system and really be able to
make a difference without the same thing happening

00:46:11.849 --> 00:46:12.849
again?

00:46:12.849 --> 00:46:15.739
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Let me tell you, I disagree. I don't
think itâ€™s the parties that are stopping

00:46:15.739 --> 00:46:22.949
Obama. Always remember, he who has the money
calls the shots and the US government has

00:46:22.949 --> 00:46:28.349
no money. Where do they get their money? The
Federal Reserve, which is a small little group

00:46:28.349 --> 00:46:34.099
of bankers in the private sector. You know
what I think they did to Barack Obama? I think

00:46:34.099 --> 00:46:39.239
he got in office and then they showed him
the Zapruder film and they said, "See what

00:46:39.239 --> 00:46:46.150
we can do? You sure? Do you wanna fulfill
all those promises you talked about?" Because

00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:52.079
to me it clearly shows that President may
only be a figurehead and that there's people

00:46:52.079 --> 00:46:57.039
behind the scenes that we don't even elect
who are truly calling the shots. That's the

00:46:57.039 --> 00:47:03.030
only reasoning I can give to it, because as
governor, I was pretty powerful and no one

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:09.930
could influence me and I held true on most
of my campaign speeches and what I promised.

00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:15.400
But it seems to me that how could he not be
doing anything that he campaigned on and why

00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:21.390
all this massive compromise to accommodate
quote "the Republicans?" So I think that it

00:47:21.390 --> 00:47:26.469
goes beyond the parties when it comes to who's
running the operation. That's just my opinion.

00:47:26.469 --> 00:47:27.469
Next question.

00:47:27.469 --> 00:47:29.510
&gt;&gt;Male audience 9: How can we get past it?

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:30.579
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Huh?

00:47:30.579 --> 00:47:32.729
&gt;&gt;Male audience 9: [inaudible]

00:47:32.729 --> 00:47:37.890
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Well, like I said, stop electing
them. That would be a good start because I

00:47:37.890 --> 00:47:42.930
only raised 300 thousand dollars, people,
to become governor. I made more money at the

00:47:42.930 --> 00:47:53.029
job than I spent to get it. But then again,
I didn't need name recognition. Everybody

00:47:53.029 --> 00:47:58.500
in Minnesota knew who I am. I'll brag. I'm
one of four people in Minnesota where all

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:07.519
you have to do is say the first name and they
know who you are. There's Jesse, there's Prince,

00:48:07.519 --> 00:48:14.749
there's Dylan, and there's, I forget. What's
the other one? And Sid. We have a columnist

00:48:14.749 --> 00:48:20.039
named Sid Hartman, who's been writing for
like, 70 years, a sports column. And we're

00:48:20.039 --> 00:48:24.849
the four people that all they have to is say
our first name and everybody knows who they

00:48:24.849 --> 00:48:29.329
are. And I was written by a writer and I was
pretty proud of that to be in that type of

00:48:29.329 --> 00:48:30.329
company. Yes, sir?

00:48:30.329 --> 00:48:34.140
&gt;&gt;Male audience 10: [inaudible]

00:48:34.140 --> 00:48:38.180
&gt;&gt;Jesse: I don't know. I'm just saying that's
my theory.

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:47.119
&gt;&gt;Male audience 10: So, hypothetically, if
they exist, then you wipe out the two parties.

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:48.210
What will stop that [inaudible]?

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:53.200
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Well, if you don't take the dirty
money, if you don't take the corporate money

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:58.869
like I didn't. I accepted no PAC money. The
only thing that I accepted were 50 and hundred

00:48:58.869 --> 00:49:04.539
dollar donations from individuals and believe
me, in a job like that, a hundred bucks ain't

00:49:04.539 --> 00:49:09.539
gonna buy you much influence. If you gave
me a hundred dollars and come back to me later

00:49:09.539 --> 00:49:15.319
and say, "You know I gave you a hundred bucks."
I say, "So what?" That's not enough money

00:49:15.319 --> 00:49:22.499
to buy the influence with me. And I can also
tell you, since I didn't take from one lobbyist

00:49:22.499 --> 00:49:28.269
money, when I got into office I didn't even
see a lobbyist. I banned them. I told my staff,

00:49:28.269 --> 00:49:33.199
"Tell all the lobbyists to go get new jobs."
Cause I said, "They're not getting in my door."

00:49:33.199 --> 00:49:39.212
Why do you think they wanted me gone, outta
there? I got my own ideas. I don't need a

00:49:39.212 --> 00:49:43.980
lobbyist to try to convince me what's right
and wrong. Now granted, I do use other people

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:47.640
and consult them. Certainly I don't know about
everything but I had a great commissioner,

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:49.670
too. Anyway, next question.

00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:54.739
&gt;&gt;Male audience 11: Can you say something
about what effect you think the JFK assassination

00:49:54.739 --> 00:50:01.630
had on this country? And specifically say
something about the Reagan Administration.

00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:06.829
&gt;&gt;Jesse: The Reagan Administration? I think
the effect of JFK's assassination was simply,

00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:12.999
really simple. If you can kill the President
and get away with it, what can't you do? What

00:50:12.999 --> 00:50:20.069
can't you do? And like I said, we had a confession
on my TV show. Did I talk about that? Yeah.

00:50:20.069 --> 00:50:23.410
My showed his fault. We had a confession to
the murder of John Kennedy and yet, there

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:28.609
wasn't one word in the mainstream media. E.
Howard Hunt from Watergate confessed to his

00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:33.890
son, Saint John Hunt, on his deathbed. He
said the CIA did, and it wasn't a confession

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:39.900
of remorse, it was a confession of pride.
That's what was scary about it. It was a CIA

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:43.039
operation. It was called "The Big Event" and
I suppose if you're killing the President,

00:50:43.039 --> 00:50:47.519
it is a big event. You wouldn't call it "The
Small Event." And he named the people: William

00:50:47.519 --> 00:50:51.549
Harvey, who at that time headed the CIA's
assassination, teams when they were trying

00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:58.160
to kill Castro, and a guy named David Sanchez
Morales and he was one of their main operatives

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:05.209
on the ground. And he's also famous for, four
years later, he was in Bolivia when they put

00:51:05.209 --> 00:51:11.029
Che Guevara up against a wall and shot and
killed him. Morales was there and allegedly

00:51:11.029 --> 00:51:20.619
took Che's Rolex watch and he wore it as a
trophy. And I believe what Howard Hunt said.

00:51:20.619 --> 00:51:27.740
He would have no reason to lie. He did it
to his son's, and Saint John, his son, how

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:32.099
many of you remember the Three Tramps in Dealey
Plaza? They had these photos of three bums,

00:51:32.099 --> 00:51:36.499
the tramps? Well, if you look close at the
old tramp, if that's not E. Howard Hunt then

00:51:36.499 --> 00:51:41.680
he has a double. Cause even his son looked
at that photo and said, "Yes, I believe that's

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:51.170
my father." So, and who else for an eyewitness
is better than a son? I mean, come on. Think

00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:56.160
of your father. You think you could recognize
him if you saw him in a photo? I think I could

00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:02.180
recognize mine, father. Find a last question
and then we'll sign some books.

00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:06.069
&gt;&gt;Male audience 11: I'd be interested if you
said something about American history.

00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:07.539
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Oh, wait a minute. You wanted to
know about Reagan.

00:52:07.539 --> 00:52:13.190
&gt;&gt; Male audience 11: Well, just American history
since JFK and how we got to where we are and

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:16.759
whether you think that the Reagan Administration
had anything to do with it.

00:52:16.759 --> 00:52:21.769
&gt;&gt;Jesse: When they took out Jack Kennedy,
then they removed our leader without a vote.

00:52:21.769 --> 00:52:32.450
They removed him with a bullet and from that
point on, who knows? But like I said, I think

00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:37.609
there's a higher authority that's commanding
our government. And it's the old thing: follow

00:52:37.609 --> 00:52:43.250
the money. He who's got the money has the
power and the best I can tell, that's the

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:50.029
Federal Reserve. They can't, Ron Paul asked
for an audit. We can't even audit these people

00:52:50.029 --> 00:52:55.569
and their done illegally. Did you know that?
It came in at like, 1913, and our Constitution

00:52:55.569 --> 00:53:00.099
said that there could be nobody that could
borrow the country money and charge interest.

00:53:00.099 --> 00:53:06.430
They charge us interest. These people print
the money and give it to the US government

00:53:06.430 --> 00:53:12.859
and then charge us interest on the money.
They're our lending institution. They're the

00:53:12.859 --> 00:53:18.720
bank to the US government and the Constitution,
that's against the Constitution and they never,

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:24.019
it was never ratified because if you're going
to change the Constitution it requires two-

00:53:24.019 --> 00:53:31.039
thirds of the states to ratify it on a vote.
It was never done. It was never done. And

00:53:31.039 --> 00:53:38.119
now it's too late; they're entrenched. We
got the Federal Reserve now. And just so you

00:53:38.119 --> 00:53:44.150
know, another example, quickly, of why it
doesn't matter electing a Democrat or a Republican

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:49.220
for, I think, itâ€™s the last 40-, 50- some
years, we've had Democrat and Republican presidents

00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:55.901
back and forth, yet every Secretary of the
Treasury, regardless of Democrat or Republican,

00:53:55.901 --> 00:54:02.720
has come out of Goldman Sachs. None of the
other ones, nobody qualified in any of the

00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:09.430
other ones to be Treasury secretary, just
Goldman Sachs. So again, it doesn't matter

00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:15.259
if you're Democrat or Republican; your Treasury
secretary comes out of Goldman Sachs, or seems

00:54:15.259 --> 00:54:21.039
to anyway. Any final questions? Wow, you guys
are good. You haven't asked me no stuff about

00:54:21.039 --> 00:54:22.420
wrestling or--

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:23.420
[laughter]

00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:27.339
I usually always get a question. Maybe you
got one for me. What about wrestling?

00:54:27.339 --> 00:54:29.720
&gt;&gt;Male audience 12: Sorry, not about wrestling.

00:54:29.720 --> 00:54:30.720
&gt;&gt;Jesse: OK.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:35.239
&gt;&gt;audience 13: It's hard enough to imagine
one person having the integrity to effect

00:54:35.239 --> 00:54:39.769
changes, but the government is not just one
person. While your governor, you have secretaries

00:54:39.769 --> 00:54:46.779
and there's a huge bureaucracy underneath
you and is one person, one right person, at

00:54:46.779 --> 00:54:52.829
the top really sufficient to change things,
or do you have any plans or any ideas how

00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:58.009
that one person can bring changes to find
more right person?

00:54:58.009 --> 00:55:04.009
&gt;&gt;Jesse: Yeah, you're absolutely correct.
You can't make major changes 'cause the bureaucracy's

00:55:04.009 --> 00:55:09.049
so big. You usually can't. You can simply
nudge it over a little and get it going in

00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:15.719
the right direction, hopefully. But we're
talking here revolution by not electing Democrats

00:55:15.719 --> 00:55:21.420
and Republicans and making wholesale change.
That's revolution and if that happens then

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:26.830
wholesale changes can happen, but right now,
which is simply all Democrats and Republicans,

00:55:26.830 --> 00:55:32.109
you're exactly correct. You might get minute,
little changes but nothing of any significance.

00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:38.390
We've gotta cleanse ourselves of these two
parties before you do anything. And if that

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:43.929
doesn't happen, I agree. There won't be great
changes at all. There'll be just small ones.

00:55:43.929 --> 00:55:46.799
Thank you very much and I'll sign some books
if you want me to.

00:55:46.799 --> 00:55:46.929
[applause]
