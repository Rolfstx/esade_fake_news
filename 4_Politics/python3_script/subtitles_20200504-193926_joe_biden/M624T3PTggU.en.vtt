00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 align:start position:0%
now this is a completely fine square and
 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.540 align:start position:0%
now this is a completely fine square and

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 align:start position:0%
from here burn decides to bring his rook
 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.510 align:start position:0%
from here burn decides to bring his rook
to<00:04:59.790><c> d1</c><00:04:59.820><c> you</c><00:05:00.450><c> always</c><00:05:00.690><c> want</c><00:05:00.960><c> to</c><00:05:01.100><c> put</c><00:05:02.100><c> your</c><00:05:02.250><c> rooks</c>

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
to d1 you always want to put your rooks
 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.430 align:start position:0%
to d1 you always want to put your rooks
behind<00:05:03.000><c> pawns</c><00:05:03.330><c> as</c><00:05:03.540><c> they</c><00:05:03.660><c> push</c><00:05:03.900><c> up</c><00:05:04.080><c> the</c><00:05:04.200><c> board</c>

behind pawns as they push up the board
 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.900 align:start position:0%
behind pawns as they push up the board
and<00:05:04.590><c> so</c><00:05:04.680><c> this</c><00:05:04.830><c> is</c><00:05:04.950><c> a</c><00:05:04.980><c> logical</c><00:05:05.460><c> move</c><00:05:05.550><c> to</c><00:05:05.730><c> bring</c>

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 align:start position:0%
and so this is a logical move to bring
 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.090 align:start position:0%
and so this is a logical move to bring

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 align:start position:0%

this case Bobby Fischer knew two things
 

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.750 align:start position:0%
this case Bobby Fischer knew two things
he<00:08:45.690><c> knew</c><00:08:45.810><c> that</c><00:08:45.990><c> the</c><00:08:46.140><c> king</c><00:08:46.440><c> was</c><00:08:46.710><c> not</c><00:08:46.950><c> safe</c><00:08:47.310><c> and</c>

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
he knew that the king was not safe and
 

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
he knew that the king was not safe and
at<00:08:47.850><c> the</c><00:08:47.970><c> same</c><00:08:48.150><c> time</c><00:08:48.480><c> he</c><00:08:49.050><c> knew</c><00:08:49.170><c> that</c><00:08:49.320><c> this</c><00:08:49.470><c> pawn</c>

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:49.770 align:start position:0%
at the same time he knew that this pawn
 

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.790 align:start position:0%
at the same time he knew that this pawn
on<00:08:49.950><c> e4</c><00:08:50.490><c> was</c><00:08:51.330><c> very</c><00:08:51.720><c> very</c><00:08:51.960><c> weak</c><00:08:52.290><c> if</c><00:08:52.530><c> he</c><00:08:52.650><c> could</c>

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
on e4 was very very weak if he could
 

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.190 align:start position:0%
on e4 was very very weak if he could
take<00:08:53.010><c> this</c><00:08:53.190><c> pawn</c><00:08:53.550><c> out</c><00:08:53.820><c> then</c><00:08:54.330><c> he</c><00:08:54.780><c> could</c><00:08:54.930><c> really</c>

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
take this pawn out then he could really
 

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.260 align:start position:0%
take this pawn out then he could really
have<00:08:55.470><c> a</c><00:08:55.500><c> strong</c><00:08:55.830><c> attack</c><00:08:56.250><c> on</c><00:08:56.430><c> the</c><00:08:56.700><c> kingside</c>

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:57.270 align:start position:0%
have a strong attack on the kingside
 

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.540 align:start position:0%
have a strong attack on the kingside
because<00:08:57.810><c> the</c><00:08:57.960><c> King</c><00:08:58.230><c> right</c><00:08:58.440><c> now</c><00:08:58.620><c> is</c><00:08:58.890><c> not</c><00:08:59.190><c> safe</c>

00:08:59.540 --> 00:08:59.550 align:start position:0%
because the King right now is not safe
 

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.090 align:start position:0%
because the King right now is not safe
so<00:08:59.820><c> what</c><00:09:00.240><c> he</c><00:09:00.330><c> noticed</c><00:09:00.540><c> is</c><00:09:00.930><c> the</c><00:09:01.290><c> defender</c><00:09:01.860><c> of</c>

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:02.100 align:start position:0%
so what he noticed is the defender of
 

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:06.140 align:start position:0%
so what he noticed is the defender of
this<00:09:02.760><c> pawn</c><00:09:03.090><c> on</c><00:09:03.360><c> e4</c><00:09:03.840><c> is</c><00:09:04.110><c> this</c><00:09:04.980><c> night</c><00:09:05.370><c> here</c><00:09:05.670><c> on</c><00:09:05.700><c> c3</c>

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.150 align:start position:0%
this pawn on e4 is this night here on c3
 

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.930 align:start position:0%
this pawn on e4 is this night here on c3
so<00:09:06.660><c> he</c><00:09:06.900><c> is</c><00:09:07.050><c> coming</c><00:09:07.530><c> down</c><00:09:07.680><c> here</c><00:09:08.070><c> and</c><00:09:08.220><c> it</c><00:09:08.670><c> looks</c>

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
so he is coming down here and it looks
 

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.350 align:start position:0%
so he is coming down here and it looks
like<00:09:09.030><c> he</c><00:09:09.330><c> is</c><00:09:09.360><c> sacrificing</c><00:09:09.690><c> his</c><00:09:10.350><c> knight</c><00:09:10.590><c> on</c><00:09:10.830><c> a4</c>

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:11.360 align:start position:0%
like he is sacrificing his knight on a4
 

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:15.110 align:start position:0%
like he is sacrificing his knight on a4
so<00:09:12.360><c> that</c><00:09:12.510><c> he</c><00:09:12.630><c> can</c><00:09:12.810><c> gobble</c><00:09:13.200><c> up</c><00:09:13.350><c> this</c><00:09:13.560><c> pawn</c><00:09:13.860><c> on</c><00:09:14.190><c> e4</c>

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
so that he can gobble up this pawn on e4
 

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.510 align:start position:0%
so that he can gobble up this pawn on e4
now<00:09:15.630><c> keep</c><00:09:15.900><c> in</c><00:09:16.080><c> mind</c><00:09:16.110><c> here</c><00:09:16.590><c> white</c><00:09:16.950><c> is</c><00:09:17.130><c> not</c><00:09:17.310><c> able</c>

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:17.520 align:start position:0%

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
at this pawn structure for white it's
 

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.660 align:start position:0%
at this pawn structure for white it's
just<00:10:18.750><c> not</c><00:10:18.930><c> very</c><00:10:19.110><c> good</c><00:10:19.230><c> and</c><00:10:20.160><c> as</c><00:10:20.250><c> you</c><00:10:20.340><c> can</c><00:10:20.430><c> see</c>

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:20.670 align:start position:0%
just not very good and as you can see
 

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
just not very good and as you can see
for<00:10:20.880><c> Bobby</c><00:10:21.060><c> Fischer</c><00:10:21.630><c> he</c><00:10:22.080><c> has</c><00:10:22.260><c> great</c><00:10:22.650><c> pawn</c>

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:22.890 align:start position:0%
for Bobby Fischer he has great pawn
 

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.440 align:start position:0%
for Bobby Fischer he has great pawn

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:24.450 align:start position:0%
structure and everything's pretty much
 

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
structure and everything's pretty much
coordinating<00:10:25.110><c> together</c><00:10:25.350><c> and</c><00:10:25.830><c> at</c><00:10:25.920><c> the</c><00:10:26.040><c> same</c>

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:26.250 align:start position:0%

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.060 align:start position:0%
coordinating together and at the same
time<00:10:26.550><c> you</c><00:10:27.240><c> know</c><00:10:27.360><c> the</c><00:10:27.780><c> King</c><00:10:28.050><c> from</c><00:10:28.260><c> white</c><00:10:28.830><c> is</c>

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:29.070 align:start position:0%
time you know the King from white is
 

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.770 align:start position:0%

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:30.780 align:start position:0%
still anyone and it's still unprotected
 

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.450 align:start position:0%
