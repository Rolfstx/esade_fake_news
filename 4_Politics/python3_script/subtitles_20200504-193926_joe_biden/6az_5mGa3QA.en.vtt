00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.970
 Thank you very much and I appreciate that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.830
 Still in the group before I was 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.769
 Disappointed that the cardinals are not 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.820
 Today playing for some reason I thought 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.890
 How were everyone today thanks 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.660
 So much for this great article 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.080
 Call you are really blessed to be 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.720
 Here and it's always an honor 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.900
 I am honored to share what God is doing in me 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 A person's life and in the ministry as well 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.710
 We have a life story of how how the Lord has 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.899
 Work all the time today I am more 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.600
 Good luck to share with you about my country 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.899
 People about people to grow up 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.030
 Be a part of you, I former Muslim 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.370
 I was born and raised in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.579
 The country that is probably the most closed 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.559
 For the gospel in the world there 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.690
 Too many risks for people to go and share 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.930
 There are a lot of risks for people from 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.850
 Within to ask and inquire and 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.150
 The government is always watching over 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.640
 Anything or any departure activities 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.520
 People know more about Christ or 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.760
 Even in for an outside project 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.610
 The world of Islam so I as I share with you 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.430
 Today I want you to always be mindful 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.729
 Them and pray for them and ask 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.400
 The Lord to keep Rukin to soften 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.430
 The hearts of those who are in it 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.340
 A certain group as you know there are about 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.130
 1.5 billion Muslims in the world we are 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.060
 We talk about 25 percent of the world 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.640
 Population 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.630
 Out of one of literally four in the world 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:46.380
 Belongs to Islam is the second fastest 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:50.450
 Religions are prevalent in the world today even 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.460
 Here in our own country and many times 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.030
 We ask a lot of questions about 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.030
 The doctrine of Islam, and often our questions 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.030
 And out of fear more than out 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.079
 The desire to communicate with them and for 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.570
 Right reasons 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.170
 September 11 I think opened up to us 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:13.830
 Eyes on reality regarding what Islam is 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.740
 Really knows how devout those are 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.750
 Followers are ready to go and you are 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.580
 One of those at some point in my life 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.040
 Even you are ready to go and fight and 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.310
 Die for the sake of Allah this is a type of religion 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:31.080
 We deal with I lived most of my life 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.120
 Home life again in the first memorize the Saudi 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.040
 The book called Half of the Quran from it in 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.830
 Under 12 and my goal was to 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.840
 Save the whole and why I am 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.120
 I did this because Islam is a religion 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.980
 It works and every single thing you can do to 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.620
 Please this deity who you are following 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.710
 It will add more good business that you have been 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:55.350
 The need on the Day of Resurrection to help you earn 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:57.840
 Your way to paradise but also a Muslim 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.300
 And brought up to believe certain things 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.610
 Which I like to call a psychic 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.390
 The religion you brought up for 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:10.140
 We believe that Islam is the ultimate religion 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.020
 Religion is acceptable only to God 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.330
 Way if you wish if you don't 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.450
 Followers of this religion and therefore you 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.900
 No hope at all to make it 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.300
 Heaven or even to heaven as womb 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.530
 He knows that the Messenger of Islam 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.700
 Final Messenger and even Prophet 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.519
 Although there are prophets from 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.640
 Before him including Jesus by the way 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.760
 The Quran calls him to the Prophet of each one 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.730
 Those prophets at some point in 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.130
 The history of mankind was sent by God to 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.250
 A specific group of people to share 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.970
 A specific message but when it comes to 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.220
 Islam only 14 centuries ago 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.660
 A global message that is now sent 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.070
 For all mankind, as well as teaches Islam 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.500
 This book in the Qur'an is final 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.010
 Revelation from God from other books that 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.489
 Before that came either lost or 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.670
 Damaged as in the Bible 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:18.060
 With this kind of thinking I grew up as 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.220
 A Muslim locked into this false feeling 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.390
 In fact, you are part of the elite 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.450
 The group chose the nation if you wish or 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:31.470
 People that God 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:34.170
 You decided to be just now 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:39.240
 An acceptable group of people in his country 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:41.160
 When I was growing up thinking about the kingdom 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.140
 About all these things that are implanted 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.600
 Something inside me which for 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:49.170
 Look down on others who don't follow 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.960
 That religion was in fact so pious 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.870
 Postulate that you start so look down at 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.960
 Your people who follow Islam however 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:00.900
 They are not that religious because it is 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.420
 Each has to do with being religious pious 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:06.240
 Doing your deeds is going on in full 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.130
 Present to this deity that demands 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.090
 Everything from you but never ever 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:15.630
 Nothing will guarantee you even 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.550
 Hope one of your salvation even 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:21.090
 If you go as far as you are willing to 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:22.980
 Death for him, and this is actually what I am 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.980
 Wanted to do at some point of investigation 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.620
 That is how only my sins will be 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:30.840
 Forgive and I have hope to make 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.030
 All the way to heaven that I am if 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:36.690
 You will be ready to fight and die for 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.360
 This god and in 1979 the Soviets invaded 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.250
 Afghanistan and many left Muslim men 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.110
 Their countries are gone and they are there 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.420
 To fight and I wanted to go and do 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.460
 Same, and I really just didn't want to go 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.800
 Fight and earn your deeds I wanted to go 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:54.210
 And fight and death knowing that this is 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:58.170
 My hope is to earn that salvation after my own 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.570
 Mother God used her to step in and step in 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:03.420
 Stop me from doing this and call me 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:07.170
 This is my Amar Cole number one on my way 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.120
 A journey to see the Lord a couple 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:11.850
 Years later I finished school I went 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.920
 To the Islamic University of Mecca and that 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:16.650
 By the way it was about 45 minutes 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:19.260
 From where I lived I went there and me 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.330
 He started studying Sharia and was my hope for 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.790
 It became a world of Sharia and perhaps 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.470
 Even the judge on the road but I Sunnah 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.770
 Half later and I do not know what happened 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:31.620
 But what the Lord just turned my country 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.270
 Turn the field over this idea and that would 

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:34.380
 They were out of a two-mark mark in my country 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.240
 Flight because if you could 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.770
 Keep going this way I'm not that 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:40.860
 Make sure that I will be standing here today 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:44.530
 But only God knows 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:47.650
 Essentially that track is finished 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:50.410
 I decided to now follow a different I path 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.940
 He moved back home and attended my local 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:54.190
 University earned me engineering 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.440
 Degree, when my dad graduated 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:59.680
 It really struck me and asked me if I was 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.930
 I would go to the West either 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.510
 Europe or to the United States and obtain graduate studies 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:06.610
 Certificate from there in engineering now for 

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:10.000
 As we know Muslim and and that is 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.440
 It applies to the majority of Muslims to return live 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.500
 House in the Middle East or in their country 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.260
 Countries, but what we tend to think of 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:19.390
 West as a corrupted society we are to blame 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.960
 West for anything and any over all 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:26.680
 Our problems that we are to blame 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:29.200
 Them for being the enemies that are 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.930
 Usually conspiracy against us 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.820
 We believe their community 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.290
 It was damaged because it was their holy book 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.970
 Damaged believe that all of them 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.980
 Christianity was born but not all of them 

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:41.410
 Is that Christian believers anymore, and 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.910
 Even if they wanted to be loyal there 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:44.440
 And any moral values ​​were left there 

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:48.220
 Because their book is so damaged 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:49.960
 With all this I was still excited 

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:53.200
 When my father gave me to go to 

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:55.900
 West I would consider that a little bit of 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:59.110
 Actually hypocrisy why would I go 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.600
 Somewhere I despise, and I wanted to 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:03.640
 Go and earn that degree and be that 

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:06.010
 Prestige saying that I have 

00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:10.510
 Graduate degree from this university or 

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:13.229
 I definitely did not refuse it 

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:15.760
 Idea and I followed it, and I finally 

00:08:13.229 --> 00:08:18.460
 With permission from 

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.040
 Embassy of the application did that, first 

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:25.050
 The university that sent me the acceptance letter 

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.050
 U had a letter 

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:33.919
 Hold your horses I just want to 

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.669
 I apologize because I did not know any 

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.669
 Better at that time 

00:08:41.469 --> 00:08:47.959
 So I made it foundation and I was even 

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.790
 Everyone was excited to tell me that 

00:08:47.959 --> 00:08:51.260
 You were going to eat the desert environment 

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:52.970
 I am thinking it is similar to where I am 

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:58.730
 I slept until I arrived 

00:08:52.970 --> 00:09:01.100
 Quite different then you've more 

00:08:58.730 --> 00:09:04.310
 I have been studying English most of my life 

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:06.800
 And the only thing that was worried 

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:10.339
 About when I decided to go to the West 

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.980
 It was a cultural shock that you see many 

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:16.100
 My friends back home who are very much 

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.660
 Religious like me usually 

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.940
 It will have a beard and we would go for 

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.709
 The mosque all the time and we were 

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.649
 Do all these religious rituals 

00:09:21.709 --> 00:09:26.269
 My turn and many of them will 

00:09:24.649 --> 00:09:28.730
 Sometimes left during summer only 

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:30.950
 For vacation and it will come 

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:34.070
 Back with a ponytail and not a beard anymore 

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:37.130
 I would like to ask what happened and 

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:39.019
 Of course you see how powerful an impact is 

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:42.290
 It was a culture and I was concerned 

00:09:39.019 --> 00:09:44.300
 About that but I probably convinced myself 

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.790
 I can make my trip important to 

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:49.940
 Converting people to Islam was that 

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:51.680
 Really my true motive is never that I have 

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:55.940
 English thought is going to be 

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:59.750
 The problem until someone asked me what's the matter 

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:02.060
 And it seemed I didn't really know 

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:05.270
 What was even 

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:07.220
 Then people ask me what 

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:11.090
 Being and also saying I do not know 

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.590
 What is actually going on people want 

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:17.090
 Pull my legs and others wanted to pick me up 

00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:18.620
 The brain goes without saying that it was 

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:21.140
 Become very uncomfortable to 

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.480
 These hadiths I would like to understand 

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.780
 50-70 percent and then the rest 

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:29.000
 Somewhere I lost my ups and downs gone 

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:31.160
 Back to my teacher I told her I thought 

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.830
 I was ready to start but I don't think I am 

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.930
 I am and she was laughing when I explained 

00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:37.790
 Its why she said this is called 

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:41.060
 English conversation is fine for you 

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:42.980
 You must be ready to build 

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.720
 Relationships with American students and 

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:47.180
 American families and your neighbors 

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.510
 Listen to how they say phrases and ask 

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:53.240
 Questions and over time you'll be able 

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:55.490
 Master this but if you really want 

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:57.410
 I expanded it she said we have to 

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:58.790
 The organization right here on campus is called 

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.070
 International friends 

00:10:58.790 --> 00:11:03.110
 You can subscribe with them that they will end 

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.420
 Me realizing you with either 

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:08.089
 An individual or family that would work 

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:10.670
 With you to improve it's your language 

00:11:08.089 --> 00:11:14.450
 Leaving just a small part of it was 

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:17.450
 The Christian Ministry is gone and I signed 

00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:20.060
 Up and in a few weeks I 

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.620
 Received a letter entered into the family 

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.330
 That would be in contact with me and then 

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.920
 Within a few days of reception 

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.930
 A letter called the family to me and 

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.520
 The husband made the same for me, and we 

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:31.820
 I decided to first meet up 

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.040
 Up to this point I am of mindset 

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.560
 That every person I've met so far is 

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.780
 Christianity and it really does look like 

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:41.030
 Ie differs from that which was 

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:43.490
 Watch movies for example or TV 

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:46.280
 So I met this family and something 

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:49.339
 That was special about them 

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.260
 Their different lifestyle was different 

00:11:49.339 --> 00:11:54.050
 Their attitude was different than their love 

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:56.660
 Kindness was different and I can 

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:59.870
 I say they have this real heart 

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.880
 Want to help me and do whatever 

00:11:59.870 --> 00:12:03.650
 It takes me to remember when I was 

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.750
 He graduated from English School to 

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:08.060
 Starting my program it took a while 

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:11.150
 To take off on Friday and come 

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.980
 Surprise me for my ceremony 

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.920
 Basically and that really touched my country 

00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:18.889
 Heart but nevertheless I am 

00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.720
 I did not want to give in to any religious 

00:12:18.889 --> 00:12:22.790
 Discussions with them despite my desire 

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:24.199
 It was to be converted to Islam, but it felt 

00:12:22.790 --> 00:12:26.540
 As if I'm not ready yet 

00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:30.019
 To get to that discussion I'm still 

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:32.209
 Learn to speak one way or another 

00:12:30.019 --> 00:12:34.429
 Seven eight months after this 

00:12:32.209 --> 00:12:36.350
 The relationship I decided to change 

00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:38.209
 The principal went and applied at the other 

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:42.679
 Universities are long and behold 

00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:44.839
 The Sue that kissed me at the time I was 

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.619
 You can call me devil safe if you like me 

00:12:44.839 --> 00:12:49.309
 Okay with that 

00:12:45.619 --> 00:12:51.439
 I moved came here and I finished 

00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:53.689
 Degree while doing this 

00:12:51.439 --> 00:12:56.959
 About three years ago I started to learn more about 

00:12:53.689 --> 00:13:00.499
 The culture of religion itself 

00:12:56.959 --> 00:13:03.529
 Freedom of religion is many of the people you know 

00:13:00.499 --> 00:13:05.209
 Do not call themselves Christians I met 

00:13:03.529 --> 00:13:08.089
 People who don't even want to talk about it 

00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:09.769
 God and I mean I met others that they are 

00:13:08.089 --> 00:13:11.869
 To say that I only go to the church 

00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:14.059
 My turn or here on this occasion or 

00:13:11.869 --> 00:13:17.869
 This occasion and all this opened up to me 

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:19.970
 Mind and my heart to reality no 

00:13:17.869 --> 00:13:22.850
 Everything I learned about Christianity 

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:24.529
 The back home was true and true 

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.600
 This is not all true birth 

00:13:24.529 --> 00:13:29.239
 A Christian or a hereditary Religion and I 

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.790
 It was said to kind of bother me however 

00:13:29.239 --> 00:13:33.619
 I am still convinced Islam is the truth 

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.350
 But maybe issuing Islam that I have 

00:13:33.619 --> 00:13:40.610
 She learned was a little twisted in her report 

00:13:36.350 --> 00:13:43.730
 Teaching and I kept those for myself 

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:48.019
 A few years after graduation I met 

00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:50.869
 Another young man at work was 

00:13:48.019 --> 00:13:53.029
 Believer in Christ and he reminded me 

00:13:50.869 --> 00:13:55.309
 Immediately from that first family that 

00:13:53.029 --> 00:13:57.079
 Years ago I met when by the way 

00:13:55.309 --> 00:13:58.879
 I left I suffered my relationship with 

00:13:57.079 --> 00:14:02.029
 To them I did not bother to call him or 

00:13:58.879 --> 00:14:04.160
 So update my contacts with them and me 

00:14:02.029 --> 00:14:07.279
 Now encouraged because I had 

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:09.350
 Able to speak better to open 

00:14:07.279 --> 00:14:13.220
 Dialogue with him and his wife and 

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:15.019
 Family and through this relationship 

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.419
 That we built over the course of 

00:14:15.019 --> 00:14:20.989
 A few years I started to share with 

00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:23.179
 Peace be upon him, thinking that maybe I am 

00:14:20.989 --> 00:14:25.459
 It will surprise him with the information 

00:14:23.179 --> 00:14:27.889
 That I'd be sharing with him that 

00:14:25.459 --> 00:14:29.720
 The Bible is corrupt and that Islam is 

00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:31.999
 Truth and many others 

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:34.129
 Actually I really learned that 

00:14:31.999 --> 00:14:36.429
 Worships Gods 3 never cross 

00:14:34.129 --> 00:14:39.589
 I fell amazed 

00:14:36.429 --> 00:14:42.199
 Nothing really rocked him at all 

00:14:39.589 --> 00:14:44.509
 Able to refute anything you are 

00:14:42.199 --> 00:14:46.759
 Throw his way and it bothered me 

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:50.749
 Because I felt like maybe I was not ready 

00:14:46.759 --> 00:14:53.119
 After a share about Islam or even be able 

00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:56.509
 To convert anyone to Islam, however 

00:14:53.119 --> 00:15:00.230
 All was shot at me 

00:14:56.509 --> 00:15:01.959
 I stay inside and would like to return to the back home 

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:04.970
 And start thinking about what he says 

00:15:01.959 --> 00:15:07.699
 Why did not reject the idea that 

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:10.039
 Crossing never happened why he persuaded 

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:12.259
 That the Bible is a word that was wrong of 

00:15:10.039 --> 00:15:14.629
 God and many other things, and why not 

00:15:12.259 --> 00:15:18.769
 He was convinced that Jesus was God in 

00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:22.429
 The meat continued while I was looking at 

00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:24.589
 My own time and Islam's comparison 

00:15:22.429 --> 00:15:28.669
 Form a Christian that you would hear 

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:31.100
 Now, I began to realize that there is more 

00:15:28.669 --> 00:15:33.439
 To the story of the cross and the gospel 

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:37.639
 From what I was told 

00:15:33.439 --> 00:15:39.980
 Or at least grew up to think you could 

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:44.659
 I say that those two families got used to 

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:46.730
 I got the seeds of salvation I got for 

00:15:44.659 --> 00:15:49.100
 Point where I was very discouraged about 

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:51.259
 My own faith that I lost even any 

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:54.289
 An interest in doing my religious duties 

00:15:51.259 --> 00:15:56.509
 Any more to this point that sometimes my country 

00:15:54.289 --> 00:15:58.519
 Friends at work who are not religious 

00:15:56.509 --> 00:16:00.169
 Not even caring for God will remind me 

00:15:58.519 --> 00:16:02.239
 That's how I came, I'm not fasting anymore 

00:16:00.169 --> 00:16:03.949
 So how do I take breaks to go 

00:16:02.239 --> 00:16:07.519
 And we pray you see the enemy sometimes 

00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:09.259
 They want to attack you want somehow to 

00:16:07.519 --> 00:16:13.339
 Prevent you from seeking the truth and 

00:16:09.259 --> 00:16:15.829
 He uses no means to do this but God has been to it 

00:16:13.339 --> 00:16:24.019
 Graceful, merciful and patient with 

00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:28.039
 Me in 2001 and one Sunday in May after that 

00:16:24.019 --> 00:16:31.129
 An invitation to go to church several times before 

00:16:28.039 --> 00:16:33.649
 Some friends have decided that Sunday 

00:16:31.129 --> 00:16:37.579
 For any reason to go to church and 

00:16:33.649 --> 00:16:41.119
 I had a schedule I said I'm gonna go to 

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:42.770
 Church sit down and find out who they are 

00:16:41.119 --> 00:16:45.170
 Sermons and preaching 

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:47.870
 Exactly it does not teach people like my country 

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:50.620
 A friend and that family so that I can use 

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:53.420
 Against it and convert it to Islam 

00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:56.959
 Now as an engineer I thought it was 

00:16:53.420 --> 00:17:00.620
 A complete plan and so did the Holy Spirit as well 

00:16:56.959 --> 00:17:02.510
 I arrived on that day I sat in 

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:05.360
 Very last Pio, and I remember watching 

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:07.670
 Him glory and rejoicing to 

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.410
 Then the Lord's preacher began 

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:11.600
 Preaching and the message was complete 

00:17:09.410 --> 00:17:13.010
 She sent me and I was kind of bothered 

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.730
 Because I thought my friends said 

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:18.199
 The pastor that you were there I came to 

00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:19.939
 Next Sunday and the same 

00:17:18.199 --> 00:17:22.400
 An event has been forwarded to the full message 

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:25.819
 For me, every day I will go back in 

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:29.929
 God will send a message and determined 

00:17:25.819 --> 00:17:32.210
 Just for me and then he started preaching 

00:17:29.929 --> 00:17:34.520
 From the Gospel of John to the End for 

00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:36.230
 Sermon series from John's book 

00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:40.429
 It started five years earlier 

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:43.580
 During that trip I began to hear 

00:17:40.429 --> 00:17:46.610
 Some cool things about who Jesus is 

00:17:43.580 --> 00:17:49.970
 Suddenly it was a state of mind 

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:53.120
 A Muslim person who rejected Christ as 

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:58.040
 Son of God or incarnate God that I fell in 

00:17:53.120 --> 00:18:00.440
 Love with this Jesus and I really said 

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:04.390
 You want to follow him even if he is 

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:08.090
 Spun my own imagination but only me 

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:10.840
 It was not the month of April but not able to communicate 

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:14.720
 The points were still hard for me to 

00:18:10.840 --> 00:18:17.750
 Take myself out of this template that I was 

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:21.559
 In all of my life in fact for 

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:24.920
 Fourteen centuries I was in a potion 

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:27.650
 Hidden in it, but God was patient 

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:30.710
 He treated me according to 

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:32.720
 My own understanding of September 11 

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:35.600
 It happened during that time I was 

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.420
 All around were very discouraged 

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.280
 Something I knew why some happened 

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:42.620
 Point in my life and I was ready to do 

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:45.800
 Something similar to that at least backwards 

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:48.110
 In Afghanistan when I wanted to go however 

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:51.050
 It was a wake-up call for me and then 

00:18:48.110 --> 00:18:54.010
 I started to get this dream this vision I 

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:56.240
 It will be called a reality nightmare 

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:59.870
 Mostly the same 

00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.820
 Every time I have I died 

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:03.940
 I stand before the throne of God 

00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:08.000
 And God is asking me a simple question 

00:19:03.940 --> 00:19:11.150
 Why my son refused and I did not 

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.520
 I have an answer for that a few 

00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:16.640
 Months later it was November 2001 

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:18.830
 When I finally had the courage to confess 

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.380
 That you are wrong and in need of 

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:28.070
 Savior, I prayed and accepted 

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:30.440
 The Lord and Savior since then 

00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:33.170
 Forward that I was 12 years old since I started 

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.120
 I see God's hand in my service life 

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:38.480
 The doors began to open and realized 

00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:41.540
 Quickly that calling for me is for 

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:43.610
 Education teach equip and encourage i have to 

00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.500
 I tell you until this point I did not 

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:49.970
 I think I can stand in front of an audience 

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:53.080
 Two and hadith but God has shown me 

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:55.850
 That if you are to humble yourself I 

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:59.030
 It will open many doors for you that 

00:19:55.850 --> 00:20:04.100
 I'll blow off your socks I didn't know 

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:07.280
 That phrase at that time is on God’s path 

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:10.280
 The banners during it for 

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.830
 Twelve years ago this message was shared by 

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:15.770
 The method was not heard by thousands then 

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:17.870
 Five years before the door opened up to me 

00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.440
 To appear on satellite TV broadcasts on 

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:20.870
 Middle east 

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.750
 60 million households usually watched 

00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:25.370
 Which specific program request and I 

00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:28.010
 By the host who is a former Muslim 

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:30.410
 Himself to share my degree I was 

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:33.260
 Initially scared to by 

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:36.410
 The way Islam leaves means that there is 

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:39.140
 The death penalty against me already 

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:42.500
 The family has already absolved me as a 

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:44.420
 Lead this is my brother one 

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.750
 Who wants to come after me all the time 

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:51.560
 And I told him you wanted me to show up 

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:53.660
 Where exactly and do what you know 

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.980
 What will happen to me said yes 

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:55.490
 This is the beauty around them all 

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.419
 Thing 

00:20:55.490 --> 00:21:02.340
 I felt like he did not care 

00:20:59.419 --> 00:21:05.640
 But he told me that we wanted to reach 

00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:08.700
 To our people and nobody can be more 

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:12.330
 Effective with each other on their own 

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:15.330
 That left Christ acceptable and 

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:18.270
 Actually I first appeared in 

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:20.970
 2007 and I still remember it was in 

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:24.510
 December 2007, I have shared my testimony 

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:27.690
 And a Saudi woman was the college 

00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:30.660
 A student at that time accepted Christ 

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:32.400
 Lord and Savior nine months after her 

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:35.580
 Father and brother discovered that and 

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:39.330
 Kill her as a result of this this is it 

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:41.610
 What we deal with several times later 

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:44.070
 She appeared in the same program and thousands 

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:46.919
 Thousands of people listened 

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:48.809
 The message, teachings and many more 

00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:50.669
 Things then three years ago and I'm even 

00:21:48.809 --> 00:21:52.350
 Get involved with another bold project 

00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:53.940
 With the same ministry, and it has to be 

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:57.030
 He co-authored a book called the Qur'an 

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:59.460
 The dilemma of critical analysis of the Qur'an 

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:01.559
 To show the Muslim people my own people 

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:04.799
 Writers would believe in with 

00:22:01.559 --> 00:22:07.020
 All their hearts is the perfect book that 

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:10.320
 The book is that God is somehow alone 

00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:15.360
 Preserving the Bible is a book 

00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:17.610
 Not worth it's papers on and if 

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:21.179
 Its foundation then vibrates 

00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:24.720
 You should seek the true foundation, therefore 

00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:26.770
 Our Lord Jesus Christ the rock that was 

00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:29.020
 Hope 

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:30.850
 I can tell you a lot of encouragement 

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.170
 Stories but on Tuesday when I am here I'll 

00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:33.940
 Be more than happy to answer many 

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:37.060
 Questions about the book and impact 

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:39.040
 Who made it and I am now also involved 

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.930
 In ministries through social media I 

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.330
 I have found my own TV called Islamic 

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:46.140
 The dilemma of that Lord has blessed me 

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:49.840
 Many opportunities for one purpose 

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:52.800
 I don't think I was the one who did 

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:56.530
 But remember that it is who 

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:59.230
 It led me to this point and reign 

00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:01.330
 Me with a message to share with you 

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:04.590
 We encourage you, my hope, and my prayers 

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:09.100
 That is when you get out of here today ie 

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:11.920
 The fear you had about Islam or Muslims will 

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:16.780
 Completely dead you will not walk 

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:20.380
 From here loving him more so now let us 

00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:22.300
 I tell you that I know one of 

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:26.020
 The biggest obstacles we will face 

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:28.740
 Usually in proselytizing it is fear I mean 

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:31.360
 Many of us are wondering if they have 

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:33.700
 E-eloquence to participate in the Bible if it is 

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:37.900
 You have the right tools to respond if they are 

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:39.490
 She is able to discuss even issues that 

00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:41.650
 It is so huge and so big 

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:44.140
 I'm gonna offend the person I'm talking to 

00:23:41.650 --> 00:23:47.200
 Then on top of that I was a student 

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:49.350
 Me to share it with who is with Muslims 

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:52.530
 You are out of your mind 

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:55.150
 Do not know that they may kill me 

00:23:52.530 --> 00:24:00.900
 What about them if they are not converted 

00:23:55.150 --> 00:24:04.570
 It's gonna die that's true fear 

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:07.930
 Legitimacy here is what the Bible says 

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:11.320
 About that if we go for example 

00:24:07.930 --> 00:24:14.790
 To first Corinthians chapter 2, we are 

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:19.750
 The reading will begin from verse 1 Paul 

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:21.970
 Again reflects on his own feelings for 

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:24.660
 The Corinthians say it, and when 

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:26.830
 I came to you brothers did not come 

00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:29.890
 He announces to you the testimony of God 

00:24:26.830 --> 00:24:32.380
 With a noble speech of wisdom for I 

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:34.810
 I decided to share with you or the knowledge 

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:38.010
 Nothing among you but Jesus Christ 

00:24:34.810 --> 00:24:42.660
 And upon him crucified and here is hunting 

00:24:38.010 --> 00:24:46.880
 I was with you and listening to what Paul 

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:50.400
 He says in weakness in fear and many 

00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:53.190
 Trembling You realize what's going on 

00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.800
 Here this is Paul who is responsible for 

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:58.620
 Almost half of the New Testament was 

00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:04.770
 I am called a messenger by Christ from God 

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:07.380
 Himself but it is not announced, and it is 

00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:12.500
 Transparency with us that he has fear in 

00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:16.410
 Him whenever he goes to participate in the Bible 

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:21.240
 What is the conclusion if you have fear 

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:23.370
 You qualify and that's what you say 

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:26.610
 This should be fear for you 

00:25:23.370 --> 00:25:30.690
 Share most of the precious news that 

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:32.970
 The whole world should know about another 

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:39.000
 The thing that we should be aware of too 

00:25:32.970 --> 00:25:41.900
 That we have to be prepared all the time for 

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.690
 Give an answer to defend themselves if you wish to 

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:51.540
 Those who ask us about the hope that we can 

00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:54.900
 It is in us to compel Peter 3:15 now 

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:59.570
 We are all advocates mainly called 

00:25:54.900 --> 00:26:03.090
 According to this clip we are all 

00:25:59.570 --> 00:26:06.480
 Expected to know how to respond about 

00:26:03.090 --> 00:26:11.180
 Our hope for this simple is to share our views 

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:16.260
 Own testimony of why Jesus is our Lord 

00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:18.590
 No excuses we don't need us to become 

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:21.950
 Scientists do not need to go to 

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:25.980
 Religious institutes to be able to evangelize us 

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:31.230
 Lord in his sermon on the mountain in 

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:34.470
 Matthew 5:14 2:16 All of us expected to 

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:39.120
 Be the Evangelists when you say 

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:41.460
 Light from the world did not say that 

00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:44.850
 Some of you are light said to you 

00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:48.060
 It is not just light, light 

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:50.130
 The world so let's shine the light before 

00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.480
 Men are on the way to like this to see your own 

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.190
 Good deeds 

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:54.990
 And glorify your Father who is in the heavens 

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.910
 This is what happened in my case when 

00:26:54.990 --> 00:27:00.180
 I saw that the light of Christ is in life 

00:26:56.910 --> 00:27:03.210
 Two families by which way even 

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:05.760
 Last year the first family did not even 

00:27:03.210 --> 00:27:09.210
 He has the slightest idea that I am a believer 

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:13.430
 Christ because I cut my ties with them 

00:27:09.210 --> 00:27:13.430
 For 23 years 

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:20.220
 Paul Cheerleader Timothy Young at 

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:24.300
 2 Timothy 4: 2 tells him that he is 

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:26.450
 You must preach needs a word in a season 

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:29.730
 Out of season, and it is on my other 

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:33.660
 He admonished you to be prepared 

00:27:29.730 --> 00:27:38.030
 At all times, ready to share in 

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:42.990
 All chapters there is no right and wrong 

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:45.090
 Time for class but God opens the door 

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:50.460
 The right door at the right time, we are 

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:52.110
 You must always be ready to finally deliver 

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:56.930
 I want to share that passage with you 

00:27:52.110 --> 00:28:01.260
 Summarizes my entire Paul testimony 

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:06.090
 After being persecuted at Ephesus 

00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:09.660
 Almost death point I went to 

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:11.670
 Thessalonica and spent three weeks in 

00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.970
 There God really used that time to 

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:18.660
 Founding a church that got two 

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:22.380
 First and second Thessalonians 

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:26.220
 That is in our area blessed today in the Bible 

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:29.820
 His first message was Paul trying to 

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:32.700
 Show people in Thessalonica 

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:35.400
 How he felt about them and why 

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:38.940
 I decided to come and exchange the gospel 

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:42.650
 With them in Chapter 2 1 

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:46.010
 Thessalonians 2: 8 and this is what he says 

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:48.330
 So Utley's imagination is being desired by you 

00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:50.990
 Not only were we willing to share with you 

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:56.220
 The Gospel of God but also our very 

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:59.840
 Our own selves our own selves why life 

00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:04.380
 Because you have become dear to us 

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:05.460
 Let me tell you what Paul is saying keep 

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.070
 In mind Paul is the hadith 

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:12.750
 To them today as believers but it is 

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:16.169
 Saying before he came to them to share 

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:19.289
 What does that mean when? 

00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:24.419
 Pagans were still and pagans did not 

00:29:19.289 --> 00:29:30.510
 Knowledge of Christ or God is not preserved but it is 

00:29:24.419 --> 00:29:33.450
 He says he loved her so much, and decided 

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:37.260
 Share not only the gospel in words 

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:40.760
 But in life style even if that means 

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:45.059
 Their very own lives must be sacrificed 

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:49.169
 He was just persecuted and stoned yet 

00:29:45.059 --> 00:29:52.260
 He was still ready to come again and 

00:29:49.169 --> 00:29:56.159
 Share the gospel here again with another 

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:57.720
 A group of people do not like the people 

00:29:56.159 --> 00:30:01.980
 If you want to share the Bible with 

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:05.309
 Even before you have seen them 

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:10.200
 You pray for specific groups of people 

00:30:05.309 --> 00:30:13.620
 You may not need in your life and 

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:17.850
 Do Muslims pray for Mormons to 

00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:23.340
 Atheists Have a desire for them 

00:30:17.850 --> 00:30:26.460
 To know Christ our Lord because that is in 

00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:29.669
 What book is teaching you can see 

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:32.700
 Evangelization is not step 1 step 2 step 3 

00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:35.270
 It's not about earning a degree it's not 

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:39.210
 About model or style 

00:30:35.270 --> 00:30:43.039
 Angelicism begins with the right heart 

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:45.720
 The correct position in Christ Jesus 

00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:52.130
 The least we can do for them is pray for 

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:54.419
 Them the least we can do last year 

00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:56.880
 After searching for a family to 

00:30:54.419 --> 00:30:59.460
 Nearly 11 years since I became 

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:03.390
 A believer lost hope that I will ever 

00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:07.110
 Find it I just wanted to thank them 

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:09.000
 That I used God made in my life 23 

00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:11.669
 Years before sowing that seeds 

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.600
 It thrived in the salvation that God has 

00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:17.700
 Used in his power to open many doors 

00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:18.700
 Millions of Muslims have heard 

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.669
 Degree 

00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:23.320
 Millions of Muslims read millions 

00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:25.269
 Muslims are reached through 

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.840
 Ministry of Social Media that I was involved 

00:31:25.269 --> 00:31:31.710
 In or TV shows or many others 

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:34.869
 Because of their honesty because of 

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:38.549
 Sacrifice, life and sharing 

00:31:34.869 --> 00:31:42.369
 The Gospel in Words and Life's Style 

00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:44.799
 Finally somehow God decided it was 

00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:49.869
 The right time, believe it or not, was 

00:31:44.799 --> 00:31:52.809
 It was a Super Bowl Sunday there is a Super Bowl 

00:31:49.869 --> 00:31:54.669
 Sunday that is what happened when I found 

00:31:52.809 --> 00:31:56.259
 Very original envelope because I am 

00:31:54.669 --> 00:32:00.399
 First received from 

00:31:56.259 --> 00:32:02.080
 University around that family do not know 

00:32:00.399 --> 00:32:06.730
 Where to find her I am very used to 

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:09.309
 A powerful tool called Google was so out 

00:32:06.730 --> 00:32:12.399
 Easy to find their entire history of 

00:32:09.309 --> 00:32:14.049
 Before they are born I know everything 

00:32:12.399 --> 00:32:16.749
 About them that they probably did not 

00:32:14.049 --> 00:32:19.029
 Even I know but you are looking for one 

00:32:16.749 --> 00:32:22.059
 The thing is where they are today and found 

00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:25.090
 This and contacted them you know what 

00:32:22.059 --> 00:32:30.850
 They told me we were just praying for 

00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:34.239
 You this month 23 years it does not stop 

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:37.330
 To pray and they don't even know that 

00:32:34.239 --> 00:32:39.220
 I am locked in, and when I am subscribed 

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:42.940
 With them they were blown away how 

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:44.879
 Use God as a simple ministry to 

00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:47.529
 Blossom to what it is today for 

00:32:44.879 --> 00:32:49.389
 They decided to quit that ministry 

00:32:47.529 --> 00:32:52.450
 A few years earlier he was thinking 

00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:54.789
 It was not working because they had not seen 

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:59.139
 The fruits of that ministry in their lives 

00:32:54.789 --> 00:33:03.039
 Our life God is strong God there 

00:32:59.139 --> 00:33:06.669
 Why is Thessalonians 1 we are 

00:33:03.039 --> 00:33:10.250
 I read that when we sow one seed of will 

00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:14.690
 One plant and water but God will grow 

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:17.810
 Seeds that they have no confidence in will do 

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:21.680
 Work that you and I will never be 

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:24.410
 Able to do so I just want to leave you 

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:27.680
 With this if you come here today 

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:30.800
 For fear of Muslims I hope for 

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:34.130
 They will withdraw from here running to cuddle 

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:37.760
 Them and pray for them and share 

00:33:34.130 --> 00:33:41.930
 The truth is with them in words and in life 

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:47.000
 Let us pray to our Heavenly Father 

00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:54.520
 Very thankful, thankful the Lord to do 

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:58.280
 Our weakness used our doubts our fear 

00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:01.700
 God is powerless to do this mighty job 

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:03.770
 The kingdom of your Lord, we are 

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:07.310
 Good luck that you have called us 

00:34:03.770 --> 00:34:11.030
 To be partners with you and employees of 

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:13.460
 Your fields I invite to 

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:15.950
 Muslims today it will be reached 

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:17.899
 Of my brothers and sisters and others 

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:21.440
 Like them we will pray for 

00:34:17.899 --> 00:34:23.450
 Them all the time I pray for my people I 

00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:25.340
 Pray for the Saudis pray for the king 

00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:28.010
 Lord, if you compose his heart 

00:34:25.340 --> 00:34:31.639
 It will come to know you are 

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:34.370
 Lord, Father, I pray that they will pass 

00:34:31.639 --> 00:34:37.760
 Those borders of the kingdom of light 

00:34:34.370 --> 00:34:40.810
 Darkness to the kingdom of light we ask 

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:43.170
 All this in the name of the mighty of Christ 

00:34:40.810 --> 00:34:45.670
 Trustworthy 

00:34:43.170 --> 00:34:45.670
 [clap]
