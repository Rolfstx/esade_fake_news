("Dog on Fire")

00:00:07.474 --> 00:00:10.243 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Last year, I played
Horatio in Hamlet

00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:12.779
at the public theater
opposite Oscar Issac.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:16.750
(audience cheers and applauds)

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.318
It was a dream come true.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.786
It was like coming home

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:21.488 align:start size:94% position:6%
and a brand new dream
come true at the same time

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:23.323 align:start size:88% position:13%
and I just want to be
able to do more of that.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:24.257
- That's amazing.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.759
Speaking of dreams coming true,

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.794 align:start size:94% position:6%
my dream was to be in "The
Lion King" and I'm not.

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.829
(Keegan and audience laughs)

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.365
And I see that you are,

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:34.300
you are going to be
in "The Lion King."

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.335
- Oh, this one, oh, I am!

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:36.603
I am gonna be in
"The Lion King."

00:00:36.603 --> 00:00:37.637
- You're gonna be
in "The Lion King."

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:39.672
How the (bleep) did that happen?

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.241
(audience laughs)

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:42.542
- Can I just say
this for a second?

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:44.444
Those cards felt really
comfortable in my hands.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.913
- You know, many
people, in fact,

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:49.916 align:start size:94% position:6%
tried to reduce you to
just, you know, your fact,

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.985 align:start size:88% position:13%
so they went, oh you're
getting successful

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:55.255
just because you're Asian,
just because you're a woman,

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.490
just because you're pregnant.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.160 align:start size:88% position:13%
- There was a guy, who,
I won't name names,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.661 align:start size:84% position:16%
he's not a very
successful comedian,

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:03.363 align:start size:94% position:6%
so I don't even know if
you would know who he was.

00:01:03.363 --> 00:01:05.598
- [Trevor] No, I don't.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:06.633
- You wouldn't know.

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:08.601
You're outta there now.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:09.803
But he came up to me

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.304 align:start size:84% position:16%
while I was pregnant
the second time

00:01:11.304 --> 00:01:14.107 align:start size:94% position:6%
and he touched my belly
with his fat, sweaty hand,

00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:15.575
which is so gross to begin with.

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:18.445 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's like why don't you
finger me while you're at it?

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:20.246
This is so not okay.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.714
Just because I'm pregnant,

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:24.050 align:start size:94% position:6%
doesn't mean it's okay
for you to touch my belly.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.919
And he was like, oh,
so this is your shtick,

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.454
this is your thing, now, right?

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:28.655
And I was like,

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:31.724 align:start size:88% position:13%
getting pregnant is
not rainbow suspenders.

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.259 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's not a shtick
and then he was like,

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.263
"You're so lucky, Ali, because
you get all of this attention

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:40.300
"'cause you're both a
female and a minority."

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.768 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I was like, "Yeah,
'cause you know,

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:44.504 align:start size:97% position:3%
"historically that's always
been the winning combo

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.774
"for recognition and success."

00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:52.345
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:53.613 align:start size:84% position:16%
And he was like, "You
know what I mean,

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.949
"like me, I'm just
another white guy."

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:59.385
And I was like, "Be
a better white guy."

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:00.854
- Is there anything else
you wanna tell us about?

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:01.788
'Cause I just like
chatting to you.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.790
- Oh, I actually did wanna say

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.493
that I hope that the fact that

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:09.863 align:start size:97% position:3%
Between The Scenes has become
like a whole (beep) thing

00:02:09.863 --> 00:02:11.664
is something that
you're happy about

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:14.300
and not like, I've gotta
do bonus interviews now,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.036
because Anna one time came after

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.439 align:start size:97% position:3%
in Between The Scenes and
now it's like a whole thing.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.508 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, no, but you're
the only person

00:02:21.508 --> 00:02:23.843
who refused to listen
to me when I said--

00:02:23.843 --> 00:02:25.044
- It's not a thing?

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.212 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Between The Scenes
is not a thing.

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:27.013 align:start size:88% position:13%
- But now it's a thing,
so you're welcome.

00:02:27.013 --> 00:02:28.481
- Yes.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.917
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:32.452
Thank you, Anna.

00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:34.787
- But I hope that's okay and
not just more work for you.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.322
- No, no, it's fine.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:37.257
- I can tell in your eyes
that you kind of hate it.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.224
- No, these are happy eyes.

00:02:38.224 --> 00:02:39.993
These are happy eyes.

00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.761 align:start size:84% position:16%
These are eyes that
enjoy doing more work,

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:42.595
that's what these eyes are.

00:02:42.595 --> 00:02:44.097
- No, never, no, no, no!

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:46.833 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Congratulations on another
season of Grey's Anatomy.

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.968 align:start size:97% position:3%
The show's been going, how
many seasons has it been, now?

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.570
- We just finished 15.

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.540 align:start size:97% position:3%
- 15 seasons.
(audience cheers and applauds)

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.041 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You've been doing
it for so long

00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:59.112
that I feel like you should
have an honorary degree.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:00.980 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I could be a fully
credited surgeon by now.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.816
- Do you think you know
enough fake medicine

00:03:03.816 --> 00:03:04.984
to do real medicine?

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:08.021
- I could slow your death.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:10.857
(audience and Trevor laughs)

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:13.493
I could buy you a
few extra minutes.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:16.496
But, you know what's
funny is that like,

00:03:16.496 --> 00:03:17.964
and I think I've
said this before,

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start size:97% position:3%
I've definitely had at least
two instances on a plane

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.636
where somebody has gone, is
there a doctor on the plane,

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:26.239 align:start size:97% position:3%
and then the flight attendant
looks directly at me,

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.576 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it's like, lady, the
one thing you know about me,

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:31.044 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm like anybody
else on this flight,

00:03:31.044 --> 00:03:33.146 align:start size:97% position:3%
the one thing you know about
me is I'm not a doctor.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:34.380
(audience laughs)

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.716 align:start size:88% position:13%
But it's like, you, you,
no, no, please don't.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.818
Fine, all right, just
go through the motions,

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:41.354
I don't know what, this is
how bad of a doctor I am,

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.555 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't know.
- Is that how you do?

00:03:42.555 --> 00:03:43.756
- I'm just stretching
is what I'm doing.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:45.191
- That's your CPR?

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:46.626 align:start position:0%
- This is like a little cabbage
patch or something, yeah.

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.461
- That was a very sexy CPR.

00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:50.063
(audience laughs)

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.031 align:start position:0%
That was like, yo, I know
you're not coming back to life,

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:53.266
but you're going out happy.

00:03:53.266 --> 00:03:54.601
- I brought you
a little present.

00:03:54.601 --> 00:03:55.868 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You brought me a present?
- Yes.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.503
So I introduced a term.

00:03:57.503 --> 00:03:59.772
- Oh, you brought me a
little bag, I love bags!

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:01.441 align:start size:94% position:6%
I got a bag, I love bags!
- A little gift bag.

00:04:01.441 --> 00:04:03.676
She always leaves a party
giving people gift bags.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:07.013
So back when we checked
in in the dressing room

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:09.916
I taught you a term, the
term is gender (bleep).

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.784
- All right, I've never
heard of that before.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.786
- Yeah, and it's not
what it sounds like,

00:04:13.786 --> 00:04:15.088
it's like playing
with your gender

00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.789
and having a damn good time.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:18.758
And so I brought you
some clip on earrings.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:19.926
- Oh wow.

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:21.427 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Because I figured
you could use.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.263 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So I get to wear these?
- Yeah, so you see this is--

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.197
- You know what kills me
with clip-ons all the time

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:25.398
is they give me headaches.

00:04:25.398 --> 00:04:26.599 align:start size:84% position:16%
But these one's aren't
tight, I promise.

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:28.134 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you sure?
- They're good ones.

00:04:28.134 --> 00:04:29.535
- 'Cause a lot of the times
they'll give you headaches.

00:04:29.535 --> 00:04:33.072 align:start size:97% position:3%
- No, they're gentle!
(audience cheers and applauds)

00:04:36.042 --> 00:04:38.311
Look at that, wow!

00:04:39.812 --> 00:04:41.914
Trevor, this is, I mean like,

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:43.816 align:start size:84% position:16%
I don't wanna be your
stylist right now

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.485
and I don't wanna like,
you know, but I just,

00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.854 align:start size:97% position:3%
this is a look, you realize
this is a look, right?

00:04:47.854 --> 00:04:49.889
- You know what's
interesting for me,

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.393
to your ideas of gender
and how we identify it

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:55.328 align:start size:88% position:13%
and what signifies
gender around the world

00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:58.431
is in South Africa and
many African cultures

00:04:58.431 --> 00:05:02.268 align:start size:97% position:3%
men will wear earrings like
this and to your point,

00:05:02.268 --> 00:05:03.770
it doesn't, like no
one would be like,

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.040 align:start size:97% position:3%
oh, that man is not man or is,
do you get what I'm saying?

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.574 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Yeah.
- It's funny,

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:11.411
'cause like this I'm like, oh,
I look traditional right now.

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.645 align:start size:81% position:19%
(audience laughs)
- Yes!

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:13.846 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Like that's what I'm
thinking right now.

00:05:13.846 --> 00:05:15.214 align:start size:84% position:16%
Like if my grandmother
saw she'd be like,

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:19.519 align:start size:94% position:6%
"Finally, he's connecting
with his roots!"

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.021
Do you ever get bored of people

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:23.556 align:start size:88% position:13%
asking you to
freestyle in real life?

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:26.693
'Cause let's be honest, you
have become the hip hop guy

00:05:26.693 --> 00:05:28.361
and now you have
the freestyle show

00:05:28.361 --> 00:05:29.896 align:start size:94% position:6%
and it's like so it's
freestyle and it's hip hop

00:05:29.896 --> 00:05:32.565 align:start size:97% position:3%
so I feel like everywhere
you go people are just like,

00:05:32.565 --> 00:05:34.934
"Oh my god, Lin, how are you?"

00:05:34.934 --> 00:05:39.772
♪ It's a coffee mug, a boo
boo chee, a boo boo chee ♪

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:42.909
♪ A boo boo chee,
a boo boo chee ♪

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.511
♪ I love coffee
and I wanna say ♪

00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.548
♪ You drink it every
day, come on, Lin ♪

00:05:48.548 --> 00:05:50.650 align:start size:97% position:3%
Be honest with me, how
many people do that to you?

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.919
- Well, only reporters.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.823
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.293
My new thing that I've done,

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:02.428 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you could probably do
an amazing super cut on this

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:05.031 align:start size:88% position:13%
'cause you guys are
wizards at that is like,

00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.467 align:start size:97% position:3%
my new things is I say, I
will freestyle if you beatbox.

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:11.604 align:start size:97% position:3%
So you could do a super
cut of reporters beatboxing

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:14.874 align:start size:97% position:3%
just to get me to freestyle
and it's a lot of like

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:18.277 align:start size:88% position:13%
little white ladies
being like (beatboxing).

00:06:19.912 --> 00:06:21.414
(audience laughs)

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:26.419 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You are a Palestinian
Kuwaiti Muslim

00:06:27.887 --> 00:06:30.289
traveling the world with no
passport and you were like,

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:32.425
"Yeah, I wanna try to do
this in more countries."

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:33.659
- Yeah. (laughs)

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.661 align:start size:84% position:16%
Well, I'm born to
Palestinian parents.

00:06:35.661 --> 00:06:38.030 align:start size:84% position:16%
- How many times
did you get stopped?

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:39.499
- Every time, no,
it was every time

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:41.100
to the point to when
I became a citizen

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.335
and I was reentering America

00:06:42.335 --> 00:06:43.603
and he was like,
"Okay, go ahead."

00:06:43.603 --> 00:06:44.971 align:start size:81% position:19%
And I was like,
"No, are you sure?

00:06:44.971 --> 00:06:47.607 align:start size:97% position:3%
"I think there's another...
(audience laughs)

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:50.176 align:start size:94% position:6%
"There's something else
that needs to happen here.

00:06:50.176 --> 00:06:52.812 align:start size:97% position:3%
"I feel awkward, can we just
talk for a little while?"

00:06:52.812 --> 00:06:54.881
(audience laughs)

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:57.950
I'm serious, they did.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:01.187
I was like, "What's goin' on?"

00:07:01.187 --> 00:07:02.855
I was like, "No, we need
to chat a little bit."

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:05.224
Like Japan was my favorite
interrogation I ever had,

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:06.426
it was just an hour of them

00:07:06.426 --> 00:07:08.895 align:start size:88% position:13%
trying to figure out
what I did for a living.

00:07:08.895 --> 00:07:10.930
The entire hour, for
real, consisted of,

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.765
"So, what is your occupation?"

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:13.900
I was like, "Oh,
I'm a comedian."

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.168
He's, like "Comedian?"

00:07:15.168 --> 00:07:16.903
I'm like, "Yeah, yeah,
I do stand up comedy."

00:07:16.903 --> 00:07:18.304
"Stand up comedy?"

00:07:18.304 --> 00:07:20.406 align:start size:94% position:6%
I'm like, "Yeah, I'm a...
(audience laughs)

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:21.974
"I do comedy", "Comedy?"

00:07:21.974 --> 00:07:24.177 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Yeah, I do, I'm a
comedian", "Comedian?"

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:26.846
I'm like, am I bein' roasted
right now, what's happening?

00:07:26.846 --> 00:07:29.849
(audience laughs)

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:32.118 align:start size:97% position:3%
Finally his buddy walks
in, his partner, he's like,

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:33.920
(speaking in foreign
language) comedian.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.889
And he goes, "Oh yeah,
he's like Bill Cosby."

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.724
(audience groans)

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:40.893 align:start size:84% position:16%
And that's what got
me off was Bill Cosby.

00:07:40.893 --> 00:07:43.696 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean, not literally,
not literally.

00:07:43.696 --> 00:07:48.267
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:50.870
- A lot of people
who are refugees

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.572 align:start size:84% position:16%
or maybe came to
the US as immigrants

00:07:52.572 --> 00:07:54.740 align:start size:97% position:3%
had this connection with
Trump where they were worried.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.576
You had a different
connection with Trump

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:59.679
which is one of the reasons
you came into prominence,

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:04.183 align:start size:97% position:3%
really insane story where
you found yourself on a plane

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:06.052
seated next to Eric Trump.

00:08:06.052 --> 00:08:07.053
- That's, yeah.

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:12.058 align:start size:94% position:6%
You know, bein' a frequent
flyer helps sometimes.

00:08:12.058 --> 00:08:13.459
I didn't know this
was gonna happen,

00:08:13.459 --> 00:08:15.928 align:start size:84% position:16%
like I was upgrading
to first class

00:08:15.928 --> 00:08:17.563 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I ended up sitting
next to Eric Trump.

00:08:17.563 --> 00:08:19.465
I didn't even know I
was gonna get upgraded

00:08:19.465 --> 00:08:21.501
'cause I put my name on
the list way to late,

00:08:21.501 --> 00:08:23.402 align:start size:84% position:16%
you know, comedians
are, you know,

00:08:23.402 --> 00:08:25.171 align:start size:88% position:13%
the best procrastinators
in the business

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:27.640 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I didn't know I
was gonna get upgraded

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.809
much less sit next to Eric,
but I do know one thing,

00:08:29.809 --> 00:08:32.945
the lady that upgraded me is
probably a Clinton supporter,

00:08:32.945 --> 00:08:34.146
you know, let's be real.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:35.581
She was probably
sittin' there like,

00:08:35.581 --> 00:08:38.985 align:start size:97% position:3%
"Oh, Eric Trump is on my
flight, okay, uh huh, uh huh."

00:08:38.985 --> 00:08:41.621
I don't know why she has a
mustache but okay, mm-hmm.

00:08:41.621 --> 00:08:43.689
(audience laughs)

00:08:43.689 --> 00:08:45.525
"Oh, there's an empty
seat next to Eric?

00:08:45.525 --> 00:08:47.126
"Let me take a look
at this upgrade list,

00:08:47.126 --> 00:08:48.828
"see who's standing
by patiently here.

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:51.297 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Oh, Mohammed Mustafa
Amer, upgrade!"

00:08:52.865 --> 00:08:56.235
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:08:56.235 --> 00:08:58.538
- I often wonder
how much normalcy

00:08:58.538 --> 00:08:59.972
there still is in your life?

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:02.708 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like, how many normal
random things happen to you.

00:09:02.708 --> 00:09:04.143
Like, when was the last time

00:09:04.143 --> 00:09:06.679 align:start size:97% position:3%
your phone ran out of battery
while you were speaking?

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.180
Has that ever happened to you?

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:10.950
- No.
- Okay.

00:09:10.950 --> 00:09:12.552
(audience laughs)

00:09:12.552 --> 00:09:14.520
So for instance, have there
ever been a moment where

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.657
you're in the bathroom and then
the toilet roll is done, no?

00:09:17.657 --> 00:09:18.691
- Oh, no.

00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:20.092
- What is the most?

00:09:20.092 --> 00:09:21.260
- No, you know why?

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.529 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because at my
house, I don't know

00:09:23.529 --> 00:09:24.964
if this happens at your house,

00:09:24.964 --> 00:09:28.434 align:start position:0%
but at my house when the toilet
roll is checked regularly

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:29.635
and when it's been checked,

00:09:29.635 --> 00:09:30.903 align:start size:84% position:16%
like after you're
going to the bathroom,

00:09:30.903 --> 00:09:32.338
somebody will come
in and it's folded

00:09:32.338 --> 00:09:33.706 align:start size:97% position:3%
into a little triangle.
- They fold a little triangle?

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:34.941 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yes.
- Like you live in a hotel?

00:09:34.941 --> 00:09:37.743
- It's like folding into
a triangle every time.

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:40.046 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Okay, okay, we'll
take one from each side.

00:09:40.046 --> 00:09:41.914
- I will tell you though,
some things very normal

00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:43.683 align:start size:88% position:13%
that you wouldn't think.
- Okay, let's go.

00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:48.588
- I travel with my own bread
and I bring my own avocados.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.422
- Are you serious?

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:50.856
- Yes I do.

00:09:50.856 --> 00:09:52.191 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I have an avocado
orchard so I think it's--

00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:54.927
- Oh, the story got
not normal, Oprah!

00:09:54.927 --> 00:09:56.162
You just said, "I'm gonna
tell you something normal",

00:09:56.162 --> 00:09:58.598
then you said, "I have
my own avocado orchard."

00:09:58.598 --> 00:09:59.966
(audience laughs)

00:09:59.966 --> 00:10:02.935 align:start position:0%
- But, so I think it's
ridiculous to pay for avocados.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:04.070 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Which is why you
bought your own orchard?

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.272
Are you kidding me?

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:08.107 align:start size:97% position:3%
That is not a normal story.
- Okay.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:11.210 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You sailed from
Europe to New York City.

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:17.750
New York City is quite
an assault on the senses

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:22.288 align:start size:81% position:19%
when you come from
anywhere else.

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:23.556
What is the biggest thing.

00:10:23.556 --> 00:10:25.524
that has stuck out to
you in New York City?

00:10:27.793 --> 00:10:30.730 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I mean, just everything,
all the impressions,

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.233 align:start size:84% position:16%
everything is so
much, so big, so loud.

00:10:34.233 --> 00:10:36.202
(audience laughs)

00:10:36.202 --> 00:10:38.471 align:start size:81% position:19%
People talk so
loud here as well.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.407
(audience laughs)

00:10:41.407 --> 00:10:43.209 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because when you're
on that boat,

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:46.879 align:start size:84% position:16%
when I was on the boat
there was nothing,

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:48.948
there was just the ocean

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:51.884
and of course the sound
of the waves crashing

00:10:51.884 --> 00:10:56.188
but that's it, no smells,

00:10:56.188 --> 00:10:59.759
(audience laughs)
apart from sweat.

00:11:01.627 --> 00:11:05.398 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I remember the
first thing I noticed

00:11:07.633 --> 00:11:11.871
when we came into the harbor
was I woke up and suddenly

00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:14.306 align:start size:84% position:16%
it smelled something.
(audience laughs)

00:11:14.306 --> 00:11:17.910 align:start size:97% position:3%
And of course it was
pollution, but still something

00:11:19.979 --> 00:11:21.047
and that was,

00:11:23.182 --> 00:11:24.917
it was undescribable

00:11:27.653 --> 00:11:30.356 align:start size:84% position:16%
to go from this
extreme environment,

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:33.125
you're disconnected from
everything and everyone,

00:11:33.125 --> 00:11:35.127 align:start size:84% position:16%
you only have yourself
and the ocean,

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:39.365 align:start size:84% position:16%
and the boat of
course, to New York.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:40.933
(audience laughs)

00:11:40.933 --> 00:11:43.936 align:start size:88% position:13%
- That is an accurate
and brilliant
description of New York.

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:45.137
(audience laughs)

00:11:45.137 --> 00:11:47.640 align:start size:84% position:16%
It is undescribable
and it smells.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.974
(audience laughs)

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:52.278
You work in Australia
but you live in the US

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:55.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
and your father lives
with you in Los Angeles,

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:58.250 align:start size:84% position:16%
or does he come and
visit you quite a lot?

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:02.521 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No, no, no, he lives
with us and yeah.

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:07.293
(audience laughs)

00:12:07.293 --> 00:12:09.862 align:start size:81% position:19%
The reason I'm
pausing is my dad,

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:14.467
when we lived in the UK we
lived in houses or apartments

00:12:14.467 --> 00:12:16.135
that we didn't have a yard.

00:12:16.135 --> 00:12:18.504 align:start size:88% position:13%
L.A. as most people
know has a lot of space

00:12:18.504 --> 00:12:23.042 align:start size:97% position:3%
and my dad has become
obsessed with leaf blowing.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.243
(audience laughs)

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:25.311
- Are you being serious?

00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:26.812
- I'm absolutely serious.

00:12:26.812 --> 00:12:29.315
- So your Nigerian dad is
obsessed with leaf blowers?

00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:30.783
- It's crazy.

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:34.553 align:start position:0%
If you knew Nigerians you'd
know that that was really weird.

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:39.625 align:start size:94% position:6%
What am I going to go
and do the gardening for?

00:12:42.194 --> 00:12:44.630
But the problem is
he never just does

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:46.265 align:start size:88% position:13%
like the constant
(imitates leaf blower),

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:49.802
because then you kinda go,
okay, daddy's leaf blowing.

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:51.303
He goes, (imitates leaf blower),

00:12:53.305 --> 00:12:56.108
(audience laughs)

00:12:57.309 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start size:84% position:16%
So for the hour that
he's doing this.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.549
- Oh man, oh man.

00:13:03.549 --> 00:13:05.251 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's just like one
leaf at a time.

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.888
- He's so happy when fall comes.

00:13:08.888 --> 00:13:11.023
Ah, here are the leaves!

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:14.994
(audience laughs and applauds)

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:17.663
