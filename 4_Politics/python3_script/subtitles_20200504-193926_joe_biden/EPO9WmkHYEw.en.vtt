YOU ANY QUESTIONS, KEEP IN MIND,
IT'S A FAMILY SHOW.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:44.871 align:start position:0%

OH, BOY.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.884 align:start position:0%
YOU'VE PLAYED A LOT OF GANGSTERS
THROUGHOUT THE YEARS.

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:02.955 align:start position:0%
A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE
PROSECUTED ACTUAL MOB BOSSES SAY

TRUMP RUNS THINGS LIKE IT'S THE
MOB.

( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; WELL, HE'S LIKE THE TEFLON

00:02:21.874 --> 00:02:26.445
DON, YOU KNOW, AND GIULIANI, OF
ALL PEOPLE, THE WAY I UNDERSTAND

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:34.520
IT, HE USED THE RICO ACT TO GO
AFTER GANGSTER FAMILIES, AND,

00:02:34.553 --> 00:02:41.561
SO, IT'S UNUSUAL THAT HE, NOW,
IS REPRESENTING THIS GANGSTER

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:42.995 size:81% position:41%
FIRST FAMILY, IF YOU WILL.

00:02:43.028 --> 00:02:44.697 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:56.075 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; THE WHOLE SITUATION IS BEYOND

00:02:56.108 --> 00:02:56.509 align:start position:0%
UNDERSTANDING.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:57.376 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT IS, YEAH.

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.314 size:84% position:42%
KIND OF HEARTBREAKING, TOO.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:04.050 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE OTHERWISE WHO HAVE BEEN
HEROS FALL.

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:06.752 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; TO ME IT'S MORE THAN
HEARTBREAKING.

00:03:06.785 --> 00:03:09.589 align:start position:0%
IT'S A REALLY, REALLY SERIOUS
SITUATION WE'RE IN.

00:03:09.622 --> 00:03:11.924 align:start position:0%
I DON'T WANT TO BRING PEOPLE
DOWN, BUT --

00:03:11.957 --> 00:03:13.159 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: NO.

00:03:13.192 --> 00:03:17.763 align:start position:0%
YEAH, I THINK THEY CAME
PRE-DOWN.

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:20.299 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; IT'S LIKE A PULL AROUND

00:03:20.332 --> 00:03:21.166 align:start position:0%
CERTAIN THINGS.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.202 align:start position:0%
IT'S LIKE LIVING IN AN ABUSIVE
HOUSEHOLD.

00:03:23.235 --> 00:03:29.208
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT CRAZY THING
IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT, WHAT'S

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:32.445 align:start position:0%
GOING TO MAKE YOU SAY WH WHAT TH
HELL IS GOING ON.

00:03:32.478 --> 00:03:36.048
&gt;&gt; Stephen: BECAUSE ONLY ONE
ANGRY PERSON GETS TO SAY WHAT

00:03:36.081 --> 00:03:37.717 align:start position:0%
THE TRUTH IS.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.685 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:03:38.718 --> 00:03:40.886 align:start position:0%
AND THE TRUTH IS NOT FROM HIM,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:52.765 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
AND HE'S A FAKE PRESIDENT.

00:03:52.798 --> 00:03:57.236 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DO YOU MEAN

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.738 align:start position:0%
BY THAT?

00:03:58.771 --> 00:04:02.675 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; WELL, HE CALLS EVERYTHING
FAKE BECAUSE HE KNOWS HE'S FAKE,

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.011 align:start position:0%
SO HE'S PROJECTING.

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:06.545
HE'S PROJECTING ALL THE TIME.

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:12.151 align:start position:0%
ACCUSE THEM OF THE THING THAT
YOU KNOW HE DID.

00:04:12.184 --> 00:04:15.421
&gt;&gt; SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN I DON'T
WANT TO GET ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL.

00:04:15.454 --> 00:04:16.722 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GO AHEAD.

00:04:16.755 --> 00:04:19.492 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:20.926 align:start position:0%
WANT TO REPLACE HIM.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.764 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE A NEW YORKER.

00:04:24.797 --> 00:04:26.499
BLOOMBERG OFFICIALLY ANNOUNCED.

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:28.567 align:start position:0%
YOU KNOW HIM, RIGHT?

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.268 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; A LITTLE BIT, YES.

00:04:29.301 --> 00:04:30.803
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:31.837 align:start position:0%
I LIKE BLOOMBERG.

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
HE'S AN ADULT.

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:37.009 align:start position:0%
HE'S A GROWNUP.

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:38.244 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH.

00:04:38.277 --> 00:04:40.012 align:start position:0%
HE'S RUN THE CITY FOR 12
YEARS.

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:42.982
I KNOW THERE ARE THINGS HE DID,
YOU MENTIONED THEM ON THE SHOW,

00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:46.519
BUT HE'S DONE GOOD THINGS, AND
HE TRIES TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

00:04:46.552 --> 00:04:50.823
&gt;&gt; Stephen: HE'S PUT HIS MONEY
WHERE HIS MOUTH IS WHEN IT COMES

00:04:50.856 --> 00:04:52.825 align:start position:0%
TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND CERTAINLY
GUN POLICY.

00:04:52.858 --> 00:04:54.026 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES.

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:55.594
&gt;&gt; Stephen: THAT'S CERTAINLY
MORE THAN ANYBODY ELSE, I THINK

00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
THAT'S CERTAINLY A PLUS ON HIS

00:04:58.831 --> 00:04:59.165 align:start position:0%
SIDE.

00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YES, YES.

00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:07.573
SO, YOU KNOW, WE JUST HAVE TO
GET PAST THIS -- GET OVER THE

00:05:07.606 --> 00:05:13.346
HUMP INTO CALM WATERS, AND, SO,
TO ME, BLOOMBERG MIGHT BE THE

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
ONE.

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:18.351 align:start position:0%
( CHEERS AND APPLAUSE )
I LOVE BUTTIGIEG, I LIKE SO MANY

00:05:18.384 --> 00:05:19.719 align:start position:0%
PEOPLE.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:24.924
BUT IT'S A MATTER OF HE'S STILL
YOUNG, HE HAS TIME, BUT WE NEED

00:05:24.957 --> 00:05:26.926 align:start position:0%
TO GET PAST THIS HORRIBLE
SITUATION.

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:29.762 size:84% position:42%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: YEAH, THERE'S A
SENSE OF URGENCY RIGHT NOW.

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:31.297 size:81% position:41%
WE NEED TO RIGHT THE SHIP.

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.298 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:05:32.331 --> 00:05:33.933 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, THE
IRISHMAN, AS I WAS SAYING

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.669 align:start position:0%
BEFORE, IS THE NEW MOVIE, THREE
AND A HALF HOURS.

00:05:36.702 --> 00:05:41.006
I WOULD RECOMMEND MAYBE NOT THE
LARGE DIET COKE BEFORE YOU GO

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.976 align:start position:0%
IN, BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO
MISS A MINUTE, RIGHT?

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.110 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:05:45.144 --> 00:05:49.248 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WELL, THIS IS YOUR
NINTH MOVIE WITH SCORSESE.

00:05:49.281 --> 00:05:52.118 align:start position:0%
DO YOU GUYS HAVE A SHORTHAND
NOW?

00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:54.653 align:start position:0%
WHEN YOU'RE SHOOTING, WHAT'S THE
COLLABORATION LIKE?

00:05:54.686 --> 00:05:55.654 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME.

00:05:55.687 --> 00:05:57.823 align:start position:0%
IT WAS GREAT TO GET BACK TO
WORKING WITH MARTY.

00:05:57.856 --> 00:05:59.392
WE JUST DID WHAT WE ALWAYS DID.

00:05:59.425 --> 00:06:02.828
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE
OF HOW HE MIGHT DIRECT YOU, HOW

00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:04.063 align:start position:0%
YOU MIGHT TAKE A NOTE.

00:06:04.096 --> 00:06:07.333 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; DO THAT LIKE THERE.

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:10.169 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: OKAY.

00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:12.671 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
AND IF YOU'VE GOT AN IDEA, LIKE,

00:06:12.704 --> 00:06:14.173
HOW DO YOU CLEAR IT WITH HIM?

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:19.812
&gt;&gt; I GO (MUMBLING) OVER HERE.

00:06:19.845 --> 00:06:20.513 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: GO AHEAD.

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
GO AHEAD.

00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:22.414 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.

00:06:22.448 --> 00:06:25.985 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: SO CHATTY KATHY
THE WHOLE TIME.

00:06:26.018 --> 00:06:35.761 align:start position:0%
( APPLAUSE )
A LOT WAS MADE TO HA OF THE DEAG

00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:37.029
TECHNOLOGY PUT IN THIS MOVIE.

00:06:37.062 --> 00:06:41.200
HOW DID HE EXPLAIN WHAT THEY
WERE GOING TO DO WHEN HE FIRST

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:42.401 align:start position:0%
CAME TO YOU?

00:06:42.434 --> 00:06:46.605
&gt;&gt; THEY HAD ME TO DO A SCENE
FROM "GOOD FELLAS," AND I GUESS

00:06:46.638 --> 00:06:51.477 align:start position:0%
THEY COMPARED IT AND WORKED ON
THE SCENE THAT I DID, AND

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.378 align:start position:0%
COMPARED THE TWO.

00:06:52.411 --> 00:06:55.915 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: AND DIGITALLY MADE
IT THAT AGE.

00:06:55.948 --> 00:06:57.083 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; EXACTLY.

00:06:57.116 --> 00:07:03.022
I MEAN, THE IDEA WAS ISLAND,
THEY REALLY WANTED TO MAKE IT

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
THE BEST IT COULD BE AT THAT
POINT, AND THAT WAS EXCITING FOR

00:07:07.893 --> 00:07:11.897
US BECAUSE BEFORE THAT WE WERE
THINKING ABOUT WHO WOULD PLAY US

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:12.731 align:start position:0%
YOUNGER AND SO ON.

00:07:12.764 --> 00:07:14.767 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: WHO WOULD PLAY YOU
YOUNGER?

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:15.935 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW.

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:19.138 align:start position:0%
WE WERE NOT QUITE AT THE POINT
OF GETTING TO NAMING ACTUAL

00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:20.172
PEOPLE OR LOOKING FOR PEOPLE.

00:07:20.205 --> 00:07:22.141 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M RIGHT HERE,
BOB.

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:22.942 align:start position:0%
RIGHT HERE.

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:25.077 size:81% position:41%
&gt;&gt; WELL, I THOUGHT OF YOU.

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:27.613 align:start position:0%
( LAUGHTER )
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M BUSY.

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:28.314 align:start position:0%
YOU'RE BUSY.

00:07:28.347 --> 00:07:29.982 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I'M BUSY RIGHT
NOW.

00:07:30.015 --> 00:07:31.183 align:start position:0%
BAD TIMING.

00:07:31.216 --> 00:07:33.619
&gt;&gt; AND THE YEARS WENT BY, AND
WHEN THEY ALL WENT BY, IT MADE

00:07:33.652 --> 00:07:38.624 align:start position:0%
US OLDER, SO WE PROBABLY HAD NO
CHOICE BUT TO TRY TO DEAGE.

00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:45.664
&gt;&gt; Stephen: I.L.M., INDUSTRIAL
LIGHT AND MAGIC, "STAR WARS,"

00:07:45.697 --> 00:07:48.234 align:start position:0%
THEY COULD HAVE MADE YOU A
WOOKIEE.

00:07:48.267 --> 00:07:49.368 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; THEY COULD HAVE.

00:07:49.402 --> 00:07:53.539
&gt;&gt; Stephen: J.J. IS BACKSTAGE
AND STILL READY TO GO AT A

00:07:53.572 --> 00:07:54.406 align:start position:0%
MOMENT'S NOTICE.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:55.040 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; YEAH.
