00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.480
Every year in Hawaii, thousands of
people take to the streets to

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.970
celebrate an unlikely hero Spam.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.100
At Waikiki's Spam Jam Festival, you'll
find Spam curry, Spam corn

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.150
dogs, candy Spam and,
of course, Spam musubi.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.720
Spam musubi is a slice of grilled Spam
on top of a block of rice, all

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.320
wrapped with nori. In Hawaii,
they're everywhere — at convenience

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.000
stores, in kids' lunch boxes and
on the menu at restaurants.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:38.280
I always say Spam and rice are
like made in heaven, because rice is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.980
just plain, and then when you hit
the flavor of the Spam, the

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.750
correlation is really, really good.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.750
Spam is so important in Hawaii that
some say it's even become a form

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.780
of currency, leading some retailers to
keep Spam behind lock and key

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.960
in plastic cases.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.210
In Hawaii, Spam isn't
just a canned meat.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.570
It's a big part of history and
played a role in the island's economy

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.670
as an inexpensive
source of protein.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.850
Spam packs 42 grams of protein into
one 12-ounce can that retails for

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.960
$2.79. But, times have changed, a
lot, since Spam was introduced by

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.730
Hormel Foods in 1937. Changing
consumer tastes and competition from

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.420
new brands has made packaged
food products a competitive market.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.850
Some legacy brands are feeling the
squeeze as consumers pick less

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.970
processed foods.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.690
In this landscape, some packaged food
giants have sold off less

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.390
profitable and usually
older, brands.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.420
Yet Spam stays strong — Hormel
reported that Spam had its fifth

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.300
consecutive year of record sales
in fiscal year 2019.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.150
Consumers know Spam as
a highly processed product.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.370
The shelf life of an unopened can
of Spam is disputed — one

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.890
researcher told us it's indefinite, but
Hormel says its shelf life is

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.880
three years. A can was even found
still intact in the deepest place

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.100
on Earth. So how has Spam
kept growing as consumers look for

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.150
healthier foods?

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.960
First, let's take a look
back at its history.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.610
Hormel Foods Corp.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.850
started out as a meat
processing company in 1891.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.860
It was founded in Austin, Minnesota,
which is still the company's

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.970
headquarters and the site
of the Spam Museum.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.850
In the 1920s and 30s, there were
lots of canned foods available to

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.120
consumers, but not
many canned meats.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.470
Meat was usually purchased, fresh or
cured from the butcher shop.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.490
Hormel was at the mercy of
fluctuating meat prices and seasonal

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.720
production that led to
big worker layoffs.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.230
Company leadership wanted to solve some
of those problems, so Hormel

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.240
started canning meat.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:47.460
Hormel developed the first canned ham in
1926, which was sold by the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.990
slice in butcher shops.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.000
The products were a success, so
successful, in fact, that other

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.560
companies copied Hormel's
canned ham.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.390
So the company wanted to develop
a product that could be sold

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.410
directly to consumers, but making a
smaller version of the canned ham

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.860
presented difficulties.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.530
They called it the "Battle of the
oose juice" and they spent months

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.840
working on it. And finally they figured
out that not only did they

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.830
have to have a vacuum in the can,
but they also had to mix the pork

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.290
shoulder and ham in a vacuum.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.790
And that's what solved the problem.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.550
When it was finally introduced to
consumers in 1937, Spam had five

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:29.050
ingredients: pork with ham, salt,
water, sugar and sodium nitrite.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.310
Hormel's only tweak to the recipe
was to add potato starch, which

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.580
researchers say was to
lessen Span's gelatinous texture.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.220
Right away, consumers embraced Spam as
a lunch and breakfast meat

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.140
eaten at home. The first
year Spam was out, 1937.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.160
there were about 17 percent of
the country was buying it.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.930
And by 1940, 70 percent of
urban Americans were buying Spam.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.250
While it was popular in
the supermarket, Spam really gained

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.890
prominence on the battlefield.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.270
The U.S. military needed a source
of protein that didn't require

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.490
refrigeration. And it found Spam.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.520
Pork luncheon meat was high
on the government's food procurement

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.080
early on because it
was nutritious, filling, affordable.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.670
The canned meat distributed to troops
wasn't always brand name Spam,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.880
but Hormel's product gained a
certain reputation during the war.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.330
Spam became one of the most used
and verbally abused foods of the

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.540
war. Soldiers called it, "Ham that
didn't pass its physical", and

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.090
"The real reason war was hell."

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.170
American soldiers introduced Spam around
the world, delivering it to

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.840
people in war torn
countries facing food shortages.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.220
Hormel shipped up to 15 million cans
of meat per week overseas during

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.310
the war. Many of the countries that
ate Spam during World War 2 still

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.870
eat Spam. Today

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:57.460
the five biggest markets for Spam
are the United States, South Korea,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.430
Australia, the United Kingdom
and Hong Kong.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.930
In some countries like the Philippines
and South Korea, Spam quickly

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.700
became a part of local dishes
like Koreans stew budae jjigae and

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.830
musubi. For generations that lived
through the conflicts, Spam could

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.620
be a painful reminder
of hard times.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.750
Some Japanese Americans were introduced
to Spam in internment camps.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.860
That's where many Japanese
Americans first experienced Spam.

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.660
And after the end of the
war, many continued eating it.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.180
Experts say Spam hasn't played a
big role in Chinese diets

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.770
historically, but Hormel saw a
big business opportunity there.

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.380
China is a relatively new market
for Hormel, which started operations

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.970
there in 2017.

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.110
Spam brand managers say the
growing middle class and existing

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.540
affinity for canned lunch meat made
it a target for business growth.

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.490
In 2017, Hormel opened a plant
in Jiaxing, China, to produce meat

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.090
products, including Spam, primarily
for Chinese consumers.

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.350
And in 2019, Hormel stepped up
advertising there to counter fierce

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.350
competition. We have a lot
of competition in the international

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.210
markets, which is
just mind blowing.

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.020
International sales of Spam
have grown over time.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.750
Analysts say Spam has high
growth potential, especially abroad.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.260
The international business has slowly
and steadily continued to grow.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:19.620
Hormel has added flavors like
Chorizo, Tosino and Portuguese Sausage

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.740
Seasoning to appeal
to international palates.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.820
Today, there are about
16 varieties of Spam.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.130
Hormel says classic less sodium and
light are the top three around

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.940
the world. Part of Spams appeal
with consumers is that it embraces

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.680
its nostalgia. It just hasn't changed all
that much and it's blue and

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.700
yellow can is very recognizable.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.560
We're staying true to the
iconography that we have.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.640
People want and crave this product.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.430
You may have caught a certain CNBC
personality eating Spam on live TV

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.110
straight out of the can.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.620
We certainly haven't forgotten it.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.260
It's sold out in seven
hours, the whole thing.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.990
You can't get it.
Twenty five bucks.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.660
Twenty five bucks on eBay?
And I've got one.

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:06.550
You know what?

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:08.070
It's darn good.

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.470
What? What? They're showing a close
up of you eating it.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:16.560
For many Asian-Americans, especially in Hawaii,
to eat Spam out of

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.620
the can without cooking it
again, is like unheard of.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.940
Why do I want a faux burger?

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.870
How about a delicious tasting thing that
is in the shape of a burger?

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.200
Or David, this, by the way, can be
eaten with pens you don't have to

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.730
wait for fork. This is like
the Food Channel over here.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.680
CNBC's Jim Cramer.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.270
Tried the limited edition Pumpkin Spice
flavor on air, just as the

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:42.090
product was selling out
in grocery stores.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:50.210
It resold online for as much as
$25 a can of 456% markup.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.910
Hormel introduces new flavors of Spam
regularly, and it's now up to

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.620
about 16 varieties.

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:59.590
But as Spam, really
an innovative product?

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:02.570
Isn't part of its appeal that
it's a little bit nostalgic.

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.890
Pumpkin Spice Spam really was more of
a novelty item, but more than

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:11.170
that. It's really about the iconic brand
Spam and the way it connects

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.860
with consumers after over
80 plus years.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:16.910
I mean it's a great
affordable source of protein.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.210
It's very versatile and it's still
on trend with so many consumers

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:24.470
today. What Hormel is doing with
Spam seems to be working.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:29.280
For the 52 weeks ending
November 3rd, 2019, Spam U.S.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.200
sales were $220 million.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.170
While the company doesn't break out
products like Spam every year in

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:39.290
its financial results, we do know
that fiscal year 2019 was Spam's

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.900
fifth consecutive year of
record breaking sales.

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:45.170
For a product that's over 80
years old, that's pretty impressive.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:49.990
Data from U.S. retail sales backs
that up — research firm IRI

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:54.770
estimates that consumers spent over $217
million dollars on Spam in

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:57.650
calendar year 2018 — up 2.8

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.840
percent from 2015.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:02.750
Spam strong international presence has
helped build its domestic

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:05.060
growth as people immigrate
to the United States.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.220
We've seen growth with both the
Asian and Hispanic consumer groups,

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.380
which are some of the fastest
growing consumer groups in the United

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.330
States. Since Hormel doesn't provide
exact annual sales numbers for

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.050
Spam in its financial results,

00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.200
it's hard to say exactly how much
of an impact that canned meat has

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.790
had on the business's bottom line.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.640
But sales from its grocery business,
which includes Spam, have been

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.490
on the rise since
2004, according to FactSet.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.900
In 2018, grocery sales
made up 26.4%

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:35.400
of Hormel's total sales.

00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:39.080
Analysts say that despite making up
a relatively small portion of

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.750
sales, Spam is a great
growth brand for Hormel.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.910
Spam is about 90 percent of the
market share for canned meat in the

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:47.090
U.S., which means it
has little competition.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:48.890
In the domestic business

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:54.790
we estimate that Spam's only about 4
percent of Hormel's sales so not

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:58.510
hugely significant. But the great thing
about Spam, first of all, it

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:03.210
has strong pricing power and part of
the brand's strength and it has

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:04.670
huge international appeal too.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.280
And I think that provides a great
platform for Hormel to expand their

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.620
business internationally.

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.060
Consumers are willing to pay a premium
price for Spam because it has

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.990
strong brand recognition and there just
aren't many other options on

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:21.700
the market. Hormel actually raised the
price of Spam in the U.S.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:25.630
in 2019, but analysts say the
hike didn't impact sales volume.

00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:29.460
And while Spam is an iconic product,
it's just one piece of Hormel's

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:32.520
business. The company is making an
active effort to attract younger

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:36.120
consumers by striking a balance
between legacy brands and on-trend

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:40.280
products. Hormel's management is one of
the strongest teams for the

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.350
packaged food companies.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.910
They do an excellent job
of supporting their brands.

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.620
And it's their strong brands actually
that we think gives them their

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.640
competitive edge.

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.200
Hormel is leaning into other
brands to deliver healthier, trendier

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.510
choices to consumers.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.610
The company recently acquired organic
meat brand Applegate Farms and

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.680
Justin's Nut Butters.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.080
And, what about the
plant based meat trend?

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:05.090
It's one of the biggest fads
of 2019 with both consumers and

00:11:05.090 --> 00:11:08.780
investors. But Hormel didn't have a
plant-based meat line of consumer

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:10.090
products until September 2019.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:13.670
I mean, everybody knows what's
happening with plant based proteins.

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:15.210
That was a trend
that we saw coming.

00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:18.000
We had actually partnered
with another company.

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:22.640
And then when the IPO market hit,
that partner said, you know, we

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.710
want to try and go it alone.

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:25.320
Instead of buying, we had to build.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.390
Hormel launched Happy Little Plants,
which sells plant-based ground

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:33.760
meat in 2019. The company also
sells blended burgers, which contain

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:35.900
both animal and
plant based protein.

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.010
So what about a meat-free Spam?

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:41.680
We always continue to evaluate and want
to understand is this a trend

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:45.360
that will work? It would have to be
the right fit for us in order to

00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.520
go down that route.

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:50.340
But we're always constantly looking
for new flavor varieties and

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:52.550
trends that we might want
to incorporate with the brand.

00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:55.630
There's no indication that Hormel will
produce the plant based Spam

00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:59.350
but experts don't think the rise of
plant based meat poses a threat

00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.970
to Spam. As these sort of
healthy or food trends grow.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.270
I think there will always be a
portion of the population who is

00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:09.210
trying to go against that grain.

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.310
As more people want to eat healthy.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:14.580
You have just as many people who
says, screw it, I'm going to eat

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.170
Spam. Despite the meatless meat trend,
Spam sales are stronger than

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:23.900
ever. Have you noticed more
Hawaiian and poke bowl restaurants

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:25.160
popping up in your neighborhood?

00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:27.320
It's not just a coincidence.

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.590
Hawaiian restaurants are the fastest
growing category of restaurant

00:12:30.650 --> 00:12:34.460
in the U.S., according to Firefly,
a database of restaurant operator

00:12:34.460 --> 00:12:38.670
profiles. Since Spam is an essential
part of Hawaiian cuisine, the

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:42.240
growing popularity of Hawaiian restaurants
is also lifting Spam's

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.160
profile. In Hawaii, Spam is 10 times
more likely to be on a

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:48.740
restaurant menu than it is in
any other metro or state.

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:53.550
This broader exposure that consumers
have today to Hawaiian cuisine

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:56.500
is also generating more
interest in Spam.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.700
So maybe you don't necessarily try it
on every visit to a Hawaiian

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.010
restaurant. But you're seeing
it on more menus.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:06.710
Despite the growth of Hawaiian restaurants,
it's still pretty rare to

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:10.110
see Spam on a menu. It's on
just point seven percent of restaurant

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:14.150
menus in the U.S. Compare that
to hot dogs another processed meat.

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.530
They're on about fifteen percent
of menus in the U.S.,

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:21.520
but the number of menu Spam is
on has increased in recent years.

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:26.110
kitschyWhile it's not on a ton
of restaurant menus today, it's long

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:29.790
like one percent of menus
across the restaurant industry.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.730
It's unique in that compared to
other processed meat products, it's

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.070
experiencing growth and it's also
projected to continue to grow.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.990
Younger consumers are driving Spams
growth, despite Gen Z's

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:44.040
preference for organic
and natural foods.

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:48.630
Compared to millennials a decade ago, 18
to 24 year olds are more

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:51.790
likely to shop for foods without additives
and are more likely to be

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:55.270
vegetarian. But they also prefer meals
that are convenient and easy

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:56.900
to prepare. Just like Spam.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.820
Spam had a time in the sun decades
ago and then it maybe skipped a

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.050
couple generations.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.010
And then now today's teenagers also are
saying they love it and it's

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.030
something they want to see
and include in their diet.

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:14.100
Celebrity chefs and the impact of
Instagram on eating out may have

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.130
something to do with it, too.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.940
In the past 10 years, Korean
American and Filipino American chefs

00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.080
really have come
into the spotlight.

00:14:22.330 --> 00:14:27.340
They take in what was seen as by
Americans as kitchy and made it into

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:29.870
something like culinary legitimate.

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:33.690
Whether you love it or hate it,
there's no denying that Spam's had a

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.010
big impact on culture.

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.410
It's a product
that won't disappear.

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.010
Not even a World War
could turn consumers against it.

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:43.380
And while experts say some generations
fell out of love with Spam,

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.590
changing demographics and foodie culture
has brought it back.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.980
So just how far can this 80-year-old
brand grow with its vast and

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:52.290
diverse group of consumers?

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.040
Hormel says pretty far.
