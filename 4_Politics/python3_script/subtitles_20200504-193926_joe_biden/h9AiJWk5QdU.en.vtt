00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.920
This is one of the world's most famous photographs.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:09.420
It's commonly known as Migrant Mother, and
it was taken by Dorothea Lange in 1936, during

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.000
the Great Depression.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.200
In the U.S. Library of Congress, the photograph
is labeled as, "Destitute Pea Pickers in California."

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.660
And there are two stories here--the story
of the photograph, which has been famous since

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.789
1936, and the story of its subject, who was
as it turns not a pea picker, and whose identity

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.290
wasn’t known until the late 1970s.

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.829
But let's begin with the photograph, which
was printed in newspapers in 1936 and helped

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.160
spur a relief movement that saved many people
from starvation.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.500
Since then, it's become one of the most reproduced
images in history--it's been on a postage

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.030
stamp, t-shirts, magazine covers.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.280
The picture is ubiquitous partly because it
isn't copyrighted-- it was taken as part of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.489
Lange's work with the Farm Security Administration
so it’s in the public domain, meaning that

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.860
anyone can re-create it for any reason without
paying royalties--hence the existence of,

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.490
for example, the 1000-piece Migrant Mother
jigsaw puzzle.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.790
But lots of Depression-era images are in the
public domain.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.700
This one has stuck with us because it is,
you know, brilliant.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.450
The mother's worried eyes.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.390
The kids turned away from us.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.090
The rough textures of their clothes contrasted
with human skin.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.400
It takes a moment even to notice the swaddled
baby, and for me at least, that's when the

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.799
real weight of the picture hits--three kids,
literally leaning on their mom, and her eyes

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.080
are carrying all that weight.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.690
Lange took six other photographs of the mom
and her children on that day, which give us

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.320
a small sense of what the area outside the
famous photograph looked like on March 6th, 1936.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.540
The migrant mother and her kids were just
outside of a pea-pickers camp.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.560
Many years later, in 1960, Lange wrote about
this moment in Popular Photography magazine:

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.090
I saw and approached the hungry and desperate
mother, as if drawn by a magnet.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.369
I do not remember how I explained my presence
or my camera to her, but I do remember she

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.469
asked me no questions...

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.040
I did not ask her name or her history.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.510
She told me her age, that she was thirty-two.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.819
She said that they had been living on frozen
vegetables from the surrounding fields, and

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.950
birds that the children killed.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.720
She had just sold the tires from her car to
buy food.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.370
There she sat in that lean-to tent with her
children huddled around her, and seemed to

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.049
know that my pictures might help her, and
so she helped me.

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:38.580
There was a sort of equality about it.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.620
But Florence Owens Thompson, the woman depicted
in the photograph, did not feel there was

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.099
a sort of equality about it, and remembered
the encounter quite differently.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.270
When Thompson was identified more than
40 years after the picture was taken, she

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.409
told a newspaper reporter, “I wish she hadn’t
taken my picture.”

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.650
The photograph became a symbol of the Depression
in the United States and the suffering it

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.859
caused, especially among farm workers.

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:10.389
A single image that could represent something
deep about motherhood and resilience and poverty

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:11.940
and desperation.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.080
But the photograph's symbolic resonance is
very distant from the lived experience of

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.650
the people captured in that picture.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.290
The migrant mother was not, as the photo's
caption identified her, a "destitute pea-picker."

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.489
Florence Leona Christie was born in 1903.

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.829
She was a native American, born to Cherokee
parents in what was at the time called Indian

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.760
Territory--it wouldn't become the state of
Oklahoma until 1907.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.229
The life she lived has a lot to tell us about
the United States and 20th century history

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:48.080
and also a lot to tell us about motherhood.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.559
She was 17 when she married a 23-year-old
farmer named Cleo Owens in 1921.

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:58.189
And over the next ten years, they would move
to California and have five children together,

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.519
three girls and two boys.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:07.840
Florence was pregnant with their sixth child,
Katherine, when Cleo died in 1931 of tuberculosis.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.510
As a single mother with six children, Florence
often worked two jobs—picking cotton or

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.320
doing other farmwork during the day and then
working at restaurants in the evening—to

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.659
support her family.

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.970
Her children recall her as a loving and devoted
mother.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.620
Her daughter Ruby told a reporter, “If she
could have gave us all these material things,

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.000
maybe she would have, but that I don’t think
would have replaced what she did give us.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.720
She gave us a sense of worth that nobody owes us anything.”

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.810
Katherine recalled, “She didn’t eat sometimes,
but she made sure us children ate.”

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.569
By the day the famous picture was taken 1936,
Florence had remarried—to a man named Jim

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.159
Hill—and had another baby, Norma Lee.

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:53.289
The family was always on the move, driving
their Hudson sedan from farm job to farm job.

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.510
They were on their way to the lettuce fields
of California’s Pajaro Valley when the Hudson’s

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.950
timing belt snapped.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.770
They stopped just outside of the pea-pickers’
camp, and Jim and two of the older kids walked

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.330
to a nearby town to get a new timing belt.

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.289
Meanwhile, Florence set up a lean-to to and
cooked food for her kids.

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.510
So according to the family, they had not been
living on frozen vegetables from the fields,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.900
nor had they sold their tires for food.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.110
Florence’s son Troy would later say, “There’s
no way we sold our tires, because we didn’t

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.590
have any to sell.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.389
The only ones we had were on the Hudson and
we drove off in them.

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.240
I don’t believe Lange was lying; I just
think she had one story mixed up with another.”

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.870
And this is important to understand, because
while Florence and her family were extremely

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.410
poor, they were better-off than most of the
actual “destitute pea-pickers” who were

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:46.160
living in the camp at the time.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.430
Florence would later recall that while she
cooked for her children that day, other kids

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.070
came over from the camp and asked if they
could have a bite or two.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:58.580
Many of the pea pickers in the camp were Mexican
Americans, and because of their ethnicity

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.770
they were at constant risk of deportation
as part of the so-called “Mexican Repatriation.”

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.320
During the Depression Era, over a million
Mexican Americans—most of whom were U.S.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.469
citizens—were deported without due process.

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:16.840
Lange photographed some of these people in
Nipomo’s pea-pickers camp as well, but it

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.620
was Florence and her children who captured
the public’s imagination; within a few days

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.570
of the picture’s first publication, 20,000
pounds of food aid was delivered to the pea

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.919
picker’s camp, but by then Florence and
her family had moved on to the lettuce fields.

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:36.939
Florence would continue to find seasonal work
until after World War II, when she at last

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:39.710
found a measure of economic stability.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.740
Recalling her career late in life, she said,
“I worked in hospitals.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.420
I tended bar.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:48.190
I cooked.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:52.280
I worked in the fields.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:56.159
I done a little bit of everything to make
a living for my kids.”

00:06:56.159 --> 00:07:00.659
She would eventually have eleven children,
and in the 1970s, they would pitch in to buy

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:05.960
Florence a house in Modesto, California, but
Florence decided she preferred living in a

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.680
mobile home, and moved back into one.

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:13.669
In 1983, when Florence was 80, her children
made a public appeal for help with Florence’s

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:14.669
medical costs.

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:19.780
She’d had a stroke, and had no savings - a
reminder that the uniquely American phenomenon

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:22.240
of medical fundraisers is nothing new.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.310
The appeal raises $35,000, and more than 2,000
people wrote to Florence Owens Thompson.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.810
Her family read her the letters in the hospital,
where she died a few weeks later.

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.680
Florence and her family had a complicated
relationship with the picture.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:42.820
Norma, the baby in the photograph, said, “When I look at that photo of mother, it saddens me.

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:44.780
That’s not how I like to remember her.”

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.669
It’s true, the kids acknowledge, that they
grew up desperately poor.

00:07:48.669 --> 00:07:53.960
They had no toys, picked cotton from a young
age, and because they were so often working

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.820
had very few educational opportunities.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:03.180
But that is not the whole story, any more
than a single photograph is a whole life.

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.409
Florence loved music, her children want us
to know.

00:08:06.409 --> 00:08:08.270
She was a great storyteller.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:13.370
She had a dog named Montana Slim, and volunteered
as a union organizer.

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:17.949
But they also resist attempts to romanticize
poverty or their mother.

00:08:17.949 --> 00:08:23.370
In 1992, when an interviewer asked, “When
you think about the good things of that period,

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:24.680
what comes to mind?”

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.420
Florence’s daughter Katherine, replied,
“I don’t have no good memories of that period.

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.480
None whatsoever.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.500
Maybe that's why I blocked most of it out of my mind.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:40.640
And it was hard for the family to accept that Lange became famous for the photograph while its subjects

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:43.660
continued to struggle so desperately.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:49.180
As Katherine put it, “That photo never gave
mother or us kids any relief.”

00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:54.731
But at the end of Florence’s life when the
notes poured in from around the country, their

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:57.550
family began to reconsider Migrant Mother.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:01.660
Now we knew the picture was important. You know we'd been contacted by different people.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.240
And we'd seen it in different magazines. Life Magazine. And newspapers periodically.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.620
I something came up.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.380
But we never really knew how my mom affected the nation.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:16.260
One donor to the medical fund wrote, “The
famous picture of your mother for years gave

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:22.810
me great strength, pride, and dignity--only
because she exuded those qualities.”

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:27.790
And as the letters flooded in, Florence’s
children, one of whom had described the picture

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:31.820
as a “curse,” began to see it as something
more than that.

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.720
Florence Owens Thompson didn’t want to be the face of American poverty.

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:41.260
But I don’t think in the end it is a picture
of mere poverty.

00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:45.400
There were many migrant mothers photographed
during the Depression by the Farm Security

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:50.500
Administration’s photographers, including
many taken by Dorothea Lange.

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:56.269
What makes this one special is not that its
subject is especially pitiful, but instead

00:09:56.269 --> 00:10:00.080
its subject’s manifest strength and dignity.

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:06.160
It is a picture of a mother’s fear and a
mother’s exhaustion, sure, but also of a

00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:09.070
mother’s love and determination.

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.880
And so the curse did eventually became a source
of pride.

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:18.639
Florence’s kids had her tombstone inscribed,
“Migrant Mother: A Legend of the Strength

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:20.550
of American Motherhood.”

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:26.400
And that seems a brilliant summation of the
relationship between the famous picture and

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.920
its long-unknown subject.

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.340
Florence Owens Thompson became a legend of
the strength of motherhood and to so many

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:40.880
people then, and to many more today, she is
the embodiment of that legend.

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.600
But to her eleven children, she was much more.

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:51.540
She was funny, strict, stuck in her ways,
loving, hard-working, and supportive.

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:54.680
In short, to them, she wasn’t a legend.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.320
She was their mom.
