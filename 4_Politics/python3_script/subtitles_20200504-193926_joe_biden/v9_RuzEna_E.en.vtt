00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:04.930
&gt;&gt; DINESH D'SOUZA: Thank you very much.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.930
Wow, this is amazing.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:17.800
I want to congratulate you, not just on Liberty's
athletic victories, but also on being one

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.900
of the few remaining open-minded colleges
in America.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:42.770
I mean, imagine the prospect of a Bernie Sanders
or a Jesse Jackson speaking at Liberty.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.350
We don't actually have to imagine these things
because they have happened, and the reception

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:56.100
you gave them was cordial, respectful, intellectual,
civil.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:03.230
And contrast this with the reception accorded
conservative speakers on the left-wing campus.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.070
It's totally the opposite.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.140
I'm very excited to be here talking about
some themes in my new book called The Big

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.100
Lie.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.520
In the interest of full disclosure, I should
tell you that if you're choosing among books,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.330
Hillary has a new book out.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.320
It's called, What Happened.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.740
What Happened?

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:32.110
Now I've recently learned that due to an inexcusable
and astounding mistake, the titles of our

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.610
two books became interchanged.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:44.170
Hers actually should have been The Big Lie.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:59.600
Now, I think you know that we're living through
a very extraordinary political moment in American

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.909
History.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:11.380
Even as we speak, left-wing thugs are rampaging
through the south, pulling down Confederate

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:12.380
monuments.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.040
Now, when I first saw this sight...

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.870
And let's be clear about what this sight is.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:25.230
This is Democrats knocking down the statues
of other Democrats.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:35.730
So, at the first glance, I thought to myself,
maybe the Democratic Party is coming to a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:47.100
moment of true self-recognition, true honesty,
true willingness to account for its own past.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.950
Maybe the Democrats, for the first time in
all their history, are saying, yes, we did

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:52.950
it.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:02.069
We are the party of slavery, of segregation,
of Jim Crow, of the Klu Klux Klan, of racial

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.120
terrorism.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.210
We are the party that attempted to block the
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the voting rights

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.660
act of 1965.&nbsp;

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.349
And we are not just so thoroughly ashamed
of our own history, that we have to take down

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:28.700
these terrible reminders that we keep seeing
in the form of statues of who we are.&nbsp;

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:35.170
But of course, I realized that is not what
is going on right now.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.500
What is actually going on is something more
like the big lie.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.239
And the big lie is the effort on the part
of the Democrats to take the things that they

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:55.350
did and to project the blame and the responsibility
onto someone else.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.760
They want to blame the white man.

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.230
They want to blame America.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.390
They want to blame the South.

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:09.959
Now, to be honest, the secession debate of
1860 was between the North and the South.

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.680
But the slavery debate, which had been going
on for much longer,&nbsp;

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.900
the slavery debate was not a North South debate.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:24.580
It was actually between the pro-slavery Democratic
party, North and South, and the anti-slavery

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.449
Republican Party.

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:33.039
In my last movie, Hillary's America, I made
the observation that in 1860, the year before

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:38.919
the Civil War, no Republican owned a slave.

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:45.190
All the slaves in the United States, four
million of them, were owned by Democrats.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:46.499
Think about that.

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:52.050
Since then, in the last year, the left has
been thrashing around to find a single counter

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.589
example to undermine my Thesis.

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:59.259
And all they'd have to do is give me a list
of five Republicans who owned slaves, and

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:00.770
I'd have to take it back.

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.449
But they can't do it.

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.770
After intense labors, one Democratic Ph.D.
student said, I found an example.

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.080
I found an example.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.469
Ulysses S. Grant inherited a slave on his
wife's side.

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:17.990
And I said, that's true.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:24.389
But at the time that happened, Ulysses S.
Grant was a Democrat.

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:30.779
So even the single counter example doesn't
really work.

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:37.569
Now, since Trump's election, you might have
noticed that the big story—

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:43.409
I call it the meta-story of American politics—
has shifted.

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:51.219
And the left has moved from playing the race
card to now also playing the fascism card,

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:52.840
the fascism card.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.129
“Trump is a fascist.”

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:01.009
“The Republicans, the conservatives, the
Christians, these are the neo-Nazis of our

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:02.110
time.”

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.979
Now, why does the left say this?

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.409
What's the point of making these kinds of
accusations?

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:16.599
It's not just intended as an insult;
it's intended to be a legitimization, a justification

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:24.129
for all kinds of extreme behavior that would
otherwise be inexcusable.

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:30.529
Ever since Trump's election, we've been seeing
all kinds of craziness from the left.

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:36.990
Let's convince the electors not to vote for
the candidate that they're pledged to.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.629
Mainstream Democrats refusing to attend the
inauguration.&nbsp;

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.689
Let's disrupt the inauguration.&nbsp;

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:51.659
Let's go on the campuses, dress up in masks,
carry baseball bats, and bike locks, and beat

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:57.020
up conservative speakers who show up to try
to offer a very rarely offered alternative

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.119
point of view.

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:02.599
Now, how can you condone this kind of madness?&nbsp;

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:09.240
Well, the left's answer is, “we condone
it, because it's like we are fighting Hitler

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.580
in the 1930s.”&nbsp;

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:19.889
If Trump is a fascist, we have every justification
to use every means necessary to get rid of

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:21.409
him.

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:29.429
Even if we stage a quasi-coup, it's warranted,&nbsp;
because anything would've been warranted to

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:36.389
get Hitler out of there before he could go
on to cause all the carnage that he did.

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:44.179
Now this notion that fascism and Nazism are
phenomena of the right—they are somehow

00:07:44.179 --> 00:07:47.879
right-winged—this notion long predates Trump.

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:56.229
It actually goes back to World War II when,
in a sense, the big lie was concocted.

00:07:56.229 --> 00:07:58.060
It was manufactured.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.679
Now why do I call it a big lie?

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:04.039
The term ‘the big lie’ was actually used
by Adolf Hitler.

00:08:04.039 --> 00:08:10.810
And Hitler made the point that small lies
are actually kind of easy to catch.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:17.150
The trouble in Benghazi was due to a video—small
lie, easy to catch.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:23.110
If you wanted to “keep your doctor, you
can keep your doctor”—small lie, easy

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.240
to catch.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:32.789
But big lies, Hitler says, are more sneaky
because they're so large you can't get your

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:34.300
head around them.

00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:43.250
And so, it's actually easier to pedal a big
lie than it is to pedal a small lie.&nbsp;

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:48.540
And the big lie is the lie that fascism and
Nazism are somehow right-wing.&nbsp;

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.430
In reality, the opposite is the truth.&nbsp;

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:58.790
The founder of fascism is not Hitler;&nbsp;
it's Mussolini who established the first fascist

00:08:58.790 --> 00:09:01.130
regime in the world.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:07.470
When Mussolini established the fascist party,
he received a telegram of congratulations

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.579
from Lenin.

00:09:09.579 --> 00:09:11.149
Why?&nbsp;

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:14.890
Because Mussolini was the most famous Marxist
in Italy.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:21.810
Lenin recognized Mussolini as a fellow revolutionary
on the left.&nbsp;

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:27.589
Hitler's part was officially called the National
Socialist Party.

00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:34.019
And, you know, I was watching a little bit
of the Emmy's last night, and I was thinking

00:09:34.019 --> 00:09:35.069
that...&nbsp;

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:40.449
Some of you may have seen on social media,
Stephen Colbert did his infamous Nazi salute.

00:09:40.449 --> 00:09:46.860
He was trying to actually describe Trump,
but here we saw at the Emmys, literally it's

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.970
Stephen Colbert...&nbsp;

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:53.209
Well, first of all, if he did his Nazi salute,
his ratings might have been a little better,&nbsp;

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:59.800
but if he literally opened the Nazi 25-point
platform and began to read from it—

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:06.140
nationalization of industry, universal healthcare,
let's go after the greedy, swindling bankers

00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:10.579
and so on, and so on, and so on—
he literally would've gotten thunderous applause

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:13.370
from the audience.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:21.170
In other words, what I'm saying is, the platform
of the Nazi party was manifestly left-wing.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:29.319
And, historically in America, the left recognized
the Nazi, recognized the Italian fascists

00:10:29.319 --> 00:10:31.399
as kindred spirits.

00:10:31.399 --> 00:10:40.310
Hitler, in fact, got some of his most maniacal
and destructive ideas from the American left.

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:43.519
I'm not saying that there were similar things
going on.&nbsp;

00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:49.560
I'm saying Hitler literally lifted it the
blueprints from the example supplied by the

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.260
Democrats and by the left.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.149
To take a single example...

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:58.300
This is, I would call it, the Hitler-Margaret
Sanger connection.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:03.470
Today, if you pick up a brochure of Planned
Parenthood and you thumb through it, you get

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:11.120
the idea that Margaret Sanger, the founder
of the organization was a champion of choice.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:17.829
She wanted every woman to decide whether and
how many offspring to have.

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:22.829
When you read this, your kind of big lie antenna
should be going off, because the real Margaret

00:11:22.829 --> 00:11:24.600
Sanger wasn't like this at all.&nbsp;

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:27.970
The real Margaret Sanger opposed choice.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:32.120
A slogan that she had which was published
in her magazine Birth Control review:&nbsp;

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:37.940
"More children from the fit, fewer children
from the unfit.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:41.130
This is the chief aim of birth control."

00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.480
So, Margaret Sanger's view is that if you
are unfit—

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:50.529
unfit, of course, in her view—
then you should be prevented from reproducing

00:11:50.529 --> 00:11:51.680
at all.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:59.139
No kids, ideally by persuasion, but if you
refuse, by force.

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:04.569
And the progressive eugenicists in America,
the gang around Margaret Sanger, had basically

00:12:04.569 --> 00:12:10.680
two approaches to achieving this goal, the
goal of preventing the unfit from reproducing.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.550
The first was forced sterilization.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.819
This was the one that Margaret Sanger supported.

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:23.699
The other one was euthanasia, which basically
referred to killing off people who were seen

00:12:23.699 --> 00:12:28.800
as sick, disabled, old, and so on.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.529
Now, amazingly, the Nazis got wind of this.&nbsp;

00:12:32.529 --> 00:12:37.199
Through international conferences, they learned
what the American progressives were proposing.&nbsp;

00:12:37.199 --> 00:12:43.389
It was a California progressive Paul Popenoe
who said, listen, if we're going to have euthanasia,

00:12:43.389 --> 00:12:45.939
we can't kill people one at a time.

00:12:45.939 --> 00:12:48.899
We need to have a more systematic way of doing
it.

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:53.689
And he proposed, quote, "lethal chambers to
carry this out."

00:12:53.689 --> 00:12:58.040
And what I'm saying is that the Nazi's go,
“what the Americans are proposing, it's

00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.040
fantastic.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:00.470
We're going to run with it.”

00:13:00.470 --> 00:13:07.639
The Nazi sterilization laws of 1933 and the
Nazi euthanasia laws of 1935, which were,

00:13:07.639 --> 00:13:10.230
in fact, the first gas chambers.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:17.050
The Nazis used poisonous gas, carbon monoxide
gas, to kill, initially, not Jews, but the

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:21.060
sick, the disabled, what Hitler called imbeciles,
and so on.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:28.930
So, what I'm saying is that the Nazis adopted,
almost wholesale, the blueprints applied by

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:37.060
Margaret Sanger and her American progressive
buddies in the eugenics movement.

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.149
Now, I've been speaking about fascism.

00:13:40.149 --> 00:13:42.440
I've been speaking about Nazism.&nbsp;

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:47.380
It's worth taking a second to ask the question,
what is fascism?

00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:50.080
What does it actually mean?

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:55.550
Because if you knew the meaning of fascism
and Nazism, you could then decide better,

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:57.070
does it belong on the left?&nbsp;

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.930
Or does it belong on the right?

00:13:58.930 --> 00:14:06.399
Now, the very term fascism comes from a bundle
of sticks held together so tightly, bound

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:10.610
together so compactly, that they can't fall
apart.

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:17.600
And the fascist idea was that societies are
stronger collectively than they are individually.&nbsp;

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:24.120
It's easier to break one stick at a time than
to break a whole bunch of sticks put together.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:33.490
Fascism, as Mussolini defined it, is everything
in the state, and nothing outside the state.

00:14:33.490 --> 00:14:41.670
So, what this means, is that the state, the
government, is kind of like a living organism.

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:48.600
And each of us individuals, we are like cells
within the organism.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.110
Our individual value is basically zero.

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:55.689
Individual rights are nonexistent.&nbsp;

00:14:55.689 --> 00:15:04.860
Our importance as individuals, as cells, is
solely the degree to which we serve the collective,

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:05.970
the state.

00:15:05.970 --> 00:15:13.959
So, I ask you, does this actually sound more
like the platform of the Republican Party,

00:15:13.959 --> 00:15:18.290
or more like the platform of the Democratic
party?

00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:21.309
Fascism has always been on the left.

00:15:21.309 --> 00:15:23.730
FDR knew this.&nbsp;

00:15:23.730 --> 00:15:31.480
President Roosevelt, in the New Deal, sent
members of his brain trust to fascist Italy,

00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:35.459
because he saw fascism as more progressive
than the New Deal.

00:15:35.459 --> 00:15:43.420
He wanted his best thinkers to study fascism
to bring some of those ideas to America.

00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:47.309
He admired Mussolini as a fellow leftist,
and Mussolini.&nbsp;

00:15:47.309 --> 00:15:49.329
And Mussolini, for his part, revered FDR.

00:15:49.329 --> 00:15:53.480
It was a mutual admiration society.

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:59.749
Mussolini reviews FDR’s book in a magazine,
and a summarize his review in this way:

00:15:59.749 --> 00:16:01.389
“Great guy.

00:16:01.389 --> 00:16:02.819
He's one us.

00:16:02.819 --> 00:16:04.579
He's a fascist.”

00:16:04.579 --> 00:16:07.839
He's a fascist.

00:16:07.839 --> 00:16:17.959
Now, interestingly, after World War II, when
fascism and Nazism became irreparably stained

00:16:17.959 --> 00:16:23.639
by the reputation of the Holocaust—&nbsp;
when American troops went into the concentration

00:16:23.639 --> 00:16:31.759
camps and out came those ghostly, emaciated
figures—

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:41.569
suddenly fascism and Nazism became permanently
dirty words, incendiary words, symbols of

00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:42.699
horror.

00:16:42.699 --> 00:16:49.790
And the progressives in America, who were
then just starting to come to power in academia,

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:56.009
in the media, in Hollywood, they actually
knew that fascism and Nazism were on the left.

00:16:56.009 --> 00:17:02.750
They knew about the deep connections between
the Democrats and the fascists.

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:08.779
They knew, for example, that the Nuremberg
Laws—in which Hitler essentially made Jews

00:17:08.779 --> 00:17:14.839
into second class citizens, prohibiting them
from intermarrying with other Germans, confiscated

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:20.730
Jewish property, had state segregation against
Jews segregating them into ghettos.&nbsp;

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:27.880
These laws, by the way, were directly lifted
from the Democratic laws of the Jim Crow South.&nbsp;

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.440
Again, I'm not saying that they were parallel
or similar.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.950
I'm saying that the leading Nazis who drafted
the Nuremberg Laws had in their hands the

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:39.110
Democratic laws from America.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:44.809
By the way, I should point out every segregation
law in the American South was passed by a

00:17:44.809 --> 00:17:48.429
Democratic legislature, signed by a Democratic
governor.&nbsp;

00:17:48.429 --> 00:17:50.690
There is no exception to this rule.

00:17:50.690 --> 00:17:57.070
So, these are not American laws;&nbsp;
these are Democratic laws.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:03.080
But after the way, as I said, the progressives
realized how damning and deep their association

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.770
was with fascism.

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:08.140
And so, they decided, we've got to cover it
up.

00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:12.900
“All this stuff that Dinesh is talking about,
we've got to make sure that all that stuff

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.940
is left out of the textbooks.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.279
We don't want young people finding out about
it.”

00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:18.279
Why?

00:18:18.279 --> 00:18:21.270
Because if they did, they'd never want to
be a Democrat.

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.740
They'd never want to be a progressive.

00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:30.820
And, most cunning of all, we have to take
fascism and Nazism from the left-wing column,

00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:36.770
where they've always belonged,
and we've got to move it over into the right-wing

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:37.770
column.

00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:41.169
Now, this is easier said than done.

00:18:41.169 --> 00:18:44.909
In other words, big lies are not that easy
to pull off.

00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:52.919
How do you get intelligent people, not dummies,
intelligent people to know something that

00:18:52.919 --> 00:18:54.710
isn't true?&nbsp;

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.770
How do you achieve that?

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:03.270
Well, first of all, it really helps when you
dominate the three megaphones of our culture

00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:08.450
which is academia, the media, and the whole
entertainment industry—not just Hollywood,

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.480
but Broadway, the music industry, the comedians.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.720
If you have all that, you can put out a lot
of big lies.

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.120
Why?

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.399
Because even if some guy in the audience knows
it's a big lie, they don't have a big enough

00:19:20.399 --> 00:19:21.850
megaphone to contest it.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:24.780
So, that's one way you pull off big lies.

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:30.399
You kind of own the bull horns to promulgate
them.

00:19:30.399 --> 00:19:37.270
The other way you pull off big lies is you
have to be, intellectually, very crafty.

00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:41.890
And one thing we can say about the left is
it is crafty.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:47.130
And so, in moving fascism and Nazism from
the left-wing column to the right-wing column,

00:19:47.130 --> 00:19:51.970
they realized we can't go around saying that
fascism is the philosophy of the centralized

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:52.970
state.

00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:54.620
Everyone's going to look at us.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.919
We've got to strip the socialism out of national
socialism.

00:19:59.919 --> 00:20:03.850
We've got to sort of redefine fascism and
make...&nbsp;

00:20:03.850 --> 00:20:05.480
People talk about fake media.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.880
We need fake scholarship.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:12.700
We need to create a fictional fascism, and
take that fictional fascism and pin that fascist

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.210
tail on the Republican elephant.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.670
And so, the left came up with this idea.

00:20:18.670 --> 00:20:23.020
“Let's redefine fascism so fascism is not
centralized government, which it's always

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.149
been.

00:20:24.149 --> 00:20:29.860
Let's just say fascism is ultra-nationalism.”

00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.860
Ultra-nationalism.

00:20:30.860 --> 00:20:33.420
So, here's Trump:
“I want to make America great again!”

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.270
Hey, that sounds a lot like Hitler.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:39.450
Didn't he want to make Germany great again?

00:20:39.450 --> 00:20:46.570
Now, in order to dissect this big lie and
expose it, you've got to realize that nationalism

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.960
is, in fact, not essential to fascism at all.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:54.429
In fact, nationalism is not exclusively on
the right.&nbsp;

00:20:54.429 --> 00:20:57.880
There are plenty of nationalists on the right.&nbsp;

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.720
I'm originally from India.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:05.240
Gandhi, the founder of modern India, was a
nationalist.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.769
Mandela in South Africa was a nationalist.

00:21:08.769 --> 00:21:12.860
All the anticolonial leaders were nationalists.

00:21:12.860 --> 00:21:15.940
Winston Churchill was a nationalist.&nbsp;

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:20.040
Abraham Lincoln, the American founders, all
nationalists.

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:26.580
Now, does it make any sense to call these
people all fascists?

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.279
No.

00:21:28.279 --> 00:21:34.779
So here we begin our task of unmasking the
big lie.&nbsp;

00:21:34.779 --> 00:21:42.000
Unmasking the big lie by showing that this
effort to pin fascism on the right is an intellectual

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.750
fraud of mammoth proportions, mammoth proportions.

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:51.970
And you might say, well, Dinesh, this may
all be true, but you're talking a little bit

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:54.610
in a historical vein.

00:21:54.610 --> 00:21:55.950
What about now?

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:56.950
What about now?

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:06.130
So, I want to point out that now, today, the
party that reflects not only fascist history—

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.290
we've talked about that.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:15.640
Not only fascist ideology, the centralized
state, but even fascist economics and fascist

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.909
tactics, that is coming today exclusively
from the left.

00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:23.480
And let me show why.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.140
The essential economic meaning of fascism—if
you literally just Google it, look up the

00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:32.730
definition, you'll see—is state-directed
capitalism.&nbsp;

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.120
That's the meaning of fascism.

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:39.750
Now, interestingly, if we look at the Democratic
Party now, it doesn't advocate socialism of

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:44.800
the Marxist type, because true socialist governments
do what?

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:45.800
They nationalize industry.

00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.059
The government takes over the industry.

00:22:48.059 --> 00:22:50.610
The government will take over energy or banking.

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:54.230
And the government itself will administer
those industries.

00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:58.049
That's Marxian socialism.

00:22:58.049 --> 00:23:00.230
We don't have that.

00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:05.019
Obama care, for example, in Obama care we
have private hospitals.

00:23:05.019 --> 00:23:11.530
We have private insurance companies, but the
state tells them what to do.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.420
The state sets the prices.

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:17.080
The state tells them who's eligible for insurance
or for healthcare.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.799
The state denies this procedure or that procedure.

00:23:19.799 --> 00:23:25.200
In other words, state-directed capitalism.

00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:31.610
Under Obama, we have seen the state-direction
of all kinds of industries that were previously

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.620
largely private.

00:23:33.620 --> 00:23:37.650
The state takes over the banks, tells them
what to do.

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:40.830
Takes over the investment firms, tells them
what to do.

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:42.750
Takes over, increasingly, the energy sector.

00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:45.220
We mentioned the health sector.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.470
Hillary and Bernie wanted to do this to education.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:54.730
So, this, what I'm saying, is this state-directed
capitalism in which you have private actors,

00:23:54.730 --> 00:24:01.399
but the state is, in a sense, quarterbacking
them, this is the classic and clinical definition

00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:06.860
of fascism in an economic sense.

00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:14.899
And now I turn to the fascism of tactics.&nbsp;

00:24:14.899 --> 00:24:22.110
You know, when I compare the rag tag white
supremacists in Charlottesville with the Antifa

00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:23.700
groups on the campus.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:30.679
Trump, by the way, took a lot of heat for
saying the violence is coming from all sides.

00:24:30.679 --> 00:24:36.370
But not only is Trump right in that, in fact,
he's been proven right about that.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.980
But he greatly understated the case.

00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.639
He greatly understated the case, because the
white supremacists in Charlottesville have

00:24:43.639 --> 00:24:46.890
no cultural or political power.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:50.100
The Klu Klux Klan is actually a shadow of
what it used to be.

00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:55.140
Today, if the Klu Klux Klan has a rally in
any part of the country, they'd be lucky to

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:56.900
get 100 guys.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:01.690
And those 100 guys would be encircled by 500
guys protesting them.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:05.149
Now, the Klu Klux Klan once had real power.

00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:11.860
In the 1920s, for example, the Klan marched
50,000 hooded Klansmen down Fifth Avenue in

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.289
New York City.

00:25:13.289 --> 00:25:14.789
Where were they going, by the way?

00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:17.419
To the Democratic Nationalism Convention.

00:25:17.419 --> 00:25:20.809
Many of them were delegates.

00:25:20.809 --> 00:25:25.929
But these rag tag white supremacists of today
are marginal.

00:25:25.929 --> 00:25:29.710
But what the left wants you to do is say let's
focus exclusively on them.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:30.710
Why?

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:37.380
So, you can actually ignore the far more dangerous
intimidation, violence, bullying that we are

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:41.720
doing on a much more systematic scale.

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.420
Now look at these Antifa guys for a minute
at Berkley.

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:50.730
By the way, Berkley, the home of the free
speech movement, it is a far less liberal

00:25:50.730 --> 00:25:55.090
place, in the true meaning of the word, than
Liberty.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:59.590
The free speech movement actually belongs
here at Liberty, because speaker can freely

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:05.240
speak—not just people like me.

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:13.300
So, think about what's happening.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:17.770
The people who are genuinely intolerant, the
left,&nbsp;

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:24.730
are accusing the people who are tolerant,
us, of being intolerant.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:31.690
The Antifa guys, if you look at them, with
their masks and their hoods, their weapons.&nbsp;

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:32.960
You listen to them.

00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.370
You watch them.

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:40.940
They seem not only the natural descendants
of the Klu Klux Klan, in other words, a paramilitary

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:46.370
wing of the left, just as the Klan was in
the 20s and 30s.

00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:51.510
But, they also seem natural equivalents or
counterparts to Mussolini's black shirts of

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:54.840
the 1920s or Hitler’s brown shirts of the
1930s.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:27:00.600
The only difference is that the old fascists
were happy to accept the name.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.730
“Yes, we're fascists.”

00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:07.980
The new fascists report and pretend to be
antifascists.&nbsp;

00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:16.539
And yet, these Antifa antifascists are not
the most dangerous fascists in America, because

00:27:16.539 --> 00:27:21.000
even they represent, you might call it, the
fascism of the street.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.610
And the fascism of the street is not half
as dangerous as the fascism of the institutions.

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:35.320
One reason that Antifa can morose freely at
Berkley is that the mayor of Berkley is in

00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:36.380
their pocket.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.630
He's a member of one of their Facebook groups,
reportedly.

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:46.750
He's the one who tells the cops to stand down
to give Antifa room to maneuver.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:55.169
Unlike the rag tag white supremacists of Charlottesville,
Antifa has powerful allies among the faculty,

00:27:55.169 --> 00:27:58.250
among the deans.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:05.529
In Hollywood, and in the mainstream of the
Democratic party, the fascists I worry about

00:28:05.529 --> 00:28:11.000
are the fascists of Google who can throw a
guy out, fire him, for writing a memo mildly

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.070
critical of their diversity policy.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:18.840
Or the powerful studio bosses in Hollywood
who will destroy your career.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:24.500
Even if you're a famous guy, they'll ruin
you if you're on the wrong side of the political

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.500
aisle.

00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:31.840
Or powerful deans who run billion-dollar endowments
that will topple the career of our young academic,

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:37.919
turn him or her into a pariah, because they
happen to speak out on behalf of conservatism

00:28:37.919 --> 00:28:39.960
or Trump.

00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:45.780
Or in the era of Obama and Hillary, Hillary's
still wondering, why did I lose?

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.780
What happened?

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:52.769
Well, what happened is you became the most
corrupt figure in US History.&nbsp;

00:28:52.769 --> 00:29:02.080
That's why you lost.&nbsp;

00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.660
But under Obama and Hillary, what the left
would do is mobilize the weapons of the state—the

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:15.840
IRS, the FBI, the justice department—to
go after their critics.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:20.120
This is the most dangerous kind of fascism
of all.

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:24.030
It's the fascism in which the government comes
to visit you, not with two guys in a suit

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:30.269
with a folder, but with police cars, helicopters
overhead, and SWAT teams, SWAT teams directed

00:29:30.269 --> 00:29:32.450
at American citizens.

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:36.529
So, this is the fascism of our time.

00:29:36.529 --> 00:29:45.759
It is the phenomenon not of Trump, not of
the right, but entirely, entirely of the left.

00:29:45.759 --> 00:29:50.470
And what I want to do today, here, is to alert
you to it.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:51.490
Why?

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:54.830
Because knowledge is a very powerful thing.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:30:01.059
The best way to diffuse big lies is with big
truths.

00:30:01.059 --> 00:30:05.910
And the beauty of living today is you don't
have to take my word for it.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:07.809
You can check it out.

00:30:07.809 --> 00:30:10.559
You can look it up.

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:19.279
And once you get this knowledge, you become
a very dangerous Christian and a very dangerous

00:30:19.279 --> 00:30:20.789
American.

00:30:20.789 --> 00:30:26.049
I'm very proud to say I am today, kind of
a dangerous American.

00:30:26.049 --> 00:30:36.530
Since the election, all these guys on the
left—Bill Maher, Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthew,

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:40.340
Ben Jones—
all these guys have been bloviating about

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.549
fascism this and fascism that.&nbsp;

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:49.220
Now, as soon as my book comes out, they're
all really hard to reach.

00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.490
They're nowhere to be found.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.309
They've all gone down rabbit holes.

00:30:53.309 --> 00:30:54.679
Why?&nbsp;

00:30:54.679 --> 00:31:01.710
Because they know that when big lies are confronted
with facts,

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:06.090
historical truths, they can't keep going.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:07.090
And so, think about this.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.409
The left has a race card.

00:31:09.409 --> 00:31:14.640
In fact, I took on the race card in my last
movie Hillary's America.

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:21.140
And they have a fascism card, and they use
these two cards, not to have a debate, but

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.080
to prevent debate.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:27.870
Their point is when we play the race card,
we are calling you the bad guys,&nbsp;

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:29.890
and we don't need to talk to you.

00:31:29.890 --> 00:31:34.919
When we call you a fascist, it's another way
of saying that our job is not to converse

00:31:34.919 --> 00:31:40.460
with you but to repress you, to shut you down.

00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:49.240
After all, who would want to have a conversation,
or a debate with Hitler in 1933?

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:56.090
And so, these cards are used to shut down
debate, to shut us up.

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:58.260
And a lot of Republicans haven't woken up
to this.

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:03.940
In fact, they respond in a very, sort of,
weak and invertebrate fashion.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:06.050
Don't be like that.

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:08.960
Instead, be curious.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.899
Be truly open-minded.

00:32:10.899 --> 00:32:13.389
Be willing to go where knowledge takes you.

00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:15.809
Be willing to stand up for your convictions.

00:32:15.809 --> 00:32:19.570
You are, in fact, the enemy of the big lie.

00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:24.080
You are, in fact, the standing weapons and
instruments of truth.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.160
Thank you very much.
