00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.140
- Good morning. 5:40 AM in Chengdu.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.620
Today's a very, very special flight.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.560
We're going to fly to the highest airport in the world.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.920
At the airport terminal here at 6 O' clock this is really busy.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.020
Breakfast is served here.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.660
If you like spicy food, you're in the right place.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.720
Sichuan food is known to be oily and spicy

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.880
but very, very tasty and yummy as well.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.520
This is rabbit?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.120
- Two different kinds of rabbit; one is very spicy and the other is covered with five different spices.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.800
- A spicy, braised rabbit - this is a whole rabbit here.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.820
- [Server] This is sweet braised duck from Leshan.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.740
- Today, we are going to the world's highest airport,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.760
the highest airport in the world.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.720
The name of that airport is Daocheng Yading.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.180
This is a Chinese name directly translated in to English.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.160
It's in the Western part of China in Sichuan

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.000
at 14,472 feet above sea level

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.680
and the captain and the flight crew have to wear oxygen masks

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.660
to land and take off at that airport.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.060
Are you doing to Daocheng? Do you live there?

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.100
Are you Tibetan?

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.400
- Yes I am!

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.840
- How many times have you travelled to the world’s highest airport?

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.800
- Seven or eight times.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.180
- Oh, I see. How do you feel?

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.160
- Very nice!

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.700
- It's my first time going to a place at such a high altitude, please bless me!

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.360
- You'll be fine!

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.260
- The world's highest airport challenge, here I come!

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.480
Hey, ni hao.
- Hi, ni hao.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.720
- [Sam] Hey.
- Ni hao.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.260
- [Sam] Hi, ni hao.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.020
- Hello, I am Sichuan Airlines captain Gao Fei

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.920
Welcome aboard today’s flight from Chengdu to Daocheng

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:11.060
Our flight time is about 45-50 minutes.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.200
Cruising altitude is 8,400 metres.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.820
Our cruising speed is about 800-900 km/h

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.280
because we have about 20 knots of head wind.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.660
- Whare are the main challenges with flying to the world's highest airport?

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.780
- We have certain difficulties:

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.140
The altitude of Daocheng is 4,411 meters,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.840
it is the world's highest commercial airport.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.700
The main difficulties are due to the terrain around the airport.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.380
The approach is quite straight forward,

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.260
we use RNP approach on runway 16

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.100
but we use ILS landing on runway 34.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.900
In winter, the Daocheng temperature can be as low as -30 degrees Celsius,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.200
so in the morning, there is often ice on the runway

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.340
or low fog and clouds.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.100
So it is a great challenge for pilots

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.260
and sometimes we have to decide whether to land there or turn back.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.300
- What if we have one engine failure there?

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.780
Can we still be safe and complete the flight?

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.060
- It's no problem. We have a special procedure for the failure of one engine.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.400
For many high altitude airports like Daocheng,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.460
we have special procedures in place just in case.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.560
- To fly to such high altitude airports, do the pilots need special training?

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.280
- That's right. We have special training.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.560
Pilots need a lot of flying experience.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:06.380
Our company has three categories of special airport

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.080
and pilots get promoted to fly from the lowest category.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.120
Daocheng is in our top airport category.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:21.080
When flying to Daocheng, we have two captains rather than a flying officer.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.400
- I've heard that you need to wear oxygen masks during critical times.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.480
- At such high altitudes, our company requires us to wear oxygen masks

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.940
This is the oxygen mask switch for high altitude landing.

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.220
- High altitude landing.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.140
- If the switch is on, the oxygen mask will drop at over 16,000 feet.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.720
If this switch is off, it will drop at over 14,000 feet, cabin altitude.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.320
- [Sam] This is for emergencies with the oxygen supply

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.420
but for high altitude airports, they have extra oxygen.

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.620
So this is a high altitude checklist

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.560
for the special operations at high altitude airports in China.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.860
- It's a special checklist for operation at over 9,200 meters.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.240
The areas highlighted in blue are for high altitude operations only.

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.420
Engine generator off, engine pumps off...

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.300
Crew oxygen masks, check...

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.760
- Well, I think today's flight is going to be so challenging!

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.960
- It's no problem, we're very experienced in flying to high altitude airports.

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.640
Sichuan airlines flies to many high altitude airports.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.900
- Only sixty passengers today.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.200
Because Daocheng is a tourist place,

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.100
I think it gets busier during the summer because it's still pretty cold high up in the mountains at 14,000 feet.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:22.180
I actually woke up at 2 AM - I was too excited,

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.280
I couldn't sleep because... I was also a bit worried about

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.500
the high altitude sickness when you go up to such a high altitude

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.800
because I've never been this high.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.100
The best moment in the sky for me

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.600
is when the plane cruises just above the clouds.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.820
It's always really amazing - I never get tired of that view.

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.880
- [Announcement] (Mumbles) This is your captain speaking from the (mumbles).

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:54.060
Thank you for flying with Sichuan Airlines.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.540
(Mumbles) is 3005.

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:06.360
(Mumbles) we're beginning our cruise at over 9200 meters, which is about 38,500 feet

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.560
(mumbles), our arrival time at Sichuan will be 20 past 8 this morning

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.600
(mumbles) zero, one Celsius degrees.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.180
- [Both] Welcome to the airline of the panda!

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.980
- A cute panda, as you can see.
- [Sam] Right.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.520
- An aeroplane.
- [Sam] Oh yes. I love this - let me have a look.

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.360
This is really good. This is cool.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.640
This is like a little soft toy here. I love soft toys.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.100
- A little...
- A little panda as well, wow.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.520
- [Flight computer] 300.

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:30.980
200.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:36.380
100.

00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.580
50, 40, 30, 20.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.760
Retard! Retard!

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:47.320
Retard! Retard!

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.660
- We just landed at the world's highest airport,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:20.220
number one, Daocheng, at 14,400 feet.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.340
Great landing, captain!

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.860
I'm so excited that my hear is beatring faster!

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.840
I'm finally here at the world's highest airport - Daocheng Yading.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.020
- [All] Bye and welcome to Daocheng Yading!

00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:58.800
- So, I was in China last week.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.800
YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and Netflix were all blocked there.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.220
Fortunately, I used Surfshark, a VPN provider,

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.080
to connect to a different country to be able to access these services without any problems.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.300
Surfshark can also let you access different Netflix content

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.740
by switching location, in order to access twelve different Netflix libraries.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.840
Using the VPN may actually help you to find cheaper travel.

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.580
Here's an example, flying round trip from Vancouver

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.460
to Los Angeles in July.

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:30.320
The first site is from Canada showing a non-stop flight on Air Canada at 312 Canadian dollars.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.160
Now, let's use the VPN to go to another country, say the US.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.400
Now you find the same flight with the price at 207 US dollars,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.100
which is equivalent to 274 Canadian dollars.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:46.900
That is 12% cheaper than the original price of 312 Canadian dollars.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.900
Here's an exclusive deal for my viewers:

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:52.340
You can get 83% off Surfshark VPN today

00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:54.680
and one additional free month of access.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.460
Simply go to surfshark.com/sam

00:10:57.460 --> 00:10:59.260
and enter the promo code "Sam"

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.460
This video is sponsored by Surfshark.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.200
We're just climbing up this hill to see the aeroplane depart.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.220
You can see the whole terminal.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.040
The whole terminal design looks like a UFO or a flying saucer!

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.840
I'm so happy - the world's highest airport - I made it here!

00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.740
- Welcome on board Sichuan Airlines.
- [Sam] Hello.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:00.540
- Please, this way to our warm cabin.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.620
- Hello sir.
- Hello, ni hao.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:28.500
- [Sam] This oxygen bottle, is it for use during the flight?

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:33.300
- Yes, we have three bottles like this for passengers who may need it

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.600
and we also have eight oxygen bottles for use by the crew.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.520
- So, there's an oxygen mask here. This is for the passengers.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:41.960
If they want to have oxygen, then they can take this.

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.920
You definitely don't need any entertainment on this flight

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.940
because the entertainment is the window view.

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.620
- Tashi Delak!

00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:33.060
- Tashi Delak means "Hello" in Tibetan, right?

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.200
I've heard it in Tibet and Nepal!

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.500
- I'm Tibetan!

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.940
- You speak so well in Mandarin.

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.360
How is your flight?

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:45.080
- Very good!

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.320
- [Sam] Bye!
- [Man] Bye, You're welcome!

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.460
- After four hours, I am now back in Chengdu.

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:57.300
I'm just so happy that I have accomplished the goal

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.140
of being at the world's highest airport.
