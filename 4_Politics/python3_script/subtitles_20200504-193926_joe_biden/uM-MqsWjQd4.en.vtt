00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.139
You've invested a lot in your

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:07.349
Education and people have invested in you and let me tell you the world needs your talents and does it ever?

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.260
The world needs a lot and we need it from you

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.259
We really do we need it from you young people

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.920
I mean, I'm not speaking for the rest of us up here, but I know I'm getting a little grayer

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.469
We needed from you the young people because remember this so you got to get out there

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.890
You got to give it everything you got whether it's your time

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.329
Your your your talent your prayers

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.630
Or your treasures because remember this

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.870
You will never see a u-haul

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.180
behind a hearse

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.870
I'll say it again

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.119
You will never see a u-haul behind a hearse

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:56.460
You can't take it with you. The Egyptians tried it and all they got was robbed

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.460
So the question is

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.929
What are you going to do with what you have? I'm not talking about how much you have

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.938
Some of you are business majors. Some of you are theologians nurses sociologists

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.309
Some of you have money some of you have patients some of you have kindness some of you have loved

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.109
Some of you have the gift of long-suffering whatever it is, whatever your gift is

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.769
What are you going to do with what you have?

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.530
Fail big

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.190
That's right fail big

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.580
Today is the beginning of the rest of your life and it can be couldn't be very frightening. It's a new world out there

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.179
It's a mean world out there and you only live once so

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.629
Do what you feel passionate about passionate about?

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.450
Take chances

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.590
professionally

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.050
Don't be afraid to fail

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:01.819
There's an old IQ test was nine dots and you had to draw five lines with a pencil within these nine dots

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.220
Without lifting the pencil the only way to do it was to go outside the box

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.880
So don't be afraid to go outside the box

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.340
Don't be afraid to

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.640
Think outside the box. Don't be afraid to fail big to dream

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.430
big but remember

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.789
dreams without goals

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.260
Are just dreams and they ultimately fuel disappointment

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.070
So have dreams but

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.810
Have goals

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.080
life goals yearly goals

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.390
Monthly goals daily goals. I try to give myself a goal every day

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.839
Sometimes just to not curse somebody out simple goals, but have goals and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.760
understand

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.760
That to achieve these goals

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.980
You must apply discipline

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.170
and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.120
consistency

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.269
in order to achieve your goals, you must apply discipline, which you were already done and

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.299
Consistency every day not just want to Z and miss a few days. You have to work at it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.150
Every day you have to plan

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.849
Every day you've heard the saying we don't plan to fail we fail to plan

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120
hard work

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.400
works

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:39.909
Working really hard is what successful people do and in this

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.970
text tweet

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.579
twirl that you've grown up in

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.019
Remember just because you're doing a lot more

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.519
Doesn't mean you're getting a lot more done

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.450
Remember that just because you're doing a lot more

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.439
Doesn't mean you're getting a lot more

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.069
Done don't confuse

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.129
Movement

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.129
with progress

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.690
My mother told me yeah. Yeah cuz you can run in place all the time and never get anywhere. So

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.159
Continue to strive continue to have goals continue to progress

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:24.380
I

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.459
Found that nothing in life is worthwhile

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.700
Unless you take risks

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.050
nothing

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.259
Nelson Mandela said there is no passion to be found playing small and

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.119
Settling for a life that's less than the one you're capable of living

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:44.170
You know

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:50.289
I'm sure in your experiences in school and applying to college and picking your major and deciding what you want to do with life

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.129
I'm sure people that told you to make sure you have something to fall back on

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.649
Make sure you got something to fall back on, honey

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.890
But I never understood that concept

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.410
Having something to fall back on

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.779
If I'm going to fall, I don't want to fall back on anything

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.330
Except my faith. I want to fall forward. I figure at least this way. I'll see what I'm going to hit

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:22.059
Fall forward this is what I mean

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:29.019
Reggie Jackson struck out 26 hundred times in his career the most in the history of baseball

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.740
But you don't hear about the strikeouts people remember the homeruns?

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.700
Fall forward

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:41.829
Thomas edison kentuc did one thousand failed experiments as you know that I didn't know that

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.479
Because the one thousand and first was the light bulb

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.010
Forward

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.490
Every failed experiment is one step closer to success

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.700
you've got to take risks and I'm sure you've probably heard that before, but I want to talk to you about why that's

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.780
important I

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.949
Got three reasons and then you can pick up your iPhone's

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.820
First

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:16.210
You will fail at some point in your life accept it you will lose you will embarrass yourself

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.809
You will suck at something. There's no doubt about it and

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:28.300
I know that's probably not a traditional message for a graduation ceremony. But a I'm telling you embrace it because it's inevitable

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.899
And I should know in the acting business you fail all the time early on in my career. I

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.020
auditioned for a part in a Broadway musical

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:43.569
Perfect role for me. I thought except for the fact that I can't sing. I

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.590
Didn't get the job

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.320
But here's the thing I

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.110
didn't Quint

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:57.580
I didn't fall back. I

00:06:59.039 --> 00:07:05.688
Walked out of there to prepare for the next audition and the next audition and the next audition. I prayed I

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.829
Prayed and I prayed

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:18.100
But I continue to fail and fail and fail but it didn't matter because you know what,

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:24.010
There's an old saying you hang around the barbershop long enough sooner or later. You're going to get a haircut

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:29.469
So you will catch a break and I did catch a break

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:35.529
Last year. I did a play called fences on Broadway

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.020
if someone talked about it won the Tony Award and

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:49.869
I didn't have to sing by the way, but here's the kicker. He was at the Court Theatre

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.800
It was at the same theatre that I failed that first audition 30 years prior

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.390
The point is and I'll pick up the pace

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:10.570
The point is every graduate here today has the training and the talent to succeed

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:17.440
But do you have the guts to fail? Here's my second point about failure if you don't fail

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.440
You're not even trying

00:08:21.710 --> 00:08:22.700
I'll say it again

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.140
if you don't fail

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:29.259
You're not even trying my wife told me this great expression to get something you never had

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:32.200
You have to do something you never did

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:36.430
Les Brown's a motivational speaker. He made an analogy about this

00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:42.789
He says imagine you're on your deathbed and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfulfilled

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:51.429
potential the ghosts of the ideas you never acted on the ghosts of the talents you didn't use and they're standing around your

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:53.360
bed angry

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.220
disappointed and upset

00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:00.640
they say we came to you because you could have brought us to life they say and

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.719
Now we have to go to the grave together. So I ask you today

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.519
How many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:13.210
Not only take risks

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:19.419
But to be open to life to accept new views and to be open to new opinions

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.359
To be willing to speak at a commencement at one of the best country vesica the universities in the country

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.369
Even though you're scared stiff. Well, it may be frightening. It will also be rewarding

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:38.479
Because the chances you take the people, you meet the people you love the faith that you have

00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:43.160
That's what's going to define. You never be discouraged

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:46.430
Never hold back

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:53.270
Give everything you got and when you fall throughout life and remember this

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.110
Fall forward

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:00.240
Say thank you

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.770
but grace

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:04.039
Thank you for mercy. Thank you for understanding

Thank you for wisdom. Thank you for parents. Thank you for love. Thank you for kindness

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.700
Thank you for humility. Thank you for peace

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:20.780
Thank you for Prosperity. Say thank you in advance for what's already yours

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:26.240
How I live my life. That's why I am one of the reasons why I am today

00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:33.739
Say thank you in advance for what is already yours true desire in the heart

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.850

Good is God's proof to you sit before hand to indicate that it's yours

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.230
already

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.480
I'll say it again

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:50.870
True desire in the heart that itch that you have

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:56.479
Whatever it is you want to do that thing that you want to do to help others in to grow and to make money

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:03.470
that desire that itch that's God's proof to you sit beforehand already to indicate that it's your

00:11:04.499 --> 00:11:05.229
and

00:11:05.229 --> 00:11:07.559
Anything you want good?

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:10.649
you can have

00:11:11.199 --> 00:11:13.059
So claim it

00:11:13.059 --> 00:11:15.059
Work hard to get it

00:11:15.249 --> 00:11:18.928
When you get it reach back pull someone else up

00:11:19.779 --> 00:11:21.868
each one teach one

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:28.619
Don't just aspire to make a living

00:11:30.549 --> 00:11:33.389
Aspire to make a difference

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
