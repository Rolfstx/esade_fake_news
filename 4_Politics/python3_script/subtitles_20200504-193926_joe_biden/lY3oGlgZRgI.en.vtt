00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.740
What if there was a way to heat your home
in winter, cool it in summer, and provide

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:12.039
abundant hot water all year round, all while
cutting your utility bills up to 80?

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.539
How?

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:18.050
By installing a ClimateMaster Geothermal central
heating and air conditioning system in your

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.080
home.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.990
Here's how it works:

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.980
Wherever you live, the temperature beneath
your home remains constant, regardless of

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.570
the season.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:37.470
Just a few feet down, the earth is a consistent
55 degrees, summer or winter.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.730
ClimateMaster Geothermal Heat Pump Systems
harness the stable underground temperature

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.360
to provide heating, cooling, and hot water
at remarkably high efficiencies.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.399
So high, in fact, that energy use can be cut
by up to 80 percent.

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.490
To access this stable underground temperature,
a geothermal heat pump is connected to a series

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.200
of underground loop pipes.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.340
These pipes are made from an extremely strong
and long-lasting material.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.920
Water, usually mixed with an environmentally
safe antifreeze solution, is pumped through

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.060
this loop pipe system.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.999
In summer, the heat pump takes heat from the
air in your home, transfers it to the underground

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:19.659
loop system, which then radiates the heat
away into the cool earth.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.020
Now cooled to a comfortable temperature, the
air is circulated through your home using

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.520
a traditional duct system.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.869
In winter, the system is reversed.

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.479
Heat is extracted from the ground using the
same loop system.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.389
In the heat pump, the heat from the underground
loop is compressed to a much higher temperature

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:43.409
and used to warm the air in your home.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.689
Since the geothermal system uses and earth
loop to provide your home with heat in the

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.899
winter, there is no need to burn any fossil
fuel for heating.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.399
No flame, no carbon monoxide and environmentally
friendly, geothermal systems are the smart

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:59.979
way to heat and cool your home.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.969
Let's compare a high-efficiency gas furnace
to a geothermal system for heating your home.

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.450
A high-efficiency gas furnace will give you
less than .96 units of heat for each unit

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.780
of gas burned.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.560
In contrast, a geothermal system gives you
up to FIVE units of heat for each unit of

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.440
electricity used.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.720
How can that be?

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.350
A furnace makes heat by burning fossil fuel.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.990
A geothermal system doesn't make it's own
heat.

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.310
It simply collects heat from the earth and
moves it to your home.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.450
Now let's compare a geothermal heating and
cooling system to an air-source heat pump

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.120
for cooling.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.170
When it's hot outside, an air-source heat
pump takes heat from your home and moves it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.010
to the outside air.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.430
As the outside air becomes warmer in summer,
it becomes harder and harder for the system

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.620
to dump heat from your home into the already
hot outside air.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.980
Because of this, when cooling the home with
an air-source heat pump, the system becomes

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.100
least efficient when it needs to be most efficient.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.570
A geothermal heat pump system doesn't have
this problem.

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.350
A geothermal system exchanges the heat in
your home with the cooler ground, using it's

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.580
underground loop system.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.570
It simply doesn't have to deal with high outside
air temperatures the way an air-source heat

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:12.630
pump does.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.710
Add to this the fact that a geothermal system
is installed safely inside your home with

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.000
a loop buried under ground.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.210
Unlike an air-source heat pump, there is no
outdoor equipment exposed to the elements

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.650
or the risk of vandalism.

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.140
Let's take a look at geothermal loop systems.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.590
There are several different ways to install
a geothermal loop system.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.420
Where space allows, horizontal loop are the
most cost-effective loop design for most home

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.540
owners.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.490
If space is limited, a vertical loop system
is often the best choice.

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:50.400
If a nearby pond or lake is available, a coiled
loop system can be used.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.580
This is the fastest, easiest loop system to
install.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.290
If a well is available that produces sufficient
volumes of water, and open loop system can

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.550
be installed.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.840
An open-loop system takes water from the well,
pumps it through the heat pump system, and

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.410
then returns it to the environment in a responsible,
renewable manner.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.450
And geothermal systems don't just heat and
cool your home.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.800
They can also provide you with hot water.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.039
Besides a nice shower and washing your hands,
you can use the large volumes of hot water

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.460
a geothermal system can produce for radiant
under floor heating or even for show and ice

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.539
melt under your walk ways and driveway.

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.129
A geothermal central heating and air conditioning
system from ClimateMaster can be installed

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:37.189
in almost any home, new or existing.

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:42.240
They can be installed in an attic, garage
or utility closet.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.789
Or in the case of a retrofit installation,
they can even be installed in place of an

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.629
old, outdoor air conditioning compressor section.

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.779
There are even more ways to save with a ClimateMaster
Geothermal system than just lowering your

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:56.300
utility bills.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.680
You can save up to 30 percent off the total
cost of installing a ClimateMaster geothermal

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.830
system with a federal tax credit.

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.569
Additionally, many states and local governments
and utilities also offer incentives for installing

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.780
a geothermal system.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.199
As the world's largest and most progressive
leader in clean, renewable geothermal technology

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.870
For more than 50 years ClimateMaster has designed
and manufactured industry-leading heating

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:28.650
and cooling equipment for the commercial and
residential construction market world-wide.
