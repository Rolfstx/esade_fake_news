we all receive our fair share of

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.590
accolades and awards in our lives but it
is a rare few who are honored with the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.240
title Royal Institute of British
Architects house of the year so who will

it be in 2019 we're on the home straight
visiting the last group of outstanding

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.170
buildings on the long list that are
straining every sinew to take home the

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.670
big prize I think this is magnificent
it's a magical thing six homes have made

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.129
it to the shortlist so far brilliant
great today we're looking at the last

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.300
fire from the longest grouped together
under the theme of materials and

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.149
craftsmanship
oh that's glorious thing like a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.520
sculpture later in the show we'll find
out which of them will bag the remaining

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.840
place on the shortlist from up here the
vault is really something special isn't

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.500
it then at the end of the programme
we'll find out which houses scooped the

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.310
great title
so join us as we size up the last few

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.369
remaining contenders for the our IBA
House of the Year 2019 on your mark get

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:49.600
set go

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.350
so far the homes that have made the
house of the Year shortlist have ranged

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.159
from the magnificent and the monumental
to the delightfully compact there are

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:09.289
two experimental houses neatest farm a
playful exploration of history and the

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.380
meticulously crafted pocket house then a
pair of homes that melt into their

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.650
surroundings the nature lovers
restorative rural retreat and the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.900
shadowy black house and then two
down-to-earth projects secular retreat

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:37.010
powerful and geological and house
lessons a modern farmhouse in this

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.610
program we'll be looking at a group of
homes that explore materials and

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.280
craftsmanship sell more exotic and
finally dress like Italian princesses

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.160
others are more directs local characters
whose materials speak authentically of

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.350
the place they're from but whether it's
copper concrete stone or timber there's

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:05.180
nothing that's not beautifully honed or
buffed in this well-crafted Bunch our

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:15.680
first buffed house is found in the
metropolis the posh bit in this very

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.570
upmarket London neighborhood there is
down the street the very new upmarket

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.590
house rich in invention and materials

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:40.940
this very fine Greek Revival house is
not in nope to find it I got to lead you

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:48.620
up the garden path
oh yeah wow that doesn't disappoint

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:58.590
that's glorious thing like a sculpture
this is housed in a garden it's

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.800
funnel-like roof rising between the
buildings that surrounded on all sides

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.670
this overlooked little spots used to
have a 60s bungalow on it when it came

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.410
onto the market it caught the eye of the
architect Jenny Botsford who handedly

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.590
lives upstairs after 15 years we found
it came off sale and thought we should

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.450
really do something with her to deal
with this tricky location I think Jenny

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.950
took inspiration from an iceberg the
funnel is just the tip of a three storey

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:38.850
mainly subterranean home the lowest
level is eight meters below ground with

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.860
a swimming pool yoga room and a living
space one floor up and still underground

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.330
is the master bedroom guest room and
bathrooms and two deep and very

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.070
necessary light wells on the ground
floor are the lids of the two light

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.960
wells and the kitchen and living space

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.960
it's all chopped off with that funnel
roof reaching out of the shadows like a

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.060
flower it's offset shape whirs computer
models to follow the path of the Sun

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.539
bring in light and afford privacy from
the houses that overlook it this is an

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.430
exquisitely crafted building the are IBA
judges admired of the quality and

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:28.470
refinement of materials and deafness of
detail and you are you I'm good thanks

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.530
great beautiful copper on the roof well
it's such difficult shape to make we

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:39.630
needed a material as malleable that you
can do that with and it just bends as it

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.860
needs me the copper cupboard roof maybe
redolent of 1960s churches inside

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.610
however it's all Cathedral fan vaulting
and wow that that that is remarkable

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:01.409
this is an absolute marvel that view of
the sky is amazing isn't it I'm just

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.870
completely you just kind of get
mesmerized yeah

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.810
what's make me do is lie down yes do
that yeah you know I I like like

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:16.880
underneath donors yeah and this is like
it's oh heavens yeah it's better it's a

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.400
satisfied like underneath the Dome of
the pantheon that's a good one you like

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:29.570
that yeah the project was financed by a
property investment company who bought

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:35.570
into Janus high spec range of pleasingly
tactile materials a bespoke copper

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:40.639
kitchen crying out for some fingerprints
behind which sits a flight of stairs

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:45.650
lined with huge fluted tiles made of
Carrara the Italian marble from which

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:52.490
Michelangelo carved David did you go to
the quarry and choose a we did yeah

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.060
it's an extravagant thing to do isn't it
I mean it is and it isn't me if you

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.410
think about this in 50 years time it
will be exactly like this I think

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.370
January the materials here we've thought
of in those terms it's kind of not now

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.470
but over time what they yeah you made a
really good case for it it's very

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:16.970
compelling that's they're gonna do it
properly the first floor below ground

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.599
level contains the guest in master
bedrooms where the exquisite selection

00:07:20.599 --> 00:07:28.430
of materials continues a lot of beauty
here this is an entirely timberland room

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:34.099
yeah with an enormous metal box in it
they're like walk in industrial fridges

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:38.000
these because of the stainless material
but actually that they're so Oh mirrored

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:48.349
behind exquisite stuff not out of a
catalogue could never be of course the

00:07:48.349 --> 00:07:53.870
ensuite is also marble light fit for a
visiting Roman demigod and with a view

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.039
into the light well that runs down
through the house so this is the hanging

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:03.539
garden from upstairs which now makes its
way down here and below as well

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:08.740
the huge deep hole needed to make this
house was made possible thanks to the

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:13.419
basement contractor Phil Monday but
depth wasn't his biggest problem

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:17.560
it was access to the site walking down
here brings back a lot of bad memories

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:21.430
of having to logistically get everything
in and out of this project so everything

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:26.139
had to fit in this one point one meter
wide area so less than five foot and so

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:32.909
what we actually created was a triple
storey scaffold conveyor belts remove

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:38.020
200 lorry loads of Earth from this site
they had to use mini excavators that

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.010
could squeeze into the gap or
piledrivers that had to be disassembled

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:47.649
and brought in in pieces everything
moved at a snail's pace we could have

00:08:47.649 --> 00:08:51.670
finished this basement in two months but
in fact because of all the constraints

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:57.040
that were put upon us it took 14 months
for us to construct this basement but on

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:01.779
reaching the lowest level with a living
room and leisure facilities I can't help

00:09:01.779 --> 00:09:06.940
but think Phil's extra year in this hole
was well worth it another extraordinary

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:14.380
large beautiful room with a pool
yes well yeah as you would you need a

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:22.000
pool so how light is it I mean look it's
no it's 10 plus 5 yeah it's got a little

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:31.990
bit cloudy what if I turn the light out
yeah but it's beautiful and it's a very

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:35.170
different experience again yeah very
different

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:41.279
this is magnetically an appeal this is
and then you swim towards that light

00:09:41.279 --> 00:09:44.950
quite a few aspects on this house where
you're taken away from things you're

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:51.100
used to and experience something new yes
one you know being in a marble line pool

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:55.420
with this kind of very concentrated
light it's not every day is it you do

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.630
that

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:06.660
so you everything to yourself I will
never ever be able to live in a place as

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:11.430
beautiful as this well neither will I
then that doesn't matter

00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:15.959
because throughout history people who
put up buildings to be to be

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:22.829
inspirational to be exemplars to shows
the way for it and just occasionally

00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:30.630
people have put up buildings as
idealized as this to simply take our

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:35.849
breath away

00:10:36.199 --> 00:10:40.740
coming up the final four contenders for
the our IBA

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:47.399
house of the Year 2019 oh my goodness
that is magnificent I mean you have a

00:10:47.399 --> 00:11:03.899
complete ribbon of window wrapping
around your entire house oh the three

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:08.639
little piggies I always felt sorry for
the one who was building his house out

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:13.800
of sticks he was most unfairly derided
against his choice of materials timber

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.350
has often been the first and the best
choice of material in buildings ever

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:26.420
since we left the caves of course not
all wooden houses are created equally

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:35.279
for the next long listed house the
design expert and writer machello Gunda

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:40.230
him is among some slightly bigger sticks
the Oaks of Chevis Thorne Barton in

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:44.310
Devon there are four hundred and forty
species of oak here so it's probably the

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:49.410
largest oak Arthur Rita in the world it
was started by Michael Hess Kurt amery

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:53.339
and when his daughter Jessica came to
build a house here it could only be made

00:11:53.339 --> 00:12:00.119
of one thing wood
this jolly wooden wedge lined with a

00:12:00.119 --> 00:12:05.309
timber interior with an eye level set a
tree height his greenhouse now home to

00:12:05.309 --> 00:12:12.239
Jessica her husband Jason and their two
children Jonah and Isadora it's even

00:12:12.239 --> 00:12:16.859
built on the site of an old wooden
prefab just before my father died he

00:12:16.859 --> 00:12:21.899
gave us the house and the surrounding
fields at the beginning stages of the

00:12:21.899 --> 00:12:25.019
design process Jesse's father was
involved

00:12:25.019 --> 00:12:32.549
it's very sad he didn't get to see the
end product hello nice to meet you it's

00:12:32.549 --> 00:12:36.659
a bear it is as he approached it's
beautifully concealed by all these

00:12:36.659 --> 00:12:41.129
gorgeous trees that's one of the things
the architect wanted to do most was to

00:12:41.129 --> 00:12:45.899
create something that fits the landscape
and it looks like you're quite high up

00:12:45.899 --> 00:12:50.269
and it feels quite sort of treehouse
like

00:12:52.510 --> 00:12:57.920
unlike a tree house greenhouse has been
built on 30 concrete piles to stop it

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.150
sliding down the slope on the lower
ground floor built into the hill or two

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:06.530
bedrooms and a family room then on the
upper ground floor there's a TV room at

00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:10.490
the back of the house then the entrance
hall leading to an open-plan living

00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:15.320
dining area on the upper floor are two
more bedrooms with bathrooms and a

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.020
double height space looking down onto
the dining area

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:26.600
and the whole thing has been coated in
larch that's slowly turning silver apart

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.709
from where it's been protected from the
Devon weather you can see that feels a

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:37.880
bit like a Sawyer in here but there are
no sweaty men in small towels this is a

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.199
light and elegant space the Maine middle
floor of the house a wedge of a room

00:13:42.199 --> 00:13:49.720
that opens out into an amazing 270
degree window oh my goodness that is

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.680
magnificent I mean you have a complete
ribbon of window wrapping around your

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.149
entire house you now really get that
sense of thing up in the treetops don't

00:13:59.149 --> 00:14:05.000
you that giddy sense of height is
mirrored above your head where the

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.079
ceiling part gives way to avoid that
extends right up to the apex of the

00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:15.230
building the staircase leads to the
delightful balcony and library above we

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:19.670
felt it needed to be opened up a bit and
as it happens it works really well it

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.399
means that these rooms up here are
interconnected and you get a real sense

00:14:22.399 --> 00:14:27.589
of who's in the house and and you feel
quite together as resolving the glazed

00:14:27.589 --> 00:14:31.790
middle for cuts across the building like
the filling in a house sandwich but

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:36.380
these are the only views to be found on
the upper floors the bedrooms enjoy

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:42.920
corner views for the children or for the
adults to enjoy a soap while losing

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.880
themselves in the leaves

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.800
on the lower level the playroom and
spare bedrooms have slot windows with

00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.570
ground-level views and if you're not
worried about a Vista then head to the

00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:03.810
narrowest point of the building and it's
cozy den the our IBA jury said that

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:09.210
greenhouse abounds with character and
personality the personality behind it is

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:12.930
the architect David Shepherd who was
long listed for his own house Cobb

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:18.120
corner in 2017 he's a man with a
singular vision and a deep love of all

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.590
things
timber what is the best sustainable tear

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:26.870
of you can have on a building so we
minimized steel minimized the concrete

00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:34.530
max myosin wood the interior has oak
flooring birch ply wood shelving beech

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:41.310
stairs and Douglas fir door frames the
outside is clad in larch which David

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:45.780
wanted cut into narrow strips for
variation for the Carpenters David's

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:50.280
Kelly and Daniel Acton he was as
demanding as a cabinet maker specifying

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.500
five angled cuts on every length of
timber so if that's the bottom piece you

00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:01.230
have a compound miter on the bottom with
a 45 so that's two cuts on that 1/3 cut

00:16:01.230 --> 00:16:06.570
there an expansion joint in there but
yeah it was a lot of cutting involved a

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.860
lot of fixing involved and there's I
think we worked out eight miles of

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:20.280
timber that added up to three months
just spent cutting and fixing the

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:24.960
cladding I think clients actually
realized how long it would take and in

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:28.320
fact myself I didn't realize how long it
would take but in natural fat I think

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:34.040
the end result speaks for itself
among all the beautiful detailing and a

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.760
variety of Timbers David did manage to
find a place for some particularly

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:43.850
special wood in the dining table and
staircase about five years ago we had a

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:48.830
big storm down here and two big beech
trees fell down my parents house just

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:52.430
down the road
and my father said take it away and

00:16:52.430 --> 00:16:59.150
dryer and he might be able to use it in
your house the wood was stored for three

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:03.620
years with a local carpenter and sawmill
owner Warren Hughes who noticed it had

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.230
begun to sport developing a delicate
pattern caused by a fungal infection on

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:13.520
the end of the timber we can see that
the fungus is growing on there too the

00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:19.370
black on the outside where obviously the
mold is more prolific moldy stairs don't

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:24.500
sound appealing but once it dries out
the fungal infection dies leaving a

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:29.180
delightful pattern of tracery markings
in the wood when the oil goes on it and

00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:34.700
it starts to sink into the timber and
enhances all of those marks it's not

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:39.590
uniform it's not perfect doesn't conform
to things but I think this is real

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:42.220
beauty

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:50.130
the resulting stairs and table rightly
formed the centerpieces to this home

00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:55.620
under a link to Jessie's father he was
very pleased that we wanted to live here

00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:00.330
and have a house here because it was so
important to him and I it's a shame you

00:18:00.330 --> 00:18:05.040
didn't get to see the final finished
article but I think he would have I

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.700
think he would have liked

00:18:08.929 --> 00:18:14.910
this grownup treehouse not only honors
Jess's father's legacy but also

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:20.429
celebrates their mutual love of wood and
with the exacting guidance of their

00:18:20.429 --> 00:18:26.900
architects they've created a home that's
completely at one with nature

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:40.830
the something reassuringly old about
stone isn't the most primal most

00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:46.350
primordial of building materials
offensively imagine that some antecedent

00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:51.330
of mine were skinning a mammoth with
these very Flint's thousands of years

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:58.530
ago stone lends a house a certain
permanence it means it if you build with

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:07.890
stone you better get it right because it
could be around for a very long time I'm

00:19:07.890 --> 00:19:12.030
in Monmouth show in South Wales where
the local sandstone has weathered many

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:22.369
of welsh winter and I'm here to see a
new house built from this old stone

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:30.950
that's nice
this is silver how l-shaped and in two

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:37.690
parts the larger newest stone section
and a smaller converted brick barn

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:43.519
it's home to Emma and David and their
daughters Grace and Charlotte on the

00:19:43.519 --> 00:19:48.110
inside they needed a modern family house
but externally it had to feel more like

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:54.200
a traditional Monmouthshire building we
wanted to create a property that felt as

00:19:54.200 --> 00:20:00.289
if it belonged within this environment
mothers to more sort of cubist type

00:20:00.289 --> 00:20:08.500
architecture but it's not California you
know it needs to sit in the plot oh hi

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:21.350
you ever yes i solid so tell me a little
bit about this place because um this is

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:27.350
how old I think 1905 it was built it's
the old coach house - next door so it's

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:30.440
hard to tell which is the younger which
of the older building because that's got

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:36.529
a tile roof and it's painted brick this
is got a metal roof and it's made from

00:20:36.529 --> 00:20:41.510
local stone even though they're you know
vastly different materials and it really

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:48.019
you know looks right the are iba judges
light the way silver how mary's the

00:20:48.019 --> 00:20:51.710
lightness and transparency of modern
construction with the permanence and

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:57.200
craftsmanship of Monmouthshire quarried
stone and inside the jury praised the

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:06.980
open and flexible spaces and acute
attention to detail the new part of the

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:11.240
building is arranged over three levels
the ground floor has a double height

00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:16.399
main living space next to a secluded
stag and office the first floor has

00:21:16.399 --> 00:21:20.659
three ensuite bedrooms for the family
and the top floor has two guest bedrooms

00:21:20.659 --> 00:21:25.310
and bathrooms
a glass corridor connects to the old

00:21:25.310 --> 00:21:32.030
coach house which has a double-height
kitchen with a mezzanine playroom

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:36.980
the interior of this older section has
all the Verve of a modern kitchen garden

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:43.370
restaurant
oh this is lovely and refreshing and

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:49.580
light and spacious they removed a floor
to make this big voltage space fitted

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.360
out with a gargantuan wall about
cupboards that in fact hides a utility

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.710
room behind and a mezzanine playroom for
the girls up top you can hear them and

00:21:57.710 --> 00:22:00.830
they can hear us you know they're toys
are tucked away how to sight yes

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:03.800
although I wish they would bring their
rubbish down and put in the big rather

00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:07.790
than just not shit no just can't props
justice to throw things at you yeah so

00:22:07.790 --> 00:22:20.650
can I get up oh pretty beautiful lovely
staircase for them nice space great

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:25.070
actually from up here the vault is
really something special isn't it I can

00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:33.260
see how tempting it is for them through
in the new part of the building the

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:37.700
rustic stone exterior actually hides a
steel frame that does all the hard

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.810
structural work allowing for an
expansive living room and decadent

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:45.950
amounts of glass you can experience the
magic of the outside in and the inside

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:53.920
out this one too and that is that oh
great I said fact the entire wall

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.920
disappears

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:04.610
the living room connects upwards as well
as out the chimney-piece reaches up and

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:09.800
past a first floor walkway that leads to
their daughter's bedrooms which in turn

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:21.860
are linked by a shared bathroom and
dressing room this is s mirrors oh my

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:32.440
word what an amazing little optical
illusion that is astonishingly nice I

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:40.970
think I'd be able to sleep in here the
oak trees which frame these views and

00:23:40.970 --> 00:23:45.080
surround the entire house are all
subject to root protection orders which

00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:49.370
restricted work near them and dictated
the way that the architect Martin Hall

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:54.860
and designer Kelly Bednarik arranged the
building we pretty much had to thread

00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:00.200
the plan through a series of route
protection areas and so by creating

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:05.210
these no build zones on the site plan it
sort of actually encouraged us to top

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:09.590
the floor plan we did it took me a while
to convince the cringe factor to take

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:15.830
the project on because he just saw
headaches and complexity with it to

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.820
avoid damaging the roots a system of
protective matting was laid over the

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:23.780
heavy traffic areas of the site and then
topped with aggregate to spread the

00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:30.100
weight of the diggers and cranes
resulting in a 100% tree survival rate

00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:36.179
and a house nestled among the Oaks as if
it's always been there

00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:43.940
seems to me that if if you wanna build
something which truly reflects the

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:49.490
history of a place you've got to study
in detail the shapes the angles the

00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:53.930
materials of ancient buildings in that
place you've got to understand the

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:57.770
qualities of the rock and how Stone's
layer

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:03.800
you've got to even dig the ground and
see its color in order to be able to

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:15.090
build something as connected to place
and as successful as this

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:20.259
we're nearing the end of the series with
only two of the 20 long listed houses

00:25:20.259 --> 00:25:27.190
left to see this is engineering to the
max but which will make the shortlist

00:25:27.190 --> 00:25:43.269
and then maybe even go on to win the RI
be a house of the Year for 2019 the

00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:49.929
ancient Japanese art of origami involves
folding paper hundreds of times to

00:25:49.929 --> 00:25:56.649
create something of exquisite beauty it
takes really special skills to elevate

00:25:56.649 --> 00:26:06.299
something simple and ordinary into
something remarkable there it's a Glacia

00:26:06.299 --> 00:26:14.109
this is Warwickshire an ordinary Street
with ordinary houses but Damian burrows

00:26:14.109 --> 00:26:18.070
is here to see a house that's taken
every day materials and does something

00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:24.740
extraordinary with them
this is Ghosthouse finely crafted from

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:29.900
concrete and steel it got its name
because it seems to be peeking out at

00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:34.360
its neighbors as if ready to say boo

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.980
it's home to a nightclub and bar
entrepreneur who's a big fan of concrete

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:46.120
Steve Smith Dave hi hi do you write
great David

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.110
incredible house it's completely
opposite to the rest of the street

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:56.060
absolutely it was always meant to be a
very simple pallet concrete black steel

00:26:56.060 --> 00:27:02.090
that's it and Steve's pared back
concrete vision has produced a highly

00:27:02.090 --> 00:27:06.950
crafted and unnervingly well-ordered
house reflected in the pools of water

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:13.100
dyed to make a black mirror image the
reflecting ponds were a later edition it

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:18.380
was supposed to initially be a wild
meadow but actually it would by its very

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:23.450
nature be wild and unruly and out of my
control I know what you mean nature

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:29.990
doing its own thing that annoys me as
well Steve's need to control his

00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:35.150
environment is evident in the perfectly
symmetrical layout the Riv a jury

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:43.370
admires the meticulously straight board
markings laid out in the concrete the

00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:48.230
main floor of ghost house is actually
three meters below ground level at the

00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:53.120
back is a courtyard garden then a large
open-plan living area and above is the

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:57.800
master bedroom with a bathroom and
dressing room at the front of the house

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.430
there's a sunken entrance courtyard
accessed by stairs surrounded by two

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:09.290
smaller subterranean bedrooms and a home
cinema all under the black pools as you

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:13.160
sink below the black waterline at the
front door it turns out this house is

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:18.620
made of almost honey-coloured concrete
this is so warm it's so inviting it was

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:23.900
a local mix it was a local sand that was
used so there's almost the warmth of a

00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:30.700
Cotswold stone within the pour
so it isn't grey or steer concrete okay

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:35.540
in case you were expecting scatter
cushions and doilies through the front

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:42.040
door it's wall-to-wall concrete and
symmetry throughout

00:28:42.290 --> 00:28:48.540
there's a passion for concrete I love
the material and it works there isn't

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:52.740
overkill and it's staying true to the
vision and to the belief that we could

00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.700
create something purely out of concrete
that doesn't feel a stair that doesn't

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:02.010
feel totally brutal that still feels
like a home of course a real home should

00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:06.390
feel tailored to its owners passions so
head around the central courtyard and

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:10.620
you find steve's given himself a home
cinema and then there's the spare

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.430
bedrooms where he's dedicated to
dressing rooms to his collection of rare

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:18.690
training shoes
this was my indulgence I've collected

00:29:18.690 --> 00:29:23.340
sneakers for many many years and this is
an opportunity to be able to show them

00:29:23.340 --> 00:29:26.820
all off here what your friends think my
friends love it I can't say the same

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:30.870
about my parents my mother walked out
when she saw this and when I was gonna

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:37.620
grow up but who cares what people think
when it's your own hope you can display

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:41.370
the artwork that makes you happy and
even build yourself a set of mirrored

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:47.530
stairs up to your bedroom
we're here this has been designed so

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:53.200
that if wanted it could be split into
two spaces so wore down the middle all

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:59.470
the services are in again everything
symmetrical around that center point to

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:02.380
create this ode to symmetry written in
concrete

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:06.390
Steve enlisted the architect Philip
Shepherd where did all of this start

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:12.210
involved such as I graduated our
university first real project was to

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:16.060
meet with Steve and he came to the
ambition of I want to build a really

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:22.000
cool contemporary concrete house which
was a very much a challenge for some

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.640
newly qualified
to work with Phillip a specialist

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:31.440
concrete contractor John Thompson was
brought in their joint meticulous work

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:35.880
has produced a beautiful finish all the
channels and conduits the wires and

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:41.190
fittings were cast into the concrete
although there was a slight hiccup when

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:45.570
one of the formwork molds gave way mid
pour we had one shorter pop and

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:49.950
unfortunately when Steve was shown his
dad round and he was walking down the

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:55.680
steps and there was a banging oh dear
dear as we're standing chatting the

00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:02.310
shutter blue and there was a river of
concrete right across the site odd by my

00:31:02.310 --> 00:31:08.100
dad you jinx - absolutely at the very
top where we report it you can see add a

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:11.820
joint but I didn't want to hide it I
didn't want to finesse it it tells a

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.920
story of the build

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:19.550
Ghosthouse not only tells the story of
its own construction but that of its

00:31:19.550 --> 00:31:24.860
owner it is a container for steve's
tastes and passions not all houses can

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:27.280
do that

00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:33.719
concrete is an uncompromising material
but Steve is an even more uncompromising

00:31:33.719 --> 00:31:39.509
and driven client his commitment to his
dream coupled with his team's ability to

00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:46.349
shape and mold his ideas have created a
beautifully crafted and truly personal

00:31:46.349 --> 00:31:56.159
home there is one final house to see
before we find out which of today's five

00:31:56.159 --> 00:32:00.989
will make the shortlist then will at
last find out who has won the Riv a

00:32:00.989 --> 00:32:16.589
house of the Year for 2019 the crafts
are often unfairly compared to the arts

00:32:16.589 --> 00:32:21.239
the the making of the functional item on
one hand as opposed to the truly sublime

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:25.679
on the other
but while the crafted item may not have

00:32:25.679 --> 00:32:30.539
the lofty ambitions or the high ideals
of a piece of art it can nevertheless be

00:32:30.539 --> 00:32:36.989
as beautiful and as noble plus crafted
objects have the benefit of being useful

00:32:36.989 --> 00:32:39.830
as well

00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:46.100
the influence of the Victorian Arts and
Crafts movement can be seen here in this

00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:51.550
part of suburban North London in the
cottage dormers and chunky chimneys here

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:59.600
but Damien's come to see a house steeped
in 21st century craftsmanship Kenwood

00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:04.550
Lee house up front the building echos
the proportions of its polite double

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:10.520
fronted neighbors that round them back
things really start to swing with an

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:15.320
immaculately finished glass box
containing courtyards open stairs and

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:21.680
sunken levels the RI ba judges admired
the skill and enthusiasm with which

00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:27.500
exotic and expensive materials have been
deployed throughout the house was

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:32.960
realized by Jo mech a builder for him
and his wife Ivana they both arrived in

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.940
the UK from Poland in the mid-90s I got
a job as a decorator painter decorator

00:33:37.940 --> 00:33:43.730
so I learned a pretty much every trade I
was on tools for 10 just over 10 years

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:49.250
I'd done some decoration with one that I
can't you know like wallpaper stuff like

00:33:49.250 --> 00:33:54.590
that helping you from humble beginnings
to master craftsman Jo make now employs

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:59.060
a hundred people and his firm worked on
house in a garden that we saw earlier as

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:04.670
well as 27 teens nominated Highgate
house but he's finally managed to make

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:08.290
time to build a house of his own

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:16.190
hello how are you oh my God thank you
hello hi to my Center Wow stunning house

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:20.119
thank you very much but the thing that
stands out from the street is the choice

00:34:20.119 --> 00:34:24.049
of materials we went through so many
materials and we're really proud of

00:34:24.049 --> 00:34:30.889
lithography and that care can be seen in
the frameless glass dormers the

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:35.389
perfectly finished concrete the
Junction's of materials and the tiniest

00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:38.919
of brass door details

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:47.569
Kenward li house has a basement level
that contains a sunken carport gym games

00:34:47.569 --> 00:34:53.000
room guest rooms and cinema it connects
to the ground floor through a light well

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.440
courtyard up to a living and drawing
room at the front of the house and an

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:02.029
open-plan kitchen and dining area at the
back the first floor has four bedrooms

00:35:02.029 --> 00:35:06.940
and the top floor their master bedroom
suite

00:35:09.089 --> 00:35:13.359
Jonica DeVoe no put everything on the
line by remortgaging the business

00:35:13.359 --> 00:35:19.359
premises to finance the project but the
results have been worth it I'm walking

00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:23.369
inside here it's just fantastic

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:30.220
level of execution the level of detail
the level of thought is mind-blowing of

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:37.720
course and a lot of long days and nights
designing changing the interior is a

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:43.510
joyous celebration of perfectly selected
and finished materials exemplified by

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:48.130
the massive board Mart concrete-lined
hall designed by Joe meek and navona

00:35:48.130 --> 00:35:52.270
with the architects Ben and Jelena
cousins is that the structural core of

00:35:52.270 --> 00:35:58.660
the house and it enables the whole house
to to be formed around it with a house

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:03.640
this size a concrete middle could be
dark the way around it just get rid of

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:08.410
some floor the two sides of the house
are connected by bridges with a

00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:12.359
staircase which is kind of floating

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:17.910
but floating staircases are not the only
engineering marvels here down in the

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:22.170
basement a ton of glass literally has
been used to make the mother of all

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:32.400
patio doors down here this is
engineering to the max how easy is that

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:41.160
it just glides and the top pane goes as
well the technological basement also has

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:48.390
is the gym spa cinema room and a sunken
carport that straight out of a Bond

00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:54.859
villains lair why Mr Burrowes I've been
expecting you

you do need somewhere to escape to now
and we're upstairs the master suites I

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:10.300

and all the line out to the back it's a
pleasure to wake up in the morning and

00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:22.120

you've put into it have you ever been

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:28.120
tempted to sell yes I have that's right
we have to agent Cole and asking us to

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.290

tempting all fighting ridiculous money

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:44.080
yeah but we didn't take it he okay yeah
yeah good that's just the thought of

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:48.100
selling his house is very important to
us it is hey we put a lot of effort

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:51.150
enjoy dance and laugh

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:59.370
what shines through in this house is
Jamaican Davone is unrelenting passion

00:37:59.370 --> 00:38:05.820
to build a home that never compromises
on quality as real pride in the

00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:11.840
craftsmanship here and the results or
they speak for themselves

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:20.590
so there we have it the last five long
listed and lovingly crafted houses that

00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:25.930
are vying for a place on this year's
shortlist will it be the sunken temple

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:31.390
to craftsmanship housed in a garden or
greenhouse built as beautifully as a

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:37.060
piece of furniture among the Oaks silver
how a meticulous marriage of the ancient

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:42.940
and modern or ghost house a modernist
love letter to concrete and symmetry or

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:51.400
could it be Kenwood Lee a passionate
labor of love and a hymn to quality John

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:58.870
party chair of the RI bas judging panel
can reveal all what have you short list

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:04.030
of John we've shortlisted one project
which is the green house in Devon so

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:09.910
some lovely setting trees pastures water
and there's its theme in it it's got a

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:13.000
window at the front so you know it's a
house it's got a door at the side Oh but

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:19.180
apart from that you think what why short
list is project its original it's all

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:24.910
quite quirky but actually it works with
the site yeah it creates exciting spaces

00:39:24.910 --> 00:39:28.960
it's very involved exquisite woodland
shed it's an incredibly beautiful

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.110
woodland shared here

00:39:33.110 --> 00:39:43.770

restorative rural retreat a tranquil
barn for humans and a nature alike on

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:22.200
the Isle of Man black house a Scottish

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:30.890
on the place secular retreat an almost
geological building perched atop a hill

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:36.750
house lessons are subtle but delightful
series of quiet sheds in rural Northern

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:42.480
Ireland or green house a lovingly
crafted Timbo wedge nestled into a

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:53.070
wooded hill all exemplary all in with a
chance to win and that winner is well

00:40:53.070 --> 00:40:57.200
I'll give you a clue it's not in the
city

00:41:00.609 --> 00:41:06.470
well in this year's series there been a
lot of farms a lot of barns a lot of

00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:15.890
buildings masquerading as farms and
barns one of them is a winner so which

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:23.450
of our rural wonders is this year's top
dog it's house lessons in County down a

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:28.460
seemingly humble arrangement of two
simple joined buildings but joined and

00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:33.380
detailed beautifully and with great care
it's an example of how someone really

00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:37.490
clever can take hundra everyday
materials and transform them into

00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:43.490
something glorious or for the price of
an average detached house and the clever

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:55.329
clogs behind it is the architect Kieran
McGonagall really I'm thrilled for

00:41:55.329 --> 00:42:00.160
everybody concerned and the latest day

00:42:01.480 --> 00:42:05.810
I've come to meet Kieran as well as the
owners Sylvia and Michael who

00:42:05.810 --> 00:42:12.140
commissioned him to design house lessons
Kieran oh yeah how are you very well you

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:18.440
and my husband might have Michael yeah
congratulations on winning guys humbling

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:24.260
experience just been really unexpected
but we're thrilled

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:29.750
well I sense when we saw his work online
we just really liked just so we never we

00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:37.220
never explored another architect who
never went beyond Karen and Kieran more

00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:42.790
than proved his worth creating a house
that is a lesson in pragmatic elegance

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:48.319
it's composed of two simple single-story
blocks one with the living room and

00:42:48.319 --> 00:42:56.190
kitchen with a mezzanine office above
and one with a single corridor with

00:42:56.190 --> 00:43:02.220
three bedrooms of it connecting to a
shared courtyard all this for a budget

00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:09.420
of three hundred and fifty thousand
pounds so it's been modest budget so you

00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:13.620
spend it depends on your frame of
reference yes certainly not every penny

00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:21.680
we have is that's modest it is when the
house looks like it costs twice that

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:26.850
Kyra's genius lay in his orchestration
of inexpensive materials like plain

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:31.530
engineering bricks and concrete his
master stroke was to focus on a single

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:38.060
important Junction one horizontal line
where walls meet the ceilings

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:45.440
everything hits that same horizontal the
white space above is always completely

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:49.670
interruption yes and Abel brings up a
massive scale to the other ways tall

00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:55.230
spaces
it's a simple yet mesmerizing device

00:43:55.230 --> 00:43:59.520
that yields ethereal white voltage
spaces in every room while a

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:04.050
ground-level all fields human and
practical what I find really disciplined

00:44:04.050 --> 00:44:07.320
here so you could have taken those
cupboards bare

00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:10.740
you could have sailed right to the
Richer and in future the clan could

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:16.200
increase their stories but for now it's
as much as we can afford so okay so it's

00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:24.660
no self-restraint that's forces to
limitless budget Sylvia and Michael did

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:29.490
splash out on the floor though it's a
beautiful terrazzo concrete embedded

00:44:29.490 --> 00:44:36.869
with crushed Marvel our client was very
keen on the durability of the

00:44:36.869 --> 00:44:42.990
transuranic masters who could be assured
that the trouser withstood tortoise here

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:48.630
I'm yeah they had a tortoise and that
was one of the big concerns about the

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:52.940
floor that it can withstand the
corrosive properties of tortoise or

00:44:52.940 --> 00:45:03.000
whether it would stain and actually eat
into the house lessons is disarmingly

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:11.460
modest carefully organized and
enchanting it bewitched the our IBA

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.750
judges this was up against some really
heavy hitters so an easy winner to

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.830
choose in the no no as you say we're up
against it's David and Goliath at one

00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:23.490
level there's some big hitters in there
this one through its modesty and it's

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:31.410
just sheer strength and it's thought and
it's sophisticated elegance I mean I

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:37.170
hope buildings like this give a message
you can do something this could that

00:45:37.170 --> 00:45:40.520
cost that's Wow

00:45:40.810 --> 00:45:46.700
you know somebody once tell me that a
great idea need cost no more money than

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:52.010
a really bad one this place of course is
testament to that proof that for the

00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:56.090
money with which you could buy an
ordinary three-bedroom bland box of a

00:45:56.090 --> 00:46:01.670
home you could instead build something
outstanding like this an award-winning

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:08.599
home all you need to do is to follow the
example of Michael and Sylvia find

00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:15.050
yourself a great architect like Kieran
and go on this great big architectural

00:46:15.050 --> 00:46:20.480
adventure become patrons Commission
something special and make your mark in

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:23.109
the landscape

promise becomes known for disaster and
