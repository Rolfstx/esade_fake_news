In 1613 The Zemsky Sobor (the National Assembly) adopted a decision to invite Michael Fyodorovich Romanov to become tsar of Russia. This decision was announced in Red Square in front of numerous crowds of people: â€œMichael Fyodorovich shall be tsar and lord of Muscovy and all the Russian state.â€<9d> In order to prevent disturbances, Michael Romanov had to take a terrible sin upon his soul â€“ to execute a 3 year-old boyâ€¦ 

The most vivid pages of Russian history and the establishment and consolidation of Russian state power are associated with the eighteen Russian Tsars of the House of Romanov which include such historic names as Peter the Great, Catherine the Great, Nicholas I and Alexanders I, II and III. The dynasty ended with the brutal assassination of the last Tsar, Nicholas II and his family by the Bolsheviks in Ekaterinburg in 1917.

The Romanov dynasty played a hugely important role in world history, and the series highlights the life stories and characters of the tsars, recounting their rise to power and their contribution to the dynasty, their merits and their faults, their achievements and mistakes, their victories and defeats in war.

The series also examines the Russian form of 'Caesarism' as a system of state administration - its advantages and drawbacks and how the Russian state changed under the Romanov's rule.

THE ROMANOVS is told in eight epic one-hour episodes using a unique combination of magnificent CGI animation and dramatic reconstruction with careful and accurate attention paid to each period.

CLF and MICA also collaborated to produce a film about sustainable food animal production entitled Out to Pasture: The Future of Farming? (34 minutes) CLF's Leo Horrigan plays the role of producer for Out to Pasture and Allen Moore, a MICA professor and independent filmmaker, directs the film. Out to Pasture contrasts industrial-style confined animal production with farms that raise food animals outdoors in diversified operations, striving to be sustainable.  Several of these pasture-based farmers are profiled and they tell their own vibrant stories of bucking the trends in farming. They discuss how they got started in farming (three transitioned from confinement operations), what's important about their farming methods, how their conventional-farm neighbors view them, how to keep young people on the farm, the future of the food system, and other compelling topics. The film also features Robert Lawrence, director of CLF; and John Ikerd, a leading thinker on sustainable agriculture issues.

However with over many years of indepth research taking in the worldâ€™s oldest, most enigmatic and beautiful sites from China to Peru, from Egypt to Mexico, a team of independent researchers has, at last, managed first to understand and then to reveal what lies behind this greatest of archaeological mysteries: a message of paramount importance for all mankind, through time and space.

With his new album, Ordinary Man, hitting the shelves, it's hard to believe he survived the chaos after so many years. 

Ozzy Osbourne started his career when Geezer Butler came knocking on his door at 14 Lodge Road, Aston, Birmingham in the mid-60s. Shortly after this, Bill Ward and Toni Iommi would also pay Ozzy a visit. Sometime later, the first-ever Heavy Metal band was formed, Black Sabbath.

Ozzy released his first solo record, Blizzard Of Ozz, in 1980 after forming a band with Randy Rhoads. Prior to this, he spent around 10 years on the road with Black Sabbath. 

This is Ozzy Osbourne, the Prince Of Darkness.

They are also money-making saviours to many outback stations in tough times.

Meet the Ferals looks at the devastating impact feral animals have on Australia's environment and agriculture and how farmers control introduced pests like cats, goats, pigs, rabbits and wild dogs.

Produced and presented by reporter Prue Adams, this series will focus on a different feral animal each episode. The content has been gathered from the three decades Landline has been on air, with background information and support provided through our Centre.

Ranchers who struggle to coexist with large predators are finding new hope in old dog breeds. While these Old World livestock guardian dog breeds have successfully defended livestock from predators for thousands of years in Europe and Asia, they remain relatively unknown in the American West. Explore how they work for one family, and what it means for the maintenance of large predators, like the wolf, on the landscape.

The purpose of this innovative short film is to start a new, universally-understood conversation around the necessity of struggle, challenge and perseverance as they relate to creating meaning in one's life - without one, you cannot have the other. The 500 Miles film communicates the importance of this concept by telling the story of the un-purposed wild mustang and the un-purposed veteran, following both as they learn to face and navigate challenges, with the ultimate goal of discovering what their greater purpose in life is. For these mustangs, the arduous 500 mile journey through New Mexico and Arizona was their purpose-defining challenge, but we all have our own version of a ""500 mile journey"". It's the moments in life when we choose to buck up instead of give up. When we choose to take the unbeaten path instead of the easy road. It's the moments that force us to take a hard look at ourselves, and the decisions we have been making, and decide if we have been letting life happen to us, or for us.

So, the question is: What's your 500?

They may help with general neck pain, neck spasms, tension headaches, or even that ole crick in the neck. This neck stretching routine is about 12 minutes. See more: http://www.askdoctorjo.com/neck-stretches-real-time

These neck pain stretches should be done with a 30 second hold, and do three on each side.

First start off with some gentle neck movements to warm up your muscles by turning your head from side to side like you are looking over your shoulder. This is neck rotation. Now you are going to take your ear to your shoulder on each side. Make sure you are not shrugging your shoulders up. This is side bending. Then you are going to bring your chin to your chest and then looking up towards the ceiling. This is neck flexion and extension. 

Next you will do a chin tuck. You donâ€™t want to tuck it down to your chest, but take your chin, and pull it backwards. You can put your finger on your chin, as a target or starting point, and then tuck it in. Hold it for about 3-5 seconds, and then relax. Do this about 3-5 times. 

Now place your hand under your thigh to keep your shoulder down, then side bend your head to the opposite side and gently put pressure with your other hand to get a stretch through your trapezius muscles. Hold these for 30 seconds and perform 3 times on each side.

The final stretch is going to be for your levator scapulae muscle. This is the muscle that is used when you shrug your shoulders, and they can get overworked when you are stressed out. Take your arm on the side of the pain and place it above and behind your shoulder. Then take your opposite arm and place on top and slightly behind your head. Look down towards the opposite knee of the pain and apply gentle pressure for a good stretch.

In 2008, Bolt broke his first world record in the 100 meters during the Olympics, and soon after, he broke the 200 meter world record with a time of 19.30 seconds.  The following year, Bolt struck again by breaking his own 100 and 200 meter world records (9.58 seconds and 19.19 seconds respectively).  In just 2 short years, Bolt rewrote the record books, however his career was far from over.

Following this early success, Bolt remained the best sprinter in the world for close to a decade, but which moment made Usain Bolt the absolute G.O.A.T (Greatest of All Time)?

In this video, we'll break down our pick for the moment that made Usain Bolt the undisputed GOAT of sprinting.

The race is a 102.9-mile ultramarathon with 20,000 feet of elevation gain, which is no small feat for a couple of guys who donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing.

Jayson had talked me into it, and if I were to be completely honest, Iâ€™d say we were there to test out his life philosophy, which is basically that you can do anything you dream up, as long as you put in the work and refuse to quit. That ethic has worked for him in almost every other area of life, despite growing up in poverty, one of six children with no father, and dyslexia.

In the six months leading up to the race, we figured since we werenâ€™t naturally talented runners, the best thing we could do is work hard. So we ran 50- to 70-mile weeks all summer, and went through a full range of feelings: fear, regret, sadness, FOMO, hunger, thirst, exhaustion, pain, and joy. And gluttony, which is not a feeling, but what happens after you run 20 or more miles. 

How did the race go? You can watch our film, How to Run 100 Miles, to find out. No spoilers here.

The first tip for if you are lying on your back or on your side is to make a small roll with a towel or extra sheet to help support the curve of your lumbar spine. Once you find the best spot for it, you can put it under the mattress sheet so it doesnâ€™t slide around while you sleep.

The next tip if for when you lie on your back. Take a few pillows and put them under your bent legs. This will help put your pelvis in a neutral position, and take pressure off your low back.

For lying on your side, place a pillow between your knees and legs. This will help put your hips in a neutral position so they donâ€™t slant downward putting pressure on your hips and knees. You can also get a pillow that has holes for your ears if you are a side sleeper. The helps take the pressure directly off your ears for a more comfortable sleep. 

Next, put a pillow up at your arms to â€œhug.â€<9d> This will help keep your shoulder in a comfortable position without it having so much stress on it. If you get too hot with the pillow, you can rest your arm on your side.

Finally, for stomach sleeping, you donâ€™t want to use a pillow because it will put too much stress on your neck.

By keeping your spine in a neutral position, no matter what position you sleep in, you will get a better nightâ€™s sleep.

Eluid Kipchoge, who just ran a sub2 marathon distance, is from Kenya and most of the marathon winners around the world. You can bet that at least one Kenyan will be on the podium of almost every marathon or race with prize money. As an extreme example, the first 17 men in Singapore Marathon last year were Kenyans. In this video, I share a day with junior and senior athletes at St. Patrick's Highschool in Iten, Kenya and 9 things that keep Kenyans fastest in the world. The youth running camp will go on until 26th of April. The camp produced numerous world champions, from Peter Rono, Wilson Kipketer, David Rudisha, Lornah Kiplagat, Edna Kiplagat, and Mary Keitany.

Tom Brady would have one last chance to drive his team to victory, but was intercepted in Colts territory, killing the drive and sending Indianapolis to the Super Bowl.

Hal Koerner, two time defending Western States champion, and running store entrepreneur from Ashland, Oregon. Geoff Roes, undefeated at the 100-mile distance, an organic chef from Juneau, Alaska. Anton Krupicka, undefeated in every ultramarathon he has ever started, a graduate student living in Boulder, Colorado. Kilian Jornet, the young mountain runner and two time Ultra-trail du Mont-Blanc champion, from Spain.

While their lives may be quite different, the goal is the same: win the Western States 100-mile run. A win will require breaking the course record and running the fastest time in the history of the race. An epic showdown ensues, from Squaw Valley, CA in Lake Tahoe, up though the high snow covered Sierra Nevada Mountains, down through the extreme heat of the American River Canyons and finishing in Auburn, CA.

Though all four are undefeated, three must break and only one can remain Unbreakable.

Facebook: Karel Sabbe Ultrarunning 

The Barkley Marathons - one of the world's toughest ultramarathons, has been held annually in the Frozen Head State Park, Tennessee, since 1987.
The race is so brutal that, since the inception of the race, only 15 people have managed to finish. Runners are to run five 20-mile loops, within a 60 hour time limit and with more than 20.000m of elevation change.
The course is unmarked, no electronic devices are allowed and most of the race is off-trail.

Out There - A journey to the Barkley Marathons is the story of Belgian ultrarunner Karel Sabbe, who holds the world records on two of the most epic trails in the world: the 4279km long Pacific Crest Trail and the 3500km long Appalachian Trail.

How did setting these world records prepare Karel for a race as brutal as ""the Barkley""? How did these adventures help Karel to find the necessary mindset to do well at this Spartan challenge?

Out There is a story of persistence, endurance and a passion for the great outdoors, and the film inspires the audience to reconnect with nature and to find courage for personal challenges.","2020-02-17T19:53:13.000Z","UC5VKEyHnZBSofbFj7xGI9WQ","Karel Sabbe","211849","4443","47","0","249","Sports"

The shoulder stretches are done in real time, so they are easy to follow. Buy a worksheet with these shoulder stretches: https://www.askdoctorjo.com/7-shoulder-stretches-worksheet

In general when stretching the shoulders, you should hold most stretches for 30 seconds, and do them 3 times. Sometimes you might not have enough time to go through your whole routine, which can be time consuming. If you are in a hurry, still hold the shoulder stretches for 30 seconds, but do less reps.

A quick warm up will help warm up and loosen the shoulder muscles to help get them going.

A great way to stretch the shoulder is by stretching out the joint capsule. You can stretch the posterior capsule or a cross arm stretch, and you can stretch the inferior capsule with a triceps stretch.

Also, stretching some of your rotator cuff muscles, like the subscapularis may help relieve the shoulder pain. If going into external rotation of your shoulder is painful, you can modify this stretch.

Finally, a chest or pec stretch and an upper trap stretch will help the shoulder and neck areas.

Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon are both extremely funny ladies, so what happens when you get them in a room together? You get one of the most hilarious rounds of ""Speak Out."" On Wednesday, Mila and Kate played the game with Ellen DeGeneres when they dropped by her show to promote their Summer comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me. Not only did they both have to wear hideous mouthguards, but the best part of it all was that Mila and Kate could barely get Ellen to guess anything because they were too busy laughing and drooling to get any of the words. In all fairness, you try saying, ""I love bean bag popping,"" with a mouthguard and let me know how that goes. Get ready to LOL, and watch the clip above now.","2019-02-02T02:05:24Z","UCpt1Y7_TDeJ7va7p7tUV8vw","M&V","1228203","14331","347","0","402","Sports"

That mark moved her to #2 All-Time, behind only Mary Cain, who went 9:04.51 in 2013.  The mark breaks the Ocean Breeze meet record, held by Kate Murphy (Lake Braddock), at 9:14.02.  It also breaks the overall Facility Record, previously set by Collegian Katrina Coogan (Georgetown), when she won the Big East Conference Championships in 9:07.44.  Coogan would go on to place third overall in the NCAA D1 Finals the following competition, in almost the same time.

In completing her race, Katelyn Tuohy also breaks the Sophomore National Record in the event, previously held by Kelsey Chmiel (Saratoga).  Chmiel set that mark of 9:26.28 at the State Championships held at Ocean Breeze last March.  Tuohy's mark converts to 9:45.34 for 3200m & 9:48.72 for the full 2-Mile.

Self-mastery is key in this exacting martial art, where the target is said to reflect the heart, and correct attitude and technique are seen as intertwined. We use a high-speed camera to track the path of a skilled archer's arrows as they fly through the air, shining a light on the depth and subtleties of kyudo's hidden techniques.","2018-06-09T11:50:29.000Z","UC_QBkd5KVh4MsSs3p8MRJwQ","White belt","4051158","22663","1982","0","2063","Sports"

Here are some of the rarest, luckiest, or most difficult to achieve of those plays


I need a new channel banner, someone please make me one

For those who don't get the premise of this video, these are plays that would only happen ""one in a million"" times, one in a million is sort of a figure of speech to mean something that is really rare or that wouldn't happen again if you repeated ""a million times""

The Turkey Valley High School graduate, who won nine state outdoor championships over four years and turned into one of the top 800 meter runners in the country, is headed to Baylor University on a full scholarship in 2018. Watch the feature above to learn about how Merrell embraced his small town roots and raced large over his career before finishing out with one final memento at the Texas UIL Class 1A State Championships.

After that first 1600m, the pace slowed from 71-seconds a lap to 75-seconds, but the blistering pace would be enough to snatch the record.  Tuohy charged down the backstretch to just dip under the previous National Record set by Kim Mortensen (Thouand Oaks, CA) at 9:48.59 back in 1996.  Tuohy crossed the White Plains finish line at 9:47.88, which also surpassed the converted 2Mile National Record set by Brie Oakley (Grandview, CO) last year, running a converted 9:47.92 at the Brooks PR Invitational.

Thanks to Guilherme (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqKjl-xepqcSTkJGR9pq_vQ) for taking us around Brazil. #Brazil #Amazon #AmazonFood

MANAUS, BRAZIL - During my food trip to Brazil there was no place I wanted to visit more than the Amazon Rainforest. We flew to Manaus (if you look at a map, Manaus is directly in the heart center of the Amazon). The jungle, the unique dishes and fruits, and the people made it incredible.

Exotic fruit tasting - One of the things that you have to do when youâ€™re in Brazil, especially in the Amazon is sample all the unique and indigenous fruits of the region, some that are only available there. We started with mari-mari, an amazing long pod fruit and have inga (ice cream bean fruit) and biribÃ¡ - wild sugar apple. All the fruit - 10 BRL ($2.55)

Manaus is a pretty big city, especially for being in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest. They have a big market, full of fruits, vegetables and fish. We headed straight for some tucumÃ£, a type of palm tree fruit thatâ€™s essential in the local diet.

Jenipapo - Along the way we also tried some jenipapo, a pretty unique fruit.

TucumÃ£ sandwiches - Sandwich shop owners better take note! TucumÃ£ sandwiches are a true Amazonian food and they are delicious. Along with the palm fruit they were paired with cheese and fried sweet banana. Itâ€™s a perfect breakfast and way to start the day in the Amazon. Price - about 10 BRL ($2.55) per sandwich

Tambaqui fish - Tambaqui is a fish from the Amazon thatâ€™s known for having ribs - seriously almost like pork ribs. We decided to get a fish to bring to the village since we werenâ€™t sure what theyâ€™d have al the village.

Amazon village - We didnâ€™t really have a plan, we were just going to find a boat driver and ask him to take us to a village and see if anyone could cool. So we got a boat, and our boat driver asked if they were home and if we could invite ourselves in. We arrived completely unplanned and unannounced and it turned out to be an outstanding learning experience and fun time with an amazing family in the Amazon.

Along with the food we brought, the family mixed up about 4 different exotic drinks - some of them known in the Western world as ingredients in trendy energy drinks - but here in the Amazon of Brazil they are consumed regularly.

It was such an awesome Brazilian Amazonian food meal with the family followed by a time of drumming and dancing, football, and finally a swim in the river. It was an extraordinary day in the Amazon of Brazil.

This is Mongolia like you've NEVER seen before! In our first episode we taste the real Mongolian BBQ known as ""Boodog"". A full goat cooked within itself using ancient nomadic recipes. This is the authentic Mongolian barbecue a dish traditional enjoyed during the long winter months. We had no idea what to expect going into this but what we saw amazed us. 

First we had a traditional meeting with the boodog master. After that we needed a goat for our BBQ so we headed to the hills surrounding the families ger to catch ourselves a sheep. We were told a brown sheep would produce the best final result. Once we had the goat the very particular process of preparing the animal for cooking was preformed by the boodog master. This was something hard to watch but thought provoking. Life here out here on the steppe is tough. Next stones were heated in a fire before finally filling the the goat hide full of its own meat and hot stones, layering with minimal ingredients. This is one of the most unique and rare cooking techniques we've ever witnessed. Once stuffed the goat was sealed and torched from the outside for about an hour non-stop.

It was time to eat! Enjoying this traditional BBQ in Mongolian with a true nomadic family was itself an experience, not to mention the food was delicious! Thank you once again to ARTGER for helping us pull this video off!

YOU determine the build on this episode, so be sure to comment and like with your thoughts and ideas!  On this Episode we take a in depth look at the 1972 Chevrolet Chevelle, and see just how bad the frame, and front end is.  Repairable, or is a frame swap in order?  We'll also try to nail down why the engine is running so poorly.  I'll also show  you how to determine what your engine is, quickly and easily.  After we get all the info, we'll try and figure out what kind of build to do.  We're thinking something like a burn out car for cleetus and cars, drag race, rally race, etc.  I've also gotten a lot of feedback from ya'll to start ""explaining"" things more in depth, so we'll take a little deeper dive this time!  Let me know your thoughts!

I bought this Chevrolet Chevelle site unseen and attempt to drive it 600+ miles home after being off the road for 30 years.  After selling my 1970 and 1971 Chevelle's the past few months, well I just needed another one.  They're not as popular right now as the Challenger, Charger, Mustang, or apparently even the Opel GT.  But, I really like the history of the car.   The body lines, style, and room.  So, I bought this abandoned 1972 Chevrolet Chevelle Malibu with no title, site unseen that was just left to rot.  The car is trashed, worse than stated in the ad, and certainly not road worthy when I show up.  From what I can tell it hasn't been on the road for 30 years.  But, that doesn't stop me from attempting a 600 mile drive back home.  Think it will start?  Or better yet, think it will actually run good enough to drive itself from the grave?

The series originated from Frog Baseball, a 1992 short film by Judge originally aired on Liquid Television. After seeing the short, MTV signed Judge to develop the concept. The series first ran from March 8, 1993, to November 28, 1997. The series was later renewed for an eighth season, which aired from October 27 to December 29, 2011. In 1996, the series was adapted into the animated feature film Beavis and Butt-Head Do America.

The show centers on two socially incompetent teenage delinquents, Beavis and Butt-Head (both voiced by Judge), who go to school at Highland High in Highland, Texas. They have no apparent adult supervision at home, are dim-witted, under-educated and barely literate. Both lack any empathy or moral scruples, even regarding each other. They will usually deem things they encounter as ""cool"" if they are associated with heavy metal, violence, sex, destruction or the macabre. While they have no experience with girls, the two share an obsession with sex, and tend to chuckle whenever they hear words or phrases that can even remotely be interpreted as sexual or scatological.

Each episode features frequent interstitial scenes in which they critique music videos using commentary improvised by Judge (in season eight, they also commented on clips from other MTV shows such as The Jersey Shore and True Life, plus shows from other Viacom-owned networks such as Spike). The remainder of the episodes depict the duo embarking on some kind of scheme or adventure.Their teachers at Highland High are often at a loss as to how to deal with them, and in many episodes, they skip school altogether. Their actions sometimes result in serious consequences, but often for others, for which they themselves show no remorse.","2018-07-02T02:33:51.000Z","UC9Pg1NZVnSf2eQpIiAugEKA","Unimportant Entertainment","1034665","15384","404","0","2589","Gaming"

The complex biology of dengue has for many years defeated vaccine researchers but now the first vaccine against the disease has been introduced and scientists are working to bring other innovations to fight its growing spread. 

The film features interviews with leading scientists and global health players as well as people who have firsthand experience of the disease in widespread geographical locations.

While documenting the history and science behind vaccine discovery, the film also tells the human stories: the daily struggle of medics in the frontline against the virus and the work of those involved in vector control.

Ranching Perspectives spends time with ten North Dakota families who understand this way of life, the life of the original rural business. But the complex issues ranchers face today are different than those their parents encountered. Ranchers manage the complex opportunities and challenges of runing a business with the added burden of the daily care and feeding of hundreds of large animals. They are grounded in traditions, yet must constantly modify their operations to meet the needs of a modern world. Get an eye-full of some of the most beautiful countryside in North Dakota while experiencing the ranching industry from a different perspective.

"254","22","WCV8a5WgdvM","PT33M3S","false","hd","Gavin Mcinnes' Greatest Hits - Compilation of the Honorary American Anti-Feminist","McInnes co-founded Vice in 1994 with Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi.His role as an editor at Vice led to him being referred to as ""the Godfather of hipsterdom"" and one of the ""primary architects of hipsterdom"". He occasionally contributed articles to Vice, including The VICE Guide to Happiness and The VICE Guide to Picking Up Chicks, and co-authored two Vice books: The Vice Guide to Sex and Drugs and Rock and Roll, and Vice Dos and Don'ts: 10 Years of VICE Magazine's Street Fashion Critiques. He left Vice in 2007 due to ""creative differences."" In a 2013 interview with The New Yorker, McInnes claimed his split with Vice was about the increasing influence of corporate advertising on Vice's content, stating that ""Marketing and editorial being enemies had been the business plan.""

McInnes later created the website StreetCarnage.com. He also co-founded an advertising agency called Rooster where he serves as creative director. He writes for the web magazine Taki's Magazine,[19] and TruthRevolt and once wrote for Death and Taxes,[21] The Federalist, and VDARE.

In 2009, McInnes convinced a journalist at The Village Voice that he had been knocked out after losing a challenge to an MMA fighter. The footage was actually an outtake from a failed TV pilot. In 2010, McInnes convinced a journalist at Gawker that he had eaten a bowl of urine-soaked corn flakes after not winning their â€œHipster of the Decadeâ€<9d> competition. The footage was actually an outtake from a collection of comedy sketches called Gavin McInnes Is a Fucking Asshole.

An occasional standup comedian, McInnes directed a documentary on his standup comedy tour in 2013's The Brotherhood of the Traveling Rants. For the film, McInnes faked a serious car accident. That same year, he published a book of cartoons entitled How to Piss in Public.

In 2010, McInnes was approached by Adult Swim and asked to play the part of Mick - an anthropomorphic Scottish soccer ball - in the short-lived Aqua Teen Hunger Force spin-off Soul Quest Overdrive.[30] After losing a 2010 pilot contest to Cheyenne Cinnamon and the Fantabulous Unicorn of Sugar Town Candy Fudge, six episodes of Soul Quest Overdrive were ordered, with four airing in Adult Swim's 4 AM DVR Theater block on May 25, 2011 before quickly being cancelled. McInnes jokingly blamed the show's cancellation on the other cast members (Kristen Schaal, David Cross, and H. Jon Benjamin) not being ""as funny"" as him.

In 2013, McInnes starred in the independent film How to Be a Man, which premiered at Sundance Next Weekend.[32] He has also played supporting roles in other films including 2010's Soul Quest Overdrive and 2015's Creative Control and One More Time.

McInnes was featured in Season 3 of the Canadian reality TV show Kenny vs Spenny, as a judge in the ""Who is Cooler?"" episode.

In October 2013, McInnes was interviewed by The Huffington Post on a panel about masculinity. He said that ""people would be happier if women would stop pretending to be men"", and that feminism ""has made women less happy"". He explained that ""Weâ€™ve trivialized childbirth and being domestic so much that women are forced to pretend to be men. Theyâ€™re feigning this toughness, theyâ€™re miserable."" A heated argument ensued with University of Miami School of Law professor Mary Anne Franks.

In August 2014, McInnes was asked to take an indefinite leave of absence as chief creative officer of Rooster, following online publication at Thought Catalog of an essay about transphobia entitled ""Transphobia is Perfectly Natural"" that sparked a call to boycott the company. In response, Rooster issued a statement, saying in part: ""We are extremely disappointed with his actions and have asked that he take a leave of absence while we determine the most appropriate course of action.""[37] McInnes defended the article by saying ""All I was saying was transsexuals have a huge suicide rate,"" and calling the reaction ""fake hysteria."" 

In June 2015, Anthony Cumia announced that McInnes will be hosting a show on his network, therefore retiring the Free Speech podcast. The Gavin McInnes Show premiered on Compound Media on June 15 and airs Monday through Thursday at 10:30 A.M EST.

McInnes is a contributor to Canadian conservative portal The Rebel Media and a regular on Fox News' Red Eye, The Greg Gutfield Show, and The Sean Hannity Show.","2016-08-21T20:01:18.000Z","UCs1oxu3K1DcEWJGSuU4qh1g","Kek Wills It","1683333","21156","1203","0","3387","People & Blogs"

These surprising tacticsâ€”which radically diverge from conventional negotiating strategyâ€”werenâ€™t cooked up in a classroom, but are the field-tested tools FBI agents used to talk criminals and hostage-takers around the world into (or out of) just about any scenario you can imagine. 

In NEVER SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It, former FBI lead international kidnapping negotiator Chris Voss breaks down these strategies so that anyone can use them in the workplace, in business, or at home.

Basically ten, 1/2 acre paddocks set with two simple strands of electric wire and a couple of moveable wooden gates. Check out more videos like this, HERE: http://bit.ly/PermaculturePigsCourse

In this video, he explains his 5-acre system that could multiply upwards OR be scaled down. 

So hereâ€™s whatâ€™s possible for youâ€¦ 

In Joelâ€™s example, heâ€™s running 35 pigs over 5 acres. 
Thatâ€™s seven pigs per acre. 

Say you want to run 2-3 pigs, then you only 1/2 acre! 

And itâ€™s only gonna take a bare minimum of infrastructure. Like two strands of electric fencing, simple fence posts, an energizer, a waterer, and a feeder. Thatâ€™s it. 

Oh, and you donâ€™t even own the land. Actually, the land we showcase in this video is LEASED land! Joel doesnâ€™t even own it and heâ€™s bringing in well over 100,000 a year from this pastured pork operation. 

Throw out your ideas of fancy fences and barns and bring on the simple life. 

So clear an hour in your schedule and Watch Joal Salatin Teach His Pastured Pig model. You wonâ€™t regret it.

In this video, I show you and prove to myself that you can grow a new onion bulb simply by cutting off the inch at the base of a regular onion bulb and sticking it either in water, or directly into moist soil.

Most people know about this trick with green onions, but to be able to do this from just a regular onion bulb?  That's a game changer!  No more seeds or onion sets for this guy!

**UPDATE**
Check out the 5-part vlog where I'm documenting in real-time the process of re-growing your own onion bulbs from existing onion slices!: https://youtu.be/k3IaAtZBb9Q

I was born a freckled child in a land far away during a much simpler time. I did well in school until it counted. As a freshman in high school I had dreams of going to Notre Dame and becoming a lawyer. By the time I was sophomore I was taking shop class and was considering getting into construction. I ended up working in warehousing and unloading trucks. Other than stand up, that job was the most fun I ever had. 

I am now a stand up comedian. I do a couple hundred shows a year. And I enjoy the travel. Iâ€™ve done four hour-long stand-up specials: â€œWhy Do I Do Thisâ€<9d>, â€œLet It Goâ€<9d>, â€œYou People Are All The Sameâ€<9d> and â€œIâ€™m Sorry You Feel That Way.â€<9d> I host a podcast each week called The Monday Morning Podcast. And I have an animated series on Netflix called: â€˜Fâ€™ Is For Family.â€™ Occasionally I act in movies but only when they let me.","2020-04-24T16:37:09.000Z","UCAp990eMLzmei84WNR4ptgA","Bill Burr","94906","1148","162","0","440","Comedy"

I was born a freckled child in a land far away during a much simpler time. I did well in school until it counted. As a freshman in high school I had dreams of going to Notre Dame and becoming a lawyer. By the time I was sophomore I was taking shop class and was considering getting into construction. I ended up working in warehousing and unloading trucks. Other than stand up, that job was the most fun I ever had. 

I am now a stand up comedian. I do a couple hundred shows a year. And I enjoy the travel. Iâ€™ve done four hour-long stand-up specials: â€œWhy Do I Do Thisâ€<9d>, â€œLet It Goâ€<9d>, â€œYou People Are All The Sameâ€<9d> and â€œIâ€™m Sorry You Feel That Way.â€<9d> I host a podcast each week called The Monday Morning Podcast. And I have an animated series on Netflix called: â€˜Fâ€™ Is For Family.â€™ Occasionally I act in movies but only when they let me.","2020-04-03T21:36:18.000Z","UCAp990eMLzmei84WNR4ptgA","Bill Burr","267400","3600","293","0","1086","Comedy"

3 Cloves of Garlic (Squashed)
A Spoonful of Minorâ€™s Chicken (Or Vegetable) Base 
Good Parmesan Cheese 
 
Recipe -
 
1. Boil a pot of water with a little salt. 
2. Add the pasta to the boiling water for about 8 minutes. 
3. While the pasta is cooking, begin your sauce by blending the cannellini beans. Try not to cut your finger.
4. Take 3 cloves of garlic, squash them, remove from the skin, and place them in a pot over medium-low heat with a little olive oil. If you want to get fancy, you can tilt the pot and place the garlic in the olive oil to infuse the flavor and really get the garlic lightly golden. If the garlic browns, throw it away and start over. 
5. Stir the pasta and make sure it isnâ€™t sticking to the bottom
6. Once the garlic is golden, remove it from the pot (optional), add the blended cannellini beans, and add a spoonful of the Minorâ€™s chicken (or vegetable) base. Stir everything together.
7. When the pasta is ready, drain it in a colander, put the pasta back into the large pot, and add the cannellini bean sauce. Mix it all up.
8. Serve with GOOD parmesan cheese. Itâ€™s good for your life.","2020-04-15T12:58:02.000Z","UCa6vGFO9ty8v5KZJXQxdhaw","Jimmy Kimmel Live","1291944","27436","610","0","2802","Comedy"

â–ºNEW MERCH: https://www.drewgoodenshop.com/

An entire episode of Friends without any dialogue:
https://twitter.com/drewisgooden/status/991002342005919744

I think we can all agree that laugh tracks are terrible. They're obnoxious, unnecessary, and an obvious waste of time- but exactly how much time? How much of an average episode of a sitcom like Friends is JUST laughter? That's the question I attempt to answer in this video.

This video was one I've been slowly writing for a few months, and one I had a ton of fun making. I know it's very different than anything I've put on this channel so I'm hoping you guys are on board. As you can probably tell, this was heavily inspired by the style of nerdwriter1 (https://youtu.be/3hZ_ZyzCO24), one of my personal favorite youtubers.

It's a weird video because it combines comedy and math- two things that are very different. But if you've followed me on here for a while, you know that math is a strangely consistent theme in a lot of my videos. For some reason a love of statistics is deeply ingrained in my brain and there's just nothing you can do to change that so stop trying please.

Comment whatever feedback you'd like.

SNL has been on the air since the beginning of time; long before television was even invented. But... is the show good? Depending on who you ask, you'll get drastically different answers. Here's my opinion.

My favorite SNL sketches of the past few years:

There were some other folks there too which is commendable, but in re-watching the footage, Robin was the only one to go out of his way to say hi to us, plus he's one of the most amazing people our planet has been graced with. RIP. I know the Marines at Heaven's gate will snap a salute for you.

NOTE: This was filmed with what passed for digital quality in 2004. The sound quality is not the greatest, and sometimes the laughing and yelling get loud, piercing even. But if you're complaining about the troops being too loud and happy while they're spending Christmas in Iraq, I've got nothin' for you.","2017-03-02T09:21:28.000Z","UCL1ZV-W2Oz1Fi6nEvJBm6WA","aleckirstein","390264","5206","200","0","447","Comedy"

Born With a Defect takes the audience on a wild ride through Titus' personal life, proves why he isnâ€™t qualified to be a father, and why childless couples win. Titus again takes you down some roads that may be unlikely to win him a CNN Heroes' Award, but will always be hilarious. His reasoning as to why owning a Lamborghini is better than having children, along with more of his beloved dysfunctional personal anecdotes, will have you clutching your sides with laughter. This is some of his most surprising material to date, and Christopher Titus again shows in his seventh ninety-minute special why he is one of the best comics working today.

I was born a freckled child in a land far away during a much simpler time. I did well in school until it counted. As a freshman in high school I had dreams of going to Notre Dame and becoming a lawyer. By the time I was sophomore I was taking shop class and was considering getting into construction. I ended up working in warehousing and unloading trucks. Other than stand up, that job was the most fun I ever had.

I am now a stand up comedian. I do a couple hundred shows a year. And I enjoy the travel. Iâ€™ve done four hour-long stand-up specials: â€œWhy Do I Do Thisâ€<9d>, â€œLet It Goâ€<9d>, â€œYou People Are All The Sameâ€<9d> and â€œIâ€™m Sorry You Feel That Way.â€<9d> I host a podcast each week called The Monday Morning Podcast. And I have an animated series on Netflix called: â€˜Fâ€™ Is For Family.â€™ Occasionally I act in movies but only when they let me.","2017-10-06T16:49:10Z","UCAp990eMLzmei84WNR4ptgA","Bill Burr","48337","534","40","0","154","Comedy"

"498","23","-HpBHWUPa8Q","PT59M27S","true","hd","Stephen Colbert: ""America Again: Re-Becoming the Greatness We Never Weren't"" | Talks at Google","The uncut interview of Stephen Colbert's visit to Google's New York office. You can find Stephen's book on Google Play here: http://goo.gl/Jyujo .

America Again: Re-Becoming the Greatness We Never Weren't is more of a coffee-table book, with large color pictures, and chapter photos that require the use of included 3-D glasses. It falls somewhere between I Am America and the Daily Show faux-textbooks America (The Book) and Earth (The Book), which used that organizing principle to their advantage. The premise follows the many apocalyptic views of the past four years, claiming America has gone off the rails and completely lost its way, and that only this book offers the true path to restore America's greatness. Which was never really gone, because it's America.

The best idea America Again mocks is the one contained in its title. In particular, it skewers Newt Gingrich's 2011 book A Nation Like No Other, which claimed, ""America's exceptional greatness is not based on that fact that we are the most powerful, most prosperousâ€”and most generousâ€”nation on earth. Rather, those things are the result of American Exceptionalism."" That is one preposterously arrogant whopper, which America Again exploits as an illogical chicken/egg position. The subtle difference between a beneficial amount of pride and the unchecked belief in exceptionalism is ripe for mockery.

Stephen Colbert has been playing Stephen T. Colbert since 2005. In those seven years, he's built an impressive mythology to his character, a funhouse mirror held up to shame all other egomaniacal pundits for their hubris. But while the shtick is still reliably funny on television, it doesn't translate as well into print, because a book doesn't have television's immediacy. There's no Super PAC plotline, just a bunch of chapters that respond to issues a bit too late. Colbert and his staff are still extraordinarily funny, but in reaching for a middle-of-the-road coffee table humor book, America Again finds the limits of their comedic talent.

A skit featuring the New York subway opens the show, then Whoopi introduces him with her own edgy and political standup, covering everything from race relations to Rudy Giuliani's marriage to his cousin.  Connolly's standup is utterly hilarious, naughty, sophomoric, and insightful.  I still laugh as hard as my first viewing three decades ago!  HBO opener included for maximum nostalgia.

I was born a freckled child in a land far away during a much simpler time. I did well in school until it counted. As a freshman in high school I had dreams of going to Notre Dame and becoming a lawyer. By the time I was sophomore I was taking shop class and was considering getting into construction. I ended up working in warehousing and unloading trucks. Other than stand up, that job was the most fun I ever had. 

I am now a stand up comedian. I do a couple hundred shows a year. And I enjoy the travel. Iâ€™ve done four hour-long stand-up specials: â€œWhy Do I Do Thisâ€<9d>, â€œLet It Goâ€<9d>, â€œYou People Are All The Sameâ€<9d> and â€œIâ€™m Sorry You Feel That Way.â€<9d> I host a podcast each week called The Monday Morning Podcast. And I have an animated series on Netflix called: â€˜Fâ€™ Is For Family.â€™ Occasionally I act in movies but only when they let me.","2020-04-20T19:41:13.000Z","UCAp990eMLzmei84WNR4ptgA","Bill Burr","136958","1613","263","0","789","Comedy"

I was born a freckled child in a land far away during a much simpler time. I did well in school until it counted. As a freshman in high school I had dreams of going to Notre Dame and becoming a lawyer. By the time I was sophomore I was taking shop class and was considering getting into construction. I ended up working in warehousing and unloading trucks. Other than stand up, that job was the most fun I ever had.

I am now a stand up comedian. I do a couple hundred shows a year. And I enjoy the travel. Iâ€™ve done four hour-long stand-up specials: â€œWhy Do I Do Thisâ€<9d>, â€œLet It Goâ€<9d>, â€œYou People Are All The Sameâ€<9d> and â€œIâ€™m Sorry You Feel That Way.â€<9d> I host a podcast each week called The Monday Morning Podcast. And I have an animated series on Netflix called: â€˜Fâ€™ Is For Family.â€™ Occasionally I act in movies but only when they let me.","2017-11-03T22:02:30.000Z","UCAp990eMLzmei84WNR4ptgA","Bill Burr","57039","660","51","0","208","Comedy"

The former small-time hustler has been busting his ass on the continent for years, selling and moving merchandise. In 2012 he nabbed a lucrative United Nations contract to transport equipment from South Africa to South Sudan, a country on many countries' embargo list. The other problem: the journey north entails passing through countless checkpoints and dealing with bribe-happy officials and their nonsensical paperwork and regulations.

Photographer and filmmaker Tim Freccia followed around Ian and the guys he hired for this job. ""Cowboy Capitalists"" documents their attempts to navigate the continent's dangerous roads and bureaucratic chaos.

Lani left ranching in 1986 during economic hard times and a cattle market low and moved to Colorado to manage ranches. She worked in the oilfield for a short time, then returned to finish college, earning the following degrees:

    Associate of Applied Science degree in Environmental Restoration from Mesa State College in Grand Junction, Colorado
    Bachelor of Science degree in Biology/Botany from MSC;
    Masters of Science degree in Weed Science from Colorado State University in Ft. Collins, Colorado

Ms. Malmberg became interested in goats as a graduate student at Colorado State University in Fort Collins. While completing her masterâ€™s degree she studied the use of goats for environmentally friendly, chemical-free land restoration.

In 1997 she bought her first goats and has been grazing them for non-toxic land care since. The rest is history.","2017-06-08T19:37:40Z","UC09EOrkBbtfGnUs24GlF4GA","Channel Q.","53930","545","8","0","53","Entertainment"

Since then, heâ€™s climbed Mount Everest in his shorts, resisted altitude sickness, completed a marathon in the Namib Desert with no water and proven under a laboratory setting that heâ€™s able to influence his autonomic nervous system and immune system at will.

Almost everything Wim has done was previously thought to be impossible - but heâ€™s not a freak of nature.

To demonstrate that any human can learn his methods, Wim offered to teach Matt Shea and Daisy-May Hudson to climb a freezing cold mountain in their shorts without getting cold. But when Matt and Daisy signed up for the training, they had no idea that the so-called Iceman was planning to lead them on a psychedelic journey across Europe that circled the chasm between science, spirituality and mystery.

The Trump family is constantly making headlines, especially with a lot of the patriarch, President Donald Trump's political antics. The press might be making a circus out of topics such as the border wall, possible Russian collusion, Melania's previous modeling career, and many other controversial subjects about the Trump clan, but Tiffany Trump has managed to grow up to becoming a stunning and surprising woman on her own. What does Tiffany & Co. and the Trump family have in common? They both have an insatiable love for diamonds, which is why Donald Trump and second wife Marla Maples decided to name their daughter in 1993. 

Marla Maples may have taken daughter Tiffany Trump over to the west coast after her marriage with Donald Trump ended, Tiffany grew up with a much quieter life away from the spotlight. Though she did end up going living to the family legacy by attending the University of Pennsylvania. Ultimately, Tiffany embraced some of her fame as she's becoming a social media starlet among her peers, such as Kyra Kennedy, Andrew Warren, and Gaia Jacquet-Matisse. While trying to keep a low profile, Tiffany did speak on her father's behalf at the Republican National Convention. Want to know something even more surprising? She's friends with Lindsay Lohan!

In this episode of VICELANDâ€™s Big Night Out, Clive Martin investigates how the young are evading patrols and curfews through the illegal party scene in what is currently Europe's only active war zone.

From foam parties only miles from the frontline, to being taught a traditional dance by the Russian militia, this is clubbing like you've never seen it before.

"635","24","OK0XDY5YNZc","PT3M48S","true","hd","How Sandra Lee Really Feels About Ex Andrew Cuomo","While they may no longer be together, TV chef Sandra Lee and New York governor Andrew Cuomo still have quite the close bond. Cuomo has been on the news a lot lately as he manages the coronavirus pandemic in his state, and Lee has been following the coverage closely.

In an interview published on April 10th, Lee told the New York Times,

""You know, nobody has a daily routine right now. I get up and I see what the latest news is. Of course I watch Andrew live, and then share with him my thoughts.""

The couple split up in September 2019 after 14 years together, but their friendship endures. Lee revealed that she hasn't seen anyone since splitting up with Cuomo, telling the Times,

""He's still my guy. Neither one of us, well as far as I know, has had a date.""

Lee is also on good terms with Cuomo's daughters, and is helping one of them, Cara, who is assisting her father with coronavirus relief. Lee is doing her part by rounding up donors of personal protective equipment and hand sanitizer. The former Food Network star said, 

""They're my family, and they always will be my family. We share a home, we share children, we share friendship. I will protect him and be there for him until the day I die.""

Lee is currently sheltering in place in Los Angeles, where she is filming a cooking series for Today from the safety of her own kitchen. Cuomo, for his part, is just as supportive of his ex as she is of him. While he was unavailable for comment, a representative did share a statement with the Times: 

""The Governor wishes her well in her next endeavor and we're sure it will be a success.""

Lee and Cuomo have been through a lot together over the years. In 2015, Lee was diagnosed with cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. In a speech at the Miami Breast Cancer Conference, she explained why she chose to undergo the procedure instead of fighting the cancer with radiation. Lee's grandmother had breast cancer which went into remission after radiation, but it returned years later. Lee said at the conference,

""I wasn't going to count the percentages every year; I wasn't going to live my life wondering when and if, and so I made a very clear decision.""

Cuomo was right at her side throughout the whole ordeal. He told People magazine at the time,

""This is about her feeling secure and loved."" 

Both Cuomo and Lee were married before finding each other. Lee was married to former chief executive of KB Home, Bruce Karatz. Cuomo's ex-wife is Kerry Kennedy, daughter of Robert F. Kennedy.

The couple met at a party in 2005 and remained devoted to each other for the next 14 years. Their relationship allegedly grew tense after Lee became more outspoken and became an advocate for cancer screening after her mastectomy. 

Cuomo's office and a spokesperson for Lee, however, denied that Lee becoming more political caused friction in their relationship. The spokesperson, Dawn Schneider, told the Times.

""Sandra has long believed that the world needs to make more space for love and peace and less strife and anguish. Her values and public profile are in no ways at odds with the governor.""

It seems that Lee and Cuomo still have a special connection, so why exactly did the two break up? In a statement released by the Times last September, the couple claimed that they had simply drifted apart romantically. It read, in part,

""Over the recent past, we have realized that our lives have gone in different directions and our romantic relationship has turned into a deep friendship. We will always be family and are fully supportive of each other and dedicated to the girls. Our personal lives remain personal and there will be no further comment.""

Rumors of a breakup had been swirling for a while, as Lee had been spending more and more time in Los Angeles taking care of her sick aunt and uncle. The couple had also put their home up for sale months before their breakup was announced. Lee has since relocated to Malibu. Watch the video to learn How Sandra Lee Really Feels About Ex Andrew Cuomo!

How did Jason's drama with his Hawaiian father turn out to be a motivating factor for Momoa becoming such a caring dad?

And what drives Jason really MAD about his 12-year-old daughter?

We will give all the answers in our video about Jason Momoa kids and family. 

Moma children are growing up with a set of pretty strict rules. Turns out that Momoa wife, Lisa Bonet is a boss at home. Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet are married for more than 12 years now and have 3 children together. Lisa Bonet's husband is a great dad not only to his blood kids. Momoa and Zoe Kravitz are actually pretty good pals and even have matching tattoos. 

Lisa Bonet and Lenny Kravitz have one daughter and now Lisa Bonet and Zoe Kravitz are living together with other Lisa Bonet kids from Jason Momoa. The actor went through different periods in his life. From being known for his sweet role in Baywatch to his upcoming role as a real macho man in DC's Aquaman 2.

In the documentary named Canvas of Life, Jason is telling the story of his fatherhood. And even though his life has changed, 'Canvas Momoa' is something the actor still believes in. The biggest Jason Momoa news after his success with Justice League's Aquaman is probably the fact that his daughter is starting dating. 

From an interview with Jason Momoa 2020 with Kelly Clarkson, it turned out that Momoa is actually a strict dad. Even though he allows his kids to learn skate, climbing, and even riding motorbikes, he can't imagine that he would allow his daughter to date. Watch out the video to discover more about Jason Momoa family.

Even though Kim is under house arrestâ€”since he's at the center of history's largest copyright caseâ€”he's still able to visit a recording studio in Auckland. So check out this brand new documentary we made at Kim's mega-mansion and in the studio where our host, Tim Pool, got to lay down some backup vocals for Kim's upcoming EDM album while talking about online surveillance, file-sharing, and Kim's controversial case.

The event went on to become a viral meme. Harnessing the sensational momentum, the storming event was transformed into a music festival that was set to take place in the rural town of Rachel, Nevada. 

Power struggles behind the scenes, however, created chaos and confusion for both the media and those who wanted to attend. 

VICE producers Zeke Spector and Dan Zabludovsky documented their process of trying to gain access to the event and their attempt to make sense of how an Internet entity can affect people in the real world.

But what is behind the scenes of their enduring romance?  Why does Tom Hanks advise not to get married before 30? And Was Rita Wilson the reason Tom left his first wife?

Tom Hanks met Rita Wilson on the set while he was still married to Samantha Lewes, the mother of his older kids Colin and Elizabeth Ann. 

Tom and Rita fell in love and tied the knot a year after Hanks finalized his divorce. Wilson gave Tom the family he never had and the couple welcomed two sons together: Chester ""Chet"" Marlon and Truman Theodore.

Tom Hanks credits his wife for his acting success, namely for Philadelphia and Forrest Gump Oscars.  Hanks and Wilson starred alongside each other in Sleepless in Seattle and Larry Crowne. They also co-produced My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Mama Mia! and sequels to both movies.

When Rita Wilson was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2015, Hanks was incredibly supportive to her.  And in 2020 the couple was amongst the first celebrities who tested positive for COVID-19. 

Wilson is also known as a country singer and songwriter. Her latest fourth album Halfway To Home was released in March 2019.

Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson's secret is simple: marry the right person and keep that flame going. Do you like this couple?

She starts by following The L.A.Times' homeless data map, and sets out to have conversations with people who do not have homes. Since October, Biagiotti has been learning about their varied experiences and connecting their stories to larger issues. Along the way, she gains input and insights from Angelenos.

Ever since Donald Trump was sworn into office, the First Lady seems to have maintained a frown just as her fierce as her fashion. From dodging her husband's hand, to sequestering herself in her gold-encrusted New York City penthouse long after he moved to Washington, it's unclear if this first couple actually like each other at all. While she's private, dignified, and reserved, he's the kind of guy that boasts about groping women and antagonizes foreign dictators on social media. Sure, opposites attract, especially with millions of dollars on the line, but is that enough? These are Donald and Melania Trump's most cringe-worthy moments...

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA TO KICK OFF SEASON 7 OF
 
JERRY SEINFELD'S 
COMEDIANS IN CARS GETTING COFFEE

President Barack Obama will be Jerry Seinfeld's first guest when the seventh season of his online talk show, ""Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,"" opens Dec. 30.
The show features the New York comedian picking up fellow comics in classic cars and taking them out for coffee and conversation.
Obama and Seinfeld spoke at the White House earlier this month. The White House says they took turns circling the South Lawn in a 1963 Corvette Stingray split window coupe before chatting over coffee in a basement dining room. They spoke about what makes White House life both remarkable and routine.
The appearance is another example of Obama trying to appeal to new audiences.

There are a lot of aspects of Donald Trump's personal life that have made headlines during the course of his administration, but his ways of displaying affinity for eldest daughter Ivanka Trump may be the most unusual. Unlike his other children, Donald Trump has given Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner official positions in the West Wing, which means the scrutiny surrounding their personal history is even more heightened. Not only are there several photos of them together in positions that are not typical for a father and a daughter, but Donald Trump has also publicly spoken of her in terms that many find to be totally inappropriate. Here are just some of the times Donald Trump acted inappropriately when it came to how he treated Ivanka...

Accordingly, the producers insist that no one try to recreate or re-enact any stunt or activity performed in this film.

We've admired the pioneering work of Wim Hof for years now from afar. This January however we got an opportunity to spend four days with him in the mountains of Poland. We didn't know what to expect. We had no idea that Wim was at a place in his life where he wanted to push his findings to the next level....we had no clue that we were his experiments in proving just how powerful the mind is.

If you want to learn more about Wim's method, go visit:
https://www.wimhofmethod.com

Thank you to Wim (@iceman_hof) and Enahm Hof (@enahm_hof) for making this possible and for letting us into their lives.

Thank you to our incredible producer Sky Cowans (@skycowans)  You can check out her amazing video on how this crazy adventure came together and more on her personal experience here: http://bit.ly/SkysVideo

Check out Colin and Samir's amazing BTS video!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enbVsRjRBSY

Thank you to the amazing men behind the camera who captured the whole thing, Andreas Hem (@andreeashem), Matt Komo (@mattjkomo) and Max Rantz-Macdonald (@livetothemax).

A huge thank you to our badass team of editors and partners who crunched this documentary down in 5 days...that shit is unheard of. Our very own Thomas Dajer (@thomasdajer) and Colin and Samir (@colinandsamir).

How did Jason's drama with his Hawaiian father turn out to be a motivating factor for Momoa becoming such a caring dad?

And what drives Jason really MAD about his 12-year-old daughter?

We will give all the answers in our video about Jason Momoa kids and family. 

Moma children are growing up with a set of pretty strict rules. Turns out that Momoa wife, Lisa Bonet is a boss at home. Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet are married for more than 12 years now and have 3 children together. Lisa Bonet's husband is a great dad not only to his blood kids. Momoa and Zoe Kravitz are actually pretty good pals and even have matching tattoos. 

Lisa Bonet and Lenny Kravitz have one daughter and now Lisa Bonet and Zoe Kravitz are living together with other Lisa Bonet kids from Jason Momoa. The actor went through different periods in his life. From being known for his sweet role in Baywatch to his upcoming role as a real macho man in DC's Aquaman 2.

In the documentary named Canvas of Life, Jason is telling the story of his fatherhood. And even though his life has changed, 'Canvas Momoa' is something the actor still believes in. The biggest Jason Momoa news after his success with Justice League's Aquaman is probably the fact that his daughter is starting dating. 

From an interview with Jason Momoa 2020 with Kelly Clarkson, it turned out that Momoa is actually a strict dad. Even though he allows his kids to learn skate, climbing, and even riding motorbikes, he can't imagine that he would allow his daughter to date. Watch out the video to discover more about Jason Momoa family.

The inmates? Drug traffickers, rapists, cartel killers. They have tough times ahead. They hardly get to leave their cells. They sleep, eat, pee, all in a very confined space. Two square meters each â€“ for up to eight inmates.
La Mesa is ruled with an iron fist â€“ and for good reason. Its story is infamous. Cartel bosses used to rule this place which was full of drugs, prostitution and violence. Another bleak chapter followed â€“ times of riots and fatalities. Nowadays, La Mesa is carefully controlled. Inmates are separated and locked away. 

Like cartel killer Francisco Javier Villa Padilla, sentenced for murdering police officers. After killing his victims, he hung their bodies from a bridge. He has been in La Mesa for seven years. Every day, he trains in his tiny cell. He knows that when he gets out, killers will be after him.
The American Taylor Elliott Howard was sentenced for car theft and possession of a weapon. He shares a cell with six fellow countrymen. Americans in a Mexican prison? Treated like scum. Every day, Taylor hopes to somehow survive the next nine years. And rustle up some money. In La Mesa, inmates have to pay for everything â€“ even toilet paper.
In charge of the place? Director Cesar Daniel Acevedo. La Mesa is the sixth Mexican prison he has tried to sort out. Every day he does everything to ensure that the inmates donâ€™t gain control of La Mesa again.

Follow us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/intelligence2/
Follow us on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/intelligencesquared/

America has never seen anything like this. Time and again, Donald Trump has attacked the very fabric of US democracy. He has called the press â€˜the enemy of the American peopleâ€™. He says that claims that Russia interfered in the US election are a hoax. And that the FBI - currently investigating his campaign - should be personally loyal to the president.

And itâ€™s not just political institutions Trump is damaging, his opponents say: in America he has stoked racial tension, coddled Wall Street and given succour to the gun lobby. On the world stage, heâ€™s alienated key allies, slapped $50 billion in tariffs on China that may spark off a trade war, and appointed the hawkish John Bolton, who has advocated regime change in Iran and North Korea, as national security adviser.

If Trump is a new kind of threat, the big question is whether the damage he is doing to America will be permanent. Will the country that survived two world wars, the Cold War and the attacks of 9/11 really be put off its stride by a reality show host who could be gone in less than three yearsâ€™ time? Or is Trump dismantling the robust system that has kept America united and irreparably damaging its standing as the most powerful nation on earth?

But perhaps this is all liberal hand-wringing. Could Trump, in fact, be that rarest of things - a politician who delivers on his promises - and prove to be the reformer the American electorate voted for?

To examine the political health and standing of the United States at this crucial moment, Intelligence Squared brought together Ronan Farrow, former US government adviser and journalist, who has just been awarded the Pulitzer Prize for breaking the Harvey Weinstein scandal; Mark Lilla, the American political scientist who hit the headlines last year with an article arguing that it is the leftâ€™s preoccupation with identity politics that opened the door to Trumpâ€™s victory; Lionel Shriver, award-winning novelist and commentator; and Brian Klaas, an expert on authoritarianism who claims that with every autocratic tweet Trump is edging America away from its democratic norms.","2018-09-20T11:02:57.000Z","UCaqcvH8EvUtePORpN03jLMg","Intelligence Squared","489404","3800","863","0","2931","News & Politics"

A month ago, we interviewed Dr. Jay Bhattacharya just as the COVID-19 crisis was shuttering the economy and governments were ordering citizens to shelter at home. In that interview, Dr. Bhattacharya mentioned that he himself would soon be conducting tests for COVID-19 in Santa Clara County, California, one of the most active hotspots in the country. Today Dr. Bhattacharya returns to discuss the results of that study and one currently under way in partnership with Major League Baseball. We also discuss some signs of hope, and specifics about how the economy can be restarted safely and efficiently. Dr. Bhattacharya also gives some (unsolicited) advice to Dr. Anthony Fauci, California governor Gavin Newsom, and president Donald Trump.

In this interview we have an in depth discussion with Marxist economist, author and co-founder of Democracy at Work Richard D. Wolff about the U.S. healthcare approach to the coronavirus and its economic implications. Furthermore we examine the U.S medical industrial complex, globalisation and the role financialization has played on healthcare. We also talk about whether government intervention can lead to distortions in the economy and even authoritarianism. Additionally, we discuss whether the concept of democracy at work can function during imminent crises such as the recent pandemic. Lastly, Wolff provides his opinion on Bernie Sanders endorsing Joe Biden and voting for the lesser of two evils.

Todayâ€™s episode features an analysis (part 1) of how, why capitalism - especially in US - failed to prepare for or cope with a virus thereby enabling it to trigger another crash of capitalism (third this century: dot.com in 2000, sub-prime mortgage in 2008). In part 2, Prof. Wolff provides an analysis of  how to respond to crash better than the US govt by emphasizing re-employment in millions of new jobs rather than unemployment, emphasizing worker-coops, etc.

Almost 800 men have been held at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility since it was established in 2002. Today, fewer than 150 remain. Despite the fact that more than half of current detainees have been cleared for transfer from the base, and in spite of the executive order signed by President Barack Obama in 2009 ordering the closure of the prison within one year, there's no indication it will be shuttered anytime soon.

VICE News traveled to Guantanamo to find out what the hell is going on. After a tightly controlled yet bizarre tour of the facility, we sought out a former detainee in Sarajevo and a former guard in Phoenix to get their unfiltered impressions of what life is like at Gitmo.

Douglas Irwin is the John French Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College. He is the author of a number of books, including the definitive history of American trade policy, Clashing over Commerce. In this sheltering at home edition of Uncommon Knowledge, we delve deep into the issues around the Trump administrationâ€™s imposition of huge tariffs on goods from China and elsewhere, and the impact of a health crisis that has businesses across the country re-examining their investments abroad. Also, whatâ€™s the right way to think about international trade? Is free trade still the best policy? We get deep into the weeds of the issues around imports and exports with Professor Irwin.

Join us as we explore the unexpected journeys to success of some of the worldâ€™s most influential stars.

First up? None other than Trevor Noah, host of 'The Daily Show' on Comedy Central. If youâ€™ve read his memoir, Born a Crime, you know that the famed, mixed-race comedian grew up under apartheid in South Africa, where being mixed race was indeed a crime. Luckily for him, he had a strong parental figure to shield him.

Be sure to tune into OZY and PBS on Friday for revelations on how Noahâ€™s mother, Patricia, escaped death not once, but twice. Watson and Noah discuss the abuse Patricia faced at the hands of her second husband, and her miraculous recovery from a gunshot to the head.

But this fiercest of moms â€” Noah once told Oprah Winfrey that he was merely his motherâ€™s â€œpunk-ass sidekickâ€<9d> â€” also faced down a Black racist taxi driver who threatened her and her children. The cabbie threatened Patriciaâ€™s life because she had a mixed-race child with her (Noah), and thus had obviously been with a white man. Check out the OZY Flashback by Sean Braswell about this scary incident here: http://ow.ly/iOYN30kCCmJ â€“ and how Patricia and her boys had to throw themselves out of the moving vehicle to escape harm â€“ as you gear up to watch 'Breaking Big' and learn about Noahâ€™s journey to the top.

'Breaking Big' guests include chef Eddie Huang, actress Danai Gurira, country music star Jason Aldean, SoulCycle and Flywheel cofounder Ruth Zuckerman, fashion designer Christian Siriano and acclaimed author Roxane Gay, among many others.

Finland and Denmark have consistently topped the United Nationsâ€™ most prestigious index, The World Happiness Report, in all six areas of life satisfaction: income, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom, trust and generosity.

Learn more about work-life balance secrets from the happiest countries in the world on CNBC Make It: https://cnb.cx/37So3YY

Each year, a group of happiness experts from around the globe rank 156 countries based on how â€œhappyâ€<9d> citizens are, and they publish their findings in the World Happiness Report. Happiness might seem like an elusive concept to quantify, but there is a science to it.

When researchers talk about â€œhappiness,â€<9d> theyâ€™re referring to â€œsatisfaction with the way oneâ€™s life is going,â€<9d> Jeff Sachs, co-creator of the World Happiness Report and a professor at Columbia University, tells CNBC Make It.

â€œItâ€™s not primarily a measure of whether one laughed or smiled yesterday, but how one feels about the course of oneâ€™s life,â€<9d> he says.

Since the report began in 2012, Nordic countries â€” which include Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Iceland, plus the Faroe Islands, Greenland and Aland â€” consistently turn up at the top of the list. (The United States, on the other hand, typically lands somewhere around 18th or 19th place.)

Professor Johan Giesecke, one of the worldâ€™s most senior epidemiologists, advisor to the Swedish Government (he hired Anders Tegnell who is currently directing Swedish strategy), the first Chief Scientist of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, and an advisor to the director general of the WHO, lays out with typically Swedish bluntness why he thinks:

- UK policy on lockdown and other European countries are not evidence-based
- The correct policy is to protect the old and the frail only
- This will eventually lead to herd immunity as a â€œby-productâ€<9d>
- The initial UK response, before the â€œ180 degree U-turnâ€<9d>, was better
- The Imperial College paper was â€œnot very goodâ€<9d> and he has never seen an unpublished paper have so much policy impact
- The paper was very much too pessimistic
- Any such models are a dubious basis for public policy anyway
- The flattening of the curve is due to the most vulnerable dying first as much as the lockdown
- The results will eventually be similar for all countries
- Covid-19 is a â€œmild diseaseâ€<9d> and similar to the flu, and it was the novelty of the disease that scared people.
- The actual fatality rate of Covid-19 is the region of 0.1%
- At least 50% of the population of both the UK and Sweden will be shown to have already had the disease when mass antibody testing becomes available","2020-04-17T14:50:58.000Z","UCMxiv15iK_MFayY_3fU9loQ","UnHerd","888823","15351","1037","0","7826","News & Politics"

Millions of counterfeit euros and Peruvian soles have also been seized by police in Peru.

The forged dollars are finished by hand, giving them an exceptional quality which has earned the country its top spot as leader of this illicit global trade. And for the criminal gangs counterfeit money is cheaper to produce than cocaine. 

Fernando Lucena goes undercover for VICE News to expose the illegal trade in counterfeit money and gets rare access to the criminal forgers who show us how these bills are made.

""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,"" reveals how the biggest tech companies deal with our data. How do we regain control of our data? What is surveillance capitalism?

In this documentary, Zuboff takes the lid off Google and Facebook and reveals a merciless form of capitalism in which no natural resources, but the citizen itself, serves as a raw material. How can citizens regain control of their data?

It is 2000, and the dot.com crisis has caused deep wounds. How will startup Google survive the bursting of the internet bubble? Founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin don't know anymore how to turn the tide. By chance, Google discovers that the ""residual data"" that people leave behind in their searches on the internet is very precious and tradable.

This residual data can be used to predict the behavior of the internet user. Internet advertisements can, therefore, be used in a very targeted and effective way. A completely new business model is born: ""surveillance capitalism.""

When the financial world collapsed in 2008, a mysterious genius under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto presented the architecture for the perfect, bankless currency. Bitcoins can't be forged, and can be transferred worldwide with one click of a button, without transaction costs. Up till today, nobody knows who Nakamoto is, but his invention of the first decentralized cryptocurrency became world-famous within a couple of years.

â€˜Bitcoin Jesusâ€™ Roger Ver invested massively in bitcoins when they were still worth less than a dollar, and in 2013 he saw the bitcoin exchange rate reaching as much as 1000 dollars. Whatâ€™s the bottom line, now that this globally disruptive currency has grown to maturity? Is bitcoin the blueprint for fair money, separated from banks or states, or will it be a new hierarchy from haves and have-nots?

For nearly 50 years, Buffett has run Berkshire Hathaway, which owns over 60 companies, like Geico and Dairy Queen, plus minority stakes in Apple, Coca-Cola, and many others. His $82.5 billion fortune makes him the third richest person in the world. And he's vowed to give nearly all of it away. The Oracle of Omaha is here to talk about what shaped his investment strategy and how to master today's market.

I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to a special edition of ""Influencers"" from Omaha, Nebraska. It's my pleasure to welcome Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Warren, welcome.

WARREN BUFFETT: Thanks for coming.

ANDY SERWER: So let's start off and talk about the economy a little bit. And obviously, we've been on a good long run here.

WARREN BUFFETT: A very long run.

ANDY SERWER: And does that surprise you? And what would be the signs that you would look for to see that things were winding down?

WARREN BUFFETT: Well, I look at a lot of figures just in connection with our businesses. I like to get numbers. So I'm getting reports in weekly in some businesses, but that doesn't tell me what the economy's going to six months from now or three months from now. It tells me what's going on now with our businesses. And it really doesn't make any difference in what I do today in terms of buying stocks or buying businesses what those numbers tell me. They're interesting, but they're not guides to me.

Unsurprisingly, their concern lies less with the proximity of Bin Laden than the chaos that his death has sparked. Although the controversy over whether or not Pakistan was harboring Bin Laden and the ""trust deficit"" is the primary focus for the American media, Pakistani news is busy covering the onslaught of violence that has broken out since the May 2nd raid. The people have seen a marked increase in American drone attacks, while the Taliban continues its retaliation with a relentless wave of suicide bombings. Anti-American sentiment has never run higher and this turbulent nation clearly has bigger issues than Bin Laden's death to contend with.

Reason is the planet's leading source of news, politics, and culture from a libertarian perspective. Go to reason.com for a point of view you won't get from legacy media and old left-right opinion magazines.
---------

That proposition was the subject of a November 5, 2019, debate hosted by the Soho Forum, a monthly debate series sponsored by Reason. Arguing in favor of the resolution was Richard D. Wolff, an economist at the University of Massachusetts and the author, most recently, of Understanding Marxism. Taking the other side was former Barron's economics editor Gene Epstein, who is also the Soho Forum's co-founder and director. Reason's Nick Gillespie served as moderator.

It was an Oxford-style debate, in which the audience votes on the resolution at the beginning and end of the event; the side that gains the most ground is victorious. It was a packed house, with about 450 people in attendance. The pre-debate vote found that 25 percent of the audience agreed that socialism was preferable to capitalism, 49.5 percent picked capitalism as the better system, and 25.5 percent were undecided. Despite a technical problem at the event itself, the Soho Forum was able to recover the final vote totals, which saw support for socialism drop by half a percentage point and support for capitalism increase to 71 percent.

Dave Rubin explains why he rejects progressive left ideology, and why the Democratic party will dismantle into two different parties. Dave also agrees with AOC on this point: the liberals/democratic socialists should split into two different parties.

It's a dangerous time in America, especially with the infiltration of the progressive left.

Melber also presses McCabe on why he is now concerned about evidence of obstruction by Donald Trump, when McCabe testified to Congress, under oath in May 2017, that there were â€œno efforts to impedeâ€<9d> the Russia investigation. (McCabe watches the clip of that testimony play during the interview before he responds.)  McCabe also defends a major controversy: How the FBI sat on Clinton-related emails in the Weiner case during the 2016 campaign.  Near the end of the extensive interview, McCabe fields questions on how the FBI views Julian Assange; whether Mueller was in the room when McCabe spoke to the Russia probe; Jeff Sessionsâ€™ approach to civil rights and consent decrees at the DOJ; when the last time McCabe spoke to Comey was, and whether the separate federal probe into McCabeâ€™s own alleged misstatements to FBI investigators is still open.

â€œJoseph Stalin, Soviet dictator, creator of great power, and destroyer of tens of millions of lives â€¦â€<9d> Thus begins this episode of Uncommon Knowledge, which dives into the biography of Joseph Stalin. This episodeâ€™s guest, Stephen Kotkin, author of Stalin: Waiting for Hitler, 1929-1941(https://www.amazon.com/Stalin-Waiting-1929-1941-Stephen-Kotkin/dp/1594203806), examines the political career of Joseph Stalin in the years leading up to World War II, his domination over the Soviet Union, and the terror he inspired by the Great Purge from 1936â€“38. 

â€œWhy does Joseph Stalin matter?â€<9d> is a key question for Kotkin, as he explains the history of the Soviet Union and Stalin's enduring impact on his country and the world. Kotkin argues that Stalin is the â€œgold standard for dictatorshipsâ€<9d> in regard to the amount of power he managed to obtain and wield throughout his lifetime. Stalin stands out because not only was he able to build a massive amount of military power, he managed to stay in power for three decades, much longer than any comparable dictator. 

Kotkin and Robinson discuss collectivization and communism and how Stalinâ€™s regime believed it had to eradicate capitalism within the USSR even in regions where capitalism was bringing economic success to the peasants, with the potential of destabilizing the regime. This led to the Great Purge, a campaign of political repression that resulted in the exile and execution of millions of people.

The credit crunch has shown how the global financial system has become increasingly dependent on mathematical models trying to quantify human (economic) behaviour. Now the quants are at the heart of yet another technological revolution in finance: trading at the speed of light. 

What are the risks of treating the economy and its markets as a complex machine? Will we be able to keep control of this model-based financial system, or have we created a monster? A story about greed, fear and randomness from the insides of Wall Street.

Behind its walls he comes face to face with the 12 condemned men awaiting execution on Death Row and some of the other 1900 inmates most of which are convicted of murder. And there is a visit to the 1950â€™s style prison barber shop where all the hairdressers are convicts. Trevor meets Rick Pearish who is serving 3 life sentences. Pearish explains why the barbers are allowed cut throat razors and sharp implements inside a maximum security prison.

"999","25","bi2hqL5KkHc","PT48M1S","false","hd","Jason Riley On â€œFalse Black Power?â€<9d>","Recorded on February 21, 2019. 

What is â€œfalse black power?â€<9d> According to Jason Riley, author of False Black Power?, it is political clout, whereas true black power is human capital and culture. Riley and Peter Robinson dive into the arguments in Rileyâ€™s new book, the history of African Americans in the United States, and welfare inequality in black communities.  

Riley discusses the Moynihan report of 1965, which documented the rise of black families headed by single women in inner cities and how this report was something black sociologists had already been writing about for several years. He argues that there was clearly a breakdown of the nuclear family and that this is a result of the â€œGreat Societyâ€<9d> welfare programs of the 1960s rather than the legacy of slavery or Jim Crow laws. 

In the 1960s, Riley posits that the black activist communityâ€™s shift towards political engagement was misguided. He argues that the idea of black political clout leading to black economic advancement was misplaced. Other impoverished communities (i.e. Irish, Jewish, and Italian immigrant communities) at various times in American history focused on economic advancement first before trying to achieve political clout, and they were successful. Instead, the black community focused first on electing black politicians, which ended up doing very little for the economic advancement of the community as politicians typically put their own interests first, above their communitiesâ€™. Riley points out that the economic data shows that black communities became more impoverished under black leadership. 

Riley proposes a solution of advocating for more school-choice vouchers, which allow black parents to take better control of their childrenâ€™s futures and place them in the best schools for them. He also argues for reducing social safety nets, making them a more temporary form of welfare rather than the multigenerational welfare system currently in place.

Muslim journalist Mehdi Hasan, political editor of the Huffington Post, warns Anne-Marie Waters that her ""astonishing claims"" might endanger her future as a Labour Party candidate, but assured her ""don't worry, the BNP will take you"".

Hasan asks why, if Islam is ""responsible for killing,"" such a tiny percentage of believers actually participate in violence. He asks the audience if they really believe that 1.6 billion people are all ""followers, promoters and believers in a religion of violence"".

Hasan urges them not to ""fuel the arguments of the phobes and bigots and legitimise hate"", but to ""trust the Muslims that you know and that you hear.""

Dan Barker says that he used to be a firm believer in the gospel. He was evangelical. He tells of parables and fables whose story is meant to be fictional but the moral tale is what matters. He goes on to highlight that modern day Christians understand the use of metaphors in the Bible that everything should not be taken as pure gospel, but says where do we draw the line between what is real and what is myth?

Following this he states there is no hard evidence for god, that some tales in the bible can be questioned with simple logic. Also religions become secular over time, disagreeing on minor aspects within the larger body of the religion itself.

From that perspective, Peter Robinson and Kotkin discuss Trumpâ€™s response to the COVID-19 crisis, Kotkinâ€™s thoughts on the Chinese leadership class and the advantages they may seek to exploit, and which countryâ€”China or the United Statesâ€”will come to represent the more successful or compelling model to other nations.

America is locking up more people than any other nation on earth. Home to just 5 percent of the world's total population, the United States houses more than 20 percent of the world's prisoners. In the last three decades, fueled in large part by a national drug policy and legislation like three strikes laws, America has imprisoned more people in local jails, federal penitentiaries, and private correctional facilities than Stalin put in the Gulags. New court rulings have declared overcrowded prisons to be unconstitutional, and the sheer cost of incarceration is forcing prisons to let prisoners back out on the streets.

VICE News was granted rare access to go inside one of the most maximum-security prisons in the country, a place that's on the frontline of what could be a sea change in prison policy. Salinas Valley State Prison is home to America's most powerful prison gangs including the Aryan Brotherhood and Mexican Mafia. It's a place that's projected to have more than 700 assaults this year. In an institution that houses the worst of the worst, we see how one maverick warden is trying to turn the system around by rehabilitating murderers before they get returned to the streets.

America will be watching as several states start relaxing social distancing restrictions and reopening parts of their economies today. Some argue it's still too soon. Will these changes result in a spike in coronavirus infections? How have other countries fared with less restrictive lockdowns? University of California, Irvine epidemiologist Andrew Noymer weighs in.

The coronavirus and social-distancing restrictions have sparked a debate centering around remote voting in Congress. Senator Tim Scott shares his take on how Washington's business should get done in a crisis. Plus, the South Carolina Republican discusses his relationship with President Trump, what he faced being the only black Republican in the Senate and his new book, ""Opportunity Knocks: How Hard Work, Community, and Business Can Improve Lives and End Poverty.""

Don't miss the good news with Tonya J. Powers.

Plus, commentary by FOX Nation host Tom Shillue.

Thomas Sowell discusses economic inequality, racial inequality, and the myths that have continued to falsely describe the system of poverty among different racial and economic classes. He explains the economic theories behind these pervasive myths and proposes fact-based solutions for seemingly intractable situations.

Sowell discusses his early life as a high school dropout and his first full-time job as a Western Union messenger delivering telegrams. He admits to flirting with Marxism in his early twenties as he first tried to grapple with the housing inequality he saw across the neighborhoods of New York City. Marxism, he says, was the only explanation he could find at the time. He went on to serve in the Marine Corps before continuing his education in economics at Harvard and earning a masterâ€™s at Columbia and a PhD at the University of Chicago.

Sowellâ€™s first job after his receiving his PhD in economics was working for the Department of Labor, and he says it was there that he realized Marxism was not the answer. He argues that the government has its own institutional interests in inequality that cannot be explained through Marxism. He began to be discouraged by Marxism and the government in general and began searching for better economic ideas and solutions (the free market).

Robinson and Sowell discuss Sowellâ€™s written works, his ideas of racial and economic inequality, the state of the United States today, and much more.

"1043","25","FEXL5USuDGI","PT1H1S","false","hd","Victor Davis Hanson on â€œThe Case For Trumpâ€<9d>","Recorded on April 1, 2019. 

How did blue-collar voters connect with a millionaire from Queens in the 2016 election? Martin and Illie Anderson Senior fellow Victor Davis Hanson addresses that question and more in his newly released book, The Case for Trump. He sits down with Peter Robinson to chat about his motivation to write a book making a rational case for those voters who chose Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. 

Hanson and Robinson, the Murdoch Distinguished Policy Fellow, discuss how voters connected with Trumpâ€™s â€œpersonal authenticityâ€<9d> during the campaign and how the media has a â€œhistorical amnesiaâ€<9d> of the bad behavior of past presidents when talking about President Trump. The president, Hanson argues, was always an outsider from elite society in Manhattan, which helped him to better to connect with voters who felt like outsiders. He analyzes President Trumpâ€™s platform agenda, which was composed 80% of traditionally conservative views with the remaining 20% being radical ideas that fit with many of the views of the midwestern states. He breaks down why, in the end, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, and John Kasich didnâ€™t appeal to voters in the way that Trump managed to. 

Hanson turns to talk about his background and life growing up in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley and how different the area feels now compared to when he was younger. He talks about seeing the majority of the family-run farms being steadily replaced with large commercial operations and how thatâ€™s drastically impacted the workforce and economics of the region. He goes on to discuss issues of water protection and water quality in the Central Valley and how Bay Area elites prioritize their water quality over that of the rural farmers.

While expressing sympathy for their plight, Cuomo said the virus is still killing hundreds of New Yorkers per day.

""It's not about me. It's about we,"" he said.

Cuomo said the risk of death outweighs economic hardship.

The governor said those who want to go back to work should ""take a job as an essential worker.""

""There are people hiring,"" he said. ""You can get a job as an essential worker. So now you can go to work and you can be an essential worker and you are not going to kill anyone.""

Gaining insight from international tax experts, Backlight takes a look at tax havens, the people who live there and the routes along which tax is avoided globally. Those routes go by resounding names like 'Cayman Special', 'Double Irish', and 'Dutch Sandwich'. 

A financial world operates in the shadows surrounded by a high level of secrecy. A place where sizeable capital streams travel the world at the speed of light and avoid paying tax. The Tax Free Tour is an economic thriller mapping the systemic risk for governments and citizens alike. Is this the price we have to pay for globalised capitalism? At the same time, the free online game ""Taxodus"" by Femke Herregraven is launched. In the game, the player can select the profile of a multinational and look for the global route to pay as little tax as possible.

Hard drives only last five years, a web page is forever changing and thereâ€™s no machine left that reads 15-year old floppy disks. Digital data is vulnerable. Yet entire libraries are shredded and lost to budget cuts, because we assume everything can be found online. But is that really true? For the first time in history, we have the technological means to save our entire past, yet it seems to be going up in smoke. Will we suffer from collective amnesia? 

This VPRO Backlight documentary tracks down the amnesiac zeitgeist starting at the Royal Tropical Institute in Amsterdam, whose world-famous 250-year old library was lost to budget cuts. The 400.000 Books were saved from the shredder by Ismail Serageldin, director of the world-famous Library of Alexandria, who is turning the legendary library of classical antiquity into a new knowledge hub for the digital world.

Algorithms rule us all, algorithms rule everything. Because algorithms are faster and more efficient than people. But do they always make better decisions? And what does a society look like in which we are sent by big data and computer code?
Companies, and increasingly governments too, use algorithms to automate bureaucratic processes. These algorithms, sets of instructions and rules that are fed by big data, unnoticeably determine our lives more and more. For example, the algorithm of Facebook determines which (political) advertisements we see and see large groups of employees in the on-demand economy never even a boss. From an application procedure to a dismissal request they are controlled by an algorithm. Where should they complain if something does not go as it should be?
Legislatives are also emerging in the judiciary. For example, an American prisoner had to sit longer than comparable prisoners because the algorithm, which establishes a risk score, gave him an inexplicably high outcome. And unlike the decisions made by a judge, it turns out to be virtually impossible to challenge the assessment of an algorithm. Recently the British company Cambridge Analytica appeared to have developed models based on large amounts of Facebook data, which could influence the voting behavior of voters. These psychographics show that algorithms can not only steer individual lives but also democracy.

The mathematicians and programmers begin to realize that the algorithms that are among all these automated decision systems are not neutral and may contain errors. Because the smart code may then decide more quickly than people, the results are not only sometimes defective, but sometimes downright dangerous. Should we be blindly guided by the decisions of the algorithm?

Subscribe to our channel now and get the latest news! 

This is an episode of Cambridge House Backstage with host Jay Martin and guests Rick Rule, David Cole, and Jim Rogers. 

Jay wanted to sit down with CEOâ€™s and Investors who are industry leaders and he identifies two key criteria he uses to identify great CEOs and investors:
1. Serially Successful People Predicting Market Trends and allocating cash
2. Sitting on a Surplus of USD

Those three investors are:
Rick Rule - CEO Sprott US Holdings
David Cole - CEO EMX Royalty Corporation
Jim Rogers - Quantum Fund

Heres a summary of what we talked about with each of the three.

Rick Rule:

67-year-old super investor Rick Rule gets serious about the future of the US economy in this interview with Cambridge House.

â€œThe impact of the virus on the world and on our everyday life is a function that we became too
confident and too fragile.â€<9d>

Gold is the ultimate liquidity. Itâ€™s a medium of exchange that is a form of value. Fiat gives you the 
means to invest when a crisis arises.

Rick is very long US Dollars. However, The strength of the US dollar is not reflected in the US economy.

The US dollar gives liquidity to take advantage of other circumstances. 
The gold price moves when people lose faith in the purchasing power of savings instruments like USD. Weâ€™re in a bubble of fiat currencies

The US treasury has been return-free risk. This is the definition of a bubble.
QE is counterfeiting -and it is debasing the currency. This guarantees that the value of the US dollar will go down.

A forward shift of benefit from older generations and a backward shift of cost for newer generations

We're also In A Gold Bull Market. 

The virus unwinded the last 11 years quickly which should help create a faster reset of the balance of supply and demand very quickly. 

Instead of a long drawn-out bear market, the supply/demand balance will move up quickly in 2-3 years after the crash happens. Supply canâ€™t be adjusted back up quickly enough and prices will boom.

The Grey Rhino is in front of us. Be patient.

Barrons Gold Mining index is ripe for a massive increase. The BGMI index as a whole has recoveries of 180% to 1200% on average.

Rick Rule is heavily investing in Gold Bullion. 

David Cole - CEO EMX Royalty Corporation

Gold sells off dramatically when people have a liquidity crisis to meet the demands in front of them. This happens during every market crash. This is predictable. 

Devaluation of companies because of a lack of income. But the increase in the money supply is going to increase the volatility. The silver to gold ratio has decreased dramatically. 12oz of silver for every ounce of gold on the planet. Silver is much more rare than the price indicates. Silver could be in a position where it is poised for a move. Platinum, Silver, and Gold are great hedges against currency fluctuations. 

Have recent events affected copper? Yes - very bearish on copper in the short term. EMX has 50 million USD in the bank and zero debt. Copper is a long term bull.

EMX focuses on the royalty of deals which helps be more strategic with investments. 

Jim Rogers American Investor - Everybody should have some gold and some silver as an insurance policy if nothing else. 

WW1 was last time something like this happened in August 1914. In 1929 the markets collapsed., but the economy didnâ€™t collapse. 1939 was just a few European countries. 

The world is not going to be the same. With the huge amounts of debt the US is adding, this could see power shift from the US to China.

More bankruptcies will happen. The people that can handle debt properly will be okay. Be sure you understand debt. 

The human cost of the economic crash will be larger than the pandemic cost.

Jim's advice to anyone young - Go to China, Learn mandarin and learn the investment business. Understand balance sheets; the nuances. Figure out what has been happening to a companies balance sheet to find out the real condition of a company.

Founders Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning set out to redefine the electric car. Cars that everyone would wantâ€” affordable, environmentally friendly and fast. Their master plan started with a low volume of expensive but alluring electric sports cars. 

In 2004, well-known entrepreneur and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk invested millions of his own money and eventually became CEO. In less than 10 years, Tesla released the groundbreaking Roadster, Model S and Model X, all paving the way for its first affordable electric car, the Model 3. By 2016, Musk and Tesla looked unstoppable.

Over the next year, the company struggled to simply make cars. Tesla was plagued by manufacturing woes, financial losses, a controversial SolarCity acquisition and volatile decision making from its CEO. On top of that, some say Elon Musk was distracted by other projects like the Boring Company and Hyperloop One, was scrutinized for smoking pot on the Joe Rogan Experience, and tweeting that he was taking Tesla private for $420, which led to a SEC lawsuit.

 Elon Musk says growing Tesla from the Roadster to Model 3 was a â€œhell of a ride,â€<9d> and he took Wall Street along with him. Hereâ€™s the wild story of how Tesla started an EV revolution.

NOTE: As our expert Peter Li points out in the video, â€œThe majority of the people in China do not eat wildlife animals. Those people who consume these wildlife animals are the rich and the powerful â€“a small minority.â€<9d>  This video explains how the people of China are themselves victims of the conditions that led to coronavirus. The virus is affecting many different countries and cultures, and there is never justification for xenophobia or racism.

https://www.vox.com/identities/2020/3/6/21166625/coronavirus-photos-racism

As of early March 2020, a new coronavirus, called COVID-19, is in more than 70 countries and has killed more than 3,100 people, the vast majority in China. That's where the virus emerged back in December 2019. This isn't a new phenomenon for China; in 2003, the SARS virus also emerged there, and under similar circumstances, before spreading around the world and killing nearly 800.

Both SARS and COVID-19 are in the ""coronavirus"" family, and both appear to have emerged from animals in China's notorious wildlife markets. Experts had long predicted that these markets, known to be potential sources of disease, would enable another outbreak. The markets, and the wildlife trade that supports them, are the underlying problem of these pandemics; until China solves that problem, more are likely to emerge.

Without proper training and expertise, confrontations taking place amid an already-charged atmosphere can escalate quickly, often leading to the injury or death of the individual with mental illness. This concern and numerous high-profile police shootings involving unarmed individuals in a mental health crisis have prompted renewed debates about policing the mentally ill. In the San Antonio Police Department, a special plainclothes unit is trained specifically to handle mental health calls. For several weeks, we followed the 10-person unit to see firsthand how the program operates. One of the calls the unit received during this time was from Martha Remmey, the mother of a young man with schizophrenia who appeared unable to distinguish what was real and what wasnâ€™t. Martha, whoâ€™s called the police on her son Christopher multiple times, is torn between wanting to get help for her son and fearing one of his confrontations with the police will turn deadly. In Houston, we meet with Marketta Thomas-Smith, who is mourning her brother Danny Ray Thomas. In March 2018, a sheriffâ€™s deputy encountered Thomas in the middle of a Houston road. Thirty-four-year-old Thomas was unarmed and visibly in distress, walking with his pants around his ankles. But the deputy said Thomas ignored his commands and acted aggressively toward him, so he shot him once in the chest. As Marketta continues to grieve, she is also seeking justice for her brother. A Different Kind of Forceâ€”Policing Mental Illness offers an unflinching look at the crisis in the U.S. mental health system today by exploring the complex and often fraught relationship between the mentally ill and law enforcement.

UPDATE: On Aug. 8, Cameron Brewer, the former Harris County Sheriff's deputy, was found not guilty in the fatal shooting of Danny Ray Thomas.

In the latest episode from Uncommon Knowledge, Sir Roger Scruton, a formally trained political philosopher, talks about his life and the events heâ€™s witnessed that led him to conservatism. He first embraced conservatism after witnessing the leftist student protests in France in May 1968. During the ensuing riots in Paris, more than three hundred people  were injured. Scruton walked away from this event with a change in worldview and a strong leaning toward conservatism. Visits to communist- controlled Poland and Czechoslovakia in 1979 cemented his preference for conservatism and his distaste for the fraud of communism and socialism,  initiating a desire to do something about it. From thereon he dedicated himself to helping organize underground seminars for the young people oppressed behind the iron curtain.
 
Sir Roger examines a brief history of conservatism in the twentieth century of England in regard to Margaret Thatcher and Winston Churchill. Although  he appreciates what Margaret Thatcher stood for, he argues that she had many conservative ideals but never used the conservative framework to organize her overall political strategy. Instead she organized around market economics, which was not always effective in the social, cultural, and legal areas. Peter Robinson argues that Winston Churchill did a much better job of organizing around conservative ideals but eventually lost an election because he didnâ€™t have the vocabulary or the focus on free markets. They discuss the tenuous relationship between free markets and conservative ideals that have not mixed well together in British politics.
 
Robinson and Sir Roger discuss the 2016 political upset of Brexit in the United Kingdom and how the political analysts failed to predict the vote outcome, much like what happened in November 2016 in the United States. They deliberate how  the issues around immigration from Eastern Europe to the United Kingdom contributed to Brexit, in addition to general dissatisfaction with the European Union.  Thus, in the cases of both the United Kingdom and the United States, the media and intellectuals ignored the will of the â€œindigenous working classesâ€<9d> who made their voices known through their votes.
 
About the Guest: Sir Roger Scruton
Sir Roger Scruton is an English writer and philosopher who has published more than fifty books in philosophy, aesthetics, and politics. His book discussed in this episode was How to Be a Conservative;  it was published in 2014. He is a fellow of the British Academy and a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. He teaches in both England and America and is a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, Washington. DC. He is currently teaching an MA in philosophy course for the University of Buckingham. Sir Scruton was knighted in 2016 by Queen Elizabeth II for his â€œservices to philosophy, teaching and public education.â€<9d>

Around midnight on May 3, Dana Seetahal, a prominent attorney and former senator in Trinidad and Tobago, had just left a casino in the capital of Port of Spain when her vehicle was stopped by another car blocking the road. A van pulled up alongside and let loose a burst of gunfire, killing her in a well orchestrated hit.

Her murder was one of approximately 170 that have occurred in the Caribbean nation so far this year, putting it on course for one of the highest murder rates in the world. The country saw only 93 murders in 1999. Last year, there were 407.

VICE News visited the slums of Port of Spain and spoke with police, activists, community leaders, and gangsters to understand the country's decade-plus spike in killings. Many of the murders are attributed to ruthless and politically connected street gangs who control territories that are sometimes no larger than a city block. The gangs fight over lucrative government contracts meant to provide social services and combat unemployment.

But gang violence is merely a symptom of a bigger problem. Trinidad has become an important stop for drugs headed to West Africa and the United States. Many observers point to ""the big fish"" â€” the nameless political and business elites who are behind drug trafficking and the culture of endemic corruption and murder that come with it. They are accused of turning a country rich in oil and gas deposits into their own personal narco-state, fostering impunity through a web of bribes and murders. Unlike the profits from the energy industry, however, this phenomenon trickles all the way down to the street level.

He's also an investing legend in his own right. Munger ran a firm in the 1960s and '70s that scored returns of over 24% per year. He's here to talk about how to make investment decisions and life choices that help secure prosperity and longevity.

I'm Andy Serwer. Welcome to ""Influencers."" And welcome to our guest, Vice Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger. Charlie, nice to see you.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Delighted to be here.

ANDY SERWER: So you just had the annual meeting. And I have to ask you what your favorite moments of that were.

CHARLIE MUNGER: What I like is that both the shareholders and employees of Berkshire are so extremely enthusiastic. And it's not just that they made a lot of money and have nice careers. They think they're on the right side.

ANDY SERWER: And, you know, they come there to hear you guys talk all day. And--

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, it's like a cult.

ANDY SERWER: It's like a cult?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah.

ANDY SERWER: In a good way, though?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yeah, a good cult. Yeah, it's a good cult.

ANDY SERWER: OK. I mean, and the stuff that they hear-- some of it's new, some of it's old, and a lot of it is common sense. And you were talking a lot about--

CHARLIE MUNGER: All of it is common sense.

ANDY SERWER: Right.

CHARLIE MUNGER: But of course, when people use the word ""common sense,"" what they mean is uncommon sense. Because the standard human condition is ignorance and stupidity. And when they say, old Joe has common sense, what they mean is he has uncommon sense.

ANDY SERWER: I guess it's a bit of a misnomer then.

CHARLIE MUNGER: It really is.

ANDY SERWER: So, yeah, why is it that people can't think clearly about investing or decisions in their lives?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, they don't think very well about sex or gambling either. You know, I think the standard human condition has a lot of miscognition.

ANDY SERWER: And there are ways to make hay of that or--

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes. You take advantage of other people. You can improve your own life by eliminating your miscognitions.

ANDY SERWER: Let me shift gears a little bit, Charlie, and ask you about the US economy. And what is your take on where things are right now?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, obviously, they're booming. But, you know, the economy sometimes booms, and sometimes it doesn't. And you have to live your life through both episodes. And our idea is we just keep swimming. And sometimes the tide is with us, and sometimes against. But we keep swimming either way.

ANDY SERWER: Are you surprised by how long this expansion has lasted?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course, it's lasted a long time. But what was really remarkable is that we never printed money so much and spent it so fast and bought back so much debt, public and private. So this is total terra incognita in economics. And nobody knew for sure how it was going to work.

ANDY SERWER: So was it risky then?

CHARLIE MUNGER: Of course it was risky. But it worked. And I don't think they had much else that it would work. They weren't set up to do stimulus-- too much controversy. Democratic inertia is very thin. So they had to do something. And all they had left was just to print money and start buying things. And that's what they did. And it turned out to be a very wise response. And what's even more remarkable is that both Congress and the presidency and both parties made the same decision. They all cooperated. It was the last time.

**We make it a point to provide the show free of ads. Please consider supporting our work. Become an EU patron on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/economicupdate

Todayâ€™s episode features an analysis of the social divisions working to undermine the solidarity needed to fight both the Coronavirus and the potentially resulting economic crash as well as how the inconsistent, out-of-touch and non-empathetic U.S. leadership is leaving millions of Americans with nowhere to turn as they increasingly feel society falling apart around them. Prof. Wolff discusses the psychological factors worsening this existing crisis, such as widespread loneliness and a sense of powerlessness, with Tess Fraad-Wolff, a psychotherapist practicing privately in New York City for the last decade, in an effort to better understand and more appropriately respond to the psychological aspects in today's crises we all face.

As a columnist for the Wall Street Journal and a commentator for Fox News, Kim Strassel is a card-carrying member of the mainstream media. But Strassel is appalled by the mediaâ€™s treatment of Donald Trump, and not just from journalists from the left. She describes the â€œresistanceâ€<9d> in detail in her recent book, Resistance (at All Costs): How Trump Haters Are Breaking America. She and Peter Robinson discuss the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 crisis and the way the media has covered it and disseminated the information to the public. They also discuss the upcoming presidential election (yes, we are still having one) and the politics of the $2 trillion stimulus bill, with more spending on the way, and the realities of restarting the economy in a post- or partial-post-COVID-19 world. Finally, they discuss the pluses and minuses of Donald Trumpâ€™s temperament, and the possibility of something good coming from this current crisis.

Peter Robinson opens the show by asking General Jim Mattis, former secretary of defense, to explain the word â€œchaosâ€<9d> from the title of his new book, Call Sign Chaos: Learning to Lead. (â€œChaosâ€<9d> is an abbreviation for â€œColonel Has Another Outstanding Suggestion.â€<9d>) Mattis notes that chaos has been a part and parcel of his life growing up, in the marines, and traveling the world. 

Mattis further talks about how chaos has been introduced by organizations to disrupt order and keep opponents at the top of their game. But on the battlefield, it is better to introduce chaos early, in order to disrupt enemiesâ€™ plans and thus create problems for them and, ultimately, dominate them.

Robinson asks about what led Mattis to join the marines and why he decided to serve so long. Mattis explains his love for the country and the great people he met in the service. The fellow soldiers kept him going and inspired him to jot down lessons he had learned that could help future generations learn to serve and lead in better ways. Mattis notes that it is the very high quality of the people whom he met in the armed services that kept him in the military for his career. Mattis talks about how soldiers are brave, rambunctious, and selfless, and how he would rather have crummy jobs at times and work with great people than have a great job and not work with the outstanding people Mattis encountered in the military.

In this episode, Prof. Harvey argues that this crisis has afforded us an opportunity for significant change. With so many people out of work, freed up from producing wealth for the capitalist class, instead of hoping that things go back to normal, and people return to the low-paying, exploitative jobs, that we give serious thought to reorganizing our society and work to create something radically different.

One in 30 American children is homeless, according to a recent report published by the National Center on Family Homelessness - marking an all-time high for the United States.

About 8.4 million people call the city of New York home, but more people in New York City are homeless today than at any point since the 1930s.

In just one decade the number of people living in New York's homeless shelters has nearly doubled, reaching 60,000 per night in 2014.

It is a homelessness crisis - unprecedented in any other American city.

Why are so many in News York homeless? And why has the city failed to address its homelessness crisis?

Fault Lines looks at the forces that are displacing thousands from their homes and investigates what life is like for homeless people in New York City.

The study, which reviewed veterans' medical charts, was posted Tuesday on medrxiv.org, a pre-print server, meaning it was not peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia.
In the study of 368 patients, 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% death rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate.

Did you choose yourself to be offline or was internet not working? To be offline seems more and more to become a choice that we see as a luxury. Is being offline the new luxury or is it still a luxury to be online for some people?

Digital networks are becoming denser and denser. We are online all the time everywhere and they are fewer places where we really can be alone. Where and when can we still disconnect? To be offline has become a luxury. Will we permanently use data or do we take back control over our connectivity? In this documentary we go on a journey to the edge of internet. 

To be online all the time and everywhere. It sounds great, but it has its drawbacks. As digital networks are closing in, there are fewer places to be really on your own. Being offline is becoming a luxury. Where can you be offline? 

We are connected to the internet even in our bedrooms. Itâ€™s the ambition of companies like Google and Facebook to connect the entire world, so that we can be online all the time and everywhere. Google has sent balloons up into the skies over Sri Lanka to provide the island state with free Wi-Fi for a month. On the ground, more and more devices communicate through the so-called Internet-of-Things. We are going to be â€˜glass citizensâ€™ in a transparent house, connected for life to a wireless intravenous drip and traced anywhere via our smartphones. What does it mean? 

A small but growing group of people is saying goodbye to lifetime connectability. They are researching ways to keep control. What can we learn from them about life in the digital era?

His international crusades and ""miracles"" on stage have become legendary. His recent apparent renunciation of asking for money for blessings is the subject of debate and skepticism. The Fifth Estate revisits the Benny Hinn story it started 10 years ago. The public has had little chance to get inside the tight-knit world of the Benny Hinn Ministries. Until now. His nephew, Costi Hinn, has broken with the family and written a tell-all book about his experience with what is known as the prosperity Gospel.

""Roger definitely felt that he had to keep that sort of Breitbart wing of the viewership onboard; that they were at risk thanks to Trump's attacks on me and Fox in the wake of that debate,"" Kelly says. ""And he definitely wasn't going to lose 30% of the viewers, as this man, who by August of 2015 we knew was the likely Republican nominee.""

FRONTLINEâ€™s two-part special documentary ""America's Great Divide: From Obama to Trump"" explores the nation's increasingly bitter, divided and toxic politics. Part One traces how Barack Obamaâ€™s promise of unity collapsed as increasing racial, cultural and political divisions laid the groundwork for the rise of Donald Trump. Part Two examines how Trumpâ€™s campaign exploited the countryâ€™s divisions â€” and how his presidency has unleashed anger on both sides.

From veteran FRONTLINE filmmaker Michael Kirk and his team, ""America's Great Divide,"" premieres on Mon., January 13 and Tues., January 14  at 9/8c,  on PBS and streaming on the PBS Video App or online at pbs.org/frontline.

David Parker Ray was a textbook psychopathic sexual sadist. The FBI described him as one of the most intelligent criminals they have ever come into contact with. Others say that to classify him as a psychopath doesnâ€™t do him justice; rather he was the Devil himself.  This is the extraordinary story of the dark and sordid world of one of the most prolific and extreme sexual serial killers in US history.

Announcing his candidacy for the Republican nomination back in June 2015, Donald Trump stated ""We need a leader that wrote 'The Art of the Deal' "".  Tony Schwartz was the ghostwriter of the book Trump calls 'his proudest achievement'.  Schwartz has been vocal about his regrets in working on the piece, but, having worked intimately with Trump, provides a fascinating perspective into the personality and idiosyncrasies of the Republican nominee

Myths. We tend to think theyâ€™re a thing of the past, fabrications that early humans needed to believe in because their understanding of the world was so meagre. But what if modern civilisation were itself based on a set of myths? This is the big question posed by Professor Yuval Noah Harari, author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, which has become one of the most talked about bestsellers of recent years. In this exclusive appearance for Intelligence Squared, Harari will argue that all political orders are based on useful fictions which have allowed groups of humans, from ancient Mesopotamia through to the Roman empire and modern capitalist societies, to cooperate in numbers far beyond the scope of any other species.

To give an example, Hammurabi, the great ruler of ancient Babylon, and the US founding fathers both created well-functioning societies. Hammurabiâ€™s was based on hierarchy, with the king at the top and the slaves at the bottom, while the Americansâ€™ was based on freedom and equality between all citizens. Yet the idea of equality, Harari will claim, is as much a fiction as the idea that a king or rich nobleman is â€˜betterâ€™ than a humble peasant. What made both of these societies work was the fact that within each of them everyone believed in the same set of imagined underlying principles. In a similar vein, money is a fiction that depends on the trust that we collectively put in it. The fact that it is a â€˜mythâ€™ has not impeded its usefulness. It has become the most universal and efficient system of mutual trust ever devised, allowing the development of global trade networks and sophisticated modern capitalism.

Professor Harari came to the Intelligence Squared stage to explain how the fictions that we believe in are an inseparable part of human culture and civilisation.","2015-10-23T12:00:56.000Z","UCaqcvH8EvUtePORpN03jLMg","Intelligence Squared","857570","9636","755","0","1374","News & Politics"

A discussion was held with Victor Davis Hanson on his new book, The Second World Wars - How the First Global Conflict was Fought and Won, moderated by Michael Auslin.

World War II was the most lethal conflict in human history. Never before had a war been fought on so many diverse landscapes and in so many different ways, from rocket attacks in London to jungle fighting in Burma to armor strikes in Libya.

The Second World Wars examines how combat unfolded in the air, at sea, and on land to show how distinct conflicts among disparate combatants coalesced into one interconnected global war. Drawing on 3,000 years of military history, Victor Davis Hanson argues that despite its novel industrial barbarity, neither the war's origins nor its geography were unusual. Nor was its ultimate outcome surprising. The Axis powers were well prepared to win limited border conflicts, but once they blundered into global war, they had no hope of victory.","2017-11-28T20:54:30.000Z","UCzWwWbbKHg4aodl0S35R6XA","HooverInstitution","60540","782","43","0","20","News & Politics"

Haim Bodek, aka The Algo Arms Dealer. After Quants: the Alchemists of Wall Street and Money & Speed: Inside the Black Box. This is the final episode of a trilogy in search of the winners and losers of the tech revolution on Wall Street. Trading on the financial market is not longer dominated by humans, but by super fast computers and algorithms. The result of this digital revolution on Wall Street is a complex and fragmented financial system that is hard to understand and overseen. A system that we are all connected to. The only people who understand the system a bit, are the people who built it.

Haim Bodek started his own high frequency trading in 2007 and built a from his point of view perfect and fast algorithm. One day it just stopped working. Profits disappeared en he went looking for the cause. He decided to go public with his search to display the rotten system.

Hitchens, who made his opinion clear on the topic with his book ""God is not Great,"" maintains not only that God fails to be great, but denies his existence entirely. Professor Lennox, a convinced Christian and scientist, respectfully disagrees. This event features a unique blend of both planned remarks and fast-paced dialogue that tackles these issues in a refreshing and informative light. It is sure to offer insights to all.

__________________________

Filmed at the Royal Geographical Society on 23rd September 2015.

Myths. We tend to think theyâ€™re a thing of the past, fabrications that early humans needed to believe in because their understanding of the world was so meagre. But what if modern civilisation were itself based on a set of myths? This is the big question posed by Professor Yuval Noah Harari, author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, which has become one of the most talked about bestsellers of recent years. In this exclusive appearance for Intelligence Squared, Harari will argue that all political orders are based on useful fictions which have allowed groups of humans, from ancient Mesopotamia through to the Roman empire and modern capitalist societies, to cooperate in numbers far beyond the scope of any other species.

To give an example, Hammurabi, the great ruler of ancient Babylon, and the US founding fathers both created well-functioning societies. Hammurabiâ€™s was based on hierarchy, with the king at the top and the slaves at the bottom, while the Americansâ€™ was based on freedom and equality between all citizens. Yet the idea of equality, Harari will claim, is as much a fiction as the idea that a king or rich nobleman is â€˜betterâ€™ than a humble peasant. What made both of these societies work was the fact that within each of them everyone believed in the same set of imagined underlying principles. In a similar vein, money is a fiction that depends on the trust that we collectively put in it. The fact that it is a â€˜mythâ€™ has not impeded its usefulness. It has become the most universal and efficient system of mutual trust ever devised, allowing the development of global trade networks and sophisticated modern capitalism.

Professor Harari came to the Intelligence Squared stage to explain how the fictions that we believe in are an inseparable part of human culture and civilisation.","2015-10-23T12:00:56.000Z","UCaqcvH8EvUtePORpN03jLMg","Intelligence Squared","857570","9636","755","0","1374","News & Politics"

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday he hopes to approve further funding Thursday to buoy small businesses devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.

â€œI will work with Secretary Mnuchin and Leader Schumer and hope to approve further funding for the Paycheck Protection Program by unanimous consent or voice vote during the next scheduled Senate session on Thursday,â€<9d> he said in a statement. 

Congress late last month approved a $350 billion small business loan program as part of a more than $2 trillion stimulus bill aimed at helping the economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic. The program is aimed at helping small businesses that provide the engine of employment and entrepreneurship in the U.S. economy.  

The small business measures aim to help companies cover payroll and other expenses during the punishing outbreak. Firms with fewer than 500 employees can use the money to cover salary, wages and benefits, with a maximum loan of $10 million or 250% of monthly payroll

Still, the initial rollout of the ambitious program faced challenges as banks hurried to prepare themselves to assist with the efforts. In the run-up to the programâ€™s launch this past Friday, banks and trade groups pushed for more clarity around the program and sought to manage expectations about how quickly they could dole out the funds.

This week, there were technical glitches with the system amid the flurry of demand. Some banks are still awaiting guidance from the Treasury on promissory notes clarifying the terms under which the loans are valid, a person familiar with the situation told CNBC. The Treasury did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Still, some banks viewed the announcement of more funds positively, believing it would reassure small business owners that the system would have enough money to cash their checks, even as it works through the technical issues, that person said.

Michael Wolff is an American author, essayist, journalist, and a columnist and contributor to USA Today. He has received two National Magazine Awards, a Mirror Award, and has authored seven books. In January 2018, Wolff's book Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House was published, containing unflattering descriptions of behaviour by U.S. President Donald Trump, chaotic interactions among the White House senior staff, and derogatory comments about the Trump family by former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. After being released on January 5, the book quickly became a New York Times number one bestseller.

Stock futures were higher Friday morning on the heels of a volatile trading day Thursday, when stocks were whipsawed amid conflicting signals over the results of a clinical trial for a coronavirus antiviral treatment candidate. West Texas intermediate crude oil futures (CL=F) were on track for a fourth straight day of advances, after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin reportedly said he was considering a lending program for U.S. oil companies.

The Financial Times cited draft documents accidentally published by the World Health Organization in reporting that a Chinese study for Gileadâ€™s drug remdesivir produced inconclusive results in the treatmentâ€™s first randomized clinical trial â€“ a characterization which Gilead later disputed.

The coronavirus pandemic showed further, but still tentative, signs of leveling off on Thursday, with hospitalizations and new diagnoses declining in the hardest-hit U.S. states of New York and New Jersey. Separately, however, California reported its â€œdeadliest dayâ€<9d> on Thursday, adding 115 new deaths, or the highest for the state in a 24-hour period. Earlier this week, some southern states began a multi-phase economic reopening process. However, many medical experts have warned that easing social distancing restrictions across the country too soon could backfire and trigger another major wave of infections.

Still, weeks-long social distancing measures have ravaged the U.S. economy. Further signs of the devastating economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic emerged on Thursday, with the Labor Department reporting another 4.427 million individuals filed new unemployment claims last week. The new data marked the third straight week that new jobless claims fell on a week-over-week basis, but brought the total number of initial unemployment insurance claims over the last five weeks to more than 26 million.

â€œNet, net, jobless claims are warning that the worst isn't over yet for the American economy with businesses and consumers alike being sucked down into the abyss of the pandemic recession,â€<9d> Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist for MUFG, wrote in a note Thursday.

Thursday after market close, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a $486 billion relief package to provide funds to small businesses and hospitals upended by the pandemic. The legislation, which boosts a vital small business aid program that ran out of funds last week, was cleared by the Senate earlier this week, and heads to President Donald Trumpâ€™s desk for signing.

8:30 a.m. ET: Durable goods orders plunge by most since 2014 in March, missing expectations
Durable goods orders sank 14.4% in March, according to the Census Bureauâ€™s preliminary monthly results, marking the biggest drop in six years. This was worse than the decline of 12.0% anticipated, according to Bloomberg data of consensus economist expectations. In February, durable goods orders rose by 1.1%.

Excluding transportation, durable goods orders fell 0.2% in March, or better than the decline of 6.5% expected. Durable goods orders excluding transportation fell 0.7% in February.

Non-defense capital goods orders, excluding aircraft, unexpectedly rose by 0.1% in March, while a 6.7% decline had been anticipated. This measure is used as a closely watched proxy of business investment plans.

7:20 a.m. ET: American Express net income slides 76% over last year as pandemic curbs consumer spending, drives higher provisions for losses
American Express (AXP) reported net income of $367 million, or 41 cents, for the fiscal first quarter, representing a drop 76% over last yearâ€™s $1.6 billion, or $1.80 per share.

The results were driven in large part by a significant build in the payment companyâ€™s provisions for losses of $2.6 billion, including a $1.7 billion reserve build to â€œreflect deterioration of the global estimated macroeconomic outlook as a result of COVID-19 impacts.â€<9d>

American Express highlighted the impact the coronavirus pandemic was having on customer spending behavior, noting that the effects â€œaccelerated in Aprilâ€<9d> and â€œdramaticallyâ€<9d> impacted their volumes.

â€œThe first two months of 2020 continued the strong momentum we have delivered over the past two years, but weâ€™re now in a different world,â€<9d> CEO Stephen J. Squeri said in a statement.

â€”

(April 24) President Trump and members of the U.S. coronavirus task force, including Vice President Mike Pence, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, hold a daily briefing at the White House.

The death toll from the new coronavirus reached 50,000 in the U.S., now the epicenter of the global outbreak, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

New York City has suffered the most, with more than 16,000 deaths. Some 870,000 people in the U.S. have been infected, with about 20,000 new cases added on Thursday.

Still, some states have begun planning to roll back social-distancing restrictions, facing the dilemma of how to restart the economy without sparking a second wave of infections. Meanwhile, some businesses in Georgia reopened their doors Friday after Gov. Brian Kemp relaxed social distancing measures.

CHARLIE MUNGER: Nice to be here. 

ANDY SERWER: I want to continue with some of the questions that people were asking you at the annual meeting and start maybe with China, and trade and tariffs. And you said that even Trump can be right on some of this stuff. 

CHARLIE MUNGER: Yes, when people get mad enough at one politician, they get to thinking everything he says and does is wrong, and that's never the case. 

ANDY SERWER: What, what, go ahead and continue. I'm sorry. 

CHARLIE MUNGER: And all I said was that you don't want to be such an absolute purist for free trade. I'm almost a purist, but not quite, but I wouldn't want the entire steel industry in the United States to move offshore. There's some place where you could draw a line without ruining the world. 

ANDY SERWER: What should our trade policy be then? I mean, yes China can be unfair, is unfair, but how should we pursue this? 

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well, attitudes entirely different from our president's. I'm glad that we ran a big trade deficit with China. That enabled them to rapidly get out of poverty and obscurity. I welcome the Chinese to the group of advanced nations, which I think we enabled considerably by our willingness to trade with them as they moved ever upward in terms of complexity of enterprise. 

So I like what's happened. I don't regard it as unfair and bad. I'm not saying that it would be unthinkable to have some tariffs somewhere, but basically I'm a free trader and I am particularly a free trader in dealing with China. And I like the fact that free trade with China has enabled China to expand so much, and they got out of poverty. 

They had hundreds of millions of people in rural poverty and they made huge, in the whole history of the world, no big nation has ever advanced faster than China. And this free trade helped them do it. And I like it. 

ANDY SERWER: But aren't they unfair to us? Just to follow up on, you know, intellectual property. 

CHARLIE MUNGER: I'm sure there are places where somebody in China has some advantage over somebody in the United States that you and I might not like perfectly, but that will always happen. But basically, the Chinese broke the Berkshire Hathaway shoe business in Maine. It disappeared basically because their shoes were very good and cheaper. 

I'm not mad at China over that and Berkshire has prospered. It's not so good for Maine, but we can't help it. There's no way to make an advanced civilization never hurt anybody as it evolves. 

ANDY SERWER: There's a lot of talk about an elephant that Berkshire is on the hunt for a big acquisition. Could that elephant be in China.? And if it was, could you even buy it given the relationship between the two countries right now? 

CHARLIE MUNGER: I don't think it's likely that we'll be buying any great Chinese companies. The Chinese are very proud of their companies and they're proud of what they've accomplished. What I consider quite likely is that we will be invited to buy part of some great Chinese company. And just because they like the good company. And I think that is very likely to happen some time, and we would welcome it. We own minority positions in a lot of companies. We own a minority position in BYD. 

ANDY SERWER: Let me ask you, then, about BYD and Chinese cars. When will Chinese cars be allowed in the United States and what's holding it up, is it bureaucracy? 

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well the auto market is very competitive and very fully occupied. And of course, nobody in the United States wants to lose our last two big domestic suppliers, manufacturers of autos. Well three if you want to count Ferrari Chrysler. And so it's hard for somebody new to come in the American market big. And China has such a big market of its own. My guess is they'll stay busy in their own part of the world for a long time. 

ANDY SERWER: So that's not a priority for BYD? 

CHARLIE MUNGER: Well BYD's biggest advantage is in the electric cars. Where they're so close to the cutting edge of battery technology. And so they'd be crazy not to emphasize the hybrid electric cars over the gasoline cars. Not that they'll go out of the gasoline market, but I think they will be biggest in the hybrid and electric cars.

Q&A is a television discussion program that focuses mostly on politics but ranges across all of the big issues that set Australians thinking, talking and debating.

It is driven by interaction: Q&A provides a rare opportunity for Australian citizens to directly question and hold to account politicians and key opinion leaders in a national public forum and Q&A is broadcast live so that not only the studio audience but also the wider audience can get involved.

We aim to create a discussion that is constructive, that reflects a diverse range of views and that provides a safe environment where people can respectfully discuss their differences.

Itâ€™s impossible to represent every view on a single panel or in one audience but weâ€™re committed to giving participants a fair go.

In order to be as inclusive and diverse as possible, the program is presented from a range of locations around the country and all Australians are encouraged to get involved through social media as well as by joining the audience.

This is an official Australian Broadcasting Corporation YouTube channel.","2019-02-25T12:51:25.000Z","UCvy9bjqfawiaE_CklFSdnzg","abcqanda","3865166","49312","2338","0","24598","News & Politics"

To avoid common problems some people mostly encounter with these baguettes, follow this standard advice procedure and you won't go wrong.  
1.  Stick to the recipe rigidly, the quantities are very important for successful results
2.  Use scales for the measurements including the water, don't convert to cups or measuring jugs, they are too inaccurate 
3.  Use proper white bread flour with at least 12% protein, check the ingredients list on the side of the flour bag, protein may show in grams per serving but just work it out, it needs to be 12g of protein per 100g of flour, plain or all purpose flour is not strong enough for making bread. 
4.  Check your yeast is working you can do a yeast test as shown in my sandwich bread video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWpSbYV96_c   
Any problems or inquiries I'm always here to help. And please let me know how you get on with the recipe.

Scott and Seth are going to walk you through the farm to table process of preparing your favorite cut of beef. Homesteaders rejoice, this is the end all how to series that you'll need for beef preparation.

Coming to you again from Whitefeather Meats in Creston, Ohio, The Bearded Butchers will walk you through the process of how to skin a cow step by step to remove the hide. You don't need a Butcher Shop to follow along, just a few knives and a clean working area.

Pro butcher tips from this video: 

1) Make a cradle for the animal to lie on its back with its feet up in the air. Don't try to skin it while it's hanging.

2) If you notice that you've contaminated any meat, just clean your blade and cut out the contaminated piece of meat.

Index:
1:33 - Seth starts on the hind leg by cutting the tendon and working his way down. Then, the other leg.
2:05 - Explanation of how The Butchers keep themselves and the meat clean throughout. They have a stream of 180 degree water to keep the utensils clean. At home, you can just have a hot pot of water nearby that's at least 180 degrees F.
2:21 - One long continuous cut through the belly of the animal.
2:38 - Back to the first leg. Don't cut through these tendons. Same process again on the other leg.
3:51 - Siding the animal. Follow the previous cut on the belly to remove the hide in systematic fashion. Pull the hide towards yourself and keep a nice, downward pressure on the knife. Nice long strokes. Continue working around the entire animal, keep the hide away from the meat to keep the meat clean.
9:51 - Split the brisket (use a handsaw if you don't have a power saw).
10:27 - The next generation of (bearded) butchers.
10:52 - Lifting the animal carcass up into the air to finish skinning the backside of the beef.
13:05 - Lift it up the rest of the way. Finish removing the hide. Let gravity help you with the hide at this point.","2020-02-13T00:21:42.000Z","UC0r6S4hmYdRcDnw7zey7Myg","The Bearded Butchers","2094628","17627","1888","0","703","Howto & Style"

FAQ:
Who is this lady?
Gina Petitti was born in 1935 in Faeto, Italy. Her family ran a farm in Italy and she met her husband, Vito, in the same town. In 1970 Gina, Vito, and her 4 children immigrated to America. Ginaâ€™s husband passed away in 2012, but she is surrounded by a large family, which includes 9 grandchildren, and lives 5 minutes away from her eldest daughter in New Jersey. Gina spends her time cooking, gardening, and being an active member of her local Church. 

Where does Gina get her recipes?
Most of these recipes are from what she learned growing up in Italy, but some of them have evolved over time. She has also learned new recipes from friends and family in America. She is always eager to try new things.

Why does she make such large portions?
When she was in Italy, she would cook and bake in such large quantities so she wouldnâ€™t have to take time every day to make food, and instead be able to work on the farm. Many of her recipes can be cut in half or quartered if you choose to try them out!

Why is no one helping her in the video?
Grandma Gina doesnâ€™t want help! Usually, itâ€™s because we will slow her down or not do it â€œher way.â€<9d> For the videos we only show her, but when the camera cuts we jump in and help form the cookies or prep for the next step.  

Why donâ€™t we buy her a new...?
Grandma Gina has a closet and garage full of new gadgets, spoons, forks, pots, etcâ€¦ but she doesnâ€™t like them because she is used to doing it with her old tools. She has fun getting her hands dirty!

Who is behind the camera?
Her retired son-in-law films, her daughter helps her prep, and she usually has one or two grandkids in the kitchen.

Does Gina read the comments?
We print out and show her how much love she gets from all her viewers, and she is very thankful and hopes you enjoy her cooking! Your comments bring her lots of joy, laughter, and inspiration to make more videos to share with you. 

Thank you for watching, we hope you subscribe, and we will see you in our next video!","2018-09-20T15:27:06.000Z","UCQ5BnGcZx7XlkFKx8q3dsmw","Buon-A-Petitti","2759556","74795","1943","0","9379","Howto & Style"

This recipe takes up to 3 days to make, which might seem a little bit crazy, but we promise you the results are worth it.

Get the full recipe here https://www.ilovecooking.ie/food-tv/baguettes-masterclass-with-patrick-ryan/
________________________________________________
(We've had a few comments about the preferment being a little too dry and not looking like Patrick's in the video. He's double checked his numbers and realised he meant to say that you need 290ml water in the preferment. Apologies for the mistake! But, it's a good excuse to try another batch ðŸ˜‰

So, for the preferment:
450g strong (bread) flour
7g salt
290ml water
5g fresh yeast (or generous pinch dried yeast)

The rest of the recipe stays the same.)
________________________________________________
This dough produces 6-8 baguettes and the dough can be held in a fridge for up to 36 hours. If you do not wish to bake all the dough at once, simply take what you need, shape it and bake it, leaving the remainder of the dough in the fridge which you can return to at any time within that 36-hour time period. This will allow you to bake fresh baguettes day after day.

Or, bake all the baguettes in one go and freeze them. They're easily brought back to their crispy state by thawing at room temperature then dampening with water and heating the oven for about 10 minutes.


Don't forget, we love to see what you've been baking, so please find us on our social channels and show us what you've made!

Precision Wellbeing's Osteopath Ashley Ridout goes into depth as to why most people he sees have shoulder pain.

The most common cause is over-tightness of the shoulder muscles which leads on to the development of tendinitis or bursitis.

In many cases shoulder pain can be overcome through stretching the shoulders with a strength band and using massage balls to reduce the tightness.

In this video Ashley discusses the anatomy of the shoulder including the muscles of the rotator cuff and touches on some of the issues that can arise.

Ashley then goes on to show you the tests that he finds most useful in screening shoulder pain followed by the stretches and massage ball techniques he finds most useful.

This video will hopefully be useful for those who suffer from chronic shoulder pain, tendinitis, bursitis, rotator cuff injuries or just want to simply increase their overall shoulder health.","2017-10-03T17:46:08.000Z","UCwTWYvP51V2B6blkoMN5ztg","Precision Wellbeing Group","2161145","45212","997","0","1435","Howto & Style"

Summary:
- According to Dr. Julian Whitaker,  is an alkaline substance that is produced by the body which buffers acids and helps keep our pH levels in check. Whitaker adds that people who suffer from kidney disease have a hard time removing acid from their body. But a recent study conducted by British researchers shows that sodium bicarbonate actually slowed the rate of kidney decline by two-thirds.
- Over the counter medication such as Alka-Seltzer, Tums, and Rolaids contain some form of bicarbonate. So Whitaker states that if those medications have success in relieving indigestion and heartburn, then taking natural baking soda would work even more efficiently. He suggests stirring half a teaspoon of baking soda into half a cup of water and drink it an hour after eating a meal.
- Whitaker explains that brushing your teeth by simply dipping your toothbrush in baking soda may not be the best idea. With its abrasive qualities, it would wear down the protective enamel over time. He suggests sticking with the commercial products that contain baking soda in their toothpaste.
- Iâ€™ve already mentioned what baking soda can do when itâ€™s on a toothbrush, but I havenâ€™t mentioned what it can do as a mouthwash. Healthline states that baking soda can reach corners and crevices of your teeth, tongue, and gums that can be missed when brushing your teeth. The easiest way to utilize baking soda as a mouthwash is to mix half a teaspoon with half a glass of warm water.
- In 1973, a Mouth Clinic was formed at Sunnybrook hospital. Most of the patients that came into that clinic were suffering from chronic ulceration. It was tough to diagnose and even tougher to treat at times. But specific therapy that included baking soda improved the conditions of 7 out of 10 patients, according to Healthline.
- According to Medical Science Monitor, the reason why baking soda is so effective when it comes to whitening teeth is because of its mild abrasive properties allow it to break the bonds of molecules that stain the teeth. Baking soda also contains antimicrobial and antibacterial properties that can help fight harmful bacteria.
- John Henderson Lamb, M.D., from the School of Medicine at the University of Oklahoma explains that baking soda acts as a natural deodorant because it can eliminate the smell of sweat by making the odor less acidic.
- Muscles produce lactic acid, which is why you get that burning sensation during exercise. Lactic acid lowers the pH inside your cells, which could be the reason why your muscles get tired. 
- A study was published in BioMed Central, and it concluded that the participants who consumed sodium bicarbonate before exercise elevated their peak blood lactate levels, and lowered the rating of perceived exertion.
- According to WebMD, baking soda contains properties that can help soothe the redness thatâ€™s caused by itching and the stinging sensation caused by sunburn. There are many over-the-counter products that contain baking soda. But you can make your own paste out of baking soda, or take a bath and add it to the water.
- According to research done at the University of Nebraska, because baking soda is an alkali when itâ€™s dissolved in water. It has the ability to interact with the acids from stains to help remove them.
-  According to an article published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine, when you combine baking soda and vinegar, it creates a compound called carbon acid. This ingredient is common in cleaning products. Together, they create a fizzing sensation that seeps into the carpet and removes the stains.

FAQ:
Who is this lady?
Gina Petitti was born in 1935 in Faeto, Italy. Her family ran a farm in Italy and she met her husband, Vito, in the same town. In 1970 Gina, Vito, and her 4 children immigrated to America. Ginaâ€™s husband passed away in 2012, but she is surrounded by a large family, which includes 9 grandchildren, and lives 5 minutes away from her eldest daughter in New Jersey. Gina spends her time cooking, gardening, and being an active member of her local Church. 

Where does Gina get her recipes?
Most of these recipes are from what she learned growing up in Italy, but some of them have evolved over time. She has also learned new recipes from friends and family in America. She is always eager to try new things.

Why does she make such large portions?
When she was in Italy, she would cook and bake in such large quantities so she wouldnâ€™t have to take time every day to make food, and instead be able to work on the farm. Many of her recipes can be cut in half or quartered if you choose to try them out!

Why is no one helping her in the video?
Grandma Gina doesnâ€™t want help! Usually, itâ€™s because we will slow her down or not do it â€œher way.â€<9d> For the videos we only show her, but when the camera cuts we jump in and help form the cookies or prep for the next step.  

Why donâ€™t we buy her a new...?
Grandma Gina has a closet and garage full of new gadgets, spoons, forks, pots, etcâ€¦ but she doesnâ€™t like them because she is used to doing it with her old tools. She has fun getting her hands dirty!

Who is behind the camera?
Her retired son-in-law films, her daughter helps her prep, and she usually has one or two grandkids in the kitchen.

Although there are more challenges, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. In this video I show how to raise the chicks when theyâ€™re young, then how to introduce these new chickens into the existing flock. Doing this is a bit of an artform. One of the biggest challenges of free range chickens is predators. One of the biggest advantages is insect control. With diseases like Lyme's disease or Rocky Mountain spotted fever itâ€™s worth having free range chickens.

For one serving of hash browns:
1 (4-5 ounce or 110-140 grams) russet potato
2 Tbsp vegetable oil
1/2 Tbsp butter or margarine

Wash and peel the potato. Grate or shred on a box grater or food processor. Do so into a bowl of water to prevent oxidation. Drain and rinse until water runs clear. Spread shredded potato out onto paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. Pat dry and let air dry for 5-10 minutes. In a small frying pan, add oil and butter. Heat over medium-medium high heat. When butter solids start to brown, add shredded potatoes. Cover with a lid and cook for 5 minutes without lifting the lid. When time is up, remove lid, season with salt and pepper and flip. Continue cooking for an additional 1-2 minutes. Makes 1 serving of hashbrowns. Enjoy!

Index:
0:55 - Scott takes us into the new expansion at Whitefeather Meats to pick out some center cut filet mignon, a great choice for lean meat that will cook on a grill similar to wild game.
2:58 - Scott starts with the Big Green Egg and shows how to light charcoal.
3:40 - Scott describes the nuances of how to season steak and when to season steak while demonstrating with the best seasoning for steak, Bearded Butcher Blend seasoning.
4:12 - With the meat seasoned, it goes onto the Big Green Egg with indirect heat until it reaches 110 degrees fahrenheit.
4:29 - The second cut of steak goes onto the Traeger wood pellet smoker grill on the smoke shelf with the meat probe at 225 degrees fahrenheit until it reaches an internal temperature of 110 degrees. He uses hickory pellets as his hickory wood wood for smoking.
5:08 - Scott fires up the oven in his kitchen to cook the last piece of center cut filet mignon in his cast iron skillet. He is using the oven to reverse sear the steak and sets it at 275 degrees. He also discusses a key point about how to cook a steak in a cast iron skillet with butter.
6:39 - Changing the Big Green over to direct heat to get ready to sear the steak. Remember to burp the Egg at 600 degrees, flashback grill is a possibility and is dangerous.
7:30 - The filet on the Trager is at 110. Crank up the Ironwood 885 to 500 degrees to sear the steak on the Trager.
8:19 - The steak on the Big Green Egg is ready.
8:44 - The steak in the oven is ready for the cast iron. Scott has the cast iron on the burner and the burner is turned all the way up with the butter already melted. Remember, he cooked the steak in the oven at 275 degrees to an internal temperature of 110 degrees first, then went right to the sear for about 1 minute on each side. 
9:45 - The steak on the Trager smoker grill is ready.
10:16 - The steak taste test!

Ingredients

DÃ©trempe

3 Â½ (525 g) cup all-purpose flour
1 cup (250 ml) water, room temperature
Â½ cup (125 ml) 2% milk, room temperature
5 Tbsp (62 g) sugar
1 pkg (2 1/4 tsp/8 g) instant dry yeast
1 Â¼ tsp salt
2 Tbsp (30 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature

Beurrage

1 Â¼ (285 g) cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
1 egg whisked with 2 Tbsp of water, for brushing

Directions

DÃ©trempe

1. For the dÃ©trempe, fit a stand mixer with the hook attachment and stir the flour, water, milk, sugar, and yeast on low speed to blend, then add the salt. Increase to one speed higher and knead for about 4 minutes, adding the butter mid way through kneading â€“ the dough should just clean the sides of the bowl. Shape the dough into a rectangle (it will be soft), place it on a parchment lined baking tray and cover with a tea towel and then plastic wrap. Let the dough sit out for 90 minutes, then chill for at least an hour, up to 8 hours.

Beurrage

1. For the beurrage, shape the butter into an 8-inch square. Chill until ready to use if preparing in advance, but pull from the fridge to soften. Ensure that the butter offers the same resistance (is the same consistency) as the chilled dough â€“ while the temperature of each may differ, the â€œgiveâ€<9d> should be the same.

2. On a floured work surface, turn out the chilled dÃ©trempe and roll out to a square about 14-inches across. Place the beurrage in the centre of the square, but rotated so that the points of the butter square fall at the middle of each flat side of the dough. Bring the corners of the dough together, wrapping the butter like an envelope and gently pinch the edges. Roll the dough out into a rectangle about 20-inches long and fold the dough into thirds (this is called a single fold). Return the dough to the baking tray, cover with the towel and plastic and chill for at least an hour, up to 8 hours.

3. Repeat rolling and folding the dough into singles folds 2 more times, rotating the dough 90 degrees each time before rolling and chilling the dough for at least an hour and up to 8 hours before each fold. Let the dough rest for at least 4 hours and up to 12 hours after the final fold before using.

4. For 12 plain croissants, measure out about 20 oz of dough and store the rest in the fridge. On a floured work surface, roll out the dough to a rectangle about 16-inches by 12-inches. Cut the dough in half horizontally and then cut 6 triangles from each.

5. Make a 1-inch score on the short side of each triangle, and roll up the croissant from this side. Curve the croissant so that the point of the triangle is at the bottom and pointing the opposite direction as the curve in. If you wish, you can pinch the croissant ends together so they hold the curve shape. Place these on a parchment â€“lined baking tray, leaving at least 3 inches between each other and cover these with a tea towel and then plastic. Let the croissants rise for 2 hours.

6. Preheat the oven to 375 F (190 C). Brush the croissants with the eggwash and then bake them for about 15 minutes until a rich golden brown.

7. The croissants are best enjoyed the day they are baked. If you wish to prepare ahead, you can make the dough, fold it and let it rise, and then cut and shape the croissants. Freeze the croissants on a baking tray, then pack in a container. The croissants should fully thaw and proof for about 3 hours before then baking.

Probably the most well known of all the Indian snacks - samosas are simply amazing and I love them. All they are made of is pastry, potato, peas and that's it - how three simple ingredients can taste so good is beyond me, but they are just amazing and yes I will say it again amazing! For me, these are a vegetable dish and although I have cooked meat samosas in my classes it's not something I like to do.

My most significant memory of samosas is from my wedding where they were part of the festivities, right from all my aunties forming a production line in the kitchen gossiping, giggling and producing the amazing triangles parcels through to being served them for breakfast with a cup of hot, sweet chai, a combination that is out of this world. 

You can't help eating them one after the other and I think we got through hundreds of them. My best friend Nicky and her husband Mark called me a few days after the wedding and asked me if I could pop over and make a few before we left for our honeymoon as they were having withdrawal symptoms - addictive....very!

Ingredients

Filling
1 tsp of rapeseed oil
4 potatoes boiled (skin on)
50g frozen peas
Â½ tsp of cumin seeds
1 tsp of salt
Â½ tsp chilli powder
2 chillies, finely chopped
1-2 tsp of garam masala
1 tbsp ginger, grated
2 tbsp of fresh coriander, chopped

Pastry
200g plain flour
1Â½ tbsp rapeseed oil
Pinch of salt
Approx. 100ml water

Paste
1 tbsp plain flour in a small bowl
Splash of cold water

Making the samosa
potato filling
pastry
paste
Rapeseed oil for deep frying

Method

Filling
Cook the potatoes gently with the skin on (do not boil too vigorously) for about 25 minutes until soft. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Once cooled peel the skin off with your fingers.
Cut into small 1cm sized cubes and place in a large bowl.
In a small frying pan heat the oil and fry the cumin seeds. When sizzling, carefully add the peas and fry gently for a few minutes to soften. Remove from the heat and leave to cool before adding to the potatoes.
Add the grated ginger, salt, chilli, chilli powder, garam masala and fresh coriander to the potatoes and stir - check seasoning and refrigerate for 10 minutes.

Pastry
Place flour, oil and salt in a bowl and rub the mixture together.
Using your hand begin to sprinkle in a little water at a time to bring the dough together.
Continue to add the water in this way until the dough comes together. Using wet hands knead the dough until it is soft and no longer sticking to your hands or the bowl.
Refrigerate for 10 minutes. Heat up a thava or frying pan on the lowest heat setting.
Take a small tangerine sized ball of the dough and roll it between your palms to make a smooth ball.
Flatten and roll out with a rolling pin to create a thin round disc the size of a side plate flouring when necessary. Place the disc on the thava for 4 seconds. Remove and place on a chopping board. Using a sharp knife slice the disc in half so you are left with 2 semi-circles.
Place the semi-circles on a plate with the tea towel and cover to keep warm. Repeat with the rest of the dough so you are left with 10 - 12 semi-circles.

Paste
Make some flour glue by adding water to the flour and mix into a thick sticky paste.

Making the samosa
Place one semi-circle on your hand with the flat edge at the top and the cooked side facing you. Dip your finger in the paste and spread it across the straight edge.
Fold in the two corners so they meet in the middle ensuring one edge overlaps the other and press together to seal all the way down to create a smooth upside down cone.
Turn the cone over so the pointed end is at the bottom. Using a spoon fill the cone with the potato filling to 2/3 of the way up.
Seal the opening with the paste and seal it closed creating a triangle pastry. Lie on the tray and pat down to even the filling out. Repeat.
Heat the oil, test it is hot enough by dropping in a little bit of pastry - if it bubbles and floats to the top immediately the oil is ready.
Very carefully slip one samosa into the hot oil being careful that the oil doesn't splash out. Leave the samosa to cook for a few seconds. As the pastry begins to bubble turn it over using a slotted spoon.
Leave it to cook gently until it turns a beautiful golden brown. Once it is cooked remove from the oil and set on some kitchen paper. As you become more confident fry 2 or 3 samosas at the same time.","2014-12-18T10:20:45.000Z","UCgMhVX1auQ1IIOTI9xIIT7Q","Hari Ghotra","2316991","28274","1971","0","2226","Education"

Samurai Bow explores the violence, beauty and reverie which surround the Samurai's earliest weapon. With stunning dramatic reconstruction, we reveal the ancient way of the Samurai and explore how the bow could avert wars when put in the hands of a true master. 

Featuring Japan's most revered archery teacher Master Ogasawara we visit his mounted archery school and see the students intense training and dedication, then follow Ogasawara's son as he prepares to shoot from a galloping horse in the Yabusame ceremony.

Comparing the Japanese bow to another great war bow, the English Longbow we put them both through scientific tests to examine the specialities of each. Using stunning high speed footage we reveal their power and precision and ask what makes the Yumi so special.

Master craftsmen, martial artists and expert historians combine to tell the story of this noble weapon from its bloody past to its revered standing today in Samurai Bow.

Hillsdale CollegeÂ is an independent institution of higher learning founded in 1844 by men and women â€œgrateful to God for the inestimable blessingsâ€<9d> resulting from civil and religious liberty and â€œbelieving that the diffusion of learning is essential to the perpetuity of these blessings.â€<9d> It pursues the stated object of the founders: â€œto furnish all persons who wish, irrespective of nation, color, or sex, a literary, scientific, [and] theological educationâ€<9d> outstanding among American colleges â€œand to combine with this such moral and social instruction as will best develop the minds and improve the hearts of its pupils.â€<9d> As a nonsectarian Christian institution, Hillsdale College maintains â€œby precept and exampleâ€<9d> the immemorial teachings and practices of the Christian faith.

The College also considers itself a trustee of our Western philosophical and theological inheritance tracing to Athens and Jerusalem, a heritage finding its clearest expression in the American experiment of self-government under law.

By training the young in the liberal arts, Hillsdale College prepares students to become leaders worthy of that legacy. By encouraging the scholarship of its faculty, it contributes to the preservation of that legacy for future generations. By publicly defending that legacy, it enlists the aid of other friends of free civilization and thus secures the conditions of its own survival and independence.","2020-03-05T15:15:22.000Z","UCudqVyQYnmi8NwWfd11Rmvw","Hillsdale College","742705","24323","503","0","4033","Education"

The Smiths have had issues with wolves killing livestock in the Diamond-Moose Allotment in the Salmon National Forest. But fortunately, in this particular year, they had no known death loss caused by wolves.  

Jay and Chyenne's overarching philosophy is to try to make their operation better every year in raising quality livestock, always trying to improve rangeland health, water management, and more.

Its early origins and initial geographical starting point still remain a mystery but in the Summer of 1918, there was a second wave of a far more virulent form of the influenza virus than anyone could have anticipated. Soon dubbed â€˜Spanish Fluâ€™ after its effects were reported in the countryâ€™s newspapers, the virus rapidly spread across much of the globe to become one of the worst natural disasters in human history. 
To mark the centenary and to highlight vital scientific research, the University of Cambridge has made a new film exploring what we have learnt about Spanish Flu, the urgent threat posed by influenza today, and how scientists are preparing for future pandemics.","2018-11-30T09:33:08.000Z","UCc5vZEM1MLUzCrg_aZIJdeA","Cambridge University","4023132","45922","1481","0","725","Education"

Algorithms can already detect Parkinson's disease and cancer, and control both cars and aircraft. How will AI change our society in the future?

This documentary journeys to the hot spots of AI research in Europe, the USA and China, and looks at the revolutionary developments which are currently taking place. The rapid growth of AI offers many opportunities, but also many dangers. AI can be used to create sound and video recordings which will make it more and more difficult to distinguish between fact and fiction. It will make the world of work more efficient and many professions superfluous. Algorithms can decide whether to grant loans, who is an insurance risk, and how good employees are. But there is a huge problem: humans can no longer comprehend how algorithms arrive at their decisions. And another big problem is AIâ€™s capacity for widespread surveillance. The Chinese city of Rongcheng is already using an AI-supported 'social credit system' to monitor and assess its citizens. Does AI pose a danger to our personal freedoms or democracy? Which decisions can we leave to the algorithms - and which do we want to? And what are AIâ€™s social implications?

To discover what it really says, the first step is to read the text carefully. Wills has done just that, and his meticulous analysis clears away the accumulated distortions that have led to misunderstandings on questions ranging from the Islamic stand on religious war to the requirements that women wear veils. By comparing the Qurâ€™an to the Bible, Wills, who studied for the priesthood before becoming a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and writer on politics and religion, finds many parallels between the texts, including rich passages that offer multiple meanings. His scholarly, open-minded approach invites people of all faiths to engage with this rich and inspiring text.

It touches on all aspects of society - private life, business, security -- including in the spread of fake news and the challenges posed by the advent of autonomous weapons.

This documentary looks at the rapid change digitalization is causing as it unfolds. In particular, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence are opening completely new horizons. In their film about AI, Tilman Wolff and Ranga Yogeshwar examine the role AI plays in the spread of fake news. They also consider a future with robots and the risks and ethical questions posed by the development of autonomous weapons. To address these issues, they travel the globe to speak with leading experts. AI can generate perfectly forged sound and videos, making it effective for purveying fake news. Discerning the truth from fiction will become increasingly difficult. Technology will streamline work, making some jobs surplus to requirements. Software will pilot self-driving cars and aerial drones. AI is rapidly opening up new vistas, but turning blind corners at speed can be risky. How sensible is this type of progress, and at which point should society step in and set limits to its development?

Over 50 million car tires are sold each year in Germany alone. But where does the natural rubber for them come from?

The biggest producer of natural rubber for tires is Thailand. More than four million tonnes of rubber are harvested annually in plantations there. And demand for rubber is ever growing - because ever more tires are needed. But the labor conditions in Southeast Asia are harsh - with working days of up to 12 hours and very low wages. In addition, toxic herbicides banned in Europe are used to fight weeds on the plantations. After the harvest, the â€˜white goldâ€™ rubber is sold to brokers, who, in turn, sell it on. German tire manufacturers, like Continental, for example, are keen to stress that they use ""natural commodities conscientiously.â€<9d> But many car drivers donâ€™t give a second thought about where the rubber in their tires comes from - and why we donâ€™t recycle used tires more effectively.

The term ""impingement"" is very vague and doesn't tell you at all WHY the injury is occurring in the first place. Research shows there are technically two kinds of impingement: external (or subacromial) and internal. If you don't know which one you're dealing with and WHY the problem is occurring, your rehab exercise choice will never be as optimal as it could be. 

External impingement describes the pinching of the bursa (a small fluid filled â€œair bagâ€<9d>) or rotator cuff tendons against the ceiling created by the acromion bone. The subacromial space is the space between the acromion and the rotator cuff/soft tissue structures. Internal impingement occurs when the tendons of the rotator cuff are pinched between the â€œballâ€<9d> of the humerus and the edge (usually the back side) of the socket â€œtee.â€<9d> Because these classifications are based on where the impingement occurs, they often bring out pain in different parts of the shoulder.

External impingement for example often creates pain on the front side of your shoulder as you raise your arm overhead. Internal impingement creates pain on the backside of the shoulder as the arm is elevated and externally rotated.

To understand WHY your shoulder impingement is occurring we'll need to uncover: 
1) Mobility imbalances
2) Stability imbalances
3) Coordination imbalances

For years, the worldâ€™s central banks have been pursuing a policy of cheap money. The first and foremost is the ECB (European Central Bank), which buys bad stocks and bonds to save banks, tries to fuel economic growth and props up states that are in debt. But what relieves state budgets to the tune of hundreds of billions annoys savers: interest rates are close to zero.

The fiscal policies of the central banks are causing an uncontrolled global deluge of money. Experts are warning of new bubbles. In real estate, for example: itâ€™s not just in German cities that prices are shooting up. In London, a one-bed apartment can easily cost more than a million Euro. More and more money is moving away from the real economy and into the speculative field. Highly complex financial bets are taking place in the global casino - gambling without checks and balances. The winners are set from the start: in Germany and around the world, the rich just get richer. Professor Max Otte says: ""This flood of money has caused a dangerous redistribution. Those who have, get more."" But with low interest rates, any money in savings accounts just melts away. Those with debts can be happy. But big companies that want to swallow up others are also happy: they can borrow cheap money for their acquisitions. Coupled with the liberalization of the financial markets, money deals have become detached from the real economy. But itâ€™s not just the banks that need a constant source of new, cheap money today. So do states. They need it to keep a grip on their mountains of debt. Itâ€™s a kind of snowball system. What happens to our money? Is a new crisis looming? The film 'The Money Deluge' casts a new and surprising light on our money in these times of zero interest rates.

Written and presented by Dr David Starkey, this is the compelling story of two of England's most striking monarchs: a brother and sister, tied by blood and affection, and torn apart by religion, power, and some of the bloodiest episodes in English history. Mary (who was to become England's first reigning Queen since Matilda but who is best known to generations of British schoolchildren as Bloody Mary) was the first born child of Henry VIII. For 20 years she was heir to her adored father. Then came the birth of her little half-brother Edward, and Mary found herself cast into the shadows, ignored by her father and declared illegitimate by Act of Parliament. Nonetheless she became very attached to the motherless boy, and he to her, declaring her his dearest sister. When Edward was just nine, their father died and the young boy became King, surrounded by advisors and further distanced from his beloved elder sister. But by now they were divided not just by power and status, but also by faith. Mary was a staunch Catholic, Edward a reforming Protestant: at this time such matters were not an issue of personal choice but matters of life or death, treason or heresy. Within a few years Mary was under virtual house arrest and banned from celebrating mass; within a few more years Edward was dead at the tragically early age of 16 and Mary became Queen. She set about making England a Catholic country once more and hundreds of Protestants, including Edward's most trusted advisors, were burnt at the stake because they refused to renounce their faith.

Some call it a useful dowry of evolution, others a fault in the human genetic make-up: The old mortal sin Greed seems to be more ubiquitous than ever. Why can't people ever get enough, where is this self-indulgence leading - and are there any ways out of this vicious circle of gratification?

""People like to have a lot of stuff because it makes them the feeling of living forever,"" says American social psychologist Sheldon Solomon, who believes today's materialism and consumerism will have disastrous consequences.

Anyone who fails to satisfy his or her desires in this age of the Ego is deemed a loser. But with more than 7 billion people on the Earth, the ramifications of this excessive consumption of resources are already clear. Isnâ€™t the deplorable state of our planet proof enough that ""The Greed Program,"" which has made us crave possessions, status and power, is coming to an end? Or is the frenzied search for more and more still an indispensable part of our nature? We set off to look for the essence of greed. And we tell the stories of people who - whether as perpetrators or victims or even just as willing consumers - have become accomplices in a sea change in values.

William Lane Craig vs. Christopher Hitchens - Full Debate [HD]","On April 4, 2009, William Lane Craig and Christopher Hitchens met at Biola University to debate the question of Godâ€™s existence. Craig is one of the worldâ€™s foremost Christian apologists. Hitchens, is a leading spokesman for the â€œnew atheismâ€<9d> movement. 

In front of an overflow crowd and a global internet audience, they debated the origin and design of the universe, the implications of human morality, the deity of Jesus, and the validity of Christâ€™s resurrection. It was a compelling clash of worldviews and an examination of the major arguments for and against Christianity and atheism.","2014-09-28T20:10:26Z","UCKV0U8AoniJsHC32wkupUcg","BiolaUniversity","1850276","15130","1290","0","36583","Education"

The sexual abuse coupled with the uprising by the Protestant Wyatt against Queen Mary, which led to Elizabethâ€™s imprisonment in the Tower of London, may have resulted in the Queenâ€™s deep mistrust of men.

Elizabeth, the virgin Queen, the most powerful woman in English history. She emerged as a young princess against a backdrop of civil unrest, political intrigue, executions and coups. She ruled for 45 years and presided over a new kind of state. Her reign saw England emerge from the threat of European annexation to burst forth in a unique flowering of culture and became the worldâ€™s leading sea power. In this four part series David Starkey charts the rise and fall of her reign and reveals the powerful resonance it has for the present. This series covers one of the most glamorous and exciting reigns in English history, with bloodthirsty tales of sex, lust, murder and mayhem.

This documentary provides unique insights on everyday life in the East Asian country, which most people associate with dictatorship, military parades and nuclear missile testing.

Perhaps no other country in the world is as mysterious as North Korea. In the West, itâ€™s known as the last Stalinist dictatorship, the land of dictator Kim Jong Un, bombastic military parades and nuclear missile tests. And it is actually quite difficult to look beyond the political and examine the daily life of 25 million North Koreans. Are they allowed to laugh, dance and marry? What do they eat? Where do they go on holiday? These simple questions are difficult to answer given the isolation of the population from the rest of the world. The filmmakers behind Have Fun in Pyongyang visited people who have lived in the isolated mountainous nation for three generations. Over eight years, they visited North Korea forty times to attend festivals and harvest ceremonies, visit factories and listen to singing contests, in the process catching surprising, fascinating and bizarre glimpses of everyday life in North Korea. The documentary gives us an insight into North Korean life and helps us understand how the impoverished, isolated country has survived the end of the Cold War, the famine of the 1990s that cost hundreds of thousands their lives, and the never-ending diplomatic and military conflicts.

The case calls into question whole areas of accepted scientific fact from botany, through chemistry to archaeology. In 1992, routine tests on a mummy in a Munich museum revealed high body levels of cocaine and nicotine. But such substances were not available in ancient Egypt, coming as they do from the Americas â€“ not, apparently, to be â€œdiscoveredâ€<9d> for thousands of years after the passing of the Egyptian dynasties. Are the mummies fakes; were the substances from plants that have since disappeared or were there, in fact, trade routes between Egypt and South America that predate accepted chronology?

Host of The Daily Show, Noah gained an international audience at the 2012 Edinburgh Fringe Festival with his furiously energetic and hilarious one-man show, The Racist. Now he looks back over the experiences that have fueled his career, charting his coming-of-age in South Africa. Born to a white, Swiss-German father and a black Xhosa mother, Noah was, under apartheid, illegal; after apartheid, as the country came to grips with its past and the chaos of its future, he developed a keen eye for the absurdities of politics, race, and nationalism. If survival is the theme of his book, his mother, the consummate survivor, is its heart, and Noahâ€™s depictions of her fierce Christianity, her savvy hustling, and her determination are as moving as they are funny.

Noah is in conversation with New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.

Unmanned tractors controlled via GPS; drones that kill vermin in the fields from above; and highly efficient bull sperm used to produce genetically optimized calves. This is not science fiction. Itâ€™s the future of farming, today. ""Smart farming"" is the agricultural industry's new buzzword. A survey of almost 600 German farmers has revealed that more than one in two now uses digital solutions to optimize their harvests. Fierce regional and global competition, declining subsidies, higher standards of food quality, environmental protection, and increasing demand are forcing farmers to be highly efficient. This documentary looks at three examples of ""smart farming"" in Germany. Breeding consultant Johanna Schendel creates optimized dairy cows by selecting the right bull semen. Asparagus farmer Heiner Bartels uses a smartphone to calculate the optimum time to harvest. And drone pilot Bernd Meyer is out to fight pests in maize fields from the air. All three are trying to use modern technology to modify nature to fit the needs of our society. But where are the limits?

We need to establish ethical standards in dealing with artificial intelligence - and to answer the question: What still makes us as human beings unique?

Mankind is still decades away from self-learning machines that are as intelligent as humans. But already today, chatbots, robots, digital assistants and other artificially intelligent entities exist that can emulate certain human abilities. Scientists and AI experts agree that we are in a race against time: we need to establish ethical guidelines before technology catches up with us.  While AI Professor JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber predicts artificial intelligence will be able to control robotic factories in space, the Swedish-American physicist Max Tegmark warns against a totalitarian AI surveillance state, and the philosopher Thomas Metzinger predicts a deadly AI arms race. But Metzinger also believes that Europe in particular can play a pioneering role on the threshold of this new era: creating a binding international code of ethics.

Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has become the richest man in the world. Every second Euro in online trading is spent at Amazon. Is the IT giant, with its unabated growth, about to turn our economic system upside down?

Amazon is a machine that can simultaneously observe, compare and analyze more than 300 million people worldwide. The company is not just a marketplace, market supervisor and provider of more and more services and consumer items - it also controls all the data streams in this market and uses them to its own benefit. Who suspects that a single click on an Amazon page will forward information to the company that fills a printed DIN-A-4 page? A conversation with Alexa, watching a streaming offer on Amazon-Prime, ordering vegetables via Amazon-Fresh - all this put together creates a whole library of information about every customer. The group collects everything - it just wonâ€™t reveal what conclusions it draws from it. What would be possible if data from other, new business areas were added? In the USA, Amazon is also active in the health and insurance sectors, and police officers are using its facial recognition software to search for wanted persons.

A study in a British prison found that inmates who took vitamin supplements were less prone to violent behavior. And in Germany, a psychologist at the University of LÃ¼beck has shown that social behavior is influenced by the ingredients consumed at breakfast. But what really happens in the brain when we opt for honey instead of jam, and fish rather than sausage? Scientists around the world are trying to find out. Neuro-nutrition is the name of an interdisciplinary research field that investigates the impact of nutrition on brain health. Experiments on rats and flies offer new insight into the effects of our eating habits. When laboratory rats are fed a diet of junk food, the result is not just obesity. The menu also has a direct influence on their memory performance. The role of the intestinal flora has been known for some time, but scientists are currently discovering other relationships. So-called ""brain food"" for example: The Mediterranean diet thatâ€™s based on vegetables and fish is said to provide the best nutrition for small grey cells. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, for example, protect the nerve cells and are indispensable for the development of the brain - because the brain is also what it eats!

But Germanyâ€™s central bank and government are still clinging on to cash. Can they stop the move towards a cashless society? Our documentary shows who is behind the worldwide anti-cash lobby. Banks want to get rid of coins and bills for cost reasons, and politicians think less cash will cut the rug out from under criminals and terrorists. Central bankers want to abolish cash because it would make it easier for them to enforce negative interest rates. And digital payment companies like Paypal or Visa simply want to profit from money transactions and collect as much financial data about consumers as they can. Their aim is to gain complete control over our buying behavior. For example, the ""Better than Cash Alliance"" in New York is supported by financial corporations such as Visa or Mastercard. They say the more people that are integrated into the international financial system, the more growth and jobs it will promote. But as our financial behavior becomes more and more transparent, states are also using payment data to find out more about us. The ordinary citizenâ€™s view of cash as a store of value, independent of third party interests, is being increasingly ignored. But for them, cash is and will remain a symbol of freedom.

Now a days, due to staying indoors, it is possible that you will develop the deficiency of vitamin D. Get this checked by your doctor and use the correct dose to stay healthy.

Here are my notes:
Daily 10 microgram or 400 IU/Day

Lippincottâ€™s Biochemistry Review 4th Edition. Page 388
Daily 5 mg of cholecalciferol or 200 IU of Vitamin D.

However, 800 IU/Day is shown to reduce the incidence of osteoporotic fractures.
800 IU/Day recommended by the Institute of Medicine to maintain bone health.

Frank deficiency is when the levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25OHD) is less than 20 ng/mL (50 mmol/L)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6305614/
No consensus that the oral vitamin D supplements are helpful

Ergocalciferol from plants is called Vitamin D2
Cholecalciferol from the animal tissue is called Vitamin D3

7 deidro-cholesterol to (UV light) to cholecalciferol (D3) to 25 hydroxylase in liver to 25 OH D to -hydroxycholecalciferol 1-hydroxylase in kidney to 1,25 DiOH D3




Vitamin D Receptors are abbreviated to VDR in the notes. These are cytosolic receptors.

https://www.newscientist.com/article/2121424-vitamin-d-supplements-may-prevent-millions-of-winter-infections/
Deficiency of vitamin D makes people more susceptible to respiratory tract infections.
Vitamin D supplement can reduce these infections by 12% 
Keep in mind, this is for those who are deficient in this vitamin. If you are not deficient, then it will not make a difference. Because, you are already good.
Evidence is not sufficient to say that vitamin D helps prevent respiratory infections.

2018 Study
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6305614/
People with autoimmune diseases commonly have hypovitaminosis D

What are cathelicidins?
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/cathelicidin

What are beta defensins?
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_defensin


2011 Study

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3166406/
Activation of TLR and PAMPs on macrophages increases the production of 1, alpha hydroxylase and the VDR. This in turn causes more production of cathelicidine and beta defensins 4.

Vitamin D also affects monocytes to reduce production of IL1, IL6, IL8, IL12, and TNF. Regulating the immune response.

Vitamin D acts on the dendritic cells to inhibit/reduce their differentiation and maturation. It reduces their MHCII expression, co-stimulatory molecules like CD40, CD80, CD86, decreased production of IL-12 etc.

2013 Study
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3756814/
Vitamin D improves immune system by helping produce cathelicidine and by helping modulate inflammatory cascade. Especially for the respiratory infections.
It also helps produce NFk-B (nuclear factor kappa light chain for activated B cells.)

(
Notes about the NFkB
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NF-%CE%BAB
Helps with cytokine production and cell survival.
NFk-B factor becomes active when T and B cell receptors become active. Its activation causes the gene expressions that allow T cell development, maturation, and proliferation.
T and B cells have Vitamin D receptors that help them produce NFk-B
)

Continuing the notes from the study:
In pulmonary infections. Lung epithelial cells are able to convert inactive vitamin D to its active form. This active Vitamin D then helps produce cathelicidine. Which helps kill the pathogens.

Vitamin D seems to favor TH2 and TH17 cell activation which is anti-inflammatory profile. 
Vitamin D seems to reduce the activation of TH1 cells which are pro inflammatory by their IFN-gamma action.
A deficiency of vitamin D may dysregulate the inflammatory response of the body.

Vitamin B also increases the IkBa. This leads to inhibition of NFkB. This helps reduce the production of IL6 and IL8 by inhibiting the production of NFkB.","2020-04-07T01:58:04.000Z","UCrtd2wePvAl6RN_D-9jWVQQ","Drbeen Medical Lectures","194061","2918","197","0","819","Education"

Written and presented by Dr David Starkey, this is the compelling story of two of England's most striking monarchs: a brother and sister, tied by blood and affection, and torn apart by religion, power, and some of the bloodiest episodes in English history. Mary (who was to become England's first reigning Queen since Matilda but who is best known to generations of British schoolchildren as Bloody Mary) was the first born child of Henry VIII. For 20 years she was heir to her adored father. Then came the birth of her little half-brother Edward, and Mary found herself cast into the shadows, ignored by her father and declared illegitimate by Act of Parliament. Nonetheless she became very attached to the motherless boy, and he to her, declaring her his dearest sister. When Edward was just nine, their father died and the young boy became King, surrounded by advisors and further distanced from his beloved elder sister. But by now they were divided not just by power and status, but also by faith. Mary was a staunch Catholic, Edward a reforming Protestant: at this time such matters were not an issue of personal choice but matters of life or death, treason or heresy. Within a few years Mary was under virtual house arrest and banned from celebrating mass; within a few more years Edward was dead at the tragically early age of 16 and Mary became Queen. She set about making England a Catholic country once more and hundreds of Protestants, including Edward's most trusted advisors, were burnt at the stake because they refused to renounce their faith.

A note on 'Ivan the Terrible' - in Russia, Ivan IV has the epithet 'Ð“Ñ€Ð¾Ì<81>Ð·Ð½Ñ‹Ð¹' meaning 'Great' or 'Formidable'. So why is he known as Ivan 'the Terrible' in English? Because he was evil or useless or because of anti-Russian bias? No, because 'Terrible' in English also means awesome or formidable - this was well understood when 'Ð“Ñ€Ð¾Ì<81>Ð·Ð½Ñ‹Ð¹' was first translated into English centuries ago, but now fewer people understand this. (see definitions 3 & 4 here: http://www.dictionary.com/browse/terr...). The name stuck, and Ivan IV has been known as Ivan the Terrible ever since.

âž¤âž¤Transcript (Partial):
The Greeks had the maxim â€œknow thyselfâ€<9d>. How do we come to know ourselves in terms of our personalities, and more importantly, potential? Well, one of the first ways to come to know yourself is to understand that you donâ€™t.  You know, you can learn to kind of watch yourself like youâ€™re watching a stranger. But you have to adopt a positionâ€”this is a position of radical humility, I would sayâ€”humility in two senses. So, one sense would be: humility of recognizing your ignorance. So you have to understand that you donâ€™t know who you are. And thatâ€™s not easy to understand, because you think you know, but then you know, you remember you canâ€™t control yourself very well, youâ€™re not very disciplined, you're full of flaws, maybe you donâ€™t know yourself as well as you think. But itâ€™s hard to get low enough to understand how deeply it is the case that you are ignorant about who you are. Now, thereâ€™s an upside to that, too, which also is that youâ€™re also ignorant about who you could be. And so, the discovery of that, you know, is some reward for the horror of determining who you actually are. Then I would say, wellâ€”then you watch yourself. You watch yourself like youâ€™re watching a stranger. You watch what you say and you listen. You think, well, what sort of person would say that? And how am I reacting emotionally when Iâ€™m communicating in that manner? Is that making me feel stronger or weaker? Is it filling me with shame? Is it helping my confidence? Am I laying out a lie? Am I deceiving myself and other people? Am I adopting this personality at parties that is designed to impress and to amuse and it comes across as nothing but self centered narcissism? What are my dark fantasies? What are my aggressive fantasies? What is it that Iâ€™m willing to do? What am I interested in so that Iâ€™ll spontaneously pursue it? What do I procrastinate about and why? What am I unwilling to do? What do I think is good? What do I congratulate myself for accomplishing? And what do I berate myself for failing to confront and to implement? Those are all incredibly complicated questions and you donâ€™t know the answers to them. So thatâ€™sâ€”thatâ€™s a start. And then, in terms of potential, well, youâ€™ll discover a little bit more about your potential as you discover who you are, especially the darker parts about yourself, because then you discover your potential for mayhem. Thereâ€™s some real utility in that. Itâ€™s actually something that strengthens you, because the first thing that a realization like that can in fact produce is the ambition to incorporate that dangerousness into a higher order personality, and that can make you implacable. That can make you someone who can say â€œnoâ€<9d> when you need to say â€œno.â€<9d> You know? That can make you someone who wonâ€™t avoid necessary conflict. And so thatâ€™s unbelievably useful. And so thatâ€™s one of the potentials that you might discover. The other thing you do to discover your potential is toâ€”well you challenge yourself. You know, itâ€™s likeâ€”Rule 4 in my book â€œ12 Rules for Lifeâ€<9d> is: compare yourself to who you were yesterday and not to who someone else is today, and thatâ€™s kind of a good way to start this, itâ€™s likeâ€”well, take a bit of a look at yourself and think about whatâ€™s not so good that you could improveâ€”that you should improve by your own standards...

In the video, the viewer gets an up-close look as Grandin interacts with a flock of 15,000 birds roaming easily down the football-field length of a climate-controlled turkey house. When readied for market, those turkeys ride up into conveyor loading trucks and to an orderly delivery at the processing plant. 

There, the process of humanely stunning the birds renders them unconscious before processing under the watchful presence of USDA government inspectors enforcing safe and sanitary preparation. At each step along the methodical movement of rinsing, cleaning and separating the meat from the carcass, Grandin provides context and common sense explanations. The reality of raising and preparing turkeys for market is revealed in the video for what it is: a modern process that is humane, safe and efficient.","2013-10-08T17:53:58.000Z","UCAgAiFoPyxcoBPW8uX8lafA","NatlTurkeyFederation","2996829","11074","2010","0","60","Education"

It was a risky time both spiritually and politically. The Pharaoh had not prepared anything for his journey to the afterlife, nor had he named a successor. Tradition dictated that he must be buried within 70 days, and there were several pretenders to his throne. Using an effective combination of narration, atmospheric re-enactments and expert contributions, this exciting programme captures the full drama of The Race to Bury King Tut.

Written and presented by Dr David Starkey, this is the compelling story of two of England's most striking monarchs: a brother and sister, tied by blood and affection, and torn apart by religion, power, and some of the bloodiest episodes in English history. Mary (who was to become England's first reigning Queen since Matilda but who is best known to generations of British schoolchildren as Bloody Mary) was the first born child of Henry VIII. For 20 years she was heir to her adored father. Then came the birth of her little half-brother Edward, and Mary found herself cast into the shadows, ignored by her father and declared illegitimate by Act of Parliament. Nonetheless she became very attached to the motherless boy, and he to her, declaring her his dearest sister. When Edward was just nine, their father died and the young boy became King, surrounded by advisors and further distanced from his beloved elder sister. But by now they were divided not just by power and status, but also by faith. Mary was a staunch Catholic, Edward a reforming Protestant: at this time such matters were not an issue of personal choice but matters of life or death, treason or heresy. Within a few years Mary was under virtual house arrest and banned from celebrating mass; within a few more years Edward was dead at the tragically early age of 16 and Mary became Queen. She set about making England a Catholic country once more and hundreds of Protestants, including Edward's most trusted advisors, were burnt at the stake because they refused to renounce their faith.

We know that horses are social creatures and recent research shows that they use up to 17 different facial expressions to communicate with each other. Weâ€™ve also discovered that theyâ€™re able to interpret the expressions in our faces,  which enables them to form bonds with humans.

Anderson doesnâ€™t believe in breaking horses; instead he â€œstartsâ€<9d> them. In Equus: Story of The Horse, we see Anderson work his magic with Shiver, an â€œunbrokeâ€<9d> two-year-old colt. Within a single morning, Anderson puts a saddle on Shiver, climbs on without any bucking, and takes him for a ride.

â€œThe authorities and the government stupidly did not believe that the epidemic would reach Sweden at all,â€<9d> Bo Lundback, professor of epidemiology at the University of Gothenburg, told the outlet.




An interview with a Swedish reporter.

Excerpt 
Although the longer-term impact is obviously unknown, Swedenâ€™s strategy is not expected to preserve the countryâ€™s economy this year any more than those of countries imposing stricter lockdowns: Magdalena Andersson, the finance minister, said on Wednesday GDP could shrink by 10% this year and unemployment rise to 13.5%.


Tegnell rejected the criticism and disputed the figures on which it was based. He previously said Sweden and its neighbours were on â€œdifferent places on the curveâ€<9d>, and that Sweden had â€œunfortunately had a large spread of contagion in care homes for the elderly, something you have not seen in the other Nordic countriesâ€<9d>.


The chief epidemiologist has repeatedly stressed that the world is in uncharted territory with the coronavirus, arguing that while Sweden might have more infections in the short term, it will not face the risk of a huge infection increase that many other countries might face once their strict lockdowns are lifted.","2020-04-17T13:31:09.000Z","UCrtd2wePvAl6RN_D-9jWVQQ","Drbeen Medical Lectures","67685","714","152","0","1242","Education"

For the middle classes, work is no longer a means of advancement. Instead, they are struggling to maintain their position and status. Young people today have less disposable income than previous generations. This documentary explores the question of inequality in Germany, providing both background analysis and statistics. The filmmakers interview leading researchers and experts on the topic. And they accompany Christoph GrÃ¶ner, one of Germanyâ€™s biggest real estate developers, as he goes about his work. ""If you have great wealth, you canâ€™t fritter it away through consumption. If you throw money out the window, it comes back in through the front door,â€<9d> GrÃ¶ner says. The real estate developer builds multi-family residential units in cities across Germany, sells condominium apartments, and is involved in planning projects that span entire districts.  ""Entrepreneurs are more powerful than politicians, because weâ€™re more independent,â€<9d> GrÃ¶ner concludes. Leading researchers and experts on the topic of inequality also weigh in, including Nobel-prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, economist Thomas Piketty, and Brooke Harrington, who carried out extensive field research among investors from the ranks of the international financial elite. Branko MilanoviÄ‡, a former lead economist at the World Bank, says that globalization is playing a role in rising inequality. The losers of globalization are the lower-middle class of affluent countries like Germany. ""These people are earning the same today as 20 years ago,"" MilanoviÄ‡ notes. ""Just like a century ago, humankind is standing at a crossroads. Will affluent countries allow rising equality to tear apart the fabric of society? Or will they resist this trend?â€<9d>

Why does it kill some people and not others?

Welcome to another video, for those of you who donâ€™t know me, Iâ€™m doctor mike Hansen, I am a real doctor who specializes in pulmonary medicine, critical care medicine, and internal medicine. 

When Iâ€™m not working in the hospital or pulmonary clinic, Iâ€™m at home working on making these videos for you, to deliver you accurate medical expertise, to the best of my ability (especially during this pandemic). 

This virus, we know, is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, and through contact, by getting into our mucosa, like our mouth, nose, and eyes. Although less common, it also can be transmitted through aerosol, meaning airborne. Most likely when you have people in an enclosed space, such as an elevator, and someone sneezes or coughs without covering their mouths, and someone else can inhale it in. 

This virus attaches to cells in our body by this ACE2 receptor. This ACE2 receptor is only located on certain cells in our body. It's on our tongue, in our nose, back of the throat, and in our lungs. Specifically, within the lungs, it's only located on our type II alveolar cells. 

We know that ARDS develops in about 4 to 5% of COVID-19 patients. And of all the people who get COVID19, the mortality rate is around 1 to 2%. So why do some COVID-19 patients get ARDS, and why do some die? There are different reasons, and let's talk about them. It could be one of these reasons, but more likely itâ€™s a combination of these reasons.

1) The virus only gains entry into our cells that express the ACE2 receptor. They are located in multiple sites. Besides being in the lung, theyâ€™re in your mouth, nose, throat, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, brain, and testes.

2) It makes sense that if the virus only gets into your mouth or nose or throat, but not the lungs, that it would cause only cold-like symptoms. But if the virus gets all the way down into the alveoli of your lungs, thatâ€™s what's going to cause ARDS.  And by the way, the ACE2 receptors in your gut probably explains why some patients get nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 

3) The amount of virus that you get into your body likely determines how sick you get. This is what we call the viral load. 

4) The inflammatory reaction that occurs with COVID-19 is extremely complicated with lots of different proteins and hormones and interleukins at play. But there are several known genetic polymorphisms of these proteins that likely make some people more prone to getting worse illnesses than others. A genetic polymorphism simply means a variation on a particular gene. For example, there are genetic polymorphisms for the ACE gene, as well as IL-6. Basically, a lot of it just comes down to our genes.   And sex. 

5) Because the 5th reason has to do with estrogen. Estrogen is known to inhibit the effects of IL-6, which plays a huge role in this cytokine storm. This might explain why women overall have less severe disease compared to men. 
6) And the 6th reason is because of people who are already taking certain medications. For those people who are already on and ACEI such as lisinopril, or an ARB such as losartan, or telmisartan, or candesartan, or irbesartan. Or people who take hydroxychloroquine for lupus or rheumatoid disease. Or people who take tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor. Are these patients less prone to getting severe illness? My guess is yes.

Tickets to the event are $56 per person and include a buffet dinner in the Air Force One Pavilion following the program. Books must be purchased in the Reagan Library Museum Store to receive signature.

Rich Little is a master mimic of more than 200 voices and currently has a Las Vegas Show at the Tropicana Hotel. Rich Little has a voice for every administration including U.S. Presidents: John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, both George Bushes and Barack Obama. Infamous for his skewering of political figures, Little has charmed, amused, intrigued and gotten the best of politicians from here to his native Canada. He entertained at both of Ronald Reaganâ€™s presidential inaugurations and got to know the Reagans very well during that time. President Reagan used to tell Little, â€œYou do me better than I do.â€<9d>

In Little by Little, Rich Little shares his story of how he grew up to become an impersonator. In this gem of a book are insights into the likes of many of the great people he had the privilege and fortune to meet and imitate, shining new light on our beloved stars, including a chapter on Ronald Reagan. This is really not a biography, but more of a humorous glimpse of the people heâ€™s impersonated and some of the funny stories that happened along the way.

It was deadly, devastating and attacked those who were promiscuous, well-heeled and well-travelled. But what was Syphilis and where had it come from? The traditional view has been that syphilis was part of ""the Columbian exchange"" â€“ one of the things, along with tobacco and the potato, that the New World gave the Old. Arriving in Spain in the 1490s with Columbus and his crew, this destructive new plague spread quickly across Europe, leaving no country, no city, no royal household untouched. But what if this assumption is wrong? There is evidence of syphilis in skeletons dug from sites in France, Italy and England. Bones found in a medieval graveyard in Hull show signs of the ravages of syphilis. But if syphilis was present in Europe before Columbus went to America, why was the 1495 outbreak so deadly? And why did everyone see it as an entirely new plague?

Sheikh Yusuf Estes embraced Islam at the age of 50 after meeting with a Muslim for the first time in his life. Until then, he had the belief that all Muslims were terrorists and bombers. He was a priest and Christian musician minister as well as owner of several music stores.

Sheikh Yusuf, a former preacher against Islam despised having to meet with a Muslim but being a dutiful servant of the cross, he decided he would convert this Muslim who needed to be saved in the name of Jesus. However his encounter with this Muslim and the events that followed impacted him and his family greatly. Eventually he and his wife and children embraced Islam, as well as his father and stepmother. 

Since then Sheikh Yusuf Estes has been very active in the Muslim community  he runs several Islamic websites where you can find many useful lectures and information. Sheikh Yusuf also runs an online radio station whereby he broadcasts live talks to both Muslims and non-Muslims. Thousands of reversions have occurred at his hands by the will of Allah  and once 135 people reverted at the same time. 
Alhamdulillah! May Allah reward him for his effort.

The Great Plague of 1665 killed 100,000 Londoners â€“ one in three of the people living in the city. While kept diaries have provided terrifying testaments to the horrors of that summer, other stories have been hidden in the archives of London churches for centuries. Rare documents unearthed in some of the cities oldest places of worship now tell the story of what it was like for an ordinary person, more often than not living in poverty, as the plague swept through London. This factual drama follows the lives of those living in Cock and Key Alley, one of the dank and dismal yards squeezed between Fleet Street and the Thames â€“ and brings to life 17th Century London at one of its most frightening moments.

The reality is that they became wealthy by being productive, and that there is no other period in history which saw such a rapid and widespread improvement in the well-being of the average individual; (2) The myth that the Great Depression was caused by a failure of business, when it was, in fact, produced by a failure of government and specifically by the Federal Reserve System; (3) The myth that government in the economy has expanded in response to public demand, when, actually, the public has had to be sold ""hard"" for politicians to enact every major social program; (4) The ""free lunch"" myth, which forces the individual to pay more, no matter how the government raises money - by taxing individuals, by taxing businesses, or by printing more money; and (5) The myth that government, like Robin Hood, transfers wealth from the rich to the poor, when the reality is that the government usually transfers wealth and income from both the very rich and the very poor to those in the middle.

Coronavirus | COVID-19 YouTube Video Playlist: 
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgqCliyXQhezro4JBt2zJDWo7XdCTn_45

Welcome to another video, for those of you who donâ€™t know me, Iâ€™m doctor mike Hansen, I am a real doctor who specializes in pulmonary medicine, critical care medicine, and internal medicine. 

When Iâ€™m not working in the hospital or pulmonary clinic, Iâ€™m at home working on making these videos for you, to deliver you accurate medical expertise, to the best of my ability (especially during this pandemic). 

This virus, we know, is mainly transmitted by respiratory droplets, and through contact, by getting into our mucosa, like our mouth, nose, and eyes. Although less common, it also can be transmitted through aerosol, meaning airborne. Most likely when you have people in an enclosed space, such as an elevator, and someone sneezes or coughs without covering their mouths, and someone else can inhale it in. 

This virus attaches to cells in our body by this ACE2 receptor. This ACE2 receptor is only located on certain cells in our body. It's on our tongue, in our nose, back of the throat, and in our lungs. Specifically, within the lungs, it's only located on our type II alveolar cells. 

We know that ARDS develops in about 4 to 5% of COVID-19 patients. And of all the people who get COVID19, the mortality rate is around 1 to 2%. So why do some COVID-19 patients get ARDS, and why do some die? There are different reasons, and let's talk about them. It could be one of these reasons, but more likely itâ€™s a combination of these reasons.

1) The virus only gains entry into our cells that express the ACE2 receptor. They are located in multiple sites. Besides being in the lung, theyâ€™re in your mouth, nose, throat, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, brain, and testes.

2) It makes sense that if the virus only gets into your mouth or nose or throat, but not the lungs, that it would cause only cold-like symptoms. But if the virus gets all the way down into the alveoli of your lungs, thatâ€™s what's going to cause ARDS.  And by the way, the ACE2 receptors in your gut probably explains why some patients get nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. 

3) The amount of virus that you get into your body likely determines how sick you get. This is what we call the viral load. 

4) The inflammatory reaction that occurs with COVID-19 is extremely complicated with lots of different proteins and hormones and interleukins at play. But there are several known genetic polymorphisms of these proteins that likely make some people more prone to getting worse illnesses than others. A genetic polymorphism simply means a variation on a particular gene. For example, there are genetic polymorphisms for the ACE gene, as well as IL-6. Basically, a lot of it just comes down to our genes.   And sex. 

5) Because the 5th reason has to do with estrogen. Estrogen is known to inhibit the effects of IL-6, which plays a huge role in this cytokine storm. This might explain why women overall have less severe disease compared to men. 
6) And the 6th reason is because of people who are already taking certain medications. For those people who are already on and ACEI such as lisinopril, or an ARB such as losartan, or telmisartan, or candesartan, or irbesartan. Or people who take hydroxychloroquine for lupus or rheumatoid disease. Or people who take tocilizumab, an IL-6 receptor inhibitor. Are these patients less prone to getting severe illness? My guess is yes.

When it comes to global trade, it would seem that trickery, threats and deception are the order of the day - yet all this takes place largely beyond the reach of the public eye. Donald Trump has made ""America Firstâ€<9d> his agenda and rallying cry. Along with aiming sharp criticism at global export champion Germany, Trump has also introduced punitive tariffs and warned of further measures. Will this fresh wave of protectionism lead to economic isolationism and threaten global free trade? And what about those for whom free tradeâ€™s promise of prosperity increasingly rings hollow? Around the world, many people have come to regard themselves as the losers of globalization. If the true winners of free trade and globalization are not ordinary citizens, has the time come to revise the liberal orthodoxy of free trade? This documentary visits Germany, Switzerland, the United States and Cameroon to explore these issues by way of some everyday examples, including the trade in onions, floor tiles, and bicycles.

Sometime around the year 1100 BC, right at the end of the Bronze Age, a wave of destruction washed over the Eastern Mediterranean. It wiped whole civilizations off the map, and left only ash and ruin in its wake. 

This catastrophe, known as â€œthe Late Bronze Age Collapseâ€<9d>, has become one of the enduring puzzles of archaeology. I want to explore how so many societies could collapse all at once, and seemingly without warning, as well as examine the lessons it might teach us in our increasingly globalised and interconnected world.

(there are still some edits and color correction to be done but we wanted to have the YouTube version out as soon as possible)

Join critically-acclaimed author and evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins and world-renowned theoretical physicist and author Lawrence Krauss as they discuss biology, cosmology, religion, and a host of other topics. 

The authors will also discuss their new books. Dawkins recently published The Magic of Reality: How We Know What's Really True, an exploration of the magic of discovery embodied in the practice of science. Written for all age groups, the book moves forward from historical examples of supernatural explanations of natural phenomena to focus on the actual science behind how the world works.

Krauss's latest book, A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing, explains the scientific advances that provide insight into how the universe formed. Krauss tackles the age-old assumption that something cannot arise from nothing by arguing that not only can something arise from nothing, but something will always arise from nothing.

Founded in 2008, the ASU Origins Project is a university-wide transdisciplinary initiative aimed at facilitating cutting edge research and inquiry about origins questions, enhancing public science literacy, and improving science education. Since its inception, the Origins Project has brought the world's leading scientists, including Nobel Prize winners, to Tempe to explore origins questions. The Origins Project has hosted workshops and public events that have focused on questions as fundamental as the origin of the universe, how life began, the origins of human uniqueness, and the origins of morality.","2012-02-14T17:44:20.000Z","UCH_zYYXkJpULueOVZTkY4Bw","Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science","845618","12937","728","0","8489","Science & Technology"

Part 1: Introduction to Virus Ecology and Evolution: Dr. Paul Turner describes the fundamental biology of viruses, how they interact with their host organisms, and how they might have originally evolved long ago.
Â 
Part 2: Virus Adaptation to Environmental Change: Turnerâ€™s laboratory uses experimental evolution to study how viruses adapt to environmental changes. 
Â 
Part 3: Phage Therapy: Turner provides an introduction to phage therapy, and how it can be improved by applying â€˜evolution thinkingâ€™.


Talk Overview:
In his first lecture, Dr. Paul Turner describes the fundamental biology of viruses, how they interact with their host organisms, and how they might have originally evolved long ago. He provides an overview of the many reasons why viruses might be considered the most biologically successful inhabitants of earth, including their ability to rapidly reproduce, and adapt to environmental challenges. Turner explains how viruses have impacted human history, as well as earthâ€™s history, due to their prevalent interactions with other species. Â Â Â Â Â Â 

Viruses have an incredible capacity to adapt to environmental challenges, but sometimes, the environment constraints viral adaptation. Turnerâ€™s laboratory uses experimental evolution to study how viruses adapt to environmental changes (e.g. temperature changes), and the mechanisms by which viruses jump to novel host species. Turnerâ€™s work suggests that viruses with greater capacities to block the innate immune systems of their hosts, also have a greater likelihood of emerging on new host species. Also, he describes how virus adaptation to environmental change may be constraints by trade-offs: viruses can evolve either greater reproduction or greater survival, but not both simultaneously.

Before antibiotics were discovered, scientists were using viruses of bacteria, bacteriophages, to treat bacterial infections in humans. Given the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, scientists are revisiting the idea of using phage therapy to treat infections. In his third lecture, Turner provides an introduction to phage therapy, and how it can be improved by applying â€˜evolution thinkingâ€™. His laboratory discovered phage OMKO1 that can treat multi-drug resistant bacteria in human patients while causing these bacteria to evolve greater sensitivity to antibiotics.

Speaker Biography:
Dr. Paul Turner is Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, and holds an appointment in the Microbiology Program at Yale School of Medicine. His laboratory studies how viruses evolutionarily adapt to overcome environmental challenges, such as temperature changes or infection of novel host species. Turner received his bachelorâ€™s degree in Biology from the University of Rochester in 1988, and completed his graduate studies in microbial ecology and evolution at Michigan State University in 1995.

It may have been this very internationalism that contributed to the apocalyptic disaster that ended the Bronze Age. When the end came, the civilized and international world of the Mediterranean regions came to a dramatic halt in a vast area stretching from Greece and Italy in the west to Egypt, Canaan, and Mesopotamia in the east. Large empires and small kingdoms collapsed rapidly. With their end came the worldâ€™s first recorded Dark Ages. It was not until centuries later that a new cultural renaissance emerged in Greece and the other affected areas, setting the stage for the evolution of Western society as we know it today.  Professor Eric H. Cline of The George Washington University will explore why the Bronze Age came to an end and whether the collapse of those ancient civilizations might hold some warnings for our current society.

Considered for a Pulitzer Prize for his recent book 1177 BC, Dr. Eric H.

FAQ

1) How much did this cost to build?
*****Total, i would say we put close to 1000 into the coop, but that includes things like the watering buckets, PVC pipe, and the feed dispenser.   Construction stuff has gotten so stinkin expensive! Part of the issue was the size i chose for the coop (5 X 6) which meant a significant amount of waste (plywood sheets are 4X8.  If you would do a 4X4 coop, you could probably cut that number in half.  Get your hinges at harbor freight and see if you can find a cheap window at a shed supply place.  Also, the black wire i used for the run was quite a bit more than economy stuff but i liked it more.

2)  Would I change anything about the way this was built?
***** In hindsight, yes, I would.  a) After I created this video I had to relocate the water bucket because the chickens got too tall to use it.  If the coop had been 2 or 3 inches higher off the ground it woulda worked out okay.   b) Also, I am 6'5"" tall, and I wish the run were at least that tall.  It makes for some back breaking work to walk around in there as it is now.  c) I know many people say ya don't need to heat a coop, but this one is very big for the number of birds that I have so their body heat alone is not able to keep it humanely warm on these cold nights.  (I'd add more chickens but the run is the right size for this number of birds).  All that to say, I wish I had done one of two things...insulated the coop with some foam or designed it so that I could put a temporary winter wall in the inside (reducing the size of their sleeping area and making it easier for them to keep it warmer with their body heat alone).   Did that make any sense??

3)  Why the sand?
*****I realize sand isn't as nice for the chickens as grass, but the grass was gone about two days after putting the chickens in the run...and then I had mud (which, in this part of Pennsylvania is slow draining).  I felt like like sand would at least cut down on the mud and help keep their feet a little dryer.  The sand is probably 2 or 3 inches deep, and they seem to churn it up enough that smell hasn't been a real issue.  I did dig out and replace all the sand once in the last 8 months.  

4)  Do I have blueprints of what I did here?
*****No, I kinda had a vague idea of what I wanted to do and made it up as I went.  But enough people have asked me for them that I am trying to get those together for you all by spring.  Subscribe and stay tuned and you will be the first to see them when they are done!

5)  How many eggs do you get?  
*****These are golden comet chickens, and I am blown away by the number of eggs they have been producing.  I have 7 chickens and I very rarely have a day when we don't get 7 eggs.  I expect that they have got to slow down for the winter (I live in Pennsylvania), but I've been saying that for a number of weeks now!?   It's now January 7th. 

6)  How easy is it to care for chickens?
***In the spring, summer, and fall caring for the chickens was a lot easier than I expected it would be. In the winter there is an added challenge if you live somewhere its cold, because you gotta make sure the water doesn't freeze.  I have my hose put away for the winter so i gotta walk the water out there.  

 I now have bins under the roosts where I collect their droppings and that cuts down on how often I need to clean out all the bedding.  You'll probably want to empty those bins once a week and clean out the whole coop once a month or so.  Other than that, collect the eggs, give them food and fresh water.  With this setup, and an additional water bucket I can go away for 5 days at a time without worrying too much about them.  I just arrange for neighbors to pick up the eggs (which they don't seem to mind if it means free eggs)  

If you start trying to pack too many birds into a small coop/ run, that's where you might run into more problems with the birds not getting along well. This could mean isolating birds and treating sores; I avoided all that by giving them plenty of space.  

Thanks for the thumbs up everyone! If this was helpful and you haven't given it a thumbs up yet I would appreciate it.","2013-06-10T02:10:41.000Z","UCC4R9msbwZ9owrySQ4meMGA","E Fleming","4000630","26143","1082","0","1803","Science & Technology"

""Hey, listen, you're in my house,"" Obama said. ""It's not respectful, when you get invited to somebody [...] You're not going to get a good response from me by interrupting me like this.""

Obama's answer to the heckler got a good response from the crowd, which started to boo and chant the president's name.

""Shame on you,"" Obama said to the heckler. ""You shouldn't be doing this.""

The president then offered the heckler a choice: Stay quiet or be removed. The person continued to speak, and officials escorted him out.

At this point in American history, we are the victims of a liberal sabotage of the presidency unlike anything we've ever witnessed. Nevertheless President Trump continues to fight every day to keep his promise to Make America Great Again. Today that bold idea has already led to a conservative judge on the Supreme Court, tax reform, and deregulation that has unleashed an economy stronger than anyone could have imagined.

But there are dark forces that seek to obstruct and undermine the president and reverse the results of the 2016 presidential election. They are part of a wide-ranging conspiracy that would seem incredible if it weren't being perpetrated openly. Driven by ambition, blinded by greed, and bound by a common goal-to unseat the 45th President of the United States-this cabal is determined to maintain its wrongful hold on national political power.

Jeanine Pirro is a highly respected judge, former district attorney, elected politician, sought-after legal commentator, author, and champion of women's rights. Pirro is the host of Justice with Judge Jeanine and for three years hosted Judge Jeanine Pirro, for which she won an Emmy. She also appears regularly as a legal analyst and judicial commentator on Today, Good Morning America, The Early Show, 60 Minutes, CNN, and the Fox News Channel. In 1990, she became the first elected female judge to sit on the Westchester County court bench. In 1993, Judge Pirro was also elected district attorney of Westchester County, once again setting a precedent as the first female to hold that position.

The hindrances along the way to self-discovery and personal growth are easy to overcome. Learn how from his talk. For more than 30 years, Master Shi Heng Yi has been studying and practicing the interaction between mind and body. His strength is the ability to smoothly combine this knowledge with physical exercises and to practice Martial art â€“Kung Fu and Qi Gong. He has an academic background but he prefers to live at the Shaolin Temple Europe, Monastery located in Otterberg, Germany. Since 2010 he has been taking care of the settlement and he personifies the sustainable development and spreading the Shaolin culture and philosophy. As a contemporary monk, Master Yi holds a smartphone in the folds of his clothes as he sees no contradiction between living together with ancient knowledge and high technology. â€œThe universal law of being successful and happy at the same time means finding the balanceâ€<9d>, says master Yi.  And as for flying â€“ yes, he really can do it! He only needs a stick and a little space. We expect him to fly-in and share about the Shaolin way at TEDxVitosha 2020.

We recognize that all people have questions, but very few spaces exist to have open, honest, and respectful discourse around the deepest questions humans ask. 

Join us for DIG & DELVE!

What is DIG & DELVE?

DIG & DELVE is an annual conference in Ottawa that is all about giving people a safe space to engage in discussion and explore deep issues that humans have been wrestling with for a long time.

One popular worldview promoted in our media is that it is foolish to believe in God.   Influential writers disparage those interested in considering the relevance of faith to life.

Faith is the great cop-out, the great excuse to evade the need to think and evaluate evidence. Faith is belief in spite of, even perhaps because of, the lack of evidence.   â€“ Richard Dawkins

At DIG & DELVE we hope to provide an open, honest and respectful environment where people can explore reasons why faith makes sense and why it is meaningful to give consideration to the life and teaching of Jesus.   We hope to encourage curiosity and a healthy critical inquisitiveness.   People coming from a spectrum of world-views, Christian and otherwise, are welcome.

At DIG & DELVE, we gather talented experts in their fields to come and share their opinions about deep issues human wrestle with and together we discuss some of the latest research around these questions.

Expect to be challenged.  Join us at DIG & DELVE.

In his new book, ""What the Qurâ€™an Meant"", he offers a timely reconsideration of the sacred text. Reading with sympathy and rigor, Wills takes us back to the words themselves to discover how they have guided people down through the centuries and what other nonâ€“Muslimsâ€”such as Pope Francisâ€”have found so inspiring.

His unorthodox, yet simple approach, has wielded surprising results and just might be the solution for all racial discourse.

Daryl Davis graduated from Howard University with a degree in Jazz. As a pianist, vocalist, and guitarist, he performs nationally and internationally with The Daryl Davis Band. He has also worked with such notables as Chuck Berry, Elvis Presleyâ€™s Jordanaires, The Legendary Blues Band, and many others.

In 1983, A chance occurrence after one of his performances led him to befriend a member of the Ku Klux Klan. This eventually led Daryl to become the first black author to travel the country interviewing KKK leaders and members, all detailed in his book, Klan-Destine Relationships. Today, Daryl owns numerous Klan robes and hoods, given to him by active members who became his friends and renounced the organization.

Since his journey began, Davis has joined an all-white country band, attended KKK rallies, and accepted a â€œcertificate of friendshipâ€<9d> from the Traditionalist American Knights of the KKK. Heâ€™s even the godfather of former Klan Imperial Wizard Roger Kellyâ€™s granddaughter.

Davis has received the Elliott-Black and MLK awards as well as numerous other local and national awards for his work in race relations, and is often sought by media outlets as a consultant on the KKK and race relations. He is also an actor with stage and screen credits, appearing in the critically acclaimed HBO police drama, The Wire, and most recently, as the subject of the documentary Accidental Courtesy, which filmed his real life encounters with Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi leaders as he helps to dismantle racism across the United States
