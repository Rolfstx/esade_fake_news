â€œWeâ€™ve seen Biden appear confused about key facts, policies, dates and names, even forgetting Barack Obamaâ€™s name,â€<9d> Ms Panahi said.

â€œThere is simply too much footage of his muddled rants, inexplicably bizarre outbursts and Charlie Sheen levels of confusion to try and gaslight the American public.â€<9d>
