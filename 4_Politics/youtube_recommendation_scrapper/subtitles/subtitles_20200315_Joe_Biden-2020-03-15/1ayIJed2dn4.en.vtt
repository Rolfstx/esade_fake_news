I SAID, "WHAT DOES IT MEAN?"
HE SAID, "WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

IT MEANS YOU'RE INBRED."

00:07:38.323 --> 00:07:42.361 align:start position:0%

FIRST OF ALL, THAT'S VERY RUDE.

00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:53.506

WHAT I MEAN?

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.110 align:start position:0%

CRAZY, OKAY.

00:08:08.954 --> 00:08:11.290
BECAUSE I-- YOU KNOW, I LOOKED

00:08:11.323 --> 00:08:14.627 size:84% position:42%
REASON I'M 100% IRISH IS MY

AROUND THE TIME OF THE CIVIL
WAR.

00:08:16.094 --> 00:08:22.868
WE JUST ALL MOVED INTO A VERY
