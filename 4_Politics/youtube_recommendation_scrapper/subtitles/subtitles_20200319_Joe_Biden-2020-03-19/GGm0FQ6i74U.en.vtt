00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.560
Ezra Klein: Secretary Clinton, thank you for being
here.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.560
Hillary Rodham Clinton: Thank you, Ezra, glad to talk to you again.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.190
EK: So I wanted to start with a part of the
book that surprised me the most, which was

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.990
you almost ran on the beginning of a universal
basic income in America, which you were gonna

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.380
call Alaska for America.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.810
Tell me a bit about that idea and why it didn’t
make it into the final campaign.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.310
HRC: Well I wanted very much to convey a commitment
to trying to figure out ways to raise incomes.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.280
Most of the emphasis on the campaign was,
as you know, on jobs and some big projects

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.130
like, really, the infrastructure program that
I put forward.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.930
But I was also really interested in what else
we were gonna be needing to do.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.150
And so I looked at a couple of different approaches
to what’s called UBI, universal basic income.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.720
The experiments that had been tried elsewhere.

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:02.080
And the Alaska for America idea was really
intriguing to me because in effect it was

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:10.610
to argue that our natural patrimony really
does belong to every American — to try to

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:18.680
break mindset that the extraction of resources
is a totally private sector effort.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.870
That we, as Americans, have a stake in it
for all the reasons that you can understand.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.420
And the Alaska model where they write a check
to every single Alaskan every year based on

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.990
a formula about the oil and gas revenues was
really intriguing to me.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:44.050
And we dug deep, we tried to explain it to
some people, and it just was hard for people

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.350
to grasp what we were talking about because
most Americans in the Lower 48, as we like

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.540
to say, didn’t have any idea about what
was going on in Alaska.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.120
So I kept looking for an opportunity to put
it in but not to make it a centerpiece of

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.120
the campaign.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.810
EK: What would’ve going into a program like
that?

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.400
When you talk about our natural patrimony,
what would have been the inputs to that income?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.379
HRC: Well that was one of the challenges we
had — trying to figure out exactly, when

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:18.130
you look nationwide, are we talking about
fossil fuels, which then might perversely

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:26.480
encourage the continued extraction of fossil
fuels, which would be an outcome that we weren’t

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.410
necessarily thinking was in the best interest.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:37.610
Other kinds of natural patrimony — whether
it’s minerals or anything else that you

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:44.660
could look at and say, “Extracting that,
making private profit off of that, is really

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.830
part of America’s legacy.”

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.810
There were lots of really interesting questions.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.210
We debated it for a long time — the fossil
fuels, climate change issues was one of the

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.210
complications.

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.490
EK: So the reason I start with that is when
you talk about, in the book, you say at the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.709
end, “You know, maybe I should’ve proposed
that and left the details to be worked out

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:03.709
later.”

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.970
And it seems to me that this is one of the
pieces of the campaign that you’ve been

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:07.970
left reevaluating.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.650
You say that you now have more of an appreciation
for the power of big, galvanizing ideas.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.150
Do you think that one of the lessons of watching
Bernie Sanders, of watching Donald Trump,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.800
is that perhaps the correct role for policy
in a campaign is to inspire?

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.739
And that the place for technocratically sound,
more pragmatic policy is in the legislative

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:31.739
process?

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:40.900
HRC: Well, that certainly is a fair conclusion
to draw from the way I try to raise the question.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.050
If I could, Ezra, because you’re a policy
person and I love that about you, let me talk

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:50.550
about this a little bit more, because this
was a struggle from the very beginning.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.070
This wasn’t something that I only thought
about retroactively.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:04.480
I felt that I was in the following posture:
I was running to succeed a two-term president

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.480
from my own party who I happen to believe
did a really good job on some very difficult

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.190
issues.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.910
And whether it was saving the economy, saving
the auto industry, getting us on the path

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.639
to universal health coverage with the Affordable
Care Act, I knew how hard it was to actually

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.770
get to where we got.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.870
And I worried that if I were to say, “Well,
let’s go all the way, you know, with this

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.360
and we’ll leave the details ‘til later,”
the natural question is, “Well, why didn’t

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.339
that happen before?”

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:39.479
And I knew that would be my burden to bear,
because I would have the responsibility having

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.490
been in the administration to be able to answer
that question.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.199
Secondly, I don’t think I’m held to same
standard as anybody else.

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:57.259
I believed that if I were to say let’s do
a carbon tax, let’s do single-payer tomorrow,

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:03.979
let’s do whatever it is that might be viewed
as universal and inspiring, unlike either

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.150
my primary opponent or my general election
opponent, who were never pinned down — except

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:16.189
in one case in the primary with respect to
Sen. Sanders — I would’ve been hammered

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.189
all the time.

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:18.360
“Okay, how are you going to do that?

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.360
How are you going to pay for it?

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.360
Where’s the money going to come from?”

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.370
If I had said we are going to leave it to
the legislative process over here, they’ll

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.710
figure it out, people would’ve said, “Well,
you’ve been around, you know how it works.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:29.710
How are you going to do that?

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.469
You don’t have 60 votes.”

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:39.300
I think I would have been hit with a thousand
different legitimate questions, and I think

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.460
I would have felt an obligation to answer.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:48.500
So finally, you know, I do think policy matters,
and I think where I came out really made sense

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:53.960
for the country, made sense for the Democratic
candidate.

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:01.370
But it was hard to compete with, you know,
just the big claims and the assertions that

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.819
I got from both sides.

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.759
And maybe I could’ve been — in fact, I’m
sure I could’ve been — somewhat more adept

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.919
at trying to maneuver through that, so that
I got the benefit of saying here’s what

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:13.919
we are going to do.

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.230
I thought saying, “Look, we are gonna get
to universal coverage ’cause that’s my

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.039
goal — we’re at 90 percent now.

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:22.270
I think getting from 90 to 100 is a lot easier
than starting over” — I thought that made

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.449
sense to people.

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:30.270
I think in the end, a lot of people who were
going to vote for me believed that.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.009
But, you know, that’s what you do when you
take a retrospective, like what could I have

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:35.009
done differently?

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:37.520
EK: So as someone that would have been asking
those agenda questions —

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.330
HRC: You would’ve been pinning me down,
and it would have been quite hard!

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.999
EK: And here is my question on that, though:
Do you think that those questions matter because

00:06:47.999 --> 00:06:49.240
people would care about them?

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.300
Or because you would care about them?

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.939
Something that I have observed watching Trump
and other politicians in this era is that

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:01.360
a lot of what we thought can hurt a politician
is actually a relationship between them and

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.360
the press.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.319
It’s their own shame, their own sense that
they’ve been pinned down, their own desire

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:07.679
to actually respond to what they feel is a
fair critique.

00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:11.999
If you just don’t have that desire, if you
don’t care about that particular kind of

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:15.069
critique, it appears to lose at least some
of its power.

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.770
HRC: Ezra, you are 100 percent right.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:17.770
EK: Thank you.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.779
HRC: I feel like we are having a therapy session
in front of this camera.

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:25.889
You are 100 percent right, and I can’t change
who I am.

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:26.909
I knew that.

00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:33.389
I knew that I am not someone who will say
things that aren’t true, that will not take

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:34.389
responsibility.

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:35.659
I had to run as me.

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:39.110
I love when people say, “Oh, if only we
knew her more, or she were more authentic.”

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.559
I’ve been around a long time.

00:07:40.559 --> 00:07:41.559
I am what I am.

00:07:41.559 --> 00:07:49.099
I care about being absolutely as accurate
as possible so people know how to judge what

00:07:49.099 --> 00:07:50.689
I’m saying.

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:58.740
But I think this was not just a slight shift;
this was a ground-shaking shift.

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:03.669
Because I’m someone who’s observed presidential
elections a very long time, and I always saw

00:08:03.669 --> 00:08:09.129
there would be a moment, maybe one or two,
where in a debate or in a really important

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:13.089
interview the candidate was asked, “How
are you going to do that?

00:08:13.089 --> 00:08:14.590
Explain to me how that would work.”

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:17.180
That was certainly my experience in ’08.

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:20.379
I saw my husband go through it — in fact,
it probably saved his campaign.

00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:25.089
I saw, you know, President Obama go through
it and be able to say both in ’08 and ’12,

00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:28.419
look, here’s what we are going to do, and
I think this is realistic and we are going

00:08:28.419 --> 00:08:29.639
to get it done.

00:08:29.639 --> 00:08:31.139
But it’s going to make a difference.

00:08:31.139 --> 00:08:37.330
He went from the specific to the upstretched
hands of the aspirational promise.

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.920
Yet it had to be connected to something that
was real.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.710
And, you know, I’ve been around a long time.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:45.440
I know how hard this is.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:53.700
And I didn’t want to be either not telling
the truth about what was going to happen and

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:57.950
not being responsible about what I thought
we could do and get done together, which I

00:08:57.950 --> 00:08:59.600
thought could be a pretty big deal.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:09.830
But clearly in a reality TV campaign like
the one we were seeing in 2016, it was not

00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:10.830
the same at all.

00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.780
I never had those moments that I thought would
come.

00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:16.140
EK: So you talk about you are what you are.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.320
HRC: I am what I am.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.510
EK: You are what you are.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:23.430
And one of the things that was interesting
to me in the book was actually how you frame

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:26.330
your own history in political organizing.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:32.430
So I’ve read your speech from Wellesley,
and it had always sounded like the words of

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:34.220
a radical to me.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:37.500
But when you explain about how you thought
about running for student body president,

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.130
you said that “I ran for student government
president in 1968 because I thought I could

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:47.050
do a good job convincing college administrators
to make changes students wanted.”

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.800
You talk about your work with the Children’s
Defense Fund and focus on field work and making

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.060
reports.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:10:00.560
This is all in a period when a lot of people
around you were interested in upending systems.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:06.560
How did you become more of a pragmatist who
wanted to work within the systems in a radical

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.560
era?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.250
HRC: Well, there are always people who want
to upend system.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:21.240
And I respect the desire for being part of
big change; I think that’s important particularly

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.870
when younger when you want to see that happen.

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:35.100
But I also became convinced early on that
in my understanding of change, it was rare

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:40.200
that in America you got those huge moments
of opportunity.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.990
We saw it with President Johnson, with voting
rights, civil rights, Medicare, Medicaid,

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:52.350
with enormous Democratic majorities in the
House and the Senate, so a governing party

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:58.670
could actually implement what it chose to
pursue.

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:04.450
But that’s not that common in American political
history.

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:10.950
And as I watched what the hard, slow boring
of hard boards that Weber talks about meant

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:17.120
in our country — it was really digging in,
getting to know what you’re talking about,

00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.370
making the case.

00:11:18.370 --> 00:11:24.410
And sometimes you still ran into an immovable
political obstacle, but then you regrouped

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:29.010
and you went on again, which is what I did
with health care in the 1990s when we ended

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:31.270
up with the Children’s Health Insurance
Program.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:38.470
So I’m really interested in change, I’m
really interested in the principles and the

00:11:38.470 --> 00:11:45.220
values that I believe America stands for,
but I also know what it takes to get where

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.500
we need to go politically.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:53.160
And that’s what I decided was the most effective
way to achieve what I was looking for.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.160
EK: This feels to me like the argument that
has been at the center of both your ’08

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.500
and ’16 candidacies and that you have had
trouble making.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:05.890
In both of those elections — in the primary
of ’08 and then both in the primary and

00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.540
the general of this year, last year — you
ran against people who in some way or another

00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.570
were saying they were going to upend whole
system.

00:12:12.570 --> 00:12:16.200
They were going to bring hope and change,
they were going to bring a political revolution,

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.630
they were going to drain the swamp, whatever
it might have been.

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:24.120
In those cases you’ve always taken the stance
that you actually need to understand the system,

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.490
you need to work within it, the angels are
not going to come down with their violins.

00:12:29.490 --> 00:12:36.320
And that has been I think simultaneously a
realistic and very hard-to-sell message.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.570
I had a piece that I had written for if you
had won, and it was called “Hillary Clinton’s

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:45.010
Political Realism,” and it was about the
ways in which your vision of success was much

00:12:45.010 --> 00:12:50.170
less about upending America’s political
system and much more about the change you

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.690
can bring within it.

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:56.290
Why is that such a hard message to sell to
the American people?

00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.390
HRC: I don’t think it used to be quite as
hard.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:06.290
I think it could be made harder because of
the environment in which we find ourselves

00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:13.470
right now — but you see, I think I’m also
very realistic about the forces arrayed against

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:15.220
the kind of change I want to see.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:22.410
There’s a big move for change coming from
the right that I think would be disastrous

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.900
for our country.

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:29.800
They want radical, pull-em-up-by-the-roots
change, they want to have a constitutional

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:36.240
convention to rewrite our Constitution to
make it friendlier to business, to inject

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.020
religious and ideological elements.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:44.380
So talk about radical change — they are
pursuing it, they are funding it, and they

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:50.910
are electing people who are either true believers
or willing vehicles for it.

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.590
So what do we do on the other side?

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:58.150
Because we don’t control media the same
way the right does; it’s harder for our

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.720
message to get out.

00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:06.980
So it’s okay to say all right, let’s really
work for change, but you’re going to have

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:15.800
to build an edifice under that that has the
kind of hard-fought political realities that

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.610
are going to be necessary to stand against
the right.

00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:26.070
I thought and obviously came close — won
the popular vote and all of that — but I

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:32.840
thought at end of day, people would say, look,
we do want change, and we want the right kind

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:38.880
of change, and we want change that is realistic
and is going to make difference in my life

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.800
and my family’s life and my paycheck.

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.170
That’s what I was offering.

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:52.370
And I didn’t in any way want to feed into
this not just radical political argument that

00:14:52.370 --> 00:15:02.940
was being made on other side but a very negative
cultural argument about who we are as Americans.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:09.670
So there was so much happening in this campaign
and a lot of it for the first time — some

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:16.420
of it as a result of long trends — that
I was running just trying to figure out, okay,

00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:19.320
people are really that anti-immigrant?

00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:27.230
Are they really, or is that just a convenient
excuse to rally a base?

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:28.670
How far does that really go?

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:34.279
It was a tough terrain that we were moving
through and trying to understand.

00:15:34.279 --> 00:15:37.350
EK: This is something I think about in my
own writing.

00:15:37.350 --> 00:15:44.210
Is it possible to be too realistic about the
forces arrayed against change, about the institutional

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:47.970
constraints against change in the American
political system — so realistic that you

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:52.970
miss openings, so realistic that it’s hard
to inspire people?

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.930
And as such, it actually begins driving the
outcomes themselves.

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.500
I feel like this is the critique of this kind
of politics.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.010
HRC: I think it’s a fair critique.

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:07.980
I understand that critique.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:13.340
But I don’t think the press did their job
in this election, with very few exceptions.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:20.070
So the hard questions about what was real,
what was realistic, and what could happen

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:25.170
with the right kind of election outcome were
never really joined.

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:32.770
And so I found it frustrating obviously because
I think I could’ve defended and lifted up

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:36.120
a lot of what I believed we could do.

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:43.500
But really, Ezra, when you get 32 minutes
in a whole year to cover all policy, how does

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.000
that work?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.020
Compare it even with ’08, when you had 200
minutes on broadcast TV — you think, well,

00:16:53.020 --> 00:17:01.460
is it that people are really not interested,
or is it that it’s just not as enticing

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:07.000
to the press because the other guy’s running
a reality TV show, which is hard to turn away

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.510
from.

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:13.699
And whatever we says we think is kind of goofy,
but hey, it’s good TV, and she’s over

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:17.730
there saying here’s how we’re going to
raise taxes on wealthy and here’s what we’re

00:17:17.730 --> 00:17:22.030
going to do to close loopholes and here’s
where I think I can do it, and you know what,

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.619
she’s going to win anyway.

00:17:23.619 --> 00:17:26.149
So let’s cover other guy ’cause he’s
a lot more fun.

00:17:26.149 --> 00:17:33.730
And I think, in addition to everything you
say, which is fair and needs to be considered,

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:37.559
it was such a difficult environment even to
have that conversation, so who could tell

00:17:37.559 --> 00:17:39.629
what was or was not realistic?

00:17:39.629 --> 00:17:44.529
It was kind of all bets were off in the coverage
of the campaign.

00:17:44.529 --> 00:17:47.840
EK: So Democrats are going to face a question
like this as we speak.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.779
So right now in Washington, we’re interviewing
Sanders — another one of my reporters is

00:17:51.779 --> 00:17:56.100
— who is proposing his single-payer bill
this week.

00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:01.879
And a lot of Senate Democrats are expected
to sign on to the bill.

00:18:01.879 --> 00:18:07.659
This bill would be quite sweeping; it would
upend every insurance arrangement, every private

00:18:07.659 --> 00:18:09.740
insurance arrangement, in America.

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:15.789
Do you think that the Democratic party should
sign on, even aspirationally, to a bill that

00:18:15.789 --> 00:18:18.559
is that radical in its vision?

00:18:18.559 --> 00:18:20.559
HRC: Well, I don’t know what the particulars
are.

00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:25.059
As you might remember, during the campaign
he introduced a single-payer bill every year

00:18:25.059 --> 00:18:30.730
he was in Congress — and when somebody finally
read it, he couldn’t explain it and couldn’t

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.749
really tell people how much it was gonna cost.

00:18:34.749 --> 00:18:39.750
So I haven’t seen whatever it is they’re
gonna be introducing and signing on to, so

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:41.289
I don’t know.

00:18:41.289 --> 00:18:49.379
I’m for universal health care coverage that
is high-quality and affordable for every American.

00:18:49.379 --> 00:18:55.299
And I think there’s a lot of ways of getting
there that I’ve advocated for, to open up

00:18:55.299 --> 00:19:01.059
Medicare, to open up Medicaid, to do more
on prescription drug costs, to really make

00:19:01.059 --> 00:19:09.090
sure we get costs down and we do everything
we can to sort of break the stranglehold that

00:19:09.090 --> 00:19:15.690
a lot of the pharmaceutical companies, which
are unfortunately still driving prices, have

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.769
on health care costs.

00:19:17.769 --> 00:19:25.779
And I think it’s going to be challenging
if within that bill, there are tax increases

00:19:25.779 --> 00:19:31.389
equivalent to what it would take to pay for
single-payer, and if you’re really telling

00:19:31.389 --> 00:19:38.029
people — about half of the country — that
they can no longer have the policies they

00:19:38.029 --> 00:19:39.200
have through employer.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.629
I’ve been down this road!

00:19:40.629 --> 00:19:43.769
This is not the first time we’ve tried to
confront this.

00:19:43.769 --> 00:19:50.080
When I was working on health care back in
in ’93 and ’94, if we could’ve waved

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.440
the magic wand and started all over, I said
it numerous times, maybe we would start with

00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:02.620
something resembling single-payer plus other
payers, like other countries that have universal

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:10.529
coverage and are much better at controlling
costs than we do, primarily in Europe.

00:20:10.529 --> 00:20:18.590
But we were facing the reality — talk about
reality — of not just strong, powerful forces

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:29.010
but people’s own fears as well as their
appreciation for what they already had.

00:20:29.010 --> 00:20:36.440
So when the bill is actually introduced, I’ll
read it, I’ll look at it, but if it doesn’t

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:44.360
have some kind of grandfathering in, if it
doesn’t have some kind of cost estimate

00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:46.179
— because look at what happened in Vermont.

00:20:46.179 --> 00:20:48.769
It wasn’t for lack of trying in Vermont.

00:20:48.769 --> 00:20:54.789
The Democratic political establishment was
behind single-payer, and they worked for years

00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:55.789
to achieve it.

00:20:55.789 --> 00:21:02.080
This is in, you know, a small state, where
it might’ve been possible.

00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:07.039
They were talking about an increase in the
payroll tax of 9.5 percent, or I think, no,

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:12.039
maybe 11.5 percent, they were talking about
a sliding income scale, they went up to 9.5

00:21:12.039 --> 00:21:16.720
percent — it just was so difficult to put
pieces together.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:24.690
Now, clearly if you had a national plan, that
would be more likely to avoid state-by-state

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:30.049
comparisons, but I think it’s gonna be a
big challenge.

00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:34.570
Our goal should be universal health care coverage
— universal, affordable, quality health

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.940
care coverage for everybody, bar none.

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.710
EK: Let me ask you about the other side, about
Obamacare — which seems, for the moment,

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:47.269
to have withstood the attacks on it — but
that was a policy that was really built with

00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:48.269
an eye toward realism.

00:21:48.269 --> 00:21:52.370
An eye toward what could pass, but also an
eye toward how could you overlay something

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:57.179
on the existing system that wouldn’t disrupt
too many of the existing arrangements.

00:21:57.179 --> 00:22:02.590
And those pieces of the plan — the exchanges,
the private insurers — have been the most

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:07.630
substantively difficult to implement and to
defend, and then also the most politically

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:08.630
difficult.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:11.870
It’s left the administration, first Obama
and now Trump, at the mercy of private insurers

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:16.049
deciding whether or not to sell, with premium
increases they can’t defend, and what has

00:22:16.049 --> 00:22:20.940
really ended up being popular in that and
defensible in that is the Medicaid expansion.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:28.169
Is that a place where Democrats overread what
realism required and ended up in a position

00:22:28.169 --> 00:22:34.799
where what they had wasn’t that inspiring
and wasn’t, in the end, that easy to either

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:38.040
implement or sustain?

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:44.980
I think you have to unpack what you just asked,
because even embedded in it was your reference

00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:47.710
to Medicaid.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.410
It was really unfortunate that because of
the drafting of the bill, it gave the Supreme

00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:58.360
Court the opening to eliminate the Medicaid
requirement, the expansion requirement.

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:04.929
But what has happened is that Medicaid has
become very popular even in Republican states

00:23:04.929 --> 00:23:11.019
because it does save money and it is a universal
program below a certain income level, and

00:23:11.019 --> 00:23:16.590
it takes care of middle-income people when
it comes to nursing homes and disabilities

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:17.700
and all the rest.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:26.100
So I think we should be focused politically,
realistically, and aspirationally on expanding,

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:31.370
continuing the expansion of Medicaid, and
going to those states that have not yet expanded

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:32.370
it.

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:36.820
And making the political case every day for
as long as it takes.

00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:44.580
I was in favor of a Medicare buy-in; if you
start slowly moving the age down, it would

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:46.360
make a very big difference.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:51.509
People’s health begins to have more problems
after 55, so let’s get Medicaid down to

00:23:51.509 --> 00:23:53.019
60 and then maybe down to 55.

00:23:53.019 --> 00:23:58.630
I am in favor of a public option, and the
Democrats thought they were going to get a

00:23:58.630 --> 00:24:05.009
public option and at the very end didn’t
have votes for reasons that I think were inexcusable

00:24:05.009 --> 00:24:06.009
at the time.

00:24:06.009 --> 00:24:08.340
But that was just the fact.

00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:09.919
You know, you gotta pass it.

00:24:09.919 --> 00:24:11.609
So is that realism or aspiration?

00:24:11.609 --> 00:24:14.629
Well, at the end of the day it’s votes.

00:24:14.629 --> 00:24:16.789
And it didn’t pass.

00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:25.549
So there are pieces that became less popular
partly because of a really well-funded, nonstop

00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:27.320
campaign against it.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.929
But then all of a sudden, with all this talk
about repeal and replace — which was just

00:24:31.929 --> 00:24:36.049
nonsense; they never had a plan to replace,
it was just a political talking point, and

00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:41.529
I don’t think Democrats did a good enough
job defending it against those attacks — so

00:24:41.529 --> 00:24:47.989
when it came time to take something away that
people had gotten used to, everybody said

00:24:47.989 --> 00:24:48.989
no.

00:24:48.989 --> 00:24:52.039
And that’s my larger point about what our
goal really is.

00:24:52.039 --> 00:24:57.580
You’re going to tell 50 percent of America,
“You are no longer to have your employer-based

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:01.789
health care, but oh, trust us, it’s going
to be really good when we finally work out

00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:05.519
all the kinks” -- you’re going to have
massive resistance by people, who are gonna

00:25:05.519 --> 00:25:07.750
say, “I’m happy with what I’ve got.”

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:11.790
But if you say, “You know what, we need
to lower age for Medicare, and here’s how

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:17.299
we can do that, and we need to continue the
expansion of Medicaid,” we will be at universal

00:25:17.299 --> 00:25:18.690
coverage.

00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:23.559
Then once we’re at universal coverage, and
people know what that feels like, then can

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:27.730
begin to say, “Okay, here’s what we’re
going to do to make it work better, to get

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:28.730
the costs down.”

00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.529
I think that’s — you know, I think that’s
not just realistic, I think it’s thrilling.

00:25:32.529 --> 00:25:37.509
You know, as somebody who was one of the main
advocates for the Children’s Health Insurance

00:25:37.509 --> 00:25:41.360
Program, I see the difference it’s made
in people’s lives.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:45.759
And all through the campaign, people would
come up to me and say, “I was on that program,”

00:25:45.759 --> 00:25:49.269
or, “My family wouldn’t have been able
to afford my sister’s care if it hadn’t

00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:53.039
been for that” — I find that exhilarating
because that, to me, is what public service

00:25:53.039 --> 00:25:54.840
is supposed to be about.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.470
The Children’s Health Insurance Program
is set to expire at end of this month — what

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:03.559
are the forces going to be that will say no,
you’re not going to take this away from

00:26:03.559 --> 00:26:07.230
8, 9 million kids, where are they gonna go?

00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:14.269
So what I think is really motivating about
being in politics in public service is you

00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:19.549
can actually see the positive changes, whether
it’s civil rights or economics or health

00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:24.690
care or whatever it might be — and I think
at the end of the day, that’s more important

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:28.249
than, you know, how realistic was it or aspirational
was it.

00:26:28.249 --> 00:26:34.610
EK: So one of the pieces of the book that
really outlined, I think, the disagreement

00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:38.090
between you and some of the public is right
around here.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.769
So we’re talking here about the practice
of politics, what is realistic, what isn’t,

00:26:41.769 --> 00:26:47.610
but there’s a real feeling among a lot of
folks that the long-term practice of mainstream

00:26:47.610 --> 00:26:50.519
politics is itself a corrupting exercise.

00:26:50.519 --> 00:26:55.619
And I think back to 2008, I was at [something]
when you were there for a debate with the

00:26:55.619 --> 00:26:59.789
other Democratic candidates, and there was
this really interesting exchange about lobbyists.

00:26:59.789 --> 00:27:03.940
And you defended them as part of the political
system: They have a role to play.

00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:07.200
The represent people you don’t like but
also people you do like.

00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:11.269
There’s a version of that in your defense
of the speeches, in which you sort of say,

00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:15.559
looked bad, shouldn’t have done it, but
you see it as somewhat ridiculous — the

00:27:15.559 --> 00:27:20.100
idea that Goldman Sachs paying you could have
changed what you think.

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:24.609
This to me feels like an actually pretty central
fault line in our politics now, the feeling

00:27:24.609 --> 00:27:28.909
that a lot of the public has that if you’ve
been in politics a long time, in mainstream

00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:34.649
politics, that you’ve probably gone a little
bit bad from it.

00:27:34.649 --> 00:27:39.450
And Barack Obama coming in as an outsider
in 08, Donald Trump as an outsider, Bernie

00:27:39.450 --> 00:27:43.419
Sanders, who had held back from a lot of the
political system during his career in Washington

00:27:43.419 --> 00:27:46.659
— that seemed to be a place where there
was a lot of friction.

00:27:46.659 --> 00:27:50.149
How do you think about politics versus this
anti-politics sentiment?

00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:55.239
HRC: Look, anti-politics is part of the American
DNA — it goes back to the very beginning.

00:27:55.239 --> 00:28:04.820
I have no doubt that it’s just built into
America’s skepticism and disdain for the

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:05.820
people in politics.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:10.919
So that’s just part of the background of
being in politics.

00:28:10.919 --> 00:28:18.019
But I think it’s important to again try
to recognize what’s real and what’s not.

00:28:18.019 --> 00:28:21.380
You know, I can’t help it; I’m like the
Velveteen Rabbit.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.010
I believe in reality.

00:28:23.010 --> 00:28:25.019
I like living in a reality-based world.

00:28:25.019 --> 00:28:31.279
I don’t like alternative facts, I don’t
like the very concerted, well-funded effort

00:28:31.279 --> 00:28:33.169
to try to distort news.

00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:34.169
I don’t like any of that.

00:28:34.169 --> 00:28:42.559
I think a democracy like ours depends upon
trying to have a vigorous, fact-based debate.

00:28:42.559 --> 00:28:47.279
So: Nobody on the Republican side cares about
any of these issues, Ezra; you know that.

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:52.399
I voted for McCain-Feingold; I said in my
campaign one of the first things I would do

00:28:52.399 --> 00:28:58.509
is introduce a constitutional amendment to
repeal Citizens United.

00:28:58.509 --> 00:29:07.390
So I take a back seat to nobody in standing
up for sensible, hard-hitting campaign finance

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:08.390
rules.

00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:10.029
But everybody’s got politics.

00:29:10.029 --> 00:29:15.230
You know, I go after Bernie really hard on
the NRA — that’s politics for him.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:19.429
And the idea that he’s set off from politics
— he’s been in politics his whole adult

00:29:19.429 --> 00:29:20.429
life.

00:29:20.429 --> 00:29:26.419
Donald Trump wasn’t in politics, but he
was somebody who funded people on both sides

00:29:26.419 --> 00:29:28.559
to in order to curry favors.

00:29:28.559 --> 00:29:34.710
Until we get to public financing, which I
wholeheartedly endorse, and we have this crazy

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:38.220
system where you have to go out and raise
the money — we don’t have a party structure

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:44.350
that funds campaigns, we don’t have public
financing — then if Democrats unilaterally

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:48.940
disarm and say, “You know, we’re holier
than Caesar’s wife, and we won’t say or

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:54.649
do anything that might raise a question”
— there is no compunction on the other side.

00:29:54.649 --> 00:29:59.320
And there is such an imbalance right now in
our politics, in the amount of money that’s

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.320
on the other side — the Koch brothers say
they’re gonna spend $400 million in the

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:11.549
2018 campaign — so yeah, I think, you know,
people have to be willing to say, okay, I

00:30:11.549 --> 00:30:16.640
understand how this might look, it’s not
really how I felt or how I acted, but okay,

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:20.499
I understand that, so let’s agree on that.

00:30:20.499 --> 00:30:28.529
But at the end of day, it is very much an
unbalanced political environment right now

00:30:28.529 --> 00:30:37.090
between the resources that are behind Republicans
and their campaigns — because it’s not

00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:43.450
just a straight line between who gave you
money, it’s all the rest of the operation

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.639
— and what stands behind Democrats.

00:30:45.639 --> 00:30:50.399
And you know if we don’t care about that,
then fine, but I don’t think that’s gonna

00:30:50.399 --> 00:30:51.590
come out very well for us.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:55.769
EK: But in terms of demonstrating that kind
of purity, isn’t there a dimension here

00:30:55.769 --> 00:31:02.620
where Republicans who do not have a very high
opinion of the government do not mind particularly

00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.850
the feeling that the government is corrupt,
that it does not work on their behalf, that

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:10.440
it might even work on behalf of special interests
— that that is not actually a threat to

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.019
their particular version of politics?

00:31:12.019 --> 00:31:15.340
Whereas for Democrats, who do want people
to trust the government, who do want people

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.759
to have faith in public institutions, there
is a higher bar.

00:31:19.759 --> 00:31:23.710
HRC: Yeah, and I think Democrats by and large
try to reach it.

00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:27.489
I mean, Barack Obama took more money from
Wall Street in 08 than any other Democrat

00:31:27.489 --> 00:31:32.129
has ever taken, and turned around and imposed
the toughest regulations under Dodd-Frank

00:31:32.129 --> 00:31:34.659
since the Great Depression.

00:31:34.659 --> 00:31:39.809
I tell people that all the time — if you
give me money, you will know, because I will

00:31:39.809 --> 00:31:43.470
tell you publicly and privately what I’m
for.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:46.730
So if you’re in a high income tax bracket,
I wanna tax you.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:51.309
If you still want to give me money, you are
going in with your eyes open.

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:57.109
I think it’s theoretically an interesting
conversation, but you look at somebody like

00:31:57.109 --> 00:32:04.139
President Obama, who inherited this disastrous
economy and, you know, I think did an incredible

00:32:04.139 --> 00:32:10.110
job pulling it back out of the abyss — took
a lot of money from a lot of different interests,

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.919
but it didn’t affect how he governed.

00:32:12.919 --> 00:32:16.599
And so let’s get to the second level here.

00:32:16.599 --> 00:32:20.269
EK: I do think that’s strong, though, that
it didn’t affect how he governed.

00:32:20.269 --> 00:32:21.269
HRC: Right.

00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:25.440
EK: I think a lot of President Obama’s policies
were pretty sound, but also a lot of people

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:30.149
feel he could’ve done more to punish bankers,
that he could’ve gone further on health

00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:33.889
care, there were deals cut before the fact
with the pharmaceutical industry, with the

00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:35.460
insurance industry.

00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:40.099
And there are other political realism considerations
in all these questions, but one thing here

00:32:40.099 --> 00:32:44.009
is that it’s true, I think, directionally
what you’re saying, that a lot of these

00:32:44.009 --> 00:32:46.359
cut against the interests who funded him.

00:32:46.359 --> 00:32:50.090
But what a lot of people feel and what I think
there is evidence for is that these kinds

00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:53.799
of donations, etc., they do give people more
of a voice, they do give these interests more

00:32:53.799 --> 00:32:57.919
of a voice, and that does affect things certainly
on the margins, certainly in the details.

00:32:57.919 --> 00:33:00.950
HRC: Well, but, you know, it’s always been
thus.

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:06.039
I mean, if you’ve seen the musical Hamilton,
you know, if you’re running a raucous —

00:33:06.039 --> 00:33:07.519
EK: — I actually haven’t gotten tickets
to that.

00:33:07.519 --> 00:33:09.450
HRC: — well, we’ll see if we can help
you on that.

00:33:09.450 --> 00:33:16.440
If you’re running a raucous, pluralistic,
diverse democracy where there are literally

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:22.129
millions of different voices, you are going
to hear from all kind of voices.

00:33:22.129 --> 00:33:26.760
I was a senator for eight years -- I bet the
vast majority of people who came through the

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:31.960
doors of my Senate office to talk to me, to
advocate, whatever they were doing, were not

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:35.200
political donors or certainly not political
donors to me.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:40.929
They were constituents, they were citizens,
they had something to say.

00:33:40.929 --> 00:33:47.549
So part of what -- we’ve shrunk the political
process to such a narrow set of questions,

00:33:47.549 --> 00:33:50.960
and that’s in the interests of both the
far right and the far left, both of whom want

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:56.059
to blow up system and undermine it and all
the rest of the stuff they talk about.

00:33:56.059 --> 00:34:00.690
I think we operate better when we’re kind
of between center right and center left, because

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:06.509
that’s where at least up until recently,
maybe it’s changed now -- until recently,

00:34:06.509 --> 00:34:08.599
that’s where most American were.

00:34:08.599 --> 00:34:13.780
Look, they didn’t get up every day obsessed
with what the government and politics was

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.710
going to do -- they wanted to know what were
the results and is it going to make a difference

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:17.710
to my life.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:25.560
And I thought we had a pretty good balance,
but I again will argue that this has gone

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:26.560
on for decades.

00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:36.980
The right has been on a mission to disrupt
and overturn the political system to the benefit

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:41.810
of their commercial, ideological, and partisan
interests.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.760
I don’t see how you can argue with that.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:48.360
And it has been pretty effective, all said.

00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:56.530
Their gerrymandering, their suppression of
votes — they have a clear agenda, and it’s

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:03.120
fascinating that Trump wasn’t really particularly
interested in any of this but he was, it turned

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:06.720
out to be, a great vehicle for them to promote
these interests.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:11.690
So we’re watching the internal debate within
their party play out.

00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:15.300
On our side, you know, I just disagree.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.360
I was in that Senate for eight years, I know
how hard it is to get to 60 votes.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:23.341
Now, you can say we shouldn’t have to get
to 60 votes, but the fact is whether you’re

00:35:23.341 --> 00:35:27.690
in the majority of in the minority, and I’ve
been in both, that has been the rule: Get

00:35:27.690 --> 00:35:29.130
to 60 votes.

00:35:29.130 --> 00:35:35.320
Because that then demonstrates at least a
broader cross section of representative Americans

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.210
being in favor of something.

00:35:37.210 --> 00:35:43.060
So when you talk about bankers, if you look
at the laws we had at the time, maybe more

00:35:43.060 --> 00:35:47.900
could’ve been done, but I’ve heard very
credible, very tough people say not really

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:50.640
because of the burden of proof and the evidence.

00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:55.360
I’m not defending it; I’m just saying
it’s not for lack of trying that a lot of

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.980
things were not undertaken.

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:03.880
There were barriers to trying that had to
be knocked down and changed.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:04.930
And the same with Dodd-Frank.

00:36:04.930 --> 00:36:10.050
I mean, if Dodd-Frank had been in effect before
the crash, more could have been done, but

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:11.050
it wasn’t.

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:12.050
It had to come after.

00:36:12.050 --> 00:36:16.150
EK: So I want to talk and move us a little
bit to the 2016 election and what happened.

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:17.150
HRC: What Happened.

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.150
EK: The subject of the book.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.150
HRC: My book, yes.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:23.193
EK: There’s a premise that is not really
articulated one way or the other in the book,

00:36:23.193 --> 00:36:25.860
and I wanted to see where you fell on it.

00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:31.960
Was Donald Trump more or less a normal Republican
candidate who 1) should have expected to begin

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.000
with 40-42 percent of the vote?

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.340
And so you’re just explaining how did a
Republican candidate win the election?

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:43.980
Or is Donald Trump an abnormal candidate who
you should have expected to begin with 30-35

00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:48.660
percent of the vote, and so you have to have
this very large, explanatory lead as to how

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.490
he came close enough to actually win?

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:52.090
What are you explaining?

00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:57.650
HRC: I think given the hyperpartisanship in
the country right now, once he became the

00:36:57.650 --> 00:37:05.460
Republican nominee, the odds were very high
that Republicans would come home to him as

00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.880
their nominee.

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:12.610
Because regardless of what he said or how
he behaved or what came out about him, he

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:17.920
was their path to tax cuts, he was their path
to a Supreme Court seat.

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:24.120
There is an agenda on the other side that
really does motivate the right.

00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.550
So at the end of the day, I think something
like 90 percent of Republicans voted for him

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.000
and 90 percent of Democrats voted for me.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.990
That’s unfortunate in lots of ways — I
wish we weren’t in such a hyperpartisan

00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:39.090
political era — but that’s what I always
expected.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.980
I always thought the election would be close.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:46.350
I never was one of those people who said,
oh, my gosh, he’s so unacceptable and this,

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:47.350
that.

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:48.910
I always thought it would be close.

00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:55.640
I didn’t expect to be totally ambushed at
the end, which is what I believe, and obviously

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:01.060
have written about it, cost me the election
— but I always thought it would be close.

00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:08.490
It’s not like there was going to be some
wholehearted rejection of Trump by Republicans

00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:12.390
who frankly thought they could handle him.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.300
They thought, you know what, it’ll be an
entertaining four years, and you know, Mike

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:17.840
Pence and Mitch McConnell will take care of
everything for us.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:22.751
I mean, that was the thinking that I believe
went into a lot of the Republicans’ — some

00:38:22.751 --> 00:38:26.650
of whom sort of took a deep breath before
they did it — but they didn’t take him

00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:29.740
seriously, they didn’t take a potential
presidency seriously.

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:34.180
They thought getting a Republican in there,
that’s going to deliver for these things

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.180
that I care about.

00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:37.280
EK: But that’s a kind of remarkable view
of politics.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:41.620
It’s actually one that I share, but it’s
still a remarkable one, to imagine that we

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:47.080
are now in a time, for reasons related to
polarization and other things we talked about,

00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:52.840
that anybody — anybody — who wins a party
primary, and parties no longer have control

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:58.120
over their primaries — anybody who wins
a party primary begins within spitting distance

00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.310
of winning the presidential election.

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:00.510
HRC: I believe that.

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:04.980
EK: Does that mean we’re more vulnerable
to demagogues, to authoritarians, to dangerous

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:07.840
candidates than we were in the past?

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.330
HRC: Yes, we are, Ezra.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:13.610
I mean, if I’d lost to what I guess we could
call a normal Republican — one of the other

00:39:13.610 --> 00:39:16.280
16 people on the stage during their primary
—

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.550
EK: Jim Gilmore.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.750
HRC: Well, somebody that might have been able
to win.

00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:26.040
Look, I would have been disappointed, I would
have been upset and heartbroken, but — first

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:30.890
of all, I don’t think it would’ve happened,
but secondly, if it had happened, I wouldn’t

00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:33.610
feel such a sense of anxiety about the country.

00:39:33.610 --> 00:39:34.650
EK: I’m sorry, can I stop you there?

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:35.650
HRC: Yeah.

00:39:35.650 --> 00:39:36.760
EK: That was interesting, what you just said.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:40.330
Do you think that Donald Trump was a stronger
candidate than the other Republicans?

00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:41.330
HRC: Yes.

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:42.330
EK: You would have beat the others, but you
didn’t beat him?

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:46.320
HRC: Well, I don’t want to speculate like
that, but I think the fact he emerged, and

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:54.060
the way he emerged, which was so unlike anybody
ever getting a nomination in recent times,

00:39:54.060 --> 00:40:01.370
demonstrated the strength he had, which was
really rooted in a very cynical assessment

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:06.870
of how he could build a Republican majority.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:13.500
He started on the very first day saying terrible
things about Mexican immigrants — you know,

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:21.750
that they’re rapists and criminals — and
all of a sudden, people in the Republican

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:25.510
side of the electorate began to say, “Oh,
somebody’s speaking to me.”

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:27.730
And then he went on from there.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:35.600
And all of his dog whistles and all of his
appeals began to coalesce in the primary,

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:42.470
and then once he won the nomination, he had
some additional advantages like Russian help

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:50.030
and sophisticated data analytics operation,
weaponizing information, all of that.

00:40:50.030 --> 00:40:54.550
But his core base — and he was right when
he said, “I could shoot somebody in the

00:40:54.550 --> 00:40:59.760
middle of Fifth Avenue and my supporters won’t
leave me” — because he was, in a visceral

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.810
way, feeding into their prejudice and paranoia.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:03.850
EK: So then that’s an argument — because
I want to make sure I try to understand you

00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:07.680
here — that’s an argument that Donald
Trump was stronger than other Republican candidates

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.730
because he was willing to play white resentment
politics in a way that others weren’t.

00:41:11.730 --> 00:41:13.090
Is that a fair reading of what you just said?

00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:14.560
HRC: I think that’s part of his appeal,
yes.

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:23.100
And he was willing to play, let’s not forget,
Islamophobic politics, homophobic politics,

00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:31.790
sexist politics — I mean, hit hit every
single area of resentment and grievance that

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:33.510
people were feeling.

00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:42.370
And his racism, which was endemic to his campaign,
wasn’t subtle at all.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:50.020
And there’s now been so much analysis done
since the election demonstrating clearly that

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:57.450
so-called cultural/racial anxiety and prejudice
was the primary driver for a lot of his support.

00:41:57.450 --> 00:42:02.640
EK: But one way of reading the election results
is that Donald Trump, through these appeals,

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:07.030
was able to get white voters to act as an
interest group, to coalesce them in a way

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:10.640
they had not recently been coalesced, to motivate
them, particularly downscale whites, in a

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.730
way they had not recently been motivated.

00:42:12.730 --> 00:42:15.200
That didn’t happen as much with women voters.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:19.910
You talked about watching the Women’s Marches
after the election — where was this solidarity

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:20.910
during the campaign?

00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:22.960
Where was this outrage during the campaign?

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:28.700
Why do you think that politics worked for
Trump but you didn’t see a corresponding

00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:32.040
surge, particularly among female voters?

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:35.500
HRC: Well, let’s start with this fact, though:
I did carry the women’s vote.

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.790
EK: You did carry the women’s vote.

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:37.790
HRC: Right.

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.480
I lost the white women’s vote, but I actually
got more white women votes than Barack Obama

00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.480
got.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.370
So this was part of a trend.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:45.540
EK; In 2008?

00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:48.230
HRC: I can’t remember if it was ’08 or
’12.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.230
Yeah.

00:42:49.230 --> 00:42:52.800
And so white voters have been fleeing the
Democratic Party ever since Lyndon Johnson

00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.900
predicted they would.

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.100
There is no surprise to that.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:05.480
Of course I hoped I could get more than a
traditional Democratic nominee did because

00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:10.850
I was the first woman with the chance to be
president — but gender is not the motivating

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:15.250
factor that race was for President Obama.

00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:19.900
And so many women — and let’s talk about
white women, because that’s the group of

00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:32.840
women that I lost — are really quite politically
dependent on their view of their own security

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:36.550
and their own position in society, what works
and doesn’t work for them.

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:41.340
So as I say in the book, I had this really
revealing conversation with Sheryl Sandberg

00:43:41.340 --> 00:43:42.830
before the campaign.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:47.710
And she’s immersed herself in every bit
of research about how do women think and what

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:49.260
do they expect.

00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:54.750
And she said look — and we’re talking
predominantly about white women — okay,

00:43:54.750 --> 00:44:00.120
she said the research is really clear: The
more professionally successful a man becomes,

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.540
the more likable he becomes.

00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:06.580
The more professionally successful a woman
becomes, the less likable she becomes.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:12.630
When a woman is advocating on behalf of others,
or working for someone and working hard for

00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:18.190
that person, the way I did as secretary of
state when I was so popular in the public

00:44:18.190 --> 00:44:23.530
opinion polls, that is favorably received
by people.

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:28.910
But when a woman advocates for herself — so
if I go and say to Vox, I think Ezra deserves

00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:32.370
a raise, people say, Boy is she a good person.

00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:34.790
I mean, she’s out there advocating for Ezra.

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:38.060
If I go and I say, you know, I think I’m
working really hard and I think I deserve

00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:41.280
a raise, it’s like wow, what got into her?

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.750
What’s the deal?

00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:49.060
So Sheryl ended describing all this to me
by saying remember, they will have no empathy

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.660
for you.

00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:58.830
Now, I believe absent Comey, I might’ve
picked up 1 or 2 points among white women.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:02.320
I’ll give you the example I used in the
book.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:08.040
Before the Comey letter on October 28, I was
26 points ahead in the Philadelphia suburbs.

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.720
That could’ve only happened if I had a big
vote from women, Republican women, independent

00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:14.580
women.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:19.870
A week later, 11 days later, I win the Philadelphia
suburbs by 13 points.

00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:23.570
I needed to win by 18 points to be able to
counterbalance the rest of the state.

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:28.270
That wasn’t just me; that’s how Democrats
win Pennsylvania in presidential campaigns.

00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:33.820
It stopped my momentum, and it hurt me, particularly
among women.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:38.080
And I have so much anecdotal evidence for
this, and now researchers are starting to

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:39.610
pull some of this together.

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:43.270
You know, all of a sudden the husband turns
to the wife: I told you, she’s going to

00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:45.570
be in jail, you don’t wanna waste your vote.

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:50.430
You know, the boyfriend turns to the girlfriend
and says, She’s going to get locked up!

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:51.430
Don’t you hear?

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:52.900
She’s going to get locked up.

00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:59.300
All of a sudden it becomes a very fraught
kind of conflictual experience.

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.780
And so instead of saying I’m taking a chance,
I’m going to vote, it didn’t work.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:11.170
So I think that there is a lot of work still
to be done to try to appeal to as broad an

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:18.500
electorate as possible, but not by sacrificing
the constituents we have who have stuck with

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:26.340
us who are part of a majority if they aren’t
suppressed and if they can be motivated to

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.340
turn out.

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:28.780
And I hope that happens in 2018.

00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:32.970
EK: The premise of a lot of these conversations
— you would imagine what we’re talking

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:34.070
about is persuasion.

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:39.690
You imagine we’re talking about how do a
candidate, you in this case, get the most

00:46:39.690 --> 00:46:40.690
votes?

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:42.060
But in this case, you did.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:46.110
And one broader question that you don’t
really take on in the book, but since the

00:46:46.110 --> 00:46:50.630
turn of the millennium, 40 percent of the
presidential elections have seen the popular

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:55.100
vote won by Democrats and seen the result
overturned in the Electoral College.

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:56.100
HRC: That’s right.

00:46:56.100 --> 00:46:57.260
Which is just crazy in these days.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:59.490
EK: Do Democrats have a democracy problem?

00:46:59.490 --> 00:47:01.840
HRC: No, we have an Electoral College problem.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:03.390
EK: Should there be an Electoral College?

00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:06.490
HRC: As far back as 2000, I’ve said no.

00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:11.540
I think it’s an anachronism.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:18.090
I won in counties that produce two-thirds
of the economic output in the United States;

00:47:18.090 --> 00:47:23.940
I won in places that were more on the optimistic
side of the scale than the pessimistic side.

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:28.700
I won in places that understood and appreciated
diversity.

00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:33.081
I won in places where African-American and
younger voters were not suppressed, as they

00:47:33.081 --> 00:47:39.560
successfully were in, for example, Wisconsin
and other locations that I didn’t win.

00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:42.260
So I think you have to take this and pick
it apart.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:47.790
If you come with just one answer, it’s not
going to give you what you need to go forward.

00:47:47.790 --> 00:47:54.581
But at the end of day, if you look at what
where we are right now, if we don’t convince

00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:59.270
— and when I say “we,” it’s the great
big Democratic we, not me — but if we don’t

00:47:59.270 --> 00:48:06.630
convince people to register to vote and vote,
the simplest exercise of your citizenship

00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:13.960
in our country, in the 2018 election, then
I really do think we’re going to see the

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:20.870
clear and present danger to our democracy
that I’ve been talking about come to fruition.

00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:23.680
We will see a constitutional convention.

00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:29.740
Now, whether it ever finally gets ratified,
I’m not sure, but so it will be so divisive

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:37.090
and it will rile up so much of our population,
we will see the continuing efforts on the

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:43.950
right to disenfranchise people, to roll back
regulations that are good for our health and

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:47.480
our environment and so much else, we will
not recognize America.

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:53.310
So part of the reason I wrote this book was
not just to say okay, there’s a lot of theories

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:57.560
floating around, here’s what I think happened,
and I’ve got evidence behind what I say,

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:03.540
and I hope you’ll pay attention because
if we don’t, what happened to me will continue

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:06.660
to happen, and I don’t want to see that
in America.

00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:10.840
EK: But one question about that is actually
where the geography of that is going.

00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:15.080
You talked about winning more of the economic
output, probably more than any Democrat has

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.080
before —

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.080
HRC: Yeah, probably.

00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:21.300
EK: But part of that is that Democrats are
clustering in urban centers, they’re clustering

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:26.000
in big states, and the American political
system is not built to advantage that; it’s

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.410
built to disadvantage that.

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:31.200
It seems to me that the Democratic Party could
be in a position where it’s winning a lot

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.350
of moral victories.

00:49:32.350 --> 00:49:35.620
HRC: No, I’m not interested in that alone.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:38.020
I mean, obviously if we don’t win elections,
we don’t win.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.570
But there are pieces of this you can address,
Ezra.

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:47.130
Let’s start with voter suppression, which
is one of the five reasons why I believe I

00:49:47.130 --> 00:49:48.130
lost.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:54.520
Compare Wisconsin to Illinois or Wisconsin
to Minnesota — Wisconsin has had a concerted

00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:59.900
voter suppression campaign going on under
Scott Walker and the Republicans.

00:49:59.900 --> 00:50:04.380
The AP says maybe 200,000 people were turned
away.

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:06.580
Illinois has had none of that.

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:08.790
In fact, they’ve made it easier to vote.

00:50:08.790 --> 00:50:11.290
Minnesota is an easier-to-vote state.

00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:12.450
I won both of those.

00:50:12.450 --> 00:50:14.790
You’ve had voter suppression in Michigan.

00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:17.960
You’ve had voter suppression in Pennsylvania.

00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.200
Now, that is not about me.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:24.950
That is about what’s right and decent and
constitutional.

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:30.520
And I was shocked when the Supreme Court threw
out the guts of the Voting Rights Act.

00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:36.680
I was in the Senate, I voted for it, we voted
98 to nothing, George W. Bush signed it, and

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:41.520
along comes the Republican majority on the
Supreme Court and they throw it out, and Republican

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.960
governors and legislators could not have been
more gleeful.

00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:49.080
Now, that is not a big-ticket item.

00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.190
That is hard work.

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:55.240
We need to elect legislators, we need to elect
secretaries of state, we need to bring court

00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:59.340
cases, because if we don’t deal with this
voter suppression, yeah, the electorate will

00:50:59.340 --> 00:51:00.340
continue to shrink.

00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:04.850
And it won’t just be the Electoral College;
it will be within these states.

00:51:04.850 --> 00:51:10.520
A shrinkage of the legitimacy of our constitutional
democracy.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:15.660
So I care passionately about this because
this will determine what kind of country we

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.420
have for my grandchildren.

00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:22.160
And so I’m going to be out there day in
and day out trying to do what I can to support

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:32.840
efforts to give back voting to people, whoever
they are, across our country, so that their

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:37.200
voices can be heard and we have a democracy
that really functions right.

00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:39.900
EK: Hillary Clinton, thank you very much.

00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:40.400
HRC: Thank you.
