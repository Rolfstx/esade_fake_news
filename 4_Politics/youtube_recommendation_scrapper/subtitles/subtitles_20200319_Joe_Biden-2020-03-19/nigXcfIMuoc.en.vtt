00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:20.780 align:start position:0%
kind of out of position so so now what
 

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
kind of out of position so so now what

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:23.690 align:start position:0%
Bruce well at this point you know you
 

00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
Bruce well at this point you know you
tried<00:15:24.410><c> to</c>

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:25.129 align:start position:0%
tried to
 

00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:27.369 align:start position:0%
tried to
you<00:15:25.429><c> were</c><00:15:25.639><c> successful</c><00:15:26.119><c> in</c><00:15:26.509><c> the</c><00:15:26.629><c> pit</c><00:15:26.839><c> maneuver</c>

00:15:27.369 --> 00:15:27.379 align:start position:0%
you were successful in the pit maneuver
 

00:15:27.379 --> 00:15:30.429 align:start position:0%
you were successful in the pit maneuver
and<00:15:27.649><c> it</c><00:15:28.459><c> can</c><00:15:28.699><c> turn</c><00:15:29.149><c> into</c><00:15:29.360><c> a</c><00:15:29.509><c> barricade</c><00:15:30.170><c> or</c><00:15:30.350><c> a</c>

00:15:30.429 --> 00:15:30.439 align:start position:0%
and it can turn into a barricade or a
 

00:15:30.439 --> 00:15:32.619 align:start position:0%
and it can turn into a barricade or a
standoff<00:15:30.980><c> with</c><00:15:31.189><c> the</c><00:15:31.309><c> suspect</c><00:15:31.819><c> well</c><00:15:32.509><c> he's</c>

00:15:32.619 --> 00:15:32.629 align:start position:0%
standoff with the suspect well he's
 

00:15:32.629 --> 00:15:34.150 align:start position:0%
standoff with the suspect well he's
certainly<00:15:32.809><c> the</c><00:15:33.170><c> least</c><00:15:33.589><c> got</c><00:15:33.769><c> right</c><00:15:33.949><c> back</c>

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
certainly the least got right back
 

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.129 align:start position:0%
certainly the least got right back
behind<00:15:34.339><c> him</c><00:15:34.610><c> so</c><00:15:34.730><c> so</c><00:15:35.119><c> does</c><00:15:35.300><c> that</c><00:15:35.329><c> give</c><00:15:35.540><c> you</c><00:15:35.989><c> an</c>

00:15:36.129 --> 00:15:36.139 align:start position:0%
behind him so so does that give you an
 

00:15:36.139 --> 00:15:39.369 align:start position:0%
behind him so so does that give you an
indication<00:15:36.619><c> as</c><00:15:37.069><c> an</c><00:15:37.519><c> officer</c><00:15:38.029><c> as</c><00:15:38.209><c> we've</c><00:15:39.079><c> talked</c>

00:15:39.369 --> 00:15:39.379 align:start position:0%
indication as an officer as we've talked
 

00:15:39.379 --> 00:15:41.530 align:start position:0%
indication as an officer as we've talked
about<00:15:39.499><c> the</c><00:15:39.679><c> mindset</c><00:15:39.980><c> prior</c><00:15:40.369><c> to</c><00:15:40.519><c> now</c><00:15:40.670><c> but</c><00:15:41.360><c> that</c>

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:41.540 align:start position:0%
about the mindset prior to now but that
 

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.449 align:start position:0%
about the mindset prior to now but that
seems<00:15:41.899><c> to</c><00:15:42.019><c> me</c><00:15:42.170><c> to</c><00:15:42.290><c> be</c><00:15:42.679><c> an</c><00:15:42.829><c> indication</c><00:15:43.249><c> that</c>

00:15:43.449 --> 00:15:43.459 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be an indication that
 

00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:46.749 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be an indication that
this<00:15:43.879><c> is</c><00:15:43.939><c> not</c><00:15:44.360><c> a</c><00:15:44.389><c> person</c><00:15:45.079><c> who</c><00:15:45.110><c> might</c><00:15:45.470><c> just</c><00:15:46.399><c> get</c>

00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:10.700 align:start position:0%
that image on the right is video and
 

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.070 align:start position:0%
that image on the right is video and

00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:40.810 align:start position:0%
trying to take this person down you know
I<00:22:38.840><c> think</c><00:22:38.930><c> if</c><00:22:39.230><c> they're</c><00:22:39.410><c> 7hd</c><00:22:40.190><c> pulled</c><00:22:40.490><c> out</c><00:22:40.640><c> you</c>

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:40.820 align:start position:0%
I think if they're 7hd pulled out you
 

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
I think if they're 7hd pulled out you
probably<00:22:41.180><c> would</c><00:22:41.360><c> say</c><00:22:41.570><c> maybe</c><00:22:41.780><c> six</c><00:22:42.350><c> or</c><00:22:42.560><c> seven</c>

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.010 align:start position:0%
probably would say maybe six or seven
 

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:45.370 align:start position:0%
probably would say maybe six or seven
because<00:22:43.940><c> you</c><00:22:44.300><c> know</c><00:22:44.420><c> you</c><00:22:44.480><c> have</c><00:22:44.690><c> one</c><00:22:44.900><c> person</c><00:22:45.290><c> in</c>

00:22:45.370 --> 00:22:45.380 align:start position:0%
because you know you have one person in

but<00:23:09.710><c> that</c><00:23:09.740><c> was</c><00:23:10.100><c> insane</c><00:23:11.830><c> yeah</c><00:23:12.830><c> his</c><00:23:13.130><c> actions</c><00:23:13.700><c> now</c>

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:13.940 align:start position:0%
but that was insane yeah his actions now
 

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.630 align:start position:0%
but that was insane yeah his actions now
are<00:23:14.210><c> bordering</c><00:23:14.690><c> on</c><00:23:15.050><c> the</c><00:23:15.770><c> cancelling</c><00:23:16.310><c> of</c><00:23:16.490><c> this</c>

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
are bordering on the cancelling of this
 

00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.300 align:start position:0%
are bordering on the cancelling of this
pursuit<00:23:17.030><c> he's</c><00:23:17.270><c> just</c><00:23:17.540><c> endangering</c><00:23:18.230><c> too</c><00:23:19.040><c> many</c>

00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:19.310 align:start position:0%
pursuit he's just endangering too many
 

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:22.600 align:start position:0%
pursuit he's just endangering too many
lives<00:23:19.550><c> and</c><00:23:20.030><c> so</c><00:23:20.270><c> I'm</c><00:23:20.750><c> sure</c><00:23:20.810><c> CHP</c><00:23:21.650><c> is</c><00:23:21.770><c> evaluating</c>

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:22.610 align:start position:0%

00:23:22.610 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
lives and so I'm sure CHP is evaluating
that<00:23:22.790><c> maybe</c><00:23:23.360><c> to</c><00:23:23.540><c> back</c><00:23:23.750><c> off</c><00:23:24.050><c> but</c><00:23:24.650><c> they</c><00:23:24.830><c> also</c>

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.010 align:start position:0%
that maybe to back off but they also
 

00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
that maybe to back off but they also
might<00:23:25.310><c> have</c><00:23:25.460><c> some</c><00:23:25.640><c> additional</c><00:23:25.760><c> information</c>

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:26.690 align:start position:0%

about this suspect
besides<00:23:28.370><c> this</c><00:23:28.550><c> is</c><00:23:28.700><c> so</c><00:23:28.880><c> above</c><00:23:29.450><c> maybe</c><00:23:29.630><c> assault</c>

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:30.110 align:start position:0%
besides this is so above maybe assault

had people on lookers looking you know
 

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.950 align:start position:0%
had people on lookers looking you know
you're<00:40:58.310><c> trying</c><00:40:58.520><c> to</c><00:40:58.640><c> keep</c><00:40:58.790><c> everyone</c><00:40:59.210><c> safe</c><00:40:59.630><c> and</c>

00:40:59.950 --> 00:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
you're trying to keep everyone safe and
 

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.710 align:start position:0%
you're trying to keep everyone safe and
so<00:41:00.680><c> it</c><00:41:01.010><c> does</c><00:41:01.280><c> look</c><00:41:01.520><c> as</c><00:41:01.700><c> if</c><00:41:01.910><c> this</c><00:41:02.120><c> pursuit</c><00:41:02.480><c> is</c>

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
so it does look as if this pursuit is
