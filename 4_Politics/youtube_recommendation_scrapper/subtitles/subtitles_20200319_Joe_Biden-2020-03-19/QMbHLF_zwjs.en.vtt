00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.170
 There are some types of sharks that seem to do well in aquariums. You will see a lot of 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.519
 Nurse sharks, zebra sharks, some coral reef sharks and sand tiger sharks. But not the big white. 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.129
 For decades, aquariums have tried to contain the world's largest predatory fish. 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.220
 Institutions like Marineland and SeaWorld have taken Steinhart Aquarium over and over again 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.340
 White sharks during the 1970s, 80s and 90s, sometimes drawing huge crowds. 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.800
 But they did not last long. Some need help with swimming. None of them will eat. 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.700
 Longest duration of 16 days. 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.900
 A 1984 report from the Steinhart Aquarium created this way: 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.810
 "In most cases it can be said that all this and captive sharks were merely in the process 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.400
 From death, with some taking longer than others. ”They built a detailed transmission 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.540
 Tank with harness and IV fluid, but still can't keep sharks alive. 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.040
 It was not until 2004 that Monterey Bay demonstrated an aquarium that it could have been preserved 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.120
 White sharks for at least six months. It took a massive effort, and nobody has since. 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.960
 John Hosh: Our unique approach was a systematic and logical hierarchy of groundbreaking matters 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.759
 So our success started with tank design. 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.189
 The Monterey Bay Aquarium was a million gallons, an egg-shaped reservoir, 35 feet deep, designed for 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:28.200
 Open ocean animals such as tuna and sharks. Thus you need a large tank. You also need a little shark. 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.460
 On average, the 15 eggs are white. 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.520
 Monterey Bay Aquarium caught one in 2004 that was 4 feet 4 inches, less than a year. 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.560
 This made it easier to move and easier to memorize. 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.100
 John Hosh: When they are young they feed on fish. And when they grow up they move on 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.160
 To feed more on mammals. And so we were targeting the age segment, where we knew we were more 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.220
 Able to feed their natural diet. Once they collected the shark, they did not 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.120
 Take it straight to the tub. Meanwhile, the Monterey Bay team put 4 million gallons 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.799
 The pen is right there in the ocean. This way they can observe the shark and 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.909
 See if it will feed before transporting it in the transport tank for travel from Southern California 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:16.360
 Where sharks are born to the aquarium. Like all fish, sharks need water 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.140
 Continuously pass through the nostrils in order to obtain oxygen. 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.019
 Most species can open and close their mouths to pump water through. But white sharks 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.959
 And dozens of other species don't do that. To breathe, they have to move forward 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.189
 Through the water with their mouths open. This is why white sharks begin to weaken 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.379
 Once they are caught in a network. This is why they need dedicated custom transport 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.579
 Tank with mobile life support. John Hosh: Everything from oxygen sensors 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.299
 Camcorders, lighting and filtration systems were essential to what was transformed 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.240
 Be approximately 9 to 11 hours transportation time. 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.980
 The presence of the aquarium jumped 30 percent while the shark was on display. 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.800
 After 6 and a half months, they decided 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.060
 Free him because he killed 2 other sharks. 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.060
 Over the next 6 years, the aquarium offered 5 more white sharks - some of which were paid 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.000
 Hunters to hand, some caught themselves. Their length of stay ranged from 11 days to 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.549
 5 months. The Monterey Bay Aquarium has succeeded in doing what no one else can. 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:22.329
 But the matter had an effect on sharks. They put visible sores from bumping to 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.769
 Sides of the tank. Sian Van Sommeran: We have already crept into 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:33.220
 Photographers are taking pictures of sharks as they have started to attrit and fail 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.420
 Because the walls basically continued to be leveled. As we saw it, it was a vase 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.959
 Of the flowers that will be kept for visitors. Historically, aquariums have kept sharks that have lived 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.359
 Near the sea floor or near coral reefs. That makes sense - it's easier to recreate those 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:54.560
 Habitat in a tank. But in recent decades, aquariums have wanted to bring bigger, 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.620
 More sharks spend time wandering the open ocean. 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.560
 They were able to display the world's largest shark, the whale shark, 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.560
 If they have a large enough tank. But surface sharks are used to being able 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.249
 For long distance unobstructed swimming, change directions only as they wish. 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:15.560
 So the fastest-moving sharks like the white shark, the mako shark, the blue shark, 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.560
 They have a problem with the walls when they are placed in a tank. 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.800
 This was what was happening with Monterey Bay the sixth white shark in 2011. 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.390
 They decided to release him after 55 days, and their tracking sign revealed that the shark was dead 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:31.820
 Shortly after his release. They are not sure why. 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.520
 But since then, they have not tried to bring in another great white shark. 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.140
 John Hosh: It's just a very, very resource intensive program and we felt as if we were 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:45.950
 Achieve our goal of general public definition for live white shark. 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:51.030
 It took a massive system that was carefully planned to keep the white shark alive. Until then, 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.040
 The sharks didn't quite fit there. We don't seem to stop trying. 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:01.780
 Earlier this year, a large 11.5-foot white white shark was moved to an aquarium in Okinawa, Japan 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:06.500
 After falling into the fisherman's network. It was the only adult white shark ever 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.610
 It is shown and within 3 days 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:10.900
 It was dead. 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.540
 I wanted to show you a great online resource called Heritage Biodiversity 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:28.340
 Library - it is the product of a few dozen museums and libraries all agree to survey millions of 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.190
 Pages of books related to biodiversity. They have a bunch of cool albums on Flickr, 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.370
 Including one is all about sharks. Some of these date back to the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.600
 Once again when naturalists used to call sharks "sea dogs" 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.210
 It is funny because as we now know 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.360
 Sharks have been roaming the ocean for about 300 million years 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.640
 Before the first mammals appeared.
