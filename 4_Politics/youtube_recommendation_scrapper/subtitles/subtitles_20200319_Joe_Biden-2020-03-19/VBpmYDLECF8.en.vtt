00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:06.420
In July 2019, Elizabeth Warren was part of
a debate with former Congressman John Delaney.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.700
Delaney was also running for president, and
he criticized Warren for being unrealistic.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.960
I think Democrats win when we run on real
solutions, not impossible promises, when we

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.900
run on things that are workable, not fairy
tale economics.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.480
If you want to understand Elizabeth Warren, her response to that is a great place to start.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.640
I don’t understand 
why anybody goes to all the trouble of running

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.820
for president of the United States just to
talk about what we really can’t do and shouldn’t

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.940
fight for.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.140
I don’t get it.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.380
Elizabeth Warren wants to make really big
changes to the way things work.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.240
It’s going to take big structural change
in America.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:51.140
It's a thread you can find throughout
her career, from her years as a law professor,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.360
to her creation of a new federal agency, to
her time as a US Senator.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.160
Warren doesn't want to revert America back
to a time before Trump.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.600
She wants to change something more fundamental
about the country's institutions.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.140
We can’t fix this broken system by only
treating symptoms

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.480
So, where did that idea come from?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.340
Is that what we want?

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.520
And -- if it is -- is Elizabeth Warren the
best person for the job?

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.380
In the early 2000s, Elizabeth Warren wasn't a politician
yet.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.750
She was a law professor, and she was trying
to figure out why so many Americans were filing

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.299
for bankruptcy, at a time when the economy
seemed to be doing great.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.759
The thing you have to understand about Warren's
academic work is that it was counter to the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.800
conventional wisdom when it was happening.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.340
Most people agreed at the time that the US
economy was strong.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.509
The unemployment rate was low, GDP was high,
and global trade agreements like NAFTA had

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.800
made tons of goods super cheap…

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.860
But Warren saw that underneath it all, something
in American life had changed.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.120
Families live in a much more dangerous economic
world than they did a generation ago.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.600
One thing Warren was doing was refocusing
how we thought about the economy from what

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:13.680
was happening in the economy to what was happening
to families themselves.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.019
In particular, she noticed that to
cover basic expenses, American families were

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.650
taking on more and more dangerous loans.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.540
Alan Greenspan was sworn in for his fifth
term as chairman of the Fed.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.939
This makes the time ripe for a conversation
with Elizabeth Warren.

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:35.189
Alan Greenspan, our national economic leader,
has stood up for the last four years and told

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:36.949
Americans “borrow against your house!”

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:41.440
It helped her realize before almost anyone
else that something bad might be coming

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.820
in the economy.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:49.100
That's really scary financial advice for someone
to be giving American families.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.700
And what frightens me, is millions of American
families have taken that advice.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.980
Warren said those things in 2004.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.120
Four years later, she turned out to be right.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.059
One in every 500 homes defaulting on their
mortgage, economists worry the housing slump

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:08.279
will plunge the broader economy into a recession.

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:12.669
The federal government Tuesday began pumping
billions of dollars into U.S. banks.

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:16.269
Citigroup and Wells Fargo are each getting
$25 billion.

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:23.029
Is there a word for your emotions, mood, watching
all of this?

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:27.700
Yeah, I think I alternate between furious
and astounded.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.120
We bailed them out and they keep all the profits
and taxpayers pick up all the losses.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.650
There's this moment in 2009.

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.339
The recession is on full blast.

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:40.109
This is when I probably first saw Elizabeth
Warren on television.

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.209
Please welcome to the show, Elizabeth Warren!

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.139
She goes on Jon Stewart's show and just sort
of explains what's going on.

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:51.060
We go fifty years without a financial panic.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.480
Then what happens, we say “regulation, ah
it’s pain, it’s expensive, we don’t need it,”

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.880
so we start pulling the threads
out of the regulatory fabric.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.800
So we have two choices.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.540
We’re going to decide basically “hey, we don’t
need regulation, it’s fine" Or, alternatively,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.340
Or, alternatively, we're going to say "You know

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.459
we’re going to put in some smart regulation,
and what we’re going to have going forward

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.749
is we’re going to have some stability and
real prosperity for ordinary folks."

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.780
And that’s socialism

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:18.680
(laugher/applause)

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.100
That incredibly clear explanation of what’s going on kind of knocks him for a loop.

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.590
That is the first time in probably six months
to a year, that I’ve felt better.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.860
He breaks character in that moment to say
thank you.

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.560
That was like financial chicken soup for me.

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.340
Thank you.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.660
Something that I think is important to note,
though, is what makes sense about it.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.740
Something that has been a through line of
Warren's career is that complexity is something

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.240
the powerful wield against the powerless.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.760
And complexity is something that people use
to shift blame.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.900
Well, if the financial crisis is too complex
for anybody to understand.

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.930
You can't fix it and you definitely can't
blame anybody for it.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.680
What is distinct about Warren in my view,
is that she does understand these problems

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.770
so well.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.183
Elizabeth Warren has a lot of plans.

00:05:02.183 --> 00:05:05.620
My question is, what is her plan to make
the plans a reality?

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.020
What's interesting about her in this respect,
is compared to a lot of the other candidates,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.530
she's much more specific on how she would
get these things done.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.009
I mean, we've had this Democratic primary
that is about differences in plans... that

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:19.969
the candidates are not likely to have the
votes in the Senate to come anywhere near

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:20.969
passing.

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.700
And here's Warren arguing in a way the others
primarily don't, that we should get rid of

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.920
the filibuster.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.720
That means lowering the number of votes a
bill needs to pass the Senate from 60 to 51.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.319
We should get rid of the Electoral College.

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.680
So whoever gets the most votes actually becomes
President.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.449
We should make D.C. and Puerto Rico states.

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.669
So that millions of US citizens who can’t
vote for the President or members of Congress

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:44.930
would finally be able to.

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.960
It is often ignored, because process isn’t
sexy, but process ends up deciding outcomes.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.300
She's been much more focused on it, and much
more ambitious than most of her competitors.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.740
And it's something that actually sets her
apart in the field.

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:03.440
On a debate stage, or in a long grueling campaign
against Donald Trump, what do you think voters

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.940
would learn about Elizabeth Warren who don’t
know her very well now.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.100
I think one of the advantages Warren has,
if you’re going to make the case for her,

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:16.050
she has built a much more thoroughgoing theory
of political corruption and how it attaches

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.669
itself, not just Donald Trump, but to the
entire system he came into.

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:25.520
Huge fossil fuel corporations have bought off
our government.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.360
The gun industry has bought off our government.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.340
If you look at the way some of the other matchups
look, Joe Biden is clearly going to run against

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:41.969
Donald Trump as, Donald Trump is a bad man
who does not reflect the best of American

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:42.680
values.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.140
There is some possibility that could work.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.240
But also, it didn't work that well in 2016.

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:51.930
I think Warren wants to push against Donald
Trump as an emblem of political corruption.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:58.240
So let’s start with the obvious, Donald
Trump is corruption in the flesh.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.980
That is a place where polling suggests he's
a lot more vulnerable.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:07.160
And so Warren's particular approach to Trump,
where she is able to say… that this kind

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.999
of political corruption is the problem.

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:10.939
That is a very potent attack in American politics.

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.480
In some ways it's a potent attack Donald Trump
levied reasonably well against Hillary Clinton.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.040
And it's one Warren is arguably, I think,
uniquely capable of levying back against Donald Trump
